  <h2><span class="smcap">About the Story</span></h2>

  <p class="intro">Annabel Pellissier, for reasons of her own, allows Sir John
  Ferringhall to believe that she is her sister Anna. Anna lets the deception
  continue and has to bear the burden of her sister&rsquo;s reputation which,
  in Paris at any rate, is that of being a coquette. Endless complications
  ensue when both sisters return to London.</p>

  <p class="intro">This is one of the late E. Phillips Oppenheim's most
  intriguing stories.</p>

  <h3>PRODUCTION NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">This e-book is based on the undated HTML version of <i>Anna
  the Adventuress</i> generally available on the Internet. It is augmented with
  illustrations taken from a <a href=
  "http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000321970">digitised copy of the first
  US edition</a> and with restored cover images of this and of the 1952 Ward,
  Lock &amp; Co. reprint.</p>

  <p class="note">The edition of the book given here appeared after Oppenheim's
  death (1946). It deviates in several respects from the first edition in that
  the titles, sequence and contents of some chapters differ. Two of the
  illustrations given here (#5 and #9) are from chapters in the first
  edition  entitled "Some Confidences And A Supper" and "My Pseudo Husband"
  that are missing from the present version.

  <h2><a name="Chapter_I"
     id="Chapter_I"></a>ANNA THE ADVENTURESS</h2>

  <h2><i>Chapter I</i></h2>

  <h3>THE CARPET-KNIGHT AND THE LADY</h3>

  <p>The girl paused and steadied herself for a moment against a field gate.
  Her breath came fast in little sobbing pants. Her dainty shoes were soiled
  with dust and there was a great tear in her skirt. Very slowly, very
  fearfully, she turned her head. Her cheeks were the colour of chalk, her eyes
  were filled with terror. If a cart were coming, or those labourers in the
  field had heard, escape was impossible.</p>

  <p>The terror faded from her eyes. A faint gleam of returning colour gave her
  at once a more natural appearance. So far as the eye could reach, the white
  level road, with its fringe of elm-trees, was empty. Away off in the fields
  the blue-smocked peasants bent still at their toil. They had heard nothing,
  seen nothing. A few more minutes, and she was safe.</p>

  <p>Yet before she turned once more to resume her flight she schooled herself
  with an effort to look where it had happened. A dark mass of wreckage, over
  which hung a slight mist of vapour, lay half in the ditch, half across the
  hedge, close under a tree from the trunk of which the bark had been torn and
  stripped. A few yards further off something grey, inert, was lying, a
  huddled-up heap of humanity twisted into a strange unnatural shape. Again the
  chalky pallor spread even to her lips, her eyes became lit with the old
  terror. She withdrew her head with a little moan, and resumed her flight.
  Away up on the hillside was the little country railway station. She fixed her
  eyes upon it and ran, keeping always as far as possible in the shadow of the
  hedge, gazing fearfully every now and then down along the valley for the
  white smoke of the train.</p>

  <p>She reached the station, and mingling with a crowd of excursionists who
  had come from the river on the other side, took her place in the train
  unnoticed. She leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes. Until the last
  moment she was afraid.</p>

  <p>Arrived in Paris she remembered that she had not the money for a
  <i>fiacre</i>. She was in ill trim for walking, but somehow or other she made
  her way as far as the Champs Elys&eacute;es, and sank down upon an empty
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8"
     id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>seat.</p>

  <p>She had not at first the power for concealment. Her nerves were shattered,
  her senses dazed by this unexpected shock. She sat there, a mark for
  boulevarders, the unconscious object of numberless wondering glances. Paris
  was full, and it was by no means a retired spot which she had found. Yet she
  never once thought of changing it. A person of somewhat artificial graces and
  mannerisms, she was for once in her life perfectly natural. Terror had laid a
  paralyzing hand upon her, fear kept her almost unconscious of the curious
  glances which she was continually attracting.</p>

  <p>Then there came briskly along the path towards her, an Englishman. He was
  perhaps forty-five years of age. He was dressed with the utmost care, and he
  set his feet upon the broad walk as though the action were in some way a
  condescension. He was alert, well-groomed, and yet&mdash;perhaps in contrast
  with the more volatile French type&mdash;there was a suggestion of weight
  about him, not to say heaviness. He too looked at the girl, slackened his
  pace and looked at her again through his eye-glasses, looked over his
  shoulder after he had passed, and finally came to a dead stop. He scratched
  his upper lip reflectively.</p>

  <p>It was a habit of his to talk to himself. In the present case it did not
  matter, as there was no one else within earshot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dear me! I wonder what I ought to
  do. She is English! I am sure of that. She is English, and apparently in some
  distress. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned slowly round. He was inclined to be a good-natured person, and
  he had no nervous fears of receiving a snub. The girl was pretty, and
  apparently a lady.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She cannot be aware,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that she is making
  herself conspicuous. It would surely be only common politeness to drop her a
  hint&mdash;a fellow countrywoman too. I trust that she will not misunderstand
  me. I believe&mdash;I believe that I must risk it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood before her, his hat in his hand, his head bent, his voice lowered
  to a convenient pitch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you appear to be a
  fellow countrywoman of mine, and in some distress. Can I be of any
  assistance? I can assure you that it would give me very much
  pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her first upward glance was one of terrified apprehension. When she saw
  however that this man was a stranger, and obviously harmless, her expression
  changed as though by magic. A delicate flush of colour streamed into her
  cheeks. Her eyes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9"
     id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>fell, and then sought his again with timid
     interest. Her natural instincts reasserted themselves. She began to
     act.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly, &ldquo;but I
  don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think that I know you, do
  I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that you do not,&rdquo; he admitted, with a smile which
  he meant to be encouraging. &ldquo;You remind me of the story which they tell
  against us over here, you know&mdash;of the Englishman who refused to be
  saved from drowning because he was unacquainted with his rescuer. Permit me
  to introduce myself. My name is Ferringhall&mdash;Sir John
  Ferringhall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was genuine interest in her eyes now. Sir John saw it, and was
  flattered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are Sir John Ferringhall,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Yes, I
  remember you now. You were pointed out to me at&mdash;a few nights
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was not in the least surprised. A millionaire and a knight, even though
  his money has been made in carpets, is used to being a person of
  interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am fairly well known
  here. I must apologize, I suppose, for speaking to you, but your appearance
  certainly indicated that you were in some sort of trouble, and you were
  becoming&mdash;pardon me&mdash;an object of comment to the passers-
  by.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl sat up and looked at him with a curious twist at the corners of
  her mouth&mdash;humorous or pathetic, he could not tell which. As though
  accidentally she swept her skirts from a chair close drawn to her own. Sir
  John hesitated. She was marvellously pretty, but he was not quite
  sure&mdash;yet&mdash;that it was advisable for him to sit with her in so
  public a place. His inclinations prompted him most decidedly to take the
  vacant chair. Prudence reminded him that he was a county magistrate, and
  parliamentary candidate for a somewhat difficult borough, where his principal
  supporters were dissenters of strict principles who took a zealous interest
  in his moral character. He temporized, and the girl raised her eyes once more
  to his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are the Sir John Ferringhall who has bought the Lyndmore
  estate, are you not?&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s sisters
  used once to live in the old manor house. I believe you have had it pulled
  down, have you not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Misses Pellissier!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Then your
  name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is Pellissier. My father was Colonel Pellissier.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10"
     id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>He had an appointment in Jersey, you know,
     after he left the army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John did not hesitate any longer. He sat down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;this is most
  extraordinary. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he stopped short, for he began to remember things. He was not quite
  sure whether, after all, he had been wise. He would have risen again, but for
  the significance of the action.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then some of your family history is
  known to me. One of your aunts died, I believe, and the other removed to
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is living there now,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your father is dead too, I believe,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and
  your mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two years ago,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;They died within a few
  months of one another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very sad&mdash;very sad indeed,&rdquo; he remarked uneasily.
  &ldquo;I remember hearing something about it. I believe that the common
  report was that you and your sister had come to Paris to study
  painting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She assented gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have a small studio,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;in the Rue de
  St. Pierre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John looked at her sideways. Her eyes were fixed upon the ground, the
  pink colour coming and going in her cheeks was very delicate and girlish.
  After all, this could never be the black sheep. He had been quite right to
  sit down. It was astonishing how seldom it was that his instincts betrayed
  him. He breathed a little sigh of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the world after all is a very
  small place. We are not altogether strangers, are we? I feel that under the
  circumstances I have the right to offer you my advice, and if necessary my
  help. I beg that you will consider me your friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him with fluttering eyelids&mdash;sweetly grateful. It was
  such an unexpected stroke of fortune. Sir John was not used to such glances,
  and he liked them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is so difficult,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;so impossible to
  explain. Even to my own brother&mdash;if I had one&mdash;I could not tell
  everything, and you, although you are so kind, you are almost a stranger,
  aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You must not think of me as
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11"
     id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>one. Try and consider me your elder
     brother, or an old family friend, whichever you like best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She thanked him with one of her shy little glances. More than ever Sir
  John was glad that he had sat down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very, very difficult,&rdquo; she continued, looking
  steadfastly at the ground. &ldquo;Only&mdash;I have come face to
  face&mdash;with something terrible, and wholly unexpected trouble. I want to
  leave Paris to-day&mdash;this very day. I want to leave it for
  ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her very gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your sister?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What of her? Have you
  quarrelled with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have not quarrelled with her. It
  is simply our point of view which is altogether different. I want to get
  away&mdash;to go to London. I cannot explain beyond that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am sure,&rdquo; Sir John declared, &ldquo;that I shall not
  ask you. I know nothing about the matter, but I feel convinced that you are
  right. You ought to have had better advice two years ago. Paris is not the
  place for two young girls. I presume that you have been living
  alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sighed gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;is so independent. She is
  Bohemian to the finger-tips. She makes me feel terribly
  old-fashioned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John smiled and congratulated himself upon his insight. He was so
  seldom wrong.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The next question, Miss Anna,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is how am I to
  help you? I am wholly at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly. Her expression was a little changed, less
  innocent, more discerning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;How do you know&mdash;why do you
  think that my name is Anna?&rdquo; He smiled in a quietly superior way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am right. I am very good at
  guessing names.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am really curious,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;You must have
  heard&mdash;have you&mdash;oh, tell me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she begged.
  &ldquo;Have you heard things?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tears stood in her eyes. She leaned a little towards him. Nothing but
  the publicity of the place and the recollection of that terrible constituency
  kept him from attempting some perfectly respectful but unmistakable evidence
  of his sympathy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that your sister has
  been a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12"
     id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>little indiscreet. It is nothing at all for
     you to worry about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked away from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; she said, in a low despairing tone, &ldquo;that
  people would talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He coughed gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was inevitable,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It is not, of course,
  a pleasant subject of conversation for you or for me, yet I think I may
  venture to suggest to you that your
  sister&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;indiscretions&mdash;have reached a point which
  makes a separation between you almost a necessity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;must come,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not lay claim,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to any remarkable
  amount of insight, but it is possible, is it not, that I have stumbled upon
  your present cause of distress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are wonderful!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>He smiled complacently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. This is simply a chapter of coincidences. Now what I
  want you to feel is this. I want you to feel that you have found a friend who
  has a strong desire to be of service to you. Treat me as an elder brother, if
  you like. He is here by your side. How can he help you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She threw such a look upon him that even he, Sir John Ferringhall,
  carpet-merchant, hide-bound Englishman, slow-witted, pompous, deliberate,
  felt his heart beat to music. Perhaps the Parisian atmosphere had affected
  him. He leaned towards her, laid his hand tenderly upon hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you realize,&rdquo; he went on, in a lower and less assured
  tone, &ldquo;that I am in earnest&mdash;very much in earnest. You must let me
  do whatever I can for you. I shall count it a privilege.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I trust you altogether.
  I am going to take you entirely at your word. I want to leave Paris to-day.
  Will you lend me the money for my ticket to London?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all the pleasure in the world,&rdquo; he answered heartily.
  &ldquo;Let me add too that I am thankful for your decision. You have
  somewhere to go to in London, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is my aunt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The one who used to live
  at Lyndmore. She will take me in until I can make some plans. It will be
  horribly dull, and she is a very trying person. But anything is better than
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took out his watch.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13"
     id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your best route will be via
  Boulogne and Folkestone at nine o&rsquo;clock from the Gare du Nord. What
  about your luggage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I could get a few of my things, at any rate,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;My sister is sure to be out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is just six o&rsquo;clock now.
  Supposing you fetch what you can, and if you will allow me, I will see you
  off. It would give me great pleasure if you would dine with me somewhere
  first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him wistfully, but with some unwilling doubt in her wrinkled
  forehead. It was excellently done, especially as she loved good dinners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind to think of it,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;but&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think perhaps&mdash;that I had better
  not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with me you need have no
  apprehension. I am almost old enough to be your father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him with uplifted eyebrows&mdash;a look of whimsical
  incredulity. Sir John felt that after all forty-five was not so very old.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds quite absurd,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Yet it is my
  last evening, and I think&mdash;if you are sure that you would like to have
  me&mdash;that I will risk it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will go to a very quiet place,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;a
  place where I have often taken my own sisters. You will be wearing your
  travelling dress, and no doubt you would prefer it. Shall we say at half-past
  seven?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will take a carriage,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and fetch my
  things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us say that Caf&eacute; Maston, in the Boulevard des
  Italiennes, at half-past seven then,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;I shall be
  waiting for you there, and in the meantime, if you will help
  yourself&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t look like that. It is a very small affair,
  after all, and you can pay me back if you will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took the pocket-book and looked up at him with a little impulsive
  movement. Her voice shook, her eyes were very soft and melting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot thank you, Sir John,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall never
  be able to thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you postpone the attempt, then?&rdquo; he said
  gallantly, &ldquo;until I have done something to deserve your gratitude? You
  will not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14"
     id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>forget&mdash;seven-thirty, Caf&eacute;
     Maston, Boulevard des Italiennes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She drove off in a little <i>fiacre</i>, nodding and smiling at Sir John,
  who remained upon the Avenue. He too, when she had disappeared, called a
  carriage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hotel Ritz,&rdquo; he said mechanically to the coachman. &ldquo;If
  only her sister is half as pretty, no wonder that she has set the Parisians
  talking.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_II"
     id="Chapter_II"></a><i>Chapter II</i></h2>

  <h3>THE ADVENTURE OF ANNABEL</h3>

  <p>The man spoke mercilessly, incisively, as a surgeon. Only he hated the
  words he uttered, hated the blunt honesty which forced them from his lips.
  Opposite, his pupil stood with bowed head and clasped hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have the temperament,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have the
  ideas. Your first treatment of a subject is always correct, always
  suggestive. But of what avail is this? You have no execution, no finish. You
  lack only that mechanical knack of expression which is the least important
  part of an artist&rsquo;s equipment, but which remains a tedious and absolute
  necessity. We have both tried hard to develop it&mdash;you and I&mdash;and we
  have failed. It is better to face the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Oh, much better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I must confess to a great
  disappointment. I looked upon you from the first as the most promising of my
  pupils. I overlooked the mechanical imperfections of your work, the utter
  lack of finish, the crudeness of your drawing. I said to myself, &lsquo;this
  will come.&rsquo; It seems that I was mistaken. You cannot draw. Your fingers
  are even now as stiff as a schoolgirl&rsquo;s. You will never be able to
  draw. You have the ideas. You are an artist by the Divine right of birth, but
  whatever form of expression may come to you at some time it will not be
  painting. Take my advice. Burn your palette and your easel. Give up your
  lonely hours of work here. Look somewhere else in life. Depend upon it, there
  is a place for you&mdash;waiting. Here you only waste your time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was silent, and in the gloom of the dimly lit apartment he could not
  see her face. He drew a little breath of relief. The worst was over now. He
  continued tenderly, almost affectionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all, there are great things left in the world for you.
  Painting is only one slender branch of the great tree. To-night all this may
  seem hard and cruel. To-morrow you will feel like a freed woman. To-morrow I
  shall come and talk to you again&mdash;of other things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A man of infinite tact and kindness, he spoke his message and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_16"
     id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>went. The girl, with a little moan, crossed
     the room and threw open the window.</p>

  <p>She looked steadfastly out. Paris, always beautiful even in the darkness,
  glittered away to the horizon. The lights of the Champs Elys&eacute;es and
  the Place de la Concorde, suggestive, brilliant, seductive, shone like an
  army of fireflies against the deep cool background of the night. She stood
  there with white set face and nervously clenched fingers. The echo of those
  kindly words seemed still to ring in her ears. She was crushed with a sense
  of her own terrible impotency. A failure! She must write herself down a
  failure! At her age, with her ambitions, with her artistic temperament and
  creative instincts, she was yet to be denied all coherent means of
  expression. She was to fall back amongst the ruck, a young woman of talent,
  content perhaps to earn a scanty living by painting Christmas cards, or
  teaching at a kindergarten. Her finger-nails dug into her flesh. It was the
  bitterest moment of her life. She flung herself back into the bare little
  room, cold, empty, comfortless. In a momentary fury she seized and tore in
  pieces the study which remained upon the easel. The pieces fell to the ground
  in a little white shower. It was the end, she told herself, fiercely. And
  then, as she stood there, with the fragments of the torn canvas at her feet,
  some even caught upon her skirt, the door was thrown open, and a girl entered
  humming a light tune.</p>

  <p>The newcomer stopped short upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna! What tragedy has happened, little sister? No lights, no
  supper, no coffee&mdash;and, above all, no Mr. Courtlaw. How dreary it all
  looks. Never mind. Come and help me pack. I&rsquo;m off to
  England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel, are you mad? To England! You are joking, of course. But
  come in, dear. I will light the stove, and there shall be some coffee
  presently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coffee! Bah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The newcomer picked her way across the floor with daintily uplifted
  skirts, and subsided into a deck chair of stretched canvas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not rob you of your coffee, most dutiful of sisters!&rdquo;
  she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have had adventures&mdash;oh, more than one, I can
  assure you. It has been a marvellous day&mdash;and I am going to
  England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked at her sister gravely. Even in her painting smock and with her
  disarranged hair, the likeness between the two girls was marvellous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The adventures I do not doubt, Annabel,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;They <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17"
     id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>seem to come to you as naturally as
     disappointment&mdash;to other people. But to England! What has happened,
     then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Already the terror of a few hours ago seemed to have passed away from the
  girl who leaned back so lazily in her chair, watching the tip of her patent
  shoe swing backwards and forwards. She could even think of what had happened.
  Very soon she would be able to forget it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Happened! Oh, many things,&rdquo; she declared indolently.
  &ldquo;The most important is that I have a new admirer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The wonderful likeness between the two girls was never less noticeable
  than at that moment. Anna stood looking down upon her sister with grave
  perturbed face. Annabel lounged in her chair with a sort of insolent
  <i>abandon</i> in her pose, and wide-open eyes which never flinched or
  drooped. One realized indeed then where the differences lay; the tender
  curves about Anna&rsquo;s mouth transformed into hard sharp lines in
  Annabel&rsquo;s, the eyes of one, truthful and frank, the other&rsquo;s more
  beautiful but with less expression&mdash;windows lit with dazzling light, but
  through which one saw&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A new admirer, Annabel? But what has that to do with your going to
  England?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Everything! He is Sir John Ferringhall&mdash;very stupid, very
  respectable, very egotistical. But, after all, what does that matter? He is
  very much taken with me. He tries hard to conceal it, but he
  cannot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; Anna asked quietly, &ldquo;do you run away? It is
  not like you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How unkind!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Still, since it is better
  to tell you, Sir John is very much in earnest, but his respectability is
  something altogether too overpowering. Of course I knew all about him years
  ago, and he is exactly like everybody&rsquo;s description of him. I am
  afraid, Anna, just a little afraid, that in Paris I and my friends here might
  seem a trifle advanced. Besides, he might hear things. That is why I called
  myself Anna.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you did what?&rdquo; Anna exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Called myself Anna,&rdquo; the girl repeated coolly. &ldquo;It
  can&rsquo;t make any difference to you, and there are not half a dozen people
  in Paris who could tell us apart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna tried to look angry, but her mouth betrayed her. Instead, she
  laughed, laughed with lips and eyes, laughed till the tears ran down her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You little wretch!&rdquo; she exclaimed weakly. &ldquo;Why should
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18"
     id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>I bear the burden of your wickedness? Who
     knows what might come of it? I shall permit nothing of the
     sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late, my dear girl,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I gave your
  name. I called myself Anna. After all, what can it matter? It was just to
  make sure. Three little letters can&rsquo;t make a bit of
  difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it may matter very much indeed,&rdquo; Anna declared.
  &ldquo;Perhaps for myself I do not mind, but this man is sure to find out
  some day, and he will not like having been deceived. Tell him the truth,
  Annabel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The truth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a brief but intense silence. Anna felt that her words had become
  charged with a fuller and more subtle meaning than any which she had intended
  to impart. &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; It was a moment of awkwardness between
  the two sisters&mdash;a moment, too, charged with its own psychological
  interest, for there were secrets between them which for many months had made
  their intercourse a constrained and difficult thing. It was Annabel who
  spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How crude you are, Anna!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a little sigh.
  &ldquo;Sir John is not at all that sort. He is the kind of man who would much
  prefer a little dust in his eyes. But heavens, I must pack!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet and disappeared in the room beyond, from which she
  emerged a few minutes later with flushed cheeks and dishevelled hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is positively no use, Anna,&rdquo; she declared, appealingly.
  &ldquo;You must pack for me. I am sorry, but you have spoilt me. I
  can&rsquo;t do it even decently myself, and I dare not run the risk of
  ruining all my clothes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laughed, gave in and with deft fingers created order out of chaos.
  Soon the trunk, portmanteau and hat box were ready. Then she took her
  sister&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have never asked you for your
  confidence. We have lived under the same roof, but our ways seem to have lain
  wide apart. There are many things which I do not understand. Have you
  anything to tell me before you go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Anna! As though I should think of depressing you with my
  long list of misdeeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have nothing to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19"
     id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

  <p>So Annabel departed with the slightest of farewells, wearing a thick
  travelling veil, and sitting far back in the corner of a closed carriage.
  Anna watched her from the windows, watched the carriage jolt away along the
  cobbled street and disappear. Then she stepped back into the empty room and
  stood for a moment looking down upon the scattered fragments of her last
  canvas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a night of endings,&rdquo; she murmured to herself.
  &ldquo;Perhaps for me,&rdquo; she added, with a sudden wistful look out of
  the bare high window, &ldquo;a night of beginnings.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_III"
     id="Chapter_III"></a><i>Chapter III</i></h2>

  <h3>ANNA? OR ANNABEL?</h3>

  <p>Sir John was wholly unable to understand the laugh and semi-ironical cheer
  which greeted his entrance to the smoking-room of the English Club on the
  following evening. He stood upon the threshold, dangling his eye-glasses in
  his fingers, stolid, imperturbable, mildly interrogative. He wanted to know
  what the joke against him was&mdash;if any.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I enquire,&rdquo; he asked smoothly, &ldquo;in what way my
  appearance contributes to your amusement? If there is a joke I should like to
  share it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A fair-haired young Englishman looked up from the depths of his easy
  chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hear him?&rdquo; he remarked, looking impressively around.
  &ldquo;A joke! Sir John, if you had presented yourself here an hour ago we
  should have greeted you in pained silence. We had not then recovered from the
  shock. Our ideal had fallen. A sense of loss was amongst us. Drummond,&rdquo;
  he continued, looking across at his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, &ldquo;we look
  to you to give expression to our sentiments. Your career at the bar had given
  you a command of language, also a self-control not vouchsafed to us ordinary
  mortals. Explain to Sir John our feelings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Drummond, a few years older, dark, clean-shaven, with bright eyes and
  humorous mouth, laid down his paper and turned towards Sir John. He removed
  his cigarette from his lips and waved it gently in the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Holcroft,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;in bald language, and with the
  usual limitations of his clouded intellect, has still given some slight
  expression to the consternation which I believe I may say is general amongst
  us. We looked upon you, my dear Sir John, with reverence, almost with awe.
  You represented to us the immaculate Briton, the one Englishman who typified
  the Saxonism, if I may coin a word, of our race. We have seen great and
  sober-minded men come to this unholy city, and become degenerates. We have
  known men who have come here for no other purpose than to prove their
  unassailable virtue, who have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21"
     id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>strode into the arena of temptation, waving
     the&mdash;the what is it&mdash;the white flower of a blameless life, only
     to exchange it with marvellous facility for the violets of the Parisienne.
     But you, Ferringhall, our pattern, an erstwhile Sheriff of London, a
     county magistrate, a prospective politician, a sober and an upright man,
     one who, had he aspired to it, might even have filled the glorious
     position of Lord Mayor&mdash;James, a whisky and Apollinaris at once. I
     cannot go on. My feelings overpower me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You all seem to be trying to pull my leg,&rdquo; Sir John remarked
  quietly. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll come to the point soon&mdash;if there
  is one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Drummond shook his head in melancholy fashion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He dissembles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After all, how easy the
  descent is, even for the greatest of us. I hope that James will not be long
  with that whisky and Apollinaris. My nerves are shaken. I require
  stimulant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John seated himself deliberately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should imagine,&rdquo; he said, shaking out a copy of <i>The
  Times</i>, &ldquo;that it is your brain which is addled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Drummond looked up with mock eagerness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;must be either the indifference
  of an utterly callous nature, or it may be&mdash;ye gods, it may
  be&mdash;innocence. Holcroft, we may have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think not,&rdquo; that young man remarked laconically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will put the question,&rdquo; Drummond said gravely.
  &ldquo;Ferringhall, were you or were you not dining last night at a certain
  restaurant in the Boulevard des Italiennes with&mdash;<i>la petite</i>
  Pellissier?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now indeed Sir John was moved. He sat up in his chair as though the
  question had stung him. <i>The Times</i> slipped from his fingers. His eyes
  were bright, and his voice had in it an unaccustomed <i>timbre</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I was dining last night at
  a restaurant in the Boulevard des Italiennes, and it is true that my
  companion was a young lady whose name is Pellissier. What of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a shout of laughter. Sir John looked about him, and somehow the
  laugh died away. If such a thing in connexion with him had been possible they
  would have declared that he was in a towering rage. An uncomfortable silence
  followed. Sir John once more looked around him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I repeat, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, in an ominously low tone,
  &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22"
     id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

  <p>Drummond shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be taking our little joke more seriously than it
  deserves, Ferringhall,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fail to see the joke,&rdquo; Sir John said. &ldquo;Kindly explain
  it to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly! The thing which appeals to our sense of humour is the
  fact that you and <i>la petite</i> Pellissier were dining
  together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you tell me,&rdquo; Sir John said ponderously, &ldquo;by what
  right you call that young lady&mdash;<i>la petite</i> Pellissier? I should be
  glad to know how you dare to allude to her in a public place in such a
  disrespectful manner!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Drummond looked at him and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass, Ferringhall,&rdquo; he said tersely.
  &ldquo;Annabel Pellissier is known to most of us. I myself have had the
  pleasure of dining with her. She is very charming, and we all admire her
  immensely. She sings twice a week at the &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s&rsquo; and
  the &lsquo;Casino Mavise&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John held up his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You do not even know what you are
  talking about. The young lady with whom I was dining last night was Miss Anna
  Pellissier. Miss Annabel is her sister. I know nothing of that young
  lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Drummond took up a cigarette and lit
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The young lady, I presume, told you that her name was Anna,&rdquo;
  he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was not necessary,&rdquo; Sir John answered stiffly. &ldquo;I
  was already aware of the fact. I may add that the family is well known to me.
  The two aunts of these young ladies lived for many years in the dower house
  upon my estate in Hampshire. Under the circumstances you must permit me to be
  the best judge of the identity of the young lady who did me the honour, as an
  old family friend, of dining with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Like most men who lie but seldom, he lied well. Drummond smoked his
  cigarette meditatively. He remembered that he had heard stories about the
  wonderful likeness between these two sisters, one of whom was an artist and a
  recluse, whilst the other had attached herself to a very gay and a very
  brilliant little <i>coterie</i> of pleasure-seekers. There was a bare chance
  that he had been mistaken. He thought it best to let the matter drop. A few
  minutes later Sir John left the room.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23"
     id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

  <p>He walked out into the Champs Elys&eacute;es and sat down. His cigar burnt
  out between his fingers, and he threw it impatiently away. He had seldom been
  more perturbed. He sat with folded arms and knitted brows, thinking intently.
  The girl had told him distinctly that her name was Anna. Her whole conduct
  and tone had been modest and ladylike. He went over his interview with her
  again, their conversation at dinner-time. She had behaved in every way
  perfectly. His spirits began to rise. Drummond had made an abominable
  mistake. It was not possible for him to have been deceived. He drew a little
  sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Sir John, by instinct and training, was an unimaginative person. He was a
  business man, pure and simple, his eyes were fastened always upon the
  practical side of life. Such ambitions as he had were stereotyped and
  material. Yet in some hidden corner was a vein of sentiment, of which for the
  first time in his later life he was now unexpectedly aware. He was conscious
  of a peculiar pleasure in sitting there and thinking of those few hours which
  already were becoming to assume a definite importance in his mind&mdash;a
  place curiously apart from those dry-as-dust images which had become the gods
  of his prosaic life. Somehow or other his reputation as a hardened and
  unassailable bachelor had won for him during the last few years a comparative
  immunity from attentions on the part of those women with whom he had been
  brought into contact. It was a reputation by no means deserved. A wife formed
  part of his scheme of life, for several years he had been secretly but
  assiduously looking for her. In his way he was critical. The young ladies in
  the somewhat mixed society amongst which he moved neither satisfied his taste
  nor appealed in any way to his affections. This girl whom he had met by
  chance and befriended had done both. She possessed what he affected to
  despise, but secretly worshipped&mdash;the innate charm of breeding. The
  Pellissiers had been an old family in Hampshire, while his grandfather had
  driven a van.</p>

  <p>As in all things, so his thoughts came to him deliberately. He pictured
  himself visiting the girl in this shabby little home of her
  aunt&rsquo;s&mdash;she had told him that it was shabby&mdash;and he recalled
  that delicious little smile with which she would surely greet him, a smile
  which seemed to be a matter of the eyes as well as the lips. She was poor. He
  was heartily thankful for it. He thought of his wealth for once from a
  different point of view. How much he would be able to do for her. Flowers,
  theatre <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24"
     id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>boxes, carriages, the &ldquo;open
     sesame&rdquo; to the whole world of pleasure. He himself, middle-aged,
     steeped in traditions of the City and money-making, very ill-skilled in
     all the lighter graces of life, as he himself well knew, could yet come to
     her invested with something of the halo of romance by the almost magical
     powers of an unlimited banking account. She should be lifted out of her
     narrow little life, and it should be all owing to him. And afterwards! Sir
     John drew his cigar from his lips, and looked upwards where the
     white-lights flashed strangely amongst the deep cool green of the
     lime-trees. His lips parted in a rare smile. Afterwards was the most
     delightful part of all!...</p>

  <p>If only there had not been this single torturing thought&mdash;a mere
  pin-prick, but still curiously persistent. Suddenly he stopped short. He was
  in front of one of the more imposing of the <i>caf&eacute;s
  chantants</i>&mdash;opposite, illuminated with a whole row of lights, was the
  wonderful poster which had helped to make &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; famous. He had
  looked at it before without comprehension. To-night the subtle suggestiveness
  of those few daring lines, fascinating in their very simplicity, the head
  thrown back, the half-closed eyes&mdash;the inner meaning of the great artist
  seemed to come to him with a rush. He stood still, almost breathless. A slow
  anger burned in the man. It was debauching, this&mdash;a devilish art which
  drew such strange allurements from a face and figure almost Madonna-like in
  their simplicity. Unwillingly he drew a little nearer, and became one of the
  group of loiterers about the entrance. A woman touched him lightly on the
  arm, and smiled into his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur admires the poster?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As a rule Sir John treated such advances with cold silence. This woman,
  contrary to his custom, he answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is hateful&mdash;diabolical!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a great art,&rdquo; she said in broken English. &ldquo;The
  little English girl is very fortunate. For what indeed does she do? A simple
  song, no gesture, no acting, nothing. And they pay her. Monsieur is going
  inside perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Sir John&rsquo;s eyes were still riveted upon the poster, and his
  heart was beating with unaccustomed force. For just as though a vague
  likeness is sometimes borne swiftly in upon one, so a vague dissimilarity
  between the face on the poster and the heroine of his thoughts had slowly
  crept into his consciousness. He drew a little breath and stepped back. After
  all, he had the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25"
     id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>means of setting this tormenting doubt at
     rest. She had mentioned the address where she and her sister had lived. He
     would go there. He would see this sister. He would know the truth then
     once and for all. He walked hastily to the side of the broad pavement and
     summoned a <i>fiacre</i>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_IV"
     id="Chapter_IV"></a><i>Chapter IV</i></h2>

  <h3>THE TEMPERAMENT OF AN ARTIST</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;You may sit there and smoke, and look out upon your wonderful
  Paris,&rdquo; Anna said lightly. &ldquo;You may talk&mdash;if you can talk
  cheerfully, not unless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; asked David Courtlaw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if I find your conversation interesting I shall listen. If
  not, I have plenty to think about,&rdquo; she answered, leaning back in her
  chair, and watching the smoke from her own cigarette curl upwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How I am to earn enough <i>sous</i> for my dinner
  to-morrow&mdash;or failing that, what I can sell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face darkened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you bid me talk cheerfully, or not
  at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Your spirits at least should be good. It is not you who
  runs the risk of going dinnerless to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned upon her almost fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;you know quite well that your
  troubles are far more likely to weigh upon me than my own. Do you think that
  I am utterly selfish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Troubles, my friend,&rdquo; she exclaimed lightly. &ldquo;But I
  have no troubles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stared at her incredulously, and she laughed very softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a gloomy person you are!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You call
  yourself an artist&mdash;but you have no temperament. The material cares of
  life hang about your neck like a millstone. A doubt as to your dinner
  to-morrow would make you miserable to-night. You know I call that positively
  wicked. It is not at all what I expected either. On the whole, I think that I
  have been disappointed with the life here. There is so little <i>abandon</i>,
  so little real joyousness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;one of the greatest of our
  writers has declared that the true spirit of Bohemianism is denied to your
  sex.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27"
     id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was probably right,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Bohemianism is
  the least understood word ever coined. I do not think that I have the
  Bohemian spirit at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully. She wore a plain black dress, reaching
  almost to her throat&mdash;her small oval face, with the large brown eyes,
  was colourless, delicately expressive, yet with something mysterious in its
  Sphinx-like immobility. A woman hard to read, who seemed to delight in
  keeping locked up behind that fascinating rigidity of feature the intense
  sensibility which had been revealed to him, her master, only in occasional
  and rare moments of enthusiasm. She reminded him sometimes of the one holy
  and ineffable Madonna, at others of Berode, the great courtezan of her day,
  who had sent kings away from her doors, and had just announced her intention
  of ending her life in a convent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe that you are right,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;It is
  the worst of including in our vocabulary words which have no definite
  meaning, perhaps I should say of which the meaning varies according to
  one&rsquo;s personal point of view. You, for instance, you live, you are not
  afraid to live. Yet you make our Bohemianism seem like a vulgar
  thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stirred gently in her chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have been your pupil for two
  years. You have watched all the uncouth creations of my brain come sprawling
  out upon the canvas, and besides, we have been companions. Yet the fact
  remains that you do not understand me at all. No, not one little bit. It is
  extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the one humiliation of my life. My
  opportunities have been immense, and my failure utter. If I had been your
  companion only, and not your master, I might very well have been content to
  accept you for what you seem. But there have been times, Anna, when your work
  has startled me. Ill-drawn, without method or sense of proportion, you have
  put wonderful things on to canvas, have drawn them out of yourself,
  notwithstanding your mechanical inefficiency. God knows how you did it. You
  are utterly baffling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed at him easily and mirthfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do not magnify me into a
  physiological problem. I should only disappoint you terribly some day. I
  think I know where I am puzzling you now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be merciful,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
  &ldquo;Lift up one corner of the curtain for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. You shall tell me if I am wrong. You see me <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_28"
     id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>here, an admitted failure in the object to
     which I have devoted two years of my life. You know that I am practically
     destitute, without means or any certain knowledge of where my next meal is
     coming from. I speak frankly, because you also know that no possible
     extremity would induce me to accept help from any living person. You
     notice that I have recently spent ten francs on a box of the best Russian
     cigarettes, and that there are roses upon my table. You observe that I am,
     as usual, fairly cheerful, and moderately amiable. It surprises you. You
     do not understand, and you would like to. Very well! I will try to help
     you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her hand hung over the side of her chair nearest to him. He looked at it
  eagerly, but made no movement to take it. During all their long comradeship
  he had never so much as ventured to hold her fingers. This was David
  Courtlaw, whose ways, too, had never been very different from the ways of
  other men as regards her sex.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, it comes after all,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;from
  certain original convictions which have become my religion. Rather a
  magniloquent term, perhaps, but what else am I to say? One of these is that
  the most absolutely selfish thing in the world is to give way to depression,
  to think of one&rsquo;s troubles at all except of how to overcome them. I
  spend many delightful hours thinking of the pleasant and beautiful things of
  life. I decline to waste a single second even in considering the ugly ones.
  Do you know that this becomes a habit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you would only teach us all,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;how to
  acquire it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose people would say that it is a matter of
  temperament,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;With me I believe that it is more.
  It has become a part of the order of my life. Whatever may happen to-morrow I
  shall be none the better for anticipating its miseries to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, a trifle irrelevantly, &ldquo;what the
  future has in store for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that not rather a profitless speculation, my friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He seemed deaf to her interruption. His grey eyes burned under his shaggy
  eyebrows. He leaned towards her as though anxious to see more of her face
  than that faint delicate profile gleaming like marble in the uncertain
  light.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were born for great things,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;For
  great passions, for great accomplishments. Will you find your destiny, I
  wonder, or will you go through life like so many others&mdash;a <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_29"
     id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>wanderer, knocking ever at empty doors,
     homeless to the last? Oh, if one could but find the way to your
     heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;remember that you are speaking
  to one who has failed in the only serious object which she has ever sought to
  accomplish. My destiny, I am afraid, is going to lead me into the
  ruts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were never born,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;to follow the well
  worn roads. I wonder,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
  &ldquo;whether you ever realize how young you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young? I am twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet you are very young. Anna, why will you persist in this
  single-handed combat with life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I must, I will,&rdquo; he answered fiercely. &ldquo;Oh, I know
  you would stop me if you could. This time you cannot. You are the woman I
  love, Anna. Let me make your future for you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid that I
  shall stunt it. I will give you a broad free life. You shall have room to
  develop, you shall live as you will, where you will, only give me the right
  to protect you, to free you from all these petty material cares.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laid her hand softly upon his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you not think that you are
  breaking an unspoken compact? I am very sorry. In your heart you know quite
  well that all that you have said is useless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he repeated, looking away from her.
  &ldquo;Useless&mdash;worse than useless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are foolish,&rdquo; she declared, with a note of irritability
  in her tone. &ldquo;You would appear to be trying to destroy a comradeship
  which has been very, very pleasant. For you know that I have made up my mind
  to dig a little way into life single-handed. I, too, want to
  understand&mdash;to walk with my head in the light. Love is a great thing,
  and happiness a joy. Let me go my own way towards them. We may meet&mdash;who
  can tell? But I will not be fettered, even though you would make the chains
  of roses. Listen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped short. There was a sharp knocking at the outside door.
  Courtlaw rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is too late for visitors,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I wonder
  would you mind seeing who it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw crossed the room and threw open the door. He had come to
  Anna&rsquo;s rooms from a dinner party, and he was in evening <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_30"
     id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>dress. Sir John, who was standing outside,
     looked past him at the girl still sitting in the shadow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;that these are the
  apartments of Miss Pellissier. I must apologize for disturbing you at such an
  unseemly hour, but I should be very much obliged if Miss Pellissier would
  allow me a few minutes&rsquo; conversation. My name is Ferringhall&mdash;Sir
  John Ferringhall.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_V"
     id="Chapter_V"></a><i>Chapter V</i></h2>

  <h3>&ldquo;ALCIDE&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>Courtlaw took up his hat and coat at once, but Anna motioned him to
  remain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please stay,&rdquo; she said briefly. &ldquo;Will you come in, Sir
  John. I believe that I have heard my sister speak of you. This is my friend,
  Mr. David Courtlaw&mdash;Sir John Ferringhall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John acknowledged the introduction without cordiality. He entered the
  room with his usual deliberation, and looked covertly about him. He noticed
  the two chairs close together. Anna was still holding her cigarette between
  her fingers. Her likeness to her sister gave him at first almost a shock; a
  moment afterwards he was conscious of a wonderful sense of relief. For if the
  likeness between the sisters was remarkable, the likeness between this girl
  and the poster which he had come from studying was more remarkable still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must repeat,&rdquo; Sir John said, &ldquo;that I much regret
  disturbing you at such an unseemly hour. My only excuse is that I missed my
  way here, and I am leaving Paris early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If your business with me is of any importance,&rdquo; Anna said
  calmly, &ldquo;it does not matter in the least about the hour. Have you
  brought me a message from my sister? I understood, I believe, that she was
  seeing you last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your sister,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;did me the honour of dining
  with me last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After all, it was not so easy. The girl&rsquo;s eyes never left his face.
  She was civil, but she was obviously impatient to know his errand. Afraid, no
  doubt, he thought grimly, that her other visitor would leave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that I shall do best to
  throw myself upon your consideration and tell you the truth. I have recently
  made your sister&rsquo;s acquaintance, and in the course of conversation I
  understood from her that her Christian name was Anna. Some friends who saw us
  dining together persist in alluding to her as Miss Annabel Pellissier. I am
  guilty practically <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32"
     id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>of the impertinence of coming to ask you
     whether I misunderstood your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is my sister&rsquo;s Christian name, then, of so much importance to
  you?&rdquo; she asked with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The things involved in it are,&rdquo; he answered gravely.</p>

  <p>She accepted his rejoinder with a brief nod. Courtlaw opened his lips, but
  remained silent in the face of her imperative gesture. &ldquo;Let me
  hasten,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to reassure you. My sister was scarcely
  likely to make a mistake. She told you&mdash;the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw&rsquo;s walking stick, which he had been handling, fell with a
  crash to the ground. He stooped to recover it, and his face was hidden. Sir
  John felt and looked several years younger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Really, I do not
  know why I should have doubted it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she remarked tersely.</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a certain curiosity. She was a very elegant young
  woman, slightly taller perhaps than her sister, and with an air of reserved
  strength underneath her quiet face and manner which Annabel may have lacked.
  It was hard to associate her with the stories which he and all Paris had
  heard of &ldquo;Alcide.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; That
  wonderful poster&mdash;is of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She lifted her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you find the likeness
  unsatisfactory. My friends consider it wonderfully faithful. Have you any
  more questions to ask me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John, on his way down, had determined to hint to this young woman
  that, providing certain contingencies which he had in his mind should come to
  pass, he would be prepared to make her a handsome offer to change her name.
  He found, however, that now the time had come he utterly lacked the courage
  to attempt any such speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, I thank you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I will not intrude
  upon you further.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>He turned back at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have answered all your questions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps
  you will not object to answering one for me. You have thought it worth while
  to take some considerable pains to resolve for yourself my sister&rsquo;s
  identity. May I ask the nature of your interest in her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33"
     id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not an easy matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for me to offer
  you an altogether adequate explanation. I have only seen your sister for a
  very brief time, and I am a little past the age when a man does headstrong
  things. At the same time, I must say that I am most anxious to improve my
  acquaintance with her. I am a single man, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I will not ask you to
  explain further. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He left at once, immensely relieved, yet scarcely satisfied with himself
  as regarded his share of the interview with this young woman. They heard his
  footsteps descending the stone staircase, growing fainter and fainter. Then
  Courtlaw looked across at her with a white puzzled face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why did you lie to that man?&rdquo; he asked fiercely. &ldquo;How
  dared you do yourself this injustice?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did it for her sake,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It may be her
  salvation. I believe that he will marry her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would let him&mdash;knowing&mdash;all that you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? She is my flesh and blood. She is more dear to me than
  anything else. Perhaps if I had watched over her more closely, things would
  have been different.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You! Why, you have been an angel to her,&rdquo; he exclaimed
  impatiently. &ldquo;You know very well that she is selfish and
  pleasure-loving to the backbone. You have made enough sacrifices for her
  surely without this. Besides, you cannot tell where it will end. You have
  taken upon your shoulders the burden of her misdeeds. You may have to carry
  them further and longer than you think. Oh, it is unbearable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man&rsquo;s face was dark with passion. It was as though he were
  personally aggrieved. His tone was rough, almost threatening. The girl only
  smiled at him serenely, but she laid her hand for a moment quietly upon
  his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is a matter which you
  must leave to me to do as I think best. Annabel is my only sister, you know,
  almost my only relative. If I do not look after her, she has no one. And she
  is very young, younger than her years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was significant of her influence over him that he answered her calmly,
  although a storm of angry thoughts were struggling for expression within
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look after her! Why not? But you have done it all your life. You
  have been her guardian angel. But even you cannot alter her character.
  Annabel was born soulless, a human butterfly, if ever there was one. The
  pursuit of pleasure, self-gratification, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_34"
     id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>is an original instinct with her. Blood and
     bone, body and spirit, she is selfish through and through. Even you have
     not been able to hold her back. I speak no harm of her. She is your
     sister, and God knows I wish her none. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A look checked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;that Paris, where she has
  been so much admired, is not a good place for her. That is why I am glad that
  she has gone to London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair, and walked restlessly up and down the room. The
  passion of pent-up speech compelled action of some sort. There was a black
  fear in his heart. He stopped before her suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, too,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;You mean to follow her.
  You will go to London?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You yourself have
  decided that&mdash;apart from the question of Annabel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was suddenly calm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is part of the irony of life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One is
  always playing the surgeon, one kills always the thing one loves best. I
  meant to lie to you. Would to God I had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The surgeon&rsquo;s knife is surely a kindly weapon,&rdquo; she
  declared. &ldquo;It was best for me to know. Later on I could scarcely have
  forgiven you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;I am to lose you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For a little time,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I meant to say good-
  bye to you to-night. Or, after all, is it worth while? The Channel is a
  little broader than the Boulevards&mdash;but one crosses it
  sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her with white, set face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall come. That is very certain.
  But, after all, it will be different. I think that I have become a drug
  drinker. I need you every day. In the mornings I find labour easy because I
  am going to see you. In the afternoon my brain and fingers leap to their work
  because you have been with me. Anna, you shall not go. I cannot let you
  go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She threw away the end of her cigarette. Without turning or looking in his
  direction she leaned forwards, her head supported upon her fingers, her
  elbows upon her knees. She gazed steadily out of the window at that arc of
  glittering lights. He made a quick movement towards her, but she did not
  flinch. His arm fell to his side. The effort of self-repression cost him a
  sob.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are not a coward, are
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35"
     id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The bravest of us have
  joints in our armour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not a coward,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;or you would not
  be my friend. A woman may choose any one for her lover, but for her friend
  she makes no mistake. You are not a coward David, and you must not talk like
  one. Put out your hand and bid me God-speed. It is the only way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do it!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;I cannot part with
  you. You have grown into my life. Anna&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again she stopped him, but this time it was not so easy. The man&rsquo;s
  passion became almost unbearable at the thought of losing her. And yet, as
  she rose slowly to her feet and stood looking at him with outstretched hands,
  a strange mixture of expressions shining in her wonderful eyes, he realized
  in some measure the strength of her determination, felt the utter impotence
  of anything which he could say to her. He forgot for the moment his own
  self-pity, the egotism of his own passionate love. He took her hands firmly
  in his and raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall go,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I will make of the days
  and weeks one long morning, but remember the afternoon must come. Always
  remember that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her hands fell to her side. She remained for a few moments standing as
  though listening to his retreating footsteps. Then she turned, and entering
  the inner room, commenced to dress hastily for the street.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_VI"
     id="Chapter_VI"></a><i>Chapter VI</i></h2>

  <h3>A QUESTION OF IDENTIFICATION</h3>

  <p>The little man with the closely-cropped beard and hair looked at her
  keenly through his gold eye-glasses. He sat before a desk littered all over
  with papers and official looking documents. The walls of the room were lined
  with shelves, on which were glass jars, retorts, countless bottles and many
  appliances of surgical science. A skeleton was propped against the
  mantelpiece. The atmosphere seemed heavy with the odour of drugs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are Mademoiselle Pellissier?&rdquo; he asked, without rising to
  his feet.</p>

  <p>Anna admitted the fact.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We sent for you several hours ago,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came directly I was disengaged,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;In
  any case, there is probably some mistake. I have very few friends in
  Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He referred to a sheet of paper by his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your name and address were upon an envelope found in the pocket of
  an Englishman who was brought here late last night suffering from serious
  injuries,&rdquo; he said in a dry official tone. &ldquo;As it is doubtful
  whether the man will live, we should be glad if you would identify
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is most unlikely that I shall be able to do so,&rdquo; Anna
  answered. &ldquo;To the best of my belief, I have not a single English
  acquaintance in the city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; the official said irritably, &ldquo;this
  man would not have your name and address in his pocket without an object. You
  cannot tell whether you know him or not until you have seen him. Be so good
  as to come this way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a little shrug of the shoulders Anna followed him. They ascended by a
  lift to one of the upper floors, passed through a long ward, and finally came
  to a bed in the extreme corner, round which a screen had been arranged. A
  nurse came hurrying up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is quiet only this minute,&rdquo; she said to the official.
  &ldquo;All the time he is shouting and muttering. If this is the young lady,
  she can perhaps calm him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37"
     id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

  <p>Anna stepped to the foot of the bed. An electric light flashed out from
  the wall. The face of the man who lay there was clearly visible. Anna merely
  glanced at the coarse, flushed features, and at once shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have never seen him in my life,&rdquo; she said to the official.
  &ldquo;I have not the least idea who he is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Just then the man&rsquo;s eyes opened. He saw the girl, and sprang up in
  bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel at last,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Where have you been? All
  these hours I have been calling for you. Annabel, I was lying. Who says that
  I am not Meysey Hill? I was trying to scare you. See, it is on my
  cards&mdash;M. Hill, Meysey Hill. Don&rsquo;t touch the handle, Annabel!
  Curse the thing, you&rsquo;ve jammed it now. Do you want to kill us both?
  Stop the thing. Stop it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br />

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203111h-images/Anna3.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration" />
  </div>

  <p>Anna stepped back bewildered, but the man held out his arms to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you it was a lie!&rdquo; he shouted wildly.
  &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you believe me? I am Meysey Hill. I am the richest man in
  England. I am the richest man in the world. You love money. You know you do,
  Annabel. Never mind, I&rsquo;ve got plenty. We&rsquo;ll go to the shops.
  Diamonds! You shall have all that you can carry away, sacks full if you like.
  Pearls too! I mean it. I tell you I&rsquo;m Meysey Hill, the railway man.
  Don&rsquo;t leave me. Don&rsquo;t leave me in this beastly thing. Annabel!
  Annabel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His voice became a shriek. In response to an almost imperative gesture
  from the nurse, Anna laid her hand upon his. He fell back upon the pillows
  with a little moan, clutching the slim white fingers fiercely. In a moment
  his grasp grew weaker. The perspiration stood out upon his forehead. His eyes
  closed.</p>

  <p>Anna stepped back at once with a little gasp of relief. The hand which the
  man had been holding hung limp and nerveless at her side. She held it away
  from her with an instinctive repulsion, born of her unconquerable antipathy
  to the touch of strangers. She began rubbing it with her pocket-handkerchief.
  The man himself was not a pleasant object. Part of his head was swathed in
  linen bandages. Such of his features as were visible were of coarse mould.
  His eyes were set too close together. Anna turned deliberately away from the
  bedside. She followed the official back into his room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked her tersely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can only repeat what I said before,&rdquo; she declared.
  &ldquo;To the best of my belief, I have never seen the man in my
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he recognized you,&rdquo; the official objected.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38"
     id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;He fancied that he did,&rdquo; she corrected him coolly. &ldquo;I
  suppose delusions are not uncommon to patients in his condition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The official frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your name and address in his pocket was no delusion,&rdquo; he said
  sharply. &ldquo;I do not wish to make impertinent inquiries into your private
  life. Nothing is of any concern of ours except the discovery of the
  man&rsquo;s identity. He was picked up from amongst the wreckage of a broken
  motor on the road to Versailles last night, and we have information that a
  lady was with him only a few minutes before the accident occurred.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very unbelieving,&rdquo; Anna said coldly. &ldquo;I hope
  you will not compel me to say again that I do not know the man&rsquo;s name,
  nor, to the best of my belief, have I ever seen him before in my
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The official shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You decline to help us in any way, then,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Remember that the man will probably die. He had little money about
  him, and unless friends come to his aid he must be treated as a
  pauper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not wish to seem unfeeling,&rdquo; Anna said, slowly,
  &ldquo;but I can only repeat that I am absolutely without concern in the
  matter. The man is a stranger to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The official had no more to say. Only it was with a further and most
  unbelieving shrug of the shoulders that he resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will be so good as to leave us your correct name and address,
  mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have them both,&rdquo; Anna answered.</p>

  <p>He opened the door for her with a faint disagreeable smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is possible, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this
  affair is not yet ended. It may bring us together again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She passed out without reply. Yet she took with her an uneasy
  consciousness that in this affair might lie the germs of future trouble.</p>

  <p>As she crossed the square, almost within a stone&rsquo;s throw of her
  lodgings, she came face to face with Courtlaw. He stopped short with a little
  exclamation of surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;not so tragic, if you
  please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He recovered himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was surprised, I admit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You did not tell
  me that you were going out, or I would have offered my escort. Do you know
  how late it is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39"
     id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard the clock strike as I crossed the square,&rdquo; she
  answered. &ldquo;I was sent for to go to the Hospital St. Denis. But what are
  you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old P&egrave;re Runeval met me on your doorstep, and he would not
  let me go. I have been sitting with him ever since. The Hospital St. Denis,
  did you say? I hope that no one of our friends has met with an
  accident.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They wanted me to identify some one whom I had certainly never seen
  before in my life, and to tell you the truth, they were positively rude to me
  because I could not. Have you ever heard the name of Meysey Hill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meysey Hill?&rdquo; He repeated it after her, and she knew at once
  from his tone and his quick glance into her face that the name possessed some
  significance for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard of him, and I know him by sight,&rdquo; he
  admitted. &ldquo;He was a friend of your sister&rsquo;s, was he
  not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never heard her mention his name,&rdquo; she answered.
  &ldquo;Still, of course, it is possible. This man was apparently not sure
  whether he was Meysey Hill or not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long had he been in the hospital?&rdquo; Courtlaw asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, whoever he may be, he is not Meysey Hill,&rdquo; Courtlaw
  said. &ldquo;That young man was giving a luncheon party to a dozen friends at
  the Caf&eacute; de Paris to-day. I sat within a few feet of him. I feel
  almost inclined to regret the fact.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If one half of the stories about Meysey Hill are true,&rdquo; he
  answered, &ldquo;I would not stretch out my little finger to save his
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a little extreme?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am an extreme person at times. This man has an evil reputation. I
  know of scandalous deeds which he has done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna had reached the house where she lodged, but she hesitated on the
  doorstep.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen Annabel with him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is odd that this man at the hospital should call himself Meysey
  Hill,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will go there in the morning
  and see what can be done for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be very kind of you,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I am only
  sorry that I did not ask you to go with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40"
     id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

  <p>She rang the bell, and he waited by her side until she was admitted to the
  tall, gloomy lodging-house. And ever after it struck him that her backward
  smile as she disappeared was charged with some special significance. The door
  closed upon her, and he moved reluctantly away. When next he asked for her,
  some twelve hours later, he was told that Mademoiselle had left. His most
  eager inquiries and most lavish bribes could gain no further information than
  that she had left for England, and that her address was&mdash;London.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_VII"
     id="Chapter_VII"></a><i>Chapter VII</i></h2>

  <h3>MISS PELLISSIER&rsquo;S SUSPICIONS</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna kissed her sister and nodded to her aunt. Then she sat
  down&mdash;uninvited&mdash;and looked from one to the other curiously. There
  was something about their greeting and the tone of Annabel&rsquo;s
  exclamation which puzzled her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you would leave off looking at
  me as though I were something grisly. I am your very dutiful niece, aunt, and
  your most devoted sister, Annabel. I haven&rsquo;t murdered any one, or
  broken the law in any way that I know of. Perhaps you will explain the state
  of panic into which I seem to have thrown you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel, who was looking very well, and who was most becomingly dressed,
  moved to a seat from which she could command a view of the road outside. She
  was the first to recover herself. Her aunt, a faded, an&aelig;mic-looking
  lady of somewhat too obtrusive gentility, was still sitting with her hand
  pressed to her heart.</p>

  <p>Annabel looked up and down the empty street, and then turned to her
  sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For one thing, Anna,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;we had not the
  slightest idea that you had left, or were leaving Paris. You did not say a
  word about it last week, nor have you written. It is quite a descent from the
  clouds, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will accept that,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;as accounting for the
  surprise. Perhaps you will now explain the alarm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Pellissier was beginning to recover herself. She too at once
  developed an anxious interest in the street outside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure, Anna,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not see why we should
  conceal the truth from you. We are expecting a visit from Sir John
  Ferringhall at any moment. He is coming here to tea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Anna remarked calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; her aunt repeated, with thin emphasis, &ldquo;is
  coming to see your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna drummed impatiently with her fingers against the arm of her
  chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she declared good-humouredly. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t
  eat him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42"
     id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

  <p>Miss Pellissier stiffened visibly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is not a matter altogether for levity, Anna,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Your sister&rsquo;s future is at stake. I imagine that even you must
  realize that this is of some importance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna glanced towards her sister, but the latter avoided her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have always,&rdquo; she admitted calmly, &ldquo;taken a certain
  amount of interest in Annabel&rsquo;s future. I should like to know how it is
  concerned with Sir John Ferringhall, and how my presence
  intervenes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; Miss Pellissier said impressively, &ldquo;has
  asked your sister to be his wife. It is a most wonderful piece of good
  fortune, as I suppose you will be prepared to admit. The Ferringhalls are of
  course without any pretence at family, but Sir John is a very rich man, and
  will be able to give Annabel a very enviable position in the world. The
  settlements which he has spoken of, too, are most munificent. No wonder we
  are anxious that nothing should happen to make him change his
  mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna stopped short. Suddenly she understood. She grew perhaps a shade
  paler, and she glanced out into the street, where her four-wheeler cab, laden
  with luggage, was still waiting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John of course disapproves of me,&rdquo; she remarked
  slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John is a man of the world,&rdquo; her aunt answered coldly.
  &ldquo;He naturally does not wish for connexions which are&mdash;I do not
  wish to hurt you feelings, Anna, but I must say it&mdash;not altogether
  desirable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The irrepressible smile curved Anna&rsquo;s lips. She glanced towards her
  sister, and curiously enough found in her face some faint reflection of her
  own rather sombre mirth. She leaned back in her chair. It was no use. The
  smile had become a laugh. She laughed till the tears stood in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had a visit from Sir John in my rooms,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Did he tell you, Annabel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He mentioned the matter to me also,&rdquo; Miss Pellissier remarked
  stiffly. &ldquo;The visit seems to have made a most painful impression upon
  him. To tell you the truth, he spoke to me very seriously upon the
  subject.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna sprang up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will be off,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;My cab with all that
  luggage would give the whole show away. Good-bye, aunt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Pellissier tried ineffectually to conceal her relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not like to seem inhospitable, Anna,&rdquo; she said
  hesitatingly. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
     id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>&ldquo;And of course you are my niece just
     as Annabel is, although I am sorry to learn that your conduct has been
     much less discreet than hers. But at the same time, I must say plainly
     that I think your presence here just now would be a great misfortune. I
     wish very much that you had written before leaving Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I ought to have done. Good-bye
  aunt. I&rsquo;ll come and see you again later on. Annabel, come to the door
  with me,&rdquo; she added a little abruptly. &ldquo;There is something which
  I must say to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel rose and followed her sister from the room. A maidservant held the
  front door open. Anna sent her away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel,&rdquo; she said brusquely. &ldquo;Listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John came to me&mdash;that you know&mdash;and you can guess
  what I told him. No, never mind about thanking me. I want to ask you a plain
  question, and you must answer me faithfully. Is all that folly done
  with&mdash;for ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel shivered ever so slightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is, Anna. You ought to know that. I am going to make a
  fresh start.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be very sure that you do,&rdquo; Anna said slowly. &ldquo;If I
  thought for a moment that there was any chance of a relapse, I should stop
  here and tell him the truth even now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel looked at her with terrified eyes.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br />

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203111h-images/Anna4.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration" />
  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you must believe me. I am really in
  earnest. I would not have him know&mdash;now&mdash;for the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;I will believe you. Remember
  that he&rsquo;s not at all a bad sort, and to speak frankly, he&rsquo;s your
  salvation. Try and let him never regret it. There&rsquo;s plenty to be got
  out of life in a decent sort of way. Be a good wife to him. You can if you
  will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Annabel declared. &ldquo;He is very kind, Anna,
  really, and not half such a prig as he seems.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna moved towards the door, but her sister detained her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me why you have come to England?&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;It was such a surprise to see you. I thought that you loved
  Paris and your work so much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A momentary bitterness crept into Anna&rsquo;s tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have made no progress with my work,&rdquo; she said slowly,
  &ldquo;and the money was gone. I had to ask Mr. Courtlaw for his true
  verdict, and he gave it me. I have given up painting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44"
     id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is true, dear. After all there are other things. All that I
  regret are the wasted years, and I am not sure that I regret them. Only of
  course I must begin something else at once. That is why I came to
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do&mdash;where are you going to
  live?&rdquo; Annabel asked. &ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lots,&rdquo; Anna answered laconically. &ldquo;Never mind me. I
  always fall on my feet, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will let us hear from you&mdash;let us know where you are, very
  soon?&rdquo; Annabel called out from the step.</p>

  <p>Anna nodded as she briskly crossed the pavement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Run in now. There&rsquo;s a
  hansom coming round the corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>Anna sat back in her cab, but found it remain stationary.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; she exclaimed to herself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  know where to go to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cabman, knocking with the butt end of his whip upon the window,
  reminded her that he was in a similar predicament.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drive towards St. Pancras,&rdquo; she directed, promptly. &ldquo;I
  will tell you when to stop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cab rumbled off. Anna leaned forward, watching the people in the
  streets. It was then for the first time she remembered that she had said
  nothing to her sister of the man in the hospital.</p>

     id="Chapter_VIII"></a><i>Chapter VIII</i></h2>

  <h3>&ldquo;WHITE&rsquo;S&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>Northwards, away from the inhospitality of West Kensington, rumbled the
  ancient four-wheel cab, laden with luggage and drawn by a wheezy old horse
  rapidly approaching its last days. Inside was Anna, leaning a little forward
  to watch the passers-by, bright-eyed, full to the brim of the insatiable
  curiosity of youth&mdash;the desire to understand and appreciate this new
  world in which she found herself. She was practically an outcast, she had not
  even the ghost of a plan as to her future, and she had something less than
  five pounds in her pocket. She watched the people and hummed softly to
  herself.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she thrust her head out of the window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please stop, cabman,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>

  <p>The man pulled up. It was not a difficult affair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this Montague Street, W.C.?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>The man looked as though he would have liked to deny it, but could
  not.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay where you are for a moment,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;I want
  to find an address.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man contented himself with a nod. Anna rummaged about in her
  dressing-case, and finally drew out a letter. On the envelope was
  written&mdash;</p>

  <p class="right">Sydney Courtlaw, Esq.,</p>

  <p class="right2">13, Montague St.</p>

  <p>She put her head out of the window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Number 13, please, cabman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come past it, miss,&rdquo; the man answered, with a
  note of finality in his gruff voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then turn round and go back there,&rdquo; she directed.</p>

  <p>The man muttered something inaudible, and gathered up the reins. His
  horse, which had apparently gone to sleep, preferred to remain where he was.
  After a certain amount of man&oelig;uvring, however, he was induced to crawl
  around, and in a few minutes came to stop again before a tall
  brightly-painted house, which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46"
     id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>seemed like an oasis of colour and
     assertive prosperity in a long dingy row. This was number 13, Montague
     Street, familiarly spoken of in the neighbourhood as
     &ldquo;White&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna promptly alighted with the letter in her hand. The door was opened
  for her by a weary-looking youth in a striped jacket several sizes too large
  for him. The rest of his attire was nondescript.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Courtlaw, Mr. Sydney Courtlaw, live here, please?&rdquo;
  Anna asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not home yet, miss,&rdquo; the young man replied. &ldquo;Generally
  gets here about seven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna hesitated, and then held out the letter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think that I will leave this letter for him,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;It is from his brother in Paris. Say that I will call again or let him
  know my address in London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man accepted the letter and the message, and seemed about to
  close the door when a lady issued from one of the front rooms and intervened.
  She wore a black satin dress, a little shiny at the seams, a purposeless bow
  of white tulle at the back of her neck, and a huge chatelaine. She addressed
  Anna with a beaming smile and a very creditable mixture of condescension and
  officiousness. Under the somewhat trying incandescent light her cheeks
  pleaded guilty to a recent use of the powder puff.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think that you were inquiring for Mr. Courtlaw,&rdquo; she
  remarked. &ldquo;He is one of our guests&mdash;perhaps I should say boarders
  here, but he seldom returns before dinner-time. We dine at seven-thirty. Can
  I give him any message for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I have a letter for him
  from his brother, which I was just leaving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will see that he gets it immediately on his return,&rdquo; the
  lady promised. &ldquo;You did not wish to see him particularly this evening,
  then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;To tell you the truth though,
  I am quite a stranger in London, and it occurred to me that Mr. Courtlaw
  might have been able to give me an idea where to stop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lady in black satin looked at the pile of luggage outside and
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were you thinking of private apartments, a boarding-house or an
  hotel?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47"
     id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really had not thought about it at all,&rdquo; Anna answered
  smiling. &ldquo;I expected to stay with a relation, but I found that their
  arrangements did not allow of it. I have been used to living in apartments in
  Paris, but I suppose the system is different here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lady in black satin appeared undecided. She looked from Anna, who was
  far too nice-looking to be travelling about alone, to that reassuring pile of
  luggage, and wrinkled her brows thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said diffidently, &ldquo;this is a boarding-
  house, although we never take in promiscuous travellers. The class of guests
  we have are all permanent, and I am obliged to be very careful indeed.
  But&mdash;if you are a friend of Mr. Courtlaw&rsquo;s&mdash;I should like to
  oblige Mr. Courtlaw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very nice of you to think of it,&rdquo; Anna said briskly.
  &ldquo;I should really like to find somewhere to stay, if it was only for a
  few nights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lady stood away from the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you come this way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;into the drawing-
  room? There is no one there just now. Most of my people are upstairs dressing
  for dinner. The gentlemen are so particular now, and a good thing too, I say.
  I was always used to it, and I think it gives quite a tone to an
  establishment. Please sit down, Miss&mdash;dear me, I haven&rsquo;t asked you
  your name yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is Pellissier,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;Anna
  Pellissier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. White,&rdquo; the lady in black satin remarked. &ldquo;It
  makes one feel quite awkward to mention such a thing, but after all I think
  that it is best for both parties. Could you give me any
  references?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is Mr. Courtlaw,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;and my solicitors,
  Messrs. Le Mercier and Stowe of St. Heliers. They are rather a long way off,
  but you could write to them. I am sorry that I do not know any one in London.
  But after all, Mrs. White, I am not sure that I could afford to come to you.
  I am shockingly poor. Please tell me what your terms are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mrs. White said slowly, &ldquo;it depends a good deal
  upon what rooms you have. Just now my best ones are all taken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; Anna declared cheerfully. &ldquo;The
  smallest will do for me quite well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. White looked mysteriously about the room as though to be sure that no
  one was listening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like you to come here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a great deal <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48"
     id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>for a young lady who&rsquo;s alone in the
     world, as I suppose you are at present, to have a respectable home, and I
     do not think in such a case that private apartments are at all desirable.
     We have a very nice set of young people here too just at present, and you
     would soon make some friends. I will take you for thirty-five shillings a
     week. Please don&rsquo;t let any one know that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no idea what it costs to live in London,&rdquo; Anna said,
  &ldquo;but I should like very much to come for a short time if I
  might.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mrs. White said. &ldquo;Two days&rsquo; notice
  shall be sufficient on either side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I may bring my luggage in and send that cabman away?&rdquo;
  Anna asked. &ldquo;Dear me, what a relief! If I had had any nerves that man
  would have trampled upon them long ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cabmen are so trying,&rdquo; Mrs. White assented. &ldquo;You need
  have no further trouble. The manservant shall bring your trunks in and pay
  the fare too, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna drew out her purse at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are really a good Samaritan,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I am
  perfectly certain that that man meant to be rude to me. He has been bottling
  it up all the way from West Kensington.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. White rang the bell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come upstairs,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I will show you your
  room. And would you mind hurrying a little. You won&rsquo;t want to be late
  the first evening, and it&rsquo;s ten minutes past seven now. Gracious,
  there&rsquo;s the gong. This way, my dear&mdash;and&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse
  my mentioning it, but a quiet blouse and a little chiffon, you know, will be
  quite sufficient. It&rsquo;s your first evening, and early impressions do
  count for so much. You understand me, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna was a little puzzled, but she only laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps, as I&rsquo;ve only just arrived,&rdquo; she remarked,
  &ldquo;I might be forgiven if I do not change my skirt. I packed so hurriedly
  that it will take me a long time to find my things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mrs. White assured her. &ldquo;Certainly.
  I&rsquo;ll mention it. You&rsquo;re tired, of course. This is your room. The
  gong will go at seven-thirty. Don&rsquo;t be late if you can help
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>Anna was not late, but her heart sank within her when she <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_49"
     id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>entered the drawing-room. It was not a
     hopeful looking group. Two or three podgy-looking old men with wives to
     match, half-a-dozen overdressed girls, and a couple of underdressed
     American ones, who still wore the clothes in which they had been tramping
     half over London since breakfast time. A sprinkling of callow youths, and
     a couple of pronounced young Jews, who were talking loudly together in
     some unintelligible jargon of the City. What had she to do with such as
     these? She had hard work to keep a smiling face, as Mrs. White, who had
     risen to greet her, proceeded with a formal, and from Anna&rsquo;s point
     of view, a wholly unnecessary round of introductions. And then
     suddenly&mdash;a relief. A young man&mdash;almost a boy, slight, dark, and
     with his brother&rsquo;s deep grey eyes&mdash;came across the room to
     her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must be the Miss Pellissier of whom David has told me so
  much,&rdquo; he said, shyly. &ldquo;I am very glad that you have come here. I
  heard from David about you only this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are marvellously like your brother,&rdquo; Anna said, beaming
  upon him. &ldquo;I have a letter for you, and no end of messages. Where can
  we sit down and talk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He led her across the room towards a window recess, in which a tall, fair
  young man was seated with an evening paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me introduce my friend to you,&rdquo; Courtlaw said.
  &ldquo;Arthur, this is Miss Pellissier&mdash;Mr. Brendon. Brendon and I are
  great chums,&rdquo; he went on nervously. &ldquo;We are clerks in the same
  bank. I don&rsquo;t think that the rest of the people here like us very well,
  do they, Arthur, so we&rsquo;re obliged to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shook hands with Brendon&mdash;a young man also, but older and more
  self-possessed than Sydney Courtlaw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sydney is quite right, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
  and I don&rsquo;t seem to get on at all with our fellow-guests, as Mrs. White
  calls them. You really ought not to stay here and talk to us. It is a most
  inauspicious start for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Anna laughed, &ldquo;how unfortunate! What ought I
  to do? Should I be forgiven, do you think, if I were to go and hold that
  skein of wool for the old lady in the yellow cap?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of her irreverently,&rdquo; Brendon said, in an
  awed whisper. &ldquo;Her husband was a county councillor, and she has a niece
  who comes to see her in a carriage. I wish she wouldn&rsquo;t look like that
  at us over her glasses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50"
     id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Horace, the manservant, transformed now
     into the semblance of a correctly garbed waiter, threw open the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dinner is served, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he announced to Mrs.
  White.</p>

  <p>There was no rush. Everything was done in a genteel and ordinary way, but
  on the other hand, there was no lingering. Anna found herself next Sydney
  Courtlaw, with his friend close at hand. Opposite to her was a sallow-visaged
  young man, whose small tie seemed like a smudge of obtusively shiny black
  across the front of a high close-drawn collar. As a rule, Courtlaw told her
  softly, he talked right and left, and to everybody throughout the whole of
  the meal&mdash;to-night he was almost silent, and seemed to devote his whole
  attention to staring at Anna. After the first courses however she scarcely
  noticed him. Her two new friends did their best to entertain her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; Brendon said,
  leaning towards her, &ldquo;whatever made you think of coming to stay if only
  for a week at a Montague Street boarding-house. Are you going to write a
  novel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she answered gaily. &ldquo;I came to London
  unexpectedly, and my friends could not take me in. I had a vague sort of idea
  that this was the region where one finds apartments, so I told my cabman to
  drive in this direction while I sat inside his vehicle and endeavoured to
  form a plan of campaign. He brought me past this house, and I thought I would
  call and leave your brother&rsquo;s letter. Then I saw Mrs.
  White&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; Sydney Courtlaw begged, laughingly. &ldquo;You were
  booked of course. An unexpected vacancy, wasn&rsquo;t it? Every one comes in
  on unexpected vacancy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And they go?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When they get the chance. It really isn&rsquo;t so easy to go as it
  seems. We have come to the conclusion, Brendon and I, that Mrs. White is
  psychologically gifted. She throws a sort of spell over us all. We struggle
  against it at first, but in the end we have to submit. She calls us her
  guests, but in reality we are her prisoners. We simply can&rsquo;t get away.
  There&rsquo;s that old gentleman at the end of the table&mdash;Bullding his
  name is. He will tell you confidentially that he simply hates the place. Yet
  he&rsquo;s been here for six years, and he&rsquo;s as much a fixture as that
  sham mahogany sideboard. Everyone will grumble to you
  confidentially&mdash;Miss Ellicot, she&rsquo;s our swagger young lady, you
  know&mdash;up there, next to Miss White, she will tell you that it is so out
  of the world here, so far away from everyone one knows. Old Kesterton,
  choleric-looking individual nearly opposite, will curse the cooking
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51"
     id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>till he&rsquo;s black in the face, but he
     never misses a dinner. The Semitic looking young man opposite, who seems
     to have been committing you to memory piecemeal, will tell you that he was
     never so bored in all his life as he has been here. Yet he stays. They all
     stay!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we are also under the spell,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I
  think that we are here mainly because it is cheap. It is really cheap, you
  know. To appreciate it you should try rooms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this a fair sample of the dinner?&rdquo; Anna asked, who had the
  healthy appetite of a strong young woman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is, if anything, a little above the average,&rdquo; Brendon
  admitted.</p>

  <p>Anna said nothing. The young man opposite was straining his ears to listen
  to their conversation. Mrs. White caught her eye, and smiled benignly down
  the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope that Mr. Courtlaw is looking after you, Miss
  Pellissier,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Admirably, thank you,&rdquo; Anna answered.</p>

  <p>The young lady with frizzled hair, whom Brendon had pointed out to her as
  Miss Ellicot, leaned forward from her hostess&rsquo;s side. She had very
  frizzy hair indeed, very black eyebrows, a profusion of metallic adornments
  about her neck and waist, and an engaging smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are so interested to hear, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;that you have been living in Paris. We shall expect you to tell us all
  what to wear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna smiled very faintly, and shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come from a very unfashionable quarter,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;and I do not think that I have been inside a milliner&rsquo;s shop for
  a year. Besides, it is all reversed now, you know. Paris copies
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon leaned over confidentially.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are in luck, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Your
  success here is absolutely meteoric. Miss Ellicot has spoken to you, the
  great Mr. Bullding is going to. For five minutes he has been trying to think
  of something to say. I am not sure, but I believe that he has just thought of
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I be prepared?&rdquo; Anna asked. &ldquo;Which is Mr.
  Bullding?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stout old gentleman four places down on the left. Look out,
  it&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52"
     id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

  <p>Anna raised her eyes, and caught the earnest gaze of an elderly gentleman
  with a double chin, a protuberant under lip, and a snuff-stained coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was in Paris four years ago,&rdquo; Mr. Building announced
  solemnly. &ldquo;It rained the whole of the time, but we saw all the sights,
  and the place never seemed dull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It takes a great deal of bad weather to depress the true
  Parisian,&rdquo; Anna admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A volatile temperament&mdash;yes, a volatile temperament,&rdquo;
  Mr. Bullding repeated, rather struck with the phrase. &ldquo;It is a pity
  that as nations we are not more friendly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded and turned again to Courtlaw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not be drawn into a conversation with Mr. Bullding,&rdquo;
  she declared. &ldquo;I believe that he would bore me. Tell me, what are these
  bananas and nuts for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dessert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laid down her serviette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us escape,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we three go
  out and have some coffee somewhere? The thought of that drawing-room
  paralyses me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we will. But it is only fair to
  warn you that it isn&rsquo;t expected. Mrs. White is proud of her
  drawing-room evenings. There is a musical programme, and we have the windows
  open and blinds up, and a pink lamp shade over the piano lamp&mdash;a sort of
  advertisement of the place, you know. Strangers look in and long, and
  neighbours are moved to envy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna hesitated no longer. She almost sprang to her feet. Conscious of Mrs.
  White&rsquo;s surprise as she swung easily down the room, followed by the two
  young men, she smiled a careless explanation at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am dying to renew my acquaintance with London, Mrs. White,&rdquo;
  she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not going out&mdash;this evening, I trust,&rdquo; that lady
  asked, a trifle dismayed.</p>

  <p>Anna did not pause, but she looked over her shoulder with slightly lifted
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? They tell me that London is impossible till after ten, and
  I want my first impressions to be favourable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There will be some coffee and music in the drawing-room in a few
  minutes,&rdquo; Mrs. White said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;m not very fond of coffee,&rdquo; Anna answered,
  &ldquo;and I hate music. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53"
     id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

  <p>Mrs. White gasped, and then stiffened. Miss Ellicot, who sang ballads, and
  liked Brendon to turn over the pages for her, tossed her head. Anna passed
  serenely out.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_IX"
     id="Chapter_IX"></a><i>Chapter IX</i></h2>

  <h3>BRENDON&rsquo;S LUCK</h3>

  <p>Anna sat in a chair in her room and sighed. She was alone, and the mask of
  her unchanging high spirits was for the moment laid aside. She was a little
  paler than when she had come to London, a little paler and a little thinner.
  There were dark rims under her eyes, soft now with unshed tears. For this
  three weeks had been the hardest of her life. There had been disappointments
  and humiliations, and although she hated to admit it even to herself, she was
  in desperate straits. Nevertheless, she was still fighting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is one thing I must concentrate on at the moment,&rdquo; she
  told herself, &ldquo;and that is how to pay my next week&rsquo;s bill to Mrs.
  White. It ought not to be much. I have gone without dinner for three nights,
  and&mdash;come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sydney Courtlaw followed his timid knock. Anna raised her eyebrows at the
  sight of him. He was in evening dress: swallow-tailed coat and white tie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this a concession to Mrs. White?&rdquo; she asked, laughing.
  &ldquo;How gratified she must have been! If only I had known I would have
  made an effort to get home in time for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he answered nervously. &ldquo;Please forgive me
  coming up, Miss Pellissier, but you have not been down to dinner for three
  nights, and&mdash;Brendon and I&mdash;we were afraid that you might be
  unwell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never better in my life,&rdquo; Anna declared briskly. &ldquo;I had
  lunch very late to-day, and I did not get home in time for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled grimly at the recollection of that lunch&mdash;tea and roll at
  a cheap caf&eacute;. Sydney was watching her eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;because we want you to do us a favour. Brendon&rsquo;s had an awful
  stroke of luck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Do tell me all
  about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He only heard this afternoon,&rdquo; Sydney continued. &ldquo;An
  uncle in New York is dead, and has left him loads of money. A lawyer has come
  all the way from America about it. We want to celebrate, and we want you to
  help us. Brendon suggests supper at the Carlton. We meant to make it dinner
  and a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55"
     id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>theatre, but you were not home. We thought
     of starting in half an hour&rsquo;s time, and trying for a theatre
     somewhere on the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; exclaimed Anna. &ldquo;I should love to
  come. It is very sweet of you to have waited for me. Run away now, please. I
  must see if I have a gown fit to wear.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Anna declared, as she sipped her wine and looked
  around her, &ldquo;reminds me more of Paris than any place I have yet seen. I
  suppose it is the mirrors and decorations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the people?&rdquo; Brendon asked. &ldquo;What do you think of
  them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna extended her critical survey and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can one say?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you ever see
  women so weary-looking and so dowdy? They do not talk. They seem to spend
  their time yawning and inspecting their neighbour&rsquo;s dresses through
  those hateful glasses. It never seems to enter their heads to try and amuse
  their menkind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two young men on their way down the room came suddenly to a standstill
  before Anna. The foremost, tall, clean-shaven, perfectly groomed, half
  extended his hand with a smile of recognition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Glad to see
  you in London. No idea that you were here, though.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked up with a doubtful smile of non-recognition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is certainly Pellissier,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I am
  very sorry&mdash;I do not recognize you in the least.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tall young man dropped his eye-glass and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had the pleasure of dining with you at the
  &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s&rsquo; one night, before the show, you
  know&mdash;last September I think it was. Charley Pevenill was our host. My
  name is Armytage&mdash;Lord Ernest Armytage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna had suddenly stiffened. She regarded the young man coldly. Her tone
  was icy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that you are making a mistake,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;I was never at any such dinner, and I am quite sure that I do not know
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you remember me, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; the second young
  man interposed. &ldquo;I had the pleasure of&mdash;er&mdash;meeting you more
  than once, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A spot of colour flared in Anna&rsquo;s cheek as she glanced towards the
  speaker. Something in his smile, in the cynical suggestiveness of his
  deferential tone, maddened her.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56"
     id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the best of my belief,&rdquo; she said, with quiet dignity,
  &ldquo;I have never seen either of you before in my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a fraction of a second the two young men hesitated. Then the foremost
  bowed and passed on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am exceedingly sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pray accept my
  apologies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; murmured his companion, with the smile still
  lingering upon his lips.</p>

  <p>They took their places at a distant table. Anna sat quite still for a
  moment, and then the colour suddenly returned to her cheeks. She laughed
  softly, and leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not look so uncomfortable, both of you,&rdquo; she begged.
  &ldquo;Those young men startled me at first, because they knew my name. I am
  quite sure though that they did not mean to be rude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impudent beggars,&rdquo; Sydney growled. &ldquo;I never wanted to
  kick any one so much in my life as that second fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;that it was only his manner. Do
  look at this tragedy in mauve, who has just come in. What can she be? The
  wife of a country tradesman, or a duchess? And such a meek little husband
  too. What can she have done to deserve such a fate? Oh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both turned round at Anna&rsquo;s exclamation. A familiar figure was
  making his way towards them. Sydney sprang up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s David!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
  &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw, haggard, his deep-set eyes more brilliant than ever, took
  Anna&rsquo;s hand into his, and breathed a little close drawn sigh of
  content. He was introduced to Brendon, and a chair was brought by an
  attentive waiter. He declined supper, but took wine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you dropped from the skies?&rdquo; Sydney asked wonderingly.
  &ldquo;It was only yesterday I had your letter, and you never mentioned
  coming over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had some unexpected business,&rdquo; Courtlaw answered
  shortly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how did you find us here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I called at Montague Street a few minutes after you had left. Mrs.
  White told me where to find you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair as though wearied. Yet either the rest or the
  wine seemed already to have done him good. The lines about his mouth
  gradually softened. He talked very little and rather absently. In no way
  could he be said to contribute to the gaiety of the little party. But when
  they were on their way out he whispered in Anna&rsquo;s ear.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57"
     id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please let me drive you home. I want to talk to you, and I must
  return to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are Mr. Brendon&rsquo;s guests,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
  scarcely think it would be nice of me to leave him alone with
  Sydney.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw turned abruptly to Brendon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Brendon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may I rob you of your guest
  just for the drive home? I have only a few hours in England, and Miss
  Pellissier is an old friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Brendon answered. &ldquo;We will follow you in
  another cab.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They passed out on to the pavement, and the commissionaire called a
  hansom. The man looked closely at Anna as she crossed the footway, and as he
  held her skirt from the wheel he pressed something into her hand. Her fingers
  closed upon it instinctively. It was a letter. She slipped it calmly into her
  pocket. The commissionaire smiled. It was a sovereign easily earned.</p>

  <p>The hansom drove off. Suddenly Anna felt her hand seized and imprisoned in
  Courtlaw&rsquo;s burning fingers. She glanced into his face. It was
  enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have stood it for a month, Anna,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You
  will not even answer my letters. I could not keep away any longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that it was wise of you, or kind to come?&rdquo; she
  asked quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wise! Kind! What mockery words are! I came because I had to. I
  cannot live without you, Anna. Come back&mdash;you must come back. We can be
  married to-morrow in Paris. There! You are trying to take your hand
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You disappoint me,&rdquo; she said wearily. &ldquo;You are talking
  like a boy. What is the use of it? I do not wish to marry you. I do not wish
  to return to Paris. You are doing your best to break our
  friendship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is you,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you, who are talking folly, when
  you speak of friendship between you and me. It is not the woman who speaks
  there. It is the vapouring school girl. I tell you that I love you, Anna, and
  I believe that you love me. You are necessary to me. I shall give you my
  life, every moment and thought of my life. You must come back. See what you
  have made of me. I cannot work, I cannot teach. You have grown into my life,
  and I cannot tear you out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna was silent. She was trembling a little. The man&rsquo;s <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_58"
     id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>passion was infectious. She had to school
     herself to speak the words which she knew would cut him like a knife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, David. I have counted you, and always hoped to
  count you, the best of my friends. But I do not love you. I do not love any
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he answered hoarsely. &ldquo;We
  have come too close together for me to believe it. You care for me a little,
  I know. I will teach you how to make that little sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You came to tell me this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came for you,&rdquo; he declared fiercely.</p>

  <p>The hansom sped through the crowded streets. Anna suddenly leaned forward
  and looked around her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are not going the right way,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are coming my way,&rdquo; Courtlaw answered.
  &ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;be merciful. You care for me just a
  little, I know. You are alone in the world, you have no one save yourself to
  consider. Come back with me to-night. Your old rooms are there, if you
  choose. I kept them on myself till the sight of your empty chair and the
  chill loneliness of it all nearly sent me mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna lifted her hand and pushed open the trap door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drive to 13, Montague Street, cabman,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>

  <p>The man pulled up his horse grumbling, and turned round. Courtlaw sat with
  folded arms. He said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no! Let me tell you this.
  Nothing would induce me to marry you, or any man at present. I am a pauper,
  and as yet I have not discovered how to earn money. I am determined to fight
  my own little battle with the world&mdash;there must be a place for me
  somewhere, and I mean to find it. Afterwards, it may be different. If I were
  to marry you now I should feel a dependent being all my life&mdash;a sort of
  parasitical creature without blood or muscle. I should lose every scrap of
  independence&mdash;even my self-respect. However good you were to me, and
  however happy I was in other ways, I should find this intolerable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All these things,&rdquo; he muttered bitterly, &ldquo;this
  desperate resolve to take your life into your own hands, your unnatural
  craving for independence, would never trouble you for a moment&mdash;if you
  really cared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then perhaps,&rdquo; she answered, with a new coldness in her tone,
  &ldquo;perhaps I really do not care. No, don&rsquo;t interrupt me. I think
  that I am a little disappointed in you. You appear to be amongst those strong
  enough in all ordinary matters, but who <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_59"
     id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>seem to think it quite natural and proper
     to give in at once and play the weakling directly&mdash;one cares. Do you
     think that it makes for happiness to force oneself into the extravagant
     belief that love is the only thing in the world worth having, and to
     sacrifice for it independence, self-respect, one&rsquo;s whole scheme of
     life. I cannot do it, David. Perhaps, as you say, I do not really
     care&mdash;but I cannot do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was strangely silent. He did not even reply to her for several
  minutes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot reason with you,&rdquo; he said at last wearily. &ldquo;I
  speak from my heart, and you answer from your brain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Believe me that I have answered you wisely,&rdquo; she said, in a
  gentler tone, &ldquo;wisely for you too, as well as myself. And now you must
  go back, take up your work and think all this over. Presently you will see
  that I am right, and then you shall take your vacation over here, and we will
  be good comrades again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled bitterly as he handed her from the cab. He declined to come
  in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you tell Sydney that I will see him in the morning,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I am staying at the Savoy. He can come round there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will shake hands with me, please,&rdquo; she begged.</p>

  <p>He took her fingers and lifted his eyes to hers. Something he saw there
  made him feel for a moment ashamed. He pressed the long shapely hand warmly
  in his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;Please forgive me. You
  are right. Quite right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was able to go straight to her room without delay, and she at once
  locked the door with a little sigh of relief. She found herself struggling
  with a storm of tears.</p>

  <p>A sob was strangled in her throat. She struggled fiercely not to give
  way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am lonely,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I am lonely. If I could
  but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>To escape from her thoughts she began to undress, humming a light tune to
  herself, though her eyes were hot with unshed tears, and the sobs kept rising
  in her throat. As she drew off her skirt she felt something in the pocket,
  and remembered the letter which the commissionaire at the Carlton had given
  her. She tore open the envelope and read it.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My Dear Girl</span>,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am so sorry if we made asses of ourselves to-night. The
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60"
       id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>fact is I was so glad to see you again
       that it never occurred to me that a little discretion might be
       advisable. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a terribly clumsy fellow.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I hope that you are going to allow me to see something of you
    during your stay in London, for the sake of old times. Could you come to
    tea at my rooms one afternoon, or would you dine with me somewhere, and do
    a theatre? We could have a private room, of course, if you do not wish to
    be seen about London, and a box at the theatre. I often think of those
    delightful evenings in Paris. May we not repeat them once, at any rate, in
    London?</p>

    <p class="right">&ldquo;Ever yours,</p>

    <p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nigel Ennison</span>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;P.S. My address is 94, Pall Mall.&rdquo;</p>
  </div>

  <p>Anna read, and her cheeks grew slowly scarlet. She crushed the letter in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she murmured to herself, &ldquo;if this is the
  beginning.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_X"
     id="Chapter_X"></a><i>Chapter X</i></h2>

  <h3>THE TRAGEDY OF AN APPETITE</h3>

  <p>Anna, notwithstanding her quiet clothes, a figure marvellously out of
  accord with her surroundings, sat before a small marble-topped table at a
  crowded A.B.C., and munched a roll and butter with hearty appetite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If only I could afford another!&rdquo; she thought regretfully.
  &ldquo;I wonder why I am always hungry nowadays. It is so
  ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She lingered over her tea, and glancing around, a sudden reflection on the
  change in her surroundings from the scene of her last night&rsquo;s supper
  brought a faint, humorous smile to her lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In two days,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;Mrs. White will present
  her bill. I have one shilling and sevenpence halfpenny left. I have two days
  in which to earn nearly thirty shillings&mdash;that is with no dinners, and
  get a situation. I fancy that this is a little more than playing at
  Bohemianism.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So far,&rdquo; she continued, eyeing hungrily the last morsel of
  roll which lay upon her plate, &ldquo;my only chance of occupation has lain
  with a photographer who engaged me on the spot and insulted me in half an
  hour. What beasts men are! I cannot typewrite, my three stories are still
  wandering round, two milliners have refused me as a lay figure because
  business was so bad. I am no use for a clerk, because I do not understand
  shorthand. After all, I fancy that I shall have to apply for a situation as a
  nursery governess who understands French. Faugh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took up the last morsel of roll, and held it delicately between her
  long slim fingers. Then her white teeth gleamed, and her excuse for remaining
  any longer before that little marble table was gone. She rose, paid her bill,
  and turned westwards.</p>

  <p>She walked with long swinging steps, scorning the thought of buses or the
  tube. If ever she felt fatigue in these long tramps which had already taken
  her half over London, she never admitted it. Asking her way once or twice,
  she passed along Fleet Street into the Strand, and crossed Trafalgar Square,
  into Piccadilly. Here she walked more slowly, looking constantly at the
  notices in the shop windows. One she entered and met with a sharp
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62"
     id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>rebuff, which she appeared to receive
     unmoved. But when she reached the pavement outside her teeth were
     clenched, and she carried herself unconsciously an inch or so higher. It
     was just then that she came face to face with Nigel Ennison.</p>

  <p>He was walking listlessly along, well-dressed, <i>debonnair</i>,
  good-looking. Directly he saw Anna he accosted her. His manner was
  deferential, even eager. Anna, who was disposed to be sharply critical, could
  find no fault with it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How fortunate I am, Miss Pellissier! All day I have been hoping
  that I might run across you. You got my note?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly received a note,&rdquo; Anna admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were going to answer it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; she said deliberately.</p>

  <p>He looked at her with an expression of comical despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have I done, Miss Pellissier?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;We
  were good friends in Paris, weren&rsquo;t we? You made me all sorts of
  promises, we planned no end of nice things, and then&mdash;without a word to
  any one you disappeared. Now we meet again, and you will scarcely look at me.
  You seem altogether altered, too. Upon my word&mdash;you are Miss Pellissier,
  aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a moment in a puzzled sort of way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have changed
  somehow&mdash;and you certainly are less friendly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed. After all, his was a pleasant face, and a pleasant voice, and
  very likely Annabel had behaved badly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is the London climate. It
  depresses one, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look more like your old self when you smile,&rdquo; he
  remarked. &ldquo;But, forgive me, you are tired. Won&rsquo;t you come and
  have some tea with me? There is a new place in Bond Street,&rdquo; he
  hastened to say, &ldquo;where everything is very well done, and they give us
  music, if that is any attraction to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hesitated and looked for a moment straight into his eyes. He certainly
  bore inspection. He was tall and straight, and his expression was good.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will come&mdash;with pleasure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you
  will promise to treat me as a new acquaintance&mdash;not to refer
  to&mdash;Paris&mdash;at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he answered heartily. &ldquo;Allow me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took his place by her side, and they talked lightly of London, the
  shops and people. They found a cosy little table in the tea-rooms, and
  everything was delicious. Anna, with her marvellous <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_63"
     id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>capacity for enjoyment, ate cakes and
     laughed, and forgot that she had had tea an hour or so ago at an A.B.C.,
     or that she had a care in the world.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration" />
  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;By-the-bye,&rdquo; he said, presently, &ldquo;your sister was
  married to old Ferringhall the other day, wasn&rsquo;t she? I saw the notice
  in the papers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna never flinched. But after the first shock came a warm glow of relief.
  After all, it was what she had been praying for&mdash;and Annabel could not
  have known her address.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My sister and I,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;have seen very
  little of each other lately. I fancy that Sir John does not approve of
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sort of man who can see no further than his nose,&rdquo; he
  remarked contemptuously. &ldquo;Fearful old fogey! I can&rsquo;t imagine any
  sister of yours putting up with him for a moment. I thought perhaps you were
  staying with them, as you did not seem particularly anxious to recognize your
  old friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I am alone,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then we must try and make London endurable for you,&rdquo; he
  remarked cheerfully. &ldquo;What night will you dine and go to the theatre
  with me?&mdash;and how about Hurlingham on Saturday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;Those things are not for
  me just at present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was obviously puzzled. Anna sighed as she reflected that her sister had
  simply revelled in her indiscretions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be meaning to bury
  yourself. There must be something we can do. What do you say to
  Brighton&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked at him quietly&mdash;and he never finished his sentence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I ask whether you are staying with friends in town?&rdquo; he
  inquired deferentially. &ldquo;Perhaps your engagements are made for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am staying,&rdquo; she answered coolly, &ldquo;at a small
  boarding- house near Russell Square.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dropped his eye-glass with a clatter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At a boarding-house?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I am an independent sort of person,&rdquo; she continued,
  &ldquo;and I am engaged in an attempt to earn my own living. You don&rsquo;t
  happen to know of any one, I suppose, who wants a nursery <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_64"
     id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>governess, or a clerk&mdash;without
     shorthand&mdash;or a tryer-on, or a copyist, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake stop, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he
  interrupted. &ldquo;What a hideous repertoire! If you are in earnest about
  wanting to earn money, why on earth don&rsquo;t you accept an engagement
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An engagement?&rdquo; she queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the stage? Yes. You would not have the slightest
  difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed softly to herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;I never thought of
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her as though doubting even now whether she could possibly be
  in earnest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot conceive,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how any other occupation
  could ever have occurred to you. You do not need me to remind you of your
  success at Paris. The papers are continually wondering what has become of
  &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; Your name alone would fill any music hall in
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again that curious smile which puzzled him so much parted her lips for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I fancy you exaggerate my fame. I
  can&rsquo;t imagine Londoners&mdash;particularly interested in me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. Even now he was not at all sure that she was
  not playing with him. There were so many things about her which he could not
  understand. She began to draw on her gloves thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged for the tea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is
  a charming place, and I have enjoyed the rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a delightful piece of good fortune that I should have met
  you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I hope that whatever your plans may be, you
  will give me the opportunity of seeing something of you now and
  then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said, preceding him down the narrow stairs,
  &ldquo;that I am going to be too busy to have much time for gadding about.
  However, I daresay that we shall come across one another before
  long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is provokingly indefinite,&rdquo; he answered, a little
  ruefully. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me your address?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is such a very respectable boarding-house,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;I feel quite sure that Mrs. White would not approve of
  callers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have a clue, at any rate,&rdquo; he remarked, smiling. &ldquo;I
  must try the Directory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65"
     id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>&ldquo;I wish you good luck,&rdquo; she
     answered. &ldquo;There are a good many Whites in London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I put you in a hansom?&rdquo; he asked, lifting his stick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, no,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;Do
  you want to ruin me? I shall walk back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I may come a little way, then?&rdquo; he begged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you think it worth while,&rdquo; she answered doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Apparently he thought it very much worth while. Restraining with an effort
  his intense curiosity, he talked of general subjects only, trying his best to
  entertain her. He succeeded so well that they were almost in Montague Street
  before Anna stopped short.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have brought you very
  nearly to my door. Go back at once, please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held out his hand obediently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I warn you that I shall
  find you out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment she was grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I may be leaving where I am in a few
  days, so very likely you will be no better off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her intently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
  this change in you. Every word you utter puzzles me. I have an idea that you
  are in some sort of trouble. Won&rsquo;t you let me&mdash;can&rsquo;t I be of
  any assistance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was obviously in earnest. His tone was kind and sympathetic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Indeed I shall not
  forget your offer. But just now there is nothing which you or anybody can do.
  Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was dismissed, and he understood it. Anna crossed the street, and
  letting herself in at No. 13 with a latchkey went humming lightly up to her
  room. She was in excellent spirits, and it was not until she had taken off
  her hat, and was considering the question of dinner or no dinner, that she
  remembered that another day had passed, and she was not a whit nearer being
  able to pay her to-morrow&rsquo;s bill.</p>

  <h3>THE PUZZLEMENT OF NIGEL ENNISON</h3>

  <p>Nigel Ennison walked towards his club the most puzzled man in London.
  There could not, he decided, possibly be two girls so much alike. Besides,
  she had admitted her identity. And yet&mdash;he thought of the supper party
  where he had met Annabel Pellissier, the stories about her, his own few
  minutes&rsquo; whispered love-making! He was a self-contained young man, but
  his cheeks grew hot at the thought of the things which it had seemed quite
  natural to say to her then, but which he knew very well would have been
  instantly resented by the girl whom he had just left. He went over her
  features one by one in his mind. They were the same. He could not doubt it.
  There was the same airy grace of movement, the same deep brown hair and
  alabaster skin. He found himself thinking up all the psychology which he had
  ever read. Was this the result of some strange experiment? It was the person
  of Annabel Pellissier&mdash;the soul of a very different order of being.</p>

  <p>He spent the remainder of the afternoon looking for a friend whom he found
  at last in the billiard room of one of the smaller clubs to which he
  belonged. After the usual laconic greetings, he drew him on one side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fred,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember taking me to dinner at
  the &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s,&rsquo; one evening last September, to meet a
  girl who was singing there? Hamilton and Drummond and his lot were with
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; his friend answered. &ldquo;<i>La belle</i>
  &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t it? Annabel Pellissier was her real name.
  Jolly nice girl, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought I saw her in town to-day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you
  happen to know whether she is supposed to be here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very likely indeed,&rdquo; Captain Fred Meddoes answered, lighting
  a cigarette. &ldquo;I heard that she had chucked her show at the French
  places and gone in for a reform all round. Sister&rsquo;s got married to that
  bounder Ferringhall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison took an easy chair.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67"
     id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a little brick!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;She must have
  character. It&rsquo;s no half reform either. What do you know about her,
  Fred? I am interested.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meddoes turned round from the table on which he was practising shots and
  shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and yet about all there is to
  be known, I fancy. There were two sisters, you know. Old Jersey and Hampshire
  family, the Pellissiers, and a capital stock, too, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any one could see that the girls were ladies,&rdquo; Ennison
  murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt about that,&rdquo; Meddoes continued. &ldquo;The father
  was in the army, and got a half-pay job at St. Heliers. Died short, I
  suppose, and the girls had to shift for themselves. One went in for painting,
  kept straight and married old Ferringhall a week or so ago&mdash;the Lord
  help her. The other kicked over the traces a bit, made rather a hit with her
  singing at some of those French places, and went the pace in a mild, ladylike
  sort of way. Cheveney was looking after her, I think, then. If she&rsquo;s
  over, he probably knows all about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison looked steadily at the cigarette which he was tapping on his
  forefinger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Cheveney was her friend, you think, eh?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt about that, I fancy,&rdquo; Meddoes answered lightly.
  &ldquo;He ran some Austrian fellow off. She was quite the rage, in a small
  way, you know. Strange, demure-looking young woman, with wonderful complexion
  and eyes, and a style about her, too. Care for a hundred up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop, thanks,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;See you to-
  night, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sauntered off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll believe it,&rdquo; he muttered to
  himself savagely.</p>

  <p>But for the next few days he avoided Cheveney like the plague.</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>The same night he met Meddoes and Drummond together, the latter over from
  Paris on a week&rsquo;s leave from the Embassy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Odd thing,&rdquo; Meddoes remarked, &ldquo;we were just talking
  about the Pellissier girl. Drummond was telling me about the way old
  Ferringhall rounded upon them all at the club.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68"
     id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sounds interesting,&rdquo; Ennison remarked. &ldquo;May I
  hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; Drummond answered.
  &ldquo;You know what a fearful old prig Ferringhall is, always goes about as
  though the whole world were watching him? We tried to show him around Paris,
  but he wouldn&rsquo;t have any of it. Talked about his years, his position
  and his constituents, and always sneaked off back to his hotel just when the
  fun was going to begin. Well one night, some of us saw him, or thought we saw
  him, at a caf&eacute; dining with &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo;&mdash;as a matter of
  fact, it seems that it was her sister. He came into the club next day, and of
  course we went for him thick. Jove, he didn&rsquo;t take to it kindly, I can
  tell you. Stood on his dignity and shut us up in great style. It seems that
  he was a sort of family friend of the Pellissiers, and it was the artist
  sister whom he was with. The joke of it is that he&rsquo;s married to her
  now, and cuts me dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Ennison said, &ldquo;the likeness between the
  sisters must be rather exceptional?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never saw the goody-goody one close to, so I can&rsquo;t
  say,&rdquo; Drummond answered. &ldquo;Certainly I was a little way off at the
  caf&eacute;, and she had a hat and veil on, but I could have sworn that it
  was &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; still in Paris?&rdquo; Ennison asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Drummond answered. &ldquo;I heard the
  other day that she&rsquo;d been taken in by some cad of a fellow who was
  cutting a great dash in Paris, personating Meysey Hill, the great railway
  man. Anyhow, she&rsquo;s disappeared for some reason or other. Perhaps
  Ferringhall has pensioned her off. He&rsquo;s the sort of johnny who
  wouldn&rsquo;t care about having a sister-in-law on the loose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ennison here thought he saw her in London,&rdquo; Meddoes
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very likely. The two sisters were very fond of one another, I
  believe. Perhaps Sir John is going to take the other one under his wing.
  Who&rsquo;s for a rubber of whist?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison made so many mistakes that he was glad to cut out early in the
  evening. He walked across the Park and called upon his sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Lady Lescelles in?&rdquo; he asked the butler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her ladyship dined at home,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I have
  just ordered a carriage for her. I believe that her ladyship is going to
  Carey House, and on to the Marquis of Waterford&rsquo;s ball,&rdquo; he
  added, hastily consulting a diary on the hall table.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69"
     id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

  <p>A tall elegantly dressed woman, followed by a maid, came down the broad
  staircase.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Nigel?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I hope you are going
  to Carey House.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head, and threw open the door of a great dimly-lit apartment
  on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in here a moment, will you, Blanche,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She assented, smiling. He was her only brother, and she his favourite
  sister. He closed the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to ask you a question,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A serious
  question.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped buttoning her glove, and looked at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and all the rest of them are always lamenting that I do not
  marry. Supposing I made up my mind to marry some one of good enough family,
  but who was in a somewhat doubtful position, concerning whose antecedents, in
  fact there was a certain amount of scandal. Would you stand by me&mdash;and
  her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Nigel!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you
  serious?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know very well that I should never joke on such a subject.
  Mind, I am anticipating events. Nothing is settled upon. It may be, it
  probably will all come to, nothing. But I want to know whether in such an
  event you would stand by me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can count upon me, Nigel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But for you
  Dad would never have let me marry Lescelles. He was only a younger son, and
  you know what trouble we had. I am with you through thick and thin,
  Nigel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kissed her, and handed her into the carriage. Then he went back to his
  rooms and lit a cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are two things to be done,&rdquo; he said softly to himself.
  &ldquo;The first is to discover what she is here for, and where she is
  staying. The second is to somehow meet Lady Ferringhall. These fellows must
  be right,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;and yet&mdash;there&rsquo;s a
  mystery somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XII"
     id="Chapter_XII"></a><i>Chapter XII</i></h2>

  <h3>THE POSTER OF &ldquo;ALCIDE&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>On Saturday mornings there was deposited on the plate of each guest at
  breakfast time, a long folded paper with Mrs. White&rsquo;s compliments. Anna
  thrust hers into her pocket unopened, and for the first time left the house
  without a smile upon her face. She was practically destitute of jewellery.
  The few pence left in her purse would only provide a very scanty lunch.
  Another day of non-success would mean many disagreeable things.</p>

  <p>And even she was forced to admit to herself that this last resource of
  hers was a slender reed on which to lean. She mounted the stairs of the
  theatrical agent&rsquo;s office with very much less than her usual buoyancy,
  nor did she find much encouragement in the general appearance of the room
  into which she was shown. There was already a score or more of people there,
  some standing up and talking together, others seated in chairs ranged along
  the wall. Beyond was another door, on which was painted in black letters:</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Earles</span>,<br />
  Strictly Private</p>

  <p>Every one stared at Anna. Anna stared back at every one with undaunted
  composure. A young man with shiny frock coat and very high collar, advanced
  towards her languidly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Want to see Mr. Earles?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;Here is my card. Will you take
  it in to him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man smiled in a superior manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have to take your turn,&rdquo; he remarked laconically.
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s twenty before you, and Mr. Earles is going out at twelve
  sharp&mdash;important engagement. Better come another morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I will take my
  chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She removed some posters from a chair, and seated herself coolly. The
  young man looked at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unless you have an appointment, which you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll only waste your time here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can spare it,&rdquo; Anna answered suavely.</p>

  <p>The young man entered into a lively little war of words with <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_71"
     id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>a yellow-haired young person near the door.
     Anna picked up an ancient magazine, and began to turn over the pages in a
     leisurely way. The conversation which her entrance had interrupted began
     to buzz again all around her. A quarter of an hour passed. Then the inner
     door opened abruptly. A tall, clean-shaven man came out and walked rapidly
     through the room, exchanging greetings right and left, but evidently
     anxious to avoid being detained. Mr. Earles himself stood upon the
     threshold of his sanctum, the prototype of the smart natty Jew, with black
     hair, waxed moustache, and a wired flower in his button-hole. A
     florid-looking young woman rose up and accosted him eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m next, Mr. Earles,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Been
  sitting on the doorstep almost for two hours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a minute, in a minute,&rdquo; he answered, his eyes fixed upon
  Anna. &ldquo;Reuben, come here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man obeyed the summons. His employer retreated into the further
  apartment, leaving the door ajar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that young lady&rsquo;s name&mdash;girl in dark brown,
  stranger here?&rdquo; Mr. Earles asked sharply.</p>

  <p>The youth produced a crumpled-up card from his waistcoat pocket. A sense
  of impending disaster was upon him. Mr. Earles glanced at it, and his eyes
  flashed with anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You blithering idiot!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Earles strode into the waiting-room. His face was wreathed in smiles,
  his be-ringed hand was cordially outstretched.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;this
  is an unexpected pleasure. Come in! Come in, do. I must apologize for my
  young puppy of a clerk. If I had known that you were here you should not have
  been kept waiting for a second.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It took a good deal to surprise Anna, but it was all she could do to
  follow Mr. Earles with composure into the inner room. There was a little
  murmur of consternation from the waiting crowd, and the florid young woman
  showed signs of temper, to which Mr. Earles was absolutely indifferent. He
  installed Anna in a comfortable easy chair, and placed his own between her
  and the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is capital, capital. It was only
  a few months ago that I told you you must come to London, and you only
  laughed at me. Yet here you are, and at precisely the right moment, too.
  By-the-bye,&rdquo; he added, in a suddenly <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_72"
     id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>altered tone, &ldquo;I hope, I
     trust&mdash;that you have not entered into any arrangements with any one
     here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;oh no!&rdquo; Anna said, a little faintly. &ldquo;I have
  made no arrangements as yet&mdash;none at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Earles recovered his spirits.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Your arrival is really most
  opportune. The halls are on the lookout for something new. By-the-bye, do you
  recognize that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked and gasped. An enormous poster almost covered one side of the
  wall&mdash;<i>the</i> poster. The figure of the girl upon it in plain black
  dress, standing with her hands behind her, was an undeniable and astonishing
  likeness of herself. It was her figure, her style of dress, her manner of
  arranging the hair. Mr. Earles regarded it approvingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A wonderful piece of work,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;A most
  wonderful likeness, too. I hope in a few days, Miss Pellissier, that these
  posters will be livening up our London hoardings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna leaned back in the chair and laughed softly. Even this man had
  accepted her for &ldquo;Alcide&rdquo; without a moment&rsquo;s question. Then
  all the embarrassments of the matter flashed in upon her. She was suddenly
  grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose, Mr. Earles,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that if I were to
  tell you that although that poster was designed from a rough study of me, and
  although my name is Pellissier, that nevertheless, I am not
  &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; would you believe me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can try it on, if you like,&rdquo; Mr. Earles remarked
  genially. &ldquo;My only answer would be to ask you to look at that mirror
  and then at the poster. The poster is of &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a
  duplicate of the French one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna got up and looked at the mirror and then at the poster. The likeness
  was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, sitting down again. &ldquo;I want an
  engagement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; Mr. Earles declared. &ldquo;Any choice as to which
  of the Halls? You can pick and choose, you know. I recommend the
  &lsquo;Unusual.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no choice,&rdquo; Anna declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can get you,&rdquo; Mr. Earles said, slowly, keeping his eyes
  fixed upon her, &ldquo;forty at the &lsquo;Unusual,&rsquo; two turns, encores
  voluntary, six for matin&eacute;es. We should not bar any engagements at
  private houses, but in other respects the arrangement must be
  exclusive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forty what?&rdquo; Anna asked bewildered.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73"
     id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Guineas, of course,&rdquo; Mr. Earles answered, glibly.
  &ldquo;Forty guineas a week. I mentioned sixty, I believe, when I was in
  Paris, but there are expenses, and just now business is bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna was speechless, but she had presence of mind enough to sit still
  until she had recovered herself. Mr. Earles watched her anxiously. She
  appeared to be considering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;I could try for more at the
  &lsquo;Alhambra.&rsquo; Very likely they would give&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be satisfied with the sum you mention,&rdquo; Anna said
  quietly, &ldquo;but there are difficulties.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use such a word, my dear young lady,&rdquo; Mr. Earles
  said persuasively. &ldquo;Difficulties indeed. We&rsquo;ll make short work of
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope that you may,&rdquo; Anna answered enigmatically. &ldquo;In
  the first place, I have no objection to the posters, as they have no name on
  them, but I do not wish to appear at all upon the stage as
  &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; If you engage me it must be upon my own merits. You are
  taking it for granted that I am &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; As a matter of fact, I
  am not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Mr. Earles said, &ldquo;but this is
  rubbish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Call it what you like,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I can sing the
  songs &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; sang, and in the same style. But I will not be
  engaged as &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; or advertised under that name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Earles scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully. Then a light
  seemed to break in upon him. He slapped his knee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Of course, I remember now. It
  was your sister who married Sir John Ferringhall the other day, wasn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t say a word more,&rdquo; Mr. Earles declared.
  &ldquo;I see the difficulty. The old fool&rsquo;s been working on you through
  your sister to keep off the stage. He&rsquo;s a prig to the finger-tips, is
  Sir John&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t know what an artist is. It&rsquo;s awkward, but
  we&rsquo;ll get round it somehow. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what I propose. Let
  me run you for six months. I&rsquo;ll give you, say, thirty-five guineas a
  week clear of expenses, and half of anything you earn above the two turns a
  night. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Anna said coldly, &ldquo;if you will make it three
  months.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better say six,&rdquo; Mr. Earles protested, seating himself before
  the desk, and dipping his pen in the ink.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74"
     id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; Anna decided firmly. &ldquo;I shall not agree to
  six.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It scarcely gives me a chance,&rdquo; Mr. Earles said, with a
  resigned sigh, &ldquo;but I shall rely upon you to stick to me so long as I
  do the right thing by you. You can&rsquo;t do without an agent, and
  there&rsquo;s no one can run you better than I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must also put in the agreement,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;that I
  do not represent myself to be &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo; and that I am not
  advertised to the public by that name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Earles threw down his pen with a little exclamation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He opened the door of still another room, in one corner of which was a
  grand piano. He seated himself before it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to the far corner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and sing the last
  verse of <i>Les Petites</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He struck a note, and Anna responded. Playing with one hand he turned on
  his stool to glance at her. Instinctively she had fallen into the posture of
  the poster, her hands behind her, her head bent slightly forward, her chin
  uplifted, her eyes bright with the drollery of the song. Mr. Earles closed
  the piano with a little bang.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a funny, a very funny young lady,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;but we waste time here. You do not need my compliments. We will get on
  with the agreement and you shall have in it whatever rubbish you
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laughed, and went back to her easy chair. She knew that her voice was
  superior to Annabel&rsquo;s, and she had no further qualms. Whilst she was
  wondering how to frame her request for an advance, Mr. Earles drew out his
  cheque book.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will not object,&rdquo; he said, glancing towards her,
  &ldquo;to accepting a deposit. It is customary even where an agreement is
  drawn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall have no objection at all,&rdquo; Anna assured him.</p>

  <p>He handed her a cheque for thirty-one pounds, ten shillings, and read the
  agreement through to her. Anna took up the pen, and signed, after a
  moment&rsquo;s hesitation,</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">A. Pellissier</span>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will send you a copy,&rdquo; Mr. Earles said, rubbing his hands
  together, &ldquo;by post. Now, will you do me the honour of lunching with me,
  Miss Pellissier?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he queried, &ldquo;you wish to avoid being seen
  about with any one&mdash;er&mdash;connected with the profession, under
  present <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
     id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>circumstances. If so, do not hesitate to
     tell me. Be frank, I beg you, Miss Pellissier. I am already too much
     flattered that you should have given me your confidence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very good, Mr. Earles,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;I think,
  perhaps if you will excuse me, that we will defer the luncheon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just as you wish,&rdquo; Mr. Earles declared good-humouredly,
  &ldquo;but I shall not let you go without drinking a glass of wine to our
  success.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He plunged into one of his drawers, and brought up a small gold-foiled
  bottle. The cork came out with a loud pop, and Anna could not help wondering
  how it must sound to the patient little crowd outside. She drank her glass of
  wine, however, and clanked glasses good-naturedly with Mr. Earles.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  <br />

  <h3>ILLUSTRATION MISSING FROM BOOK</h3><br />
  <hr>

  <p>&ldquo;You must leave me your address if you please,&rdquo; he said, as
  she rose to go.</p>

  <p>She wrote it down. He looked at it with uplifted eyebrows, but made no
  remark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall probably want you to come down to the &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo;
  to-morrow morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bring any new songs you may
  have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded, and Mr. Earles attended her obsequiously to the door. She
  descended the stairs, and found herself at last in the street&mdash;alone. It
  was a brief solitude, however. A young man, who had been spending the last
  hour walking up and down on the opposite side of the way, came quickly over
  to her. She looked up, and recognized Mr. Brendon.</p>
  <hr>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76"
     id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XIII"
     id="Chapter_XIII"></a><i>Chapter XIII</i></h2>

  <h3>&ldquo;HE WILL NOT FORGET!&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>The external changes in Brendon following on his alteration of fortune
  were sufficiently noticeable. From head to foot he was attired in the
  fashionable garb of the young man of the moment. Not only that, but he
  carried himself erect&mdash;the slight slouch which had bent his shoulders
  had altogether disappeared. He came to her at once, and turning, walked by
  her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I should like to know,&rdquo; she said, looking at him with a
  quiet smile, &ldquo;what you are doing here? It is not a particularly
  inspiring neighbourhood for walking about by yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I plead guilty, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he answered at once.
  &ldquo;I saw you go into that place, and I have been waiting for you ever
  since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure whether I feel inclined to scold or thank you,&rdquo;
  she declared. &ldquo;I think as I feel in a good humour it must be the
  latter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He faced her doggedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going to take a
  liberty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You alarm me,&rdquo; she murmured, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I have been playing the spy upon you,&rdquo;
  he continued. &ldquo;Neither Sydney nor I would think of such a thing. But we
  can&rsquo;t help noticing. You have been going out every morning, and coming
  home late&mdash;tired out&mdash;too tired to come down to dinner. Forgive me,
  but you have been looking, have you not, for some employment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite true!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have found out at last
  what a useless person I am&mdash;from a utilitarian point of view. It has
  been very humiliating.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, waving his stick towards Mr.
  Earles&rsquo; office, &ldquo;was your last resource.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It certainly was,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I changed my last
  shilling yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment or two. His lips were tight drawn. His eyes
  flashed as he turned towards her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that it is kind of you, Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he
  said, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77"
     id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>almost roughly, &ldquo;to ignore your
     friends so? In your heart you know quite well that you could pay Sydney or
     me no greater compliment than to give us just a little of your confidence.
     We know London, and you are a stranger here. Surely our advice would have
     been worth having, at any rate. You might have spared yourself many
     useless journeys and disappointments, and us a good deal of anxiety.
     Instead, you are willing to go to a place like that where you ought not to
     be allowed to think of showing yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The very question shows your ignorance,&rdquo; he declared.
  &ldquo;You know nothing about the stage. You haven&rsquo;t an idea what the
  sort of employment you could get there would be like, the sort of people you
  would be mixed up with. It is positively hateful to think of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laid her fingers for a moment upon his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Brendon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I could ask for advice, or
  borrow money from any one, I would from you&mdash;there! But I cannot. I
  never could. I suppose I ought to have been a man. You see, I have had to
  look after myself so long that I have developed a terrible bump of
  independence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such independence,&rdquo; he answered quickly, &ldquo;is a vice.
  You see to what it has brought you. You are going to accept a post as chorus
  girl, or super, or something of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not flatter me,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am too much in earnest,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to be able to
  take this matter lightly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am rebuked,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I suppose my levity is
  incorrigible. But seriously, things are not so bad as you think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They never seem so at first!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not quite understand,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I will
  tell you the truth. It is true that I have accepted an engagement from Mr.
  Earles, but it is a good one. I am not going to be a chorus girl, or even a
  super. I have never told you so, or Sydney, but I can sing&mdash;rather well.
  When my father died, and we were left alone in Jersey, I was quite a long
  time deciding whether I would go in for singing professionally or try
  painting. I made a wrong choice, it seems&mdash;but my voice
  remains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are really going on the stage, then?&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a sense&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon went very pale.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78"
     id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, smiling. &ldquo;I must live, you
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told any one the amount,&rdquo; he went on.
  &ldquo;It sounds too ridiculous. But I have two hundred thousand pounds. Will
  you marry me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked at him in blank amazement. Then she burst into a peal of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How ridiculous! Fancy you
  with all that money! For heaven&rsquo;s sake, though, do not go about playing
  the Don Quixote like this. It doesn&rsquo;t matter with me, but there are at
  least a dozen young women in Mr. Earles&rsquo; waiting-room who would march
  you straight off to a registrar&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not answered my question,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor am I going to,&rdquo; she answered, smiling. &ldquo;I am going
  to ignore it. It was really very nice of you, but to-morrow you will laugh at
  it as I do now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it necessary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for me to tell
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, please,&rdquo; she said firmly.</p>

  <p>Brendon was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not force me to take you seriously,&rdquo; she continued.
  &ldquo;I like to think of your offer. It was impulsive and natural. Now let
  us forget it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, doggedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you must please not look at me as though I were an
  executioner,&rdquo; she declared lightly. &ldquo;I will tell you something if
  you like. One of the reasons why I left Paris and came to London was because
  there was a man there who wanted me to marry him. I really cared for him a
  little, but I am absolutely determined not to marry for some time at any
  rate. I do not want to get only a second-hand flavour of life. One can learn
  and understand only by personal experience, by actual contact with the
  realities of life. I did not want anything made smooth and easy for me. That
  is why I would not marry this man whom I did and whom I do care for a little.
  Later on&mdash;well then the time may come. Then perhaps I shall send for him
  if he has not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know who he is,&rdquo; Brendon said quietly, &ldquo;but he
  will not forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shrugged her shoulders lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your sex is a terrible fraud.
  It is generally deficient in the qualities it prides itself upon most. Men do
  not understand constancy as women do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79"
     id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

  <p>Brendon was not inclined to be led away from the point.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will take it then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have refused
  or ignored one request I have made you this morning. I have yet another. Let
  me lend you some money. Between comrades it is the most usual thing in the
  world, and I do not see how your sex intervenes. Let me keep you from that
  man&rsquo;s clutches. Then we can look out together for such
  employment&mdash;as would be more suitable for you. I know London better than
  you, and I have had to earn my own living. You cannot refuse me
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her anxiously, and she met his glance with a dazzling smile
  of gratitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would not. But it is no longer
  necessary. I cannot tell you much about it, but my bad times are over for the
  present. I will tell you what you shall give me, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lunch! I am hungry&mdash;tragically hungry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He called for a hansom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not sure that you are not a
  very material person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am convinced of it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Let us go to that
  little place at the back of the Palace. I&rsquo;m not half smart enough for
  the West End.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wherever you like!&rdquo; he answered, a little absently.</p>

  <p>They alighted at the restaurant, and stood for a moment in the passage
  looking into the crowded room. Suddenly a half stifled exclamation broke from
  Anna&rsquo;s lips. Brendon felt his arm seized. In a moment they were in the
  street outside. Anna jumped into a waiting hansom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell him to drive&mdash;anywhere,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Brendon told him the name of a distant restaurant and sprang in by her
  side. She was looking anxiously at the entrance to the restaurant. The
  commissionaire stood there, tall and imperturbable. There was no one else in
  the doorway. She leaned back in the corner of the cab with a little sigh of
  relief. A smile flickered upon her lips as she glanced towards Brendon, who
  was very serious indeed. Her sense of humour could not wholly resist his
  abnormal gravity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am so sorry to have startled you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I
  was startled myself. I saw someone in there whom I have always hoped that I
  should never meet again. I hope&mdash;I am sure that he did not see
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He certainly did not follow you out,&rdquo; Brendon answered.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80"
     id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;His back was towards me,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;I saw his face in
  a mirror. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;London is a huge place,&rdquo; Brendon said. &ldquo;Even if he
  lives here you may go all your life and never come face to face with him
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XIV"
     id="Chapter_XIV"></a><i>Chapter XIV</i></h2>

  <h3>&ldquo;THIS IS MY WIFE&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>Anna, notwithstanding her momentary fright in the middle of the day, was
  in high spirits. She felt that for a time at any rate her depressing struggle
  against continual failure was at an end. She had paid her bill, and she had
  enough left in her purse to pay many such. Beyond that everything was
  nebulous. She knew that in her new r&ocirc;le she was as likely as not to be
  a rank failure. But the relief from the strain of her immediate necessities
  was immense. She had been in the drawing-room for a few minutes before the
  gong had sounded, and had chattered gaily to every one. Now, in her old
  place, she was doing her best thoroughly to enjoy a most indifferent
  dinner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your brother has gone?&rdquo; she asked Sydney, between the
  courses.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. David left this afternoon. I do not think that he has quite
  got over his surprise at finding you established here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all, why should he be surprised?&rdquo; she remarked.
  &ldquo;Of course, one lives differently in Paris, but then&mdash;Paris is
  Paris. I think that a boarding-house is the very best place for a woman who
  wants to develop her sense of humour. Only I wish that it did not remind one
  so much of a second-hand clothes shop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sydney looked at her doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I suppose Brendon understands exactly what you mean,&rdquo; he
  remarked. &ldquo;He looks as though he did, at any rate. I don&rsquo;t!
  Please enlighten me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed gaily&mdash;and she had a way when she laughed of throwing
  back her head and showing her beautiful white teeth, so that mirth from her
  was a thing very much to be desired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look round the table,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we all
  just odds and ends of humanity&mdash;the left-overs, you know. There is
  something inconglomerate about us. We are amiable to one another, but we
  don&rsquo;t mix. We can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82"
     id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and I and Brendon get on all right, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
  Sydney objected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s quite different,&rdquo; replied Anna. &ldquo;You
  are neither of you in the least like the ordinary boarding-house young man.
  You don&rsquo;t wear a dinner coat with a flower in your button-hole, or last
  night&rsquo;s shirt, or very glossy boots, nor do you haunt the drawing-room
  in the evening, or play at being musical. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped short. She herself, and one other there, recognized the
  interposition of something akin to tragedy. A thickly-set, sandy young man,
  with an unwholesome complexion and grease-smooth hair, had entered the room.
  He wore a black tail coat buttoned tightly over his chest, and a large
  diamond pin sparkled in a white satin tie which had seen better days. He
  bowed awkwardly to Mrs. White, who held out her hand and beamed a welcome
  upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t this nice!&rdquo; that lady exclaimed.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all delighted to see you again, Mr. Hill. I
  do like to see old friends back here. If there&rsquo;s any one here whom you
  have not met I will make you acquainted with them after dinner. Will you take
  your old place by Miss Ellicot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Ellicot swept aside her skirts from the vacant chair and welcomed the
  newcomer with one of her most engaging smiles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We were afraid that you had deserted us for good, Mr. Hill,&rdquo;
  she said graciously. &ldquo;I suppose Paris is very, very distracting. You
  must come and tell me all about it, although I am not sure whether we shall
  forgive you for not having written to any of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Hill was exchanging greetings with his hostess, and salutations around
  the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am. Glad to get back, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he
  said briskly. &ldquo;Looks like old times here, I see. Sorry I&rsquo;m a bit
  late the first evening. Got detained in the City,
  and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he met the fixed, breathless gaze of those wonderful eyes from the
  other side of the table, and he, too, broke off in the middle of his
  sentence. He breathed heavily, as though he had been running. His large,
  coarse lips drew wider apart. Slowly a mirthless and very unpleasant smile
  dawned upon his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he exclaimed huskily.
  &ldquo;Why&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Amazement seemed to dry up the torrents of his speech. The girl regarded
  him with the face of a Sphinx. Only in her <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_83"
     id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>eyes there seemed to be some apprehension
     of the fact that the young man&rsquo;s clothes and manners were alike
     undesirable things.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you speaking to me?&rdquo; she asked calmly. &ldquo;I am afraid
  that you are making a mistake. I am quite sure that I do not know
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A dull flush burned upon his cheeks. He took his seat at the table, but
  leaned forward to address her. A note of belligerency had crept into his
  tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know me, eh? I like that. You are&mdash;or rather you
  were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he corrected himself with an unpleasant little
  laugh, &ldquo;Miss Pellissier, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A little sensation followed upon his words. Miss Ellicot pursed her lips
  and sat a little more upright. The lady whose husband had been Mayor of
  Hartlepool looked at Anna and sniffed. Mrs. White became conscious of a
  distinct sense of uneasiness, and showed it in her face. She was obliged, as
  she explained continually to every one who cared to listen, to be so very
  particular. On the other hand the two young men who sat on either side of
  Anna were already throwing murderous glances at the newcomer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; Anna replied calmly, &ldquo;is certainly
  Pellissier, but I repeat that I do not know you. I never have known
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He unfolded his serviette with fingers which shook all the time. His eyes
  never left her face. An ugly flush stained his cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty of pals,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who, when
  they&rsquo;ve been doing Paris on the Q.T., like to forget all about
  it&mdash;even their names. But you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something seemed to catch his breath. He never finished his sentence.
  There was a moment&rsquo;s breathless and disappointed silence. If only he
  had known it, sympathy was almost entirely with him. Anna was no favourite at
  No. 13 Montague Street.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You appear,&rdquo; she said, without any sign of anger in her tone,
  and with unruffled composure, &ldquo;to be a very impertinent person. Do you
  mind talking to some one else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. White leaned forward in her chair with an anxious smile designed to
  throw oil upon the troubled waters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t have any
  unpleasantness, and Mr. Hill&rsquo;s first night back amongst us, too. No
  doubt there&rsquo;s some little mistake. We all get deceived sometimes.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84"
     id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Mr. Hill, I hope you won&rsquo;t find
     everything cold. You&rsquo;re a little late, you must remember, and we are
     punctual people here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall do very well, thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he answered
  shortly.</p>

  <p>Sydney and Brendon vied with one another in their efforts to engage Anna
  in conversation, and Miss Ellicot, during the momentary lull, deemed it a
  favourable opportunity to recommence siege operations. The young man was
  mollified by her sympathy, and flattered by the obvious attempts of several
  of the other guests to draw him into conversation. Yet every now and then,
  during the progress of the meal, his attention apparently wandered, and
  leaning forward he glanced covertly at Anna with a curious mixture of
  expressions on his face.</p>

  <p>Anna rose a few minutes before the general company. At the same time
  Sydney and Brendon also vacated their places. To reach the door they had to
  pass the end of the table, and behind the chair where Mr. Hill was seated. He
  rose deliberately to his feet and confronted them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to speak to you for a few minutes,&rdquo; he said to
  Anna, dropping his voice a little. &ldquo;It is no good playing a game. We
  had better have it over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She eyed him scornfully. In any place her beauty would have been an
  uncommon thing. Here, where every element of her surroundings was tawdry and
  commonplace, and before this young man of vulgar origin and appearance, it
  was striking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know you,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I have nothing to
  say to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"

  <h3>ILLUSTRATION MISSING FROM BOOK</h3><br />
  <hr>

  <p>He stood before the door. Brendon made a quick movement forward. She laid
  her hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It really is not
  necessary. Be so good as to let me pass, sir,&rdquo; she added, looking her
  obstructor steadily in the face.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is all rot!&rdquo; he declared angrily. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
  think that I&rsquo;m fool enough to be put off like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She glanced at Brendon, who stood by her side, tall and threatening. Her
  eyebrows were lifted in expostulation. A faint, delightfully humorous smile
  parted her lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if this person will not be
  reasonable, I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was enough. A hand of iron fell upon the scowling young man&rsquo;s
  shoulder.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85"
     id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be so good as to stand away from that door at once, sir,&rdquo;
  Brendon ordered.</p>

  <p>Hill lost a little of his truculency. He knew very well that his muscles
  were flabby, and his nerve by no means what it should be. He was no match for
  Brendon. He yielded his place and struck instead with his tongue. He turned
  to Mrs. White.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, ma&rsquo;am, to seem the cause of any disturbance,
  but this,&rdquo; he pointed to Anna, &ldquo;is my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sensation produced was gratifying enough. The man&rsquo;s statement
  was explicit, and spoken with confidence. Every one looked at Anna. For a
  moment she too had started and faltered in her exit from the room. Her
  fingers clutched the side of the door as though to steady herself. She caught
  her breath, and her eyes were lit with a sudden terror. She recovered
  herself, however, with amazing facility. Scarcely any one noticed the full
  measure of her consternation. From the threshold she looked her accuser
  steadily and coldly in the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you have said is a ridiculous falsehood,&rdquo; she declared
  scornfully. &ldquo;I do not even know who you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She swept out of the room. Hill would have followed her, but Mrs. White
  and Miss Ellicot laid each a hand upon his arm, one on either side. The
  echoes of his hard, unpleasant laugh reached Anna on her way upstairs.</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>It was a queer little bed-sitting-room almost in the roof, with a
  partition right across it. As usual Brendon lit the candles, and Sydney
  dragged out the spirit-lamp and set it going. Anna opened a cupboard and
  produced cups and saucers and a tin of coffee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only four spoonsful left,&rdquo; she declared briskly, &ldquo;and
  your turn to buy the next pound, Sydney.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it to-morrow.
  Fresh ground, no chicory, and all the rest of it. But&mdash;Miss
  Pellissier!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure that you want us this evening? Wouldn&rsquo;t
  you rather be alone? Just say the word, and we&rsquo;ll clear out like a
  shot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are afraid,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the young man who
  thinks that he is my husband has upset me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86"
     id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madman!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blithering ass!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl looked into the two indignant faces and held out both her
  hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very nice, both of you,&rdquo; she said gently.
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid you are going to be in a hopeless minority here
  as regards me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They eyed her incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; Sydney exclaimed, &ldquo;that the
  people downstairs will be such drivelling asses as to believe piffle like
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna measured out the coffee. Her eyes were lit with a gleam of humour.
  After all, it was really rather funny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
  always notice that people find it very easy to believe what they want to
  believe, and you see I&rsquo;m not in the least popular. Miss Ellicot, for
  instance, considers me a most improper person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Ellicot! That old cat!&rdquo; Sydney exclaimed
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Ellicot!&rdquo; Brendon echoed. &ldquo;As if it could possibly
  matter what such a person thinks of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laughed outright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are positively eloquent to-night&mdash;both of you,&rdquo; she
  declared. &ldquo;But, you see, appearances are very much against me. He knew
  my name, and also that I had been living in Paris, and a man doesn&rsquo;t
  risk claiming a girl for his wife, as a rule, for nothing. He was painfully
  in earnest, too. I think you will find that his story will be believed,
  whatever I say; and in any case, if he is going to stay on here, I shall have
  to go away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Sydney begged. &ldquo;We will see that
  he never annoys you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is evidently a friend of Mrs. White&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;and if he is going to persist in this delusion, we cannot both remain
  here. I&rsquo;d rather not go,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;This is much the
  cheapest place I know of where things are moderately clean, and I should hate
  rooms all by myself. Dear me, what a nuisance it is to have a pseudo husband
  shot down upon one from the skies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And such a beast of a one,&rdquo; Sydney remarked vigorously.</p>

  <p>Brendon looked across the room at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is there anything we could do to
  help you to get rid of him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87"
     id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>&ldquo;Can you think of anything?&rdquo;
     Anna answered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! He appears to be a most immovable
     person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon hesitated for a moment. He was a little embarrassed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There ought to be some means of getting at him,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;The fellow seems to know your name, Miss Pellissier, and that you have
  lived in Paris. Might we ask you if you have ever seen him, if you knew him
  at all before this evening?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stood up suddenly, and turning her back to them, looked steadily out
  of the window. Below was an uninspiring street, a thoroughfare of
  boarding-houses and apartments. The steps, even the pavements, were invaded
  by little knots of loungers driven outside by the unusual heat of the
  evening, most of them in evening dress, or what passed for evening dress in
  Montague Street. The sound of their strident voices floated upwards, the high
  nasal note of the predominant Americans, the shrill laughter of girls quick
  to appreciate the wit of such of their male companions as thought it worth
  while to be amusing. A young man was playing the banjo. In the distance a
  barrel-organ was grinding out a <i>pot pourri</i> of popular airs. Anna
  raised her eyes. Above the housetops it was different. She drew a long
  breath. After all, why need one look down. Always the other things
  remained.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I would rather not have
  anything to say about that man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; they both declared
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Brendon dismissed the subject with a wave of the hand. He glanced at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us walk round to Covent Garden,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I
  daresay the gallery will be full, but there is always the chance, and I know
  you two are keen on Melba.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have to go out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They hesitated. As a rule their comings and goings were discussed with
  perfect confidence, but on this occasion they both felt that there was intent
  in her silence as to her destination. Nevertheless Sydney, clumsily, but
  earnestly, had something to say about it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid&mdash;I really think that one of us ought to go with
  you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That beast of a fellow is certain to be hanging
  about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a secret mission,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;There are
  policemen&mdash;and buses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88"
     id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&ldquo;You shall not need either,&rdquo;
     Brendon said grimly. &ldquo;We will see that he doesn&rsquo;t follow
     you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She thanked him with a look and rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go down and rescue the rags of my reputation,&rdquo; she said,
  smiling. &ldquo;I expect it is pretty well in shreds by now. To-morrow
  morning I shall have made up my mind what to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE</h3>

  <p>Anna looked about her admiringly. It was just such a bedroom as she would
  have chosen for herself. The colouring was green and white, with softly
  shaded electric lights, an alcove bedstead, which was a miracle of
  daintiness, white furniture, and a long low dressing-table littered all over
  with a multitude of daintily fashioned toilet appliances. Through an open
  door was a glimpse of the bathroom&mdash;a vision of luxury, out of which
  Annabel herself, in a wonderful dressing-gown and followed by a maid
  presently appeared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too bad to keep you waiting,&rdquo; Annabel exclaimed.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really very sorry. Collins, you can go now. I will ring if I
  want you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The maid discreetly withdrew, and Anna stood transfixed, gazing with
  puzzled frown at her sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel! Why, what on earth have you been doing to yourself,
  child?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed a little uneasily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The very question, my dear sister,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tells me
  that I have succeeded. Dear me, what a difference it has made! No one would
  ever think that we were sisters. Don&rsquo;t you think that the shade of my
  hair is lovely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing particular the matter with the shade,&rdquo; Anna
  answered, &ldquo;but it is not nearly so becoming as before you touched it.
  And what on earth do you want to darken your eyebrows and use so much make-up
  for at your age? You&rsquo;re exactly twenty-three, and you&rsquo;re got up
  as much as a woman of forty-five.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only use the weeniest little dab of rouge,&rdquo; she declared,
  &ldquo;and it is really necessary, because I want to get rid of the
  &lsquo;pallor effect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna made no remark. Her disapproval was obvious enough. Annabel saw it,
  and suddenly changed her tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very stupid, Anna,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Can you not
  understand? It is of no use your taking my identity and all <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_90"
     id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>the burden of my iniquities upon your dear
     shoulders if I am to be recognized the moment I show my face in London.
     That is why I have dyed my hair, that is why I have abandoned my
     r&ocirc;le of <i>ingenu&egrave;e</i> and altered my whole style of dress.
     Upon my word, Anna,&rdquo; she declared, with a strange little laugh,
     &ldquo;you are a thousand times more like me as I was two months ago than
     I am myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A sudden sense of the gravity of this thing came home to Anna. Her
  sister&rsquo;s words were true. They had changed identities absolutely. It
  was not for a week or a month. It was for ever. A cold shiver came over her.
  That last year in Paris, when Annabel and she had lived in different worlds,
  had often been a nightmare to her. Annabel had taken her life into her hands
  with gay <i>insouciance</i>, had made her own friends, gone her own way. Anna
  never knew whither it had led her&mdash;sometimes she had fears. It was her
  past now, not Annabel&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very good of you to come and see me, my dear sister,&rdquo;
  Annabel remarked, throwing herself into a low chair, and clasping her hands
  over her head. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I am a little dull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is your husband?&rdquo; Anna asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is addressing a meeting of his constituents somewhere,&rdquo;
  Annabel answered. &ldquo;I do not suppose he will be home till late. Tell me
  how are you amusing yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been amusing myself up to now by trying to earn my
  living,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; Annabel answered lazily, &ldquo;that you have
  succeeded. By-the-bye, do you want any money? Sir John&rsquo;s ideas of pin
  money are not exactly princely, but I can manage what you want, I dare
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Anna answered coldly. &ldquo;I am not in need of
  any. I might add that in any case I should not touch Sir
  John&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a pity,&rdquo; Annabel said. &ldquo;He wants to
  settle something on you, I believe. It is really amusing. He lives in
  constant dread of a reappearance of &lsquo;<i>La Belle Alcide</i>,&rsquo; and
  hearing it said that she is his wife&rsquo;s sister. Bit priggish,
  isn&rsquo;t it? And if he only knew it&mdash;so absurd. Tell me how you are
  earning your living here, Anna&mdash;typewriting, or painting, or
  lady&rsquo;s companion?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;that the less you know about me
  the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91"
     id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>better. Is all your house on the same scale
     of magnificence as this, Annabel?&rdquo; she asked, looking round.</p>

  <p>Annabel shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most of it is ugly and frowsy,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;but it
  isn&rsquo;t worth talking about. I have made up my mind to insist upon moving
  from here into Park Lane, or one of the Squares. It is absolutely a frightful
  neighbourhood, this. If only you could see the people who have been to call
  on me! Sir John has the most absurd ideas, too. He won&rsquo;t have
  menservants inside the house, and his collection of carriages is only fit for
  a museum&mdash;where most of his friends ought to be, by-the-bye. I can
  assure you, Anna, it will take me years to get decently established. The
  man&rsquo;s as obstinate as a mule.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked at her steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will find it difficult no doubt to alter his style of
  living,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not blame him. I hope you will always
  remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel held out her hands with a little cry of protest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No lecturing, Anna!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I hope you have
  not come for that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came,&rdquo; Anna answered, looking her sister steadily in the
  face, &ldquo;to hear all that you can tell me about a man named
  Hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel had been lying curled up on the lounge, the personification of
  graceful animal ease. At Anna&rsquo;s words she seemed suddenly to stiffen.
  Her softly intertwined fingers became rigid. The little spot of rouge was
  vivid enough now by reason of this new pallor, which seemed to draw the
  colour even from her lips. But she did not speak. She made no attempt to
  answer her sister&rsquo;s question. Anna looked at her curiously, and with
  sinking heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must answer me, Annabel,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You must
  tell me the truth, please. It is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel rose slowly to her feet, walked to the door as though to see that
  it was shut, and came back with slow lagging footsteps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a man called Montague Hill,&rdquo; she said hoarsely,
  &ldquo;but he is dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there is also,&rdquo; Anna remarked, &ldquo;a Montague Hill
  who is very much alive. Not only that, but he is here in London. I have just
  come from him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel no longer attempted to conceal her emotion. She battled with a
  deadly faintness, and she tottered rather than <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_92"
     id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>walked back to her seat. Anna, quitting her
     chair, dropped on her knees by her sister&rsquo;s side and took her
     hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not be frightened, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must tell
  me the truth, and I will see that no harm comes to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The only Montague Hill I ever knew,&rdquo; Annabel said slowly,
  &ldquo;is dead. I know he is dead. I saw him lying on the footway. I felt his
  heart. It had ceased to beat. It was a motor accident&mdash;a fatal motor
  accident the evening papers called it. They could not have called it a fatal
  motor accident if he had not been dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was the night you left
  Paris. They thought that he was dead at first, and they took him to the
  hospital. I believe that his recovery was considered almost
  miraculous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alive,&rdquo; Annabel moaned, her eyes large with terror.
  &ldquo;You say that he is alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is certainly alive,&rdquo; Anna declared. &ldquo;More than that,
  he arrived to-day at the boarding-house where I am staying, greeted me with a
  theatrical start, and claimed me&mdash;as his wife. That is why I am here.
  You must tell me what it all means.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Annabel exclaimed. &ldquo;What did you
  say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I considered myself justified in denying it,&rdquo; Anna
  answered drily. &ldquo;He produced what he called a marriage certificate, and
  I believe that nearly every one in the boarding-house, including Mrs. White,
  my landlady, believes his story. I am fairly well hardened in
  iniquity&mdash;your iniquity, Annabel&mdash;but I decline to have a husband
  thrust upon me. I really cannot have anything to do with Mr. Montague
  Hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&mdash;marriage certificate!&rdquo; Annabel gasped.</p>

  <p>Anna glanced into her sister&rsquo;s face, and rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me get you some water, Annabel. Don&rsquo;t be frightened,
  dear. Remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel clutched her sister&rsquo;s arm. She would not let her move. She
  seemed smitten with a paroxysm of fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A thick-set, coarse-looking young man, Anna!&rdquo; she exclaimed
  in a hoarse excited whisper. &ldquo;He has a stubbly yellow moustache, weak
  eyes, and great horrid hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the same man, Annabel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is no
  doubt whatever about that. There was the motor accident, too. It is the same
  man, for he raved in the hospital, and they fetched me. It was you, of
  course, whom he wanted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93"
     id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alive! In London!&rdquo; Annabel moaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Pull yourself together, Annabel! I must have the
  truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl on the lounge drew a long sobbing breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Listen! There was a Meysey Hill
  in Paris, an American railway millionaire. This man and he were alike, and
  about the same age. Montague Hill was taken for the millionaire once or
  twice, and I suppose it flattered his vanity. At any rate, he began to
  deliberately personate him. He sent me flowers. Celeste introduced him to
  me&mdash;oh, how Celeste hated me! She must have known. He&mdash;wanted to
  marry me. Just then&mdash;I was nervous. I had gone further than I meant
  to&mdash;with some Englishmen. I was afraid of being talked about. You
  don&rsquo;t know, Anna, but when one is in danger one realizes that
  the&mdash;the other side of the line is Hell. The man was mad to marry me. I
  heard everywhere of his enormous riches and his generosity. I consented. We
  went to the Embassy. There was&mdash;a service. Then he took me out to
  Monteaux, on a motor. We were to have breakfast there and return in the
  evening. On the way he confessed. He was a London man of business, spending a
  small legacy in Paris. He had heard me sing&mdash;the fool thought himself in
  love with me. Celeste he knew. She was chaffing him about being taken for
  Meysey Hill, and suggested that he should be presented to me as the
  millionaire. He told me with a coarse nervous laugh. I was his wife. We were
  to live in some wretched London suburb. His salary was a few paltry hundreds
  a year. Anna, I listened to all that he had to say, and I called to him to
  let me get out. He laughed. I tried to jump, but he increased the speed. We
  were going at a mad pace. I struck him across the mouth, and across the eyes.
  He lost control of the machine. I jumped then&mdash;I was not even shaken. I
  saw the motor dashed to pieces against the wall, and I saw him pitched on his
  head into the road. I leaned over and looked at him&mdash;he was quite still.
  I could not hear his heart beat. I thought that he was dead. I stole away and
  walked to the railway station. That night in Paris I saw on the bills
  &lsquo;Fatal Motor Accidents.&rsquo; <i>Le Petit Journal</i> said that the
  man was dead. I was afraid that I might be called upon as a witness. That is
  why I was so anxious to leave Paris. The man who came to our rooms, you know,
  that night was his friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The good God!&rdquo; Anna murmured, herself shaken with fear.
  &ldquo;You were married to him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94"
     id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;It could not be legal,&rdquo; Annabel moaned. &ldquo;It
  couldn&rsquo;t be. I thought that I was marrying Meysey Hill, not that
  creature. We stepped from the Embassy into the motor&mdash;and oh! I thought
  that he was dead. Why didn&rsquo;t he die?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna sprang to her feet and walked restlessly up and down the room.
  Annabel watched her with wide-open, terrified eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give me away, Anna. He would never recognize me
  now. You are much more like what I was then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna stopped in front of her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t propose, do you,&rdquo; she said quietly,
  &ldquo;that I should take this man for my husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can drive him away,&rdquo; Annabel cried. &ldquo;Tell him that
  he is mad. Go and live somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In his present mood,&rdquo; Anna remarked, &ldquo;he would follow
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you are strong and brave,&rdquo; Annabel murmured. &ldquo;You
  can keep him at arm&rsquo;s length. Besides, it was under false pretences. He
  told me that he was a millionaire. It could not be a legal
  marriage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very much afraid,&rdquo; Anna answered, &ldquo;that it was. It
  might be upset. I am wondering whether it would not be better to tell your
  husband everything. You will never be happy with this hanging over
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel moistened her dry lips with a handkerchief steeped in eau de
  Cologne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him, Anna,&rdquo; she said with a little
  shudder, &ldquo;or you would not talk like that. He is steeped in the
  conventions. Every slight action is influenced by what he imagines would be
  the opinion of other people. Anything in the least irregular is like poison
  to him. He has no imagination, no real generosity. You might tell the truth
  to some men, but never to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna was thoughtful. A conviction that her sister&rsquo;s words were true
  had from the first possessed her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;if I fight this thing out
  myself, can I trust you that it will not be a vain sacrifice? After what you
  have said it is useless for us to play with words. You do not love your
  husband, you have married him for a position&mdash;to escape
  from&mdash;things which you feared. Will you be a faithful and honest wife?
  Will you do your duty by him, and forget all your past follies? Unless,
  Annabel, you can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I will pledge you my word,&rdquo; Annabel cried passionately,
  &ldquo;my solemn word. Believe me, Anna. Oh, you must believe me. I have been
  very foolish, but it is over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95"
     id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember that you are young still, and fond of admiration,&rdquo;
  Anna said. &ldquo;You will not give Sir John any cause for jealousy? You will
  have no secrets from him except&mdash;concerning those things which are
  past?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna, I swear it!&rdquo; her sister sobbed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I will do what I can,&rdquo; Anna promised. &ldquo;I believe
  that you are quite safe. He has had brain fever since, and, as you say, I am
  more like what you were then than you yourself are now. I don&rsquo;t think
  for a moment that he would recognize you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel clutched her sister&rsquo;s hands. The tears were streaming down
  her face, her voice was thick with sobs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna, you are the dearest, bravest sister in the world,&rdquo; she
  cried. &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t thank you. You dear, dear girl.
  I&mdash;listen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They heard a man&rsquo;s voice outside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John!&rdquo; Annabel gasped.</p>

  <p>Anna sprang to her feet and made for the dressing-room door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One moment, if you please!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped short and looked round. Sir John stood upon the threshold.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XVI"
     id="Chapter_XVI"></a><i>Chapter XVI</i></h2>

  <h3>THE DISCOMFITURE OF SIR JOHN</h3>

  <p>Sir John looked from one to the other of the two sisters. His face
  darkened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My arrival appears to be opportune,&rdquo; he said stiffly.
  &ldquo;I was hoping to be able to secure a few minutes&rsquo; conversation
  with you, Miss Pellissier. Perhaps my wife has already prepared you for what
  I wish to say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Anna answered calmly. &ldquo;We have
  scarcely mentioned your name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John coughed. He looked at Annabel, whose face was buried in her
  hands&mdash;he looked back at Anna, who was regarding him with an easy
  composure which secretly irritated him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is concerning&mdash;our future relations,&rdquo; Sir John
  pronounced ponderously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Anna answered indifferently. &ldquo;That sounds
  interesting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John frowned. Anna was unimpressed. Elegant, a little scornful, she
  leaned slightly against the back of a chair and looked him steadily in the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to altogether ignore the
  fact that you are my wife&rsquo;s sister, and have therefore a certain claim
  upon me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna&rsquo;s eyes opened a little wider, but she said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A claim,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;which I am quite prepared to
  recognize. It will give me great pleasure to settle an annuity for a moderate
  amount upon you on certain conditions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&mdash;what?&rdquo; Anna asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An annuity&mdash;a sum of money paid to you yearly or quarterly
  through my solicitors, and which you can consider as a gift from your sister.
  The conditions are such as I think you will recognize the justice of. I wish
  to prevent a repetition of any such errand as I presume you have come here
  upon this evening. I cannot have my wife distressed or worried.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; Anna said softly, &ldquo;what you presume to have
  been the nature of my errand here this evening?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John pointed to Annabel, who was as yet utterly limp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot but conclude,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your errand
  involved <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97"
     id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>the recital to my wife of some trouble in
     which you find yourself. I should like to add that if a certain amount is
     needed to set you free from any debts you may have contracted, in addition
     to this annuity, you will not find me unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna glanced momentarily towards her sister, but Annabel neither spoke nor
  moved.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With regard to the conditions I mentioned,&rdquo; Sir John
  continued, gaining a little confidence from Anna&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;I
  think you will admit that they are not wholly unreasonable. I should require
  you to accept no employment whatever upon the stage, and to remain out of
  England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna&rsquo;s demeanour was still imperturbable, her marble pallor untinged
  by the slightest flush of colour. She regarded him coldly, as though
  wondering whether he had anything further to say. Sir John hesitated, and
  then continued.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will recognize the justice
  of these conditions. Under happier circumstances nothing would have given me
  more pleasure than to have offered you a home with your sister. You yourself,
  I am sure, recognize how impossible you have made it for me now to do
  anything of the sort. I may say that the amount of the annuity I propose to
  allow you is two hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked for a moment steadily at her sister, whose face was still
  averted. Then she moved towards the door. Before she passed out she turned
  and faced Sir John. The impassivity of her features changed at last. Her eyes
  were lit with mirth, the corners of her mouth quivered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, Sir John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to
  thank you. I can understand now these newspapers when they talk of your
  magnificent philanthropy. It is magnificent indeed. And yet&mdash;you
  millionaires should really, I think, cultivate the art of discrimination. I
  am so much obliged to you for your projected benevolence. Frankly, it is the
  funniest thing which has ever happened to me in my life. I shall like to
  think of it&mdash;whenever I feel dull. Good-bye, Anna!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel sprang up. Sir John waved her back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I understand you then to refuse my offer?&rdquo; he asked
  Anna.</p>

  <p>She shot a sudden glance at him. Sir John felt hot and furious. It was
  maddening to be made to feel that he was in any way the inferior of this
  cool, self-possessed young woman, whose eyes seemed for a moment to
  scintillate with scorn. There were one or two bitter moments in his life when
  he had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98"
     id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>been made to feel that gentility laid on
     with a brush may sometimes crack and show weak places&mdash;that
     deportment and breeding are after all things apart. Anna went out.</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>Her cheeks burned for a moment or two when she reached the street,
  although she held her head upright and walked blithely, even humming to
  herself fragments of an old French song. And then at the street corner she
  came face to face with Nigel Ennison.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pretend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this is an
  accident. The fates are never so kind to me. As a matter of fact I have been
  waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And by what right do you do
  anything of the sort?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No right at all,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Only it is much too
  late for you to be out alone. You have been to see your sister, of course.
  How is she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My sister is quite well, thank you,&rdquo; she answered.
  &ldquo;Would you mind calling that hansom for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at it critically and shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You really couldn&rsquo;t ride in it,&rdquo; he said,
  deprecatingly. &ldquo;The horse&rsquo;s knees are broken, and I am not sure
  that the man is sober. I would sooner see you in a &rsquo;bus
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you have been here ever since I
  came?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I must confess it,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;Idiotic, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; she agreed coldly. &ldquo;I wish you would not
  do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would not do what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, follow buses from Russell Square to Hampstead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that it isn&rsquo;t a
  habit of mine. But seriously&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well seriously?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it your own fault a little? Why do you not tell me your
  address, and allow me to call upon you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should I? I have told you that I do not wish for acquaintances
  in London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not in a general way,&rdquo; he answered calmly. &ldquo;You
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99"
     id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>are quite right, I think. Only I am not an
     acquaintance at all. I am an old friend, and I declined to be
     shelved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me,&rdquo; Anna asked, &ldquo;how long I
  knew you in Paris?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her sideways. There was nothing to be learned from her
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I had met you three
  times&mdash;before Drummond&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Drummond&rsquo;s dinner!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You were
  there, were you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather a strange question&mdash;under the
  circumstances?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>Her cheeks flushed a dull red. She felt that there was a hidden meaning
  under his words. Yet her embarrassment was only a passing thing. She
  dismissed the whole subject with a little shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are both of us trenching upon forbidden ground,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;It was perhaps my fault. You have not
  forgotten&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have forgotten nothing?&rdquo; he answered, enigmatically.</p>

  <p>Anna hailed a bus. He looked at her reproachfully. The bus however was
  full. They fell into step again. More than ever a sense of confusion was upon
  Ennison.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Last time I saw you,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;you spoke, did
  you not, of obtaining some employment in London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; she answered briskly, &ldquo;and thanks to you I
  have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks to me,&rdquo; he repeated, puzzled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? But it is very simple. It was you who were so much amazed that
  I did not try&mdash;the music hall stage here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must admit,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that to us&mdash;who had
  seen you&mdash;the thought of your trying anything else was
  amazing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;your remarks decided me. I
  have an engagement with a theatrical agent&mdash;I believe for the
  &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are going to sing in London?&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he did not speak. Glancing towards him she saw that a
  shadow had fallen upon his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;why you look like that. You
  are afraid&mdash;that here in London&mdash;I shall not be a success. It is
  that, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100"
     id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered readily. &ldquo;It is not that. The idea of
  your being a failure would never have occurred to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why are you sorry that I am going to the
  &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo;? I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Their eyes met for a moment. His face was very serious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Why, I do not
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I positively insist upon knowing,&rdquo; she declared cheerfully.
  &ldquo;The sooner you tell me the better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very hard to explain,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I think that
  it is only an idea. Only you seem to me since the time when I knew you in
  Paris to have changed&mdash;to have changed in some subtle manner which I
  find at times utterly bewildering. I find you an impenetrable enigma. I find
  it impossible to associate you with&mdash;my little friend of the
  &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s.&rsquo; The things she said and did from
  you&mdash;seem impossible. I had a sort of idea,&rdquo; he went on,
  &ldquo;that you were starting life all over again, and it seemed awfully
  plucky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. Then Anna spoke more seriously than usual.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I rather like what you have
  said. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to go on thinking it. Even though I am going to
  sing at the &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo; you may find that the &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo;
  whom you knew in Paris does not exist any more. At the same time,&rdquo; she
  added, in a suddenly altered tone, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t anything whatever to
  do with you, is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You permitted me then to call
  you my friend. I do not intend to allow you to forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They passed a man who stared at them curiously. Ennison started and looked
  anxiously at Anna. She was quite unconcerned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see who that was?&rdquo; he asked in a low tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not recognize him,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I supposed
  that he took off his hat to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was Cheveney!&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cheveney!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I do not know any one of that
  name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He caught her wrist and turned her face towards him. Her eyes were wide
  open with amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Ennison!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He released her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Who are you&mdash;Annabel
  Pellissier or her ghost?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101"
     id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

  <p>Anna laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it is a choice between the two,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I
  must be Annabel Pellissier. I am certainly no ghost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have her face and figure,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You have
  even her name. Yet you can look Cheveney in the face and declare that you do
  not know him. You have changed from the veriest butterfly to a
  woman&mdash;you wear different clothes, you have the air of another world. If
  you do not help me to read the riddle of yourself, Annabel, I think that very
  soon I shall be a candidate for the asylum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily, and became as suddenly grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Mr. Cheveney was another Paris friend, was he?&rdquo; she
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t befool me any more,&rdquo; he answered, almost roughly.
  &ldquo;If any one should know&mdash;&mdash;you should! He was your friend. We
  were only&mdash;<i>les autres</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is quite untrue,&rdquo; she declared cheerfully. &ldquo;I
  certainly knew him no better than you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then he&mdash;and Paris&mdash;lied,&rdquo; Ennison answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is far easier to believe. You are
  too credulous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison had things to say, but he looked at her and held his tongue. They
  turned the last corner, and almost immediately a man who had been standing
  there turned and struck Ennison a violent blow on the cheek. Ennison reeled,
  and almost fell. Recovering himself quickly his instinct of self-defence was
  quicker than his recollection of Anna&rsquo;s presence. He struck out from
  the shoulder, and the man measured his length upon the pavement.</p>

  <p>Anna sprang lightly away across the street. Brendon and Courtlaw who had
  been watching for her, met her at the door. She pointed across the road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please go and see that&mdash;nothing happens,&rdquo; she
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the first moment we have let him out of our sight,&rdquo;
  Brendon exclaimed, as he hastened across the street.</p>

  <p>Hill sat up on the pavement and mopped the blood from his cheek.
  Ennison&rsquo;s signet-ring had cut nearly to the bone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean by coming for me like that?&rdquo;
  Ennison exclaimed, glowering down upon him. &ldquo;Serves you right if
  I&rsquo;d cracked your skull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hill looked up at him, an unkempt, rough-looking object, with broken
  collar, tumbled hair, and the blood slowly dripping from his face.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102"
     id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, hanging round with my wife?&rdquo; he answered
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>Ennison looked down on him in disgust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You silly fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know nothing about your
  wife. The young lady I was with is not married at all. Why don&rsquo;t you
  make sure before you rush out like that upon a stranger?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were with my wife,&rdquo; Hill repeated sullenly. &ldquo;I
  suppose you&rsquo;re like the rest of them. Call her Miss Pellissier, eh? I
  tell you she&rsquo;s my wife, and I&rsquo;ve got the certificate in my
  pocket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are,&rdquo; Ennison said quietly,
  &ldquo;but you are a thundering liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hill staggered to his feet and drew a folded paper from his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marriage certificates don&rsquo;t tell lies, at any rate,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Just look that through, will you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison took the document, tore it half in two without looking at it, and
  flung it back in Hill&rsquo;s face. Then he turned on his heel and walked
  off.</p>

  <h3>THE CHANGE IN &ldquo;ALCIDE&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;By-the-bye,&rdquo; his neighbour asked him languidly, &ldquo;who is
  our hostess?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Usually known, I believe, as Lady Ferringhall,&rdquo; Ennison
  answered, &ldquo;unless I have mixed up my engagement list and come to the
  wrong house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dull you are,&rdquo; the lady remarked. &ldquo;Of course I
  mean, who was she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe that her name was Pellissier,&rdquo; Ennison
  answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pellissier,&rdquo; she repeated thoughtfully. &ldquo;There were
  some Hampshire Pellissiers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is one of them,&rdquo; Ennison said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me! I wonder where Sir John picked her up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Paris, I think,&rdquo; Ennison answered. &ldquo;Only married a
  few months ago and lived out at Hampstead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; the lady exclaimed. &ldquo;I heard they came from
  somewhere outrageous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hampstead didn&rsquo;t suit Lady Ferringhall,&rdquo; Ennison
  remarked. &ldquo;They have just taken this house from Lady
  Cellender.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what are you doing here?&rdquo; the lady asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Politics!&rdquo; Ennison answered grimly. &ldquo;And
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Same thing. Besides, my husband has shares in Sir John&rsquo;s
  company. Do you know, I am beginning to believe that we only exist nowadays
  by the tolerance of these millionaire tradesmen. Our land brings us in
  nothing. We have to get them to let us in for the profits of their business,
  and in return we ask them to&mdash;dinner. By-the-bye, have you seen this new
  woman at the &lsquo;Empire&rsquo;? What is it they call
  her&mdash;&lsquo;Alcide?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have seen her,&rdquo; Ennison answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Every one raves about her,&rdquo; Lady Angela continued. &ldquo;For
  my part I can see no difference in any of these French girls who come over
  here with their demure manner and atrocious songs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alcide&rsquo;s songs are not atrocious,&rdquo; Ennison
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Lady Angela shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is unimportant,&rdquo; she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_104"
     id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> &ldquo;Nobody understands them, of
     course, but we all look as though we did. Something about this woman
     rather reminds me of our hostess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison thought so too half an hour later, when having cut out from one of
  the bridge tables he settled down for a chat with Annabel. Every now and then
  something familiar in her tone, the poise of her head, the play of her eyes
  startled him. Then he remembered that she was Anna&rsquo;s sister.</p>

  <p>He lowered his voice a little and leaned over towards her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Lady Ferringhall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know
  that I am a very great admirer of your sister&rsquo;s? I wonder if she has
  ever spoken to you of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The change in Lady Ferringhall&rsquo;s manner was subtle but unmistakable.
  She answered him almost coldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see nothing of my sister,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In Paris our
  lives were far apart, and we had seldom the same friends. I have heard of you
  from my husband. You are somebody&rsquo;s secretary, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was plain that the subject was distasteful to her, but Ennison,
  although famous in a small way for his social tact, did not at once discard
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not seen your sister lately,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I
  believe that you would find her in some respects curiously altered. I have
  never in my life been so much puzzled by any one as by your sister. Something
  has changed her tremendously.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean in looks?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;In Paris your sister
  appeared to me to be a charming student of frivolity. Here she seems to have
  developed into a brilliant woman with more character and steadfastness than I
  should ever have given her credit for. Her features are the same, yet the
  change has written its mark into her face. Do you know, Lady Ferringhall, I
  am proud that your sister permits me to call myself her friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And in Paris&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Paris,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;she was a very delightful
  companion, but beyond that&mdash;one did not take her seriously. I am not
  boring you, am I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to his and smiled into his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not boring me,&rdquo; she said,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_105"
     id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> &ldquo;but I would rather talk of
     something else. I suppose you will think me very unsisterly and
     cold-hearted, but there are circumstances in connexion with my
     sister&rsquo;s latest exploit which are intensely irritating both to my
     husband and to myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He recognized the force, almost the passion, which trembled in her tone,
  and he at once abandoned the subject. He remained talking with her however.
  It was easy for him to see that she desired to be agreeable to him. They
  talked lightly but confidentially until Sir John approached them with a
  slight frown upon his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Ennison,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is for you to cut in at Lady
  Angela&rsquo;s table. Anna, do you not see that the Countess is sitting
  alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose, and flashed a quick smile upon Ennison behind her
  husband&rsquo;s back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must come and see me some afternoon,&rdquo; she said to
  him.</p>

  <p>He murmured his delight, and joined the bridge party, where he played with
  less than his accustomed skill. On the way home he was still thoughtful. He
  turned in at the club. They were talking of &ldquo;Alcide,&rdquo; as they
  often did in those days.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has improved her style,&rdquo; someone declared.
  &ldquo;Certainly her voice is far more musical.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Another differed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has lost something,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;something which
  brought the men in crowds around the stage at the
  &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;d call
  it&mdash;a sort of witchery, almost suggestiveness. She sings better perhaps.
  But I don&rsquo;t think she lays hold of one so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you what there is about her which is so
  fetching,&rdquo; Drummond, who was lounging by, declared. &ldquo;She
  contrives somehow to strike the personal note in an amazing manner. You are
  wedged in amongst a crowd, perhaps in the promenade, you lean over the back,
  you are almost out of sight. Yet you catch her eye&mdash;you can&rsquo;t seem
  to escape from it. You feel that that smile is for you, the words are for
  you, the whole song is for you. Naturally you shout yourself hoarse when she
  has finished, and feel jolly pleased with yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if you are a millionaire like Drummond,&rdquo; someone
  remarked, &ldquo;you send round a note and ask her to come out to
  supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the present case,&rdquo; Drummond remarked, glancing across the
  room, &ldquo;Cheveney wouldn&rsquo;t permit it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison dropped the evening paper which he had been pretending to read.
  Cheveney strolled up, a pipe in his mouth.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106"
     id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cheveney wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to say about it, as it
  happens,&rdquo; he remarked, a little grimly. &ldquo;Ungracious little beast,
  I call her. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you chaps that except on the stage I
  haven&rsquo;t set eyes on her this side of the water. I&rsquo;ve called half
  a dozen times at her flat, and she won&rsquo;t see me. Rank ingratitude, I
  call it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a shout of laughter. Drummond patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, old chap,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope
  your successor is worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You fellows,&rdquo; Ennison said quietly, &ldquo;are getting a
  little wild. I have known Miss Pellissier as long as any of you perhaps, and
  I have seen something of her since her arrival in London. I consider her a
  very charming young woman&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t hear a word about Paris,
  for there are things I don&rsquo;t understand about that, but I will stake my
  word upon it that to-day Miss Pellissier is entitled not only to our
  admiration, but to our respect. I firmly believe that she is as straight as a
  die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison&rsquo;s voice shook a little. They were his friends, and they
  recognized his unusual earnestness. Drummond, who had been about to speak,
  refrained. Cheveney walked away with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe you are quite right so far as regards the present, at any
  rate,&rdquo; someone remarked, from the depths of an easy chair. &ldquo;You
  see, her sister is married to Ferringhall, isn&rsquo;t she? and she herself
  must be drawing no end of a good screw here. I always say that it&rsquo;s
  poverty before everything that makes a girl skip the line.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison escaped. He was afraid if he stayed that he would make a fool of
  himself. He walked through the misty September night to his rooms. On his way
  he made a slight divergence from the direct route and paused for a moment
  outside the flat where Anna was now living. It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock;
  but there were lights still in all her windows. Suddenly the door of the flat
  opened and closed. A man came out, and walking recklessly, almost cannoned
  into Ennison. He mumbled an apology and then stopped short.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ennison, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
  &ldquo;What the devil are you doing star-gazing here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might return the compliment, Courtlaw,&rdquo; he answered,
  &ldquo;by asking why the devil you come lurching on to the pavement like a
  drunken man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107"
     id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

  <p>Courtlaw was pale and dishevelled. He was carelessly dressed, and there
  were marks of unrest upon his features. He pointed to where the lights still
  burned in Anna&rsquo;s windows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of that farce?&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly.
  &ldquo;You are one of those who must know all about it. Was there ever such
  madness?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Ennison answered.
  &ldquo;You seem to have come from Miss Pellissier&rsquo;s rooms. I had no
  idea even that she was a friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw laughed hardly. His eyes were red. He was in a curious state of
  desperation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor am I now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have spoken too many
  truths to-night. Why do women take to lies and deceit and trickery as
  naturally as a duck to water?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not alluding, I hope, to Miss Pellissier?&rdquo; Ennison
  said stiffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Isn&rsquo;t the whole thing a lie? Isn&rsquo;t her
  reputation, this husband of hers, the &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; business,
  isn&rsquo;t it all a cursed juggle? She hasn&rsquo;t the right to do it.
  I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped short. He had the air of a man who has said too much. Ennison
  was deeply interested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to understand you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew Miss
  Pellissier in Paris at the &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and I know her
  now, but I am convinced that there is some mystery in connexion with her
  change of life. She is curiously altered in many ways. Is there any truth, do
  you suppose, in this rumoured marriage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; Courtlaw answered hurriedly. &ldquo;Ask me
  nothing. I will not talk to you about Miss Pellissier or her
  affairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not yourself to-night, Courtlaw,&rdquo; Ennison said.
  &ldquo;Come to my rooms and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw refused brusquely, almost rudely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am off to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to America. I
  have work there. I ought to have gone long ago. Will you answer me a question
  first?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; Ennison said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What were you doing outside Miss Pellissier&rsquo;s flat to-night?
  You were looking at her windows. Why? What is she to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was there by accident,&rdquo; Ennison answered. &ldquo;Miss
  Pellissier is nothing to me except a young lady for whom I have the most
  profound and respectful admiration.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw laid his hand upon Ennison&rsquo;s shoulder. They <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_108"
     id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>were at the corner of Pall Mall now, and
     had come to a standstill.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;Call it warning, if
  you like. Admire her as much as you choose&mdash;at a distance. No more. Look
  at me. You knew me in Paris. David Courtlaw. Well-balanced, sane,
  wasn&rsquo;t I? You never heard anyone call me a madman? I&rsquo;m pretty
  near being one now, and it&rsquo;s her fault. I&rsquo;ve loved her for two
  years, I love her now. And I&rsquo;m off to America, and if my steamer goes
  to the bottom of the Atlantic I&rsquo;ll thank the Lord for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He strode away and vanished in the gathering fog. Ennison stood still for
  a moment, swinging his latchkey upon his finger. Then he turned round and
  gazed thoughtfully at the particular spot in the fog where Courtlaw had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m d&mdash;&mdash;d if I understand this,&rdquo; he said
  thoughtfully. &ldquo;I never saw Courtlaw with her&mdash;never heard her
  speak of him. He was going to tell me something&mdash;and he shut up. I
  wonder what it was.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>ANNABEL AND &ldquo;ALCIDE&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>Lady Ferringhall lifted her eyes to the newcomer, and the greeting in them
  was obviously meant for him alone. She continued to fan herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are late,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My chief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;took it into his head to have an
  impromptu dinner party. He brought home a few waverers to talk to them where
  they had no chance of getting away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am bored,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;This is a very foolish
  sort of entertainment. And, as usual,&rdquo; she continued, a little
  bitterly, &ldquo;I seem to have been sent along with the dullest and least
  edifying of Mrs. Montressor&rsquo;s guests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison glanced at the other people in the box and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got your note just in time,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I knew of
  course that you were at the Montressor&rsquo;s, but I had no idea that it was
  a music hall party afterwards. Are you all here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five boxes full,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Some of them seem to
  be having an awfully good time too. Did you see Lord Delafield and Miss
  Anderson? They packed me in with Colonel Anson and Mrs. Hitchings, who seem
  to be absolutely engrossed in one another, and a boy of about seventeen, who
  no sooner got here than he discovered that he wanted to see a man in the
  promenade and disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison at once seated himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feel justified then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in annexing his
  chair. I expect you had been snubbing him terribly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, he was presumptuous,&rdquo; Annabel remarked, &ldquo;and he
  wasn&rsquo;t nice about it. I wonder how it is,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that
  boys always make love so impertinently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how you would like to be made love
  to&mdash;boldly or timorously or sentimentally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you master of all three methods?&rdquo; she asked, stopping her
  fanning for a moment to look at him.</p>

  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Mine is a primitive and
  unstudied manner. It needs cultivating, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His fingers touched hers for a moment under the ledge of the box.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds so uncouth,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I detest
  amateurs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will buy books and a lay figure,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;to
  practise upon. Or shall I ask Colonel Anson for a few hints?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake no,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I would
  rather put up with your own efforts, however clumsy. Love-making at first
  hand is dull enough. At second hand it would be unendurable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He leaned towards her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that a challenge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders, all ablaze with jewels.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? It might amuse me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Somewhat irrelevantly he glanced at the next few boxes where the rest of
  Mrs. Montressor&rsquo;s guests were.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is your husband here to-night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My husband!&rdquo; she laughed a little derisively. &ldquo;No, he
  wouldn&rsquo;t come here of all places&mdash;just now. He dined, and then
  pleaded a political engagement. I was supposed to do the same, but I
  didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said with some hesitation, &ldquo;that your
  sister is singing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. I want to hear how she does it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She does it magnificently,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I
  think&mdash;we all think that she is wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the first night I saw you,
  you spoke of my sister as your friend. Have you seen much of her
  lately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>The small grey feathers of her exquisitely shaped fan waved gently
  backwards and forwards. She was watching him intently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that every one is remarking
  how ill you look. I too can see it. What has been the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Toothache,&rdquo; he answered laconically.</p>

  <p>She looked away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You might at least,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;have invented a
  more romantic reason.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111"
     id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I might,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;have gone further still. I
  might have told you the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has my sister been unkind to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The family,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;has not treated me with
  consideration.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You promised faithfully to be there,&rdquo; he said slowly.
  &ldquo;I loathe afternoon concerts, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was really like her sister he thought, impressed for a moment by the
  soft brilliancy of her smile. Her fingers rested upon his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were really at Moulton House,&rdquo; she exclaimed penitently.
  &ldquo;I am so sorry. I had a perfect shoal of callers. People who would not
  go. I only arrived when everybody was coming away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A little murmur of expectation, an audible silence announced the coming of
  &ldquo;Alcide.&rdquo; Then a burst of applause. She was standing there,
  smiling at the audience as at her friends. From the first there had always
  been between her and her listeners that electrical sympathy which only a
  certain order of genius seems able to create. Then she sang.</p>

  <p>Ennison listened, and his eyes glowed. Lady Ferringhall listened, and her
  cheeks grew pale. Her whole face stiffened with suppressed anger. She forgot
  Anna&rsquo;s sacrifices, forgot her own callousness, forgot the burden which
  she had fastened upon her sister&rsquo;s shoulders. She was fiercely and
  bitterly jealous. Anna was singing as she used to sing. She was <i>chic</i>,
  distinguished, unusual. What right had she to call herself
  &ldquo;Alcide&rdquo;? It was abominable, an imposture. Ennison listened, and
  he forgot where he was. He forgot Annabel&rsquo;s idle attempts at
  love-making, all the <i>cul-de-sac</i> gallantry of the moment. The
  cultivated indifference, which was part of the armour of his little world
  fell away from him. He leaned forward, and looked into the eyes of the woman
  he loved, and it seemed to him that she sang back to him with a sudden note
  of something like passion breaking here and there through the gay mocking
  words which flowed with such effortless and seductive music from her
  lips.</p>

  <p>Neither of them joined in the applause which followed upon her exit. They
  were both conscious, however, that something had intervened between them.
  Their conversation became stilted. A spot of colour, brighter than any rouge,
  burned on her cheeks.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112"
     id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is marvellously clever,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She appears to be very popular here,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You too sing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have given it up,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;One genius in the
  family is enough.&rdquo; After a pause, she added, &ldquo;Do you mind
  fetching back my recalcitrant cavalier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anything except that,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I was half hoping
  that I might be allowed to see you home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you can tear yourself away from this delightful place in five
  minutes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I think I can get rid of the
  others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will do it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;If only Sir John were not
  Sir John I would ask you to come and have some supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imperil my reputation before I am established,&rdquo;
  she answered, smiling. &ldquo;Afterwards it seems to me that there are no
  limits to what one may not do amongst one&rsquo;s own set.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am frightened of Sir John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I suggest
  that we risk it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tempt me,&rdquo; she said, laughing, and drawing her
  opera-cloak together. &ldquo;You shall drive home with me in a hansom, if you
  will. That is quite as far as I mean to tempt Providence to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>Again on his way homeward from Cavendish Square he abandoned the direct
  route to pass by the door of Anna&rsquo;s flat. Impassive by nature and
  training, he was conscious to-night of a strange sense of excitement, of
  exhilaration tempered by a dull background of disappointment. Her sister had
  told him that it was true. Anna was married. After all, she was a consummate
  actress. Her recent attitude towards him was undoubtedly a pose. His long
  struggle with himself, his avoidance of her were quite unnecessary. There was
  no longer any risk in association with her. His pulses beat fast as he
  walked, his feet fell lightly upon the pavement. He slackened his pace as he
  reached the flat. The windows were still darkened&mdash;perhaps she was not
  home yet. He lit a cigarette and loitered about. He laughed once or twice at
  himself as he paced backwards and forwards. He felt like a boy again, the
  taste for adventures was keen upon his palate, the whole undiscovered world
  of rhythmical things, of love and poetry and passion seemed again to him a
  real and actual place, and he himself an adventurer upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>Then a hansom drove up, and his heart gave a great leap. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_113"
     id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>She stepped on to the pavement almost
     before him, and his blood turned almost to ice as he saw that she was not
     alone. A young man turned to pay the cabman. Then she saw him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Ennison,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;is that really
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no sign of embarrassment in her manner. She held out her hand
  frankly. She seemed honestly glad to see him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How odd that I should almost spring into your arms just on my
  doorstep!&rdquo; she remarked gaily. &ldquo;Are you in a hurry? Will you come
  in and have some coffee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and glanced towards her companion. He saw now that it was
  merely a boy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Sydney Courtlaw&mdash;Mr. Ennison,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;You are coming in, aren&rsquo;t you, Sydney?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I may,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your coffee&rsquo;s too good
  to refuse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She led the way, talking all the time to Ennison.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know, I have been wondering what had become of you,&rdquo;
  she said. &ldquo;I had those beautiful roses from you on my first night, and
  a tiny little note but no address. I did not even know where to write and
  thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been abroad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The life of a private
  secretary is positively one of slavery. I had to go at a moment&rsquo;s
  notice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad that you have a reasonable excuse for not having been to
  see me,&rdquo; she said good-humouredly. &ldquo;Please make yourselves
  comfortable while I see to the coffee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a tiny little room, daintily furnished, individual in its quaint
  colouring, and the masses of perfumed flowers set in strange and unexpected
  places. A great bowl of scarlet carnations gleamed from a dark corner, set
  against the background of a deep brown wall. A jar of pink roses upon a tiny
  table seemed to gain an extra delicacy of colour from the sombre curtains
  behind. Anna, who had thrown aside her sealskin coat, wore a tight-fitting
  walking dress of some dark shade. He leaned back in a low chair, and watched
  her graceful movements, the play of her white hands as she bent over some
  wonderful machine. A woman indeed this to love and be loved, beautiful,
  graceful, gay. A dreamy sense of content crept over him. The ambitions of his
  life, and they were many, seemed to lie far away, broken up dreams in some
  outside world where the way was rough and the sky always grey. A little table
  covered with a damask cloth was dragged out. There were cakes and
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114"
     id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>sandwiches&mdash;for Ennison a sort of
     Elysian feast, long to be remembered. They talked lightly and smoked
     cigarettes till Anna, with a little laugh, threw open the window and let
     in the cool night air.</p>

  <p>Ennison stood by her side. They looked out over the city, grim and silent
  now, for it was long past midnight. For a moment her thoughts led her back to
  the evening when she and Courtlaw had stood together before the window of her
  studio in Paris, before the coming of Sir John had made so many changes in
  her life. She was silent, the ghost of a fading smile passed from her lips.
  She had made her way since then a little further into the heart of life. Yet
  even now there were so many things untouched, so much to be learned. To-night
  she had a curious feeling that she stood upon the threshold of some change.
  The great untrodden world was before her still, into which no one can pass
  alone. She felt a new warmth in her blood, a strange sense of elation crept
  over her. Sorrows and danger and disappointment she had known. Perhaps the
  day of her recompense was at hand. She glanced into her companion&rsquo;s
  face, and she saw there strange things. For a moment her heart seemed to stop
  beating. Then she dropped the curtain and stepped back into the room. Sydney
  was strumming over a new song which stood upon the piano.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you mean to stay until you
  are turned out. Do you see the time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I may come and see you?&rdquo; Ennison asked, as his hand touched
  hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, looking away. &ldquo;Some
  afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115"
     id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XIX"
     id="Chapter_XIX"></a><i>Chapter XIX</i></h2>

  <h3>&ldquo;THIS IS NOT THE END&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;I said some afternoon,&rdquo; she remarked, throwing open her warm
  coat, and taking off her gloves, &ldquo;but I certainly did not mean to-
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I met you accidentally,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;Our ways
  happened to lie together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And our destinations also, it seems,&rdquo; she added, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You asked me in to tea,&rdquo; he protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In self-defence I had to,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It is a
  delightful day for walking, but a great deal too cold to be standing on the
  pavement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, reaching out his hand tentatively for
  his hat, &ldquo;I could go away even now. Your reputation for hospitality
  would remain under a cloud though, for tea was distinctly
  mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you had better ring the bell,&rdquo; she declared, laughing.
  &ldquo;The walk has given me an appetite, and I do not feel like waiting till
  five o&rsquo;clock. I wonder why on earth the curtains are drawn. It is quite
  light yet, and I want to have one more look at that angry red sun. Would you
  mind drawing them back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison sprang up, but he never reached the curtains. They were suddenly
  thrown aside, and a man stepped out from his hiding-place. A little
  exclamation of surprise escaped Ennison. Anna sprang to her feet with a
  startled cry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What are you doing here? How dare
  you come to my rooms!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man stepped into the middle of the room. The last few months had not
  dealt kindly with Mr. Montague Hill. He was still flashily dressed, with much
  obvious jewellery and the shiniest of patent boots, but his general bearing
  and appearance had altered for the worse. His cheeks were puffy, and his eyes
  blood-shot. He had the appearance of a man who has known no rest for many
  nights. His voice when he spoke was almost fiercely assertive, but there was
  an undernote of nervousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_116"
     id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> &ldquo;I have the right to be here. I
     hid because there was no other way of seeing you. I did not reckon
     upon&mdash;him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pointed to Ennison, who in his turn looked across at Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wish me to stay?&rdquo; he asked, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would not have you go for anything,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; Hill said doggedly, &ldquo;I am here to speak
  to you alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you do not leave the room at once,&rdquo; Anna answered calmly,
  &ldquo;I shall ring the bell for a policeman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He raised his hand, and they saw that he was holding a small revolver.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need not be alarmed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not wish to
  use this. I came here peaceably, and I only ask for a few words with you. But
  I mean to have them. No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison had moved stealthily a little nearer to him, and looked suddenly
  into the dark muzzle of the revolver.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you interfere between us,&rdquo; the man said, &ldquo;it will go
  hardly with you. This lady is my wife, and I have a right to be here. I have
  the right also to throw you out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br />

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203111h-images/Anna11.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration" />
  </div>

  <p>Ennison obeyed Anna&rsquo;s gesture, and was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can say what you have to say before Mr. Ennison, if at
  all,&rdquo; Anna declared calmly. &ldquo;In any case, I decline to see you
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I have come to tell you
  this. You are my wife, and I am determined to claim you. We were properly
  married, and the certificate is at my lawyer&rsquo;s. I am not a madman, or a
  pauper, or even an unreasonable person. I know that you were disappointed
  because I did not turn out to be the millionaire. Perhaps I deceived you
  about it. However, that&rsquo;s over and done with. I&rsquo;ll make any
  reasonable arrangement you like. I don&rsquo;t want to stop your singing. You
  can live just about how you like. But you belong to me&mdash;and I want
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment, and then suddenly continued. His voice had broken.
  He spoke in quick nervous sentences.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did your best to kill me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You might have
  given me a chance, anyway. I&rsquo;m not such a bad sort. You know&mdash;I
  worship you. I have done from the first moment I saw you. I can&rsquo;t rest
  or work or settle down to anything while things are like this between you and
  me. I want you. I&rsquo;ve got to have you, and by God I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took a quick step forward. Anna held out her hand, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_117"
     id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>and he paused. There was something which
     chilled even him in the cold impassivity of her features.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have heard these things from you
  before, and you have had my answer. Understand once and for all that that
  answer is final. I do not admit the truth of a word which you have said. I
  will not be persecuted in this way by you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not deny that you are my wife,&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.
  &ldquo;You cannot! Oh, you cannot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have denied it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Why will you not be
  sensible? Go back to your old life and your old friends, and forget all about
  Paris and this absurd delusion of yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Delusion!&rdquo; he muttered, glaring at her.
  &ldquo;Delusion!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can call it what you like,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In any case
  you will never receive any different sort of answer from me. Stay where you
  are, Mr. Ennison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a swift movement she gained the bell and rang it. The man&rsquo;s
  hand flashed out, but immediately afterwards an oath and a cry of pain broke
  from his lips. The pistol fell to the floor. Ennison kicked it away with his
  foot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall send for a policeman,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;directly my
  maid answers the bell&mdash;unless you choose to go before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man made no attempt to recover the revolver. He walked unsteadily
  towards the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will go. But,&rdquo; and he
  faced them both with a still expressionless glance, &ldquo;this is not the
  end!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>Anna recovered her spirits with marvellous facility. It was Ennison who
  for the rest of his visit was quiet and subdued.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are absurd,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It was unpleasant while
  it lasted, but it is over&mdash;and my toasted scones are delicious. Do have
  another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is over for now,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I cannot bear to
  think that you are subject to this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly. Some of the delicate colour which the
  afternoon walk had brought into her cheeks had already returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is an annoyance, my friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not a
  tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It might become one,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The man is
  dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118"
     id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said,
     &ldquo;that he must have a skeleton key to these rooms. If so I shall have
     to leave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cannot play at hide-and-seek with this creature all your
  life,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Let your friends act for you. There must be
  ways of getting rid of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that it would be
  difficult. He really deserves a better fate, does he not? He is so
  beautifully persistent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He drew a little nearer to her. The lamp was not yet lit, and in the dim
  light he bent forward as though trying to look into her averted face. He
  touched her hand, soft and cool to his fingers&mdash;she turned at once to
  look at him. Her eyes were perhaps a little brighter than usual, the
  firelight played about her hair, there seemed to him to be a sudden softening
  of the straight firm mouth. Nevertheless she withdrew her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Indeed, you could have no
  more faithful friend, you could find no one more anxious to serve
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her hand fell back into her lap. He touched it again, and this time it was
  not withdrawn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is very nice of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it is so
  difficult&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered eagerly. &ldquo;I wish you would
  come and see my lawyers. Of course I know nothing of what really did happen
  in Paris&mdash;if even you ever saw him there. You need not tell me, but a
  lawyer is different. His client&rsquo;s story is safe with him. He would
  advise you how to get rid of the fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will think of it,&rdquo; she promised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must do more than think of it,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;It is
  intolerable that you should be followed about by such a creature. I am sure
  that he can be got rid of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at him. Her face scarcely reflected his
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may be more difficult than you think,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;You see you do not know how much of truth there is in his
  story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it were all true,&rdquo; he said doggedly, &ldquo;it may still
  be possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will think of it,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I cannot say
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They talked for a while in somewhat dreamy fashion, Anna especially being
  more silent than usual. At last she glanced at a little clock in the corner
  of the room, and sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens, look at the time!&rdquo; she exclaimed.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_119"
     id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> &ldquo;It is incredible. I shall barely
     be in time for the theatre. I must go and dress at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He too rose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will wait for you on the pavement, if you like,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;but I am going to the &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo; with you. Your maid would
  not be of the least protection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your dinner!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You will be so
  late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cannot seriously believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that at the
  present moment I care a snap of the fingers whether I have any dinner or
  not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly did very well at tea,&rdquo; she remarked.
  &ldquo;If you really are going to wait, make yourself as comfortable as you
  can. There are cigarettes and magazines in the corner there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna disappeared, but Ennison did not trouble either the cigarettes or the
  magazines. He sat back in an easy chair with a hand upon each of the elbows,
  and looked steadfastly into the fire.</p>

  <p>People spoke of him everywhere as a young man of great promise, a
  politician by instinct, a keen and careful judge of character. Yet he was in
  a state of hopeless bewilderment. He was absolutely unable to focus his
  ideas. The girl who had just left the room was as great a mystery to him now
  as on the afternoon when he had met her in Piccadilly and taken her to tea.
  And behind&mdash;there was Paris, memories of amazing things, memories which
  made his cheeks burn and his heart beat quickly as he sat there waiting for
  her. For the first time a definite doubt possessed him. A woman cannot change
  her soul. Then it was the woman herself who was changed. Anna was not
  &ldquo;Alcide&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s,&rdquo; whose subtly
  demure smile and piquant glances had called him to her side from the moment
  of their first meeting. It was impossible.</p>

  <p>She came in while he was still in the throes, conviction battling with
  common-sense, his own apprehension. He rose at once to his feet and turned a
  white face upon her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am going to break a covenant,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I cannot
  keep silence any longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are going to speak to me of things which happened before we met
  in London?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I must! The thing is becoming a torture to me. I
  must!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120"

  <p>She threw open the door and pointed to it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My word holds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you
  speak&mdash;farewell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood quite silent for a moment, his eyes fixed upon her face.
  Something he saw there had a curious effect upon him. He was suddenly
  calm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall not speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now or at any other time.
  Come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went out together and he called a hansom. From the opposite corner
  under the trees a man with his hat slouched over his eyes stood and glowered
  at them.</p>

  <h3>ANNA&rsquo;S SURRENDER</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;This is indeed a gala night,&rdquo; said Ennison, raising his
  glass, and watching for a moment the golden bubbles. &ldquo;Was it really
  only this afternoon that I met you in St. James&rsquo; Park?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna nodded, and made a careful selection from a dish of quails.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was just an hour before teatime,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I
  have had nothing since, and it seems a very long time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An appetite like yours,&rdquo; he said resignedly, &ldquo;is fatal
  to all sentiment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;I find the two
  inseparable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have noticed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you seem to delight in
  taking a topsy-turvy view of life. It arises, I think, from an over developed
  sense of humour. You would find things to laugh at even in Artemus
  Ward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not understand me at all,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I
  think that you are very dense. Besides, your remark is not in the least
  complimentary. I have always understood that men avoid like the plague a
  woman with a sense of humour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So they talked on whilst supper was served, falling easily into the spirit
  of the place, and yet both of them conscious of some new thing underlying the
  gaiety of their tongues and manner. Anna, in her strange striking way, was
  radiantly beautiful. Without a single ornament about her neck, or hair,
  wearing the plainest of black gowns, out of which her shoulders shone
  gleaming white, she was easily the most noticeable and the most
  distinguished-looking woman in the room. To-night there seemed to be a new
  brilliancy in her eyes, a deeper quality in her tone. She was herself
  conscious of a recklessness of spirits almost hysterical. Perhaps, after all,
  the others were right. Perhaps she had found this new thing in life, the
  thing wonderful. The terrors and anxieties of the last few months seemed to
  have fallen from her, to have passed away like an ugly dream, dismissed with
  a shudder even from the memory. An <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122"
     id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>acute sense of living was in her veins,
     even the taste of her wine seemed magical. Ennison too, always handsome
     and <i>debonnair</i>, seemed transported out of his calm self. His tongue
     was more ready, his wit more keen than usual. He said daring things with a
     grace which made them irresistible, his eyes flashed back upon her some
     eloquent but silent appreciation of the change in her manner towards
     him.</p>

  <p>And then there came for both of them at least a temporary awakening. It
  was he who saw them first coming down the room&mdash;Annabel in a wonderful
  white satin gown in front, and Sir John stiff, unbending, disapproving,
  bringing up the rear. He bent over to Anna at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is your sister and her husband,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are
  coming past our table.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel saw Ennison first, and noticing his single companion calmly
  ignored him. Then making a pretence of stooping to rearrange her flowing
  train, she glanced at Anna, and half stopped in her progress down the room.
  Sir John followed her gaze, and also saw them. His face clouded with
  anger.</p>

  <p>It was after all a momentary affair. Annabel passed on with a strained nod
  to her sister, and Sir John&rsquo;s bow was a miracle of icy displeasure.
  They vanished through the doorway. Anna and her escort exchanged glances.
  Almost simultaneously they burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Limp,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I deserve to.
  I was engaged to dine with your sister and her husband, and I sent a
  wire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was exceedingly wrong of you,&rdquo; Anna declared.
  &ldquo;Before I came to England I was told that there were two things which
  an Englishman who was <i>comme-il-faut</i> never did. The first was to break
  a dinner engagement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the second?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make love to a single woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your knowledge of our ways,&rdquo; he murmured &ldquo;is profound.
  Yet, I suppose that at the present moment I am the most envied man in the
  room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her eyes were lit with humour. To have spoken lightly on such a subject a
  few hours ago would have seemed incredible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you do not know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;whether I am a
  married woman or not. There is Mr. Montague Hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lights were lowered, and an attentive waiter hovered round
  Anna&rsquo;s cloak. They left the room amongst the last, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_123"
     id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>and Ennison had almost to elbow his way
     through a group of acquaintances who had all some pretext for detaining
     him, to which he absolutely refused to listen. They entered a hansom and
     turned on to the Embankment. The two great hotels on their right were
     still ablaze with lights. On their left the river, with its gloomy pile of
     buildings on the opposite side, and a huge revolving advertisement
     throwing its strange reflection upon the black water. A fresh cool breeze
     blew in their faces. Anna leaned back with half closed eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Delicious!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>His fingers closed upon her hand. She yielded it without protest, as
  though unconsciously. Not a word passed between them. It seemed to him that
  speech would be an anticlimax.</p>

  <p>He paid the cab, and turned to follow her. She passed inside and upstairs
  without a word. In her little sitting-room she turned on the electric light
  and looked around half fearfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please search everywhere,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am going
  through the other rooms. I shall not let you go till I am quite
  sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he has a key,&rdquo; Ennison said, &ldquo;how are you to be
  safe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had bolts fitted on the doors yesterday,&rdquo; she answered.
  &ldquo;If he is not here now I can make myself safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was certain that he was not there. Anna came back into the sitting-room
  with a little sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was very fortunate that I should
  have met you this afternoon. Either Sydney or Mr. Brendon always comes home
  with me, and to-night both are away. Mary is very good, but she is too
  nervous to be the slightest protection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; he answered, in a low tone. &ldquo;It has
  been a delightful evening for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And for me,&rdquo; Anna echoed.</p>

  <p>A curious silence ensued. Anna was sitting before the fire a little
  distance from him&mdash;Ennison himself remained standing. Some shadow of
  reserve seemed to have crept up between them. She laughed nervously, but kept
  her eyes averted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is strange that we should have met Annabel,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;I am afraid your broken dinner engagement will not be so easy to
  explain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was very indifferent. In fact he was thinking of other things.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be impertinent. I do not
  understand why you and your sister should not see more of one another. You
  must be lonely here with only a few men friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124"
     id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&ldquo;Loneliness,&rdquo; she said,
     &ldquo;is a luxury which I never permit myself. Besides&mdash;there is Sir
     John.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir John is an ass!&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is Annabel&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel!&rdquo; He looked at her thoughtfully. &ldquo;It is rather
  odd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I always thought that your name was Annabel
  and hers Anna.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many other people,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;have made the same
  mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going to be impertinent. I never
  met your sister in Paris, but I heard about her more than once. She is not in
  the least like the descriptions of her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has changed a good deal,&rdquo; Anna admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is some mystery about you both,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with
  sudden earnestness. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t interrupt me. Why may I not be
  your friend? Somehow or other I feel that you have been driven into a false
  position. You represent to me an enigma, the solution of which has become the
  one desire of my life. I want to give you warning that I have set myself to
  solve it. To-morrow I am going to Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She seemed unmoved, but she did not look at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Paris! But why? What do you hope to discover there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I am going to see
  David Courtlaw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then she looked up at him with frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;David Courtlaw!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What has he to do with
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was your sister&rsquo;s master&mdash;her friend. A few days ago
  I saw him leave your house. He was like a man beside himself. He began to
  tell me something&mdash;and stopped. I am going to ask him to finish
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forbid it!&rdquo; she said firmly.</p>

  <p>They were standing face to face now upon the hearthrug. She was very pale,
  and there was a look of fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you as much as this,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;There
  is a secret. I admit it. Set yourself to find it out, if you will&mdash;but
  if you do, never dare to call yourself my friend again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is for your good&mdash;your good only I am thinking,&rdquo; he
  declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let me be the judge of what is best,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>He was silent. He felt his heart beat faster and faster&mdash;his
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125"
     id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>self- restraint slipping away. After all,
     what did it matter?&mdash;it or anything else in the world? She was within
     reach of his arms, beautiful, compelling, herself as it seemed suddenly
     conscious of the light which was burning in his eyes. A quick flush
     stained her cheeks. She put out her hands to avoid his embrace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You must not. It is
  impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His arms were around her. He only laughed his defiance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will make it possible,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will make all
  things possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna was bewildered. She did not know herself. Only she was conscious of
  an unfamiliar and wonderful emotion. She gave her lips to his without
  resistance. All her protests seemed stifled before she could find words to
  utter them. With a little sigh of happiness she accepted this new thing.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXI"
     id="Chapter_XXI"></a><i>Chapter XXI</i></h2>

  <h3>HER SISTER&rsquo;S SECRET</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Lady Ferringhall said, &ldquo;that you are talking
  very foolishly. I was quite as much annoyed as you were to see Mr. Ennison
  with my sister last night. But apart from that, you have no particular
  objection to him, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The occurrence of last night is quite sufficient in itself,&rdquo;
  Sir John answered, &ldquo;to make me wish to discontinue Mr. Ennison&rsquo;s
  acquaintance. I should think, Anna, that your own sense&mdash;er&mdash;of
  propriety would enable you to see this. It is not possible for us to be on
  friendly terms with a young man who has been seen in a public place, having
  supper alone with your sister after midnight. The fact itself is regrettable
  enough&mdash;regrettable, I fear, is quite an inadequate word. To receive him
  here afterwards would be most repugnant to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He probably does not know of the relationship,&rdquo; Annabel
  remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; Sir John said, &ldquo;that your sister would
  acquaint him with it. In any case, he is liable to discover it at any time.
  My own impression is that he already knows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I noticed him call her attention to us as we passed down the
  room,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Of course he may merely have been telling
  her who we were, but I think it improbable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apart from the fact of his acquaintance with
  Anna&mdash;Annabel,&rdquo; Lady Ferringhall said quickly, &ldquo;may I ask if
  you have any other objection to Mr. Ennison?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the young man himself,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;no! I simply
  object to his calling here two or three times a week during my
  absence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; Annabel declared.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_127"
     id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> &ldquo;How could he call except in your
     absence, as you are never at home in the afternoon. And if I cared to have
     him come every day, why shouldn&rsquo;t he? I find him very amusing and
     very useful as well. He brought his mother to call, and as you know the
     Countess goes scarcely anywhere. Hers is quite the most exclusive set in
     London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My feeling in the matter,&rdquo; Sir John said, &ldquo;is as I have
  stated. Further, I do not care for you to accept social obligations from Mr.
  Ennison, or any other young man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are jealous,&rdquo; she declared contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I am,&rdquo; he answered, reddening, &ldquo;you can scarcely
  assert that it is without a cause. You will forgive my remarking, Anna, that
  I consider there is a great change in your manner towards me and your general
  deportment since our marriage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t that a
  foregone conclusion?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You treat the matter lightly,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;To me it
  seems serious enough. I have fulfilled my part of our marriage contract. Can
  you wonder that I expect you to fulfil yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not aware,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that I have ever failed
  in doing so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are at least aware,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have on
  several recent occasions acted in direct opposition to my wishes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For example?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your dyed hair. I was perfectly satisfied with your appearance. I
  consider even now that the present colour is far less becoming. Then you have
  altered not only that, but your manner of dressing it. You have darkened your
  eyebrows, you have even changed your style of dress. You have shown an almost
  feverish anxiety to eliminate from your personal appearance all that reminded
  me of you&mdash;when we first met.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has there not been some reason for
  this? The likeness to Annabel could scarcely have escaped remark. You forget
  that every one is going to the &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo; to see her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He frowned heavily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish that I could forget it,&rdquo; he said.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_128"
     id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> &ldquo;Fortunately I believe that the
     relationship is not generally known. I trust that no unpleasant rumours
     will be circulated before the election, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel yawned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They might do you good,&rdquo; she remarked.
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; is very popular.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John turned towards the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It does not appear to me,&rdquo; he said, stiffly, &ldquo;to be an
  affair for jests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed derisively and took up her book. She heard her
  husband&rsquo;s heavy tread descending the stairs, and the wheels of his
  carriage as he drove off. Then she threw the volume away with a little
  impatient exclamation. She rose from her chair, and began walking up and down
  the room restlessly. Every now and then she fingered an ornament, moved a
  piece of furniture, or rearranged some draperies. Once she stopped in front
  of a mirror and looked at herself thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am getting plain,&rdquo; she said, with a little shudder.
  &ldquo;This life is killing me! Oh, it is dull, dull, dull!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly an idea seemed to strike her. She went to her room and changed
  the loose morning gown in which she had lunched for a dark walking dress. A
  few minutes later she left the house on foot, and taking a hansom at the
  corner of the Square, drove to Anna&rsquo;s flat.</p>

  <p>Anna was having tea by herself when she entered. She rose at once with a
  little exclamation, half of surprise, half of pleasure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Annabel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is delightful, but I
  thought that it was forbidden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Annabel answered shortly. &ldquo;But I wanted to see
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna wheeled an easy chair to the fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will have some tea?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Annabel ignored both the chair and the invitation. She was looking about
  her, and her face was dark with anger. The little room was fragrant with
  flowers, Anna herself bright, and with all the evidences of well being.
  Annabel was conscious then of the slow anger which had been burning within
  her since the night of her visit to the &ldquo;Unusual.&rdquo; Her voice
  trembled with suppressed passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come for an explanation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are an
  impostor. How dare you use my name and sing my songs?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked at her sister in blank amazement.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129"
     id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>&ldquo;Annabel!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
     &ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a hypocrite.
  You are not &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; You have no right to call yourself
  &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; You used to declare that you hated the name. You used
  to beg me for hours at a time to give it all up, never to go near the
  &lsquo;Ambassador&rsquo;s&rsquo; again. And yet the moment I am safely out of
  the way you are content to dress yourself in my rags, to go and get yourself
  popular and admired and successful, all on my reputation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel! Annabel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel stamped her foot. Her tone was hoarse with passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you can act!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You can look as innocent
  and shocked as you please. I want to know who sent you those.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She pointed with shaking fingers to a great bunch of dark red carnations,
  thrust carelessly into a deep china bowl, to which the card was still
  attached. Anna followed her finger, and looked back into her sister&rsquo;s
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were sent to me by Mr. Nigel Ennison, Annabel. How on earth
  does it concern you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Concern me!&rdquo; she repeated fiercely. &ldquo;You are not
  content then with stealing from me my name. You would steal from me then the
  only man I ever cared a snap of the fingers about. They are not your flowers.
  They are mine! They were sent to &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; not to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna rose to her feet. At last she was roused. Her cheeks were flushed,
  and her eyes bright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are my sister, or I would bid
  you take the flowers if you care for them, and leave the room. But behind
  these things which you have said to me there must be others of which I know
  nothing. You speak as one injured&mdash;as though I had been the one to take
  your name&mdash;as though you had been the one to make sacrifices. In your
  heart you know very well that this is absurd. It is you who took my name, not
  I yours. It is I who took the burden of your misdeeds upon my shoulders that
  you might become Lady Ferringhall. It is I who am persecuted by the man who
  calls himself your husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel shivered a little and looked around her.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130"
     id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;He does not come here,&rdquo; she exclaimed, quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He spends hours of every day on the pavement below,&rdquo; Anna
  answered calmly. &ldquo;I have been bearing this&mdash;for your sake. Shall I
  send him to Sir John?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel was white to the lips, but her anger was not yet spent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was your own fault,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He would never
  have found you out if you had not personated me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Anna whispered quietly, &ldquo;we met in a
  small boarding-house where I was stopping.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not told me yet,&rdquo; Annabel said, &ldquo;how it is
  that you have dared to personate me. To call yourself &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo;!
  Your hair, your gestures, your voice, all mine! Oh, how dared you do
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must not forget,&rdquo; Anna said calmly, &ldquo;that it is
  necessary for me also&mdash;to live. I arrived here with something less than
  five pounds in my pocket. My reception at West Kensington you know of. I was
  the black sheep, I was hurried out of the way. You did not complain then that
  I personated you&mdash;no, nor when Sir John came to me in Paris, and for
  your sake I lied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Annabel! When I arrived in London I went to live in the
  cheapest place I could find. I set myself to find employment. I offered
  myself as a clerk, as a milliner, as a shop girl. I would even have taken a
  place as waitress in a tea shop. I walked London till the soles of my shoes
  were worn through, and my toes were blistered. I ate only enough to keep body
  and soul together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was no need for such heroism,&rdquo; Annabel said coldly.
  &ldquo;You had only to ask&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; Anna interrupted, with a note of passion
  trembling also in her tone, &ldquo;that I would have taken alms from Sir
  John, the man to whom I had lied for your sake. It was not possible. I went
  at last when I had barely a shilling in my purse to a dramatic agent. By
  chance I went to one who had known you in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131"
     id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He greeted me effusively. He offered me at once an engagement. I
  told him that I was not &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; He only laughed. He had seen
  the announcement of your marriage in the papers, and he imagined that I
  simply wanted to remain unknown because of your husband&rsquo;s puritanism. I
  sang to him, and he was satisfied. I did not appear, I have never announced
  myself as &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; It was the Press who forced the identity upon
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were my posters,&rdquo; Annabel said. &ldquo;The ones Cariolus
  did for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The posters at least,&rdquo; Anna answered quietly, &ldquo;I have
  some claim to. You know very well that you took from my easel David
  Courtlaw&rsquo;s study of me, and sent it to Cariolus. You denied it at the
  time&mdash;but unfortunately I have proof. Mr. Courtlaw found the study in
  Cariolus&rsquo; studio.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did it matter?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We are, or rather we
  were, so much alike then that the portrait of either of us would have done
  for the other. It saved me the bother of being studied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It convinced Mr. Earles that I was &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo;&rdquo;
  Anna remarked quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will convince him now to the contrary,&rdquo; Annabel
  answered.</p>

  <p>Anna looked at her, startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Annabel set her teeth hard, and turned fiercely towards Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It means that I have had enough of this slavery,&rdquo; she
  declared. &ldquo;My husband and all his friends are fools, and the life they
  lead is impossible for me. It takes too many years to climb even a step in
  the social ladder. I&rsquo;ve had enough of it. I want my freedom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; Anna said slowly, &ldquo;that you are going
  to leave your husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are willing to give up your position, your beautiful houses,
  your carriages and milliner&rsquo;s accounts to come back to
  Bohemianism?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Annabel declared. &ldquo;I am sick of it. It is
  dull&mdash;deadly dull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what about this man&mdash;Mr. Montague Hill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel put her hand suddenly to her throat and steadied herself with the
  back of a chair. She looked stealthily at Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have succeeded a little too well in your personation,&rdquo;
  she said bitterly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132"
     id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> &ldquo;to get rid very easily of Mr.
     Montague Hill. You are a great deal more like what I was a few months ago
     than I am now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laughed softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You propose, then,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that I shall still
  be saddled with a pseudo husband. I think not, Annabel. You are welcome to
  proclaim yourself &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; if you will. I would even make over my
  engagement to you, if Mr. Earles would permit. But I should certainly want to
  be rid of Mr. Montague Hill, and I do not think that under those
  circumstances I should be long about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel sank suddenly into a chair. Her knees were trembling, her whole
  frame was shaken with sobs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;I am a jealous, ungrateful woman.
  But oh, how weary I am! I know. If only&mdash;Anna, tell me,&rdquo; she broke
  off suddenly, &ldquo;how did you get to know Mr. Ennison?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He spoke to me, thinking that I was you,&rdquo; Anna answered.
  &ldquo;I liked him, and I never undeceived him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And he sat at my table,&rdquo; Annabel said bitterly, &ldquo;and
  yet he did not know me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna glanced up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you yourself are
  responsible for your altered looks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the others,&rdquo; Annabel said tearfully, &ldquo;that is well
  enough. But for him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something in her sister&rsquo;s tone startled Anna. She looked at her for
  a moment fixedly. When she tried to speak she found it difficult. Her voice
  seemed to come from a long way off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Annabel? You only knew Mr. Ennison
  slightly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence in the little room. Anna sat with the face of a
  Sphinx&mdash;waiting. Annabel thought, and thought again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew Mr. Ennison better than I have ever told you,&rdquo; she
  said slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know&mdash;in Paris they coupled my name with some
  one&rsquo;s&mdash;an Englishman&rsquo;s. Nigel Ennison was he.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna stood up. Her cheeks were aflame. Her eyes were lit with smouldering
  passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Let me know the
  truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel looked down. It was hard to meet that gaze.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133"
     id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does he never speak to you of&mdash;of old times?&rdquo; she
  faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fence with me,&rdquo; Anna cried fiercely. &ldquo;The
  truth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel bent over her and whispered in her sister&rsquo;s ear.</p>

     id="Chapter_XXII"></a><i>Chapter XXII</i></h2>

  <h3>AN OLD FOOL</h3>

  <p>Lady Ferringhall made room for him on the sofa by her side. She was
  wearing a becoming tea-gown, and it was quite certain that Sir John would not
  be home for several hours at least.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am delighted to see you, Mr. Ennison,&rdquo; she said, letting
  her fingers rest in his. &ldquo;Do come and cheer me up. I am bored to
  distraction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took a seat by her side. He was looking pale and ill. There were
  shadows under his eyes. He returned her impressive greeting almost
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you yourself,&rdquo; she exclaimed, glancing into his face,
  &ldquo;you too look tired. You poor man, what have you been doing to
  yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing except travelling all night,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  am just back from Paris. I am bothered. I have come to you for sympathy,
  perhaps for help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may be sure of the one,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The other
  too if it is within my power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is within yours&mdash;if anybody&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;It is about your sister, Lady Ferringhall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel gave a little gasp. The colour slowly left her cheeks, the lines
  of her mouth hardened. The change in her face was not a pleasant one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About my sister,&rdquo; she repeated slowly.</p>

  <p>Her tone should have warned him, but he was too much in earnest to regard
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You remember that you saw us at the Savoy a few evenings
  ago?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you knew, of course, that we were old friends?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Ferringhall, I love your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; she repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I love your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Ferringhall sat with half closed eyes and clenched <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_135"
     id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>teeth. Brute! Fool! To have come to her
     on such an errand. She felt a hysterical desire to strike him, to burst
     out crying, to blurt out the whole miserable truth. The effort to maintain
     her self-control was almost superhuman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;your people!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Surely Lady
  Ennison would object, even if it were possible. And the Duke, too&mdash;I
  heard him say that a married secretary would be worse than useless to
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The difficulties on my own side I can deal with,&rdquo; he
  answered. &ldquo;I am not dependent upon any one. I have plenty of money, and
  the Duke will not be in the next Cabinet. My trouble is with your
  sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Ferringhall was conscious of some relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has refused to listen to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has behaved in a most extraordinary manner,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;We parted&mdash;that night the best of friends. She knew that I cared
  for her, she had admitted that she cared for me. I suppose I was a little
  idiotic&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think we either of us mentioned the future, but
  it was arranged that I should go the next afternoon and have tea with her.
  When I went I was refused admittance. I have since received a most
  extraordinary letter from her. She offers me no explanation, permits me
  absolutely no hope. She simply refuses to see or hear from me again. I went
  to the theatre that night. I waited for her at the back. She saw me, and,
  Lady Ferringhall, I shall never forget her look as long as I live. It was
  horrible. She looked at me as though I were some unclean thing, as though my
  soul were weighted with every sin in the calendar. I could not have spoken to
  her. It took my breath away. By the time I had recovered myself she had gone.
  My letters are returned unopened, her maid will not even allow me across the
  doorstep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The explanation seems to me to be reasonably simple,&rdquo; Annabel
  said coldly. &ldquo;You seem to forget that my sister
  is&mdash;married.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she is,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am convinced that there are
  circumstances in connexion with that marriage which would make a divorce
  easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would marry a divorc&eacute;e?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would marry your sister anyhow, under any circumstances,&rdquo;
  he answered.</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to ask you a question,&rdquo; she said abruptly.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_136"
     id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> &ldquo;This wonderful affection of yours
     for my sister, does it date from your first meeting with her in
     Paris?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I admired your sister in Paris,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I do
  not believe that I regard her now as altogether the same person. Something
  has happened to change her marvellously, either that, or she wilfully
  deceived me and every one else in those days as to her real self. She was a
  much lighter and more frivolous person, very charming and
  companionable&mdash;but with a difference&mdash;a great difference. I wonder
  whether you would mind, Lady Ferringhall,&rdquo; he went on, with a sudden
  glance at her, &ldquo;if I tell you that you yourself remind me a great deal
  more of what she was like then, except of course that your complexion and
  colouring are altogether different.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am highly flattered,&rdquo; she remarked, with subtle irony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go and see her. Find out what I have done or failed to do. Get me
  an interview with her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she said, with a hard little laugh, &ldquo;you must
  regard me as a very good-natured person.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; he answered unconsciously. &ldquo;I am sure that
  you are. I want her to tell me the whole truth about this extraordinary
  marriage. We will find some way out of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think that you can do that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; he answered, confidently. &ldquo;Those
  things are arranged more easily in any other country than England. At any
  rate she must see me. I demand it as a right. I must know what new thing has
  come between us that she should treat me as a lover one day and a monster the
  next.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She leaned back amongst the cushions of her chair. She was very pale, but
  she reminded him more at that minute than at any time of &ldquo;Alcide&rdquo;
  as he had first known her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how much you care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I care as a man cares only once in his life,&rdquo; he answered
  promptly. &ldquo;When it comes there is no mistaking it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did it come&mdash;in Paris?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_137"
     id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> &ldquo;I do not think so. What does it
     matter? It is here, and it is here to stay. Do help me, Lady Ferringhall.
     You need not be afraid. No trouble will ever come to your sister through
     me. If this idiotic marriage is binding then I will be her friend. But I
     have powerful friends. I only want to know the truth, and I will move
     heaven and earth to have it set aside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The truth,&rdquo; she murmured, with her eyes fixed upon him.
  &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped short. He looked at her in some embarrassment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I want to hear it from your
  sister. It is her duty to tell me, and I would not have her think that I had
  been trying to work upon your sympathies to learn her secrets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will go and see her,&rdquo; he begged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I will go,&rdquo; she promised, with a queer little smile.
  &ldquo;It is against my husband&rsquo;s orders, and I am not sure that my
  sister will be particularly glad to see me. But I will go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall always be grateful to you,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; she answered
  enigmatically.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXIII"
     id="Chapter_XXIII"></a><i>Chapter XXIII</i></h2>

  <h3>MONTAGUE HILL SEES LIGHT AT LAST</h3>

  <p>At exactly ten minutes past ten Annabel rang the bell of her
  sister&rsquo;s flat. There was no response. She rang again with the same
  result. Then, as she was in the act of turning reluctantly away, she noticed
  a thin crack between the door and the frame. She pushed the former and it
  opened. The latch had not fully caught.</p>

  <p>The flat was apparently empty. Annabel turned on the electric light and
  made her way into the sitting-room. There was a coffee equipage on the table,
  and some sandwiches, and the fire had been recently made up. Annabel seated
  herself in an easy chair and determined to wait for her sister&rsquo;s
  return.</p>

  <p>The clock struck half-past ten. The loneliness of the place somewhat
  depressed her. She took up a book and threw it down again. Then she examined
  with curiosity some knick-knacks upon a small round table by her side.
  Amongst them was a revolver. She handled it half fearfully, and set it
  carefully down again. Then for the first time she was conscious of an
  unaccountable and terrifying sensation. She felt that she was not alone.</p>

  <p>She was only a few yards from the door, but lacked the courage to rise and
  fly. Her knees shook, her breath came fast, she almost felt the lurid effect
  of those tiny patches of rouge upon her pallor-stricken cheeks. Her eyes were
  dilated&mdash;fixed in a horrified stare at the parting in the curtains which
  hung before the window.</p>

  <p>There was some one there. She had seen a man&rsquo;s head steal out for a
  moment and draw the curtains a little closer. Even now she could trace the
  outline of his shape behind the left-hand curtain. She was wholly unable to
  conceal her knowledge of his presence. A little smothered cry broke from her
  lips&mdash;the curtains were thrown aside and a man stepped out. She was
  powerless to move from her chair. All through that brief but measureless
  space of time during which wonder kept him silent, as fear did her, she
  cowered there, a limp helpless object. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_139"
     id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Her courage and her presence of mind had
     alike deserted her. She could neither speak nor move nor cry out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel! God in Heaven, it is Annabel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not speak. Her lips parted, but no words came.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you done to yourself?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You have
  dyed your hair and darkened your eyebrows. But you are Annabel. I should know
  you&mdash;in Heaven or Hell. Who is the other?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What other?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her voice seemed to come from a long way off. Her lips were dry and
  cracked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Annabel who lives here, who sings every night at the
  &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo;? They call her by your old name. Her hair and voice and
  figure are as yours used to be. Who is she, I say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My sister!&rdquo; Annabel faltered.</p>

  <p>He trembled violently. He seemed to be labouring under some great
  excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All these days I have taken her
  for you. I have pleaded with her&mdash;no wonder that I have pleaded with her
  in vain. And all this time perhaps you have been waiting, expecting to hear
  from me. Is it so, Annabel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;anything about you. Why
  should I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;at last I have found you. I
  must not let you go again. Do you know, Annabel, that you are my
  wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;not that. I thought&mdash;the papers
  said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You thought that I was dead,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;You
  pushed the wheel from my hand. You jumped, and I think that you left me. Yet
  you knew that I was not dead. You came to see me in the hospital. You must
  have repented a little, or you would not have done that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not come,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;It was my sister Anna.
  I had left Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He passed his hand wearily over his forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is where I got confused,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I opened my
  eyes, and she was bending over my bedside. Then, I thought, she has repented,
  all will be well. So I made haste and recovered. I came to London to look for
  you, and somehow the figure I saw in my dreams had got mixed up with you.
  Your sister! Great God, how like she is to what you were!&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140"
     id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

  <p>Annabel looked around her nervously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These are her rooms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Soon she will
  return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I must explain to
  her. Annabel, I cannot believe it. I have found you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His eyes were burning. He advanced a step towards her. She held out both
  her hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You frighten me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled at her indulgently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I am your husband,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have forgotten. I
  am your husband, though as yet your hand has scarcely lain in
  mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;You told me that your
  name was Meysey Hill. I thought that you were he.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face darkened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did it for love of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I lied, as I would
  have committed a murder, or done any evil deed sooner than lose you. What
  does it matter? I am not a pauper, Annabel. I can keep you. You shall have a
  house out at Balham or Sydenham, and two servants. You shall have the
  spending of every penny of my money. Annabel, tell me that you did not wish
  me dead. Tell me that you are not sorry to see me again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her passion conquered for a moment her fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I am sorry,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Our marriage must be
  annulled. It was no marriage at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he exclaimed vehemently. &ldquo;You are mine,
  Annabel, and nothing shall ever make me give you up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it is too late,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You have no right
  to hold me to a bargain which on your side was a lie. I consented to become
  Mrs. Meysey Hill&mdash;never your wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;by too late?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is some one else whom I care for!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed hardly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me his name,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I promise that he
  shall never trouble you. But you,&rdquo; he continued, moving
  imperceptibility a little nearer to her, &ldquo;you are mine. The angels in
  Heaven shall not tear you from me. We leave this room together. I shall not
  part with you again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I will not. I will have nothing to do
  with you. You are not my husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He came towards her with that in his face which filled her with blind
  terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You belong to me,&rdquo; he said fiercely;<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_141"
     id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> &ldquo;the marriage certificate is in my
     pocket. You belong to me, and I have waited long enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stepped past her to the door and closed it. Then he turned with a
  fierce movement to take her into his arms. There was a flash and a loud
  report. He threw up his hand, reeled for a moment on his feet, and collapsed
  upon the floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel;&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;You have killed me. My
  wife&mdash;killed me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a little crash the pistol fell from her shaking fingers. She stood
  looking down upon him with dilated eyes. Her faculties seemed for a moment
  numbed. She could not realize what she saw. Surely it was a dream. A moment
  before he had been a strong man, she had been in his power, a poor helpless
  thing. Now he lay there, a doubled-up mass, with ugly distorted features, and
  a dark wet stain dripping slowly on to the carpet. It could not be she who
  had done this. She had never let off a pistol in her life. Yet the smoke was
  curling upwards in a faint innocent-looking cloud to the ceiling. The smell
  of gunpowder was strong in the room.</p>

  <p>It was true. She had killed him. It was as much accident as anything, but
  she had killed him. Once before&mdash;but that had been different. This time
  they would call it murder.</p>

  <p>She listened, listened intently for several minutes. People were passing
  in the street below. She could hear their footsteps upon the pavement. A
  hansom stopped a little way off. She could hear the bell tinkle as the horse
  shook its head. There was no one stirring in the flats. He himself had
  deadened the sound by closing the door. She moved a little nearer to him.</p>

  <p>It was horrible, but she must do it. She sank upon her knees and
  unbuttoned his coat. It was there in the breast pocket, stiff and legal
  looking. She drew it out with shaking fingers. There was a great splash of
  blood upon it, her hand was all wet and sticky. A deadly sickness came over
  her, the room seemed spinning round. She staggered to the fireplace and
  thrust it into the heart of the dying flames. She held it down with the
  poker, looking nervously over her shoulder. Then she put more coal on, piled
  it over the ashes, and stood once more upright.</p>

  <p><a id="pic13"
     name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br />

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration" />
  </div>

  <p>Still silence everywhere. She pulled down her veil and made her way to the
  door. She turned out the electric light and gained the hall. Still no sound.
  Her knees almost sank beneath her as she raised the latch of the front door
  and looked <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142"
     id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>out. There was no one to be seen. She
     passed down the stairs and into the street.</p>

  <p>She walked for a mile or more recklessly, close veiled, with swift level
  footsteps, though her brain was in a whirl and a horrible faintness all the
  time hovered about her. Then she called a hansom and drove home.</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; Brendon said gently, &ldquo;I am afraid
  that some fresh trouble has come to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled at him cheerfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I dull?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You could never be that,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but you are at
  least more serious than usual.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am superstitious. This is my
  last week at the &lsquo;Unusual,&rsquo; you know. We begin rehearsing on
  Monday at the &lsquo;Garrick&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;the change is all in favour of
  your own inclinations. It is your own choice, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But I believe that Mr. Earles thinks I am a little mad, and
  between ourselves I am not sure about it myself. It is easy enough to sing
  these little chansons in an original way&mdash;it requires a very different
  sort of ability to succeed on the stage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; he declared confidently.</p>

  <p>She laughed altogether in her old manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder how it is,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;that my friends
  have so much more confidence in me than I have in myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They know you better,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that one&rsquo;s friends
  can judge only of the externals, and the things which matter, the things
  inside are realized only by oneself&mdash;stop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laid her fingers upon his arm, and they both stood still. They had
  turned into the street, on the opposite side of which were the flats where
  Anna lived. Glancing idly up at her own window as they had swung round the
  corner she had seen a strange thing. The curtains which she had left drawn
  were open, and the electric lights were turned on. Then, even as they stood
  there, the room was plunged into darkness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is someone in my rooms,&rdquo; Anna said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it your maid?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143"
     id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>&ldquo;I have given her two days&rsquo;
     holiday,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;She has gone down into the
     country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And no one else&mdash;has a key?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that that man must have one. I
  am safe while I am there, for I have had bolts fitted everywhere, and a pane
  of glass in the front door. But I am always afraid that he may get in while I
  am away. Look! Is that some one coming out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The front door of the flats stood open, and through it a woman, slim and
  veiled, passed on to the pavement and turned with swift footsteps in the
  opposite direction. Anna watched her with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it any one you know?&rdquo; Brendon asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;But, of course, she may
  have come from one of the other flats.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you had better let me have your
  key, and I will go up and explore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will go together,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>They crossed the street, and entering the front door passed up the outside
  stone steps of the flat. Anna herself opened the hall door. They stood for a
  moment in the passage and listened. Silence! Then Anna clutched her
  companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>He had heard nothing. They both listened intently. Again silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought that I heard a groan,&rdquo; Anna whispered.</p>

  <p>He laughed reassuringly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard nothing,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and my ears are good.
  Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He threw open the door of the sitting-room and switched on the electric
  light.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no&mdash;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He turned round to keep Anna out by force if possible, but he was too
  late. She was by his side. She too had seen. The thin stream of blood on
  which her eyes were fastened with a nameless horror reached almost to her
  feet.</p>

  <h3>A CASE FOR THE POLICE</h3>

  <p>After that first horrible moment it was perhaps Anna who was the more
  self-possessed. She dropped on her knees by his side, and gently unbuttoned
  his waistcoat. Then she looked up at Brendon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must fetch a doctor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not think
  that he is quite dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And leave you here alone?&rdquo; he asked, in a hoarse whisper.
  &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Please
  hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He reeled out of the room. Anna was afterwards astonished at her own
  self-possession. She bound a scarf tightly round the place where the blood
  seemed to be coming from. Then she stood up and looked around the room.</p>

  <p>There were no evidences of any struggle, no overturned chairs or
  disarranged furniture. The grate was full of fluttering ashes of burnt paper,
  and the easy chair near the fire had evidently been used. On the floor was a
  handkerchief, a little morsel of lace. Anna saw it, and for the first time
  found herself trembling.</p>

  <p>She moved towards it slowly and picked it up, holding it out in front of
  her whilst the familiar perfume seemed to assert itself with damning
  insistence. It was Annabel&rsquo;s. The lace was family lace, easily
  recognizable. The perfume was the only one she ever used. Annabel had been
  here then. It was she who had come out from the flat only a few minutes
  before. It was she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Anna&rsquo;s nerves were not easily shaken, but she found herself suddenly
  clutching at the table for support. The room was reeling, or was it that she
  was going to faint? She recovered herself with a supreme effort. There were
  the burnt papers still in the grate. She took up the poker and stirred the
  fire vigorously. Almost at the same moment the door opened and Brendon
  entered, followed by the doctor.</p>

  <p>Anna turned round with a start, which was almost of guilt, the poker still
  in her hand. She met the keen grey eyes of a <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_145"
     id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>clean-shaven man, between forty and
     fifty, quietly dressed in professional attire. Before he even glanced at
     the man on the floor he stepped over to her side and took the poker from
     her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, madam,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;but in such a
  case as this it is better that nothing in the room should be disturbed until
  the arrival of the police. You have been burning paper, I see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you a detective or a doctor?&rdquo; she asked calmly. &ldquo;Do
  you need me to remind you that your patient is bleeding to death?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dropped on his knees by the man&rsquo;s side and made a hurried
  examination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who tied this scarf here?&rdquo; he asked, looking up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I hope that it has not done any
  harm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He would have been dead before now without it,&rdquo; the doctor
  answered shortly. &ldquo;Get me some brandy and my bag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was nearly half an hour before they dared ask him the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very doubtful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must send for the
  police at once, you know. You, sir,&rdquo; he added, turning to Brendon,
  &ldquo;had better take my card round to the police station in Werner Street
  and ask that Detective Dorling be sent round here at once on urgent
  business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it necessary to send for the police?&rdquo; Anna asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; the doctor answered, &ldquo;and the sooner the
  better. This is a case either of suicide or murder. The police are concerned
  in it in either event.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please go then, Mr. Brendon,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;You will come
  back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded cheerfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>The doctor and Anna were left alone. Every moment or two he bent over his
  patient. He seemed to avoid meeting Anna&rsquo;s eyes as much as
  possible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does he live here?&rdquo; he asked her presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Far away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Anna answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is the tenant of these rooms?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146"
     id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will have no objection to his remaining here?&rdquo; he asked.
  &ldquo;A move of any sort would certainly be fatal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;Had he better have a nurse?
  I will be responsible for anything of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he lives through the next hour,&rdquo; the doctor answered,
  &ldquo;I will send some one. Do you know anything of his friends? Is there
  any one for whom we ought to send?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know very little of him beyond his name,&rdquo; Anna answered.
  &ldquo;I know nothing whatever of his friends or his home. He used to live in
  a boarding-house in Russell Square. That is where I first knew
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at her thoughtfully. Perhaps for the first time he
  realized that Anna was by no means an ordinary person. His patient was
  distinctly of a different order of life. It was possible that his first
  impressions had not been correct.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your name, I believe, is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pellissier,&rdquo; Anna answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; the doctor said, &ldquo;to give you a word of
  advice, Miss Pellissier. A detective will be here in a few moments to make
  inquiries into this affair. You may have something to conceal, you may not.
  Tell the whole truth. It always comes out sooner or later. Don&rsquo;t try to
  shield anybody or hide anything. It is bad policy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna smiled very faintly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you for your advice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can assure
  you that it was quite unnecessary. I know less about this affair perhaps than
  you suppose. What I do know I shall have no hesitation in telling anyone who
  has the right to ask.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; the doctor remarked drily. &ldquo;And if I were you
  I would keep away from the fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon reappeared, followed by a tall thin man with a stubbly brown
  moustache and restless grey eyes. The doctor nodded to him curtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Dorling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before you do
  anything else I should advise you to secure those charred fragments of paper
  from the grate. I know nothing about this affair, but some one has been
  burning documents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The detective went down on his hands and knees. With delicate touch he
  rescued all that was possible of them, and made a careful little parcel. Then
  he stepped briskly to his feet and bent over the wounded man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shot through the lungs,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147"
     id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad hemorrhage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to fetch some
  things that will be wanted if he pulls through the next hour. I found him
  lying like this, the bleeding partly stopped by this scarf, else he had been
  dead by now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The doctor glanced towards Anna. Considering his convictions he felt that
  his remark was a generous one. Anna&rsquo;s face however was wholly
  impassive.</p>

  <p>He took up his hat and went. The detective rapidly sketched the appearance
  of the room in his notebook, and picked up the pistol from under the table.
  Then he turned to Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you give me any information as to this affair?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you all that I know,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;My name
  is Anna Pellissier, sometimes called Annabel. I am engaged to sing every
  evening at the &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo; music hall. This man&rsquo;s name is
  Montague Hill. I saw him first a few months ago at Mrs. White&rsquo;s
  boarding-house in Russell Square. He subjected me there to great annoyance by
  claiming me as his wife. As a matter of fact, I had never spoken to him
  before in my life. Since then he has persistently annoyed me. I have
  suspected him of possessing a skeleton key to my apartments. To-night I
  locked up my flat at six o&rsquo;clock. It was then, I am sure, empty. I
  dined with a friend and went to the &lsquo;Unusual.&rsquo; At a quarter past
  eleven I returned here with this gentleman, Mr. Brendon. As we turned the
  corner of the street, I noticed that the electric light was burning in this
  room. We stopped for a moment to watch it, and almost immediately it was
  turned out. We came on here at once. I found the door locked as usual, but
  when we entered this room everything was as you see. Nothing has been touched
  since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A very clear statement, madam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From what you
  saw from the opposite pavement then, it is certain that some person who was
  able to move about was in this room only a minute or so before you entered
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; Anna answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You met no one upon the stairs, or saw no one leave the
  flats?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Anna answered firmly.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148"
     id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then either this man shot himself or some one else shot him
  immediately before your arrival&mdash;or rather if it was not himself the
  person who did it was in the room, say two minutes, before you
  arrived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; Anna admitted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not trouble you with any questions about the other occupants
  of the flats,&rdquo; Mr. Dorling said. &ldquo;I shall have to go through the
  building. You say that this gentleman was with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Brendon answered, &ldquo;most
  providentially.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did not notice anything which may have escaped this lady? You
  saw no one leave the flats?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Brendon answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You heard no pistol-shot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The detective turned again to Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know of no one likely to have had a grudge against this
  man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no one else who has a key to your rooms?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one except my maid, who is away in Wiltshire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The inference is, then,&rdquo; the detective said smoothly,
  &ldquo;that this man obtained admission to your rooms by means of a false
  key, that he burnt some papers here and shot himself within a few moments of
  your return. Either that or some other person also obtained admission here
  and shot him, and that person is either still upon the premises or escaped
  without your notice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Anna said, &ldquo;that those are reasonable
  deductions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The detective thrust his notebook into his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I brought a man with me who is posted outside,&rdquo; he remarked.
  &ldquo;With your permission I should like to search the remainder of your
  rooms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna showed him the way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have either of you been out of this room since you discovered what
  had happened?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Brendon went for the doctor,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I
  have not left this apartment myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nothing unusual was discovered in any other part of the flat. While they
  were still engaged in looking round the doctor returned with a nurse and
  assistant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; he said to Anna, &ldquo;I shall
  arrange a bed for him where he is. There is scarcely one chance in a dozen of
  saving his life; there would be none at all if he were moved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149"
     id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can make any arrangements you like,&rdquo; Anna declared.
  &ldquo;I shall leave the flat to you and go to a hotel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would perhaps be so good as to allow one of my men to accompany
  you and see you settled,&rdquo; Mr. Dorling said deferentially. &ldquo;In the
  event of his death we should require you at once to attend at the
  inquest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am going to pack my bag,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;In five
  minutes I shall be ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXV"
     id="Chapter_XXV"></a><i>Chapter XXV</i></h2>

  <h3>THE STEEL EDGE OF THE TRUTH</h3>

  <p>The manservant, with his plain black clothes and black tie, had entered
  the room with a deferential little gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will pardon me, sir,&rdquo; he said in a subdued tone,
  &ldquo;but I think that you have forgotten to look at your engagement book.
  There is Lady Arlingford&rsquo;s reception to-night, ten till twelve, and the
  Hatton House ball, marked with a cross, sir, important. I put your clothes
  out an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nigel Ennison looked up with a little start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Dunster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may go to Hatton House
  later, but you needn&rsquo;t wait. I can get into my clothes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I bring you anything, sir&mdash;a whisky and soda, or a
  liqueur? You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, but you haven&rsquo;t touched your
  coffee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring me a whisky and soda, and a box of cigarettes,&rdquo; Ennison
  answered, &ldquo;and then leave me alone, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.
  I&rsquo;m a little tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man obeyed his orders noiselessly and then left the room.</p>

  <p>Ennison roused himself with an effort, took a long drink from his whisky
  and soda, and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; he muttered, standing up on the hearthrug,
  and leaning his elbows upon the broad mantelpiece. &ldquo;And yet I wonder
  whether the world ever held such another enigma in her sex. Paris looms
  behind&mdash;a tragedy of strange recollections&mdash;here she emerges
  Ph&oelig;nix-like, subtly developed, a flawless woman, beautiful,
  self-reliant, witty, a woman with the strange gift of making all others
  beside her seem plain or vulgar. And then&mdash;this sudden thrust. God only
  knows what I have done, or left undone. Something unpardonable is laid to my
  charge. Only last night she saw me, and there was horror in her eyes.... I
  have written, called&mdash;of what avail is anything&mdash;against that
  look.... What the devil is the matter, Dunster?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; the man answered, &ldquo;there is a
  lady here to see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151"
     id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

  <p>Ennison turned round sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A lady, Dunster. Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man came a little further into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Ferringhall, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Ferringhall&mdash;alone?&rdquo; Ennison exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite alone, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison was dismayed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Dunster, don&rsquo;t let her out of the
  carriage, or hansom, or whatever she came in. Say I&rsquo;m out, away,
  anything!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; the man answered, &ldquo;but she had sent
  away her hansom before I answered the bell. She is in the hall now.
  I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The door was thrown open. Annabel entered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive my coming in,&rdquo; she said to Ennison. &ldquo;I heard
  your voices, and the hall is draughty. What is the matter with
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dunster had withdrawn discreetly. Ennison&rsquo;s manner was certainly not
  one of a willing host.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot pretend that I am glad to see you, Lady
  Ferringhall,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;For your own sake, let me beg of
  you not to stay for a moment. Dunster shall fetch you a cab.
  I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She threw herself into an easy chair. She was unusually pale, and her eyes
  were brilliant. Never had she seemed to him so much like Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be worried,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;The
  conventions do not matter one little bit. You will agree with me when you
  have heard what I have to say. For me that is all over and done
  with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Ferringhall! Anna!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She fixed her brilliant eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose you call me by my proper name,&rdquo; she said quietly.
  &ldquo;Call me Annabel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He started back as though he had been shot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That is your sister&rsquo;s
  name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It came upon him like a flash. Innumerable little puzzles were instantly
  solved. He could only wonder that this amazing thing had remained so long a
  secret to him. He remembered little whispered speeches of hers, so like the
  Annabel of Paris, so unlike the woman he loved, a hundred little things
  should have told him long ago. Nevertheless it was overwhelming.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152"
     id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your hair,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dyed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your figure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s <i>corseti&egrave;re</i> arranges that. My friend, I am
  only grieved that you of all others should have been so deceived. I have seen
  you with Anna, and I have not known whether to be glad or sorry. I have been
  in torment all the while to know whether it was to Anna or to Annabel that
  you were making love so charmingly. Nigel, do you know that I have been very
  jealous?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He avoided the invitation of her eyes. He was indeed still in the throes
  of his bewilderment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Sir John?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What made you marry him?
  What made you leave Paris without a word to any one? What made you and your
  sister exchange identities?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is one answer to all those questions, Nigel,&rdquo; she said,
  with a nervous little shudder. &ldquo;It is a hateful story. Come close to
  me, and let me hold your hand, dear. I am a little afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a strange look in her face, the look of a frightened child.
  Ennison seemed to feel already the shadow of tragedy approaching. He stood by
  her side, and he suffered her hands to rest in his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You remember the man in Paris who used to follow me
  about&mdash;Meysey Hill they called him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miserable bounder,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Turned out to be an
  impostor, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He imposed on me,&rdquo; Annabel continued. &ldquo;I believed that
  he was the great multi-millionaire. He worried me to marry him. I let him
  take me to the English Embassy, and we went through some sort of a ceremony.
  I thought it would be magnificent to have a great house in Paris, and more
  money than any other woman. Afterwards we started for <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>
  in a motor. On the way he confessed. He was not Meysey Hill, but an
  Englishman of business, and he had only a small income. Every one took him
  for the millionaire, and he had lost his head about me. I&mdash;well, I lost
  my temper. I struck him across the face, twisted the steering wheel of the
  motor, sprang out myself, and left him for dead on the road with the motor on
  top of him. This is the first act.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Served the beast right,&rdquo; Ennison declared. &ldquo;I think I
  can tell you something which may be very good news for you presently. But go
  on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153"
     id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>&ldquo;Act two,&rdquo; she continued.
     &ldquo;Enter Sir John, very honest, very much in love with me. I thought
     that Hill was dead, but I was frightened, and I wanted to get away from
     Paris. Sir John heard gossip about us&mdash;about Anna the recluse, a
     paragon of virtue, and Annabel alias &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; a dancer at the
     <i>caf&eacute;s chantants</i>, and concerning whom there were many stories
     which were false, and a few&mdash;which were true. I&mdash;well, I
     borrowed Anna&rsquo;s name. I made her my unwilling confederate. Sir John
     followed me to London and married me. To this day he and every one else
     thinks that he married Anna.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Act three. Anna comes to London. She is poor, and she will take
  nothing from my husband, the man she had deceived for my sake, and he, on his
  part, gravely disapproves of her as &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; She tries every way
  of earning a living and fails. Then she goes to a dramatic agent. Curiously
  enough nothing will persuade him that she is not &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; He
  believes that she denies it simply because owing to my marriage with Sir
  John, whom they call the &lsquo;Puritan Knight,&rsquo; she wants to keep her
  identity secret. He forces an engagement upon her. She never calls herself
  &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; It is the Press who find her out. She is the image of
  what I was like, and she has a better voice. Then enter Mr. Hill
  again&mdash;alive. He meets Anna, and claims her as his wife. It is Anna
  again who stands between me and ruin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot let you go on,&rdquo; Ennison interrupted. &ldquo;I
  believe that I can give you great news. Tell me where the fellow Hill took
  you for this marriage ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was behind the Place de Vendome, on the other side from the
  Ritz.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; Ennison exclaimed. &ldquo;Cheer up, Annabel. You
  were never married at all. That place was closed by the police last month. It
  was a bogus affair altogether, kept by some blackguard or other of an
  Englishman. Everything was done in the most legal and imposing way, but the
  whole thing was a fraud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I was never married to him at all?&rdquo; Annabel said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;but, by Jove, you had a narrow escape,&rdquo; Ennison
  exclaimed. &ldquo;Annabel, I begin to see why you are here. Think! Had you
  not better hurry back before Sir John discovers? You are his wife right
  enough. You can tell me the rest another time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The rest,&rdquo; she said, holding tightly to his
  hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154"
     id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> &ldquo;is the most important of all. You
     came to me, you wished me to speak to Anna. I went to her rooms to-night.
     There was no one at home, and I was coming away when I saw that the door
     was open. I decided to go in and wait. In her sitting-room I found
     Montague Hill. He had gained admission somehow, and he too was waiting for
     Anna. But&mdash;he was cleverer than any of you. He knew me, Nigel.
     &lsquo;At last,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I have found you!&rsquo; He would
     listen to nothing. He swore that I was his wife, and&mdash;I shot him,
     Nigel, as his arms were closing around me. Shot him, do you
     hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking at her curiously. &ldquo;Is
  this true, Annabel? Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shot him. I saw the blood come as he rolled over. I tore the
  marriage certificate from his pocket and burnt it. And then I came
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You came&mdash;here!&rdquo; he repeated, vaguely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nigel, Nigel,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?
  It is I whom you cared for in Paris, not Anna. She is a stranger to you. You
  cannot care for her. Think of those days in Paris. Do you remember when we
  went right away, Nigel, and forgot everything? We went down the river past
  Veraz, and the larks were singing all over those deep brown fields, and the
  river further on wound its way like a coil of silver across the rich
  meadowland, and along the hillside vineyards. Oh, the scent of the flowers
  that day, the delicious quiet, the swallows that dived before us in the
  river. Nigel! You have not forgotten. It was the first day you kissed me,
  under the willows, coming into Veraz. Nigel, you have not
  forgotten!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, with a little bitter smile. &ldquo;I have never
  forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She suddenly caught hold of his shoulders and drew him down towards
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nigel, don&rsquo;t you understand. I must leave England to-night. I
  must go somewhere into hiding, a long, long way off. I killed him, Nigel.
  They will say that it was murder. But if only you will come I do not
  care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook her hands off almost roughly. He stood away from her. She
  listened with dumb fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Annabel,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_155"
     id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> &ldquo;We played at love- making in
     Paris. It was very pretty and very dainty while it lasted, but we played
     it with our eyes open, and we perfectly understood the game&mdash;both of
     us. Other things came. We went our ways. There was no broken
     faith&mdash;not even any question of anything of the sort. I met you here
     as Lady Ferringhall. We have played at a little mild love-making again. It
     has been only the sort of nonsense which passes lightly enough between
     half the men and women in London. You shall know the truth. I do not love
     you. I have never loved you. I call myself a man of the world, a man of
     many experiences, but I never knew what love meant&mdash;until I met your
     sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You love&mdash;Anna?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I always shall. Now if you are
  ready to go with me, I too am ready. We will go to Ostend by the early
  morning boat and choose a hiding place from there. I will marry you when Sir
  John gets his divorce, and I will do all I can to keep you out of harm. But
  you had better know the truth to start with. I will do all this not because I
  love you, but&mdash;because you are Anna&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are magnificent,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but the steel of your
  truth is a little oversharpened. It cuts. Will you let your servant call me a
  hansom,&rdquo; she continued, opening the door before he could reach her
  side. &ldquo;I had no idea that it was so abominably late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He scarcely saw her face again. She pulled her veil down, and he knew that
  silence was best.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; he asked, as the hansom drove up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home, of course,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Eight, Cavendish
  Square.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXVI"
     id="Chapter_XXVI"></a><i>Chapter XXVI</i></h2>

  <h3>ANNABEL IS WARNED</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>David Courtlaw crossed the floor of the dingy little sitting-room with
  outstretched hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cannot say that you did not expect me,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;I got Sydney&rsquo;s telegram at ten o&rsquo;clock, and caught the
  ten-thirty from the Gare du Nord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very nice of you,&rdquo; Anna said softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I could not have stayed in
  Paris and waited for news. Tell me exactly what has happened. Even now I do
  not understand. Is this man Hill dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was alive at four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon,&rdquo; she
  answered, &ldquo;but the doctors give little hope of his recovery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is there to be feared?&rdquo; he asked her quietly.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are my friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if any one is. I think
  that I will tell you. The man Hill has persecuted me for months&mdash;ever
  since I have been in England. He claimed me for his wife, and showed to every
  one a marriage certificate. He shot at me at the &lsquo;Unusual,&rsquo; and
  the magistrates bound him over to keep the peace. I found him once in my
  rooms, and I believe that he had a key to my front door. Last night Mr.
  Brendon and I returned from the &lsquo;Unusual,&rsquo; and found him lying in
  my room shot through the lungs. In the grate were some charred fragments of a
  marriage certificate. We fetched the doctor and the police. From the first I
  could see that neither believed my story. I am suspected of having shot the
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that is ridiculous!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She laughed a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am under police surveillance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So is Mr.
  Brendon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But there is not a shadow of evidence against you,&rdquo; he
  objected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157"
     id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> &ldquo;The man alone could supply any,
     and if he recovers sufficiently to say anything, what he would say would
     exonerate you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Anna&rsquo;s face was half turned from
  him, but her expression, and the tone of her monosyllable puzzled him. He
  stepped quickly towards her. Her eyes seemed to be looking backwards. She
  distinctly shivered as he forced her to look at him. He was bewildered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo; he exclaimed hoarsely. &ldquo;Look at me. What is it?
  Good God!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An unhappy little smile parted her lips. She clenched her hands together
  and leaned forward in her chair, gazing steadily into the fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I will tell you everything. I
  must tell somebody&mdash;and you would understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;whatever you may
  have to tell me. You can trust me, Anna. You know that. I will be as silent
  as the grave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not long ago,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you left me in anger, partly
  because of this exchange of identities between Annabel and myself. You said
  that it would bring trouble. It has.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel&rsquo;s real reason for wishing to leave Paris, the real
  reason she married Sir John Ferringhall, was because of a very foolish thing
  which she did. It was&mdash;in connection with this man Hill. He personated
  over there a millionaire named Meysey Hill, and it seems that he induced
  Annabel to go through some sort of marriage with him at the
  Embassy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Courtlaw asked quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw seemed about to say something. He changed his mind however, and
  simply motioned to her to proceed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then there was a motor accident only an hour or so after this
  ceremony, and Hill was reported to be killed. Annabel believed it, came to
  England and married Sir John. Now you can understand why I have been obliged
  to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand that,&rdquo; Courtlaw interrupted.
  &ldquo;But about last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel knew where I lived,&rdquo; Anna continued slowly.
  &ldquo;She has been to my flat before. I saw her come out from the flat
  buildings two minutes before we entered it last night. I picked up her
  handkerchief on the floor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158"
     id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;you
     think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush! I think that he was concealed in my room, and Annabel and he
  met there. What passed between them I cannot think&mdash;I dare not. The
  pistol was his own, it is true, but it was one which was taken from him when
  he forced his way in upon me before. Now you can understand why every minute
  is a torture to me. It is not for myself I fear. But if he speaks&mdash;I
  fear what he may tell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have been to her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She must be warned. She had
  better escape if she can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She will take her risk,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am sure of
  it. If he recovers he may not accuse her. If he dies she is safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paced the room for a minute or two restlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are some people,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;who seem
  fated to carry on their shoulders the burdens of other people. You, Anna, are
  one of them. I know in Paris you pinched and scraped that your sister might
  have the dresses and entertainments she desired. You fell in at once with her
  quixotic and damnable scheme of foisting her reputation and her follies upon
  your shoulders whilst she marries a rich man and commences all over again a
  life of selfish pleasure. You on the other hand have to come to London, a
  worker, with the responsibility of life upon your own shoulders&mdash;and in
  addition all the burden of her follies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him with a faint smile,
  &ldquo;that under the cloak of her name I am earning more money a week than I
  could ever have earned in a year by my own labours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is an accident,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Besides, it is not
  so. You sing better than Annabel ever did, you have even a better style.
  &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; or no &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo; there is not a music hall
  manager in London or Paris who would not give you an engagement on your own
  merits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And yet in a very few
  weeks I shall have done with it all. Do you think that I shall ever make an
  actress, my friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; he answered bluntly. &ldquo;You have not feeling
  enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is like old times,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to hear these home
  truths. All the same, I don&rsquo;t admit it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159"
     id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To be an actress,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you require a special and
  peculiar temperament. I do not believe that there has ever lived a really
  great actress whose moral character from the ordinary point of view would
  bear inspection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have too much character.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too much character, and too little sentiment,&rdquo; he answered.
  &ldquo;Too much sensibility and too cold a heart. Too easily roused emotions
  and too little passion. How could you draw the curtain aside which hides the
  great and holy places of life&mdash;you, who have never loved?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have become French to the core,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You
  would believe that life is kindled by the passions alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was silence between them. Then a servant girl brought in a telegram.
  Anna tore it open and passed it to Courtlaw. It was from Brendon.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;Hill gradually recovering consciousness. Doctor says depositions
    to-night. Recovery impossible.&mdash;<span class=
    "smcap">Brendon</span>.&rdquo;</p>
  </div>

  <p>He looked at her gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that some one ought to warn
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is Number 8, Cavendish Square,&rdquo; she answered simply.</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>Courtlaw found himself ushered without questions into Annabel&rsquo;s long
  low drawing-room, fragrant with flowers and somewhat to his surprise, crowded
  with guests. From the further end of the apartment came the low music of a
  violin. Servants were passing backwards and forwards with tea and chocolate.
  For a moment he did not recognize Annabel. Then she came a few steps to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Courtlaw, is it not,&rdquo; she remarked, with lifted eyebrows.
  &ldquo;Really it is very kind of you to have found me out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was bereft of words for a moment, and in that moment she escaped,
  having passed him on deftly to one of the later arrivals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady Mackinnor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am sure that you must
  have heard of Mr. David Courtlaw. Permit me to make him known to
  you&mdash;Mr. Courtlaw&mdash;Lady Mackinnor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a murmured word of excuse she glided away, and Courtlaw, who had come
  with a mission which seemed to him to be one of life or death, was left to
  listen to the latest art jargon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160"
     id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>from Chelsea. He bore it as long as he
     could, watching all the time with fascinated eyes Annabel moving
     gracefully about amongst her guests, always gay, with a smile and a
     whisper for nearly everybody. Grudgingly he admired her. To him she had
     always appeared as a mere pleasure-loving parasite&mdash;something quite
     insignificant. He had pictured her, if indeed she had ever had the courage
     to do this thing, as sitting alone, convulsed with guilty fear, starting
     at her own shadow, a slave to constant terror. And instead he found her
     playing the great lady, and playing it well. She knew, or guessed his
     mission too, for more than once their eyes met, and she laughed mockingly
     at him. At last he could bear it no longer. He left his companion in the
     midst of a glowing eulogy of Bastien Leparge, and boldly intercepted his
     hostess as she moved from one group to join another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you spare me a moment?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have a message
  from your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you in a hurry,&rdquo; she asked carelessly. &ldquo;A lot of
  these people will be going presently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My message is urgent,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;If you cannot
  listen to me now it must remain undelivered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and led him towards a small recess. &ldquo;So
  you come from Anna, do you?&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Well, what is
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Montague Hill is recovering consciousness,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;He will probably make a statement to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds very interesting,&rdquo; she answered coolly.
  &ldquo;Perhaps I should better be able to understand its significance if you
  would explain to me who Mr. Montague Hill is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your husband,&rdquo; he answered bluntly.</p>

  <p>She did not wince. She laughed a little contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You and Anna,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;seem to have stumbled upon a
  mare&rsquo;s nest. If that is my sister&rsquo;s message, pray return to her
  and say that the doings and sayings of Mr. Montague Hill do not interest me
  in the least.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;You were
  seen to leave the flat, and your handkerchief was found there. Very likely by
  this time the whole truth is known.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled at him, an understanding smile, but her words defied him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a beautiful mare&rsquo;s nest!&rdquo; she
  exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161"
     id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> &ldquo;I can see you and Anna groaning
     and nodding your grave heads together. Bah! She does not know me very
     well, and you&mdash;not at all. Do have some tea, won&rsquo;t you? If you
     must, go then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw was dismissed. As he passed out he saw in the hall a quietly
  dressed man with keen grey eyes, talking to one of the footmen. He shivered
  and looked behind as he stepped into his hansom. Had it come already?</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXVII"
     id="Chapter_XXVII"></a><i>Chapter XXVII</i></h2>

  <h3>JOHN FERRINGHAM, GENTLEMAN</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;Confess, my dear husband,&rdquo; Annabel said lightly, &ldquo;that
  you are bewildered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Anna,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, it
  has seemed just lately as though we were becoming in some measure estranged.
  You certainly have not shown much desire for my society, have you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have been wrapped up in your politics,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There have been other times,&rdquo; he said a little sadly.</p>

  <p>Her little white hand stole across the table. There was a look in her eyes
  which puzzled him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been very selfish,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;But you must
  forgive me, John.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would forgive you a great deal more,&rdquo; he answered readily,
  &ldquo;for the sake of an evening like this. You have actually given up a
  dinner-party to dine alone with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And made you give up a political meeting,&rdquo; she reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite an unimportant one,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I would
  have given up anything to see you your old self again&mdash;as you are this
  evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have not been very nice,&rdquo; she said sadly.
  &ldquo;Never mind. You must think of this evening, John, sometimes&mdash;as a
  sort of atonement.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he answered, looking at her in some surprise,
  &ldquo;that we shall have many more such to think about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were lingering over their dessert. The servants had left the room.
  Annabel half filled her glass with wine, and taking a little folded packet
  from her plate, shook the contents into it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am developing ailments,&rdquo; she said, meeting his questioning
  eyes. &ldquo;It is nothing of any importance. John, I have something to say
  to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you want to ask a favour,&rdquo; he remarked
  smiling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163"
     id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> &ldquo;you have made it almost
     impossible for me to refuse you anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am going to ask more than a favour,&rdquo; she said slowly.
  &ldquo;I am going to ask for your forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know what you mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if you are
  referring to any little coolness since our marriage let us never speak of it
  again. I am something of an old fogey, Anna, I&rsquo;m afraid, but if you
  treat me like this you will teach me to forget it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel looked intently into her glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am afraid that I am going to make
  you unhappy. I am very, very sorry, but you must listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He relapsed into a stony silence. A few feet away, across the low vases of
  pink and white roses, sat Annabel, more beautiful to-night perhaps than ever
  before in her life. She wore a wonderful dress of turquoise blue, made by a
  great dressmaker for a function which she knew very well now that she would
  never attend. Her hair once more was arranged with its old simplicity. There
  was a new softness in her eyes, a hesitation, a timidity about her manner
  which was almost pathetic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You remember our first meeting?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered hoarsely. &ldquo;I remember it very well
  indeed. You have the look in your eyes to-night which you had that day, the
  look of a frightened child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked into her glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was frightened then,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I am frightened
  now. But it is all very different. There was hope for me then. Now there is
  none. No, none at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You talk strangely, Anna,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People talked to you in Paris about us,&rdquo; she continued,
  &ldquo;about Anna the virtuous and Annabel the rake. You were accused of
  having been seen with the latter. You denied it, remembering that I had
  called myself Anna. You went even to our rooms and saw my sister. Anna lied
  to you, I lied to you. I was Annabel the rake, &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; of the
  music halls. My name is Annabel, not Anna. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;How could I, when your sister
  sings now at the &lsquo;Unusual&rsquo; every night and the name
  &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; flaunts from every placard in London?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The likeness between us,&rdquo; she said,<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_164"
     id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> &ldquo;before I began to disfigure
     myself with rouge and ill-dressed hair, was remarkable. Anna failed in her
     painting, our money was gone, and she was forced to earn her own living.
     She came to London, and tried several things without any
     success.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John stopped short. With a moment of inward shame he remembered his
  deportment towards Anna. It was scarcely likely that she would have accepted
  his aid. Some one had once, in his hearing, called him a prig. He remembered
  it suddenly. He thought of his severe attitude towards the girl who was
  rightly and with contempt refusing his measured help. He looked across at
  Annabel, and he groaned. This was his humiliation as well as hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna of course would not accept any money from us,&rdquo; she
  continued. &ldquo;She tried everything, and last of all she tried the stage.
  She went to a dramatic agent, and he turned out to be the one who had heard
  me sing in Paris. He refused to believe that Anna was not
  &lsquo;Alcide.&rsquo; He thought she wished to conceal her identity because
  of the connexion with you, and he offered her an engagement at once. She was
  never announced as &lsquo;Alcide,&rsquo; but directly she walked on she
  simply became &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; to every one. She had a better voice than
  I, and the rest I suppose is only a trick. The real
  &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo;,&rdquo; she wound up with a faint smile across the table
  at him, &ldquo;is here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sat like a man turned to stone. Some part of the stiff vigour of the
  man seemed to have subsided. He seemed to have shrunken in his seat. His eyes
  were fixed upon her face, but he opened his lips twice before he spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you married me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her little hand flashed out across the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can spare you that question. I had
  been about as foolish and selfish as a girl could be. I had done the most
  compromising things, and behaved in the most ridiculous way. But from the
  rest&mdash;you saved me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John breathed a long deep sigh. He sat up in his chair again, the
  colour came back to his cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You think that this is
  all. You are going to be generous and forgive. It isn&rsquo;t all. There is
  worse to come. There is a tragedy to come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out with it, then,&rdquo; he cried, almost roughly.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, child, that this is torture for me? What in
  God&rsquo;s name more can you have to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her face had become almost like a marble image. She spoke with a certain
  odd deliberation carefully chosen words which fell like drops of ice upon the
  man who sat listening.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165"
     id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before I met you I was deluded into receiving upon friendly terms a
  man named Hill, who passed himself off as Meysey Hill the railway man, but
  who was in reality an Englishman in poor circumstances. He was going to
  settle I forget how many millions upon me, and I think that I was dazzled. I
  went with him to what I supposed to be the British Embassy, and went through
  a ceremony which I understood to be the usual form of the marriage one used
  there. Afterwards we started for a motor ride to a place outside Paris for
  <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and I suppose the man&rsquo;s nerve failed him. I
  questioned him too closely about his possessions, and remarked upon the fact
  that he was a most inexpert driver, although Meysey Hill had a great
  reputation as a motorist. Anyhow he confessed that he was a fraud. I struck
  him across the face, jumped out and went back by train to Paris. He lost
  control of the machine, was upset and nearly killed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you say,&rdquo; Sir John asked, &ldquo;that the man&rsquo;s
  name was Hill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The man who was found dead in your sister&rsquo;s room was named
  Hill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the man,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I killed him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John clutched at the table with both hands. A slow horror was dawning
  in his fixed eyes. This was not the sort of confession which he had been
  expecting. Annabel had spoken calmly enough and steadily, but his brain
  refused at first to accept the full meaning of her words. It seemed to him
  that a sort of mist had risen up between them. Everything was blurred. Only
  her face was clear, frail and delicate, almost flower-like, with the sad
  haunting eyes ever watching his. Annabel a murderess! It was not
  possible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Child!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You do not know what you say. This
  is part of a dream&mdash;some evil fancy. Think! You could not have done
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head deliberately, hopelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think that I know very well what I am saying,&rdquo; she
  answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166"
     id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> &ldquo;I went to Anna&rsquo;s rooms
     because I felt that I must see her. He was there concealed, waiting her
     return. He recognized me at once, and he behaved like a madman. He swore
     that I was his wife, that chance had given me to him at last. John, he was
     between me and the door. A strong coarse man, and there were things in his
     eyes which made my blood run cold with terror. He came over to me. I was
     helpless. Beside me on Anna&rsquo;s table was a pistol. I was not even
     sure whether it was loaded. I snatched it up, pointed it blindly at him,
     and fired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Sir John exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He fell over at my feet,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I saw him
  stagger and sink down, and the pistol was smoking still in my hand. I bent
  over him. Anna had told me that he carried always with him this bogus
  marriage certificate. I undid his coat, and I took it from his pocket. I
  burned it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the marriage itself?&rdquo; Sir John asked. &ldquo;I do not
  understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was no marriage,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I was very
  foolish to have been deceived even for a moment. There was no marriage, and I
  hated, oh, how I hated the man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did any one see you leave the flat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know. But David Courtlaw has been here. To-night they say
  he will be conscious. He will say who it was. So there is no escape. And
  listen, John.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I went from Anna&rsquo;s flat to Nigel Ennison&rsquo;s rooms. I
  told him the truth. I asked him to take me away, and hide me. He refused. He
  sent me home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John&rsquo;s head bent lower and lower. There was nothing left now of
  the self-assured, prosperous man of affairs. His shoulders were bent, his
  face was furrowed with wrinkles. He looked no longer at his wife. His eyes
  were fixed upon the tablecloth.</p>

  <p>There was a gentle rustling of skirts. Softly she rose to her feet. He
  felt her warm breath upon his cheek, the perfume of her hair as she leaned
  over him. He did not look up, so he did not know that in her other hand she
  held a glass of wine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear husband,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I am so very, very sorry.
  I have brought disgrace upon you, and I haven&rsquo;t been the right sort of
  wife at all. But it is all over now, and presently there will be some one
  else. I should like to have had you forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not move. He seemed to be thinking hard. She paused for a moment.
  Then she raised the glass nearer to her lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, John,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>

  <p>Something in her tone made him look up. In a second the glass lay
  shattered upon the carpet. There was a stain of wine upon her dress.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167"
     id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;God in Heaven, Annabel!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What were you
  doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her voice was a little hysterical. Her unnatural calm was giving way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was poison&mdash;why not?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Who is
  there to care and&mdash;John.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His arms were around her. He kissed her once on the lips with a passion of
  which, during all their days of married life, he had given no sign.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You poor little girl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Forgive you, indeed.
  There isn&rsquo;t a husband breathing, Annabel, who wouldn&rsquo;t have
  blessed that pistol in your hands, and prayed God that the bullet might go
  straight. It is no crime, none at all. It is one of God&rsquo;s laws that a
  woman may defend her honour, even with the shedding of blood. While you
  talked I was only making our plans. It was necessary to think, and think
  quickly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was altogether hysterical now.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;I went to Nigel Ennison for help. I asked him&mdash;to
  take me away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She saw him flinch, but he gave no sign of it in his tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been to blame. It must be my
  fault that you have not learnt that your husband is the man to come
  to&mdash;at such a time as this. Oh, I think I understand, Annabel. You were
  afraid of me, afraid that I should have been shocked, afraid of the scandal.
  Bah. Little woman, you have been brave enough before. Pull yourself together
  now. Drink this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He poured out a glass of wine with a firm hand, and held it to her lips.
  She drank it obediently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, as he watched the colour come back to her
  cheeks. &ldquo;Now listen. You go to your room and ring for your maid. I
  received a telegram, as you know, during dinner. It contains news of the
  serious illness of a near relation at Paris. Your maid has twenty minutes to
  pack your dressing case for one night, and you have the same time to change
  into a travelling dress. In twenty minutes we meet in the hall, remember. I
  will tell you our plans on the way to the station.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you are not coming. There is
  the election&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed derisively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Election be hanged!&rdquo; he exclaimed.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_168"
     id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be childish, Annabel.
     We are off for a second honeymoon. Just one thing more. We may be stopped.
     Don&rsquo;t look so frightened. You called yourself a murderess. You are
     nothing of the sort. What you did is called manslaughter, and at the worst
     there is only a very slight penalty, nothing to be frightened about in the
     least. Remember that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She kissed him passionately, and ran lightly upstairs. In the hall below
  she could hear his firm voice giving quick commands to the servants.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXVIII"
     id="Chapter_XXVIII"></a><i>Chapter XXVIII</i></h2>

  <h3>THE HISSING OF &ldquo;ALCIDE&rdquo;</h3>

  <p>There was a strange and ominous murmur of voices, a shuffling of feet in
  the gallery, a silence, which was like the silence before a storm. Anna, who
  had sung the first verse of her song, looked around the house, a little
  surprised at the absence of the applause which had never yet failed her. She
  realized in a moment what had happened. Even though the individual faces of
  her audience were not to be singled out, she had been conscious from the
  first moment of her appearance that something was wrong. She hesitated, and
  for a moment thought of omitting her second verse altogether. The manager,
  however, who stood in the wings, nodded to her to proceed, and the orchestra
  commenced the first few bars of the music. Then the storm broke. A long
  shrill cat-call in the gallery seemed to be the signal. Then a roar of
  hisses. They came from every part, from the pit, the circle and the gallery,
  even from the stalls. And there arose too, a background of shouts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who killed her husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go and nurse him, missus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Murderess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked from left to right. She was as pale as death, but she seemed
  to have lost the power of movement. They shouted to her from the wings to
  come off. She could not stir hand or foot. A paralyzing horror was upon her.
  Her eardrums were burning with the echoes of those hideous shouts. A
  crumpled-up newspaper thrown from the gallery hit her upon the cheek. The
  stage manager came out from the wings, and taking her hand led her off. There
  was more shouting.</p>

  <p>The stage manager reappeared presently, and made a speech. He
  regretted&mdash;more deeply than he could say&mdash;the occurrence of this
  evening. He fancied that when they had had time to reflect, they would regret
  it still more. (&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;) They had shown themselves grossly
  ignorant of facts. They had chosen to deliberately and wickedly insult a lady
  who had done her best to entertain them for many weeks. He could not promise
  that she would ever appear again in that house. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_170"
     id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>(&ldquo;Good job.&rdquo;) Well, they
     might say that, but he knew very well that before long they would regret
     it. Of his own certain knowledge he could tell them that. For his own part
     he could not sufficiently admire the pluck of this lady, who,
     notwithstanding all that she had been through, had chosen to appear this
     evening rather than break her engagement. He should never sufficiently be
     able to regret the return which they had made to her. He begged their
     attention for the next turn.</p>

  <p>He had spoken impressively, and most likely Anna, had she reappeared,
  would have met with a fair reception. She, however, had no idea of doing
  anything of the sort. She dressed rapidly and left the theatre without a word
  to any one. The whole incident was so unexpected that neither Courtlaw nor
  Brendon were awaiting. The man who sat behind a pigeon-hole, and regulated
  the comings and goings, was for a moment absent. Anna stood on the step and
  looked up and down the street for a hansom. Suddenly she felt her wrist
  grasped by a strong hand. It was Ennison, who loomed up through the
  shadows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna! Thank God I have found you at last. But you have not finished
  surely. Your second turn is not over, is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed a little hardly. Even now she was dazed. The horror of those
  few minutes was still with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you not heard?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For me there is no
  second turn. I have said good-bye to it all. They hissed me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beasts!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But was it wise to sing to-
  night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? The man was nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not seen the evening paper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. What about them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He called a hansom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are full of the usual foolish stories. To-morrow they will all
  be contradicted. To-night all London believes that he was your
  husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is why they hissed me, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. To-morrow they will know the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this hansom for me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;and
  good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am coming with you,&rdquo; he said firmly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she begged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are in trouble,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one has a better
  right than I to be with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have no right at all,&rdquo; she answered coldly.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171"
     id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have the right of the man who loves you,&rdquo; he declared.
  &ldquo;Some day you will be my wife, and it would not be well for either of
  us to remember that in these unhappy days you and I were
  separated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna gave her address to the driver. She leaned back in the cab with
  half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is all madness,&rdquo; she declared wearily. &ldquo;Do you
  think it is fair of you to persecute me just now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not persecution, Anna,&rdquo; he answered gently. &ldquo;Only
  you are the woman I love, and you are in trouble. And you are something of a
  heroine, too. You see, my riddle is solved. I know all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your sister has told me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have seen her&mdash;since last night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shivered a little. She asked no further questions for the moment.
  Ennison himself, with the recollection of Annabel&rsquo;s visit still fresh
  in his mind, was for a moment constrained and ill at ease. When they reached
  her rooms she stepped lightly out upon the pavement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you must go,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I have had a trying
  evening and I need rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need help and sympathy more, Anna,&rdquo; he pleaded,
  &ldquo;and I have the right, yes I have the right to offer you both. I will
  not be sent away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is my wish to be alone,&rdquo; she said wearily. &ldquo;I can
  say no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned and fitted the latchkey into the door. He hesitated for a
  moment and then he followed her. She turned the gas up in her little
  sitting-room, and sank wearily into an easy chair. On the mantelpiece in
  front of her was a note addressed to her in Annabel&rsquo;s handwriting. She
  looked at it with a little shudder, but she made no motion to take it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you say what you have to say, please, and go. I am tired, and
  I want to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He came and stood on the hearthrug close to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you make it all indescribably hard for
  me. Will you not remember what has passed between us? I have the right to
  take my place by your side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have no right at all,&rdquo; she answered.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_172"
     id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> &ldquo;Further than that, I am amazed
     that you should dare to allude to those few moments, to that single moment
     of folly. If ever I could bring myself to ask you any favour, I would ask
     you to forget even as I have forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why in Heaven&rsquo;s name should I forget?&rdquo; he cried.
  &ldquo;I love you, Anna, and I want you for my wife. There is nothing but
  your pride which stands between us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is great deal more,&rdquo; she answered coldly. &ldquo;For
  one thing I am going to marry David Courtlaw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stepped back as though he had received a blow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not possible,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because you are mine. You have told me that you cared. Oh, you
  cannot escape from it. Anna, my love, you cannot have forgotten so
  soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He fancied that she was yielding, but her eyes fell once more upon that
  fatal envelope, and her tone when she spoke was colder than ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was a moment of madness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was lonely.
  I did not know what I was saying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will have your reason for this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will
  have your true reason.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment with fire in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need a reason. Ask your own conscience. What sort of a standard
  of life yours may be I do not know, yet in your heart you know very well that
  every word you have spoken to me has been a veiled insult, every time you
  have come into my presence has been an outrage. That is what stands between
  us, if you would know&mdash;that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She pointed to the envelope still resting upon the mantelpiece. He
  recognized the handwriting, and turned a shade paler. Her eyes noted it
  mercilessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your sister,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What has she told
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do not blame me
  altogether?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am tired,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I want to rest. But if you
  do not leave this room I must.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took up his hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are unjust and quixotic,
  Anna, you have no right to treat any one as you are treating me. And
  yet&mdash;I love you. When you send for me I shall come back. I do not
  believe that you will marry David Courtlaw. I do not think that you will dare
  to marry anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173"
     id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

  <p>He left the room, and she stood motionless, with flaming cheeks, listening
  to his retreating footsteps. When she was quite sure that he was gone she
  took her sister&rsquo;s note from the mantelpiece and slowly broke the
  seal.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Dearest A</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I lied to you. Nigel Ennison was my very good friend, but there
    is not the slightest reason for your not marrying him, if you wish to do
    so.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My husband knows all. We leave England to-night.</p>

    <p class="right">&ldquo;Ever yours,</p>

    <p class="right2"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Annabel</span>.&rdquo;</p>
  </div>

  <p>Anna moved softly to the window, and threw up the sash. Ennison had
  disappeared.</p>

  <h2><a name="Chapter_XXIX"
     id="Chapter_XXIX"></a><i>Chapter XXIX</i></h2>

  <h3>MONTAGUE HILL PLAYS THE GAME</h3>

  <p>The man opened his eyes and looked curiously about him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

  <p>Courtlaw, who was sitting by the bedside, bent over him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are in a private room of St. Felix Hospital,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hospital? What for? What&rsquo;s the matter with me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw&rsquo;s voice sank to a whisper. A nurse was at the other end of
  the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was an accident with a pistol in Miss Pellissier&rsquo;s
  room,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>The light of memory flashed in the man&rsquo;s face. His brows drew a
  little nearer together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Accident! She shot me,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I had found her
  at last, and she shot me. Listen, you. Am I going to die?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that you are in a dangerous state,&rdquo; Courtlaw
  answered gravely. &ldquo;The nurse will fetch the doctor directly. I wanted
  to speak to you first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a friend of Miss Pellissier&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Courtlaw
  answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Miss Pellissier in whose rooms you were, and who sings at the
  &lsquo;Unusual,&rsquo;&rdquo; Courtlaw answered. &ldquo;The Miss Pellissier
  who was at White&rsquo;s with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember you now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So it seems that I was
  wrong. Annabel was in hiding all the time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel Pellissier is married,&rdquo; Courtlaw said quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my wife,&rdquo; the man muttered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; Courtlaw said, &ldquo;that you too were
  deceived. Where were you married?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At the English Embassy in Paris. You will find the certificate in
  my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And who made the arrangements for you, and sent you there?&rdquo;
  Courtlaw asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hainault, Celeste&rsquo;s friend. He did everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; Courtlaw said.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_175"
     id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> &ldquo;You too were deceived. The place
     to which you went was not the English Embassy, and the whole performance
     was a fraud. I heard rumours of it in Paris, and the place since then has
     been closed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Hainault&mdash;assured&mdash;me&mdash;that the marriage was
  binding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it would have been at the English Embassy,&rdquo; Courtlaw
  answered, &ldquo;but the place to which you went was not the English Embassy.
  It was rigged up for the occasion as it has been many a time
  before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Hainault&mdash;was&mdash;a pal. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
  understand,&rdquo; the man faltered wearily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hainault was Celeste&rsquo;s friend, and Celeste was
  Annabel&rsquo;s enemy,&rdquo; Courtlaw said. &ldquo;It was a plot amongst
  them all to humiliate her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then she has never been my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never for a second. She is the wife now of another man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hill closed his eyes. For fully five minutes he lay quite motionless. Then
  he opened them again suddenly, to find Courtlaw still by his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a bad day for me,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly and
  painfully. &ldquo;A bad thing for me when that legacy came. I thought
  I&rsquo;d see Paris, do the thing&mdash;like a toff. And I heard
  &lsquo;Alcide&rsquo; sing, and that little dance she did. I was in the front
  row, and I fancied she smiled at me. Lord, what a state I was in! Night after
  night I sat there, I watched her come in, I watched her go. She dropped a
  flower&mdash;it&rsquo;s in my pocket-book now. I couldn&rsquo;t rest or eat
  or sleep. I made Hainault&rsquo;s acquaintance, stood him drinks, lent him
  money. He shook his head all the time. Annabel Pellissier was not like the
  others, he said. She had a few acquaintances, English gentlemen, but she
  lived with her sister&mdash;was a lady. But one day he came to me. It was
  Celeste&rsquo;s idea. I could be presented as Meysey Hill. We were alike. He
  was&mdash;a millionaire. And I passed myself off as Meysey Hill, and
  since&mdash;then&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t had a minute&rsquo;s peace. God help
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw was alarmed at the man&rsquo;s pallor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk any more,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I want
  you to listen to me just for a moment. The doctor will be here to see you in
  five minutes. The nurse sent for him as soon as she saw that you were
  conscious. It is very possible that he will ask you to tell him before
  witnesses how you received your wound.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man smiled at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are their friend, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Courtlaw answered.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176"
     id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The one whose life you have been making a burden, who has been all
  the time shielding her sister. I would have married her long ago, but she
  will not have me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring her&mdash;here,&rdquo; Hill muttered.
  &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The door opened, and the doctor entered softly. Hill closed his eyes.
  Courtlaw stood up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has asked to see some one,&rdquo; he whispered to the doctor.
  &ldquo;Is there any urgency?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The doctor bent over his patient, who seemed to have fallen asleep.
  Presently he turned to Courtlaw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I would fetch any one whom he
  has asked to see. His condition is not unfavourable, but there may be a
  relapse at any moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So only a few minutes after Ennison&rsquo;s departure, while Anna stood
  indeed with her sister&rsquo;s open letter still in her hand, Courtlaw drove
  up in hot haste. She opened the door to him herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you come round to the hospital?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Hill
  has asked for you, and they will take his depositions to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She slipped on her cloak and stepped into the hansom with him. They drove
  rapidly through the emptying streets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible to say,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We have a private
  room at St. Felix. Everything is being done that can be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are sure that he asked for me&mdash;not for Annabel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; Courtlaw answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he accused any one yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have scarcely left his
  side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was still conscious when they reached the hospital and his state was
  much more favourable. The doctor and another man were by his bedside when
  they entered the room, and there were writing materials which had evidently
  been used close at hand. He recognised Anna, and at once addressed her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;for coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The doctor has
  asked me to give them my reasons&mdash;for shooting myself. I&rsquo;ve told
  them all that was necessary, but I&mdash;wanted to ask your pardon&mdash;for
  having made myself a nuisance to you, and for breaking into your
  rooms&mdash;and to thank you&mdash;the doctor says you bound up my
  wound&mdash;or I should have bled to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgive you willingly,&rdquo; Anna said, bending over him.
  &ldquo;It has all been a mistake, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more talking,&rdquo; the doctor interposed.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177"
     id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want two words&mdash;with Miss Pellissier alone,&rdquo; Hill
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>The doctor frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are not by any means a dying
  man now, but you&rsquo;ll never pull through if you don&rsquo;t husband your
  strength.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two words only,&rdquo; Hill repeated.</p>

  <p>They all left the room. Anna leaned over so that he needed only to
  whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell your sister she was right to shoot, quite right. I meant
  mischief. But tell her this, too. I believed that our marriage was genuine. I
  believed that she was my wife, or she would have been safe from
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell her,&rdquo; Anna promised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I have
  signed a statement that I shot myself; bad trade and drink, both
  true&mdash;both true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His eyes were closed. Anna left the room on tiptoe. She and Courtlaw drove
  homewards together.</p>

     id="Chapter_XXX"></a><i>Chapter XXX</i></h2>

  <h3>SIR JOHN&rsquo;S NECKTIE</h3>

  <p>Sir John, in a quiet dark travelling suit, was sitting in a pokey little
  room writing letters. The room was worse than pokey, it was shabby; and the
  view from the window, of chimney pots and slate roofs, wholly uninspiring.
  Nevertheless, Sir John had the look of a man who was enjoying himself. He
  seemed years younger, and the arrangement of his tie and hair were almost
  rakish. He stamped his last letter as Annabel entered.</p>

  <p>She was dressed for the street very much as her own maid was accustomed to
  dress, and there was a thick veil attached to her hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I must eat or die. Do get your
  hat, and we will go to that corner caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I know the place you
  mean&mdash;very good cooking for such an out-of-the-way show. I&rsquo;ll be
  ready in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John stamped his letters, brushed his hat, and carefully gave his
  moustache an upward curl before the looking-glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really do not believe,&rdquo; he announced with satisfaction,
  &ldquo;that any one would recognize me. What do you think,
  Annabel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they would,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;You
  seem to have cultivated quite a jaunty appearance, and you certainly look
  years younger. One would think that you enjoyed crawling away out of your
  world into hiding, with a very foolish wicked wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you are right. I really am
  enjoying it. It is like a second honeymoon. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fear
  that after all&mdash;but we won&rsquo;t think of that. I don&rsquo;t believe
  any one could have traced us here. You see, we travelled second class, and we
  are in the least known quarter of Paris. To-night we leave for Marseilles. On
  Thursday we embark for South America.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a marvellous courier,&rdquo; she declared, as they passed
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179"
     id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>into the street. &ldquo;You see, I will
     take your arm. It looks so French to be affectionate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are some French customs,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;which are
  admirable. I presume that I may not kiss you in the street?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not, sir,&rdquo; she replied, laughing. &ldquo;If you
  attempted such a thing it would be in order that I should smack you hard with
  the palm of my hand upon the cheek.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is another French custom,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;which is
  not so agreeable. Here we are. Shall we sit outside and drink a <i>petit
  verre</i> of something to give us an appetite while dinner is being
  prepared?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am already so hungry
  that I shall begin on the <i>petit pains</i>. I have an appetite which I dare
  not increase.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They entered the place, a pleasant little caf&eacute; of the sort to be
  met with in the outlying parts of Paris. Most of the tables were for those
  who smoked only and drank wine, but there were a few spread with tablecloths
  and laid for dinner. Sir John and Annabel seated themselves at one of them,
  and the proprietor himself, a small dark-visaged man, radiant with smiles,
  came hurrying up, followed by a waiter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur would dine! It was very good! And Madame, of
  course?&rdquo; with a low bow. The <i>carte de jour</i> was before Monsieur.
  He had but to give his orders. Monsieur could rely upon his special
  attention, and for the cooking&mdash;well, he had his customers, who came
  from their homes to him year after year. And always they were well satisfied.
  He waited the pleasure of Monsieur.</p>

  <p>Sir John gave his order, deliberately stumbling now and then over a word,
  and anglicizing others. When he had finished he took up the wine list and
  ordered a bottle of dry champagne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said to Anna afterwards, &ldquo;that it was
  a mistake to order the champagne sec. They will guess that I am
  English.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel leaned back in her chair and laughed till the tears stood in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you really think that they would take you for a
  Frenchman?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;These clothes
  are French, and I&rsquo;m sure this floppy bow would make a Frenchman of me
  anyhow. Perhaps I ought to have let you order the dinner, but I think I got
  through it pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; Anna exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_180"
     id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> &ldquo;Thank Heaven, they are bringing
     the <i>hors d&rsquo;oeuvres</i>. John, I shall eat that whole tin of
     sardines. Do take them away from me after I have had four.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Sir John remarked complacently, &ldquo;it is
  astonishing how easy it is for people with brains and a little knowledge of
  the world to completely hide themselves. I am absolutely certain that up to
  the present we have escaped all notice, and I do not believe that any casual
  observer would take us for English people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A man who had been sitting with his hat tilted over his eyes at an
  adjacent table had risen to his feet and stood suddenly before them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Permit me to offer you the English paper which has just arrived,
  Sir John,&rdquo; he said, holding out a <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. &ldquo;You
  may find in it a paragraph of some interest to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John was speechless. It was Annabel who caught at the paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;appear to know my name, sir,&rdquo; Sir John said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the stranger remarked good-humouredly. &ldquo;I
  know you very well by sight, Sir John. It is my business to know most people.
  We were fellow passengers from Charing Cross, and we have been fellow lodgers
  in the Rue d&rsquo;Entrepot. I trust you will not accuse me of discourtesy if
  I express my pleasure that henceforth our ways will lie apart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A little sobbing cry from Annabel arrested Sir John&rsquo;s attention. The
  stranger with a bow returned to his table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Read this, John.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Bucknall Mansions
    Mystery</span>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Montague Hill, the man who was found lying wounded in Bucknall
    Mansions late on Wednesday night in the rooms of a well-known artiste, has
    recovered sufficiently to make a statement to the police. It appears that
    he was an unsuccessful admirer of the lady in question, and he admits that,
    under the influence of drink, he broke into her rooms, and there made a
    determined attempt at suicide. He further gave the name and address of the
    firm from whom he purchased the revolver and cartridges, a member of which
    firm has since corroborated his statement.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hill&rsquo;s confession will finally refute a number of absurd
    stories which have been in circulation during the last few days. We
    understand that, notwithstanding the serious nature of the man&rsquo;s
    injuries, there is every possibility of his recovery.&rdquo;</p>
  </div>

  <p>Annabel pulled down her veil to hide the tears. Sir John filled his glass
  with trembling hand.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181"
     id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
     &ldquo;The fellow is not such a blackguard, after all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel&rsquo;s hand stole into his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I have dragged you all over here for nothing,&rdquo; she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For nothing, do you call it?&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I
  wouldn&rsquo;t have been without this trip for worlds. It has been a real
  honeymoon trip, Annabel, for I feel that it has given me a wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel pulled up her veil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed affectionately. &ldquo;I do
  hope that I shall be able to make it up to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John&rsquo;s reply was incoherent. He called a waiter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gar&ccedil;on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you ask the gentleman at
  the next table if he will do me the honour of taking a glass of wine with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The stranger came over to them smiling. He had been on the point of
  leaving the restaurant. He accepted the glass of wine, and bowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I drink your very good health, Sir John and Lady
  Ferringhall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I wish you a pleasant journey back to
  England. If I might take the liberty, Sir John,&rdquo; he added, with a
  humorous gleam in his eyes, &ldquo;I should like to congratulate you upon
  your tie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="pic15"

    <img src="1203111h-images/Anna15.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration" />
  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, damn the thing!&rdquo; Sir John exclaimed, tucking the loose
  ends inside his coat.</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>&ldquo;I propose,&rdquo; Sir John said, &ldquo;that we pay for our
  dinner&mdash;which we haven&rsquo;t had&mdash;tip the gar&ccedil;on a
  sovereign, and take a cab to the Ritz.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annabel shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at our clothes,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and besides, the
  funny little proprietor has gone down himself to help it along. He would be
  so disappointed. I am sure it will be good, John, and I could eat anything.
  No, let us dine here, and then go and have our coffee on the boulevards. We
  can take our things up with us and stay at the Continental or the
  Ritz.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; Sir John declared. &ldquo;We will do Paris like
  the tourists, and thank God here comes dinner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Everything was good. The gar&ccedil;on was tipped as he had never been
  tipped before in his life. They drove up into Paris in an open <i>fiacre</i>
  with a soft cool wind blowing in their faces, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_182"
     id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>hand in hand beneath the rug. They went
     first to a hotel, and then out again on to the boulevards. The natural
     gaiety of the place seemed to have affected them both. They laughed and
     talked and stared about them. She took his hand in hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear John,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We are to begin our married
  life to-night&mdash;here where I first met you. I shall only pray that I may
  reward you for all your goodness to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir John, frankly oblivious of the possibility of passers-by, took her
  into his arms and kissed her. Then he stood up and hailed a
  <i>fiacre</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hotel Ritz!&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>ANNA&rsquo;S TEA PARTY</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t the least idea who I am,&rdquo; Lady
  Lescelles said, as she settled herself in Anna&rsquo;s most comfortable
  chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of you, of course,&rdquo; Anna answered hesitatingly,
  &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cannot imagine what I have come to see you about. Well, I am
  Nigel Ennison&rsquo;s sister!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Anna said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nigel is like all men,&rdquo; Lady Lescelles continued. &ldquo;He
  is a sad blunderer. He has helped me out of scrapes though, no end of times.
  He is an awfully good sort&mdash;and now he has come to me to help him if I
  can. Do you know that he is very much in love with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;He has said something of the
  sort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you have sent him about his business. He tells me that you will
  not even see him. I don&rsquo;t want to bother you, of course. A woman has a
  perfect right to choose her own husband, but Nigel seemed to think that there
  was something a little mysterious about your treatment of him. You seemed, he
  thought, to have some grievance which you would not explain and which he
  thought must arise from a misunderstanding. There, that sounds frightfully
  involved, doesn&rsquo;t it, but perhaps you can make out what I mean.
  Don&rsquo;t you care for Nigel at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna was silent for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>Lady Lescelles, graceful, very fashionably but quietly dressed, leaned
  back and watched her with shrewd kindly eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I like your brother better than any other man I know,&rdquo; Anna
  said at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think you told him as much as that, did
  you?&rdquo; Lady Lescelles asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;To be frank with you, Lady
  Lescelles, when your brother asked me the other day to be his wife I was
  under a false impression as regards his relations&mdash;with some other
  person. I know now that I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184"
     id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds more promising,&rdquo; Lady Lescelles declared.
  &ldquo;May I tell Nigel to come and see you again? I am not here to do his
  love-making for him, you know. I came to see you on my own
  account.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;It is very nice of
  you to come, but I do not think for the present, at any rate, I could give
  him any other answer. I do not intend to be married, or to become engaged
  just at present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; Lady Lescelles asked, smiling. &ldquo;I can
  only be a few years older than you, and I have been married four years. I can
  assure you, I wouldn&rsquo;t be single again for worlds. One gets a lot more
  fun married.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our cases are scarcely similar,&rdquo; Anna remarked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Lady Lescelles answered. &ldquo;You are one of the
  Hampshire Pellissiers, I know, and your family are quite as good as ours. As
  for money, Nigel has tons of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly that,&rdquo; Anna answered, &ldquo;but to
  tell you the truth, I cannot bear to look upon myself as a rank failure. We
  girls, my sister and I, were left quite alone when our father died, and I
  made up my mind to make some little place in the world for myself. I tried
  painting and couldn&rsquo;t get on. Then I came to London and tried almost
  everything&mdash;all failures. I had two offers of marriage from men I liked
  very much indeed, but it never occurred to me to listen to either of them.
  You see I am rather obstinate. At last I tried a dramatic agent, and got on
  the music hall stage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re a failure there,&rdquo; Lady
  Lescelles remarked, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to hear you lots of
  times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been more fortunate than I deserved,&rdquo; Anna answered,
  &ldquo;but I only meant to stay upon the music hall stage until I could get
  something better. I am rehearsing now for a new play at the
  &lsquo;Garrick&rsquo; and I have quite made up my mind to try and make some
  sort of position for myself as an actress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it is really worth while?&rdquo; Lady Lescelles asked
  gently. &ldquo;I am sure you will marry Nigel sooner or later, and then all
  your work will be thrown away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I were to marry now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it would be with a
  sense of humiliation. I should feel that I had been obliged to find some one
  else to fight my battles for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else,&rdquo; Lady Lescelles murmured, &ldquo;are men
  for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo; she said,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_185"
     id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> &ldquo;I should be perfectly content to
     have everything done for me. But I do think that if a girl is to feel
     comfortable about it they should start fairly equal. Take your case, for
     instance. You brought your husband a large fortune, your people were well
     known in society, your family interest I have heard was useful to him in
     his parliamentary career. So far as I am concerned, I am just now a
     hopeless nonentity. Your brother has everything&mdash;I have not shown
     myself capable even of earning my own living except in a way which could
     not possibly bring any credit upon anybody. And beyond this, Lady
     Lescelles, as you must know, recent events have set a good many
     people&rsquo;s tongues wagging, and I am quite determined to live down all
     this scandal before I think of marrying any one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; Lady Lescelles said, gently, &ldquo;that the last
  consideration need not weigh with you in the least. No one in the world is
  beyond the shaft of scandal&mdash;we all catch it terribly sometimes. It
  simply doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Anna said. &ldquo;I do hope I have been
  able to make you understand how I feel, that you don&rsquo;t consider me a
  hopeless prig. It does sound a little horrid to talk so much about oneself
  and to have views.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Lady Lescelles said, putting down her teacup,
  &ldquo;that I must send Nigel to plead his own cause. I may tell him, at any
  rate, that you will see him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall like to see him,&rdquo; Anna answered. &ldquo;I really owe
  him something of an apology.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell him,&rdquo; Lady Lescelles said. &ldquo;And now let us
  leave the men alone and talk about ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr class="medium" />

  <p>&ldquo;I am delighted to see you all here,&rdquo; Anna said smiling upon
  them from behind the tea-tray, &ldquo;but I shall have to ask you to excuse
  me for a few minutes. My agent is here, and he has brought his contract for
  me to sign. I will give you all some tea, and then I must leave you for a few
  minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The three men, who had arrived within a minute or two of one another,
  received her little speech in dead silence. Ennison, who had been standing
  with his back to the window, came suddenly a little further into the
  room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I came here this afternoon
  hoping particularly to see you for a few moments before you signed that
  contract.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186"
     id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We may just as well have our talk afterwards,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;and I need not keep poor Mr. Earles waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw suddenly interposed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I be allowed to say,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that I came
  here with the same intention.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; Brendon echoed.</p>

  <p>Anna was suddenly very quiet.</p>

  <p>She was perhaps as near tears as ever before in her life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I had three hands,&rdquo; she said, with a faint smile, &ldquo;I
  would give one to each of you. I know that you are all my friends, and I know
  that you all have very good advice to give me. But I am afraid I am a
  shockingly obstinate and a very ungrateful person. No, don&rsquo;t let me
  call myself that. I am grateful, indeed I am. But on this matter my mind is
  quite made up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ennison hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Pellissier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these gentlemen are your
  friends, and therefore they are my friends. If I am to have no other
  opportunity I will speak before them. I came here to beg you not to sign that
  contract. I came to beg you instead to do me the honour of becoming my
  wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Courtlaw said, &ldquo;although I have asked before in
  vain, have come to ask you once more the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Brendon said, humbly, &ldquo;although I am afraid
  there is no chance for me, my errand was the same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Anna looked at them for a moment with a pitiful attempt at a smile. Then
  her head disappeared suddenly in her hands, and her shoulders shook
  violently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please forgive me&mdash;for one moment,&rdquo; she sobbed.
  &ldquo;I&mdash;I shall be all right directly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon rushed to the piano and strummed out a tune.</p>

  <p>The others hurried to the window. And Anna was conscious of a few moments
  of exquisite emotion. After all, life had still its pulsations. The joy of
  being loved thrilled her as nothing before had ever done, a curious abstract
  joy which had nothing in it at that moment of regret or even pity.</p>

  <p>She called them back very soon.</p>

  <p>The signs of tears had all gone, but some subtle change seemed to have
  stolen into her face. She spoke readily enough, but there was a new timidity
  in her manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; she said,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_187"
     id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> &ldquo;my dear friends, I am going to
     make the same answer to all of you&mdash;and that is perhaps you will say
     no answer at all. At present I cannot marry, I will not become bound even
     to any one. It would be very hard perhaps to make you understand just how
     I feel about it. I won&rsquo;t try. Only I feel that you all want to make
     life too easy for me, and I am determined to fight my own battles a little
     longer. If any of you&mdash;or all of you feel the same in six
     months&rsquo; time from to-day, will you come, if you care to, and see me
     then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Ennison spoke at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will sign the contract?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall sign the contract. I think that I am very fortunate to have
  it to sign.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; Courtlaw asked, &ldquo;that from now to the end
  of the six months you do not wish to see us&mdash;any of us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her eyes were a little dim again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do mean that,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I want to have no
  distractions. My work will be all sufficient. I have an aunt who is coming to
  live with me, and I do not intend to receive any visitors at all. It will be
  a little lonely sometimes,&rdquo; she said, looking around at them,
  &ldquo;and I shall miss you all, but it is the fairest for myself&mdash;and I
  think for you. Do not avoid me if we meet by accident, but I trust to you all
  not to let the accident happen if you can help it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brendon rose and came towards her with outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Pellissier, and success to you,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;May you have as much good fortune as you deserve, but not enough to
  make you forget us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Courtlaw rose too.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are of the genus obstinate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not
  know whether to wish you success or not. I will wish you success or failure,
  whichever is the better for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Ennison said, holding her fingers tightly, and
  forcing her to look into his eyes, &ldquo;I will tell you what I have wished
  for you when we meet six months from to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Up the moss-grown path, where the rose bushes run wild, almost met, came
  Anna in a spotless white gown, with the flush of her early morning walk in
  her cheeks, and something of the brightness of it in her eyes. In one hand
  she carried a long-stalked red rose, dripping with dew, in the other the
  post-bag.</p>

  <p>She reached a tiny yellow-fronted cottage covered with flowering creepers,
  and entered the front room by the wide-open window. Breakfast was laid for
  one, a dish of fruit and a shining coffee equipage. By the side of her plate
  was a small key. With trembling fingers she opened the post-bag. There was
  one letter. One only.</p>

  <p>She opened and read it at once. It was dated from the House of Commons on
  the previous day.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Pellissier</span>,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-morrow the six months will be up. For days I have been
    undecided as to whether I would come to you or no. I would like you to
    believe that the decision I have arrived at&mdash;to stay away&mdash;is
    wholly and entirely to save you pain. It should be the happiest day of your
    life, and I would not detract from its happiness by letting you remember
    for a moment that there are others to whom your inevitable decision must
    bring some pain.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;For I know that you love Ennison. You tried bravely enough to
    hide your preference, to look at us all with the same eyes, to speak to us
    in the same tone. It was not your fault you failed. If by any chance I have
    made a mistake a word will bring me to you. But I know very well that that
    word will never be spoken.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your great success has been my joy, our joy as well as yours. You
    have made for yourself a unique place upon the stage. We have so many
    actresses who aspire to great things in the drama, not one who can
    interpret as you have interpreted it, the delicate finesse, the finer
    lights and shades of true comedy. Ennison will make a thousand enemies if
    he takes you from the stage. Yet I think that he will do it.</p>

    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189"
       id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>&ldquo;For my own part I have come
       fully now into my inheritance. I am bound to admit that I greatly enjoy
       my altered life. Every minute I spend here is an education to me. Before
       very long I hope to have definite work. Some of my schemes are already
       in hand. People shrug their shoulders and call me a crazy socialist. Yet
       I fancy that we who have been poor ourselves must be the best judges of
       the needs of the people.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You will write to me, I am sure&mdash;and from the date of your
    letter I trust most earnestly that I may come back to my old place as</p>

    <p class="right">&ldquo;Your devoted friend,</p>

    <p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Walter
    Brendon</span>.&rdquo;</p>
  </div>

  <p>She set the letter down, and drew from her pocket another with a foreign
  post mark which had come the day before. This one too she read.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hassell&rsquo;s
    Camp</span>,</p>

    <p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Near Colorado</span>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On or about the day you receive this letter, Anna, the six months
    will be up. Do you expect me, I wonder. I think not. At any rate, here I
    am, and here I shall be, twenty thousand feet above all your poison-reeking
    cities, up where God&rsquo;s wind comes fresh from heaven, very near indeed
    to the untrodden snows. Sometimes I tremble, Anna, to think how near I came
    to passing through life without a single glimpse, a moment&rsquo;s
    revelation of this greatest and most awful of mysteries, the mystery of
    primaeval nature. It is a true saying that in the mountains there is peace.
    One&rsquo;s sense of proportion, battered out of all shape in the daily
    life of cities, reasserts itself. I love you still, Anna, but life holds
    other things than the love of man for woman. Some day I shall come back,
    and I will show you on canvas the things which have come to me up here
    amongst the eternal silence.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Many nights I have thought of you, Anna. Your face has flitted
    out of my watch-fire, and then I have been a haunted man. But with the
    morning, the glorious unstained morning the passion of living would stir
    even the blood of a clod. It comes over the mountains, Anna, pink darkening
    into orange red, everywhere a wonderful cloud sea, scintillating with
    colour. It is enough to make a man throw away canvas and brushes into the
    bottomless precipices, enough to make one weep with despair at his utter
    and absolute impotence. Nature is God, Anna, and the greatest artist of us
    all a pigmy. When I think of those ateliers of ours, the art jargon, the
    decadents with their flamboyant talk I long <span class='pagenum'><a name=
    "Page_190"
       id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>for a two-edged sword and a minute of
       Divinity. To perdition with them all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I shall come back, if at all, a new man. I have a new cult to
    teach, a new enthusiasm. I feel years younger, a man again. My first visit
    will be to you. I must tell you all about God&rsquo;s land, this marvellous
    virgin country, with its silent forests and dazzling peaks. I make no
    apology for not being with you now. You love Ennison. Believe me, the
    bitterness of it has almost departed, crushed out of me together with much
    of the weariness and sorrow I brought with me here by the nameless glory of
    these lonely months. Yet I shall think of you to-day. I pray, Anna, that
    you may find your happiness.</p>

    <p class="right">&ldquo;Your friend,</p>

    <p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">David Courtlaw</span>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I do not congratulate you on your success. I was
    certain of it. I am glad or sorry according as it has brought you
    happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  </div>

  <p>Anna&rsquo;s eyes were a little dim as she poured out her coffee, and the
  laugh she attempted was not altogether a success.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is all very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but two out of the
  three are rank deserters&mdash;and if the papers tell the truth the third is
  as bad. I believe I am doomed to be an old maid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She finished her breakfast and strolled out across the garden with the
  letters still in her hand. Beyond was a field sloping steeply upwards, and at
  the top a small pine plantation. She climbed slowly towards it, keeping close
  to the hedge side, fragrant with wild roses, and holding her skirts high
  above the dew-laden grass. Arrived in the plantation she sat down with her
  back against a tree trunk.</p>

  <p>Already the warm sun was drawing from the pines their delicious odour.
  Below her stretched a valley of rich meadowland, of yellow cornfields, and
  beyond moorland hillside glorious with purple heather and golden gorse. She
  tried to compose her thoughts, to think of the last six months, to steep
  herself in the calm beauty of the surroundings. And she found herself able to
  do nothing of the sort. A new restlessness seemed to have stolen in upon her.
  She started at the falling of a leaf, at the lumbering of a cow through the
  hedge. Her heart was beating with quite unaccustomed vigour, her hands were
  hot, she was conscious of a warmth in her blood which the summer sunshine was
  scarcely responsible for. She struggled against it quite uselessly. She knew
  very well that a new thing was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191"
     id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>stirring in her. The period of repression
     was over. It is foolish, she murmured to herself, foolish. He will not
     come. He cannot.</p>

  <p>And then all her restlessness was turned to joy. She sprang to her feet
  and stood listening with parted lips and eager eyes. So he found her when he
  came round the corner of the spinney.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; he cried eagerly.</p>

  <p>She held out her arms to him and smiled.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>&ldquo;And where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;are my rivals?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deserters,&rdquo; she answered, laughing. &ldquo;It is you alone,
  Nigel, who have saved me from being an old maid. Here are their
  letters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took them from her and read them. When he came to a certain sentence in
  Brendon&rsquo;s letter he stopped short and looked up at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Brendon and I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have been troubled with
  the same fears. I too, Anna, have watched and read of your success
  with&mdash;I must confess it&mdash;some misgiving.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please tell me why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you need me to tell you? You have tasted the luxury of power.
  You have made your public, you are already a personage. And I want you for
  myself&mdash;for my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She took his hand and smiled upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, Nigel,&rdquo; she said softly,
  &ldquo;that it was precisely for this I have worked so hard. It is just the
  aim I have had in view all the time. I wanted to have something to give up. I
  did not care&mdash;no woman really cares&mdash;to play the beggar maid to
  your King Cophetua.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you will really give it all up!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When we go indoors I will show you the offers I have
  refused,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;They have all been trying to turn my
  head. I think that nearly every manager in London has made me an offer. My
  reply to all of them has been the same. My engagement at the
  &lsquo;Garrick&rsquo; terminates Saturday week, and then I am
  free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will make me horribly conceited,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  think that I shall be the most unpopular man in London. You are not playing
  to-night, are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192"
     id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; she answered.
     &ldquo;I am giving my understudy a chance. I am going up to dine with my
     sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annabel is a prophetess,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I too am
  asked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a conspiracy,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Come, we must go
  home and have some luncheon. My little maidservant will think that I am
  lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They clambered down the hill together. The air was sweet with the perfume
  of flowers, and the melody of murmuring insects, the blue sky was cloudless,
  the heat of the sun was tempered by the heather-scented west wind. Ennison
  paused by the little gate.</p>

  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have found the real home
  of the lotus-eaters. Here one might live the life of golden days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither you nor I, Nigel, are made of such stuff,&rdquo; she
  answered. &ldquo;These are the playgrounds of life. The great heart of the
  world beats only where men and women are gathered together. You have your
  work before you, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kissed her on the lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you mean me to be Prime
  Minister.&rdquo;</p>
