  <h3>PRODUCTION NOTE</h3>

<p class="note">According to bibliographic records available
found on the Internet, at least four of the eleven stories in
this collection were first published in the American monthly
magazine <i>Woman's Home Companion</i> with illustrations by Roy
Frederick Spreter as a series with the general title <i>Advice,
Ltd</i>. Only two of the individual story titles used in the
magazine are recorded, and, since only one of these ("The
Listening Lady") appears under the same name in the this
collection, the other ("The Ranelagh Mystery") was evidently
renamed for book publication. Three of the other stories were
published under the general title "Sibyl Stories" in <i>Ladies'
Home Journal</i>. Six of the stories in the book could not be
associated with a specific magazine: one of them is presumably a
"Sibyl" story, while two of them are presumably part of the
"Advice, Ltd." series.</p>

<p class="note">The following table summarizes the publication
record so far as it could be determined when the present e-book
was last updated (January 2019).</p>

<p class="note">The text below is a restored version of the
story as it was originally printed, under the title "Sybil:
The Oracle of Merton Mews," in the June 1933 issue of
<i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>. The text printed in the book
<i>Advice, Ltd.</i>, was an abridged version.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE long boat train, which had only a few
minutes before started on its race to Victoria, came to an
unexpected halt alongside the almost deserted platform of Dover
Town Station. Habitual travelers who knew the irregularity of
such a proceeding let down the windows and leaned out from their
places. There was little to be seen, however, and nothing to be
learned from the various attendants.</p>

<p>About a dozen officials, and men who looked like officials in
mufti, were forming a sort of ring around one of the vans in the
rear of the train, from which a number of heavy, iron-clamped
cases were being unloaded. The proceeding was entirely
unusual.</p>

<p>Curious questions and comments flashed backward and forward
among the passengers. The train attendants, however, knew nothing
of what was going on.</p>

<p>"What the mischief are those boxes they are throwing out?" a
well-known, middle-aged Englishman asked irritably. "Surely it is
not necessary to stop a Continental train, already an hour late,
to bring cases from Dover Pier to Dover Town?"</p>

<p>The attendant's voice trailed off into an almost awed whisper.
"Them's what they calls specie cases, sir," he confided. "Used by
the big banks for carrying bar gold."</p>

<p>His questioner stared at him. "What in the name of common
sense," he demanded, "do they mean by loading up specie boxes or
any other sort of box at the pier station, only to throw them out
here?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "Ask me another, sir," he replied,
passing on. "There's none of us knows what's up."</p>

<p>John Woolston, for fifteen years inspector of Pullman cars,
had no intention of answering any more questions. He changed his
mind, however, when the most beautiful woman of his acquaintance
leaned out of the coupe which, according to custom, he had
reserved specially for her use.</p>

<p>"What is this delay, Woolston?" she asked pathetically. "And
what arc those funny little boxes they are throwing out on to the
platform?"</p>

<p>The man stepped a few feet inside the coupe and removed his
cap. Except for one mad English duke, who sometimes had lapses of
memory and therefore was not altogether to be relied upon, this
was the most profitable of all his regular passengers.</p>

<p>"To tell your ladyship the truth," he said, "I'll guarantee
there's not one of us on the train&mdash;unless maybe the
guard&mdash;who knows what is going on. I can tell you what the
boxes are though. They are made specially down in Tooley Street
and they are used for transporting gold."</p>

<p>The lady pushed back the veil she was wearing and looked at
him through wide-opened eyes.</p>

<p>"But, my good man," she protested, speaking very musically but
with a slight foreign accent, "who on earth in their senses would
unload bar gold on the platform of Dover Town Station?"</p>

<p>"All I can say, your ladyship," the man pointed out, "is that
they are doing it. The cases came off the boat, the French guard
left us and the English took over the job. They were placed in
the usual van and here we are&mdash;barely started on the journey
and an hour late already, when on go the brakes and out come them
boxes. If I hear anything later, your ladyship, I will let you
know."</p>

<p>"Do," she begged. "It seems such an odd thing to happen."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship's car will be at Victoria as usual?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She nodded. "And my maid will see the things through the
customs," she said. "I shall hurry away. You might see that I
have an intelligent porter. I shall take only my dressing case
with me."</p>

<p>The man passed on his way with a final salute. Clara, Baroness
von Linz, looked thoughtfully out of the window. Her eyes were
fixed upon the curiously silent group of men standing almost in a
circle around the pile of boxes. Every few seconds a porter with
a box on his shoulder hurried off, escorted as far as the subway
by a custodian who was evidently some sort of an official. She
yawned and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Some tea," she ordered a trifle imperiously of the
attendant.</p>

<p>Long before it was brought the train, with its snakelike bend,
had glided away from the station. The baroness yawned once more,
opened a magazine which she had bought on leaving the steamer,
and began to read.</p>

<p><br>
THROUGH the grim falling darkness the boat train, flaring with
lights, spitting flame and vomiting smoke from the funnels of
both its engines, tore through the countryside on its rush to
London.</p>

<p>Almost parallel with it but continually veering eastward a
motor van, built after the style of the modern armored car,
traveling also at great speed, was cleaving the same blackness of
the winter night, increased by the gray mists rolling inland from
the river. The van came at last to a stretch where the shroud of
vapor was less dense, and the chauffeur gave vent to a grunt of
relief. Larson, the trusted official of the Bank of England, who
was seated by his side with a revolver bulging in his overcoat
pocket, frowned.</p>

<p>"This is the rottenest bit of road we've got to tackle, Jim,"
he reminded his companion. "Not a house for four miles and that
filthy canal within a few yards all the way. I wish this beastly
job was over. I never did care for it and I'm liking it less
every moment."</p>

<p>The driver nodded his head. "So do I, Mr. Larson, sir," he
mumbled. "That I do. Gawd!"</p>

<p>The sandy-haired little man gave a start which would have been
comical but for the fact that it was the start of death. He lay
crumpled over the wheel. His companion, though his movements
seemed swift enough, never reached the revolver toward which his
fingers were groping. The observation window behind had been
broken with a crash and he felt the cold, menacing pressure of
metal into his side.</p>

<p>"Take hold of that wheel and stop the car," a harsh voice
ordered. "Put your foot on the clutch. Lean over for the foot
brake. Keep the car on the road, I tell you, or you 11 get what
he got."</p>

<p>Larson had plenty of courage of the ordinary sort, but there
was another gun pressing into the small of his back by this time
and it was obvious that he was in a hopeless position. He leaned
over the limp body of the driver and brought the car almost to a
standstill, a great fear all the time chilling his blood and
setting his hand shaking. This was no ordinary holdup.</p>

<p>"You fellows from Amsterdam," he faltered, "you've got us
cold. What's it&mdash;mean?"</p>

<p>He fell over&mdash;dead&mdash;with a roar like the roar of a
cannon in his ears and the smell of gunpowder in his nostrils. A
man who had apparently been lurking in the shadows of the hedge
boarded the car, took the wheel and drew in to the side of the
road.</p>

<p>The door of the van slammed. From invisible places three or
four other figures stole into sight.</p>

<p>"Not a light for over a mile either way," one of them
declared.</p>

<p>"Get at these two," was the savage order from the man who
still stood with his revolver in his hand. "Strip them both and
fling them into the canal. We want their clothes-Buddy and I. The
rest of you can tramp it to where the car is waiting. We meet at
the Orchard Inn by Pender's Creek. Get me?"</p>

<p>There was a muttered assent. The speaker, who appeared to be
in charge of these amiable proceedings, was all the time throwing
off his coat and waistcoat. In a darkness which was almost
complete, with rapid breathing and clumsy fingers, the little
group of men went on with their grisly task. Ten minutes had
barely passed before the car was once more on its way. Even the
stains of blood, which were scanty, were wiped from the seat. The
man who had boarded the car drove with one hand and held the
flask which he had found in the leather pocket of the door to his
lips.</p>

<p>"Not too much of that," a voice from behind snarled. "You can
swim in it when we're through with this job we've got on
hand."</p>

<p>An arm stretched through the aperture leading to the back of
the car. The flask went spinning over the hedge into the darkness
and fell in the muddy waters of the canal. After that, except for
the roar of the engine as it picked up speed, there was
silence.</p>

<p><br>
AS was usually the case, Clara von Linz was the first person
to leave Victoria Station that night. Her luxuriously appointed
car was waiting at exactly the right place and her chauffeur was
already holding the door open as she crossed the platform,
followed by a porter carrying her single dressing case. She
dismissed the latter with a more than adequate recompense, spoke
a word of greeting to the chauffeur and took her place in the
car.</p>

<p>"Straight to Merton Street," she directed.</p>

<p>The man saluted and drove off. In less than a quarter of an
hour Clara was seated in one of the smallest but most comfortable
women's dens in the West End of London.</p>

<p>"Ring for Mrs. Horder," she told the grave-faced manservant
who was waiting for orders.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Horder has been inquiring for you, madam," the man
remarked.</p>

<p>A moment or two later the thick curtains at the far end of the
room were pushed aside, an unseen door traveled over its
beautifully adjusted foundations and a woman entered. She was
apparently of middle age and heavily built. Her hair, dress and
everything about her were severe. She bent over Clara, who
saluted her in Continental fashion.</p>

<p>"Sit down for a moment, Gertrude," she invited.</p>

<p><br>
THE woman obeyed. She possessed an air of great composure and
also of singular reticence. The eyes behind her glasses were
invisible, her features were curiously unemotional.</p>

<p>"There have been urgent messages for me?" the returned
traveler asked.</p>

<p>"Only social ones."</p>

<p>"There will be soon," Clara prophesied. "Perhaps not just yet.
They generally wait until after Scotland Yard has failed before
they come to us."</p>

<p>"Something has happened?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. I believe that there has been a big
robbery."</p>

<p>"Of jewels?"</p>

<p>"No. Of gold. Quite an original theft, my dear Gertrude. I was
in at the birth and I expect to be in at the death."</p>

<p>"How do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> nothing," was the smiling reply. "I divine.
That is all. I just guess. I feel it in the air. All that I have
to go by is that I saw a great many wooden boxes on the platform
at Dover Station, and because I saw them there I believe that
there has been a great gold robbery."</p>

<p>"You are usually right," the woman with the heavy glasses
conceded. "In this case, however, I think you go too far. A
robbery of gold is almost impossible."</p>

<p>"Listen!" Clara enjoined, holding up her ringer.</p>

<p>A boy tramped along the pavement below. They heard his nasal
singsong through the closely curtained windows.</p>

<p>"Great robbery of gold this afternoon! All about the great
robbery!"</p>

<p>"You heard something about it on the journey," Gertrude Horder
suggested incredulously.</p>

<p>"Not a thing, Gertrude, nothing," the other assured her.</p>

<p>The servant brought in a paper. There it was in black type
with gigantic headlines:</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">GREATEST ROBBERY IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY</p>

<p class="headline">OVER A MILLION POUNDS' WORTH OF GOLD<br>
CONSIGNED TO THE BANK OF ENGLAND MISSING</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">Neither Scotland Yard nor the Bank of England are willing to
give any information as to the reported theft of thirty-nine
boxes of gold bars which should by this time have been reposing
in the cellars of the Bank of England. They were handed over by
the French authorities and signed for at Dover Pier, and it is
understood that by means of forged orders they have fallen into
the hands of a gang of international thieves. The Thames from
Gravesend and all southern ports are under the strictest
surveillance, but in the absence of any confirmation we hesitate
to give credence to the many wild rumours in circulation. It may
be pointed out that the theft of gold in this form is an
exceedingly hazardous enterprise, as the markets for its disposal
are strictly limited.</p>
<br>

<p>"Did this inspiration of yours," Gertrude Horder asked,
"include any light upon how and where the theft took place and by
whom?"</p>

<p>"There are limits to my powers," Clara confessed. "The theft
took place, without a doubt, on Dover Town Station platform, but
there is nothing in that because I saw the boxes there. How or by
whom I have no idea at present. There was one little thing that
struck me," she went on thoughtfully, "which might be helpful,
but in any case I shall keep it to myself for the moment."</p>

<p>Gertrude Horder looked at her friend with an almost dazed
admiration in her expressionless eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish all those stupid people who lose things would send to
us earlier," she sighed. "We only get the business passed on to
us when Scotland Yard has bungled all the clues and mucked up
things hopelessly."</p>

<p>Clara shook her head. "You ought to know by this time, my
dear, that clues are no use to me," she said. "The best moment to
solve a mystery is when the people concerned in it have begun to
fancy themselves safe... Let us leave the gold robbery alone for
the moment. Aren't I going to some sort of dinner tonight?"</p>

<p>The older woman drew a small diary from her pocket and turned
over its images.</p>

<p>"You are dining at nine o'clock with the Duchess of Porchester
at Porchester House," she reported. "It is a charity invitation
affair, but the duchess has sent you a ticket. She rang up this
afternoon to ask if you had any choice of tables."</p>

<p>Clara shrugged her shoulders. "I shall bore myself at any,"
she answered. "I meant to wire from Paris that I could not go.
Something stopped me - another idea, perhaps. Why does one give
in to ideas, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"I never have any," was the terse response. "In view of this
latest sensation, would you like to sit at Sir Guy Blondel's
table? He is either a banker or something like it."</p>

<p>Clara's eyes were almost caressing. "You wonderful person!"
she exclaimed. "Do not dare to say you have no inspirations. You
must have felt that I want to know a little more about banking.
Sooner or later I suppose I shall have to find those gold bars,
and there are just one or two points I should like to
understand... Anything else happened?"</p>

<p>"Baron Konstam called. He was anxious to know whether you
would take a trip to Warsaw. There is a group of Frenchmen there
concerning whose activities he is curious."</p>

<p>"The affair does not interest me," Clara said, "and the
baron's last check barely paid expenses."</p>

<p>"He is becoming a trifle more generous, perhaps." Gertrude
Horder commented grimly. "Someone or other&mdash;his embassy
probably is intensely curious to discover your identity. He
hinted that if I were really only a lay figure here he would give
a very large sum of money to know who my principal was&mdash;what
the power working behind me could be, as he put it. He has never
got over his astonishment at your having been able to produce a
copy of the German proposals with regard to the Dantzic
affair."</p>

<p>Clara von Linz smiled. "I find Konstam a stupid man," she
pronounced. "He has no vision. He knows no more of the art of
espionage than a baby."</p>

<p>"He was high up in the German secret service during the war,"
her companion reflected.</p>

<p>"And Germany lost the war."</p>

<p>"Lord Ragley rang up once or twice. I think he wanted you to
dine with him."</p>

<p>"As though I would advertise myself in that way! Be a dear.
Gertrude, and go and see Ellida for me. I want my bath in half an
hour, the three Doucet gowns laid out to choose from, and the car
ordered for a quarter to nine. I have a fit of inertia. I wish to
do nothing for myself&mdash; nothing except think."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Wooden boxes."</p>

<p><br>
EXCEPT that the company was more brilliant than usual, the
Porchester House charity dinner and dance differed very little
from most functions of its sort. Clara enjoyed herself extremely.
She had chosen to wear a gown of dark violet color which seemed
to bring out marvelous lights from her uncannily beautiful eyes,
and she was easily the most admired woman in the room. The
Duchess of Porchester, who was nominally hostess, looked across
the floor with a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," she complained, "why Clara should have
chosen a place at Guy Blondel's table. Sir Guy is all very well
in his way, of course, but he cannot be a successful banker and
remain a human being."</p>

<p>"Clara always has a purpose in everything she does," another
woman remarked. "Guy Blondel may have some secret attraction that
none of us others have ever been able to discover. In any case
bankers arc the fashion this season."</p>

<p>"Blondel isn't exactly a banker, is he?" someone else pointed
out. "He buys and sells specie mostly silver. Deals in the real
stud, you know. Not in notes and oblong strips of paper. Sits in
his office with a million pounds' worth of gold ingots in the
cellar underneath him!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow," the duchess observed, "Clara seems to have succeeded
in making him talk. Perhaps we may get another check out of him
later on?"</p>

<p><br>
CLARA had certainly succeeded in making Guy Blondel talk. He
was a small pink-and-white man, the quintessence of neatness and
correctness in his attire, speech and general deportment.
Tonight, however, he seemed to be letting himself go. With the
air of a man upon whom the gods have showered their gifts, he
leaned toward his neighbor with unmistakable
<i>empressement</i>.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, baroness," he admitted. "There is a
great deal of romance attached to a business such as ours. We are
merchants, it is true, but we are operating behind the barterer
in mere commodities. We are dealing in the sinews of the world
with what makes commerce possible, in fact."</p>

<p>"You express so well what I was trying to say myself," Clara
murmured. "By the bye," she added, after a moment's pause, "is it
true that there has been a great robbery of gold this afternoon?
I never read the evening paper."</p>

<p><br>
BLONDEL'S expression changed. There was a more serious light
in his eyes, although his tone was casual enough.</p>

<p>"There is a report of something of the sort," he acknowledged
thoughtfully. "Personally I am inclined to think that it must be
greatly exaggerated. There has not been a successful theft of
gold in transit during my recollection."</p>

<p>A man opposite leaned across the table. "I believe there has
been a robbery," he intervened, "and quite a serious one. A
shipment from France to England which seems to have been stolen
from under the very noses of the custodians. You are not
interested, I hope, Blondel?"</p>

<p>The banker nodded in a superior fashion. "We are not buyers of
gold at present," he confided. "We would rather sell if there was
anything doing. And I would fill your house with silver. Lord
Ragley, if you would give me my price! The gold was consigned to
the Bank of England."</p>

<p>"Do tell us some more about it," Clara begged. "I thought gold
bars were such heavy, clumsy things."</p>

<p>She shut up her vanity case with a click and smiled invitingly
at her neighbor. He shivered with delight.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew more, baroness," he said. "It seems the gold
was landed and handed over to messengers from the Bank of
England. That lets the senders out, of course. The boxes were
packed in the special van of the boat train and then, to
everyone's surprise, the train stopped at Dover Town Station and
the boxes were all unloaded. What became of them from that moment
no one can even guess. Presumably they were handed over to
someone else, but to whom and in what manner not a soul seems to
know."</p>

<p><br>
"I WAS on the train," Clara sighed. "I wish I had known about
it. I am so good at spotting thieves, and there were a strange-
looking lot of men on the platform. You seem to know everything,
Sir Guy. Can you tell me this? Why with a train of quite ordinary
length and having got rid of our gold&mdash;did we travel to
London from Ashford at half speed?"</p>

<p>"Did you?" Blondel queried.</p>

<p>The violet eyes were studying him with a great deal more than
any ordinary inquisitiveness. She laughed softly.</p>

<p>"You arc beginning to alarm me, Sir Guy," she exclaimed. "I
believe you know everything, although you are so reticent. Please
tell why we traveled so slowly."</p>

<p>The banker opened his lips reluctantly. Suddenly he closed
them again. He raised his glass and drained its contents.</p>

<p>"Baroness," he assured her, "there is a limit to the scraps of
information which have come my way. I cannot imagine any possible
reason why the gold should have been changed or why you should
have traveled to London at anything less than the usual speed.
Tomorrow I expect the whole story will be told."</p>

<p>Lord Ragley, who was the duchess' second son, rose from the
table as the newly arrived orchestra started its dance music. He
bowed across to Clara.</p>

<p>"Will you honor me, baroness?"</p>

<p>Clara assented with a smile, but quitted her seat with
reluctance.</p>

<p><br>
CLARA VON LINZ, although she gave no indication of the fact,
was more than a little bored by the ceaseless round of parties of
every description offered to her as soon as her presence in
London became known. The days of a too inquisitive social regime
had passed with the war, and although everyone felt that there
was something unusual about this beautiful Austrian, it only
seemed to make her the more sought after. Her family, at any
rate, was well known.</p>

<p>She had never been connected with any scandal. All that could
be said against her was that there was a certain amount of
mystery about the way she spent her time flitting from one part
of Europe to another, and her control of what seemed to be
illimitable wealth. She was almost always the best dressed woman
in any assembly. Her jewels were famous. Her advice was asked by
the priestesses of fashion. She was a great linguist. And her
love affairs, if she had any, were conducted with the most
remarkable discretion.</p>

<p>It was well known that she had been in the Austrian secret
service during the war, but of her activities in those days she
never spoke. There were times, however, when even her most
intimate friends were conscious of a certain aloofness which
puzzled them. It was as if she still had interests far more
engrossing than the pursuits of the world in which she lived.</p>

<p><br>
FOR the next week she was a flying visitor at many parties, a
week-end guest at several great houses, nearly always being the
latest arrival and the first to leave. She was prominent at two
famous first nights. She attended the first Court of the season
with the wife of the Austrian ambassador. She remained in the
place which she had occupied during the last few years&mdash;a
very distinguished and desirable member of the inner set. No one
but she herself knew that she was bored.</p>

<p>Then one morning it came to an end. The bell of the private
telephone which stood on the table by the easy-chair in her
library tinkled. She took down the receiver, glanced at the
calendar, murmured an incomprehensible word. The reply was of the
same order, but Clara was satisfied. She had no liking for
mystery for mystery's sake, but when that particular telephone
rang and it was connected only with the office of "Sibyl," a code
word and its rejoinder flashed backward and forward decided the
genuineness of the summons.</p>

<p>"A Colonel Grainger," Gertrude Horder's voice announced, "is
coming at eleven o'clock to consult the firm. He rang up from his
private house and he does not wish any communication to be
addressed to him officially or his mission here spoken of to
anyone."</p>

<p>CLARA's laugh rippled like music along the wire. "Poor man!"
she exclaimed. "I can guess who has sent him. Very well,
Gertrude. I shall be in my place. Just test the instruments and
see that the new microphone in your room is in order. At a
quarter to eleven I will give you a short list of the vital
points. And Gertrude it is not that our banking account is
particularly low, but a time might come when we need
money&mdash;Sibyl will expect a thousand guineas for a week's
work, and twenty thousand pounds for the return of the gold."</p>

<p>"I shall blush when I suggest that," Gertrude declared.</p>

<p>"It will be for the first time in your life, then," her chief
replied.</p>

<p>Colonel Grainger, D. S. O., deputy sub-commissioner of
Scotland Yard, was fairly true to type. His appearance was a
trifle too military for the profession into which he had recently
drifted, but he had the keen blue eyes and firm lips of a man of
insight and determination. He was perhaps just a little ruffled
this morning, for, although Scotland Yard had had earlier
relations with the firm he had come to visit, they had not been
of his choosing.</p>

<p>"Can I speak to your principal?" he asked, after he had been
ushered into Gertrude Horder's office.</p>

<p>She motioned him to a chair. "I am sorry," she said. "I
thought you knew the way in which our business is conducted.
Everything has to pass through me."</p>

<p>"But surely," he protested, "the representative of Scotland
Yard, as I suppose you know me to be, is entitled to consult with
the principal of your -shall we say? - intelligence office,
however successful and famous you may have become."</p>

<p>"YOUR visit, Colonel Grainger, is of course a great
compliment," Gertrude replied. "We acknowledge that freely. Our
rules, however, are immutable. Our principal has an exact, even a
word-by-word, report of everything that takes place, but keeps
aloof."</p>

<p>"H'm," Colonel Grainger grunted. "It saves prejudice, at any
rate. Well, I have come to consult you at the urgent request of
the directorate of the Bank of England concerning the theft of
those gold bars you may have heard about."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," the representative of the oracle begged,
"how far your investigations have gone?"</p>

<p>"I will give you a brief resume of the case," was the somewhat
grudging reply. "You can ask any questions you like. We received
due notice from the Bank of England that the gold was coming over
on the usual boat, The Maid of Kent, and was to be transferred to
the boat train in the customary fashion. We sent an adequate
number of men to cover the landing and stow the boxes in the
special van. The stowing away was on the point of being
completed, when the Bank of England representative&mdash;who, I
understand, is a man absolutely above suspicion received a
message written on Bank of England note paper, brought by a Bank
of England messenger and written partly in the code used when any
matter of the transport of gold is concerned."</p>

<p>"You kept the order, of course?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," was the slightly contemptuous reply. "This poor
fellow Larson read it and never for a moment doubted its
genuineness. He had the gold transported to Dover Town Station,
where it was unloaded and repacked in a Scotland Yard armored car
of the latest design&mdash;which again, with its chauffeur, had
been obtained from the Yard on a forged order signed in my name.
The chauffeur was one of our regular and most reliable servants.
With him, of course, were Larson and a guard of two men supposed
to have been sent from the country to which the gold was to be
re-shipped."</p>

<p>"Larson started off with the gold, then?" Gertrude
inquired.</p>

<p>"It is Larson's duty not to leave the boxes after he has
signed for them until they are in the vaults of the bank to which
they are consigned or handed over to some recognized
authority."</p>

<p>"That means four men in the car?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Colonel Grainger agreed. "They started off and
Larson's new orders instructed him to proceed direct to a port on
the river where a vessel was waiting to transport the gold across
the North Sea. You probably do not know Kent intimately, but the
bodies of Larson and the chauffeur, stripped of a portion of
their clothing, were found in a canal along one of the loneliest
stretches of road in Kent. Both had been shot and had been dead
many hours. The armored car was found in a deserted lane not many
miles farther on."</p>

<p>And the gold?</p>

<p>"The gold had disappeared."</p>

<p>Gertrude leaned back in her chair.</p>

<p>"Your story," she remarked, "is even stranger than the
newspaper versions."</p>

<p>"The truth," her visitor replied," is usually stranger than
fiction."</p>

<p>The telephone at Gertrude Horder's side rang. She took off the
receiver, listened, and hung up in silence.</p>

<p>"There are perhaps some questions you would like to ask,"
Colonel Grainger inquired stiffly.</p>

<p>"I would like to know the precise spot where the police car
was discovered."</p>

<p>The colonel drew a road map from his pocket. "I have prepared
this for you. You will find the spot marked near which the bodies
of Larson and the chauffeur were found, and farther on the place
where the car was discovered abandoned at the bottom of a
quarry."</p>

<p>"Why did the boat train proceed to London at half speed?"</p>

<p>Colonel Grainger raised his eyebrows in surprise. "I scarcely
see where that comes in," he remarked. "Still, since you have
asked the question I will answer it The railway authorities were
informed through a private source that bombs had been placed upon
the line at various points between Ashford and London. Seems as
though the first idea had been to wreck the train and steal the
gold. The train was fitted with the same guards on the engine
which we used in the war. Hence the slow progress. Now you have
heard all I have to say. Miss...."</p>

<p>The colonel hesitated, but Gertrude did not disclose
herself.</p>

<p>"Names," she confided, "are not used in this establishment.
This is Sibyl. I am a part of Sibyl. I am the part which connects
the client with the brains that direct it. That is
sufficient."</p>

<p>"You certainly conduct your business on original lines," was
the caustic rejoinder. "May I ask whether you think that 'the
brains' will be able to elucidate this affair?"</p>

<p>"We have never yet failed in a case," Gertrude reflected,
leaning back in her chair, "and I see nothing in the present one
to give us the least concern."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" her client exclaimed incredulously,</p>

<p>"I am requested to tell you," Gertrude continued, "that our
fee for a week's investigations will be a thousand guineas, and
if we return you the gold or give you information as to where it
is, we shall require a fee of twenty thousand pounds. As the
value of the bars is at least a million and a half pounds you
will not, I imagine, consider this excessive."</p>

<p>"The bank will pay the sum you suggest, of course, provided
you are successful," he assured her. "That is a matter of minor
importance."</p>

<p>Colonel Grainger picked up his hat and stick and looked around
the apartment. It lacked nothing in the way of comfort, but its
only connection with any possible business activities seemed to
be the multiplicity of telephones in every conceivable place and
a strangely paneled wall with inlays of fretted ivory within a
few yards of where Gertrude was seated. It was a room of no
definite form, yet a room which suggested mystery. The departing
visitor, convinced that it was the abode of a charlatan, wished
Gertrude a not-too-gracious good morning and took his leave.</p>

<p><br>
CLARA, contrary to her custom, was lunching a few days later
with the little pink-and-white man. They were seated in a corner
of the Ritz grill.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know," she said to her companion, "that you are
spoiling me shamefully. You are quite one of the most generous of
my admirers in London."</p>

<p>He was so much in earnest that his words were almost pathetic.
"I wish that you liked London well enough to...."</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"To live in."</p>

<p>"But, my dear man," she protested, "you yourself must care for
other places too. You have traveled, you are not hopelessly
British. In fact, you are not British at all, are you?"</p>

<p>"By naturalization, yes."</p>

<p>"At any rate you have not the prejudices. I wander through
Florence, where I have a little flat which I call home. It is a
city of beauty. All the time there are things which pull at my
heartstrings to be seen and loved. And I walk, or I drive, or I
fly over London, and what on earth do I see? A few beautiful
buildings wrapped in mist&mdash;cold gray mist, unsympathetic,
colorless, depressing nothing beautiful. And I say to myself, 'It
is time I left this place.' The rivers of the world! Think of
some of the beautiful ones, Sir Guy! Look at the Thames.
Yesterday afternoon, to please a friend, I flew up the Thames. I
ask you to remember it for the last five miles, say, before you
come to London Bridge. Those hideous factories belching out smoke
and smells. Why, there were some works on what seemed to be a
flat mud island with curls of black smoke crawling up to the sky
and disfiguring the landscape as far as you could see."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts was that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" she answered. "Or stop! I think they
called it Mud Pie Island. There seemed to be no one at work in
the factory, and yet we felt the heat from the furnaces hundreds
of feet up. Oh, it is all so ugly."</p>

<p><br>
THE little pink-and-white man was suddenly serious. His eyes
seemed to be boring into his companion's. He had the air of one
assailed by disturbing thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why do you mention that place particularly?" he asked with an
unaccustomed harshness in his tone.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. Her attention had wandered to the
next dish which she was offered by the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," she begged. "This sole Colbert looked so
marvelous. You are asking why I mentioned that place
particularly. I think it was because of the hugeness of the
factory chimney, the emptiness of the whole place, the stark
ugliness of it&mdash;and also because my pilot told me that it
must have been somewhere within about a mile of there that the
gang who stole the gold bars from the Bank of England reached the
river."</p>

<p>Sir Guy frowned. "How could he or anyone else know that they
really did reach the river?" he queried dolefully. "Scotland Yard
cannot tell me. No one can tell me. I was keeping the secret to
myself, but I was a customer for that gold and I have had to see
a profit disappear."</p>

<p>"It may be recovered."</p>

<p>"Little chance."</p>

<p>"Tell me, what could they do with it?" she asked. "Supposing
the gang who murdered the two custodians and got away with it
reached the river. Supposing then they had had motorboats to meet
them&mdash;what could they do with the gold? There could be no
market for it with the government stamp there. To have even
offered it would have given the whole show away."</p>

<p><br>
HE looked at her intently, and if ever she had been inclined
to think him the slightest degree of a fool she changed her mind.
This man had cunning even if he lacked brain.</p>

<p>"Why are you so interested in the matter of these missing gold
bars, baroness?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," she confessed. "Perhaps because I never
heard of gold bars before and I had no idea that all the
governments kept them locked up in their strong-rooms. Secondly,
because I cannot imagine what use they are unless to make coins
out of them. Could I, for instance, go into Cartier's with a gold
bar under my arm and buy a diamond bracelet?"</p>

<p>"The necessity for buying a diamond bracelet for yourself
should never arise," he said, with a faint meaning underneath his
words. "But if it did&mdash;supposing you took a gold bar under
your arm and Cartier's weighed and tested it, without a doubt
they would accept it as payment for your diamond bracelet."</p>

<p>"Supposing you had bought those from the government," she
persisted; "what should you have done with them?"</p>

<p>"I should have sold them at a very considerable profit to a
firm upon the Continent," he answered. "The business was already
arranged. What does it matter? There are other days and larger
profits. Large enough," he went on, with another of those
sidelong glances which set fear shivering even in a person of
Clara's nerve, "to pay for that bracelet at Cartier's!"</p>

<p>She sat in silence for a minute or two. Then she asked him an
abrupt question:</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in Russia?"</p>

<p>"Many times," he answered. "I myself am half Russian. My
mother was a Lett. My father was English enough, of course, as
was my grandfather, the founder of our firm."</p>

<p>"Do you do any business there?"</p>

<p>"Everyone does, more or less secretly. No one can afford to
run the risk of offending what may some day become a very great
country."</p>

<p>"At present," she remarked, "their methods strike one as a
little crude."</p>

<p><br>
HE smiled. "You would think so if you had to do with them.
Luftstein, their agent, who is over here now &mdash;&mdash; All
the time," he broke off impatiently, "we talk of such unpleasant
subjects! Baroness. I have been wondering whether I dared ask you
to honor my little bachelor abode by dining there with me
tonight. We might take a stroll up Bond Street and I will show
you the way."</p>


<p>"We might look in at the windows of Cartier's!" she suggested,
her elbows upon the table supporting her oval face while she
looked across at him.</p>

<p>"It would give me great pleasure."</p>

<p>She looked at him long and curiously, and the longer she
looked the more poignant grew a certain queer sensation of
uneasiness in the pink-and-white man. Women, as a rule, even the
most beautiful women, even women of Clara's position, had been so
quick to respond to the little hints he had thrown out. Suddenly
he had the idea that she had been playing with him. Why? He
wondered. She was the famous Baroness von Linz, the great
aristocrat, with the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to many courts through her own family
and the exalted personages who were her friends. Yet in these
days nobody was safe.</p>

<p>"I must be going," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>He signed his bill and walked with her toward the door. "But
I'll see you this afternoon -this evening?" he whispered softly
as they stood on the pavement.</p>

<p>"These tiresome dressmakers," she murmured, stepping into the
taxi which the <i>commissionaire</i> had called.</p>

<p><br>
SIR GUY BLONDEL was bowed obsequiously into his own waiting
automobile, but for several moments he lingered on the curbstone.
His eyes were following that disappearing taxi. A beautiful
woman. A fascinating woman. And yet he had always felt something
which amounted almost to fear of any personal element in life
which he failed to understand. He leaned back in the corner of
his very luxurious car, muttered the address to his chauffeur
through the tube and became once more, as he drove through the
crowded streets, the little pink-and-white millionaire of
Mayfair, a man without a care, the head of an old-established and
famous banking house.</p>

<p>His thoughts traveled back through the last few years. They
traveled forward through the years to come. The present he let
alone, for it was the present he feared. He had never meant these
wild connections of his to take such risks. He had never meant to
have become so closely involved with them.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand pounds was a very nice sum to handle; it
had been even necessary money; but he hated risks. He liked to do
his business and multiply his capital across his rosewood desk,
smiling, but with the cunning of a fox all the time. He
understood bargaining, he understood the clever byways of his own
business.</p>

<p>He had never been in deep waters before, as he was now. It
seemed almost allegorical to him as he passed through the stately
thoroughfares of the city into the slums, to the half-empty
streets of Dockland, until at last he reached his
destination.</p>

<p>A great gate was rolled open, the car moved slowly onto a
heavy ferry. There as a moment's delay. He let down the window
and looked ahead at the huge, silent factory upon that stretch of
land which at high tide was little more than a swamp. From a
hundred windows there came scarcely a light, but from the annex,
from the great round furnace and the high chimney close at hand,
a glimpse of flames leaping through the darkness, great billowy
clouds of smoke darker even than the darkness itself.</p>

<p>They moved slowly forward through the black, muddy water. Now
he could hear the roar of the flames, the throb of the great
generator. A stupid game, this, to have been mixed up in.</p>

<p>He stepped out onto the pier. Almost immediately he was
confronted by a couple of watchers, men with dour faces and of
threatening aspect. They recognized him, however, and waved him
on. He hurried up the short avenue. The doorkeeper looked at him
suspiciously, but passed him into a huge, dirty hall. From there
he was admitted into a large, untidy office. There were no blinds
upon the windows and only one green-shaded lamp in the way of
illumination.</p>

<p><br>
A MAN swung round in his chair, a man as alien to his
surroundings as Blondel himself. He was elegantly dressed, he
smelled of perfume, his long, pale face was lined and
anxious.</p>

<p>"What on earth do you want down here, Blondel?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The banker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"How are things going?"</p>

<p>"Can't you hear the roar of the dynamos? We are ahead of time.
By the day after tomorrow we shall be on our way to the
Baltic."</p>

<p>"I wish that you were off tonight."</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>Blondel shook his head. "Nothing definite. You have read all
the papers, of course. We faded out of the news today. I always
think it is a bad sign when the police leave off talking. Nothing
happened down here?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>

<p>"Anyone called?"</p>

<p>"Only oil salesmen and mechanics and people on business. No
one is allowed inside the building. No one can possibly make a
guess at what we are really doing."</p>

<p>"You think," Blondel asked anxiously, "that you will carry
this through?"</p>

<p>His companion laughed harshly. "Too late to have fears, my
friend," he said. "We shall carry it through. You shall have your
hundred thousand pounds at the end of the week or we shall vanish
off the face of the earth. I myself have no wish to vanish off
the face of the earth, and what I wish generally happens. Don't
be a fool, Blondel. How would you like to have to sit down here
morning and night, never sleeping, never eating a decent meal or
seeing a pretty woman&mdash;doing nothing except listening and
watching and goading on these few mechanics? Take my advice.
Don't come near here again. I will send you a wireless in code
the moment we are in the North Sea."</p>

<p><br>
BLONDEL felt his confidence returning. The man with whom he
talked was famous, and he had never known failure. It was his
scheme, this, and there were only forty-eight hours more of
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Very well, Nicholas," he agreed. "I will be off and keep
away. It is best."</p>

<p>"I shall be at the Ritz in Paris the first week in June," the
other promised. "See you then."</p>

<p><br>
COLONEL GRAINGER shook hands with the representative of Sibyl
and accepted her invitation to be seated.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked, "the week is up."</p>

<p>"We seem to have timed it exactly," Gertrude replied. "I was
just going to ring you up."</p>

<p>"You have news?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Certainly. The gold is at a riverside smelting works on a
strip of waste land called Mud Pie Island. I have prepared a plan
showing you the locality and how to get there."</p>

<p>She pushed a folded sheet of paper across the table. Her
visitor picked it up and stared at it incredulously.</p>

<p>"You will find at least twenty or thirty men to deal with,"
Gertrude continued; "and a fairly desperate crowd, I should
imagine. The principal was on Dover Town Station platform when
the gold was unshipped. He passed himself off as the
representative of the foreign bank and it was he, no doubt, who
committed the murders. The rest of the gang were probably picked
up along the road."</p>

<p><br>
"LOOK here," the sub-commissioner said, recovering his calm
with a great effort, "are you talking seriously?"</p>

<p>"Why ask me such a foolish question?" she protested. "Remember
that, although as a matter of fact I am a very insignificant
person, I am in this matter the representative of Sibyl. We have
never failed. We never shall fail. We have found your gold. We
expect your payment. In ten minutes you had better be on your way
to Scotland Yard making your plans. Before you $>o I will put you
in possession of a few more facts. These works have an enormous
furnace and they were hired by foreigners some months ago,
evidently for this exact purpose. The motorboats that were
dashing up and down the river and the empty boxes that were found
by your police were only meant to put you off. The gold was
stored away in the works before daylight the morning after the
robbery."</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The bars have been through the furnace," she answered, "or
most of them. They could not have been taken anyway with their
stamps on. I don't suppose they are materially changed, except in
shape. There is a steamer lying about a hundred yards
off&mdash;looks like an old tub but in reality has very fine
engines. The gang arc expecting to load her up with the gold
tomorrow night and she will be in the Baltic by the end of the
week."</p>

<p>Colonel Grainger pulled himself together. The woman spoke
convincingly.</p>

<p>"Who was at the top end of this?" he asked rapidly. "Remember,
there were the messengers from the Bank of England, there were
the code instructions&mdash;everything in order."</p>

<p><br>
"A MAN named Blondel&mdash;Sir Guy Blondel&mdash;was
responsible for that," she confided. "The gang who have the gold
are associates of his. He is a bullion broker or something of the
sort, and has often worked with the Bank of England in arranging
shipments."</p>

<p>"And he was dining at the Embassy last night!" Grainger
muttered.</p>

<p>"Our information leads us to believe," Gertrude Horder
concluded, "that the gold will not be given up without a fight.
You ought to take plenty of men, and if you want to avoid
bloodshed you should surround the place and rush it as soon as it
is dark. We shall expect a settlement from you during the
week."</p>

<p><br>
THE little pink-and-white man was in grievous straits. His tie
was awry, his hair ruffled. One side of the white slip of his
waistcoat had disappeared. He was walking up and down the large,
bleak office of the Mud Pie Island works with quick, uneven
footsteps. Lounging against the desk the young man,
Nicholas&mdash;calm and sleekly debonair&mdash;was watching him
with a half-contemptuous air.</p>

<p>"Nerves." Blondel repeated for the twentieth time, endeavoring
to reassure himself. "Nerves. That's what I am suffering from. Do
you think you can get the gold safely on board?"</p>

<p>"The last lot is in the cooling vat," Nicholas replied. "They
will pack it at midnight. We expect to be on board before
dawn."</p>

<p>"I wish you were there now," Blondel groaned. "It came on me
all of a sudden, this lit of nerves. I had to come here."</p>

<p>The two men stood before the high, dusty window. Fog had
blotted out the world, had deadened sound as well as sight. They
gazed out upon nothing.</p>

<p>"It's a loathsome hole, this," Nicholas exclaimed with a
shiver. "If you had been down here as I have been all these
nights urging them on, watching the furnaces, doing sentinel at
night and slave driver by day, you might talk about nerves!"</p>

<p>With a start so slight as to be scarcely noticeable, and
without a spoken word, he peered suddenly forward. A row of
strange orange flares had appeared on the other bank of the cut.
They were moving in line now. Nicholas, stooping down, with a
great effort threw open the window. Blondel went choking
backward. Nicholas ignored the fog which was drifting in. He was
listening. Suddenly the telephone sounded. He stretched out his
hand and took off the receiver.</p>

<p><br>
"HOW many?" he asked in response to some spoken words from the
other end. "Are you there, Paul? Blow up the ferry. You've got
the stuff on?"</p>

<p>Nicholas, too, it seemed, was sometimes subject to nerves. He
seized the telephone and dashed it on to the floor. His thumb was
pressed upon a bell in the wall.</p>

<p>"Curse you and your nerves, Blondel," he exclaimed. "Anyway,
you've got something to be nervous for now," he added, with a
fierce laugh. "Listen!"</p>

<p>They heard the ferryboat starting on its creaking and groaning
passage. The orange lights seemed somehow or other to be on
board. Down the passages of the works overhead and all around was
the sound of flying footsteps.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Blondel shrieked. "Tell me what it is, Nicholas.
What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Not much," the young man answered coolly. "There are forty
policemen on that ferry halfway across the cut by now, I should
think. We had a mine laid on the boat but they found it and cut
the wire. Look at the lights down either side. They are trying to
hem us in."</p>

<p>He started tearing off his coat and waistcoat.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Blondel cried.</p>

<p>"Swim across to my motorboat behind," was the quick answer.
"Are you coming?"</p>

<p>"I can't swim," Blondel sobbed. "Don't leave me here,
Nicholas."</p>

<p>The young man laughed. He was in his shirt and trousers now.
"A pretty sort of a fool I should be," he scoffed, "to stop and
keep you company! Here you can have this," he added, throwing a
revolver which he had drawn from his hip pocket on to the table.
"Much good may it do you."</p>

<p><br>
HE rushed from the room. Blondel would have followed him, but
his knees gave way. The sound of flying footsteps had ceased. The
silence of emptiness was upon the place. Blondel staggered to the
window. The fog was denser than ever in the room, and he felt
himself choking. The ferryboat was looming up, a great black
shape, barely fifty yards away. Already he could hear the
creaking of the chains. He took up the revolver, laid it down,
picked it up again with a sob. The fog drifted in. Somehow the
darkness made it easier.</p>

<p>The inspector-in-chief landed his men safely and sent them
swarming through the place. The gold was there, lying about in
all directions in the great shed near the furnace. There were
coats and hats lying about, too, but the only sign of any human
being was the little pink-and-white man, stone dead with a
revolver still grasped in his hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story2" name="story2">II. &mdash; AN OLYMPIAN
DEBACLE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE Right Honourable John Spencer St. Alban,
Prime Minister of England, drew his chair a little farther back
into the shadows of the room. His terrible visitor, who sat in
the full flood of the unexpected spring sunshine, only smiled.
Hulings, the perfect secretary, a dark silent figure, moved from
the background to the window and adjusted the blind.</p>

<p>"I must take a few minutes for reflection," St. Alban said
quietly. "Your attitude, Lord Reisborough, if you will pardon my
saying so, is a trifle incomprehensible."</p>

<p>The visitor made no remark. St. Alban, notwithstanding his
expressed desire for concrete reflection, found his thoughts
wandering. He found himself visualising the drama of this unequal
conflict. In his youth he had been a great reader of fiction. The
idea of a mortal conflict between two men hating one another to
the limit, each seeking for the other's extinction, had always
fascinated him. He imagined himself with some instrument of death
in his hand facing this man whose removal from existence seemed
to be the thing most to be desired upon earth. He hated the
sneering face, the coarse lips, the insolent though suppressed
air of triumph about his visitor. He hated his ungainly form, his
ill-chosen clothes, the purple tie, the over-creased, loud
patterned trousers. He felt a little twitch in the forefinger of
his right hand. Supposing the instrument of death had been there,
he pondered. It would be so easy to give the world a new shock!
No Prime Minister of a great country, that he could remember, had
ever stood in the dock of a Court of Justice charged with murder.
Hulings stepped lightly across the room and whispered in the ear
of his august chief. The latter shook his head slightly.
Nevertheless he turned towards his visitor.</p>

<p>"I presume," he said, "that there is nothing within my power
to offer which would influence your attitude?"</p>

<p>The thick mocking lips were slowly parted.</p>

<p>"What have you to offer beyond what I already possess?" was
the harsh response. "I am many times a millionaire. I am a peer
of your country. I already wear such decorations as are within my
reach. I gave you to understand upon our first interview that I
was not to be bribed."</p>

<p>"I find the word offensive," the Prime Minister pronounced.
"We seem to have said all that there is to be said. I see no
reason for prolonging this interview."</p>

<p>The visitor rose to his feet &mdash; a puny, maliciouslooking
man, morally and physically unattractive.</p>

<p>"I shall not change my mind," he declared, "however long I
stay here, whatever stale arguments you may trot out."</p>

<p>St. Alban waved him towards the door &mdash; a firm,
contemptuous gesture.</p>

<p>"Men of your type are usually obstinate," he observed.</p>

<p>"No more fireworks of eloquence for me," the departing visitor
sneered, as he waited for Hulings to open the door.</p>

<p>"I will spare you the full text of the ancient simile," was
the icy rejoinder. "I will keep my pearls and the swine may
go."</p>

<p>Hulings was back again in a very few minutes. For a young man
who had only been down from Oxford for two years he was a
singularly sympathetic and human person. He crossed the room
towards his chief with leaden footsteps. There was a look of
almost spaniel-like devotion in his brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Could I have done more, Charles?" the former asked him
thoughtfully. "Was there any argument I failed to use, any other
possible means of dealing with that venomous person?"</p>

<p>"None, sir," the young man assured him. "You and he do not
speak the same language. He has always been our enemy &mdash;
politically and personally."</p>

<p>"Give me the reports from the Home Secretary and the Chief
Commissioner," St. Alban enjoined.</p>

<p>The young man withdrew some papers from a clip upon the desk
and brought them over. St. Alban glanced them through carefully
and passed them back. They were concise, terse and final. In
other words &mdash; they were useless.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to be done, sir," Hulings said
slowly. "I wish to God I could have had the courage to do it as
he passed out into the street!" St. Alban smiled curiously. He
smiled, though, with dead lips and there was no answering light
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought of that, Hulings," he admitted. "Those were simple
days when one killed the lepers."</p>

<p>The young man summoned up all his courage.</p>

<p>"We have tried the Secret Service, sir," he pointed out, "the
home and the foreign branches. They can do nothing. The Chief
Commissioner has to admit himself baffled. If you would not think
me a howling lunatic I should like to make one more
suggestion."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I should like to be allowed to ask the advice of a lady who
conducts an international secret service agency here in
London."</p>

<p>St. Alban's amazement was blended with incredulity. He could
scarcely believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest, Charles?" he demanded. "Employ a secret
service agency upon such a matter!"</p>

<p>"It sounds like madness I know, sir," the young man confessed
deprecatingly. "Still, wonderful stories have been told about the
one I have in mind. They work in secret. With the exception of
one woman no one knows who the principals are. They are as silent
as the grave in their methods."</p>

<p>"How did you get to know so much about them, Charles?"</p>

<p>The young man flushed.</p>

<p>"I would not mention it to anyone except to you, sir," he
said, "but I happen to know from my cousin Guy Leighton &mdash;
he is second now at Rome &mdash; that the private letter on
various Irish questions addressed to the Pope which was lost was
recovered by them. A very fine piece of work they thought it over
there."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister nodded somewhat wearily. He had no wish to
damp the young man's enthusiasm, but the idea of an international
enquiry agency was like a bad taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>"You can go and see them if you think it worth while," he
conceded. "Make sure that they are thoroughly responsible,
though, and keep Downing Street out of it as much as you
can."</p>

<p>"I will be careful, sir," Hulings promised. "It is better than
sitting here waiting for the thunderbolts, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I do not like your friend, Lord Henry," Clara, Baroness Linz,
remarked to a youthful scion of the house of Dunworthy. "He is
not a nice man. Why did you present him?"</p>

<p>"Nasty bit of work, isn't he?" the young man acquiesced
cheerfully. "Had to introduce him, though. He came up and asked
me point blank."</p>

<p>"But such an appearance!" the Baroness complained. "Why should
one know such a person?"</p>

<p>Her companion chuckled.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why everyone knows him who can, my dear Clara,"
he replied. "Reisborough is a multimillionaire. He owns the Daily
Sun, three theatres, the favourite for the Darby and Reisborough
House. My old lady mother puts the case in a nutshell. She said
quite firmly the other day to my father &mdash; 'You cannot
afford to live in London and not know Reisborough.'"</p>

<p>The Baroness shrugged her shoulders, knocked out the remains
of a cigarette from her holder and with delicate and shapely
fingers fitted in a fresh one.</p>

<p>"We Austrians," she murmured, "were never like that."</p>

<p>"Seems to me when I was in Vienna," Lord Henry reflected,
"that I remember a few Hebrew bankers who kept open house."</p>

<p>"One was not forced to go there."</p>

<p>"Of course it is all a rotten shame, but since the war what
can you do? We are all up a tree. The Reisboroughs of the world
have got us in the palms of their hands. I admit, though, this
man does give me the shivers."</p>

<p>"I really do not see why I should be made to suffer," Clara
Linz sighed. "You have imposed upon me the necessity of refusing
to continue an acquaintance. It is not a thing which I often do
but I certainly shall not remember Lord Reisborough the next time
we meet."</p>

<p>"You may change your mind," Lord Henry grinned. "A man who
gives sapphire bracelets for dinner favours keeps his
friends."</p>

<p>It came about that Clara Linz did change her mind but it was
not for the sake of a sapphire bracelet! The young lady who
controlled the destinies of Advice Limited was impressing enough
in her personality, her pleasant but strong face, the severe
elegance of her attire, the clean crispness of her sentences, but
she was nevertheless a disappointment to the young man, seated a
few yards away, whose card reposed upon her table.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to make myself clearly understood, perhaps,
Baroness," he said, "but I am representing very powerful
influences."</p>

<p>"Which you are not at liberty to name," she reminded him
drily.</p>

<p>"Surely in your profession that is not unusual," was the
smooth reply. "You have there my name&mdash; Charles Hulings
&mdash; and if you doubt my word I can easily produce proof that
I am, as I say, private secretary to a Cabinet Minister. I think,
under the circumstances therefore, I am entitled to certain
reticences."</p>

<p>"Without a doubt you are," Clara assented. "There has never
been any question about that. The fact remains, however, that I
never attempt to give advice unless I know every detail of the
matter under consideration. You may be sure that every word you
say will be confidentially and carefully treated, and if I am not
able to give you a direct reply immediately as to my views upon
your case you will receive it within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>The young man continued dubious.</p>

<p>"It is a curious situation," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"We are curious people," she assured him.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a few moments and then took the plunge.</p>

<p>"A certain personage whom I shall not name," he began, "but
who is a member of the government, decided some short time ago
upon a particular course of policy with regard to an important
foreign power. He drew up a draft treaty signed provisionally by
himself and by the ambassador of the country concerned. This
treaty involved the country in definite obligations under certain
conditions. Is this clear?"</p>

<p>"It sounds," Clara replied, "like a Chinese puzzle, but I
think I know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Will you please take this for granted?" the young man went
on. "It is vital to British interests that no word of this
proposed agreement should become known to the general public,
both for reasons of general policy &mdash; which abhors secret
treaties &mdash; and on account of the minister who is
responsible for it. By some means or other, although every
precaution was taken, a copy of the draft has been secured by the
owner of a great newspaper. He is proposing to publish that copy
in his morning issue next Friday and to give the names of the
small section of the Cabinet who have sponsored it. The result of
the publication would be, without a doubt, to bring the present
government to an end."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. With a word of apology Clara Linz
lit a cigarette and pushed the box towards her visitor. For a
moment or two afterwards she seemed wrapped in meditation.</p>

<p>"The press and the government of the country," she pointed
out, "are generally on excellent terms. Surely pressure can be
brought to bear upon the editor of this newspaper."</p>

<p>"It is not the editor but the owner &mdash; a man of
considerable importance &mdash; who has the draft of the
arrangement," Hulings confided. "He has already been approached.
His attitude towards the government is inimical and towards the
minister chiefly responsible one of hatred. There is no possible
bribe or inducement which can be offered which has not been
suggested. The result is less than nil. Unless a miracle happens
or you perform something more than a miracle the bombshell will
be exploded next Friday and the present government will come
automatically to an end."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hulings," Clara said deliberately, "you have come to us
for help and it would be a triumph if we were able to give it to
you. We cannot move in the matter, however, unless you treat us
with more complete confidence."</p>

<p>He looked at her miserably.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he pleaded, "how is that possible?"</p>

<p>"It is for you to decide," she answered.</p>

<p>He sat for a few moments in dreary silence. At last he
yielded.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "I ask for no promises, I make no
threats, but naturally if you betray my confidence your bureau is
not likely to exist very much longer. The person whose reputation
as a statesman is in danger is the Prime Minister, John Spencer
St. Alban. The country involved is Japan."</p>

<p>"And the newspaper proprietor?" she asked mercilessly.</p>

<p>"Lord Reisborough."</p>

<p>"Upon what date does he propose to draw down the
thunders?"</p>

<p>"Friday the twentieth."</p>

<p>She glanced at the almanack upon her desk.</p>

<p>"It is now Tuesday the seventeenth. Be here at the same time
on Thursday. If it is humanly possible to help you we will. We
shall require a very large fee if we succeed and I shall ask you
for a hundred pounds now for preliminary expenses."</p>

<p>The young man counted out some notes. Clara handed him over a
receipt.</p>

<p>"I shall see you again," she reminded him, "on Thursday
morning."</p>

<p>That evening, whilst a very depressed Hulings was dressing for
dinner, the telephone rang in his little sanctum. He shook his
head.</p>

<p>"You can see who it is, Samson," he told his servant, "but if
it is anyone who wants me to dine or go out this evening say that
I am ill or engaged."</p>

<p>The man came back again a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"The Baroness Linz wishes to speak to you, sir," he
announced.</p>

<p>Hulings sprang to his feet and made his way to the instrument.
That same smooth, precise voice greeted him from the other end of
the wire.</p>

<p>"I am speaking to Mr. Hulings?"</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"This is the Baroness Linz. I am anxious to ask you a
question. It is not advisable to ask it over the telephone.
Please call in here within a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"I shall be there," he promised, "in ten minutes." He kept his
word. It was past eight o'clock but Clara was still in her small
salon seated before her desk. She offered no apologies for her
summons.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you, Mr. Hulings," she said, "in what manner
the information which Lord Reisborough threatens to use in his
newspaper came into his hands."</p>

<p>Hulings hesitated.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary for you to know that?"</p>

<p>"We cannot proceed with the case until we do."</p>

<p>"I am glad to be able to tell you," Hulings confided, "that
the leakage was not from any one of our departments. A copy
reached Lord Reisborough from someone in the service of the
Japanese Embassy."</p>

<p>"What have they to say about it there?"</p>

<p>"Very little. The ambassador expresses himself as humiliated
and quoted poetry to explain to us that he was sitting in ashes
and his soul was steeped in misery. Furthermore, his second
secretary, the most popular member of the Embassy, has
disappeared. Also his wife."</p>

<p>"Do you know what has become of them?"</p>

<p>"So far as he is concerned," Hulings replied, "I have not the
faintest doubt but that he has committed suicide."</p>

<p>"Have you made any enquiries as to what has become of
him?"</p>

<p>"It does not seem to matter much, does it? Nevertheless, we
did enquire. The Ambassador's reply, so far as I can remember it,
was that Kuniashi had returned to his ancestors."</p>

<p>Clara Linz considered the young man's reply with a deepening
frown on her forehead. Finally she rose abruptly to her feet.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you, Mr. Hulings," she begged, "to wait
here for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"I will wait all night if it is in any way helpful," the young
man assented.</p>

<p>Clara Linz left the room and was absent for some twenty
minutes. When she returned, to Hulings' surprise, she was dressed
for the street.</p>

<p>"I should like you to take me," she requested, "to the
Japanese Embassy."</p>

<p>Hulings was a trifle disappointed. It had seemed to him from
the first that Reisborough was their only hope. The Baron Kyashti
was a man of gentle plastic personality with nothing to offer but
regrets.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shan't have much chance of being received
without an appointment," he warned her.</p>

<p>"You will try," Clara insisted. "The matter, as you know
yourself, is urgent. The newspaper will be in the press at
midnight on Thursday. It is not a long time."</p>

<p>"Don't think I do not realise it," the young man groaned.
"Come along. I have my car outside and we will see what we can
do."</p>

<p>They drove through the crowded streets in silence &mdash;
Hulings himself at the wheel. At the Japanese Embassy they were
admitted and shown into a private waiting room. One of the
officials came quickly in answer to Hulings' enquiry.</p>

<p>"Is it a matter of unusual pressure, this, Mr. Hulings?" he
asked, speaking very precisely but in a high-pitched monotonous
voice. "His Excellency does not receive at these hours. He is
engaged in studying the day's despatches from Tokio."</p>

<p>"It is a matter of vital importance," Hulings assured him. "A
matter, too, in which His Excellency is also deeply
concerned."</p>

<p>There was another brief delay after which they were ushered
into a spacious but barely furnished apartment. Baron Kyashti was
seated upon a hard chair in front of a plain but handsome desk.
He was surrounded by a sea of papers. Two young men who were
sorting them were waved away. The Ambassador rose to his feet and
shook hands with Hulings.</p>

<p>"You will permit me to present the Baroness Linz, Your
Excellency," her escort begged. "You will understand, I am sure,
that we would not intrude if the matter were not one of
urgency."</p>

<p>The Baron was statuesquely polite and frigid.</p>

<p>"I will hear what you wish to say to me," he said. "It is not
my hour to receive. What is this lady's business?"</p>

<p>"I am the representative, Your Excellency, of an institution
which probably does not exist in your country," Clara explained.
"We call ourselves Advice Limited and our business is to help
people who find themselves in a serious position in life but are
unable to resort to the police."</p>

<p>"Criminals?" the Baron ventured.</p>

<p>"As a rule," she told him, "we work only for honest people.
There is a great deal of trouble into which an honest person can
get nowadays in which police intervention is impossible."</p>

<p>The Ambassador showed that he was not disposed to waste
words.</p>

<p>"It is still this terrible matter of Lord Reisborough's
threat, I presume," he said.</p>

<p>"It is," she assented. "We have been engaged by Mr. Hulings to
seek for some method of preventing Lord Reisborough carrying out
his threat and publishing a copy of the proposed Manchurian
Treaty which has been provisionally signed by the Prime
Minister."</p>

<p>"If you can do that," the Baron said gravely, "you will
perform a good office. It is not easy."</p>

<p>"It is not easy," Clara admitted. "You should be willing to
help, though, Your Excellency, if it is possible," she went on.
"The trouble started here, although it is Lord St. Alban who will
suffer."</p>

<p>"The lady's words have passed outside my comprehension," the
Ambassador confessed, turning to Hulings.</p>

<p>"What she means," the young man explained, "is that the
treacherous sale of the copy of the treaty to Reisborough was
effected from here."</p>

<p>The Baron winced perceptibly. If it were possible for him to
have gone paler he would have done so. The light in his eyes was
colder. His tone was icy.</p>

<p>"It is a great humiliation but it is the truth."</p>

<p>"Where is Kuniashi?" Hulings asked bluntly.</p>

<p>The Baron considered for a moment.</p>

<p>"Kuniashi is dead," he said with cold finality. Hulings
started. The woman gave vent to a smothered exclamation.</p>

<p>"How does this concern you?" the Ambassador demanded. "How are
you concerned in his life or death? Here you are in Japan. Here
things may happen which could not happen in the streets without
or the adjoining buildings. Here the laws of Japan are
administered. Kuniashi is dead."</p>

<p>"That seems rather a pity," Clara reflected. "His death was
well deserved, without a doubt, but there was just a chance that
certain information&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has no longer any information concerning events in this
world," Kyashti interrupted. "He was subjected to great
temptation and he fell. In the hours that followed came light.
The only thing that could happen to him has happened."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible that he should be dead," Clara reflected
in her matter-of-fact way. "There has been no word in the papers
&mdash; no announcement. People cannot disappear like that in
England."</p>

<p>"This is not England, Madam," was the measured reply. "I would
not have you doubt the word of a Japanese nobleman but with your
own eyes you shall see."</p>

<p>The Baron crossed the room with swift even footsteps. He
touched a bell and spoke to the servant who answered it a few
words in Japanese. Then he turned and beckoned his two visitors
to follow him. They passed across the great hall into one of the
smaller rooms at the back of the house. Every curtain was tightly
drawn. The room itself was in darkness until the Japanese servant
who had preceded them had touched the switch of the electric
light. They looked around curiously to find that they were in an
apartment almost devoid of furniture. Upon two wooden trestles at
the further end stood two coffins draped in white. In a niche of
the wall above them was the image of a Buddha seated with clasped
hands at the top of a gilded dais. The Ambassador motioned his
visitors forward and spoke a word or two to the servant, still in
Japanese. The latter lifted the lids of the two coffins. In the
nearer one was the body of a young man wrapped in a loose robe.
In the further one was the body of a girl in white. Both were
already embalmed. There were flowers on the bosom of the girl,
and fastened to the robe of the man, just over his heart, was an
oblong strip of paper. The Baron pointed to it. They both leaned
a little forward. It was a cheque upon a London bank for a
hundred thousand pounds and it was signed Reisborough!</p>

<p>"The bodies leave for Japan on Monday," the Ambassador
announced. "If this thing had happened in my own country Kuniashi
would have been less kindly treated. Here we had charity. The
woman was unused to Western ways and it was her voice which
prevailed."</p>

<p>"Kyoto &mdash; his wife," Hulings groaned.</p>

<p>"Certainly his wife," the Ambassador assented. "A Japanese
gentleman does not keep a mistress. When he commits a folly, when
he sins, it is for his wife. If this atonement, my friend Mr.
Hulings, can be of any satisfaction to your illustrious master
you can tell him that you have seen it. You will excuse?" Out in
the street they stumbled back into the car.</p>

<p>Hulings was still shivering as he took the wheel. The woman
was deep in thought.</p>

<p>"I am wondering," she confessed, "how this is going to help
us."</p>

<p>Reisborough, glossy and perfumed, with a white carnation in
his buttonhole, priceless black pearls in his shirtfront, his
shrunken limbs tailored by an artist, sat at dinner that night
with a sly grin of content upon his lips. It was a dinner <i>&agrave;
deux</i> at the most desirable table in the most fashionable club
restaurant of the moment, and his companion &mdash; Clara,
Baroness Linz &mdash; was one of the most admired women in
London. In his acquired habits Reisborough was no ordinary
vulgarian. He ordered his food and wine with distinction. His
manner with the waiters was excellent. Nothing that he did or
said savoured of ostentation. His conversation, perhaps, was
limited but he himself was a sympathetic listener. He was content
to know that his companion was exciting the admiration of all his
neighbours. It was only when she led the conversation around to
the power of the press that he expressed himself with a certain
amount of egotism.</p>

<p>"I never meant to be a newspaper man," he confided. "I was a
millionaire several times over before I sat back and asked how I
could make the best use of my money to gain power. A woman," he
went on, "lives for admiration. A man lives for power."</p>

<p>"There are other things in the lives of some of us," Clara
murmured, toying with her bracelets. "I agree with you so far as
men are concerned. There are a few women, however, who possess
brains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not many," he interrupted bluntly. "If they do they don't use
them. Haven't they proved it? Women are failures in every serious
position in life. They have had their chances and lost them. They
are objects of ridicule in Parliament or any public office. They
can write inferior novels glibly but there has never been a great
woman poetess, soldier, financier or diplomatist. Women are
coming back to their own in this generation. They are beginning
to understand again what their grandmothers knew &mdash; that
they were made for love and to be loved and for nothing
else."</p>

<p>She laughed softly and with genuine amusement. "The most
humorous part of it is," she declared, "that what you are saying
is very nearly the truth." "What I say generally has the truth in
it," he observed, so quietly that the conceit was almost
nonapparent. "I bought newspapers because through newspapers you
can govern the world much better than from the senate or
parliament. You can sit upon the Olympian mountain tops above the
clouds and listening nations will dance to the tune of your
trumpet."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," she admitted. "I do not agreed with
you but that makes no difference. I do not think I could even
explain."</p>

<p>"Try," he suggested.</p>

<p>"It is very difficult," she murmured. "The power of the press
is so ruthless. It is used to sway the mob, not to appeal to the
brains of the world. It can do as much harm as it does good. The
influence of a great statesman who has seen the truth and carried
it always with him lives after his death. The press is just a
day-by-day power. It fashions the thoughts of one week and pulls
down everything it has built up the next."</p>

<p>He indulged in his hateful smile.</p>

<p>"You will live and learn if you get to know me better," he
said. "I know of circumstances where the press in one issue can
send the fame of a great statesman crumbling into the dust, where
in one issue it can turn war into peace or peace into war."</p>

<p>"But its methods?" she argued. "Have you ever stopped to
analyse its methods? A foul little revolver can end the life of
the noblest of men. Those creeping reptiles from West African
forests can sting the life out of the great explorers of the
world. Any power is great that governs life or death, but it may
be foul."</p>

<p>"We must be friends," he insisted.</p>

<p>"You laugh at me," she complained. "Come, we have finished
dinner. It is too late for the theatres. Will you trust yourself
to me for half an hour and let me give you an instance of what I
mean?"</p>

<p>There was a sudden flash of suspicion in his face, a mean
thought that travelled through his mind. She laughed scornfully,
and so far as he could feel shame he felt it.</p>

<p>"You will run no risk," she assured him. "I wish you no harm.
You will come to none in my company."</p>

<p>"In your company I could find the one thing more to be valued
than power," he whispered.</p>

<p>She laughed again as she gathered her trifles together and
left the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Tell your man," she enjoined, as they stepped into the car,
"to drive to the side door of number 18 A., Grosvenor Gate. The
side door is in Ladbroke Street."</p>

<p>"Grosvenor Gate, 18 A., Grosvenor Gate," he repeated, as they
rolled off. "Surely that is the Japanese Embassy or next to
it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind where it is," she said. "I shall show you
something. I shall try to prove my point. Then, if you feel like
it, we can go on somewhere. We both have cards, I suppose, for
Berkeley House. One had better make one's bow there."</p>

<p>They pulled up in a dark narrow street. She stepped lightly on
to the pavement and rang the bell by the side of a solid door of
imposing appearance. The door was opened at once by a manservant
in sombre livery. Without any exchange of words he led them into
a vast, gloomy hall at the end of a long passage.</p>

<p>"Why, this is the Japanese Embassy!" Reisborough
exclaimed.</p>

<p>She held up her finger.</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>The man who was their guide led them, according to his
previously received instructions, into the chamber of death, and
turned on a light which showed them the two draped boxes and
flashed softly upon the set placidity of the ever watching
Buddha. In silence the man removed the two coverings. Clara
pointed downwards.</p>

<p>"Kuniashi and his bride Kyoto," she announced. "Do you see
what is pinned to his robe? It is what the Japanese call 'the
price of dishonour'."</p>

<p>"They are dead!" her companion gasped, as soon as the power of
speech came to him.</p>

<p>"They are dead," she assented. "It is the Juggernaut of the
press which has killed them. On Friday morning a famous statesman
may be crucified and a great newspaper treble its circulation.
Only listen to me, Lord Reisborough. If that happens there will
be another story the next day in the papers across the street.
There will be the true story of that cheque lying on a dead man's
chest and the history of the little Japanese girl, his wife,
lying by his side. Cannot you hear the wind of horror which will
sweep across the world when people realise the price that was
paid for their news?"</p>

<p>Reisborough said not a word. The lids were replaced. The light
was extinguished. Together they crossed the floor, made their way
down the passage and re-entered the waiting car.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do in this matter?" he demanded, his
thin voice more metallic and unpleasant than ever.</p>

<p>"Return the copy of the Manchurian agreement to the Japanese
Ambassador, find some other melodrama for the black headlines of
your newspaper on Friday morning and forget, above all forget,
upon your word of honour, the whole events of this evening and
every little thing which has connected me with it."</p>

<p>"A bargain," he agreed sourly....</p>

<p>The car rolled on through the thronged streets, Reisborough
leaning back in his corner, his arms folded, his forehead
furrowed, a shrunken figure of mingled malice and humiliation.
Suddenly his lips parted in a malevolent smile. His dominant
cynicism came to his rescue.</p>

<p>"The damn' thing looked safe enough where it was," he
muttered, "but I shall stop payment of that cheque the first
thing in the morning."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story3" name="story3">III. &mdash; BROKEN
ENGAGEMENTS</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE engagement is announced between Phillip
Stewart Perceval, Royal Dragoon Guards, eldest son of Colonel and
Mrs. Perceval of Leigh Castle, Devonshire, and Mary, younger
daughter of General Sir Richard Brattison and Lady Brattison.
Flora, Dowager Countess of Witherley, read out the announcement
from that morning's <i>Times</i> to the little gathering of
friends who had dropped in at her hospitable Mayfair maisonette
for a pre-luncheon cocktail. She glanced around with a smile of
approval.</p>

<p>"Well, here's one engagement at least," she remarked, "which
we may be sure won't be broken off. Those two young people are
obviously crazy about one another."</p>

<p>Freddy Witherley, her twenty-year-old son, who had the
reputation of being one of the best looking, best turned out and
most immoral young men in London, paused in his manipulation of
the gleaming silver shaker and looked around.</p>

<p>"They were getting positively maudlin," he said. "They have
even sunk so low as to be holding one another's hands under the
tablecloth at the Embassy the other night."</p>

<p>Clara, Baroness Linz, the beautiful Austrian who had taken all
London by storm, smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"Is there anything very maudlin about that?" she asked. "It is
a matter of sentiment. I must confess that I like to have my hand
held."</p>

<p>"If you would only make a confession like that at the right
moment," Freddy sighed, resuming his manipulations of the
shaker.</p>

<p>General Nightingale, the young man's uncle and Flora's
brother, raised his glass.</p>

<p>"We will drink their healths," he suggested. "I am dining with
the Brattisons to-night and I will give them all your
messages."</p>

<p>There were seven or eight young people in the room, all rather
typical of their age and circumstances. Doris Taylor, a very
bright young person indeed, who called herself the last of the
platinum blondes, set down her glass with a sigh of relief. "I
agree with Flora," she declared. "It is really a comfort to read
of an engagement between two young people who know their own
minds and are likely to go through with it."</p>

<p>"The season," Lady Osborne, the wife of a wellknown portrait
painter, remarked, "was becoming positively spoilt with all these
broken engagements. So awkward, too, to remember who was going to
be married and who wasn't."</p>

<p>Maurice Dimsdale, a wealthy but as yet unattached member of
the aristocracy, who preferred writing film plays and wearing
quaint garments to the ordinary routine life of his fellows,
nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"One felt," he observed, "that there was something sinister
about it."</p>

<p>The hostess of the light-hearted gathering shivered
slightly.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Maurice," she begged. "Broken engagements
must be quite common in the world at large."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, dear lady," Maurice assented, reaching out for a
cigarette, "but on the other hand think of the aftermath in most
of the cases we know about this season. Little Betty Crawshay
&mdash;" He glanced around the room. "Well, we all know that she
committed suicide. Then there was Helen Boyes. They gave out that
she had gone for a cruise round the world but I happen to know
for a fact that at the present moment she is in a sanatorium in
Switzerland. Then on my side of the fence there is Frank
Draycott. He resigned his commission, chucked soldiering
altogether and has gone out exploring in the South Seas. Of
course, he was desperately in love with Maggie, but what I could
not understand was that she seemed to be just as desperately in
love with him."</p>

<p>There was a cloud on Lady Witherley's sensitive face. She
seemed genuinely distressed.</p>

<p>"Do not let us drag up all those unhappy affairs," she
implored. "Mary is a dear, we all love her and, although she is
just a tiny bit of a flirt and rather too fond of dangerous
enterprises, she is also the type of girl who settles down
promptly when she has once made up her mind. As for Phillip, if I
were a girl instead of an elderly professional chaperon, he is
just the man I should have set my heart upon."</p>

<p>There was a little chorus of protest. Flora &mdash; although
it was perfectly well known that owing to her straitened means
she was always ready to chaperon young women for a consideration
&mdash; was a very popular person, especially amongst her younger
friends. "My darling," Doris Taylor, who was one of her present
charges, exclaimed, "even to-day there is not one of us has your
attraction and you know it! Every time you take us out I feel
that you could collect all the young men for yourself if you
wanted to and we should have to be content with the crumbs."</p>

<p>"Even I," Maurice Dimsdale intervened, "who could be
considered nothing but a crumb in this gathering, would rather
take you out, dear hostess, than any of these unfledged charges
of yours, if only you would forget sometimes that you are a
chaperon and give them all a lesson or two in the gentle arts of
flirtation."</p>

<p>Flora laughed happily.</p>

<p>"I must do my duty to my debutantes when I am lucky enough to
have any," she declared. "When everyone is married who I think
ought to be married?"</p>

<p>"I am first on the list," Maurice insisted.... It looked all
right but exactly three weeks afterwards the following notice
appeared in the <i>Times</i>:</p>

<p class="newspaper">The marriage arranged between Phillip
Stewart Perceval, Royal Dragoon Guards, and Mary, younger
daughter of General Sir Richard and Lady Brattison, will not take
place.</p>

<p>General Nightingale and Colonel Sir Francis Dobson, Chief
Commissioner of Scotland Yard, were old friends. The former,
therefore, had no difficulty in securing an appointment at police
headquarters and on his arrival was ushered promptly and with
much courtesy into the Chief's presence. The two men shook hands
warmly. Cigarettes were favourably considered. The visitor was
established in an easy chair.</p>

<p>"Last man I should have expected to see here," Sir Francis
remarked, with a twinkle in his eyes. "What can I do for you,
General?"</p>

<p>"Try and not laugh at me in the first place."</p>

<p>"I think I can promise that. Go ahead."</p>

<p>The General settled down.</p>

<p>"I know," he began, "that you are too busy a man to go into
what we call society very much and its gossip naturally does not
interest you. I shall ask you, therefore, to take my word for
granted as regards the details of what I am going to tell
you."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Sir Francis agreed. "Saves time, too."</p>

<p>"Since the first of February," his caller continued, "there
have been seventeen engagements between well-known young people
in society announced and broken off. Three or four of them have
patched things up but there are twelve I know of where the thing
has ended practically in tragedy."</p>

<p>"An inconstant age," the Chief Commissioner remarked.</p>

<p>The General frowned.</p>

<p>"I want you to look at this matter a little more seriously,"
he begged. "Of course it may seem ridiculous to you to connect
these episodes with your work here at Scotland Yard but I can
assure you that to us who have known many of the young people
there is something &mdash; to use the word a young friend of
mine, Maurice Dimsdale, used at my sister's the other morning
&mdash; sinister about these happenings."</p>

<p>Sir Francis was puzzled at his friend's earnestness.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean this. Just as many years ago there was a horrible sort
of crusade going on amongst the lower orders in which Jack the
Ripper went about mutilating bodies, so I am convinced that there
is amongst us in society to-day some moral leper who is going
about working evil amongst the souls of our young people."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner stared blankly across the desk at his
visitor. Nightingale, as he remembered him, had always been a
stolid but successful soldier, the last man in the world likely
to embrace a fantastic theory on any subject. Yet he was
obviously in earnest. He had something of the grim look in his
face which the Chief Commissioner, who in those days had been a
soldier, had seen one night when the field telephones near Mons
broke down and his brigade was in danger.</p>

<p>"Have you any facts to go on, General?" he asked. "Anyone you
suspect of slander-mongering or blackmail or anything of that
sort?"</p>

<p>"I have no facts," the other admitted, "and I have no definite
suspicions. The more I consider the matter the more bewildered I
become. I simply have the conviction that there is something
wrong."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. The Chief Commissioner fingered his
closely cropped grey moustache and became official. He chose his
words carefully.</p>

<p>"If that's all you can tell me, General," he said, "I am
afraid that at its present stage this matter is not one with
which Scotland Yard can concern itself." General Nightingale
nodded.</p>

<p>"I was afraid that you would say something like that," he
confessed. "On the other hand how can we advance it a stage? How
can we move in the matter at all except with the help of the
machinery which you possess &mdash; detectives and all that sort
of thing?"</p>

<p>Sir Francis ignored his friend's lack of logic.</p>

<p>"You must remember," he pointed out patiently, "that these
broken engagements of which you speak consist, I presume, of,
young people drawn from different families and different parts of
England."</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Then what common object could there be to induce any one
person or group of persons to interfere malevolently in their
affairs?"</p>

<p>"Hanged if I know," the General admitted bluntly.</p>

<p>"If there is any definite agency at work," the Chief
Commissioner continued, "it must be the work of a madman. There
is no possible motive which would apply to all of them. My own
opinion is that what you have told me is just an indication of
the disquiet which reigns everywhere just now. We are still
suffering from the aftermath of the war and our young people
&mdash; well, they may be smarter and cleverer than we used to be
but they certainly are not so well balanced."</p>

<p>"You don't think you can help me at all then?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't know where to start," Sir Francis confessed. "I
could not possibly put any of my men on to an affair of this
sort, especially just now. We are having a perfectly rotten time.
Motor bandits using firearms and shooting our insufficiently
protected policemen. Three murderers at large. A fresh burglary
nearly every night. Those are definite crimes, you see, and the
sort of crimes we are here to fight against. We could not
possibly go off on such a fantastic quest as you suggest."</p>

<p>The General sighed.</p>

<p>"Can't say I am surprised at your decision," he acknowledged.
"I expected something of the sort. Still, just put yourself in my
place for a moment. Imagine that you shared my conviction. What
should you do?"</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner's face cleared. He had an idea.</p>

<p>"I'll tell what I should do," he replied. "I shouldn't bother
about Scotland Yard at all. The affair has not reached a point at
which we could intervene usefully. I should go and see this new
firm of enquiry agents, or whatever they call themselves, Advice
Limited, 12.A. Adam Street, Strand."</p>

<p>"Never heard of them," the General declared gruffly.</p>

<p>"Well, I have and I can assure you of one thing &mdash;they
have done some very clever work. I cannot give our secrets away
and I won't say more than that we came in touch with them over
the Dover gold robbery and I was considerably impressed."</p>

<p>"But who are they? Where is their office?"</p>

<p>"I tell you frankly," Sir Francis confessed, "I have not the
slightest idea myself as to who the principal is. They do most of
their work quite secretly but they are just the people to deal
with an affair like yours. Here's their address anyhow."</p>

<p>He tore off a sheet of paper from his memorandum block,
scribbled upon it and handed it across the counter.</p>

<p class="letter">ADVICE LIMITED, 12.A. Adam Street.</p>

<p>"It is just at the corner of Adelphi Terrace," he explained.
"You will find it quite easily."</p>

<p>The General accepted the paper and thrust it into his
waistcoat pocket a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Can I say that you sent me to them?</p>

<p>Allegorically speaking the Commissioner's hair stood on
end.</p>

<p>"For God's sake &mdash; no! Don't mention my name whatever you
do. This advice of mine is absolutely unofficial. Just ask to see
their principal and state your case as you have stated it to me.
If they take it up I must warn you of one thing &mdash; you will
have to pay through the nose.... What about lunching at the Club
together? It's nearly one."</p>

<p>The General shook his head.</p>

<p>"Can't to-day," he regretted, preparing to take his leave. "I
have a couple of ladies lunching at the Embassy. See you later in
the week."...</p>

<p>General Nightingale was an ardent pedestrian and he walked
across the Park and up St. James's Street towards his
destination. As he waited to cross Piccadilly a girl, driving a
two-seater car, passed him. She waved her hand gaily and threw
him a kiss. The General sighed as he returned the salute.</p>

<p>"Bluff," he murmured to himself. "Needn't have tried it with
me. I am too old a hand to be taken in by forced gaiety. Damn
that fellow Perceval!"</p>

<p>He was still fuming when he greeted his two guests &mdash; the
Baroness Linz and his sister Lady Witherley.</p>

<p>"You come to our little party, General, like a man to his own
execution," Clara complained. "Is it that you do not like us this
morning? My new costume does not please you?"</p>

<p>"My dears, I love you both, and your costumes are charming,"
the General declared. "To tell the truth Mary Brattison passed me
driving her car in Piccadilly. At one moment she was looking like
a ghost and then comes a beaming smile and all that sort of
thing. What it must cost a proud young woman like that to face
all her friends as though nothing had happened!"</p>

<p>"You are a dear sympathetic man, General," the Baroness
sighed. "Myself I wonder that someone does not do something about
all these broken engagements."</p>

<p>Her host set down his cocktail glass and looked at his vis-a-
vis with interest.</p>

<p>"My dear Baroness," he observed, "I am just beginning to think
the same thing myself."</p>

<p>Flora closed her vanity case with a snap.</p>

<p>"But what can one do?" she asked. "I hate to see young people
unhappy. The trouble with this last young couple is that they
won't allow anyone to speak to them. Phillip dined with us
quietly last night. You know what a dear sympathetic girl Maisie
is, and Doris as a rule can make any man forget anything except
herself! Neither of them could get him to say a word about
Mary!"</p>

<p>"Dined with you?" the General repeated, a little surprised. "I
fancied him halfway acoss Europe."</p>

<p>His sister shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I always think it is a stupid thing to do to run away from
trouble," she said. "Maisie is so sympathetic and she seemed to
quite cheer him up before he left. Temporary, of course, quite
temporary, but if one can forget one's troubles in this world for
a few minutes it is something. I fancy they are lunching here to-
day."</p>

<p>The General looked speculatively at his empty glass.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked, "I should have thought one of them might
have cleared out. It can't be pleasant for either if they happen
to meet."</p>

<p>Flora sighed plaintively.</p>

<p>"Young people get over that sort of thing much quicker
nowadays," she murmured.</p>

<p>"All the same," Clara Linz said with her delightful little
foreign lisp, "I think that something ought to be done to see if
there is anything behind this awful epidemic of broken
engagements."</p>

<p>Their host ordered another round of cocktails. He determined
to make confidantes of these two sympathetic women. He drew his
chair a trifle nearer.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you both," he confided, "that I am
entirely of your opinion. I think that something ought to be
done. In fact, I made a blundering sort of effort this morning. I
went down to Scotland Yard and had a talk with my friend Dobson,
the Chief Commissioner."</p>

<p>They both looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Scotland Yard!" Flora exclaimed. "Where on earth could they
come in?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," the General replied doggedly. "I only
know that a remark of Maurice Dimsdale's the other day put it
into my head. You remember, Flora? He remarked that there seemed
to be something sinister about this long trail of broken
engagements. Sinister is the word that struck me."</p>

<p>"It is terribly interesting," Flora meditated. "A most
intriguing idea. But Henry &mdash; none of these young people, so
far as I can remember, were connected in any way. Some of them
were not in the same set. How could there be any one influence at
work that could affect them all?"</p>

<p>"That is what puzzled me," he admitted. "That is why my friend
Dobson gave me the cold shoulder, I expect."</p>

<p>"Dear me, I don't know about this second cocktail," Flora
declared, holding the glass firmly in her fingers and raising it
to her lips. "Remember, Henry, I positively refuse to drink any
wine for luncheon. That is my regime. Two cocktails &mdash; no
wine. One cocktail &mdash; just half a glass, perhaps. One has to
be so careful these days, especially with girls to look after who
are watching you all the time!"</p>

<p>"I always think, my dear," the Baroness observed, "that it is
because you are so human and yet so careful that you are so
successful with all the young women you take under your wing. But
General," she went on, "tell us about this police friend of
yours. Did he refuse to help in any way?"</p>

<p>General Nightingale nodded.</p>

<p>"He just told me that it was not an affair for the law."</p>

<p>"Did he offer no suggestions at all?" Flora asked.</p>

<p>"He advised me to go to a firm of private agents," her brother
confided. "I suppose that means detectives."</p>

<p>"Any particular one?" Clara enquired.</p>

<p>The General produced a scrap of paper from his pocket-book and
adjusted his eyeglass.</p>

<p>"Name of Advice Limited," he announced. "Francis says that
they have done some very good outside work and that someone
connected with the firm is a very brilliant person. I thought of
looking them up this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Advice Limited," Clara repeated. "I have heard them spoken
of. They did something for one of the European governments. They
are very clever, I believe, but they charge a great deal of
money."</p>

<p>"When I think of poor Mary's face this morning," the General
sighed, "I feel that I would give all my small fortune willingly
if that could help."</p>

<p>Flora patted him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"You are a dear, Henry," she said affectionately. "You are
always thinking about other people. I am afraid this is a rather
Don Quixote enterprise, but if these people could really hold out
any hope I think we all ought to club together and give
something."</p>

<p>"I would be glad to come in," the Baroness offered. Their host
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"You are two sweet women," he declared, "but the only thing we
need to think about for the next hour is luncheon. Andrew has
just signalled that our table is ready and I have a soldier's
appetite."</p>

<p>Flora laid her fingers upon his arm with a gay little laugh as
they climbed the stairs.</p>

<p>"This dear brother of mine is almost the shyest man I know,"
she exclaimed. "I can feel him shivering at the idea of taking
money from women, even though they are relatives. All the same I
feel that we ought to help in an affair of this sort if there is
anything to be done."</p>

<p>Clara Linz said nothing but her reflective smile was in its
way acquiescent. As they took their places at the very desirable
table reserved for them one of General Nightingale's young
friends in a distant corner smiled enviously.</p>

<p>"Just like the old boy," he confided to his companion. "An
out-and-out old bachelor. Declares that he avoids the sex
whenever he can and has the two best-looking women in London
lunching with him!"</p>

<p>At four o'clock that afternoon, which he judged to be an
auspicious hour for such a visit, General Nightingale was ushered
into a small, charmingly furnished salon on the second floor of a
house in Adam Street, at the corner of Adelphi Terrace. To his
utter amazement he was greeted by Clara Linz.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing here?" he asked in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"And you?" she enquired with a smile.</p>

<p>"No good beating about the bush so far as I am concerned," he
replied. "I have come to consult this mysterious firm who call
themselves Advice Limited."</p>

<p>"And I am here," she told him, "because I am Advice
Limited."</p>

<p>The General flopped into a chair. He looked, as he felt,
completely dazed.</p>

<p>"So this is your mysterious occupation," he muttered. "I have
been told that you were everything from a Soviet spy to the
secret head of M.I.7A. at the Foreign Office!"</p>

<p>"And now you know the truth," she told him calmly. "I am the
owner of a private enquiry office which, with the help of a few
employees who never appear, I manage to run very
successfully."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" the General exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Having got over the preliminaries," she suggested, "supposing
we come to business."</p>

<p>"I &mdash; well, you know the business as well as I do."
"Perhaps I do," she admitted. "That may prove helpful. In any
case you do not need to make a long statement. You know who I am
now. If you still decide to trust me perhaps I might be of
assistance."</p>

<p>"Of course, I trust you," he declared. "But you don't mind my
confessing that this has been a bit of a shock?"</p>

<p>"Not an unpleasant one, I hope," she observed. "The only
difference it seems to me is that knowing all I do when I have
asked you a few questions I ought to be able to get to work at
once."</p>

<p>The General pulled down his waistcoat, straightened his tie
and prepared to meet the situation.</p>

<p>"Go ahead with the questions, then," he begged.</p>

<p>"You say that a young friend of yours gave you this uneasy
sense of there being something sinister at work to account for
this large number of broken engagements," she reminded him. "What
do you mean by 'something sinister'?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," the General confessed. "I thought of
blackmail, but I do not see the application. I thought of some
superscandal monger, but I cannot find a motive. I simply feel
that there must be something at work underneath."</p>

<p>"You say that there have been seventeen broken engagements
since January," Clara observed. "I suppose I must have heard
about them but I was not taking a professional interest in the
matter then. Can you give me the names of the young people?"</p>

<p>The General rose to his feet and produced a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>"I thought you might ask that and I made out a list before I
came," he announced. "You will see that there are people in every
walk of life &mdash; soldiers, sailors, politicians, landowners,
members of the nobility &mdash; American girls, English girls,
Scotch girls."</p>

<p>"I want, if I may, to speak of Flora for a minute, General.
You don't mind?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"She is in the habit, I believe," his questioner went on, "of
taking charge occasionally of young debutantes for the season
&mdash; taking them to Court and placing them in society?"</p>

<p>"Quite true," he admitted a little stiffly. "My sister is not
very well off and she finds it a pleasant way of adding to her
income."</p>

<p>"Quite a common one nowadays, I understand. Can you tell me
whether any of the young girls whom she has looked after have
suffered in this way?"</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge," the General answered. "In fact, I can
assure you that they have not. On the contrary several, I think,
have been very successfully married."</p>

<p>"I must ask you this, General," she continued turning towards
him again. "Was there any particular reason for your coming to
consult me just now?"</p>

<p>"In a way there was," he admitted. "The trouble between the
last two young people on my list disturbed me personally more
than any other. I am very fond of the young lady, Mary Brattison,
and I like the young man."</p>

<p>"Have you made any attempt to find out from them the cause of
their broken engagement?" she asked. "You would be, I am sure,
such a sympathetic sort of person to confide in," she went on
with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have," he acknowledged. "I have been to Mary Brattison, but
although I have known her since she was a baby she absolutely
refused to exchange a single word with me on the subject. Her
father, who is one of my oldest friends, declares that she is
adamant on the subject, even with him. I then went to the young
man, whom I have always considered one of the best mannered young
fellows I have ever known, and he practically told me to mind my
own business!"</p>

<p>"That seems curious. As a rule in an affair of this sort one
of the two think they have a grievance and they are only too glad
to find a confidant."</p>

<p>"It certainly was not so in this case," he sighed. "Neither of
them would have anything to do with me."</p>

<p>Clara reflected for a few moments.</p>

<p>"What you want to find out," she said, "is &mdash; to put it
in a nutshell &mdash; whether there is any person or company of
persons who are interested in breaking off marriages between
thirty or forty people, none of whom were connected with one
another, and if there is, how they went about it."</p>

<p>"Quite right," the General admitted.</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall accept the case," she announced. "If I
succeed entirely you will have to pay the firm of Advice Limited
five hundred guineas. If I fail it will only cost the fifty
guineas which I shall have to ask you for to cover our
preliminary enquiries."</p>

<p>The General produced a cheque and also a fountain pen from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Shall I make it payable to Advice Limited or to you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"To Advice Limited, if you please." The General sat down and
wrote. When he had finished he glanced curiously around at the
beautifully panelled walls hung with a few choice etchings and
the bowl of red roses upon the table.</p>

<p>"I have never been in a private enquiry office or detective
agency before," he observed. "Are they all like this?"</p>

<p>"Not one of them," the representative of Advice Limited
assured him as she blotted the cheque, handed over a receipt and
rang the bell.</p>

<p>Clara, Baroness Linz, leaned back in the corner of her divan
seat and laughed. She was dining that evening at a small but very
select restaurant with the "show boy" of London, as he was
nicknamed, and she was very much amused.</p>

<p>"My dear Freddy," she said, "you are a very entertaining
&mdash; what is the word, I wonder? &mdash; scapegrace, and I
always find you a pleasant companion, but as to marrying you
&mdash; why, it is too ridiculous!" There was a sullen look upon
the young man's handsome face.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded. "We have always been good pals. We have
been out together quite a great deal, especially lately, and I am
sure we get on wonderfully."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"That may be true," she admitted. "I find you a pleasant
companion &mdash; yes. But &mdash; as a husband &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well? Go on!"</p>

<p>"For one thing you are eight years younger than I am."</p>

<p>"That's of no consequence nowadays. You will admit, I hope,
that I am very advanced for my years."</p>

<p>"Far too much so," she acknowledged drily. "But there is
another thing &mdash; forgive me &mdash; of even greater
importance. You have no profession nor, so far as I know, any
settled income. I am a very extravagant person. I owe bills now
in Paris, Vienna and Rome. I shall pay them, of course, but it
would be more agreeable to me were my husband to do so."</p>

<p>"I am not a pauper," the young man assured her. "My mother
makes me a very decent allowance and I have another bachelor
uncle beside the General. They are both going to leave me their
money."</p>

<p>"I do not think," Clara said coldly, "that I should care about
waiting for that. I do not think either that I should care about
living with a man who did nothing in life, and you must forgive
me again if I sound rude but I did not think that your mother's
means would permit of her making you a sufficient allowance."</p>

<p>"How do you know what my mother's means are?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she admitted. "I only understand, like other
people, that your mother is compelled to add to her income by
presenting debutantes at Court and looking after them
generally."</p>

<p>"Well," he confided, "that's not such a bad egg. I have nearly
a thousand a year of my own anyhow and my mother allows me four.
Then, if we really need the money, they all tell me that I could
make a fortune on the films."</p>

<p>Clara raised her eyebrows. There was a look of incredulity in
her soft eyes.</p>

<p>"Four thousand a year," she repeated. "My dear Freddy, we will
leave films alone but I really do not see how your mother can
afford to allow you a sum like that."</p>

<p>"It's quite true," he assured her. "Remember this, my mother
is no fool and she only takes the girls of rich families. She
gets a commission upon every one of them if they marry
satisfactorily, as well as the usual fees for presenting and
taking them around. She has had tremendous luck, of course, with
the girls. In the last four seasons she married off ten of them.
I won't tell you what she made out of the Moxendale young
woman!"</p>

<p>"I had no idea," Clara meditated, "that your mother was such a
clever woman."</p>

<p>"You won't give it away, will you?" he begged in sudden
disquietude.</p>

<p>"Of course I will not," she promised. "Five thousand a year is
quite a good income."</p>

<p>"We could manage upon it," he insisted eagerly, "even if you
had very little."</p>

<p>"We will not discuss my means just yet. This divine waltz!
Just one turn."</p>

<p>They danced for some time. Clara was inclined to be distraite.
When they sat down again she leaned a little closer towards him.
He responded almost fatuously. It was plain that she was
impressed!</p>

<p>"Freddy," she said, "do you really think that there is any
chance of Phillip Perceval taking a fancy to that little
debutante of your mother's? Not Doris, of course. The South
African one, I mean. Maisie Soher her name is, I believe."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't be surprised," the young man replied. "If it comes
off we shall touch a cool ten thousand."</p>

<p>Clara looked down in case he might see the gleam in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You are so clever, Freddy," she murmured. "You get to know
all about these things. What was the quarrel between Phillip and
Mary?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that there ever was one," he confided. "It was
just something he found out. A week-end visit of Mary
Brattison's, I think, that was on the fishy side. Somewhere down
the river, I believe, but I never heard the details. Mary is a
good-looking girl and I used to go about with her quite a good
deal but somehow or other she never attracted me. My uncle is
crazy about her."</p>

<p>"I always thought that she was quite a nice girl," Clara
remarked. "How delicious these quails are! You do know how to
order a dinner, Freddy. I am afraid that appeals to a Viennese
woman. We are always greedy."</p>

<p>"I took special pains about this one anyway," was the
gratified reply.</p>

<p>"When was this romance of Mary's supposed to have taken
place?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't remember," the young man confessed. "Why are you
so curious?"</p>

<p>She caught the light of suspicion in his eyes and she patted
the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"I am not really," she assured him. "Perhaps I have been
jealous of Mary! I rather wonder your mother has not married you
off, Freddy, to one of these wonderful young heiresses."</p>

<p>"She knows it is not any use trying," he declared. "I hate
ingenues anyway. I have not looked at any woman, Clara, since I
danced with you at the Embassy that night three or four months
ago."</p>

<p>"I remember quite well," she said coolly. "I had to turn you
out of the house when I allowed you to come in for a drink."</p>

<p>He flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," he begged. "Any fellow would have
lost his head about you that night. Couldn't you please make up
your mind?"</p>

<p>She lit a cigarette and laughed at him.</p>

<p>"I shall have to be an awful long time thinking it over," she
warned him. "A flirtation is very pleasant but marriage is
serious."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>She gathered up her belongings, waited until her companion had
paid the bill and rose to her feet. There was an unanalysable
smile about her lips.</p>

<p>"You can ask me again next month," she said, "if you still
feel like it."</p>

<p>At four o'clock on the date arranged General Nightingale
presented himself at the house in Adam Street and found Clara
prepared to receive him.</p>

<p>"Any news for me, Baroness?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted. "I have a certain amount of information
for you."</p>

<p>The General was taken aback. He had thought over his visit
once or twice during the week and had come to the conclusion that
it was absurd to expect any corroboration of Maurice Dimsdale's
vague remark. He leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have discovered some link between all
these untoward happenings?" he demanded. "Do you mean that there
has been some mischief-maker at work?"</p>

<p>"There has certainly been some very serious mischief making,"
she assented. "I have only gone into one of the cases &mdash; the
most recent one &mdash; but from the nature of its solution I
have no doubt that all the others, or the greater part of them at
any rate, are to be accounted for in a similar manner."</p>

<p>The General was not diplomat enough to conceal his
surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that we are going to get to the bottom of this?"
he exclaimed in some excitement. "That you have definite
information to offer me?"</p>

<p>"I have indeed," she confessed. "I am afraid you will not
appreciate it very much but of course you took that risk when you
came here. We generally succeed. I should not have taken your
case if I had not thought that we should."</p>

<p>"You said just now that you only investigated one of the most
recent cases. Do you mean the affair of Mary Brattison and
Perceval?"</p>

<p>"That is the one which Advice Limited has investigated."</p>

<p>"And you can explain it?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"I presume that you want to know the truth," she proceeded.
"You will have to pay for the investigations anyhow so you may as
well know the result."</p>

<p>Then for a moment General Nightingale hesitated. He had a
curious indefinite premonition of tragedy. The woman's tone was
level, her manner was composed, yet to him she had the air of one
who might be capable at any moment of wielding thunderbolts. He
felt an ignoble temptation to pick up his hat, hand over the
cheque which she might ask for and hurry out with his hands over
his ears. Even then he had no definite prescience of what was to
come.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that I came here for nothing, Baroness?" he
asked, and as the words left his lips he was surprised at the
sound of his own voice which seemed to have developed a new
harshness. "I shall pay what you demand for your investigations.
I expect to hear everything."</p>

<p>Clara had the air of a woman about to embark upon an
unpleasant task. Her voice was softer. She avoided looking at her
client.</p>

<p>"The rupture of the engagement between Captain Perceval and
the young lady," she went on, "was due to the fact that someone
brought to Captain Perceval a sheet cut out from the hotel
visitors' book of a smart but somewhat notorious little hotel in
the Thames district. The entry on that sheet indicated that Miss
Brattison had stayed at the hotel in question one night early in
the year and had occupied communicating rooms with a rather well-
known young man-about-town. The numbers of the rooms were given
and the fact that there was a single bathroom between the two was
made apparent."</p>

<p>The General was a clean-minded man and he shivered.</p>

<p>"Mary Brattison!" he exclaimed. "My God, it's impossible!"</p>

<p>"That was the cause of the rupture of the engagement,
General," she assured him.</p>

<p>"And Perceval was fool enough to believe it?"</p>

<p>"The evidence was somewhat conclusive and the handwriting of
the two young people indisputable," was the grave reply. "This
younger world nowadays have got into the habit of going great
lengths.... Now shall I tell you what really happened?"</p>

<p>There was a gleam of hope in the General's eager
monosyllable.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Miss Brattison was there with a somewhat gay party on the
date indicated. The head waiter, an Italian, who by-the-by has
been in prison in his own country, brought them a visitors' book
when they were all feeling very pleased with themselves after
dinner and begged them to sign it. They signed thinking that the
book was simply what it appeared to be &mdash; a register of
people who had visited the place. Afterwards the sheet was
tampered with. The numbers of the bedrooms and other
incriminating particulars were added. The sheet was cut out by
this waiter and later it came into the possession of Captain
Perceval."</p>

<p>"A foul blackmailing trick," the General cried. "Thank God we
have a chance to clear the thing up."</p>

<p>"It will cost you a great deal to clear it up, General," she
warned him.</p>

<p>"Money be damned," was the indignant rejoinder. "If it costs
me my whole fortune &mdash;"</p>

<p>"It will cost you more than your fortune."</p>

<p>The old apprehensions were back again. He stared at her. It
seemed to him that everything else in the room faded away, that
he could see only that queer sympathetic lightening of her grave
face. Pity! How in life he had always scorned pity!</p>

<p>"It was a plot, General," she disclosed reluctantly, "and a
disgraceful one. I am rather sorry that you came to us but since
you came you must know the truth. The plot was conceived and
carried out by your sister, the Countess of Witherley, and her
son, your nephew."</p>

<p>The General gripped the arms of his high backed chair. He was
almost speechless but it seemed to him somehow or other now that
the blow had fallen that he had already been dimly groping
amongst the mists of suspicion.</p>

<p>"Go on," he groaned.</p>

<p>"Lady Witherley has done something of the same sort to others.
She and her son have been very clever schemers. I daresay you
know that in addition to her usual fees she gets a very large
commission upon any debutante she marries suitably. Four of her
debutantes at different times have been married to men whose love
affairs she has interfered with in some subtle fashion or other
and who have become easy victims afterwards. Here and there men
have escaped, of course &mdash; gone abroad, turned against all
women, however subtle their wiles. In other cases she has
succeeded. She was apparently on the point of success with
Captain Perceval. Our reports go on to prove that since the
breaking off of his engagement he has been a frequent visitor at
your sister's house and that he has been seen often in company
with one of her principal debutantes whom she is presenting next
month."</p>

<p>The General covered his face with his hands. It never occurred
to him to doubt one word of what this woman had said. Her voice
was like the voice of Fate itself. Besides, he knew his nephew
and he was not nearly so sure as he would like to have been about
Flora!</p>

<p>"You must allow me &mdash; you must excuse me for one moment,"
he begged.</p>

<p>She affected to be busy with some papers. When she looked up
the General was standing by her side, his chequebook in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Baroness," he said, "I thank you and your firm for their good
offices. Be so kind as to hand me such proofs as you possess of
this shameful story and if you will permit me the use of that pen
your cheque is here."</p>

<p>She produced a small packet of which he took careful
possession. He wrote the cheque and passed it to her. For the
first time to any client she extended her hand. There was
sympathy shining out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, General," she assured him as she touched the
bell, "but you yourself drew down the thunders."</p>

<p>On the fringe of Flora Witherley's informal before-dinner
gathering the General stood waiting. He spoke to no one, he
refused the cocktails which were being freely handed round. There
was the usual quantity of chaff and badinage to which he appeared
to be deaf. In the midst of all the gaiety Flora happened to
catch a glimpse of her brother's face and she felt a cold shiver
of apprehension. She remembered suddenly that on his arrival he
had begged her to cut short the party as soon as possible. She
summoned Freddy to her side.</p>

<p>"The old man wants to talk to us," she whispered. "I am afraid
you will have to hurry them off a bit."</p>

<p>Freddy made a grimace.</p>

<p>"What does he want?" he demanded sulkily.</p>

<p>"Clara promised to come in later on."</p>

<p>He glanced across towards his uncle and suddenly he too felt
something of his mother's apprehension. The latter raised her
voice a little.</p>

<p>"All you darling people," she said. "I am so sorry but we are
going to the theatre to-night. I shall have to clear you out. To-
morrow evening at the same time."</p>

<p>They drifted away pleasantly and easily, with leave-takings
curtailed after the modern fashion&mdash; a chattering, slangy,
good-hearted little company. The time came when the General was
alone with his sister and nephew. He drew them into the inner
apartment where the cocktails were mixed and closed the door
behind him. Then apprehension turned into chill fear for he stood
facing them both and before he opened his lips there were
terrible things to be read in his eyes.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour the General had returned to his own
bachelor abode. Almost before Groves, his attentive butler,
touched his overcoat he asked a feverish question.</p>

<p>"Anyone called, Groves?"</p>

<p>"Miss Mary Brattison is in your study, sir. She said that she
had come in response to a note of yours."</p>

<p>The doorbell rang almost as he finished speaking.</p>

<p>"If that is Captain Perceval," the General ordered, "show him
into the study at once."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," the man assented. "I rather fancy that it
may be the Captain, sir. I saw his car turn out of Queen Street
as you came in."</p>

<p>The General made his way to the study. He was very fond of
Mary Brattison and his heart ached, not so much at the change in
her appearance as for the brave effort at gaiety with which she
greeted his entrance.</p>

<p>"You dear man," she exclaimed. "But how dare you compromise me
in this fashion &mdash; asking me to come and visit a dangerous
bachelor like you, for instance, just as I am supposed to be
nursing a broken heart?"</p>

<p>He took her hands and held them tightly.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, "I want you to promise me that you will stay
just where you are &mdash; never mind who might happen to
come."</p>

<p>The colour slowly left her cheeks.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded with a catch in her
throat.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. The butler stood just inside
the room announcing a visitor.</p>

<p>"Captain Perceval, sir."</p>

<p>The man and the girl stood facing one another.</p>

<p>For a single moment something of eager suppressed joy seemed
to flash backwards and forwards between them. Then a steely light
gleamed in the girl's eyes. The man drew himself up but the
General manoeuvered his way between them and the door.</p>

<p>"You two young people," he said, "need not speak to one
another for the moment. They call me a silent man but I am going
to do the talking here. You trust me &mdash; both of you?"</p>

<p>Even the two affirmatives seemed reluctantly spoken. They were
honest, though. There was not a person in the world who did not
trust Henry Nightingale.</p>

<p>"I want you both to remember," he continued, "that the few
words I am going to say to you are the most painful to me
personally that I have ever spoken. I am a humiliated and ashamed
old man&mdash; I who have always tried to hold my head high
amongst my fellows. Think of that and be kind."</p>

<p>All the smaller angers and jealousies and suspicions of the
moment seemed to fade away. There must be something behind this
&mdash; something vital. They both turned eagerly towards him.
Then he told his story. With shaking fingers he unrolled the
sheet which had been cut from the hotel book. He pointed to the
numbers of the rooms.</p>

<p>"Forgeries," he announced quietly, but in a tone which carried
irresistible conviction. "There are no rooms of these numbers in
the hotel. Forgeries committed by my nephew, my sister's son.
They are worse than forgeries. They are the keynote of a
diabolical plot. Listen."</p>

<p>The General was known as a bad after-dinner speaker. He had
once been asked to stand for Parliament but after his first
effort at oratory the matter had been dropped. Yet at this moment
he seemed gifted with a strange power of lucidity. Not one word
too much. Not one word of exaggeration. No help from adjectives.
The plain truth. Before he had finished the two were in one
another's arms, each trying to sob out the pain of their hearts.
The General stood very upright. His face seemed thinner. He had
very much the air of a lay bishop.</p>

<p>"Please listen &mdash; please be guided by me. I am an old man
and this has been a shock."</p>

<p>They were by his side in a moment. He kissed Mary on the
cheek. He shook hands with Perceval. He rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Will you two please do all that I ask?" he pleaded. "I can
see that you will. Take her away, Phillip, and stay with her.
Never mind if either of you have engagements. Take her out and
dine somewhere and dance afterwards and forget it all. I should
look for a Registry Office if I were you within the next day or
two, but take her away now."</p>

<p>For the first time his voice trembled and they hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not well, sir," Perceval said.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you come with us?" Mary whispered. "We could show
you how happy two stupid young people can be. It would take a
lifetime to say how grateful we are, but one might try."</p>

<p>He wrung their hands. Groves appeared on the threshold. The
General waved his feverish farewell.</p>

<p>"The door, Groves," he ordered. "Drive carefully, young
fellow," he enjoined. "I saw you going down to Ranelagh yesterday
afternoon and two police officers looking after you!"</p>

<p>"No fear now, sir," Perceval assured him joyously. "With Mary
to look after I doubt whether I shall ever appear in the police
courts again!"</p>

<p>They were gone. The glorious selfishness of youth and love had
engulfed them and they forgot everything but their two selves. In
the study the General sank back into his favourite chair. He
heard their car start off, then the outside sounds seemed to die
away. When Groves returned half an hour later the room was in
darkness. He turned on the light. As he told Harrison, the
General's valet, in the course of the night's gossip, he had the
start of his life, for it seemed to him that it was the General's
ghost that sat in the chair, the ghost of a man who had already
passed through the agonies of death.</p>

<p>"Harrison has prepared your bath, sir," he announced
respectfully. "It is a little after your usual time."</p>

<p>The General rose to his feet. He had faced trouble in his
life. He knew too how to walk proudly through the valley of
humiliation.</p>

<p>"I'm coming at once, Groves," he said. "I had other ideas but
I have changed my mind. I shall be dining at the Club."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story4" name="story4">IV. &mdash; TOO MANY
DUKES</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was the spring sunshine and the tang of a
southwesterly breeze through the open port window which induced
Clara, Baroness Linz, to leave the privacy of Cabine de Luxe
Number Fourteen and mount to the deck. It was perhaps chance
which induced the officious seaman who brought her a chair to
place it next to a solitary young man who was seated gazing
gloomily over the rails towards the receding coastline. It was
without a doubt sheer curiosity which induced Clara to remove for
a moment the coloured glasses which she always wore in the
sunshine to glance at the coronet upon the worn brown leather
dressing case that reposed upon the deck by the side of her
neighbour. She looked away again almost at once and there was no
sign of interest in her face. Nevertheless, what she had seen
provided her with matter for speculation at various periods
during the remainder of the voyage.</p>

<p>"Madame desires a light, perhaps?" the young man asked a few
minutes later, realising that she was in trouble with her
cigarette.</p>

<p>Madame accepted the courtesy and leaned a trifle forward. One
felt that nothing but his innate good breeding kept the
admiration from the young man's eyes when he realised that he was
seated next to a very beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"We shall have a pleasant crossing, I imagine," she remarked
as she thanked him.</p>

<p>"If the fog which threatens does not approach," he agreed.
"The sea is too calm for this time of the year. It is sometimes
deceptive."</p>

<p>The conversation, never thoroughly launched, languished. The
young man, however, appeared also to have developed some instinct
of curiosity. Through his immovable eyeglass he stared at the
label neatly attached to his companion's small jewel case. The
printed letters were clearly visible.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me," he ventured, "but in glancing at your
satchel I discover an address in Adam Street, London."</p>

<p>"That is where I live," Clara acknowledged.</p>

<p>"You will forgive my interest," he continued, "but I am not
well acquainted with your city. To tell you the truth I have been
advised to call upon someone in Adam Street in connection with
the purpose of my visit to London. Perhaps you would be kind
enough to indicate in what direction this Adam Street is
situated."</p>

<p>"You will find it without difficulty," she assured him. "It is
a turning off the street which runs down to the Adelphi Terrace.
Every taxicab driver knows it."</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly obliged," he acknowledged. "I am also," he
added, "somewhat surprised to find that it is also a domiciliary
neighbourhood. The address which I was given in Adam Street was
the address of an enquiry office which I imagined might lie more
in the direction of the City."</p>

<p>She smiled with sufficient indifference.</p>

<p>"The enquiry office you have in mind is doubtless the one
conducted under the name of Advice Limited," she observed.</p>

<p>"It is a famous firm, Madame?" he queried.</p>

<p>"They have an excellent reputation," she replied. Her lack of
curiosity seemed for the moment to intrigue him. He looked at her
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"One imagines, Madame," he remarked, with a slight hesitation,
"that you yourself are not English?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am English by birth, Austrian by marriage, a cosmopolitan
from habit," she told him. "As a place of residence, however, I
prefer London to any other city. But for its climate I should
probably be a permanent resident there."</p>

<p>He shivered as though the idea repelled him. Although the day
was mild he was wearing a heavy, fashionably cut travelling coat
with a band of crape upon the arm. The rest of his attire was
also black&mdash; the meticulous mourning of the bereaved
Frenchman. His cheeks were sallow and inclined to be puffy.</p>

<p>There were lines under his eyes which were not altogether
natural. He had, without doubt, a certain air of distinction but
his appearance was not wholly agreeable.</p>

<p>"You surprise me very much, Madame," he said.</p>

<p>"I should have imagined that Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no Paris," she interrupted. "The circle has shrunk
and shrunk until it has become too small. One cannot breathe in
the atmosphere of the few French people who are left. It is a
beautiful city but it is no part of France."</p>

<p>"There is, alas, truth in what Madame says," the young man
lamented.</p>

<p>"We have, without a doubt, mutual acquaintances in the
Faubourg," she remarked. The young man took up a novel which had
been lying by his side and settled himself further back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt, Madame," he assented courteously, but with
his eyes already seeking the printed page.</p>

<p>Clara stared at him for a moment, permitted herself a faint
unheard gasp and took up her own paper. She had been treated like
an inquisitive and intruding tourist. She had been "put in her
place" by a young man whom she suspected to be one of the
scapegraces of Europe. The humour of the situation, however,
prevailed over its irritation. Presently she rose and strolled
off. The young man read on undisturbed.</p>

<p>A stout dark woman with almost painfully brilliant eyes and
the smudge of a moustache upon her upper lip leaned forward to
her companion as Clara disappeared from sight. She was seated
upon a bench a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur does not trouble himself about the woman," she
remarked. "That one, too, she was beautiful."</p>

<p>"She had also distinction," her companion, a man of the same
type, agreed.</p>

<p>"She possesses an air of familiarity," the formidable looking
lady ruminated. "Somewhere she has been pointed out to me. She
brings into my mind a sense of danger."</p>

<p>The man scrutinised his neighbour calmly. His face was almost
as hard as hers, his deep-set eyes as bright. At first sight they
seemed to be an ordinary bourgeois couple&mdash;probably
tradespeople engaged in a voyage of commerce. Afterwards one
might have been inclined to change one's impressions.</p>

<p>"It is not like you, Hortense," he observed, "to have
ideas."</p>

<p>"If I had no ideas," she scoffed, "we might be living in
another world by now! Henri, my lamb, we move slowly. It is not
that I am nervous but we are surrounded by matters which need
consideration. Walk slowly around the deck, come back to me and
report. Amongst other things I would like to know whether the
beautiful lady has descended."</p>

<p>He grumbled a little but he did her bidding. With his hands
thrust deep down in his overcoat pockets, so deep that he could
feel something hard in the inner recesses of one of them, he made
a complete revolution of the deck. His walk was inclined to be a
strut. His expression was amiable but self-important. More than
ever he looked the prosperous shop-keeper. One could picture him
bowing to a patron from behind the counter of a jeweller's shop,
or standing in welcoming fashion upon the threshold of a
tailoring establishment. One could imagine him seated behind a
desk in an office of prosperous appearance writing
cheques&mdash;good fat cheques&mdash;or with the menu in his hand
at a popular restaurant ordering with care the repast of a
connoisseur with healthy appetite. He had nothing of the air of a
cocktail bar lounger. One could figure him peering at the rich
dishes presented by a respectful maitre d'hotel and criticising
the flavour of a stout bottle of wine.</p>

<p>"Madame," he reported to his companion, "remains at the
farther end of the deck. Monseigneur is apparently engrossed in
his book. Nothing changes."</p>

<p>"And the others&mdash;little Armand and the woman?"</p>

<p>"One believes that they have not mounted."</p>

<p>From far away ahead where the shores of England lay under a
glimmering haze there came the faint shriek of a siren. The woman
puckered her brows and turned around. The man walked to the rail
and came back.</p>

<p>"It is a trifle of mist," he announced. "Fortunately it has
not a serious appearance. We shall have landed before it
spreads."</p>

<p>The woman, notwithstanding her fur coat, shivered.</p>

<p>"Grand Dieu!" she exclaimed. "We spend all our time travelling
northwards. If we could but seek the sun!"</p>

<p><i>"C'est les affaires,"</i> the man muttered. Clara, Baroness
Linz, saw ahead in the distance the grey mists thickening upon
the water and heard behind them the sirens calling. The bells
from the engine room rang and the race of the Channel steamer
through the water was finished. Already they were going at half
speed. With a little grimace she turned round, passed through the
open door and descended the companionway. As she approached the
door of her cabin a stout powerful-looking man, his hands thrust
into his overcoat pockets, the remains of a cigar in his mouth,
stepped aside to allow her to pass. Something about his
appearance struck her as being familiar and she looked at him
with some curiosity. His restless eyes appraised and admired her.
He ogled her shamelessly. There were glimmerings of a smile upon
her lips as she passed into the seclusion of Cabine de Luxe
Number Fourteen. She rang the bell for the steward.</p>

<p>"Would a champagne cocktail be drinkable, Francis?" she asked
him.</p>

<p>He smiled confidently. The Baroness was a well-known and
valued client.</p>

<p>"I will see to it myself, your ladyship," he promised her.
"The last time I left it to the barman. A dry biscuit too?"</p>

<p>She nodded and the man hurried away. She glanced out of the
large square porthole at the thin vaporous fog, examined her face
in the glass and found nothing to correct.</p>

<p>"A dull voyage," she remarked to the man when he returned with
her cocktail.</p>

<p>"Might have been worse, your ladyship," he told her
cheerfully. "We have only just missed the fog. It is coming along
now but a bit too late to do us any harm. I have arranged with
your maid about the baggage."</p>

<p>She nodded, paid her bill and tipped him, as usual,
munificently. Faint little wisps of mist were stealing now and
then through the window. She leaned over to close it but suddenly
paused. She was always a curious woman and she listened. Someone
was speaking in the next cabin.</p>

<p>"Port harbour light on the last train signal. Starboard on the
Castle. Le bon Dieu, what an agony!"</p>

<p>The occupants of that next cabin, Cabine de Luxe Number
Sixteen, appeared to have discovered a new form of amusement. All
the time the woman, bareheaded but with her fur coat fastened
tightly around her, stood at the porthole window muttering to
herself.</p>

<p>"Port harbour light on the last train signal. Starboard on the
Castle. If only Bouvard would hurry!"</p>

<p>The young man, her companion, who had risen from his chair and
was looking over her shoulder, suddenly called out. His delicate
white forefinger with its glittering ring&mdash;platinum with a
green stone&mdash;flashed upwards.</p>

<p>"Bouvard must have failed!" he cried. "Something has happened!
We do not move."</p>

<p>The woman, too, strained forward. It was true. The engines had
either ceased or they had become inaudible. The sea was rippling
gently by the side of the ship below but the curling wisps of
mist had become stationary. The woman leaned farther forward,
beautiful after a certain fashion, with her red hair, her
delicately preserved cream coloured skin, but with the lines of
middle age already asserting themselves. Away in the distance, it
was true, the faint outline of the shore was dimly visible but
straight ahead the curtain had fallen. Barely a hundred yards
distant was a dense wall of fog and behind it nothing but the
screaming of sirens. The young man wiped his forehead. He was
slim, typically Parisian with his elegantly controlled waist, his
carefully draped tie, his closely cropped moustache, his modish
linen and jewellery. He was not of the type, however, which had
fought at Verdun.</p>

<p>Even the sight of that bank of fog seemed to have reduced him
to a state of terror.</p>

<p>"It is the evil one himself who mocks us," he babbled
incoherently. "How shall we be able to see the land? And
Bouvard&mdash;he must have failed us."</p>

<p>The woman threw a scornful glance at him.</p>

<p>"Bouvard does not fail," she said. "He told us to remember
that it would be towards the end when people were gathering
together their belongings. It is just as well that he has not
hastened. They might have searched the cabins."</p>

<p>The young man was in bad shape. He wiped the glistening beads
of perspiration from his forehead with a scented
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"If one could only feel oneself safe on land," he muttered.
"Safe anywhere in London."</p>

<p>"You forget," she reminded him. "We are not going to
London."</p>

<p>He groaned.</p>

<p>"What misery!" he exclaimed. "A grim English hotel&mdash;the
waiting around&mdash;the risk. The game is not worth the candle.
Let us throw this thing overboard," he added, touching a large
but flimsy paper parcel with his foot and upsetting ruthlessly
what seemed to be a plant with stiff green leaves enclosed in a
wicker-work cage. "Let us change cabins."</p>

<p>"And betray Bouvard!" the woman cried contemptuously. "Armand,
you are not a man."</p>

<p>"It is my nerves," he moaned.</p>

<p>"I thought that they might fail you in a crisis,"</p>

<p>she said, and there was a hard light now in her brown eyes.
"But listen. They shall not fail you now or if they do it will be
the end. Drink some more of the brandy. Gain courage somehow.
This is an affair already commenced. There is no drawing back.
The fog will make not so much difference. Sooner or later we must
move and when we do enough will be visible."</p>

<p>The young man drank from the tumbler which stood upon the
table. It contained neat brandy but he drank it greedily.</p>

<p>"You should have been a man, Lucie," he muttered.</p>

<p>"I should have made a better one than you," was the bitter
retort.</p>

<p>He drew himself up but words died upon his lips. There was a
knock at the door, a harsh peremptory summons. The woman crossed
the room, her movements disclosing a curious feline grace. One
might have divined that she was of that breed who love danger for
its own sake.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" she enquired in a tone of unexpected
sweetness. "I have already told the steward that monsieur is
suffering and we do not wish to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"It is Bouvard. Open!" was the sharply spoken rejoinder.</p>

<p>She drew the bolt and opened the door without hesitation. The
stout man who had been strutting about the upper deck stepped in.
He was smoking a freshly lit cigar. His eyes seemed more
brilliant than ever. He had the air of a man engaged in an
enterprise every moment of which brought happiness. The young
man&mdash;there was a Duke's coronet upon his dressing-case but
the name on his passport was Armand de Boncourt&mdash;sank
trembling into a chair. His presence to the other two became for
the moment negligible.</p>

<p>"Success?" the woman asked swiftly.</p>

<p>"It is not Henri Bouvard who fails," he boasted.</p>

<p>"Tell that little rabbit to close the window. It will be time
enough to open it when we are going again. He can busy himself
also with the parcel. The branch of the plant there must be
attached in an upright position to the cork."</p>

<p>The young man was incapable of movement. The woman leaned over
and closed the window.</p>

<p>"I changed my plans," the newcomer continued.</p>

<p>"As usual, luck favoured me. The fog threatened and he and I
were left alone. After that, it was easy. I confess, however,
that I did not reckon upon complete stoppage. My fear is that
Challes will find time now for action. If so and he has word with
the Captain there may be a search before we proceed. I ask myself
what is best."</p>

<p>The man's words were alarming enough in their suggestion. The
woman, however, merely reflected.</p>

<p>"What have you done with&mdash;with it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The dressing-case I disposed of through the porthole in the
lavatory," he replied. "It will not be easily found. The box is
here."</p>

<p>It appeared that Monsieur Bouvard's corpulence was not
altogether a substantial thing for from underneath his two coats
he produced a very sizable looking though flat tin box. It was no
sooner in the woman's hands than she commenced to wrap it up in a
piece of matting which had lain upon the table.</p>

<p>"The immediate trouble might be," she said, listening to
footsteps outside, "if anyone insists upon entering. What would
two wealthy passengers in a Cabine de Luxe want with a thing like
that?"</p>

<p>She pointed contemptuously to the untidy looking bundle. The
man stroked his chin thoughtfully. For a single moment his
confidence seemed to waver.</p>

<p>"It was such a wonderful scheme too," he reflected.</p>

<p>"Imbecile!" she exclaimed furiously. "You men grow more lache
every day. I am sorry that I spoke. There is poor little Armand
shivering with what he calls nerves. What is that indeed but rank
cowardice? Here are you, even you, deliberating&mdash;Zut! Je me
fiche de vous deux! We take our risks. We stay as we are, Henri,
until the engines beat again and we carry out our plans exactly
as they were made. See here."</p>

<p>She picked up a tumbler and half filled it with brandy from
the bottle which stood upon the table. Bouvard accepted it with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"I drink to you, my beautiful," he said. "It is not courage I
need. I pause only to reflect upon what is best. Some day, mark
you, I shall take you away from this little rabbit. You please
me. Madame and I have squabbled for long enough."</p>

<p>He leaned towards her and put his arm around her shoulders.
She gave him her lips without hesitation.</p>

<p>"So," he said with a deep sigh. "I shall take you like this
when the time comes and the little rabbit there can do what he
pleases. Once more&mdash;success!"</p>

<p>He drank from the tumbler. She followed his example with a
laugh. This, after all, was the sort of man she understood.</p>

<p>The young man, ushered in by the saturnine-looking butler,
entered Clara's charming little sitting room with a bow and stood
with his hat in his hand. He was obviously very much shaken but a
young man with precise manners.</p>

<p>"I wish," he confided, "an immediate interview with the
principal of your firm. You have my card. I am the Duc de
Challes."</p>

<p>Clara, who was wearing heavy spectacles and had established
herself with her back to the light, waved him to a chair.</p>

<p>"To all effects and purposes, Duke," she told him, "you can
look upon me as the head of the firm."</p>

<p>The young man frowned slightly.</p>

<p>"Mine is not a trivial affair," he warned her. "It is an
affair which demands the immediate attention of the best brains
in your organisation. It is of great importance and it would
surely save time if I were allowed to state my own case."</p>

<p>"We have our methods," Clara rejoined smiling, "and please
forgive my assuring you that they cannot be changed. You must
explain the business to me."</p>

<p>The young man recognised finality and took a chair.</p>

<p>"I was robbed yesterday afternoon," he announced, "of half a
million pounds' worth of jewels on the steamboat between Calais
and Dover."</p>

<p>Clara inclined her head sympathetically.</p>

<p>"There were rumours of a great theft in the papers this
morning," she murmured. "I have heard no particulars."</p>

<p>"The particulars are simple," the Duke explained.</p>

<p>"I inherited these jewels from my aunt, the late head of our
house. They were handed over to me as my inheritance by the
lawyers on Monday. I was to bring them to London at once to have
them displayed at your great salesrooms&mdash;Messrs. Christie's.
During the crossing from Calais to Dover they were stolen."</p>

<p>"In what fashion?"</p>

<p>"I was seated on deck," the Duke continued, "with my small
articles of luggage&mdash;including a bag which contained the
jewels&mdash;by my side. We ran into a mist and nearly all the
other passengers descended to the saloon. I was suddenly attacked
from behind and received a severe blow on the head. I try to put
this in as few words as possible. The end was this. I did not see
my assailant to recognise him. When I recovered my breath and my
head ceased to swim the bag containing the jewels had gone and I
was alone."</p>

<p>"Very simple so far," Clara observed. "Exactly what did you do
when you discovered your loss?"</p>

<p>"We were in the middle of a bank of mist and they refused to
permit me to speak to the Captain. The Purser, however, promised
that no one should be allowed to leave the boat at Dover until
they had passed through the customs and that a rigorous search
should be made through everyone's hand baggage. I was obliged to
be content with this. The search was made without result. There
was no trace of the jewels."</p>

<p>"Did you enter into communication in any way with the Dover
Police?" she enquired. "They have the reputation of being a very
clever force."</p>

<p>"Five minutes after the Purser had told me that the search had
been in vain and that he could detain the passengers no longer I
left my own luggage in the care of my servant and went to the
Police Station," the Duke recounted. "I found the Chief of the
Police most intelligent. He told me that there had been one or
two cases in his time of thefts on board steamers and
the&mdash;how is it you call it?&mdash;the booty thrown overboard
in something which would float and returned for afterwards.
Accordingly, I hired a motor boat and went out, as near as I
could possibly guess, to the spot where I was attacked. It was
still misty but after about an hour's search we found my
dressing-case empty and the box which had contained the jewels
attached to the wicker cage of a lobster pot&mdash;also
empty."</p>

<p>"Indicating," Clara reflected, "the fact that the jewels had
probably been thrown overboard attached in some fashion to this
wicker basket and the thieves, or their accomplices, had been
lying in wait in a motor boat."</p>

<p>"It is possible," the Duke admitted. "Through the mist we
could hear at times the hooting of a siren. The police are
keeping a strict watch along the coast for any motor boat that
might have been concerned."</p>

<p>Clara, who was deeply interested, leaned across towards her
visitor.</p>

<p>"Was there anyone on board who to your knowledge was aware of
the fact that you were taking the jewels across?"</p>

<p>The Duke hesitated.</p>

<p>"There was a relative of mine," he acknowledged, "a young man,
very feeble in his head and anaemic, who probably knew. We do not
converse. There was, however, some question of his having a claim
to the succession. French law is, as you may be aware, peculiar
and one of the reasons why my aunt transferred her property into
jewels and insisted upon them being hastened into my possession
on the day of her death was her fear that my cousin Armand might
successfully contest my claim. She was a woman of spirit and she
had a great contempt for Armand."</p>

<p>"He was on the boat, was he?" Clara meditated.</p>

<p>"He was on the boat, but it would be the height of absurdity
to suggest that he could have come up and given me a blow on the
head sufficient to make me half unconscious. He would never have
had the courage or the strength for such an exploit."</p>

<p>"He may have had an accomplice," she suggested. The Duke
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Whoever it may have been who was responsible for the
conspiracy, my cousin would have been quite capable of it if
someone else did the work and ran the risk. How did they dispose
of the jewels? That is what I want to know."</p>

<p>"I will study the facts," Clara promised, "and report to you
to-morrow. You are staying in London?"</p>

<p>"At Claridge's Hotel," was the somewhat gloomy reply. "I hope
you will bear in mind the fact that with every minute which
passes the chances of escape on the part of the criminals become
more favourable."</p>

<p>"I shall not waste time," she assured him.</p>

<p>"In this case," Clara reflected, as she mounted the gangway of
the channel steamer upon its return journey, "Scotland Yard has
the facts, I have the ideas! I wonder!"</p>

<p>The first half-hour upon the boat was one of disappointment to
Clara, Baroness Linz. There was no one amongst the passengers who
resembled anyone she had ever seen before. She had better
fortune, however, when she descended to the cabins. Walking up
and down the corridor the picture of misery and despair was the
elegant but dissipated young man who had occupied Cabine de Luxe
Number Sixteen with the flamboyant looking lady of the previous
crossing! He appeared to be in the depths of depression and also
in the throes of a nervous attack. His china blue eyes were
bloodshot, the cigarette he was attempting to smoke hung limply
from his twitching lips. Nevertheless, from sheer habitude, he
watched with obvious admiration the approach of a very beautiful
woman. Clara, as she entered her cabin, looked over her shoulder
and smiled....</p>

<p>The voyage had commenced. Already they were passing out of the
harbour. Clara threw off her furs and made herself comfortable
upon the lounge. She had left the door ajar and she noticed with
satisfaction that the footsteps outside had ceased. Presently
there was a timid tapping. The door was pushed an inch or two
wider open. The young man&mdash; a very timid
boulevardier&mdash;peered in.</p>

<p>"Come in," she invited pleasantly. "You were in the next cabin
yesterday, were you not? You have had as short a stay in England
as I have."</p>

<p>She swung round and made room for him by her side. He bowed
and accepted her invitation. Clara became aware of an
overwhelming waft of perfume irresistibly reminiscent of the Rue
de la Paix. The young man with delicate white fingers toyed with
the pearl which held in its place a mauve tie of rich silk.</p>

<p>"I remember Madame, of course," he acknowledged. "No one who
had seen her could fail to do so."</p>

<p>"Are you going to pay me compliments?" she laughed. "The
voyage then will be so much the shorter." *</p>

<p>"Alas," he sighed, "my heart is full of much that I would say
but I am in terrible despair."</p>

<p>She looked at him with exquisitely simulated interest.</p>

<p>"You distress me," she said. "Despair? It is not possible,"
she added, as though the idea had suddenly occurred to her, "that
you are connected in any way with the jewel robbery which took
place yesterday?"</p>

<p>Once more he sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Alas, Madame," he admitted, "I am the victim."</p>

<p>"You?" she exclaimed. "I thought that the jewels belonged to
the Duc de Challes."</p>

<p>He coughed. He had perhaps been indiscreet.</p>

<p>"I am the Duc de Challes," he announced boldly.</p>

<p>"You surprise me," Clara confessed. "The Duc de Challes was
pointed out to me upon the boat. He had not the appearance or
presence of Monsieur, although he was taller. He was, too, of a
different complexion."</p>

<p>"That was my cousin," the young man confided bitterly. "He
calls himself the Duc de Challes although the title is by right
mine. He helped himself to the jewels which were also mine.
Through his carelessness they are lost. I am ruined. Madame,
there has been treachery somewhere!"</p>

<p>"What you are telling me," she reflected, "seems very strange.
Do I understand that you both call yourselves the Duc de
Challes?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"During my aunt's lifetime," he said, "I humoured her whims. I
called myself the Marquis de Boncourt, which is one of our minor
titles."</p>

<p>"One understands, however," Clara continued, with an air of
sympathetic interest, "that it was from your cousin that the
jewels were stolen."</p>

<p>The young man coughed. It was perhaps borne upon him faintly
that he was talking too much. The eyes of Madame, however, were
so delightfully sympathetic!</p>

<p>"It is a complicated story," he explained. "I followed my
cousin on to the boat. It was my intention to have taken him by
the throat and to have demanded the return of my property. Before
I could find an opportunity of doing so, however, the theft took
place. The jewels have gone! Worse than that, I&mdash;the Marquis
de Boncourt, to whom they justly belonged&mdash;am a pauper!"</p>

<p>"It is all very confusing," Clara acknowledged. The young man
sighed. He was gazing out of the porthole. Once more he was
fingering his beautiful mauve tie.</p>

<p>"If one had the courage," he murmured. "If I dared, Madame,
what happiness it would give me to tell you the story."</p>

<p>"I would love to hear it," she admitted.</p>

<p>"The details&mdash;no," he began after a moment's reflection.
"Madame can imagine them for herself. I came on board yesterday
with a friend&mdash;no, not a friend&mdash;a tradesman of the
bourgeois class who has acted as my banker for years. We were
firmly determined to possess ourselves of my property. I have
been a soldier, Madame, and I knew how to deal with a crisis. We
confronted my cousin with his treachery and we took from him the
box containing the jewels."</p>

<p>"That was heroic!" Clara exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Then came the question," the Marquis went on, encouraged by
the admiration in those beautiful hazel eyes, "how to conceal the
property until we could prove our rights in the courts. My
companion had arranged for that. It was a triumph of ingenuity.
At a certain spot the case containing the jewels was thrown
overboard in a wicker basket. We had men in a motor boat lying in
wait. The thing was done&mdash;a magnificent exploit. We
congratulated ourselves. Alas, we were too previous. My cousin
had been too cunning. The case was discovered. The box opened. It
contained a little sand and a few pebbles! My cousin was on his
way to London with the jewels. He was safe from the law and from
our pursuit."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Marquis," Clara argued, "there was a robbery.
The Duc de Challes has sworn that the jewels were in the case
which was taken from him."</p>

<p>The young man's lower jaw dropped, his face was almost
pitiable in its vanity. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"That is my cousin's bluff," he declared. "He had the jewels
with him when he left the Chateau. The case was empty when we
took it from him. He disposed of them elsewhere."</p>

<p>"You poor man," Clara sighed. "Tell me&mdash;where is your
friend now?"</p>

<p>The Marquis indulged in a silent but expressive gesture.</p>

<p>"That I must not say. He is afraid of the police. Our attempt
was an illegal one. It was my own property we tried to regain but
I too am in some danger."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, where is he?" Clara persisted. "Somehow I have
an idea he is not far away. Is he?"</p>

<p>The Marquis' expression was like that of a distressed and
tortured child.</p>

<p>"I must not tell you about him. I have sworn that I will not
open my lips. He was seen by more than one person with the case.
They would never believe that he had not the jewels."</p>

<p>"I suppose," Clara reflected, "you have every confidence in
your banker friend?"</p>

<p>"Why should I not have confidence? It is to his interest as
well as mine to recover the jewels. With them in my possession my
debts to him will be paid. Without them I am penniless."</p>

<p>She sighed once more.</p>

<p>"If only I could help you," she lamented. "And
listen&mdash;come a little nearer to me&mdash;/ believe that I
could."</p>

<p>He was under the spell of the light in her beautiful eyes, the
slight quiver in her tone. Never in all his career of gallantry
had such a thing happened to him with a woman so marvellous, so
responsive.</p>

<p>"There is a way to help you," she confided. "You have courage,
I know."</p>

<p>"Tell me," he begged.</p>

<p>"Tell me where your friend is," she whispered.</p>

<p>"He is in the next cabin," the Marquis replied. "Locked in. He
would not even have me there with him. Furthermore&mdash;he is
disguised."</p>

<p>She patted his hand.</p>

<p>"You will trust me?"</p>

<p>He drew a little nearer. She avoided what was after all only a
timorous attempt at an embrace.</p>

<p>"Always, beloved," he murmured. "But first&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again she eluded him with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"They have told me that you are a dangerous person, Marquis,"
she said. "Even with a fortune at stake you show yourself a man
of gallantry. But wait. The jewels first."</p>

<p>"The jewels first," he repeated in a mesmerised tone.</p>

<p>She rang the bell. Her friend the steward presently appeared.
She drew him on one side. With a little nod and a gesture to the
Marquis she stepped out in to the corridor.</p>

<p>"Steward," she demanded, "who is in the next cabin?"</p>

<p>The man's face fell. He was evidently perturbed.</p>

<p>"Madame," he replied, "his name is Fontany but I know no more
about him."</p>

<p>She shook her head gently but reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You are an honest man, Grayson," she said. "You do not wish
to get into trouble? You do not wish to shield a thief?"</p>

<p>"Not for one moment, Madame," was the indignant answer.</p>

<p>"Then trust me," she insisted. "Fetch me the Purser as quickly
as you can and tell him to bring two of the officers who have
some courage. Tell him if he does this there may be a very
pleasant surprise for him."</p>

<p>The steward's face was a study in expressions.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the truth, your ladyship," he confessed. "The
man who is alone in the next stateroom has given me five pounds
to see that he is not disturbed before we reach Calais. He has
promised me another ten pounds when we arrive there."</p>

<p>She shook her head again, then leaned across to him and
whispered in his ear. He sped away with a little gasp. Clara Linz
returned to her seat upon the lounge. And here the young man
welcomed her petulantly.</p>

<p>"You leave me alone," he complained, "and we have arranged
nothing. You will travel to Paris with me&mdash;yes? I will
arrange for a coup&eacute;."</p>

<p>"What about your friend in the next cabin?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He does not wish to be seen with me," the Marquis assured
her. "He is afraid that we might be recognised. Although there
was nothing in it we took the dressing case away from my cousin.
There might be trouble."</p>

<p>"And the lady with the beautiful hair who was your companion?"
Clara asked with a very creditable simulation of jealousy.</p>

<p>"She went to Folkestone to return by the other route to
Boulogne," he explained. "Bouvard thought that it was better. For
myself I am not afraid," the Marquis went on with a show of
courage. "I try to recover from a relative my own property. It is
a man's natural impulse. With Bouvard it is different."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose," she asked, "he is doing in there alone
and with the door locked?"</p>

<p>"He is a very excitable person," the Marquis confided. "The
anxiety has brought on an attack of seasickness."</p>

<p>There were steps in the corridor. The farce was coming to an
end.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why not?" the Marquis demanded. "He is my good friend. It is
he who has financed me since the banks have been difficult."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. In response to Clara's
invitation to enter the Purser and two of the ship's officers
were disclosed upon the threshold. She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown," she said, addressing the Purser, "there is a man
locked up in the next cabin who I believe stole the jewels
belonging to the Duc de Challes. Furthermore, I believe that he
has the jewels with him."</p>

<p>The Purser's eyes glittered.</p>

<p>"Baroness!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They all swung out on to the corridor. The Marquis had an
attack of nerves. He was calling out feebly and trying to attach
himself to Clara. The Purser knocked at the door of stateroom
Number Sixteen. There was at first no reply. Then a very weak
voice was heard.</p>

<p>"Who is that? Go away. I am ill. I have the <i>mal-de-
mer</i>."</p>

<p>The Purser wasted no more time. He drew from his pocket a
pass-key and fitted it into the lock. He threw open the door. A
man, who was lying upon the couch, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this intrusion?" he demanded, and his
voice was suddenly strong. The Purser looked round the room
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I see no trace of seasickness," he remarked.</p>

<p>"This is my reserved cabin for which I have paid," Bouvard
exclaimed angrily. "I demand to be left alone."</p>

<p>"I should like to point out to you, Mr. Brown," Clara said
with a sudden inspiration, "that this man crossed yesterday on
the boat from which the jewels were stolen under the name of
Bouvard. He has engaged this cabin under the name of Fontany! He
was a stout man then with a black moustache. Look at him now! He
has shaved off the moustache and got rid of his false front."</p>

<p>"But this is ridiculous!" Bouvard shouted.</p>

<p>"Take my advice," Clara begged. "Search the cabin."</p>

<p>The Purser, one of the officers and the steward set about
their task. The other officer stood over the man upon the lounge.
The latter, with a shrug of the shoulders, appeared to have
resigned himself.</p>

<p>"For what you search I do not know," he said.</p>

<p>"I have shaved my moustache because it pleased me. I do not
break the law when I do that. You may look through my belongings.
If you will you may search me. I do not know what it is you are
looking for but I am not a thief...."</p>

<p>At the expiration of a quarter of an hour things began to look
a little awkward. The carpet had been torn up and the boards
tested. The lounge had been thoroughly examined and the two
chairs dismantled. The Purser was distinctly uneasy. Clara
herself was puzzled. Suddenly inspiration again befriended her.
She pointed towards the lavatory basin.</p>

<p>"What is that lying by the side of the nailbrush?" she
asked.</p>

<p>The Purser picked it up.</p>

<p>"It appears to be a screw-driver," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Belong to you, Adams?" he asked the steward.</p>

<p>"Never saw it before, sir," the man replied. "I don't know how
it got there."</p>

<p>"See if it fits the screws which hold the bowl in place,"
Clara suggested.</p>

<p>The steward went on his knees and made an effort. Clara
smiled. She was spared the catastrophe of failure! They all
stooped down. One by one the screws were withdrawn. The Purser
pulled forward the lead pipe and bent it over. A little shower of
jewels fell on to the floor!</p>

<p>"Don't you see what he has done?" he pointed out.</p>

<p>"He has opened the pipe at the other end, put in some sort of
an obstacle, rescrewed the pipe at the top and there he has the
most complete hiding place anyone could imagine."</p>

<p>"Purser, I suggest that you have the pipe carefully removed,"
Clara directed. "As for the jewels&mdash; I claim them on behalf
of the Duc de Challes for whom I am acting."</p>

<p>Henri Bouvard's shouts filled the cabin. He tried to fight his
way out but he was easily overpowered. He might, perhaps, have
slipped away but he shrank back trembling before the revolver
which the Marquis was pointing at him in unsteady fashion.</p>

<p>"The jewels were there after all, Bouvard!" the latter called
out. "You have deceived me! It was you who secured the
jewels!"</p>

<p>"For your sake, you puppy!" the other bellowed.</p>

<p><i>"Je m'en doute,"</i> the Marquis sneered.</p>

<p>"The whole affair," Clara pointed out, "is quite clear. This
man Bouvard double-crossed his companion, who I daresay may be a
cousin of the Duc de Challes, and who may think that the jewels
are his. He reported failure having achieved success. You will
take care of the jewels, Mr. Brown. So far as I am concerned the
affair is over."</p>

<p>The Duc de Challes, who had already received the welcome news,
presented himself at midday on the following morning in Adam
Street. He was received as before by Clara, Baroness Linz.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said gratefully, "I extend to the firm of Advice
Limited my sincere thanks and my hearty congratulations. I have
here your fee of a thousand guineas."</p>

<p>He laid a cheque upon the table and looked more curiously than
ever at his companion.</p>

<p>"I can scarcely be blamed now," he continued, "If I insist
upon an introduction to your principal."</p>

<p>Clara pulled up the blind and removed her spectacles. That
intriguing smile which had captivated him for a moment upon the
boat had returned. He stared and took up his hat. Then he
laughed. He was a man of the world and he understood very well
how to mind his own business.</p>

<p>"I shall drink a toast to-night," he promised, "to the
continued success of Advice Limited."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story5" name="story5">V. &mdash; THE RITZ HOTEL
CONFERENCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">FOUR of the guests remained in their places
around the table upon which the interrupted feast had been
spread. Two others, a man and a woman, were leaning over the
couch, at the further end of the room, on which a sixth man was
lying, his eyes closed, his complexion ghastly. Stretched out at
full length, he seemed to be slim and unusually tall. The woman
straightened herself and looked across the table.</p>

<p>"It works!" she exclaimed breathlessly. "Malcolm's wonderful
drug has done everything he promised."</p>

<p>One of the four silent figures pushed back his chair and rose
to his feet. He was short and rather stout and the illustrated
newspapers of the world had taken care that his were familiar
features.</p>

<p>"Even Malcolm," he said gruffly, "could not tell us how long
the effect would last. Let us get the thing over."</p>

<p>He crossed the room towards a large writing table, picked up a
weighty looking document and made his way to the sofa. The woman,
in obedience to his gesture, held the document; the man who had
brought it produced a fountain pen, lifted the limp hand of the
unconscious man and wrapped his fingers around it.</p>

<p>The action brought its own gruesome suggestions and the woman
closed her eyes for a moment. Her companion addressed her almost
roughly.</p>

<p>"Hold the agreement firmly with both hands," he enjoined.
"Mind it doesn't slip. Surely you are not frightened of an
unconscious man?"</p>

<p>She recovered herself and did as she was told. Her fellow
conspirator, still gripping in his large hand the nerveless
fingers, brought the nib of the fountain pen on to a certain
pencilled space upon the document and traced in a certain famous
signature. Then he drew back with a little chuckle of
content.</p>

<p>"Europe is saved," he declared triumphantly. "Nelson has
signed!"</p>

<p>He carried the document across to the table and poured himself
out a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"I shall drink to the great chemist who is Lady Hannah's
friend," he declared. "I shall drink also to the brain that
conceived the idea&mdash;yours, Lady Hannah. It sounded like
moonshine melodrama but it has worked. Every one of us can swear
that we saw Nelson sign."</p>

<p>"He might tell the truth and repudiate his signature," one of
the others at the table suggested.</p>

<p>The man who had guided the pen smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>"We must take that risk," he admitted, "but is he likely to do
anything of the sort? Everyone knows that Nelson is fond of his
glass of wine. Who would believe a cock-and-bull story of his
having been drugged? If he signed it without knowing what he was
doing then everyone will believe that he was drunk. He will not
ask for that."</p>

<p>Lady Hannah's first companion, who had been kneeling all the
time by the other side of the unconscious figure upon the couch,
rose suddenly to his feet. There was a wild gleam in his eyes, a
note of horror in his tone.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be in a hurry to drink that toast," he warned
them all. "Do you know what has happened?"</p>

<p>"The agreement is signed," the man who had just filled his
glass replied triumphantly.</p>

<p>"And Nelson is dead!" the other groaned.</p>

<p>Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!</p>

<p>A ring at the front door bell awakening strange echoes in the
empty building!</p>

<p>Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!</p>

<p>Another ring at the bell!</p>

<p>Clara, Baroness Linz, threw off the coverlet, sat up for a
moment or two to listen, swung out of bed and wrapped herself in
a peignoir. She opened the window and, leaning out, looked down
into Adam Street.</p>

<p>"What on earth do you want?" she demanded of the young man
who, for the third time, was pressing the bell.</p>

<p>He stepped a little farther back to get a better view of his
questioner, removed his silk hat with a sweep and bowed. There
was something in the grace of his gesture and still more in his
tone when he spoke which convinced Clara that her would-be
visitor was a foreigner.</p>

<p>"I address myself perhaps," he said, "to the Baroness
Linz."</p>

<p>"You do," she admitted severely. "But why you are walking up
and down outside there and ringing my bell at this hour of the
night I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"I regret," he answered, with a fervent note of apology in his
tone. "If your telephone had been in working order you would have
been warned of my visit."</p>

<p>"My telephone is all right."</p>

<p>"But I can assure you that it is not," was the courteously
spoken rejoinder. "If you doubt my word try it for yourself.
Acquaintances of yours have rung up this evening in vain. At last
it was decided that I must come and fetch you."</p>

<p>"What absolute nonsense you are talking!" she exclaimed.
"Fetch me where?"</p>

<p>"It is difficult to explain," the young man pointed out, "when
I am standing upon the pavement and you are two stories above me.
I take the liberty of suggesting that you either come down or
permit me to mount."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," was the angry reply. "Who
are you and what do you mean by disturbing people at this hour of
the night?"</p>

<p>"It is only eleven o'clock," the young man below
remonstrated.</p>

<p>Clara reflected for a moment. Her visitor was probably right.
She had gone to bed, being all alone, at something after half-
past nine and the extension between the telephone instrument
which stood by her bedside and the instrument in the back office
was, she knew, out of order. She looked at him with growing
curiosity. He was young, and was dressed in the precise evening
clothes of the period, he wore his silk hat at the correct angle,
but from his dusky complexion and slight accent she was convinced
that he was a foreigner. By the side of the kerbstone was drawn
up a very beautiful two-seater car.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible," she pointed out, "for me to continue
a discussion with you like this. I have gone to bed and there is
no one else in the building. I could not, therefore, let you in
nor could I think of coming downstairs. Go away, please, and come
back at some civilised hour if you want to see me or if you have
any message to give me."</p>

<p>"Alas, Baroness," he replied, "all that you say demands an
apology, which I offer freely, but the fact remains that the
matter is urgent. It would be better if you would resume your
ordinary attire"&mdash;he paused for a moment as though to study
her very attractive blue peignoir with a touch of white fur
around the neck "&mdash;and come down to me. I can then take you
to the place where your presence is desired."</p>

<p>"But who is it that wants me?" she demanded. "How dare you
expect me to come out with you to some unknown people on some
unknown errand at this time of night?"</p>

<p>He set his foot on the palisading which supported the railings
and, leaning forward, lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"You are the Baroness Clara Linz," he said. "You call yourself
on the doorplate and elsewhere 'Advice Limited'. Is that not
so?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You give counsel to men and women who are in trouble or
perplexity. That situation has arisen in a private salon of the
Ritz Hotel. We have arrived at an impasse. We telephoned for you
in vain. It was then suggested that I should fetch you."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" Clara insisted, sinking into a chair which
she had drawn up to the window. "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Is it important?" he asked. "You may know me by my first
name. I am generally called Roderigo."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" she scoffed. "In any case, respectable young men
don't go wandering about at this hour of the night with
incomprehensible messages to ladies with whom they have no
acquaintance."</p>

<p>The young man in question sighed.</p>

<p>"It is my hard fortune to be in that position," he confided
mournfully.</p>

<p>"No more nonsense, please," she begged. "We shall have the
police from the Terrace round here directly. What is your full
name?"</p>

<p>"If you insist you shall hear the worst," was the gentle
reply. "I am the Duque Roderigo de Partagena de Cervera y
Topete."</p>

<p>The Baroness leaned a little further out of the window.</p>

<p>"It sounds intriguing," she confessed. "I must see more of
you."</p>

<p>"That is my own wish," he assured her. "I only beg that you
will descend. It is an undignified position for me this.
Notwithstanding my formal costume I might be mistaken by an
unintelligent police officer for a troubadour or a would-be
burglar at any moment."</p>

<p>"You are very fond of talking," she observed.</p>

<p>"You are a charming and appreciative listener," he
rejoined.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Clara found herself laughing
softly. Without a doubt the young man had charm.</p>

<p>"Who is it that has sent for me?" she asked. "And what do they
want?"</p>

<p>"Our little party at the Ritz," he told her eagerly, "consists
of five people&mdash;two of whom are known to you. I was told to
mention no names but, as I am finding my mission so difficult, I
will go so far as to tell you that Lady Hannah Phillipson is one
of them. You are acquainted with her, I believe."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Lady Hannah has sent you here for me
at this hour of the night?"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," her visitor pleaded, "'this hour of the
night' conveys altogether a false impression. It may be perhaps a
quarter past eleven. We only sat down to our Conference an hour
ago. Who in the world would have expected to find a very modern
human being asleep in an empty building with a broken telephone
at such an hour?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," Clara decided after a moment's reflection,
"perhaps you are right. By-the-by, tell me this&mdash;what
coloured gown is Lady Hannah wearing?"</p>

<p>"Of what significance it may be I do not know," was the
puzzled reply, "but I happen to remember that she is wearing a
gown of a shade which I would describe as between yellow and
orange colour."</p>

<p>His listener nodded.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," she admitted. "I had a cocktail with
her and a friend at the Embassy at half-past eight. Now I come to
think of it she did tell me that she was going to a queer sort of
party at the Ritz."</p>

<p>The Duke below bowed.</p>

<p>"Including your prospective cavalier," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I suppose, under the circumstances, I had better come," Clara
decided. "It will take me ten minutes to get ready."</p>

<p>"I will smoke a cigarette and attend you with impatience," the
young man announced, removing his foot at once on to the
pavement.</p>

<p>Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! Slither! Slither! Slither!</p>

<p>Outside in the street the man who waited for her was obviously
unable to conceal his impatience. He walked up and down
unceasingly until Clara began to hate the sound of his smooth-
soled patent shoes as they fell upon the pavement. She herself,
with no clothes laid out, dressed swiftly but with many minor
difficulties. Her hair, always a baffling proposition, troubled
her. Finally, however, she was ready. She wrapped an evening
cloak around herself, descended to the street, opened and locked
the door behind her. Her escort handed her into the car with a
little murmur of welcome which sounded suspiciously like a
groan.</p>

<p>"Have I been long?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There are times," he answered, "when even the seconds
crawl."</p>

<p>At close quarters she looked at him critically. The white-
gloved fingers grasping the polished wheel struck her as being
somewhat effeminate. The set of his tie and the perfection of the
small details of his clothes were almost meticulous in their
correctness. Yet there was something, too, of the man about him.
His dusky complexion, she saw now, was chiefly the tan of an
open-air life. His eyes were blue, he was lean about the cheeks
and the lines of his mouth were unwavering.</p>

<p>"We are going to the Ritz?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"Or eternity," he replied, as he flashed past an omnibus. "I
hoped we should get back before the theatres were over."</p>

<p>"I did my best," she murmured. "As a matter of fact very few
of them are out yet."</p>

<p>They circled Leicester Square and, ignoring the side streets,
shot across into Piccadilly.</p>

<p>"When we reach the Ritz," she ventured, "precisely what are
you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"You will make one of an informal dinner party," the Duke
confided. "There has been some little trouble which has left us
all confused. We need the advice of someone who was not present
when a certain incident occurred. It was Lady Hannah who thought
of sending for you."</p>

<p>"And you were the unwilling messenger?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Baroness," he replied with a sigh of relief as he saw the
empty road ahead and the bending line of lights, "how could I
tell what was in store for me? I have never before met an
intelligent woman who was also beautiful."</p>

<p>"You chose your nationality ill," she remarked drily. "Of what
race are you?"</p>

<p>He raised his dark eyebrows slightly. She admired him for the
fact that his eyes had never for a second left the strip of road
along which he was making his illegally rapid progress. He had
not once looked at her.</p>

<p>"Such is fame!" he murmured, evading her question.</p>

<p>They turned into Arlington Street. With a twist of the wrist
he brought the car to a standstill a little below the main
entrance. A chauffeur in plain black livery hurried forward and
opened a door a few yards down the street. Clara's companion led
her across an obscure yard into the hotel by a side entrance and
handed her into an automatic lift, and they ascended to the
second floor. A few yards of passage and they were in the main
corridor.</p>

<p>"My task is over," he whispered, as he pressed the bell of one
of the suites. "It is to be hoped that we are in time."</p>

<p>At a round table in the very beautiful salon of the Royal
Suite were seated four men, all of them complete strangers to the
Baroness, and her friend Lady Hannah Phillipson, who was the
daughter and also the private secretary to a Cabinet Minister.
There were besides three unoccupied places&mdash;one apparently
belonging to Clara's escort, for he made his way deliberately
towards it, another which Clara herself was invited to occupy and
a third which had the appearance of having been occupied and
abandoned in haste Lady Hannah, who had directed her to her
chair&mdash;a brilliant young woman as a rule&mdash;was looking
like a ghost, her face white and drawn.</p>

<p>"Glad you could come, dear," she said in an odd jerky tone.
"We are having an irregular sort of feast instead of dinner as
the men have been discussing affairs of some importance. You will
have to excuse introductions. This is not exactly a social
gathering. Roderigo, you have been looking after the Baroness for
so long, go and fetch her something from the sideboard and give
her some champagne and a sandwich. I am afraid we cannot allow
her time for more."</p>

<p>The four men&mdash;three of them obviously
foreigners&mdash;had risen to their feet and each in turn bowed
solemnly towards the newcomer, who returned their greeting in a
silence which matched their own. It was a curious thing but,
strangers though they were, there was something familiar about
the face of every one of them. It was certainly, she reflected,
as she ate her sandwich and sipped her wine, no ordinary party
which she had been invited to join.... The conversation, which
had been interrupted at her entrance, began to flow around her.
They were discussing Epstein in an indifferent and almost
perfunctory fashion and as it was a subject upon which Clara
herself had decided but unpopular views she devoted herself
entirely to her late escort.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary thing appetite is," she remarked. "I
went to bed at half past nine to-night deciding that I didn't
want any dinner because it was too much trouble to do anything
about it, and here I am eating a large sandwich and looking
greedily every now and then at the sideboard!"</p>

<p>The young man took the hint, rose to his feet and brought her
a further supply. Clara, with a sigh of content, ignored Epstein
and continued to talk to her companion. Suddenly she lowered her
voice.</p>

<p>"Is there any harm in my asking who all these strange people
are?" she enquired. "Except that their faces seem familiar I am
sure I have never spoken to one of them before in my life."</p>

<p>"Those illustrated papers!" her neighbour sighed.</p>

<p>"You certainly have the right to know, Baroness, or we could
scarcely hope to benefit by this wonderful insight you are
reputed to possess. The elderly man with the grey moustache and
the eyeglass next to Lady Hannah is Baron Strengler, the German
Minister of Finance."</p>

<p>"One of the Conference now sitting in London," she
murmured.</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>"The obvious Frenchman on the other side of the table," he
indicated, "is Francois Latourne. He is the French Minister of
Finance as, of course, you know. Some day he will be
Premier."</p>

<p>"Another member of the Conference," Clara exclaimed in growing
excitement.... "Now tell me what your place is amongst this
remarkable crowd?"</p>

<p>"I am private secretary to Baron Strengler," he confided, "and
confidential interpreter. You may pass me over as being of little
account. The disordered place on your right was occupied by a
guest who left us hurriedly. On the other side of Lady Hannah you
surely recognise Mr. James Mortimer. He is the American banker
who buys and sells kingdoms. The other man to your right is Lord
Bradley. He is the man who they all say would like to become
Dictator of Great Britain. One thing is very certain&mdash;if
this present Conference is successful he will be your next
Chancellor of the Exchequer."</p>

<p>"Will it be successful?" she asked eagerly. "The late editions
to-night spoke of great difficulties&mdash;the Bank of
England&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One cannot tell," the Duke interrupted nervously.</p>

<p>"It depends on how a certain little matter is arranged."</p>

<p>"You are a very impressive gathering," Clara observed, as she
leaned back and sipped her wine.</p>

<p>"What puzzles me is what on earth I am doing here? You
bewildered and almost terrified me when you walked the pavement
outside my rather lonely dwelling and insisted on bringing me
here. Now that I have arrived, if I am not exactly so terrified I
am even more bewildered."</p>

<p>"Soon," he assured her, "you will know everything. In the
meantime there are ices and cakes of every description, as you
may perceive from the plate of my chief opposite. His head for
figures and his appetite for sweets are the most amazing things I
have ever come across in my life."</p>

<p>"One peach, please, which you will prepare for me," she
decided. "I am too curious to eat more...."</p>

<p>It seemed to Clara that conversation had become more and more
staccato. Epstein was forgotten, finance again ruled, yet no one
seemed to be really and genuinely in earnest. There was an
atmosphere of tragedy looming somewhere in the background.
Something had happened. She looked around the room. At the
further end was a large writing table covered with papers and
surrounded by several chairs. She had the idea that documents
might have been signed there. On the left there was a closed
door. Gabble! Gabble! Gabble!</p>

<p>Everyone was talking now in rapid German, excepting Mr. James
Mortimer who probably did not understand and was leaning back in
his chair, a cigar in the corner of his mouth, smoking furiously.
The talented administrator of Advice Limited lost her taste for
eating and drinking. It was time the farce was over. She wanted
to be told the truth, to know what service was expected of her.
Suddenly Lady Hannah leaned across the table. Since that
lighthearted cocktail at the Embassy a few hours ago she seemed
to have aged a dozen years. Her tone was thick and husky.</p>

<p>"You are becoming impatient, Clara," she said.</p>

<p>"Very well, come with me and I will show you the problem we
have to face. It is ugly enough. I can promise you that."</p>

<p>Clara rose readily to her feet and followed her friend to the
door on the opposite side of the room. It opened into a bedroom
as large and beautifully furnished as the salon which they had
just left. On a handsome bedstead of Empire design was lying a
man, fully dressed, who Clara at first thought must be asleep.
She drew nearer and a little cry broke from her lips.</p>

<p>"He is dead!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Lady Hannah gripped at the bedpost. She was shivering.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is dead," she assented. "It happened half an hour
ago."</p>

<p>The Baroness Linz gazed with a sort of morbid fascination at
the face of the man who lay stretched upon the coverlet. There
were no signs that his end had been anything but a peaceful one.
His pale features were set and composed. His clothes showed no
sign of any struggle. Even the black flowing tie which had always
been the joy of the caricaturists was undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Is this the missing guest?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lady Hannah replied. "He was taken ill at the table. He
came in here. This is Baron Strengler's room. When he did not
return we&mdash;we came to look for him and found that he was
dead."</p>

<p>Clara looked across the bed towards her friend.</p>

<p>"For days," she said, half to herself, "the newspapers have
been at loggerheads. They said that he would never sign this
marvellous new treaty."</p>

<p>"He has signed," Lady Hannah muttered. "And he is dead."</p>

<p>Lady Hannah had abandoned her grasp of the bedpost. She seemed
to have recovered herself. Her voice was firm but hard.</p>

<p>"You and I do not need to talk politics," she continued. "The
question before us is this. We want practical advice from someone
who knows something about this sort of thing. What do you do with
a dead body?"</p>

<p>"Send for the doctor and the police as a rule," was the brief
reply.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like a fool, girl," Lady Hannah exclaimed
passionately. "Everyone knows that he was bent upon smashing the
Conference. Everyone in that room, including myself, believes
honestly and sincerely that his attitude would bring all Europe
to ruin. We should all be submerged by a great wave of
destruction. The scheme the Conference has drawn up will save us.
He was the only obstacle. The Prime Minister had sworn never to
sign without his consent. Everyone else was willing. You see,
therefore, that what has happened is not so great a
catastrophe."</p>

<p>Clara looked down at the almost waxen white features. She
touched the cold fingers for a minute. She looked across at her
friend in horror.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me that someone has had the
audacity&mdash;some one of you people here to-night&mdash; to
commit a murder?"</p>

<p>"Don't be an idiot," was the harsh reply. "These are all
famous diplomats here to-night. Who amongst them would be fool
enough to attempt such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Then how did he die?" the Baroness demanded.</p>

<p>"We procured a powerful, newly discovered drug, from a great
chemist, which was guaranteed to produce suspended animation in a
man for at least an hour and without any dangerous consequences.
When he refused to sign we slipped it into his wine. He drank
it&mdash;and afterwards&mdash;well, with assistance he did sign.
Rather a liberty, perhaps, but what are you to do with a man who
is threatening to pull down the pillars of the world? I don't
know whether we gave him too much. He has always been known as a
delicate man. Anyhow, you see what has happened."</p>

<p>Clara felt the limp wrist for a moment. Her expression was
very grave.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you have all been mad," she declared.
"For two years Nelson has been quoted as the greatest authority
in the world on British finance and British banking."</p>

<p>"Leave off that senseless talk," Lady Hannah begged. "Whatever
he may have been I tell you that he had lost his inspiration. No
more arguments. We are in the Ritz. We are in a private room. We
have a special exit reserved exclusively for us. The
reporters&mdash;everyone&mdash;are being kept in another part of
the hotel. We want that," pointing to the bed, "taken away so
that no one will have any need to suspect our word when we say
that he left the hotel as usual at the conclusion of the
Conference."</p>

<p>"And to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"We want it to be a matter of loss of memory. That part of it
is not difficult. Everyone knows that he is in shocking health.
Twice before he has gone off alone without a word to anyone. Once
he was found in Canada&mdash;another time in Scotland. No one
would be surprised at his disappearance. In a few months it won't
matter. We already have his signature beautifully forged on the
agreement. We want your advice only on the material things."</p>

<p>"There is one thing more I must ask," Clara persisted. "Could
you not at least have persuaded him to remain neutral?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely impossible," Lady Hannah declared.</p>

<p>"He was at his worst to-night. Soon after we sat down he
absolutely and positively announced that he had spent the
previous part of the day considering the matter and that he was
determined not to sign the new agreement and determined to advise
the Cabinet, even at the risk of war and the deflation of every
currency in the world, to have nothing to do with any part of the
scheme.... His next glass of wine&mdash;well, had something to do
with it. We were positively assured that it would do him no
permanent harm and that the effect would last for only about an
hour. Instead of that, soon after he collapsed we found that he
was dead. So that's that. The thing is&mdash;can you help
us?"</p>

<p>The Baroness bent once more over the prostrate body. Something
seemed to catch her attention and to hold her interest. She
hesitated as though debating with herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can help you," she promised gravely. "If I have
ordinary good fortune I can do what you want."</p>

<p>Lady Hannah showed signs of hysteria. Clara pushed her towards
the door.</p>

<p>"Leave me here alone for a quarter of an hour," the latter
enjoined. "If I want any help I will send for the young man who
brought me here."</p>

<p>Lady Hannah stumbled out of the room and the door was closed
firmly behind her.</p>

<p>In the salon there was a certain difference of opinion chiefly
because one or two of the little company knew a great deal more
than the others knew.</p>

<p>"I cannot for the life of me see any sense,"</p>

<p>Mr. James Mortimer declared doggedly, "in bringing that very
charming young woman into the affair at all. Everyone knows that
the poor fellow was in bad health. If he's had a stroke, or
something of that sort, why not send for the hotel doctor and
bluff it out? We've got his signature to the agreement. I'm not
altogether easy in my mind about that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" Baron Strengler interrupted fiercely,
"whether he was ill or well, dying or dead when his fingers held
the pen? We can all swear that we saw it in his hand and there is
his signature. The world is now saved from the greatest
catastrophe in history."</p>

<p>"Then there is another point of view," Lady Hannah argued.
"Supposing we send for the doctor and the reporters, what do you
suppose would be the effect when to-morrow morning's papers
announce the sudden death of the chief prop of British finance?
Everyone would go crazy. If he just walks out of the limelight
for a time the press will be on our side. They will all argue
that he broke down in health after signing this agreement and
that he has gone away for a sea voyage or something of that sort.
Remember, he has done it before. The papers never gave it away
but he went into hiding for nearly two months and no one had his
address."</p>

<p>The American pinched a fresh cigar and lit it. He looked
across the table.</p>

<p>"What is your idea of this, Lord Bradley?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is not absolutely straightforward, of course,"</p>

<p>Bradley admitted, "but I am inclined to agree with Lady
Hannah. There have been times before in the history of the world
when men like ourselves have had to step off the beaten track. I
think the news in to-morrow morning's papers of the sudden death
of our friend in there would bring about a collapse on the Stock
Exchange here, as undoubtedly it would in all the small countries
which we have been bolstering up. With the scheme we have
elaborated in the new Treaty I believe we can save the world. It
is not worth while risking everything for the sake of a few
scruples."</p>

<p>"I am of the same opinion," Francois Latourne pronounced.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer knocked the ash from the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>"I don't want to play a lone hand," he declared.</p>

<p>"If you others think this disappearance stunt can be brought
off I am not going to stand in the way."</p>

<p>Roderigo was pacing the room restlessly.</p>

<p>"The Baroness Linz, from our brief conversation," he observed,
"appeared to me to be of quite surprising intelligence. No doubt
she has a staff of friends of whom she makes use at times but
how, in this brief period, she is going to summon people to her
aid and whisk a dead man out of the hotel without comment from
the officials is incomprehensible to me. I think she takes too
much on herself. I feel inclined to offer my help."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the sort," Lady Hannah insisted. "You
are associated with us all and you must not appear in the
matter."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have confidence in my friend," Lady Hannah broke in. "I
have known her to accomplish more difficult tasks. Remember that
this suite is detached from the hotel proper and that the staff
have been ordered not to interfere with or look at anyone who may
pass from it into the courtyard&mdash;or enter it. We are
completely cut off from ordinary observation."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose everything is possible nowadays," James
Mortimer admitted. "To read some of these detective stories, a
little affair like this would seem only child's play."</p>

<p>"Fortunately for us," Lady Hannah observed, as she motioned
the Duke to fill her glass, "even the papers have been remarking
upon his appearance lately and when he arrived to-night he was
looking ghastly ill."</p>

<p>She finished her wine and rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"The quarter of an hour is up," she announced. "I am going in
to see if she has a scheme. Will you come, Roderigo?"</p>

<p>The Duke rose to his feet. Together they crossed the room and
passed into the adjoining apartment. Even as she reached the
threshold a sharp cry of astonishment broke from Lady Hannah's
lips. She swayed upon her feet. The body of the man had
disappeared from the bed! There was no sign of the Baroness Linz!
The room was empty!</p>

<p>In a little more than twenty-four hours the great journalistic
salvos were fired. These were the days when the newspaper lion
was eating from the same platter as his cousin the lamb. For once
in the world's history there was national unity. The success of
the Ritz Hotel Conference, as it was called, was hailed as a
diplomatic and financial triumph which would turn out to be the
salvation of Europe. During the next few days Latourne, the great
French statesman, was cheered whenever he showed himself. James
Mortimer, the American emperor of finance, was hailed as one of
the deliverers of the world. Baron Strengler received an ovation
every time he presented himself at the door or the window of his
hotel. Lord Bradley's car was followed by an applauding mob
whenever it was seen. A crowd gathered around the modest town
house of the official representative of British finance cheering
and shouting but representatives of the Press, retiring baffled
from the premises, disclosed the fact that the man whose
obstinacy was said to have caused the crisis but who had finally
suffered himself to be persuaded to sign the famous agreement had
left town for a rest cure. He had done his part, however. The
Prime Minister had given his solemn word that if he set his name
to the agreement the country would adopt it. The thing had been
accomplished. Without a doubt Europe was saved. With true British
optimism everyone declared that a new era of prosperity was now
assured.</p>

<p>The Duque Roderigo de Partagena de Cervera y Topete drove his
beautiful two-seater down to Adam Street a few days later and was
ushered by Clara's saturnine butler into her presence. She
welcomed him cordially.</p>

<p>"Now that I know that you really are a Duke and a responsible
person," she said as she pointed to a chair, "I may say that I am
delighted to see you. You should not have confused me, though,
with that terrible name of yours."</p>

<p>"Baroness," he declared, with a twinkle in his eyes, "although
as yet I have persuaded no one to share it, it is a name of which
I am proud."</p>

<p>"You have every reason to be, I am sure," she acknowledged.
"It is a very famous name in Spanish history but what, I ask
myself, were you doing in that galere? Lady Hannah's presence I
could understand. She has been her father's private secretary
ever since he took office and we all know how ill he is. But
you&mdash; a Spaniard!"</p>

<p>"Since the downfall of our monarchy," he confided, "I have
accepted the post of secretary and interpreter to Baron
Strengler. He married into my family. I was general interpreter
at the Conference. I speak all the languages well."</p>

<p>"And your mission to me this morning?" Clara asked
sweetly.</p>

<p>"First of all," the Duke explained, opening his pocket-book,
"you can surely understand our anxiety to know how
you&mdash;er&mdash;disposed of that very obstinate gentleman with
whom we left you."</p>

<p>"And secondly?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"The second reason for my errand," he continued, opening his
pocket-book a little further, "is to offer you these two bank
notes for five hundred pounds each, which we hope you will
consider a suitable fee for your marvellous services."</p>

<p>Clara accepted the notes without hesitation and pushed them
into a drawer which she carefully locked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps on the whole," she observed, "history would declare
that I had earned them. Thank you."</p>

<p>"With regard to my first query?" the young man ventured.</p>

<p>The Baroness became more serious.</p>

<p>"You want to know what I did with the gentleman whom the
newspapers call 'the mystery man of finance'?"</p>

<p>"It would gratify an almost overwhelming curiosity.
Furthermore, it would set at ease any slight scruples we might
feel as to his dignified termination."</p>

<p>"Your English is not so good just now," she commented, "but I
think I see your point. Perhaps you would like to read this."</p>

<p>She handed him a letter addressed to the Baroness Linz in
large sprawling handwriting. At the top of the folded notepaper
which he drew from the envelope was printed the name of a well-
known steamer of the Canadian Pacific Line. He read aloud word by
word.</p>

<p class="letter">"My deak Baroness,</p>

<p class="letter">Here I am as Peter Halkin with a perfectly good
passport, a pound of my favourite tobacco, two of my chosen pipes
and a single change of clothes. I am on my way&mdash;never mind
where&mdash;but when I arrive at my destination I am going to
sleep for a year. No one need worry about me. I harbour no ill
feeling towards anyone. My health is improving with every day at
sea and I doubt whether I shall ever come back. I am only too
happy to have been able to escape.</p>

<p class="letter">You are a clever young woman but don't overdo
your activities. The most hackneyed of adages have their fallacy
and dead men sometimes can spread consternation. However, this
particular one is very much alive and bears no one any grudge.
Thank God I am out of it all. For weeks I have felt my brain
giving way.</p>

<p class="letter">If ever I feel like writing anyone again it
will probably be to you, but I don't think I shall.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever - yours,</p>

<p class="letter">Peter Halkin."</p>

<p class="letter">P.S. I have clipped off my beard and trimmed my
hair. I am sporting, instead of my spectacles, the monocle of my
college days and I swear that my own mother, if she were alive,
would not know me."</p>

<p>The Duke, for a moment, lost his aplomb. His open mouth gave
him an almost fatuous expression. He was for several seconds
without the power of speech.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he was not dead?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"Of course he was not," Clara replied. "I admit that you might
easily be deceived. His was no ordinary fainting fit or anything
of that sort. The drug which he was given must have been even
more powerful than was anticipated, and it did produce a genuine
state of suspended animation. I happen to have seen a case
before, though, when I was taking my course at the hospital, and
I knew what to do."</p>

<p>"This is very wonderful," Roderigo declared.</p>

<p>"How did you get him downstairs?"</p>

<p>"He managed quite well after a little treatment."</p>

<p>"And his signature&mdash;did he know?"</p>

<p>"He guessed all right. You see, he had sworn not to sign and
he didn't&mdash;consciously. There won't be any trouble, if
that's what you are thinking about. I myself think he was rather
glad of a dignified way out."</p>

<p>"This is all very strange," Roderigo murmured.</p>

<p>"Not if you think about it," she pointed out. "Nelson was a
terribly obstinate man, but he realised at the end that everyone
was against him. If this last desperate effort to put things
right had failed through his refusal to sign he would have had to
bear the whole brunt of the thing. You people were really very
kind to him. You put him in the right and the wrong at the same
time. He signed and he did not sign."</p>

<p>The Duke handed back the letter.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for a partner, Baroness?" he enquired.</p>

<p>She laughed into his serene but understanding eyes.</p>

<p>"Not just yet," she replied.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story6" name="story6">VI. &mdash; BETWEEN THE EIGHTH
GREEN<br> AND THE NINTH TEE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE telephone message was brought out to the
administrator of Advice Limited just as she had parked her car in
the open space behind the Golf Club shed at Ranelagh. She glanced
at the written lines apprehensively.</p>

<p class="letter">Lady Hannah Phillipson regrets that she will
not be able to play golf with the Baroness Linz this morning as
she is suffering from a bad headache.</p>

<p>Clara, with a gesture of disappointment, dismissed the boy and
considered the situation. There was no one waiting upon the tee,
no sign of anyone who might possibly want a game. It was a
morning in early spring, the turf looked soft and inviting, the
air was sharp but not too cold. Perhaps, after all, it would be
as well to use her voucher and play a few holes alone.</p>

<p>A familiar voice attracted her attention. A slim young man
wearing a soiled duster over his riding clothes had hurried
across the open space in front of the stables.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Baroness," he said. "May I carry your clubs to
the tee for you?"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Roderigo," she answered. "You are very kind.
What are you doing in that wonderful kit?"</p>

<p>He smiled blandly.</p>

<p>"A few of my ponies are still here," he explained.</p>

<p>"I may be able to play now and then this season. I have sold
most of them but there are five that remain. I keep only one
groom so I help to look after them myself in the mornings. I did
not stop to take off my coat because I was afraid that I might
miss you. Excuse."</p>

<p>He removed his duster solemnly. In his tweed coat and well
worn riding breeches his costume conformed to type.</p>

<p>"There is also," he confided, dropping his tone a little,
"another reason for my being here this morning. I was given to
understand there is just a chance that a personage in whom I am
greatly interested might be here. So far he has not arrived. I
think now that he will not come. It is difficult to tell nowadays
since he has taken a queer fancy for going about alone. And
you?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," his companion confessed as they
strolled towards the tee, "I was just wondering whether to play
golf alone or not. My partner has failed me."</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful morning," he said wistfully. "I would offer
myself as a partner but I play so bad."</p>

<p>"Rubbish," she laughed. "Get your clubs and come along."</p>

<p>"If the mysterious stranger in front would only let us
through," Clara Linz remarked as they neared the sixth hole, "we
should be having a wonderful game. I hate watching a man play
golf who doesn't seem to care whether he hits the ball or
not."</p>

<p>"Soon we catch him," Roderigo prophesied hopefully, "then we
go through."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," his partner grumbled. "He seems to be one of
those objectionable people who pick up their ball at the last
moment and hurry on."</p>

<p>At the eighth hole they came for the first time within hailing
distance of the lone player. They watched him tee his
ball&mdash;he had no caddie&mdash;and drive off. He carried the
stream and without a glance behind hurried across the plank
bridge. Roderigo looked after him with a puzzled light in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"It is a curious thing," he confided. "I don't think that my
friend would be playing golf alone, notwithstanding his queer
penchant for solitude these days. It would scarcely be
he&mdash;and yet there's a likeness."</p>

<p>"Whoever he is," Clara declared a little crossly, "he seems to
have something on his mind. He hits the ball without looking at
it and he plays nearly every ball with his brassie.... After this
hole I am going to call 'fore' and drive. You must back me up and
we will go through. I hate a single player in front."</p>

<p>Presently they caught sight of the offender leaving the green.
Clara played a good tee shot and her companion followed suit.
They crossed the bridge and were on their way to their balls when
Roderigo stopped short.</p>

<p>"Why, our enemy has disappeared!" he exclaimed. "What can have
become of him?"</p>

<p>For a moment they looked around in bewildered fashion. Then,
with a gasp of dismay, Clara pointed to a dark heap upon the
ground.</p>

<p>"He seems to have fallen down," she cried. "I'm afraid he must
have hurt himself."</p>

<p>They diverged to the right and hurried towards the prostrate
figure. Presently they began to run. An exclamation of horror
broke from Roderigo's lips as he reached the scene of the tragedy
and fell on his knees. The man was lying perfectly still, his
eyes stark open, his face drawn up as though in pain or terror.
In the middle of his forehead was a small hole.</p>

<p>He was quite dead.</p>

<p>It was about a fortnight later when Clara received an
unexpected visit from Roderigo, Duque de Partagena de Cervera y
Topete. She waved him to a chair but her welcome was clearly a
qualified one. She had strictly laid down a law that visits
during office hours were not allowed.</p>

<p>"My dear Roderigo," she remonstrated, "you know how pleased I
always am to see you for a cocktail in the morning at the Embassy
or in the evening at the Wanderers, but during office hours I
must be left alone. I have no time whatever to receive chance
visitors."</p>

<p>"But I am not a chance visitor," Roderigo pronounced eagerly.
"I am here officially on behalf of a great friend. It is an
affair of business entirely. He prefers not to interfere himself
so I come as his representative."</p>

<p>"What? Another case?" the Baroness laughed.</p>

<p>"Are you aiming at being my only client?"</p>

<p>"You have many others I am sure," he answered politely, "but
when you have solved one problem for my friends so wonderfully,
is it strange that, face to face once more with a difficult
crisis, I should be here again? My friend and I&mdash;he is a
very important person&mdash;we talk and talk and talk and we get
no further. Then I speak of you&mdash;of your
intelligence&mdash;of your success&mdash;of your wonderful
organisation," he went on with a little wave of the hand, "and my
friend says&mdash;'Visit that young lady. Confide in her. Tell
her the whole truth if it is necessary. Let us see what she can
do.'"</p>

<p>"Very flattering," Clara murmured. "Of course, if it is really
an affair in which my help would be possible I shall be delighted
to hear about it. Yes, you may smoke if you like," she added,
watching her visitor's well shaped fingers playing about his
waistcoat pocket. "Two cigarettes. No more. I myself love the
smell of your tobacco but my next client might be an old
lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," the young man assured her gravely as he shut
his lighter with a click. "It shall be one&mdash; no more. It is
the beginning which is difficult."</p>

<p>The picturesque genius of Advice Limited settled herself down
to listen. She was facing her visitor but not in a direct line,
and the half lights were upon her beautiful hair and her
sensitive, thoughtful face.</p>

<p>"Tell me what it's all about," she invited.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you will be disappointed at first," he
began, "but I must tell you that it concerns our little adventure
upon the golf links. What with the inquest and all those visits
from the police I expect you are quite fed up with it."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" she exclaimed, honestly surprised. "Surely
that is all wiped off the map?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so," he confessed. "It is my friend who thinks
not."</p>

<p>Clara puckered her brows for a moment.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Roderigo," she pointed out, "was there ever a
simpler affair? A man was found dead upon the links. We, as a
matter of fact, found him. He was behaving in a queer way to
start with. Fancy a man going out to practise golf with a brassie
and a niblick! He had a hole in his forehead when we found him
and the weapon from which the bullet which killed him had been
fired was within a yard or so of where he was lying. There was
not another soul in sight, a blank impenetrable fence on two
sides of him, the stream on the south and the open country to the
north."</p>

<p>"Quite true," her visitor murmured dolefully. "Quite
true."</p>

<p>"The usual inquest was held," Clara continued, "during the
course of which it transpired that he was a stockbroker who lost
a fortune during the war and was still in financial difficulties.
He lived alone and was subject to fits of melancholy. Letters
from creditors were found in his rooms and even in his
pocketbook. The jury, without leaving the box, brought in the
merciful verdict of suicide, without any evidence as to his state
of mind, and the Coroner acquiesced as a matter of course. That
is surely the end of Mr.&mdash;let me see, what was his
name?&mdash;Michael Berens."</p>

<p>"So it seems to you," Roderigo admitted. "So it seems to his
relatives, who never for a moment disputed the verdict, so it
seems to everyone else&mdash;except my friend."</p>

<p>"Is he a friend of the family?" Clara asked puzzled.</p>

<p>"No, he is not even that," Roderigo confessed. "I know what I
am here to propose must appear to you foolish but let me disclose
my friend's wishes."</p>

<p>"As quickly as you can, please."</p>

<p>"My friend, what he wishes is this," the young man confided.
"He wishes that you go back in your thoughts to when we found the
man lying dead. He wishes you to neglect all the evidence and
with the idea of suicide wiped out from your brain to see if you
can find out any way in which he could have been killed, to
advise us as to the method and in which direction to look for the
possible murderer."</p>

<p>"Your friend," the Baroness declared bluntly, "is crazy. The
man shot himself almost within sight of us. We were certainly in
sight a few seconds afterwards and there wasn't another human
being on that part of the course. The evidence supplied the
motive and the weapon itself was lying within a few feet of
him."</p>

<p>"My friend is rich," Roderigo continued unmoved, "and he is a
person of curious obstinacy. He offers you two hundred guineas to
place the matter in the hands of your investigators and another
three hundred guineas for your advice if by chance you should
discover any fresh solution to the mystery."</p>

<p>"My advice to him would be not to waste his money," was the
blunt reply. "However, it seems that that would be useless. Is
there any new evidence?"</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"Did he know this man Michael Berens?"</p>

<p>"He never heard of him."</p>

<p>"Is he by chance a little touched in the head?"</p>

<p>"He is a man of brilliant intellect."</p>

<p>"Your friend realises that he is throwing away his money?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, perhaps not. He asks that I beg you to start from
the moment we found the body and work backwards."</p>

<p>Clara shrugged her shoulders. She drew a diary towards her and
made a few notes.</p>

<p>"You accept the case?" Roderigo asked joyfully.</p>

<p>"I accept but I give no hope."</p>

<p>The young man rose to his feet and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"This morning," he confided, "I have exercised my ponies and
for a fee&mdash;you see, I too earn money, Baroness&mdash;I have
ridden two very wild animals for a young Armenian. The fashion of
lunching early in London has grown."</p>

<p>"At one o'clock in the Embassy Bar," Clara agreed.</p>

<p>"Run along now, there's a dear. I can hear my next client on
the stairs."</p>

<p>The Baroness Linz, although she viewed her task as quite
hopeless, was conscientious. She sent for Ernest Nicholson, whose
Investigation Bureau was under her control, and drove him down to
Ranelagh. Nicholson, who was a remarkably shrewd man of youthful
middle age, with several years' experience at Scotland Yard, was
inclined towards his patron's own point of view but found certain
features of interest in this curious commission.</p>

<p>"One thing, Baroness, we can take for granted," he pointed
out, as they walked across the golf course to the corner where
the eighth hole was situated.</p>

<p>"This nameless client of yours knows something we don't know.
It would have made it much simpler if he'd told us everything,
but he may have very excellent reasons for holding back and for
keeping his information from the police. That, I suppose, is
where we come in. There are two points about the case, of course,
which have always struck me as being rather quaint."</p>

<p>"What are they?" his companion asked.</p>

<p>"In the first place why did Berens bother to lug round a heavy
air rifle like that? Of course, he was able to conceal it in his
golf bag and that may have been why he took most of the rest of
his clubs out, but surely a revolver would have been easier."</p>

<p>"And the other thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the evidence at the inquest. There was really not much in
it. The slant of the wound was downwards, so that the bullet was
found at the back of the man's throat. You'd have thought he'd
have pressed the barrel flush against his forehead."</p>

<p>"Do either of those facts suggest anything to you?" Clara
enquired as they crossed the bridge.</p>

<p>"Only this," Nicholson admitted, "and it sounds a little far
fetched. That weapon would kill at a hundred yards. If a third
person had shot Berens it could have been done from some distance
away with that weapon, but not with an ordinary revolver."</p>

<p>"Then how did the weapon come to be found by the side of the
body," Clara asked, "and where was that third person when we
appeared only a few seconds afterwards?"</p>

<p>"A poser," her companion confessed.</p>

<p>They had arrived at the spot where the body had been found.
There were very few who passed, even now, without a shiver and it
still possessed a sinister fascination for the caddies. There was
no one playing in the vicinity so the two investigators were able
to loiter about. Even Clara herself felt a queer little sensation
of uneasiness as she pointed out the place. She crushed down the
weakness, however, and looked around her.</p>

<p>"Assuming for the first time that this was a murder," she
demanded, "what spots of vantage, if any, are within range of the
weapon?"</p>

<p>"Neatly put," her companion approved. "It could have been
fired from the other side of that fence in front of us or it
might have been fired from that tree on the right although, owing
to the slant of the wound, that is almost impossible. Or, of
course, it could have been fired from the top of an omnibus or
tramcar passing along the road. All these would be within range.
It could not have been fired by anyone upon the course itself if,
as you say, you crossed the bridge directly the man left the
green."</p>

<p>The Baroness nodded.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "I think you can rule out the shot
coming from behind the fence opposite because that is simply
waste ground belonging to the Club and not in use. The fence is
ten feet high, there is no way of climbing it and the slope on
the other side is downwards. As for the tree&mdash;well, here
comes Jenks, one of the gardeners. We'll ask him."</p>

<p>The man approached in answer to her gesture.</p>

<p>He took off his hat politely, recognising her as a friend of
the presiding genius of the place.</p>

<p>"Jenks," Clara asked him, "do you think it is possible for
anyone to climb that tree?"</p>

<p>"A monkey, your ladyship, no one else," the man replied.
"There's thirty feet there without a twig or an odd bit of bark
to hold on to. If you're thinking of what happened the other
day," he went on, "the police were round there before it came out
that the poor gentleman was likely to have committed suicide.
There wasn't even a scratch upon the bark anywhere.... Thank you,
madam. Good afternoon."</p>

<p>"That rules out the tree, then," Clara observed. "The tramcar,
of course, is an absurdity. What about the top windows of the
houses opposite?"</p>

<p>Nicholson measured the distance with his eye.</p>

<p>"It's a possibility," he admitted with a sudden increase of
interest in his tone. "I wish I had examined the rifle more
carefully."</p>

<p>"Let's see how far it is to the fence," Clara suggested.</p>

<p>They did so and found it less than fifty yards. The thing was
possible! They stood gazing over at the rows of windows.</p>

<p>"There are only two houses," she pointed out, "from which the
shot could have been fired, because it must have passed between
those two trees. And look&mdash; there's someone standing at the
window of the one right in the line."</p>

<p>A man, large and powerfully built, smoking a long cigar, was
standing there staring at them. He wore his hat, a broad-brimmed
Homburg, a little on one side and even at that distance Clara
fancied that there was a half-insolent, buccaneering look in his
eyes. She drew her companion away, laying her hand upon his arm
and sauntering as though they were ordinary loiterers.</p>

<p>"If that poor stockbroker did not kill himself," she declared
in a voice which shook with excitement, "there is the man who
shot him!"</p>

<p>"But, for heaven's sake why?" Nicholson demanded.</p>

<p>"Come and have some tea in the Winter Garden while we seek for
an inspiration," she invited.</p>

<p>About an hour later the inhabitants of Number Seventy-two
Langdale Terrace, a row of red brick villas overlooking one side
of Ranelagh, were somewhat flustered by the sight of a handsome
two-seater car drawn up outside their gate and the ringing of the
visitors' bell. The solitary domestic being otherwise engaged,
the lady of the house left the tea table and answered it
herself.</p>

<p>"Sorry to trouble you," Clara apologised pleasantly, "but we
were told you might have rooms to let. My husband and I,"
indicating her companion, "belong to Ranelagh and we thought it
would be so nice to be close at hand and have a view of the
course."</p>

<p>"I don't know who told you a story like that, miss, I'm sure,"
the woman replied, "but let rooms is a thing I never have done,
though what we're all coming to with these new taxes and what not
heaven only knows. I have eight children, a husband and my own
mother living here now, and four bedrooms is all we have. It
ain't likely we should be letting rooms."</p>

<p>"Sorry, I must have come to the wrong house," was the
regretful reply. "Do you know of anyone else in the neighbourhood
who takes lodgers?"</p>

<p>"There's Mrs. Garcia next door," the woman confided dubiously,
"but if you go there don't you mention my name, for we're not, as
you might say, on terms. Lodgers she does take, but whether she's
any rooms a lady and gentleman like you would care for I can't
say. An untidy looking lot of foreigners they always seemed to
me."</p>

<p>With renewed apologies the two callers took their leave and
Nicholson rang the bell of the next house, which was really the
one in which they were interested. Nothing happened for a
considerable interval. He ventured to ring again. This time the
door was opened almost at once. A stout, pale-faced woman with
black eyes, swarthy of complexion and unfriendly of aspect,
looked out.</p>

<p>"What is it that you want?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Sorry if we have disturbed you," Clara replied pleasantly.
"We heard that you might let rooms."</p>

<p>The woman looked them up and down suspiciously. Clara's
clothes, though unobtrusive, always possessed distinction, and
Ernest Nicholson, who was rather particular about his appearance,
patronised a West End tailor.</p>

<p>"What sort of rooms?"</p>

<p>"Two bedrooms and a front sitting room. My wife and I are very
fond of Ranelagh and we want to be near," the latter
explained.</p>

<p>"What is that&mdash;Ranelagh?"</p>

<p>"It is the name of the Golf Club opposite."</p>

<p>The woman reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"I have rooms," she admitted, "but they are all taken. Three
of my lodgers are leaving the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we could have a look at them," Clara begged. "It
would save us coming back. If they suited we could take the rooms
from&mdash;say, next Monday."</p>

<p>Mrs. Garcia shook her head scowling.</p>

<p>"To show rooms whilst they are still occupied," she said, "is
not a nice thing to do. My lodgers would object. Come when they
have gone. Come next Friday when I have cleaned up after
them."</p>

<p>Clara's hand stole down into her pocket. She held a pound note
thoughtfully between her fingers. She would have made it five had
she dared.</p>

<p>"We are so busy," she pleaded. "Just one peep in would
do."</p>

<p>The woman looked covetously at the pound note. It was evident
that she wanted it very much but felt herself in something of a
quandary.</p>

<p>"There is no need for us to see all the rooms," Clara
continued with the air of one anxious to save trouble. "If we
could just glance into the front upstairs room which overlooks
the links we might take the others for granted."</p>

<p>"My three lodgers are there now," the woman said doubtfully.
"They use it as a sitting room. I dare not let you go up without
their permission. Wait and I will see whether they will permit
you to enter. They are important people. They do not like to be
intruded upon."</p>

<p>She mounted the stairs, breathing heavily. They heard her
knock at the door, they heard the rumble of voices in some
foreign tongue and finally what sounded to be like a fierce
torrent of abuse. There was the opening and slamming of the door.
The lady appeared once more, scarlet in the face and muttering to
herself.</p>

<p>"Go away, please," she called out to her visitors. "Take your
money with you if you want it. The gentlemen are angry because I
even let you into the house."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Garcia," Clara pleaded.</p>

<p>"Do not Mrs. Garcia me but clear out," the woman enjoined.</p>

<p>Once more there was the sound of the door above opening. A man
leaned over the banisters&mdash;the man whom they had seen
standing at the window&mdash;burly, defiant looking, yet with a
touch of the rollicker in his smile as he lifted the hat he was
still wearing.</p>

<p>"I see the lady below in the green field, is it not so?" he
asked, with a look of undisguised admiration in his black
eyes.</p>

<p>Clara nodded.</p>

<p>"My husband and I are members of the club there," she
explained. "That is why we wanted to get rooms near."</p>

<p>"Quite good rooms these," the man assured her.</p>

<p>"You can come up. You can see for yourself. We go away the day
after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Very kind of you," Clara murmured, mounting the stairs
swiftly.</p>

<p>He threw open the door, scowling at Nicholson who had
followed. Clara, with a word of apology upon her lips, stepped
forward. The air of the room was heavy with cigar smoke. A pale
young man with a black moustache and pince-nez was banging away
at a typewriter. Another slightly older one was making notes from
a map he had spread out in front of him. Both regarded the
newcomers with obvious disapprobation. Clara, however, continued
to beam upon everyone.</p>

<p>"It would seem that you are great travellers," she remarked,
looking round at the maps, the piled-up suitcases and other
impedimenta of travel.</p>

<p>"All over Europe," the big man boasted, "we have important
affairs. From north to south we are always travelling. We see the
world, but seldom, young lady," he added, with a sweeping bow and
a glitter in his dark eyes, "do we behold a young lady so
charming. If it will give you pleasure, Sefiorita, I will show
you the other two rooms."</p>

<p>Clara shook her head laughing.</p>

<p>"This is enough," she assured him, with a glance out of the
window. "I would not trouble you so much. <i>Bon
voyage</i>...."</p>

<p>The woman waddled after them down the creaking stairs. Clara
produced two more pound notes.</p>

<p>"My husband and I must have a few days in which to make up our
minds," she explained. "We give you this to hold the rooms for us
until Thursday."</p>

<p>The woman smiled. Her face suddenly caught a reflection of
gracious youth. The money was good.</p>

<p>"It shall be as Madam suggests," she agreed....</p>

<p>"Smelly lot of Dagos," Nicholson observed as he scrambled into
his seat. "What is our next move, chief?"</p>

<p>"We make a report," she answered. "For one day we have gone a
long distance. Berens could have been shot from that window and
the man who talked to me&mdash;did you see his
muscles?&mdash;with a little run from behind, for which there was
plenty of room, he could have thrown that air rifle afterwards to
where it was found."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>Clara shrugged her shoulders. It was the only possible
answer.</p>

<p>"I take great pleasure, Baroness," Roderigo said two mornings
later, "in presenting to you my relative, General Cuidad da Vail,
who until a few months ago was Chief of the Police at
Madrid&mdash;the Baroness Linz."</p>

<p>"My unknown client?" the latter remarked smiling, as she held
out her hand.</p>

<p>The General bowed. Notwithstanding the fact that he was no
longer slim, with his white moustache and gallant bearing he was
a fine figure of a man.</p>

<p>"Your very grateful client, Baroness," the General
acknowledged. "I am here to express my appreciation of your
services verbally and I hope in other ways to your
satisfaction."</p>

<p>"That sounds very pleasant," the lady of Advice Limited
declared, endeavouring to conceal her surprise. "To tell you the
truth I felt that I had fallen a great deal short of what you
hoped for. It was difficult, however. All we could do was to
point out that what appeared to be a suicide might have been
murder if there had been the slightest motive for it, and to show
in what manner the murder might have been committed. The Duke's
instructions were obdurate or I should have passed the matter on
to the police where we left it."</p>

<p>"It was unnecessary, Baroness," the General replied. "Justice
has been done."</p>

<p>He showed signs of reaching for his pocketbook. Clara held out
her hand.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she confided, "I believe I would rather you
explained to me the meaning of this mysterious business and what
you meant by that last sentence than pay me my fee because, after
all, I did not carry the affair to any termination."</p>

<p>The General smiled.</p>

<p>"You are, I am convinced, a young lady of discretion," he
ventured.</p>

<p>"I myself will answer for it," Roderigo murmured.</p>

<p>"This money has been well earned," the General declared,
placing some notes upon the table. "The explanation shall be
gratis. You must know, Baroness, that up till now the Republican
Party in Spain has been unable to form a stable government,
consequently they are haunted by a growing fear that Alphonso
will suddenly return and take back his kingdom. To prevent that a
small army of miscreants from Barcelona, which is the
headquarters of communism in Spain, have been following Alphonso
about for the last two months. On the other hand there are some
of us others who stand for his protection."</p>

<p>"But here&mdash;at Ranelagh!" Clara exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Berens, the stockbroker. What's that got to do with it
all?"</p>

<p>"Three of these rascals from Barcelona, chief of whom was
Dominique Bastidio," the General continued, "settled in London.
They had information that Alphonso was to take golf lessons and
play polo at Ranelagh. They hired rooms and they waited. Upon a
morning there came this unfortunate man, Berens, who bears a most
remarkable resemblance to Alphonso. His Majesty was expected upon
the links that day. Instead came Berens, and from the window of
the room into which you penetrated, Baroness, that unfortunate
man was shot. His only crime was that he resembled a king."</p>

<p>"But surely," Clara protested, "those men&mdash;they were
Spaniards themselves&mdash;they didn't expect to find Alphonso
playing alone and unattended?"</p>

<p>The General twisted his moustache.</p>

<p>"The Baroness must remember," he pointed out,</p>

<p>"that these were ignorant scoundrels. They looked for Alphonso
and when that other poor man came along on the very day they were
warned to keep watch for their victim they did not hesitate for a
moment. There was certainly a strong resemblance and they did not
stop to think of the improbability of my late master being
absolutely alone. They were there to kill and they killed. There
was another reason, too, for their mistake. It is well known that
for weeks my master has been in a highly nervous and morbid
state. He has recently, on many occasions, sent away his
companions and indulged in deliberate solitude. The papers even
have commented upon this."</p>

<p>"And this man&mdash;Dominique Somebody&mdash;the murderer?"
Clara asked. "What has become of him?"</p>

<p>The General smiled with the air of one who has committed a
good action. With a gesture of apology he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"The remains of Dominique Bastidio," he confided, "were hauled
out of the Thames this morning. He will make no more attempts at
regicide. In this case, Baroness, we perhaps owe you our
apologies for having anticipated your advice but to set your mind
at rest let me tell you that the man had seventeen murders to his
credit."</p>

<p>"But," Clara protested, "couldn't you have left him to the
police?"</p>

<p>The General curled his moustache.</p>

<p>"No one could have proved the crime," he pointed out. "He
would have been extradited, sentenced to seven years imprisonment
and pardoned. Ours was the simpler way."</p>

<h2><a id="story7" name="story7">VII. &mdash; HELP FOR MR.
GOLDMAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">CLARA leaned across the table and lifted the
telephone receiver to her ear.</p>

<p>"Hello!" she said.</p>

<p>A shrill, eager voice with a distinctly Jewish intonation
replied.</p>

<p>"Goldman &amp; Company of Penton Street, Finsbury, speaking.
Who vas you?"</p>

<p>"I vas and I am Advice Limited," Clara answered.</p>

<p>"Don't be fresh, young voman," was the curt retort. "I vant to
speak to your principal, the Baroness Linz."</p>

<p>"Speak on then. I am the Baroness Linz."</p>

<p>The voice at the other end changed its tone. There was a
certain amount of respect in the next query.</p>

<p>"You vas the young lady who found out who stole those six
bales of silk from my nephew, Sam Fink's, warehouse?"</p>

<p>"Quite right," Clara assented. "That was not very
difficult."</p>

<p>"You take a taxi, young lady&mdash;I vill pay&mdash;and come
to 56 Penton Street, Finsbury, right along. Come straight to my
office. Don't speak vith no one."</p>

<p>Clara considered for a moment. Her recent activities had been
of a far more exciting character, but she had nothing in view for
the moment. An affair of an altogether different type might be
interesting as a matter of experience.</p>

<p>"Is the matter urgent?" she enquired. "I am rather busy this
morning."</p>

<p>"Urgent!" the voice at the other end exclaimed, quivering with
excitement. "I tell you it is tragedy vich has happened here! You
leave your other business. You come right away. I pay for the
taxi."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll come," she promised.</p>

<p>Clara, Baroness Linz, sole owner of the business of Advice
Limited, was without a doubt handicapped by her looks. She had at
different times been likened to Mona Lisa for her smile, to Fra
Lippo Lippi's Madonna for the exquisite clearness of her eyes and
the transparency of her complexion, to Viola Tree for the
delightfully humorous curve of her lips when she was moved to
inward mirth. Notwithstanding the fact that every article of her
attire was chosen to conceal rather than exploit her personal
charms and that she wore a closely fitting hat simply to hide the
colour of her beautiful hair, little Mr. Goldman seated before
his large, untidy looking desk, Rebecca, his daughter, and
Geoffrey Montressor, salesman of the firm, a blond young man of
gentlemanly appearance, were all struck dumb by her entrance. Sam
Goldman, who was diminutive in stature and afflicted by a slight
cast in one eye, and whose whole poise towards life seemed to be
apologetic, gazed at her helplessly. The young traveller, whose
manners were always above reproach, rose automatically to his
feet but was similarly impressed by her presence. Rebecca, with
the eternal egoism of her sex, after a single glance at the
newcomer looked only at the young man opposite to see in what
manner he was affected. Clara announced herself.</p>

<p>"I am the Baroness Linz of Advice Limited. I understand you
wish to consult me. Please let me know what the trouble is."</p>

<p>She selected the least dusty of the empty chairs and seated
herself calmly a few feet away from the desk. The young man was
the first to recover himself.</p>

<p>"You must forgive Mr. Goldman," he begged in a pleasant tone.
"He has had rather a shock this morning and, if you will pardon
my saying so, he was expecting to see an older&mdash;a different
sort of lady."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot change my appearance," was the cold
reply. "I may not be very old but I have had some experience in
helping people out of trouble. For instance, Mr. Goldman," she
added, turning to him, "it is quite true that I found the thief
of your nephew's bales of silk. Now, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Sam Goldman groaned. The recollection of his trouble dispelled
the momentary paralysis of his senses.</p>

<p>"I scarcely know vere to begin," he wailed in a thin, nervous
voice. "The shock has been too much. My poor head!" he exclaimed,
clasping it between his hands. "Our season's trade ruined. Oh
dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, sir," the tall young man intervened,
"perhaps I had better explain the situation to
the&mdash;er&mdash;the Baroness."</p>

<p>His employer waved his none too clean hand in assent. Geoffrey
Montressor, who in the local circles of the suburb in which he
lived was considered the complete ladies' man, turned towards
this amazing visitor.</p>

<p>"I know that your time is valuable, Madam," he began, "I will
try to be concise. We are manufacturers of ladies' clothing
here&mdash;perhaps I should say girls' and women's clothing, for
we cater to the lower middle classes&mdash;for the great shops
who show their wares in the windows. Lately our success has been
entirely due to the fact that we have an arrangement with one of
the most important French firms to send us over four times during
the year copies of their forthcoming designs. It costs us a great
deal of money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A fortune," Sam Goldman groaned. "Hunderets and
hunderets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;but it has always been worth it," Montressor
continued. "A few days ago we received in a sealed packet the
spring designs as usual. We rushed them up into the cutting room,
had a few samples made and I started off&mdash;I am traveller for
the firm&mdash;to see our biggest customer. To-day is Friday. On
Tuesday I showed the costumes to one of the most important
wholesale men in England. He just looked at me, smiled and shook
his head. When I asked him what was the matter he whistled down a
tube and in a few moments his foreman brought up precisely the
same goods as I was offering, cut in exactly the same way to the
same designs. I had to stand still like a fool whilst he told me
that he had placed his season's order a day before with a rival
firm."</p>

<p>"Explain the significance of this a little more clearly,
please," Clara begged.</p>

<p>"This is the problem," the young man pointed out. "These
costumes were cut from the designs which came to us in a sealed
packet from Paris and which were supposed to have been shown to
no one else in England. The designs, from the moment they
arrived, were locked in our safe here and taken up by Mr. Goldman
himself to the cutting room, yet somehow or other they must have
been got at and their secret disclosed to another firm of
manufacturers. They rushed through samples twenty-four hours
ahead of us and cut the ground from under our feet. I might as
well be out of business for it is the same wherever I
go&mdash;everyone has placed their orders."</p>

<p>Clara reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"Could this not possibly be an accident&mdash;an intense
similarity of design?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"If you were in the trade," Montressor assured her, "you would
realise the impossibility of such a thing. There are small
details in connection with the fall and sweep of the skirt and
the loops and hang of the cape which are entirely original. Our
designs have been stolen and copied. We have lost our season's
trade. That is our position."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman looked up. His eyes were red, his out-turned red
lips were quivering.</p>

<p>"Vee vas ruined, young lady," he groaned. "Our trade vas cut
away from under our feet. Vee have ten thousand pounds' vorth of
materials to pay for vithin the next three months and not an
order on the books."</p>

<p>Clara made no comment. She was beginning to develop a faint
interest in the situation.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that the firm which supplied you with the coming
designs has treated you fairly?" she asked. "Sure, for instance,
that they have not themselves supplied the same thing to your
competitors?"</p>

<p>"That is impossible," the young man declared with confidence.
"The designs come over in a sealed packet by air, they are met by
Mr. Ducane, the firm's agent, who brings them direct to us. The
seal is broken here before us all and the designs unrolled."</p>

<p>"Where do you keep the designs until you can get to work upon
them?" Clara asked a little wearily. These preliminaries always
bored her. It was only when the stage was set and the psychology
of the thing appeared that she was able to find a real interest
in her profession. Montressor pointed to the safe which stood
against the wall. She rose to her feet and, crossing the room,
examined it.</p>

<p>"A Bartholomew number five," she murmured in some surprise.
"Surely that is one of the best safes in the world."</p>

<p>"Vat it costet!" Sam Goldman groaned. "I bought it second hand
but it cost a fortune."</p>

<p>"Who sets the combination and keeps the keys?" she
enquired.</p>

<p>"Mr. Goldman himself," the young man replied.</p>

<p>"Do you mind opening it?" she begged.</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation. Mr. Goldman stroked his chin.
Clara smiled as she turned her back and walked to the far end of
the room.</p>

<p>"I will talk to the young lady," she proposed. "I promise that
I will not look round."</p>

<p>"Vee trust you all right," Mr. Goldman said, rising to his
feet and jingling a bunch of keys, "but maybe this is best. The
world is full of queer people. Ven it is open, young lady, you
shall examine it."</p>

<p>Clara glanced with some faint interest at the girl, who had
risen to her feet and was now standing by her side at a remote
window. She was pale and anaemic looking with jet black hair and
thin angular figure. Her eyes were the one beautiful feature of
her face. They were deep-set, almost black, but clear and
brilliant.</p>

<p>"Have you any theory about this, Miss Goldman?" she asked.</p>

<p>The girl, who was looking out of the window fixedly, shook her
head.</p>

<p>"How can one have a theory? My father and I alone, and perhaps
Geoffrey, know the combination."</p>

<p>"Is the young man whom you call Geoffrey a relative?"</p>

<p>A very faint streak of colour appeared in the girl's
cheeks.</p>

<p>"He is my fiance," she confided. "We are engaged to be
married. Father is very fond of him. He is quite one of the
family."</p>

<p>"Your fiance," Clara repeated thoughtfully. The girl's eyes
seemed to be pleading with her. She was trembling slightly and
her voice was not quite steady.</p>

<p>"You think it strange that I should want to marry someone who
is not of the same faith?" she queried.</p>

<p>"My father is not strict and Geoffrey has been very useful to
us in the business. You see, it is difficult for us sometimes.
People like my father succeed because they are hard-working and
saving but so many people think that when they do business with
Jews they are being taken advantage of. With Geoffrey it is
different. All the customers like him. They believe him when he
talks about prices. They feel that he is doing his best for them.
When he marries me he will be a partner."</p>

<p>"Very nice for him, I should think," Clara commented, with a
smile which she tried to make reassuring.</p>

<p>There was a summons from the other end of the room. Obeying it
Clara examined the safe with the air of an expert. It really was
a very solid and fine piece of work.</p>

<p>"I understand that there are no spare keys?" she
persisted.</p>

<p>"Not vith us. Only vun vith the maker and that has never been
used," Mr. Goldman confided. "Sometimes on Thursdays there is
quite a great deal of money for the vages. Vun key is enough. I
like to know that my money, ven it is out of the bank, is
safe."</p>

<p>The genius of Advice Limited returned thoughtfully to her
chair. Goldman resumed his seat. He watched her anxiously.</p>

<p>"Vell?"</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"You don't expect me to produce a divining rod and grope my
way to the thief, do you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Tell me the name of the firm who seem to have profited by the
theft&mdash;the firm who supplied your customer."</p>

<p>"Epstein &amp; Jacobs," the young man announced.</p>

<p>"They vas a good firm, but tricky," Sam Goldman put in. "Maybe
I trust Epstein, but Jacobs&mdash;he vould rob his own
father!"</p>

<p>"Have you any theory as to how they got hold of the design?"
Clara asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"They stole it," was the angry reply. "They vas rascals! They
have taken all my trade. Mr. Montressor here&mdash;this time last
year he sold eighteen thousand pounds' vorth of spring costumes.
This year nothing!"</p>

<p>"How do you suppose your designs came into the hands of
Epstein &amp; Jacobs? No one could break into that safe. It has
obviously never been tampered with since it was made and yon say
that you always keep the key in the family."</p>

<p>"How did them designs get stolen?" Sam Goldman demanded,
raising his voice despairingly. "How should vee know? Vee send
for you to find that out! Vat you think, young lady Baroness? Vat
you think now? Tell us."</p>

<p>Clara smiled.</p>

<p>"I am not a magician," she reminded him. "I will work on your
case if you like for three days. I shall require ten guineas a
day and fifty guineas if I am successful."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman groaned. It was a great deal of money.</p>

<p>"Ten guineas a day!" he expostulated. "My dear young lady, how
vas it possible for you to spend ten guineas a day?"</p>

<p>"Those are my terms. The ten guineas a day will go to the
private enquiry office I have to make use of, so you see if I
don't succeed I get nothing. If you think I am asking too
much&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet. Mr. Goldman rose too. He beat the table
with the palm of his hands.</p>

<p>"You vas too impatient, young lady," he cried.</p>

<p>"It vas a great deal of money you ask, but ve pay. You listen
to me&mdash;ve pay. Maybe you do for me what you did for my
nephew."</p>

<p>"I shall do my best," Clara promised. "If I don't succeed it
will only cost you thirty guineas."</p>

<p>"You vant ve should explain to you anything more?" Sam Goldman
asked. "Here we are&mdash;my daughter, Mr. Montressor and
me&mdash;ve tell you anything you ask."</p>

<p>"I only want to know one thing at present," Clara replied.
"Tell me the address of Messrs. Epstein &amp; Jacobs."</p>

<p>"Thirteen Stockton Row," Rebecca announced, looking up from
her work.</p>

<p>"They won't tell you anything," Geoffrey Montressor
prophesied. "They never give any of their business away."</p>

<p>"Very difficult people," Sam Goldman sighed. "You think you
earn that fifty guineas, Miss. Yes?"</p>

<p>Clara nodded to them all but refused to commit herself.</p>

<p>"I shall do my best," she promised. Being a young woman of
quick apprehensions Clara was not in the least surprised to find
that she was followed out of the premises of Messrs. Goldman
&amp; Company, or to hear a not unpleasant but deprecating voice
in her ear.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Baroness, may I walk to the corner of the street
with you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Montressor," she replied without enthusiasm.
"You may even fetch me a taxicab if you will."</p>

<p>"I would do anything you asked me to," he assured her
earnestly. "You won't mind, will you, if I say that I think you
are wonderful?"</p>

<p>The old trouble! But what an exceedingly foolish young
man!</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me like that, if you please," she begged.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because I hate silly compliments&mdash;especially from
strangers."</p>

<p>"How long will it take me to know you well enough to tell you
exactly what I think of you?" he asked. She looked at him
critically. Nothing in her expression displayed her growing
dislike.</p>

<p>"Please don't be personal," she begged lightly. "Can't you
give me a hint as to how those designs were got at?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could," he answered. "I'm afraid you won't do any
good by going to see Epstein."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They were not the actual thieves."</p>

<p>"They were the receivers of the stolen design. According to
you they could not have made the costumes without it."</p>

<p>"They won't tell you anything," he replied gloomily. "I have
been at their buyer already. We have always been pals. He would
tell me if he would tell anybody but he swears he doesn't even
know himself how the firm became possessed of the designs."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sidney Jacobs," he told her after a moment's hesitation. "He
is the son of the Jacobs who is in the firm."</p>

<p>She hailed a passing taxicab. The young man opened the door
and stood with his hat in his hand in the most approved
fashion.</p>

<p>"I could not come a little way with you?" he begged
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"When shall we hear from you again?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>"Whenever there is anything to report."</p>

<p>On the third morning after the visit of the head of Advice
Limited to Finsbury a note, which arrived by special messenger,
was brought in to Mr. Goldman. He read it and frowned.</p>

<p>"It is from Advice Limited, I'm sure," Rebecca declared. "Has
she found out anything?"</p>

<p>Her father reached for his hat. He had tucked the note away in
his pocket and he had an uncommunicative air.</p>

<p>"She vas not vell," he confided. "She thought maybe I would
call and see her."</p>

<p>"Better let me go, sir," the blond young Adonis, who was
kneeling on the carpet filling a sample case, suggested. "I can
handle her all right."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman shook his head.</p>

<p>"I go myself," he announced. "I shall take the bus to Moorgate
Street and then the Underground. It will take me an hour and a
half. I shall be back at twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"Much better let Geoffrey go, father," Rebecca persisted,
noticing the shadow on her fiance's face. "He is more used to
those sort of people."</p>

<p>"I go myself," Mr. Goldman repeated obstinately.</p>

<p>"If the young voman has anything to tell she vill tell it to
me. No need to vaste time vith fine talk. The young voman knows
what business is. She don't vant no nonsense."</p>

<p>The head of the firm took his leave, omitting to mention the
fact that the note which he had received stipulated that he
should come himself to see Advice Limited and not send any
representative. He caught his bus, resisted the temptation to
expend a penny on a morning paper and in due course reached the
Strand and, mounting two flights of stairs, presented himself at
Clara's tiny domicile in Adam Street. He looked around him in
wonder as he was shown into the small elegantly furnished room by
the dark-visaged butler. There was nothing except the telephone
and a large, severe-looking desk to indicate that business was
transacted in this very feminine apartment. Mr. Goldman felt his
pulses tingle nervously as he sat on the edge of his chair
swinging his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>"Vell?" he exclaimed eagerly. "You find out
something&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," Clara confessed. Sam Goldman was
thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"Vat you say?" he demanded in a changed tone.</p>

<p>"You find out nothing at all? You take ten guineas a
day&mdash;thirty guineas&mdash;and find out nothing! Vat you
bring me all this way for just to tell me that?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite so unreasonable as you seem to think," Clara
reassured him, smiling. "In the first place I am not going to
charge you one penny for the present. That's good news, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Goldman was vastly relieved. His one sound eye twinkled.</p>

<p>"Dat vas good news," he admitted cautiously.</p>

<p>"How could you charge, though, ven you find out nothing?"</p>

<p>"You say you get these sets of designs four times a year," she
remarked. "When is the next lot due?"</p>

<p>"The last week in April," Goldman replied. "They will be for
the summer styles. But vat is the good? If no one finds out
anything maybe they get stolen again."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"They probably will, but this time I shall be able to produce
the thief."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" he demanded, eyeing her shrewdly.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have not been altogether so unsuccessful as I
appear to have been," she confessed. "I have had a talk with Mr.
Ducane, the agent of your French firm, and I have made friends
with Mr. Jacobs, the buyer at Epstein's. My Information
Department, too, has been at work and I know something about
these people. At the present moment I could guess how your
designs came into the hands of Epstein &amp; Jacobs and I should
probably be right."</p>

<p>"But why not tell me&mdash;tell me quick?" Goldman exclaimed,
mopping his forehead. She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have no proof," she told him, "and I do not work without
proof. I think I can produce the thief during the first week of
May and before he has done you any further harm."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman sighed deeply. He could not conceal his
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Dat vas very clever of you," he said sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Vat about all the cloth I bought for the spring styles? Vat
am I going to do vith my vork people and my machinery? Vat about
paying my bills when they come due with no sales in the book? Do
you think I am made of money?"</p>

<p>"You want my advice?" Clara asked.</p>

<p>"Vat else do I pay for?" Goldman demanded, apparently
forgetful of the fact that so far he had paid nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, here it is," she continued. "I can quite understand
that your ordinary spring trade is ruined. You are second in the
market instead of being first. Still, you must do something with
the material. You have the machinery and you have the work
people. You have the designs, too, even though they have been
copied. Make up the costumes and sell them, if you must, without
a profit."</p>

<p>"Vithout a profit," Goldman groaned, wincing as though in
agony. "Vat nonsense you talk, young lady. You suggest to a
business man that he sells vithout a profit! Is dat your fine
advice? Do people pay you for telling them things like that?"</p>

<p>"Only for three months," she reminded him gently.</p>

<p>"In that way you pay your bills, you keep your work people
employed and I expect there is always a little departmental
profit to be made. Anyhow, you keep the factory going and after
next quarter I don't think anyone will steal your designs
again."</p>

<p>"You give good advice, you do," Mr. Goldman lamented. "You
call it advice to sell my goods, my beautiful goods, without a
profit!"</p>

<p>"Only for three months," she reiterated. "Surely that would be
better than doing no business at all. At the end of three months,
if anyone tries to steal your next season's designs, I shall find
out who it is and the trouble will probably never occur
again."</p>

<p>"You tell me who it is now," he begged, with a sudden change
of front. "After all, you vas working for me. You tell me what
you think."</p>

<p>She shook her head very firmly indeed.</p>

<p>"I should never do that," she told him. "I take no account of
suspicions. If I accuse anyone I produce the proof."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman groaned. Three months' work and no profit! Yet it
was good advice&mdash;he knew that. Not advice to be paid for,
but good of its sort. He rose reluctantly to his feet.</p>

<p>"You tell them in the office and let your friends believe that
I have failed completely," she advised him.</p>

<p>"So you have," he snapped.</p>

<p>Clara, Baroness Linz, only smiled.</p>

<p>Sam Goldman, when he had once made up his mind to the ghastly
exploit of selling without a profit, rather enjoyed those next
three months. His competitors, even his old friend, Aaron Sachs,
were furious with him.</p>

<p>"Ruin," the latter declared angrily one evening when the two
met in a tea shop, "is what you are asking for. You cut the
market so no one can live. You sell that costume for forty-two
shillings what costs forty shillings before it leaves the bench.
It vas not honest trading, Sam. The bankruptcy court is where you
will end."</p>

<p>Sam sucked up his tea noisily.</p>

<p>"You vant too much profit, Aaron," he said with a soothing
note in his tone. "Vait till the next models are here. Maybe I
put up my prices then."</p>

<p>"Listen, Samuel," his old friend implored him.</p>

<p>"Let me look at your costings. I can show you where you are
wrong. It is that smart young salesman of yours who is doing the
mischief. I tell you no one can sell at your prices. You vill
fail, Samuel."</p>

<p>Goldman smiled cryptically. He laid his hand upon the arm of
the man whom he had known since boyhood.</p>

<p>"Aaron," he reminded him. "There vas a manufacturer not so far
from us two now, a manufacturer whose name was not so unlike
Aaron Sachs, who never had any money until after he had
failed."</p>

<p>Aaron Sachs, who was a fat man, wiped his forehead
vigorously.</p>

<p>"If my own brother had said that to me, Samuel," he declared,
"I should have called him a liar...."</p>

<p>Even Geoffrey Montressor, although his work was made easy for
him, grumbled.</p>

<p>"I shall never be able to get prices up again, Mr. Goldman,"
he told his prospective father-in-law gloomily. "Everyone says we
have gone mad. We sell our spring models too cheap."</p>

<p>"If you can make better prices, make dem," was the prompt
reply. "Vat vould you have? You like me to keep all that cloth,
turn away half my hands, do no business and ask to have my bills
renewed just because Epstein &amp; Jacobs got my designs and
steal my customers? I vill show them people something!"</p>

<p>"You have shown them something already," the young man
remarked disconsolately. "Sidney Jacobs won't speak to me now. He
thinks we are doing this out of spite."</p>

<p>"Maybe we are, my son," Goldman sighed.</p>

<p>"Maybe we are crazy."</p>

<p>"That's what people are beginning to say."</p>

<p>Samuel Goldman chuckled. His unpopularity afforded him a sort
of savage satisfaction. About a week before the time appointed
for the delivery of the summer designs by Mr. Ducane, Miss
Rebecca Goldman rang the bell of the small flat in which the
business of Advice Limited was conducted and was promptly
admitted. Clara received her kindly, ordered tea and did her best
to make her visitor feel at ease. It was obvious, however, that
the latter was anxious and upset.</p>

<p>"I got your note, Baroness Linz," she said after a nervous
pause, "and, as you see, I have come along. I cannot think even
now, though, what you want with me."</p>

<p>"You have done what I asked?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I came and I told no one. But what do you want?"</p>

<p>Clara took note of the girl's hollow cheeks, her over-
brilliant eyes and her general restlessness of mien.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not very well, Miss Goldman," she said
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter with me," was the hasty reply.</p>

<p>"You are not overworked?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"We have finished the spring business," she explained. "Just
now there is very little work to do."</p>

<p>"You are waiting for Mr. Ducane to bring you the summer
designs, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Rebecca assented a little faintly.</p>

<p>"Did your father ever tell you what I promised him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I promised him that when Mr. Ducane arrived this time I would
tell him who had taken his spring designs from the safe, had them
copied and replaced."</p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this, Baroness Linz? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>Clara moved her chair and laid her hand on her visitor's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Miss Rebecca," she confided. "You see, I have found out who
removed the designs and who copied them. I want to talk to you
about it."</p>

<p>In Rebecca's deep eyes there was the terrified look of a
hunted animal. She was incapable of speech.</p>

<p>"I almost made up my mind," Clara went on kindly, "not to
interfere at all. I am only doing so for one reason. I am afraid
Mr. Montressor has not been treating you very well."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" the girl faltered.</p>

<p>"I have an enquiry office connected with my business, and I
have learnt a few things about Mr. Montressor. I can tell you the
whole story if you like."</p>

<p>"Geoffrey never stole the designs," the girl exclaimed
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"No, but you did," Clara told her. "Four or five times, I
think, within the last few years, but never so flagrantly as on
this last occasion. You took the designs from the safe on
Saturday when, as you know, your father would never cross the
threshold of his factory. The young man had them copied and they
were back again before sunset. He sold the copies to Epstein
&amp; Jacobs and swore to you that he was putting the money aside
to buy furniture for your house. He says the same thing to Miss
Jacobs whose people believe that he is engaged to her."</p>

<p>"It's not true," Rebecca cried, a throb of despair in her
voice. "It's not true. He is engaged to me."</p>

<p>"He is behaving shockingly to both of you, of course. I expect
that somewhere or other there is a third girl or even a fourth or
a fifth."</p>

<p>"I don't care how many girls there are," Rebecca sobbed,
twisting up her handkerchief in her fingers.</p>

<p>"What you say is true. I stole the designs this last time and
I have copied an odd one or two before when it was not so
important, but Geoffrey and I are to be married and father has
been mean about the money. Geoffrey may seem to have been
friendly with the others but he doesn't mean it. I don't care so
long as I get him. Don't you interfere, Baroness Linz. It's not
your business."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" Clara remarked, smiling. "I rather think that it
is. However, listen to me. I don't want to do you any harm. If
you have really made up your mind that you still want to marry
him&mdash;although you must know yourself that he is not
faithful? I would rather help you than stand in the way."</p>

<p>"You mean it?" the girl asked feverishly.</p>

<p>"I do," Clara assured her. "I think you are foolish, but then
all girls are foolish once in their lives."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell father?"</p>

<p>"In my own way, in my own time I may let him guess," Clara
admitted. "Do you believe in me, Miss Goldman?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl faltered.</p>

<p>"If you want to get out of this trouble, if you want to keep
the young man&mdash;if you think he is worth it&mdash;will you do
exactly what I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well then. Mr. Ducane will pay his usual visit to your
office next Friday. Have you promised this young man to copy the
patterns for him?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;he expects me to. But, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," Clara insisted. "Mr. Ducane will present the
designs. Your father will study them. They will be sealed up as
usual presumably until Monday morning. You will go down to the
office&mdash; as you have done before&mdash;on Saturday, you will
make copies of the designs and you will pass them on to Mr.
Montressor."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I am to go on doing this?" the girl cried,
bewildered.</p>

<p>"Just once more. Then if this young man marries you I presume
there will be no further occasion for it. We must try and
persuade him that Mr. Goldman is likely to be a better father-in-
law than Mr. Jacobs."</p>

<p>"If you can do that," Rebecca pleaded passionately. "If only
you can do that. Sarah Jacobs is extravagant, she can't cook, she
can't keep house. She cares for nothing but fine clothes and
going out with young men. There is nothing in the world I care
for but just Geoffrey."</p>

<p>"What you have to do," her mentor reminded her with an
encouraging smile, "is not very difficult and if you do it I
think I can promise you that you will keep the young man."</p>

<p>A few days later a somewhat angry manufacturer of ladies'
clothing climbed the same stairs and was admitted into the
feminine sanctum of Advice Limited. Its presiding genius, who
seldom shook hands with anybody, motioned him at once to a chair.
He sat on its edge twiddling his hat in his hands and retained
his overcoat.</p>

<p>"You may be a very clever young voman, Baroness," Sam Goldman
began impetuously, "but you try to treat me as though I were one
big fool. I am a good business man. I find my vay through the
vorld quite all right. Vy should you be the one to decide how
much you shall tell me of my own affairs and how much you shall
keep to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Goldman," she begged, "put your hat down on the floor,
please. Thank you. Now listen. It is a very difficult thing to
give advice and to help other people and you can only do it if
they are able and willing to help themselves. I always have to
explain that to my clients. You must have confidence in me."</p>

<p>"Dat vas all very vell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," Clara interrupted. "I told you only three months ago
that I thought if you were patient until this week I could stop
your new designs getting into the wrong hands and if you insisted
upon knowing I could explain to you how it has happened that your
secrets have leaked out. Very well, I know now that I can keep my
word but I must do it my own way."</p>

<p>"Vat you call your own vay?" Sam Goldman asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You will receive Mr. Ducane on Friday afternoon as usual but
he will arrive an hour late. It will be half past six when he
comes. You will accept his packet and you will lock it in your
safe after a brief examination. You will call and see me on
Sunday&mdash; at this time&mdash;and from then on, with the
exception of one or two small details, everything will explain
itself."</p>

<p>"And how do I know that my designs will not be stolen again?"
Sam Goldman demanded.</p>

<p>"You must take my word for it."</p>

<p>"And ven shall I know who stole them last time?"</p>

<p>Clara considered.</p>

<p>"How long does it take you to make the two or three sample
costumes which Mr. Montressor takes out to get his big orders
from?"</p>

<p>"Forty-eight hours," the clothing manufacturer replied.</p>

<p>"On Wednesday or Thursday then of the following week."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman deliberated for several moments.</p>

<p>His lips were pursed, his lingers&mdash;an old trick&mdash;
seemed to have the inclination to stroke his nose. He was in a
state of uncertainty.</p>

<p>"I have told you all that it is necessary for you to know at
this moment, Mr. Goldman," his adviser assured him. "Believe me,
the rest of the affair is very much better arranged by someone
outside."</p>

<p>"But how vas you able to get to know about my affairs?" Mr.
Goldman enquired. "You sit here in your little parlour all the
time. Vat do you do? Make guesses?"</p>

<p>Clara smiled.</p>

<p>"If I do they are generally good ones," she conceded, "but of
course I have to have help. If you like to know I will tell you
that I have connections with a very excellent enquiry office and
through them I have been in touch with Mr. Ducane and two other
firms in your particular line of business. I can tell you one or
two things about people whom you know which may surprise you
presently. I shall earn my money all right, Mr. Goldman."</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and nodded.</p>

<p>"I trust you," he announced. "I think you are vun smart
girl."</p>

<p>Somewhat later than his accustomed time on the following
Friday afternoon Mr. Ducane, dapper and smart as usual, was
ushered into the office where Samuel Goldman, Rebecca and Mr.
Geoffrey Montressor were eagerly awaiting him. There was a little
chorus of greetings and they all gathered round the table whilst
Mr. Ducane broke the seals of the parcel he was carrying.</p>

<p>"This time," he confided, "I met the aeroplane at Croydon. I
have come straight from there."</p>

<p>"Any particular change in the styles?" Geoffrey Montressor
asked.</p>

<p>"More changes than I expected," the agent replied. "You will
find several small surprises."</p>

<p>"Ve vill have just one look&mdash;one quick look,"</p>

<p>Mr. Goldman declared excitedly. "It is a bad day you come
late, Ducane, on a Friday. I finish vork ven the sun sets. Never
mind, just a glance at the number one costume, then ve lock
everything avay until Monday morning."</p>

<p>The agent undid the parcel and drew off the tissue paper. Mr.
Goldman held up the design and unfolded a pattern. The young
man's lips pursed in a whistle.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "Shorter! And everybody said the
skirts were to be longer. Look at the new bodice too. High neck,
after all, and if there's not a belt!"</p>

<p>"Marvellously chic," Ducane commented reverently.</p>

<p>"Takes your breath away at first," Sam Goldman admitted,
covering over the pattern, "but it's what they asked for. It's
something new. No one shan't cut in this time on us! Vee start
work at six o'clock Monday morning. Your appointment was for
Wednesday, Geoffrey, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nine-thirty at Lessingham's&mdash;with the boss himself," the
young man announced. "Very few travellers get anywhere near him
nowadays."</p>

<p>"I go with you myself," Sam Goldman decided.</p>

<p>"Very polite Mr. Lessingham will think it after our little
dispute a few months ago. Now&mdash;if you please&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pushed them out of the way, deposited the packet in the
safe, locked it with great care and rattled the keys in his
pocket. Then he picked up his hat.</p>

<p>"Close up, Rebecca," he directed. "Come along, Mr. Ducane and
Geoffrey. I don't like that any light shall burn in here on
Friday night. Are you coming home to supper with us, young
man?"</p>

<p>Geoffrey Montressor hesitated. The words of an excuse were
already framed upon his lips but his prospective father-in-law
would have none of it.</p>

<p>"You come right along," the latter insisted. "Vee may talk a
little business and you and Rebecca can have your valk."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," the young man replied meekly. That Wednesday
morning's appointment was Sam Goldman's hour of triumph. He
elected to carry the sample case in which reposed the three
costumes under his own arm. For the first time when on an errand
which was purely a business one he engaged a taxicab. From the
moment of their arrival things seemed favourable. Mr. Randolph
Lessingham, the head of the great firm, received them with
exceptional consideration.</p>

<p>"I trust that we are going to be more fortunate than last
time, Mr. Goldman," he said. "I have only seen one design for the
summer season and I don't mind telling you that I am not touching
it. Now let's have a look at yours."</p>

<p>Geoffrey Montressor had already started to unfasten the strap
of the box. He was looking puzzled and his fingers were shaking.
His employer watched him keenly.</p>

<p>"My young man," he apologised, "is not quite himself this
morning. Too excited you get, Geoffrey. You see a big sale
coming. You should take it coolly as I do. Remember that big
sales ain't everything in the vorld. When ve sell to a house like
Lessingham's there is very little profit to be made.... There you
are, Mr. Lessingham. Vas there ever an artist turned out a finer
design than that or a manufacturer better quality goods?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sam Goldman was in his element. He held up the model, he
smoothed the skirt with knowing fingers, he shook out the newly
shaped coatee. Geoffrey, who was watching, seemed
thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "The skirt is longer! That
coatee&mdash;it didn't seem cut like that to me on Friday."</p>

<p>"The goods are better than the design," Sam Goldman declared
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Lessingham called in his partner. They whispered together
for several moments, shook out the costumes and held them at
every possible angle. Finally the head of the firm turned to his
visitor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Goldman," he said, "I congratulate you. This time you are
on top. I am going to do big business with you."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman chuckled. He moistened his red lips, his sound eye
beamed.</p>

<p>"I knew it, Mr. Lessingham," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"There ain't no one gets what ve gets. Just now and then ve
may miss it but not often."</p>

<p>"How many costumes can you turn out per week?"</p>

<p>"A thousand in assorted colours and materials."</p>

<p>"Very good," Mr. Lessingham decided. "I take you on for three
months."</p>

<p>Sam Goldman's fingers trembled so that he could scarcely hold
the pencil and order book which he had produced. He gave a little
gasp.</p>

<p>"Fourteen thousand costumes we may as well call it in round
numbers. My buyer shall go round and select the various
materials. We will take the price you have marked here as the
basis for the tweeds and we will adjust the other prices
according to the quality of the material we choose. Is it a
deal?"</p>

<p>It was very much a deal. Mr. Lessingham rang for his contract
clerk and typist. Geoffrey Montressor was fanning himself at the
window. A crisis of one sort had passed without a doubt but he
understood now that furious stream of telephone calls and the
urgent desire for his presence at the premises of Messrs Epstein
&amp; Jacobs.</p>

<p>It was certainly Mr. Sam Goldman's day. He showed an
unexpected firmness when his young companion tried to escape, if
only for half an hour.</p>

<p>"A business conference," he announced. "That's what ve are
going to have directly ve get back to the office. Afterwards you
go where you like."</p>

<p>Geoffrey Montressor, who was not looking forward with any
particular pleasure to his interview with Epstein &amp; Jacobs,
assented without demur. The conference consisted of Clara Linz,
Rebecca, Sam Goldman and Geoffrey himself. From the first Sam
Goldman, who seemed to have taken to himself a new dignity,
dominated the gathering. He spoke more slowly than usual and
there was an unfamiliar gravity in his tone.</p>

<p>"You two, Rebecca and Geoffrey, you have got to listen to me
carefully," he began. "All that I say has been put into my head
by this young lady," pointing to Clara, "but I think she sees the
world better than we see it sometimes. Three months ago there
came about a great disaster when our designs were stolen from
that safe. Someone sold them to Epstein &amp; Jacobs and I lose
my trade. I send for this young lady Baroness. She did not make
no rash promises but she just talked good commonsense. What she
said was&mdash;do not sit down and fret, use up the cloth you
have got to pay for and when the time comes for the next designs
to arrive maybe I do something for you. I did what she told me.
Last Friday our friend Mr. Ducane he had two packages of designs.
One he left with this young lady until Sunday, the other he
brought here. The one he brought here went into my safe and maybe
someone has had it out and copied from it this weekend. If they
did it won't do them any good. They vas very bad
designs&mdash;even Epstein &amp; Jacobs could not make for
themselves good sales with designs like that!"</p>

<p>No one spoke. Geoffrey Montressor, who was something of a
coward, was ghastly pale. Rebecca's great eyes reflected some of
the horror which she was feeling.</p>

<p>"This may seem funny what I am going to say," Sam Goldman went
on. "Just at first I did not see it like I do now but this young
lady she talked to me and I think she is right. I don't want no
trouble. Rebecca she is my only daughter. You Geoffrey&mdash; I
vas fond of you really like a son, although sometimes you may
make a slip. I don't vant to know who took those designs. I vant
you two to get married next week. When that's all agreed we vill
go somewhere and drink a bottle of wine to the biggest order the
firm has ever had and maybe one small change in the name."</p>

<p>Mr. Goldman was embarrassed by the attentions he received.
Rebecca's cheek was pressed to his, the young man was grasping
his unoccupied hand in fervent and desperate gratitude. Mr.
Goldman's one sound eye was moist.</p>

<p>"Now, now, now," he said. "That's all right. That vas settled.
Ve never think of it again. All gone. Rebecca, you get my cheque
book. You write out cheque to young lady Baroness&mdash;eighty
guineas&mdash; thirty expenses, fifty for the job. And I tell you
this, young lady Baroness," he wound up emphatically, "you tell
me you have got some clever helpers behind you. Maybe you have,
but you know how to give advice good."</p>

<h2><a id="story8" name="story8">VIII. &mdash; THE LONELY
MAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">"IT is a good party?" Roderigo questioned
hopefully.</p>

<p>"It is a very good party indeed," Clara assented.</p>

<p>"You enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>"Immensely. There is no one else, however, who dances nearly
as well as you do."</p>

<p>"We have this one&mdash;yes?" he invited, rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>Clara shook her head.</p>

<p>"You have not quite been doing your duty," she pointed out. "I
don't think you have danced once with Lady Hannah who, after all,
is your joint hostess."</p>

<p>"If I dance with her now," he complained, "you will be left
almost alone."</p>

<p>"No one minds that here," she assured him. "The place is too
intime. Besides, I shan't be alone. The beautiful dark woman
opposite with the sad expression&mdash;I didn't catch her
name&mdash;has something to say to me, I'm sure. Twice she leaned
across the table just as I was fetched away to dance."</p>

<p>Roderigo for a moment looked serious.</p>

<p>"You did not catch her name," he repeated. "That is Mrs. Roy
Tremlett."</p>

<p>"What? The Mrs. Roy Tremlett who&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly. They were only just out of earshot of
the woman who was leaning back in her chair gazing listlessly at
the dancers.</p>

<p>"Yes," Roderigo acknowledged gravely. "That is she. You do not
wish, perhaps, to speak with her. You see, she is a sort of
cousin of Lady Hannah's, and of Marsham too if it comes to that.
They take her side."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Clara demanded. "I never heard much about the case
but I know that everyone sympathised with her.... Go along and
ask Lady Hannah now. We shall have plenty of time to dance later
in the evening."</p>

<p>The young man obeyed orders. It had been a very brilliant
little dinner-supper party given jointly by Lady Hannah, who was
one of London's best-known hostesses, and Roderigo himself, a
party towards the complete success of which Clara had certainly
done her share. The latter was no sooner left alone than the
woman opposite rose to her feet, picked up her fan and vanity
case and took the chair which Roderigo had just vacated.</p>

<p>"May I come and talk to you for a few moments, Baroness?" she
asked, in a curiously low sweet voice.</p>

<p>"I should be delighted," was the ready assent. "What an
amusing place, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," was the listless reply. "I am afraid I have
rather lost my taste for this sort of thing. You are the young
lady who gives advice professionally, aren't you? Hannah
Phillipson says that you are wonderful."</p>

<p>Clara nodded.</p>

<p>"It is a quaint profession, isn't it?" she remarked.</p>

<p>"Still, most of the vocations for women are so overcrowded and
I wanted something to do. On the whole, I suppose I ought to
consider myself lucky. I have had some interesting
clients&mdash;Lady Hannah has been one of them&mdash;and I have
been able to help a few people."</p>

<p>Mrs. Roy Tremlett was speculative yet wistful.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you could help me."</p>

<p>"I should be very glad to try."</p>

<p>The music suddenly became more insistent. Jazz tunes were out
of fashion. People were flirting once more with the idea of
sentiment in their dances and flounces on their skirts. The
orchestra glided into the Blue Danube waltz and for a moment both
women were silent. The rhythm and flow of the melody seemed to
have become part of the atmosphere of the room. Clara's head
moved slightly to the music. The woman opposite listened but gave
no sign. She leaned across the table. The music was
enveloping.</p>

<p>"Four years ago," she confided, "I committed a crime. Since
then there has been fraud in everything I have done and said. The
whole of my life has been a lie. Now I think the time is coming
when I shall be found out."</p>

<p>The presiding spirit of Advice Limited listened intently. She
attempted no comment nor any gesture of sympathy. Nevertheless,
she never heard the music of the Blue Danube waltz again without
recalling that woman's voice with its sweet but terribly sad
undernote of misery.</p>

<p>"I suppose I knew," the latter went on, "that some day I
should be faced with this. I did the only wise thing. I closed my
ears and took the solace of the days as they passed. Now the time
is coming when I must pay and I am afraid."</p>

<p>The last bars of the music throbbed and glowed. The dancers
seemed to be making their supreme effort&mdash;round and
round&mdash;a medley of flying feet, of beautiful women and eager
men thrilled with the unusualness of the rapid movement. With a
triumphant burst it was all over. Then the clapping.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to come and talk to me about it all,"
Clara suggested, "Advice Limited is the name of the firm, you
know. My address and telephone number are in the book. I have a
funny little home and office combined close to the Adelphi
Terrace."</p>

<p>The woman's attention seemed to have wandered. She was engaged
in the thankless task of acknowledging salutations from the
passing crowds. She returned smile for smile, jest for jest when
acquaintances paused to say a word. Except for the natural
gravity of her features she was far from wearing her sorrows upon
her sleeve. Somehow or other Clara felt that she was the only
person in the world just then who could really divine the misery
of her beautiful <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether it would be of any use," the latter
murmured, with lips that scarcely moved. The interruptions
continued. The orchestra had started an ordinary fox trot and the
floor was more crowded. A woman who was evidently a personage of
consequence paused at the table.</p>

<p>"Patricia, my dear," she said. "How nice to see you about once
more. You know Lord Darrenmore, I'm sure&mdash;Mrs. Roy
Tremlett."</p>

<p>"At any rate I know Mrs. Roy Tremlett," the man assented with
a pleasant smile. "Mrs. Tremlett has deserted us all for so long
that I am afraid she has forgotten some of her friends."</p>

<p>She nodded graciously. She was quite mistress of herself and
the situation.</p>

<p>"There have been reasons," she reminded them quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh bosh!" the woman laughed. "Life is too short to bother
with such stupid things as reasons. Come and lunch one day,
Patricia. Any time. Half-past one-ish. Don't go back to the
country without letting us see something of you."</p>

<p>The two passed on. Mrs. Roy Tremlett's eyes followed them for
a moment.</p>

<p>"People are becoming more charitable, I think," she meditated.
"But then, of course, they don't know everything. They have no
idea why I have been driven to live the life of a hermit."</p>

<p>"One is always foolish, I think," Clara ventured, "to imagine
oneself prejudged."</p>

<p>The other shook her head.</p>

<p>"I was never afraid of people being unkind to me for the
obvious reason," she confided. "I only did openly what most of
them do in secret. Not that that makes people more charitable as
a rule. A woman who is concealing her own sin is generally the
hardest upon the others who have been found out.... Isn't anyone
coming back to our table, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Clara looked around the room.</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to have so many friends," she pointed out.
"Lady Hannah and the Duke are talking to some people over in the
corner. The Treshams have joined up with the Coningsbys for a
time but they are coming back. The others seem to be still
dancing."</p>

<p>"If I don't tell you now," the woman said, "I think that I
shall never tell you. This is such a wonderful setting for a
confession. Lights and music, sinners all around us, not a single
grave, disapproving face.... Four years ago I sinned to save my
life. I sinned because if I had not I would have died from what
no one believes in&mdash;a broken heart."</p>

<p>"You are talking of something which I do not understand,"
Clara reminded her quietly.</p>

<p>"You know who I am, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"You may have read my case. It really doesn't matter. It was a
very ordinary one&mdash;a woman's stupid impulse and the
irretrievable disaster. It was the Judge's last ruling which
plunged me into hell. He gave my husband the custody of my
child."</p>

<p>The leader of the orchestra, who was swift always to gauge the
inclination of his clients, looked around the room and saw few
people dancing. The fox trot came to an end. Even whilst people
were loitering on the floor there crept out into the room the
first bars of a very sad and very haunting melody which had
supplied the motif for one of the most successful productions of
the day. It flowed with smooth and effortless facility from the
shivering strings of the famous chef d'orchestre's violin and it
brought men and women half unwillingly onto their feet. Mrs. Roy
Tremlett, absorbed apparently in some poignant memories of her
own, listened for a while in silence. Then she turned back to her
companion. The other places at the table were still
unoccupied.</p>

<p>"I was fond of my husband," she confided. "I had, indeed, a
great affection for him, but even he was always second to my
child. As for the man with whom I ran away&mdash;well, I will not
speak of my feelings for him. Some people in the world thought
that I was treated leniently. The husband whom I had left settled
a fortune upon me, although I was already a rich woman. The man
with whom I played the absurd jest of eloping offered me the
shelter of his name. Neither of those things mattered. I had
forgotten that they could take the child."</p>

<p>The music was throbbing through the tangled atmosphere of the
place. One had dim visions of a broken-hearted woman bending over
a murdered man, with agony in her face and pain clawing at her
heart-strings. At the further end of the room where the music was
not so insistent there was still the hum of conversation
punctuated with laughter, the clatter of dishes and the popping
of corks. From the dance floor, close to which Clara and her
companion were seated, came the fluttering of skirts, the sliding
of smooth-soled shoes over the polished floor. People were
dancing differently, however. There was none of the joy and
abandon of the earlier waltz. The dancers seemed to be moving in
a mist of sentiment. One man who missed his step hurried his
partner shame-facedly from the floor as though he had made a
discord for which there could be no atonement.... All the time
Patricia Tremlett talked.</p>

<p>"I did not get very far with my life of sin, as I suppose it
would be called. It was in Tours, fortyeight hours after I had
left London, that I heard a child cry. I heard it again at the
hotel in the night. It was a cry of real distress, with just that
touch of surprise in it which comes from a child who is too young
to understand pain but who is hurt.... The next morning I had the
news from my lawyer about Rosalind. I found a plane and flew
home. I made cautious enquiries. I found that Rosalind was
expected at Oxenden Castle, where my husband's father and mother
lived, in ten days' time upon their return from Canada. She was
still at Chandeleyes, our own place, with her governess."</p>

<p>The last chords of the music had died away. Clara found
Roderigo at her elbow.</p>

<p>"To me it seems too sad, that 'Bitter Sweet,'" he said. "You
like me to ask them to play 'Franchese' and we dance?"</p>

<p>She waved him away.</p>

<p>"Not just yet," she begged. "Dance with Marian Howells,
please, and don't disturb us. I will come out some night soon and
dance all the time with you."</p>

<p>Roderigo had the Latin quickness of apprehension and he at
once effaced himself. The altered tone of the music seemed to
have changed the whole atmosphere, but across those few feet of
table with the bowl of sweet-smelling yellow roses between them
Clara felt as though she and her companion were enclosed in a
chamber with steel walls.</p>

<p>"That was a terrible week," the woman who was making her
confession went on. "I went to all the institutions I could hear
of, those awful institutions where lost children are brought up.
Nowhere could I find anyone in the least like Rosalind. One day,
driving back to the rooms where I was living secretly in London,
in one of the suburbs I saw a child playng outside a small villa.
I stopped the car. I spoke to the child. I was wild with hope.
She seemed to have even Rosalind's mannerisms and she was exactly
her age&mdash;three years old. I saw the mother. She laughed at
me. At first she declared that she would not part with her child
for any consideration. She asked me into the house, however, and
I saw that she had other children&mdash;a large family&mdash;and
I could see too that she was poor. When I mentioned money there
was hunger in her eyes. I pointed to those other children. I told
her how well she could dress them all and feed them and bring
them up by just parting with one. I gave her a great deal more
money even than I had promised and she was happy and content. I
did not tell her my name. She did not ask it. I went and fetched
her the money. I took away the child."</p>

<p>There was a brief pause whilst the music sang in their ears.
Then she went on.</p>

<p>"The scheme worked out perfectly and the children were
changed. The child who has been living at Oxenden Castle as my
daughter&mdash;mine and his&mdash; came from that little villa.
She has puzzled them all there more than once but they have been
in Canada nearly all the time since Rosalind was born and no one
seems to have suspected. Rosalind and I went abroad. When we came
home I said that I had been to India and had brought home one of
my sister's children, but I kept out of sight of everyone and I
lived in strange places on the Continent where few English people
go. We have been almost happy, except that I have always had one
fear. I have kept it in the background. Now it has come. After
four years of wandering my husband is home. He wrote to his
mother to say that it was the child who had called him back."</p>

<p>"But after all," Clara reflected, "your sin has not been so
terrible. You were guilty of contempt of court and in the eyes of
the law you kidnapped another woman's child. You did so, however,
with its mother's consent and the child herself must, by-theby,
have had a marvellous time brought up at Oxenden Castle with all
sorts of advantages in life she never could have had otherwise.
Besides, how are you any nearer being found out?"</p>

<p>The woman shivered slightly.</p>

<p>"Norman will know," she said. "He was very fond of Rosalind.
The moment he hears that other child speak he will know. If they
take her away from me now&mdash;well, I am not a sentimentalist.
It is nothing to say that I shall die. What I am afraid of is
pain. Like we heard just now in that music. Pain tearing at the
heart. That is what will live with me for ever if they take her
away."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is your husband?" Clara asked.</p>

<p>"Too good for me," the other sighed. "I admired him&mdash;I
loved him when he gave me Rosalind&mdash;but he is stern. Right
and wrong&mdash;he knows no middle course. He is generous in
nearly all his instincts, but he never learnt to forgive. My
breathless search of those institutions, my taking away a child
from its mother&mdash;however willing she may have been&mdash;the
whole course of deceit and falsehoods connected with the child's
bringing up, will appall him. I would take Rosalind and escape if
I could, but it is too late. The news of his return to England
was in all the papers the day before yesterday. By this time he
will have been down to Gloucestershire."</p>

<p>The restaurant seemed stirred into fresh activity. The theatre
crowd was beginning to arrive for supper and rapidly filled up
the places of the retiring diners. The music became livelier in
tone. Two new young men joined Lady Hannah's party but Clara
steadily refused to dance.</p>

<p>"Go on helping me, please," she begged Roderigo, who was once
more hovering round in attendance.</p>

<p>"You shall have all the evenings you want and all the dances
you want later in the week, but leave us alone now."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a whimsical contortion of the face. Mrs.
Roy Tremlett's attention had been momentarily claimed by a
passer-by.</p>

<p>"Another case?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"I am not sure. I wish that it might be."</p>

<p>Roderigo became brisk and tactful. Clara and her <i>vis-&agrave;-
vis</i> were again left alone at their end of the table.</p>

<p>"Well, now you know everything," the latter said.</p>

<p>"You know more than I have told anyone on earth. I have
carried along alone almost to breaking point. Now I feel that I
must have counsel. I cannot tell you why, but to-night I have a
presentiment. I feel as though the whole thing were coming
crashing about me, as though something were going to
happen&mdash;dramatic&mdash;final&mdash;at once. I never dreamed
that I could have asked a stranger for help but with you somehow
it seems different. I feel that the crisis may arrive at any
moment. I should not be surprised even to see policemen upon the
threshold here. Tell me what I am to do. Tell me some way in
which I can keep Rosalind," she wound up with a little sob in her
throat.</p>

<p>"There are three possibilities which might affect the
situation," her adviser reflected. "Your husband may
not&mdash;even if he is puzzled&mdash;decide offhand that the
Rosalind at Oxenden Castle is not his child."</p>

<p>"Useless," the other sighed. "Norman is a strange creature. He
will know."</p>

<p>"Another idea, of course, is that you leave England to-morrow,
go to some quiet place, say, in the Black Forest, and leave
someone here in whom you can trust to let you know what
happens."</p>

<p>"Norman would follow me. He has always been a great hunter of
game. He could hunt men or women just as well. I have heard him
say so."</p>

<p>"Then you could try a complete bluff," Clara suggested.
"Especially if you can get your sister in India to help. You
could declare that Rosalind is indeed your niece whom you brought
to England to take care of."</p>

<p>"Norman will know his child just as I should."</p>

<p>"You must remember this," Clara pointed out.</p>

<p>"Your husband certainly will not want to see you in the dock
for kidnapping or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave off, for the love of God!" her companion faltered.
"Don't speak to me for a moment. Don't leave me, though. Don't
let anyone go away."</p>

<p>Clara filled a glass with water and passed it to her
neighbour. Then she looked down the room towards the entrance. A
man was approaching them who was a stranger to her. He had
something of the air of a man about town, something of the air of
a hard-riding country squire. He was well set up, florid, with
large shapely features a little coarsened. He received with every
step he took a salvo of greetings. Somehow or other Clara was
quite sure that this was not Mrs. Roy Tremlett's husband. An
instinct prompted her to look around for Roderigo. He obeyed her
gesture and sank into the vacant place between her and her
neighbour. They know a great deal at the Legation Club and the
maitre d'hotel who was steering his client through the room tried
his hardest to direct him to a table in a distant corner. The
newcomer would have none of it, however. He paused in front of
Mrs. Roy Tremlett and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"No ill feeling, Patricia," he said good humouredly. "Shake
hands."</p>

<p>She gave him the tips of her fingers. Lady Hannah leaned over.
There was a wicked little gleam in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Johnnie, by all that's wonderful!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And no frost, either! How did you tear yourself away from
Leicestershire?"</p>

<p>"Business," he replied. "Regimental dinner as a matter of
fact. So dull I cut it short. Fancy seeing all you people
again."</p>

<p>There was a brief but somehow noticeable silence. Any pleasure
the newcomer might have felt from this rencontre with old friends
was obviously not shared by the others. Mrs. Roy Tremlett's voice
was cold and stony.</p>

<p>"You doubtless have many friends here, John," she said. "I
think you had better go and find them."</p>

<p>Something that was almost a scowl disfigured his good-looking
face.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he announced, "I wanted a few words
with you."</p>

<p>"You certainly will not have them here," she assured him, "or
anywhere else. You can write."</p>

<p>"You know that your husband is in London?"</p>

<p>"Wherever he is I don't wish to discuss him with you."</p>

<p>The Duke leaned forward in his place. His tone was gentle and
courteous enough but there was in it an underlying note almost of
menace.</p>

<p>"I think, if you will excuse me," he said&mdash;"I am one of
the hosts of this party&mdash;I would suggest that you leave us.
Your presence, you see," he went on with a smile, "is not
agreeable to one of my guests."</p>

<p>The newcomer frowned sombrely.</p>

<p>"And who might you be?" he demanded. Lady Hannah intervened
and there was enough of warning in her lazy tone.</p>

<p>"I think you had better go, John," she advised.</p>

<p>"I don't want to stay where I am not wanted," was the surly
reply. "So long as you tell me to go that's all right. I'm not
going to be ordered off, though, by a confounded Dago."</p>

<p>There was a strange fluttering silence. Even the music seemed
to become indistinguishable. Everyone was holding his breath.</p>

<p>"You are behaving like a ploughboy, John," Lady Hannah told
him severely. "You are a disgrace to any civilised society. This
gentleman is the Duke Roderigo de Partagena de Cervera y Topete.
I do not introduce you because I think he would scarcely care to
add you to his list of acquaintances."</p>

<p>"If Sir John," Roderigo said very quietly, "cares to repeat
the word he used just now at any time when there are no ladies
present it would give me great pleasure&mdash;the greatest
pleasure in fact&mdash;to deal with him."</p>

<p>The manager, with his very tall commissionaire, was drifting
up the room. Sir John swung round on his heel and without a word
of farewell to anyone took his leave. Mrs. Roy Tremlett turned to
Clara. Roderigo and Lady Hannah had glided into temporary
obscurity.</p>

<p>"My trouble," Mrs. Tremlett confided bitterly, "develops of
its own accord. Soon you will know all of it without a word from
me. Sir John Mitchell was the man I ran away with for twenty-four
hours. He has not very much money. He knows my secret. He is
trying to blackmail me. He proposes to tell my husband."</p>

<p>"What a beast!" Clara exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Roy Tremlett sighed.</p>

<p>"He is a beast," she admitted. "The fact remains, though, that
he is very popular with his own sex."</p>

<p>"As a rule that is a good sign."</p>

<p>Her companion shook her head.</p>

<p>"I always distrust it now. 'The well-known sporting Baronet'
the papers call him, and you see for yourself how everyone greets
him.... Oh, I know what you are thinking, of course. You are
wondering how on earth I could have made such a fool of
myself."</p>

<p>"I am never surprised at anything of that sort," Clara
admitted. "A thing just happens and that is all there is about
it."</p>

<p>"Things are happening to-night anyhow," Mrs. Roy Tremlett
observed. "With a very little more help from events you will have
my case set out and be able to give me your advice. There is one
word, perhaps, I should not have used," she went on after a
moment's pause. "The word blackmail. It is what it comes to
indirectly but what I meant, of course, was that Sir John is
trying to use this secret as a means of making me go back to
him."</p>

<p>"So he wants you back?"</p>

<p>"Not from any personal feeling. I think he was fed up with me
before we got to Calais. It is his vanity that has been hurt.
Besides, to live with a wealthy woman, as I unfortunately am,
would make life a different thing for him. He has been
extravagant and he has very little beyond his pension."</p>

<p>"It does not seem to me," Clara reflected, "that he is a very
important factor in the case. You say that your husband is
certain to know at once that the child who has been living with
his father and mother is not Rosalind. If he is going to find it
out for himself Sir John does not matter, even if he has guessed
the truth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Roy Tremlett agreed.</p>

<p>"Norman will know," she declared. "He may know now. That is
why I am half beside myself. I may hear from him or the lawyer at
any moment. He will have no mercy. He won't come near me. He will
apply to the courts. I shall be charged with kidnapping the other
child and he will take Rosalind away from me."</p>

<p>"That sounds rather inhuman," Clara murmured.</p>

<p>"From his point of view it would not be inhumanity. It would
be according to his sense of justice."</p>

<p>It was Lady Hannah who threw the next and the final bombshell.
She broke off a dance and hurried up to them.</p>

<p>"My dear Patricia," she said, resting her hand upon her
friend's shoulder, "I am afraid you are having a rotten party.
Too bad, too, after your making such an effort to come. I felt I
must tell you, though&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me what?"</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together, there's a dear. Now look towards the
entrance."</p>

<p>A tall, slim man, sunburnt and of soldierly bearing, having
somehow the air&mdash;notwithstanding the correctness of his
attire&mdash;of one strange to such places, was almost surrounded
at the further end of the room by men who had left their places
to shake hands with him. Mrs. Roy Tremlett laughed unnaturally as
a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, after a few moments' delay, ushered him
towards a small table in the corner at the extreme end of the
restaurant.</p>

<p>"I am past sensation," she said tonelessly. "I can feel
nothing. I suppose I ought to faint. Tell the Baroness who he is,
Hannah."</p>

<p>"That is Colonel Roy Tremlett," Lady Hannah confided. "This
must be his first appearance in London for years and what on
earth he is doing here I cannot imagine, except that it used to
be his favourite place when he went anywhere."</p>

<p>"Do you want to get away?" Clara asked her neighbour.</p>

<p>The latter shook her head.</p>

<p>"What is the use?" she asked sadly. "Besides, there is such a
crowd here to-night that very likely he will never see me."</p>

<p>Clara who, although she was kind-hearted, was seldom affected
in that way, felt a sudden wave of intense sympathy. She was
physiognomist enough to divine how much the woman by her side was
suffering. For the moment she felt moisture in her own eyes.</p>

<p>The lonely man at the other end of the room who had refused
all his friends' invitations to join them rose to his feet at the
approach of a young lady who was a perfect stranger to him. His
attitude was courteous but reserved.</p>

<p>"I don't think that I have the pleasure, have I?" he said,
looking at Clara doubtfully. "I have been away from London for
some years so you must forgive me if I am mistaken."</p>

<p>"You don't know me, Colonel Roy Tremlett,"</p>

<p>Clara acknowledged, "but the Duque Roderigo de Partagena, with
whom I was dancing, pointed you out to me."</p>

<p>"I am not quite forgotten, I hope, Colonel," Roderigo said,
advancing from the background and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"I remember you quite well," was the courteous reply. "You
played for the Harlequins in my polo days. I was afraid that I
should not find you in London after all this trouble in your
country."</p>

<p>"This is the safer place," Roderigo remarked.</p>

<p>"My partner, Colonel, permits me to present you. This is
Colonel Roy Tremlett&mdash;the Baroness Linz."</p>

<p>"May I sit down and talk to you for a minute?" Clara
asked.</p>

<p>Colonel Roy Tremlett was taken by surprise. The Duke, however,
made the situation inevitable.</p>

<p>"We will finish the dance later," he said, with a little bow
to his companion as he slipped away through the crowd....</p>

<p>Clara took the vacant place at the table although she was
fully conscious of her new companion's lack of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You are sure that you are not making some mistake?" he asked
in a tone of polite restraint. "As we are complete strangers I
can think of no subject&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't," Clara interrupted. "I am doing a very
unconventional thing, I know, but I am taking a mean advantage of
my sex and exerting one of my privileges. You see, I am a
professional interferer in other people's business."</p>

<p>"A most undesirable calling, I should think," was the coldly
spoken comment.</p>

<p>"Do you mind looking at me for a moment, please?" she
begged.</p>

<p>He turned his head unwillingly but in a very few seconds his
resentment was lessened. There were many people who had called
Clara a beautiful young woman but there were perhaps few who
realised that apart from her beautifully curved mouth, her steady
truthful eyes, the fine shape of her head and her untouched
complexion the greatest charm which she possessed was her intense
humanity. She was looking at him very earnestly and with an
almost beseeching light in her hazel eyes. Involuntarily the
stiffness of his manner softened. This, at any rate, was a very
charming young lady and apparently of a serious frame of
mind.</p>

<p>"You have asked me to do a dangerous thing, Baroness," he said
in a distinctly altered tone. "I find you very pleasant to look
at, I believe that you are serious and you don't look like the
type of young woman who would interfere unbidden in other
people's concerns. Please say what you wish and I will
listen."</p>

<p>"That is so nice of you," she acknowledged with a sigh of
relief. "I have just been talking to your wife."</p>

<p>"My wife," he repeated slowly, and there was already a danger
signal in the flash of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes. Your wife&mdash;who spends every moment of her life
regretting one stupid impulse. It was nothing but sheer
stupidity. You ought to know that. She ran away with a man whom
she learnt to dislike thoroughly in less than twenty-four hours.
The day she heard that she had lost her child she left him and
started back for London. She has never seen the man since until
to-night."</p>

<p>"Until to-night," Colonel Roy Tremlett repeated coldly. "That
appears to be somewhat of a coincidence. What did he want?"</p>

<p>"What he is always wanting. To insist upon her going back to
him. He is even mean enough to threaten her that unless she does
so he will disclose what he calls her secret."</p>

<p>"Rather like the fellow," was the scornful comment. "She need
not be influenced by that. She has no secret."</p>

<p>"You have been down to Gloucestershire?"</p>

<p>"I went down yesterday. I came back to-day."</p>

<p>"And you discovered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I discovered," he interrupted, "that she had palmed off upon
my father and mother a child which was neither hers nor
mine."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>He moved uneasily in his place.</p>

<p>"I have done nothing for the moment," he admitted. "There is
an absurd complication. My father and mother are old people. They
had seen very little of Rosalind so they accepted her substitute
without hesitation and they have become devoted to the child.
They thought me heartless because I came away so soon."</p>

<p>"And now what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied bitterly. "What does a man
generally do who has been doubly deceived by bis wife? Shall I
come to you for advice, Baroness? Is your fee very
prohibitive?"</p>

<p>She suddenly laid her hand upon his and pressed his strong
muscular fingers. Being utterly unused to such gestures he felt
to its utmost degree the thrill of sympathy which she intended to
convey.</p>

<p>"I wish that you would," she said, "because I know just as
surely as I know that you are here by my side that I could give
you the best advice in the world for which you would be grateful
all your life. Why do you suppose your wife ever became a
criminal&mdash;kidnapped another child&mdash;so that she could
keep Rosalind&mdash;yours and hers? Because she loved her. Why do
you suppose that she left the man with whom she made that idiotic
mistake after little more than twenty-four hours? Because she
cared for you and loathed what she was doing. Think of what her
life has been since&mdash;hiding in different parts of Europe,
hiding from her friends and strangers alike, anyone who might
have discovered her real identity. She has had no pleasures.
Nothing else in life has counted. It was just to keep the
child&mdash;your child. You know so well why she did that. If
not, she is longing to tell you."</p>

<p>His fingers were twitching upon the tablecloth. He was looking
across the room with unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>"If only one could believe," he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>She made a sign to Roderigo whom some instinct had kept
hovering near all the time. He was away across the room in a
moment.</p>

<p>"Life would be a more terrible thing than it is,"</p>

<p>Clara continued softly, "if we had not the courage sometimes
to admit our mistakes, if we let one false step poison the rest
of our days and the days of those who were really dear to us
because we were proud, because the little things seemed a great
deal to us and the big things nothing. My advice&mdash;well, it
is coming."</p>

<p>As the woman whom he had been escorting paused at the table
Roderigo slipped once more into the background. Colonel Roy
Tremlett rose slowly to his feet. At that moment there were many
others besides Clara and himself who thought that Patricia at
that supreme moment of her life was surely the most beautiful
woman in the world. Her eyes, fixed upon her husband's, were
tender, glowing, beseeching. He bent forward and raised her
trembling fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>"Patricia," he said, "they tell me that Rosalind is in
London."</p>

<p>"She is with me," his wife faltered, "in Curzon Street."</p>

<p>"I have been looking forward to seeing her so much," he
whispered. "Would your friends excuse you if we went home
early?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Roy Tremlett said nothing but her mouth was terribly
eloquent. Words would have been a risk. She laid her fingers
lightly upon his shoulder as they passed into the crush and out
of the room, oblivious of the kindly curiosity, almost
excitement, which they were causing amongst their friends....
Clara threw herself back in her seat and laughed long and
hysterically.</p>

<p>"You amuse yourself?" Roderigo murmured.</p>

<p>"They have forgotten me," she confided, wiping her eyes for
other than the obvious reasons. "They have gone away without
paying my fee!"</p>

<h2><a id="story9" name="story9">IX. &mdash; A FAMILY
MISUNDERSTANDING</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE BARONESS, with several cases upon her hands
and an increasing stream of callers, found it necessary to engage
a clerk secretary. Miss Marlowe, whom from amongst many
applicants she finally selected, was a colourless young woman,
neat and precise in her methods and speech. She wore spectacles
and looked at life seriously. She permitted herself the faintest
possible frown of disapproval one sunny afternoon when her
employer came back from lunch an hour later than her usual time,
smoking a cigarette and carrying a large bunch of violets.</p>

<p>"A Mrs. Rentoul is waiting to see you, Baroness," she
announced. "She was in the book for half past three and she came
punctually."</p>

<p>Clara threw away her cigarette, handed the violets over to her
secretary and seated herself at the table.</p>

<p>"I forgot all about her," she confessed. "What does she
want?"</p>

<p>"'Urgent private business' was all that she said in her
letter."</p>

<p>"Well, arrange those violets for me, there's a good girl, and
show her in."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rentoul made due appearance. During her few words of
apology Clara studied her&mdash;casually at first and afterwards
with more interest. She was a pretty woman of the fluffy order, a
blonde of the type that goes "off" early in life, a trifle sharp-
featured and with a querulous look in her blue eyes. She seated
herself nervously.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter about your being late in the least," she
declared. "I was really rather glad of a change of atmosphere. My
husband and I don't go out much. We live in West
Kensington&mdash;I don't suppose you know much about that part of
the world."</p>

<p>"I know it quite well," Clara assured her. "I had rooms there
myself once. Now please tell me what you want to see me about,"
she added pleasantly. The woman in the chair seemed perturbed.
She was of the type who would have talked foolishly for half an
hour or more before coming to the business on hand.</p>

<p>"I want to ask your advice," she began hesitatingly. "They
tell me that you are very clever."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. If I can help you of course I shall be
glad. What's it all about?"</p>

<p>"My husband," Flora Rentoul confided, "is trying to poison
me."</p>

<p>Clara looked across the table with upraised eyebrows. The
woman was obviously very much in earnest. The blue veins in her
forehead and on the backs of her hands showed more clearly. Her
eyes, which some time must have been beautiful, were sunken and
lit with sombre fears. The fluffiness had gone. She was very much
afraid.</p>

<p>"Lately," she continued, "I have not felt well. I thought at
first it might have been something else, but it isn't. My husband
gives me some medicine which he makes up when he's by himself in
the surgery. He watches while I take the doses and then nobody
knows what becomes of the bottle."</p>

<p>"Is your husband a doctor?" Clara asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Rentoul assented. "He has quite a good practice,
but he works very hard and he will never take even a day's
holiday."</p>

<p>The genius of Advice Limited studied her client briefly. She
was obviously both hysterical and unreliable and it was just
possible, of course, that her present condition might be due to
nervous fear.</p>

<p>"Let's talk about this for a short time," Clara suggested.
"What makes you think that he is trying to poison you? Don't you
get on well together?"</p>

<p>"I thought so until lately," the woman answered.</p>

<p>"He seemed to take a dislike to me about a year ago&mdash;
soon after my sister came back from Paris."</p>

<p>"Is your sister younger than you or older?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen years younger," was the bitter reply.</p>

<p>"She is very pretty&mdash;far prettier than ever I was. I used
to look something like her. I never shall again. I believe that
George&mdash;George is my husband&mdash; looks at her and thinks
of me, how faded I am since those days."</p>

<p>"And you believe that is why he is trying to poison you?"</p>

<p>"I can't think of anything else."</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you what I think," Clara said sternly but
cheerfully. "I think you are a very foolish, imaginative woman, a
little run down in health and very much given to fancying things.
Your husband would not dare to do anything of the sort. Nowadays
poisoners are always found out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rentoul shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"Why am I so ill then?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean when you say ill? What are your
symptoms?"</p>

<p>The visitor hesitated.</p>

<p>"I have lost my appetite," she confided, "and when I do eat
anything I am generally sick afterwards. I have headaches and
giddy fits and every few days I have a temperature."</p>

<p>"That does not sound very good," Clara confessed.</p>

<p>"Will you go to my doctor and ask him what's the matter with
you? You need not give your name. He probably would not recognise
it even if you did, though. Say that I sent you and give him
permission to answer any questions I ask him afterwards."</p>

<p>"Supposing he tells me that I am being poisoned, what can I
do?" she asked pitifully.</p>

<p>"Come back and tell me and I will give you my advice," Clara
promised her. "I only want to make sure that you are not
mistaken."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rentoul took her leave. She was very nervous and she left
first her handbag and then her umbrella behind her. Finally she
went off. Clara remained looking after her thoughtfully. Then she
rang the bell for Miss Marlowe.</p>

<p>"Miss Marlowe," she said, "the lady who has just gone out must
have been in with you for some time. What did you think of
her?"</p>

<p>Miss Marlowe took the question, as she did everything in life,
seriously.</p>

<p>"At first," she confessed, "I thought she was ordinary. Hers
is such a very usual suburban type. Afterwards I became more
interested in her. It seemed to me that she had either had a
great shock or she was living in fear."</p>

<p>Clara nodded.</p>

<p>"I had the same idea," she admitted. "Let me know if she comes
again. Anyone else waiting?"</p>

<p>"One gentleman. He said he would rather not give his name but
he would not detain you for long."</p>

<p>"Does he look as though he had anything to sell?" Clara
asked.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," was the prompt reply. "He said that he
wished to consult you. He seems to be quite a gentleman."</p>

<p>Clara had the same idea when her visitor was ushered in. He
was rather more formally dressed than was the fashion amongst
young men of his age, but he had a pleasant though hard face and
his voice was agreeable. His mouth, with its upturned lines, was
its least attractive feature.</p>

<p>"You are the Baroness Linz who conducts this establishment?"
he asked with a little bow. She pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>"I am," she confessed. "Do you mind telling me your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Rentoul&mdash;Dr. Rentoul."</p>

<p>It said a good deal for Clara's power of self control that she
refrained from a start. Probably, however, her visitor would not
have noticed it, for he was slowly removing his gloves and
folding them together.</p>

<p>"I have come to you on rather a queer errand, Baroness," he
said, "but I have been a great deal worried lately and I need
advice. Sometimes advice comes better from a stranger who is not
prejudiced by knowing the people concerned."</p>

<p>"It is my business to give it when I can," Clara remarked.
"What sort of trouble are you in?"</p>

<p>"My wife," Dr. Rentoul confided, "is trying to poison
herself."</p>

<p>"Your wife&mdash;poison herself!" Clara repeated
bewildered.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"After all, it is not so very extraordinary," he said.</p>

<p>"Women have made idiots of themselves in the same fashion
before. The only thing is my wife has not a shadow of a motive
and I cannot think what she is doing it for."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask her?" Clara demanded. "If you are sure of
what you say there is no use making a mystery of the matter."</p>

<p>"That is commonsense, of course," he admitted.</p>

<p>"But you don't know my wife. She was always a nervous woman
and lately she has been absolutely unbalanced. At present she is
taking poison in very small quantities. I believe that if I asked
her what she was doing it for she would take a treble dose and
end the thing at once."</p>

<p>"You can't take her away for a time?"</p>

<p>"How can I?" he replied. "I have had four years' struggle to
establish a practice and I have just turned the corner. I have a
dozen new patients&mdash;all very important people&mdash;and to
leave just now would ruin my chances. Besides, to be frank, I
could not afford it."</p>

<p>"Where does your wife get her poison from?"</p>

<p>"God knows! Not from my surgery. That's certain. I keep all
the dangerous bottles securely locked up. They are never touched
or disturbed yet two or three times a week she takes a dose,
fortunately I should judge a very small one, of something which
is absolutely virulent."</p>

<p>"And you don't know where she gets it from?"</p>

<p>"I have not the least idea. By using my name and showing my
card she might easily succeed in getting anything if she went
about it the right way."</p>

<p>"You have not any idea where she keeps this poison?"</p>

<p>"I have searched her room, I have sent her out and even gone
through her wardrobe and private cabinet," the doctor confided.
"I have not succeeded in finding a trace of anything. She must
keep it in the house, but where&mdash;heaven knows!"</p>

<p>"Exactly what do you want me to do for you?"</p>

<p>Clara asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," he confessed. "To tell you the truth I
thought you might have something to suggest yourself."</p>

<p>"Do you know of any cause for unhappiness or anxiety which
might be depressing your wife?"</p>

<p>"Before heaven, I don't," he replied earnestly.</p>

<p>"Two years ago things were not going so well with me. Money
was short and housekeeping was hard. Today everything is on the
mend. We are able to keep two more servants, Flora is able to
entertain her family as often as she likes and she has her own
small car, besides mine when it is not in use. I cannot get away
much myself, but I do make a point of taking her to the theatre
sometimes and she has a great many friends."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Clara decided, after a moment's reflection,
"that you will have to risk demanding an explanation from her.
Tell her that you, as a doctor, have seen signs of some
particular drug in her complexion or her eyes, or something or
other. Find out, too, if there is anything on her mind which she
has kept secret from you."</p>

<p>"It will be a terrible risk," he sighed.</p>

<p>"I cannot see what else you can do. You say her people live
close at hand. Couldn't you confide in one of them and get them
to watch her so that she has not an opportunity of taking this
poison? You can be frank with them. You can tell them it is an
ordinary drug some chemist has recommended which is bad for her
system. Could you not arrange that one of them didn't leave her
side for a few days? Perhaps if she discontinued using it she
would become more normal and you could talk to her yourself."</p>

<p>He pondered for a few moments looking down at the toe of his
shoe.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "there's Maisie, of course. She is in and out
a good deal and she might stay in the house if she were asked.
The worst of it is she's such a child. The other sister is
married and in India and her mother is an invalid."</p>

<p>"How old is this sister whom you call Maisie?"</p>

<p>"About nineteen, I should think. If one could get her to
realise how serious the thing is perhaps she might stick around,
but she is such a scatter-brained young woman that I'm afraid it
would be difficult to make her understand the importance of never
leaving her sister."</p>

<p>"Unless you take my first advice," Clara said, "I don't see
what else you can do but trust your sisterin-law. The more I
think of it the more I am convinced, however, that what you
should do is to risk having an understanding yourself."</p>

<p>"If I knew where she hides that damned drug," he declared
savagely, "I would do it. As it is I daren't. Think&mdash;there
are certain patients I must see every day, especially just now.
She knows when I have to go. Very well. She could do anything she
wanted to in my absence. You look incredulous, Baroness. You
don't believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him gently.</p>

<p>"I believe everything you say," she assured him with a mental
reservation, "but I cannot conceive for myself a woman who is
your wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has been for ten years," he put in.</p>

<p>"?&mdash;for ten years who, if you went to her affectionately,
praying her to tell you what was troubling her, charged her with
what she was doing, told her that she was making you terribly
unhappy&mdash; No, I cannot believe that it would not have the
right effect."</p>

<p>"Look here," Rentoul proposed. "You will excuse my referring
to the subject, Baroness, but we doctors get a bit hardened about
fees. If you will let me pay you for coming I wish you would dine
with us one night&mdash;soon&mdash;at once. Let me introduce you
as a new patient or a friend of my brother's, whom you have met
during a visit to India and who asked you to look me up when in
London. We can easily manage that. I will get some of her own
people there if I can and you can watch her. You will tell me
afterwards whether you think I dare tackle her, remembering, mind
you, that I shall have to leave her alone either the next
morning, if I do it at night, or within an hour or so if I do it
in the daytime&mdash;and she knows where she keeps that filthy
drug and I don't."</p>

<p>"Fix your night," Clara promised, "and if I am disengaged I
will come."</p>

<p>"You fix the night," he begged. "We none of us have any
engagements."</p>

<p>"I could come next Friday."</p>

<p>"At eight o'clock. Number Twenty-nine Chiltern Terrace. I will
just think it out and let you know exactly what to say about my
brother before then."</p>

<p>He took up his hat and left. Clara remained at her desk for a
few minutes reflecting upon this new experience. If only she
could divine the meaning of those upward lines around Dr.
Rentoul's mouth and the reason why, during the whole of his
visit, he had persisted in talking with his eyes fixed upon the
carpet!</p>

<p>Clara, during those few uneasy moments before the announcement
of dinner at Chiltern Terrace on the following Friday, found it
hard to believe that she was at close quarters with tragedy.
Flora Rentoul, with a moderate use of the standard cosmetics,
seemed to have recovered her poise and her looks. She was really,
if not beautiful, a very attractive and pretty woman as she stood
on the hearthrug talking to Colonel Singleton, her father.
Rentoul, handing round luke-warm cocktails with a faintly
apologetic air and exchanging chaff with Phillip Porter, his
sister-in-law's fiance, seemed to have left all his anxieties
behind him. The only emotion which Clara had perceived and which
she, in fact, shared followed upon the entrance of Maisie, Mrs.
Rentoul's sister. For a moment the visitor even forgot to shake
hands. It was only when she realised the interrogation in the
girl's eyes that she pulled herself together.</p>

<p>"Do forgive me," she begged. "But you know you rather took my
breath away."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me why?" Maisie asked.</p>

<p>"I am a much older woman so I can say so," was the smiling
reply. "I honestly think that you are the most beautiful creature
I have ever seen in my life."</p>

<p>Maisie laughed gaily. Something of her former frozen
expression came back to Flora Rentoul's face. Her husband, with
the cocktail tray still in his hand, was apparently mildly
amused.</p>

<p>"Don't let her turn your head, child," he enjoined.</p>

<p>"Not I," she laughed. "All the same I like people to admire
me. It does me good with Phillip. It makes him appreciate me
properly."</p>

<p>Later on Clara found herself studying the girl curiously. Her
pink and white complexion was absolutely perfect. There was not a
line or a wrinkle anywhere in her face. Her hair was a very
light, almost platinum gold. Her deep brown eyes were set far
back in her head and her eyebrows were of a much darker shade.
Her mouth was of the rosebud type but it also possessed the
saving grace of a humorous curl when she laughed, and she laughed
a great deal.</p>

<p>There was no trace of guile at any time in her expression or
her speech. In Clara's judgment she seemed to be a perfectly
natural and happy young woman enjoying every moment of life. She
went in to dinner with her arm round her fiance's neck and,
although Clara possessed to the full the knack of watching people
without herself being observed, she could only come to the
conclusion that nothing whatever in the shape of an understanding
existed between her and her brother-in-law. The latter in his own
home was a very different man from the gloomy, almost dramatic
figure he had presented in the Adam Street office. He exchanged a
few carefully prepared remarks with his guest concerning the life
and tastes of his brother in Bombay, his attitude towards Maisie
was entirely careless and fraternal and each time he addressed
his wife there was a note of pleasant consideration in his tone.
Flora Rentoul herself talked very little. She spoke now and then
on unimportant subjects to her sister's fiance, who sat on one
side, and occasionally to her father, who sat on the other.
Watching her with almost meticulous closeness Clara was conscious
of a certain lack of animation in her face and a lifelessness in
her tone. Nothing that she did or said seemed altogether natural,
yet to outward appearance she was the gracious and comely hostess
and her ignoring of the occasional mistakes of the one servant
who waited at table might well have been put down to good
breeding rather than indifference. Only once there was a gleam of
real feeling in her blue eyes and that, curiously enough, was
when her husband&mdash;to supplement the indifferent
service&mdash; had opened a bottle of wine at the sideboard and
filled her glass. She looked at it with glazed and fearful eyes.
The fact that the rest of the glasses were filled from the same
bottle seemed to have no effect upon her. The white fingers which
played with the stem of the wineglass shook. She glanced covertly
towards her guest whose unseeing eyes refused her challenge.</p>

<p>After dinner the two found themselves for a time alone in the
drawing-room. The others had settled down to bridge in a remote
corner. Flora Rentoul leaned towards her visitor.</p>

<p>"Of course it's wonderful to have you here, Baroness, but why
didn't you tell me that you knew my brother-in-law? When George
told me to write and ask you to dinner and gave me your address I
was so astonished that I nearly gave myself away."</p>

<p>Clara smiled.</p>

<p>"Rentoul is not such a very uncommon name," she pointed out.
"Why should I have taken it for granted that the Captain Rentoul
I knew in Bombay and who asked your husband to look me up some
time was even the same family? As a matter of fact it was I who
promised to come and see you both but one does not get much time
for social calls in my position."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rentoul nodded.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it's a wonderful chance to have you here," she said.
"I suppose you think now that I am a fool."</p>

<p>"I think that you are making a great mistake," was the kindly
reply. "If I were you I would go and see the doctor at once. He
will probably tell you that your symptoms come from some quite
ordinary cause and not from poisoning at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rentoul leaned back in her chair with a little fluttering
sigh. She sat gazing into the fire for a few moments. Presently
she looked up again and glanced at the bridge table. Her
husband's back was towards them.</p>

<p>"And Maisie?" she whispered. "What do you think of her?"</p>

<p>"I think, of her type, that she is the most beautiful creature
I ever saw."</p>

<p>"So George thinks," Flora Rentoul sighed bitterly.</p>

<p>Clara was very nearly angry.</p>

<p>"If ever I saw two people who were entirely indifferent to one
another, except in a friendly and pleasant way, I should say
those two were your husband and your sister," she said sternly.
"You are making yourself ill about nothing. I think you must
forgive my repeating that you are a very foolish woman."</p>

<p>"Even you!" Flora Rentoul murmured, with a note of despair in
her tone. "No wonder that I dare ask no one for help...."</p>

<p>At the end of the first rubber Clara excused herself. Her
hostess wished her good-bye listlessly. Rentoul handed her over
to his prospective brother-inlaw.</p>

<p>"Will you call a taxi and see the Baroness into it, Phillip,"
he begged. "I must go down and fetch the whiskies and sodas."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," the young man acquiesced. "Not too strong for
me, George."</p>

<p>"We must have another chat about Bombay, Baroness," Dr.
Rentoul said as they parted in the little hall. "I will come and
see you during the course of the next few days if I may."</p>

<p>"Do," she invited. "I am generally at home except for the
luncheon hours until about six."</p>

<p>Clara passed out on to the front steps accompanied by her
escort. It was raining slightly and he held an umbrella over her
whilst he whistled for a taxi. For several moments there was no
response although in the main street a short distance away they
could see glittering lights passing all the time. He handed her
the umbrella.</p>

<p>"Wait here for a moment," he enjoined. "I will bring one of
those fellows up."</p>

<p>She protested but he was already off down the street. Looking
about her idly Clara followed the slant of light that came from a
side window in the area. She turned her head and found that she
was looking into what was evidently Dr. Rentoul's surgery. She
saw him standing by the table. He poured what seemed to be whisky
from a decanter into a glass, then he stood with his head turned
towards the door as though listening. A moment later he moved
towards a shelf which was lined with bottles, thrust his hand
behind them all and brought out a small phial. He shook out two
capsules, dropped them into the whisky and splashed some soda
water into the tumbler.... The young man returned in triumph with
the taxi.</p>

<p>"I do hope I have not been very long," he apologised. "They
are not easy to find to-night."</p>

<p>Clara glanced indecisively towards the house. Her first
impulse had been to return. She realised the futility of such a
proceeding, however, and stepped into the vehicle.</p>

<p>"You have been very kind," she said to the young man. "I hope
you are not wet."</p>

<p>He reassured her good-humouredly, gave her address to the
driver and re-entered the house. Clara leaned back in her
place.</p>

<p>"So clever," she murmured. "Such an actor. And yet to forget
to draw the blinds!" ... Clara could scarcely wait until she
reached her rooms. Arrived there she threw off her evening coat,
lit a cigarette, turned up her reading lamp and seated herself at
her desk. She drew a sheet of paper towards her and, writing
carefully, headed it:</p><br>

<h3>THE CASE OF DOCTOR GEORGE RENTOUL</h3>

<p class="note"><u>April 4th</u>. Flora Rentoul visits me for
consultation. She is a nervous woman, evidently in ill health,
still fairly well balanced. She asks my advice. She is convinced
that she is being secretly poisoned by her husband. The only
reason she can assign is that she has a very beautiful young
sister who is frequently at the house and that she herself, as is
usual with her type, has begun to lose her good looks. She
describes her symptoms.</p>

<p class="note">N.B. (A little out of place.) The next day I
consult Dr. Herries who tells me that the symptoms she spoke of
are exactly the symptoms which would be produced by the use of a
dangerous and little known poison called phenifer, which has many
of the characteristics of arsenic. I promise Mrs. Rentoul to
think over her statements and see what I can do.</p>

<p class="note">The same afternoon I am consulted by Dr. Rentoul.
If all reasonable evidence is to be believed he comes to me
utterly independently of his wife and without knowing of her
visit. He tells me that his wife is slowly poisoning herself and
begs for my advice. In reply to the obvious suggestion that he
should take her away somewhere, find out what her trouble is and
watch her so that the poison is unprocurable he points out that
he is a struggling doctor just meeting with his first measure of
success, that to leave home would mean ruin to his newly
established practice and to remonstrate with his wife in her
present hyper-nervous state he feels sure would be only to drive
her to take a larger dose of poison and end the matter quickly. I
agree to visit the house for dinner one night as a friend of his
brother in India, make the acquaintance of the family and tell
him what I think of his wife's condition and the possibilities of
intervention. N.B. If Flora Rentovl's statement is true and if
her husband is slowly poisoning her his visit to me, it is easily
understandable, would be strong evidence in his favour in the
case of trouble at her decease.</p>

<p class="note"><u>April 11th</u>. I visit the house and dine
with Doctor and Mrs. Rentoul, her sister, the most exquisitely
beautiful girl, the latter's fiance, a pleasant but ordinary
young man, and her father, a colourless retired officer. There is
nothing which repays the closest observation throughout the
evening except Flora Rentoul's obvious terror when her husband
fills her glass with wine.</p>

<p class="note">N.B. The wine is from a freshly opened champagne
bottle and drunk by everyone at the table, including myself.</p>

<p class="note">I leave early, inclined to think that the whole
thing is an hallucination of Mrs. Rentoul's, as her husband
seemed a perfectly good-natured, ordinary person and there does
not appear the slightest motive for his wishing harm to his wife.
N.B. After three hours of the closest watching I did not perceive
the remotest sign of any secret understanding between the doctor
and his beautiful sister-in-law, who appeared to be to him merely
an object of friendly indifference.</p>

<p class="note">When I leave I wait on the top step while a taxi
is being fetched. The side blind of the surgery has been left
undrawn. I see Doctor Rentoul, who has gone down for the avowed
purpose of mixing some whiskies and sodas, take one&mdash;the
small&mdash;glass and drop into it two tabloids from a bottle
which he fetches out from a hiding place behind his rows of
drugs.</p>

<p class="note">I feel myself in a difficult position. If I place
the matter in the hands of the police there will never be any
proof, even if Flora Rentoul should die of poisoning, that the
poisoner was her husband, as I should not be able to swear that
the tumbler into which he dropped the tabloids was the one from
which his wife drank, nor have I any certain information as to
the nature of the tabloids. There is strong presumptive evidence
of the guilt of Doctor Rentoul but how am I to move in the
matter? If I tell him what I have seen and threaten to inform the
police, if anything happens to his wife he will at once destroy
the only evidence against him and if he is determined to
encompass her death he will do so in some other fashion.</p>

<p class="note"><u>Problem</u>: To save Flora Rentoul.</p><br>

<p>On the following morning Clara dealt resolutely with her
correspondence before she permitted herself to think of the
proposition she had on hand. It was fully eleven o'clock before
Miss Marlowe, her secretary, had left her with the remainder of
the day comparatively at her own disposal. Five minutes later,
however, Miss Marlowe was back again.</p>

<p>"A young lady to see you, Baroness," she confided.</p>

<p>"She does not want to give her name but she says you know
her."</p>

<p>Clara nodded. She was quite used to young women who thought
that it mattered whether they gave their names or not.</p>

<p>"Show her in," she directed.</p>

<p>Maisie floated in, blithe and buoyant. She was carrying a
bunch of primroses she had bought in the street and was the
personification of spring herself. She laughed gaily at Clara's
obvious astonishment.</p>

<p>"Have I taken you by surprise?" she asked. "What fun! I
thought I might. Shall I sit down?"</p>

<p>"What on earth do you want, child?"</p>

<p>"Serious business," Maisie assured her. "I was so interested
when George told us last night about your profession. I have
never met anyone like you before and I've wanted to ever so much.
Do you really sit there and give people wonderful advice and get
them out of all sorts of trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, I do my best," was the somewhat stupefied reply.</p>

<p>"Will you help me, please?" Maisie begged, trying for a moment
to look serious.</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly in it," the girl confessed. "But I'm afraid
I soon might have been and now I have changed my mind about
everything, so I just want to start again."</p>

<p>"If you are in need of my advice," Clara suggested, "try and
be as simple as possible. Explain the situation as clearly as you
can. That last sentence, for instance, was a trifle
complicated."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I have been rather silly," Maisie admitted
with a faint sigh and the delicate shadow of a frown. "You see,"
she went on, "a few months ago I fancied myself desperately,
horribly in love with George."</p>

<p>"Your brother-in-law?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, I see now how foolish it was but I was sorry
for him too. He married Flora and, naturally, she is not so nice
looking as she was. I used to try to get him to take a little
notice of me but he never would. Then I got mad. I decided that I
would poison Flora and then that George would marry me."</p>

<p>"You decided what?" Clara gasped. Maisie smiled
complacently.</p>

<p>"I suppose it sounds quite horrid," she continued, "but that's
just what I wanted to do so I did it. I had heard of a wonderful
poison&mdash;Phillip is in a wholesale chemist's and knows all
about those things. I made him get me some of it&mdash;it is
supposed to be wonderful for the complexion&mdash;and I gave
small doses to Flora whenever I had the chance. I thought I had
better do it by degrees or else there might have been
trouble."</p>

<p>"My God!" Clara murmured under her breath. Maisie held the
primroses delicately to her nose for a moment and then laid them
down by her side.</p>

<p>"Aren't they lovely?" she sighed. "My favourite spring flower.
Where was I? Oh, I know. I think the poison is beginning to have
an effect but I suppose I have not given Flora quite enough. I
hope not, because I find it would be very much better, after all,
to let her live. I don't want George any more. I have changed my
mind completely. I threw all that was left of the poison into the
Serpentine this morning."</p>

<p>"Listen," Clara begged. "I'm not quite sure whether I'm still
dreaming. Do you mean to tell me seriously that you have done
your best to poison your sister and that you have only left off
because you have changed your mind?"</p>

<p>Maisie nodded brightly.</p>

<p>"How well you put things," she acknowledged.</p>

<p>"That's quite true, Baroness. I will tell you why. I am
feeling all differently about things. Some time ago I met a Mr.
Chambers, the Mr. Chambers, you know, the great film man, and he
wanted me to go and have a test. I suppose I ought to be on the
films really, with my appearance. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I should hate to tell you," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>"That's because you don't think it's a nice life perhaps,"
Maisie went on. "You would if you were in my position. Last week
I went to a studio with Mr. Chambers and I had a test. You should
have seen them all up there. They were simply crazy about me! I
can't think why I didn't go there before. I have a contract all
signed guaranteeing me a thousand a year for certain&mdash;what
they call, I think, a retaining fee&mdash;and a salary commencing
at fifty pounds a week as soon as I start work! I have two
hundred pounds in my pocket now and I am going shopping directly
I leave you. I think&mdash;yes, I feel sure&mdash; that I shall
buy Flora a little present, something for her to wear if she gets
well enough again. Now, give me your advice, please."</p>

<p>"What about?" Clara demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want any trouble," Maisie observed, fondling
her vanity case. "I hate scenes. They are so bad for me. And
Flora is so fond of them. I am rather afraid of George, too. He
ought to be flattered at what I have done but he might not be. I
want you to arrange everything with them. I want you to let
George know that Flora has been having phenifer for two months
and she had better perhaps go to a hospital so that nothing
happens to her."</p>

<p>Clara was silent for a few moments, which period of time
Maisie employed by looking into the mirror of her vanity case.
Everything she saw, however, reflected perfection, so with a
little sigh she closed it up.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know there will be a fee," she went on.</p>

<p>"Please make it not too high because, although I am going to
be very rich, I have not a great deal of money yet and I need so
many clothes. There is a mink coat I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do be quiet," Clara interrupted. "What you have been
telling me then is that you attempted to murder your sister,
having a penchant for her husband, that you have changed your
mind and want me to see that your sister does not suffer and that
you are not bothered about it."</p>

<p>"It must sound very fickle of me, I suppose,"</p>

<p>Maisie sighed. "But I really did have a tremendous pash for
George. It all seemed to go in one minute when I met Morris
Falcon. I am to play opposite to him. I never saw anyone so
handsome in my life. If he is married I shall break my heart!
Anyhow he has got to fall in love with me."</p>

<p>"Five guineas, please, Miss Singleton."</p>

<p>Maisie opened her purse with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Do you mind making it five pounds?" she begged, laying the
notes upon the table. "I haven't any silver."</p>

<p>Clara reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I'll do," she suggested. "I have a
friend&mdash;a great scientist, but very fond of beautiful young
women. If you will come and lunch with me to-morrow at the
Berkeley Grill and let him watch you and talk to you for a time
you can take the five pounds back again."</p>

<p>The girl snatched up the money.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll come," she declared. "I love talking to
strange men and I love the Berkeley Grill."</p>

<p>"At one o'clock if you please then. That's settled. Now, have
you any objection to being present while I put this matter
straight for you?"</p>

<p>Maisie indulged in a little grimace.</p>

<p>"It won't be very pleasant," she complained. "All the same, I
suppose they will have to know some time. I don't mind about
Flora so much but George can be so disagreeable. I don't believe
that I succeeded in making him the least bit fond of me."</p>

<p>"Please be here at four o'clock on Thursday afternoon," Clara
invited. "I shall have your brother-inlaw and sister here. I am
not asking them earlier because I am afraid Doctor Rentoul would
be too busy. The whole matter shall be cleared up for you
then."</p>

<p>Maisie smiled and rose to her feet. Again the little perfume
of spring seemed to float about her. Her wonderful eyes shone
with gratitude.</p>

<p>"You are kind," she exclaimed. "I will be here, of
course."</p>

<p>She held out her hand but Clara happened to be busy ringing
the bell.</p>

<p>The oracle of Advice Limited always considered that the
strangest tea-party she had ever given or participated in.
Somewhat to her surprise Doctor Rentoul, his wife and Maisie, all
three, arrived together. Doctor Rentoul was evidently ill at
ease. His wife was nervous. Maisie was the only one who seemed
unperturbed. She was wearing an obviously new and most expensive
costume of Chanel grey trimmed with light fur. She took the most
comfortable chair and munched greedily at her buttered toast.</p>

<p>"This is going to be rather a surprise party for all of you,"
her hostess announced, after a few minutes of general
conversation. "To begin with I hope you won't mind, Doctor
Rentoul, answering me a question."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he assented shortly.</p>

<p>"The other night while I was waiting for a taxicab I saw you
drop two tabloids from a little phial into one of the whiskies
and sodas."</p>

<p>"My wife's," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"As I told you before," he confided, "I believe my wife is
trying to poison herself. I have not dared to tell her so but I
am putting my trust in you. I know the nature of the poison she
was taking from the effects. The tabloids I gave her were the
best known and only effectual antidote. I have been doing that
for weeks."</p>

<p>"Trying to save her life?" Clara observed.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>Flora leaned forward in her chair. Her eyes were set, her
hands were shaking.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you were not giving me poison, George?" she
faltered.</p>

<p>"Don't be such an ass," he answered. "Forgive me, but you are
too silly, Flora. Why on earth should I want to give you poison?
My wife! You're too ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Then why is it," she demanded, "that every now and then some
of the things I eat or drink taste so queerly and I have this
pain and this sickness?"</p>

<p>"Someone else," Clara told her, "has been giving you poison.
If you want to know who it is she has confessed and asked me to
tell you the truth. It is your sister Maisie. It seems that she
had what she calls a 'pash' for your husband. It has worn off now
and as she is starting a new life on the films she wants you to
know that she has been giving you phenifer so that you can be
treated properly."</p>

<p>Rentoul was the first to break the strange and terrible
silence. He rose to his feet. His face was dark with passion.</p>

<p>"You little devil!" he cried.</p>

<p>Maisie smiled across at him deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"You ought to be flattered, George," she remonstrated. "I was
terribly fond of you or I should not have done it. I hope you
won't be any the worse, Flora."</p>

<p>"Do you know that if I had not given those antidotes to your
sister," Rentoul said, his voice terrible in its intensity, "that
she would have been dead before now, that you would have been a
murderess and, I hope to God, hung for it?"</p>

<p>For the first time Maisie seemed disturbed. She set down her
teacup and ceased to swing her pearl-coloured silk-clad leg.</p>

<p>"What a brute you are, George," she complained with a shiver.
"I can't think how I ever liked you."</p>

<p>A rejuvenated Flora looked across at her sister. There was a
certain horror in her eyes but her whole face seemed to have
grown softer and younger.</p>

<p>"Maisie," she cried. "What have I ever done to you? Why should
you have done this terrible thing?"</p>

<p>Maisie was getting sulky. It scarcely seemed to her that she
was being fairly treated.</p>

<p>"I wanted George just then," she declared. "If I could have
had him without hurting you I should not have done what I did. I
don't want him any more and I never want to see either of you
again. I have a wonderful career&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. Miss Marlowe presented
herself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chambers has called for Miss Singleton," she
announced.</p>

<p>Maisie sprang eagerly to her feet.</p>

<p>"That's my manager," she confided with a smile.</p>

<p>"At least he's going to be. I am due at a cocktail party with
him and Morris Falcon, the great cinema star. You don't want me
any more, Baroness?"</p>

<p>"I think not," was the contemptuous reply. Maisie kissed her
hand to her sister and brother-in-law and nodded to her
hostess.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for arranging everything," she said
sweetly. "It has been rather disagreeable but I am glad it is
over. You will excuse me, won't you?"</p>

<p>No one seemed to think of any suitable reply and Maisie
disappeared. Doctor Rentoul rose to his feet. Side by side with a
great relief there was something of horror in his eyes as he
stared at the door.</p>

<p>"But my God!" he exclaimed. "She must be mad! No sane girl
could talk like that. She is obsessed."</p>

<p>"I wondered whether you would realise that,"</p>

<p>Clara said earnestly. "You see, she came to me and confessed.
I felt that it was impossible she could be in her right mind and
I promised to help her if she would meet Doctor Strangeways, the
great mental specialist, at lunch with me. Of course, she hadn't
any idea that he was anything but an ordinary guest. Directly she
had gone he told me that she was suffering from some obscure
mental malady&mdash;I forget the name but he will tell you
everything, Doctor Rentoul. She will have to be looked after for
a few months. She doesn't know it but that message she received
was a bogus one. Doctor Strangeways is going to take care of her
for a time and keep her under observation."</p>

<p>Flora Rentoul was crying softly upon the sofa. Rentoul shook
hands with Clara.</p>

<p>"You are a very wonderful woman, Baroness," he said. "You have
realised what we none of us dreamt of. I will see Strangeways to-
night. Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned to his wife and Clara tactfully went back to the tea
tray. What she saw when she looked up a moment or two later sent
her on tip-toe from the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story10" name="story10">X. &mdash; THE LISTENING
LADY</a></h2>

<p class="first">DETECTIVE INSPECTOR WAYES was a burly and broad
shouldered man with a voice which belied his appearance.
It&mdash;the voice&mdash;was low, distinct and penetrating. It
inspired discomfort in the criminal placed upon the carpet and it
carried conviction to the sympathetic listener. Nevertheless,
Clara regarded her visitor doubtfully across those few feet of
her neatly arranged desk.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me if I seem surprised, Inspector," she
said. "This isn't a usual move on the part of the charitable
institution you represent, is it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a move at all," he answered irritably. "My visit to
you is not official."</p>

<p>"I see," she murmured.</p>

<p>"You don't see and I'm beginning to wonder whether your
friends who speak of you as a young woman of exceptional
intelligence are not mistaken," was the terse reply. "Kindly
listen to me without interruption for a few moments. There is a
certain old lady&mdash;the Countess of Martinhoe&mdash;who is, in
the eyes of the Chief, a very important person. Yesterday she
telephoned to the Yard for a detective and I was sent. When I
arrived I found her a partial invalid and in a state of dangerous
excitement. After listening to what she had to say I realised at
once that it was not a police job. In her condition it seemed
better not to tell her so in plain words but I recommended that
she employ someone outside the service in the first instance and
mentioned your name. She wishes to see you at four o'clock this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"What made you recommend me?" Clara asked curiously.</p>

<p>The Inspector's fingers played with his slight stubbly
moustache. He smiled across at the very composed and exceedingly
good looking young woman on whom he was calling.</p>

<p>"I have come into touch with some of your work during the last
few months," he confided, as he rose to his feet. "The
appointment is for four o'clock at Number 17A. Belgrave Square,
if you care to keep it. The Earl of Martinhoe is in residence
there but it is his aunt, the Dowager Countess, whom you have to
see. She is virtually the head of the family as she has sole
control of the money bags. Good morning...."</p>

<p>Clara checked up the name and address in a town directory and
kept the appointment. Her enterprise opened badly. She was kept
waiting for nearly a quarter of an hour in a small draughty
apartment which she took to be a waiting room for the reception
of tradespeople, and then ushered into a palatial library to find
herself confronted by a handsome young man of dissolute
appearance whose lips were pursed into a whistle at the sight of
her and in whose eyes there flashed the usual light. He had been
lounging somewhat insolently upon a couch at her entrance but a
moment later he was upon his feet, his outstretched hand
indicating a chair.</p>

<p>"This is quite unexpected," he observed, glancing at her card
and reading the name inscribed upon it. "What can I have the
pleasure of doing for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," was the brief reply. "I am here to keep an
appointment with the Countess of Martinhoe."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, I see," the young man murmured with some vagueness.
"The fact of it is that my aunt&mdash;I am Robert Brandon, you
know&mdash;sees no one. She is not in a fit condition to receive
visitors. Her business and charitable affairs are in my
hands."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that her ladyship's health is in such a
poor condition," Clara sympathised. "At the same time I am here
by her special request so I naturally hope that she will be well
enough to see me."</p>

<p>Robert Brandon's face darkened.</p>

<p>"Have you any objection to telling me the nature of your
business?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I certainly have," was the cool rejoinder.</p>

<p>The young man was taken aback. This caller was so composed and
confident, her personality, whilst alluring, so utterly remote
that for the moment he felt the situation beyond him. He rang the
bell and gave a brief message to the footman who answered.</p>

<p>"Lady Martinhoe cannot possibly see you," he announced,
turning back to this embarrassing visitor.</p>

<p>"She does not see anyone. If you know anything about her at
all you must be aware of the fact that she is an invalid."</p>

<p>"All that I know is that I have come at her particular
request," Clara told him, "and at the suggestion of Inspector
Wayes of Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>The door was quietly opened. A young man and a young woman
entered together, obviously brother and sister. The former was of
fair complexion, precise in clothes, general appearance and
demeanour. His pale blue eyes had rather a vacant look but his
tout ensemble was redeemed by an indefinable kindliness of
expression. The girl, who appeared to be the best looking of the
family, was in riding habit and smoking a cigarette. She looked
across at Clara a trifle insolently.</p>

<p>"This is my brother, the Earl of Martinhoe," Robert Brandon
announced, "and my sister Lady Mary Brandon. This young lady says
that she has an appointment with Aunt Julia at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Some mistake," Lady Mary declared. "Aunt Julia does not see
anyone."</p>

<p>"The appointment was made by Lady Martinhoe herself and
emanated in the first place from an official of Scotland Yard,"
Clara confided. They all three exchanged glances. Lord Martinhoe
coughed nervously.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that what my sister says is quite correct," he
explained apologetically.</p>

<p>"The appointment has obviously been made under some
misapprehension," Robert Brandon intervened. "My aunt's state of
health does not permit her to receive visitors."</p>

<p>Some heavy curtains at the further end of the room were
suddenly pushed aside. A wizened old lady, bent nearly double and
leaning upon an ebony stick, extravagantly dressed and decked
with an amazing amount of jewellery, had made her appearance. She
pointed her stick at her younger nephew.</p>

<p>"Liar," she exclaimed bitterly. "My health is as good as yours
and I receive just what visitors I choose. Now, be off&mdash;all
three of you. I want to talk to this young lady."</p>

<p>"If you are Lady Martinhoe&mdash;" Clara said, moving a step
forward.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm Lady Martinhoe," the newcomer interrupted
irritably. "Be off at once, you others. I want to talk to this
young woman."</p>

<p>"The young lady appears to be connected indirectly with the
police," Robert Brandon pointed out.</p>

<p>"Mayn't we others of the family know what it is you have to
say to her?"</p>

<p>"You certainly may not," was the sharp reply.</p>

<p>"I am quite capable of looking after my own affairs. And next
time I have visitors," the old lady added, sinking into an easy
chair and waving her stick once more at her nephew, "don't talk
about my being an invalid and don't try to worm out from them
what their business with me may be. There's too much of that sort
of thing going on here. Do you understand, all of you? I'm
perfectly well able to take care of myself."</p>

<p>"In family matters&mdash;" Robert began.</p>

<p>"Family matters be damned," his aunt cried furiously. "I am
the head of this family and don't you forget it. Out you go, all
of you."</p>

<p>They departed with more or less dignity and the door closed
behind them. The bent old lady with the parchment face and the
queer pale blue eyes chuckled. She pointed with her stick to a
chair.</p>

<p>"Come and sit close to me," she invited, "and I'll tell you
the same story I told the policeman. He went away quite sure that
I was mad. You won't think anything of the sort, my dear. There's
too much sound commonsense in your face. Those policemen are
always making mistakes simply because they think they're cleverer
than other people. Now make yourself comfortable and listen."</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Wayes, seated in his own chair, at his own
desk in his private room at Scotland Yard, was somehow or other a
more weighty and dignified figure. Clara scarcely recognised him
at her first entrance into his sanctum on the following morning.
His opening words, however, reassured her as to his identity.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Baroness," he invited. "I rather fancied hat I
should have a call from you during the day."</p>

<p>"What made you send me to Belgrave Square?" she asked him
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Frankly because I wanted a woman's view of the situation. We
don't employ ladies here, you know, so I had to look
outside."</p>

<p>"Very kind of you, I'm sure," Clara observed with a note of
anger in her tone. "I suppose you know that everyone else except
Lady Martinhoe and her elder nephew was disgustingly rude to
me."</p>

<p>"That isn't very important, is it?" the Inspector urged
soothingly. "One has to put up with that in our profession. I
simply sent you there to see if you could find out more than I
could. I was handicapped all the time by my official
position."</p>

<p>"You didn't even give me an idea about what that old woman had
in her head."</p>

<p>"Naturally not. Your receptive faculties would all have been
biassed if I had given you my view of the situation before you
went. Now tell me what happened."</p>

<p>The Inspector's shrewd, dark eyes were fixed steadily upon
her. His yellow-stained fingers waved away a little cloud of
cigarette smoke from in front of his face. Clara noted the
creases upon his worn forehead and around his mouth and her sense
of irritation decreased.</p>

<p>"I saw the young man first&mdash;the Honourable Robert
Brandon," she began. "He was very anxious for me to tell him
exactly what I had come about."</p>

<p>"He would be," the Inspector assented drily.</p>

<p>"When I refused he sent for his brother, Lord Martinhoe, and
his sister Lady Mary Brandon. Lord Martinhoe was courteous enough
but the girl was just as rude as she knew how to be."</p>

<p>"All in the day's work."</p>

<p>"Then the Dowager came along. She sent them all away and told
me her grievances."</p>

<p>"After which she asked for your advice."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you give it to her?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. Wasn't that what I was there for?"</p>

<p>His forefinger tapped the table impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>Clara opened her cigarette case. Her eyes wandered towards the
door. The Inspector nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>"That's quite all right," he assured her. "We don't encourage
women to smoke on the premises as a rule but ours is what is
called a l.A. interview. There's a man on duty outside the door
and I can only be addressed through the telephone. Smoke away if
you want to."</p>

<p>Clara lit a cigarette and watched a couple of blue rings curl
upward to the ceiling. They seemed like the frames of the tragedy
which was still in her mind. The Inspector waited more or less
patiently.</p>

<p>"You must understand," she went on, "that when I am called
upon to give advice I simply put myself in the place
of&mdash;say, the woman who is my client and no outside
considerations have any weight with me. I embrace her wish as my
guiding motto and I advise her how to attain that wish in the
safest possible manner. The Countess of Martinhoe," Clara
proceeded, "although she is very far indeed from being a lunatic,
has without a doubt a grotesquely ill-balanced and malicious
brain. She assured me that within the last year she has been
selling out her securities steadily and investing the whole of
the proceeds&mdash;nearly a million pounds&mdash;in jewellery.
She had been doing this secretly and on a smaller scale for years
and now the whim seems to have seized her to confide in her
relatives, her friends and even the Press. When I was on my way
there this afternoon I could not remember why the name of Lady
Martinhoe was so familiar to me. Directly she told me her story I
knew. Her name is in the paper all the time as a buyer at
Christie's and elsewhere of any rare or precious stones."</p>

<p>The telephone bell at the Inspector's elbow tinkled. He took
off the receiver, listened for a moment and turned towards his
visitor, holding his hand over the transmitter.</p>

<p>"That's quaint. Lady Martinhoe is downstairs," he
announced.</p>

<p>"You can put me in another room if you don't want to keep her
waiting," Clara suggested. "We can finish our conversation when
she has gone."</p>

<p>The Inspector reflected.</p>

<p>"Have you any objection to remaining here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"None whatever," she assured him. "It would rather interest
me."</p>

<p>The Inspector turned back to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Show her ladyship up," he directed.</p>

<p>Lady Martinhoe was announced and ushered in.</p>

<p>In her outdoor habiliments and without her circuslike display
of jewellery she presented a less grotesque appearance but her
stoop was, if anything, more pronounced and the angle at which it
placed her head made her seem more than ever like a person
suffering from some terrible deformity. She entered the room
leaning on her maid's arm but as soon as she was safely ensconced
in a chair she at once dismissed her.</p>

<p>"Wait for me outside, Anna," she enjoined. "That nice young
policeman will find you a seat, perhaps, if you ask him. Dear me,
if it isn't the Baroness again&mdash; with the Inspector too. Is
Scotland Yard taking advice, Inspector Wayes?"</p>

<p>"We often need it, your ladyship," was the courteous
reply.</p>

<p>She leaned forward, her hands clasped on the top of her stick
and her chin witchlike only an inch or two above them.</p>

<p>"Discussing my affairs, I wonder?" she asked shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Exactly what we were doing," the Inspector assented. "The
Baroness was on the point of telling me what her advice to you
was."</p>

<p>"I'll save her the trouble," the little old lady declared, her
voice seeming to become shriller and harsher with excitement.
"I'll tell you what I asked her and what her reply was. First of
all, I let her into a secret. You'd like to hear it too, eh
Inspector? Very well, you shall."</p>

<p>"Unless it is something which would interest me
professionally&mdash;" the Inspector began.</p>

<p>"Oh, cut out the starch," Lady Martinhoe interrupted
scornfully. "I told her that I slept with a million pounds' worth
of jewels in a black safe by the side of my bed and with the key
of the safe under my pillow. I told her why, too. I have in the
house two nephews, a niece and a companion, besides my maid and
twenty or thirty other servants. Most of them are mentioned in my
will. Sometimes I am anxious about them," she went on, dropping
her voice. "Most of them at different times and in their own way
have tried to rob me. That makes me very anxious. I wonder how
dishonest they really are. That is where my scheme comes in. I am
finding out."</p>

<p>"You will remember what I told you," Inspector Wayes said
severely. "I think your scheme, besides being dangerous, is a
wicked one."</p>

<p>His visitor chuckled. There was a gleam of humour in her eyes
but it was humour of a virulent type.</p>

<p>"I do nothing against the law," she croaked, "and oh, what a
joke it has been! Benskin, my butler, the man whom I trusted more
than anyone else in the world, he came in like a ghost the first
night. I pretended not to see him, but I had one eye open and a
pistol under the bedclothes in my left hand! His fingers were
shaking so that he could scarcely draw the key from underneath my
pillow. He managed it somehow or other. Then I gave a little moan
as though I were waking up. He stuffed a few rubbishy things into
his pocket, locked up the safe, replaced the key and went puffing
out of the room like a scared rabbit. He was funny, Inspector,"
she went on, wiping her eyes between little jerky spasms of
laughter. "I was longing to shoot at his legs. That would have
been funnier than anything.... How I enjoyed myself! That night I
think I laughed myself to sleep.... Then there came Miss Camps. I
told you about Miss Camps, didn't I? She's my companion. She's
outside in the car now."</p>

<p>"You told me about Miss Camps," the Inspector assented.</p>

<p>"And me," Clara echoed.</p>

<p>"I hope I made it perfectly plain to you," the former said,
"that I consider your escapades unfair and malicious."</p>

<p>"But not illegal," the old lady chuckled. "I can do as I like
if I choose to risk my own jewellery. Miss Camps was much less
nervous than Benskin. I am afraid that she must be an older hand.
She got off with one or two very nice diamonds before I turned
over with a yawn and nearly scared her out of her skin. I
shouldn't be surprised if Miss Camps didn't make a couple of
thousand pounds on those diamonds."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," the Inspector remarked coldly.</p>

<p>"Poor young woman," the Countess continued, with a grin which
disclosed two rows of yellow teeth.</p>

<p>"I had left her five thousand and it might amuse me at any
moment to give information to the police. You'd like the case,
wouldn't you, Inspector? Criminal business is quiet just now. I
know, because I always read the murder trials. I take the Police
Gazette, too."</p>

<p>Clara's eyes were cold and unsympathetic. There was a shade of
disgust mingled with her curiosity. Nevertheless, she was
listening to every word intently. Inspector Wayes' face was set
in hard lines and his expression changeless.</p>

<p>"I trapped Benskin and Ada Camps all right," Lady Martinhoe
continued complacently. "They're small game, though. I don't
count them seriously. One of my own people has been robbing me
for a long time. I've never been able to make up my mind which it
was. My time's coming now, though. Thanks to this nice young
woman&mdash;the Baroness Linz, isn't it&mdash;I shall soon know.
Here's a clever girl for you, Inspector. She'd had a glimpse of
Robert and she couldn't have thought much of him. I managed too
so that she saw Stephen and Mary before I marched in. She summed
them up all right. Would you like to know what she said to me,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"I certainly should," he admitted. Lady Martinhoe was
afflicted with a short spell of coughing. They waited patiently
until she had recovered.</p>

<p>"'When I give advice,' the Baroness said to me, 'I put myself
entirely in the position of my client. You are convinced,' she
persisted, 'that these young relatives of yours would rob you if
they dared?' I told her at once that one of them I knew would,
that it was being done all the time. 'Very well, then,' she said,
'you must make it worth their while. You bought the Kura-Kut
diamond last Tuesday. It was in all the papers. Have it delivered
in Belgrave Square and tell all three of your young people in the
strictest confidence that it is coming. Let them see it if you
like before it is put away in the safe. Then complain that you
haven't slept well and order a sleeping draught. If there is a
thief amongst the three you should know of it before morning. You
can make just enough noise to prevent anyone getting away with
the jewel and you can discover who deserves to be cut out of your
will.' Good advice, eh, Inspector? Bait your trap temptingly
enough if you want to bring the wolves out into the open."</p>

<p>"Good advice in its way," the Inspector agreed.</p>

<p>"Thoroughly bad morally and from my point of view highly
dangerous. How old are you, Lady Martinhoe?"</p>

<p>Her ladyship grinned.</p>

<p>"What a question for a gallant man!" she exclaimed. "I am
eighty-one."</p>

<p>"You are of an age when any violent shock might kill you," he
reminded her bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, my eye," she mocked him. "My heart's as sound as a
bell."</p>

<p>"Then, there's another point to be remembered," he went on.
"With the Kura-Kut diamond in their hands anyone might become
desperate. Even if they were your own kinsfolk if you sat up in
bed and jeered at them&mdash;they might retaliate."</p>

<p>The Countess smiled complacently.</p>

<p>"There would be no fun in the affair except for a certain
amount of risk. I should have been amused anyhow. Life is very
dull for old women, Inspector, and when they are malicious old
women like me it is very hard to find amusement."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. The Inspector coughed, then turned
over some papers.</p>

<p>"Precisely what, Lady Martinhoe," he asked politely, "was the
purpose of your visit here this morning?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, I'd nearly forgotten that," she confessed. "It was
just this, Inspector. I wanted to ask you a question&mdash;the
police are sometimes so very clever, especially when we don't
want them to be! You might come across some of these little
articles of jewellery of mine which Benskin and Ada Camps made
away with, find out where they have been sold or something of
that sort. If I denied that they belonged to me, though, if I
told you that I had lost nothing, you couldn't do anything about
it, could you?"</p>

<p>"Unless you made a charge," the Inspector admitted, "we should
be helpless."</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted to know," his visitor observed, her
bead-like eyes aglow with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Wait until the grand coup comes off, Inspector, as I hope it
may to-night or to-morrow, then I will give you a list of what
Miss Camps has stolen and what Benskin got away with. They will
just be beginning to feel safe when the little tap on their
shoulder comes. You must let me know which day you make the
arrest. I should like to be at home. And the big coup! That," she
meditated with an ugly smile, "will be a wonderful affair. I do
not like my nephew Stephen or my niece. Stephen is kindly enough
but he is a prig. Robert is not so bad but he is a rascal. I
wonder which one it will be. Robert, I fancy. Perhaps Mary.
Perhaps both of them!"</p>

<p>Inspector Wayes rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship," he cautioned her, "you will forgive my
pointing out that Scotland Yard cannot countenance in any way
your present course of action and may, in fact, intervene at any
time whether we receive instructions from you or not. If you will
excuse me now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely I can catch my own thieves," Lady Martinhoe snapped as
she raised herself to her feet. "Why should you people have all
the fun?"</p>

<p>The Inspector shrugged his shoulders as he opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Thief-baiting is nevertheless a dangerous hobby," he warned
his departing guest.</p>

<p>A silence uncannily intense brooded, through the watches of
the night, over the vast gloomy bedchamber on the ground floor of
the house in Belgrave Square. Not only was every light in the
apartment extinguished but every curtain was tightly drawn, every
window hermetically sealed. Lady Martinhoe believed in neither
light nor fresh air. In a silence unpenetrated by the sounds of
traffic, the hooting of motor horns or the dull tread of passing
footsteps she could lie awake and hsten. Her eighty-one-year-old
lungs seemed to work as well in this tomb-like apartment as
though she had been sitting in the famous grounds of her castle
in Cornwall where the spring airs carried perfumes of exotic
flowers and the ozone of the sea drifted upwards from the
tumbling waters. Neither of those aesthetic ecstasies would have
given any pleasure to the listening woman. It was the joy of her
present life to lie with her chin upon the bedclothes, her eyes
closed, her breathing apparently normal, with every nerve of her
withered old system concentrated and responsive to the faintest
sound which might disturb the sepulchral stillness of that
unwholesome chamber. The chimes of the beautiful clock below were
inaudible. A violent altercation between two chauffeurs
immediately under the window failed to reach her. Yet she would
have heard the passage of a mouse, the falling of a pin upon the
thick velvety carpet. The turning of the invisible door handle,
well oiled and beautifully fitted though it was, would have
brought her the thrill of excitement for which she craved. The
breathing of an infant, the passage of a cat or the cautious
gliding of naked feet across the rugs would have awakened in a
single second her shivering energies....</p>

<p>Clara's advice had been taken. The great trap had been baited.
The Kura-Kut, the most famous diamond of its type and class in
the world, encompassed by its steel walls, lay within a few feet
of her head. Her bony fingers were pulling the sheet up to her
chin. Malicious hopes kept her eyes bright. Her tongue moved in a
silent chuckle. Benskin! She had found Benskin out! Solemn-faced
old humbug strutting about the place with all the dignity of an
archbishop. The meek and humble Miss Camps! Lying there in the
inky darkness she pictured to herself with a ghastly smile the
floods of tears, the pitiful protestations of her frowsy, genteel
old companion suddenly face to face with disgrace and the bitter
amenities of prison life....</p>

<p>Her thoughts passed on to richer anticipations. There was
Robert. Supposing it would be Robert who came stealthy-footed
into her room! A little shiver passed through her withered frame
at the thought. Robert, although she had sometimes felt faint
sensations of affection for him, was soft as a woman and a coward
at heart. She could still revel over the misery in his anguished
face as, faced with ruin and exposure, he pleaded for mercy. The
suffering of any human being, even Robert, lured into a position
of shame and disgrace, appealed to her but as a matter of fact it
was not Robert for whose furtive entrance she waited with so many
tremulous hopes. Nor was it Mary her niece. Mary was just a fool.
Curiously enough she had never awakened the dislike in her aunt
that some of the others had done. Stephen was the one she wanted.
Stephen, the young man of correct judgment, the young man who
bore her dead husband's title, who ruled the destinies of the
family, the prig at Eton, the poseur at Oxford, the only one
amongst the little crowd of sycophants&mdash;not excluding even
the old family solicitor&mdash;who had spoken to her boldly about
the wickedness and folly of gathering to herself this great store
of jewels in her declining days when the estates and great houses
of the family were going to rack and ruin because the injustice
of a dead man's will had given her the right to play with the
family money. Stephen was the man she wanted. Let her catch him
red-handed and Inspector Wayes could come as fast as he liked.
She pictured him being led away from the house with hand-cuffs,
she hoped, on his wrists.</p>

<p>For the first time the sepulchral silence with which she was
surrounded was broken. That wicked little chuckle escaped from
her lips....</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, no one would come to-night. What were they
afraid of, she wondered with an unseen sneer. They all knew of
the sleeping draught which she was supposed to have taken but
none of them knew of the deadly little pistol clasped in the
fingers of her left hand. To every one of them it must seem as
though a fortune were there waiting for them. They needed it too.
They were all in debt. Mary for her frocks and her new motor car,
Stephen to his various banks with whose help he was endeavouring
to manage the estates, Robert for his mistress and his
bookmakers. So easy. Nobody but the old woman lying there asleep.
Surely one of them would have the courage to afford her these few
minutes of evil joy....</p>

<p>At last the time came when her heart gave a shivering jump.
With the slightest of efforts the mask-like impassivity of her
face was reassumed. Her eyes were tightly closed, her breathing
became a little louder. Even she could have heard nothing, but a
faint ripple of air had crept into the room. A pencil of light
had shewn for a single instant. She lay still and waited. This
was the supreme moment. One of the three&mdash; Mary, Stephen or
Robert&mdash;was in the room, was passing the foot of her
canopied bedstead. Now the intruder had reached the front of the
safe. There was the faint scratching of a finger-nail as though
searching for the key-hole. In a moment, she knew, would come the
hour of her test. A hand would be thrust under her pillow, the
key would be drawn away. The newcomer might even turn on a light.
Certainly he would use his shaded electric torch....</p>

<p>She had spilt some of the sleeping draught upon the sheet and
its sickly odour was strong in the unventilated apartment. A man,
she felt sure. It was either Robert or Stephen then. She prayed
that it might be Stephen. The supreme moment was coming. The
intruder was leaning over the bedside, his hand was travelling
over the silken counterpane, had plunged in under her pillow. The
key! Yes, he had the key. She could feel it withdrawn. Some
undisciplined sense told her that with it in his hand he had
turned away. Yet Lady Martinhoe was not enjoying herself as she
had expected. A spasm of strange emotions had frozen her mirth.
Cautiously she opened her eyes. There was little but a blur in
the darkness to be seen before she closed them again but by that
time a new sensation was draining the warmth from her body,
laying a chilled weight of fear upon her heart. It was neither
Robert nor Stephen who had walked into the trap. It was a
stranger who had drawn the key from under her pillow, who was
busy now in the recesses of the safe only a few feet away!</p>

<p>Julia, Countess of Martinhoe, had been a wicked woman all her
life and a wickeder still in these her closing days. Curiously
enough, although she had spoken often and boldly of her eighty-
one years, she had never thought of death. Now she knew that it
might be close at hand it filled her with a sort of grisly
terror. A sneeze, a moan, a shiver&mdash;anything that betrayed
her waking state&mdash;would be enough.</p>

<p>A robber from the real world of robbers! She had never dreamed
of this. She had baited the trap with care for one of the
household whom she hated. She could have flashed on the lamp and
laughed at Robert's scared face, Stephen's panicky agitation or
Mary's Victorian hysterics. They were to have been the prelude to
her own little drama of enjoyment. But this.... Fear was a
horrible thing! She tried to grip the butt end of the pistol
clasped only a few minutes before so tightly in her fingers. The
use had gone from her joints. Her fingers refused to close.
Nerves, the meaning of which she had altogether forgotten, began
to afflict her. She felt a twitching of the eyeballs, a wild
desire to see what she could of this figure of fate. His hard
breathing was now in her ears. She heard him shaking out the
jewels from their cases. Her throat was dry and her tongue as
though it had been smitten with a palsy. Yet she had a horrible
feeling that it still possessed the power of speech although her
own control over it was lost. In a moment she would be calling
out, calling for death.</p>

<p>She knew perfectly well that this unseen presence bending over
his task was the presence of a prospective murderer. He was
engaged in the business of collecting a million pounds' worth of
jewels. It wasn't likely that he would leave an old woman behind
to send him to the gallows. And try how she would she felt that
in a moment the end would come. She would call out or try to call
out. She would struggle to move her stiff limbs to throw herself
upon the bell. Horror was moistening the pores of her skin. She
prayed that she might faint. Unconsciousness might save her. At
least death would come easily....</p>

<p>It was all over&mdash;this mad struggle with herself.</p>

<p>The disaster had happened. A hoarse gurgling cry had broken
from her lips! Without the power to raise herself in bed she was
still able to turn her head. The man, who was filling a dress
suit case from the safe by the light of a shaded electric torch
pushed right back into its recesses, answered in kind. With a
brief but profane exclamation he swung round and, although Lady
Martinhoe was a wicked old lady herself, she had never seen
anything more wicked than the light which was glittering in those
narrowed eyes, or the ugly curl of his cruel lips. He bent over
her, a stocky man on whom dress clothes sat like a travesty.</p>

<p>"What a b&mdash;y old fool you were to wake up!"</p>

<p>He uttered no threats. In stark but silent horror she saw the
approach of a perfectly black hand, thick and ill shapen. The
smell of rubber was in her nostrils. She felt the fingers
searching for the vulnerable part of her throat. Now she was
trying to call out, trying in vain agony at her impotence. The
bed heaved&mdash;.</p>

<p>It was as though the universe had wheeled. There was no more
silence. The door had been flung noisily open. Every light in the
room was blazing out from the various brackets. Stephen, in a
blue silk dressing gown, with dishevelled hair and a man's light
blazing in his eyes came swiftly across the room.</p>

<p>"Leave her alone, you brute!" he shouted. "What are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>The man in the black gloves straightened himself. Probably he
regarded the question as futile for he made no attempt to answer
it. There was his dressing case, now fully exposed, upon the
floor, filled with a glittering medley of jewels, the safe, with
its door open, partially denuded of its contents. Lastly there
was the man himself, the typical criminal, whose fingers were
stealthily straying towards his hip pocket.</p>

<p>"Put 'em up!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Stephen's reply&mdash;an ill considered one from a man to whom
life was dear&mdash;was a leap forward and a crashing blow on the
side of the face which the intruder, from sheer surprise, only
half avoided. In a moment the two were locked in one another's
arms swaying backwards and forwards around the room. Probably all
would have been over in a matter of seconds but the man with the
black gloves wasted time trying to draw his revolver from an
unaccustomed pocket, before it dawned upon his slowly moving mind
that he had only a weakling to contend with. He abandoned the
idea of the gun and gripped Stephen with both arms. He lifted him
up and shook him. This was almost the softest thing that had ever
come his way! Then he remembered that after all time was
valuable, for the alarm had been given. He flung the young man
over on his back, held his wrists with one hand and caught him by
the throat with the other....</p>

<p>Julia, Lady Martinhoe, had never experienced a greater joy in
life than that reactionary flow of blood back into her veins. Her
wicked old face was aglow with a new zest for life. She rose on
her knees in bed and, resting most of her weight upon the palm of
her right hand, she leaned cautiously forward. The words of the
little gunsmith from whom she had learnt her marksmanship flashed
into her mind.</p>

<p>"As soon as you have taken aim at close quarters drop the
barrel of your gun an inch."</p>

<p>Lady Martinhoe obeyed the instructions and the bullet entered
the cheek of her marauding visitor exactly where his very
truculent jawbone began to assert itself. His fingers loosened
their grip and he stared wildly round. Through the valley of the
shadow of death and later on in the wards of the hospital he
carried with him the amazing memory of a hooknosed old lady in
pink pyjamas leaning over the end of the bed, the pistol still
steady in her hand, a beatific smile of supreme content parting
her thin cracked lips. The complete reconciliation of the
Countess of Martinhoe with her two nephews and her niece was a
source of congratulation amongst all their friends and of much
pecuniary benefit to the younger members of the family. At one of
those cheerful little dinner parties which became her greatest
pleasure towards the end of the season Stephen glanced in a
puzzled manner at one of the name cards.</p>

<p>"Why the Baroness Linz, aunt?" he enquired. Lady Martinhoe
smiled.</p>

<p>"The Baroness," she told him, "is a young woman who earns her
living by giving good advice. When I was a different sort of
person and believed that everyone, even my own family, was trying
to rob me it was she who advised me to try you out. I baited the
trap, the unexpected burglar walked in, you saved my life, I
recovered my faith in all you nice young people and I had the
supreme moment's excitement of my life. I feel that I owe that
young lady a great deal more than the hundred guineas I paid her
and this dinner."</p>

<p>Stephen, Earl of Martinhoe, who had just had a very
satisfactory interview with his agent, awoke to a rare
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"We must all do our best," he declared firmly, "to see that
the Baroness has a pleasant time."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="story11" name="story11">XI. &mdash; A GIFT FROM THE
GODS</a></h2>

<p class="first">CLARA'S greeting was a bit frosty. She regarded
her early morning caller with disapproval.</p>

<p>"Not even Roderigo, Duque de Partagena, Marques de Cervera y
Topete, is a welcome visitor at a business office before eleven
o'clock in the morning," she remonstrated.</p>

<p>The young man of pleasant appearance, dressed in Savile Row
tweeds, with a bunch of violets in his buttonhole, touched the
tips of her fingers with his lips and sank into the visitors'
chair. He seemed a little depressed by the coldness of his
reception.</p>

<p>"But behold," he pleaded, "mine is not a social call. I arrive
on a matter of business."</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment?" Clara asked severely.</p>

<p>"The affair which brought me here developed too quickly. I
arrived in the time it would have taken me to make an appointment
by telephone. If you had been engaged I should have waited quite
patiently."</p>

<p>Clara permitted herself a mollified smile.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"I must ask you first," the young Duke continued eagerly,
"what is your lowest fee for advice to a friend? The rendezvous
will probably take an hour of your time and there will be a
luncheon."</p>

<p>Clara tapped her teeth with the end of a lead pencil.</p>

<p>"A luncheon?" she murmured interrogatively.</p>

<p>"At the Savoy Grill room," he announced. "There must be rich
food because I entertain people of my own nationality. For you I
will order separately."</p>

<p>"The smoked salmon at the Savoy Grill last week was divine,"
she meditated.</p>

<p>"You shall commence with that," he promised her.</p>

<p>"Afterwards for you there shall be a grilled Dover sole with
roe if possible, followed by two fat quails with grape
salad."</p>

<p>"I shall reduce my fee to its minimum," she declared. "My
advice shall cost you only five guineas."</p>

<p>Roderigo produced a worn pocketbook and counted out the money.
He laid it on the edge of the desk.</p>

<p>"You permit?" he begged. "Now I make sure of your services. We
meet at one o'clock in the Grill."</p>

<p>"But listen," she remonstrated as he reached for his hat. "You
haven't stated your case yet. You have paid your money and had no
advice."</p>

<p>"I shall ask you for it when the time comes," he told her. "I
wish you to hear the story from others, not from me. Afterwards
you will put this and that together. You will question me as to
what you do not understand and you will give me your advice."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she remarked with a smile, "that you are
going to make large demands upon my intelligence for five
guineas!"</p>

<p>"There will be the luncheon!" he reminded her.</p>

<p>"I wish I were not so greedy," she sighed. "I shall be there
at one o'clock."</p>

<p>Clara found three people comfortably established in easy
chairs waiting for her in the new lounge of the Savoy Grill room
when she arrived on the following morning. Roderigo sprang at
once to his feet and advanced to meet her.</p>

<p>"You will permit," he begged, "that I present to you Senor
Sovrado and Senorita Isabella Sovrado&mdash; the Baroness
Linz."</p>

<p>A stout, heavily built man with black bristly hair, a black
moustache and carefully clipped imperial rose to his feet and
bowed. He was correctly dressed in dark clothes but his linen and
vivid purple tie were obviously not the efforts of an English
haberdasher. His complexion was pale, almost as sallow as his
tobacco stained finger-tips, his eyes were dark and restless and
he possessed an uneasy and unattractive mouth. Whatever he
lacked, however, in personal charm was atoned for by the beauty
of his daughter. She missed perhaps the exquisite slimness of the
modern young woman but her figure was nevertheless beyond
criticism and the ivory pallor of her cheeks seemed the natural
setting for her beautiful dark eyes. She greeted Clara with a
faint air of surprise, her eyebrows a little uplifted, and she
turned towards Roderigo as though for an explanation. He gave an
order for aperitifs and placed a chair for the newcomer.</p>

<p>"I have perhaps," he admitted, "confused to some extent my
friends and compatriots, Sefior Sovrado, the agent for my
estates, and Sefiorita Isabella, his daughter. A little matter of
business exists between us. I begged that I might be allowed to
introduce my adviser. They expected, without doubt, the usual
notary."</p>

<p>"I expected certainly to meet someone with whom I could
discuss a certain proposition which I have to place before my
patron," Sefior Sovrado admitted in perfect English.
"Nevertheless, if the Duke is satisfied it is not for me to
complain. The young lady will permit me to say that she possesses
an air of great intelligence."</p>

<p>The young lady accepted the compliment with a smile. There was
a sombre and suspicious light in Senorita Isabella's eyes. For
some reason or other the newcomer's appearance seemed to
disconcert her.</p>

<p>"It is incredible," she murmured, "to find that there are
women notaries in England who are qualified to give advice upon
serious matters."</p>

<p>"It is nevertheless true," Clara assured her pleasantly as she
accepted her cocktail, "that intelligence in this country is not
a matter of sex."</p>

<p>"The Baroness," Roderigo explained, "is not, of course, a
notary. She does not claim to have any legal status. She has an
acute mind, however, and she has solved many problems for people
who have found themselves in difficulties. It is good advice
which she gives and it is generally worth following."</p>

<p>"But how can she know anything about this matter which father
has been trying to arrange for you?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"It is a discussion which we might waive for the moment,"
Roderigo suggested.</p>

<p>"In fact," Sefior Sovrado observed with a sigh, "it might be
well if we decided to forget business affairs altogether for a
time or I fear that our meal might be a sad one. The news this
morning is not good, your Grace," he added solemnly.</p>

<p>"In that case let us fortify ourselves with another cocktail,"
Roderigo suggested. "No? It is against the Spanish custom, I
fear. But Baroness, will you not support me?"</p>

<p>Clara shook her head.</p>

<p>"From what I gather about it," she observed, "I shall need to
be clear headed to deal with this problem of yours. I have not a
great deal of time to spare."</p>

<p>Her host took the hint and led the way towards the restaurant.
He had turned towards Clara, but Sefiorita Isabella had laid her
compelling fingers upon his arm. She whispered something in his
ear as they passed up the steps and although his response was
vague she entered the restaurant with a smile upon her perfect
hps.</p>

<p>"My daughter," Sefior Sovrado explained to Clara as they
followed behind, "has known his Grace since she was a baby. As I
am sure you are aware, the house of Partagena stands first
amongst the nobility of Spain. I have had the honour of managing
their affairs all my life. It has been a family inheritance."</p>

<p>"Rather a troublesome one just now, I should think," Clara
commented.</p>

<p>Sovrado nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The present situation," he admitted, "is little short of
disastrous. I am in fear and trembling when I think of the news
which I have to convey to his Grace."</p>

<p>As usual when the Duke was in charge of the proceedings the
table was carefully chosen, the luncheon excellent and well
served. Clara, who had expected to be bored, found herself
somewhat intrigued. The dignified, silent man of affairs was a
new type to her as was also the Spanish girl with her flamboyant
but seductive appropriation of her host. It seemed to Clara that
it was to save himself the embarrassment of her attentions that
Roderigo insisted upon leading the conversation into business
channels almost as soon as the meal had started.</p>

<p>"You must know, Baroness," he confided, "that for generations
the family of Sovrado have been the notaries to my house. The
post has passed from father to son without a break for hundreds
of years."</p>

<p>"So Senor Sovrado was telling me," she remarked.</p>

<p>"I have been wondering how the revolution has affected the
situation?"</p>

<p>Sovrado contented himself with a groan. Roderigo smiled at her
whimsically.</p>

<p>"It is a cataclysm which has arrived," he pointed out, "or why
should I be living here, doing the work of secretary to my uncle,
without a home and with an uncertain future?"</p>

<p>"The property of most of the monarchists," the Spanish lawyer
explained, "has been confiscated by the new government. The
situation is indeed deplorable. Many of our nobility who had not
had the foresight to make some investments abroad, are now
penniless. There is a Court sitting at the present time which
decides whether sequestration is justifiable or not. So far not
one of the monarchists has escaped. The verdict has been
unanimous. In the case of my illustrious patron here, however, we
have put up a great fight. When I left Madrid, indeed, the issue
was still doubtful."</p>

<p>"Why is the Duke's case different to the others?" Clara
asked.</p>

<p>"For this reason," the notary expounded. "His Grace's father
was a far-seeing man, a man of vision and sagacity. He foresaw
what was coming, he sympathised with the peasants and he did
everything he could to improve the conditions upon his estates.
He owned enormous tracts of timber which for generations had been
allowed to increase untouched and uncared for, cumbering the land
and bringing in no profit to anybody. The late Duke turned the
whole of his peasants who found it hard to obtain a good living
from the soil into woodmen. He established a school of forestry,
he brought expert advisers from Norway, Sweden and Canada. He
built wonderful sawmills on the banks of the Guadalquivir and
even though he paid high wages the profits from his enterprise
were great. If he had invested the money in the different
capitals of Europe my illustrious patron here, the present Duke,
would have been a millionaire in English pounds many times over.
His father, however, was too fine a patriot to do anything of the
sort. He invested his profits in developing further parts of the
estates, digging up his old vines and planting fresh ones and
introducing modern types of agricultural machinery until he had
established a great corn-growing country where before there was
only a wilderness. Upon his death his Grace here, the Duke's only
son, followed enthusiastically in his father's footsteps."</p>

<p>"You never told me anything of this," Clara said, turning
reproachfully to her host.</p>

<p>"My dear Baroness," he protested, "there was so little to
tell. My enthusiasm, I am afraid, was mostly negative. A great
machine had been started. I simply let it continue to do its
work. I was never a home bird. I travelled. I entered the
Diplomatic Service."</p>

<p>"You didn't wear yourself out with work exactly, to judge from
the number of your appointments," Clara remarked.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, I did not," he acknowledged.</p>

<p>"I played the games. I gambled. I had a villa on the French
Riviera, an apartment in Paris. Yes&mdash;a hunting box in
Leicestershire. Polo stables at Ranelagh, at Rugby and at Cannes.
I raced a little too. But listen, Baroness, I never withdrew one
peseta from the industrial concerns which my father had started,
I never spent a quarter of my income. I left it to accumulate in
my own country."</p>

<p>"That is why it seems so brutal," Senorita Isabella exclaimed,
"that this new government should dare to think of seizing your
estates."</p>

<p>"Is their effort likely to be successful?" Clara enquired.</p>

<p>Sovrado groaned.</p>

<p>"At first we believed that they would surely fail," he said.
"One did not see what possible excuse they could have for such an
outrage. Their proceedings, however, so far have shocked the
whole of civilised Spain. They have appointed what they call a
Sequestration Court which deals with these matters, presided over
by three judges. They commenced by forbidding the export of a
single peseta of revenue. Since then, notwithstanding all that I
have been able to accomplish, it is hard for me to conceive how
my illustrious patron has contrived to exist. The whole business
is atrocious. The government even have dared to borrow his
capital balances giving undertakings to the Court that they will
repay if the lands be not sequestrated."</p>

<p>"When is the final decision to be given?" Clara asked.</p>

<p>"Within a few days&mdash;almost a few hours. One might even
say that it has already been given but not pronounced."</p>

<p>"I do not see that we need conceal the truth,"</p>

<p>Roderigo intervened. "According to the information which my
old friend Sovrado here has brought me, the verdict of the judges
has already been arrived at. They have decided by two to one upon
sequestration."</p>

<p>"But this is terrible," Clara exclaimed. "Do you mean that you
will lose everything?"</p>

<p>Senor Sovrado, with a lavishly perfumed handkerchief, dabbed
at the beads of sweat which had broken out upon his forehead. He
pushed his plate away from him. He had the air of a man about to
burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Every acre is to be confiscated," he groaned.</p>

<p>"Every peseta of money which they have 'borrowed' from the
Duke is to go permanently into the government's coffers. His
woods, his mines, his great farms, his palace in Madrid, his
chateau at San Sebastian are confiscated. Heirlooms which have
belonged to his family for a thousand years are to be sold by
auction for the benefit of the State. It is the most disgraceful
robbery of which a noble country like Spain has ever been
guilty."</p>

<p>Senorita Isabella's eyes were swimming with tears. Her long,
exquisitely cared for fingers twined themselves in her
neighbour's.</p>

<p>"I could kill those men," she murmured passionately. "I will
never go back to Spain. I disown it. It is my country no
longer."</p>

<p>Roderigo summoned the wine waiter and saw to it that the
glasses were replenished. Glancing curiously at her host, Clara
felt that she had never admired him more. There was not the
faintest change in his expression, not a quiver of the lips, not
a sign to show he was in any way affected by the drama of
Sovrado's recital. His voice indeed sounded gentler than usual as
he gave an order to the attentive maitre d'hotel and his greeting
of some passing acquaintances was light hearted and even gay.</p>

<p>"But tell me," Clara asked. "Has the&mdash;what do you call
it?&mdash;the verdict, the decision of the Court, already been
finally pronounced?"</p>

<p>"Not officially," Roderigo replied. "Senor Sovrado here,
however, had a long cable this morning which seems to place the
matter beyond doubt."</p>

<p>"One of the copying clerks to the Court is my nephew," Sovrado
confided. "He has warned us to be prepared for the worst. The
chief of the three judges has always been an enemy of the house
of Partagena. He even went so far last night as to hand a copy of
the decision to the editor of a Madrid newspaper."</p>

<p>"It is enough for the present," Roderigo declared, in a
suddenly changed tone. "Why should we all be made miserable
talking over my misfortunes? I have good health and I am young. I
shall not starve. London is a wonderful place. If one may not
lunch at the Ritz one finds excellent food in other places. It
was one of our own philosophers, Sovrado, who said somewhat more
elaborately that the best of God's gifts to the world are free. I
had very little hope of that Court. To-day's news does not
disappoint me."</p>

<p>Clara touched him on the hand. She was looking earnestly into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she begged. "Why was I bidden here to-day? What
possible advice could I have given you upon a matter which seems
to have passed already outside of our control?"</p>

<p>For a single moment it seemed to her that Roderigo was showing
signs of embarrassment. He glanced across at Sovrado and palpably
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was selfish of me to invite you," he admitted.
"Next time I promise that I will bid you to a more cheerful
feast...."</p>

<p>Very soon afterwards Clara took her leave. Sovrado bowed over
her fingers with much courtesy and murmured a politely
indifferent speech. Sefiorita Isabella made no pretence, however.
Her farewell was chilly in the extreme and she bit her Hp with
anger when Roderigo, after a murmured word of excuse, walked with
his departing guest to the door.</p>

<p>"I am terribly sorry," he apologised humbly. "You must not be
angry with me. I honestly did believe that a matter might arise
upon which your advice would have been very valuable."</p>

<p>"What prevented its arising?" she demanded. Roderigo was ill
at ease. His eyes met hers frankly enough but he seemed
distressed.</p>

<p>"It is very difficult," he murmured. "The matter is largely a
personal one concerned with Sovrado, my agent. He has laid a
proposition before me upon which I have to decide to-day. I
looked upon it as ordinary business arising out of his management
of my estates. Now I find that it is not so. He has committed
himself to a pledge of secrecy with the third person concerned.
It seems to me that I am bound to respect his position and decide
for myself yes or no."</p>

<p>She bade him farewell a little abruptly.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," she said, "that there are five guineas of
yours lying upon my table."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but Miss Clara," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"I do not accept a fee for advice I do not give," was her
valedictory remark.</p>

<p>Roderigo, at ten minutes to eight that evening, was glancing
through the evening paper in the tiny sitting-room of his
apartments at the back of Shepherds Market. His servant with
coat, hat and white muffler upon his arm, was standing
attentively by.</p>

<p>"If anyone rings up during my absence&mdash;" the Duke
began.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang. The elderly manservant answered
it.</p>

<p>"It is the Baroness Linz who wishes to speak to your Grace,"
he announced.</p>

<p>Roderigo threw aside his paper and took up the receiver.</p>

<p>"It is actually you, Baroness," he exclaimed in delight as he
recognised her voice. "I was so much afraid that you were angry
with me."</p>

<p>"I am not yet," she replied. "I may be soon. Tell me, are you
seeing your two friends again this evening?"</p>

<p>"You mean my agent and his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Are you seeing them again this evening?"</p>

<p>"I am dining with them at the Ritz," Roderigo confided. "I was
just starting off when the telephone bell rang. It is a great
piece of good fortune that I am still here."</p>

<p>"You may realise that some day," was the dry response. "It is
to-night, I suppose, that Senor Sovrado is to put forward that
proposition to you?"</p>

<p>"That is what I imagine," Roderigo admitted. "I do not know
what it is but it is something for which he has been working very
hard. Perhaps he has managed to smuggle a few deposits through to
an English bank."</p>

<p>"Listen," she begged. "You have paid me five guineas for my
advice. Will you take it?"</p>

<p>"Try me, if you please."</p>

<p>"You say that Senor Sovrado has some sort of proposition to
make to you. My advice is that whatever that proposition may be
you do not accept it."</p>

<p>"I say, Baroness," Roderigo protested blankly. "Do you mean
that?"</p>

<p>"I certainly mean it."</p>

<p>Roderigo was the picture of despair.</p>

<p>"But Sovrado is my agent. He knows every detail of the
estates. He may have some sort of scheme for saving something
from the wreck. However little it may be it will be welcome."</p>

<p>"My advice to you," she repeated firmly, "is that you do not
accept any proposition from Sovrado or his beautiful daughter
until you have seen me again at twelve o'clock to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>Roderigo was more than ever bewildered.</p>

<p>"But it may be very awkward," he pleaded. "If by signing a
transfer, for instance, I could get some bonds over to London it
would be very foolish of me, would it not, to miss the
opportunity? There is so little time. You heard what he said. The
judgment is already decided upon. It will be pronounced to-morrow
or the next day."</p>

<p>"Roderigo," Clara pleaded. "You have faith in me, have you
not?"</p>

<p>"From the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>"You know that at times I have given people advice which has
been very much to their benefit."</p>

<p>"Indeed you have," he agreed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, accept the advice which I am offering you
now. Do as I ask. I have nothing against your agent. I have
nothing against his seductive daughter. I only beg of you not to
agree to any proposition or sign any papers until after you have
seen me at twelve o'clock to-morrow."</p>

<p>Roderigo hesitated no longer.</p>

<p>"I consent," he decided. "It is a promise. Even if I am to
lose a great benefit I shall keep my word. Shall I come to you
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Make it half-past twelve if you don't mind," she replied,
"and meet me at the Embassy Bar."</p>

<p>The connection ceased. Roderigo accepted his coat and muffler
thoughtfully. Instinctively he adjusted his silk hat at that
slightest possible oblique angle which was permitted.</p>

<p>"I will take the latchkey, Pedro," he said, as the man
whistled for a taxi, "but I am not at all sure that I shall not
be home early. My evening does not promise well."</p>

<p>Arrived at the Ritz, Roderigo was obsequiously conducted by a
maitre d'hotel to the suite upon the first floor in the salon of
which Isabella alone was awaiting him. She held out her hands for
his salute and the light in her glowing eyes was as warm a
welcome as any man might hope for.</p>

<p>"Serve sherry now and dinner in quarter of an hour," she told
the maitre d'hotel. "Father has only just returned from the
City," she confided, leading her guest towards the divan on which
she had been seated. "I have scarcely yet had time to speak to
him but I believe that he has succeeded in what he was trying to
arrange."</p>

<p>"There has been no further news from Madrid?"</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"I fear that there is nothing more to be hoped for."</p>

<p>Roderigo shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he confessed, "it will be difficult for me
ever to repay your father's efforts on my behalf."</p>

<p>She drew him into the place by her side.</p>

<p>"He will not need repayment," she assured him.</p>

<p>"Cannot you believe that what he has done he has done from
devotion to your family&mdash;devotion which we all share?"</p>

<p>Her fingers impulsively sought his, beautiful fingers as pale
as lilies with faintly rose-coloured tips. The cadence of her
tone was in itself alluring. A sense of uneasiness crept over
him. Neither nature nor nationality had cast him for the part of
a St. Anthony and he had a devastating conviction that in another
moment those arms, as softly white as her fingers, would be
around his neck. He gave a little shiver of relief as the door
opened to admit the waiter with a decanter of sherry. He embraced
the opportunity to rise to his feet. There was further respite in
the evening papers which also lay upon the tray. He picked one up
and shook it open.</p>

<p>"You excuse?" he begged. "There is sometimes news in these
late telegrams."</p>

<p>She tried to snatch the sheet from him. There was an angry
glint now in those dusky eyes.</p>

<p>"The world has always said," she exclaimed, "that our men were
men of gallantry. Yet you would read a newspaper in my
presence!"</p>

<p>"It was only whilst the man was in the room," he pleaded
humbly. "There was Spanish news in the paper last night&mdash;of
no account, but still it was a telegram from Madrid. To-night I
see that there is nothing."</p>

<p>He laid down the sheet with a sensation of relief, for the
door leading into the further apartments of the suite had opened
and Senor Sovrado, attired for the evening, with a white gardenia
in his buttonhole, made his appearance. He welcomed his guest
obsequiously.</p>

<p>"You do us a great honour, Duke," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, be so kind as to give me a glass of
sherry at once and let dinner be served. I confess to fatigue.
The air of London is exhausting."</p>

<p>"Is all well?" Isabella asked quickly. There was something
almost beatific in her father's responsive smile.</p>

<p>"The transaction has gone through," he announced. "It was
difficult but it is done. Let that be enough for the present.
After dinner there will be a word of good news for our noble
guest."</p>

<p>She took Roderigo's arm and led him to the table.</p>

<p>"This makes me very happy," she whispered....</p>

<p>Dinner was an elaborate meal, too much so, in fact, for
Roderigo's recently anglicised taste. Senor Sovrado devoted his
whole attention to it, declining to discuss business or give any
account of his afternoon's activities. He waved aside his
daughter's questions with a self-satisfied gesture.</p>

<p>"All is well, Isabella," he declared. "With the coffee I shall
explain. Prepare for a bonne bouche, your Grace. My family has
served yours faithfully for many years, but to-night&mdash;well,
you shall hear."</p>

<p>Roderigo ate and drank moderately, smoking according to the
custom of the moment, however, endless cigarettes between the
courses. All the time he was uneasy. Clara's mysterious message
oppressed him. At any moment he felt he might be confronted with
a crisis. If only he had left his rooms a few minutes earlier!...
Interminable though it seemed the meal at last came to an end.
The table was wheeled away. Another with fruit, coffee cups and
liqueur glasses promptly took its place. Sovrado lit a large
cigar and leaned back in his chair. He had the air of a man who
embarks upon an enterprise the success of which is already
assured, yet he had also the air of a man who is not wholly at
his ease. His eyes were never entirely at rest. His fingers kept
playing with his short imperial.</p>

<p>"Now, my father," Isabella begged when the last waiter had
left the room. "You must not keep us any longer in suspense. Tell
his Grace everything."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," Roderigo remarked gloomily as he lit a fresh
cigarette, "that I know already the worst."</p>

<p>"It is time, perhaps, for the tide to turn," Sovrado
pronounced. "It is not a great thing that I have been able to do
but it is something that should make a difference. It is
something which I have had in my mind from the moment these
disturbances began but I needed an English agent to help me to
carry out my scheme. I needed too a definite assurance of the
Spanish law. Both these I have found."</p>

<p>He knocked the ash from his cigar a httle prematurely, drew a
roll of papers from his pocket and placed them by his side. Then
he continued.</p>

<p>"The judgment of the Court, your Grace, has been pronounced
and by this time is probably sealed. It has been given against
you. At mid-day tomorrow the sequestration order will be signed.
This, however, comes as no shock. We have had ample warning as to
what the decision would be."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Roderigo reflected drearily, "to exchange
fears for a certainty is always a sad business. To-morrow I shall
be a pauper."</p>

<p>Sovrado leaned across the table towards his guest. He was
showing all his white teeth. His eyes reflected fire and
steadfastness. He gesticulated with his cigar.</p>

<p>"To-morrow at the last stroke of noon you, Roderigo, Duque de
Partagena, Marques de Cervera y Topete, will be without doubt
stripped of every acre you own and every peseta of money. But to-
night, at this moment, you are very nearly the richest man in
Spain."</p>

<p>"Of what use is that?" Roderigo asked sadly.</p>

<p>"It is of this use," his agent pointed out. "Until twelve
o'clock to-morrow the Guadalquivir forests are yours. You have no
knowledge of any adverse verdict on the part of the Court and in
any case the papers of dispossession are not yet signed. The
forests are yours. It is an even chance whether, if you could
dispose of them to-night, the sale would not be legal."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Roderigo was acutely and
morbidly conscious of the harshly aromatic odour of a handful of
scarlet geraniums which Isabella was crushing together between
her fingers.</p>

<p>"Who in this world would buy them?" he demanded. "Estates that
are going to be confiscated in an hour or two?"</p>

<p>Sovrado waved his cigar wildly.</p>

<p>"Confiscated from you, but if at mid-day tomorrow they do not
belong to you it is level betting that the Court of Sequestration
has no jurisdiction over them. I have found a man who is willing
to take the risk, who will buy and pay for them to-night. All the
deeds must be signed, however, at once. That too I have arranged.
I have done more. You are to be paid for them in Bank of England
notes, paid for them before the judgment taking them out of your
hands can be passed into the book of statutes."</p>

<p>Roderigo was speechless. Sovrado, with an air of triumph,
threw himself back in his chair, laid down his extinct cigar and
mopped his forehead. Isabella, with a dawning smile upon her
lips, was leaning forward, her eyes questioning her guest.</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful scheme of my father's, is it not?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"It seems to me marvellous," Roderigo muttered. "The forests
are mine, you say, until mid-day tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Technically they are absolutely yours," Sovrado declared.
"You can deal with them as you will. Here on the table by my side
is the deed of sale. You sign that with two witnesses before a
London notary who will be in this room within an hour and you can
sleep to-night with banknotes for fifteen thousand pounds under
your pillow."</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand pounds," Roderigo repeated. Sovrado shrugged
his shoulders and held up his chubby hands.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a twentieth part of their value," he admitted.
"Perhaps a fortieth. Who can tell? I worked my hardest for the
largest sum possible. That you, my patron, who know the history
of our agelong relations can, I think, believe. Do not forget the
buyer has to take a very certain and a very definite risk with
the whole influence of this new government in Spain against him.
The Courts will probably try to upset the sale. Anything may
happen. One fact remains. There are fifteen thousand pounds in
cash for you. It is a gift from the gods."</p>

<p>"It is incredible," Roderigo murmured. Isabella rose silently
from her place. She bent over her father's shoulder, took the
sheet of paper from its place by his plate and brought it to
Roderigo. Then she crossed the room and fetched the pen and
ink.</p>

<p>"Not yet," her father said, shaking his head. "The deed of
sale must be signed in front of a notary. He will be here in half
an hour."</p>

<p>Roderigo leaned back in his chair and dug his heels into the
carpet. His moment had arrived.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said. "There are reasons which I am not able
to explain. I cannot sign that paper."</p>

<p>The storm of a quarter of an hour ended in the tornado-like
disappearance of Sovrado. Roderigo rose to his feet. He glanced
across the table to where Isabella was seated, her face buried in
her hands. For the last few minutes she had taken no part in the
furious discussion.</p>

<p>"Believe me," he said gently. "I am sorry to seem so
ungrateful. I must appear to you both to be behaving like a
lunatic. The fact remains, however, that I cannot sign that deed
of sale."</p>

<p>She removed her hands from before her face and he saw the
traces of tears there. She rose to her feet and came round the
table towards him. Before he could stop her she was on her knees
and her arms had drawn him back into his place.</p>

<p>"Tell me why," she implored. "You are a great nobleman. You
would not stoop to bargain. It is not that the money is not
enough?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not that," he assured her. "Still, I cannot
sign."</p>

<p>Her arms were like a yoke. Her face strained with passion was
uplifted to his. Her eyes prayed to him.</p>

<p>"Roderigo," she whispered. "Shall I tell you why my father has
done this? Do you know why I have helped him, why I have prayed
that he might succeed? It has been done for my sake, for my
happiness."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," he said, and he kept his tone steady,
almost cold.</p>

<p>"But you should understand," she went on piteously. "Years ago
when I was a child I worshipped you hopelessly. Our country is
not like others. If I brought you millions in those days nothing
would have been possible. Now there is a change. I have money.
Not millions, but something. With the money father could get for
this sale one could live. There is South America. Take me there.
We could change the name. I would go anywhere you wished.
Understand me, please, Roderigo! I would be your servant if you
wished. But take me and all that I have to offer."</p>

<p>He kissed her fingers gravely and relieved himself of her
arms.</p>

<p>"Such things are not possible, dear Isabella," he said.
"Believe me, I am not lacking in gratitude to you or your father.
I shall probably remain a pauper all my life because of my
obstinacy. That is of no consequence. I may be robbed of my
inheritance but I will not sell the Guadalquivir forests, I will
not sign any such deed as your father has presented to me."</p>

<p>She leaped suddenly to her feet. Her passion seemed to have
changed. There was hate rather than love in her eyes as she faced
him with swelling bosom and choked breath.</p>

<p>"Is it that you do not trust us?" she cried. "My father, who
has served you like a slave! I who have bitten the dust at your
feet!"</p>

<p>He had his moment and he escaped whilst the white flame of her
anger still scorched.</p>

<p>"This is the trick of peasants, this pertinacity," he
declared. "You must forgive me if I find myself with no more to
say than this&mdash;the lands of my ancestors can be stolen from
me by my misguided countrypeople, but they cannot be bought."</p>

<p>The Embassy Bar as usual was packed on the following morning
when Clara passed through a little flutter of friendly greetings
to the table in the corner which Roderigo had managed to reserve.
He bowed woefully over her fingers and gave an order to the
waiter.</p>

<p>"You are depressed?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Who would not be?" he answered, with the faintest note of
petulance in his tone. "Yesterday and the yesterdays before I was
poor indeed inasmuch as my pockets were empty but to-day I am a
pauper for all eternity."</p>

<p>"Whence comes this sudden stroke of ill fortune?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>"At mid-day," he confided, "judgment in the Spanish Court of
Sequestration was pronounced against me. I should not grumble. I
follow in the wake of my sire and many other famous people. I am
dispossessed."</p>

<p>"Dispossessed?"</p>

<p>"The new government has taken over my estates. The judgment of
the Court was decided upon yesterday. The order was signed at
mid-day."</p>

<p>"Dear me," she exclaimed, smiling at him with a light of
banter in her eyes. "I am afraid that you have been listening to
gossip."</p>

<p>"To gossip? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"To reports from ill informed people."</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"I heard the truth from Sovrado, my own agent," he told her.
"The decision in my case was arrived at yesterday and pronounced
to-day at twelve o'clock. I simply take my place amongst the
others. The government has confiscated my lands, my quarries, my
forests and my bank balances."</p>

<p>Clara remained silent for a moment whilst the waiter deposited
the two cocktails which he had ordered upon the table. As soon as
he had gone she leaned towards her companion.</p>

<p>"Drink the whole of your Martini," she invited. He obeyed
promptly.</p>

<p>"I was feeling very much like that," he admitted.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"You needed that one to help you bear a shock," she explained.
"You will need the next one for us to drink to your good fortune.
Judgment was pronounced by the Spanish Courts yesterday and the
result will certainly be in to-morrow morning's Times. You are
the first member of the Spanish aristocracy whose lands have not
been confiscated. Thanks to your father, Roderigo, who must have
been a very wonderful man, judgment was given in your
favour."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" he gasped and broke down through sheer
inability to control his words.</p>

<p>"I mean that nothing you possess has been confiscated," she
assured him. "The demand of the Republic has been refused. The
only stipulation attached to the judgment, so far as I remember,
was that you present yourself in Spain within thirty days and
undertake either to continue the work upon your estates or form a
company that will do so."</p>

<p>"But last night," Roderigo protested, pale as death but with
his self control re-established, "last night Sovrado, my agent,
whom I have known since I was a child, assured me that all was
lost. He brought me a small offer for the Guadalquivir forest
lands, something which was to secure me against penury, to be
signed while the lands were still mine."</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>"I distrusted that gentleman with the beautiful daughter from
the moment I saw him," she confided.</p>

<p>"That is why I made you give me that promise to sign nothing.
If you had not kept your word it is he who would have been the
owner of the Guadalquivir forest lands at about a fiftieth of
their value."</p>

<p>"Sovrado! Do you mean to tell me that Sovrado is not honest?
Isabella!"</p>

<p>"Honest enough, I dare say, both of them in normal times,"
Clara replied coolly. "Rascal and adventuress in this great
crisis."</p>

<p>For a moment he held his head.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Baroness," he pleaded, "but do you know what
you're talking about?"</p>

<p>She smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Have you ever known me when I didn't?" she demanded. "I will
admit that I've been in great luck this time. I do not know a
soul at the Spanish Embassy but it just happens that the Spanish
Consul, Senor Parascato, is a great friend of mine. He was Consul
in New York years ago. I went straight down to see him yesterday
after leaving you&mdash;all the way to Queen Victoria Street if
you please&mdash;and what I didn't learn from him he found out
for me from others. You won't see anything more of your late
agent, Roderigo. The reason that I was a few minutes late here
was that I waited for the report of my messenger who saw them off
from Croydon. They hired a special plane to Le Bourget to catch
the Madrid train.... Now you can drink that second cocktail. You
are still the Duque Roderigo de Partagena. You are still the
Marques de Cervera y Topete. You are still the owner of a few
hundred thousand acres of Spanish soil. And, from what my friend
the Consul told me, very much a millionaire! But you do need
someone to look after you."</p>

<p>His eyes flamed into hers.</p>

<p>"Will you be that someone?" he begged.</p>

<p>"I will not be proposed to in a bar," she objected.</p>

<p>"What about the stairs?" he asked breathlessly, as they rose
to their feet.</p>

<p>"This place is very crowded to-day," she meditated, faintly
returning the pressure of his fingers.</p>

<p>"I have always thought that it would be very romantic to be
proposed to in a taxi. You see, the sun has arrived at last. Let
us drive down to Ranelagh and lunch there."</p>

<p>They passed up the stairs and down the arcade. On the pavement
Roderigo summoned the commissionaire.</p>

<p>"Taxi, please," he ordered.</p>
