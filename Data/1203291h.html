<p class="first">MR. SAMUEL T. BILLINGHAM of New York, recently
landed from the great liner anchored a few miles out, walked
along the Terrace at Monte Carlo, serene, light-hearted,
beatifically content. His yellow shoes and his variegated socks
might be described as a trifle vivid, but the rest of his
attire&mdash;his well-pressed grey suit, his irreproachable
linen, and his well-shaped grey Homburg hat&mdash;was beyond
criticism. He was a man of medium height, thick-set, inclined a
little, perhaps, to embonpoint. His complexion was pink, his
flaxen hair only slightly streaked with grey, his eyes filled
with the light of good-humour. He was possibly about forty-five
years of age, but he walked with the spring of a young man. In
his pocket was his carte de saison for the Cercle Prive and card
of membership of the Sporting Club, taken out an hour or so
before. In the same pocket was also a well-filled money case,
and in his mind the consciousness of pleasant quarters in his
favourite hotel, and the knowledge that he was in the spot which
he loved more than any place on earth. Furthermore, he was
pleasantly aware of the fact that he was in the immediate
neighbourhood of various interesting little rendezvous where
restrictions as to any refreshment he might deem advisable for
his welfare were non-existent; where compatriots were always to
be found and amusement plentiful. Mr. Samuel T. Billingham,
brimming over with good-humour, was certainly an agreeable
circumstance in a wonderful setting.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven o'clock&mdash;Mr. Billingham was a man of
regular habits&mdash;he quitted the promenade, crossed the Place
in front of the Casino, and selected a table outside the
Café de Paris. He selected it simply because it happened
to be the nearest empty one and without even a glance at his
neighbours. It was nevertheless, without a doubt, by the
direction of that mysterious influence called fate that he
should have chosen that particular chair and ordered his
champagne cocktail with that clear and pleasant directness of
speech which caused the two people at the adjacent table to turn
and focus their attention upon him.</p>

<p>"A champagne cocktail," he enjoined confidently, frankly
ignoring the fact that he was addressing a foreigner, "and some
of them little salted nuts&mdash;and say, get a move on!"</p>

<p>The waiter hurried off. Mr. Samuel T. Billingham looked
around him genially and met the faintly amused, gently enquiring
gaze of his neighbours. Mr. Billingham smiled back again but at
that moment no words were exchanged.</p>

<p>The man and the girl were of ingratiating, even distinguished
appearance. The former seemed to be about fifty or perhaps
fifty-five years of age. He was tall and thin, dressed in dark
clothes from which the first freshness had gone, and though no
fault could have been found with his linen or the less important
appurtenances of his toilette, it was noticeable that his shirt
cuffs were a little frayed, his patent boots a little cracked,
his coat a little shiny at the seams. His face was gaunt, his
eyes were deep-set, but his mouth had a most attractive and
humorous outline. The girl with whom he was seated and at whom
Mr. Billingham had permitted himself a single glance of
admiration, was young enough to be his daughter, but bore him no
resemblance. Her hair was of a most attractive shade of brown
and her eyes were of the very darkest shade of blue. She seemed
pale from the absence of all cosmetics, but her lack of colour
was, as a matter of fact, healthy and natural. There was
something a little insolent about her expression, as though she
were one of those often at war with the world and circumstances,
but amongst the cosmopolitan little crowd by which they were
surrounded she preserved an air of distinction which a keen
student of his fellow-creatures, such as Mr. Billingham, was not
slow to recognise. He waited for his cocktail without impatience
and with the air of one entirely satisfied with himself and his
particular corner of the world. Meanwhile the man and the girl
talked&mdash;the former in broken English&mdash;and, although
they never seemed to raise their voices, every word they said
was audible to their neighbour.</p>

<p>"It is incredible, Madelon," her companion exclaimed
irritably, "that you should have been so careless! Our day is
spoilt."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she replied humbly. "It is not often I
forget such things. As you told me, I put three mille notes in
my little sacque early this morning. Then, alas! the sun came
out, I wore a different dress, and I brought the other sacque.
There it is upon my dressing-table!"</p>

<p>"And here are we," the man grumbled, "without a penny to pay
for our consommation, to say nothing of luncheon. Furthermore,
there are the Rooms and perhaps a fortune waiting. Last night I
dreamed of fourteen, three times following."</p>

<p>"It is not so wonderful," she declared a little pettishly.
"You always dream of fourteen, but it never arrives."</p>

<p>The champagne cocktail, well frosted and with a thin line of
sugar around the rim of the glass, was brought to Mr.
Billingham, who accepted it with an air of content. The eyes of
the man and the girl rested for a moment upon the glass with a
veiled expression of envy. Mr. Billingham lifted his hat and
leaned forward.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">Mr. Billingham lifted his hat and leaned
forward.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Sir," he said, addressing the man, "I am blessed, or should
I say cursed, with acute hearing. From what you were saying to
the young lady I gather that you have left your money at
home."</p>

<p>His neighbour, also with his hat slightly uplifted, listened
with an air of grave embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Sir," he rejoined, "I regret that, in some temporary
excitement, owing to the discovery of my niece's carelessness,
my voice was a little raised. May I venture to suggest, however,
that my conversation was not intended to reach the ear of a
stranger, nor can I&mdash;pardon me&mdash;understand what
significance it can have for him."</p>

<p>"That's very well put," Mr. Billingham commented approvingly.
"I'm rather a plain-spoken man myself, but what I figured out in
my own mind was that this being my first morning in Monte Carlo
after an absence of a good many years, and this being my
favourite spot upon the earth, and the sun shining and my
cocktail looking pretty good, I thought perhaps I might take the
liberty of inviting you and the young lady to join me."</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman rose to his feet, hat in hand, and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "we shall accept your courtesy in&mdash;may I
say&mdash;a spirit of reciprocity. Permit me to present my
niece, Mademoiselle Madelon de Felan. I myself am known as the
Marquis de Felan."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham rose also to his feet, lifted his hat, fumbled
in his pocket and produced a card. "Samuel T. Billingham is my
name, sir," he announced. "I come from New York and I'm
interested in linoleum&mdash;that is to say, I was, only I've
recently sold out. Pleased to meet you both....
<i>Gar&ccedil;on</i>!"</p>

<p>Their prospective host accepted an invitation to bring his
chair to the table of his new acquaintances, and the succeeding
half-an-hour passed agreeably enough. Certain orders concerning
champagne cocktails were given and repeated whilst the usual
amenities of general conversation were exchanged.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of moving on to Ciro's presently," Mr.
Billingham announced, glancing at his watch. "We might try one
there and, say, why shouldn't you and the young lady join me in
a bite of luncheon."</p>

<p>The girl laughed at him pleasantly&mdash;and it was &bull; a
very pleasant laugh indeed.</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry," she murmured.</p>

<p>The Marquis was touched.</p>

<p>"Really, sir," he said, "your kindness is astounding. We will
join you on the distinct understanding that we are allowed
within the course of the next few days to reciprocate your
hospitality."</p>

<p>"Good enough!" Mr. Billingham assented. "That goes, then!
We'll move on as soon as the garfon has brought me my change.
Now promise you won't go back on our luncheon engagement,
whatever happens."</p>

<p>"Not a chance," the girl assured him, with that twinkle in
her eyes which Mr. Billingham was already beginning to love.
"I'm far too hungry, and Ciro's is my favourite restaurant."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," Mr. Billingham concluded, drawing his
chair up a little closer. "So long as it's understood that you
don't take offence, I just want to ask you one thing. Do I look
such an almighty hayseed that you should pick me out to try that
old wheeze on?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. The orchestra rattled on, corks
still popped, a pleasant murmur of conversation swelled and
flowed around. The man and the girl,' however, remained
speechless. The latter had lost that smile of pleasant
anticipation; her face was suddenly a little drawn and troubled.
The man seemed older. His manner, however, preserved its
dignity.</p>

<p>"Sir," he began</p>

<p>"Cut it out," Mr. Billingham begged. "I know pretty well what
I look like, but you see it's my job to look like it. Any one
would think I was what I want them to think me&mdash;an American
traveller, over here, probably for the first time in his life,
with plenty of the stuff. Well, I ain't! I'm from the United
States all right, but I'm looking after a little bit of that
stuff myself. Perhaps that's why I sized you two up so
easily."</p>

<p>The Marquis half rose to his feet. Mr. Billingham pulled him
back into his chair.</p>

<p>"Look here," he insisted genially, "cut out the starch. I'm a
bit of a crook&mdash;I'll admit that&mdash;but I'm not a bad
sort and I've taken a fancy to you two. We're going on to Ciro's
and we're going to have that little lunch together. I can pay
for it all right, and dinner afterwards most likely. No reason
why we shouldn't have a pleasant day together. We might even get
to talking business." The Marquis coughed. He was beginning to
recover himself.</p>

<p>"We will certainly accompany you to Ciro's&mdash;
er&mdash;Mr. Billingham," he assented. "In the meantime tell me,
I beg of you, why you arrived at the conclusion that my niece
and I were&mdash;er?"</p>

<p>"I figured it out this way," Mr. Billingham interrupted. "You
are both French. What did you want to talk in English for except
that you wanted me to understand? That was enough for me to be
going on with!"</p>

<p>"Our story is a sad one," the Marquis commenced.</p>

<p>"Say, we'll have that after luncheon," Mr. Billingham
suggested, rising to his feet.... The cocktails at Ciro's
were equal to Mr. Billingham's anticipations, and the luncheon
which he presently ordered was entirely satisfactory.
Conversation, so far as his two guests were concerned, was a
little stilted and diffident. Their host, however, was
absolutely at his ease.</p>

<p>"I guess you wouldn't believe it, you two," he recounted, as
they attacked a wonderful selection of hors d'ouevres, "but I
was once a rich man, and I never got such fun out of life in
those days as I am helping myself to now. I figure it out like
this. When you've got your money in the Bank, and the bits
coming in, you're kind of tied up with respectability. Now,
since I was a lad I've always been for adventures, and there's
only one sort of adventure that counts, and that is the
adventure which sets your brain against another man's and brings
you in the stuff if you come out on top. It don't seem to me
that a rich man has got any fighting outlook on life.... Do
you get me, Miss de Felan?"</p>

<p>"I understand what you mean," she replied, a little
dubiously, "but I am afraid I do not agree with you. You see, I
have always been poor, and I hate poverty."</p>

<p>"Might be kind of different for a young woman," Mr.
Billingham conceded thoughtfully, "but for a man, to go about
the world doing no one any particular harm but living by his
wits and what he can make by being a trifle smarter than other
people, that's my idea of a happy time! I don't mind telling you
that my present job over here is to swindle a man out of half a
million dollars."</p>

<p>"Half a million dollars!" the Marquis gasped. "It is
incredible!"</p>

<p>"What an imagination!" the girl sighed. "What courage!"</p>

<p>"I guess I'm not out for pinching old ladies' reticules,"
their host confided. "I like a big deal. And," he went on,
leaning a little across the table, "if I can make up my mind
that you two are to be trusted&mdash;I'm not saying I mightn't
let you in on this little affair. I need just the sort of help
you might be able to give, and that's a fact!"</p>

<p>The Marquis concealed his impatience with all the restraint
which was doubtless an inheritance of his breeding. He polished
a worn and scratched horn-rimmed eyeglass with a clean but
frayed handkerchief and prepared to listen with tolerant
partiality. The girl, however, was frankly eager. She leaned
across towards her host, her elbows upon the table, her chin
supported by her two hands. There was a light in her very
beautiful eyes which was almost adoring.</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, Mr. Billingham," she begged. "We are so
very poor and I am tired of being poor."</p>

<p>"My niece has the natural desire of the young for luxuries,"
the Marquis observed. "Frankly, 1 have outlived the necessity
for wealth. My modest dejeuner here or at the Hotel de Paris, my
dinner, my bottle of Burgundy, my choice of brandies, carte
blanche at my tailors, a mille or two to play with when the
fancy seizes me, are all I wish for."</p>

<p>"You don't aim at putting together a pile for later on in
life?" Mr. Billingham queried.</p>

<p>The Marquis sighed.</p>

<p>"That is beyond my hopes," he admitted.</p>

<p>"And you, Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>The girl was terribly in earnest.</p>

<p>"If I had the chance," she said, "I would save. I love all
the things which go to making life here so delightful, but more
than anything else on earth I should love my independence. I
should love to feel that it was no longer necessary for me to
worry to-morrow as to how I was going to pay the next day's
bills."</p>

<p>"Good spirit!" Mr. Billingham approved. "Good spirit,
that!"</p>

<p>"Madelon is more practical than I," the Marquis sighed. "And
now concerning that little affair of business, Mr. Billingham,
you were about to place before us."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's attention, however, had wandered. He was
watching the approach of an obvious compatriot&mdash;a man the
very antithesis of himself, but with equally distinct
transatlantic attributes; a small man with a sallow face and
little hair, teeth stopped plentifully with gold, a wizened
expression about the mouth, a short-sighted squint, neat clothes
and square-toed shoes. Mr. Billingham welcomed him as a long-lost
brother.</p>

<p>"Say, if this isn't Joe Gascoigne!" he exclaimed. "Well,
well, when did you come along?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne's reciprocating smile was frosty. His manner
showed him to be a man of reserves.</p>

<p>"Paris, last night," he answered. "How's oil?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>"Can't say those new lands are panning out quite as we
expected," he admitted.</p>

<p>"No gushers?" Mr. Gascoigne enquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing of that sort reported up to the present," was the
cautious but somewhat depressed reply. "Still, one never knows.
Where there's oil there's hope! Where are you staying?"</p>

<p>"Hotel de Paris."</p>

<p>"Fine!" Mr. Billingham commented. "Sold your option yet,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"I guess I didn't come to Monte Carlo to talk business," the
other rejoined, as he turned to pass on his way down the
room.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was thoughtful for a moment or two after his
friend's departure. The fact, however, did not impair his
appetite.</p>

<p>"Why did you not present your friend?" the girl enquired. "I
thought Americans always introduced everybody."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled.</p>

<p>"That," he explained, "is the man whom we are going to rob.
In case you come into the game, I didn't ask you to shake hands
with him. He's as near-sighted as a clam and too vain to wear
spectacles."</p>

<p>"He is presumably wealthy," the Marquis ventured.</p>

<p>"He is of the genus known as 'millionaire,'" Mr. Billingham
acquiesced.</p>

<p>The Marquis nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"To rob the rich," he murmured, "is a reasonable hobby."</p>

<p>"When you add to that," Mr. Billingham continued, "that Joe
Gascoigne is the doggonest, meanest cuss that ever drank water
and preached prohibition, you've got him sized up about
right."</p>

<p>"To rob such a man," the Marquis suggested
hopefully&mdash;"or shall I say to assist in the redistribution
of his wealthy&mdash;would seem to be a charity. Five hundred
thousand dollars, I think you said, sir?"</p>

<p>"Maybe more," Mr. Billingham assented. "It's like enough I'll
take you two in, but we'll quit it now until later on. I've got
to size you up a bit more first.... Some salmon, this!" he
added, almost reverently, as he laid down his fork. "The sauce
tastes good to me, too!"</p>

<p>"Loire salmon," the Marquis confided. "Very good fish, but
short season."</p>

<p>"Supposing you get on with that sad story of yours, Marquis,"
Mr. Billingham proposed, as they waited for the next course. "I
don't say as I'm going to believe every word of it, mind you,
but I'd like to hear your own account of yourself and the young
lady."</p>

<p>The Marquis was a little stiff at first, but he gradually
warmed to his task. He came, it appeared, of a noble but
impoverished family, and his various attempts at earning an
honest living had met with a singular lack of success. He had
been, in turn, a vineyard proprietor, a vendor of wines, an
insurance agent, and had interested himself in a cigarette
business. In all of these undertakings he had suffered from lack
of capital. A year ago the daughter of his only brother, who had
married an Englishwoman, was left with practically no one else
to look after her. They had lived in Paris for some short time
upon the very trifling sum of money which she had brought with
her. A small investment in a lottery business had been a
failure. Behold them at Monte Carlo, practically destitute!</p>

<p>It was becoming indeed a question of money sufficient for a
meal between them. Mademoiselle Madelon was ready to give French
lessons, and she had some knowledge of typing. The Marquis had
even gone so far as to offer himself as a sort of super-guide to
strangers of wealth to whom the best restaurants and manifold
pleasures of the place were unknown.</p>

<p>"Ever any trouble with the police?" Mr. Billingham asked.</p>

<p>"Not in these parts," the Marquis hastened to explain. There
had been some slight misunderstanding in Paris, he added, with
reference to his mismanagement of a gambling club, and the
investigation into his lottery business had made a hurried
departure from the city advisable. Here, however, they had a
clean sheet; had modest rooms at an unpretentious hotel, and so
far had paid their way.</p>

<p>"I sized you both up as being amateurs in this crook
business," Mr. Billingham observed. "You may make good at it, of
course, but I am not so sure about the young lady&mdash;kind of
dangerous, with her appearance!"</p>

<p>"Sir," the Marquis replied, "I am a man of honour, but
frankly I think that my niece should make more use of her
undoubted attractions. She receives many invitations to lunch or
dine with acquaintances, all of which she refuses. I think that
she is wrong."</p>

<p>Madelon remained undisturbed. The frank admiration with which
her host was contemplating her brought only a slight tinge of
colour into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"My uncle thinks always," she explained, "of some millionaire
or nobleman who will invite me to lunch and find me so charming
that he will propose marriage to me. Our acquaintances,
unfortunately, are of the bar or the Casino, and I do not fancy
that they are quite of the class likely to propose marriage to
an honest but impecunious young woman."</p>

<p>"One nevur knows," the Marquis grumbled. "This is the land of
chance, and in case of trouble you have always me to protect
you."</p>

<p>Madelon preserved a tactful silence and the luncheon drew on
to its close. After he had paid the bill, Mr. Billingham
produced five hundred-franc notes.</p>

<p>"What about dining with me to-night?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Two good meals in one day!" the girl exclaimed
blissfully.</p>

<p>"We shall be charmed," the Marquis assented, with a courteous
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>"I have only one evening dress," the girl observed
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"One will be all you need," was her prospective host's
cheerful rejoinder. "I'll get a corner table in the Sporting
Club. And if I can see my way to letting you in on this little
job of mine I'll tell you about it. In the meantime if five
hundred francs"</p>

<p>"As a loan, my dear sir&mdash;a loan!" the Marquis
interrupted, stretching out his hand eagerly.</p>

<p>"Precisely," Mr. Billingham agreed. "Three for you, sir, and
two for the young lady."</p>

<p>The Marquis clutched his three without hesitation; Madelon
made no movement.</p>

<p>"I do not think that we ought to take this money until we are
sure that there is something we can do to earn it," she said,
looking at Mr. Billingham with doubt in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"It is for&mdash;how you say it?&mdash;a lien upon our
services," her uncle declared, thrusting the notes deep down
into his pocket. "We are now at Mr. Billingham's commands. You
look at the affair in that light, I am sure, my dear sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham lit a cigar and smiled.</p>

<p>"I guess that's the idea, sir," he acquiesced. "Don't let me
keep you. I see you are kind of fidgety to be off."</p>

<p>The Marquis rose to his feet; Madelon laid her hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>"Not to the Rooms just yet," she begged.</p>

<p>"My dear," he replied tolerantly, "have no fear. I shall play
carefully; start with the little gold pieces, force my luck as I
win. Later on I will show you something!"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," Mr. Billingham reminded them, as he took leave
of his guests, "at eight-thirty at the Sporting Club."</p>

<p>Perhaps because of the smallness of the room and the absence
of any orchestral music, the babel of conversation at the
Sporting Club was that night almost deafening. Under its cover
Mr. Samuel T. Billingham took his two guests into his
confidence.</p>

<p>"It ain't worth while," he began, leaning forward so that the
three heads nearly touched, "to try and put you wise to all the
details but, as a business proposition, this is how the matter
stands. That swab of a fellow, Joseph Gascoigne, whom you saw at
luncheon time, has got an option on ten thousand shares in an
oil tract out in Arkansas&mdash;the 'Great Divide,' they call
it. He left 'em some money for a new plant a year ago and
insisted on the option in return. The option's up on Saturday.
Last month they struck oil in eleven different places. Luckily
the boss of the company was down there and he had all work
stopped at once. It's a big find, though, and if Joe Gascoigne
gets to hear of it and exercises the option, it means that he'll
buy ten thousand shares at a hundred dollars that are certainly
worth a thousand dollars and maybe worth twice as much."</p>

<p>"What happens to the shares if Mr. Gascoigne does not
exercise his option?'1 the girl asked. Mr. Billingham looked at
her with a smile of admiration.</p>

<p>"A cute question," he admitted. "Those shares are divided
equally amongst the five directors&mdash;or, rather, they are
allowed to buy them at a low price. Now, I'm well in with the
boss of this company and he knows I don't mind a bit of crooked
work occasionally. If I, or we, can stop Joe Gassoigne cabling
to America before Saturday and taking up his option, there's
fifteen thousand dollars coming to me."</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand dollars!" the girl murmured.</p>

<p>The Marquis rolled his eyes in silent ecstasy.</p>

<p>"An affair of two hundred thousand francs!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"What makes me look for a trifle of help in the matter," Mr.
Billingham continued, "is that Joe is kind of wise to my being
in with the crowd, and if he sees too much of me he'll be
suspicious."</p>

<p>"You have some sort of a plan?" Madelon demanded
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I'd like his code," Mr. Billingham confided. "It's the
simplest affair&mdash;two typewritten pages inside blue
cardboard covers with just paper fasteners through. There ain't
more than twenty or thirty sentences there, and the only other
man who has a copy is his partner in New York. I know he means
to sit tight until the last moment, and I know he's moving
heaven and earth to discover whether there's any truth in the
rumours of a gush, or whether it's a rig to make him buy the
shares. He's getting cables most days, and he won't send his off
until Friday. I had a man on the boat," Mr. Billingham went on
reflectively, "who could have had the code in a minute, but Joe
was too artful for him. He handed it over to the purser with his
valuables directly he boarded the steamer. In Paris he changed
his hotel, so we didn't get a show there. That didn't worry me
any, though, for I knew he was coming here. He's in room number
246, Hotel de Paris, and he uses the code book every day. What I
want is to get hold of the book for an hour without his knowing,
and then replace it."</p>

<p>"You don't want the book destroyed, then?" Madelon
enquired.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," was the prompt response. "Joe would
tumble to it right away that there was something doing, and he'd
cable out directly for the shares."</p>

<p>"It is a deeficult matter," the Marquis mused.</p>

<p>The girl said nothing. She was looking down at her plate with
a thoughtful smile upon her lips. Mr. Billingham watched her. He
had noticed that smile once before during the last few
minutes.</p>

<p>"You have an idea, Mademoiselle?" he ventured. She
nodded.</p>

<p>"This morning," she confided, "I went to a bureau here to try
to find a post as lady's companion or secretary. There was
nothing of the sort to be had. The only vacancies were for
chamber-maids at the Hotel de Paris."</p>

<p>The Marquis burst into excited and fluent French. Madelon
stopped him with a superb little gesture.</p>

<p>"You have perhaps made a fortune this afternoon with the
money lent you by monsieur?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Her uncle's excitement subsided. He sighed mournfully.</p>

<p>"I chose the wrong tables," he confessed. "My numbers were
everywhere, all around me, save at the tables where I
played."</p>

<p>"That means," the girl pointed out, "that you have lost
everything. We have no money, we cannot pay monsieur what he has
advanced us. I find that situation more humiliating than to
figure as a chamber-maid for a week at the Hotel de Paris."</p>

<p>"It's an idea," Mr. Billingham admitted, "but the Hotel is a
big place. How do you know, supposing they take you on, that you
will be anywhere near Joe Gascoigne's rooms?"</p>

<p>"I have spoken several times to the housekeeper," Madelon
explained. "I may be able to arrange it. It seems to me worth
trying. I can think of nothing else."</p>

<p>"To-day is Monday," Mr. Billingham reflected. "We have until
Friday at least. Joe has promised to cable on Friday. He'll wait
until then for the latest information. What I'd like to see you
do, Mademoiselle, is to go back to your rooms, change that very
becoming frock, put on your old clothes, and try and land the
job at the Hotel de Paris. There's no sense in wasting
time."</p>

<p>"Supposing I get the book, what do I do with it?" Madelon
enquired.</p>

<p>"You will bring it right to me in room number 114 of the same
hotel," Mr. Billingham replied. "You will let me have it for
about half an hour. Then you'll fetch it away again and try to
leave it where you found it."</p>

<p>The Marquis sighed.</p>

<p>"I much regret the fact," he said, "that my niece is
subjecting herself to indignity and perhaps trouble in this
affair. I wish very much that it were possible for me to take a
more active share in the business."</p>

<p>"You may do your bit yet," Mr. Billingham promised him,
dryly. "Now, say, how much have you left of that five hundred
francs?"</p>

<p>"Not a centime," was the dismal reply. "My niece,
however"</p>

<p>"I have a hundred francs," the young lady interrupted, "and I
am sorry, Uncle, but I mean to keep it. I cannot go to this
place penniless."</p>

<p>"Of course not," Mr. Billingham agreed, drawing out his
pocket-book and extracting from it a five-hundred-franc note.
"You can have that for your evening's amusement, Marquis, on
account of what may be coming to you when we succeed. When you
have lost that, however, nothing doing! Remember that!"</p>

<p>The Marquis' smile was one of superb confidence. The note was
already buttoned up in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I shall win!" he declared.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Gascoigne, although not in the strict sense of the
word a susceptible man, was not wholly insensible to feminine
attractions. Seated at his desk with a pile of cable forms
before him and an open manuscript code book on his left-hand
side, he heard the soft ingress of his very attractivelooking
chamber-maid into the bathroom. He laid down his pen and
listened. It was she beyond a doubt. It was an occasion to
progress a little in the flirtation which he had already
essayed. He crossed the room.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Late this morning, aren't you?" he remarked, looking
into the bathroom.</p>

<p>Madelon glanced at him from behind a barricade of towels.</p>

<p>"There is so much to do," she complained. "One fatigues
oneself here terribly."</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne smiled palely. It was an opening.</p>

<p>"The work is too hard for you," he declared. "How would you
like to leave it and let me find you something easier?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur!" she sighed.</p>

<p>He advanced a little nearer.</p>

<p>"I've had my eye on you all this week," he confided. "You're
too good for this job. Give 'em notice. Leave right away. Say
where you live and I'll come round this afternoon, and I bet you
we fix up something a good deal better than this." Madelon was
half-distressed, half-overcome by some sort of emotion. Mr.
Gascoigne smiled and drew out his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Say, do you know what this is?" he asked. "Guess you don't
come across many of them. It's a mille note! Put it in your
pocket, drop those towels, give me a kiss, and go and tell the
housekeeper you've found a better job."</p>

<br>

"Say, do you know what this is?" he asked. "Guess you<br>
don't come across many of them. It's a mille note!"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Madelon gazed at the mille note ecstatically.</p>

<p>"But Monsieur is generous!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Monsieur's telephone-bell rang. He turned away with
annoyance.</p>

<p>"Wait one second," he begged. "I'll be right back....
Well, what's the matter?" he demanded down the telephone.</p>

<p>It was the hotel clerk who spoke. A gentleman was below
begging that Mr. Gascoigne would spare him five minutes on a
matter of urgent importance. The gentleman declined to mount. He
would only say that his business had some connection with
America.</p>

<p>"I'll be right down," Mr. Gascoigne announced, and hastened
back to where Madelon was still engaged with the towels.</p>

<p>"Say, you're not in a hurry, are you?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"I do what you tell me," she assured him, clutching the mille
note tightly in her fingers and smiling at him bewitchingly. "I
go home now&mdash;15, Avenue de Mimosas. I wait until you
come."</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne hesitated. Madelon was looking very attractive,
but the door was open and the visit of the gentleman downstairs
intrigued him. He patted her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'll be round directly after lunch," he promised. "We'll fix
up something right away...."</p>

<p>In the hall the hotel clerk directed his attention to the
Marquis, who, with sundry of the slightly shabby details of his
toilet now amended, presented an impressive appearance. His
manner, however, as he stepped forward to accost Mr. Gascoigne,
was a little furtive. He had the air of not being entirely at
his ease.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gascoigne, I believe," he murmured.</p>

<p>"That's my name," was the somewhat surprised admission. "What
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I am the Marquis de Felan," the visitor announced. "I desire
a few minutes' conversation with you&mdash;not here, if
possible. Will you step across with me to the Café de
Paris?"</p>

<p>"But I don't know you," Mr. Gascoigne objected. "What
business can you have with me?"</p>

<p>"Business of little importance to myself, perhaps," was the
guarded reply, "but of the utmost importance to you. I can put
you in possession of information with regard to some business
which you propose to transact to-day or to-morrow&mdash;very
important information."</p>

<p>A light began to break in upon Mr. Gascoigne.</p>

<p>"Say, didn't I see you lunching with that fellow Billingham?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"You did," the Marquis acknowledged. "It is in connection
with something which transpired at that luncheon"</p>

<p>"I'll come right along with you," Mr. Gascoigne interrupted.
"I've got a hat in the cloak-room here. One moment!..."</p>

<p>The two men left the place together, the Marquis still with
the air of one desiring to escape observation. He glanced to the
right and to the left in constant disquietude. At the
Café de Paris he led the way to a corner of the bar. Then
he sat down with an air of relief.</p>

<p>"Now let's get to business," Mr. Gascoigne begged.</p>

<p>The Marquis glanced towards the bartender. His companion
accepted the hint and ordered refreshments.</p>

<p>"My business," the Marquis commenced, "is that I have been
insulted by a person who is, I believe, a fellow-countryman of
yours."</p>

<p>"Samuel Billingham?" Mr. Gascoigne muttered.</p>

<p>"That is his name," the Marquis admitted.</p>

<p>"You will understand, sir, that I am not a man of wealth,
that I am indeed a very poor man. Under circumstances which I
need not detail, I invited Mr. Billingham to oblige me with a
small loan:&mdash;no more than ten milles. It is there that he
insults me."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't part, eh?" Mr. Gascoigne queried.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," the Marquis rejoined, "he offered to
increase the amount, but on a condition so loathsome that to
mention it gives me pain. He wished me to join in a plot to
deceive you concerning the value of some shares in
Arkansas."</p>

<p>"The devil he did!" the other exclaimed. "Say, this is
interesting!"</p>

<p>"To me it was a situation most humiliating," the Marquis
declared. "Tears were in my eyes as I listened to his infamous
proposition. I made no promise. I left him. He confided in me
the value of those shares and all about them. I say nothing. I
make him no promise. He tempted me with the money. It is a
terrible thing, Mr. Gascoigne, to be poor. Then I asked myself
what an honourable man would do. I decided to come to you."</p>

<p>"How much did you say that loan was to be?" Mr. Gascoigne
enquired.</p>

<p>"Ten milles&mdash;a paltry ten milles," the Marquis
groaned.</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne was not a man who loved parting with money, but
there were times when he was prompt in action. He opened his
pocket-book, counted out ten milles, and folded them up.</p>

<p>"Look here, Marquis," he said, "I'll be on the square with
you. Tell me just what Samuel Billingham said about those shares
and you can accept the loan from me instead of from
him&mdash;accept it, too, with nothing on your conscience."</p>

<p>The Marquis finished a cocktail and made signs towards the
bar.</p>

<p>"I will disclose the situation to you," he promised. "It
gives me pain, but it is just retribution. One month ago,
oil&mdash;how you say that?&mdash;gushed&mdash;from eleven
wells on this property. The chairman of the company was there.
He ordered everything concealed. No one was to work, the secret
was to be kept until after Monday. I know why&mdash;Mr.
Billingham told me why. It is because you have the right to buy
most of these shares at a low price."</p>

<p>Joseph Gascoigne leaned back in his chair. He thrust both
hands into his trousers pockets, turned over his keys, and
chuckled. He remained chuckling until the waiter directed his
attention to the cocktails which he was serving.</p>

<p>"Say, this is great!" he declared, as he banished the man
with a twenty-franc note. "I don't mind telling you, Marquis,
that I couldn't get any definite information, but I had a sort
of a feeling there was something doing down there. So old Samuel
was going to do me out of my little deal, eh? Do you know what I
shall do, Marquis?"</p>

<p>The latter shook his head politely.</p>

<p>"I shall go right back to my sitting-room," Mr. Gascoigne
continued, "and send that cable straight away. I shall take the
whole of the ten thousand shares. I'll risk your information
being O.K. I believe in it anyway. Stick that ten milles in your
pocket-book, Marquis, and if this comes off there will be
another ten milles on the top of it, and you can pay me in the
year two thousand."</p>

<p>The Marquis buttoned up the money; his expression was one of
chastened content.</p>

<p>"It will remain for long on my conscience," he confided, "but
I have felt it right to adopt this course. I regret it&mdash;I
regret the disappointment to Mr. Billingham very much. Still, he
should have known better than to have made suggestions to me of
so infamous a nature."</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne sipped his second cocktail&mdash;an indulgence
which he seldom permitted himself&mdash;and the world seemed a
very pleasant place to him. He leaned still further back in his
chair and listened to the music, and he thought of that other
very pleasing little adventure soon to be prosecuted. It was
quite some time before he and the Marquis parted; the Marquis on
his way to the Casino, Mr. Gascoigne to his sitting-room.
Arrived there, he found everything as he had left it, but there
was a little note addressed to him. He tore it open.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Would monsieur kindly come to 15, Avenue de
Mimosas, on Monday&mdash;not before. My aunt is there. She
leaves midday Monday and I shall be alone.</p>

<p class="letter">Thanking monsieur for his generosity and
anticipating, Madelon.</p>

<br>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne's first impulse of disappointment hastily
passed. After all, it was not long to wait. He drew the code
book towards him, ran his finger down the first page, and
selected a phrase.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">HUNGERING.... HAVE DECIDED TO AVAIL
MYSELF OF OPTION IN GREAT DIVIDE SHARES. SECURE THE WHOLE TEN
THOUSAND ON MY ACCOUNT.</p>

<br>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne smiled. He wrote the word "Hungering" upon the
cable form and took it himself to the office.</p>

<p>"What a dinner!" exclaimed Francois, the chief
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> at the restaurant of the
Sporting Club.</p>

<p>"What a prince!" murmured his assistant, glancing at the
hundred-franc note in his hand. There was a great cluster of red
roses in the centre of the table; a magnum of Cliquot in an
ice-pail by its side; an amazing menu on each of the three plates.
Behind the screen an emissary from the bar waited with a
cocktail shaker in his hand, ready to rush out at the
psychological moment. There was caviar in ice, langouste from
the Mediterranean, pheasants which had known no cold storage, a
vol au vent of which the chef had spoken with tears in his eyes.
Nevertheless, the Marquis and Madelon entered the room a little
anxiously. One glance, however, at their host's face and all was
well. Mr. Samuel T. Billingham was very happy, and when he was
happy he showed it.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, no guest so charming has ever graced my
table," he murmured, as he bent over her hand. "If dresses like
this are to be bought ready to wear in Monte Carlo it is indeed
an amazing place. Marquis, success! The time has passed. I have
my cable. To the surprise of many people in New York, Mr. Joseph
Gascoigne cabled his decision not to exercise his option on
those ten thousand shares."</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
"Mademoiselle, no guest so charming has ever graced my
table," he murmured."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"You relieve my mind greatly," the Marquis confessed. "I was
afraid of some slip at the last moment."</p>

<p>They took their places. The details of the repast unfolded
themselves. The Marquis and his niece exchanged ecstatic
glances. Madelon, also, in her way&mdash;like most well-brought-up
young women&mdash;approved of good food and the best
wine.</p>

<p>"It is a feast of celebration, this," Mr. Billingham
declared, scarcely able to take his eyes off his beautiful
guest. "We have achieved a veritable triumph. We have
perpetrated a swindle for which the law cannot touch us. We have
robbed a miserable, mean, miserly old skunk of what I think in
the end may turn out to be the best part of a million dollars.
Let us see how we stand."</p>

<p>The Marquis' fingers shook as he lit a cigarette and sipped
his wine.</p>

<p>"Your <i>douceurs</i>, up to the present," this prince of
adventurers continued, "are insignificant. The few francs I have
advanced we will forget."</p>

<p>"There was my tip as chamber-maid," Madelon murmured. "He
gave me a mille note."</p>

<p>"A stingy business!" was her host's criticism. "We take no
account of that either."</p>

<p>"I did a little better," the Marquis confessed. "I got ten
milles for betraying your secret and informing him of the worth
of his option."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham waved his hand.</p>

<p>"You introduced a note of humour into the situation,
Marquis," he declared. "It was a brainwave, that! That ten
milles, also, we ignore. You are welcome to it. The douceur
which I receive is fifteen thousand dollars. I myself will
retain five thousand, there will be five thousand for you,
Mademoiselle, and five thousand for you, Marquis."</p>

<p>"It is princely!" Madelon gasped.</p>

<p>"It is seventy-five thousand francs," the Marquis
faltered.</p>

<p>"It is some money," Mr. Billingham admitted, "but I tell you
right here that without mademoiselle I might have found great
difficulty in getting hold of the code. Of course, all that I
did was to alter the terms. You, Marquis, kept Mr. Gascoigne
engaged at the Café de Paris whilst I worked hard with my
typewriter. I can say no more than that I consider myself highly
fortunate to have come across two assistants of such
intelligence and," Mr. Billingham concluded, with a sigh, "such
charm."</p>

<p>"You are what we used to call in England 'a great dear,' "
Madelon whispered. "I hope before long you will find something
else for us to do."</p>

<p>"Sure," Mr. Billingham assented fervently. "Five thousand
dollars is a pretty good sum, but it don't carry a man very far
in Monte Carlo, and apart from the money there's the adventure.
I don't look the part, but I guess I was born to be a pirate.
I'm all for taking chances, for looking out for some skunk or
another who's got more of the stuff than is good for him. I
guess something else ought to turn up before very long."</p>

<p>"And meanwhile," the Marquis suggested, watching the
refilling of his glass, "I think that we should drink a toast to
our very dear friend who must now be in great distress of
mind."</p>

<p>"Poor old Joe!" Mr. Billingham murmured, as he raised his
glass.</p>

<p>The first glimmering of uneasiness came to Mr. Joseph
Gascoigne when he demanded a petite venture and asked to be
driven to 15, Avenue de Mimosas. The driver looked blank, and
appealed to the concierge, who shook his head.</p>

<p><i>"Je ne le connais pas,"</i> the driver declared.</p>

<p><i>"Ni moi non plus,"</i> the concierge echoed.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What's the trouble?" Mr. Gascoigne
demanded.</p>

<p>"There is no such street, sir," the concierge announced. "I
have lived in Monte Carlo for many years and I can assure you
that there is no such place as the Avenue de Mimosas."</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne hesitated for a moment, bestowed an inadequate
<i>pourboire</i> upon the coachman, and stepped back into the
hotel. Was it possible that the girl was fooling him&mdash;had
taken his mille and gone off? He ascended to his room and made
cautious enquiries of the valet. Yes, the young woman had left
unexpectedly. She had made no complaint but simply stated that
she could not continue the work. As for her address, she had
given none. The valet was quite sure that there was no such
street as the Avenue de Mimosas in Monte Carlo....</p>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne opened a cable, brought in at that moment, with
eager fingers. As he read it his face grew first bewildered,
then white and evil.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">AM ASTONISHED THAT YOU HAVE DECIDED NOT TO
EXERCISE OPTION BUT HAVE ACTED ACCORDING TO YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.
VENTURE ASSURE YOU THAT YOU HAVE MADE GREAT MISTAKE.</p>

<br>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne almost snatched at his manuscript code book,
and tore open the pages. There it was, without a doubt:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">HUNGERING.... HAVE DECIDED TO AVAIL
MYSELF OF OPTION IN GREAT DIVIDE SHARES. SECURE THE WHOLE TEN
THOUSAND ON MY ACCOUNT.</p>

<br>

<p>He sat down at once and wrote a cable:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN? CABLED
"HUNGERING." WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION, "HAVE DECIDED TO AVAIL
MYSELF OF OPTION IN GREAT DIVIDE SHARES. SECURE THE WHOLE TEN
THOUSAND ON MY ACCOUNT." REPLY.</p>

<br>

<p>It was about twelve o'clock next morning when the reply came.
It was given to him just as he was leaving the Hotel de Paris
for a restless stroll along the Terrace. He tore it open and
read:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">EXACT TRANSLATION "HUNGERING," ATTESTED HERE
BY WHOLE OFFICE. "HAVE DECIDED NOT TO EXERCISE OPTION ON SHARES
IN GREAT DIVIDE. PLEASE INFORMCOMPANY."</p>

<br>

<p>Mr. Gascoigne clutched the cablegram in his fingers. He
looked across the Square with vacant eyes. Such a mistake in
transcription seemed incredible. And then there turned the
corner Mr. Samuel T. Billingham, resplendent in a suit of light
grey, with a carnation in his buttonhole, and a cigar in his
mouth. On one side walked the Marquis, looking very spruce and
smiling, and on the other, very becomingly dressed, and not in
the least like a chamber-maid, was Madelon. Suddenly something
in one of her graceful movements, or perhaps the ripple of her
laughter, was startlingly reminiscent of Mr. Gascoigne's
disappointed hopes. A hideous clear-sightedness seized him. He
remembered the manuscript code book open upon his table, his
absence for the best part of an hour with the Marquis, some
slight surprise at the freshness of the type the next time he
had consulted the code book, and finally Mr. Samuel T.
Billingham's connection with the Great Divide Oil Company and
his reputation. They passed him; Mr. Billingham with a little
wave of the hand and a solemn wink, Madelon with a frank laugh
into his face, and the Marquis with a patronising nod.</p>

<p>He looked after them and he shook his fist. He was cold with
fury, but with a mighty effort at selfrestraint he remained
silent.</p>

<p>For, although it was very certain he had been robbed, there
was really nothing he could do!</p>

<p class="first">WHEN the mists roll down from La Turbie and the
grey clouds hug the sides of the mountains, Monte Carlo is very
far from being itself. The red-coated members of the orchestra
at the Café de Paris move inside the building, the
waiters stand like wraiths amidst a deserted wilderness of
tables. Even a winner leaving the Casino&mdash;most easily
recognisable of all human beings&mdash;forbears to whistle as
he descends the steps. But when the sun shines down from a
cloudless sky of perfect blue, and the women have trooped out
like butterflies to drink aperitifs under the umbrella-sheltered
tables, and the orchestra is playing an Italian love song, and
there is a lively murmur of conversation, and the chink of ice
against the glass, all is well with life, and Monte Carlo is a
very different place.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel T. Billingham, with Madelon de Felan for his
companion and a pleasantly clouded wineglass on the table by his
side, submitted cheerfully to the relaxing influence of his
surroundings. He even viewed the approach of the Marquis,
Madeira's uncle, with toleration, if not without some
apprehension.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I like that fixed smile on your uncle's
face," he remarked.</p>

<p>She watched her troublesome relation critically, and
sighed.</p>

<p>"Jaunty, too," she murmured&mdash;"always a bad sign."</p>

<p>The Marquis came up with a wave of his hat. Mr. Billingham
made signs to a waiter.</p>

<p>"Just one cocktail, perhaps," the newcomer conceded,
"although it is a little early for me.... I foolishly came out
this morning with almost empty pockets. Have you such a thing as
a mille, MadeIon?"</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"Am I the sort of girl," she asked, "who goes about with
milles in her pocket? I have no money at all with me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Billingham," the Marquis proposed
tentatively.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham considered the matter.</p>

<p>"How much have you lost this morning?" he enquired.</p>

<p>The Marquis coughed.</p>

<p>"Very little," he declared, straightening his tie. "I brought
very little with me. My numbers are turning up, though. I have
fixed upon a table where my luck seems to have definitely
established itself."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham withdrew a five-hundred-franc note from his
pocket-book and handed it to the Marquis, who departed hastily,
after gulping down his refreshment.</p>

<p>"Seems to me that game's got quite a hold upon your uncle,"
his benefactor observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It is the one curse of the place for us," MadeIon assented,
with a sigh. "It keeps us always poor. If he cannot go to the
Casino he is miserable&mdash;like a child in trouble or
disgrace. If he goes, he loses. It is always the same. If we had
not met you a month ago I cannot imagine what would have become
of us."</p>

<p>It was not often that Mr. Billingham's attention wandered
when Madelon was speaking, but at this moment he certainly had a
lapse. His eyes were fixed upon an approaching figure&mdash;a
man, tall and thin, with a long, hatchet-shaped face, a terrible
mouth, and deep-set eyes. He was dressed with unusual
sombreness, in clothes of a transatlantic cut, surmounted by a
black Homburg, and he walked towards the outskirts of the
scattered company, looking neither to the right nor to the left.
Mr. Billingham half-rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Ned!" he exclaimed in welcoming fashion.</p>

<p>The behaviour of this presumed acquaintance of his was, to
say the least of it, singular. He scarcely even glanced at Mr.
Billingham, whose hand was already outstretched, and passed on,
ignoring his greeting. His right hand was in his jacket pocket,
and Mr. Billingham, who had formed the habit of quick
observation, saw something menacing in the fact.</p>

<p>"Who is your friend who doesn't know you?" Madelon
enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, recovered from his first surprise, was deeply
interested.</p>

<p>"That's Ned Gunby, the biggest man they've got in the New
York police," he confided. "I've never known him abroad before.
I'd like some to know who he's after!"</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to be that person," Madelon confessed,
with a little shiver. "I think he is an awful man."</p>

<p>"Ned hands out the goods all right," Mr. Billingham affirmed.
"They say that from the start he has arrested more dangerous
criminals than any man in the police force."</p>

<p>"He seems to be very much in earnest about something just
now," Madelon observed. They both watched his progress with
riveted attention, whilst he threaded his way through the maze
of tables. At the furthest table, close to a shed in which was
displayed an automobile for which lottery tickets were being
sold, a man was seated alone, leaning back in his chair and with
his face half concealed by a newspaper which he was reading. He
showed no signs of being aware of the detective's approach, and
even Mr. Billingham failed to catch that surreptitious movement
of the paper and stealthy glance. What followed was a matter of
seconds. The detective, with his hand half-withdrawn from his
jacket pocket, had reached his destination.</p>

<p>"Jim Robin," he said, in a harsh, unpleasant voice, "throw
'em up! Quick as hell! I want you I" The answer was a tiny flash
of fire, a sharp report and an empty seat. Ned Gunby, for once
in his life late in the draw, spun round like a teetotum and
collapsed against the table.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>For a single second conversation all around was entirely
suspended. There was a tense stillness, with only the music as a
background. Then there was a rush from all quarters. A gendarme
from across the road was actually betrayed into running. A few
women screamed. Every one asked breathlessly what had happened.
Mr. Billingham shook his head as he leaned over the body of his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"He's sure got his," he decided....</p>

<p>The authorities at Monte Carlo are adepts at wiping from the
face of the earth all traces of tragical events. In a few
moments ijhe body of the wounded man was whisked away in a
closed motorcar. A functionary in plain clothes, who seemed to
have arrived by magic, patiently interviewed the few spectators,
with indifferent results. No one appeared to have seen the
fugitive distinctly. He had, without a doubt, escaped by passing
behind the shed where the car was exhibited and mingling with
the crowd of people entering the Casino, but, although several
had seen him disappear, there was not a single credible item of
information as to his later movements. The hand of justice was
temporarily, at any rate, baulked.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, Mr. Billingham, in response to an urgent
message, was driven to the little whitewashed hospital on the
slopes of the hill and listened to the last words of a dying
man. The bullet had found its way into the detective's lungs and
speech was difficult. Nevertheless, he said what he had to
say.</p>

<p>"Reckon I'm too old for the job, Mr. Billingham," he
confessed, "but I'll hand it to him that it was the quickest
draw I ever saw."</p>

<p>"It was that, Ned," was his visitor's sympathetic assent.
"You don't want to talk too much. Tell me who he was, what you
wanted him for, and what I can do for you."</p>

<p>"That was James Robin, who murdered Hammon, the banker, last
year&mdash;got him fixed on that Bundell poisoning case, too,"
the detective announced. "I've got all the papers on the table
there&mdash;the extradition warrant, and there's this," the
suffering man added, lifting his badge from under his pillow and
passing it across. "You've puzzled me more than once,
Billingham, but if you're a crook you're a straight one. Take
this on for me. James Robin ain't got no right to live. He's a
white-livered skunk. Gave his own pals away in although several
had seen him disappear, there was not a single credible item of
information as to his later movements. The hand of justice was
temporarily, at any rate, baulked.</p>

white-livered skunk. Gave his own pals away in the Bennett case,
or he'd have been sent to the penitentiary then."</p>

<p>"I guess that's so," the other acquiesced. "I remember the
whole affair. Anything you knowlikely to help about his
movements here?"</p>

<p>"He's been going by the name of Braund&mdash;James Braund,"
the detective confided. "There's a woman with him&mdash;picked
her up on this side, I reckon. They had rooms at the Boston
Hotel, up at the back. The police here are watching it, but I've
told them you're in the force and will take over. Shake hands,
Billingham. Glad to have an American round, anyway."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands solemnly, and the nurse, who saw the
things which Ned Gunby felt, hurried up. Mr. Billingham stepped
back into the world of sunshine and flowers and music, with a
mist before his eyes. Death in such surroundings was so
unrealisable. There was suddenly a chill in the air and a note
of discord in the music, which seemed to have become blatant.
Mr. Billingham entered upon his task with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>With Madelon's help as interpreter, Mr. Billingham had
several long conversations with the local functionaries, and was
enabled to make certain arrangements towards the prosecution of
his mission. He spent that night seated in an easychair in the
bedroom which had been allotted at the Boston Hotel to Monsieur
and Madame Braund, and which had remained unoccupied since the
time of the tragedy. At three o'clock, however, there was the
sound of feminine footsteps outside and the turning of a key in
the door. Mr. Billingham switched on the lights, and the woman
who had entered screamed.</p>

<p>"Don't disturb yourself, madame," he begged. "I've taken over
Ned Gunby's job. Where's your husband?"</p>

<p>The woman, after a moment's hesitation, slipped off her
cloak, seated herself in an easy-chair, and lit a cigarette. She
was a person of somewhat flamboyant type, with hair of an almost
startling shade of red, and eyes unnaturally darkened.</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham disclosed his badge.</p>

<p>"I'm out to get Braund," he declared, "and I'm going to have
him."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, crossed her legs, and leaned a
little further back, with her hands clasped behind her head.</p>

<p>"Seems to me you're looking for trouble," she remarked. "What
do you know about Braund?"</p>

<p>"Your husband," Mr. Billingham observed.</p>

<p>She laughed shrilly.</p>

<p>"Not much," she scoffed. "If you want to know the truth, I
picked him up at the Carlton three weeks ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was silent for several moments. He took out
his cigar-case.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll smoke, too," he observed. "Anything to drink up
here?"</p>

<p>The woman went to a chiffonier and produced a bottle of
brandy, a bottle of whisky and some soda water. She helped
herself liberally to brandy, and Mr. Billingham mixed himself a
whisky and soda.</p>

<p>"So you ain't his wife?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord I'm not," she answered. "I shouldn't care to
be, in this mix-up. I've come here to get my things, and I'm
going to move into a little flat round the corner."</p>

<p>"Where is Braund?" Mr. Billingham asked abruptly.</p>

<p>The woman laughed.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" she retorted. "And if I did know, can
you see me telling you?"</p>

<p>"You might avoid a heap of trouble that way," was the
suggestive rejoinder.</p>

<p>The lady smiled.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said, "I'm no chicken, Mr.
Billingham&mdash;or whatever your name is. There's nothing wrong
with me, except that I took up with a man who turned out to be a
criminal. That don't make me one. There's nothing coming to me
from you or anyone else."</p>

<p>"What sort of a chap is he, this Braund?" Mr. Billingham
enquired.</p>

<p>The woman hesitated for a moment. Her tone was a little more
serious.</p>

<p>"A devil!" she answered. "Hard as they make 'em!"</p>

<p>"Treat you well?"</p>

<p>"No better than he ought to," was the somewhat indifferent
reply. "I shouldn't call him a spender."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham sipped his whisky and soda.</p>

<p>"I want Braund," he confided. "I want him badly."</p>

<p>"How's the detective he shot?" the woman demanded.</p>

<p>"Dead," Mr. Billingham told her solemnly. The woman was a
little shocked.</p>

<p>"I suppose it had to be one of them," she mused. "They tell
me that if my friend had been arrested it would have been the
chair for him."</p>

<p>"It certainly would have been, and it will be," Mr.
Billingham assented.</p>

<p>"You think you'll get him, then?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I do," was the confident reply, "and you're going to help
me."</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>"Seem to have got me sized up," she remarked. "Do you think
that I'd give him away if I knew where he was?"</p>

<p>"You're not a fool," her companion argued. "You're a woman of
the world. Braund's no more use to you. You're through with him
all right. Sooner or later we shall get him. Why not have your
bit out of it?"</p>

<p>The woman shivered. It seemed as though Mr. Billingham was
being wilfully callous.</p>

<p>"You must think I'm as cold-blooded as Ned Gunby himself,"
she muttered, throwing away her cigarette.</p>

<p>"I sized you up as having some sense," Mr. Billingham
answered slowly. "This man ain't been anything special to you,
and you can take it from me he's a real out and out, downright
bad 'un. He'd throw you or any other woman on the dirtheap if it
helped him any. He's not going to worry any more about you. All
he's thinking of is his own skin. As for you, the thing's come
your way. You haven't been out to look for it. Why not put a
matter of five thousand dollars in your pocket?"</p>

<p>The woman sat for a moment transfixed. Mr. Billingham,
watching her closely, found it difficult to follow her train of
thought. Presently she sat up a little in her chair, helped
herself to another cigarette, and drank her brandy slowly and
deliberately.</p>

<p>"I've never done any one a dirty trick like that," she
said.</p>

<p>There was a gleam in Mr. Billingham's eyes. She knew,
then!</p>

<p>"It isn't a very dirty trick," he protested. "James Braund in
Monte Carlo is like a rat in a pit. He can't get out. We shall
have him all right, but the sooner the better. There's ten
thousand dollars reward for him. I'm offering you half."</p>

<p>"Cash?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Cash," he assented, tapping his pocket-book.</p>

<p>She had the air of a woman tortured by ugly thoughts.
Presently she helped herself to more brandy.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what you say," she declared. "It's a dirty
piece of work."</p>

<p>"Life here," Mr. Billingham reminded her, "is expensive for a
woman like you who needs jewellery and swell clothes and that
sort of outfit. Bit anxious sometimes, eh? Why not make yourself
sure for a time? Five thousand dollars at to-day's exchange is a
lot of money."</p>

<p>She sat for a moment looking at her over-manicured
fingers.</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do?" she enquired, in a voice to
which she seemed afraid to listen. "You know where Braund is,"
Mr. Billingham said. "Help me to put the irons on him."</p>

<p>"You are sure he'll go to the chair?" she asked, with a queer
little quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>"He'll go there anyway," was the confident reply. "The only
question is whether you make five thousand dollars out of it or
whether you don't."</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars!" she repeated slowly. She seemed to
be thinking about the sum. Presently she picked up a piece of
paper, and, with a gold pencil which hung from her reticule, she
worked out the amount in francs. There was a covetous gleam in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll do it," she decided.</p>

<p>"Of course you will," Mr. Billingham observed, in a tone
which was almost matter of fact. "You'd be stark, raving mad if
you hesitated.... Go on!"</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I've heard of you," she reflected. "Samuel Billingham, isn't
it? You've been mixed up in some queer cases, but no one seems
to know whether you're on the straight or the other side of the
fence. How's your nerve?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled.</p>

<p>"I guess that's all right," he assured her. "Got your gun
handy?"</p>

<p>He tapped his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>"Would you like to take him right now," she asked&mdash;"in a
quarter of an hour's time, that is?"</p>

<p>"Suit me O.K.," Mr. Billingham acquiesced. "I've handcuffs in
my pocket and a car on the other side of the Square."</p>

<p>The woman rose to her feet. She seemed in some subtle sort of
way to have changed, to have lost her airy&mdash;almost
brazen&mdash;ease of manner, to be anticipating already grave
things. Mr. Billingham watched her and it seemed to him that she
was still hesitating.</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars," he said reflectively, "at to-day's
rate of exchange, is seventy-five thousand francs."</p>

<p>She sighed like one who faces the inevitable. Then she
glanced at the watch on her wrist.</p>

<p>"Braund," she confided, her voice lower and thicker, her eyes
fixed upon the ground, "has papers or money&mdash;perhaps a
large sum of money&mdash;in this room, which he would not trust
me to fetch. I came on to see whether the coast was clear. If I
lift that blind at four o'clock and turn on the electric light,
he will ascend."</p>

<p>"They will be waiting for him below," Mr. Billingham reminded
her.</p>

<p>"The front door is locked," she told him, "and we all have
latch-keys. The concierge is not on duty. I have seen to
that&mdash;I and a hundred francs. At four o'clock he will enter
if I turn the lights on and lift the blind, but when you hear
his step on the stair, be ready."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"What about you?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>"He is watching now," she replied. "I dare not try to get
away. I shall hide in the corner there, behind the wardrobe.
Remember that if you make a mess of this," she went on
anxiously, "it will be my life as well as yours. You know what
sort of man James Braund is. You know how he treated Ned Gunby.
You get no more mercy from him than from a stone."</p>

"You know what sort of man James Braund is.<br>
You get no more mercy from him than from a stone."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Nor he from me," Mr. Billingham assured her grimly.</p>

<p>They compared watches. It was ten minutes to four. The woman
helped herself feverishly to more brandy. Mr. Billingham
followed suit with another whisky and soda. Then he took out his
gun and looked at it, laid a pair of handcuffs on the table, and
lit another cigar. The woman watched him and apparently she was
satisfied. The fingers which held his match did not once quiver,
his face seemed somehow to have hardened and tightened. He had
all the air of a man who expects to confront a crisis and is
prepared for it. Of the two, the woman was by far the more
nervous. Nevertheless, when four o'clock came she turned on the
other switches of electric light, touched the spring of the
blind and threw open the shutters.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" she muttered&mdash;"to both of us!" The seconds
passed, perhaps a minute&mdash;then the step upon the stair. The
woman crept into her hiding-place. She had dabbed her face
plentifully with powder, but little drops of perspiration had
broken through on to her forehead, her lips were vivid streaks
of scarlet, in her eyes was fear. Mr. Billingham stood with his
left hand upon the bedpost, and in his right hand was his gun.
The footstep was nearer now. The door was suddenly pushed open
and Mr. Billingham's voice rang out, crisp and terse.</p>

<p>"Hands up&mdash;right up above your head! Up, I say!"</p>

<p>For a single second the man who stood upon the threshold
seemed as though his right hand would dive downward. Then he
looked into that tiny black space, saw the lights flash upon the
plating of the revolver, and saw behind, Billingham's face. His
hands went up.</p>

<p>"Who the hell are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Billingham of New York, and I've taken on Ned Gunby's job,"
was the quick reply.</p>

<p>The man with his hands upraised was still a formidable-looking
person. He was of little more than medium height, but
strongly built, dark, with crisp, black hair, olive complexion
and eyes with violet rims underneath, which spoke of sleepless
nights. There was about him, somehow or other, an air of
fastidiousness, although his linen was crumpled and his boots
ill-brushed. All the time it seemed as though his brain were
working&mdash;his eyes searching the room.</p>

<p>"Where's Anna?" he enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham ignored the question. With his left hand he
picked up the handcuffs and came a step nearer.</p>

<p>"Lower your hands slowly," he enjoined, "until they point
towards me. Keep your wrists together!"</p>

<p>The man obeyed. He was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>"Stop there," Mr. Billingham ordered.</p>

<p>He stopped, but his eyes semed filled with a tortured light.
He seemed to be wondering, speculating. Suddenly, with a
movement incredibly swift, he was in Mr. Billingham's grasp,
Billingham's left arm underneath his hands to keep them from
that downward dive. A moment later there was a click, and the
handcuffs were on. Mr. Billingham coolly produced the gun from
the man's hip-pocket and thrust it into his own.</p>

<p>"That seems all right," he said. "What did you come back here
to look for, Braund?"</p>

<p>"Find out," was the contemptuous reply. There was a sob from
behind the chiffonier. The man turned his head slowly. The woman
crept into sight. Braund only nodded quietly.</p>

<p>"Like all the rest," he muttered. "You couldn't be trusted.
Do you know, woman, that it is my life you've given
away&mdash;my life for a few dirty dollars."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she gasped. "You shouldn't have killed him,
James. They'd have got you, anyhow."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, with the situation arranged to his liking,
felt completely at his ease. He took out his pocket-book and,
from a wonderful pile of bills, counted out seventy-five mille
notes. Notwithstanding the tenseness of the moment, the woman
could not keep the covetous gleam from her eyes.</p>

<p>"I guess those are yours," Mr. Billingham said. "You needn't
worry that you've done anything dirty, either. He was my man
from the start. Come along, James Braund. We'll put you
somewhere until we can arrange to get you across the pond."</p>

<p>The woman fingered the bills and watched them depart, Mr.
Billingham holding his captor by the arm. As they passed through
the door, she called out.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Jim," she cried. "I'm sorry I did it."</p>

<p>"You can go to hell!" was the bitter rejoinder....</p>

<p>The two men walked down the narrow stairs and across the
darkened hall, Mr. Billingham with his revolver in his hand, and
every sense alert. They reached the street, however, in safety,
reached the automobile, and drove to the sternlooking police-office
down in Monaco, where a little crowd of functionaries was
awaiting them. Mr. Billingham remained until the iron door of a
very formidable-looking cell was locked upon his captive. Then
he drew a sigh of relief, mingled with some other less
comprehensible emotion.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he exclaimed. "Some evening!" The
trio&mdash;Madelon, her uncle, the Marquis, and Mr.
Billingham&mdash;were seated at their favourite table in front
of the Café de Paris. An unusual silence had reigned for
some minutes, which was broken at last by Madelon.</p>

<p>"I am dissatisfied with life," she sighed, sipping her
Dubonnet.</p>

<p>Her uncle glanced at her reprovingly.</p>

<p>"My dear Madelon!" he protested. "Surely that is ungrateful
to our kind friend who has provided so generously for our
entertainment."</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"I have a complaint against him," she declared. "He provides
me with no one to flirt with and he ignores me himself. He has
become a hero and he is all the time distrait. I think that his
head is turned."</p>

<p>"Why should I provide you with any one to flirt with?" Mr.
Billingham objected. "I guess that's my privilege."</p>

<p>"It might have been," Madelon admitted, "if you had been
persistent, if you had shown rather more desire to be in my
company, to whisper things in my ear, to look as though my
presence made the difference to you of happiness or misery. But
behold, for five minutes this morning after my arrival, you sat
and you looked towards the Casino and you said nothing. You
might even have held my fingers&mdash;I purposely let them stay
in your hand. And there are other things." Mr. Billingham
groaned.</p>

<p>"Go on with it, then," he begged. "Let me know the full
extent of my misdeeds."</p>

<p>"Your passion for me," she complained, "has given way to
another. You are as bad as my uncle. You Spend your time in the
Casino. You have become a gambler. When you might be taking me
for a little drive to the hills&mdash;I love motoring so much
that there is no telling how gracious I might be&mdash;you stay
in that terrible Casino, gambling&mdash;not even like a man who
seeks the great things, one who deals in maximums in the Cercle
Prive or at the Sporting Club, but playing for louis in the
'kitchen.' Bah! It is incredible! Why do you do it? I demand an
explanation!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's attention had wandered away. His eyes were
fixed upon the little crowd entering the Casino. For once in his
life he was almost indifferent to his charming companion.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go and play a coup or two before luncheon," he
announced, rising to his feet. "Don't wait for me if I'm late.
Henry will see that you are well served."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet. Madelon made one last attempt to
understand.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," she demanded, "that you have embarked upon
another adventure without our aid?"</p>

<p>"If I do not return for luncheon," was the evasive reply, "I
will tell you everything at dinnertime."</p>

<p>He crossed the Place&mdash;a trifle burly in appearance, but
walking with the spring of a young man; erect, self-confident. A
commissionaire saluted him, the cloak-room attendant recognised
him as a generous donor of pourboires, the ushers at the door
bowed at his coming. He staked a coup or two at the table on the
right. Then he turned to the table on the left. Every place was
occupied and there was a row of people standing looking on. Mr.
Billingham took his place amongst them. This time he staked
nothing, however. He stood behind the chair of a slim, elderly
man, who wore dark tortoise shell spectacles and who had just
taken a vacant place. By his side sat Anna, the woman who had
betrayed her lover.</p>

<p><i>"Faites vos jeux, messieurs,"</i> the croupier
invited.</p>

<p>The man in front of Mr. Billingham threw four louis on the
table.</p>

<p><i>"Sept, quatorze, vingt-huit&mdash;vingt-neuf, vingtneuf en
plein,"</i> he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham glanced meaningly towards a tall, dark man who
had moved stealthily to his side. A quick nod was exchanged.
Then a singular thing happened. Mr. Billingham, whose arms were
almost as powerful as the arms of a prize-fighter, suddenly
gripped both wrists of the man seated in front of him and held
them together as though in a vise. The tall, dark man leaned
over and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"In the name of the police, Monsieur," he whispered.</p>

<p>The woman looked round, recognised Mr. Billingham and
shrieked. The man turned towards her. His teeth were suddenly
parted. He seemed about to rise, making no movement of
resistance.</p>

<p>The woman thrust her hand into her handbag, her fingers
towards his mouth. His teeth closed with a snap. Then he rose
calmly to his feet.</p>

<p>"If you have a car or anything," he said, "you had better get
me into it. A person of brains, Mr. Billingham. I congratulate
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's grip upon the man's wrists was never for a
moment relaxed. Play had ceased and people were crowding up only
to be kept away by two plain-clothes gendarmes who had suddenly
made their appearance, and a small army of the Casino
functionaries.</p>

<p>"The gentleman is taken ill," some one announced. "Make way,
please."</p>

<p>The handcuffs clicked upon the man's wrists but he only
shrugged his shoulders. He commenced his passage towards the
door with Mr. Billingham on one side and the man who had
arrested him on the other. His steps, however, became uncertain.
He turned and looked back at the woman. She was standing, a
terrible figure of misery, a few yards off. He forced a little
smile into his face.</p>

<p class="caption">The handcuffs clicked upon the man's

</div>

<br>

<p>"Don't take her money away, Billingham, even if she fooled
you," he begged. "You've come out on top, you see."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you?" his captor demanded
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Cyanide of potassium," was the grim reply. "Anna had it
ready for me in case we didn't make a get-away. You'll have to
carry me down the steps. What about it, Billingham? If she
fooled you, it was life or death for me."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Mr. Billingham promised. "I've nothing
against her. I guess she can keep what she's got."</p>

<p>Madelon and her uncle had finished their <i>hors
d'oeuvres</i> and commenced the grilled chicken when Mr.
Billingham joined them. He took the vacant place opposite
Madelon and signified his pressing need of some alcoholic
refreshment. He was looking very grave and he had lost a good
deal of his healthy colour.</p>

<p>"Something has happened!" Madelon exclaimed.</p>

<p>"We have just arrested Braund," Mr. Billingham confided.
"Touch and go it was, too. They were off this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Arrested Braund?" Madelon repeated incredulously. "Why, you
arrested him ten days ago! The papers said they were taking him
back to America to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was slowly recovering himself. He was still,
however, very grave.</p>

<p>"I haven't let you two in on this," he explained, "because
there was nothing you could do. I had to play, as it were, a
lone hand. When I promised Ned Gunby I'd see this thing through,
he gave me a little pile of papers about Braund and a note of a
few of his weaknesses. He didn't tell me much about the woman,
though, and I honestly believed that she was on the straight
when she offered to sell me Braund for half the reward."</p>

<p>"But the man you arrested at the Boston Hotel"</p>

<p>"Braund's brother-in-law," Mr. Billingham
interrupted&mdash;"the decoy whilst Braund made a getaway. He
didn't run any particular risk. There were dozens to identify
him the moment he was hauled up in New York. I thought it was
all right until I had the handcuffs on him. Then I saw that he
wasn't anything like the description of the man I wanted, and
besides he put up no sort of a fight. I pretended to be fooled
all right, and we've kept him in prison. In the meantime we've
watched Madame. She's been damned artful, pretended to be
playing the restaurant game at the Carlton and those places, but
she was continually disappearing. Then I got her dossier. She
was Braund's wife right enough, but wherever he was hiding in
Monte Carlo she never went near him. I noticed, though, that she
spent a lot of time at the Casino, and amongst Gunby's papers
was a little note that the passion of Braund's life was
roulette, and that if anything could bring him out of his hiding
it would be to gamble. He played on four numbers
only&mdash;seven, fourteen, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine. I
sort of hung around and waited for some one sitting near Madame
who backed on those numbers. We very nearly brought it off
yesterday morning, but this morning it was a cert. They entered
almost at the same time, went to the same table, sat side by
side. I gave 'em the office outside and pretty
soon&mdash;well&mdash;seven, fourteen, twenty-eight and
twenty-nine. I got him by the wrists so that he couldn't move whilst
they took his gun away&mdash;got him from behind."</p>

<p>The Marquis looked longingly towards the Casino.</p>

<p>"And we missed it!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have let you be there," Mr. Billingham assured
him. "There's no knowing how those things are going to turn out
till they're over. After all, in a way he tricked us."</p>

<p>"How?" Madelon asked.</p>

<p>"The woman again! A common-looking bit of goods but Braund
was her man and she saw him through it. The moment they realised
that he was done she handed him the poison&mdash;put it into his
mouth herself, in fact. It was all over before they got him into
the auto."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" Madelon exclaimed with a little shudder.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham ordered his lunch.</p>

<p>"Horrible it is," he admitted, as he laid down the menu, "but
there is just one thing that makes me glad of my morning's
work."</p>

<p>"One thing?" the Marquis murmured politely. Mr. Billingham
inclined his head towards the hill.</p>

<p>"That little hospital," he confided. "Poor Ned Gunby with a
bullet in his chest, shot on sight for doing his duty. I guess
Braund has got what was coming to him."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the shadow remained&mdash;the shadow of tragedy,
which never leaves the atmosphere of sudden death. Mr.
Billingham called for the winelist and revised his order.</p>

<p>"I should like our next adventure," Madelon confided, a few
moments later, "to end in a laugh instead of a tragedy."</p>

<p>Something of the grimness passed from Mr. Billingham's face.
He watched the pouring out of the wine.</p>

<p>"I guess I have an idea of that sort myself," he agreed.
"Supposing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">"THAT horrible woman!" Madelon exclaimed,
gripping Mr. Billingham's arm, as they sat in a retired corner
of the Sporting Club bar."</p>

<p>"She is indeed deplorable," the Marquis agreed, from the
other side. "To-day, at one of the tables in the Casino, before
the opening of the Cercle Prive, she created a scene. She
plastered the board with plaques. She utterly failed to
remember. She claimed everything. Her voice&mdash;a horrible
memory! The croupiers had no choice. They gave in. She took what
she wished. When she departed every one was overjoyed."</p>

<p>"She carries some of the stuff about her," Mr. Billingham
observed judicially. "Fine woman in her day!"</p>

<p>The woman to whom they referred, Mrs. William Block, of
Leeds, England, stood looking around for a seat, and, finding
none, scowled. She was florid, fat, notwithstanding the
desperate efforts of a world-famed costumier, and vulgar. She
swung in her hand a gold bag, adorned with precious stones. She
wore upon her person two pearl necklaces, a pair of large
diamond ear-rings, a succession of diamond bracelets, and
several glittering hat-pins. Her costume was white and bulgy.
She was a well-known habitante of the Hotel de Paris, whose
friends were sycophants and whose acquaintances fugitive, and
she was reputed to be the widow of a leather merchant who had
made a million pounds in hides.</p>

<p>"She is one of the people," Madelon confided, "who upset all
my ideas of conventional morality. I should like to rob
her."</p>

<p>The Marquis dropped his eyeglass and twirled the corner of
his moustache.</p>

<p>"It is an idea," he admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham considered the matter.</p>

<p>"If one could hatch out a deal," he confessed, "I guess this
is a case where one wouldn't need to be too darned particular.
That woman don't deserve to be allowed to go about alive,
looking the way she does, and with half a million dollars' worth
of jewels missing their opportunity in life."</p>

<p>Madelon smiled up at him in intriguing fashion.</p>

<p>"Do something about it, Mr. Billingham," she begged. "You are
already in favour with her. Do you not remember giving her your
seat yesterday evening?"</p>

<p>"Say, that don't count for much," Mr. Billingham protested.
"She was leaning over me with a kind of blend of lily of the
valley and patchouli scent, pretty well stifling me, brushing my
hair the wrong way, pushing her plaques on and shouting out her
stakes till I was glad enough to make myself scarce."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Madelon reminded him in a whisper, "you gave
her your place, and she is smiling at you now."</p>

<p>It was an incontrovertible fact. Madelon rose to her feet
with a sudden graceful movement.</p>

<p>"I have an idea that there is a place for me at my favourite
table," she confided. "I go to see."</p>

<p>Mrs. William Block advanced a few steps and beamed at Mr.
Billingham. He rose at once.</p>

<p>"<i>Vous desirez une chaise, madame?</i>" he demanded.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">"Vous desirez une chaise, madame?"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"I'll sit down all right," the lady replied, dropping heavily
into the chair, "but I ain't French. Waiter, I'll have a gin
fizz."</p>

<p>"An excellent drink!" Mr. Billingham murmured.</p>

<p>"I like a glass of champagne most times," the lady confided,
"but I'll have to drink so much for dinner that perhaps I'd
better lay off for a while. I'm dining with the
Higginsons&mdash;Jim Higginson and his wife. You know them, I
dare say."</p>

<p>The Marquis felt himself included in the query.</p>

<p>"I have not the honour," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I know them," Mr. Billingham confessed.</p>

<p>"Jim's father made his money in woollens at Huddersfield,"
the lady explained, "and Jim got into that cotton scheme
somehow.... Why," she went on, smiling at Mr. Billingham,
"you must be the gentleman who gave me his seat yesterday
evening."</p>

<p>"I had that pleasure," Mr. Billingham admitted.</p>

<p>The Marquis rose stealthily to his feet. He was fond of his
friend, he was very fond of his niece, but like all real
aristocrats he was in his way a snob. He did not care to sit
next Mrs. William Block.</p>

<p>"I wait for you," he explained, with a wave of his hand. "I
have an affair."...</p>

<p>"Jumpy little person, your friend," Mrs. Block remarked.
"Never mind! All the more room for us. Where are you staying,
Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;what is your name?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham produced a card.</p>

<p>"My name is Billingham, ma'am," he said&mdash;"Samuel T.
Billingham of New York. I was interested in linoleums but I've
sold out."</p>

<p>"Retired, eh?" the lady remarked.</p>

<p>"That's how you put it over here," Mr. Billingham conceded
cautiously. "I'm not saying that I'm right out of the game
yet."</p>

<p>"My name's Block," the lady confided&mdash;"Annie Block. My
husband was in hides. Nasty dirty things, I always thought, but
he made a cool million at it."</p>

<p>"Pounds?" Mr. Billingham enquired, in an awed tone.</p>

<p>"Pounds sterling," was the definite reply. "None of your
silly dollars!"</p>

<p>"I trust," Mr. Billingham continued, "that your husband
remembered to whose inspiration his success was due?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're getting at," Mrs. Block observed,
"but if you want to know what he did with his money, I'll tell
you straight, he left it to me. It will cost you one bob at
Somerset House to find out that I ain't a liar, and if you
happen to know a word or two of French, just rub it into that
flunkey there that a lady doesn't want to wait for a gin fizz
half the evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham proved equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>The gin fizz was produced, and the lady, notwithstanding her
colossal inheritance, showed not the slightest objection to her
companion paying for it. They conversed for a time with growing
intimacy.</p>

<p>"Are you married?" she asked, a little abruptly.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham scorned the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Put it off till too late, I guess&mdash;a great
mistake!"</p>

<p>She sighed, and scrutinised him benignly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'too late'?" she demanded. "You're in
the prime of life."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>"I am healthy," he admitted. "I'm only just round the corner
of fifty, but I guess I'm still a little particular. The women I
care for seem to want something younger."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" the lady asserted.</p>

<p>"Take your own case now," he went on earnestly. "You are a
widow, I understand. You are bound to marry again&mdash;any one
can see that. You wouldn't care to have anything to do with a
man of my age."</p>

<p>Mrs. William Block laid four chubby fingers and a fat thumb
upon his arm. So far as her double chin would allow her, she
looked arch.</p>

<p>"You are a funny person!" she declared. "Come on&mdash;I dare
you! Ask me, now. I might be tempted."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham bore the assault stoically.</p>

<p>"If I did make such an idiot of myself," he observed, "I know
very well what would happen, and so do you."</p>

<p>"I'd have you," she assured him.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham contemplated that wonderful array of jewellery
with which she was decked, remembered his pledge to Madelon,
heaved a deep sigh, and permitted himself to touch the massive
arm which leaned against his.</p>

<p>"What are you doing for luncheon to-morrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That depends upon what you want me to do," was the brilliant
reply.</p>

<p>At the end of a week Mr. Billingham had lost half a stone. He
escaped one morning from the Hotel de Paris at an early hour and
met his friends, the Marquis de Felan and Madelon, his niece, at
one of the smaller cafés at the back of the town.</p>

<p>"Some one else," he complained, "will have to take a hand in
this game."</p>

<p>The Marquis stroked his moustache.</p>

<p>"My turn, I gather," he observed, "is to come later."</p>

<p>"What can I do, dear man?" Madelon asked, patting his hand.
"I am here. I am anxious to help. I must confess that at first I
watched your sufferings with heartfelt sympathy. Lately I am not
so sure. You are either getting callous, or you are becoming an
admirer of the Gargantuan in my sex."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham groaned.</p>

<p>"Listen," he announced; "we approach the end. I am veritably
the accepted suitor of Mrs. Annie Block, widow of a defunct
dealer in hides. The million is in her own name."</p>

<p>"It is incredible!" the Marquis declared.</p>

<p>"A million? It is worth the trouble?" Madelon murmured
inscrutably.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled for the first time for days; a smile
that spread and extended to the wrinkles around his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "I guess I'm about through with my
part. It is your uncle who takes the floor now."</p>

<p>The Marquis coughed.</p>

<p>"But supposing the lady should object to this
&mdash;er&mdash;substitution of attentions?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's smile broadened.</p>

<p>"I should worry," he murmured. "Play your part as I have
played mine, Marquis&mdash;and there must be no shirking,
mind&mdash;and the thing is accomplished. This morning we meet
at the Café de Paris and I shall present you. Then I talk
to Madelon. The rest&mdash;well&mdash;some cinch, I can tell
you!"</p>

<p>The Marquis was a little uneasy. He was haunted with visions
of a magenta dress which the lady had worn on the previous
evening.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he ventured, "whether my methods may
appeal."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham struck the little table with his fist.</p>

<p>"See here," he announced, "it's a closed pocketbook on this
trip if you show the white feather. The game's as easy as pie.
You've got to sail right in. I come along with the finesse
later. Madelon!" She nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"Uncle," she warned him, "remember that everything depends
upon your playing your part properly. You want to have something
to take to the Casino to-morrow, don't you?"</p>

<p>The Marquis breathed a deep sigh. He seemed to be able to
visualise the moment of suspense, the click of the ball falling
into its niche, the croupier's monotonous announcement. He drew
himself up.</p>

<p>"I am a man of honour," he declared. "I shall not fail you.
Let us start at once...."</p>

<p>Outside the Café de Paris, seated before the most
conspicuous table, and looking larger than ever, they found the
lady of whom they were in search. Mr. Billingham marched boldly
up.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Block," he said, "my friend, the Marquis de Felan, has
asked me to present him. The Marquis de Felan&mdash;Mrs.
Block&mdash;also Miss de Felan, the Marquis' niece."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block was fluttered but gratified. The Marquis rose
splendidly to the occasion. He kissed her pudgy fingers with an
air which evoked her wondering admiration, and accepting a chair
by her side he plunged at once into a conversation of a more or
less intimate nature. He played the host to the little
gathering, ordering refreshments and paying for them with an air
of great liberality. After a time Mr. Billingham rose
tentatively to his feet.</p>

<p>"I guess Miss de Felan and I are going to walk along and see
about that table for dinner," he announced. "We'll find you here
when we come back, or else meet in the Casino."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block smiled gracefully; the Marquis for a moment felt
his heart sink, but he stuck to his guns.</p>

<p>"A very delightful man, Mr. Billingham," the lady remarked,
looking after his departing figure.</p>

<p>The Marquis nodded without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he replied. "He has in the world all that he
desires. He has money, and above all he has a facile
disposition. It is a great thing, that! He makes friends easily.
He never suffers from loneliness."</p>

<p>"And do you?" the lady asked softly.</p>

<p>The Marquis sighed. He looked dreamily away towards the
hills. He was quite at his best.</p>

<p>"All my life," he confided, "I have been lonely. I lost my
wife when I was young. I was foolish not to remarry. Now, alas!
when it is too late, I feel the need of a companion."</p>

<p>"Why is it too late?" she enquired tenderly. "The women of
to-day," the Marquis complained, "all prefer young men. Where
should I find a woman attractive enough to be agreeable to me
who would be willing to marry a man of fifty?"</p>

<p>"Very easily, I should think," Mrs. Block declared with
portentous emphasis. "But of course if you want one of these
young fly-away hussies</p>

<p>"But I do not," the Marquis interrupted. "I prefer a woman
of&mdash;of experience. A woman," he went on, leaning a little
towards her&mdash;"may I venture to say&mdash;of something like
your age&mdash;thirty-eight or so."</p>

<p>It was a moment of ecstasy for Mrs. Block. She was wearing a
gown in which she fondly believed that she resembled the
mannequin from whom she had bought it. She was sitting alone
with a Marquis and quite casually she had been taken for
thirty-eight.</p>

<p>"How did you know my age?" she asked, almost archly.</p>

<p>"I am a great diviner of ages," he replied. "It is very
seldom that I make a mistake."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I think there are very few women of my age,
Marquis," the lady confided, "who would not be glad to try and
bring a little sunshine into your life."</p>

<p>The Marquis sighed once more.</p>

<p>"A beautiful way of putting it 1" he murmured. "You cheer me
up, dear lady. May I," he added significantly, "do myself the
honour of calling upon you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Block was more and more fluttered.</p>

<p>"Come this afternoon," she invited. "I have tea in my
sitting-room at four o'clock. Mr. Billingham sometimes drops in,
but this afternoon I shall say that I am engaged."</p>

<p>"Mr. Billingham is a great friend of yours, is he not?" the
Marquis enquired gloomily.</p>

<p>"Nothing special," was the indifferent reply. "We're friends
in a way, of course, but he's not quite my fancy. By the by,"
she went on, "are you and your niece doing any tiling to-night?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of any consequence," the Marquis confessed.</p>

<p>"Come and dine at my hotel&mdash;the Hotel de Paris," the
lady begged eagerly. "Mr. Billingham's coming, and to tell you
the truth, I'd just as soon not dine with him alone. He is very
nice, but people do talk so, and when you've made up your mind
as I have&mdash;well, I don't want to seem to be encouraging
him. You <i>comprenez</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>Parfaitement</i>," the Marquis assured her with a little
inward chuckle. "About half-past-eight, I suppose. Permit me to
escort you across the Place...."</p>

<p>The Marquis strolled down the terrace to Ciro's a little
later with the remains of a smile still lurking about his lips.
He handed his coat and cane to an attendant and crossed the room
confidently towards the table where Madelon and Mr. Billingham
were already seated.</p>

<p>"My friend," he announced, "you no longer exist. I have
achieved a great success. La belle Block is no longer for you. I
take tea with her in her salon this afternoon. You are to be
told that she is engaged. We dine at the Hotel de Paris
tonight&mdash;Madelon and I. A million pounds! It is incredible!
One might be disposed to take this affair seriously."</p>

<p>Madelon shook her head.</p>

<p>"Impossible," she insisted. "You may eat her dinners and rob
her if you will of that staggering jewellery, but more would not
be possible." The Marquis shivered a little as he glanced down
the menu.</p>

<p>"You are right," he assented. "Besides, even if one had the
courage, there would be disagreeable people like executors. You
might find that there were difficulties about the money and
settlements."</p>

<p>"The man who marries a woman like that," Mr. Billingham
declared firmly, "would deserve what he got, and I guess we'll
leave that out of the question. She's one of the people in the
world, though, the Lord meant to be robbed. She goes about
asking for it."</p>

<p>"The scheme itself is as yet scarcely clear to me," the
Marquis murmured.</p>

<p>"Nor to me," Mr. Billingham confessed, attacking his hors
d'ceuvres vigorously. "The stuff's there all right, though, and
we're going to touch it. Make the running as strong as you can
this afternoon, my son. We'll get to work before the week's
out."</p>

<p>The Marquis played with his eyeglass a little nervously.</p>

<p>"You will not suggest, of course, anything in the nature
of&mdash;er&mdash;direct larceny?"</p>

<p>"Not I," Mr. Billingham acquiesced. "Jewel lifting's too
difficult, and besides, we ain't professionals. Something a
little more subtle. I haven't got it quite fixed yet, but I'm
not worrying any."</p>

<p>The Marquis escaped from his afternoon tea entertainment,
still triumphant but shattered. He drank a large whisky and soda
at the bar of the Sporting Club before he felt sufficiently
recovered to make his appearance in the Rooms. By dinnertime,
however, he was entirely himself again. He sat at Mrs. Block's
right hand, and endured stoically the pressure of her immense
foot. The burden of conversation devolved mainly upon him, for
Mr. Billingham was noticeably silent, and, for him, almost
morose.</p>

<p>"Jealous!" his hostess whispered to the Marquis as they left
the dining-room. "Jealous of you, dear!"</p>

<p>The Marquis felt his fingers lightly pressed and received a
languishing glance.</p>

<p>"You have encouraged him," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Not more than the others," she declared, airily and
mendaciously peopling her environment with the forms of many
suitors. "Men are so difficult nowadays," she sighed.</p>

<p>"A beautiful woman has always her embarrassments," the
Marquis sympathised....</p>

<p>The evening progressed according to plan. The little party
had made their way to the Sporting Club, but Mr. Billingham,
becoming more and more silent and depressed, presently withdrew.
Madelon followed shortly afterwards and in a little voiture they
drove to the Carlton. Mr. Billingham's depression had vanished
as though by magic.</p>

<p>"Say, your uncle is getting away with this fine!" he
declared. "It took me a week to get where he's got in less than
a day. He's got the knack of it."</p>

<p>Madelon was looking up at the moon. Mr. Billingham was
suddenly conscious that the night held a charm which was not
altogether pagan. The sky was perfectly clear, the music from
the cafés reached them faintly, in the dim light the
crowds of moving people were like shadows.</p>

<p>"After all," she murmured, "it is rather terrible."</p>

<p>"I don't quite get you," her companion confessed.</p>

<p>"Having to live like this," she explained. "This living on
one's wits. The insecurity of it is horrible. Sometimes it is
amusing, it appeals to one's sense of humour, but it destroys
one's dignity. In time we shall all three become really
bad."</p>

<p>"Not you," Mr. Billingham rejoined softly. "Why not me?" she
asked, turning abruptly and looking at him. "What do you suppose
will be the end of me?"</p>

<p>"I guess you'll marry."</p>

<p>"Who would marry any one like me&mdash;who worth marrying?"
she demanded, with a little note almost of passion in her tone.
"Of course I want to marry&mdash;every girl does. I want a home
of my own and a man to look after me. What sort of a husband do
you think I am likely to find living this kind of a life?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, too, was very serious.</p>

<p>"I guess it's hard on you," he admitted, taking her hand in
his.</p>

<p>"It is hard on all of us, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Say, shall we lay off for a bit," he suggested. "I can make
money on the Square. There's my old Company. They'd have me back
as a Director."</p>

<p>She withdrew her fingers and patted his hand.</p>

<p>"You are very foolish," she said. "Of course you can make
money. You are clever&mdash;but that would not help us. We would
not live upon your charity. And yet, without you we should
probably slip back into helplessness."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham leaned towards her and coughed. His voice was
a little husky.</p>

<p>"Madelon," he began.</p>

<p>She turned her head.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The carriage pulled up with a jerk outside the Carlton; the
commissionaire threw open the door.</p>

<p>"Damn!" Mr. Billingham exclaimed....</p>

<p>At supper-time Madelon became unexpectedly gay. She insisted
upon dancing most of the time and resisted any attempt at
serious conversation.</p>

<p>"Of course you know that you dance absurdly rell," she told
him once. "You must be very fond of it."</p>

<p>"For a fat man," Mr. Billingham admitted, as he wiped his
forehead, "I fancy I can move some. But dancing with you, Miss
Madelon, is pretty easy going. Let's sit and talk for a bit
now."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I could not," she objected. "To-night I am nervous. If I
talk I shall weep. Go and fetch me that dancing
instructor&mdash;the dark one. You will have to give him a
hundred francs. I like that little side-step he does. You can
either rest or try your fortune with the little danseuse."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham obeyed orders so far as the dancing instructor
was concerned, but made no effort towards securing the
companionship of the little danseuse. Instead, he leaned back in
his corner and watched. He seemed to be watching all the room,
but as a matter of fact his eyes never left Madelon. She was
very simply dressed, as usual, in a plain black georgette frock,
but there seemed to be some new quality in her
face&mdash;something a little haunting in her eyes, a dash
almost of recklessness in her graceful movements. She danced
like a devotee, without a word to her partner. Once her eyes met
Mr. Billingham's and she smiled, but even her smile seemed to
possess an indefinable and unrealisable quality. As soon as the
dance had finished she thanked her partner briefly and returned
abruptly to the table.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>"I want to go, please," she begged. "We will see how Uncle is
getting on."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham paid his bill. They stepped outside and into a
voiture. Mr. Billingham's voice was once more a little
husky.</p>

<p>"Madelon," he began</p>

<p>She laid her hand for a moment on his.</p>

<p>"You must please not speak to me all the way back," she
insisted. "And don't mind if I am a little foolish."</p>

<p>Her head disappeared between her hands. Once he saw her
shoulders shiver as though she were sobbing. When they reached
the Club, however, she sat up with a little weary smile. There
were no signs of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You see, after all I am not a finished adventuress," she
said. "I am just a silly girl, who is liable to these sorts of
moods. I think being with this horrible woman has affected me
to-night. I hate ugly things and ugly people. If we continue our
life of crime I insist upon it that our next victim is not of
this type."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block was, for her, almost nervous when on the following
afternoon, in response to an urgent telephone call, she received
a visit from Mr. Billingham. Mr. Billingham seemed to have lost
entirely that spirit of bonhomie which he generally presented to
the world. Even his attire was more sombre than usual. He shook
hands without a smile and declined a chair.</p>

<p>"Annie," he said, using her Christian name boldly, "I have
come for an explanation."</p>

<p>"What sort of an explanation?" she enquired, toying with her
rope of pearls.</p>

<p>"I guess you know," was the stern reply. "We Americans don't
waste words. You know very well you're engaged to marry me and
you're flirting with my friend. It's got to stop right now!" The
situation had its embarrassments, but also its delights. Mrs.
Block felt a thrill of joy as she once more invited her visitor
to seat himself by her side. She had all the sensations of a
heroine of some modern romance.</p>

<p>"Samuel," she said&mdash;"or rather, Mr. Billingham, because
I am not going to call you Samuel any longer&mdash;you will have
to be very generous. I wish to break off our engagement. It was
never announced, as you know."</p>

<p>"Because of the Marquis?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Block admitted the fact.</p>

<p>"It's no use wasting words about it," she went on. "I
promised to marry him last night. We're keeping the engagement
secret for a fortnight and then I'm going back to England to
arrange my affairs."</p>

<p>"And what do you expect me to say?" Mr. Billingham asked.</p>

<p>"I expect you to be a dear and&mdash;give me up," she
declared.</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," he replied firmly.</p>

<p>"You can't hold me to that promise," she insisted. "There's
nothing on paper, anyway. You wouldn't have me marry you without
loving you, Samuel?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham flinched but persevered.</p>

<p>"You are engaged to marry me," he rejoined doggedly. "I may
not be an aristocrat like the Marquis; I may not even be so well
off, but you promised."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block shook her head.</p>

<p>"I can't help that," she said. "If you don't like it you
can&mdash;do the other thing. That's all there is to say about
it. I'd rather be friends."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham remained unmoved.</p>

<p>"I am not to be got rid of like that. I shall appeal to the
Marquis himself," he threatened.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"The Marquis is a man of honour," Mr. Billingham explained.
"I shall go to him. I shall tell him the truth. I shall say
'Mrs. Block was engaged to me. I introduced you as my friend. As
a man of honour I require you to withdraw.' I know my ...
friend," Mr. Billingham continued. "He will do as I desire. He
will leave Monte Carlo the same day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block was pale with anger. Her visitor's words carried
conviction. The phrase "a man of honour" daunted her. In her
fancy she could already see the Marquis seated with folded arms
in his little voiture, with his portmanteau on the seat in
front, on his way to the station.</p>

<p>"You must do nothing of the sort," she insisted.</p>

<p>"What is to prevent me?" he retorted. "Besides"</p>

<p>"Besides what?" she interrupted eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was shamefaced but determined.</p>

<p>"I am poor," he confessed. "I am tired of being poor. I have
lost heavily at the tables."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block came up to the scratch at once.</p>

<p>"For how much money," she asked, "will you leave me and the
Marquis alone?"</p>

<p>"Two thousand pounds," Mr. Billingham replied without
hesitation.</p>

<p>She was a little staggered, but she was a woman of action.
She wrote out a cheque and handed it to him. He shook his
head.</p>

<p>"It would take weeks to get the money for that," he pointed
out.</p>

<p>"They will cash it downstairs," she assured him.</p>

<p>"You get the money and bring it in mille notes," he insisted.
"That's all I ask. You can marry the Marquis as soon as you like
then."</p>

<p>She motioned him to a chair.</p>

<p>"Wait," she ordered.</p>

<p>In a quarter-of-an-hour she returned, slightly breathless,
with a great pile of mille notes in her hand.</p>

<p>"They had to send to the Bank," she explained. "There's your
money. Now you just leave me and the Marquis alone."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham picked up his hat sadly.</p>

<p>"You may be choosing the better man, Annie," he said, "but
this is a great disappointment to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block sneered a little. She was not really fond of
parting with her money.</p>

<p>"You've got something to console yourself with," she snapped
out. "Hurry off, please. I am expecting the Marquis at any
moment."</p>

<p>Thereafter the Marquis played his part manfully for a week.
At the end of that time he made an abrupt appearance as Mr.
Billingham and Madelon were finishing their dinner in a secluded
corner of the Sporting Club Restaurant. He had all the
appearance of a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>"My friend," he exclaimed, sinking into a chair which a
waiter had brought from a neighbouring table, "order me a
liqueur brandy. This must cease. I have reached the limit."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham wisely ordered a double liqueur brandy hastily
and forbore to question his friend.</p>

<p>"I have stood the amused ridicule of a crowd of strangers,"
the latter went on. "I have put up with the agony of being
drenched with intolerable perfumes, of listening to that
strident voice, of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it out!" Mr. Billingham interrupted. "What's the
trouble?"</p>

<p>The Marquis looked around him wildly.</p>

<p>"The lady," he confided, "is becoming amorous. She has held
my hand, she has pressed my feet, until the thing has become
monotonous. Now she has, I fear&mdash;other designs upon
me."</p>

<p>The creases around Mr. Billingham's eyes began to deepen, his
mouth quivered, his efforts at self-control became useless. He
joined in MadeIon's ecstatic outburst of amusement. When he had
recovered sufficiently to wipe his eyes, the Marquis had drunk
his brandy and was looking thoughtfully at the bottle.</p>

<p>"We dined," the Marquis explained, "at the Hotel de Paris.
She insisted&mdash;declared that it was too quiet there and that
she wanted me alone. She wore white satin,&mdash;not enough of
it by yards. She wore jewellery which made the people blink when
she came into the room. She sat next a party of your compatriots
and she called me 'Marquis' at the top of her voice every few
minutes. When at last I thought my hour of comparative release
had arrived, she declared that she had a headache and would
spend the evening in her sitting-room. She has ordered me to
follow her. I am to return&mdash;to sit with her there alone!
She has whispered in my ear that we are engaged."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham made signs to the waiter, who filled the
Marquis' glass.</p>

<p>"You've got to go through with it, Marquis," he declared.</p>

<p>"But what is to be the end?" the Marquis demanded, almost
passionately. "People are beginning to smile when they see us
together. Our engagement has even been announced in some of the
papers. One day she will march me into a church or registry
office and I shall emerge a married man. She is
masterful&mdash;overwhelming! What is your plan? It is time to
announce it."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham reflected.</p>

<p>"There have been a few little pickings," he mused.</p>

<p>"It is true," the Marquis assented. "I have jewellery for the
first time for many years; pearl studs like blobs, and some
sapphire sleeve links and waistcoat buttons which are admirable.
These things are so much to the good, but I cannot go on
collecting them. There is a certain definiteness," he added, "in
the woman's intentions towards me this evening, which is
horrible."</p>

<p>Madelon, wiping the tears from her eyes, leaned forward.</p>

<p>"There must be a rescue party," she suggested. "I agree," Mr.
Billingham assented. "In ten minutes your sufferings shall be at
an end; temporarily, at any rate. I will find some excuse. We
will break in upon you."</p>

<p>"With that promise and under those conditions," the Marquis
said, "I will return...."</p>

<p>The Marquis kept his word, and Mr. Billingham carried out his
share of the bargain. In less than a quarter of an hour he
presented himself at the sitting-room of Mrs. Block's gorgeous
suite. He was immediately aware of tragical happenings. The
Marquis, looking a little dazed, was standing upon the
hearthrug. Mrs. Block, grasping a telegraphic despatch in her
hand, was in a state almost of collapse upon the sofa. The
newcomer looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"I regret my inevitable intrusion," he began&mdash;"Monsieur
le Duc, the Marquis' father, has telephoned from Nice."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block banged the end of the sofa with her fist.</p>

<p>"Damn you all&mdash;dukes and marquises and the lot of you!"
she cried. "Tom will smash you when he comes, and he'll kill me.
What a fool I've been!"</p>

<br>

"Tom will smash you when he comes, and<br>

</div>

<br>

<p>"Say, who is this 'Tom,' anyway?" Mr. Billingham
demanded.</p>

<p>"My husband!" Mrs. Block declared dramatically.</p>

<p>"Her husband!" the Marquis murmured under his breath with a
beatific smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Block rose to her feet. She was, after all, a woman of
force and determination.</p>

<p>"Look here, you two," she confessed, "this is the long and
short of it. I'm no widow. My husband's hale and hearty, though
he's sixty years old. I've been down here three years, and a
lone woman doesn't get the show she ought to. She wants some one
attached to her. I guess I lost my head a bit. I wanted a man
along, and I chose the simplest way of getting one. Now it's got
put in the papers about me and the Marquis, my old man's seen
it, and he'll be here to-morrow morning at twelve-thirty. Years
ago," she went on, with a livid little shadow of memory
blanching her face, "he used to beat me. He'd think nothing of
doing it again, and as to any man he's ever run up
against&mdash;well, he's made short work of him. 'Fighting Tom,'
they used to call him.... Don't stand there looking like
nincompoops, both of you! What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>The Marquis duly interpreted a glance from Mr.
Billingham.</p>

<p>"I shall consult with my friend," he said. "You have treated
me very badly, madame."</p>

<p>"Following upon your treatment of me," Mr. Billingham added
meaningly, "the situation becomes a grave one. With your
permission, we will call upon you at half-past ten to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Let's have it out now," the lady begged.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"At half-past ten," he repeated. "Come along, Marquis!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Block had not the strength to argue. The two men took a
dignified leave of her.</p>

<p>At half-past ten on the following morning a very altered Mrs.
Block received her two visitors. She was wearing a plainly made
gown, her pudgy face was devoid of its artificial colour, her
eyebrows appeared to have lost their shape, and nothing but a
cascade of jewellery remained of her previous magnificence. She
scarcely waited for them to sit down.</p>

<p>"Well?" she demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham coughed.</p>

<p>"The Marquis desires to know your wishes, madame," Mr.
Billingham announced stiffly.</p>

<p>"What I want him to do is to clear out," the lady declared.
"If Tom's seen that bit in the paper about the Marquis and
me&mdash;which he must have done as he's never left England
before in his life&mdash;he'll hunt this place until he's found
him, and then there'll be trouble. I shall tell him that the
whole thing is a bit of newspaper stuff, that I don't know any
Marquis, that I haven't any friends here at all."</p>

<p>"I gather that you desire the Marquis to leave Monte Carlo,"
Mr. Billingham observed.</p>

<p>"This morning," was the prompt assent. "I want him out of the
way before Tom starts making enquiries."</p>

<p>"You will understand, I am sure," his friend continued, "that
for a man fixed like the Marquis, with a whole heap of social
engagements, this is some sacrifice."</p>

<p>"It is intolerable!" the Marquis interposed. "I shall lose my
roulette, my rooms are taken for another month&mdash;I lose,
also, more than I can express," he added, with a little bow.</p>

<p>"You can cut that out," was the blunt retort. "You may or you
may not have been in earnest, but I'm not going to believe that
you're going to break your heart. Will you go or won't you?"</p>

<p>"I prefer to remain," the Marquis announced coldly. "If your
husband desires satisfaction I shall be at his service."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block laughed. It was not exactly a laugh of humour, but
it was the first time her features had relaxed.</p>

<p>"Tom's idea of 'satisfaction' would be to knock you into a
jelly," she confided&mdash;"and he'll do it, too."</p>

<p>"I await the arrival of monsieur," the Marquis repeated
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Look here, madame," Mr. Billingham intervened, "I guess
we're wasting time. The Marquis is like myself&mdash;a man of
moderate means. After losing a small fortune, he's struck a vein
of luck and he's winning every day at the tables here. His rooms
are taken for another month and he'll have to pay for them. If
you want him to quit for your convenience, you must talk
business about it."</p>

<p>"O-ho!" the lady exclaimed. "So that's the game, is it? I'm
beginning to wonder," she added suspiciously, "whether the
Marquis isn't another of your kidney."</p>

<p>The Marquis picked up his hat and coat.</p>

<p>"The interview is at an end," he declared. "I find the
attitude of madame outrageous."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block sprang up and barred his exit.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she enjoined. "Your friend knows what he's
talking about. How much do you want to clear out of Monte Carlo
before halfpast twelve, not show yourself here for at least a
week, and deny you ever set eyes on me if Tom finds you
out?"</p>

<p>"My friend will arrange such a matter," the Marquis replied
icily. "I have no head for figures myself. These moves are very
expensive."</p>

<p>"The Marquis will leave by the twelve o'clock train to Nice,"
Mr. Billingham promised, "for the sum of two thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>Mrs. Block looked from one to the other of the two men. There
were times when she was a very ugly woman, and this was one of
them.</p>

<p>"I believe you two," she began, "are nothing more nor
less&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham held out his hand with a warning gesture, and
the woman, with an effort, held her tongue. The Marquis threw
his card upon the table.</p>

<p>"Present this with my compliments to your husband, madame,"
he begged. "I shall remain in this afternoon."</p>

<p>The woman leaned over the table, tore up the card savagely,
and threw the fragments into the fire. Then she crossed the
room, unlocked a drawer and produced a thick wad of mille notes.
She counted them out in piles of tens. At a hundred thousand she
paused. Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"The exchange to-day," he reminded her dryly....</p>

<p>She flung down another four packets. The Marquis picked them
up with well-assumed nonchalance. His fingers trembled a little,
however, as he thrust the entire roll into his breast coat
pocket.</p>

<p>"I've been a damned fool," the woman confessed, "and I
suppose I've got to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Fools always pay," Mr. Billingham murmured, as he picked up
his hat and cane. "We have the honour, madame!"</p>

<p>"The deep regret!" the Marquis echoed.</p>

<p>"Go to blazes!" was the lady's valedictory remark."</p>

<p>"Madelon and Mr. Billingham that night, being in a festive
mood, dined at the Hotel de Paris. They were still considering
the matter of <i>hors d'ceuvres</i> when a <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i> ushered in some late arrivals. Mr. Billingham
glanced up casually, but his eyes remained transfixed. Madelon
slightly turned her head. Mrs. Block, in one of her most
gorgeous frocks, was sailing through the room. Behind her was a
small, ill-made man of about five feet seven, with sandy hair,
unpleasant complexion, bushy eyebrows, narrow, suspicious eyes,
and a very acquisitive mouth. He was badly dressed and he had
the clumsy presence and the assertive manners of a stranger to
such places. The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who had been
talking to Madelon, smiled.</p>

<p>"It is the husband of the wealthy lady from Leeds in
England," he confided. "He arrived this morning."</p>

<p>"Fighting Tom!" Mr. Billingham gasped.</p>

TERROR</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Collier's Weekly</i>, 16 May 1925</h3>

<hr>

<br>

<p class="first">THE MARQUIS always talked very bad English when
he was angry, and this morning he was very angry indeed.
Climbing up narrow and precipitous paths upon a surface of loose
stones, pushing his way occasionally through brambles and
undergrowth, and looking downwards from heights, which always
made him giddy, had been undertakings which had combined to
incense him. He was not dressed or built for such mad escapades.
The sight of Madelon, bare-headed, and laughing, having the air
of one to whom such excursions, instead of being a torture, were
a keen pleasure, only irritated him, whereas the final note of
exasperation he discovered in the pleasant good temper of Mr.
Samuel T. Billingham, their guide and host, who, with a huge
cigar in his mouth, was walking with springy steps and unabated
cheerfulness up the path which the Marquis had passionately
declared to be only fit for goats and idiots.</p>

<p>"I can no further make this absurd promenade," the Marquis
announced, sinking on to a heap of stones and dabbing with a
scented pocket-handkerchief drops of moisture upon his forehead,
which must not be allowed to reach his eyebrows. "It is an
absurdity! I have a pain of the stomach, a pain of the knees, a
pain of the back. It is not for this I came. Where is the
automobile?"</p>

<p>"Poor uncle!" Madelon sympathised. "I had forgotten that you
were not used to walking. You should have lived in England as I
have done. But the view&mdash;you must admit that the view is
marvellous!"</p>

<p>The comments of the Marquis upon the view were delivered in
fluent and sacrilegious French. He displayed an acquaintance
with the various forms of blasphemy peculiar to his language
which moved even Mr. Billingham to wondering admiration.</p>

<p>"When I feel better," he concluded, after a moment's electric
pause, "I shall apologise. At present I will only say that the
view from the window of my <i>salon</i>, which takes in the
Casino and all that glorious sea, is better worth having."</p>

<p>"Less than a kilometre to go," Mr. Billingham declared. "I
reckon we shall strike the main road just beyond that clump of
firs, and that's where I told the car to pick us up. Another
quarter of an hour, Marquis, and we shall be in St.
Félix."</p>

<p>"If one could only drink something!" the latter observed
pettishly, as he rose to his feet. "I miss my morning
apéritif."</p>

<p>"That's coming to you, sure," Mr. Billingham promised. "I've
done this tramp before, and unless I'm mistaken there's a little
café where this path joins the cart track."</p>

<p>The prospect was sufficiently encouraging to induce the
Marquis to struggle to his feet. They clambered another fifty
yards or so up the stony path and found themselves in a rough
track which had evidently been made by the carting of timber
from the other side of the ravine. A little way along there was
a small white-plastered building, to which Mr. Billingham
pointed.</p>

<p>"The Café du Forêt!" he exclaimed. "The worst
ever, so far as I remember, but a Dubonnet won't poison us."</p>

<p>The Marquis almost smiled.</p>

<p>"A Dubonnet will be acceptable," he admitted. "The place
appears poverty-stricken, but if one can secure an unopened
bottle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll find that," Mr. Billingham interrupted
confidently.</p>

<p>A few minutes' further climb brought them to the café.
It was small, dilapidated and uninviting. Nevertheless it
proclaimed itself in rudely painted black letters to be a
restaurant where "<i>Vins et Consommations</i>" were to be
obtained. There were three iron tables outside with a couple of
chairs at each, but no sign of life. The door stood open and his
two companions followed Mr. Billingham inside. There was no one
behind the little counter, no one in the rude little compartment
with its sanded floor and benches in place of chairs. There were
bottles upon the shelves, however, and a tumbler half full of
brandy upon the counter. Mr. Billingham raised his voice and the
glasses around shook.</p>

<p>"Hallo there!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Allo, allo!" the Marquis echoed. "<i>N'y a-t-il personne ici
pour nous servir</i>?"</p>

<p>There was a stolid, unsympathetic lack of response. They
waited for a moment, then Mr. Billingham opened the door of the
room behind the bar and glanced around. It was a rough-looking
kitchen, with a stone floor and a few clumsy articles of
furniture. A string of onions, a scraggy piece of meat, and a
rabbit hung down from iron hooks in the ceiling. There were pots
and dishes upon the table, but no fire or any sign of recent
occupation. Mr. Billingham raised his voice again without
result, opened still another door, and called up a flight of
flimsy stairs&mdash;also without result. Then he returned to his
companions.</p>

<p>"There is no one about at all," he announced.</p>

<p>"You might try outside," Madelon suggested.</p>

<p>Outside there was no garden but a little clearing, a rudely
constructed shed built of pine logs from which the bark had not
been stripped, and a lean-to shelter, with a corrugated iron
roof, against the wall. Mr. Billingham again, in stentorian
tones, invited the presence of the missing innkeeper and again
without response. He returned to the bar.</p>

<p>"Deserted!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"They were preparing for a <i>fête</i> at the small
village we passed through last," Madelon remarked. "Perhaps the
people have gone there, or the man may work in the woods."</p>

<p>The Marquis smiled. He had been studying the labels upon the
bottles.</p>

<p>"At least," he pointed out, "they have left a bottle of
Dubonnet. Produce that excellent corkscrew of yours, my friend
Billingham. We will serve ourselves and leave the money."</p>

<p>They opened the bottle of Dubonnet which the Marquis had
dragged down from the shelf, found some thick wine-glasses, and
seated themselves before one of the rude tables outside. Madelon
gave a little exclamation of relief as they passed out into the
pine-scented sunshine.</p>

<p>"That place gave me the shivers," she declared. "It seemed so
very empty, so very silent."</p>

<p>"It's a lonely spot," Mr. Billingham agreed, pouring out the
Dubonnet. "They seem to have let off felling the timber round
here, and I guess that took the trade away."</p>

<p>"So long as they are absent," the Marquis said, "one owes
them gratitude that they left the place open. Never have I
tasted Dubonnet with a better flavour. Tell me, my friend
Billingham, how much further of this abominable promenade before
we reach the automobile?"</p>

<p>"Not more than half a kilometre," Mr. Billingham assured him.
"There's a little path which leads straight up to the road from
the cart track. There we shall find the automobile. In a few
minutes more we shall be in St. Félix. After
that&mdash;the <i>déjeuner</i>!"</p>

<p>The Marquis breathed a little sigh of content and helped
himself once more from the bottle. Madelon, who had set her
glass down empty, was fidgeting about as though anxious to
start.</p>

<p>"Hungry?" Mr. Billingham inquired.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have taken a dislike to this place," she confided. "Am I
superstitious, I wonder? I have a terrible feeling about
it."</p>

<p>The Marquis was sympathetic but entirely comfortable and not
disposed to hurry. He lit a cigarette and leaned back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"I understand," he murmured. "A deserted inn on the edge of
the forest! There are all the materials here for drama. There
was a story I once read&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and the cigarette fell from his
fingers. Mr. Billingham sprang to his feet. Madelon, who had
wandered a few yards away from them and turned back towards the
house, was standing suddenly rigid, suddenly pale. The cry which
had startled them had escaped from her lips. She pointed to the
window above the door.</p>

<p>"There was a face there!" she cried. "Some one up in the
room!"</p>

<br>

She pointed to the window above the door."There was<br>

</div>

<br>

<p>Mr. Billingham remained composed.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that isn't so terrible after all," he
observed. "I dare say there's some one ill there. Who was
it&mdash;a man or a woman?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," Madelon answered faintly. "It was&mdash;just
a face!"</p>

<p>"Seems to have given you a shock," Mr. Billingham continued.
"Sit down, Miss Madelon, and drink half a glass more of this
stuff. Guess I'd better hunt round and see if there's any help
wanted."</p>

<p>Madelon&mdash;young woman of nerve and courage though she
was&mdash;staggered into a chair and was utterly unable to raise
to her lips the glass which her uncle hastily filled. Mr.
Billingham disappeared inside the building. In about five
minutes he returned.</p>

<p>"There's only one room upstairs," he announced, "and there
ain't a soul in it."</p>

<p>"But I saw some one," Madelon protested.</p>

<p>He strolled a yard or two away and looked back at the window,
pausing a moment to relight his cigar which had gone out.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no one there now," he assured her. "There's
only one room and not a cupboard for a hiding-place. There are
two beds&mdash;both look as though they'd been slept
in&mdash;but there isn't a human being in the shanty. You can
take my word for it."</p>

<p>Madelon looked at him steadfastly. She had drunk some of the
Dubonnet and she was becoming herself again.</p>

<p>"Do you believe, then," she asked, "that I saw the face of
some one who does not exist?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say you were the sort who saw spooks," Mr.
Billingham admitted. "All I say is, there's no one there
now."</p>

<p>"You must surely have realised, my dear Madelon," the Marquis
intervened, "whether the face was the face of a man or a
woman."</p>

<p>"I should have said that it was the face of a young man,"
Madelon replied, "but it might have been the face of a girl.
There was a mass of black hair. The face itself was smooth. It
was the eyes that were horrible."</p>

<p>"You don't say!" Mr. Billingham murmured with tolerant
sympathy. "Kind of scared, were they?"</p>

<p>Madelon rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Please let us go now," she begged. "I cannot talk about it
any more. I can only assure you of one thing. Something terrible
has happened here. Please, Mr. Billingham!"</p>

<p>"We'll get right along," was the prompt response. "Ten francs
will square us for the bottle of Dubonnet, I guess&mdash;ten
francs and what's left of the bottle. I'll put it underneath the
glass&mdash;see? Now, we're right! Just a yard or two through
the trees and then we'll leave this place behind us."</p>

<p>"I hope," Madelon murmured as they passed swiftly back to the
cart track, "that I may be able to forget it."</p>

<p>The Marquis smiled.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh, my child!" he exclaimed. "You are too sensitive,
too emotional! Material discomforts you scoff at. A fancy
sometimes tortures you. Behold, the good news!"</p>

<p>He pointed upwards. At the end of the path was the curling
main road and by the side of it the automobile Mr. Billingham
had hired for their day's excursion. No vehicle before had ever
appealed so greatly to the Marquis.</p>

<p>"We've struck it right after all," Mr. Billingham declared
with satisfaction. "Gee, how hot the sun is out here! Lunch on
the terrace in twenty minutes, Miss Madelon. Now, let's forget
that dirty little shanty and its spook!"</p>

<p>The spook was not so easy to forget. Madelon, with Mr.
Billingham as her escort, was on her way that evening from the
Casino to Ciro's when she suddenly gripped her companion's
arm.</p>

<p>"Look," she cried, in a tone vibrant with absolute terror.
"Look! The boy at that table!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's eyes followed her gesture. The young man was
certainly an unusual sight in such surroundings. His clothes,
although perfectly new, were clumsily fashioned and of the sort
worn on fête days by the peasants. His hat was pushed to
the back of his head, and, although it was of the sombrero order
affected by the mountaineers of the district, it failed to
conceal the masses of black hair which gave him almost a
grotesque appearance. His complexion was the usual burnt olive
of the Proven&ccedil;al labourer. It was again his expression
which arrested. His eyes were large and black, without either
the vacancy or the humour of the peasant on a holiday. They
looked neither at the people who passed, the trees and flowers
of the plaza, nor at the bottle of wine which stood half-empty
by his side. They seemed to be looking at something which, if it
existed at all, existed far away.</p>

<p>"That," Madelon said, "was the face I saw at the upstairs
window of that place this morning."</p>

<p>Her hand was clutching nervously at his arm. Mr. Billingham
patted it gently.</p>

<p>"Say, this boy has got on your nerves some," he declared.
"I'll go across and have a talk to him. Sit down and wait for
me."</p>

<p>"I think I will for a moment," Madelon acquiesced.</p>

<p>She seated herself on one of the benches by the side of the
pavement. Mr. Billingham crossed the road and addressed the boy
in hesitating but comprehensible French.</p>

<p>"Do you belong to the inn up near St. Félix?" he
inquired. "The young lady and I were there this morning."</p>

<p>The boy stared at his questioner for a moment with parted
lips and terrified expression. He made absolutely no reply,
however.</p>

<p>"We could not find any one there," Mr. Billingham continued,
speaking with laborious care. "We hoped there was nothing
wrong."</p>

<p>The boy broke out into a stream of rapid, unintelligible
speech, to which Mr. Billingham listened in ever-increasing
confusion. He turned round to find Madelon by his side.</p>

<p>"Say, this young goat-herd has got hold of a lingo of his
own," he complained. "I don't know as any one but a monkey could
tell what he's chattering about. Seems kind of annoyed with me,
but I can't get a word of it."</p>

<p>"It is the dialect of the Italians here," Madelon explained.
"Let me try."</p>

<p>She spoke to him patiently. The boy only shook his head.
Presently he poured out another glass of wine and drank it. Then
he sat quite still, stolid and inattentive. He took no notice of
Madelon's questions. He showed no sign of understanding a word
she said. In the end she was seized by a sudden revulsion. She
tugged at her companion's arm.</p>

<p>"Come away!" she begged. "He will not reply. He pretends not
to understand me, though I believe that he does. Let us leave
him."</p>

<p>"Guess you're right," Mr. Billingham assented. "He's a crazy
loon, if ever there was one, or he wouldn't speak such
gibberish. Anyway, it's not our business."</p>

<p>They passed on. The young man looked after them sullenly and
helped himself to more wine. Ten minutes later, when Mr.
Billingham, obeying an unaccountable impulse, chose a moment
when Madelon was talking to some acquaintances and hurried back,
the chair was empty. The young man was gone.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Mr. Billingham murmured to himself, struggling
against a curious feeling of uneasiness, "it ain't our
affair."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Billingham had twice
declared that whatever trouble there might be or have been at
the little inn on the edge of the forest was not his affair, it
was barely ten o'clock in the morning when he left the
automobile which he had hired in the Square at Monte Carlo,
clambered down the steep path, made his way along the cart
track, pushed through the clump of trees and found himself
before the café. There was no smoke emerging from the
chimney, and Mr. Billingham gave a little start of surprise as
he saw on the table, in front of the still open door, the
half-consumed bottle of Dubonnet and the ten-franc note under
one of the glasses.</p>

<p>"I guess passers-by round here are pretty scarce," he
ruminated. "Seems queer that whoever quit the place didn't
trouble to lock up. Left in a hurry, perhaps."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham would doubtless have scorned the suggestion
that he talked to himself for the fact of any pleasure he might
derive from hearing his own voice, and yet it was without a
doubt true that the uneasy feeling of the day before had
returned to an even larger extent. He pushed open the door. The
half-emptied tumbler was still upon the counter. Some little
disarrangement of the bottles upon the shelf, effected by their
removal of the bottle of Dubonnet, still existed. He threw open
the door leading to the kitchen and called out:</p>

<p>"Hallo there!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. He mounted the stairs with footsteps
which he was half-ashamed to admit were reluctant ones. The
bedroom was as empty as it had been on the previous day. There
was no place to hide anywhere&mdash;no other room. As he
descended, however, he realised that it was perfectly possible
for the owner of the face whom Madelon had seen there to have
escaped by the back door and reached the wood in the matter of a
very few seconds. He returned to the kitchen. Here he noticed
for the first time that by the side of the fireplace was a
clumsy framework door, which looked as though it might have led
into a pantry or cupboard. He moved towards it and raised the
latch. Before he threw the door open, he knew. When he closed it
again&mdash;in the space of a second or two&mdash;there were
great beads of perspiration upon his forehead. The colour had
left his cheeks and the blood seemed to have been drained from
body. He staggered out into the bar, gripped the counter for a
moment, saw a bottle of Martell's brandy on the bottom row of
the shelf, seized it, made his faltering way outside, knocked
off its neck against the top of one of the iron tables, and
drank.... Mr. Billingham was a strong man and his recovery was
prompt. Nevertheless, he was breathing heavily as he hastened up
the hill to where his automobile was waiting.</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">Mr. Billingham staggered out into the bar.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Drive to the Mairie at St. Félix," he ordered....</p>

<p>Arrived at the Mairie&mdash;a small wistaria-covered building
on the outskirts of the straggling village of St.
Félix&mdash;Mr. Billingham was ushered at once by a
gendarme into a bare little apartment with whitewashed walls and
a row of benches, in which a very formal-looking gentleman with
a closely-trimmed black beard, very smoothly brushed hair, and
gold-rimmed pince-nez, was seated at a table, signing documents.
His work for the morning had consisted of adjudicating upon a
highly important case of fowl stealing, and he looked with some
surprise at his visitor's precipitate entrance. Mr. Billingham's
opening statement was in far from lucid English. The magistrate,
with a puzzled expression, waved him to a seat.</p>

<p>"<i>Comment</i>, monsieur?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham pulled himself together. His French, though
not rapid, was fairly precise, and he had no difficulty in
making himself understood.</p>

<p>"A woman has been murdered at a little café at the
edge of the forest," he announced.</p>

<p>The magistrate gasped. The gendarme gasped.</p>

<p>"Continue, monsieur," the former begged.</p>

<p>Mr Billingham told his story. The magistrate gave him his
entire attention. It was a great day, this! A murder! Obviously
a murder, in his district! He began to make notes of Mr.
Billingham's statement. He was friendly but official. It was
quite hopeless for him to conceal the fact that the news had
filled him with pleasurable interest. It had been the secret
desire of his life to have the handling of such a case.</p>

<p>"I will accompany you to the inn myself at once, monsieur,"
he announced, rising to his feet. "You can accommodate a
gendarme, perhaps, on the front of your car.... Let the Court
remain open till my return," he directed a subordinate. "Tell me
again your story as we proceed, monsieur."</p>

<p>Mr Billingham went through the few facts again. In response
to his own inquiries the magistrate gave him certain
information.</p>

<p>"The inn," he said, "was kept by a very respectable, good
man, of the name of Pierre Anson. He lived there with his wife,
the woman who without a doubt is the victim, and his nephew, a
young man of whom one hears not too much of good. The wife, it
is reported, had savings&mdash;savings of some account&mdash;and
the nephew knew it. Three days ago news came to Anson of the
death of a relative in Marseilles. This I know because he came
to me for information as to the burying of the relative and as
to his journey. He set off last Monday morning. He was expecting
to return to-night. He left alone his wife and this nephew. One
fears to reflect what may have happened!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham sighed, because he was a kind-hearted man, and
because a vision of that flashing knife of the guillotine is
terrible to such. Nevertheless it was his duty.</p>

<p>"Last night," he confided, "the young man, who apparently was
the nephew of Pierre Anson, was drinking wine at the Café
de Paris in Monte Carlo. He was pointed out to me by the young
lady, who declared that his was the face she saw at the
window."</p>

<p>The magistrate nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"It is a crime," he said, "in effect simple, not uncommon
amongst this race of people. When heated with wine and drunk
with the desire of pleasure, the shedding of blood is nothing.
I, who tell you this, know."</p>

<p>They arrived at their destination. The magistrate and the
gendarme made their way to the little room. Mr. Billingham sat
outside. He had no soul for horrors. It was an hour before they
rejoined him. The magistrate was carrying his notebook in his
hand.</p>

<p>"All is clear," he announced. "The savings of the poor woman
have disappeared. To-night, or to-morrow at the latest, the
young man will be in our hands. Your name and address, if you
please, monsieur. You will attend the Court?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Mr. Billingham promised.</p>

<p>"The young man," the magistrate continued, "will have had two
nights of that wild pleasure of which he has lain awake, here in
this place of tranquillity, and dreamed.
Afterwards&mdash;well&mdash;he may escape with the penitentiary.
One knows little of his age."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked up at the blank window. The silence
which brooded over the place remained unbroken. A gendarme,
having closed the door, seated himself outside.</p>

<p>"Pierre Anson will arrive by the night train," the magistrate
remarked. "It will be a sad home-coming for him."</p>

<p>"Better," Mr. Billingham rejoined, with a little shiver,
"than if he had found the house empty and opened that door, as I
did."</p>

<p>The most pathetic sight in the bare, whitewashed little room
of the Mairie on the first morning of the examination was Pierre
Anson, the woodman. The tears streamed down his brown, wrinkled
face as the magistrate addressed his first few kindly questions.
He had, at one time, as was evident, been a man of great stature
and strength. Now he seemed shrunken up, stricken with the
horror of his home-coming.</p>

<p>"Your wife had savings, Pierre Anson?" the magistrate asked
him.</p>

<p>"She was a thrifty woman," was the tremulous reply. "She had
always a stocking."</p>

<p>"Do you know how much was in it?"</p>

<p>"She never told me."</p>

<p>"Did your nephew&mdash;the young man between the gendarmes
there&mdash;the young man whom you trusted alone with your
wife&mdash;did he know?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," Pierre Anson answered. "He was always
wanting money."</p>

<p>"You have been to Marseilles to bury a relative&mdash;is it
not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"You thought it safe to leave this youth, of whose character
we hear little that is good, alone with your wife in such a
desolate spot?"</p>

<p>"She was his aunt," the man announced, with a little sob.
"How would I dream of anything so horrible?"</p>

<p>The magistrate bent over his papers. Mr. Billingham, seated
by his side, watched the shaft of sunlight which had found its
way through the cobwebbed windows and had fallen upon the boy's
face. Madelon, who had also been invited by the magistrate to
occupy a chair near him, scribbled something on a piece of paper
and passed it to her neighbour. He glanced at it and passed it
on to the magistrate, who studied it through his pince-nez with
pursed lips. Finally, with a little shrug of the shoulders, he
twiddled it between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Where did you stay in Marseilles, Pierre Anson?" he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>The woodman lifted his head and stared uncomprehendingly at
his questioner.</p>

<p>"I asked you where you stayed in Marseilles," the magistrate
repeated.</p>

<p>Pierre Anson shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not remember," he said. "It was a small lodging-house
down by the quay."</p>

<p>"You do not remember?" the magistrate echoed, in a tone of
some surprise. "Is that not strange, Pierre Anson?"</p>

<p>"It was somewhere near where my cousin lay dead," the man
answered, a little sullenly. "I could find the place&mdash;the
name I never knew."</p>

<p>The magistrate's right arm suddenly shot out.</p>

<p>"Or is it that you are lying, Pierre Anson?" he thundered.
"Is it that you yourself, before you left home in the small
hours of that Tuesday morning, murdered your wife and stole her
savings, forced two of the notes on that half-witted youth,
persuaded him to buy clothes and go down to Monte Carlo, and
went yourself to Nice&mdash;your <i>rendezvous</i> at
Nice&mdash;to your <i>rendezvous</i> with Lucie
Bérard?"</p>

<p>The man half-rose to his feet. His eyes seemed suddenly
bloodshot. He swayed about as though striving to speak.</p>

<p>"Bring the woman," the magistrate ordered.</p>

<p>Pierre Anson glanced fearfully towards the door. A woman in
the care of a gendarme entered. They looked at one another
across the room&mdash;the man and the woman&mdash;and one
understood.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
"Bring the woman," the magistrate ordered. Pierre Anson glanced
fear-<br>
fully towards the door. A woman in the care of a gendarme entered.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"The money of which you robbed your wife, Pierre Anson," the
magistrate continued, "was found upon this woman. You have
visited her month by month in Nice. You would have thrust the
burden of this crime upon your nephew. You yourself are the
murderer! Do you confess?"</p>

<p>A cry rang through the Court&mdash;not from the man, Pierre
Anson, who was indeed incapable of speech, whose hands were
fighting the air, who fought against unconsciousness, but from
the boy who stood between the gendarmes. His eyes were fixed
upon the woman who had entered the Court Room, His indifference
had vanished. His eyes again were lit with fear.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is I!" she answered.</p>

<p>The boy turned towards the magistrate.</p>

<p>"It was I who killed the woman," he pleaded. "No one else
knows anything about it."</p>

<p>"You are a liar and a fool!" the woman declared angrily. "It
was he, the bungler there," she added, pointing to Pierre Anson.
"And there is the money."</p>

<p>She dashed a bundle of notes upon the floor and stood with
folded arms, defiant, the incarnation of an evil spirit. A
gendarme touched Pierre Anson upon the shoulder. The proceedings
were over.</p>

<p>Afterwards the magistrate entertained his two distinguished
guests with a bottle of sweet wine and biscuits in his
retiring-room. He was well pleased with the whole business.</p>

<p>"Amongst the lowest classes of our peasants," he explained,
"these family dramas are not uncommon. Pierre Anson, as the
story goes now, loved both sisters. He married the older
one&mdash;a widow with money. The rest of the story unfolds
itself. Yet Pierre Anson had cunning which few of these peasants
possess. He deceived us all. It is to you, monsieur," he added,
turning to Mr. Billingham, "that we owe the clue by means of
which we arrived at the truth."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not to me," he rejoined; "to the young lady."</p>

<p>The magistrate bowed.</p>

<p>"Then might one inquire," he ventured, "what led the young
lady to doubt the lad's guilt?"</p>

<p>Madelon was once more serious.</p>

<p>"Something in his eyes," she confided, with a little shudder
of reminiscence; "something which was there and something which
was nor there."</p>

<p>The magistrate raised his glass and bowed first to Madelon,
then to Mr. Billingham.</p>

<p>"Something in his eyes," he repeated. "Well, one reads
somewhere in a lay commentary upon our laws and the discovery of
crime, that the born detective must have an instinct for the
truth. Mademoiselle, there is a great vocation open to you."</p>

<p>Madelon smiled. She sipped her wine, but she remained
silent.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">"TOO bad!" Mr. Billingham murmured
sympathetically.</p>

<p>Madelon was almost angry. She leaned across the table towards
her companion.</p>

<p>"Speak to him, please," she begged. "It is impossible that we
go on like this. It becomes an affair of charity. You dispense
the money. Nobody earns anything. He thinks and dreams and talks
of nothing but roulette. You wished him to make some enquiries
about those people at Nice. He did nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, they've gone now, anyway," her companion remarked.</p>

<p>"Will you speak to him?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"Right away," Mr. Bilhngham promised. "Here he comes. Now you
shall hear for yourself."</p>

<p>"Do not be too easy with him," she enjoined.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," was the confident reply.</p>

<p>The Marquis drifted in from the Arcade to the glass-sheltered
bar. He was happy and spruce. He had a mille's worth of counters
in his pocket and the music of the whirling wheel in his ears.
He greeted his niece and his friend with gay cordiality.</p>

<p>"A minute or two late, I fear," he apologised. "Let mine be
the pleasure. Waiter!"</p>

<p>An approved order was given. The Marquis accepted a
chair.</p>

<p>"Mr. Billingham has something to say to you, Uncle," Madelon
confided.</p>

<p>"A little matter of business which arises, eh?" the Marquis
asked. "Well, I am at your disposal."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Mr. Billingham declared, "neither your
niece nor I have had any fortune for the last few weeks, and, to
put it bluntly, funds are running low. We think that it is time
you bestirred yourself."</p>

<p>"Indeed yes, Uncle," Madelon intervened. "You spend morning,
noon and night at the tables. You make no acquaintances. You
take no initiative."</p>

<p>"You being, so to speak," Mr. Billingham went on, "the social
bird of the party, we expect you to be more in evidence."</p>

<p>The Marquis gulped down his cocktail.</p>

<p>"You think that I am neglecting our interests&mdash;our
joint interests?" he demanded, in a hurt tone.</p>

<p>"That idea has occurred to us," Mr. Billingham admitted.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about it," Madelon said coldly.</p>

<p>The Marquis made signs to the waiter.</p>

<p>"I am," he announced, "in a position to prove that you have
misjudged me. I have, in our joint interests, made the
acquaintance of two gentlemen who possess the most amazing
gifts. They need fresh blood and&mdash;er&mdash;introductions. I
am arranging to provide them with both."</p>

<p>"What may their gifts be?" Mr. Billingham enquired.</p>

<p>"They are expert poker players," the Marquis explained.
"Their knowledge of the game is indeed wonderful. Amongst my
acquaintances there are several wealthy men to whom the tables
are no longer a novelty. A game of cards amuses. I have promised
to arrange something, to play myself, to bring you. We are to
put up nothing and we are to have a third of the winnings."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham sighed.</p>

<p>"Are your friends clever enough to put this through?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"One of them," the Marquis confided, "was a professional
entertainer for some years. His speciality was card tricks. The
other learned the game upon an Atlantic liner."</p>

<p>"It is a primitive form of misappropriation, this," Mr.
Billingham sighed, "but it depends, of course, upon the measure
of skill which your friends possess. Invite them to a rehearsal.
Have you pointed me out to them yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," the Marquis admitted.</p>

<p>"Bring them along to my sitting-room to-night, after dinner,"
Mr. Billingham enjoined. "Introduce me as an American tourist
upon his travels, one of the jay birds with plenty of the dough.
You may say that I only play a low game, but after a few
whiskies and sodas I like to increase the stakes. I'll figure it
out myself then if they're to be trusted."</p>

<p>The Marquis looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>"You will lose your money," he ventured, "and it may not be
possible to explain afterwards."</p>

<p>"Guess I'll fix that," Mr. Billingham promised. "Bring your
friends along and I'll see what's doing."</p>

<p>When he ascended to his sitting-room that evening after
dinner, Mr. Billingham prepared to dispense hospitality on a
generous scale. There were two packs of unopened cards upon a
green baize table, whiskies and sodas and a box of cigars upon
the sideboard, besides a variety of liqueurs.</p>

<p>Presently there was a knock at the door and in response to
Mr. Billingham's hearty invitation to enter there appeared the
Marquis, Madelon, and the Marquis' two friends, whom he
introduced as Mr. Conrad Adler and Mr. Blane T. Hackett of St.
Louis. Mr. Conrad Adler was a trifle Semitic. He wore a black
moustache, curly black hair, and tortoise shell glasses. Mr.
Blane T. Hackett was of a different type&mdash;florid, large,
and more American than Mr. Billingham himself. His hand-shake
was painful, his tone almost vociferous. He eyed the
preparations for the evening's entertainment with approval.</p>

<p>"Our friend, Mr. Adler," the Marquis explained, "is in the
wine trade. He travels a great deal. Mr. Hackett is like
yourself&mdash;an American bent on pleasure."</p>

<p>"And very glad to meet a fellow countryman over on this
side," Mr. Hackett declared cordially. "You still in business,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Only partly," Mr. Billingham confessed. "Linoleum."</p>

<p>"Boots," Mr. Hackett confided&mdash;"the Hackett Boot
Company, out at St. Louis. I guess I'm like you&mdash;get tired
of these foreign games. The sight of a couple of decks of cards
and a few chips looks good to me. Shall we make it a small
game?"</p>

<p>"Fifty francs ante, and a hundred francs rise?" Mr.
Billingham suggested. "Will you join us, Marquis?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," the latter assented. The four men sat down.
Mr. Billingham distributed the chips, and accepted the money. A
waiter, who made an unobtrusive appearance, served drinks and
passed the cigars. The game proceeded and it was very soon
apparent that it was proceeding very contrary to the
expectations of Mr. Conrad Adler and his friend. On one
occasion, when the former had shown, with a half apologetic air,
four eights, having drawn three cards, and Mr. Billingham, with
a quiet chuckle, had laid down four knaves, an explosion
appeared to be imminent. The game was continued, however,
although with the exception of their host the players became
more and more silent. At the end of an hour the whole of the
chips lay in front of Mr. Billingham. That gentleman paused to
light a cigar.</p>

<p>"Seems to me I got all the luck to-night," he remarked. "What
do you say, gentlemen,&mdash;shall we raise the stakes a bit?
The game seems kinder quiet."</p>

<p>Mr. Conrad Adler glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I got to go," he mumbled. "I forgot I had an appointment
over at the Casino."</p>

<p>There was an expression of pain upon Mr. Hackett's face.</p>

<p>"I'll be getting along too," he announced stiffly. "I don't
seem to quite get the hang of this game."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Mr. Billingham ejaculated with ferocious emphasis.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackett opened his mouth and closed it again. His eyes
were fixed upon the pile of counters in front of Mr.
Billingham's place and the little roll of bills underneath his
tumbler.</p>

<p>"Fact of it is," Mr. Hackett confided, "I don't think I know
enough about this game for the present company."</p>

<p>"You'll learn," Mr. Billingham assured him cheerfully. "Any
day that you feel like a little lesson, make the stakes worth
while and I'll show you. Have another cigar before you go."</p>

<p>The two men took their leave, crestfallen, suspicious, and a
little vituperative. The Marquis looked at his friend and
gasped. Madelon came over and patted him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Clever dear!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Say, that was nothing at all," Mr. Billingham assured her
lightly. "Watch me!"</p>

<p>He threw a pack of cards into the air, brought one down from
the ceiling, another from the sleeve of Madelon's dress, and a
third from the back of his collar.</p>

<p>"Just a little lesson for you, Marquis," he said. "Now I'm
going to let you have it straight. Card-sharping don't come
inside our little scheme of life. Do you get that?"</p>

<p>"It really seems," Madelon sighed, "as though with gifts like
yours some profitable use should be made of them."</p>

<p>"My dear," Mr. Billingham protested, "cheating at cards is a
low-down game. We're out for adventures all right, but we're out
to skin the worthless rich and to skin 'em our own way. You take
my advice, Marquis, and don't you be seen speaking to that pair
of crooks again. They'll get found out the first time they try a
serious game with any man who knows his way about."</p>

<p>"But you are so much cleverer than they are," Madelon
expostulated. "Couldn't you get hold of some really terrible
people and win just a little of their money? I saw the most
beautiful chinchilla cape yesterday, and so cheap!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was playing idly with the cards.</p>

<p>"Do you," he asked the Marquis, "happen to know Madame
Groosens?"</p>

<p>The Marquis shivered.</p>

<p>"The good God forbid!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That horrible creature!" Madelon cried. "Every one in the
club and at the Casino, too, hates her. She claims every one's
stakes. She's always trying to bully the croupiers&mdash;an
unspeakable person!"</p>

<p>"She has no friends," Mr. Billingham remarked, "and therefore
to make her acquaintance should be easy. I heard her say that
she preferred bridge and poker to all that gambling. Here is
your task, Marquis. Make her acquaintance and bring her with two
or three absolutely respectable people to a little game of
poker. There shall be no cheating, but something might come of
it."</p>

<p>"It is a horrible task," the Marquis complained, with a
little shiver, "but I must confess that you intrigue me."</p>

<p>"See about it, then," Mr. Billingham enjoined, "and, by the
by, you might remember this. Another ten days at the most sees
our exchequer dry. I do not know what you have saved out of your
share of our little adventures&mdash;you have perhaps added to
them by your roulette wins&mdash;but as a co-operative society
we're on the rocks." The Marquis rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I will take a stroll through the Club," he observed.</p>

<p>"We will follow," Mr. Billingham agreed. "I feel like a
little flutter myself...."</p>

<p>The roulette room of the Club was crowded. Around the louis
table people were standing two and three deep. Madelon touched
Mr. Billingham on the arm. Almost opposite was the woman of whom
they had spoken. They watched her for some moments. She was
short and inclined to be fat, expensively dressed and with a
profusion of jewellery. Her face was heavy and pallid, her mouth
disagreeable, her eyes acquisitive. With her sallow, pendulous
cheeks and occasional glimpses of illshaped teeth, she was
irresistibly reminiscent of a soft and pudgy insect.</p>

<p>"They call her 'the yellow slug,'" Madelon whispered. "Watch
her now."</p>

<p>She stood with a plaque in her hand, as though uncertain
whether or not to risk it. People on either side of her made
their stakes. Still she hesitated. The wheel spun, the number
was announced. There was a plaque placed some time previously,
almost in front of her upon the table. "<i>Un cheval à
moi</i>," she called out shrilly to the croupier.</p>

<p>An Englishwoman seated on the same side of the table
protested.</p>

<p>"Madame is mistaken," she exclaimed indignantly. "The plaque
was mine."</p>

<p>There was the usual controversy. Madame Groosens ejaculated,
shouted, pushed, and finally seized the money. The croupier
looked remorseful. The chef awaited an appeal. The woman to whom
the money belonged shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is not worth while," was her only comment.</p>

<p>"Absolute robbery," Madelon murmured, as Madame Groosens
thrust the plaques into her gold bag and left the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we saw that," he declared....</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I take my hat off to your uncle. Behold!"</p>

<p>The Marquis was offering his commiserations. It was most
annoying to have one's stake claimed. He was glad that Madame
had courage. These people who were not habituees threw down
their plaques right and left and claimed everything.</p>

<p>"Uncle is really doing his best," Madelon whispered.</p>

<p>"He is earning good money," Mr. Billingham assented.</p>

<p>The second poker party in Mr. Billingham's room came off
within the next few evenings. It consisted of Mr. Billingham
himself, the Marquis, Madame Groosens, and two perfectly
respectable acquaintances of the Marquis&mdash;Madame de
Bernande, a well-known resident of Monte Carlo, and Lord
Henerford, whom the Marquis had once met in Paris and who was
also a well-known <i>habitué</i>.</p>

<p>The presence of Madame Groosens appeared to be somewhat of a
surprise, and Madame de Bernande's greeting was cool in the
extreme. The Marquis, however, who figured as host, exerted all
his tact to create a feeling of friendliness. "Seems deuced odd
to be playing poker down here," Lord Henerford remarked. "One
does get rather fed up with these other games, though."</p>

<p>"I play poker at my villa once a week," Madame de Bernande
announced. "Some of you must join me there one evening. I expect
your friend Mr. Billingham plays very well&mdash;most Americans
do."</p>

<p>"Nothing out of the way, madame," Mr. Billingham assured her.
"When I was in business in New York we used to play Saturday
nights at the country club and I played coming across on the
steamer."</p>

<p>"A risky proceeding," Lord Henerford murmured.</p>

<p>"I guess I can generally size people up," Mr. Billingham
declared. "Besides, the gangs who work the steamers are pretty
well-known. I wouldn't say they had much chance&mdash;on the
Southern route, anyway."</p>

<p>The game proceeded without event. The Marquis and Mr.
Billingham were excellent joint hosts and they kept the game
from flagging. Sandwiches and other forms of refreshment were
handed around, and Lord Henerford declared that Mr. Billingham's
cigars were the best he had smoked in Monte Carlo. As the
evening wore on, Mr. Billingham more than once showed signs of
some perturbation. He looked at his cards on several occasions
before he threw them in and he paid marked attention to Madame
Groosens' play. She, to her intense satisfaction, became in time
almost the only winner. A pile of chips and counters was
gathered in front of her, by the side of her gold bag. Her
little eyes twinkled, her covetous mouth was twisted into a
satisfied smile.</p>

<p>Madame de Bernande whispered at last in MadeIon's ear:</p>

<p>"My dear, what induced your uncle to ask that horrible woman
here? She robs every one downstairs and makes life a torment to
the croupiers."</p>

<p>"My uncle is very good-natured," Madelon sighed, "but indeed
she almost invited herself."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was dealing. A very considerable jack-pot had
been opened and it was Madame Groosens' turn to take cards.</p>

<p>"Three," she demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham threw three cards face downwards upon the
table. Madame Groosens apparently discarded three and held out
her hand to draw the three which had been given her. Suddenly,
Madelon, who was standing by the fireplace, dropped a tumbler
with a little crash. Everyone started and looked round. There
was a moment's pause. Then Mr. Billingham's voice rang out,
clear and sharp.</p>

<p>"Madame," he insisted, "don't move! Don't touch your
cards!"</p>

<p>His left hand suddenly imprisoned hers.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, "I regret to say that
Madame Groosens has been cheating. I have been watching her.
This time I am convinced."</p>

<p>The woman was absolutely incapable of speech. She glared at
her accuser with an expression of blank and utter amazement. The
natural venom of her face, however, destroyed its attempted
innocence.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" Mr. Billingham repeated. "I gave you three
cards. Lord Henerford, be so good as to see how many lie in
front of Madame."</p>

<p>"Only two," Lord Henerford declared.</p>

<p>"Now lift her reticule."</p>

<p>Lord Henerford did as he was bidden.</p>

<p>"There is another card there," he said producing it.</p>

<p>"That," Mr. Billingham pointed out, "is the third card. Now
lift that handkerchief which has been lying on the table by her
side all the time."</p>

<p>Lord Henerford obeyed. Underneath the handkerchief another
card was concealed.</p>

<p>"Now, Madame, show your hand," Mr. Billingham ordered.</p>

<p>Madame Groosens, still speechless, did as she was told. She
held a pair of aces. In obedience to a gesture, Lord Henerford
turned up the card under the handkerchief. It was another
ace.</p>

<p>"The trick is a simple one," Mr. Billingham explained. "I've
seen it done on the steamer more than once. I never expected to
see it in company like this. When I gave her three cards, Madame
discarded one, but pushed it with her sleeve under the reticule.
She was helping herself to the one underneath the handkerchief
which had been waiting there for the occasion&mdash;the third
ace. You see? She would have scooped the pool."</p>

<p>Madame Groosens found words at last. Her abuse was violent,
her statements vehement, but both seemed utterly futile.
Everyone listened to her coldly.</p>

<p>"If Madame Groosens had not kept that ace underneath her
handkerchief, if she had not put it there herself, who else
would have been likely to?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham demanded. "Everyone saw me give three cards
upon the table. How did that third card&mdash;the one she wanted
to get rid of&mdash;get underneath her reticule?"</p>

<p>Madame Groosens sprang to her feet and commenced stuffing her
winnings into her bag. The Marquis, however, held her wrist.</p>

<p>"Madame," he insisted, "this is a serious affair. You must
kindly leave that money where it is."</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>"You, ladies and gentlemen," Mr. Billingham added, moving
towards the bell, "are the best judges of what should be done. I
suggest that I send for the manager of the hotel and a
representative of the Casino."</p>

<p>Madame Groosens sat down heavily. She had a sudden and an
awful vision of the joy with which this substantiated charge
against her would be received. She had a vision of life without
Monte Carlo. She shook in every limb.</p>

<p>"It is all a mistake!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Mistakes of such a nature," the Marquis commented, "do not
occur."</p>

<p>"You can take your money," Madame Groosens exclaimed
passionately&mdash;"take it back. I am innocent, but this shall
not be spoken of. You can have your money. I will go!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham walked to the door, locked it and returned
with the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Madame de Bernande," he said, "and you, Lord Henerford, I am
an American and I don't quite know how you treat a case like
this. I guess I'd be glad of some advice."</p>

<p>"The woman should be punished. She should be exposed," Madame
de Bernande declared.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt something should be done," Lord Henerford
assented, helping himself to a whisky and soda.</p>

<p>"But I never touched the cards," Madame Groosens protested
hysterically. "I took what were given to me."</p>

<p>"I guess you may as well cut that out," Mr. Billingham said
shortly. "I am a man who is accustomed to being believed, and I
tell you to your face that I have seen you cheat and so have the
others."</p>

<p>"There is no possible doubt about it," Madame de Bernande
agreed.</p>

<p>Madame Groosens leaned back in the chair, distracted,
vicious, impotent. Mr. Billingham took the pile of notes and
counters and divided them into heaps. He returned to each an
equal portion. "I guess that leaves us pretty well as we were,"
he pointed out. "The next thing for us to decide is what ought
we to do about this lady."</p>

<p>"Do about me?" she gasped. "You've taken my money. You've
lied about me. You've insulted me"</p>

<p>"She is always like this," the Marquis interrupted, with an
apologetic little gesture. "We have had warning enough below
from thev croupiers."</p>

<p>"If you think, madame," Mr. Billingham said sternly, "that
you're going to get out of this scotfree, you're making a big
mistake. I guess you've run up against the wrong crowd this
time. How much you've made by cheating people all your life as
you tried to cheat us to-night, no one can tell, but some of
those dollars you're going to refund. That's a sure thing!"</p>

<p>"This is interesting," the Marquis remarked. "What do you
propose?"</p>

<p>"I propose, ladies and gentlemen," Mr. Billingham continued,
"that we adopt one of two courses.</p>

<p>We either publish an account of what has transpired this
evening socially and to the managers of the Casino and the
Sporting Club, who, I am inclined to believe, would welcome such
information, or we fine Madame a certain sum which shall be
entrusted to one of us for distribution amongst certain approved
charities."</p>

<p>"I," Madame de Bernande said, "am in favour of reporting
Madame to the authorities."</p>

<p>"I, on the other hand," the Marquis intervened, "am not
absolutely certain that that would entirely exclude her from the
use of the Rooms. I am therefore in favour of making her
pay."</p>

<p>"And I, if I have a voice in the matter," Madelon echoed.</p>

<p>"I should make her stump up," Lord Henerford agreed. "Touch
'em through their pockets more readily than in any other
way."</p>

<p>"That goes, then," Mr. Billingham decided. "Madame, on
receipt of a cheque for two thousand pounds, which I shall
devote to certain charities which I have already in my mind, you
may leave this room. If you hesitate for more than twenty
seconds I shall ring the bell and ask for the Manager."</p>

<p>Madame Groosens hesitated for less than twenty. She wrote the
cheque and she left the room, with a venomous backward glance
which few of them ever forgot. The little party broke up soon
afterwards, leaving Mr. Billingham, the Marquis and MadeIon
alone. Mr. Billingham, in an enterprising frame of mind, amused
himself bringing cards from the chimney, from under the carpet,
even fluttering down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"May we ask," Madelon demanded, "to what charities you
propose to devote that little cheque?" Mr. Billingham smiled
blandly.</p>

<p>"Charity," he replied, "begins at home!"</p>

<p>"Is poker really a game of skill?" Madelon asked, as she and
Mr. Billingham paced the Terrace after dinner a few nights
later.</p>

<p>"I shall probably be able to answer that question to-morrow
morning," her companion replied, a little grimly. "I have
promised to make up a game to-night with some of the New York
crowd. I don't much fancy it."</p>

<p>Madelon laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear man," she exclaimed, "you can do what you like
with them!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head a little sadly.</p>

<p>"In a way we are friends," he explained. "They are fellow
club-men. I cannot treat them as I would Mrs. Groosens. So far
as any manipulation of the cards is concerned we meet on equal
terms."</p>

<p>"Then don't gamble," she begged. "Madame Groosens' two
thousand isn't going to last us for ever."</p>

<p>"If I don't gamble," Mr. Billingham objected, "I must lose.
Poker's kind of a queer game that way. The man who sits too
tight at the stakes this crowd play is bound to get it in the
neck."</p>

<p>"Whom are you playing with?" she enquired. Mr. Billingham
inclined his head towards the harbour.</p>

<p>"With Millionaire Frost and his crowd."</p>

<p>"On the yacht?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"I've got to get down there in a few minutes," he confided.
"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to the opera after the first act, to Madame de
Bernande's box. You can leave me at the door as you
pass&mdash;and good luck to you! Remember my chinchilla cape,
and do not bluff!"...</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked for a moment or two almost wistfully
after Madelon's slim form as she passed into the Casino. Then,
with a little sigh, he went on his way down the steps, along the
quay, across the drawbridge, to be received with much respect by
a smart-looking steward and ushered into the saloon of the
famous yacht "The Flying Dutchman." Here four or five men were
still sitting over their wine. The host of the party&mdash;a
thick-set, prosperous-looking New Yorker&mdash;waved his hand
cordially.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Billingham. Take a seat and try my Madeira
before we get to business. Shake hands with Senator
Curtis&mdash;Mr. Billingham. I guess you know the rest of the
crowd."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham accepted the seat, exchanged greetings all
round and drank a glass of wine. They were a typical little
gathering of New Yorkers&mdash;opulent, full of good-nature and
friendliness,&mdash;and when they moved to the smoke-room and
sat down at the poker table everyone was on the best of terms
with himself and his neighbour. Only Mr. Billingham was for a
moment thoughtful. He had paused to glance through the porthole
across the little glittering stretch of water to the flaming
lights of the Casino. He pulled himself together, however, with
barely an effort, at the rattling of the chips.</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars ante, a thousand dollars rise&mdash;how's
that?" the host proposed. "It's steep," Mr. Billingham
commented. "I've seen you play the same game at the Manhattan,"
one of his acquaintances observed. "And anyway it's no use
playing for nuts."</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable to whatever stakes you generally play,
gentlemen," Mr. Billingham acquiesced. "I guess it will take
three of a kind to get me curious."</p>

<p>"You sit tight and you'll win a wad," Millionaire Frost
declared. "We're all fool bluffers here. The Senator's the only
man who understands the game and he loses."</p>

<p>The chips were apportioned, the deal commenced, and the game
proceeded. Mr. Billingham, playing with the utmost care, managed
just to hold his own for the first part of the evening. At
half-past eleven his host glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>"We're an early crowd here, Sam," he said. "Twelve o'clock
sees us through. What do you say to starting a couple of rounds
of jack-pots?"</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable," Mr. Billingham assented readily. "I was kind
of set on seeing the folk out of the Opera, anyway."</p>

<p>A round of jack-pots proceeded with varying fortunes. Mr.
Billingham saw his stock of chips, notwithstanding the utmost
caution, materially reduced, and as each chip represented a
hundred or a thousand dollars according to its colour, the fact
was not without its significance. The last jackpot of the game
Mr. Billingham himself opened. Every one came in and every one
drew three cards, excepting the host, who drew two, and Mr.
Billingham, who took one and started the betting with the
limit&mdash;a thousand dollars. He was seen by every one until
it came to the turn of his host, who raised him a thousand
dollars. Mr. Billingham without hesitation raised the bid
another thousand. The others dropped out. Thenceforward it
became a duel. The betting reached ten thousand dollars.
Millionaire Frost relit his cigar, studied his cards and looked
across at his adversary.</p>

<p>"Say, ain't we wasting our breath like this?" he demanded.
"It stands at ten thousand dollars just now. What about the
doubling game?"</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable," Mr. Billingham replied without
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand dollars, then," Millionaire Frost
proposed.</p>

<p>"Forty thousand," Mr. Billingham rejoined.</p>

<p>There was a little chorus of exclamations and chaff.</p>

<p>"Guess you've run up against something, my lad," Senator
Curtis observed, with a chuckle. "It's a great game, that
doubling game!"</p>

<p>Millionaire Frost studied his cards once more, scratched his
head and hesitated. Finally he threw them down on the table.</p>

<p>"I'm letting you have it, Billingham," he announced. "I
reckon you've got me. In any case I've quit being
inquisitive."</p>

<p>"What did you get, anyway, Frost?" his friend Senator Curtis
enquired.</p>

<p>"Only a pair of kings," was the regretful reply. "I kept a
kicker and threw two, to put him off, but he wasn't having any.
No good seeing him. He drew one card and opened. He must have
opened with two pairs, which had me beat, to start with."</p>

<p>"Say, what had you?" the Senator enquired, turning to Mr.
Billingham.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated for a single moment.</p>

<p>"I'd have you understand," he explained diffidently, "that
this isn't the kind of game I generally play. I picked up the
eight, nine, ten, knave of spades and the knave of hearts. I
opened the jack-pot, pushed the knave of hearts here to show you
my openers," he went on, disclosing it, "and drew for a straight
flush."</p>

<p>"And what did you get?" the other demanded. Mr. Billingham
turned his cards face upwards. He had still the eight, nine,
ten, knave of spades and the two of hearts.</p>

<p>"Bust!" he pointed out.</p>

<p>They all gazed at the cards open-mouthed. There was a roar of
laughter. The Senator leaned across and patted Mr. Billingham on
the back.</p>

<p>"You've put one over on the old man," he declared. "Say,
Frost, what about it?"</p>

<br>

<p>Millionaire Frost laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"A fine bit of play," he pronounced. "We'll have a bottle and
a sandwich and drink your health, Mr. Billingham!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was just in time to meet MadeIon as she came
out of the Opera. She had said good-bye to Madame de Bernande,
and she welcomed him with a smile of pleasure.</p>

<p>"I knew Uncle wouldn't be here, although he promised," she
said.</p>

<p>"I hurried round," Mr. Billingham confided, "to see how you
felt about a bite of supper."</p>

<p>"I should love it," she declared. "But tell me first,
please&mdash;you didn't bluff?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly what you might call bluffing," Mr. Billingham
replied evasively, as he tucked her hand through his arm, and
started across the Square.</p>

<hr>

<br>

<p class="first">THERE was something wrong with Mr. Billingham.
For two days he had shown a marked lack of interest in his food,
his drink, and his gambling. The Spring had laid its relaxing
hand upon the hills and the little Principality; the sun had
gained in strength, the flowers in the gardens were drooping,
there were cracks in the smoothly-shaven lawns, umbrellas at
every table in the Café de Paris, and green verdure in
place of the snows on the lower slopes of the mountains. Men
were wearing flannels and straw hats, and some of the women had
even ventured upon muslins. Mr. Billingham, however, seemed slow
in responding to these genial signs of the advancing season. For
several days he had shown a tendency almost to mope. The climax
came when, at half an hour before his usual luncheon-time, he
complained of his cocktail at Ciro's.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais comment, Monsieur?</i>" the bartender exclaimed. "It
is as I have always mixed it day by day for months."</p>

<p>"It tasted flat," Mr. Billingham pronounced
&mdash;"Flat!"</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. The bartender withdrew
with a pained look. The Marquis stared first at his friend's
frosted glass, then at Mr. Billingham himself.</p>

<p>"My friend," he declared, "it is perhaps the liver. The
cocktail is as always. The moment you enter the place Charles
braces himself. You have even those much to be treasured drops
of absinthe at your disposal."</p>

<p>"It didn't taste good," Mr. Billingham insisted doggedly.</p>

<p>"We will try another," the Marquis suggested.</p>

<p>"Charles! In case there should have been any slight
discrepancy in the mixing, in case your elbow should have shaken
with the angostura, your special attention, if you please."</p>

<p>Charles had scarcely recovered from his hurt, but he obeyed
orders. He shook the cocktails himself in front of the two men
and poured them out, waiting for the verdict. Mr. Billingham
felt that he had perhaps been a little unreasonable.</p>

<p>"I guess the cocktail was all right, Charles," he admitted.
"It's myself that's out of sorts." Charles accepted the amende
and withdrew. Mr. Billingham leaned forward and gripped his
companion by the arm. His eyes were fixed upon two approaching
figures.</p>

<p>"Say, Marquis," he demanded, "who the devil's the young man
with Madelon?"</p>

<br>

"Say, Marquis," Mr. Billingham demanded,<br>
"who the devil's the young man with Madelon?"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>The Marquis adjusted his eyeglass and stared at the
newcomers. Madelon was wearing a ravishing little gown of
lemon-coloured linen, with an adorable little hat. Her companion
was a tall, thin young Englishman in grey tweeds, who walked very
slowly with the help of a stick.</p>

<p>"That is Captain Bruntingford," the Marquis answered.
"Madelon introduced me to him last night."</p>

<p>"Know anything about him?" Mr. Billingham enquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," was the candid reply.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Madelon does, apparently, to judge from the way
she's been going round with him the last few days," Mr.
Billingham grunted.</p>

<p>The Marquis suddenly understood the cause of his friend's low
spirits. Internally he amused himself; externally he remained
placid.</p>

<p>"Madelon has, perhaps, an eye to business," her uncle
remarked under his breath. "She is scarcely likely to find any
other interest in the young man. Be careful! They arrive!"</p>

<p>Madelon entered the little glass-enclosed room with the
sunshine streaming through the windows, her eyes laughing, her
step light and buoyant. She kissed her hand to Mr. Billingham,
installed her companion in a chair and placed his stick by his
side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Billingham," she said, "let me introduce you in the best
American fashion. Shake hands, if you please, with Captain
Bruntingford, late of the British Army. Uncle, you have met
Captain Bruntingford. Mr. Billingham, will you order us some of
those cocktails with a little froth at the top&mdash;or," she
added, turning to the young man&mdash;"I'd like a dry Martini,
if I may," he begged.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham gave the necessary orders. The little party
joined forces. Mr. Billingham was prompt in extending an
invitation to luncheon, but Madelon shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am lunching with Captain Bruntingford," she answered. "He
would be quite polite if we turned it into a partie carree, but
he would be very cross with me afterwards. Englishmen need so
much humouring."</p>

<p>"Americans can get the needle sometimes," Mr. Billingham
reminded her.</p>

<p>"Not wise Americans," she replied&mdash;"not really good and
kind Americans, who like their friends to be happy and who trust
them. Besides, Captain Bruntingford and I have serious matters
to discuss."</p>

<p>The cocktails were drunk and approved. Madelon helped her
companion out of his chair, gave him his stick, and they
departed. Mr. Billingham stared after them gloomily.</p>

<p>"Who the devil is this fellow Bruntingford?" he asked
again.</p>

<p>"I expect Madelon will tell you presently," her uncle replied
cautiously. "I know nothing about him myself. At the same
time"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I do not fancy that Madelon is only amusing herself. She
has, what you call, the eye to business, as we, too, upon
occasion."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham found the suggestion consoling. He was able,
even, to find some slight interest in his luncheon. Afterwards
Madelon unexpectedly joined them. They had the corner table on
the terrace and she accepted a chair and some coffee. An older
woman might have found the streaming sunshine disconcerting, but
the faint violet lines under Madelon's eye9&mdash;perhaps a
little more readily visible in the flood of light&mdash;were,
owing to the freshness of her complexion, only intriguing.</p>

<p>"Tell us, my dear," the Marquis invited, "more of your
friend, Captain Bruntingford."</p>

<p>Madelon shut her vanity case with a click.</p>

<p>"I like the type," she said, "and he orders the right sort of
things to eat. He has just the right tone, too, with head-waiters.
In short, I find him quite an agreeable companion."</p>

<p>"Is this sufficient," the Marquis ventured, "to account for
the enthusiasm with which you have accepted his recent
invitations?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not altogether," she conceded. "You see, he was
wounded in nineteen-fourteen, and afterwards he was attached to
the Intelligence Department of the British Army. His section
seems to have been broken up since the war and he has gone into
partnership with a firm of private detectives."</p>

<p>The Marquis tapped a cigarette upon the tablecloth.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he murmured.</p>

<p>"That sounds kind of interesting," Mr. Billingham
observed.</p>

<p>"He is out here," she continued, "on some sort of business
for his firm. That is exactly as much as he has confided in me.
I am beginning to believe," she went on, with a sigh, "that it
is as much as he means to tell me. And I am just a little
curious."</p>

<p>Madelon paused for a moment. She was gazing out of the window
through the dark green of the gardens, towards the stucco front
of the Casino.</p>

<p>"Every afternoon," she proceeded, "he drives himself in a
little two-seated car towards La Turbie; always in the same
direction, always about the same hour. Another thing about that
expedition rather interests me, too. Always, before he starts,
he feels in his pocket to be sure that his revolver is
there."</p>

<p>"But how observant!" the Marquis murmured. Madelon shrugged
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"The sort of grey tweed lounge suit which he wears," she
said, "is not made for carrying things in its pockets if you
wish to conceal their shapes. Then, there is one other somewhat
singular circumstance. Although he is liberal with his
invitations to me for luncheons, dinners, and suppers, he has
never once asked me to accompany him in that afternoon
drive."</p>

<p>The Marquis smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"A little piqued!" he commented.</p>

<p>"Possibly," Madelon assented. "In any case it has occurred to
me that it was my turn to bring something into the bag."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smoked serenely. He was feeling a little more
content with life.</p>

<p>"There may not be room for us to butt in," he remarked. "He
may be just collecting evidence in some divorce case. These
detective agencies don't as a rule handle the big jobs."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am intrigued," Madelon persisted. "There is
much about Captain Bruntingford that interests me. Sometimes in
the middle of a dinner or a luncheon I have seen a shadow pass
over his face, and a light in his eyes as though there were
something near which he feared. I have seen him start when
someone has nearly run into us at a corner. I am sure that he is
a brave man, yet I am sure that he has been living in fear."</p>

<p>"The remains of shell-shock, perhaps," Mr. Billingham
speculated. "Has he taken that little red car out this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>Madelon nodded.</p>

<p>"He has taken it out and gone just the same way&mdash;upon
the route the cars take for La Turbie."</p>

<p>"It's a fine afternoon," Mr. Billingham said. "I'll hire an
automobile and treat you to a spin. We'll go up to the Golf Club
to tea."</p>

<p>Madelon hesitated, but it was obvious that the idea attracted
her.</p>

<p>"I should love to come," she admitted. "Only, if we do happen
to meet Captain Bruntingford in his red car, I hope he will not
think that we are following him."</p>

<p>"It's an open road," Mr. Billingham reminded her, "and there
are plenty of others upon it. We'll get a move on right away and
see the sunset from the top."</p>

<p>The little party started within a quarter of an hour. They
never reached La Turbie. About halfway up the narrow road which
leads into the upper Corniche, just after negotiating a very
awkward bend, they came upon an all too common sight in this
region of mountainous roads and reckless driving. A little crowd
of people were gathered on the edge of the precipitous slope.
The remains of a small car lay upside-down, partially concealed
by a huge volume of smoke and steam and with little flames
bursting from the petrol tank. A few yards away something was
stretched upon the ground, covered by a mackintosh sheet. Mr.
Billingham touched the driver upon the arm, and by his
directions the automobile was brought to an abrupt
standstill.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't come on, Miss Madelon," he advised. "Let the
chauffeur back with you to the corner. The Marquis and I will
see if there is anything to be done."</p>

<p>Madelon was looking straight ahead of her. The colour had
left her cheeks, but her voice was quite steady.</p>

<p>"The little red car!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"I thought it might be," he assented. "I'm afraid by the way
they've covered the body up there isn't much left of poor
Captain Bruntingford."</p>

<p>Madelon half closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"I think perhaps you are right," she murmured. "Please come
back to me soon."</p>

<p>The car was reversed slowly to the corner and left in a safe
place. From below a large police motor van came tearing up the
hill, and from above a doctor's automobile from La Turbie was
winding its way to the scene of the disaster. Mr. Billingham and
the Marquis joined the little crowd of people. No one seemed to
know much of what had happened. The car had struck the low grey
stone wall at the side of the road and turned over. The driver
was apparently quite dead; his neck must have been broken.</p>

<p>"Better let me see," Mr. Billingham suggested. "I'm not a
medical man, but I did a little amateur surgery in the war."</p>

<p>They made way for him and he lifted the waterproof cover.
When, a few moments later, he rose from his knees, most of his
healthy colour had departed. The doctor from above and a police
commissaire from below arrived almost together. Mr. Billingham
took the Marquis by the arm and led him a little way down the
hill. They could see the marks of the car, could see where it
had apparently skidded and over-turned. About twenty or thirty
paces further on was a small villa, enclosed by a high wall of
white plaster. Mr. Billingham looked at it speculatively. Then
he looked back at the little group, at the police commissaire
and the doctor, both bending over the prostrate form. An
ambulance which had followed the police car was now drawn
up.</p>

<p>"Guess there's nothing else we can do," Mr. Billingham said.
"We'll get back to Miss Madelon." They returned, Mr. Billingham
thoughtful and curiously silent. The Marquis answered the
enquiry in his niece's eyes with a grave little nod. "A very
serious affair, I am afraid, my dear," he told her kindly. "The
car seems to have struck the wall, skidded, and over-turned.
Poor fellow! He is quite dead."</p>

Mr. Billingham looked at the doctor bending over the prostrate

"Guess there's nothing else we can do," he said. "We'll get back
to Miss Madelon."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"How terrible!" Madelon murmured. "And how strange," she
added, a moment later. "I saw him drive once or twice and I
thought he was especially skilful. The roads are not slippery.
Why should he skid?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham came back from his brown study.</p>

<p>"I should say," he remarked, "that it was not exactly a skid.
He lost control of the machine."</p>

<p>"But why?" Madelon demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham pointed to the little pink villa behind the
high, plastered wall.</p>

<p>"Because the poor fellow was shot&mdash;probably from that
villa&mdash;on his way up the hill," he announced gravely.
"Naturally he lost control of the car and over it went. As a
matter of fact his neck was broken as well."</p>

<p>"You mean that he was murdered?" Madelon gasped.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest doubt about it," Mr. Billingham replied.
"He was shot well on the left-hand side, and there seems to be
no cover anywhere near except from that villa. I heard one of
the labourers say that they heard the report of a tyre-burst. As
a matter of fact it must have been the report of the rifle."</p>

<p>"Did you tell the commissaire?" Madelon asked, as they
started off on their homeward journey. Mr. Billingham shook his
head.</p>

<p>"He didn't need any telling," he replied. "Neither he nor the
doctor can make any mistake about that. What I am curious
about," he went on, "is just this. There's a heap of talk about
the way accidents and sudden deaths and motor catastrophes are
hushed up in this part of the world. Now we shall be able to
judge for ourselves."</p>

<p>A few days later the very suave functionary who presided over
the lives and liberties of the Monegasques received a call from
Mr. Billingham. He welcomed him with cordiality.</p>

<p>"Official or unofficial?" was his first question. Mr.
Billingham considered the matter.</p>

<p>"Because," the other continued, "officially I can be dumb;
unofficially I am able to remember that we are good friends,
that you have done us services, that you are not one of these
people who go about making trouble unnecessarily."</p>

<p>"My visit is unofficial," Mr. Billingham announced. "I came
to ask whether you have formed any conclusions as to how that
poor fellow came by his death&mdash;the fellow in the little red
motorcar."</p>

<p>The police functionary shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Our roads are dangerous to those not accustomed to them," he
declared.</p>

<p>"No one," Mr. Billingham retorted, "can drive a car
successfully with a bullet wound in his heart."</p>

<p>The functionary stroked his chin.</p>

<p>"You noticed that, too?" he observed.</p>

<p>"I did," Mr. Billingham replied. "I also noticed that the
only very brief report of the accident described it as being due
to a skid and Captain Bruntingford's death due to a broken
neck."</p>

<p>"His neck certainly was broken," the other remarked&mdash;"a
sufficient cause of death, I think."</p>

<p>"Have you no curiosity," Mr. Billingham enquired, "as to the
bullet wound?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"We are never curious here about these things," he observed.
"Besides, what good purpose is served by destroying what is
after all an amiable fiction? It is better for the world to
believe that this young man died of a broken neck through a
motor accident than that he shot himself."</p>

<p>"Shot himself?" Mr. Billingham murmured. "Ah!... By the
by, was the weapon found?"</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge," the police functionary admitted. "To
tell you the truth, I sent two men up to search, but they were
unsuccessful. There were a good many men at work in the fields
and on the roads, and I am afraid that anything in the way of
firearms is looked upon as a rather desirable acquisition
amongst these people."</p>

<p>"I follow you," Mr. Billingham murmured. "You know that I am
not a chatterbox. For the moment, nothing more! Oblige me with
one piece of information."</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>"I should like the dossiers of the inmates of the little
villa&mdash;'Les Mimosas' it is called&mdash;quite close to
where the young man met with his accident."</p>

<p>The police functionary looked across at his visitor
keenly.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"An idea," he replied.</p>

<p>"They shall be at your hotel within two hours," the other
promised. "In the meantime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are of one mind," Mr. Billingham declared. "The young man
must have friends, probably relations. Let it remain at a broken
neck. But be sure I have my dossiers. There is one thing more,
too. If any of Captain Bruntingford's business friends should
come over from England, will you ask them to favour me with a
call?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," was the ready response. It was one of the
pleasing practices of Mr. Billingham's cleanly life to perform
certain acrobatic exercises in his bathroom every morning. He
was lying upon his back, pummelling his stomach with both fists
and indulging at the same time in deep breathing, when a knock
at the door, the next morning, disturbed his praiseworthy
efforts at maintaining his physical condition.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded, sitting up.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, sir," was the floor-waiter's
reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman into the salon," he directed, "and leave
his card on my tea-tray." The footsteps outside passed along.
Mr. Billingham abandoned further attempts to reduce his girth
and jumped into his bath. Five minutes later, with tousled hair
and glowing face, he picked up the card which reposed upon his
tray.</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">MR. JAMES H. BERRY.</p>

<p>And underneath, in small type&mdash;</p>

<p class="sign"><small>BERRY AND BRUNTINGFORD, PRIVATE INQUIRY
AGENCY.</small></p>

<br>

<p>Mr. Billingham poured himself out a cup of tea and, with it
in his hand, passed through to his salon. A small man, with
sandy hair and an indifferent complexion, wearing gold-rimmed
spectacles and obviously of furtive habits, rose to his feet as
he entered.</p>

<p>"Mr. Billingham, sir," he said, "I fear that I have disturbed
you too early."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," was the cheerful reply. "We get up a
trifle late here. Monte Carlo isn't New York, or London either
for that matter. Glad to see you, sir."</p>

<p>He shook hands and waved his visitor to a chair. "You are
Captain Bruntingford's partner, I gather," he went on. "Terrible
affair! What was the game out here, eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Berry felt his breath being taken away. He removed his
spectacles and polished them.</p>

<p>"I am very much disturbed, Mr. Billingham," he confided. "The
news of this accident to Captain Bruntingford was a great
shock."</p>

<p>"Accident?" Mr. Billingham repeated.</p>

<p>His visitor nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"He was, I understand, killed in a motor accident."</p>

<p>"I guess not," Mr. Billingham objected. "He was
murdered."</p>

<p>The little man jumped almost out of his chair. Then he leaned
forward and looked at Mr. Billingham, his hands gripping its
sides.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I surely do," Mr. Billingham replied. "He was shot through
the heart. That's how the motor accident happened."</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it that Mr. Berry was not only taken
by surprise but that he was deeply moved. He dabbed his forehead
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I told Bruntingford," he declared, "that it wasn't our class
of business. Too risky and not enough to it! He wouldn't listen
to reason. Murdered! Good God! They didn't tell me this at the
police station."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't," was the curt rejoinder. "Murders and
suicides never happen in Monte Carlo&mdash;just accidents,
that's all!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" Mr. Berry exclaimed helplessly. "To think
they'd go as far as that!"</p>

<p>"Who's 'they'?" Mr. Billingham, demanded.</p>

<p>His visitor shivered.</p>

<p>"How much do you know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Mr. Billingham confessed.</p>

<p>"Where do you come in, then?" the other enquired, a little
puzzled.</p>

<p>"I don't come in," Mr. Billingham admitted. "I want to. I
should like to take on Bruntingford's job&mdash;whatever it was.
That is, unless you're going to take it on yourself?"</p>

<p>Mr. Berry dabbed his forehead again.</p>

<p>"Take it on myself!" he repeated. "I'd sooner starve first.
It ain't my idea of pleasant business, sir, and that's a
fact."</p>

<p>"No?" Mr. Billingham murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Give me the makings of a divorce case, or the chance of
collecting evidence in a slander job, or even a bit of
blackmail, and I'm on the spot," Mr. Berry continued. "When it
comes to these big things with desperate people up against
one&mdash;well, all I say is 'take the job somewhere else.'
It's what I told Bruntingford, only he wasn't having any. He'd
got used to these tough affairs in the Army."</p>

<p>"Put me wise about this," Mr. Billingham begged. "I'm
interested."</p>

<p>Mr. Berry cleared his throat. Somehow or other this powerful
pink-and-white-looking man, in his bath robe, still glowing from
his exercises, inspired him with confidence. He accepted a
cigarette, and Mr. Billingham, after a moment's departure from
the room, returned with another cup of tea, helped himself to a
cigar, and, crossing his legs, settled down in an easy-chair,
with a liberal display of underclothes.</p>

<p>"Bruntingford was after forty thousand pounds," Mr. Berry
explained. "I never believed he'd get it, and he didn't. He got
something else instead and it's my belief that the next person
who goes after that forty thousand will get his the same
way."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Mr. Billingham enquired. "Stolen money?"</p>

<p>"Blood-money!" was the hushed reply.</p>

<p>"You've got me guessing," Mr. Billingham confessed.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"What kind of blood-money?"</p>

<p>Mr. Berry hitched his chair a little closer.</p>

<p>"The Johnny who first came to see Bruntingford," he confided,
"was one of them foreign Jews, and he was marked down for
trouble right enough. Never came except after dusk, and he was
scared stiff if ever there was a footstep on the stairs. Got a
cough, he had, too, enough to split him open. I didn't
understand a word of their lingo. Bruntingford had to tell me
afterwards. It seems the little chap was a Russian&mdash;had
been in the police, and got into trouble. He bolted from Russia
and brought some of the papers from headquarters with him. It
was through these he got on to the game. The Russian Government,
if there is such a thing, wants that chap Kitilsky who ran
things there for a bit after they wiped the Tsar out. He escaped
when the Bolshevists took hold, but he's alive still and they
want him."</p>

<p>"Why?" Mr. Billingham demanded.</p>

<p>"Got some papers, for one thing," Mr. Berry confided, "and
they believe he knows where there's some stolen gold hidden.
Anyhow, they want him bad. Ten thousand pounds reward they
offered. The little chap, just before he hopped it, got on to
the lay. He reckoned Kitilsky was living at a villa somewhere
back of Monte Carlo. He daren't leave London himself, though,
and daren't claim the reward. He wanted Bruntingford to take
hold and see what arrangement he could make. He found most of
the money and Bruntingford came out here. Looks as though he had
discovered his man if your story's the truth."</p>

<p>"I guess that's so."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Mr. Billingham proffered a
cigar, which was promptly accepted.</p>

<p>"You going on with this show?" the latter enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Berry hesitated. There was a cunning gleam in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm none too keen," he confessed. "I'd rather sell my
share."</p>

<p>"Your share?"</p>

<p>"The reward."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled.</p>

<p>"You mean you'd like to get home with a sound skin."</p>

<p>"I was never one of the fighting sort," Mr. Berry admitted
apologetically.</p>

<p>"I tell you what I'll do," Mr. Billingham suggested. "I'll
look into this matter. I-can't say I've got properly the hang of
it yet, but I'd kinder like to say a word or two to some one in
that villa."</p>

<p>"You're tackling it yourself?" Mr. Berry asked, with a
shiver.</p>

<p>"I guess so," Mr. Billingham admitted. "I don't know as I see
clearly as to the financial side of it yet, but I'll give you a
third of anything I pick up."</p>

<p>"It's a go!" was the eager reply. "I'll stay here for a few
days on the chance."</p>

<p>Mr. Berry brought his visit to a close. He looked around the
room wonderingly.</p>

<p>"What are you taking this on for?" he demanded. "You seem to
have plenty of the stuff already&mdash;living here like a
prince!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled.</p>

<p>"Appearances are sometimes deceptive," he confided, as he
showed his guest out. "Besides, there is always the
adventure!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, later in the morning, drove up to the Villa
des Mimosas in a closed car which he had hired in the Casino
Square. He passed the crumpled-up remains of the little red
automobile, and descended in a few moments before a huge
nailstudded door let into the plastered wall. He pushed down the
iron handle with a jerk, but found, as he had expected, that it
was fastened on the other side. Rather to his surprise, however,
after scarcely a moment's delay a little click was heard and the
door was released by means of a catch from within. He stepped
into a narrow stretch of garden; uncared for and overgrown with
weeds. The front door of the villa had been opened and upon the
threshold a woman was standing. Mr. Billingham recognised her at
once as an habituee of the Casino&mdash;a florid-looking woman
with too much flesh, too much jewellery, ill-powdered and
besmeared with rouge. She was untidily dressed. Her hair was
tousled. There was a hole in her black felt slippers. After the
somewhat tense sensations of his impending arrival, Mr.
Billingham was conscious of a curious sense of something
inadequate in the situation. His surprise was increased when the
woman addressed him in English.</p>

<p>"Are you the English doctor?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"American," Mr. Billingham replied, with ready presence of
mind.</p>

<p>"The same thing," she muttered. "Come in."</p>

<p>She closed the door carefully behind him. Mr. Billingham
caught a glimpse of an unkempt-looking man securing the outside
gate. The hall of the villa was dirty, ill-kept, and almost
devoid of furniture.</p>

<p>The woman paused there. She spoke in a hoarse, husky
whisper.</p>

<p>"I don't know that you can do anything," she said. "It's
about all up. He wouldn't have a doctor before, though. The only
chance is you might be able to keep him going for a week or
two."</p>

<p>"Let me see him," Mr. Billingham enjoined.</p>

<p>She opened one of the doors which led out of the hall. Mr.
Billingham found himself in what might have once been the salon
of the villa, but was now a nondescript apartment, containing
only a few oddments of furniture, heavy with cigarette smoke,
malodorous from the closed windows and reminiscences of past
meals. Although it was a brilliantly sunny morning, a pair of
shabby curtains were completely drawn&mdash;the light in the
room was so dim, indeed, that Mr. Billingham nearly blinked.
There was heat coming somewhere from a closed stove, and
stretched upon a sofa by its side was the emaciated figure of a
man wrapped in a dressing-gown. His throat was so skinny that
its cords seemed to stand out almost singly. His deep sunken
eyes were unnaturally large, brilliant with an uncanny light.
His white face was disfigured by many days' growth of black and
stubbly beard, his fingers were yellow with the stain of
nicotine. By the side of his couch was a small table and a
miniature roulette board. Close to it was the seat from which
the woman had risen. By the side of the roulette board was a
strip of paper and a pencil.</p>

<p>The man spoke to the woman in a language of which Mr.
Billingham knew nothing, and pointed to her seat. She replied
soothingly. He shook his head and broke out once more. Then he
coughed. She leaned over and patted his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You had better wait for a moment," she said, turning to Mr.
Billingham. "Every day we do this," she went on, pointing to the
board. "We spin twenty numbers. I take the results down and go
to the Casino and back the same numbers in the same order. It is
the only thing which distracts his thoughts since he cannot go
himself. We have finished seventeen. Will you wait?"</p>

<p>"I will wait," Mr. Billingham agreed.</p>

<p>The woman resumed her seat, threw in the ball and turned the
wheel. The man leaned over, watching it eagerly. He took note of
the number with a little air of satisfaction and muttered
something, whilst the woman scribbled it down in pencil upon her
list. Twice more the operation was repeated. Then the man leaned
back. He spoke a few faint words; apparently in Russian. The
woman appeared to assent and he closed his eyes. She drew Mr.
Billingham a little on one side.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>"He wants me to hurry off to the Casino," she explained. "He
says if I do so he will let you examine him."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham opened his mouth and closed it again. There
were tears streaming down the woman's terrible face; a sob
choked in her throat.</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;" Mr. Billingham began.</p>

<p>He stopped short. The door was opened. A man stood there;
corpulent, unprepossessing. He wore only a pair of black
trousers and a flannel shirt. He was the man who had closed the
gate. He spoke to the woman; again in that incomprehensible
jargon. She listened and turned towards Mr. Billingham. Her face
was hardened, her tone was suspicious.</p>

<p>"There is a man here who says that he is the doctor," she
announced.</p>

<p>"He is probably right," Mr. Billingham admitted.</p>

<p>"Who are you, then?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I came to see who fired the shot from this villa which
killed Bruntingford," Mr. Billingham declared, keeping his hand
near his hip-pocket and his eyes wandering from the woman to the
man. The woman's face had been terrible before, but something of
real fury gave it for a moment almost a diabolical expression.
Her lips were parted. She remained, however, unexpectedly
silent. There was a moan&mdash;a low moan but ending in a still
more terrible sound&mdash;from the man upon the couch.</p>

<p>"The doctor!" Mr. Billingham exclaimed.</p>

<p>She called out something to the servitor. A little dark man
with a black bag entered. She pointed to the couch.</p>

<p>"Go out and wait," she ordered Mr. Billingham.</p>

<p>He went into the dirty hall and sat upon a crazy cane chair.
The atmosphere of the place stifled him. Presently he withdrew
the bolts from the big door and found his way out into the
tangled wilderness of garden which still remained beautiful. He
wiped the perspiration from his forehead and waited. It was
probably half an hour before anything happened. Then the woman
came out. She advanced slowly towards him, and Mr. Billingham
&mdash;who had seldom known fear&mdash;was conscious of a
strange new sensation in his veins; a feeling that the sun had
passed from the heavens and that there was sulphur in the
air.</p>

<p>"You came to find out who fired that shot," she said. "I
did."</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"That he should end his days a free man," was the solemn
answer. "That has arrived. Are you of the police? I am
ready!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"The police do not know," he assured her hoarsely. "What
about him?"</p>

<p>"He is dead," she announced. "He died&mdash;just then."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham twirled his hat in his hand. It was so sordid,
incomprehensible, amazingly unreal. Through a little clump of
olive trees, he saw that the gate remained open.</p>

<p>"My affair here is finished," he said. "I will go." She
nodded.</p>

<p>"Go!" she assented.... "You are fortunate," she added, a
moment or two later, "that you did noti come a few days ago with
your question."</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that there was a great reward for
information about him?"</p>

<p>"I have known it for years," she admitted. "Nevertheless I
kept him hidden. We had always two foes to fight&mdash;spies and
starvation."</p>

<p>"And now about yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p>She stared at him. Another button of her dress had given way.
She seemed more ragged than ever.</p>

<p>"Myself!" she repeated. "What does it matter? He is
dead!"</p>

<h3>First published in <i>Collier's Weekly</i>, 6 Jun 1925</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">MR. BILLINGHAM, attracted always by the
unusual, paused in his early morning stroll through the clean
streets, the flower-bedecked squares and along the glorious
Terrace of Monte Carlo, to regard with some surprise the
extraordinary spectacle of a man seated before one of the tables
outside the Café de Paris fast asleep. The place was
almost deserted, save for the sprinkling of visitors who came to
take their early morning dejeuners in the sunshine, and Ben
Hassim, the swarthy vendor of carpets, who stood patiently in
the background, taking apparently no interest whatever in his
immediate surroundings, yet with a curious air of watchfulness
in his attitude and shining out of his black eyes. The young man
who had attracted Mr. Billingham's attention was seated at one
of the tables a little removed from the others and was sleeping
peacefully and apparently naturally. It was obvious to an
<i>habitué</i> of the place, however, that so unusual a
proceeding would before long evoke interference from the
authorities. A waiter had already called the attention of a
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> to his presence; a gendarme
from the Square had halted in his promenade and seemed to be
contemplating action. Mr. Billingham approached, leaned over the
sleeping man, sniffed the air for a moment and became
immediately interested. He summoned the <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

<p>"How long has he been here?" he enquired, indicating the
recumbent figure.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
"How long has he been here?" Mr. Billingham<br>
enquired, indicating the recumbent figure.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Since the place was opened, Monsieur," the man replied. "It
seems probable that he spent a great portion of the night here.
It is time he moved on."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham produced a twenty-franc note.</p>

<p>"Will you let him remain for ten minutes longer?" he begged.
"I shall return by then. I am going to the chemist's. The young
man is suffering from the effects of some drug."</p>

<p>The twenty-franc note resulted in the usual miracle, and on
Mr. Billingham's return, in less than the time he had stated, he
found the object of his solicitude still asleep. He poured a
little powder into a wineglassful of soda-water and took the
young man firmly by the arm.</p>

<p>"You must wake up," he said.</p>

<p>At the second injunction the sleeper opened his eyes and
stared around him in a dazed fashion. Mr. Billingham thrust the
wineglass into his fingers.</p>

<p>"Drink this," he ordered.</p>

<p>The young man obeyed. Then he blinked several times, stared
around him again, and finally looked hard at Mr. Billingham.</p>

<p>"How did I get here, and who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"How you got here is the question we've all been asking," Mr.
Billingham replied. "As for me, I'm just an American visitor,
staying at the hotel yonder. My name is Billingham."</p>

<p>The young man shook himself. He was a sunburnt, good-looking
fellow and had a soldierly air notwithstanding his crumpled
clothes, somewhat dishevelled appearance, and the fact,
disclosed by the shape of his boots, that one leg was a little
longer than the other.</p>

<p>"Well," he declared, "they got me first time. Drugged and
robbed, I suppose."</p>

<p>He opened his coat and drew out a pocket-book. A considerable
number of mille notes were there, some visiting-cards, and an
odd letter or two.</p>

<p>"They've left you some money, at any rate," Mr. Billingham
observed.</p>

<p>The young man returned the case to his pocket.</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented. "They haven't touched that. They've taken
the packet, though."</p>

<p>He pressed his disabled foot on to the ground for a moment,
and leaned once more back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Anything valuable?" Mr. Billingham asked. "Do you want to
get in touch with the police? I'm rather close to the chief
here."</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"The packet," he confided, dropping his voice a little, "is
not quite so valuable as the people who stole it imagine. All
the same I think I had better be getting along. They'll be after
me again as soon as they find out."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet a little unsteadily. There was still
rather a drawn look about his face.</p>

<p>"Say, where are you staying?" Mr. Billingham enquired.</p>

<p>"Close by here&mdash;at the Robespierre."</p>

<p>"I'll walk down with you if you like," his rescuer suggested.
"I'm just out to stroll about."</p>

<p>"It would be very kind of you," was the grateful
acknowledgment. "To tell you the truth I'm still feeling a
little giddy."</p>

<p>He picked up his rubber-tipped stick and leaned for a moment
heavily upon it. Ben Hassim, the vendor of carpets, who had
advanced slowly nearer and nearer, salaamed as he accosted them.
His white teeth flashed and his smile was as irresistible as
ever. Nevertheless, there was a gleam of anxiety in his dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"Has the young gentleman been robbed of anything valuable?"
he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why should you think that he had?" Mr. Billingham
rejoined.</p>

<p>Hassim patiently deposited one of the rugs, which was
slipping from his shoulder, upon the back of a chair.</p>

<p>"Because it was I who brought him down here," he confided. "I
found him up in Beausoleil. He was on a chair in front of a
restaurant&mdash;not a good restaurant. I knew that if he stayed
there it would be ill for him. I brought him here. I was waiting
until he awoke."</p>

<p>The young man's hand went towards his pocket, but Hassim's
arresting gesture was full of dignity. "I desire nothing," he
said. "Only I wish to be assured that the gentleman has not been
robbed."</p>

<p>The latter thrust the twenty-franc note back into his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Curiously enough, I have not," he replied. "Something was
taken from my pocket, but it was of no value to anybody.
Anything I had with me," he added, looking intently at Hassim,
"which is of value, I still possess."</p>

<p>Once more Hassim salaamed. He gathered up his rugs and
retreated. They both looked after him curiously.</p>

<p>"That's a quaint fellow," the young man remarked.</p>

<p>"Got something at the back of his mind about you," Mr.
Billingham mused, as they walked slowly off together....</p>

<p>"My name is Powell&mdash;Leonard Powell," the young man
volunteered, after a moment's silence. "I suppose you think that
I've been making a night of it?"</p>

<p>"Kinder looks like it," his companion assented.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't. I'm here on a special errand. I knew I was
being watched and I went up to dine at the quietest place I know
of&mdash;right at the back of the town here. I had half a bottle
of wine and a liqueur brandy. The last thing I remember was
paying my bill."</p>

<p>"Any ladies about?"</p>

<p>"Not a sign of one," was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"Sounds kind of interesting," Mr. Billingham observed, as
they neared the hotel. "Sure you don't want me to get you in
right with the police?"</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"The police couldn't help me," he confided. "If you'd like to
come in and have your morning coffee with me, I'll tell you just
the little more there is to be told."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham accepted with alacrity. They made their way
into the almost deserted salon of the hotel and the young man,
after a few minutes' absence for a wash and a change of linen,
seated himself at the table opposite his guest. His clothes were
well-cut, but a trifle shabby. He was, however, entirely
presentable and Mr. Billingham found his original impressions
confirmed.</p>

<p>"Read that first," Powell enjoined, producing a newspaper
cutting from the <i>Times</i>. "I found it in the personal
column a fortnight ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham adjusted his glasses and read:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">WANTED. Ex-officer or young man of courage,
willing to risk his life in a dangerous enterprise. Adequate
remuneration. No hardship, but real danger. Applicant must
produce unexceptionable references and be unmarried.&mdash;Apply
Box B. 771. The Times, E.C.4.</p>

<br>

<p>"I saw this," Mr. Billingham declared, tapping the cutting
with his forefinger. "I remember wondering at the time whether
it was genuine."</p>

<p>"I should think it is probably genuine enough, judging from
last night," the young man observed. "Anyhow, I answered the
advertisement. I happen to have a few decent medals and a pretty
good record, and I got the job. I was passed through three hands
before I came to the principal. I can't tell you his name, but
he is the head of the greatest financial and exploration company
in the world. The job when I got it seemed almost ludicrously
simple. I was to bring a packet here and deliver it safely to
the person for whom it was intended."</p>

<p>"Sounds pie to me," Mr. Billingham commented. "Why don't you
deliver it and get it off your chest?"</p>

<p>"It isn't quite so simple as that. Even the person who
entrusted me with the commission didn't know exactly who would
come for the packet. They could only tell me how to recognise
him when he did arrive. Meanwhile, as they warned me, there's an
ugly crowd around, who would like, apparently, to nobble me and
get hold of it, whatever it may be."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham for the first time felt inclined to doubt his
companion's bona fides. His story on the face of it was scarcely
convincing.</p>

<p>"Do you know what this mysterious packet of yours contains?"
he enquired.</p>

<p>"Not an idea," the young man confessed. "Do you know what
sort of person you have to look out for?"</p>

<p>"He isn't an ordinary personage," was the somewhat hesitating
reply. "I shall probably know when he is here."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham coughed. The greatest in the world are not
infallible. For once in his life he had arrived at a wrong
decision.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked, as he pushed back his chair and rose, "I
wish you luck. I must be getting along."</p>

<p>The young man walked with him to the door. The air was filled
with soft sunlight and the faintest of southern breezes stirred
the leaves of the trees in the gardens on their left. The hour
was still early and there were few people about. A dark-skinned
denizen of some southern race was reading a newspaper in the
little railed-off space in front of the hotel. Powell glanced
towards him with a frown.</p>

<p>"Another of the brutes!" he muttered. "On guard, I suppose....
 Well, good-morning, sir. Thank you very much for your
help."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, whose interest in the affair had experienced
a slight revival, had a question to ask, but his companion had
already left him. Just before he reached the opposite side of
the way, he turned around, conscious of an unusual noise. An
elderly gentleman of military appearance was knocking the stone
balustrade behind which the solitary occupant of the hotel
piazza was seated&mdash;knocking it with the obvious intention
of attracting the dark-skinned foreigner's notice. Mr. Billing
paused on the pretence of lighting a cigarette. He saw the young
man who had been reading the newspaper rise to his feet and he
heard the exchange of a few sentences in the strangest language
to which he had ever listened. After a moment or two, the
foreigner, with a curious little bow, resumed his seat, and the
elderly gentleman who had accosted him turned towards the
gardens. Mr. Billingham, as he passed, beamed at him
amiably.</p>

<p>"If I'm not taking a liberty, sir," he said, "I should very
much like to know what language that might have been you were
talking just now. Don't seem to me that I've ever heard it
before."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you have, sir," was the not ungracious
reply. "I don't suppose there's another white man in the place
except myself who can speak it. It's the language of a
God-forsaken little country right at the back end of Mesopotamia. I
had a draft of the natives in a regiment I commanded during the
war."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham fell into step with his companion and
signified his interest monosyllabically.</p>

<p>"Gave me quite a start to see that young man seated there in
European clothes," the latter continued. "This place is full, of
course, of AngloIndians, and there are a few Egyptians, but an
Arab of that young man's race very seldom finds his way into
civilisation. Damned fine fellows they are, too, most of
them!"</p>

<p>"Did he explain his presence here?" Mr. Billingham
enquired.</p>

<p>His companion smiled&mdash;a smile with which was associated
a slight grimace.</p>

<p>"He did not," he admitted. "He seemed rather disturbed at my
recognition, but in the politest possible manner he told me to
go to the devil.... I wish you good-morning, sir. I am due at
my barber's."...</p>

<p>The Marquis de Felan, Mr. Billingham's friend and
confederate, was in high spirits that evening. He had won almost
as much in the afternoon on his two favourite numbers as he had
lost the evening before, and he insisted upon paying for the
dinner with the money which he had previously borrowed from his
guest.</p>

<p>"At roulette," he declared didactically, "all that is needed
is confidence. I say to myself 'my numbers will
arrive&mdash;they shall arrive.' I see them arriving and behold
they follow one another. But for the unfortunate closing of the
tables in the Club at eight o'clock I firmly believe that my
winnings this evening would have been enormous."</p>

<p>"You did pretty well as it was, didn't you?" Mr. Billingham
asked.</p>

<p>The Marquis hesitated.</p>

<p>"I was on the point of doing well," he confided. "I had
re-established myself. A little more capital"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Mr. Billingham interrupted, "a little
more capital is what we all need. What about you, Miss
Madelon?"</p>

<p>Madelon opened her purse and disclosed its contents.</p>

<p>"I am, what you call, nearly on the rocks," she admitted. "I
have a hundred-franc note, perhaps two hundred francs' worth of
counters, and a fivehundred-franc note at home in my
stocking."</p>

<p>"At home," the Marquis repeated disconsolately. "I was rather
hoping"</p>

<p>"Quite impossible," Madelon pronounced decisively. "My last
five hundred francs does not go to the tables. Dear chief," she
went on, turning to her neighbour, "the time has arrived for us
to act. Is there nobody here we can rob?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I can think of no one," he confessed, "whom we can rob
safely and honestly."</p>

<p>"One might perhaps draw the line a little less rigidly," the
Marquis suggested, polishing his eyeglass.</p>

<p>"I'm not out to look for trouble," Mr. Billingham grunted.
"No thank you! I guess if you're up a gum tree, Marquis, the
croupiers at the Sporting Club have raked in the bits. I myself
have not touched that whip-up for charity we worked Mrs.
Groosens for. And as for Miss Madelon, you know her
position."</p>

<p>Madelon shrugged her shoulders with a little gesture of
despair. The Marquis hastened to explain.</p>

<p>"A loan, my dear!" he insisted. "I owe you money. I admit it.
All shall be paid. In the nleantime, however, our need for
capital is somewhat urgent. I am delighted to hear that our
friend is in a position to make us a small advance if
necessary."</p>

<p>"Mr. Billingham is in a position to do nothing of the sort,"
Madelon replied. "You have borrowed all my money, Uncle. That
must be enough for you. Think of some way of earning it. We will
all help. We are an amazing trio&mdash;unscrupulous, clever,
brave! We are surrounded by pleasure-seekers and fools. There
must be some means by which they can be induced to add to our
exchequer."</p>

<p>"Guess it's up to you to sound the tocsin, Marquis," Mr.
Billingham declared. "You need the money. We don't happen to,
just at the moment. Do you get me?"</p>

<p>The Marquis coughed.</p>

<p>"In a partnership like ours," he began, "a certain community
of interest as regards&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it out!" Mr. Billingham interrupted brutally. "You've
had your share of everything we've done. You've borrowed from
your niece, you've borrowed from me. If you can't win, quit
it!"</p>

<p>"One needs capital," the Marquis complained. "Besides playing
my numbers I have perfected a system which will infallibly bring
me in a profit as soon as I get it started."</p>

<p>"Sell it to one of my fellow-countrymen," Mr. Billingham
advised. "There are three or four hundred of them landing
to-morrow morning. Three or four hundred Americans plumb full of
the stuff, with fat pocket-books and large letters of
credit!"</p>

<p>The Marquis' eyes glistened wistfully as he toyed with his
eyeglass. Suddenly he arrived at an heroic decision.</p>

<p>"I shall go down to the quay," he announced. "I shall offer
my services as guide. I will compete with the brawny ruffian
from Cooks."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled incredulously. He said nothing, but the
effect of the smile was potent.</p>

<p>"You think that I would not do that?" his <i>vis-à-vis</i>
demanded.</p>

<p>"I'll match you a mille you don't," was the prompt
challenge.</p>

<p>The Marquis hesitated for a moment, gulped and made up his
mind.</p>

<p>"Your wager is accepted," he declared. "The money will be
mine."</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke the siren of the great incoming steamer
rang out its blatant announcement, dwarfing all other noises,
audible from Mentone to Beaulieu. Mr. Billingham smiled once
more.</p>

<p>"Guess you don't need to worry, Marquis," he observed. "No
one will be allowed to land until tomorrow morning. The first
tender-full will arrive in the harbour at about nine o'clock,
with money oozing out of their finger-nails."</p>

<p>"I shall be there," was the other's valiant
pronouncement.</p>

<p>Amongst several hundreds of intrepid Transatlantic sight-seers,
there stepped from the tender on to the dock at Monaco,
the following morning, the illustrious family of the Henry P.
Hootermans of Chicago. The family consisted of Mrs. Henry P.
Hooterman, a short, squat lady with an immense capacity for
speech, pushing in a crowd, and managing her own and everyone
else's affairs. She was of dark complexion, sallow, and she wore
huge tortoise shell spectacles. She carried a jewel case, which
was somewhat ostentatiously chained to her wrist, and in the
other hand an umbrella. She had flat feet which seemed always to
take up a little more than their share of room upon the earth,
and a voice and mien of authority which had won for her the
position of President of the Society of Women Thinkers in her
home city. She was accompanied by her daughter, Mamie, who had
some claim to good looks and whose eyes were certainly dark and
almost beautiful, but whose chances of success in life were
considerably handicapped by the maternal environment. There were
also a younger daughter, Sadie, still in her early teens,
freckled, loquacious and gawky; a lad, who bitterly resented the
whole undertaking; and finally Mr. Henry P. Hooterman himself, a
tall, thin man, sombrely dressed, of pallid complexion, who had
more the appearance of a Methodist minister than the
multi-millionaire he was reputed to be. This estimable quintette
stood upon the landing-stage and looked around them.</p>

<p>"What we need," Mrs. Henry P. Hooterman said firmly, "to give
us points about this place, is a Cook's man. Hi, you!" she
added, lifting her umbrella and addressing an individual in a
gold-laced cap. "Say, are you Cook's or American Express?"</p>

<p>The functionary in question, who happened to be one of the
five officers of the standing army of Monaco and ignorant of any
of the barbarian tongues, turned coldly away. The boy, looking
upwards, espied a familiar sight.</p>

<p>"Say," he exclaimed, "there's a trolley-car up there. I guess
if we can make the road we can have a ride round."</p>

<p>"Anyway," his father decided, "we'll be moving along."</p>

<p>It was at this precise moment that the Marquis, who had been
talking for a moment to the ship's doctor, with whom he had some
slight acquaintance, approached. He raised his hat and addressed
Mrs. Henry P. Hooterman in his own language.</p>

<p>"Madame is perhaps in need of some information?" he
suggested.</p>

<p>They all looked at him blankly; Mamie in frank
admiration.</p>

<p>"Say, ain't they some dressers, Momma!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Isn't he cute!" Sadie echoed.</p>

<p>"Sorry we don't get you," Mr. Hooterman apologised. "We're
Americans."</p>

<p>The Marquis removed his hat once more.</p>

<p>"It is for that reason," he explained in English, "that I
have ventured to address you. It appeared to me that you might
be in need of some information or advice. I am a resident here.
My services are at your disposal."</p>

<p>The little party were at once interested.</p>

<p>"Want to show us round, eh?" Mr. Hooterman ventured
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That would give me great pleasure," the Marquis assented. "I
might add that I only offer my services occasionally. I believe
I have the honour to address Senator Henry P. Hooterman of
Chicago."</p>

<p>So far as the countenance of a man whose skin was rather like
dried-up leather could express emotion, it was obvious that Mr.
Hooterman was pleased. He smiled in wintry fashion.</p>

<p>"You know me," he observed.</p>

<p>"Monte Carlo was apprised of your intended visit," the
Marquis rejoined with trenchant grandiloquence. "It was to meet
you that I am here. I am not, it is true, a professional guide,
but I sometimes occupy that position to people of distinction.
My services are at your disposal for the day for the sum of five
hundred francs."</p>

"My services are at your disposal for the day for<br>

</div>

<br>

<p>"Steep!" Mr. Hooterman commented.</p>

<p>"He talks some!" Mrs. Hooterman agreed.</p>

<p>"I think it would be lovely to be taken round by someone who
really knows the place," Miss Mamie cooed.</p>

<p>"That will include your meals and all gratuities?" Mrs.
Hooterman enquired.</p>

<p>"It will be inclusive," the Marquis promised. "If you decide
to engage me I am at your disposal. Otherwise," he added,
glancing across the quay towards another little group.</p>

<p>"Those horrid Smithsons!" Mamie interrupted. "Dad, fix this
up, please."</p>

<p>"You are engaged," Mr. Hooterman declared. "Lead on. What
shall we do first?"...</p>

<p>Many a time in later days the Marquis' tone shook with
emotion when he spoke of that morning. It is certain that he
carried out his task manfully. He deposited the little company
in an automobile and took them to the Casino. He obtained their
<i>cartes d'entrée</i> in advance of a long line of their
fellow-passengers&mdash;a fact which immensely impressed the
elder members of the family. He explained the game&mdash;to the
details of which they listened with great earnestness&mdash;and
at his suggestion Mr. Hooterman changed a note for a hundred
dollars into counters, which, with the exception of a small
handful which he retained for purposes of instruction, the
Marquis distributed amongst his companions.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "I will show you how the betting is
done."</p>

<p>He placed one of the counters on fourteen and one on
twenty-nine. One which Mamie thrust upon him he placed on "red."
Theyall watched breathlessly. The Marquis gave a little start as the
ball slipped into its place and the croupier's monotonous voice
recited the result.</p>

<p><i>"Quatorze, pair, rouge et manque"</i></p>

<p>The Marquis leaned gallantly across, picked up two louis from
the "rouge" and handed them to Miss Mamie.</p>

<p>"You have won, Mademoiselle," he announced. "So, it appears,
have I."</p>

<p>He accepted thirty-five louis and swept them into his pocket.
Mr. Hooterman watched him, fascinated. Mrs. Hooterman nudged her
husband. Mamie smiled rapturously.</p>

<p>"Say, did you win all that?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I did," the Marquis acquiesced blandly. "By the by, the
original louis belongs to your father. Pray take it and place it
where you will upon the table."</p>

<p>He returned the counter and explained further the system of
staking. Several more ventures were essayed without result.
Then, as it had been necessary to leave the boy and Sadie
outside, they quitted the rooms and embarked upon a personally
conducted drive to La Turbie and Mentone, winding up outside the
Arcade which led to Ciro's. The Marquis, who had been sitting in
front, gallantly helped Mrs. Hooterman and Mamie to alight.</p>

<p>"It is, perhaps, the luncheon hour," he ventured.</p>

<p>"Yes, sirree," Mamie assented enthusiastically and with great
emphasis.</p>

<p>"You spoke a mouthful, Mr. Guide," Henry junior declared.</p>

<p>The Marquis was puzzled, but gathered that his suggestion was
favourably received. They made their way along the Arcade until
they were met by a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> from the
restaurant. The season was waning and they were welcome guests.
The manager himself ushered them to a table upon the
balcony.</p>

<p>"With what can I have the pleasure of serving Monsieur le
Marquis?" he enquired, presenting the bill of fare.</p>

<p>One and all, the little party looked up in amazement. The
Marquis found them strangely acquiescent in the matter of the
luncheon he ordered. They did not even flinch at the idea of
cocktails. As soon as the waiter had departed Mamie leaned
forward.</p>

<p>"Why did that man with the black tie call you 'Marquis'?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"It happens to be the title which belongs to me," the Marquis
explained, dropping his horn-rimmed eyeglass and gazing amiably
around. The luncheon he had ordered consisted, curiously enough,
of all his favourite dishes and he felt at peace with the
world.</p>

<p>"You mean that you are a real Marquis&mdash;a nobleman?"
Mamie persisted.</p>

<p>"My family has been noble for seven hundred years," the
Marquis replied modestly, yet with some dignity. "I am the
eleventh Marquis de Felan and I happen to be also a Count of the
Holy Roman Empire."</p>

<p>"Say, what are you doing in this guide business, anyway?"
Mrs. Hooterman queried, after a moment's awed silence.</p>

<p>The Marquis shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"I am not in the guide business," he declared. "To tell you
the truth I have never before undertaken such an enterprise. I
happen to be temporarily somewhat embarrassed financially and a
friend of mine&mdash;a compatriot of yours, by the by&mdash;bet
me a considerable sum of money that I would not offer my
services to a family from your steamer and show them Monte
Carlo. I took the liberty," he went on, with a little bow
towards Mamie, "of showing some discrimination, and&mdash;well,
<i>nous voilà</i>!"</p>

<p>"Why, did you ever hear anything like this?" Mamie
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" her younger sister murmured.</p>

<p>"Say, don't you wear anything if you're a Marquis?" Henry
junior asked discontentedly.</p>

<p>"I knew he wasn't an ordinary guide," Mrs. Hooterman confided
under her breath to her husband.</p>

<p>"Here, by the by," the Marquis continued, in high good-humour,
"comes the gentleman with whom I made the wager and my
niece. Permit me," he added, as Mr. Billingham and Madelon
paused on their way to a table, "to present my niece and Mr.
Billingham&mdash;Mr. Henry P. Hooterman and family."</p>

<p>Mr. Hooterman held out his hand and gazed earnestly at his
compatriot.</p>

<p>"Linoleum?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You've said it," was the prompt assent.</p>

<p>"Boots," Mr. Hooterman confided.</p>

<p>"I know the plant," Mr. Billingham declared. "The Hooterman,
Steadman Plant, Chicago."</p>

<p>"Sit right down, you and the young lady," Mr. Hooterman
invited. "We've just heard of that wager of yours. Join us in a
bite of luncheon, sir." Places were laid and a curious but
interesting meal was started. Madelon sat between Mamie and her
younger sister and enjoyed herself immensely. Mrs. Hooterman
told the Marquis all about the Women's Guild and how she became
President, and Mr. Billingham discoursed eloquently on financial
subjects. They were perhaps half-way through a very excellent
repast when Ben Hassim, with half a dozen carpets hung from his
shoulders in picturesque fashion, made his smiling and dignified
appearance.</p>

<p>"The gentleman would like to take home to New York something
wonderful&mdash;a carpet fit for a palace?" he enquired,
displaying one of his rugs.</p>

<p>"Say, did you ever!" Mrs. Hooterman exclaimed, gazing hard
through her tortoise shell spectacles. "What sort of a foreigner
might he be, Marquis?"</p>

<p>"Either an Arab or an Egyptian," the Marquis replied. "He
probably comes from somewhere beyond Jaffa."</p>

<p>"He looks quite romantic!" Mamie sighed. "Momma, that's a
beautiful blue rug."</p>

<p>"A thousand francs," Ben Hassim declared, smoothing it
down&mdash;"in your country a thousand dollars. I take it to the
steamer for you." Mrs. Hooterman fell to examining the texture
of the carpet, and Mr. Hooterman began to make facetious
suggestions as to possible reductions in the price. Suddenly
Mamie gave a little exclamation.</p>

<p>"The Prince!" she exclaimed. "Isn't he handsome?"</p>

<p>They all glanced along the terrace. A man, tall, olive-skinned,
with the thin aquiline nose and brilliant eyes of an
Arab, dressed in robes of flowing white, with a white turban and
gold bracelets upon his arms, advanced in leisurely fashion
towards one of the empty tables, followed by a servant. The
vendor of carpets dropped his wares and performed a strange,
genuflectory reverence, to which the other replied only by a
slight upraising of his hand. He passed on to the empty table
and seated himself with the servant behind his chair.</p>

<p>"Say, do you folks know who that is?" Mr. Billingham enquired
with interest.</p>

<p>"He's a Sheik or Prince from somewhere in Mesopotamia," Mamie
declared. "He got on the steamer at Jaffa. They said that he had
flown from Bagdad in an aeroplane which belonged to the British
Government. Isn't he just the most picturesque dear that ever
lived?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded a little absently. There were other
things interesting him just at that moment. In the first place,
Leonard Powell, the Englishman who had been occupying a table in
a distant corner, had risen to his feet and was&lt; gazing
across with eager interest at the object of Mamie's admiration.
Furthermore, the young foreigner who had been seated outside the
Robespierre Hotel earlier in the morning had also made his
appearance in the Arcade accompanied by a smaller, coarser and
more vicious edition of himself. The two had paused, half-way
between the bar and the terrace restaurant, and were talking
together eagerly. Their whole attention also seemed concentrated
upon the Arab Sheik, who never once glanced in their direction....
 Then, too, a change had come over Ben Hassim. He had
dropped his wares and his eyes were fixed in almost terrified
fashion upon the two newcomers. His rugs lay in a little
neglected heap upon the floor. He mumbled to himself in some
strange dialect. Continually he looked backwards and forwards
from the spot where the two had halted to the table where the
Arab Prince was seated. The climax of his disquietude arrived
when the taller of the former, followed by his unprepossessing
companion, began to move forward. Mr. Billingham half
unconsciously rose to his feet. He felt the need of freedom in
case action was required of him, yet of what might be going to
happen he had not the faintest idea. It was Henry junior who
first supplied a hint as to the possible course of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>"Say, isn't that a dandy dagger!" he exclaimed
breathlessly.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's eyes followed the direction of the boy's
eagerly pointing finger. Ben Hassim had retained one of the rugs
upon his arm, and beneath its folds, partially concealed, his
right hand was gripping a long, curved knife of wickedlooking
blue steel, the hilt of which was of beaten silver, set with
precious stones. With the rug still hanging over his arm, he
moved stealthily out until he stood almost as though it were his
purpose to intercept the two Europeanised Arabians.</p>

<p>The manager of the restaurant, conscious of something
unusual, hurried up with an angry exclamation. Ben Hassim took
no notice. His eyes were fixed upon the advancing figures.
Suddenly he began to talk rapidly in French to the manager. The
latter appeared at first bewildered and then incredulous.
Finally he turned away towards the two young foreigners whom the
carpet vendor was indicating now with almost frantic gestures.
He bowed, as though welcoming prospective clients.</p>

<p>"You wish for a table on the terrace, sir?" he enquired.</p>

<p>The foremost of the two young men hesitated. Ben Hassim took
advantage of his pause to creep round the other tables and
emerge upon the Arcade with one rug still hanging over his arm,
effectually concealing the knife which only Henry junior and Mr.
Billingham had seen. He stood between the table where the Prince
was seated and the civilised parody of himself, about whose
deliberate approach there had been indeed something almost
sinister. The latter, checked in his advance by the manager, was
led reluctantly to a table. Ben Hassim turned and with head
respectfully bowed commenced to talk to the Prince&mdash;to talk
in a strange language with many gestures and brandishing of the
arms, almost with tears in his eyes.</p>

<br>

language.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>The Prince listened without movement, without any sign of
hearing. In the end, however, he rose to his feet, and, screened
still by the carpet vendor, turned and entered the indoors
portion of the restaurant. Hassim stood in the entrance,
breathing heavily, drops of perspiration upon his dusky
forehead, agitated yet triumphant. The manager came across to
him, frowning.</p>

<p>"There are things here," Hassim said, "which you may not
understand&mdash;nor even I, wholly. You wish to avoid trouble
in this restaurant. Go, then, and bring the Englishman to me who
sits at the corner table."</p>

<p>The manager was angry. He had a shrewd idea as to what it was
that Hassim held in his hand beneath that rug.</p>

<p>"If there is any brawling here," he threatened, "never again
shall you bring your rugs to my clients."</p>

<p>"That will be as Allah directs," was the quiet reply. "Send
or seek that Englishman."</p>

<p>The manager, with a shrug of his shoulders, turned away and
approached the young Englishman who had risen from his place but
had seemed for the last few seconds uncertain how to act. Mr.
Billingham, who had been watching his two nearer neighbours,
turned to his companions.</p>

<p>"Will you folks just excuse me one moment?" he begged. "I
want to say a word to our dusky friend there."</p>

<p>He made his way to the adjoining table, and, uninvited, took
the third chair. Neither the young man whom he had seen earlier
in the morning, nor his more villainous-looking companion,
indulged in any immediate comment upon this very singular
behaviour. The former simply looked at the newcomer with
expressionless face and eyes from which even enquiry was absent,
but the latter's right hand stole promptly underneath the
table-cloth and remained out of sight.</p>

<p>"Say, you understand plain English, don't you?" Mr.
Billingham asked.</p>

<p>"Naturally," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>"If you don't put your right hand upon the table this
second," Mr. Billingham declared, "I'll take you by the scruff
of the neck and throw you out, and your gun after you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's arm was outstretched; a strong, muscular
arm. The little Arab with the squinting eyes looked into this
intruder's face and decided that it was without doubt the face
of a man who meant what he said. He was prompt to obey.</p>

<p>"Now we can talk," Mr. Billingham continued, his eyes
straying for a moment to the corner where the Englishman was
standing irresolute, leaning upon his stick. "I'm taking a hand
in a game I don't quite tumble to, but I guess I'll see it
through. You're going to sit here quietly opposite me for
another three minutes and let things rip."</p>

<p>"Who are you and why do you interfere?" the taller of the two
young Arabs demanded. "What is your interest in this
matter?"</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better not be too inquisitive," was the curt
reply.</p>

<p>The young man watched with sullen eyes the Englishman, who,
with the manager by his side, was now making his way towards the
restaurant. He looked back at Mr. Billingham.</p>

<p>"If you knew what was going on there," he said, pointing
significantly towards the entrance to the restaurant</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, not wholly, but partially, fell. Ever so
slightly he turned his head in the direction indicated.
Instantly the younger of the two Arabs, with a movement of
incredible swiftness, stooped and half rose again. The sun,
which was streaming in through the glass windows, flashed upon
his silver-plated pistol. Quick though he was, however, he was
not quick enough. With a sudden terrible blow, Mr. Billingham
struck and pinned his hand to the table. The pistol clattered
harmlessly on to the floor. The young man's eyes glared. There
was murder in his face. He dived, sprang to his feet, swayed one
way and another. In Mr. Billingham's Herculean grip, however, he
was helpless. A couple of waiters hurried forward, followed by
the manager. One of them picked up the pistol.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" the manager demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing, so long as we don't let him move," Mr. Billingham
replied. "There's some trouble going on. I can't get the hang of
it, but this little one is the guy who meant mischief."</p>

<p>The Englishman emerged from the restaurant, with a smile of
triumph upon his face. He waved his hand to Mr. Billingham.
Then, recognising that something unusual had happened, he came
over to the table.</p>

<p>"Are you through with your little job?" Mr. Billingham
enquired.</p>

<p>"I am," was the prompt reply, "and jolly glad of it, too! ...
Is there anything wrong here?" he added, with a curious glance
at Mr. Billingham's companions.</p>

<p>"There might have been if I hadn't taken a chance," Mr.
Billingham acquiesced.</p>

<p>"You had better let him go," the taller of the two young
Arabs advised, breaking at last his long and impassive silence.
"Our task is over. We have failed. The evil has come. The
message has been delivered. All that we desire is to depart. I
pledge you my word that my brother is now safe. He carries the
symbol! He may not be touched!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham released his grip, and, in obedience to a sign
from the manager, the vestiaire brought the two young men their
hats and sticks. Very slowly they made their way back down the
Arcade and disappeared. Ben Hassim stepped forward from the
threshold of the restaurant. Once more he took up his place by
the side of his little pile of carpets. Once more that broad and
delightful smile illuminated his face.</p>

<p>"It was the great chief of my tribe," he explained. "I had to
pay my respects. It is a happy day, this. I will say eight
hundred francs. The carpet to you shall be as a thank-offering."</p>

<p>"Delivered down to the steamer?" Mr. Hooterman
stipulated.</p>

<p>"You pay me when I bring it," was the dignified response.</p>

<p>"Say, what about that knife?" Henry junior demanded. "Buy
that for me, Dad."</p>

<p>"Knife?" Hassim repeated, shaking his head slowly and
extending his arms. "I carry no knife. One lives in peace on
this side of the blue sea." Less than a mile from the land, the
great steamer lay at anchor, blazing with lights. Twice her
siren had made the night hideous. Now, with puffing and
snorting, the last tender, filled with passengers, had left the
harbour. The Marquis, well-content, replaced his hat upon his
head, lit a cigarette, and stuffed, with amusement, his five
hundred francs into his pocket. Hassim gathered up his rugs one
by one, after a final glance into the brown leather pocket-book
where eight hundred francs were safely bestowed. It had been a
great day for him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt a hand upon his shoulder. He looked round
quickly and perhaps it was some revival of an ancient instinct
which sent his right hand down to the folds of his robe. When he
recognized Mr. Billingham, however, he shrugged his shoulders
and smiled.</p>

<p>"Hassim, my friend," Mr. Billingham begged, "put me wise to
what has been happening. Curiosity disturbs my digestion. And
let me remind you of this. I, too, had a hand in the game. It
was I who found the Englishman recovering from his drugs outside
the Café de Paris this morning. Even as I led him away
the other came down the hill."</p>

<p>Hassim nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"They come from the land which was once mine," he explained.
"He, the Prince, who to-night is in the air&mdash;for he flies
back from Nice to Jaffa and thence to the valleys where his
kingdom lies&mdash;and the others, one of whom was his
brother."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was patient.</p>

<p>"The Englishman brought a letter or something of the sort,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>Ben Hassim looked around him. They were walking very slowly
along the quay. Perhaps the weight of his rugs was great.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "Years ago, before the great war, there
came to the country where I was born&mdash;a great kingdom it
was, and is, and ever will be&mdash;one of those strange
Englishmen who seek for wealth. He stayed nearly a year with the
King, the father of the Prince and that other. He paid money
which made the Kingdom of my country richer in camels and horses
and women and jewellery than any other, and he took in exchange
the land where the oil was. But before he left, so that the King
might not go back on his bargain, he took with him the secret
token, without which no man can be crowned King."</p>

<p>"The secret token?" Mr. Billingham repeated. "I don't get
you."</p>

<p>"It is an image of the first king of my country&mdash;two
thousand years old&mdash;beaten in gold," the vendor of carpets
continued solemnly. "In it there are emeralds for eyes, rubies
for lips, and pearls for teeth, yet so thin is it that a man
might carry it in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"They took it to England, but when they came to sink the
wells and the pledge should have been redeemed, the war came.
That other&mdash;the youngest son of the King&mdash;he chose
what they call civilisation. He came to England, to school and
to college. The Prince remained. Last year the King died."</p>

<p>"Tell me the name of this country," Mr. Billingham
begged.</p>

<p>Hassim shook his head.</p>

<p>"Since I left it, I speak of it no longer," he declared. "The
King, as I told you, died. That other had become what you see
him&mdash;a Western creature. He made favour with the Ministers
in England. He sought for the throne of his father&mdash;the
throne which belonged to the Prince&mdash;but the Prince, though
this is the first time he has ever left his country, was the
chosen of the people. He sent to those who owned the token. The
land was theirs. The war was over. These English were honest
men. The other, he too tried for the token. By
arrangement&mdash;I know not whose&mdash;they sent it here. The
other followed him. Because he might not raise his hand against
his brother, he brought with him a friend of evil repute. If he
could take back the token, the kingship was his. He failed."</p>

<p>The Marquis caught them up. He was in high spirits.</p>

<p>"Madelon waits for us at the Café de Paris," he told
Mr. Billingham. "We have supper together and you will pay me a
thousand francs. The family of Hooterman were well pleased with
me. La belle Mamie has presented me with her photograph, Madame
has invited me to Chicago, and Monsieur added a benefice to my
fee. If you will give me what you owe me, my friend, I may
consider paying for our supper."</p>

<p>They took a little voiture and drove up to the Café de
Paris. After the strain of the earlier part of the day, they
found themselves singularly gay. At the next table, Hassim was
stroking one of his beautiful rugs as he displayed it to a
little party of new arrivals. The brother of the Prince was
dancing with a professional danseuse. The Marquis, who was still
in high spirits, called for the wine waiter.</p>

<p>"I am appreciating the joy," he explained to his companions,
"of leisure and recreation after toil. You others, what have you
done? I, on the contrary, have gained&mdash;when you, my friend
Billingham, have paid me&mdash;fifteen hundred francs."</p>

<p>"I," Mr. Billingham protested, "have also been busy. I have
saved the life of a Prince."</p>

<p>"And I," Madelon sighed, "have heard all about her Women's
Guild from Mrs. Henry P. Hooterman of Chicago."</p>

<p>"I will pay for the wine," the Marquis decided.</p>

<h3>First published in <i>Collier's Weekly</i>, 13 Jun 1925</h3>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">EVEN the serious business of losing money
gracefully was suspended for a moment or two when Validia,
followed by her latest cavalier, emerged from the baccarat room
and leaned over the roulette table. All heads were turned. There
was a little whisper of half reluctant admiration. Validia had
been the acknowledged beauty of Monte Carlo for several
weeks.</p>

<p>"Give me a mille or two," she demanded, turning to her
companion with a careless gesture. He produced a
substantial-looking pocket-book, deliberately extracted two mille
notes and gave them to her. She passed them a little contemptuously
to the croupier.</p>

<p>"<i>Maximum au zéro et les chevaux</i>" she directed. "<i>La
monnaie en plaques.</i>"</p>

<p>The ball was spun. One of tho numbers at the lower end of the
table turned up. Validia swept the remaining plaques into her
bag and turned away.</p>

<p>"I do not know why I play this game!" she exclaimed angrily.
"I always lose. Let us try the other table."</p>

<p>Her cavalier followed her; silent, with an obedience which
was a little dog-like and British. Validia walked slowly and
there was no one who did not notice her coming and her passing.
She was beautiful in the type which pleased most at the moment,
with oval face, ivory-tinted complexion and black hair, smooth
and glossy, brushed back and ending in almost a chignon. She
wore a dress of white silk, with many flounces and with just a
suggestion of the crinoline. Her only jewellery was a rope of
wonderful pearls. Her total avoidance of all cosmetics, in a
season during which even school-girls aimed at making their lips
look like lines of scarlet, was in itself an aid to distinction.
She walked alluringly. Her dark brown eyes, a little narrow, it
is true, but very wonderful, held in them a light which many a
man had known to his cost. Her lips were so provocative, at
times so inviting, that one failed to notice their wickedness.
She had come to Monte Carlo two seasons before in the Russian
Ballet, unknown and without particular genius. She had abandoned
dancing now and her jewels and toilettes were each month more
gorgeous. She had given colour to a report and liked it to be
understood that she was secretly married to a somewhat
disreputable but wealthy member of a Royal House. She spoke of
her secret in the strictest confidence to everyone. It eased
somewhat the strain of a position which she herself once naively
remarked "might be open to misconception."</p>

<p>She approached the farther of the three roulette tables and
once more extended her hand to her companion, this time without
looking at him. It was a very beautiful hand, with long fingers
and exquisitely manicured nails. There was an emerald ring on
one of the fingers which was reputed to have belonged to
Catherine of Russia.</p>

<p>"A mille," she said.</p>

<p>The man by her side&mdash;very English, a little pompous,
distinctly middle-class&mdash;hesitated.</p>

<p>"You have those plaques," he reminded her.</p>

<p>She turned her head ever so slightly and his fingers went
shivering for his pocket-book. He handed her the note which she
took without a word of thanks. Again she staked and again she
lost. She thrust the plaques which came to her as change into
her bag. Then she turned towards the door.</p>

<p>"I think I will drink something," she decided. "You shall
take me to the bar, <i>mon ami</i>. That man Kretterson is a pig
to-night. He will not give up the bank for an hour."</p>

<p>"Why do you like so much to gamble?" he asked. "Why must it
be baccarat? They tell me there is no game where you can lose so
much." She laughed quietly and tapped his hand with her little
ivory fan.</p>

<p>"I do not often lose," she said.</p>

<p>Madelon, seated with Mr. Billingham in a remote corner of the
bar, leaned over suddenly and laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"My friend," she exclaimed, "I will tell you what it is which
makes this place seem so satisfying to us&mdash;which makes us
loath to leave. Underneath all its tinsel and theatricality
there is real life to be seen here&mdash;human everyday
life."</p>

<p>"I guess we've seen a few strange things this season," Mr.
Billingham acquiesced.</p>

<p>"I do not mean the obvious tragedies," MadeIon continued. "I
do not mean the suicides, the murders, the naked passions. I
mean something nearer to our hearts. I will give you an example....
 You saw the two who just came in?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Mr. Billingham assented. "The woman Validia&mdash;the
Russian woman&mdash;and the pompous English Johnny who follows
her like a shadow."</p>

<p>"Now I want you to look at some one else," Madelon went on,
dropping her voice a little. "Do you see that middle-aged,
badly-dressed woman who has just changed her seat?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"Female hayseed type," he observed. "Looks as though she had
been dug up from the back woods and dressed in last year's
styles from the department store."</p>

<p>Madelon smiled.</p>

<p>"You are really a very observant person," she murmured. "You
see her. She is a study in herself. She was probably considered
pretty when she was young. She lived in a small town and her
father was perhaps a prosperous but unambitious manufacturer.
She has gone comfortably through life and her chief troubles
have been her domestic servants and the high price of
provisions. Just now she has something else in her face. Can you
see it?"</p>

<p>"She looks kinder scared," Mr. Billingham suggested.</p>

<p>"She is living in the shadow of a new and terrible fear,"
Madelon declared. "Something haa happened to her of which she
has never dreamed. She has jogged comfortably on through life
and now suddenly there is a precipice at her feet. She is the
wife of the man who is talking to Validia. He has left her alone
all the evening. She has just changed her place so as to be out
of sight. Look at her sitting there with her hands in her lap
and her eyes staring through the wall. She is too rustic even to
hide her sorrow."</p>

<p>"Who put you wise to all this?" Mr. Billingham demanded
curiously.</p>

<p>"I talked to her yesterday afternoon," Madelon explained. "I
could not help it. She looked so lonely. Do you mind if I go and
talk to her again now?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not," Mr. Billingham acquiesced. "Come to
look at her closely she does look as though she'd been put
through it. I'll try a hand or two at <i>trente et
quarante</i>."</p>

<p>Madelon crossed the room and sat down by the woman's
side.</p>

<p>"You are not gambling this evening," she remarked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I do not play these games," the woman confessed, a little
timidly. "I don't understand them. At home we play auction
bridge sometimes, but I am not fond of cards."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" Madelon enquired. "At Exeter, in
Devonshire," the woman answered. "My husband is manager of the
principal bank there."</p>

<p>"Manager?" Madelon repeated. "I thought he was a banker
himself."</p>

<p>The woman shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is a big position," she said, "and my husband is very
much esteemed in the city. When we married he was just a clerk
in the bank with two hundred a year. He has just got on by being
steady and industrious. He has a wonderful head for figures,
too."</p>

<p>"This must be a great change for you after an English city,"
Madelon suggested.</p>

<p>The woman shivered. She was keeping her eyes carefully turned
away from the further end of the room.</p>

<p>"It is a horrible place," she declared, with a strange little
sob in her throat. "The first day I thought I should like it.
The band was playing and the sun was shining and Henry and I
took a little carriage and drove out to Cap Martin, and after
dinner at the hotel we got our tickets for the Rooms, and I won
thirty francs. I thought it was quite a wonderful place that
first evening!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," Madelon asked&mdash;"that is if you do not think
it an impertinent question&mdash;is your husband very rich?"</p>

<p>"We are very well off," was the complacent reply. "He gets
eight hundred a year now and he has just had a legacy. That is
why we are here. We have never been abroad and he had to take
his holiday in February, so we came out here for three weeks.
Cook's arranged it all for us. I thought that I was going to
enjoy it so much and now it all seems terrible."</p>

<p>"You mean because of that woman?" Madelon said kindly.</p>

<p>"I do not know why I talk to you like this," the woman
continued, with a note of desperation in her tone, "but there it
is! Henry has gone mad. He will not let me speak to him at
night. He doesn't sleep. I wake up and find him with his eyes
open, muttering to himself. He spends more money every day than
our whole hotel bill on flowers for her. If I speak to him he
storms. And," she went on confidentially, "if any of the folks
from around us were to get to hear of this&mdash;any of his big
clients or the Bishop&mdash;we have all the ecclesiastical
business&mdash;I can't think what would happen."</p>

<p>"Do you mind my asking you how much this legacy was?" Madelon
ventured.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds," the woman confided.</p>

<p>"Eight thousand when the duties were paid. We are going to
invest it in house property in Exeter, and a little cottage down
on the south coast for our summer holidays, but Henry thought he
would like to take this trip first."</p>

<p>"How did your husband become acquainted with this woman?"
Madelon enquired.</p>

<p>"I don't know," was the helpless reply. "He stood next her
one evening whilst she was waiting for a seat at a chemm de fer
table. If any one had told me," she continued, "that Henry
Norton&mdash;the Henry I've been married to for twenty-two
years&mdash;would behave as he is doing, like a stark, raving
lunatic, all on account of a half-naked, shameless creature like
that, I should have thought that they were crazy. Henry used to
go on so at the young girls who wore short skirts in Exeter.
He's a churchwarden and the Bishop calls him his right-hand man
in the city. And now look at him! If any of the directors of the
bank were to see him at this moment where should we be?"</p>

"How did your husband become acquainted with this woman?"<br>
Madelon enquired. "I don't know," was the helpless reply.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Men are very trying creatures," Madelon agreed soothingly.
"Sometimes they break out like this, but it all passes. How long
are you staying?"</p>

<p>"For another ten days.... How I shall live through them I
don't know," Mrs. Norton added, with a little break in her
voice. "For a week I have cried myself to sleep and I go and cry
in the afternoons, and now I haven't any tears left. I have
nothing but just misery. I try to keep away from here, but what
can I do? I only fancy things. I sat in the hotel all last
night, in the lounge, and read last week's papers. I sat there
until one o'clock, and he hadn't come in. Then I went and walked
out on the Terrace, where they say people sometimes commit
suicide. I never thought of that before, but when one has such a
pain"</p>

<p>Madelon patted her companion's fat hand for a moment.</p>

<p>"You must not be silly," she enjoined. "Listen. I shall try
and help you. There are ways."</p>

<p>"Henry won't stand being interfered with," his wife
sighed.</p>

<p>Madelon nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"I can quite believe that," she said. "When an obstinate,
rather narrow-minded man like your husband gets such an
obsession he is hard to deal with. But there is always the
woman. I shall go and talk to a friend of mine, who is very
clever and very fond of helping people in trouble&mdash;what you
call in English, I think, 'a good sort.'"...</p>

<p>Madelon departed with another little nod. On her way out she
passed Validia and Mr. Norton, the bank manager from Exeter. Mr.
Norton did not appear to be talking much; his attitude was
simply one of dogged and deliberate concentration. Validia was
gazing at herself in a little mirror. She was looking bored.</p>

<p>"Let us return, my friend, and watch the play," she
suggested, putting away her vanity case. "If that hateful man is
losing, perhaps he will give me the bank a little earlier. Would
you like to be my partner this evening?... Well, we shall
see!"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet. Her companion immediately followed her
example.</p>

<p>"I do not understand the game," he said hesitatingly, "but if
you wish it"</p>

<p>He followed at her heels; a little self-conscious, a little
vain, only failing to be ridiculous because of his intense
earnestness. As they crossed the passage, he leaned towards
her.</p>

<p>"Must you gamble to-night?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we go out somewhere&mdash;have some
supper&mdash;talk? I want to talk to you," he went on. "I see
nothing of you with all these people. I waited until four
o'clock this morning, and then you were too tired."</p>

<p>She laughed and looked at him with one of those sidelong
glances which would have been a revelation to any one from
Exeter.</p>

<p>"Some time," she whispered, "the caprice will seize me. I
will take you by the arm. I shall whisper 'let us go.' Then you
will be happy. Just along the passage there&mdash;it is not far.
You will be glad then that you have waited."</p>

<p>He was a man of imperturbable ways, of stiff and portly
demeanour, but little veins stood out upon his forehead and
something rose in his throat. Before he could reply they were
once more amongst the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. Kretterson was winning that evening and showed no desire
whatever to relinquish the bank. Validia became fretful and
irritable. She was ready to welcome any diversion. She received
the bow of the Marquis with marked graciousness. She knew all
about him&mdash;that he was poor but distinguished.
Nevertheless, his notice was always pleasant and he might well
be the medium to other things.</p>

<p>"Madame has yet not had her chance at the baccarat table?" he
enquired.</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"That man wearies me," she declared. "He wins and so he
persists. After all, why not? I would do the same. The trouble
is I desire to play and I do not like to wait for the things
which I desire."</p>

<p>"Why not punt against him?" the Marquis suggested.</p>

<p>"It is a winning bank," she replied, "and besides I like the
cards myself."</p>

<p>She smiled at him, thinking that although he, too, was
elderly, he was indeed a man of great distinction; contrasting
him for a moment in her mind with that dumb, stolid Englishman
who stood patiently waiting for her notice. And the Marquis,
looking at her perfect face, tracing the curve of her smile,
appreciating the little glint of red in the liquid brown of her
eyes, fancied himself back again in his younger days. She was
indeed a very beautiful woman. Then he remembered his
mission.</p>

<p>"I wish, madame," he said, "to ask a favour. I wish to
present to you my friend Mr. Billingham from New York. Mr.
Billingham is one of those giants who have lifted commerce and
moneymaking into a place amongst the fine arts. He has been an
admirer of yours for a long time."</p>

<p>No form of introduction could have been more apt. It gave
madame great pleasure to make the acquaintance of Mr.
Billingham. Her pleasure was enhanced when she found that he
spoke quite tolerable French. The three talked together, whilst
Mr. Henry Norton stood dumbly in the background. Presently,
without a word of excuse to her late companion, Validia pointed
to an empty seat and motioned Mr. Billingham to accompany
her.</p>

<p>"You have left your friend," he remarked, accepting, however,
her invitation.</p>

<p>"Ah, he wearies me!" she murmured. "You need have no fear. He
has not a word of French. It wearies me, too, to speak his ugly
language. You, Monsieur, speak French so well for an American.
You have lived in this country?"</p>

<p>"Only as a pilgrim," was the regretful reply. "We Americans
do our best to be patriotic but our law-makers do their best to
push us over on this side if we want a little freedom."</p>

<p>"What sort of freedom do you want?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's answering smile was noncommittal.</p>

<p>"Madame," he confessed, "the freedom I most desire at this
moment is to talk to you very confidentially&mdash;if I might
take the liberty on an acquaintance so short."</p>

<p>She leaned a little towards him.</p>

<p>"You intrigue me," she whispered. "What have you to say to me
so confidential?"</p>

<p>"I should like to speak," Mr. Billingham confided, "of that
fellow who shadows you everywhere."</p>

<p>She laughed; softly at first and then unrestrainedly, her
head thrown back, both rows of her brilliant teeth exposed.</p>

<p>"Well," she demanded presently, "what of him?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," Mr. Billingham began, "do you know who
he is?"</p>

<p>"A rich English banker," she replied. "He is dull, he is
stupid, he is not even generous, except that he is '<i>fou de
mot</i>.' He wearies me. But what would you have? I make no
pretence. I am Validia. Someone must pay that I may live." Mr.
Billingham nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "I admire your frankness. I will imitate
it. Your friend is not what you suppose him. He is not a banker
at all. He is the local manager in an English country town of a
great banking firm at a salary which would not pay for your silk
stockings and gloves in the year."</p>

<p>"What does he do here, then?" she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"He has come into a legacy," Mr. Billingham explained, "and
before investing it he has brought his wife here for a short
holiday. They have never been abroad before. They have been
married twenty-two years. They live in an English Cathedral city
in a ten-roomed house with two maid servants. This is his
long-talked-of holiday. Of the husband and his madness you know.
The wife&mdash;she is plain, between forty-five and fifty, and your
maid would not wear her dresses. You only need a glance at her
to realise her position. She is face to face with a new and
terrible sorrow in life."</p>

<p>"You are a very strange person," Validia observed. "Are you
in earnest?"</p>

<p>"More or less," Mr. Billingham assented.</p>

<p>"I have deceived myself perhaps in this man's story," she
admitted after a moment's reflection. "It is my imperfect
knowledge of his language. Besides, he is so stupid that I
thought he must be rich. How much is this legacy?"</p>

<p>"Less than eight thousand pounds," Mr. Billingham
replied.</p>

<p>She yawned.</p>

<p>"It is a disappointment," she confessed. "I am glad that you
told me. Still, if he cannot pay much for being foolish, he must
pay little. Eight thousand pounds would cover my expenses here
and perhaps he can borrow something."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham sat for a moment in silence. She looked at him
curiously. A few yards away Norton stood watching them, waiting
for his opportunity to slip into the vacant place if its present
occupant should take his departure.</p>

<p>"Is it worth your notice, a small thing like this?" Mr.
Billingham asked.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she replied. "If he has no more, then at least I
should be rid of him when it was gone. You know who I am and
what I am. They say of me, my friends here, that I have one
quality. I am truthful. That is all. What I need of men who
admire me is money. All that I have to give&mdash;and it is
much&mdash;I will give to the man who can make me feel. That man
will not be Mr. Henry Norton&mdash;but what would you have? I,
even like the others, must live."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"If you were a man," he said, "I should like to do business
with you. I like your way of putting the cards upon the table. I
shall now show my admiration by following your example. I am one
of the few men in the world who have begged for an introduction
not to offer their homage, although I am not sure that at the
present moment I do not consider you the most beautiful woman in
the world."</p>

<p>"It is something," she remarked. "It is perhaps the truth.
But I do not attract you, possibly?" She turned and looked at
him&mdash;looked at him thoughtfully and with a comprehension
which amazed him.</p>

<p>"It is true," she continued. "I do not attract you because
you are another of these Saxons who possess the hateful gift of
fidelity. You love another woman. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he admitted. "In the meanwhile the reason why I
asked to be presented to you was to beg you to open the door of
that golden cage of yours and let this last captive escape."</p>

<p>She eyed him speculatively.</p>

<p>"He does not wish to escape," she declared. "And besides, why
should I do as you ask? What are you offering me? Not even your
homage, as you yourself have admitted."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was a brave man, but even he was conscious of
the peril of the moment. Nevertheless, he braced himself.</p>

<p>"Madame," he confessed, "I have perhaps nothing to offer you.
On the other hand there is something, some negative
consideration, which I think you might find adequate."</p>

<p>"You talk strangely, Monsieur," she observed. "It is a
difficult subject."</p>

<p>"You need not fear to be frank with me," she told him.</p>

<p>"Let it be so, then. If you do not grant my request I do not
think that your nightly games at baccarat will continue."</p>

<p>Whatever she might have been expecting it was not this. Her
face showed no surprise nor any anger. She simply seemed
suddenly to have become removed into another world. She had
become entirely and absolutely aloof.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," she said presently. "At baccarat I
win because I have an instinct for the game. There have been
many who have protested to the management against a woman being
allowed to take the bank. Yet, you see, I continue! You cannot
disturb me!"</p>

<p>"I shall certainly try," he warned her.</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"A challenge!" she exclaimed. "Very well, I accept it!...
Come here, my good friend, Mr. Norton," she went on in English.
"Why do you stand apart? You must meet this gentleman&mdash;Mr.
Billingham from New York, I think he calls himself. He imagines
that to-night I am not to win at baccarat. We shall see! Would
you like to take a bank with me?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I have enough money with me," was the
somewhat hesitating reply. She frowned and tapped upon the floor
impatiently with her foot.</p>

<p>"Of course I will do whatever you wish me to do," he went on
hastily. "You know that I do not understand the game."</p>

<p>"They will cash your cheque here," she said. "Get me twenty
milles and have more in your pocket. We will see whether we can
win. And do not leave me again. I find these others wearisome."
She bade Mr. Billingham a mocking farewell and departed, the man
at her side obviously a little bewildered by her sudden
graciousness. The Marquis strolled up.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" he enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he replied. "We have exchanged long distance
shots. I hoped for terms, but she prefers a fight."</p>

<p>"But I do not see, my friend, what you can do," the Marquis
protested.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," Mr. Billingham confided.</p>

<p>"When I have an idea of this sort it is not often a mistaken
one. I have watched this game for several evenings. We shall
see!"</p>

<p>Perhaps because of her beauty and evil reputation, or it may
have been from the magnitude of the stakes, or even that the
sight of a woman taking a bank at baccarat was in itself an
infrequent spectacle, the usual little crowd gathered round the
table when Validia took the place which her predecessor had
vacated. The first few coups were not productive of any great
interest. The bank lost a little and gained a little. Validia
sat with the face of a sphinx, drawing her card, announcing her
coup with the air of an automaton. Presently, however, the game
increased in volume. A wealthy South American, once successfully
and once unsuccessfully, had called "banquo." Suddenly there was
a little stir. Mr. Kretterson had strolled up and taken the
place which had been reserved for him. Every one leaned
forward&mdash;the gambling was about to begin! He addressed a
whispered question to the croupier as to the size of the bank,
nodded, and produced a huge packet of bills.</p>

<p>"Fifty milles," he declared.</p>

<p>There was a little hush. Mr. Billingham was amongst the crowd
wedged behind his chair and looking over his shoulder. By his
side was a young man&mdash;one of the celebrities of the
rooms&mdash;who out of deference had been allowed a place almost
to himself, but of whom Mr. Billingham, perhaps because of his
democratic principles, had never once lost sight. Kretterson
picked up his cards. He had a king and a queen. He asked for a
card, and glanced at it carelessly. It was a nine. Validia toyed
with her own cards for a moment, then almost for the first time
she raised her head. At the same moment Mr. Billingham leaned
forward. Their eyes met. Palpably she hesitated. Mr. Billingham
was looking directly at her with his usual goodhumoured and
friendly smile hovering at the corners of his lips. Apparently,
so far as he, at any rate, was concerned, no interchange of
glances could have been more harmless or have lacked more
completely any ulterior significance. Yet when Validia looked
away her fingers were trembling. She glanced at her cards
uncertainly and laid them down. She had a king and a six. The
croupier began to deal out the winnings.</p>

<br>

Validia toyed with her own cards for a moment, then<br>

Billingham was looking directly at her. Their eyes met.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"What on earth did Validia hesitate for?" some one whispered,
behind Mr. Billingham. "She couldn't possibly draw with six,
having given the nine."</p>

<p>"Lost her head for a moment, perhaps," some one else
commented. "She does make the most extraordinary draws
sometimes. Hullo, she's going to quit!"</p>

<p>Validia had risen to her feet with a little gesture of
excuse. The croupier announced that Madame was indisposed, and
Mr. Kretterson, in response to a universal but unspoken
invitation, took the bank. As she passed out, she touched Mr.
Billingham on the arm. He followed her to a remote seat in a
corner of the bar.</p>

<p>"Order me some brandy," she begged.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham obeyed in silence. Incidentally he ordered a
whisky and soda for himself. In a moment or two Validia
spoke.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" she asked, in a low tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I suppose because I am myself an adventurer," he replied. "I
go about the world in search of strange happenings, and I am
always watching for them. As a matter of fact there is no game
of cards at which I cannot perform miracles myself. I dare not
play poker, even with my enemies."</p>

<p>"Still I do not understand," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Simple enough," he continued. "I've watched you take your
bank from the background, and once or twice I've stood behind
your chair. You are a woman of intelligence. Often I have seen
you draw when no woman who knew the game would dream of it. That
set me thinking. I looked round the table. There was one person
always interested who seldom played; who seemed to prefer to
move about and watch the drawer of cards. That person was
perhaps the one human being in these rooms whom people would be
least likely to suspect of malpractice. A few nights ago I saw!
I gave you a warning when I was first introduced to you. You
would not take it."</p>

<p>"I never dreamed," she murmured, "that you suspected. I
thought you meant that you would complain to the management
about a woman taking the bank. Others have done it. They hate
women bankers."</p>

<p>"To-night," Mr. Billingham went on, "I stood by the side of
your&mdash;shall I call him, accomplice? You dared not even look
for the sign. It would have been a forlorn hope, in any case, to
have drawn to a six, but I think that you would have tried it if
I had not stood there."</p>

<p>"Tell me what you propose to do," she begged.</p>

<p>"You will return to that poor fool Norton the twenty milles
and all that you have borrowed from him," Mr. Billingham
pronounced. "You will simply wash him out completely, and so far
as I am concerned the matter passes from my memory."</p>

<p>"You will keep your own counsel?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," he promised. "I am no philanthropist. I am not
in the world to protect fools. If you are clever enough to bring
this off I am not one of those who would interfere."</p>

<p>She looked at him steadfastly.</p>

<p>"If you were Norton," she said, "I would not let you go."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham smiled.</p>

<p>"Alas," he sighed, "there is that other reason you were
clever enough to divine. Now go and say your farewell to this
pseudo-banker of yours. But first&mdash;have you any heart at
all, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Not for man or woman," she answered, a little wearily.</p>

<p>"Yet for one moment look across the room," he begged. "There
is a plain, middle-aged woman seated there by herself. You see
her?"</p>

<p>"I see her," Validia assented. "She is Norton's wife."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"She is wearing the wrong sort of clothes," he continued,
"and she knows it. She is looking plain and
commonplace&mdash;and she knows it. Somehow or other the truth
has come to her; in here, or in the quiet times of the night,
when she hasn't been able to sleep. She is suddenly frightened.
Everything that meant life to her has gone. She is sitting there
because she hasn't the courage to cross through the
rooms&mdash;sitting there like some creature in pain. You can
see all that in her face if you care to look&mdash;that
commonplace face; eloquent now, perhaps, for the first time
since possibly the day of her marriage, or the day her first
child was born."</p>

<p>Validia looked across the room incuriously. Her eyes were as
hard as ever; her expression unchanged.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I see what you are trying to explain. That
means nothing to me, however. I do not understand people who
take account of the sufferings of others."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham was silent for a moment. Then he rose to his
feet. She followed suit.</p>

<p>"I will go and keep my bargain," she promised. "On the whole
you are an interesting enemy. It is a pity that you are on the
other side," she added, with that queer little smile upon her
lips which had turned the heads of many men and which two
seasons ago had induced the critics to christen her portrait in
the Salon a modern "Mona Lisa." ...</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham left her at the door and went in search of
Madelon. She made a little grimace as she led him back to the
bar.</p>

<p>"Here have I been dying for an orangeade," she exclaimed,
"and you sitting there with Validia, to the scandal of
everybody. Your confessions, if you please!"</p>

<p>He drew her abruptly on one side. Norton, with unseeing eyes
and uncertain footsteps, had entered the bar. All the prim
stiffness of his deportment, his somewhat awkward
self-assertiveness, had gone. He was like a man suddenly made natural
by a catastrophe; a little frightened, cowed, stricken into
common-sense. He crossed towards the bar, stood there gripping
the rail with one hand, called for a drink and finished it at a
gulp. His wife leaned forward from her place.</p>

<p>"Henry!" she called out.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her, almost without recognition.
Nevertheless, he made his way to her side. Mr. Billingham
whispered in Madelon's ear. Together they approached. Madelon
took command of the situation.</p>

<p>"Still not playing?" she said pleasantly to Mrs. Norton. "Let
me introduce my friend, Mr. Billingham. This is your husband, is
it not?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham seemed suddenly possessed by one of those
extraordinary fits of geniality which overwhelm any situation.
Mrs. Norton's confused surprise and Mr. Norton's stupor were
scarcely noticeable.</p>

<p>"Very glad to meet you both, I'm sure," Mr. Billingham
declared. "Why, there's the Marquis!" he went on, as the latter
looked tentatively in.</p>

<p>"Come right along," he invited. "Let me present you&mdash;the
Marquis de Felan&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Norton. Sit down and join
us, Marquis. Waiter! A bottle of Clicquot 1911&mdash;Dry
England, mind, not the Brut&mdash;some biscuits, and five
glasses! You will join us in a glass of wine, Mr. Norton?"</p>

<p>"I thank you very much," was the colourless reply.</p>

<p>"Tell me, you came from Exeter&mdash;a banker there," Mr.
Billingham continued, producing his cigar-case. "Any connection
with the British General Bank?"</p>

<p>"I am the manager of the Exeter Branch, sir," Mr. Norton
confided, with a faint return to his old assurance of
manner.</p>

<p>"My, is that so?" Mr. Billingham exclaimed. "One of the
finest banks going! I congratulate you, sir. Perhaps you know a
friend of mine down there&mdash;Lord Herrington."</p>

<p>"Lord Herrington is one of my most valued clients," Mr.
Norton declared.</p>

<p>"Say, if this isn't a small world!" Mr. Billingham observed,
watching the wine being poured out. "That's why I like this
place. We men who watch the run of things can come along and rub
shoulders with all sorts and be none the worse for it. and then
meet our own sort and get all the pleasure imaginable. Say, Mr.
Norton, sir, I'm very glad to have met you. Lord Herrington has
asked me to stay with him often. We've been associated in more
than one financial enterprise on the other side. I guess I may
come and look you up at Exeter. Mrs. Norton, your very good
health!"</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
Say, Mr. Norton, sir, I'm very glad to have<br>
met you. Mrs. Norton, your very good health!"</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>By degrees the situation seemed to become almost normal. Mr.
Norton talked about the banking business with increased
eloquence, whilst his wife confided to Madelon in an undertone
the extraordinary difficulties presented by the servant problem
in Exeter. Mr. Billingham glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I've had all the gambling I want to-night," he declared.
"Let's have a change. There's a Gala Supper at the Carlton.
Let's all go. I told them I'd most likely want a table. What do
you say, Mrs. Norton? I don't look the figure for it, perhaps,
but I'm a useful man at a fox-trot. You dance, of course?"</p>

<p>"We had lessons," Mrs. Norton admitted, looking doubtfully at
her husband.</p>

<p>"Anyway, we can watch the fun," her prospective host
continued. "Come along, all of you. We'll get an automobile
outside. There are one or two questions about banking matters
over on your side," he went on, slipping his arm through Mr.
Norton's, "I've wanted to ask a man of your experience."</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the following morning, Madelon and Mr.
Billingham watched their guests step into a voiture outside the
Carlton. Mr. Norton handed his wife in amidst a general exchange
of good-humoured farewells, and was most impressive in his
insistence that no one should forget their luncheon engagement
with him on the morrow. He drew the rug over his wife and leaned
back by her side, waving his hand with something of his old
complacence. Suddenly Mr. Billingham felt Madelon's fingers
grasping his arm.</p>

<p>"You are the dearest person in the world," she whispered.
"Not only that, but you are the greatest diplomatist. Did you
know that he was holding his wife's hand? And did you see him
smile at her at the table? If ever a man was trying to assure
her that he was sorry and that he had to be forgiven, he was
doing it. And her face&mdash;why, she was almost good-looking!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham watched the approach of the voiture which he
had summoned.</p>

<p>"I guess that little affair's fixed up all right," he
conceded.... "I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he was silent; thoughtful, almost depressed. Her
fingers lingered in his as he handed her into the carriage.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she whispered&mdash;"I wonder too!"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE Marquis was in an evil humour. Neither the
sight of that tactfully proffered aperitif, nor his niece's
ingratiating smile, produced the slightest effect upon him. He
had worked himself up into this state and he meant to remain
angry.</p>

<p>"Four months ago," he declared, thumping the little table
before him with his fist, "you, my friend Billingham, joined
company with my niece and myself in a partnership&mdash;an
unwritten partnership, perhaps, but nevertheless a
partnership&mdash;which was to be devoted to our mutual gain. I
make myself clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Mr. Billingham assented.</p>

<p>"We embarked upon various enterprises," the Marquis
continued, "and met with some success, but lately, what do we
do? We rescue a foolish middle-aged man from the clutches of an
adventuress. Not one penny comes to our exchequer. We help a
young disabled soldier to carry out a delicate mission. Again
not a penny! I ask you how long it is to continue? You others
may have sources of wealth unknown to me," he went on, casting a
suspicious glance at Mr. Billingham. "As for me, I am penniless.
I must live as a gentleman needs to live. How am I to do it, I
ask you? You, my friend Billingham, tell me that the common
funds are exhausted. My niece here has not even a hundred francs
to advance. What then, I ask you, is the use of our partnership?
You two amuse yourselves whilst I starve."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham scratched his chin. He seemed disposed to take
a lenient view of the other's demeanour.</p>

<p>"There is some sense in what you are saying, Marquis," he
admitted. "At the same time, you might remember that your niece
and I saved the money we made in one or two little affairs,
whereas you"</p>

<p>He pointed eloquently towards the Casino. The Marquis sat
forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"Listen, then," he interrupted. "I am not a man to accuse a
friend of ill-faith. If you assure me that you still maintain
your suite at the Hotel de Paris, your manner of living here,
your flowers to my niece, your champagne at our dinners, on the
profits of those adventures in which we have been mutually
concerned, then you are a very wonderful man. But I will be
open. It seems to me that you have been engaged in other
enterprises in which we have not been included."</p>

<p>"As to that," Mr. Billingham protested, "you are dead wrong.
I may have come into a little bit of my own, but it hasn't been
through anything that's happened out here. You're for business
again, I take it, Marquis?"</p>

<p>"I have seventeen francs and forty centimes in the world,"
was the bitter reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"This morning," he announced, "I shall provide luncheon at
the Hotel de Paris. Afterwards you shall both come to my rooms.
I will then propound a scheme by means of which some temporary
relief may be afforded us."</p>

<p>"Dear, clever man," Madelon murmured. "I have known for two
days&mdash;since I saw you talking so earnestly with that
terrible little Austrian&mdash;that something was coming."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," Mr. Billingham acknowledged, "but whether
it will result in financial profit or not it is impossible at
present to say. I guess we might as well try it out,
anyway."</p>

<p>In Mr. Billingham's sitting-room, an hour later, the Marquis
and Madelon, on their arrival, found their host indulging in
intimate conversation with a black-haired and bespectacled
foreigner whom he introduced as Doctor Ludwig Stranz. The
Doctor, who spoke English with a very guttural accent, was a man
of heavy build and coarse features, untidily dressed and
besprinkled with cigar ash. He was cordial but without any grace
of manner.</p>

<p>"Friends of Mr. Billingham," he declared, "I make myself glad
to know. This is a beastly place. You perhaps haf gained
money."</p>

<p>"I most certainly have not," the Marquis rejoined. "Do I
gather that you too are a gambler, Doctor Stranz?"</p>

<p>"I am a scientist," was the verbose reply. "I have discovered
many wonderful things in my day, though many of my discoveries
have been stolen from me and used to their profits by others. I
have been to Paris with an idea of my own&mdash;useless! Then I
come here. I meet my good friend Mr. Billingham. It was he who
once found me money for a little invention of mine."</p>

<p>"That was in the days when I had some," Mr. Billingham
explained hastily!&mdash;"before linoleum went back on me."</p>

<p>"Ah, that was a pity that you lose your money," Doctor Stranz
declared. "It is a great invention this of mine now. Even when
put to so ridiculous a use"</p>

<p>"That will do," Mr. Billingham interrupted abruptly. "We will
meet as arranged this afternoon, Doctor Stranz. Better perhaps
come five minutes before the time arranged and meet me here. We
can go through our plans once more so that there need be no
mistake."</p>

<p>"It is so arranged," Doctor Stranz agreed, rising to his feet
a little reluctantly. "I go to my lonely breakfast."</p>

<p>It was a hint of which Mr. Billingham took not the slightest
notice. They all three watched him depart.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary man!" Madelon exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He is perhaps concerned with the enterprise you spoke of,"
the Marquis suggested eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is a necessary part of it," Mr. Billingham assented. "But
I warn you there is no certainty about this enterprise. It may
come off&mdash;it may not. At any rate it is my affair. No one
else&mdash;though I shall rely upon your help&mdash;will be
likely to meet with trouble."</p>

<p>"The thought that there is an enterprise to be considered at
all," the Marquis declared with satisfaction, "gives to my
luncheon an increased appetite. I suggest a descent."</p>

<p>Madelon, who was looking in the mirror, sighed.</p>

<p>"I should like some one to admire my hat," she observed,
readjusting it a little.</p>

<p>"Its only fault," Mr. Billingham suggested, "is that it
hides too much of your face."</p>

<p>"Its only fault that I can see," the Marquis groaned, "is
that it cost too much money." Madelon made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"Skinflint!" she exclaimed. "I made it myself!" At four
o'clock that afternoon, just as the Salons de Jeux of the
Sporting Club were opened, one of the liveried footmen attached
to the place announced to Monsieur Louchette, the manager, who
was seated in his office, a visit from Mr. Billingham and a
friend. Mr Billingham, being a person who during the four months
of his sojourn in Monte Carlo had established himself as an
<i>habitué</i> of some consequence, the manager abandoned
his habits of almost papal seclusion and intimated his
willingness to receive the two gentlemen. The door was thrown
open and they accordingly presented themselves.</p>

<p>"I'd like you," Mr. Billingham said, having shaken hands, "to
meet my friend, Doctor Stranz, who has been staying here for a
while."</p>

<p>Doctor Stranz bowed and shook hands solemnly. The manager
regarded him with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"Ach, what a place!" the former exclaimed. Monsieur Louchette
cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I trust you have enjoyed your stay here, Doctor," he
remarked. "What can I have the pleasure of doing for you,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"For me nothing," Mr. Billingham replied. "My friend the
Doctor, whom I met in New York during the war, just asked me to
introduce him. If you gentlemen have business to talk over I
guess I'll leave you to it."</p>

<p>The manager looked at Doctor Stranz and disliked him.</p>

<p>"No need for you to leave us, Mr. Billingham," he declared
hastily. "What can I do for you, sir?" he added, turning to his
companion.</p>

<p>Doctor Stranz sat down ponderously, placing the small black
bag which he was carrying with him by his side.</p>

<p>"Sir," he announced, "I haf met with great misfortunes here.
I haf lost heavily. I haf lost all my beautiful money."</p>

<p>"Indeed," Monsieur Louchette remarked coldly. "If your
business here is simply to tell me this"</p>

<p>"It is not," Doctor Stranz interrupted. "I would haf you know
all of the situation. I come here with one hundred thousand
francs&mdash;money which has been paid me for my marvellous
inventions. I am a great inventor. There is no one who has such
a brain as mine. I make everything that blow up. With a
projectile as big as a pea I could destroy the Palais at
Versailles or the Reichstag in Berlin."</p>

<p>"Very wonderful, I am sure," the manager observed a little
impatiently, "but you will excuse me if I remark that I am
busy."</p>

<p>"Ach, busy!" Doctor Stranz repeated, leaning over and
striking the edge of the table before which the other was
seated. "You may be busy but you must listen to me.
One.&mdash;more than one hundred thousand francs of my
hard-earned money I have lost here. Something must be done for
me."</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette looked at Mr. Billingham as though to ask
whether the man were a lunatic.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"I had not received," he said, "the slightest intimation as
to what the Doctor was wanting. He simply asked for an
introduction. I am sorry I brought him if he is a nuisance.
Perhaps I had better leave you alone."</p>

<p>"Not on any account," the manager begged. "You are sure that
the man is sane?" he added, under his breath.</p>

<p>"Sane I am, but insane soon I shall be," the Doctor
thundered. "Now I shall show you whether I am a man of sense or
not. I will talk to you plainly. I want my money back."</p>

<p>"If you wish us to make an advance to cover your return fare
home and reasonable hotel expenses," the manager suggested,
drawing a form towards him, "you can make application for a
viatique which will receive due consideration. You of course
understand, however, that you will not be allowed in the rooms
again until the amount is repaid."</p>

<p>"I want my money back," Doctor Stranz repeated doggedly. "One
hundred and forty thousand francs&mdash;that is just what I
want."</p>

<p>"You are wasting my time," Monsieur Louchette declared
quietly. "Permit me to wish you good-afternoon."</p>

<p>The official's forefinger strayed towards the bell which
stood upon his desk. Doctor Stranz reached out his hand.
Something in his expression induced the other to pause.</p>

<p>"I have told you," he said, "that I must have back my one
hundred and forty thousand francs. I have not told you what I
shall do if you refuse."</p>

<p>"A threat!" the manager exclaimed.</p>

<p>"If you refuse I promise you this," the Doctor continued
earnestly. "At eleven o'clock to-night this place will
be&mdash;is it not so&mdash;packed with people. At five minutes
past eleven you shall find them in the streets, on the promenade
perhaps, the pavements, on the stairway, everywhere&mdash;but
not in those rooms&mdash;not in those rooms, I promise you."</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette looked towards Mr. Billingham who nodded
sympathetically, and, unseen by the Doctor, tapped his forehead.
The manager smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, "I am sorry for you, Doctor Stranz,
but you must see that there is no reason why I should return
your money any more than anybody else's. There are dozens and
scores here every season who lose more than you have done. You
must come back next year and hope for better luck."</p>

<p>"Will I haf back again my one hundred and forty thousand
francs?" Doctor Stranz demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course not," was the firm reply. "Your friend Mr.
Billingham will explain to you the absurdity of such a
suggestion. You will permit me."</p>

<p>This time the manager succeeded in reaching the bell. Doctor
Stranz rose stiffly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he announced, "I will visit you again to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"It will be quite useless," the manager assured him. "I wish
you good-afternoon, gentlemen." A servant entered and held open
the door. Mr. Billingham loitered behind.</p>

<p>"Say, I am sorry I brought him in," he apologised. "I had no
idea he was luny. He was a bright fellow enough when I knew him.
The war again, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Quite all right, Mr. Billingham," the other remarked a
little patronisingly. "We are used to strange visitors."</p>

<p>The visit of the mad Austrian had almost passed out of the
mind of the manager of the Sporting Club. Nevertheless at a few
minutes before eleven he left his office and strolled through
the Rooms. Late in the season though it was, they were still
crowded, and with a somewhat brillianf gathering. There was an
English Duke and an American millionaire playing in maximums at
roulette, a noted Greek financier was taking a bank at baccarat,
crowds of pretty and welldressed women and well-known men
thronged the place. With a little frown the manager recognised
Doctor Stranz seated next to a croupier. He summoned one of his
deputies.</p>

<p>"That man's card of admission," he directed, pointing him
out, "must be withdrawn. He is a madman and declares he has lost
one hundred and forty thousand francs. Doctor Stranz his name
is."</p>

<p>"I will see to it at once, sir," the deputy promised.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck. Nothing happened. Suddenly, however,
there was a little murmur. The people at the tables raised their
heads. The loiterers in the room made for the doors. There was
one expression upon every face&mdash;an expression of pained and
physical distaste, which speedily became loathing. People who
had strolled towards the exits commenced to hurry; others from
the remote ends of the room pressed behind them. Finally the
players at the tables with one accord rose to their feet, some
of them clutching at the money in front of them, some of them
abandoning it.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>There seemed to be a faint white mist drifting about the room
and becoming thicker every moment, and apparently from it there
was emitted the most terrible, stupefying and noxious smell
which ever greeted the nostrils of any human being. Every second
it became stronger. The manager opened his mouth to give an
order, but his lips were powerless. He rushed for the door with
the others. In less than sixty seconds the passages leading into
the Hotel de Paris and the stairway&mdash;luckily a broad
one&mdash;leading into the street were packed with a seething
mass of shrieking, coughing, half-fainting people. Two of the
servants made an heroic effort to open the windows and fell
overpowered. The occupants of the bar joined with the waiters in
a mad rush down into the back quarters. Here and there a woman
fainted. One man, black in the face with coughing, threw himself
over the banisters on to the tables below. In an incredibly
short space of time not a soul remained in the roulette room,
except one. Doctor Stranz, with a respirator over his mouth,
strange-looking spectacles, and flaps over his ears, looked
around him with a smile half-satanic, half beatific.</p>

<p>"That was good," he said to himself. "Before, it was I who
felt sick at heart in these rooms. Now, it is they who feel sick
at the stomach!"</p>

<p>At a few minutes after ten o'clock on the following morning,
the card of Monsieur Louchette, the manager of the Sporting
Club, was brought in to Mr. Billingham, and Monsieur Louchette
himself promptly followed. Mr. Billingham welcomed him with a
grin.</p>

<p>"Say, that was some trick the Austrian played us!" he
observed as he shook hands.</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette was a man destitute of any sense of
humour. For five minutes without ceasing he talked and Mr.
Billingham listened in admiration.</p>

<p>"And then some," the latter remarked, when through sheer lack
of breath his visitor became silent. "But say, to get down to
business, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"The police search now for the rascal," Monsieur Louchette
declared. "He shall be made to pay damages. He shall be
imprisoned. Such an outrage has never before been known!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham stretched out his hand for a cigarette and
thoughtfully lit it.</p>

<p>"I don't know how the law goes on this side," he remarked,
"but in my country I'm not sure as it's a criminal offence to
make a smell,&mdash;even if it could be proved that he did
it."</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette was off again. A smell! It was in such
cold-blooded fashion that his friend Mr. Billingham could allude
to the ghastliness of what had happened? There had been a
soldier there who had declared that never in his worst
experiences of the war, when they had been caught without masks,
had anything so hideous crept into their nostrils. There were
ladies lying sick in their rooms in every hotel in Monte Carlo.
The lost property office was besieged by an endless stream of
men and women who had thrown away everything to escape from this
horror. And Mr. Billingham could call it "a smell"!</p>

<p>"It was nifty," Mr. Billingham admitted, when at last the
manager had once more come to a pause. "I worked once in a
tan-yard when I was a boy and I have been down in the hold of a
Chinese yawl and I know San Francisco pretty well, but I guess
the Doctor had all other smells beaten to a frazzle.
Fortunately," he went on, "my young friend, Mademoiselle de
Felan, and I were near one of the doors, and we got away slick.
If it is a fair question, Monsieur Louchette, what do you really
think you're going to do about the fellow?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette's former eloquence seemed vapid compared
to his present expressions. The mad Austrian, it appeared, was
to be drowned in burning oil, guillotined and deported. In the
midst of it all there was a modest knock at the door and Doctor
Stranz was announced.</p>

<p>"I do not intrude, I trust," he said. "I wished for a word
with my friend Mr. Billingham. Ah, it is Monsieur Louchette, the
manager of the Sporting Club. Good-morning Monsieur Louchette.
Are your rooms aired this morning, and what about my money?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette sprang forward, but Mr. Billingham's firm
arm restrained him. Nothing, however, could check the torrent of
speech which proclaimed his opinion of the newcomer, his
intentions with regard to him, and his certain future. Doctor
Stranz listened with amusement.</p>

<p>"That policeman," he confided, "he has been to see me
already, but what can I do? There was a smell in your rooms last
night. Who knows that I made the smell, and, if I did, what is
the law against one who makes a smell? Your policeman he has
gone back to consult a judge. I have done nothing. I want my one
hundred and forty thousand francs, but I have done nothing. If I
get my money and I leave, perhaps there will be no more
smells."</p>

<p>"Apart from everything else," Monsieur Louchette found breath
to say, "there was money missing last night from the croupier's
box near where you were seated."</p>

<p>Doctor Stranz drew himself up with dignity.</p>

<p>"I am a man of great honour," he declared. "I have never
stolen from anybody. All that I took with me from the Club last
night I won. Why do you not give me back my one hundred and
forty thousand francs? Then I think there will be no more
smells."</p>

<p>"You rascal!" Monsieur Louchette gasped. "You will never
cross the portals of the Club again. Your name has a black mark
against it for ever. Before the day is out you will be in
prison."</p>

<p>"I think not," was the mild reply. "I think no man can go to
prison in Monaco for making a smell&mdash;if I did. So you keep
me out of the Sporting Club, eh? Listen, you give me my one
hundred and forty thousand francs and I will leave tonight."</p>

<p>"I will see you in hell first!" Monsieur Louchette
thundered.</p>

<p>"What a pity!" Doctor Stranz sighed. "Mind you, I do not say
I have done anything, but I tell you this, there is not in the
world any chemist so clever as I&mdash;not in the whole world,
mind. You think once more."</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette broke partially away from Mr. Billingham,
and Doctor Stranz made for the door. On the threshold he looked
back. "You make a mistake&mdash;a great mistake!" he called out,
departing and slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>"What do you know about that!" Mr. Billingham exclaimed.</p>

<p>Monsieur Louchette took up his hat.</p>

<p>"I came," he declared, "to ask if you could tell me anything
more about this man."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that he was in charge of a poison gas factory
during the war," he said. "I had a plant in the same city making
aeroplane wings. That's how I came across him. 'The Stink
Wizard' they called him."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he has really lost one hundred thousand
francs at the tables?" Monsieur Louchette asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am not a heavy player myself," he replied. "I have seen
him get through quite a pile, but I kept no tabs on him."</p>

<p>"Anyway," Monsieur Louchette remarked with satisfaction, "he
won't get to the Sporting Club to-night."</p>

<p>"I guess there are a good many others who won't either," Mr.
Billingham opined.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham and Madelon dined alone that evening. The
latter was a little nervous; Mr. Billingham inclined to be
facetious.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," he announced, "I have been to the Law
Library up at Monaco with an interpreter. So far as I can see
the penalties against a maker of smells are purely nominal."</p>

<p>"There are other things," Madelon reminded him. "I hear
Monsieur Louchette complains that a great deal of money was
taken."</p>

<p>"Doctor Stranz assures me that he did not take anything with
him except what he won," Mr. Billingham declared. "I guess he
was telling the truth."</p>

<p>"What did Monsieur Louchette say this morning?" Madelon
enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham grinned.</p>

<p>"If the Doctor had not made a somewhat inopportune arrival in
my rooms," he replied, "I'm dead sure that with careful
handling, Louchette would have opened his pockets. As it was he
lost his temper, but if to-night&mdash;well, we shall see! I
hear there are twenty-four detectives in the Club and if Doctor
Stranz tries to put in an appearance there will be trouble.
Fortunately he won't."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad," Madelon sighed, "when he is out of
existence altogether."</p>

<p>"Don't say that," Mr. Billingham begged. "He has given a
little colour to a somewhat dull period. Besides which he
promises to be an extremely profitable creation."</p>

<p>"Money, always money!" she sighed. "I wonder whether I am
getting tired of being an adventuress."</p>

<p>He looked at her a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"There is another world," he said quietly&mdash;"a world
where pleasure is less of a business, perhaps, and
happiness"</p>

<p>"You are going to make me sentimental," she interrupted.
"Come, we must have our coffee and it is time that we went."</p>

<p>"The first table to the left in the 'Kitchen,'" Mr.
Billingham reminded her firmly. "I shall meet you in the
gardens&mdash;the seat I showed you. You
have&mdash;everything?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you not see in how careful a fashion I am carrying, my
bag?" she asked.</p>

<p>A small crowd of detectives awaited developments in the
Sporting Club that evening and a lackey stood by each window.
Nothing whatever happened. At half-past eleven, however, the
events of the night before were repeated with even more
terrifying consequences in both the Casino and the Salons
Prives. Precautions had been taken here also with regard to the
windows, but the spread of the fumes was too rapid and
stupefying to allow of more than one or two being opened. The
crowds which thronged the two rooms gave even more poignant
evidences of terror and panic than the visitors to the Sporting
Club on the previous evening. Several croupiers attempted to
keep their places but fell forward in a moment or two
overpowered. As a safeguard the various exits to the Salons
Prives had all been thrown open and from here the flight,
although precipitate, was conducted with a certain amount of
order. The Marquis, who had been seated next to a croupier at
one of the end tables, seemed to have possessed himself of some
of the perquisites of the absent Doctor Stranz. At the first
symptoms of alarm he slipped a respirator over his mouth,
spectacles over his eyes and flaps over his ears. He sat there,
watching the scene for a few moments with every appearance of
interest. To his amazement, notwithstanding the general exodus,
two women, who had been playing on the other side of the table,
also remained in their seats, although they gazed around them
with many exclamations of astonishment. The Marquis looked at
them, then at the wheel which he longed to spin, and the brass
box with the mille notes which he longed to investigate. His
whole environment was irresistible. He produced from his pocket
a hundred franc plaque and four louis, and held them poised in
his left hand. With his right forefinger he spun the wheel.</p>

<p>The ball sped round in jerky fashion and alighted in number
twenty-nine. The Marquis adjusted his eyeglass, to be quite sure
that there was no mistake, and promptly deposited his counters
upon the number indicated. With painstaking care he counted out
from the croupier's well six thousand, three hundred francs,
stuffed the amount into his pocket and rose to his feet. One of
the women who had been regarding him intently&mdash;the fatter
and fairer of the two; a woman wearing a dress of bright blue
silk and a heavy gold chain around her neck&mdash;turned to her
companion, who was obviously her daughter, a smaller replica of
herself. In her excitement she spoke in German.</p>

<p>"Gretchen," she cried, "where do they all go, these
people?"</p>

<p>The daughter sniffed the air for a moment, her fat little
nose uplifted.</p>

<p>"I am not sure, but I think they smell something, Mother,"
she announced, also in German.</p>

<p>The Marquis abandoned his solitary amusement, rose sadly from
his place and walked across the room, strewn with evidences of
feminine flight, towards the lift.</p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Billingham still slept upon the following morning,
there was a knock at his door and Monsieur Louchette was
announced. It was a very chastened Monsieur Louchette. He was
accompanied on this occasion by another functionary whom Mr.
Billingham recognised as one of the principals of the
Casino.</p>

<p>"Say, you're bright and early!" Mr. Billingham complained,
sitting up in bed and yawning.</p>

<p>"We apologise," Monsieur Louchette said, "but the
circumstances may perhaps excuse us. We have searched the place
for this man Doctor Stranz. We cannot find him."</p>

<p>"We seek your aid," the other functionary confided.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham swung out of bed and wrapped himself in a
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he explained, "this man is no friend of mine,
but he has asked me to respect his confidence as to his
whereabouts. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"We are prepared to make terms," Monsieur Louchette
announced.</p>

<p>"In that case," Mr. Billingham replied, "take a seat. Order
some coffee if you will and wait whilst I have my bath. Doctor
Stranz will be here at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Stop!" Monsieur Louchette exclaimed. "Mr. Billingham, you
are a well-known citizen of a country we respect, your name and
reputation are beyond question. Will you undertake negotiations
for us with this abominable person?"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham considered the matter.</p>

<p>"Why, I should say so," he consented. "What's the great
idea?"</p>

<p>"He says that he has lost one hundred and forty thousand
francs," Monsieur Louchette continued drearily. "We have that
sum here in notes. We will give it to him provided you can
extract some guarantee that the proceedings of last night and
the night before shall never be repeated by him, or by any one
else with his connivance or help."</p>

<p>"It seems a lot of money to part with," Mr. Billingham
observed.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is the decision of the Council," Monsieur
Louchette replied. "One hundred and forty thousand francs is a
great deal of money, but a repetition of the scenes of the last
two nights would be utterly and entirely disastrous. If you can
arrange this matter for us, Mr. Billingham, the Societe de Bains
de Mer will consider themselves in your debt."</p>

<p>"I guess I can fix it if any one can," Mr. Billingham
promised. "Leave the money and come back at half-past ten."</p>

<p>They left the money.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham had chosen a table that morning on the terrace
at the Reserve Restaurant at Beaulieu. A striped umbrella
sheltered him and his guests&mdash;the Marquis and
Madelon&mdash;from the sun. The west breeze across the bay was
only a delight. Furthermore, Mr. Billingham had ordered the
luncheon with peculiar care. There was caviare&mdash;the only
pot in the south of France&mdash;served with ice and
lemon&mdash;large caviare, dull, of the colour of olives,
procurable only by an epicure of boundless means and boundless
influence with those who control the kitchen. Then there was a
bouillabaisse, to serve which the chef himself had arrived from
the kitchen; a chicken which was a speciality of the house; wild
strawberries, prepared with red wine; and a cunning mixture of
liqueurs. Champagne followed the Chablis, and the brandy was
served from a bidon. The whole meal was a wonderful effort.</p>

<p>"Never have I eaten better," the Marquis declared, as he
selected a cigar.</p>

<p>"A banquet!" Madelon murmured. "And now, please tell us
everything."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham lit his cigar.</p>

<p>"I thought that for this little celebration," he explained,
"we were perhaps just as well outside Monte Carlo. However, the
news is of the best. The Societe de Bains de Mer has granted
Doctor Stranz a viatique of&mdash;what do you think?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand francs," the Marquis guessed.</p>

<p>"Don't keep us in suspense," Madelon begged.</p>

<p>"Of one hundred and forty thousand francs," Mr. Billingham
announced impressively. "The forty thousand francs I have
already parted with."</p>

<p>"For the smells?" Madelon exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Precisely&mdash;and to cover Doctor Stranz's losses, which I
understand amounted to nearly four milles. If ever I need a
friend who can make smells he is at my service. I had hard work
to escape from his embraces."</p>

<p>"And the remaining one hundred thousand?" the Marquis
gasped.</p>

<p>"The remaining one hundred thousand is for us three," Mr.
Billingham declared.</p>

<p>The Marquis' fingers trembled.</p>

<p>"It is incredible!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"It is the adventure of our lives!" Madelon faltered.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham produced three packets of mille notes; one he
returned to his own pocket, the other two he handed to his
companions.</p>

<p>"Marquis," he said, "I congratulate you. The idea was mine,
but a considerable part of the execution was yours and
Mademoiselle Madelon's. The organisation certainly never dreamed
that the real Doctor Stranz left Monte Carlo twenty-four hours
ago, perfectly well content, with my forty thousand francs in
his pocket. They believe that he departed at noon to-day with
one hundred and forty thousand. However, the result to them is
the same and they can afford the money. They paid that the
contretemps of the last two nights might not happen again. They
will have value for their money. Those contretemps are
finished!"</p>

<p>"We only had six little bottles," Madelon remarked.</p>

<p>"You have now a little over thirty-three thousand francs in
your pocket, Marquis," Mr. Billingham concluded. "You will not
reproach us any longer, I trust, with those few efforts towards
philanthropy which have wasted some of our time. On this
occasion we have taken the great lesson to heart that
philanthropy begins at home. There is also a little trifle which
we have not mentioned&mdash;a little trifle to which I believe
you helped yourself."</p>

<p>The Marquis coughed.</p>

<p>"I helped myself to nothing that I did not win," he replied.
"Incidentally I discovered&mdash;the night of the second
smell&mdash;how to win at roulette."</p>

<p>"Tell us," Madelon begged.</p>

<p>"That might be worth hearing," Mr. Billingham observed.</p>

<p>"Stake your money," the Marquis said impressively, "after the
ball has ceased to roll!"</p>

<h3>First published in <i>Collier's Weekly</i>, 27 Jun 1925</h3>
<hr>

<br>

<p class="first">MONTE CARLO, on a moonless night late in May,
is not without its sombre effects. Mr. Billingham, loitering on
that extension of the Terrace promenade which passes the
post-office and reaches to the bottom of the hill, took note of the
changed aspects of the place during the last six weeks. The
Sporting Club, once gaily illuminated, with blue-liveried
servants waiting at the top of the steps to welcome visitors,
and rows of automobiles drawn up against the pavement, was
closed and dark. The great hotels which lined the hills no
longer presented a semicircle of glittering lights. Here and
there a few lamps twinkled out from the different villas, but,
for the greater part, the hillside had become a chaos of
unbroken blackness.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, standing with his back to the stone
balustrade, smoking thoughtfully and looking landwards, was
suddenly aware of a touch upon his arm. He turned abruptly to
find Madelon by his side, a black silk cloak thrown over her
evening gown. Her approach had been, perhaps purposely,
noiseless. She seemed to have crept out of the void.</p>

<p>"Useless!" she laughed. "I came to make discoveries and
behold I find you alone and apparently star-gazing."</p>

<p>"Not star-gazing," Mr. Billingham murmured.</p>

<p>"Seriously, I am disappointed," she went on. "I thought there
must have been some reason for these mysterious nocturnal
strolls of yours."</p>

<p>"There is a reason," Mr. Billingham confided. "An
assignation?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Look carefully," he directed, "exactly where I am pointing
and tell me whether you see anything."</p>

<p>She stood by his side and obeyed.</p>

<p>"I see something," she admitted, "which looks like a
rapidly-moving glow-worm, appearing and disappearing."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham nodded.</p>

<p>"I will tell you what it is," he said. "It is someone with an
electric torch moving about in a room of an hotel which is
closed for the season."</p>

<p>"A caretaker, perhaps," she suggested.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he assented. "Yet one wonders why a caretaker
should be wandering about always in the same room at night-time."</p>

<p>"He may be sleeping there," she observed.</p>

<p>"Then why not use the electric light in an ordinary way?" Mr.
Billingham rejoined. "Of course," he went on, "there may be a
very simple explanation. There probably is. Yet there are other
things which have made me wonder about that light."</p>

<p>"As, for instance?" Madelon demanded.</p>

<p>"The first time I noticed it there was just a little
moonlight and I could see that the light came from the fifth
window of the third story of the Hotel d'Angleterre. It was at
that hotel, as I dare say you remember, that Seth Dickerson, the
American who had been gambling so heavily, committed suicide a
week or two ago."</p>

<p>"I remember," Madelon murmured. "They closed the hotel
because of it a few days earlier than they meant to."</p>

<p>"Just so," Mr. Billingham agreed. "And the hotel has remained
closed ever since. There is no caretaker in it. Whoever is
moving about that room with an electric torch is an
intruder."</p>

<p>"An empty hotel!" Madelon mused. "It doesn't sound exactly
like a happy hunting-ground. And why that particular room? The
poor fellow committed suicide because he had lost every penny he
possessed at the tables."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham did not reply. He was watching the faint
flashing of the light. Sometimes it disappeared altogether for
several minutes. At no time was it more than a glimmer.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he said at last, "whoever is moving about
that room is searching for something. You see the light is
turned in every direction, but never for a moment straight at
the window."</p>

<p>"Shall we go up?" she proposed.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not to-night," he replied. "To-morrow morning I shall call
upon the manager of the Royalty Hotel, which belongs to the same
people. If you are interested you can come with me."</p>

<p>She thrust her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," she begged, "let us go to the Casino. I am
rather uneasy about my uncle. He has borrowed no money for two
days and he is becoming mysterious."</p>

<p>The manager of the Royalty Hotel and Mr. Billingham were from
the first on the best of terms. Mr. Billingham in a very few
words explained his mission.</p>

<p>"That poor chap Dickerson's folk have been writing to me," he
said&mdash;"the fellow who committed suicide over at the
Angleterre, you know."</p>

<p>"That affair is all finished with," the manager exclaimed
hastily. "The hotel at first paid for the funeral and all
expenses, but the Societe has now refunded the amount."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Mr. Billingham declared good-humouredly.
"Seth Dickerson's people don't want any fuss any more than you
do. Theirs is just a sentimental idea. They want me to have a
look at the room where he died and send them a few trifling
particulars."</p>

<p>"Delighted to do anything we can for you, Mr. Billingham,"
the manager assured him cordially. "Mr. Dickerson's clothes and
effects were all sent to an address in London, as I dare say you
know. The loose change on his table was given to the servants.
It amounted to less than their weekly tips."</p>

<p>"That's quite all right," Mr. Billingham observed. "Naturally
a fellow like Dickerson don't commit suicide while he's got
anything left. How can we have a look at the room?"</p>

<p>"Christian, the concierge of the hotel, has the keys," the
manager replied. "He is here now helping our own man. I will
send for him."</p>

<p>He touched a bell, sent a message, and a few minutes later a
tall, remarkably fine-looking man, in the uniform of the hotel,
entered the room. He saluted Mr. Billingham, whom he knew
slightly, and smiled at the young lady. To all appearance he was
the absolute prototype of his class; brimful of knowledge, which
he was only too anxious to impart, capable and good-tempered.</p>

<p>"This gentleman," the manager explained, "has heard from the
relatives of Mr. Dickerson in America. He wants to have a look
at the room Mr. Dickerson occupied."</p>

<p>For a single second there was something beyond ordinary
interest in the man's face. Mr. Billingham, who had been
watching him closely, took note of it.</p>

<p>"There is nothing belonging to Mr. Dickerson left in the
room, sir," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"Quite so. I know that," Mr. Billingham intervened. "It's
just an idea his people have. Want me to tell them when I get
back what sort of a place it was he ended his days in. Silly
idea&mdash;but folks are silly sometimes."</p>

<p>"You had better take Mr. Billingham and the young lady
across," the manager directed.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," the man acquiesced. "If you and the young
lady will step this way, sir," he continued, turning to Mr.
Billingham. "I have the keys in my pocket."</p>

<p>They took leave of the manager and crossed the street towards
the Angleterre. The concierge opened the front door of the hotel
and they passed into an atmosphere of gloom and silence. There
were dust sheets over the mahogany counter and the cushions of
the lounge; a faint odour of tea leaves and disinfectants
everywhere.</p>

<p>"I shall have to trouble you to come up the stairs, sir,"
Christian observed. "The lift is not running."</p>

<p>"On which floor was Mr. Dickerson's room?" Mr. Billingham
enquired.</p>

<p>"The third, sir," the man replied.</p>

<p>They mounted the stairs in silence. In the corridors the
sound of their footsteps awakened faint echoes. Even the stair
carpets had been taken up and stood rolled together in corners.
The concierge led them unhesitatingly to the door of a room
which he unlocked and threw open.</p>

<p>"This was Mr. Dickerson's apartment, sir," he announced. "He
shot himself in the easy-chair over there."</p>

<p>It was a bedroom of the plainest possible description;
spotlessly clean, bare now of carpet or even rugs, bedstead
dismantled&mdash;an epitome of dreariness. There was a little
dust on the floor and a little rim of dust which Mr. Billingham
noticed as the door was opened. He looked around him in some
perplexity.</p>

<p>"How long has this room been closed up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About a fortnight, sir."</p>

<p>"And you are sure that this is the room Mr. Dickerson
occupied?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, sir."</p>

<p>"During that fortnight," Mr. Billingham persisted, "has any
one entered it at all?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir," was the confident reply. "No one has
entered the hotel that I know of."</p>

<p>The man stood, the keys in his hand, patient yet obviously
anxious to bring this visitation to a close. Mr. Billingham
walked to the window, opened it and stepped out on to the
balcony. He looked to the left. There were five windows to be
counted. The one through which he had passed was the sixth.</p>

<p>"Have any of these rooms got more than one window?"</p>

<p>"The next door one has, I believe, sir," the man answered,
looking a little puzzled.... "Is there anything further I can
do for you, or the young lady?" he added, after a moment's
pause.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked around once more regretfully and
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not," he decided. "It's a poor room, this.
Pretty hard up towards the end, I expect."</p>

<p>The concierge nodded.</p>

<p>"They stripped him clean, sir," he agreed. "It's a way they
have down yonder...."</p>

<p>The three descended the stairs almost in silence. Christian
led them into the street, and Mr. Billingham handed him a twenty
franc note.</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, sir," the man said. "You are
sure there is nothing more I can do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, thank you," Mr. Billingham assured him. "I
will just have a word with your manager...."</p>

<p>They re-entered the Royalty Hotel. Mr. Billingham with
Madelon still by his side made his way to the bureau. The
manager looked up and nodded.</p>

<p>"Satisfied your curiosity, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham glanced behind him to be sure that the door
was closed.</p>

<p>"I guess not," he answered gravely. "I'm afraid there's a
little trouble ahead."</p>

<p>The manager's jaw dropped. Like all hotel proprietors he
disliked trouble of the sort indicated by his visitor.</p>

<p>"Why, what is wrong?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"In the first place," Mr. Billinghara enquired, "what was the
number of the room occupied by Seth Dickerson?"</p>

<p>"Number 167," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Now your concierge Christian deliberately took us
to 168 and showed it to me as the room occupied by Seth
Dickerson."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine how he could have made such a mistake," the
manager remarked, with a perplexed frown. "He knows the hotel
inside out."</p>

<p>"Oh, he knew all right," Mr. Billingham observed dryly. "Tell
me now, have you keys to the hotel yourself, as well as the set
Christian has been using?"</p>

<p>The manager opened his drawer.</p>

<p>"Certainly I have."</p>

<p>"And a pass-key to the rooms?"</p>

<p>"I have both."</p>

<p>"Then I want you," Mr. Billingham begged, "to send Christian
out of the way for half an hour and to take us across
there."</p>

<p>The manager glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>"That is easy," he said. "I will send him down to the station
to meet the four-thirty. There is always the chance of a visitor
or two Excuse me!"</p>

<p>He spoke through a tube for a moment, then rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Of course," he continued, "I have not the least idea what
you are driving at, Mr. Billingham, but I am entirely at your
disposal. Come along, then!"...</p>

<p>They waited for a few minutes until the hotel bus had passed
the window, then once more they crossed the road, entered the
gloomy-looking building and mounted the stairs to the third
floor. This time the manager opened the door of number 167.</p>

<p>He had no sooner done so than he himself gave vent to a
little exclamation of surprise, and Mr. Billingham, following
close behind, whistled softly. The room&mdash;larger than the
neighbouring one, with two windows and curved balcony&mdash;was
in the wildest disorder. The carpet had been rolled back and was
lying "in an untidy heap upon the floor. The bedclothes had been
pulled over the bottom of the bedstead, drawers stood open, an
easy-chair had been overturned upon the floor and apparently the
whole of its stuffing removed. The manager looked around him in
blank amazement. Mr. Billingham was conscious of a feeling of
intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I'm going to put you wise to something, Monsieur Lavalle,"
he said. "You see for yourself that someone has made a
systematic search of this room. What do you think they wanted?....
 I'll tell you. They wanted the money Seth Dickerson won at
the Casino on his last night there."</p>

<p>"Won?" the manager repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Dickerson came home a ruined man. That's why he
shot himself."</p>

<p>"Dickerson did nothing of the sort," was the confident reply.
"That's what put me on the track of this trouble. I happened to
know the croupiers at the tables where he played and two of the
chefs. Seth Dickerson played at four tables on the night of his
death and he brought home with him to this hotel a matter of
between sixty and seventy milles. He had no more idea of
committing suicide that evening than I have at the present
moment."</p>

<p>"Then why did he?" the other demanded.</p>

<p>"He didn't," Mr. Billingham rejoined. "He was murdered."</p>

<p>Monsieur Lavalle had no words. It was Madelon who
intervened.</p>

<p>"Murdered!" she gasped. "By whom?"</p>

<p>"By Christian, the concierge," Mr. Billingham pronounced.</p>

<p>There was a moment's breathless silence. In the midst of it
Madelon raised a warning finger. From somewhere outside they
seemed to hear the sound of a muffled footstep. Mr. Billingham
moved to the door and looked out. There was no one in sight. He
closed the door again.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "I guess this is mainly conjecture, but I
have a sort of knack of putting things together and this is how
I build up this little affair. I knew Seth Dickerson. He wasn't
much of a man, but he wasn't the sort to use a gun against
himself, although I know he kept one handy. I saw him in the
Casino the night of his supposed suicide and he couldn't contain
himself&mdash;told me he had been winning at every table. I
asked the croupiers afterwards. They all said the same thing. He
had been losing before, but he had been picking it up all the
time that night. The long and the short of it is this. Seth
Dickerson left the Casino and came back to the hotel with a
packet of mille notes in his pocket and as nearly drunk as a man
may be and keep on his feet."</p>

<p>"He hadn't forty francs when his things were gone through,"
the manager objected. "The Societé de Bains de Mer paid
for his funeral."</p>

<p>"Just so," Mr. Billingham agreed, "but nevertheless he
brought home sixty milles with him and unless I'm mistaken the
sixty milles were at one time or another in this room. I've a
friend at Police Headquarters here and although not a word of
the proceedings at the inquest crept into the press, I got to
know all about it. When Seth Dickerson reached home that night
there was only one man up in the hotel. That man was your
concierge&mdash;a man with whom Dickerson was always too
friendly. He invited him up to have a drink. Christian went off
to get the bottle of whisky Seth ordered, and brought it up to
the room. When he arrived, I'm figuring it out that Seth had
hidden the sixty thousand francs or whatever it was. He was just
sober enough not to be an utter fool.</p>

<p>They sat and drank together, those two, and Seth bragged
about his winnings. When he did it, I don't know, but I reckon
that your man shot him when he sat in that chair drunk, went
through him for the money, failed to find it and got out scared.
Or it's likely enough that Seth told him he had hidden it
without telling him where. Anyway when he shot him he expected
to get hold of the sixty thousand francs right away. He couldn't
find them and he had to clear out. What happened then? The room
was closed up for a time, until after the inquest. No searching
was done because no one had any idea that there was anything to
look for. Your concierge knew, though. You closed the hotel and
I don't blame you. Your man didn't want to come in during the
day-time, although he had the keys, but for the last two nights
he has been ransacking this room."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" Monsieur Lavalle demanded.</p>

<p>"Because I have a fancy for moonlight strolls," Mr.
Billingham explained. "The last two nights, from the promenade
down below, I've seen some one hunting round here with an
electric torch. It fitted in with my own ideas, so I came to you
and asked to be shown this room. Just as I imagined he might,
Christian took me to the next room. I could see from below that
the room he was searching had two windows, because every now and
then the light disappeared,"</p>

<p>"There is someone outside," Madelon interrupted suddenly.</p>

<p>They all listened. There was nothing to be heard. The silence
of the great empty hotel seemed almost oppressive. Mr.
Billingham moved softly to the door and threw it open. He stood
there for a moment, listening, his right hand underneath his
coat. A peculiar gloom seemed to envelop the place. There was ho
one in sight, however, no sound to be heard. Yet, curiously
enough, Mr. Billingham had the same idea as Madelon. He felt
that there was someone near. He closed the door carefully and
this time he turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>"Christian killed Seth Dickerson all right," he declared,
"but as yet he hasn't lifted the money." Monsieur Lavalle took
out his handkerchief and dabbed his forehead.</p>

<p>"I do not understand, Mr. Billingham," he said, "how you dare
take all this for granted."</p>

<p>"Will you explain to me the lights in this room for the last
two nights, then?" Mr. Billingham demanded. "Will you tell me
why your concierge, when ordered to show me this room, showed me
the adjoining one? Will you tell me what all this disorder means
but a systematic search, and by whom? Who else has had access to
the place? No, sir, Seth Dickerson never shot himself. He lost
his life because he drank like a fool and hobnobbed with a
ruffian. The sixty thousand francs for which he was murdered are
in this room and I'm laying odds," Mr. Billingham concluded,
"that I find them within ten minutes."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that someone has searched the place pretty
thoroughly already," Monsieur Lavalle remarked grimly. "They
have torn the stuffing out of my chairs and ruined my
carpet."</p>

<p>"They have searched," Mr. Billingham admitted, "but they
didn't know what I know. Seth Dickerson had been a sailor in his
younger days and was just as handy with his needle as any woman.
They didn't remember that in the lapel of Seth's coat when he
was discovered there was a needle. I'm taking a chance,
perhaps," Mr. Billingham added, "but here goes!"</p>

<p>He produced a penknife from his pocket, and, moving to the
bed, ripped up one of the pink damask curtains which hung from a
movable brass rod at its side. He thrust his hand into the space
and a beatific smile parted his lips. Suddenly Madelon pointed
to the door. They followed the direction of her finger. There
had been no sound, but the handle was slowly moving. The door
was pressed inwards until the lock was strained. Mr. Billingham
withdrew his left hand from the interior of the doubled curtains
upon the bed, whilst his right hand went to his hip pocket. He
motioned Madelon over to his side, and pointed at the door.</p>

<p>"Open it," he whispered.</p>

<p>Monsieur Lavalle hesitated. The sight of Mr. Billingham's
gleaming revolver, however, reassured him. He turned the key.
Almost immediately the door opened. Christian, the concierge,
passed across the threshold. He seemed to bring with him
something of the ghostly silence of the great closed hotel. He
said not a word. He looked from one to the other and it was as
though a sudden lunacy had seized him. His cheeks were chalk
white, his gracious smile, his portly demeanour, his magnificent
self-assurance, were all gone. He was like a person stricken
with mortal fear. Nevertheless he did not flinch at the sight of
Mr. Billingham's revolver.</p>

<p>"I murdered Mr. Dickerson," he confessed. "He told me he had
eighty thousand francs. He was a fool to tell me. I murdered him
with his own gun. I knew they would bring it in suicide. I have
given myself away looking for the money."</p>

<p>"The money was here all right," Mr. Billingham observed.</p>

<p>Christian looked at him steadfastly, yet incuriously, looked
at the notes upon the bed, looked at the ripped up curtain.</p>

<p>"He put them there when I went for the whisky," he muttered,
in a dazed tone. "I thought I had searched the room, too!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Lavalle was standing at the bottom of the bed. He
seemed unable to take his eyes off his employee's.</p>

<p>"You must have been mad, Christian," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I was mad," was the dreary admission, "but eighty thousand
francs seemed a great deal against the life of a man who drank,
drank, drank until one could see him passing. I was mad. Now I
am not!"</p>

<p>He spoke so coldly and so entirely without any trace of
agitation that no one had any idea, until too late, of his
purpose. He crossed the room, and stepped out on to the balcony.
They saw him silhouetted for a moment against the sky, saw his
knee upon the balustrade, saw him go over&mdash;a shapeless
mass, a gleam of white from his face underneath&mdash;and
Madelon covered her ears with her hands. The two men stood
silent. From somewhere beneath, in that deep gulf of blackness,
came the sound, faint but unmistakable, of a dull thud. Mr.
Billingham thrust his revolver back in his pocket, and moved
anxiously to Madelon's side. From below they could hear the
sound of shrieking voices and pattering footsteps along the
gravel path.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham, like the vast majority of his compatriots,
thoroughly enjoyed the ministrations of an efficient barber. He
was just completing his second session of the day in the chair
of his favourite operator&mdash;a light, before-dinner
shave&mdash;when he happened to glance towards the door.
Mercifully his attendant had completed his offices with the
razor and Mr. Billingham's violent start and sudden leaping to
his feet were not accompanied by any disastrous results. With a
towel still around his neck he made for the door just in time to
confront a tall, thin, very obvious fellow-countryman who was on
the point of entering.</p>

<p>"For the love of Mike!" Mr. Billingham exclaimed. "Eli Herd!
Say, what are you doing here, anyhow?"</p>

<p>If Mr. Billingham's surprise at recognising his friend had
been great Mr. Eli Herd's amazement amounted to consternation.
He was a man of sallow complexion who wore gold-rimmed
spectacles and might presumably have been the subject of some
nervous affection. He shook hands time after time with Mr.
Billingham through sheer incapacity to do anything else.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he faltered at last, with belated eloquence.
"Some meeting, this!"</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong with linoleum, I hope," Mr. Billingham
demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>"Booming!" was the reassuring reply.</p>

<p>"Then, darn it all, why don't you look glad to see an old
friend?" Mr. Billingham insisted.</p>

<p>The newcomer made manifest efforts to regain some measure of
poise.</p>

<p>"Say, Samuel," he begged, "take that towel away from your
neck, get your hat and come right along with me."</p>

<p>His friend obeyed and the two men strolled off together.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the good news, anyway?" Mr. Billingham
enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Eli Herd was afflicted with another fit of silence. He
shook his head. He had apparently arrived at some mournful
resolution.</p>

<p>"Sam," he said, "we will sit down together at one of those
little tables outside the Café. You will
find&mdash;another friend&mdash;there. You shall know
everything!"</p>

<p>"What the hell is there to know?" Mr. Billingham, who was a
little irritable that evening, demanded.</p>

<p>"In three minutes," his companion groaned, "you will
understand why my meeting you like this has been something of a
shock."</p>

<p>In less than three minutes Mr. Billingham understood
perfectly. They crossed the Place in front of the Casino and
approached the solitary figure seated underneath one of the
striped umbrellas reading a newspaper. At their approach she
removed the newspaper for a moment from in front of her face and
promptly dropped it. If Mr. Eli Herd had been surprised to see
Mr. Billingham the lady was even more so.</p>

<p>"Samuel!" she cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Harriet!" Mr. Billingham gasped.</p>

<p>The lady rose to her feet. She was tall, goodlooking in a
severe way, of Junoesque proportions. She was somewhat severely
dressed in the costume of an American lady travelling round the
world with a suit-case.</p>

<p>"Say, what are you doing here with Eli?" Mr. Billingham
continued.</p>

<p>As usual it was the lady who possessed the courage.</p>

<p>"Eli and I," she announced, "are on our honeymoon."</p>

<p>"My God!" Mr. Billingham exclaimed. "What about me?"</p>

<p>"Our divorce," the lady went on, having now fully recovered
her composure, "was pronounced last month. You should have had
the papers by this time. In your absence there was no defence to
the charges which I was compelled to bring against you."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked helplessly around. A waiter, full of
unworthy suspicions, assisted him into a chair.</p>

<p>"Let me get the hang of this," he begged. "You've divorced me
and married my lawyer here, Eli Herd."</p>

<p>"Samuel, be calm," she enjoined.</p>

<p>"I'm calm enough," Mr. Billingham assured them, his voice
gaining strength at every moment. "Why didn't you let me know
about it all?"</p>

<p>"We thought it best to keep the matter to ourselves," the
late Mrs. Billingham explained. "Eli said that the divorce would
cost us less pronounced in your absence. Our separation, Samuel,
as you know, was irretrievable and final. I make no excuses for
my action. Eli has looked after my interests in your absence
with care and discretion. He is in a position, fortunately, to
release me from any financial obligations towards you."</p>

<p>"I've cleaned up a little lately in New York," Mr. Eli Herd
confided&mdash;"over a million on that Ardington deal, you may
have read about."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked around for a waiter.</p>

<p>Then his face fell.</p>

<p>"Only one way of celebrating an occasion like this," he
sighed, "and alas! that don't go with you folk. Still as hot on
prohibition as ever, Harriet?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Eli Herd coughed.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Samuel," she confessed, "although my
principles remain unchanged, Eli's health during the last few
months&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The doctor has been most insistent," the latter
intervened.</p>

<p>"At this time of the day," Mrs. Herd continued graciously,
"we have slipped into the habit of taking what I believe is
known as a 'champagne cocktail.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham fanned himself with one hand and summoned a
waiter with the other. His order was given in such terms that
within five minutes the suggested beverage was brought. He
promptly raised his glass.</p>

<p>"Well, here's how!" he said, a little weakly&mdash;"I mean,"
he went on, correcting himself, "my best wishes to you
both."</p>

<p>"Say, I'm glad you're taking this right, Sam," his friend
declared with an air of relief. "It didn't seem to me you'd any
kick, but still we didn't reckon upon coming upon you like this
before you'd heard the news."</p>

<p>"It might have been more considerate to prepare me," Mr.
Billingham remarked, "but we'll forget it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shall always wish you every happiness, Samuel,"
the lady went on, looking thoughtfully at her empty glass. "You
and I were wholly unsuited to one another. You must forgive my
saying that I looked for more principle and a more serious
outlook from a man to whom I gave everything. You, from your
point of view, required from me greater tendencies towards
frivolity than I was able to indulge in. You took no interest
whatever, for instance, in my work for the Women's National
Association."</p>

<p>"Or in your campaign for prohibition," Mr. Billingham
murmured under his breath as he replenished the lady's glass
from the bottle which the waiter, according to instructions, had
brought.</p>

<p>"My dear," he concluded, "let bygones be bygones. I bear
neither of you any ill-will. To-night I am engaged, but during
your stay here we must arrange a little dinner. Eli and I, too,
must have a talk about business."</p>

<p>Temporary addresses were exhanged. Mr. BilUngham bade his
friends farewell and made his way over to the Hotel de Paris,
where Madelon, seated at one of the little tables upon the
Terrace, was awaiting his arrival. She looked at him curiously
as he made his excuses, ordered the cocktails and called for the
menu.</p>

<p>"I will forgive you for being late," she said, "but tell me
who those strange people were to whom you were talking."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham sat down.</p>

<p>"One of them," he said, "was my wife."</p>

<p>"Your what?" Madelon exclaimed, with a very queer little note
in her tone.</p>

<p>"My wife&mdash;was a month ago, I mean," Mr. Billingham
explained. "She has just divorced me and married my lawyer. They
are on their honeymoon."</p>

<p>"And you didn't know?" Madelon gasped.</p>

<p>"Not an idea," was the emphatic rejoinder. "We parted many
years ago. We couldn't hit it off together. She is great on good
works and all that sort of thing. And now"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham broke off. He was looking across the Square.
In the distance he could just see Mr. Eli Herd replenishing his
companion's glass from the bottle. Suddenly Mr. Billingham began
to laugh. He laughed till the tears stood in his eyes. He
laughed till Madelon began to laugh too out of sheer
sympathy.</p>

<p>"What a ridiculous story I" she exclaimed. "And a ridiculous
situation!"</p>

<p>He wiped the tears from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Talk about adventures!" he murmured.... "Why, where is
your uncle?"</p>

<p>Madelon shook her head a little sadly.</p>

<p>"He is behaving queerly again," she confided.</p>

<p>"Borrowing money?"</p>

<p>"He didn't ask me for any at luncheon time," she admitted.
"He was looking dazed, though, and he scarcely spoke a word. I
saw him again later in the afternoon coming out of Wedderburn's,
the English solicitor's."</p>

<p>"Can't see how he could touch Wedderburn for anything," Mr.
Billingham observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He changed his clothes some time ago," Madelon continued,
"so when he does come out he will be ready for dinner&mdash;and
here he is," she added. "Look at him, on the steps."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham glanced towards the Marquis who was standing
with his hands behind his back, gazing out across the gaily lit
Square&mdash;lit not only with those tree-shaded electric
lights, but with the glamour of the moon which was just showing
from behind the hills. He stood for a moment like a man whose
thoughts had wandered away. Then with the utmost deliberation he
descended the steps and came towards them.</p>

<p>"I bet he's got it stiff," Mr. Billingham sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't care. He can have what he wants from me to-night."</p>

<p>"Are you really so happy?" Madelon whispered.</p>

<p>"There's one thing&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Madelon withdrew her hand&mdash;not abruptly, even, perhaps,
with some reluctance. A <i>sommelier</i> had invited Mr.
Billingham's attention to the wine-list, and before he had
departed the Marquis had entered, nodded to them both and taken
his place. He drank the cocktail which was immediately presented
to him, holding it for a moment a little away.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he begged, as he set down his empty glass, "if
my toast is a silent one. You will understand it better,
perhaps, when I tell you that I have paid my last visit&mdash;my
last visit as a gambler, that is to say&mdash;to that pleasing
but grotesquelooking edifice opposite."</p>

<p>"I thought so," Mr. Billingham groaned.</p>

<p>The Marquis leaned a little forward so that the few words he
had to say could be heard by both his companions. His elbows
rested lightly upon the table. His elegant finger-tips were
pressed together.</p>

<p>"My farewell," he confided, "is not of the nature you
imagine. To-day has been for me the wonderful day of which I
have always dreamed. I entered the Rooms at eleven o'clock this
morning with the scanty remains of a mille note in my pocket. At
luncheon time I deposited at the Credit Lyonnais the sum of six
hundred and fifty thousand francs. In the middle of the
afternoon I handed to my solicitor a further sum of four hundred
thousand francs. I have in my pocket&mdash;forgive the bulge,
which I know is most unsightly&mdash;a further two hundred and
eighty thousand francs."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham and Madelon exchanged glances, their
expressions instantly betraying one common thought. The Marquis
smiled tolerantly. From his waistcoat-pocket he produced a
banker's receipt to which was attached a receipt signed by Peter
Wedderburn for the sum he had mentioned. From the breast-pocket
of his coat he withdrew for an instant an enormous pile of mille
notes.</p>

<p>"Systems," he declared, "will never win or even hold their
own against the inevitable laws of chance. Inspiration may at
times make any man a fortune. The only reason why over there
they do not fear inspiration is because there is no man who wins
by reason of it, who does not lose by afterwards following a
false one. To-day I have been inspired. I started with two
modest en pleins. I found my numbers at every table. I increased
my stakes to maximums. I still won. In the 'kitchen,' before
lunch, I had broken every record known. I had had forty-two en
pleins for my three numbers, three-quarters of which were in
maximums. Not only the <i>en pleins</i>, mind you, but when I
saw this great wave of fortune I let myself go. I heaped on the
<i>carrés</i> and the <i>chevaux</i>. Nothing stopped me.
At the first sign of slackening off, however, I buttoned up my
pockets. I had been playing for two and a half hours only. I
lunched without a word to Madelori. I visited the bank. I
returned to the Cercle Prié with five milles in my pocket
and no more. At twenty minutes past four I had won seventeen
maximums on <i>en pleins</i> alone with many attendant stakes. I
was being followed about so that my progress became almost
uncomfortable. For years they will talk of my fortune. The banks
were closed, so I saw my friend Mr. Wedderburn, the lawyer, and
deposited my money with him. Thereupon I changed my clothes and
I returned to the Casino with five milles. I lost four and was
preparing to leave. With the last mille I once more struck that
amazing streak of luck. <i>En plein</i> followed <i>en
plein</i>. Fourteen, for instance&mdash;on which I had the
maximum with all the <i>carrés</i> and <i>chevaux</i>,
the transversal and the middle column&mdash;turned up four
times following. You could have heard the roar from the centre
table in the 'kitchen' outside in the Square. People left off
playing at every table to see what was happening. Twenty minutes
ago I lost three times following. I smiled. So often I have seen
these huge winnings returned to where they came from. I could
see it in the faces of the croupiers. I could feel it in the
atmosphere. I smiled. I buttoned up my pockets. I lounged
outside. I looked around at this beautiful scene. I strolled
across here. I dine. Roulette with me is finished."</p>

<p>"This," Mr. Billingham declared solemnly, "is the most
amazing evening I have ever known."</p>

<p>The Marquis talked on. He discussed his winnings calmly
without the least trace of excitement.</p>

<p>"I have always felt this in my blood," he declared. "It is
why I have been so persistent. But I will tell you a strange
thing. My great fortune has done this for me. I am no longer a
gambler. At the conclusion of our dinner this evening I am
telegraphing to Paris to my old friend, General Hernais, who has
three times lately begged me to share his apartment and his very
pleasant life in Paris. I am in a position now to do so. I
regret very much, my friend Billingham," he added, "to break up
so our pleasant little companionship, but you will, I know, not
blame me. For you, my dear Madelon," he concluded, "I shall make
whatever arrangements appeal to you most strongly. I need not
say that you will share to the fullest extent in my good
fortune."</p>

<p>Madelon squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>"You are a dear, Uncle," she said, a little vaguely. "I
cannot tell you how glad I am."</p>

<p>"Confessions and new resolutions seem to be in the fashion,"
Mr. Billingham observed. "I will make one. You do not know,
Marquis, although your niece does, that I have been married all
these months of our acquaintance."</p>

<p>The Marquis was evidently disturbed. Mr. Billingham, however,
continued without giving him an opportunity for speech.</p>

<p>"My wife," he went on, "has divorced me. We have not lived
together for many years. Our temperaments were entirely
different. Our marriage was a mistake and my freedom is very
welcome&mdash;especially as my late wife has found all the
happiness she desires with another man. Furthermore, my position
as an adventurer has been to a certain extent a fraud. All the
things which go with adventures are in my blood and part of my
life, but I sold out my business a few months before I came here
for a cash sum of over two million dollars and I still have an
interest in the firm."</p>

<p>"More than once I suspected it," the Marquis admitted, after
a breathless pause. "You had never the appearance of a poor man,
my friend Billingham."</p>

<p>Madelon's eyes were fixed upon her plate. For some reason or
another Mr. Billingham's confession had seemed to be lacking in
interest to her.</p>

<p>Presently the Marquis took his departure. Mr. Billingham
leaned across the table.</p>

<p>"Madelon," he said, a little hoarsely.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes and looked at him.</p>

<p>"It seems our partnership of three must come to an end," he
continued. "Would you&mdash;would it be possible&mdash;to start
a partnership of two?"</p>



<p>The surroundings were very wonderful, even inspiring. The
moon now was clear of the hills and the faintest of breezes
brought the perfume of the flowers from the gardens, and even of
the orange blossoms from beyond, across the Square. The
orchestra was playing in the Café. It was all very
beautiful, but the most beautiful thing that Mr. Billingham had
ever seen in his life was the strange softness in Madelon's eyes
and the little quiver of her lips.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we have coffee in your salon and then walk along
the Terrace and talk about it?" she whispered.</p>
