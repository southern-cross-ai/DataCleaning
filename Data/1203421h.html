<h3>MAJOR WARBURTON'S DIARY (accompanied by MAP) of EXPLORATIONS
in the NORTHERN PORTION of the PROVINCE, in 1866.</h3>
<br>
<p align="right">Adelaide, 4th December, 1866.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sir&#8212;I beg to lay before you a route sketch (which by the
kindness of the Surveyor-General has been drawn in the Survey
Office) of my late trip into the hush, and to annex a more
detailed report of my proceedings than I have before had it in my
power to submit.</p>
<p>I begin with my arrival on the Elizabeth. The waterhole at
which Mr. Babbage was camped in 1858&#8212;the best in the
creek&#8212;was quite dry, but we found sufficient water in some
holes half a mile higher up, on which I had camped eight years
before. The finding of this water led me to expect water in the
Yarra Wurta Creek.</p>
<p>At the Elizabeth, one of our horses, a large, soft-legged
animal, was found to have injured itself so much from the
hobbles, that I was obliged to leave it behind, and I
subsequently sent instructions to Mr. Roe, at Port Augusta, to
recover it.</p>
<p>Proceeding in a course a little westerly of north, we
commenced our journey to Yarra Wurta. To those who do not know
this country it will be sufficient to say that it is very bad
travelling; but as I had before passed over it about ten miles
eastward of our present course, where it was far worse, I was not
obliged to execrate our position in such forcible language as my
companions who had not the like advantage.</p>
<p>Ten miles brought us to a bit of sandhill country dotted with
pines. Here an accident befell us. Police Trooper Farquhar got a
most severe kick from a pack-horse just below the right knee;
fortunately no bones were broken, but his pain was so acute we
were obliged to halt at once. Thus we lost a whole day, and to
add to our loss one of the canteens was found to have a hole in
it.</p>
<p>I rode out to a place, about seven miles, at which I had three
rare before found a little water, but there was none now, and the
appearance of the country offered no prospect of my finding any.
Instead of the country improving in feed and water as I advanced
north, according to expectation, it appeared to be getting worse,
and worse, and my expectation of water at Yarra Wurta began to be
shaken.</p>
<p>Not expecting Farquhar to be able to ride more than ten or
twelve miles a day for some time, I decided that our only safe
course was to retrace our steps altogether, get to the eastern
side of Lake Torrens, and move up northward by the dray track.
This was a great disappointment, for, in addition to the loss of
time and increased distance of 200 miles for the horses, I had
the mortification of misleading my friend Mr. Ferguson, to whom I
had held out the certainty of reaching his station by my route
earlier than he could have done by the road.</p>
<p>I saw, however, no help for it, without incurring great risk
and heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>Next morning, when all were ready to mount, I questioned
Farquhar as to his riding powers. He was much better, though very
stiff, and not being a man to <i>make</i> difficulties, he
declared himself ready to ride all day and all night too if
required. Hearing this, I asked Mr. Ferguson which way he would
go&#8212;north or south? "Any way you like", was the answer.
"Well then, don't let us go hack, but take our chance", I
replied, and we started. I admit that I did wrong, I set aside a
deliberate opinion formed on good grounds, because I did not like
to go back, and my companions were willing to go forward.</p>
<p>We travelled over rough and heavy country till past sunset,
and camped with little feed and no water.</p>
<p>Next morning our horses had strayed for water, and our start
was later than usual, but we made about thirty miles just before
sundown, when it became evident that we had no chance of reaching
water that night. I observed that the horses were getting uneasy,
and showing bad symptoms; it was their third day on scanty, dry
food, without water. I well knew that if I once knocked them up,
and we should find no water at Yarra Wurta, we should be in evil
plight. I therefore unloaded them all, stacked the baggage on a
sandhill, and with nothing but a little flour, tea, and sugar,
started again, driving the horses bare-backed.</p>
<p>We camped about 8 p.m. on a bare, bleak point, near Lake.
Torrens. No fire, no damper, only a little drop of water each
into which we threw some meal thicken our supper. It was bitterly
cold, and we were short of clothing; the horses also had to be
watched all night.</p>
<p>We did not reach Yarra Wurta Creek till about 11 a.m. next
day, and we found it dry. One course alone was now open; we knew
positively there was water in Chambers Creek, forty miles distant
in a direct line, and to that point we had make the best our way
as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>It turned out eventually that there was water nearer to us but
in a different direction. We did not know then of these holes,
but even if I had known of their existence, without also knowing
the <i>certainty</i> of finding water in them, I should have been
afraid to run the risk the increased distance would have entailed
upon us in event of the holes being dry.</p>
<p>We rested a couple of hours at the creek, refreshed ourselves
with a little of our muddy water and meal, and gathered what
green thistles we could find. Started again at 1 p.m., and rode
on steadily till 9.30 p.m., when we calculated we were within
fifteen miles of Chambers Creek, and halted for the night. Our
horses were in a most pitiable condition, it was painful to look
at them, and they would not leave our fire; indeed, some of them
went actually into it, and stood there till they burnt
themselves. We were all hearty and well, though we had been two
days without any food, except a little meal and water, with bits
of Parakellia picked up as we crossed the sandhills. We divided
equally our last drop of water, each being left to do what he
liked with his share; how to make it go furthest was the great
question, and various devices were put in operation to attain the
desired object. One man put away a portion of his supper that he
might have a mouthful in the morning, but the ants got at it in
the night and damaged his breakfast. As for my friend Ferguson,
his only aim appeared to be how he could most safely and speedily
secure his scanty allowance in the place it was intended for,
then curl himself up in his saddle-cloth and go to sleep. He
effected both these objects in the space of about three minutes,
after which he was deaf alike to our jokes and our
forebodings&#8212;his picturesque outline and an occasional snort
being all we either saw or heard of him till next morning.</p>
<p>In the saddle again at daylight, and by 9.30 a.m., on our
fifth day without water, we and twelve of our horses reached
Chambers Creek, for which I trust we were all thankful.</p>
<p>Had I hesitated to abandon my kit when I did I should have
lost most of my horses; had I persisted in keeping it altogether
I should have lost them all and thrown away my own life; for
whatever my younger and stronger companions might have been able
to do, I could as reasonably have expected to fly as to walk
fifty or sixty miles over rough, heavy country without food or
water. As it was I lost one horse and Mr. Ferguson another, but
that was our only loss.</p>
<p>Finding some men mustering cattle at Chambers Creek we got
ample compensation in fat beef for our long fast. Mr. Ferguson
and two of my party went on the same evening to Mount Hamilton,
where Mr. Ferguson kindly lent me some fresh horses.</p>
<p>On Saturday we reached Chambers Creek; on Sunday evening my
men returned there with fresh horses. I engaged the services of a
man and horse to show my party new waters on a different line,
and on Monday morning they started back to fetch the kit, which
was eighty miles behind. I took our tired horses up to Mount
Hamilton on the Monday, and on the Saturday next, through the
activity and intelligence of Police Trooper Farquhar, all our kit
was safely brought up&#8212;not a strap missing. The men found
our knocked-up horse, and recovered the bell off its neck; it was
still alive, but unable to walk. Our difficulties had been great,
but our loss was trifling, and our goods were not damaged.</p>
<p>I feel pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to Mr.
Ferguson, of Mount Hamilton&#8212;a pleasant, cheerful, and
easily-contented companion in the bush, a most hospitable and
obliging host in his own house; he aided me in every way in his
power.</p>
<p>On the 11th July we left Mount Hamilton, having made up our
losses in horses by the purchase of three fresh ones from Mr.
Ferguson. On the 14th we reached the Mount Margaret Station.</p>
<p>Whilst at Mount Margaret, Mr. Jarvis, in charge of the
station, kindly gave me all the information he could about a
river which had been shown to him some time before by a black. I
was strongly impressed with the belief that this river must be
the Barcoo, and thought it would be of some geographical interest
to South Australia if this point could be decided. I purchased
three more horses at this station, and left on the 17th, taking a
north-easterly route by the Perry and Primrose Springs to the
upper part of the Macumbah Creek, which runs into the western
side of Lake Eyre. On the 20th we went down the creek to look for
water, which we found at about ten miles, and then struck off in
a north-easterly direction, crossed a large and fine plain to
some sand ridges, where we camped amongst a number of fresh water
lagoons.</p>
<p>After leaving the Macumbah Creek we had a few miles of poor,
stony ground, (never good except for a short time after rain),
but the large plain and sandhill country had excellent feed.
There is neither wood nor stone in this immediate locality; but,
in other respects, I can scarcely fancy any finer country for
stock.</p>
<p>When I first went through it in July the plain was covered
with grass and good saltbush, the sandhills were well clothed
with grass and with the herbage and flowers usually found on
them, most of the flats had water, and those that were dry were
covered with fine geranium, native clover, wild rhubarb, and a
creeper of which horses are very fond; there was almost every
variety of feed, and yet, as far as I could judge, there had been
no rain for many months. On passing through this country a second
time in September, many of the shallow lagoons had dried up, but
the feed was still finer than before, the sides of the sand
ridges were, in places, almost covered with the lilac-colored
flower of a creeper, and the flats were fringed with green
herbage, the deeper ones still retaining water. Impressions
formed from merely riding through a country, as I did, may not be
very trustworthy foundations on which to fix a permanent
occupancy. I can, however, only say what I saw, and what I
believe. I <i>saw</i> magnificent pasture, and I <i>think</i>
there need be no fear of want of water.</p>
<p>I halted on the 21st, intending to go myself to the head of
Lake Eyre, and return to camp. On looking for our horses in the
morning we found the blacks were driving seven of them away over
the plain, but on seeing themselves pursued they took to the
sandhills and so escaped what they richly deserved&#8212;the
stockwhip. I got to a northern point of Lake Eyre in time to take
the meridian altitude of the sun, latitude 27&deg; 50' 6" S., and
returned to my camp for Sunday's halt.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 23rd July, I went first to another northern
point of Lake Eyre, and got a second observation, latitude
27&deg; 50' 22" S.; then we proceeded in a north-easterly course,
passing some fine lagoons. For about ten miles we had steep
sandhills, much broken by the heavy flood of January, also a good
deal of boggy ground. Then we opened out to a large plain which
had been wholly inundated; here we found a good waterhole, and
camped.</p>
<p>Early next morning, travelling E.N.E., we cut a deep salt
creek on which we disturbed some pelicans; we were obliged to go
round the head of it. This creek frequently forced is out of our
course, it ran too much to the north, and was so boggy we could
not attempt to cross it. At thirteen miles it swept close under
some much broken and precipitous sand cliffs, then turned short
round to the eastward. This drove us into the sandhills, where we
found a shallow lagoon which was subsequently of some use to us;
but, leaving the sandhills as soon as we could, we followed the
course of the creek.</p>
<p>The sandhills, flanking the left or northern bank of the
creek, were steep and much broken at their ends, with poor feed,
but the valley of the creek was that miserable salt, soft dust so
generally found in such localities; the travelling was bad and
distressing to the horses. In the evening we turned into the
sandhills to camp. We had little feed and no water for our
horses, and no firewood for ourselves&#8212;an inconvenience I
fear to some of my party, as we had a sharp frost during the
night.</p>
<p>Next morning we went further into the sandhills to look for
water, which we soon found, and halted to rest the horses after
their hard work on the previous day.</p>
<p>Having observed that the creek opened out into a large saltpan
some miles a-head of me, I had intended keeping to the sandhills
till I had rounded the salt flat, and then to strike south as
soon as I could. The creek was so large and so long that I felt
assured it must either empty itself into Lake Eyre, or into the
river I was trying to reach, and in either case I must keep
outside of it.</p>
<p>Availing myself of our early camping, I rode out to see what
my prospects were. The sandhills run nearly north and
south&#8212;having their eastern slopes very steep, they get
worse as they extend towards the north-east. Their average height
is about forty-five or fifty feet, but some of them run over 100
feet. I found one very large brackish lagoon, on the edge of
which I nearly lost my horse in a quicksand, also a small shallow
fresh one, and returned to my camp without having seen much to
gratify me.</p>
<p>I this day allowed myself to be over-persuaded by two of my
party, who had taken a totally different view from my own of the
country we had passed over. They were positive as to having seen
a large, heavily-timbered creek, early the previous day, running
to the south. They conceived that I was mistaken as to the flow
of the salt creek, and that I was on the wrong side of it, so
that we should never reach the river on our present course. The
men were intelligent, and there was certainly no sign of the
river a-head of us. Knowing how often men do make the most
extraordinary mistakes in the bush, I never like to be positive
about anything that is not under immediate inspection, whilst my
companions used more confidence in expressing their opinions,
than caution in forming them. Suffice it to say I consented, and
began to retrace my steps on the 26th July. I nearly came to
grief in trying to cross my horses over the large salt creek at a
spot where I could cross on foot. We floundered about for several
days amongst a network of boggy salt creeks, not visible till we
got on their edges, and over none of which we could cross, found
ourselves hopelessly cut off from all chance of getting at the
river, and were compelled to return to the lagoon which I had
found on the 25th July, from whence I started on the 1st August,
to continue the course I had originally fixed upon. Thus six days
were added to our journey. I will not call them lost, for
exploring is not like ordinary travelling, nothing that is seen,
whether good or bad, is lost. I could have reached the river
sooner by adhering to my own views, for I had not made any of the
mistakes supposed, but then I should never have known the exact
character of the country which made that particular course the
only practicable one.</p>
<p>Keeping a general course of south-east, on the 1st August we
cleared the sandhills, and leaving some large saltpans and creeks
to our right, went up a small salt creek till we found a
crossing; then taking a southerly course across some more
sandhills, we came to the dry bed of a large fresh-water lagoon
almost surrounded by low sandhills. Comparing the extent of this
lagoon bed with the height of the sandhills, I was convinced that
mere drainage could not account for all the water that had at no
distant period been accumulated there, and I concluded that the
lagoon must be mainly due to an overflow of the river, and that I
must at last be approaching the object of my journey. We camped
on some nice waterholes in a shallow creek at the eastern edge of
the lagoon, our prospects were cheerful, and next morning we
struck the river in about four or five miles.</p>
<p>To give each day's work on the river in detail would be of no
public interest; I will, therefore, for the present discard
dates, and condense such information as it is in my power to
offer respecting a river which, though of no commercial value,
must rank next to the Murray in geographical importance.</p>
<p>As I firmly believe this river to be the Barcoo, and shall
speak of it as such, it may be well that I first state my reasons
for so doing.</p>
<p>Sturt discovered that portion of the Barcoo which enters the
eastern boundary of South Australia, and having no means of
knowing what it really was, called it Cooper's Creek, but Gregory
has since proved this to be a misnomer, by connecting it with the
Barcoo, or Southern Victoria, first discovered by Sir Thomas
Mitchell.</p>
<p>Sturt's map shows&#8212;if I may take this <i>dotted</i>
course as proof&#8212;that, after a due westerly course for some
distance, the Barcoo turns abruptly north-north-west, and running
a certain length in that direction, suddenly ends. I am under the
impression that Sturt, in his work, speaks of unexpectedly losing
Cooper's Creek, and of being unable to pick it up again. If I am
not mistaken on this point, then I should say, that so sagacious
and observant an explorer as Sturt <i>could not</i> have lost a
river which continued to cut for itself a distinct and deep
channel; and I may also affirm, that a river which rises at so
great a distance, and drains in its lengthened course so vast an
extent of the interior of Eastern Australia, <i>cannot</i> put an
end to its own existence in such a summary manner as that implied
on my supposition that a man of Sturt's experience and abilities
could not find out what had become of it. Either, then, the
Barcoo, where Sturt lost it, ceases to pour its occasional floods
down one deeply cut channel, and spreads its waters over an
extensive surface (not easily traced in such a very dry season as
fell to Sturt's lot), or else it conveys them by some underground
channel to some undiscovered basin. I reject this latter
supposition as being too improbable; and it must be remembered
that, like most other Australian rivers, the Barcoo is not always
flowing, for the greater part of the year it has long reaches of
still water, and chains of ponds, but when the tropical rains
rush in torrents to its bed, then it becomes a mighty river which
overflows its banks, and inundates every acre of level land for
ten or twelve miles on either side of it.</p>
<p>My belief is that the western end of Sturt's portion of the
Barcoo meets a large depressed plain, nearly on a level with its
own bed; here it cannot hew out a distinct channel, the water
will nowhere rest or rush on any particular line, but spreads
itself in every direction as fast as it flows&#8212;there is
nothing whatever to stop it. Now, if the map of my journey be
looked at, it will be seen that I have traced the river I was on
till after taking a north north-<i>easterly</i> direction, to
meet as it were, Sturt's north-north-<i>westerly</i> course, it
ends abruptly. When I tried to make a short cut by a more
easterly course, I did not know that the river terminated its cut
channel so abruptly, and, for a time, I lost the river as
completely as Sturt did; but after riding about twenty miles, and
finding no sign of a rivet before me, I turned sharp to the
northwest, and entered the plain into which I believe Sturt's
portion of the Barcoo flows.</p>
<p>The <i>nearly</i> level country extended for about twenty to
twenty-five miles, but that part which alone could be properly
called the bed of the Barcoo, was not more than about eight miles
wide where I crossed it. Had I then known what I now do, instead
of turning to the north-west to pick up the river, I should have
ridden on for another thirty miles, which would have put me on
Sturt's end of the Barcoo; but it was too late for me to do this
afterwards, for when I had gone over all the rest of the country
and found that there was no river in any other direction, I had
but barely flour enough left to carry me back to the "Peake",
travelling by the shortest cut, at a rate of thirty-five to forty
miles a day, whilst to do all I should have wished, would have
occupied me three weeks longer.</p>
<p>Along one part of the plain over which the Barcoo passes, for
a width of about one mile and a-half, ran what appeared in the
distance, to be a belt of gum trees, but on close inspection, the
trees were found to be far apart from each other. This broken
line of scattered gums marked either some slight depression, or a
better holding property in the ground, and pointed out where the
watercourse would have been cut, had the features of the country
admitted of one. The trees were gnarled and stunted, but their
being there at all, proved the existence of a watercourse, of
which they were the only visible signs, for gum trees are never
found in that country, except where water either flows or lodges
in holes.</p>
<p>I cannot picture faithfully this plain with the pen. To form a
correct idea of it, a man must ride over it, and let him
carefully scan the heavens before he does so. To be caught there
in a heavy shower (I say nothing of the river flood) would, in
all human calculation, be certain death. It is difficult and
distressing to ride over it when quite dry, so cracked and rotten
is it, but when wet, it must be next to an impossibility for
either man or horse to more upon it.</p>
<p>After crossing this bed of the Barcoo, and getting the
latitude 26&deg; 54' 34" south, I traced it down south, till the
sandhill country gradually closing in upon it on one side, and
the ground rising on the other, the water channel was picked up
by my branch of the Barcoo, and continued in one cut channel down
into Lake Eyre.</p>
<p>The river which I traced begins to cut a distinct channel
where the plain ends; it is not then, I think, unreasonable to
infer that the ricer Sturt traced, ceases to cut out a distinct
channel where the plain begins. The magnitude of the river I
traced, and the state of the ground on the plain, cannot be
accounted for by local drainage alone. This could not supply
sufficient water to produce such results. The soil of the plain
would probably absorb more than all the drainage for twenty miles
round, and if the river took its rise from the surplus drainage
of the plain, it would begin with a small and narrow channel,
increasing as its tributary creeks joined it; but this is not the
case, it breaks at once into the same deep, wide channel that it
carries all the way down, and its flood line is as extended near
where it begins as elsewhere.</p>
<p>A river, having its distant course in a mountainous country,
is suddenly lost sight of at one end of the plain, and another
river suddenly rises at the other end. I think this can only be
accounted for on the supposition that they are one and the same
river, having a break in the ordinary character of its
channel.</p>
<p>Though I now confidently express my opinion that the Barcoo
falls into Lake Eyre, and that I have traced it up to where it
breaks as described, yet such was not originally my view of the
matter. When I first found the river apparently taking its rise
in the plain, I concluded that I had missed the true river
channel, and had been following a north-easterly tributary. Under
this impression I turned back several days' journey to the only
place where I could have made this mistake, crossed the river and
went up the other bank, but there was nothing to be found beyond
a few creeks, all running into the river. One creek, indeed,
presented such extraordinarily high flood marks, that I had
doubts for a short time whether it might not be the true river. I
followed it from where I first struck it up to its source, and
subsequently ran down the remainder of it to its junction with
the river. When the river changed its course from eastward to the
northward of north-east it altered its appearance so much and
became so intensely salt that I then thought I was on a branch
only. We crossed with some difficulty and ran down the opposite
bank, till I had satisfied myself there was no other water
channel than the one I had been on.</p>
<p>Sturt describes O'Halloran Creek as one of considerable
magnitude, having its termination in a pool of blackish water
with fish. I do not believe in any such creek being able to
terminate itself; and I atone time thought that O'Halloran Creek,
like Cooper's Creek, might be a part of the Barcoo. To settle
this doubt I traced O'Halloran Creek from one end to the other,
and found it ran into the Barcoo. Having ventured to correct the
trifling misapprehension as to the termination of this important
creek, I am bound to say it was a mistake any man might easily
have fallen into. The course of the creek, below the pool, is
most tortuous and quite different to what it is
above&#8212;nothing but actual inspection could have carried
conviction to my own mind. I crossed one part of O'Halloran Creek
and could not believe I had done so, though assured of the fact
by one of my party, who had then seen more of it than I had; and
I feel assured that ninety-nine men out of a hundred would cross
the place at which this creek joins the Barcoo and not know it. I
should certainly have done so had not my attention been
particularly drawn to the spot by my companion, P.T.
Farquhar.</p>
<p>I have alluded to some of the doubts and difficulties into
which I fell to account in some measure for the time I took over
the work. I spared no labor that could help me to avoid mistakes;
and after a careful consideration of all the points that came
under my observation, I think the Barcoo may now be mapped with
approximate (I speak of my own work) accuracy from its source in
Queensland to its mouth in Lake Eyre.</p>
<p>The physical geography of Australia differs from that of most
other countries. Its rivers have peculiarities of their own. Who
would suppose that such a river as the Barcoo was perfectly dry
at its mouth? Yet such is the case for the greater part of the
year. In latitude 28&deg; 4' 39" the river enters Lake Eyre; for
four or five miles up, the bed is waterless, salt, and very
boggy&#8212;quite impassable. After this a little shallow, but
very salt, water appears; this deepens to latitude 27&deg; 53'
19", where a large salt creek meets it. This creek, when I saw
it, held as large a body of water as the river, and instead of
gliding in and joining the river, it meets it full in the face,
and the confluent waters pass off southward at a right angle. A
casual observer would suppose that the salt creek was a
continuation of the river&#8212;there is no flow, no change of
direction, no difference either in the color or depth and width
of the water, and instead of the recipient river being increased
by this affluent, its channel is narrower and less important
after the junction than before it.</p>
<p>Ascending the river, it presents some very fine, long reaches
of brackish water, 150 to 200 yards wide, covered with pelicans,
black shags, and wild fowl. Five or six miles above the junction,
the banks begin to get timbered&#8212;forests of tall marshmallow
stalks, dried up, and dense masses of polygon am fringe the
edges, which are in places much scooped out and broken. Where the
river runs through low or moderately-elevated country, heavy
timber, brush, and all the products of extensive and (as I
imagine) annual inundation mark its course. The water is nearly
all either salt or too brackish to be pleasant; but good water
can be obtained in most places, particularly where rushes are
found, by sinking a couple of feet in the sandy bed. The well may
be close to the bad water; this makes no difference.</p>
<p>There are also some wide reaches, which not being directly
connected with the river during the dry season, are able to hold
a good supply of fine, fresh water for the greater part, if not
the whole of the year; most of the creeks which fall into the
river, have some good holes high up, but they are either quite
dry, or give only salt water, where they enter it. The river
furnishes both salt and fresh water, but the former far exceeds
the latter, and like its tributary creeks, the lower you get down
it, the worse the water becomes; its bed is either extremely
boggy or dangerous, from quick sands, and care is required in
crossing horses over its best fords; sometimes many miles must be
traversed before a place can be found on which a horse will put
its foot.</p>
<p>It must be remembered, that I speak of this part of the Barcoo
as it stands in the driest time of the year; when flooded, I have
no doubt, all the water, above the salt creek junction, is quite
fresh; at such times, it must present a magnificent sight,
supposing a person able to get near it, which I do not think he
could do, except at a few elevated spots, for it lays all the
rest under water. Fish must be abundant, from the number of
places we saw where the blacks had been catching them, but I
think we were not in the fishing season, and we had no small net;
hooks did not appear to take their fancy; water fowl are to be
seen in countless numbers, but they are very shy, and those shot,
have a disagreeable trick of falling on the wrong side of the
river.</p>
<p>There is plenty of good pastoral country, specially on the
left or southern side, but all this useful land must, I think, be
cut off from profitable occupation till greater facilities for
reaching it are provided.</p>
<p>Leaving, undisputed, the good character given to the blacks of
the eastern and middle portion of the Barcoo, by others, I must
say, I formed a very unfavorable opinion of those on the western
portion; it would be tedious to detail their attempts to get us
within their power by deceitful cajoleries, and the rage they
exhibited when their disguised fondness for us failed to produce
its expected fruits; we were strong enough to meet any open
day-light attack, but this, they dared not make; their plan was
to lull all suspicion, and with the very effective aid of the
lubras, to mob us at night. In this, they would most probably
have succeeded, had they been allowed to have the chance, but
they made a great mistake in thinking I should give it them. We
were but four in all, but then we were well armed, and far too
quick in our movements to give them time to mature any scheme
against us; the only point upon which I was apprehensive was lest
they should ever succeed in chasing our horses away at night.
These natives are the men usually called salt water blacks;
cannibalism, perhaps, carries with it necessarily cowardice and
treachery&#8212;they are certainly cannibals, and for the
present, at least, the beneficent labors of the Protector of
Aborigines, would be entirely thrown away upon them. On one
occasion, a man of my party saw a corpse at the fire, in the
process of being cooked; and, as our visit was altogether
unexpected, the number of men and women collected in the camp,
could not have been in honor of us, neither were those present at
all chargeable with bearing about "the mockery of woe", as for a
deceased friend, though perhaps, their friendship for the
deceased had never been stronger than it then was; the funeral
and the feast are closely connected. On another occasion, a woman
who had picked up a few English words (and most probably a good
supply of English oaths), at Lake Hope, could find no stronger
excuse for tearing herself away from us, than that she was going
to have "tuk out" at the camp, off a blackfellow.</p>
<p>Some of the men are tall, well made and strong, most of them
seem&#8212;be their food what it may&#8212;well fed; the women,
for the most part are truly hideous and disgusting; all, old and
young, male and female&#8212;all strictly and scrupulously avoid
clothing.</p>
<p>Extracting briefly from my journal, I will no run through the
remainder of my journey.</p>
<p>On the 2nd August, I struck the right bank of the river; on
the 3rd, crossed it, and descended to within ten miles of the
mouth; having no water for the horses, I went up the riser agar
on the 4th, took the latitude of its junction with the salt
creek, and fixed my camp on a fine clay water, which we had
passed the day before. The 5th was Sunday. On the 6th, leaving my
camp standing, I rode with one man twenty miles across the
sandhills, and got the latitude of the mouth of the
river&#8212;the scene was one to look upon with awe. Lake Eyre
was dry, terrible in its death-like stillness, and the vast
expanse of its unbroken sterility; the weary wanderer, who, when
in want of water, should unexpectedly reach its shores, might
turn away with a shudder from a scene which shut out all
hope&#8212;he could hide his head in the sandhills, and meet his
fate with calmness and resignation, but to set his foot on Lake
Eyre, would be like cutting himself off from the common lot of
human beings. I had a cheerful companion, a good horse, and some
tea and damper, but I felt a dismal fascination in looking on
this lake, hardly knowing whether I saw before me earth, water,
or sky; and I could not help thinking what might have been my
feelings, had my circumstances been less happy than they
were.</p>
<p>Taking the latitude, 28&deg; 4' 39", of the mouth, we returned
to our camp that evening. On the 7th we went up the left bank of
the river&#8212;twenty-one miles, the country inferior, and in
parts much broken; but we found some good waters, and camped on
one.</p>
<p>On the 8th, twenty-five miles up the river, over some very
good country with pretty reaches of water&#8212;the trees were
larger, the flats more extensive, and the back clay waters more
numerous; towards the end of the day the country got worse, and
the river narrower.</p>
<p>This night we took it in turns to keep watch, knowing the
blacks were not far from us. About ten o'clock I could hear the
horses suddenly start off in a hobbled gallop, and supposing that
the blacks were driving them, we fired a rifle in that direction;
this showed that we were awake, and it had the desired effect,
but our horses were so frightened next morning that we could
scarcely get them to, or keep them at, our camp to be loaded.</p>
<p>On the 9th we made another twenty-five miles, cutting a creek
with fine waterholes, also finding good claypans, and many fiats
covered with grass (dry), and excellent saltbush; the creeks and
back waters timbered like the river.</p>
<p>On the 10th we made thirty miles, crossing over some very good
country with plenty of water. Cut a fine creek with long reaches
of fresh water, the "Ferguson", but the water became brackish as
it neared the river.</p>
<p>Shortly before camping we crossed, what I then took to be, two
large stony-bedded salt creeks running into the river. I could
not understand why two such wide watercourses should run close to
each other in parallel lines; but, subsequently, I learnt they
were the bed of the river itself which forked a little higher up.
These mistakes were of constant occurrence, it being often
impossible from one side of the river to see the water turns on
the other.</p>
<p>Next morning, the 11th, not knowing that I had in reality
crossed the river itself, I went northwards in the direction I
thought I had last seen it, and in a couple of hours we cut a
fine, deep, but not very wide river. I mistook this for my old
friend, but being still curious about the stony creeks I had left
behind, I steered a middle course, and ascended a moderately high
sandhill. I could not trace out the course of the river last
found, but I could sec the timbered coarse of the Barcoo running
towards the north-east. We went to it, and I then was satisfied
that I had crossed the river and found a new tributary. The water
last found being better than that of the Barcoo, we returned to
our old camp for the Sunday's halt. We had ridden upwards of
thirty miles this day, and though we did not progress on our
journey, I gained valuable information which I could not have
dispensed with.</p>
<p>On Monday the 13th, having cleared up most of our doubts, we
resumed our journey up the river, but on its right bank. Found a
fine, fresh waterhole in the bed of the river; had we discovered
this on Saturday it would have saved us a long ride.</p>
<p>On the 14th, thirty miles over very fair country, part of the
river wide and full of water, pretty to look at but bad to
drink&#8212;we are now getting out of the sandhills into open,
stony country.</p>
<p>A few miles after our start on the 14th the river took a
sudden turn to the north-west, it's bed continued wide but became
stony and broken into channels; the water was much discoloured,
shallow, slimy, and very salt. These complete changes led me to
think I had left the river and must be following a tributary, I
therefore crossed it to ascertain this point, and eventually
found that I was still on the river itself. We fell is this day
with some tame blacks, and camped near the clayhole on which they
were located.</p>
<p>Next morning I went with one man and a native to find a marked
tree of which the blacks had told us; we found two trees marked,
the one with HD conjoined, the other with GR, from these marks we
understood the 15.9.65 spot had been visited by Mr. Henry Dean,
of Lake Hope.</p>
<p>We started in the afternoon, north-north-east, over open stony
but well-grassed country. At ten miles I observed from the top of
a hill a fresh water lagoon bearing south-south-east about three
miles, and the river running to the northward and westward about
six miles distant.</p>
<p>This lagoon was one at which some trucculent-looking blacks
from Perigundee were camped. They had visited us in the morning
and done all in their power to induce me to camp and spend the
night with them on the lagoon; they accompanied us part of the
way, perhaps to make sure that I did not miss the road, but
finding I would not alter my course to please them they left us
with loud and violent signs of vexation and disappointment: We
camped for the night on an excellent flat, but without water.</p>
<p>On the 16th August. North-east-by-east for six miles over
undulating, stony plains, broken by isolated stony hills; the
prospect from the top of one of them was not encouraging to the
eastward, and as I could not distinctly trace the course of the
river I turned north-west to strike it again. The feed, though
dry, was good; we could find no water even in likely-looking
places. We this day came upon a few hundred acres of splendid
grass (dry) dotted with shade-giving black accasias and
intersected with water channels and holes; a more beautiful spot
for a paddock could not be found had there been any surface
Water, but there was none.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m., in twenty-one miles we struck the river on two
excellent large fresh waterholes; I was most thankful for this
good fortune, as the river where I had last left it had nothing
but dirty shallow salt water.</p>
<p>We followed the river on the 17th, and in six miles stopped to
get the latitude of a point which then appeared to be the
furthest northern part of the whole river. The latitude was
27&deg; 14' 46"; but it afterwards turned out not to be the most
northern point. In the afternoon We cut a good fresh water creek
running into the river from the south-east. Found a native camp;
none but ugly old women and children at home: An the blacks in
this part of the country appear to have learnt the words "Go on";
and whenever we met women or children, or a man by himself, we
were assailed with a volley of "go ons", accompanied by ludicrous
gesticulations. The latitude of our camp this night was 27&deg;
9' 11" by Altair.</p>
<p>On the 18th I again tried to make a cut, and started
north-north-east. The country was open, fairly
grassed&#8212;extensive, undulating, stony plains on our right,
and an apparent belt of gums on our left, marking, as I supposed,
the course of the river; but after a smart ride of about twenty
miles I lost sight of the signs of the river on my left, and
could see no appearance of it in my front; I was obliged,
therefore, to turn a second time to the north-west to recover the
lost river. What in the distance had appeared to be a belt of
trees, turned out to be only stunted gums scattered over a very
bad plain&#8212;soft, rotten, full of holes and cracks, showing
unmistakeable signs of being often inundated. The travelling was
very trying to the horses, but in about eight miles I reached
some low sandhills and got a latitude&#8212;26&deg; 54'. This was
my most northern point.</p>
<p>No sign of creek or river, such as I had been used to, being
visible, we turned south-south-west, and shortly came upon a
large mob of blacks. Fortunately, they had not expected us, and
were unarmed; but they were noisy, troublesome, and a little
disposed to make free with us and our property. They were most
importunate that we should go to their camp for water and rest.
For the first I consented to go; but finding they were located on
two little wells at which we could not water our horses, I turned
away and resumed our course, much to their displeasure. A
six-foot, powerful, but ill-looking savage, was the chief of this
tribe. He attached himself to me as we rode to his
camp&#8212;having perhaps the sense to see that I was the leader,
and, doubtless, not overlooking the fact that I was the only one
of the party apparently unarmed. He was a bold, swaggering
fellow, and kept his eyes open; but with all his cleverness I
doubt whether he knew why I rode with my right hand in my coat
pocket. Had he been aware that a cocked revolver was in my hand,
and within two feet of his head, and that upon the first act of
aggression either from man or woman of his tribe a pistol bullet
would have gone through his own skull, I think his bearing would
have been a little more subdued, and he might, perhaps, not have
kept quite so close to my horse. It was here the black corpse was
being prepared for supper.</p>
<p>We reached the river in the evening, a few miles above where
we had camped the night before&#8212;lat. 27&deg; 5', by Vega.
Our journey had been nigh forty miles, and I now found myself at
the apparent head of the river I had traced all the way up from
Lake Eyre.</p>
<p>The 19th was Sunday&#8212;a halt day&#8212;but, on
consideration, I was not satisfied with my position. I was
between two native camps, and the fact of my being there was
known to both. I never trust blacks further than I can help. They
were powerless against us unless I gave them a chance of
surprising us, which I should have done had I allowed their
combined forces (at least from fifty to sixty men) to catch us
quietly reposing, with our horses all loose and perhaps two or
three miles away. We could have driven back any number of them in
an open attack, but if caught napping we should have had the
worst of it; and if they got uninterrupted leisure for
twenty-four hours to work upon our horses, we should have been
utterly ruined. It was not my duty to court a collision in the
manner most favorable to myself, nor was I at all called upon to
give the blacks any advantage over me to my own injury, so I
moved on fifteen miles and saw no more of them.</p>
<p>I have elsewhere mentioned the reason why I went back down the
river at this time; it is, therefore, now only needful to refer
to O'Halloran Creek. We cut this creek unexpectedly on the 20th,
after riding about thirty miles&#8212;lat. 27&deg; 27' 32". It
took us three days' hard work to trace it into the Barcoo.
O'Halloran Creek is more deserving the name of a river than any I
have seen in the settled districts; it contains magnificent
sheets of good and very deep water. So far as it goes it is much
better than the Barcoo itself, and in some places reminded me
strongly of the Murray&#8212;particularly in the color of its
waters. It runs through a very fair country, and at times
inundates a considerable portion of it. I took everywhere on my
journey latitudes as opportunity offered; but I was pleased, on
taking a meridian altitude at the in O'Halloran Creek, to find my
latitude, 27&deg; 32', correspond so exactly with that of the
pool in Sturt's map.</p>
<p>The creeks or rivers in this country have some extraordinary
features. O'Halloran Creek, seen at one part, is a very fine
river for Australia; at another, it is a contemptible, boggy,
salt, but waterless ditch. The creek I have tamed after Captain
F. Cadell is a fine sheet of water in one part, no water at all
where it joins the Barcoo, and intensely salt where it runs round
towards O'Halloran Creek.</p>
<p>On the 24th August we again crossed the river, at the only
place where it was possible I might have made some mistake as to
its course. Travelling eastward for five miles, over easy
sandhills and good plains, well covered with saltbush and grass,
we cut a deep, timbered creek&#8212;the Darwent&#8212;coming down
from the S.E.</p>
<p>I at first thought this creek might be a portion of the river,
from the enormous body of water which it had brought down at no
very distant period. The flood-drift was lodged from twenty-five
to thirty feet above the level of the bed. We, therefore, traced
it up, and found several good and very picturesque waterholes;
but, after a ride of thirty-five miles, I was again
disappointed&#8212;it was only a creek, and drained a large
extent of open, stony land. I had now got too much to the south
(lat. 27&deg; 56' 47"); but I could not leave it without being
first satisfied that the river was not anywhere about. I,
therefore, next day, made a thirty-five mile sweep round the
country. Red; stony plains, a few small creeks, but no water: and
no sign of the river. We this day saw, for the first time, some
old cattle tracks going N.W., towards the river. Camped at a
beautiful waterhole on the Darwent. Lat. 27&deg; 46' 32" by Vega;
and 27&deg; 46' 12", by Altair.</p>
<p>On Monday, 27th August, we started due east, hoping eventually
to hit Cooper's Creek. Poor, stony country for eleven miles, then
flats with a little grass and saltbush. Six miles farther we cut
a large sandy creek, running N.E. Here we saw old cattle tracks.
Followed the creek three miles, to look for water in a promising
place; but found none. Turned again eastward. In five miles
sighted a very large freshwater lagoon, and saw the fresh tracks
of a cow and calf, wishing to push on as far as possible, and
hoping to find a little water, we completed thirty-two miles, and
camped without any. This night a little light rain fell for two
or three hours&#8212;the only rain we had during our whole
journey from Port Augusta, on the 18th June, to the Peake, in the
middle of September.</p>
<p>On the 28th we made twenty-five miles, on a general easterly
line, but found no water, though we got to a good-sized gum
creek. The creeks here have sandy beds, and will not hold
surface-water long.</p>
<p>On the 29th, still keeping easterly, we found several little
rainwaters on the stony plains. It was much the same as watering
a horse out of a soup-plate; but these drops&#8212;the fruits of
the rain on the 27th&#8212;alone enabled me to move further
eastward. We now got into a bad sandhill country. The further we
went the worse it became. The sandhills ran north and south; red,
and very heavy. The west slope was steep enough to try the horses
severely; but the eastern one was as nearly perpendicular as the
sand could keep itself. So long as I was travelling east I
ascended the lesser slope and descended the greater; but, seeing
no end of the sandhills in my front, no sign of water anywhere, I
had to consider how I should get my horses back to the only water
I knew of&#8212;more than fifty miles distant&#8212;when they had
to clamber up the very steep side of the sandhills. There was no
feed at all for them, so that at two p.m. I was reluctantly
compelled to turn back. My latitude this night was 27&deg; 42'
10", by Achernar; and this being the exact line which ought to
have taken me to Cooper's Creek, I was much disappointed at being
unable to proceed.</p>
<p>We went a little more to the southward in retracing our steps;
and, at eight miles, camped on a spot so beautiful that, had I
not seen it, I never could have believed in its existence. Our
eyes, used to the sterility of the sandhills, suddenly fell upon
a flat (about 150 acres) with verdure as brilliant as any
thickly-sown young wheat-field. The flat was surrounded by
gum-trees&#8212;most of them dead&#8212;and it was thickly
covered with native clover and wild rhubarb. There was no water;
but it was a pleasure to see the horses enjoying themselves after
a hard day's work, and after having been nearly forty-eight hours
without any feed worth picking up. We completed thirty miles this
day over very heavy country.</p>
<p>On the 30th we made twenty-five miles westing, and camped at a
muddy hole in a water-course leading into Lake Howitt.</p>
<p>August 31.&#8212;Examined Lake Howitt, as far as time
permitted. It cannot, I think, be less than thirty-five miles
round; it may be nearly as much again. There was plenty of water,
but it was exceedingly muddy; the bottom where I rode into it was
quite sound. The surface of the water was in many places black
with waterfowl, and on the margin of the lake we saw several
native companions&#8212;birds I have never before seen so far
north. We made thirty miles this day.</p>
<p>On the 1st September we made the river, and traced up all that
part of the Darwent which I had not before seen, and camped on a
waterhole in lat. 27&deg; 39' 30". From here we made the best of
our way back to Pelican Plain, cutting off all angles, and we
reached our old waterhole on the morning of the 7th
September.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of that clay we discovered a very fine
feeding country, with abundance of water from late rains&#8212;a
lagoon lately filled, the water not having quite settled, and a
very fine creek, which I have named the Jarvis. To show how
difficult it is to calculate upon what one may meet with whilst
travelling in Australia, I would say that the waterhole we had
just left was lower than it had been in July, when we were first
upon it, yet a few miles north-west of it were abundant signs of
late heavy rain; the rain had been quite close up to it, but had
not run into it.</p>
<p>On the 8th we ran up the Jarvis, which forks&#8212;a short
branch running up to drain the sandhill and lagoon country,
having its rise in a semi-lagoon waterhole, lat. 27&deg; 46', and
a long one running more to the north-west, draining an extensive
tract of rough, stony, low ranges. It is a very fine and
well-timbered creek, inundates a large extent of level country,
and finally falls into the Barcoo. We completed forty miles this
day, and camped on the upper part of the Macumbah Creek.</p>
<p>Monday, September 10.&#8212;Twenty-one miles west-south-west
to a fine waterhole, on which sheep had been put during the
drought previous to January, 1866. Magnetic bearing, Mount
Margaret, S. 21&deg; W.; lat. 27&deg; 59' 35" by Vega, and
28&deg; 0' 12" by Altair.</p>
<p>September 11&#8212;Thirty-three miles into the Peake, passing
a very fine waterhole, and an old sheepyard. There had been rain
lately. Feed and water abundant; but as we got to within fifteen
miles of the Peake all signs of rain disappeared. Hungry and
empty handed, we reached the Peake. Our sugar had been finished
some days before, and of flour we had not an ounce. To Mr. Levi
and Mr. Jarvis, his overseer, we are all greatly indebted for
food, assistance, and much kindness.</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty of naming some of the best creeks
after my friends&#8212;P. Ferguson, J. Darwent, Stephen Jarvis,
and F. Cadell, Esquires. I have also used the name of A. W.
Howitt, Esq., the Victorian explorer, who did such good service
in the neighborhood of Cooper's Creek.</p>
<p>"The Peake" is the furthest outstation in the North; its
latitude is 28&deg; 6' 26". Resting our horses, revictualling,
and repairing damages detained us here till the 24th September,
when we went fifteen miles north-north-west to "Archiebuckna".
This is the finest waterhole I have seen in the Colony. Lat.
27&deg; 56' by E. Pegasi.</p>
<p>25th. West by north, about eleven miles, to Kadnowie Spring;
thence four miles north-north-west to Survey Camp Spring. The
country is generally good; but as 6,000 sheep had not long ago
been running over it, and no rain had fallen since January, the
feed was rather scanty. Lat. 27&deg; 51'.</p>
<p>26th. North-west by west, twenty miles, to a waterhole on the
Neales, over open, lightly-stoned country, and crossing several
small confluents to the Neales. Want of rain has kept down the
feed.</p>
<p>27th. Nearly on the same course, twenty-seven miles, cutting
off an angle of the Neales. No water, nor any appearance of rain
having fallen for a long time. The day's ride was rough, and the
horses show fatigue; they have neither food nor water.</p>
<p>28th. Twenty miles up the Neales, searching carefully for
water. No hope of finding any&#8212;the country is dried up; the
bits of grass, three years old, parched and black. I halted my
party, it being evident our horses would not hold out much longer
over such a country. Taking one man with me, I rode to a small
hill, about five miles distant, to see whether there was any hope
of improvement. Could see nothing offering as fair a prospect of
water as what we had passed over without finding any.</p>
<p>I believe this country has been called by one explorer "a good
country". I can only say that if it ever was so, it has greatly
changed. With a heavy fall of rain the bed of the Neales might
afford water and feed for some months; but the country on both
sides of this part of it is, in my opinion, bad, and never could
have anything useful upon it, except for a very short time
immediately after rain.</p>
<p>I turned back, and we made the best of our way down the
Neales, to the first water we could find. Nineteen hours' riding,
out of twenty-four hours, brought us to a waterhole; and it was
well for us our horses knew they were heading for water, and not
from it, or they would not have travelled half the distance.</p>
<p>I hung about the Neales from the 29th September to the 5th
October, hoping for rain, of which there appeared a reasonable
prospect, but none fell&#8212;it all passed off in wind and dust;
and I returned with my party to the Peake, on the 6th October,
perfectly satisfied that it was not then possible for me to
proceed to the westward.</p>
<p>The Adelaide season has been a good one, and persons residing
here may scarcely believe that, leaving on the 11th June, and
returning on the 1st November, I have had only two paltry
showers&#8212;one in the bush and one at the Peake&#8212;during
my absence; yet such is the case.</p>
<p>There are some peculiarities about the late rains in the Far
North which I must endeavor to explain. There have only been two
falls&#8212;the first in April, 1865, the second in January,
1866.</p>
<p>In April, 1865, though no rain fell at the stations, the lower
part of the Neales was flooded. The rain came from the east or
north-east, but did not pass westward of the 136th meridian, nor
reach on that meridian so far south as latitude 28&deg;. The
flooded ground brought forth splendid herbs, geraniums, &amp;c.,
but no grass.</p>
<p>In January, 1866, an entraordinarily heavy rain fell very
generally over the settled parts of the Far North, and did an
enormous amount of damage. This rain brought up grass, not herbs.
Now, the effects of this tremendous flood are quite visible, even
at present; and the good, holding waterholes have yet plenty of
that water in them. I have seen abundant signs of this flood as
far as 140&deg; east long.; but directly we get westward of the
136th meridian, east long., all appearance of moderate rains,
much less of heavy flood, is lost. Indeed, the fact that the
Frome, eastward of Lake Torrens, was flooded to five miles wide,
whilst the large and good holes on the Elizabeth, westward of the
same lake, are quite dry, proves that the rain did not, between
the parallels 30&deg; and 32&deg; south, extend so far west as
long. 137&deg; 30'.</p>
<p>I went up the western side of Lake Eyre, and can answer for
its dryness; I have credible information that there has been no
rain, that is, none leaving surface-waters to travel on, at a
distance of fifty to seventy miles due west of Mounts Hamilton
and Margaret; whilst, by personal examination, I know there has
been none to the north-west of Mount Margaret.</p>
<p>The waterhole in the Neales, fifteen miles north of the Peake,
is good; the next one immediately to the westward, is not, after
the January flood, in such a good state as it was shortly after
the rain of the previous April; the two or three holes; which now
have water higher up the Neales, speak unmistakeably to the fact
that they were very slightly, if at all, affected by the January
flood. Had it been otherwise, they would like Archiebuckna have
had plenty of water, for a great number of cattle have been
watering at the latter hole, none at the former ones. Going fifty
miles further to the west, though there are good holes in the
creek, there is not a sign of moisture in them; they cannot have
held water for some years. Had the rain of April, 1865, or that
of January, 1866, reached this part of the country it could not
be in its present state. Twenty miles eastward of the Peake the
country had been visited with good rain in September, but none
had fallen any further west. I observe also by the newspapers
that an exploring party from Western Australia, trying to push to
their eastward (that is our westward), were obliged to turn back
from the total absence of water. All these things put together
satisfy me that, up to the present time, the drought under which
so many settlers have been so long suffering in the occupied
parts of the Province, has not ceased westward of the 136th
meridian, and northward of the 30th parallel of south
latitude.</p>
<p>Having now closed the last report I shall have the honor of
submitting to you upon the subject of exploration, I would beg
permission to offer a few words of personal explanation.</p>
<p>I have been publicly blamed, both by the press and in "another
place", for going out on these exploring expeditions, as if I had
abandoned my proper duties and thrust myself into others for
which I was not qualified, and with which I had no business. I
should wish in this, my final report, to place the matter in its
true light. I have never volunteered nor solicited the
appointment of leader of an exploring party. I was on each
occasion selected by the Government I served, and I have been
taught that it is not creditable to a military man to decline a
service which Government nominated him to perform. I have gone
out as a duty, and I have done that duty to the best of my
ability; my expeditions have not been costly, and they are the
only ones (those of Mr. Perry, of the Survey Department perhaps
excepted) which have led to the leasing of new country.</p>
<p>I have borne hunger, thirst, fatigue, exposure, and at times
much mental anxiety; I have been loudly censured, and have lost
&pound;450. I can, therefore, safely say that it is not a source
of personal regret to me that I now put my name for the last time
to a South Australian exploring report.</p>
