<h4>JOURNAL OF THE ELDER EXPLORING EXPEDITION, 1891.</h4>
<p align="right"><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Adelaide, October
4th, 1892.</p>
<p>Sir&#8212;I have the honor to forward herewith a copy of my
journal as kept during the progress of the Elder Scientific
Exploring Expedition of 1891-2; also a copy of Mr. Wells'
journal, kept during my absence from the party. Enclosed is the
final report, written in accordance with the instructions.</p>
<p>Mr. Streich's journal having been in my possession, I was
enabled to place his geological descriptions on the map. Not
having seen the journals or reports of Messrs. Leech, Elliot, and
Helms, I cannot in any way refer to them. I regret that Mr. Leech
should have seen fit not to hand in the pencil sketches made by
him.</p>
<p align="right">I have, &amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Australia, Adelaide.<br>

<br>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>FINAL
REPORT.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Warrina I found that Mr. Leech, the second
officer, had the evening before when wrestling sprained his
knee.</p>
<p>The medical officer next morning reported that if a bed could
be arranged on a camel during the march and perfect rest allowed
Mr. Leech while in camp, for about three weeks, there would be no
risk in taking him on, and that he did not consider the injury
serious enough to necessitate Mr. Leech being left behind.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made for Mr. Leech's comfort on the march
and in camp, and five weeks later he was able to dispense with
the crutches.</p>
<p>The death of poor Bowden, at Cootanoorinna, a week after the
expedition left Warrina, was an unfortunate loss to the
expedition, as he was a man of long experience in the bush and
with camels, and might have given valuable help in the
troublesome times which followed.</p>
<p>We left Warrina on the 2nd May, 1891, were detained seven days
in the vicinity of Cootanoorinna by rains, a week at Arcoellinna
Well through the stupidity of the Afghans in losing seven
camels.</p>
<p>We followed Chamber's pad and road to a few miles north-west
of Chamber's Bluff, when we left it and travelled straight for
the Everard Ranges, distant about thirty-six miles, which were
reached on the 2nd of June.</p>
<p>Mount Illbillie, the highest point in the Everard Ranges, is a
trigonometrical station, and the point decided upon as the
starting point, from where, according to the printed
instructions, we were to proceed "thence on a <i>westerly</i>
course into the section of unexplored country marked (A) on the
plan." Formation, granite with diorite dykes. The country was in
good condition owing to recent rains. Water in nearly every
gully.</p>
<p>From Illbillie we proceeded westerly, examining and fixing the
position of all hills, and marked the southerly limit of the
hills. Flying parties were detached at various points, as shown
on the map, until we reached the province boundary, where we
expected to find a range of mountains thirty miles long. At the
position assigned to this range&#8212;the Blyth Range&#8212;only
a group of detached hills was found, with a few rockholes in
granite outcrops four miles to south and south-west.</p>
<p>Having left the country which had been visited by rains and
entered a region so dry as to lead us to the conclusion that no
rain had fallen for two or three years, we went on to the range
of which Skirmish Hill forms the south-western end in the hopes
of finding water, but again met with disappointment, for the
country Was still drier; even the spinifex, or, more properly
speaking, the porcupine, was dead and the mulga nearly so. Mr.
Wells here rejoined us, and reported that the country to the
south was all sandhills and sandstone ridges, with small
quantities of water in rockholes. We now considered our best
course was to go to Fort Mueller and Bailee Spring, form a
dep&#244;t, according to our printed instructions, from which to
detach parties northerly into block B to search for Gibson, and
southerly into block A, exploring and searching for water. Fort
Mueller being absolutely dry, I went west and found at Forrest's
rockhole, and at some holes unseen by the previous explorers, a
fair supply of water, while the sandhills were covered with the
green waterbush <i>(Pollechia Zeylanica)</i>. After watering the
camels at a rockhole found near Borrow's Hill we moved on and
formed a dep&#244;t, sending the spare camels some fifteen miles
back to depasture on the waterbush.</p>
<p>From the dep&#244;t; (camp 33) Mr. Wells went south-west; Mr.
Leech north-west into block B to look for traces of
Gibson&#8212;owing to the lapse of years it was not surprising
that the search proved fruitless; I and Mr. Streich rode around
and through the Barrow Ranges, only finding one small rockhole.
Then Dr. Elliot and I went west, visiting Barlee Spring, which
was practically dry, and all the watering places discovered by
Giles and Forrest to the west side of the Warburton Ranges; when,
finding all the waters dried up and all the. rockholes empty and
evidences of the thought having been long continued, I concluded
that no water would be found at the Sutherland Ranges. 100 miles
further on, and that Alexander Spring would certainly be dry
also, I decided to return to the dep&#244;t. I have since learnt
from Mr. W. W. Mills that in 1883 he found Alexander Spring
dry.</p>
<p>Mr. Wells returned, reporting miserable country with only very
few small rockholes. At one place, 130 miles south-west, he left
300 gallons of water in a hole. Our position was somewhat
perplexing, as we had not enough water to give the camels a drink
and to fill up our casks; there was none for a reasonable
distance behind us. The few natives we saw were living on the
rockholes, and those, with whom we got speech said no water to
the south and south-west. But as a good number of natives had
made towards Mount Squires from all directions, and as there were
evidences of rain having fallen on that mountain during the last
three months, we considered it likely that a closer search in the
gullies and gorges would result in the discovery of some waters.
After full consideration we decided that if we could get enough
water in the neighborhood by emptying all the rockholes, to go
across to Queen Victoria's Spring by way of the rockhole found by
Mr. Wells.</p>
<p>We proceeded south to Mount Squires, having brought in the
camels, which had been now three weeks without water, and after
searching found abundance of water. Gave the camels a drink, sent
water twenty-five miles on the intended course, gave the camels
another drink, filled all our water vessels and headed for Queen
Victoria's Spring on the other side of the Great Victoria desert
and distant about 400 miles. My journal and map give full details
of the country. No sign of minerals so far.</p>
<p>When we reached the rockholes found by Mr. Wells we found a
mob of natives camped there and the quantity reduced to 90 galls.
of very dirty water. Gave it to the camels and proceeded over a
useless country of sandhills and sandstone ridges all through to
Queen Victoria's Spring. The fine growth of <i>Eucalyptus
endesmioides</i> (desert gum) extending for over 100 miles gave
the country a very pleasing aspect, but there were very few stock
bushes and no grass. In latitude 29&#176; 20', 270 miles from
Mount Squires, the eastern edge of good pastoral country was
touched. The geologist expressed his opinion that water would be
found by sinking, and he also reported "an extinct mound spring",
the position of which I have shown on the map. The average height
of the plains is about 1,600ft. or 1,700ft., while the mountain
tops reach to a height of 2,500ft. above sea level; the lowest
noted flat was 750ft. above sea level and Queen Victoria's Spring
is 836ft., showing a very considerable fall.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria's Spring was reached on the twenty-fifth day at
a distance of 393 miles from Mount Squires, and found to be dry.
Our position now was somewhat critical, for the camels had been
twenty-five days without water and were not only thirsty, but
leg-weary. To go north back into the desert was not possible, and
the only safe course to take was to make for the nearest certain
water, which, after consulting the map, was found to be at Fraser
Range, 125 miles distant. It was questionable whether the camels
would travel another week without water. A well was sunk 15ft.
deep and 60 gallons of water obtained, to which we added 40
gallons out of the casks, enabling the camels to have 2&#189;
galls. each. When about half way to the range we passed out of
spinifex and entered a good country of rich red soil, producing
many good stock bushes, including saltbush and bluebush, but all
extremely dry. Fine forests of high mallee and eucalypti were
passed through. At twenty-nine miles we crossed a belt of country
worthy the attention of prospectors.</p>
<p>On the thirty-fourth day we reached Fraser Range, having
travelled 537 miles from Mount Squires without loss of camels or
equipment. One camel died the day we reached Queen Victoria's
Spring from urinic poisoning. Up to this point we had travelled
2,710 miles, of which 1,813 miles were through unexplored
country.</p>
<p>From October 4th to the 2nd November the party was encamped at
Fraser Range, during which time I went on horseback to Esperance
Bay, 160 miles distant, to report progress by telegraph to the
council of the Royal Geographical Society. I obtained the consent
of the council to go <i>vi&#226;</i> Hampton Plains, when, if no
water was found there, to go west until water was found.</p>
<p>On the 2nd November we started again, and travelled
ninety-eight miles through new country to Mount Monger, and then
twenty miles to Hunt's slate well. All the country very well
adapted for stock, but no surface waters, and now suffering from
a long drought. The inability of our native guides to show us any
water, and the camels having been seven days without water, and
eating saltbush every clay, it was absolutely necessary to go
west along Hunt's route to find water. When Hunt was exploring
here in 1864 he sank wells, constructed dams and tanks at which
to form dep&#244;ts, and it was at some of those wells that I
hoped to find water. All the officers saw the gravity of our
position, for our camels were really looking worse than when we
reached Fraser Range, and the weather was very hot. All agreed as
to the necessity of again making for known water. I did not
consult them on the matter, as there were only two courses to
pursue&#8212;one leading on to certain destruction and loss of
the whole party, and the other the course we followed, which took
us to within thirty miles of Southern Cross township before
sufficient water was obtained, viz., at Karoling. Unfortunately
there was only a limited amount of camel food and an abundance of
<i>Gastrolobium</i>&#8212;a dreaded poison bush, which prevented
us remaining more than one day.</p>
<p>Karoling is about 250 miles from the edge of the unexplored
country, and it was quite impossible for us to attempt to go
there. The country was suffering from drought, and all our camels
were in a very low and weak condition, as was clearly shown when
a week later, at a suitable spot, I had to order a fortnight's
rest for them.</p>
<p>Our only course now was to make our way as direct as possible
to the Murchison through the outer edge of the settled country,
where we could get water at moderate stages from the settlers'
wells, doing away with the necessity of carrying large quantities
of water. We had a stage of ninety miles without water, from
Elichapatten to Pindeburra Well, which occupied us, owing to the
dense thickets and the weak state of the camels, seven days. We
then followed a dray track to Broad's Station, fifty-three miles.
Then across country a day's stage to the Nalbaralla, Well, when a
dray track served us for half a day, when we again made across
Country to Watson's Station, from where a new track was followed
to Coodardy Station on the Murchison-Geraldton road.</p>
<p>As soon as I established a dep&#244;t at Annean Station and
made necessary arrangements for supplies, &amp;c., I started for
Geraldton to place myself in direct telegraphic communication
with the council. The journey of 330 miles was accomplished in
ten clays, and after a few telegrams had passed between the
council and me I was much distressed at receiving imperative
instructions to return to Adelaide to consult with the council. I
felt that a loss of time and much needless expense would
accrue.</p>
<p>Before leaving Geraldton I wrote full instructions to Mr.
Wells what to do during my absence. Fortunately for him, the
night after he left with a light party to examine the unexplored
country lying to the east of our dep&#244;t, in accordance with
my instructions, the three years' drought broke up and splendid
rains fell all over the country, so that he was enabled to send
the water team back to the dep&#244;t and travel fast and far,
accomplishing in the six weeks he was away a very important work;
he travelled 834 miles, discovered some fine ranges and bids, a
large extent of pastoral country and some auriferous country, but
no permanent surface waters.</p>
<p>Briefly, the country traversed is from Welbundinum Well (the
dep&#244;t camp), which is about forty miles east of Annean
station, for fifty miles, good pastoral country, crossing the
Montagu Range, 2,260ft. above sea level. Then a narrow belt of
sand ridges with spinifex was crossed (fourteen miles in width),
when good pastoral country was again entered, extending for 170
miles to the eastward; at fifty miles (in the good pastoral
country) auriferous country was met with, extending for 100 miles
easterly, the lay of the country being northwest and south-east,
with fine hills and ranges and two large gum creeks, in one of
which, the Erlistoun, Mr. Wells considered a permanent soakage
exists. There can, I think, be very little doubt that water is to
be obtained at reasonable depths, making this country worthy the
attention of the pastoralist. Then sixty miles of sand ridges
were traversed, when auriferous country was again met with. Then
for forty miles the hills and ridges and good pastoral country
broken by belts of sandy spinifex country continued, when the
edge of the Great Victoria Desert was entered upon, and nothing
could be seen to the east but sand ridges whose spinifex-covered
surface was relieved by the bright green foliage of the desert
gums and by black patches of mulga. Mr. Wells then travelled
north-east over sand ridges for sixty-two miles, when he turned
west for twenty-four miles to a long range (the Ernest Giles)
having a north and south trend and an elevation of 2,170ft. above
sea level, surrounded by good stock country. Descending the
western slopes a belt of sand ridges, broken by mulga-covered
hills, continued for twenty-eight miles to a long narrow salt
lake (Lake Wells), which is surrounded by high hills and splendid
pastoral country, extending for 120 miles westerly, and as far
north as could be seen; small patches of sandy country to be seen
to the southward. Then twenty-two miles of sandy country was
crossed and good pastoral country was entered upon, extending for
160 miles to the dep&#244;t at "Welbundinum Well", passing at
thirty-six miles a spot where permanent water is considered to
exist.</p>
<p>The pastoral country discovered is equal to that now occupied
by settlers on the Murchison, and no doubt will ere long be taken
up and stocked with cattle. The auriferous country will probably
be found capable of supporting a fairly large population, which
will hasten on and render profitable the stocking of those
extensive valleys which, according to the description given,
consist of "rich chocolate loam covered good stock mulga,
acacias, saltbush, and grass."</p>
<p>Immediately on Mr. Wells' return to the Murchison he
proceeded, in accordance with the instructions awaiting him, to
disband the expedition, which was most unfortunate, as the
drought having now broken up all over Western Australia, the
remainder of the unexplored regions in Australia could have been
quickly and easily examined.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>NATIVES.</p>
<p>Of the natives little need be said, as no doubt the medical
officer will hand in his full report. During the whole expedition
very few were met with. Four men in the vicinity of the Everard
Ranges were the first seen; they were friendly, and travelled
with us for some weeks. Then one old man was seen, and then about
110 miles from the Everard six men visited us speaking the same
language and practising the same rites of circumcision and
incision. These left us quickly, and a week later we had thirteen
natives in the camp, friendly and with the same habits and
customs, medium stature, but strong and healthy and in good
condition. No women or children were seen. For the next sixty
miles we had with us numbers varying from three to thirteen. Many
footprints of women and children were seen. At Pernamo Hill they
refused to go any farther, saying there was no more water. The
next natives seen were an old man and old woman near Skirmish
Hill; the next at camp 33, in the neighborhood of which between
fifty and 100 or more were living at the different rockholes.
Women and children were seen, but all were so frightened that no
Communication could be held with them. The men, fine fellows some
of them, were very afraid and excited and wanted us to leave
their district, but they showed no hostility to us. Mr. Wells saw
a few on the sandhills. Mr. Leech surprised some in block B, and
I saw some to the westward. At Mount Squires we were visited by
twelve men, most of them of fine physique, who were very
frightened. I gave them some presents, and they left. Next seen
were in the sandhills at a rockhole, where they attacked Mr.
Wells and myself, but we were able to overcome their hostile
intentions and hold friendly intercourse with them. At the
rockholes 120 miles south-west of Mount Squires we surprised a
mob, who were inclined to attack us, but were overawed by our
numbers and the camels. After a little trouble we talked with the
men and gave them some red handkerchief's. So far as we could
ascertain in the few minutes we had with them their language and
customs were still the same as those seen farther back. No more
natives were seen until we reached Fraser Range Station, where
many were employed by a dam sinker. The dialect spoken was quite
different, and they were an inferior type, being smaller and not
so well formed. A woman and a man&#8212;brother and
sister&#8212;were seen, both having six toes on each foot and six
fingers on each hand. From Fraser Range on to the Murchison
natives were only seen at the stations. As many words as possible
were obtained from them on every opportunity, and I beg to attach
a list of words as obtained by Mr. Wells and myself. Mr. Wells
saw one woman east of the Murchison, but she was too afraid to
give any information.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>SUMMARY OF WORK
DONE.</p>
<p>From May 2nd to June 2nd, 1891. we travelled to reach starting
point, 255 miles. From June 6th to October 3rd, 1891, we
travelled through unexplored country, 1,813 miles; through
explored country searching for water, &amp;c., 306 miles; flying
trips same routes afterwards travelled by caravan, 336 miles.
From October 4th to November 2nd, 1891, in dep&#244;t at Fraser
Range. From November 2nd to November 26th, 1891, through new
country, ninety-eight miles; looking for water in explored
country, 225 miles. From November 27th to December 7th, 1891,

nearly fifteen miles per day. Area explored and mapped, over
80,000 square miles. Total mileage through unexplored country,
2,745 miles.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I unhesitatingly affirm, without fear of
contradiction, that the course pursued under the circumstances of
prolonged drought was on each occasion right and proper. When at
Mount Squires had we spent any more time in searching for water
the camels would have been unfit for the long journey to Queen
Victoria's Springs, and the weather would have been so hot that
the camels would have been unable to do such a long distance
without water. Had we returned from Mount Squires and gone
northwards we should still have had the drought to contend with,
much time would have been wasted, and all the arrangements
upset.</p>
<p>With the training our camels had undergone, I considered the
risk of going the 400 miles to Queen Victoria's Spring was a fair
one to take&#8212;every member of the party was with me in that
decision; and the fact that I was able to lead the whole caravan
150 miles further without any loss of camels and equipment was a
sufficient proof that my judgment was sound, and that had Queen
Victoria's Spring not failed us we should have easily, from there
as a dep&#244;t, completed the examination of block A, and been
only two or three weeks' behind time at the Murchison
dep&#244;t. When on the western side of the desert we found that
the drought had been on for three years, and the natives living
on water obtained out of roots; it would have been madness to
have attempted to take the caravan across direct to the
Murchison. And the camels were quite unfit to be sent out
searching for water.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Fraser Range was not a suitable place for a
lengthened stay, as the bushes were very dry and provisions for
the party could not easily be obtained. That, when Hampton Plains
failed us, the course followed of going to the Murchison, where
was plenty of feed and water for the camels and provisions for
the party, and from where the remaining portion of block A could
be easily attacked and examined by lightly-equipped parties, was
the proper one, was proved by after events. Even if the drought
had not broken up I could, as I advised the council from
Geraldton, have gone on with the work and completed the
exploration of Australia. But when the drought broke up we were
in a splendid position, and all our camels were fat and fit to go
on, and if I had been allowed to fill the vacancies in the party
and continue the work I have no hesitation in saying that not
only would block A have been examined and probably new goldfields
opened up for Western Australia, but blocks B, C, and D would
have been explored by this date.</p>
<p>The abandonment of the expedition was a terrible
disappointment to me. That men who had so little sense of their
duty to their leader and to their generous employer should have
been the primary cause of the break up of such a
splendidly-equipped expedition, causing the opportunity of
completing in such a thorough manner the exploration of those
extensive unknown regions in Australia to be lost, is a matter
that not only those intimately associated with the expedition,
but geographers throughout the world, must ever regret.</p>
<p>I desire again to place on record my full appreciation of the
splendid loyalty and assistance of Mr. L. A. Wells, the surveyor,
and afterwards second officer, and also of the loyalty, good
behaviour, and willing attention to his duties shown by Alfred
Warren.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

<p><b><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>April, 1891]</b></p>
<p><i>April 22nd.</i>&#8212;F. W. Leech, L. A. Wells, V. Streich,
R. Helms, A. Warren, R. Ramsay, and A. P. Gwynne left Adelaide by
the early train for Warrina, stopping at Farina to take on the
camels by special train. There being only twenty-two camels fit
to take, Mr. Phillipson telegraphed to Taighe Mahomet, at Hergott
Springs, to have additional camels awaiting the train. Mahomet
had only twenty-five out of which to pick twenty-two. It can be
seen that the whole forty-four were not specially selected.</p>
<p><i>April 27th.</i>&#8212;Dr. Elliot and I left Adelaide on
Monday, April 27th, 1891. We reached Warrina on the 29th, in the
evening, and found very little done towards getting away. Mr.
Leech had the evening before sprained his knee when wrestling.
Dr. Dickenson, of Warrina, considered it serious, but Dr. Elliot
said that if I could do without Mr. Leech's services for a few
weeks he would soon be well, and it was perfectly safe to take
him on.</p>
<p><i>April 30th.</i>&#8212;Examined the camels and although
there were a few I would rather not have had, on the whole the
team was a good one. Those purchased at Hergott were rather poor,
but one advantage was that there were a goodly number of suitable
riding camels.<br></p>
<p><b><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>May, 1891]</b></p>
<p><i>May 1st.</i>&#8212;Engaged with the loading at Warrina.
Bowden unwell, having a very bad cold. 9 a.m., bar. 30.010, ther.
75&#176;.</p>
<p><i>May 2nd.</i>&#8212;Left Warrina at 1.45 p.m., after being
photographed by Mrs. Dickenson. Made a bed on one of the camels
for Mr. Leech; the doctor had obtained a pair of crutches for
him. Camped at a spring two miles east from Nilpena H.S. At 9
a.m., bar. 30.100, ther. 61&#176;.</p>
<p><i>May 3rd.</i>&#8212;Travelled over level good country to a
spring two miles east from Cootanoorinna, H.S. Distance travelled
ten miles. Killed a bullock for the Afghans; cut it up and salted
it. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.990, ther. 69&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May 4th.</i>&#8212;Preparing meat and hide pack
bags. Bowden worse. Dr. Elliot advised his being sent up to the
station, which was accordingly clone, Ramsay and Gwynne acting as
nurses night and day. Leech also was at the station, Mr.
MacDonald being most kind, making us welcome and doing all he
could to assist us. The doctor stayed at the station to look
after Leech and Bowden. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.950, ther.
66&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday. May 5th.</i>&#8212;Camped near Cootanoorinna. Mr.
Streich asked me to lend him a camel to go and look at some hills
three or four miles away. I told him that Mr. H. Y. L. Brown, the
Government Geologist, had already reported on this country, and I
wanted the riding camels to have as much rest as possible in the
early part of the journey; besides Mr. Streich could not manage a
camel, and we were all too busy to spare a man to accompany him.
Mr. Helms busy collecting. At. 9 a.m., bar. 29.945, ther.
66&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May 6th.</i>&#8212;Still busy with the loading
and boxes, getting everything in proper order. I miss the
assistance of Mr. Leech and Bowden very much, as only Mr. Wells
understands what is needed. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.945, ther.
67&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Thursday. May 7th.</i>&#8212;Left camp at spring, two miles
east of Cootanoorinna Station, at 11.20 a.m. Prevented leaving
earlier owing to the late arrival of the camels. At the station
Dr. Elliot photographed the caravan, and Mr. Helms left a packet
of botanical specimens to be forwarded to Adelaide. Took
1,000lbs. weight of dry salt beef and 38lbs. fresh. Poor Bowden
is almost unconscious, and the doctor says a few hours will
decide his fate. If he recovers we will not be able to take him
on with us. This is sad. news, and makes our start anything but
cheerful. Resumed our journey at 2.20, leaving Dr. Elliot, Mr.
Leech, Gwynne, and Bowden at the station. Camped on the creek
about ten miles distant at 4.30, the caravan arriving at 5 p.m.
Clear hot day, with some heavy clouds low clown on the horizon.
At 9 a.m., bar. 29.940, ther. 65&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May 8th.</i>&#8212;At camp. Ther. 61&#176;, bar.
29.975. During the night, at 2 and 4 o'clock, thunderstorms, with
about &#188;in. of rain and a southerly wind. Being quite
unexpected, we were unprepared, and all sleeping out, so that the
members of the company had an unpleasant experience putting up
tents and covering up the loading in the rain. A big fire and
billy of hot coffee warmed us, and we made light of the
discomfort. Morning broke dull and threatening, but no rain fell
until midday. The whole party were inexpressibly shocked when a
messenger came with the melancholy intelligence that Bowden had
died at 6 p.m. last evening. Sent an Afghan in with camels for
the gentlemen at the station, also instructions <i>re</i>
disposal of Bowden's effects, &amp;c., and wrote to the hon.
secretary Royal Geographical Society, Adelaide. As the doctor
informed me previously that Bowden would be unable to go on with
us I had sent Hadji in to engage another Afghan, as I knew of no
white man available to take the vacant place. A very good man,
Abdul, arrived. Raining in afternoon.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May 9th.</i>&#8212;Rained all night and all day,
up to 4 p.m. Bar. 30.200, ther. 53&#176; at 9 a.m. Had we not left
the spring we would have been stuck up for a week in a most
miserable camp; no firewood, no shelter, no feed, and very boggy
all around, whereas we have all those desiderata here.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May 10th.</i>&#8212;Camp ten miles W.N.W. of
Cootanoorinna. Ther. 56&#176;, bar. 30.600. Held service, and then
Messrs. Wells, Streich, and I walked up the creek to see how the
flood waters were. Took off our boots and crossed a dozen water
channels. A tremendous lot of water coming down the creek, but
our camp is safe, as the biggest body of water passes down on one
side, and we could get our goods out on the other to the
tableland if necessary. Messrs. Leech, Elliot, and Gwynne came
out from the station, bringing a mail, the last we shall get
until we reach the settled districts in Western Australia.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May 11th.</i>&#8212;Same camp. Ther. 50&#176;, bar.
30.110. Mr. Wells and I went, away to see if the ground was hard
enough for the camels, and to find, if possible, a crossing to
the other bank. We returned at sundown successful, but had a very
wet and boggy ride. Paddy Fitzpatrick, a Central Australian with
his blackboy came out to see if he could get on in place of
Bowden. I was indeed sorry that I had engaged the other Afghan,
as Fitzpatrick would have been a splendid addition to the party,
Sent a mail back with him.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May 12th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy, threatening for rain;
ther. 55&#176;. bar. 30.200. We are very anxious to get out of
this flooded valley, as in the event of another inch of rain
falling, we would be unpleasantly situated; not that we would
lose our goods, for the flood waters move so slowly that we would
be able to remove everything in time. Started at 10.20; got
safely on to the tableland on the south side of Cootanoorinna
Creek at 11.45. I then rode on ahead to find, if possible, a
better crossing to the creek. At 1.35 had all the camels safely
across on to the north side of the creek, just east of the trig.
We had some difficulty, as some of the camels fell down in the
boggy ground. We proceeded up the S.W. back of the Arkaringa
Creek for nine miles, a very great deal of water laying about and
the country very soft. We had a few drops of rain. The wind was
very cold, veering round from east to north. Camped at 4.30 on
good. feed. Saw one emu who successfully escaped from about
eleven shots fired at him. Turkey were numerous, but very
wild.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May 13th.</i>&#8212;The morning broke clear and
fine; ther. 53&#176;, bar. 29.980.&#8212;Wind, slight from south.
Started at 9.35, and travelled steadily up the Arkaringa Creek.
Lots of water laying about&#8212;very heavy travelling. Camped
about one mile from No. 1 Well, making a stage of about eighteen
miles at 4 p.m. Some of the Cootanoorinna cattle about. An
undulating stony country, with very good feed, salt cotton, and
other bushes. Mulga and gidyea and box trees on the watercourses,
and the two-mile wide valley of the Arkaringa. Few wood
ducks.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May 14th.</i>&#8212;Cold and clear, wind N.W. to
south; ther. 55&#176;, bar. 29.960. Started at 9.25, passing No. 1
Well in one and a half miles; still following up the valley of
the Arkaringa. As the waterholes were becoming less frequent, we
filled up two casks. At midday we crossed to N.E. side of the
creek, and found a country most beautiful to the eye of the
pastoralist&#8212;good rains having fallen some two months
ago&#8212;salt, cotton, and other bushes, with Mitchell grass,
gidyea and box trees; a loose loamy soil. On the right a high
tableland with bluff escarpment and very peculiar shapes. Slopes
from the hills, beautifully clothed with vegetation. Valley of
the creek two miles wide. Fresh horse and cattle tracks. Camped
at 4.25. very lovely sunset.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May 15th.</i>&#8212;During the night the sky became
partially overcast with clouds. Very heavy dew.. Started at 9.20
along moist flat. Crossed to south side of Arkaringa Creek.
Passed numerous clay water-holes. Followed a dray track; at 11.30
came to a well with the timbering nearly all destroyed by white
ants. An open flat with good vegetation extending to the
northwards. Open stony downs, very well grassed and clothed with
cotton and saltbush, mulga, gidyea, box, and willows. The whole
country looking extremely well. Camped at 4.20. Very cloudy, and
looking like rain. As the sun set the clouds lifted, and the sky
cleared very much. Hadji was breaking in one of the young
bullocks, which he says will make a very good riding camel. I do
not approve of his method of breaking; he knocks and rushes the
poor beast about too much. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.835, ther.
55&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May 16th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy, very threatening for
rain; wind. Started at 9.17, having put all the loading on in
half an hour. Passed over very good country indeed&#8212;a
tableland and peaked hills of "horizontal beds of red and yellow
jasper rock, flintz, quartzite, kaolin, and sandstone
porcelanite, resting on gypseous clays of cretaceous
age."&#8212;H.Y.L.B. At 11.30 we reached a point where the hills
come right down on to the creek. The identical hill whose foot is
washed by the creek we ascended, and found the "true matrix of
the opal a quartzite highly ferruginous."&#8212;V. S. There was
milk opal in places. It seems to me that this rock is much harder
than the Queensland opal matrix. At 12.30 the packs started, and
we resumed our journey. The track follows closely the course of
the creek, but occasionally leaves it and goes around a hill. At
3.30 we camped on a very pretty spot on the creek bank; nice
waterholes and abundance of good feed for the camels. A flood
8ft. high had recently passed down, forming at one place a very
large and deep waterhole, shaded by immense gums&#8212;a very
cheering sight, and made us hope for some such spot a few months
hence, on which to form a dep&#244;t. Most magnificent feed of
every sort. Mr. Streich has bad some opportunities to-day to
study the geological features, whilst Mr. Helms is kept very busy
indeed, as, owing to the rains, both insect and plant life are
plentiful. Hadji had a narrow escape from a serious accident
to-day; he was riding the young bullock, and had dismounted to
pick up an empty bottle. When he was about to remount the camel
jumped up suddenly, and Hadji lost his hold; his foot remained in
the stirrup, and for a few moments his head hung downwards,
whilst he held on to the nose line and called to the camel to
"wishta". Fortunately the beast lay down without hurting him, but
he certainly was in a critical position, and might have had his
brains dashed out. Looked like rain. At 9 a. m., ther. 58&#176;,
bar. 29.480.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May 17th.</i>&#8212;Morning broke fine and clear.
Held Divine service at 9.15 a.m.; all attended. Remained in camp,
men arid animals enjoying the rest. An afterglow in the western
sky lingered long after the sun had disappeared. At 9 a.m., ther.
62&#176;, bar. 29.365.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May 18th.</i>&#8212;Fine clear cold morning, heavy
dew. Started at 9.23. Abdul is suffering from a swollen groin,
having been kicked by one of the young camels. Mahmoud Azim was
also kicked a few days ago, and has been very lame. At 12.5
passed a well and left the Arkaringa Creek and travelled over
undulating stony downs exceedingly well bushed and grassed with
Mitchell and other varieties, mulga, myall, and gidgea, and
quondongs, passing between hills with the tableland close on our
right. Camped at 5.10, having travelled about twenty miles.
Passed numerous claypans with water; very good feed. A camel I
was riding last week, and which I noticed went lame if ambling,
was, although only carrying a pair of empty watercasks, walking
very lame with the off hind leg, the injury evidently being at
the hock or knee. It seems that about three of the camels were
slightly injured in the trucks. At 9 a.m., ther. 58&#176;, bar.
29.610.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May 19th.</i>&#8212;Clear fine morning. Started at
9.23. Travelled over rolling stony country exceedingly well
clothed with good bushes and grass between table-topped and
peaked hills. At one time an extensive view was obtained over
about 1,600 square miles. Crossed a branch of the Arkaringa
Creek; fine waterholes, and large white gum trees, mulga; then
the country changed to tertiary sandy loam, with stony flats;
very good stock country. At eighteen miles the change was very
marked; at twenty and a half miles camped on the edge of a Bay of
Biscay flat covered with water and polygonum, in the centre of
which was the Wintana well (water very white), a bastard saltbush
growing over the flat. I shot four clucks. The tracks of dogs,
kangaroos, and emus were very numerous. At 9 a.m., ther. 54&#176;,
bar. 29.360.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May 20th.</i>&#8212;Abdul is still unfit for
work. Ten camels missing this morning. Started at 10.20, taking
40 gallons of water with us, and travelled over a good mulga
country, with grass, reddish sandy loam flats, and low sand
rises. Tracks of dingo, emu, and kangaroo very numerous. Mahmoud
Azim brought eight emu eggs on with him this morning; the
contents were extracted and eaten, the shells being saved. Our
camp at eighteen miles was situated in dense mulga. At 9 a.m..
ther. 57&#176;, bar. 29.235.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May 21st.</i>&#8212;Camels much split up and
difficult to find, although the ground being sandy there can be
no possibility of losing any. All the camels but thirteen brought
in. Having but little water in camp and no doubt that the other
camels would shortly be brought in, we loaded up and started,
leaving Hadji and Mahmoud out looking for the camels, Hadji
riding; Ramsay being left in charge of the left, loading. In half
a mile came on two camels sent them back with Alumgool; and we
proceeded for seventeen miles over the same description of
country, except that the soil was harder and we crossed some
loose stones with a low sandstone range ahead and closing in on
our course, which is nearly west now. At 9 a.m., ther. 59&#176;,
bar. 29.550.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May 22nd.</i>&#8212;At 1.15 a.m. the dog Edward
came into the camp, causing us to expect the other members of the
party with the lost camels, but when we resumed our journey at 11
a.m. there was no sign of them. Left a canteen with 3 gallons of
water in it hanging up a tree. We had to go on to Arcoellinna
Well, as we had but little water in camp. In three miles we
touched the sandstone range and worked over a sandy gap and
changed our course to north at seven miles, soon entering
splendid feed, saltbush and other good green bushes. Reached
Arcoellinna Well at 4 p.m., seventeen miles; the packs arriving
about half an hour later. We had a good supper of emu egg
omelette, wild cabbage, and fresh potatoes. At 8.15 p.m. I
started on Misery, taking 4galls. of water; we had no other
canteens with us. At 10.50 stopped for half an hour to give
Misery a feed, and then on four miles met Ramsay and the others
coming along, but seven camels short; they having left their camp
at 4 p.m. the day before. Ascertained for the first time that six
camels were out of hobbles Mahmoud having brought and then left
the camels close to the camp while he went back for some others;
they must have at once started off back. Had I known this I would
have stayed and soon run their tracks down. I cannot understand
why these fellows could not follow the tracks. The men continued
their journey on to the camp. I returned with them for four
miles, when I turned out on good feed to await their return. At 9
a.m., bar. 29.080, ther. 66&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May 23rd.</i>&#8212;They reached the camp at 6
o'clock a.m., and immediately made preparations to return on
riding camels. At 10 o'clock Hadji on Mr. Wells' camel, Mahmoud
Azim on Mr. Streich's, Mahyedin on his own, with a week's rations
and 9 gallons of water came. I packed up and we travelled
twenty-eight miles farther back, passing old camps at 11.20 and 4
o'clock, having stopped three-quarters of an hour for a pot of
tea. Stayed ten minutes at the last camp making everything snug
against rain. Camped on top of a sandhill on the lost camels'
tracks at 5.10 p.m. At 9 a.m., at Arcoellinna Well, ther.
66&#176;, bar. 28.960.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May 24th.</i>&#8212;Her Majesty the Queen's
birthday. Started at 8 a.m., Hadji and Mahyedin, to go along the
road to Wintana Well and swamp to see if the camels had made in
there for a drink; if not then they would still follow the road
back to the Arkaringa Creek and follow that up to the northwards,
as the camels making back to Warrina must cross that creek, in
which is good water and plenty of feed; Mahmoud and I to follow
the tracks to where they were last seen, and endeavor to track
them on. If unable to do so, we would make straight on for
Arkaringa Creek, head and follow it down to meet Hadji, thus
making a circle around the camels if neither of us found their
tracks. Mahmoud led me on for a couple of miles and then said,
"Look out for the tracks now." After searching for some time, he
said, "I lose them; must make back to camp and start again." He
did not know where the camp was. I growled at him for not getting
on the tracks at once. It was 10 o'clock when we again left the
camp, this time on the tracks. Without any difficulty we tracked
them for eight miles, to where Hadji and Mahmoud had lost the
tracks, on hard stony ground. This was twelve miles from the camp
where the camels strayed from. Hadji had followed the tracks this
far on foot, having first knocked up his camel by galloping in
and out like a madman through the mulga scrub, and then gave
himself up for lost, and Mahmoud found him sitting under a bush
with his head between his hands. He started up, exclaiming "I am
so glad to see you; I thought I would die." They were both unable
to follow the tracks any further, and returned to camp. There
were only the tracks of six camels visible. We dismounted, and
with much difficulty tracked them for five miles, when we lost
the tracks. As the camels had been keeping a very direct course
we continued on, and in one mile we came upon a big swamp, at
which the camels had. not been. Concluding that they must have
turned off, we went back to where we had seen the last dung,
which was the last sign of them we had seen. Found the spot
without any difficulty, and with some careful searching found a
little more, the camels having turned sharp to the left. We with
great difficulty tracked them over the stony ground for one mile,
when we came to another swamp, at which they failed, owing to the
soft ground, to get a drink. Followed the tracks up to the same
hollow to where two camels had drunk, but the others were not so
venturesome, and went away without a taste. A little farther on
they left the hollow and resumed the original direction, which we
followed for about a mile, when we could not track them any
farther owing to the excessively hard ground and stones, the
whole country being dense mulga with occasional clay flats with
stones and saltbush. Mahmoud wanted me to leave the tracks and go
on the Arkaringa Creek, as we were making such slow progress, and
the camels had four days' start of us and were without hobbles. I
was very loth to leave the tracks. We left the tracks on our
right, by making a detour to the left, and crossed over a stony
range for three hours. Twelve miles we rode over soft country,
and camped on the very head of the Arkaringa Creek, on rolling
stony downs, Bay of Biscay, with good saltbush. herbs, and grass,
extending as far as we could see to the east. Mulga; some small
waterholes. At Arcoellinna Well. The aneroid barometer read at 9
a.m. ther. 66&#176;, bar. 28.980.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May 25th.</i>&#8212;Retraced our steps at 7.30 to
some soft ground, which we followed southerly. At one mile we
came on a good waterhole; in three miles the first gums appeared,
so that we were on the extreme head of the Arkaringa&#8212;just
where I wanted to be. Followed the creek down for eight miles,
which has immense and numerous waterholes, when we found a gum
creek coming in from the right, with Hadji's tracks going up it.
Followed up that for six miles, when we came to where Hadji had
camped last night. Still proceeded, wondering why he had not
returned, as it was evident we should soon lose the creek. In
about two miles we found we had missed Hadji's tracks, and we
could not understand where he had gone to; the country on both
banks being very stony it was no use looking for his tracks.
After some consideration decided that, as the camels must be
inside the circle that we had described, we must go back to where
we left the tracks yesterday, and endeavor to follow them out. I
was much put out at not meeting Hadji, as I did not know where he
would make for. Mahmoud was completely perplexed, and trusted
entirely to me to find the place. I just ejaculated, "God guide
me right!" and I looked to our right, and saw what appeared a
faint smoke arising through the mulga. Called Mahmoud's attention
to it, but he could not detect it. After a few moments' watching
I decided it was smoke, and presently some crows swept out of the
blue ether and circled over the haze. Turned to it, and in half a
mile or so found Hadji with the six lost camels, he having found
them just previously, having heard during the night a faint
tinkling of the bell on one of them. Strange that we should have
so shaped our travelling as to meet just where the camels were! I
was indeed thankful, as they were six of our best Beltana camels.
Having found water and good feed they had been content to stay
about for a few days. We steered for Wintana Well, the Afghans
not having the slightest idea where it was. In six miles we
struck the track, one and a quarter miles west of the water. We
fully expected to find the other camel here, as he had been some
days without water. Camped. No signs of the lost brute, which is,
I find, a regular "hatter", always poking away by himself. I am
much disappointed with the bushmanship of the Afghans. They
cannot track any better than I can, and they have no idea of
locality; they are easily bushed, and much afraid of losing
themselves. I cannot see any reason why the camels could not have
been found on the first day if the men had only stuck to the
tracks; they must have turned back when within two or three miles
of the animals. At Arcoellinna Well. At 9 a.m., ther. 65&#176;,
bar. 29.980.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May 26th.</i>&#8212;Clear, warm, heavy dew. I
intend sending one man on with the camels to where the goods are,
while the rest of us will endeavor to pick up the tracks of the
still missing camel. At 8.45 we started going on south side of
the track to intercept any tracks. Hadji and Mahyedin went on the
north side of the track and I rode along the track for five miles
further, when I turned off on the same side to run a smaller
circle around the camp. At 1 o'clock I found the lost camel's
track north-west of the camp and followed it for two hours in and
out amongst the older tracks until it got mixed up with a lot of
others on a hard piece of ground, when I could not pick it up
again. Went for Mahmoud, but he could not do so well as I could.
Decided that the camel was close. Hadji came on and reported that
he had seen the camel's track on the road north of the camp,
going away from the camp. He said he had put some bushes on the
track to mark the spot. Just at dark the camel came into the
camp, evidently attracted by the bells of the others. Thus he had
strayed about for six days. He had been on some parakylia, and
looked very well. At Arcoellinna Well. At 9 a.m., ther. 65&#176;,
bar. 28.600.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May 27 th.</i>&#8212;I started at 7 o'clock,
leaving the others to follow with the loading. At 10.35 passed
the old cave; at 11.20 turned out on good roley poley. I saw no
sign of Hadji's mark, so conclude he must have been on one of the
pads close to the camp instead of on the main track. On again at
12.20 and reached Arcoellinna Well&#8212;thirty-six miles. Found
everything right. Mr. Leech still on crutches. Mr. Wells had been
out to north side of Chambers' Bluff, and recommended our going
that route instead of direct to Mount Illbillie. Slight rain in
evening and more during night. During my absence Wa Wee
waterhole. had been visited and photographs taken. The water at
Arcoellinna is contained in shallow wells 6ft. deep in a
watercourse in a gap. Very good water, and I think a fair supply.
Mr. Chambers must have had a long camp here as he had erected a
very substantial hut. Ther. 67&#176;, bar. 28.940.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May 28th.</i>&#8212;Showery. The camels arrived
at noon, but as the showery weather continued I decided not to
move on. At 9 a.m., ther. 66&#176;, bar. 28.860.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May 29th.</i>&#8212;Threatening for rain. Started
at 10.5, and at 3 p.m. drizzling rain began to fall. Reached the
Soakage in a gum creek north of Mount Chandler at 4.15 (twenty
miles), and camped, rain becoming heavier. Made everything snug.
Steady rain from N.E. continued. At 9 a.m., ther. 60&#176;, bar.
28.720.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May 30th.</i>&#8212;Heavy lowering clouds;
everything damp and uncomfortable. Hadji was putting the saddles
on, when I called his attention to some sore backs. He said, "Put
saddles on wet hacks make sores worse." I said, "Go and have your
breakfasts, and put the saddles on afterwards." He said that was
not their way of doing it. I persisted, and he rattled off a lot
of jargon about his business and my business and fifteen years
with Mr. Phillipson. Of course I had my way, and we did not start
until 10.45, and followed a pad westerly to an old camp, from
which we took two augers, three files, one old shovel, one adze,
one old axe, a medicine chest, and one bar of steel. Still
followed the pad over excellent country with ground very soft
owing to the recent rains. At least half an inch most have fallen
during the last two days, plenty of water lying about. At ten
miles left the pad and travelled on bearing 240&#176;. Camped at 5
p.m., having made about seventeen miles; very good country the
whole day. At 9 a.m., ther. 67&#176;, bar. 28.500.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May 31st.</i>&#8212;No rain, but heavy dew. Started
at 9 a.m. On bearing 246&#176; to low part of range south-east of
Mount Illbillie a fine hill to the south of that mount is in
view. Granite broken hills on our right all day, with a black sea
of mulga stretching far away on the left. At 3 p.m. passed a
native well close to a granite outcrop; at noon we stopped at a
granite hill to have a shot at some wallabies while waiting for
the caravan to come up. Having made about twenty-three miles we
camped at 5.20 on a mulga watercourse, about one mile from a
much-broken granite range. Heavy mulga but good country all day.
Heavy rains have fallen over here recently, rendering the
travelling heavy, anti we have left a pad behind us that will
take a long time to efface. One of the young pack camels came in
very lame, having run a mulga stake into the side of his near
fore foot, but the lameness appears to be in the shoulder. Very
good feed. At 9 a.m., ther. 53&#176;, bar. 28.350. I forgot to
mention that at Warrina we received the greatest kindness from
all the residents. Mr. and Mrs. Baggaley and all the railway
officers showed us special attention and assembled in force to
see us off.<br></p>
<p><b><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>June, 1891]</b></p>
<p><i>Monday, June 1st.</i>&#8212;Just at dawn we were aroused by
a few drops of rain. Rose, and covered all the goods; but, though
the clouds were heavy and lowering, the rain was but light, and
we were enabled to start at 9.20. Travelled slowly, owing to the
lame camel, along the foot of granite hills, with fine country;
ground very stiff, a sandy soil. Passed one native well. About
1.30 heavy rain suddenly set in, and we were obliged to camp and
pitch the tents in the falling rain on wet ground. We only made
about twelve miles. About three miles from last night's camp
Mount Illbillie bore 265&#176;, Chambers' Bluff 89&#176;, and Mount
Johns 105&#176;. From the top of a low granite hill the view
reminded me of the Barrier Reef scenery, the mulga representing
the sea, and the hills, rising abruptly from the mulga, looked
like the islands. Great masses of bare granite. The rain
continued all the evening and until we went to sleep. Max. temp.
67&#176;, min. temp. 35&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 55&#176;, bar.
28.39; 3 p.m., ther. 50&#176;, bar. 29.10; 2,000ft. above sea
level.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June 2nd.</i>&#8212;The morning broke cloudy and
threatening for rain. Travelled through dense mulga, with
numerous kangaroo pads leading to the ranges. Old native camps
numerous; patches of country burnt last summer, but no recent
signs of their presence. Started at 10.45 in a slight drizzle,
but with the loads covered and well prepared for rain. At six
miles crossed a small gum creek coining out of the Jubillie Range
(eastern end), with water in it. One mile farther came on fine
open country, with good camel feed and a nice running stream
emerging from under an immense granite hill. Camped. The lame
camel travelled fairly; but the seat of the injury is now
apparent, being in the shoulder, a very severe sprain, and I am
afraid. we shall have to leave him. The sun came out at 3 p.m.,
and dried our things splendidly. When up the creek looking for
water I saw the fresh track of a native&#8212;the first we have
seen on the journey. After 4.30 Mr. Wells, Helms, and I climbed
up this rocky hill, which is about 1,000ft. high, and had a very
grand panoramic view of the surrounding country. The climb was
one of the best I have ever had, and extremely interesting. Clear
night, promising fine weather. The mosses, lichens and ferns,
ti-tree, rushes, and other growth show a moist climate or
continuous rains. Max. temp. 60&#176;, min. temp. 34&#176;. At 9
am., ther. 56&#176;, bar. 28.18.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June 3rd.</i>&#8212;Having now reached the
Everard Ranges our work begins. Mr. Leech is just able to hobble
about without the crutches, but has to be very careful. Very
heavy dew. No signs of the native. The doctor took Gwynne with
him, and they were away all day in the ranges photographing. I,
Wells, Streich, and Helms rode along the south foot of the range,
and in two miles passed the Soakage, the water now running
strongly down a gum creek out of a fine gorge. Two miles farther
on we left our camels and ascended Mount Illbillie, which is a
grand bare round granite peak, with very broken and rough granite
hills, gorges, ravines, and precipices, with streams of water in
every gully; mosses, ferns, rushes, mulga, ti-tree, acacia,
numerous flowering shrubs, scented grasses, patches of <i>Triodia
irritans</i>, whitegum trees in the ravines and creeks; height
above sea level 3,010ft., above plain 1,000ft. It occupied us one
hour to climb to the summit; a very fine view was obtained.
Returned to camp at dark in a shower of rain. Mr. Leech marked a
tree at this camp, close under the rocks on the eastern bank of
the creek, at the entrance to the gorge,
<small>D.L./</small>3.6.91(within diamond). The ground, which is
reddish sandy with a good admixture of clay, is very soft indeed,
and very tiring for the camels. Slight rain continued during the
night. Max. temp. 69&#176;, min. temp. 37&#176;; at 9 a.m., ther.
59&#176;, bar. 28.11; 3 p.m., ther. 61&#176;, bar. 27.125. Mr.
Streich is of opinion that permanent underground water
exists.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June 4th.</i>&#8212;Morning broke with a dense
mist enveloping everything, and a light Scotch mist continued
until 2 p.m. The hilltops were not visible at all during the day,
neither was the sun. We could not move out of the camp or work at
plans. Made bags out of canvas, for the sugar; adjusted the
cases, made hide covers for two canteens, covers for guns and
tools. Fixed up a box to carry the tools. Just before sundown a
single black-fellow came to the camp; he knew a few words of
English. We fitted him out with some covering, a knife, tobacco,
pipe, piece of Turkey twill, some food, and sent him off, hoping
that to-morrow he will bring up his companions, as I want to get
a boy from here if I can, having been unable to obtain one at
Warrina. Night closed in with a falling barometer and very
threatening for rain. Max. temp. 54&#176;, min. temp. 37&#176;. At
9 a.m., ther. 51&#176;, bar. 28.22; 3 p.m., ther. 54&#176;, bar.
28.18. We are looking forward to a splendid journey, so much rain
having fallen, and we can see good hills away some fifty miles to
the south-west, to which we shall make.</p>
<p><i>Friday, June 5th.</i>&#8212;Rain during the night. Morning
broke very cloudy, and slight rain fell during the day,
preventing our moving onwards. The aborigine came soon after
daybreak, bringing with him a boy about 14 years of age, whose
hair was very light colored, probably by the use of ashes. Not
yet circumcised, although the man is. The doctor measured them,
and we got the following words from them:&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 6th.</i>&#8212;One camel missing and the
adjustment of the loading delayed our start. Day very cold and
cloudy with S.E. wind; ther. 33&#176;. Everard
Ranges.&#8212;Started at noon, leaving the camel with the
sprained shoulder here on good feed and water. Went westerly for
two miles to the soakage under Mount Illbillie, which we made our
starting-point, going 248&#176; for 122 chains, 232&#176; for
eighty-six chains, 263&#176; for seven miles thirty-six chains,
passing first through hills and then plains lightly covered with
mulga and broom. Young herbage of all sorts plentiful. Saw the
fresh tracks of two natives. Billie, as we christened the
Illbillie native, is coming along with us riding on one of the
camels. The adjustment. of the loading; left one camel empty and
some of the others lightly loaded. Camped at 5 p.m. on the north
side of an isolated granite peak, on the east foot of which is a
soakage giving water by sinking in the (native wells) reddish
sandy soil. Fine open country to the south, dense mulga to the
north. About three miles distant, bearing 8&#176;, is the top of a
large granite hill. To the eastwards is a black outcrop which Mr.
Streich did not think worth visiting. Mount Illbillie bears
63&#176; 30', the camp 28&#176;, half a mile distant. The aborigine
seems contented, and will, I hope, go on a few days. Tracks of
natives going south fairly numerous. Distance for day ten miles.

<p><i>Sunday, June 7th.</i>&#8212;Camp 1&#8212;Morning broke
clear and cold. Having been delayed so much through wet weather,
I decided to travel to-day; accordingly we started at 9.40. Three
friendly natives came in just before we started and travelled
with us all day; they were fine strapping young fellows. We
travelled on the same bearing as yesterday, along the west foot
of a granite range over the same class of country for about
fifteen miles, when we turned on bearing 320&#176; for one and a
quarter miles to an isolated granite outcrop situated on a high
reddish sand ridge. Ascended with the theodolite, and tool; the
bearings which arc in Mr. Wells's fieldbook. At one point during
the march I took bearings:&#8212;287&#176;, to a low point about
twenty miles distant; 292&#176;, bare granite peak eight miles
distant; 317&#176;, Mount Eunyarrinna trig; 327&#176;, by mountain
in the Musgrave Ranges; 351&#176;, to peak five miles; 75&#176; to
Mount Illbillie trig. At eleven and a quarter miles we passed a
bare granite outcrop about 70ft. high, whose top has an area of,
say, ten acres, in which are numerous rock waterholes, most of
them about 6in. to 12in. deep only, but one was 20ft. x 9ft. x
5ft. 6in. deep; numerous native mia-mias on the eastern side.
Evidently a good supply of soakage water would be obtained by
sinking, although I could not find any native wells. The country
passed over is undulating sandy with high granite hills on our
left and right, with occasional outcrops of granite on our course
or close to; at eight miles an outcrop of oolitic limestone
occurred. The last two miles were sandy, mulga, brooms, acacias,
currant bush, roley poley, speargrass, and a luxuriant crop of
herbs. Evening very cold indeed, promising a frost. Max. temp.

<p><i>Monday, June 8th.</i>&#8212;Camp 2&#8212;Heavy frost. Ther.
27&#176; at sunrise. Started at 9.40 a.m. on bearing 247&#176; 40'
for range, and travelled over an undulating, sandy country, with
an occasional granite rock just showing and limestone rises with
hard soil, clayey, producing good grasses, roley poley, &amp;c.
High mulga, acacia, Grevillia, a few clumps of mallee, and good
grass to the Ferdinand, ten and a half miles, which comes from
the N.E. and goes S.W. It has a channel two chains wide, but in
times of heavy flood the width would be six chains; brown sandy
bed, very dry, no recent flood marks. The gum trees, which are
not numerous, are very green, which makes. one judge that water
would be obtained by sinking. Low sandhills on both sides; very
good pasture. Fresh emu and kangaroo tracks numerous; no fresh
native. tracks. Marked a large gumtree where we crossed the
Ferdinand <small>D.L./</small>7.6.91 (within diamond). Half a
mile down the creek metamorphic rocks occur, buck saltbush,
ti-tree, polygonum, and fresh gum trees. I hare no doubt water
would be obtained at shallow depths. The country now becomes
harder; limestone rises, slaty rocks, large timber, black oaks,
saltbush, mulga, many herbs, splendid grasses. Distance about
seventeen miles. Camped at 4.5 p.m. Max. temp. 68&#176;, min.
temp. 27&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 51&#176;, bar. 28.33; 3 p.m. ther.

<p><i>Tuesday, June 9th.</i>&#8212;Camp 3&#8212;Morning clear and
cold, ther. 33&#176;; west wind, few clouds. Eight camels short.
Hadji went out on camel back for them, and just as the first team
was starting he brought in three. In his usual excited way he
called out something, and galloped away. Mahmoud said, "Don't
know; he say he find 'em camel, he leave 'em, he go bring 'em."
Presently he brought in three more, and was terribly excited,
saying, "No have job like this before." Off again. Having left
the other two close to camp he was going for them. He returned
with only one, and I found the other one within 200yds. of the
camp. We got away in detachments&#8212;first Mr. Wells and the
bulk of the caravan; a little later Mr. Leech, the doctor, and
Gwynne; and then Warren followed them. It was 1.30 p.m. when
Hadji, I, and the black-fellow Billie got away. The natives are
still with us, and Billie has made himself quite one of the
party. At about eight and a half miles touched a rocky hill,
having passed over poor country, spinifex, limestone, mulga, and
usual bushes, chalcedony. The hill was of granite and diorite,
and. the eastern hill of this rather important group. The camp
was about one and a quarter miles further on, out between two
sandhills close to a small granite outcrop. The water was
contained in a fine rock tank, with very good camel feed about
the low sandhills. Mr. Wells and Mr. Helms walked on about two
and a half miles to the foot of the main hill, and found a very
good soakage. They then climbed up a peak, and reported seeing
hills a little north of west in the distance. This is to be our
first dep&#244;t. Our course of work will be decided to-morrow,
after I have climbed the mount and laid down our position. This
morning Mahmoud reported having found a native well with water in
it about one mile south-easterly from the camp. Cloudy sky, with
very pretty colored cloud effects. Dep&#244;t 1, camp 4. Max.
temp. 66&#176;, min. temp., 33&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 56&#176;,

hypsometer, 1,850ft. above sea level.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June 10th.</i>&#8212;A number of bearings were
taken from the top of the mountain with the theodolite. I was
accompanied to the hilltop by Messrs. Leech, Wells, Helms, and
the native Billie. Mr. Leech had great difficulty in climbing the
hill. This mountain is composed of granite with diorite dykes. On
the east side there is a very fine soakage&#8212;black
soil&#8212;a small open place with good bushes and herbs with
dense clumps of black wattle, which I believe is, in Western
Australia, considered a good sign for water. A little distance to
the north there is an immense granite boulder outcropping, on the
leaning side of which are some very rude native drawings. The
growth around this bill consists of mulga, acacia, wattles, gums,
mallee, spinifex, waterbush <i>(Pollichia zeylanica)</i>, spear
and other grass, with creepers, roley poley. and other good
herbs. Plotted up our position. A few, drops of rain fell just
before daylight, but not enough to cause us to cover up the
goods. Max. temp. 69&#176;, min. temp. 32&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther.

4.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June 11th.</i>&#8212;Camp 4&#8212;Mr. Wells and
Bob went west to look for water, while Mr. Helms, Billie, and I
went south to examine the country to "Tietkins' farthest". I have
an idea that Mr. Tietkins was close to water when he turned back,
and I want to see if I can find any in the vicinity. We left camp
at 12.3 on south bearing, passing a big granite hill at 12.40=one
and a half miles; at 12.48 (two miles) stopped, and Billie,
pointing 160&#176;, said water short and long way off; 201&#176;,
ditto, and "wollu" (sandhills), and he also said "Kapi warnmunga"
and "Kapi tau", the meaning of which I do not yet know. Lost nine
minutes and resumed our journey on bearing 201&#176; for some
rocks at 2.55; two and a quarter miles we passed the granite
rocks situated in some high sand ridges. Three-quarters of a mile
farther took us to some rock waterholes bearing 240&#176;, where
we camped. Billie and I walked back to the rocks, and I stood up
a granite slab about 3&#189;ft. high and took a record of
bearings. After leaving camp we, in half a mile, entered dense
mulga with patches of mallee and irregular sandhills of red sand
and considerable height, trending northwest, about fifteen to
twenty chains apart; very little spinifex, a good deal of grass.
In four miles the mulga became less dense and more grass
appeared; we passed a native camp (gurndu). Our camp is situated
in a basin, in which is a flat outcrop of granite with numerous
rockholes and a fine soakage. One of the holes has a surface
opening of 2ft. and is deep, going away under the rocks, quite
full of water. Mr. Helms very busy collecting; Billie is very
eager to help him and brings all sorts of stuff to him. At the
dep&#244;t. Max. temp. 66&#176;, min. temp. 35&#176;. At 9 a.m.,
bar. 28.19, ther. 49&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.20, ther. 66&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Friday, June 12th.</i>&#8212;The night was cloudy and warm;
no dew. The camels were close. We started at 8.42, on bearing
213&#176;, over open mulga sandy country; very well grassed. At
five miles the rocks bear 34&#176;, and we were travelling over a
hard flat, with limestone and quartz; saltbush. At five and a
half miles left the saltbush. At six and a quarter miles we
crossed a small watercourse, leading east. At seven miles white
quartz outcrop, striking 315&#176; through a micaceous sandstone,
whose strike is, approximately, 280&#176;. At seven and a half
miles another small watercourse, leading east. At seven and a
quarter miles we were on top of a high sand hill or ridge, from
which the Dep&#244;t Mount bore 22&#176;. The rocks 34&#176; 30'.
To a hill on the left on the 9th, 60&#176;. To a high hill near
our track, thirty miles distant, 62&#176; 30'. Resuming our
journey, we passed over level hard sand and mulga. At seventeen
miles outcrop of stone passed. In nineteen and a half miles we
were on top of another high sand ridge, but could not see the
hills behind us. Billie pointed 288&#176;, and said, "Kapi
kaitchu, kapi wollu." Pointing south he said, "Kapi nurtpa", by
which I understand no water, or rather, that he does not know of
any water in that direction. Wartunga means a long way. At 4.24
we turned out, having made about twenty miles in six hours of
actual travelling, on bearing 213&#176;. At the dep&#244;t, camp
4. Max. temp. 69&#176;, min. temp. 30&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.34,
ther. 54&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.29, ther. 65&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, June 13th.</i>&#8212;The night was intensely
cold, with very heavy frost. My outer blanket was quite stiff
with the ice. A very heavy mist hung over us, quite obscuring the
sun until 2 p.m., and the sky remained very much clouded; a south
wind blowing. We started at 8.57 on bearing. 213&#176;. In six
miles the sandhills became more irregular, higher, and closer
together. Billie caught an opossum (waiyuta), and an iguano
(milballi). At seven and a half miles an outcrop of sandstone in
the valley between the sandhills. In thirteen and a half miles we
descended on to low, flat, hard country; good spear grass and
geranium, then spinifex came in. And at fifteen miles we came on
a fine large claypan 200yds. or 300yds. in diameter, full of
water, but very shallow. 286&#176; is bearing to a high sandhill
with large, bare, white patch, making it very conspicuous, we
having seen it for some miles; it is distant one and a half or
two miles. There are three peaked sandhills, this being the
middle one; claypan (gingeya). The country passed over to-day is
really very good, being well grassed and bushed. When we were on
top of a high sandhill we could see beneath. us a large valley
trending east and west with a big black sandhill range some miles
on the other side, evidently where Tietkins turned back from.
There were only one or two patches of spinifex to be seen, and
these patches always denoted limestone outcrops. Some good
patches of black oak (<i>Casuarina glauca</i>) and some giant
mallee were seen; we altered our course a little to one of these
white patches, not knowing they were spinifex, and thus we went,
after crossing the spinifex, straight into the claypan, which is
surrounded by exceptionally good stock country, saltbush, spear
grass, and many other good stock bushes. There are a number of
good claypans here and a native well. The drainage is principally
from the west. Where the sandstone is cropping up, having a north
escarpment 12ft. high, strike east and west with a dip to the
south. Oolitic limestone and many clays are underneath. The
shifting sand has nearly covered the top of the rocks. Old native
encampments. Billie was much astonished at seeing the water; he
was busy tracking an emu when we found the water; he tracked it
to its nest and brought in three eggs. I have no doubt a large
supply of water would be obtained by sinking in this basin, and I
look upon it as a very important feature in the country. No wild
fowl. Billie had for his supper one iguano 2&#189;ft. long, an
opossum, and one emu egg. Fifteen miles. At the dep&#244;t, camp
4. Max. temp. 60&#176;, min. temp. 29&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.44,
ther. 57&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.37, ther. 57&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June 14th.</i>&#8212;Very heavy frost; the water on
the claypans was covered with ice. Fine clear morning; easterly
wind. Mr. Helms and I walked to the top of the "conspicuous white
sandhill" mentioned yesterday, and from the top of which a fine
view over sandhill country was obtained. A little north of west
another long hollow or basin lies, with patches of spinifex
showing. On bearing 274&#176; 30' there is a round-top hill
showing blue in the distance, say, about thirty miles; am sure it
is stone, but if a sandhill it must be a very high one. To the
eastward and north-east there is a valley extending, with a
succession of low sandhills for twenty or thirty miles; to the
south all high sandhills. 325&#176; Billie points for water,
85&#176; also. In every other direction it is "Kapi nurtka", which
means, I am sure, "I don't know of any water." Returned to the
camp, and at 12.8 started on bearing 206&#176;. In a quarter of a
mile came on a claypan 300yds. in diameter full of water; at one
and three-quarter miles we were on top of a sandhill with a good
view back over the basin, the last water being visible (the
conspicuous sandhill bears 322&#176;); at two and a half miles the
water was still visible from the top of a high sand ridge; at
three miles, on top of another high sand ridge, the intervening
distance being filled with low and irregular sandhills, could not
see the water, but the conspicuous sandhill was just visible,
bearing 338&#176;; at five miles we were on top of a high
sandpeak, with a narrow depression between us and a high-level
line of sandhills, which extends from south distant eight miles
to west distant four miles, when it tapered down, and another
line of high sandhills could be seen beyond. On the side of the
high hill, which appears to have a long slope of, say, one and a
half miles from valley to summit, can be seen small patches of
spinifex and black oak. The sand is reddish, and the whole
country is densely clothed with bushes, acacias, and
mallee&#8212;some of the giant mallees as seen by Mr. Tietkins.
Estimated that we are just about the spot from where Mr. Tietkins
turned back in 1875, when out in search of water. We might easily
have missed the claypans; and it seems to me more than probable
that, in the valley some three miles further back, where Mr.
Tietkins saw the natives and diamond sparrows, there were some
claypans which he had the misfortune to pass. We now decided to
return to the dep&#244;t by a different route. Billie pointed on
a bearing of 60&#176; for water; accordingly we started on that
bearing at 2.26 p.m. In one and a quarter miles, in a valley, we
found an outcrop of rubbly sandstone; in three-quarters of a
mile, another; in one mile, another&#8212;the whole country being
splendidly grassed. Having travelled four miles, and being on top
of a high sand ridge, I asked Billie, "Which way to the water?"
He pointed bearing 50&#176;. We altered our course, and in one and
three-quarter miles found limestone outcropping with black oaks
of considerable size; at two and a half miles the high sandhills
above the claypans bore 285&#176;; at three and a quarter miles
limestone and spinifex were again met with. At 4.47 we camped,
having travelled about seven and three-quarter miles&#8212;making
for the day twelve and three-quarter miles&#8212;206&#176;, five
miles; 60&#176;, four miles; 50&#176;, three and three-quarter
miles. At the dep&#244;t, camp 4. Max. temp. 65&#176;, min. temp.
29&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 54&#176;, bar. 28.49; 3 p.m., ther.
53&#176;, bar. 28.39.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June 15th.</i>&#8212;Very clear night, with heavy
frost; all the bushes and trees were white in the morning. The
camels were close, but their backs were covered with ice, and we
had to wait some time before they were dry enough to saddle.
Started at 9.8 on bearing 50&#176;. At five and three-quarter
miles, limestone, sandstone, and black oaks; at seven miles,
sandstone, all the intervening country being irregular sandhills,
covered with mulga; at seven and a half miles, a hard flat, with
blackrock and scrub; at fifteen and three-quarter miles, being on
a flat densely covered with different kinds of mulga, we sighted
a rocky cliff, bearing 119&#176;. Billie was surprised at seeing
them, which showed that he had never been in this country before.
We turned towards the rocks and travelled up a densely scrubby
flat of hard yellowish clay, in Which were some Bay of Biscay
holes containing, in one or two instances, a little water; in
four miles we reached the rocks. Examination showed the hill to
be of very fine-grained hard whitish sandstone, strike or
direction 225&#176;, dipping about 50&#176; to the southward. North
escarpment about 30ft. above the base, and 150ft. above the
plain. The cliff face shows for nearly one mile. On the southern
side the hill is 50ft. or 60ft. above the base. We pitched our
camp in a valley at the back of the rocks, where was good feed.
We did so thus early because there was a large rock face covered
with native drawings, which we wished to sketch. [See Appendix.]
From the top of this hill a big hill bears 58&#176;, the mount
above the the dep&#244;t 6&#176;, the eastern hill of that group
11&#176;, and the claypan sandhill(?) 248&#176;. Country to the
east very black and scrubby. Courses: 50&#176;, sixteen miles;
119&#176;, three and a half miles; total, nineteen and
three-quarter miles. A. little drop of water was found in a small
hollow on the polished surface of a rock. These drawings Billie
called "koolpi", but I could not get any explanation of them from
him. At the dep&#244;t, camp 4. Max. temp. 63&#176;, min. temp.
26&#189;&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 51&#176;, bar. 28.41; 3 p.m.,
ther. 61&#176;, bar. 28.38.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June 16th.</i>&#8212;Fine, clear night; heavy
frost. Camels again close. Billie now points on bearing 25&#176;
for water, and we start in that direction at 8.55. At one and a
quarter miles we found a stony surface; at three and a quarter
miles limestone, with ferruginous sandstone nodules, level
country, open mulga, well grassed; at eight and a quarter miles a
sandstone ridge, with a strike of 355&#176;, continuing on our
course for a quarter of a mile. A high range showing in the east,
which Billie says is sand. 356&#176; to Dep&#244;t Mount; 33&#176;
to a hill parallel to our course on the 9th inst.; 41&#176; to a
shining patch, five or six miles off, looking like water. Billie
now points bearing 5&#176; for water, and we proceeded in that
direction, which takes us along the top of the ridge. Having
travelled one mile I found Mr. Helms was not following me.
Accordingly I stopped and fired off my revolver and cooeed for
him. Presently I espied him away down in the valley, sailing
along happy in the ignorance that our paths were rapidly
diverging. I ascended a high point, and succeeded in attracting
his attention. This bearing 5&#176; is straight for a high hill in
the far distance. Pines were growing on this sandstone hill;
dense mulga and mallee crowded the gullies and flat. At four
miles we stopped for lunch. At 1.52 we resumed our travelling, on
bearing 57&#176; for the "Barepatch". In one and a half miles we
entered a neck of spinifex, with limestone nodules strewing the
ground; at two and a half miles we were in saltbush and samphire,
on the edge of a salt swamp. In three miles we came to a mound
right in the centre of this valley, with salt water at the foot.
The mound is exactly the same as the mounds on the Lake Eyre
basin. "Without doubt this is an extinct spring", Mr. Streich
said. The valley is about two miles long and one mile wide, with
high scrubby sandhills. The natives had been digging gypsum out
of the salt bed. We called this the Purndu Saltpans, "purndu", I
think, meaning salt. Leaving this interesting spot, we went on
bearing 325&#176;, and in a quarter of a mile came to abrupt
cliff-like points, having a solid limestone capping of 3ft.
thickness, covering a marl (calcareous). We ascended 50ft. on to
a level plateau of limestone and chalcedony; spinifex and many
good camel bushes. We camped at 4.25, having made eighteen and a
quarter miles&#8212;25&#176;, nine miles; 5&#176;, four miles;
87&#176;, three miles; 325&#176;, three quarters of a mile;
330&#176;, two miles. From our camp 333&#176;, to rocks and water;
348&#176;, to Dep&#244;t Mount; 351&#176;, for eastern hill;
353&#176;, small distant hill; 39&#176;, black hill; 53&#176;,
distant peak, near Illbillie. It occurred to me that there must
be some superstition connected with this mound or the salt pans,
for Billie would not come down into the valley, but kept up on
the plateau in amongst the bushes. I thought at first that he had
left us, but he was waiting for us. At the dep&#244;t, camp 4.
Max. temp. 69&#176;, min. temp. 29&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 60&#176;,
bar. 28.37; 3 p.m., ther. 67&#176;, bar. 28.29.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June 17th.</i>&#8212;At 8.51 we resumed our
journey on bearing 352&#176;. In two miles we left the level
acacia-covered country (<i>Acacia salicina</i>) and entered the
mulga-covered sandhills, with good grass, alternating with
patches of sandstone and limestone under a covering of spinifex.
At four miles we crossed a sand ridge with mallee and spinifex,
then mulga and good grass. At nine and a quarter miles we turned
on bearing 40&#176; for a water, and on the mile we were on top of
a sand peak, with an outcrop of granite in the hollow half a mile
further on&#8212;82&#176; to big black hill, 331&#176; to
Dep&#244;t Mount, 2&#176; to eastern hill. Descended into the
valley and found some nice rockholes, the principal one being
9ft. by 4ft., by a depth of over 7ft.&#8212;that was the longest
stick I could get&#8212;and bottomed on loose sticks, Dep&#244;t
Mount bearing 327&#176;. Marked a mulga tree on west side of water
<small>D.L.</small> It will be seen that Billie was quite at
fault as to where the water was. He looked about for it at last
night's camp and said he could not find it. Very nice feed on
this basin, as is always the case, the evaporation causing a
moister atmosphere to hang around the rockholes. Six miles of
travelling took us to the camp, where we found all well, Mr.
Wells and Bob having returned two days before and reported having
found a good rockhole, sufficient for three or four days' camp,
some forty miles to the westward&#8212;352&#176;, nine miles and a
quarter; 40&#176;, one mile and a half; 5&#176;, six
miles&#8212;sixteen and three-quarter miles. Mr. Helms and I got
on capitally, although his searching for plants, &amp;c., often
delayed us and made our journeyings short. Still I did not object
to that as his work was having good results, as shown by the
large parcels of various botanical specimens, besides birds'
eggs. reptiles, and insects. We also took specimens of all rocks
met with, as well as the gypsum and encrustation from the mound
on the saltpan. Distance travelled by Mr. Helms and I, about 116
miles. At the dep&#244;t, camp 4. Max. temp. 67&#176;, min. temp.
28&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.43, ther. 52&#176;; 3 p.m., bar.

<p><i>Thursday June 18th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy; ther. 39&#176;.
Dep&#244;t 1, camp 4. Resumed our westerly journeying at 9
o'clock, on bearing 293&#176;, for the hill where Mr. Wells found
the water. Level sandy country, mulga, and grass, patches of
limestone and spinifex. I rode around the south side of the
mountain and found running water on north-west side in a creek,
with a few gum trees. This is not permanent water. Splendid feed,
waterbush, black wattle, gum. Natives went on with the caravan. I
also visited the rockhole bearing 253&#176; from the mount. Found
a hole 15ft. by 2ft., by 7ft. A bare sandhill on the west side. A
feature of these granite outcrops with rockholes is the bare
sandhills surrounding; by bare I mean no trees or large bushes.
Numerous "gurndus". At eleven miles we passed a high hill, and
there were diorite outcrops on our right. At this big rocky hill
there is a native well in a basin, from which the top of the hill
bears 260&#176;, distant fifteen chains. At eighteen miles and a
half we camped on good feed close to a diorite outcrop, whose
strike is generally east and west. Max. temp. 70, min. temp. 40.
At 9 a.m., ther. 47&#176;, bar. 28.47; 3 p.m., ther. 64&#176;, bar.
28.40.</p>
<p><i>Friday, June 19th.</i>&#8212;Camp 5. The caravan proceeded
on same bearing, but I went back to a big hill, at the foot of
which I found a claypan with water on the east side, fifteen
chains distant. From a hill nearly covered by sand the hill to
which the caravan is going bears 285&#176;, the Apex Mount in
Musgrave Ranges 11&#176; 30', Dep&#244;t Mount 112&#176; 30', a
peaked hill 264&#176; 30'. All these hills in this neighborhood
are composed of granite and diorite. From the South Peak Mr.
Wells took a round of bearings with the theodolite. I overtook
the caravan here. Low sandhills, mulga and grass, spinifex. Two
natives had followed Mr. Wells' return track for miles. We passed
the big hill, which is a mass of bare granite, and went on to
Larrie's Rockholes, one and three-quarter miles. Travelled twenty
and a half miles. Camp 6. Max. temp. 60, min. temp. 35&#176;; at 9
a.m., ther. 48&#176;, bar. 28.48; at 3 p.m., ther. 58&#176;, bar.
28.50.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, June 20th.</i>&#8212;Camp 6. Frosty; ther.
27&#176;. Mr. Wells, Gwynne, and I went to the big hill, which I
have named Mount Goolwa, after my birthplace, this being the
anniversary. I think water could be obtained by sinking amongst
the black wattles and gum trees on the western side. The cold on
the top of the hill was intense, a keen easterly wind blowing. A
round of bearings (magnetic) was taken with the theodolite.
Erected a pole, on which was cut <small>D.L.</small>, 20.6.91.
The whole of the country is apparently mulga, clothed with much
spinifex. Sandhills low and irregular, with long valleys or flats
of sandy soil. Max. temp. 57&#176;, min. temp. 30&#176;; at 9 a.m.,
ther. 46&#176;, bar. 28.42; at 3 p.m., ther. 55&#176;, bar. 28.36.
Very good feed, and the camels are doing very well; one or two of
them developing mange rather badly, but it is not safe to rub tar
and grease into their skins while the cold weather lasts.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June 21st.</i>&#8212;Remained in camp. Height
1,575ft.; max. temp. 57&#176;, min. temp. 27&#176;; 9 a.m., ther.
48&#176;, bar. 28.41; 3 p.m., ther. 58&#176;, bar. 28.30. The
doctor photographed a native "gurndu", with our natives sitting
in front. Mr. Helms busy collecting at the different rock
outcrops.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June 22nd.</i>&#8212;Larrie's Rockholes; camp 6.
Dr. Elliot and I, with our two riding camels only and five days'
provisions and water, started to inspect the country to the
westward, the caravan to go to a distant hill in the south-west,
where I hope to obtain water. The natives who are with us do not
know this country. We got away at 9.23, and went on bearing
293&#176; 30' to a hill three and a half miles distant, and took
compass bearings&#8212;113&#176; 30' to pile on Mount Goolwa,
196&#176; flat-topped granite hill six miles distant, 273&#176; to
small black knob seven miles distant. Sandhills, spinifex, mulga,
mallee, poor country. On bearing 273&#176; for two miles, when we
turned to 230&#176; to visit a big hill three and a half miles
distant. Granite and diorite; no water. sand ridges, mulga,
poplars, more spinifex than usual; 277&#176; for three-quarters of
a mile to a point north-west of the hill, and then 268&#176;. At
four and a half miles we passed an outcrop of sandstone, with
fresh natives' tracks. At five and a quarter miles opposite a
hill&#8212;the black knob for which I was steering when on
bearing 273&#176;. Spinifex sand ridges, with valleys half a mile
wide; good mulga and grass, good sandy loam. At 4.10 eight and a
half miles. We camped half a mile east of a granite hill;
acacias, grass, spinifex. After turning out we ascended the hill,
and took a round of bearings with the prismatic compass. I am not
very careful with the traverse, as I ascend every hill and take
bearings, thus giving a system of triangulation. The compass is
affected more or less on all the hills, owing to the immense
diorite dykes, which have burst through the granite and form a
capping or backbone to nearly every granite hill. With the
caravan. Max. temp. 63&#176;, min. temp. 24&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther.
48&#176;, bar. 28.29; 3 p.m., ther. 61&#176;, bar. 28.39.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June 23rd.</i>&#8212;Frost, N.E. wind. The camels
were two miles away; the doctor's camel, Kangaroo, having made
off back for his mates. Started at 9.20, on bearing 268&#176;; in
half a mile passed a hill of granite, and then went 257&#176; for
a hill; at eight miles saw smoke bearing 243&#176;. This is the
first native's:smoke we have seen since leaving Warrina. At ten
and a half miles we were on top of a sand ridge (white), and
turned a little to our left to visit a rock thirty chains
distant, where we found a rockhole full of water. Top of hill
bearing 278&#176;, about forty chains to the foot of the hill, and
fifteen chains farther to the top. My pocket aneroid read
1,600ft. at foot, and 1,800ft. at top of hill. Took bearings with
prismatic compass. We had lunch, and then started on bearing
304&#176; at 2.20, through mulga with grass; in three and a half
miles sand ridges with spinifex and mallee, which continued to
the foot of the hill, nine and a half miles, where we camped.
Ascended the hill and took several magnetic bearings with a
prismatic compass. This hill is of granite, with a fine basin, or
reservoir, on the south-east side, and a native well full of
water. This reservoir is full of earth, but the natives have dug
out a hole 4ft. deep in which is 3ft. of water. No doubt there is
a very considerable quantity of water contained in that earth.
Gum trees of large size growing between the hills indicate the
presence of water at no very great depth. Pines, mallee, kangaroo
grass 5ft. high. Water in small rockholes. Built a small pile of
stones on the summit of this hill. This morning our travelling
was all through spinifex, sand, and mallee and limestone. In the
afternoon we had much more grass. Very nice feed around this
bill. We saw six emus, but they were very wild, and ran off as
soon as they sighted us, some 600yds. distant. Courses and
distances travelled:&#8212;268&#176;, thirty chains, 257&#176;, ten
and a half miles; south, thirty chains; 278&#176;, thirty chains;
304&#176;, nine and a miles. Total, twenty-one miles. With the
caravan. Max. temp. 73&#176;, min. temp. 22&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.
28.40, ther. 44&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.34, ther. 69&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June 24th.</i>&#8212;We started at 9.24, on
bearing 224&#176;; at four miles entered mulga, with grass, and
limestone outcropping; at four and a half miles good
bushes&#8212;saltbush, quondongs&#8212;to five miles, clay soil;
at ten miles came to a native well in a rock basin, a good
quantity of water, ten chains further to top of the hill, which
is of granite, with a diorite dyke running through it. Height,
above plain, 200ft.; above sea level, very approximate, 1,860ft.
From the summit I took a round of bearings with prismatic
compass. After lunch we proceeded on a bearing of 151&#176;,
starting at 2.2 t p.m. Camped at 4.35, having travelled seven and
a half miles, over poor country&#8212;sandhills covered with
spinifex and mallee. Numerous kurrajong or ordnance
trees&#8212;the first seen on this journey. It was pleasing to
see those ranges to the south-west. 224&#176; for ten miles,
151&#176; for seven and a half miles&#8212;seventeen and a half
miles. With the caravan. Max. temp. 70&#176;, min. temp. 24&#176;.
At 9 a.m., ther. 51&#176;, bar. 28.53; 3 p.m., ther. 66&#176;, bar.
28.39.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June 25th.</i>&#8212;At 9.2 a.m. we resumed our
journey on hearing 151&#176;. Entered good mulga. At two and a
half miles sandhills, which continued for half a mile; then the
country began to improve; mulga and grass, with numerous fresh
native tracks. At eight miles we came to a good rockhole at the
foot of a low granite and diorite hill, being only about 60ft.
above the surrounding country; still it was plainly visible for
more than twenty miles. Turned the camels on the good feed, and
went to the top and took bearings with the prismatic compass. On
the east end of these rocks is a rockhole, 27ft. x 2ft. 6in. x
2ft. or 3ft., a quantity of brushwood and loose stones having
been thrown in by the natives to prevent evaporation and loss
through the animals drinking; I was unable to ascertain the true
depth. The rockhole on the north side is 40ft. x 7ft. x over 4ft.
deep. There is a small basin close by, 2&#189;ft. x 2ft. x
3&#189;ft.&#8212;a beautiful bath. Splendid camel feed on the
flat and sandhills surrounding the rock; numerous native
"gurndus". At 1.32 we resumed our journey on bearing 114&#176; to
the hill at which I expect to find the caravan camped awaiting
us. We passed through fine mulga, with good grass; a few
spinifex-covered sandhills. We reached the hill at 5.30, and saw
the tracks of two camels as having come to the hill and gone away
again, but no sign of the camp. Climbed to the top of the hill
whilst the doctor was letting the camels go, and saw the camp in
a gully on the other side. Quickly descended, and went into the
camp. Was disappointed to hear that there was no water here, but
Mr. Wells reported the existence of a good rockhole some eight
miles back. Travelled 101&#176;, eight and a half miles; 114&#176;,
fourteen miles&#8212;twenty-two and a half miles. With caravan.
Max. temp. 72&#176;, min. temp. 30&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 59&#176;,

<p><i>Friday, June 26th.</i>&#8212;Sent the camels to rockhole
found by Mr. Wells. Preparing stores, &amp;c., for Mr. Wells to
take on a flying trip; he is only expected to be away twelve
days, but will give him three weeks' rations. He will take Ramsay
and Mahmoud Azim. Camp 9. Lat., 27&#176; 20' 54"; variation of

<p>"June 22nd.&#8212;Left camp at 9.30 a.m., bearing to 223&#176;
30'. Stopped at 10.25 at granite outcrops, with black wattles
growing at base. saw native drawings here. Left at 10.48; stopped
at 12.7 at granite hill, with wattles, and took bearings. Altered
bearing to 222&#176;, and left at 12.46. Granite hill to the right
at 1.8, with wattles and natives' tracks. Left here at 1.23;
stopped at 2.58. Left at 3.1, and camped at 4.18 under a broken
range of diorite Bearings and distance for the
day:&#8212;223&#176; 30', 220 chains to granite outcrops; 223&#176;
30', 336 chains to granite. hill; 222&#176; 0', ninety-three
chains to granite hills to right of course; 222&#176; 0', 380
chains to diorite range; and 222&#176; 0', 327 chains to camp.
Total distance, seventeen and a half miles. Country passed over
to-day of low red sandy ridges, intersected by flats of spinifex,
bearing about 290&#176;. Belts of mulga and grass in places, all
fairly open; wattle bush, bloodwood, acacia, currant bush, and
various other bushes; occasional isolated granite hills and
outcrops. Limestone outcrops in vicinity of diorite range where
we camped. The native, Tommy, accompanied us to-day, but the
others left this morning. Noticed numerous tracks of natives,
including children, but could see nothing of them although they
were in the vicinity.</p>
<p>"June 23rd.&#8212;Camp 7. A strange black-fellow came into the
camp this morning and may accompany us to-day. Bearing of range,
295&#176; for half a mile; 115&#176; (from gap) for half a mile,
where there is another gap of half a mile; the range continues on
(broken) to bluff end at highest point to eastward (position
fixed). Left camp at 8.50 a.m., on bearing 265&#176; 30', to
granite outcrop, the caravan going on bearing 237&#176; 30', to a
prominent knob, distant nine and a half miles. I struck a granite
outcrop at seven miles and took bearings. Camped at 4.1. Courses
and distances travelled:&#8212;237&#176; 30' to prominent black
knob, nine and a half miles, bearing to hill we are starting for;
208.46, eight miles twenty chains to camp, making seventeen and
three-quarter miles for the day. Country passed over
to-day:&#8212;At the granite outcrop visited are numerous
rockholes on top, but none over 6in. deep. At the prominent black
knob is a native soakage, with water. Country of a poor nature.
Ridges, bearing 290&#176;, of red sand covered with spinifex and
numerous bushes; flats between of open bushes and spinifex (burnt
in places), with outcrops of limestone. Occasional belts of mulga
and grass; few bloodwoods, poplars, mallee, and little grass. The
two natives suddenly disappeared this morning.</p>
<p>"June 24th.&#8212;Camp 8. Left camp on same bearing, 206&#176;,
at 9 a.m. At 10 arrived at hill, which is of granite and capped
with diorite, 150ft. above the flat and 1,530ft. above sea level.
Camped at foot of the hill and examined the vicinity for water,
but could find none. Tried sinking in low flat, but struck the
granite rock. Plotting up work done until 3.30 p.m.; then
ascended the hill with the theodolite to take bearings to all
hills visible. Worked out set of stars for observation on 25th.
Camp 9; height 1,840ft.</p>
<p>"June 25th.&#8212;Camp 9. Left camp with riding camel at 9.30
a.m. to look for water. Found none in the vicinity of camp, so
proceeded to granite hill, bearing 7&#176; 8', and distant about
eight miles. Found no water here, but seeing some old wurleys to
the west of the hill I concluded there must be rockholes or water
not far distant. After hunting around I found a large rockhole in
a gully a quarter of a mile from the hill, about due north, 20ft.
long, 15ft. wide, and from 3ft. to 5ft. or more deep. Sufficient
water to last the camels for four weeks, in my opinion. Returned
to camp at 3 p.m. The other members of the party were pleased to
hear of my good fortune. Found Mr. Lindsay had not yet come to
camp, but they returned at sundown, having had a good trip.
Plotting up work and preparing for a flying trip to south. N.W.
wind, sky half clouded, lightning to south during evening. Lat.

<p><i>Saturday, June 27th.</i>&#8212;Mr. Wells, Ramsay and
Mahmoud left on their flying trip. We started at 9 a.m., and
travelled along my pad to the rockhole discovered by me on the
25th, fourteen miles back. I did this to have a Sunday's rest on
good feed for the camels, they not having had much for the past
few days. Mr. Wells' course was south-easterly to visit a hill I
had seen from the claypans, south of No. 1 dep&#244;t, on the
14th instant., and which is visible from this hilltop. It is
apparently a sandstone hill. Camp 10. Max. temp., 36&#176;. At 9
a.m., ther. 58&#176;, bar. 28.17; 3 p.m., ther. 61&#176;, bar.
27.96.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June 28th.</i>&#8212;In camp. Read Divine service.
Busy amongst the loading. Mr. Streich picked up a small piece of
basalt, which had been brought here by the natives. Weather mild
and pleasant, few clouds, S.W. wind. Dr. Elliot photographed a
beautiful specimen of the native willow, which is growing up
amongst the granite rocks. Max. temp. 63&#176;, min. temp.
40&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 59&#176;, bar. 28.06; 3 p.m., ther
62&#176;, bar. 28.00.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June 29th.</i>&#8212;The caravan proceeded on
bearing 194&#176;, while I went on bearing 172&#176; to examine a
hill about fourteen miles distant. At four and a half miles
crossed an outcrop of quartz in a mulga plain, with very good
grass; another quartz reef at eight and a half miles. At nine
miles a diorite dyke, with a S.S.E. strike. At thirteen and a
half miles came to the foot of the hill, having travelled over
splendidly-grassed mulga country, with the usual bushes, and but
very little spinifex, foot of hill 1,720ft. by aneroid, with a
strong S.W. wind; top of hill, 1,925ft., of metamorphic rocks,
with a strike of 65&#176;, very much broken up and rough, covered
with mulga and good grass; good bushes. Very steep on both sides.
Took specimens of the rocks to Mr. Streich. Took bearings to
hills visible, Then, at 2.50, resumed on bearing 250&#176;, to
strike the caravan pad; but a late start and slow travelling, for
various reasons, caused them to do only about eleven miles,
consequently I crossed their bearing some distance in advance,
and had to wait till about 5 o'clock for the signal smoke, which
was some three miles back. At four miles entered saltbush, which
lasted for some distance, then thick mulga and good grass, with
occasional sand ridge and spinifex, acacia, quondong, mallee,
&amp;c. Found an emu nest with ten eggs, which I carried in front
of me for ten miles, and although the eyes of the chicks were
visible, made excellent omelettes. I also carried for Mr. Helms
the nest and eggs of a small bird. Camp 11. Caravan distance,
eleven miles; mine, twenty-two miles. At 9 a.m., ther. 50&#176;,
bar. 28.95; 3 p.m., ther. 64&#176;, bar. 28.07.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June 30th.</i>&#8212;Clear and frosty. Camp 11.
Just as we were at breakfast six native men came up to the camp
quite fearlessly, and were photographed by the doctor. Some of
them have evidently seen whites before, and speak the same
language as the Everard Range natives. Bob's camel showed
symptoms of having eaten poison. Gave him 6ozs. of Epsom salts.
He was lying down and could not be found for some time, thus
causing a late start. Resumed on the bearing of 194&#176; at
10.50, the natives going a short distance with us. Over sand
ridges with mallee and spinifex until we began the gradual ascent
of a quartzite range, which was covered with loose boulders and
fragments of broken rock and dense mulga. After some little
difficulty we found a descent down the precipitous western side,
and camped at 3, under the sandstone peak where I had directed
Mr. Wells to come on to our tracks again. The doctor and one or
two others had crossed the range about half a mile to the left,
and, found a native well with a little water in it, also a little
surface water on some rocks. Gum trees growing in the gully and
creek bed. When loading up this morning I had a 20-gallon cask of
water resting on my knees; my left foot slipped on a bit of
spinifex, owing to the camel shifting, and I experienced like a
galvanic shock extending from the great toe up the front of the
leg to the thigh, then round the back to the right side; reported
it to the doctor, who said "You have stretched your sciatic nerve
and broken some muscular fibres." With considerable difficulty I
managed to ascend the hill, and took a round of bearings with the
theodolite. The view to the south and south-west is very
extensive&#8212;level, evidently sandhills, and dense mulga. The
western escarpment of this range is much broken up; mulga,
acacia, little waterbush. Built a pile, and Mr. Helms cut in the
sandstone rock <small>D.L.</small> Left a note for Mr. Wells,
directing him where to find the water. Distance travelled, twelve
miles. Min. temp. 26&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 55&#176;, bar. 28.31.
Camp 12; lat., 27&#176; 33' 35"; height, 1,580ft. This range
consists of quartzite and grits; 210ft. above the plain.</p>
<p><b><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>July, 1891]</b></p>
<p><i>Wednesday, July 1st.</i>&#8212;Cold and clear. Another
camel poisoned; the other camels are better. My back and leg very
stiff. Leech, Helms, Streich, and I went to look at the water
found yesterday. That on the rocks bears from the pile 353&#176;,
distant one mile. Opened out the native well, from which the pile
bears 177&#176;, distant one mile. Bob's camel, which appeared all
right when brought in, afterwards developed symptoms of having
eaten some irritant&#8212;froth running from the mouth, weakness,
and disinclination to walk; gave him four packets of salts. At
1.10 we left camp 12 on bearing 280&#176; for flat-topped
hill&#8212;Coffin Hill. Travelled over level, hard plain, no sand
until close to the hill; fine mulga and good grass. At seven
miles passed the hill, which is of quartzite and sandstone; foot
1,700ft., top 1,900ft. A fine peak hears 314&#176;, Saw a nice
gully with good feed, and sent the caravan around there, and
camped at 4.35 on northwest side of the hill. Mr. Helms found a
small rockhole; doctor took photographs of the rocks and pines.
Warm, no wind. Camp 13. Min. temp. 26&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther.
55&#176;, bar. 28.31. Travelled seven and a half miles, bearing
280&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, July 2nd.</i>&#8212;Camp 13. Coffin Hill; clear,
cold, calm. Two more camels poisoned, the others are better. Am
quite at a loss to understand what plant is causing the mischief.
Mr. Helms has searched diligently, but cannot recognise any
poison plants. Very peculiar mirage effects over the country to
the westward. Magnificent mountain ranges of fantastic shapes and
high precipitous cliffs. Started at 9.40 on bearing 314&#176;.
Acacias and good grass, mulga. At five miles low granite outcrops
crossed our course. Thicker scrub, acacias, and spinifex;
sandhills on either hand. Tracks of emu, lowan, and kangaroo
plentiful. At ten miles we were at the foot of a bold broken
granite hill, being the outlier of this small group&#8212;foot,
1,750ft.; top, 1,900ft. Found a little water on granite rockhole
out on the mulga flat. Twelve miles took us to the foot of the
peak, where we camped. Good mulga plain, with good grasses and
herbs. Had great difficulty to get the last sick camel along
today. Left him about three miles back. Gwynne and I ascended the
hill, whose height is 2,180ft.; the camp being 1,780ft. at 4.30
p.m., with a moderate northwest wind. Took a round of magnetic
bearings with the theodolite. From this peak a magnificent
panoramic view was obtained of over sixty miles radius. Some very
fine hills to the south-west and northwest. The sandhills to be
seen are irregular and clothed with spinifex. This small range is
of granite boulders, clothed with pines and bushes. Four hundred
feet above base; two and a half miles long by three-quarters
mile, trend east and west. No water, except the very small
rockholes about one mile south amongst the mulga. A limited
extent of very good country&#8212;mulga, grass, geranium. Not
much rain has fallen here. Sent up a fine smoke, and lit a pine
tree, which should be visible to Mr. Wells if he is within thirty
miles. Mr. Leech's camel seems much better. The pack camel Tommy
certainly seemed better, but very weak. On the journey we gave
him one bottle of castor oil, he having had seven packets of
salts previously. The camels who threw up a viscid watery fluid
recovered quickly. Camp 14. Max. temp. 72&#176;, min. temp.
35&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 56&#176;, bar. 28.24; 3 p.m., ther.
68&#176;, bar. 28.13.</p>
<p><i>Friday, July 3rd.</i>&#8212;Camp 14. Few scattered clouds,
light north wind. Hadji reported that the sick Camel, Tommy, was
all right internally, but his head was bad and that he would not
walk. Mr. Leech and I built a pile on the hill, Dr. Elliot taking
Gwynne with him photographing. Mr. Leech then went with Hadji to
see the sick camel, whilst Mr. Streich and I went to look for
water. We rode six miles south-west to some hills and surprised
two natives who were resting under the shade of a bush growing on
some granite rocks outlying from the big hills. One was an old
man, the other I think a young lubra, but as she quickly ran over
the top of the rocks, and hid away like a wallaby, we had but a
glimpse of the figure. The old man was very frightened, but
pointing to the hills said "kapi". Mr. Streich gave him some
tobacco, and we, walking, induced him to go on to where there was
a soakage in a watercourse coming out of a high granite hill. I
do not think the supply of water will be large. The native, then
pointing to some rocks, said "White-fellow, white-fellow", which
we could not understand, but presently Mr. Streich saw some
black-fellows on the rocks. The native then called and beckoned
to them, and soon nine men joined us, amongst them being one we
saw last Tuesday. As we were ascending the hill with all the
natives, to point out where there was any more water, they became
very excited, and, pointing over the valley, said "White-fellow,
white-fellow." Looking back, we saw a native running at his
utmost speed towards us, evidently in a great hurry to join the
group, and share in whatever was going on. He proved to be a very
intelligent man, and had such a happy face that we attached him
to our service, and when asked if there was water at a bald hill
a few miles further on, he replied in the affirmative, which the
others seemed not to be pleased with. I fancy the lubras are
camped on that water, and these men did not want us to go there,
so told us there was no water. The absence of tracks here show
that the natives have not been encamped in the neighborhood. The
same language is spoken so far as we could tell, although some
words are different: for instance, "warru" for fire, instead of
"mukkati". We returned to camp 14, taking with us the intelligent
native. Found that Mr. Leech had brought Tommy to near the camp,
and that Hadji thinks in a few days he will be quite right.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, July 4th.</i>&#8212;Camp 14. Strong variable
winds during the night, warm. Strong warm northwest wind. Tommy
is better, Rajah missing. I went on to visit the bald hill
previously referred to, to see if there was more water there,
instructing Mr. Leech to bring the caravan on to the first hills,
where I would meet them, but as Mr. Leech's camel was missing he
stayed back, and the caravan came on with the scientific officers
and the native in the lead. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.180, ther.
64&#176;. I found the distance to the bald hill to be ten miles,
and also found a small soakage under a big hill on the north-east
side. Very good feed surrounding these isolated, bare, granite
hills. The water supply is very limited, and would only last us a
few days. Sandy country, with mulga and some spinifex. At 3 p.m.,
bar. 28.06, ther. 81&#176;. Returned to the first water, and had
to wait some time before the caravan arrived. Some natives who
were with me were much astonished at the number of whites and the
caravan, becoming quite excited as the members of the Party came
in in somewhat straggling order&#8212;first Messrs. Streich and
Helms and the native, then the caravan, then the doctor and
Warren, then shortly afterwards Mr. Leech and Hadji with the
missing camel, then just before dark Mr. Wells and his party. The
natives must have been bewildered, and wondered how many more
whites there were in the country and what we wanted. Camp 15 is
six miles from No. 14, the intervening country being all sand
spinifex, covered with belts of mulga. Nice feed around the
hills. I travelled sixteen miles, Mr. Wells' report of his trip
was satisfactory, he having gone south to within forty miles of
Giles' track of 1875. The following is the report handed in to me
by Mr. Wells, copied from journal from June 27th to July 3rd
inclusive:&#8212;</p>

8.50 a.m. 28.110, attached ther. 52&#176;; strong wind from
north-west, few clouds. Received instructions from Mr. Lindsay to
examine country to the south. Left camp at 8.50 a.m., accompanied
by R. Ramsay, with two riding and one pack camel, 40galls. water,
and ten days' provisions, bearing 147.30 mag. for hill seen from
camp 9 (hill). Passed over a fairly level country of a red sandy
soil with occasional low ridges of sand, flats clothed with dense
mulga and mulga grass, quondong and bushes, small spinifex flats,
and few limestone outcrops and small ferruginous stones. Camped
for lunch at 12.30, and let camels feed, having travelled nine
and a half miles. Noticed this morning where, the natives had
been digging for grubs some time since, also numbers of emu
tracks. Left again at 1.30 p.m. Travelled for seven miles over
similar country, when we came upon a limestone rise with open
mulga and good saltbush, which we crossed at right angles half a
mile further on, when we again entered similar country to that
passed over during the morning. Seeing no hope of reaching the
bill before dark, camped in dense mulga at 4.45 p.m., having
travelled about eighteen and a half miles for the day. Tied
camels down.</p>
<p>"June 28th.&#8212;Let camels go at 2.50 a.m. Slight dew last
night. Left at 7.20 a.m., and reached hill at 8.25, which is the
highest of a small range of sandstone covered with mulga. scrub;
hill 140ft. above flat and about 1,680ft. above sea level. Took
bearings to all hills visible, this range bearing 233&#176; mag.
and runs out in about seven miles. The country around as far as
can be seen is of dense mulga and occasional open patches of
triodia, with sand ridges intersecting to the south and
south-east. Read aneroid at 9 a.m., 28.375, ther. 53&#176;; slight
south-west breeze, few light clouds. Left again at 9.15 a.m.,
bearing 207&#176; mag., passing over similar country to that of
yesterday, except continuous sand ridges intersecting flats from
ten to forty chains apart and generally bearing about 290&#176;
mag. Camped at 12.30 p.m. for lunch, and let camels feed, having
travelled about twelve and three-quarter miles during morning.
Left again at 1.30 p.m., and travelled on same bearing until 4.30
p.m., when we camped, having travelled nine miles since lunch.
Aneroid at: 3 p.m. 28.400, ther. 66&#176;; few fleecy clouds,
moderate breeze from south-west. Country passed over similar to
morning, except sand ridges more numerous. Observed for lat.
27&#176; 47' 36". Tied camels down at 7.30 p.m.</p>
<p>"June 29th.&#8212;Very cold night; white frost. Let camels go
to feed at 2.45 a.m. Left camp on same bearing at 7.25 a.m. At
four miles ascended a high point and took bearing to hill left
yesterday, 27&#176; mag. Aneroid, at 9 a.m., 28.400, ther.
54&#176;. Cold south-west breeze, clear sky; could see a great
distance to south-east and south&#8212;sand ridges and mulga
flats, apparently similar to that seen here. Camped for lunch at
12.30 p.m., having travelled thirteen miles during morning.
Country passed over of continuous ridges&#8212;some high&#8212;of
red sand generally bearing 290&#176; from ten to forty chains
apart clothed with low mulga scrub and low ti-tree, few acacia
bushes, and tall mallee. Flats of open mulga and well grassed,
and patches of spinifex (triodia), white gums (desert), some
large, and belts of pine. Noticed numbers of parrots
(ring-necks), minahs, crows, and two eaglehawks, and many smaller
birds. No signs of natives were seen to-day, and I don't. think
they ever visit this part of the country. The birds seen, I
consider, do without water at this period of the year. Left again
at 1.30 p.m., and travelled over similar description of country
until 4.36 p.m., when we camped, having come seven miles from
lunch camp. Four miles back from hero I ascended a high point and
took check bearing 27&#176; mag. to hill left on 28th. From here I
could see from twenty-five to thirty miles to the south-east and
south, all apparently similar country to that passed over to-day.
Observed for lat. 48&#176; 2' 30". Tied camels down at 7.30
p.m.</p>
<p>"June 30th.&#8212;Cold, windy night. Let camels go to feed at
2.45 a.m. Made start at 7.25 a.m., and reached a very low gully
at three miles, gradually descending from each sand ridge
crossed; 1,200ft. above sea level, when we again began to rise.
Aneroid at 9 a.m., 28.625, ther. 50&#176;, moderate south-west
breeze, cold, clear sky. At nine miles crossed highest elevation,
which is 425ft. higher than the flat passed at three miles or
1,625ft. above sea level. At ten miles camped for lunch, at noon.
Noticed this morning many tracks of natives, who had apparently
been here about two months since, and during wet weather. Saw a
place where. they had camped, but no sign of water. Left at 1.30
p.m., and continued on same bearing till 3.30 p.m., when I could
see a great distance to the south and south-east and south-west,
all of same appearance of that behind us. Country passed over for
day of high continuous red sand ridges, generally bearing about
290&#176; mag., clothed with low mulga scrub, mallee in small
clumps, large gains (desert), ti-tree bushes, and triodia. Flats
of large gums (desert), mallee, mulga belts, quondongs, spinifex,
and patches of grass. Rather inferior country. Noticed some fair
kurrajong trees, some 2ft. diam. Camped at north side of a low
sand ridge, after crossing a flat of kurrajong and white gums.
Cut blaze &lt;&gt; on east and west sides of a kurrajong 18in.
diam. with letters <small>E.E.E/L.A.W.</small>/30.6.91 (within
diamond), on west side. Aneroid at 3.30 p.m. (camp), 28.500,
ther. 70&#176;, moderate breeze from S.W., cloudy sky. Unable to
observe to-night. Tied camels down at 7.30 p.m. Very little feed
here.</p>
<p>"July 1st.&#8212;Observed early morning, 28&#176; 15' 47" S.
lat. Let camels go at 3.30 a.m. Left camp at 7.15 a.m., bearing
mag. 338&#176;. and after travelling for two miles entered a
jumble of high red sandhills and ridges, some very steep (on
south side). Very miserable country, and clothed with dense mulga
scrub, mallee, and triodia, few kurrajong (saw one 3ft. diam.),
low ti-tree, and small patches of grass. Camped for lunch at
noon, and gave the camels three gallons of water from our kegs,
as they would not feed and were very sulky. Can see a great
distance to south-west from here; all apparently sandhills.
Aneroid at 9 a.m., 28.600, ther. 64&#176;, clear sky, warm.
Travelled about eleven miles this morning. Left again at 1.45
p.m., and travelled over slightly better class of country. Sand
ridges generally continuous, clothed with low mulga scrub and
ti-tree, bearing 290&#176; mag. Flats of mulga fairly grassed, and
triodia, few acacia bushes. Noticed emu tracks, and saw a few
parrots. Camped at six miles, making seventeen in all. From a
high point at camp I could see for a very great distance, say
forty or fifty miles, to west and south-west, all apparently sand
ridges, but lower than here. Tied camels down at 7.30 p.m. Very
poor feed.</p>
<p>"July 2nd.&#8212;Let camels go to feed at 2.45 a.m. Made start
on same bearing 7.50 a.m. At two miles I ascended a high ridge,
and could see a blue range distinctly on our bearing. At 12.15
camped for lunch, having travelled ten miles. Country passed over
this morning of continuous ridges of sand, bearing about.
290&#176; mag. (steep in places), clothed with dense mulga scrub,
mallee bushes, ti-tree, large white gums (desert), and patches of
grass in gullies. Poor country. Aneroid at 9 a.m. on low ridge,
28.350, ther. 60&#176;, clear sky, warm and calm. Saw no tracks of
game or birds, and no sign of natives having ever been in this
country. Left here at 1.20 p.m. and camped at 3.30 p.m. on a
patch of acacia, as the camels were very tired and hungry.
Country similar to that of this morning, except flats being more
open, with abundance of triodia and few acacias and currant
bushes. Sand ridges as usual. Travelled five miles, or fifteen
miles in all. Aneroid at 4 p.m. (camp), 28.575, ther. 76&#176;,
westerly breeze, clouds rising, sky quarter covered. Too cloudy
to observe. Tied camels down at 7.30 p.m.</p>
<p>"July 3rd.&#8212;Observed at 2 a.m. Lat. S. 27&#176; 46' 53".
Let camels go on good feed at 5 a.m. Made start, bearing 22&#176;
mag., at 7.50 a.m. for a range seen from camp 9, and where I
expect to hear from Mr. Lindsay. Passing over open low ridges of
sand (red), bearing generally 290&#176; mag., about forty chains
apart, clothed with triodia, acacia, few mallee, ti-tree, and
bushes; flats, mulga belts, spinifex (triodia), and grass. At
five miles passed low end of sandstone and ironstone range,
bearing about 270&#176; mag., clothed with dense mulga scrub.
Noticed good grass and herbage in this vicinity, also large
mallee, casuarinas, mulga, quondong, acacia in abundance.
Continued on same bearing, crossing open sand ridges and mulga
and grass flats as before, until 12.15 p.m., when we camped on
good camel feed for lunch, having travelled eleven miles.
Continued on same bearing at 1.25 p.m.. and reached bluff end of
low sandstone range at 3.30 p.m., a distance of five
miles&#8212;sixteen in all. Here we found a pile erected by Mr.
Lindsay, with letter of directions regarding water at one and a
half miles north from here, and instructions to follow the pad of
the caravan, as they had left for N.W. Went to water and watered
the camels, and returned to near the pile, and camped thirty
chains off. Bearing to pile 156&#176; mag. Observed for lat.
27&#176; 33' 35". Travelled twenty miles to-day. Tied camels down
at 7.30 p.m.</p>
<p>"July 4th.&#8212;Let camels go to feed at 4 a.m. Left
following pad bearing 280&#176; 30' for prominent flat-topped
hill, which we reached at 10.30 a.m., and found their thirteenth
camp, also instructions to still follow pad, as they had left for
hill eleven miles oft bearing 313&#176; mag. Followed pad, and
camped on good feed at 11.45 a.m. for lunch, having travelled ten
miles. Left again at 1 p.m., and reached hill at 9.45 p.m.,
having travelled about seventeen miles. Found camp No. 14 and a
note from Mr. Leech, saying they had left for hills to S.W.
Followed pad, and reached party at 6 p.m (six miles), and found
all well, having travelled about twenty-three miles for day.
After leaving the marked tree of June 30th, I could not see any
signs of natives having crossed our course for a great period,
and, therefore, consider the tracks noticed before reaching my
furthest point south to belong to natives from the east or
south-east.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 5th.</i>&#8212;Camp 15. Cloudy, cool, S.W.
wind. Read Divine service, as usual. Sank a well, erected
troughs, and watered the camels, the natives gazing with
undisguised surprise at the quantity of water consumed by the
camels. Eleven native men had now assembled and watched our every
movement with much interest. The sick camels are doing well, but
need a few days' rest; therefore will remain here to-morrow. Max.

<p><i>Monday, July 6th.</i>&#8212;Cold night, frost; ther.
33&#176;; S.W. wind. Camp 15. Filled all the water casks. Doctor
photographing; Messrs. Streich and Helms collecting; Mr. Wells
writing out his report and plotting up the work. Mr. Leech and I
ascended a mountain, the centre of this group, and took a round
of bearings with the theodolite, top of rugged granite hill, the
highest point of which is inaccessible, being ten chains distant,
on bearing 240&#176; 40' from where we observed. Two more natives
came in, making the number 13. All the camels are well. Mr.
Streich found a little arsenical pyrites. I am still very stiff
and lame, and the daily hill climbing which is necessary for the
proper survey of the country is very trying, and much retards my
recovery. Warren served us up a very good supper of salmon,
herrings, emu egg omelette, and stewed apricots. Max. temp.
72&#176;, min. temp. 34&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 52&#176;, bar.
28.30; 3 p.m., ther. 72&#176;, bar. 28.20. I consider it likely
that good soakage wells would be obtained amongst these granite
hills. Doctor photographed the natives.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, July 7th.</i>&#8212;Clear, calm, with a N.E. wind
later; ther. 30&#176;. Camp 15. Started at 10.30 on bearing
292&#176;. At eight miles we passed a peculiar hill, a base of
granite, with conglomerate covered with quartzite and sandstone.
In the conglomerate are great waterworn quarts pebbles. Soon
after passing hill, which Mr. Streich "kodaked", he and I turned
off a little to the left to visit some broken hills of
conglomerate. In one of the gullies we found a little water. We
found the summit to be, approximately, 1,650ft. above sea level.
Quartzite, sandstone, and conglomerate. From the water the
bearing to peak at camp 14 is 90&#176;; to the observation point
of yesterday 106&#176;. The escarpment of these hills is to the
north. We camped at 6 under a granite hill at the entrance to a
broad valley in which there is very good stock bushes and good
grass, about two miles from the great bare mountain to which we
are going. The eleven natives who travelled with us this morning
left the caravan shortly after passing the peculiar hill to go to
some hills on our right, where they said there is water. Before
very long eleven new natives took their places and camped with
us, only to clear out in the night. Travelled about seventeen
miles. Poor country, spinifex, mulga, few sandhills. Bearing
292&#176; 30', seventeen miles. Camp 16. Max. temp. 72&#176;, min.
temp. 29&#189;&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 55&#176;, bar. 28.25; 3
p.m., ther. 69&#176;, bar. 28.30. Caravan distance, seventeen
miles. I rode ten miles extra.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, July 8th.</i>&#8212;Mr. Wells and I proceeded to
the mountain and climbed it; then took bearings with the
theodolite. The hill is of bare granite, with a gum tree (the
only tree) growing 125 links north of the summit. We found the
height by aneroid to be 2,380ft.&#8212;750ft. above the base. I
named it Mount Watson, in honor of Professor Archibald Watson,
M.D., of the Adelaide University, as an appreciation of his
kindness in assisting, as Sir Thomas Elder's agent, in the
formation of the party. On the north-east side, that is the side
we ascended, water was slowly trickling out of a morass. It is no
spring, only a soakage; and not a great supply at that, I am
sure. Good pines and gum trees in the gully. The appearance of
the country to the westward is very inviting&#8212;open
undulating valleys between bold rugged granite hills, with
watercourses fringed with fine umbrageous gum trees. Mr. Wells
and I were quite certain we should find water on that side, so,
after taking the bearings, we descended to the caravan, and,
passing around the eastern foot of Mount Watson, we entered a
nice valley. As the caravan travelled on we examined the gullies
and gorges in the side of Mount Watson, finding a small soakage
at the south foot. Hurrying on ahead of the caravan, soon
ascertained that the view from the summit had been delusive, as,
although there was beautiful pasture land and fine gum trees in
the creeks, no water was to be found. Returned to the caravan,
and took them back about one mile to the soakage, and camped at
2.30 in a most excellent place. Good feed. Camp 17. Six natives
rejoined us here just as we were about to camp. A fire had been
burning brightly, though intermittently, on a hill some two miles
off the whole of last night. Sank a well 5ft. deep in a small
watercourse right up at the foot of the hill, and got a fair
supply of very good water. Max. temp. 60&#176;, min. temp.
27&#176;. At 9 a.m.. ther. 48&#176;, bar. 28.32; 3 p.m., ther.
56&#176;, bar. 28.28.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, July 9th.</i>&#8212;Spelling the sick camels. Mr.
Wells preparing to go south-west. Repairing saddles. Cut the iron
bars of one, and had to punch holes in the bars to make it short
enough for Mr. Leech's camel. We had some difficulty in doing
this, having no proper tools, but with the stump of a bloodwood
tree for an anvil we managed fairly well, I being the blacksmith
with Gwynne as my chief assistant. All our riding saddles are
much too big, having been made for Beltana camels, whereas all
our riding camels came out of the jimador's mob, and, stupidly,
all the bows were riveted instead of being fixed on with bolt and
nut. Hadji says he told the Beltana blacksmith to fix them that
way, and to punch holes so that the saddles could be made smaller
if necessary. Streich and Helms out collecting; doctor
photographing. Mr. Leech made a sketch of the mountain from the
eastern side. Mr. Helms marked the gum tree on the top of Mount
Watson D. L., 8.7.91. From camp 17 Mount Watson bears 328&#176;
30' magnetic half a mile distant. Marked a tree (bloodwood)
<small>D.L./XVII/</small>9.7.91 (within diamond) on the eastern
bank of a watercourse. Latitude of camp 27&#176; 20' 12" south;
variation of needle 2&#176; 15' east of north. My compass reads on
true south line 178&#176; 40'. Mr. Wells' compass reads on true
south line 178&#176; 30'. Max. temp. 52&#176;; min. temp. 34&#176;.

<p><i>Friday, July 10th.</i>&#8212;Mr. Wells, Bob, and Mahmoud
Azim started south-west, taking eighty gallons of water and three
weeks' rations, at 10.30. We did not get away until 11.45,
steering for the big range to the north-west. Cold, cloudy, a few
drops of rain occasionally. A good supply of water in our well,
which is now 6ft. deep. At one and a half miles we stopped, and
then the caravan proceeded on bearing 305, while Mr. Streich and
I went 276&#176; to visit some hills. In one and a quarter miles
we left the west end of the hills on our left hand; at six miles
we found a double hill; in the gully on the plateau we found a
native well. The hill is of granite and diorite. We then went on
the south side of the hill, and proceeded on bearing 340&#176;.
From the top of the hill an extensive view, say forty or fifty
miles, over sandhills stretching away to the south, the horizon
being unbroken by any irregularity. At the north-north-west foot
of this bill from the top of a sand ridge, say twenty chains from
a peculiar bush on the hilltop, a hill three miles distant bears
281&#176;, a distant mount 298&#176;. We resume on bearing 342&#176;
at 3.13. At one mile passed the west end of a low granite hill;
at two and a quarter miles a hill at half a mile and one at one
mile on our right; at three miles a hill half a mile on the
right; at three and a quarter miles a hill half a mile on right;
at three and a half miles a hill a quarter of a mile on right; at
three and three-quarter miles at foot of hill; at four and a
quarter another hill. Then, on bearing 60&#176; for three-quarters
of a mile and 115&#176; for half a mile, to the camp, having
ridden thirteen and a half miles, the caravan doing ten and a
half. The country to-day has been poor, mostly spinifex, a few
sandhills, with mulga flats, and little grass. Good country close
around all the hills. Mr. Leech reports having passed a good
rockhole. Marked a bloodwood tree <small>D.L./XVIII</small> (in
diamond). Native well, very little water, two chains east of
marked tree. Mount Sir Thomas bears 318&#176;, saddle of range
314&#176;, the dome 7&#176;. Max. temp. 60&#176;, min. temp.
38&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 49&#176;. bar. 28.33; 3 p.m., ther.
60&#176;, bar. 28.30. Natives (five) still continuing with us.
Bearing 340&#176; for one and a half miles, 305&#176; for nine
miles (caravan); bearing 340&#176; for one and a half miles,
276&#176; for six and a half miles, 342&#176; for four and a half
miles, 6&#176; for three-quarters of a mile, 115&#176; for half a
mile to camp 18; total distance, twenty-three and a quarter miles
(caravan, ten and a half miles; self, thirteen and three quarter
miles). Camp 18 is 1,850ft. above sea level.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, July 11th.</i>&#8212;Resumed our journey at 10.10
on bearing 318&#176;. Warm; few clouds. In half a mile we passed a
hill one mile distant on our right; at four and a half miles a
hill close on our right; at five miles crossed a saddle; at five
and a half miles camped on a good water in a watercourse leading
out of a low broken range on the eastern side of a fine valley.
Country passed over to-day level, mostly spinifex, but mulga and
good grass near the hills. Numerous old native camps. The natives
led us to this water. They made us understand that there were
some emus at the water, so two went up one gully and a native and
I up another; unfortunately the emus saw us before we saw them
and made over the hills. I had two shots at them as they ran, but
missed. Obtained a few more words from them&#8212;Wollaberra
(woman), kapi kairu (water in creek), bulga kapi (plenty water),
kapi euro (rockhole). At 3.12 Messrs. Leech, Streich, Helms, Dr.
Elliot and I set off for Mount Sir Thomas. A ride of one and
three-quarter miles took us to the foot of a rugged much broken
mountain of granite sparsely clothed with spinifex and a few
bushes. Tied our camels down, and commenced a most laborious
ascent. Found the summit to be 2,535ft. above sea level, and
900ft. above the plain. It was 4.30 when we reached the top. A
magnificent view was obtained; scattered groups of hills from
west around north to east. To the south nothing but sandhills,
the horizon being level and as unbroken as the sea. With the
theodolite I took a round of magnetic bearings. Hastily built a
small pile and hurried down the hill, the sun having set before
we reached the camels, and quite dark when we reached the camp.
Very nice country in this valley, and surrounding the
range&#8212;the best we have seen for some time. I have called
this range, the most important natural feature discovered, the
Birksgate Range, after Sir Thomas Elder's residence at Glen
Osmond, and the mountain Mount Sir Thomas, in honor of Sir Thomas
Elder, the generous originator of this expedition. Max. temp.
69&#176;; min. temp. 40&#176;. At 9 a.m. ther. 54&#176;, bar. 28.26;
3 p.m., ther. 69&#176;, bar. 28.10; 6 p.m., ther. 57&#176;, bar.
27.32. Camp 19; distance travelled, eight miles; 1,855ft. above
see level.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, July 12th.</i>&#8212;Heavy dew and frost last
night. Ice on the water; warm day. Doctor photographing. Helms
and Streich collecting. Planted wheat, barley, oats, lucerne,
giant grass, clover, pumpkins, melons, sorghum, maize, cherries,
apricots, peaches, dates, acacias, and gums. Very fine specimen
of the pituri (native tobacco) growing amongst these granite
boulders; doctor photographed one specimen, and we gathered some
seeds. The natives take the green leaf and lay it on some of the
fine white ash dust until much of the moisture is drawn off; they
then roll it up with some of the ash attached and it is chewed
and passed from man to man. It is often carried long distances. I
have often been offered a quid of this taken from behind a
black-fellow's ear, or out of a carefully wrapped up parcel. Max.
temp. 71&#176;, min. temp. 29&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 54&#176;, bar.
28.19; 3 p.m., ther. 70&#176;, bar. 28.13.</p>
<p><i>Monday, July 13th.</i>&#8212;Cold, clear, heavy frost. Camp
19. While the caravan went around the south side of the Birksgate
Range, in charge of Mr. Leech, I and Dr. Elliot went through the
range and around the north end of it. I started at 9.7 a.m., on
bearing 350&#176;; in half a mile struck the creek and followed it
for five chains, when we altered the course to 30&#176;, in
one-eighth of a mile the creek left our course and went around a
hill; one-quarter of a mile we crossed a saddle into another
watercourse, then at three-quarters of a mile changed to 8&#176;,
and in one-quarter of a mile came to a native well in the creek
bed. The appearance of the trees, &amp;c., lead me to think that
this is a permanent soakage, though the supply would probably be
small. The gorge is narrow. This spot has evidently been selected
by the natives for the performance of some of their rites.
Numerous small heaps of stones at irregular distances, and on the
face of a broken granite boulder parallel vertical lines were
drawn. The doctor photographed this. A considerable delay was
caused. The rocks are granite with some limestone. Three-quarters
of a mile farther we were blocked and had to lead our camels to
one and quarter miles, when a fine view of the mountain was
obtained, and which the doctor photographed. We were on the
E.N.E. side. In one and three-quarter miles we got over a saddle
and on to the level country beyond. It being now 11.30 it was too
late to go to the Dome, so we rode around the north end of the
range down the west side to a by-creek which comes from the mount
and then across the valley westward and around the north and west
sides of a group of large hills into camp 20. Very good country
surrounding these hills&#8212;grass, geranium, acacias, mulga. I
think there is some water up the western creek of the range, but
it was too rough to ride up. The natives left us, saying there is
no water in the hills to the west. Distance

<p><i>Tuesday, July 14th.</i>&#8212;Camp 20. Very cold, clear
frost, S.W. wind. We followed up the gully for ten chains and
crossed over a saddle into a valley; then went 335&#176; for half
a mile, when the caravan proceeded on bearing 288&#176; for a
distant hill, while I went 350&#176; to look for water, the
natives having told us there was kapi kairo in the hills, about
three miles distant. My course led me over good mulga country
with plenty of parakylia, the first I have seen since leaving the
Everard Ranges. At three miles I entered a valley about twenty
chains wide, high bare granite hills on both sides. At three and
three-quarter miles crossed to west side of valley and found a
fair sized gum creek. I left my camel and clambered over the
boulders for some distance, finding a very small soakage up near
the head of the creek which has some fine large gum trees. At
four and a quarter miles native camps (old). An isolated hill
bears 70&#176;, two miles distant 30&#176;, one at a mile and
north, one is one and a half miles distant. I then went on
bearing 267&#176;, leaving the hills on my left. At three and a
quarter miles struck some fresh tracks of native men, women, and
children, going north to a big hill one mile distant. I followed
the tracks, hoping to find some water. Saw where the natives had
camped last night, and then followed their tracks to the north
side of the hill, where I found a very small rockhole, almost
empty. I then resumed my journey, and at one and a quarter miles
passed a group of hills on my left; at four and three-quarter
miles another group of hills one and a half miles on the left;
parallel sandhills ten to thirty chains apart; spinifex, mulga,
and grass. At five and a half miles changed my course to 238&#176;
for a big hill, and cut the tracks of the caravan. Followed them
into camp 21; reached it at 5.30, having ridden twenty-two miles,
the caravan doing fourteen miles. My extra ride of fourteen miles
was, as far as water is concerned, fruitless, as I found none
worth speaking about. Mr. Leech reports having seen a fine
rockhole and some natives. The bulk of the country passed over
to-day is poor; spinifex, an occasional sandhill. The camp (21)
is on the south side of a fine big hill, which is worthy of a
name. Mulga, roley poley. Mr. Helms climbed to the top of the
hill, which is of granite, as are all the hills seen to-day. Nine
natives joined the caravan, and stayed all night, some more
coining in with a rush and a yell just after dark. From them I
ascertained that "kupa" meant camp; "kapi kairo", creek water;
"kapi euro", rock water;"kapi ila", native well; "kapi bulka",
plenty water. The caravan passed a rockhole at a bare granite
mound near a big granite hill. Very cold; clouds in the
south-west. Max. temp. 69&#176;, min. temp. 29&#176;; at 9 a.m.,

<p><i>Wednesday, July 15th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 25&#176;; frost,
clear. Camp 21. We now have thirteen natives with us. Leech and I
went on ahead to a mountain (which I have called temporarily
"Mount Sawback" (Pernamo Hill), owing to the serrated appearance
as seen from the east) to take a round of bearings. In six and a
half miles we were at the east end of the mount, and found it to
be of granite with a diorite dyke running the whole length
through it, the five peaks being of diorite. The country passed
over was poor spinifex sandhills. Aneroid at foot reading
1,710ft., at top 2,320ft. We had a very stiff and rough climb, as
we had to go about one mile along to get to the highest point.
Climbing for me was rather unpleasant, as both my back and left
leg are very weak still. The needle was affected considerably by
this diorite. The bearings are magnetic, and taken with the
theodolite. It was 1.30 p.m. when we reached the foot of the
hill, and found the caravan waiting. The natives had all come
along and shown Alumgool a fine waterhole in a rock basin up on
the side of the hill. The hole was of considerable extent and
full of earth. The natives had excavated a big hole, which was
full of beautiful clear water. There being very good feed here we
turned out. Filled up the watercasks, watered the camels, built a
small pile of stones around a high post to show the position of
the water, as it would easily be passed. I rode eight miles
around the hills, but saw no more water. A very small extent of
good country at this mountain. On the very summit of the hill
right under My theodolite I found a mark ^ in the solid diorite.
At the first glance it appeared as if some one had chiselled a
broad arrow, but on closer examination I found three similar
marks about 2ft. apart, as if an emu had walked over and wherever
he had placed his foot the black surface of the stone had
weathered and left a reddish stain. The rocks were all broken,
and the marks were just where an emu would have placed his feet
had he been crossing here. The marks were like this
<b>&lt;&#8211;&nbsp;&lt;&#8211;&nbsp;&lt;&#8211;&nbsp;&lt;&#8211;</b> all of the
same size. A little further back a mark <b>&#920;</b> was found,
and another similar <b>O</b>. It is evident they were all made by
the natives. The natives all went away and returned again before
dark. They say there is water at the next hills, and that they
are going on with us. The doctor photographed them on the bare
face of the rock. Marked a bloodwood tree
<small>D.L./XXII</small>. (within diamond), from which the water
bears 152&#176; distant about ten chains. Sketched outline of the
hill to which we shall go to-morrow. From the waterhole hill at
camp 21 bears 90&#176;, Mount Sir Thomas 107&#176;. Mr. Helms lost
his watch, and thinks it fell into the water when he was getting
a drink. S.E. wind, few clouds. Max. temp. 70&#176;; min. temp.

<p><i>Thursday, July 16th.</i>&#8212;Temp. 32&#176;. Cold; frost.
Camp 22. The natives remained at the water. Started at 10 with
all our water casks full, on bearing 295&#176;. In one and a half
miles went on bearing 301&#176; for a hill this side of the gap.
Travelled. over irregular sandhills, spinifex, mulga, and
acacias. Good herbs and grass in places, but mostly poor. Camp at
5.30, having made about twenty and a half miles, at foot of a
granite hill 1,750ft. (200ft. above the plain.) From the top of
this hill I could see water on a flat rock to the westward. The
hill rises out of a hard clay soil, on which is growing mulga and
roley poley. Mr. Helms obtained two eggs of an eaglehawk, which
when made into an omelette were really very good. Southerly wind
wind, cloudy, cool. My leg still very weak. Max. temp. 68&#176;,
min. temp. 32&#176;. At 9 a.m. ther. 51&#176;, bar. 28.26; 3 p.m.,
ther. 62&#176;, bar. 28.39. The country extremely dry. Few acacias
and quondongs; saw a new tree.</p>
<p><i>Friday, July 17th.</i>&#8212;Camp 23. Started at 8.35. At
8.50 found a rockhole 10ft. deep. The top of the granite hill,
distant thirty chains, bearing 120&#176;; a bare granite outcrop
five chains to the south. Replenished. our water supply. At two
miles a hill half a mile on the right.. At three and a quarter
miles granite hills close on our right. At eight miles reached
the foot of the hill, aneroid reading 1,340ft. Gwynne and I, who
had conic on ahead, climbed the mountain, which is principally of
broken diorite, ringing like a bell to the touch of our ironshod
boots. On top the aneroid read 1,900ft. The bluff point (south)
is twenty chains from the highest point, and bears 117&#176; 24' A
round of bearings were taken with the theodolite. The needle
would be considerably affected by the diorite. From 330&#176; to
35&#176; seems one range with very high mountains, distant thirty
or forty miles, the Tomkinson Ranges. When descending, Gwynne
slipped and fell amongst the rocks. I was afraid the theodolite
was ruined, but fortunately the only damage done was the breakage
of one of the levels on the parallel plate. From end of hill,
three-quarters of a mile distant, the top bears 30&#176;, and we
go 325&#176; at 2.3 p.m. The diorite on these hills is very much
broken up and is stained like iron slag. In two and a half miles
we had a big hill on our left, and while Mr. Leech led the
caravan to a hill pointed out I went south to visit the bare
rocks where I thought it likely some rockholes might be found. I
rode between isolated granite hills, over sandy country, poor,
dry, spinifex, mulga, some dry grass, a few patches of roley
poley, but no feed to camp on with our mob of camels. Found a
small rockhole, from which Mount Gosse bears 63&#176; distant four
miles; hill at camp 24 bears 356&#176;; camp 23 bears 104&#176;;
Pernamo Hill 114&#176;; close by was a good rockhole, 36ft. x
10ft. x 5ft., water now 3ft. at deepest part, situated on east
end of long low bare granite outcrop. Another rockhole 15ft. x
8ft. x 3ft., Mount Gosse, bearing 83&#176;, Pernamo Hill,
164&#176;. Then another, the hill at camp 24, bearing 38&#176;,
Mount Gosse 90&#176;, this hole being 20ft. x 3ft. x 9ft.; only
6ft. of water at deepest part now. Numerous hare granite outcrops
amongst sandhills; poor feed. Altogether there is not much water,
and what there is is dirty and old. Not a suitable place for a
dep&#244;t camp, all the bushes. and feed being so dry, no rain
having fallen for a very long time. It seems almost as if the
splendid rains. which had fallen in South Australia during the
past two months had stopped short at the boundary of Western
Australia, where we now are. I saw some fresh native tracks going
westward, and Mr. Leech saw big smokes. bearing 308&#176;, say
twenty miles distant, this leading me to believe that we will
find good waters amongst the hills we can see ahead; wire-wing
pigeons (crested doves) numerous. The caravan travelled fourteen,
miles, I twenty-six miles. The camp 24 was on a plain at the
north, foot of a big granite hill. Very poor feed. Max. temp.
71&#176;, min. 26&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.65, ther. 50&#176;; 3
p.m., bar. 28.49, ther. 65&#176;. Distance. eighteen and twelve
miles=thirty miles.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, July 18th.</i>&#8212;Camp 24. Ther. 33&#176;. S.E.
wind. Gwynne and I started in advance of the caravan, Mr. Leech
having instructions to travel to a hill distant about ten miles.
One mile from the camp we found a rockhole 153&#176; to Mount
Gosse, 184&#176; to hill. At camp 24, one and a half miles
distant, 319&#176; to an isolated hill, about eight miles. At two
and a half miles we entered mulga.&#8212;chalcedony; one mile
further into the sand and spinifex again. At the foot of the
bill, eight miles, the aneroid read 1,240ft.; at the top it read
1,620ft. Took a round of magnetic bearings with the theodolite.
Built a pile of stones and put up a pine post 15ft. high. At 2
p.m. we (the caravan having come up) started around the north end
of the hill, and in one and a half miles the caravan went,
bearing 323", for another hill, while I went off to where I saw
the smoke (340&#176; 30'), hoping to find water. It is necessary
to find water, for Mr. Wells is due to-morrow, and if he is late
we must wait for him. He was to come on to the south-west end of
the Blyth Ranges, which are shown on the map as crossing the
boundary line and being continuous for between twenty and thirty
miles, whereas we have crossed the boundary and hive seen no
range of hills. The only range with a south-westerly trend is
that ahead, and it is too much out of position to be Blyth
Ranges. Yet Mr. Gosse must have seen a range, unless it was a
mirage; but then his experience was too great to allow him to
make a. mistake like that. We must go on to the range ahead, as
there is our only chance of finding water and feed. The whole
country presents a very drought-stricken appearance, and the
camels are doing badly for want of feed. After travelling over
poor country&#8212;sandhills with a few granite outcrops, mulga
in patches, spinifex, a few good camel bushes&#8212;I reached the
hills at 5.20, the distance being fifteen miles instead of ten
miles. I passed through the smoke and found an unfinished trap
(bush), but saw no natives. Made a hurried search, but saw no
signs of water. Native tracks all about, but could find no pad or
number of tracks going in one direction. I did not care about
stopping here alone all night, so as the sun went down I steered
off for where the camp should be, and after about nine miles over
high sandhills, with spinifex, I rode straight into camp, a fire
having been lit on a sandhill, and which I saw when I was about
two miles distant, straight ahead of me. I rode thirty-one miles,
and the caravan sixteen miles. Mr. Leech had camped on most
wretched feed, and the poor camels had a poor night of it. I am
sorry to say Mr. Leech does not show much judgment about
selecting a good camp. Max. temp. 67&#176;, min. temp. 33&#176;; at
9 a.m., ther. 54&#176;, bar. 28.71; 3 p.m., ther. 67&#176;, bar.
28.69. Camp 25. Total distance, forty-seven miles.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, July 19th.</i>&#8212;Camp 25. Ther. 24&#176;. Bones,
one of the camels, looking very sick, as if partaken of poison;
gave him four packets of salts. Owing to the lack of feed the
camels had made back a long way. and it was 9.26 before we were
able to start, on same bearing (323&#176;) up a spinifex valley
between sandhills; very poor country, unfit for anything. In
eight and a quarter miles reached this hill, which is of granite
and. isolated. Aneroid at foot 1,440ft., on top 1,700ft. The hill
looked much higher, and we must have been, ascending all the way.
Took the following compass bearings:&#8212;297&#176; to the south
hill of a range and to which we are going, 80&#176; to hills where
I was last night, 142&#176; to pile of yesterday. On the
north-west side of the hill a granite outcrop with a few pines on
it&#8212;a very likely looking place for a rockhole. Doctor and
I, who, were ahead, rode around, and found a nice hole. Two crows
came to meet us, and flew straight to the hole and perched
themselves on a dry pine tree. We returned to the hill, and sent
up a smoke to guide the caravan in, so as to instruct them to
fill up the water casks at the hole. My smoke was answered by
some natives not many miles to the westward, and also by some
twenty or thirty miles west. I took this for a good sign of
water, as none had been in at this rockhole recently. Dr. Elliot
and I rode on bearing 276&#176; for the smoke, Mr. Leech leading
the caravan on bearing 297&#176; to the hill. In two miles, having
just crossed a spinifex sandhill, we came right on a black woman,
who did not notice our approach and was much alarmed when she saw
probably the first white men she had ever seen and the "devil
devil", as the camel is generally supposed to be by the natives.
She was loaded up with the fruits of the chase and edible roots
and seeds. When she saw us she immediately pushed her treasures
under a bush, and with the firestick which she carried ran from
bush to bush, sending up a big smoke and calling out at the top
of her voice. Presently she hid herself in a bush. I dismounted,
the doctor remaining on his camel on the the hilltop on the
lookout for the other natives, who would be attracted by the
smoke and cries; and when I reached out my hand to touch her she
jumped out, seized a big stick, and beat on the ground and
bushes, all the while facing me and making most discordant yells
and cries. I stood off some little distance, and tried to soothe
her by holding out a handkerchief and repeating all the native
words I could remember; I managed to get close enough to give her
the handkerchief. Presently the doctor reported "Natives coming!"
and an old white-haired fellow advanced slowly and fearfully
towards us. After some amount of coaxing the old fellow let me
approach him, the woman taking the opportunity to slip off
amongst the bushes. The man was just as terrified. He took from a
bag a piece of pituri, and offered it to me; I suppose that was
the most valuable thing he had, and it is perhaps considered "the
pipe of peace." Dr. Elliot gave him some tobacco and a bun in
exchange for some seeds of the kurrajong, of which the old woman
had a considerable quantity in a wooden vessel, and pieces of a
large yarn. The old fellow would say but little, but made comical
and suggestive gestures. After some time he pointed to the hills
to which we are going, and said "kapi euro"; sweeping his hand
around west and south he said "kapi nurtha" (no water). We soon
overcame his fears, and he travelled a mile or so with us, and
would have come right on had we insisted. Our course was now
322&#176;, over wretched country&#8212;"seas of spinifex." In nine
(9) miles we found ourselves in dense mulga, good clayey soil,
and camped. The mulga being as dry as sticks, and no sign of feed
anywhere, we tied the camels down all night. Most wretched
looking country; the bushes all look dying, and the spinifex is
dead. I am sure no rain has fallen here for two or three years.
It is to be hoped that we will soon get out of this
drought-stricken region, or the camels Will have a hard time.
Over at the range we should get some gum creeks and better feed.
We made nineteen and a half miles; the caravan camped on no feed
again, at fourteen miles&#8212;thirty-four miles. Max. temp.

<p><i>Monday, July 20th.</i>&#8212;Started at 8 a.m., and
travelled over most miserable country&#8212;level, hard sandy
soil, with dying spinifex and a few brown, half-dead quondongs.
Seven miles took us to the hill; aneroid at foot reading
1,570ft., on top 2,150ft., making height 580ft. A few edible
bushes, on which the doctor let the camels feed while I ascended
the hill to take bearings with the compass, as
follows:&#8212;260&#176;, low group of hills, about fifteen miles;
275&#176;, big hill in group. twenty-five miles (Borrow's Hill);
287&#176;, south end of range, thirty-five miles; 295&#176;, north
end of same range; 308&#176;, a distant hill; 315&#176;, west end
of a range; 318&#176;, hill in same range, thirty-five miles;
333&#176;, hill in group; 13&#176;, mount in range, twenty-five
miles; 52&#176;, Mount Hinkley(?); 67&#176;, a mountain; 100&#176;,
hills fifteen miles; 108&#176;, Mount Moulden; 124&#176;, diorite
group. As Mr. Wells is due on our track to-day, I set fire to the
spinifex from the top all the way down. In a watercourse I found
a rockhole containing about 100galls. or 150galls. of water. The
hill is composed of a porphyritic rock, very much broken. Found
some feed on a gum creek about one mile distant, and signalled
for the caravan, which was just in sight; they turned to us, and
we pitched camp amongst some shady large gum trees. A fair amount
of edible bushes, but very dry. The creek bed is dry, sandy, with
bars of rock showing up occasionally. I think it probable that
water would be obtained at, say, 50ft. or 60ft. in this basin. I
observed for latitude, and found it to be 26&#176; 23' 51" 45"'.
Camp 27. Distance for caravan ten miles 17 miles. Max. temp.

find that we are at Skirmish Hill of Mount Gosse, an outlier of
the Tomkinson Range. The camp is 1,535ft. above sea level.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, July 21st.</i>&#8212;I and Mr. Leech went in
different directions looking for water and feed, but were both
unsuccessful. On returning down this creek I found Mr. Gosse's
old camp. Bullock bones, &amp;c., and a tree marked
<small>GOS/13/F76</small> (within square), and on the reverse
side <small>W.W.M</small>/46 (within square), showing that Gosse,
Forrest, and Mills had all been here. Our camp was one mile
farther down the creek. Tarred some of the camels for mange. Gave
Misery three pints of fat, sugar, and flour. Sent up some good
signal smokes for Wells. Camp 27, on Moses' Creek; height
1,355ft. above sea level. Max. temp. 70&#176;, min. temp. 29&#176;.
At 9 p.m., bar. 28.440, ther. 57&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.360, ther.

<p><i>Wednesday, July 22nd.</i>&#8212;The camels were scattered
all over the country. Some of the bulls coming in season had
driven the bullocks straight away. It was 11.30 before the
Afghans returned with them one short, which was not found till
sundown. The poor brutes are thirsty, and have had very poor feed
for the Past week. Took stock of stores, and found we had a full
three mouths' supply of everything; the meat would easily last
four months. Went up and marked Gosse's tree
<small>D.L./XXVII./</small>21.7./91. (within diamond), and the
doctor photographed it. Mr. Wells returned at sundown with a
favorable report on the country. One or two good rockholes and
some natives. Mr. Wells saw many fresh tracks of natives on our
pad. He had struck in on the east side of Mount Gosse, and
followed our pad. Max. temp. 71&#176;, min. temp. 26&#176;. At 9
a.m., ther. 55&#176;, bar. 28.45; 3 p.m., ther. 71&#176;, bar.
28.40.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, July 23rd.</i>&#8212;The camels having been tied
down all night an early start was made back for the last
rockhole, Gwynne and all the Afghans except Mahmoud Azim going,
their instructions being to fill all the empty water casks and
then give the camels a drink, Mr. Leech having given it as his
opinion that there was sufficient water there. They are to return
to-morrow. Mr. Wells busy writing me a report of his flying trip.
Adjusted the loading. Soled my boots with green hide. In the
evening Mr. Wells and I ascended Skirmish Hill and I took with
the theodolite a round of magnetic bearings. The group of hills
which Mr. Gosse named the Blyth Range are clearly discernible,
but do not present the appearance of a continuous. range as shown
on his plan. The position assigned to the range is fairly
correct, but as the group cannot in any sense be called a range I
have taken the liberty of altering the name to the Blyth Hills,
and calling the principal hill Mount Agnes. Having obtained
bearings to four trigonometrical stations we shall have again an
absolutely correct starting point. As we have to examine a
portion of block B near here I shall go west and establish a
dep&#244;t at Fort Mueller, or Barlee Springs, from which to
detach light parties north and south again. Another advantage of
visiting these waters will be that I shall have a means of
judging whether any reliance can be placed on the waters on
Forrest's track. So far the only waters are rockholes, and we
have not seen a place where we could stop for two months if it
were necessary. Our caravan is much too large for this country in
a season like this. Max. temp. 68&#176;, min. temp. 25&#176;. At 9

<p><i>Friday, July 24th.</i>&#8212;The camels returned in the
evening with the casks full, but there were only eight buckets
left for the camels. Gwynne said that the Afghans used two
buckets of water to wash their clothes, thus depriving the
animals of that much. Hadji lost his temper when I asked him if
he did so. Said nothing to me, but they all got excited and had a
big talk amongst themselves. They told me they used about
three-quarters of a bucket to have a wash in. These men are
frequently rowing between themselves, and all seem to hate Hadji.
Working at loading and plans. Made a road by shifting rocks to
enable the camels to get to the water. Cold south wind. Gwynne
reported having seen some natives at the rockhole. Max. temp.

var. 2.22 E.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, July 25th.</i>&#8212;Sent all the camels to the
rockhole, which only yielded 3galls. each. It was a slow job
watering them, as the water had to be carried some distance over
smooth rocks. They returned to camp at 11.20, when we at once
loaded up and started at 12.20 up Moses' Creek, 286&#176; for
three miles from the marked tree, and 310&#176; for six miles over
sandhills and along sandy spinifex and mulga plains. The country
is better than east of Skirmish Hill, more bushes, though
terribly dry. We camped at 5.30 at foot of low granite outcrops
with sandhills intervening; quartz reels. I found a rockhole with
but little water in it. Fair feed, some waterbush. I brought in
about 300lbs. weight of it from some rocks two miles away. Cool
day, south wind. Camp 28. Lat. 26&#176; 18' 50". Distance, twelve

<p><i>Sunday, July 26th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 28&#176;, cold, calm.
Camp 28. The camels had scattered, and it was 10.30 before all
were brought in. We had been cleaning out the rockhole and
draining the water into canvas troughs. After going down left,
and removing a great deal of mullock, we were rewarded by getting

five camels, two pair water casks (160galls.) and rations for
three weeks. Bearing from Mount Watson 210&#176;, at three miles
entered continuous ridges of red sand, generally hearing from
290&#176; to 300&#176; mag. Clothed with open acacia (wattle bush),
low ti-tree, and other bushes and triodia, from twenty to forty
chains apart. Flats of scattered mulga, acacia. mallee, and few
bushes covered with triodia. Very little grass. Few mulga belts,
few bloodwoods. At fifteen miles crossed high point, 1,425ft.

<p>"July 11th.&#8212;Let camels go at 6 a.m. Breakfast. Made
start at 7.30 a.m. Travelled over country similar to yesterday.
At three miles passed numerous outcrops of limestone and flint.
Saw tracks of natives, about two months old. At seven miles
crossed a low flat 1,175ft. above sea level. Large casuarinas
here. At nine miles the sand ridges were much lower. Flats of red
loam and ferruginous gravel, belts of mulga and grass. Desert
gums, mallee, triodia, acacia, ti-tree, and other bushes, as
yesterday. Camped at noon to feed camels and lunch. Distance
travelled, about twelve miles. left again at 1 p.m. At thirteen
and half miles limestone rise, with large casuarinas and
broombushes. At fifteen miles ironstone outcrop (selected
specimen for the geologist). At seventeen miles noticed where
natives had been recently digging for grubs. Also (long) rise of
sandstone and ironstone formation, with dense casuarinas, mulga,
and bushes. Reached the highest point at 4 p.m.&#8212;1,650ft.
above sea level. Numerous desert gums, few acacias and currant
bushes, few poplars, dense triodia; no grass. Camped at this
point, on flat between ridges. Travelled nineteen miles. Aneroid
at 4.5 p.m., 21.610 [<i>sic</i>]; ther., 67&#176;. Moderate breeze
from south-west; warm, clear sky. Country similar as far as eye
can reach. Higher sand ridges to the south-east and east. Took
check bearing to Mount Watson and camp 17&#8212;30&#176; mag.;
made sketch from here. Noticed evidences of natives having been
in the locality not long since. Observed for latitude 27&#176; 47'

<p>"July 12th.&#8212;Let the camels go at 5 a.m. Breakfast. Made
start at 7.25 a.m. on same bearing, passing over open red sand
ridges (continuous). Numerous desert gums in flats and on ridges,
some being 3ft. in diameter. Scattered kurrajong, acacia,
quondong, and abundance of triodia everywhere. At three miles
noticed track of a native not more than a week since. At eight
miles reached lowest point&#8212;1,150ft. above sea level. Saw
pines here; also scattered mallee and low ti-tree. Sand ridges
and hills become steeper from here, and very jumbled and broken.
All miserable country this morning. Camped for lunch at 12.30
p.m. At fifteen miles sandstone outcrop in gully similar to that
passed over during morning, except belts of mulga and little
grass. Reached highest point at 3.50 p.m.&#8212;1,625ft. above
sea level (eighteen miles). Saw several fresh tracks of natives
(to-day's). Camped at 4 p.m., on flat under top of ridge. Bar.,
28.325; ther. 65&#176;. Moderate breeze from south-west; very few
light clouds. Travelled about eighteen miles to-day. Have seen no
kurrajongs since noon to-day. Noticed several parrots, crows, two
cockatoos (white), black magpies, minahs, kangaroo and other
rats; also old tracks of emu and kangaroo. From this point could
see for great distance, say, twenty miles west, and forty miles
east, south-east, and south. All apparently of same class, but
lower towards the south. Tied camels down at 7 p.m. Observed for
latitude 28&#176; 1' 58".</p>
<p>"June 13th.&#8212;Let camels go at 5 a.m. Breakfast. Left camp
at 7 a.m. and returned, accompanied by Ramsay, leaving the Afghan
in camp, to where we saw the fresh native tracks. Followed them
in a south? easterly direction for about two miles and came upon
the recent camp of at least a dozen natives. They could not have
left more than a day ago, green boughs being plentiful. Saw
numbers of old camping places. Examined the vicinity, and found
at the south side of a low sand ridge a sandstone outcrop, with a
rockhole, which was half full of water; would hold 200galls. when
full. Watered our riding camels with waterproof sheeting and
quart pots (4galls. each). Made traverse to fix the position.
Returned to camp at 9.45 a.m. Aneroid 28.375, ther. 60&#176;;
slight S.W.. breeze, clear sky; frost last night. Gave the pack
camels 3galls. of water apiece from our kegs. Made start at 10.15
a.m. on same course (210&#176;), passing over miserable jumble of
red sand ridges. Saw a few sandstone outcrops, desert gums,
acacias, mallee, pines, mulga, triodia. At five miles camped for
lunch; 12.30 p.m. Saw a few tracks of natives just after leaving
camp. Crossed low flat, 1,275ft., at six miles; at seven miles,
high point, 1,375ft. Saw smokes from here bearing 224&#176; long
distance, and 226&#176;, about twelve miles. Passed over miserable
jumble of ridges the whole afternoon. Red sandhills, open
scattered desert gums, acacia, mulga scrub, low ti-tree, few
quondong, dense triodia, destitute of grass. Had difficulty in
getting camels along to-day. Camped at 4 p.m., having travelled
about eleven miles on course to-day. Barometer at 4 p.m., 28.700,
ther. 65&#176;; 1,220ft. above sea level; S.W. breeze, sky half
covered with heavy clouds. Tied camels down at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>"July 14th.&#8212;Few light showers fell last night. Let
camels go at 4.20 a.m. Breakfast. Made start at 7.30 a.m. on same
course, passing over same class of country as yesterday. At three
miles passed old wurleys on rise, and immediately afterwards came
upon basin in sandhills, with a splendid rockhole at south side
of sandhill. Open portion 4ft. in diameter, and extends under the
sandstone rock for a great way. I pushed a stick under for 10ft.
and could not find the other end. Watered all the camels, and as
there was good feed here let them pick for an hour instead of
staying for lunch. Aneroid here at 9 a.m., 28.825, ther. 56&#176;;
1,100ft. above sea level. Calm, and fog just clearing off. A few
mulga and currant bushes near the rockhole. Left here at 9.50
a.m. At half a mile came upon a temporary camp of natives and saw
their hunting implements there and a fire burning. They had
evidently gone out hunting. At one mile surprised a young lubra,
who ran away. I called to her, but she would not stay. At a mile
and a half came upon another temporary camp, where we surprised
an old lubra who was cooking opossum. She cried out and ran away,
with a wooden dish Upon her head, setting up a most pitiful wail,
which she kept up for some time. The ether lubra answered her
several times. We touched nothing in either camp, and kept on our
bearing. At three miles passed a low flat 1,000ft. above sea
level. At five miles a high point 1,275ft. above sea level. At
six miles top of ridge, 1,250ft. above sea level. At twelve miles
camped on south-east side of sand ridge at 3 p.m., the camels
being very tired and sulky. Travelled about sixteen miles to-day.
Can see from here for a great distance to the west and
south-west, say thirty or forty miles; all apparently sand
ridges. High ridge at three miles on bearing 210&#176;, 1,350ft.
above sea level. Can see for about fifteen miles on this bearing;
all similar country. Country passed over to-day similar to
yesterday, all of a wretched nature&#8212;jumble of sandhills,
and very uneven for travelling, dense triodia, open desert gums,
mallee, acacia, quondong, mulga, casuarina, low ti-tree and other
bushes; very little grass. Barometer at camp at 3 p.m. 28.685,
ther. 60&#176;. Slight southerly breeze, sky half clouded, and few
drops rain. Marked a desert gum on south-east side of sand ridge
<small>E.E.E./L.A.W.,/</small>14.7.91. within diamond. Observed
for latitude 28&#176; 22' 12". Tied camels down at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>"July 15th.&#8212;Heavy dew and frost last night. Let camels
go at 5.30 a.m. Very little feed. Made start bearing 350&#176;
mag. at 7.15 a.m. At eight miles low point 900ft. above sea
level, and sandstone outcrops here. At eleven miles camped on
ridge for lunch, as there was some herbage (waterbush) for the
camels. Noticed several tracks of natives which had been made
just before the last showers. Left at 12.30 p.m., and at sixteen
miles passed an outcrop, and several others further on, of
ironstone, and a quartzite(?); took specimens for the geologist.
Travelled over similar country all day to that of yesterday,
except little more mulga in gullies and dry grass. Camped after
gradually rising all day at 4 p.m., after travelling nineteen
miles. Aneroid at camp at 4 p.m. 28.625, therm. 62&#176;. Calm.
Sky half clouded with rain clouds. At midday camp I could see for
a great distance to the south, say, for thirty miles. Saw several
native tracks, but those of before the last showers, one fresh
emu pad, parrots, kangaroo rats, and other kinds. Tied camels
down at 6.30 p.m.</p>
<p>"July 16th.&#8212;Slight dew last night. Let camels go at 4
a.m. Made start at 7.30 a.m. At one mile reached highest point,
1,350ft. above sea level. At five miles a gully, 1,080ft. At six
and a half miles top 1,275ft. above sea level. At seven miles
came upon a gully among sand ridges with few mulga and currant
bushes, very few saltbush, and fair herbage, few quondong, acacia
bushes, and mulga on sand ridges. There splendid rockhole here in
sandstone outcrop, 6ft. diameter, exposed, and 3ft. deep; extends
under rock for 8ft., full of good water. Watered all the camels
here, and let them feed on herbage for an hour. Got away again at
11.45. At eight miles low gully 1,125ft., and at nine miles top
1,255ft. At ten miles surprised to see distinct track of a
bullock (made not more than three months since) apparently after
rain, and going in a south-easterly direction. Smoke north-east
from here, and about three miles off. At thirteen miles highest
point 1,300ft. above sea level. Camped at foot of same at 4.30
p.m. Aneroid at camp 28.660, ther. 64&#176;. Slight south-west
breeze; few light clouds. Passed over miserable country all day.
similar to that of past two days except mulga is now getting much
denser in flats of red loam, with ferruginous gravel and a few
out&#173;crops of ironstone. Noticed many tracks of natives
to-day, also several fresh emu tracks. No feed for camels here
except mulga; tied them down at 6 p.m. Observed for latitude and
found same agree exactly with traverse, 27&#176; 50' 3".</p>
<p>"July 17th.&#8212;Let camels go at 4 a.m. Made start on same
bearing at 7.30 a.m. Passed over loamy flat and ferruginous
gravel for first three miles; saw a little saltbush in this flat,
and a place where natives had once camped (old). At six miles top
of ridge 1,000ft. above sea level. Saw small claypans (dry) with
saltbush around. Same at half mile to north-west and north, with
outcrops of sandstone. Many old wurleys here recently deserted,
and fresh tracks of natives. At thirteen miles camped for lunch
on small patch of acacia and currant bushes. Saw more tracks of
natives here. Country this morning of low broken ridges of sand,
clothed with dense spinifex and low ti-tree scrub, few mulga and
desert gums, quondong, and very little acacia; occasional belts
of dense mulga on loamy flats, and little poor grass. Passed over
a great deal of burnt country this morning, apparently done last
summer. Made start again at 1.25 p m., and at the mile ascended
high point 1,000ft. above sea level. Belt of mulga and saltbush,
stretching to north-east. At two miles entered plain of saltbush
and open mulga, which stretched about three miles to the west,
where sandhills were again visible. We crossed the plain at four
miles, highest point 1,925ft. above sea level. Passed shallow dry
clay-pans on this flat. Saw numbers of natives' tracks, also
brush traps, erected for trapping wallabies or rats. Travelled on
over low rides of sand with low ti-tree bushes, dense triodia,
few scrub mulga, occasional desert gums, quondong, few acacia,
and few belts of mulga, and poor dry grass, in loamy flats.
Noticed limestone outcrops on saltbush plain, and sandstone and
ironstone, during the day. Aneroid at camp at 4.30 p.m. (after
travelling twenty miles for the day), 28.925, ther. 60&#176;;
calm, clear sky. Very little feed for camels. Tied them down at
6.30 p.m. Range to north now clearly seen. Hope to reach same
to-morrow. Camp is about 1,000ft. above sea level.</p>
<p>"July 18th.&#8212;Very cold last night and slight frost. Let
camels go at 5.30 a.m. Made start at 7.10 a.m. At 8.20 (two
miles) came upon a loamy flat and little ironstone, with roley
poley and mulga. Let the camels feed here for forty minutes. This
morning could see for great distance to. west and W.S.W., all
apparently low country, with occasional tops of sand ridges
showing above the horizon. Left again at 9 a.m. At three miles,
lowest flat 875ft., and at twelve miles highest point 1,060ft.
above sea level. Took a bearing to highest point of scrubby range
seen on 16th instant, 51&#176; mag. Country passed over this
morning of continuous open sand ridges, generally steep on south
side, clothed with low tame bushes and triodia, few low mulga,
quondong, acacia, and few poplars and mallee. Flats between of
red sandy soil and loam, with spinifex; occasional dense belts of
mulga. The ridges are from twenty to forty chains apart. Saw a
few casuarina and numbers of kangaroo rats this morning. Made
start again at 1 p.m., passing over similar country, with few
bloodwoods. At 4 p.m. reached range, which is of sandstone.
Aneroid at foot (camp), 28.700, ther. 64&#176;; south-east breeze,
clear sky; 1,225ft. above sea level. This range is timbered with
pines and mulga. Gave the camels 4galls. of water apiece from
kegs; tied them down at 6.30 p.m. Observed for lat. 27&#176; 15'
54". Camp about fifteen chains north from most easterly end of
range. Found no water here this evening. Saw several old native
camps. To-day we passed over a great many burnt flats, apparently
done last summer. Travelled nineteen miles to-day.</p>
<p>"July 19th.&#8212;Let camels go at 3.40 a.m. Made start at.
7.15 a.m. Ascended to top of range, 1,375ft. above sea level.
Took bearings to several hills, and can see prominent range on
our bearing, which I presume must be the Blyth Ranges; 110&#176;
30', to highest point of scrubby range sketched yesterday, five
miles off; also bearing of both these ranges. This one runs one
mile to the east and two miles to westward; also bearing to camp,
forty chains distant; 47&#176; 45', to high prominent range thirty
miles off; 345&#176;, highest point seen in Blyth Range; 353&#176;
30', prominent top of range; 292&#176;, top one mile off;
170&#176;, top three-quarters of a mile off. Left on same bearing
at 7.15 a.m., passing over similar country to yesterday, except
flats (loamy in places, with dense mulga), being larger, from
twenty to sixty chains apart. Saw a few kurrajongs at noon, when
we camped for lunch, after travelling eleven miles. Fresh track
of native here going to westward. Left again at 12.55 p.m.,
passing over same description of country. At sixteen and a half
miles passed small shallow clay-pan, and at seventeen miles
camped on good saltbush, This patch, with mulga, is half a mile
across, stretching east and west. Aneroid at 3.30 a.m., 28.600,
ther. 64&#176;. Moderate breeze from N.E. Clear sky. Ascended
sandhill near camp during evening to look for smoke, Mr. Lindsay
having said he would light a fire on this date to let me know the
position of their camp; could see no sign. Expect to cut tracks
of camels to-morrow morning. To-day I noticed several outcrops of
limestone and flint, and small ferruginous stones.</p>
<p>"July 20th.&#8212;Let camels go at 3 a.m. Very cold; ther.
36&#176;. At 7.15 a.m. made start on same bearing. and passing
over similar country to yesterday, some of the ridges being very
steep on south side. Reached the range at 10.30 a.m., distant
eight miles. Found the pad of the caravan, having passed to
westward, which I followed until the evening of the 22nd, when I
reached the party two miles north-east of Skirmish Hill, in
latitude, by Mr. Lindsay, 26&#176; 23' 51". During my absence from
the party I travelled each of the thirteen days. and covered a
distance of 240 miles, all over miserable sand ridges, finding
water was a great assistance to the camels. They do not do well
in that class of country. Seeing so many tracks of natives leads
me to believe that there are many more rockholes in these sand
ridges. The natives had only visited one of those found by me
(the first) for some time, and that for one night. The others
were full of water, and had not been used for at least twelve
months. I also saw many smokes from their hunting fires. The
existence of the bullock track I cannot account for, but do not
think it had been long amongst the sand ridges, probably it had
strayed from some very distant run. There are apparently many
natives in this locality. Ever since cutting the caravan pad we
have seen all along it fresh tracks of natives going either
way&#8212;of men, women, and children, some of them leaving the
pad and going towards the south and west."</p>

<p><i>Monday, July 27th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 37&#176;. Cloudy, cold;
strong south-east wind. Camp 29. I went on bearing 175&#176; to a
granite hill four miles distant. No water. Then turned to go for
Mount Morphett, and in two miles saw some rocks on the right, a
likely place for a rockhole. Went to them, and found a hole, the
entrance to it being blocked by a large boulder. The hole is
about 8ft. deep, with about 100galls. in it, very difficult to
get at; but I managed to water Misery with my leather riding
cloth. Bearings to Skirmish Hill, 109&#176;; the hill I visited,
143&#176;, distant two and a half mules; Borrow's Hill, 269. This
is the third rockhole discovered inside other explorers' tracks,
which they missed. The caravan made on for diorite hills, where I
overtook them. Distance thirteen miles, the last two being
through very good country&#8212;clayey soil, mulga and good stock
bushes, dead roley poley, saltbush, and grass, but all very dry.
We then turned northwards two and a half miles to foot of
Cavenagh Ranges to find Fort Mueller. Camped on very good feed,
Mitchell grass plains, saltbush, &amp;c. We saw distinctly at one
place the wheel marks of Gosse's dray. Few fresh native tracks;
kangaroos. A. very good stock country, but extremely dry. No rain
can have fallen for very many months. Where the hills have been
burnt the waterbush is very luxuriant. By observation we found we
are on the latitude of Fort Mueller, but no "remarkable peak" is
to be seen. Camp 30. Lat. 26&#176; 11' 49". Max. temp. 63&#176;,
min. temp. 37&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 49&#176;, bar. 28.36; 3 p.m.,

<p><i>Tuesday, July 28th.</i>&#8212;Camp 60&#176;. Ther. 34&#176;.
Cold. East wind. Mr. Wells found a few buckets of water in a
small creek about one mile. west from the camp; this is where the
natives are getting their water. They have duo. a hole in the
pipeclay, and the water slowly, very slowly, drains in and fills
it. We proceeded along the range westward to find Fort Mueller.
The descriptions given of the locality are not very lucid, and it
is more difficult to find than would be imagined. We climbed a
big broken granite and diorite hill, and saw a pile of stones on
top of a hill on the north side of a valley, which we supposed
must be Forrest's "remarkable peak". We all went around the west
end of this hill, and found a broad valley, with a large
watercourse coming from the eastward. Mr. Wells climbed the
mountain; I was not able to, my leg and back being so weak. It
was very high, quite 700ft. Mr. Wells reported that it could not
be the hill we expected, and from the appearance of the country
he thought we should follow up the valley we had crossed. As we
were returning we found a tree marking Gosse's 14 dep&#244;t
<small>G/O/S/14</small> (encircled), showing that Mr. Wells had
been on top of Mount Cooper (Gosse). It is a peculiar fact that
though three explorers (Gosse, Giles, and Forrest) had been here,
yet they had not fixed the same hill or joined their work.
Forrest had seen Giles' tree, but no fixing was given of it. We
followed up the valley, instructing the caravan to wait for us.
Soon found Giles' tree, a bloodwood, on the northern bank of the
watercourse. Seeing a well-beaten horsepad leading up the gully,
we continued. up, and found the creek as dry as a bone. No sign
of water; no likely looking place for a spring&#8212;just a rocky
gorge with the creek bed full of great crooked ti-tree. Nothing
very remarkable about the rocks. Mr. Forrest's remarkable peak is
a round peak, the top being formed of broken diorite, but as the
bill does not show up until you are quite close it is of no
assistance to anyone looking for Fort Mueller. Had we crossed
over the range from our last night's camp we should have come
right into the gorge. Returned to the caravan, and camped at the
entrance to the valley. Very good country. Friable reddish clay
loam, mulga, acacias, saltbush, Mitchell grass, roley poley,
waterbush, &amp;c.; kangaroos. The country is in an extremely dry
state. Distance&#8212;caravan, eight; I, eight=sixteen miles.
Max. temp. 66&#176;, min. temp. 34&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 47&#176;,

<p><i>Wednesday, July 29th.</i>&#8212;Mr. Wells and doctor went
south ten miles to Borrow's Hill to take a round of bearings with
the theodolite, and to look for water. Leech and Gwynne went to
examine some likely looking gullies, and open out the small water
found by Mr. Wells. I, accompanied by Ramsay, left camp at 9.50,
and went 273&#176; for nine miles to two kurrajong hills; no
water; then 348&#176; for six miles to Lightning Rock of Giles, at
which we found a rockhole full of <i>debris</i>, but I pushed a
stick in 3ft. below the surface of the water. Impossible to
estimate the quantity of water. Walked around to the north-west
side of the hill, and there saw the native well found by Mr.
Tietkens when he and Mr. Giles were making back to their
dep&#244;t at Fort Mueller in 1872. It is a large rockhole full
of blown sand, into which the natives have dug, say, 10ft. or
12ft., and a little water is showing. I do not think there is
very much, as the rocks having sloping sides must soon meet.
Camped. Sixteen miles. The country to-day consists of sand ridges
irregular with flats between, in which are numerous small
hillocks of limestone, spinifex, acacia, salicina, mulga,
bloodwood, with very luxuriant waterbush on the burnt sandhills.

<p><i>Thursday, July 30th.</i>&#8212;S.E. wind; clear; warmer
than usual. From top of Lightning Rock 279&#176; 30', to Mount
Bust; 290&#176;, granite outcrop, eight miles. probably rockhole:
296&#176;, Mount Rawlinson; 223&#176; around hill, twenty-five
miles; 240&#176;, Mount Squires. Eight miles on bearing 290&#176;
over few sandhills, spinifex, and thick mulga in patches took us
to a granite outcrop, with fresh native, emu, and kangaroo
tracks. Fifteen chains from the hill and bearing 10&#176; I found
a very nice rockhole, containing, perhaps, 200galls. of water or
more&#8212;forty chains from the top of the biggest hill. This is
a new rockhole missed by the other explorers. Changed our course
to 275&#176; for some rocks. Saw numerous fresh native tracks;
they are living on these rockholes. Six miles we came to the
granite rocks and turned south for half a mile and found a
circular shaped cavity in the rock, in which I think is a good
deal of water, but much <i>debris</i>; 225&#176;, three miles
through very dense mulga took us to the immense rockhole of John
Forrest. We found a considerable quantity of water and some good
waterbush. Camped for tea, but as the natives were numerous we
went three miles out on the plain on bearing 115&#176;, and camped
at a big acacia bush. Distance for the day, twenty&#173;one miles;
and we had good luck in finding two new rockholes, besides
getting to Forrest's rockhole. Just before reaching the second
hole, Bob called out, "Here is the niggers' camp; fire's alight,
and there is a dingo. By jove, there is a nigger behind that
bush." I turned and saw an old man who had evidently been asleep;
he was too feeble to run away. I gave him some tobacco, a red
handkerchief, and some bread. Pointing over to the rocks he said
"Kapi." After looking at the rockhole we climbed on top of the
rocks and saw smokes arising in the direction of our tracks,
showing that some of the natives out hunting had crossed them.
Presently we saw four or five coming towards the camp, making
fires, but they were afraid to come right in. At last we got
tired of waiting. so showed ourselves, and waved our
handkerchiefs; the niggers took one steady look at us and ran off
along the edge of the mulga thicket, which surrounds these rocks.
After waiting for some time we went down into the mulga, to get
speech with them, if possible. We got quite close to a
party&#8212;the old man, a young man, his wife, and two small
boys. They did not see us until I called out "Wiya. itchura" (I
will not hurt you), when, after one glance at us, they all,
except the old man, threw down what they were carrying and ran
off in different directions as fast as they could; the man
knocked down the boys in his hurry to get away. The mulga was too
dense for pursuit, so we returned to the foot of the hill, and on
the south-west side found a small rockhole, dry. We then rode
south-westerly for the other rocks. At the first pile of rocks we
came to I heard a child crying in the direction of another
granite outcrop, fifteen chains distant; proceeded in that
direction, and saw some natives sitting by their fires. I slipped
off my camel and gave the reins to Bob, while I went on foot,
hoping thus not to frighten them, but immediately on seeing me,
70yds. away, they all jumped up and, snatching up their children,
ran off to the rocks, leaving an ancient dame, whose skin was
wrinkled over her body in many hundreds of lines. She like the
old man we had seen at the last camp was unable to run away, and
I suppose thought she had "lived her life", and death sooner or
later now mattered not. I approached her speaking in her own
tongue, gave her tobacco and a red handkerchief. She told me
"Kapi, naiennunni" (water, sit down), and pointed to the rocks
near by. This is rather a large camp, and, with the last camp,
judging by the tracks and sleeping places, contains considerably
over fifty natives. The camps are not permanent. It is evident
that we have got into a thicker populated country, and I think
the waters already found will do for a dep&#244;t but there will
be none to spare. After we had examined the rockhole, which was a
good one, but not so large as from the description I had expected
to find. I climbed up on the rocks and met a lubra, impelled by
curiosity, coming around by a big rock. She did not wait to
answer any questions, but was off like a scared wallaby. Kangaroo
tracks numerous. Day's travelling&#8212;290&#176;, eight and a
half miles; 275&#176;, six miles, south half-mile; 225&#176;, three
miles; 115&#176; three miles=twenty-one miles. With the caravan.

<p><i>Friday, July 31st.</i>&#8212;Last night closed in cloudy,
and this morning broke as though there was rain to the south.
Wind south. As the day advanced the clouds spread, and at midday
light rain was falling away to the east. Passed at the north foot
of Mount Blyth a garnetiferous granite hill. At fourteen miles we
stopped to give the camels a feed of waterbush, of which there is
a considerable quantity on the burnt patches. This plant is a
Godsend to the camels. I believe they could easily go a month
without water if they had this bush every day. It grows as high
as 8ft. At twenty-five miles reached the camp. Mr. Wells reported
having found a good rockhole twelve miles south, near Borrow's
Hill, whose capacity is about 7,000galls. Mr. Gosse had missed
this fine water. The camels having been fourteen days with only
5&#189;galls. of water each, I will send them down there
to-morrow. Max. temp., 60&#176;, min. temp. 40&#176;. At 9 a.m.,

Mr. Wells took a round of bearings from Borrow's Hill with the
theodolite. The hill is 2,150ft. above sea level, and Mr. Wells'
journals read as follows:&#8212;"Borrow's Hill, which is the
highest of a group of granite hills, is 2,150ft. above sea level.
Proceeded to granite outcrop, bearing 266&#176; 57', distant two
miles, and found a large rockhole nearly dry. It would hold
7,000galls. when full. Camped here. Camp is 1,500ft. above sea
level; 650ft. below summit of Borrow's Hill. There are a number
of native drawings on the granite outcropping rocks near the
rockhole. Saw some recent tracts of natives. Rode all around the
hill but found no more water, although I saw a dry rockhole
bearing 333&#176; 55' from Borrow's Hill. Dr. Elliot copied the
native drawings."</p>

<p><i>Saturday, August 1st.</i>&#8212;Camp 31, at foot of Mount
Cooper, Cavenagh Ranges. Ther. 24&#176;; cold south wind. Mr.
Leech took the camels down to the rockhole discovered by Mr.
Wells near Borrow's hill. The camels only drank 9galls. each and
left water in the hole. Leech returned at sundown, but the
caravan did not arrive. Hobble-making, pointing the steel bar;

<p><i>Sunday, August 2nd.</i>&#8212;Camp 31. Cold heavy fog;
south-east wind. Camels came early, and we got.away at 9.40.
going west to Mount Blyth. Camped on excellent feed at 2.40,
twelve miles; warm sun, pleasant. Most of us have headaches.
Gwynne says he is terribly bad, and he must lie down; probably it
is the kangaroo meat we have been eating for the last few days.
Yet Mr. Wells complains, and he has eaten no meat. The travelling
to-day was for four miles through mulga, and grass, clayey loam,
then sandhills, spinifex, valleys, with limestone outcrops,
bloodwoods, gums, quondong, acacia, waterbush, &amp;c. Good camel
country, but wretched for other stock. Max. temp. 78&#176;, min.

was very rough and sharp, Mr. Helms would ride straight on, and I
had to ask him to avoid the stones as much as possible.</p>
<p><i>Monday, August 3rd.</i>&#8212;Camp 32. Ther. 22&#176;; dew
and ice. East wind, clear. Started at 8.30. One of the camels
sick. Gwynne better. At noon we passed Mount Blyth, with good
feed, roley poley in big green bunches, waterbush, &amp;c. At 3
p.m. reached Forrest's rockhole and camped. At 2 o'clock we saw
two smokes north and north-east, also one to the south, evidently
signals, as one appeared immediately after the other, and only
lasted a few minutes. Fresh native tracks. After dark we could,
from the camp, see the files of the natives camp at the rockhole
discovered by me the other day about eight miles distant. The
fires are numerous. All the natives must have collected there; if
so they will not leave much water. North wind in the afternoon.
Distance fifteen and a half miles. Camp 33; dep&#244;t 2,
1,565ft. above sea level. Trees marked by Forrest and Mills. Max.

<p><i>Tuesday, August 4th.</i>&#8212;Camp 33. Mr. Wells, with Bob
and Mahmoud Azim, five camels, 80galls. of water, and one month's
rations, started for a trip southerly in search of water. I and
Mr. Streich accompanied them to Mount Squires, twelve miles
distant, taking the theodolite to get a round of bearings. We
passed through level mulga and spinifex country, with occasional
outcrops of broken granite, on which are growing pine trees. At
the north foot of Mount Squires I saw the track of an emu going
towards the mount, and two crows flew in that direction. I
followed the track, which led me up a nice gum creek. A native
had also gone up that way. I went as far as I could get the
camels, but saw no water. There are evidences of a rain having
fallen here a month or two ago, and I suppose there is a rockhole
somewhere. At the east foot of the mount, which is at the south
end of the Barrow Ranges, there was some fresh waterbush and
roley poley, so we camped. Mr. Wells, Streich, and I ascended the
mount, which is 2,270ft. high (680ft. above the camp). Saw a
native smoke spring up about twenty miles distant. A curious
deviation of the needle was noticeable. The hill is of syenite,
and the theodolite was set up on a large boulder. The smoke burst
up just before the theodolite was levelled. I asked Mr. Wells to
take a bearing with his compass in case the smoke should die away
before I was ready. He did so, and said 212&#176; 30'. I read the
theodolite 207&#176;. Mr. Wells was standing close against the
instrument. I then read my compass on the opposite side of the
theodolite, and it read 207&#176; We then exchanged compasses, and
he read 212&#176;, and I 207&#176;. Then he came on my side and
read his compass 207&#176;. Ten yards forward (S.) the compasses
both read 220&#176; Fifty yards further on both read 218&#176;.
Twenty yards back from the theodolite both read 218&#176;. Very
strange that 2ft. on the same rock should give such a difference.
A round of magnetic bearings were taken with theodolite, the
needle being very much affected. The country to the south is
apparently stony and undulating, with dense belts of mulga and
numerous sand ridges. Going down the watercourse from the hill I
noticed that some of the drift wood was recent; bushes, say, two
or three months old. We may be getting out of the dry belt and
into country where rain has fallen. I hope it may prove to be so,
as then our onward course will be made easy. When we returned to
camp Bob said two natives had been on the rocks close to camp,
but he could not get speech with them. Am glad to see them,
because there must be water near. I will have a look round this
hill to-morrow. I am sorry to hear from Mahmoud that the Afghans'
meat supply is getting short. This is extremely annoying. Only
half the time out. This is one of the troubles with Afghans: you
cannot control their meat. The clay was hot. No wind. Evening
warmer than usual. Light north wind. At camp 33. Max. temp.
71&#176;, min. temp. 25&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 54&#176;, bar.

<p><i>Wednesday, August 5th.</i>&#8212;Thermometer with us
42&#176;. At the dep&#244;t, twelve miles north, it was freezing.
Started at 7.40, southerly, and in half a mile, found a
watercourse leading east, and we bade good-bye to Mr. Wells, who
would come back to the dep&#244;t via this camp, so that if we
found any water at this hill he would be able to give his camels
a drink if they wanted one. We followed up the watercourse, which
was very rough and stony, and found about 500galls. or 700galls,
of water in some rockholes half a mile up the creek. Mr. Streich
went back to our camels for my towel, soap, and quart pots, while
I searched farther up the creek. We indulged in the luxury of a
bath. We then returned and left a note for Mr. Wells on a tree,
and another under the fire at the camp, and also blazed a tree
and wrote on it that he could get water by following up the
creek. We then wound around the south foot of Mount Squires,
through dense mulga, but did not find Mr. Giles' tank. Saw no
birds, tracks of animals, or natives. At 1 o'clock we were clear
of the range, and mounting our steeds (we had been leading them
all the morning) rode fast over very good country&#8212;open
mulga, with good grass, acacias, and saltbush&#8212;until 6.20,
when we reached the camp, having only had two miles of spinifex.
Native tracks numerous. Saw four separate smokes to the south and
south-west, promising good luck for Mr. Wells. Found all well in
camp, and that eleven natives had come in, friendly, but very
frightened. While some members of the party were talking to them,
and trying to establish friendly relations with them, Mr. Helms
discharged both barrels of his gun into the air, thus effectually
dispersing the poor creatures, and nothing would induce them to
return. They camped in the dense mulga, about half a mile from
our camp. Last night bright fires were burning at the hill, eight
miles distant, but none to-night. Flocks of galars visit this
rockhole, and the doctor had been making slaughter amongst them.
Camp 33. Distance, twenty-four miles. Zodiacal lights visible
last night.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, August 6th.</i>&#8212;My camel had a drink on the
15th July, then on the 17th had another; since when, until
to-day, he has only had two buckets of water, so that in twenty
days he has only had 6galls., and by his appearance would have
gone a week or two longer without a drink. Took him up to the
rockhole and he only drank 12galls. Mr. Streich and I went over
to the natives, taking only our revolvers, so that they would not
be afraid. After some little difficulty we induced four men to
come on the rocks to us, when we gave them four handkerchiefs,
two knives, and some tobacco, thus, I hope, showing our friendly
disposition towards them. They were very frightened and excited,
and by their gesticulations. evidently wanted us to go away. We
saw a few more natives dodging about amongst the mulga. Could not
get any in formation from them, and could not induce them to sit
down quietly for a chat. They kept. edging away off the rocks,
and one old fellow worked himself up into quite a fever of
excitement. Hadji and two men took the spare camels east to keep
them on the green waterbush, it being arranged that he was to
look out specially at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. every day, and if he saw
a smoke at the camp he was to return at once. Mr. Leech and Abdul
accompanied them to the rockhole, eight miles distant, where they
would give their camels a drink, fill up their water casks, and
then proceed to the north-west into block B to search for any
traces of Gibson, the poor fellow who lost himself when returning
from Mr. K Giles in 1872. When they were starting Hadji told me
that he did not think the camel Bones, which had been sick for a
week, would get better, and wanted to leave him in the camp. I
gave instructions that if the natives showed up again they were
to be very careful not to let them come into the camp. If they
were hanging about, to keep watch, and that the camp was never to
be left with less than two men in it. Dr. Elliot and I then left
the camp to go as far west as time would. permit, looking at the
waters discovered by John Forrest in 1874, promising to be back
in ten or twelve days. We only took our riding camels and twelve
days' water. We struck a native trail, which led us west over the
Barrow Ranges, just about where. Mr. Forrest must have crossed
it. When crossing the rocky saddle of the range we lost the trail
and had much difficulty in picking it up on the other side, as
the natives had separated and zigzagged about with the evident
intention of baffling pursuit should they be followed. Although
we lost some time, we were only able to make one mile, when the
tracks went in all directions, some of them up into the hills. We
camped. only six miles west of camp 33. Max. temp. 72&#176;, min.
temp. 24&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 60&#176;, bar. 28.35; 3 p.m. then.
71&#176;; bar. 28.27. Faint zodiacal lights and many shooting
stars.</p>
<p><i>Friday, August 7th.</i>&#8212;Warm, clear, and calm.
Climbed a hill of diorite. Tried to follow the native. tracks,
but owing to their separating got confused; the last I saw were
going E.S.E., a direction I do not. want to go, as I want to
visit Barlee Springs, about nine miles to the westward. For some
little distance we had hard clayey loam, with mulga and acacias;
then the sandhills, clothed with spinifex, crossed our course. A.
rough range lay along on our right hand. At about six miles we
entered mulga, which extends up to the hills, and saw the track
of one native going in our direction. Presently, where he had
sent up a smoke, a woman's track joined his. A little further on
another smoke had been sent up, and another native joined them.
These tracks led us into the gully, and through some very
extensive old native encampments. Then We came to the Bailee
Springs, which in 1874 Mr. J. Forrest described as a "fine
spring"; and now there is only a very small quantity of water to
be had by digging in the <i>debris</i> which has filled up a
rocky hole in the creek bed. As we were riding along the doctor
saw a native up on the hill side. I climbed up the hill, and saw
the pile of stones erected by Mr. Forrest. The natives attacked
Mr. Forrest here. A native man with a very sore leg came down to
us, showing but little fear of us. We gave him bread, tobacco,
and a red handkerchief. Pointing to some hills on bearing
230&#176; he said "Kapi kairo" (creek water); pointing to the
Townsend ridges, which were in sight, he said, "Kapi nurtpa" (no
water). The doctor did something to the. old fellow's leg, and we
proceeded clown the creek, much disappointed with Barlee Springs,
and found very good country&#8212;large gum trees, acacias,
mulga, myall, bloodwood, mallee grass, roley poky. limestone
ridges, few sand ridges clothed with spinifex. At 4.30 I climbed
a low hill, and saw some prickly acacias ahead, to which we
proceeded one-quarter of a mile and camped. Have not made much
to-day, owing first to trying to follow the natives' tracks, then
meeting the natives, and climbing the hill and searching up the
creek for water. I think we are going to the shoeing camp of Mr.
E. Giles, but it is difficult to recognise the country from the
description given in his book without a plan, and I am not
certain whether there are two hills bearing the one name, or
whether his position and Mr. Gosse's agree. Mr. Gosse did not
find the water at Giles' shoeing camp. At camp 33. Max. temp.
77&#176;, min. temp. 25&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 64&#176;, bar.
28.34; 3 p.m., ther. 73&#176;, bar. 28.25; faint zodiacal lights
and many shooting stars.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, August 8th.</i>&#8212;Clear, calm, colder. As we
were riding along we saw on our right a thin blue column of smoke
rising out of the mulga, and then a smoke sprang up a quarter of
a mile ahead of us. We. hastened on to it, and picked up a
native's track making for a gully in the range on our left. We
followed it and found a pad leading through the range, but as
soon as. we emerged on to the plain the pad died out, and
although we searched about we could see no indications of water.
Returning through the gully, we made across to where we had seen
the first smoke rising, and there found where quite a large
number of natives had slept last night, only about two miles from
where we camped, unconscious of their close proximity. We
followed their tracks, and in a gully in a low black range, very
stony and covered with mulga, we found a very little water under
a rock in the creek bed, this being the "Kapi kairo" of "The King
of Barlee", as we designated the gentleman we met there. The
doctor remained with the camels while I followed a distinct
native trail over the hills and out on to the plain on the north
side, where the fresh tracks separated. I returned, and we
resumed our westerly journey along the range and camped on a few
acacias at 5.10. Only made ten miles. Tracks of natives very
numerous. We find the camels we are riding are both very slow,
and wish we had Misery and Kangaroo, but these two wanted a
spell, Misery (my camel) being very tender-footed. At camp 33.
Max. temp. 73&#176;, min. temp. 29&#176;. At 9 a.m., ther. 59&#176;,
bar. 28.39; 3 p.m., ther. 70&#176;, bar. 28.35. Strong whirlwinds
at midnight. Two splendid meteors towards north.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, August 9th.</i>&#8212;Clear, calm, warm. The camels
ate very little last night. It is a curious fact that camels do
not care to eat the third night without water, but want to have a
drink and often make straight away if let loose. We proceeded on
a bearing of 280&#176; through dense mulga and spinifex for four
miles; then 330&#176; for two miles; then 280&#176; again. At
twelve and a half miles, having followed a native track for a
mile, found a small granite cup (dry). At a hill about
three-quarters of a mile slightly to the right we found a fine
large rockhole, but the natives had yesterday drained the last
drop of water out of it. The trail now being hot we followed it,
and in two miles camped on good acacias. We wasted some time
picking up the trail from the different camping places. Travelled
about twenty miles. At camp 33. Max. temp. 70&#176;; min. temp.
33&#176;. At 9 a.m. ther. 55&#176;, bar. 28.41; 3 p.m. ther.
68&#176;, bar. 28.36.</p>
<p><i>Monday, August 10th.</i>&#8212;Clear, calm, cool. Started
north-west at 7.40. In one mile stopped to search for rockholes,
as the old native encampments were very numerous; found a good
hole, bat dry. At three miles further on saw a crow flying to
some rocks half a mile south-west, to which we proceeded, and
found that the natives had camped here last night. We found a
well 18ft. deep in a great basin in the granite rocks, which was
full of earth. There was very little water, the natives having
obtained their drinks by putting a bunch of fibre on a stick,
pushing it into the water, and then sucking the fibre. This was
shown by my seeing the stick and the fibre in a crevice in the
side of the well. I was unable to get any water with a pannican.
Great numbers of galas (pink cockatoo) came here to drink. The
doctor shot a few. This is the spring or native well which Mr.
Forrest discovered after searching all through these ranges (the
Warburton) in 1874, and which he thought would make a good
dep&#244;t for his party if necessary. The old camps of the
natives are more numerous around here than we have seen anywhere
else. The natives had split up from here and gone in all
directions&#8212;followed the trail of a few towards Mount
Harvest. This is a very good pastoral country, but suffering from
a prolonged drought; open mulga, good grasses, saltbush, and
acacias. When we got in amongst the hills the travelling became
painfully slow, owing to the broken stony nature of the hills. At
about six miles we decided that, having been five days out and
that to go to the Sutherland Ranges would take us five days
longer, with no prospect of getting any water there&#8212;as Mr.
Forrest found none permanent&#8212;we should follow down a creek
in these ranges and have a look for water there, as we saw a
smoke bearing 140&#176;. We considered it very improbable that
there would be any water at Alexandria Spring, 170 miles further
west, as we had found the splendid springs at Fort Mueller and
Barlee dry; then this last spring also, and all the rock holes
empty, showing no rain had fallen here for years. Farther than
that, I recollect that Mr. Mills, in 1883, had a hard push for
his life, owing to one of the springs on Forrest's track having
failed, and and I fancy it must have been Alexander Spring. We
followed the Elder Creek from its head right out on to the
plain&#8212;a local thunderstorm had fallen just on that creek
some months back&#8212;but we could find no sign of water. Saw a
dead gum tree, of which there were a great many, marked <small>E.
GILES,/</small>73 showing the spot where Mr. Giles had found a
little water in 1873; but no sign of any now, Fine gum trees and
prickly acacias. Nice grazing country. Followed up some of the
gorges and climbed amongst the rocks, but no water. Camped on the
edge of the plain. The first rockhole seen was an immense one. At
camp 33. Max. temp. 79&#176;, min. temp. 25&#176;. At 9 a.m. ther.
57&#176;, bar. 28.33; 3 p.m. ther. 70&#176;, bar. 28.17.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, August 11th.</i>&#8212;Wind north-east. Clear and
cold. I slept a little later than usual, having had my eyes
covered up to protect them from the cold wind. Few clouds in the
south and south-west. I hope it is raining down there. Wind
veered to north and blew very strong. We searched about amongst.
the ranges and came to the natives' smoke, but saw no sign of
water; then steered for Burke Spring, making a distance of
twenty-two miles for the day. Barometer very low, 28.84. At camp
33. Max. temp. 79&#176;, min. temp. 35&#176;. At 9 a.m. ther.
64&#176;, bar. 28.17; 3 p.m. ther. 75, bar. 28.10.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, August 12th.</i>&#8212;Clear, calm, warm,
lightning in the south. Our course took us over spinifex
sandhills, with small patches of waterbush here and there. As we
were travelling along I noticed the fresh track of a native, and
presently from behind us we heard a call. Looking back we saw a
black man, who came fearlessly towards us with his spears in his
hand. I laid my camel down, and tried to induce him to get on,
but failed. He pointed to Shoeing Camp and Barlee Spring for
water and natives. He travelled along with us for a few miles,
and then seemed unwilling to go any further, so we camped, having
done eighteen miles, thinking he might stay with us all night and
go on next day and show us some waters in this neighborhood. We
gave him his supper, which he was not at all eager to eat. Sugar
took his fancy most. How differently we are faring with the
natives to Forrest and Giles. They were attacked or had trouble
with them, while we are establishing friendly relations on every
occasion. Just before dark the nigger grew very restless and
could not be persuaded to stay with us. Of course it was no use
using force to detain him. If we had the caravan here I would
have tied him up and carried him along to show us the waters in
this drought-stricken region. Our camels know where the water is
and do not care to feed. They are very thirsty, as the weather
has been hot. To day a strong hot north and north-west wind has
been blowing. A few clouds. Oh for a shower of rain! Forrest and
Giles said when here in 1873 and 1874 "Oh for camels, how easy I
would get through", and so they would. With the seasons they had
it would have been a perfect picnic, or rather pleasure trip. My
sigh is for a less number of camels and four men only, and how
easy I would get through in spite of the drought. Forty-four
camels at a drink need about (after, say, ten days without water)
800galls., and fourteen men use a considerable quantity in a few
days. At camp 33. Max. temp. 82&#176;, min. temp. 38&#176;. At 9

<p><i>Thursday, August 13th.</i>&#8212;Calm, clear, afterwards
hazy, with very strong north wind. Started at 7 a.m. Reached
Barlee Spring at 9.30. Watered our two camels, and took on
8galls. of water with us. Had a pot of tea, and started for camp
at 1 o'clock. Very unpleasant day. The wind is dry, not to say
hot. About 3 p.m. the wind went around to north-west, and at
sundown was due west. Heavy clouds to southward. Camped at 4.30
on roley poley, having lost three-quarters of an hour on
waterbush. Temp. 83&#176; in shade. Distance travelled. sixteen
miles. We were much surprised at not seeing some natives at the
water. At camp 33. Max. temp. 82&#176;, min. temp. 39&#176;. At 9

<p><i>Friday, August 14th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 43. Cold south-west
wind. Started at 7.20. Reached camp at 10 o'clock. Found all
well. No natives had been seen or heard. We had a better track
over the range than when going out. I do hope Wells has found
water, as this hole is nearly finished, and we are 400 miles from
either Windich Springs or Queen Victoria's Spring. While we have
been out Dr. Elliot and I have been trying how two quarts of
water each per day would do, and both agree that it will be a
sufficient allowance if we have to tackle a long dry stage, as in
all probability we shall. It was fortunate that I returned, as
those in camp had made up their minds to signal for Hadji
to-morrow to bring them water. This action would have been too
precipitate, as there is over a week's water in the hole yet. I
immediately put the party (five of us) on an allowance of two
buckets (6galls.) per day. Max. temp. 70&#176;, min. temp.
40&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.31, ther. 55&#176;; 3 p.m., bar.
28.31, ther. 64&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, August 15th.</i>&#8212;Cold, clear; ther.
22&#176;; ice. Gwynne and I went to the rockhole three miles from
the camp, and, to my disgust, found it absolutely dry, being in
shape like a tub, the first of that shape I have met with. Took
the camels with us for feed, as there is none around the camp.
Very little here; just enough for our two camels for one day.
According to my instructions, we are to make an exhaustive
examination from dep&#244;ts; therefore if I go straight for
Queen Victoria's Spring, over 400 miles, I shall leave a
considerable extent of country unexamined. Still, without a
dep&#244;t or a fair amount of water some 150 miles to the
southward, that piece cannot be examined. It is a serious
question to decide whether to go west towards Windich Springs,
hoping, against the probabilities, of being able to make a
dep&#244;t at Alexander Springs, and thus do the country to the
south and north; or go for Queen Victoria's Spring, with a chance
of not finding it, for Mr. E. Giles, the discoverer, says it is a
difficult, even dangerous, place for any one to attempt to find,
and having to go 130 miles farther before water is reached. I
prefer the latter, but am doubtful which is the best course to
pursue. Very perplexing. If I go west many will say I was afraid
to tackle the desert or leave another man's track. Still I do not
care for the opinion of such people. My desire is to do the work
entrusted to me as completely and satisfactorily as possible,
without lightly risking the lives of either the party or the
camels. Max. temp. 72&#176;, min. temp. 20&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.
28.41, ther. 55&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.36, ther. 55&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, August 16th.</i>&#8212;Cold and clear. I had again
to take the camels out to feed, as I cannot trust Gwynne to do
it, for on Friday I let the camels go and told him to watch them.
He lost sight of them for an hour, and then I told him I could
hear the bell in a certain direction. About half an hour later,
just before sundown, he came back for his coat, as it was getting
cold, and said he could not find the camels anywhere. I had to go
out and bring them in myself. And then he seems to have no idea
what is feed for them. In the evening I found that M Leech had
come about mid-day, having travelled a considerable distance
without any important result, the best news being the discovery
of a rockhole about ten miles away. I was sorry to learn from him
that the sick camel taken away by Hadji died that night. Abdul
tells me it had been sick for eight days. Hadji appears to know
very little about camel sickness. In fact he is a poor jimador;
not a patch on Joorak. One of Mr. Leech's camels had been
poisoned slightly, but recovered in a day or two. Max. temp.
80&#176;, min. temp. 28&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.34, ther.
63&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.23, ther. 79&#176;. Mr. Leech's camels
had a drink at the rockhole, ten miles back, and he brought some
water with him. His report of the journey is as

<p>"Camp 33, August 17th, 1891. Dear sir&#8212;The following is a
copy of my field notes, made during my trip N.W., with a rough
plan of the country travelled oven&#8212;<small>FREDERICK WM.
LEECH.</small></p>
<p>"Thursday, August 6th.&#8212;Leave camp at 1.15, bearing
75&#176; to a small hill, where there is a rockhole. Hadji and
three Afghans, with all the camels which are not in use, are
coming so far with me. Country between camp and rockhole spinifex
plains, with occasional patches of mulga scrub. Reached the small
hill and rockhole at 4.35. Distance, eight miles. Very good camel
feed around this camp, there being plenty of fresh green
waterbush. The niggers, whose fires we were able to see so
plainly from the dep&#244;t camp last night, have all cleared
out, but, to judge from their camps all around, there must have
been a considerable number here.</p>
<p>"Friday, August 7th.&#8212;One of the camels, which had been
sick for some time, died last night in great agony, to judge from
its groaning. None of the Afghans seemed to have any idea what
was wrong with the poor brute. Hadji told me last night, in reply
to a question of mine respecting his ailment, "Give it plenty
salts, master, all right by by"&#8212;his invariable remedy for
everything, which he recommended in the same way that a quack
doctor would one of his patent medicines. Having filled my water
casks, and giving my three camels a drink which I am taking with
me, we (Abdul and self) said good-by to the Afghans and started,
bearing 320&#176;. For the first few miles we were travelling
through mulga scrub, with occasional small rocky hills to the
left; then a small sandy plain covered with spinifex, and again
thick mulga scrub. At about ten miles, when in this scrub, I
noticed a smoke suddenly start up right ahead, and a few minutes
after saw many fresh tracks, all going in the same direction. At
eleven miles I came to a fine rockhole, fourteen paces long, 4ft.
wide, and 6ft. down to the water. Unfortunately, however, there
was not very much water, the little there was being carefully
covered over with sticks. There was a cleared space round the
rockhole of a a few hundred yards, but otherwise the thick scrub
all around would prevent anyone from seeing it, unless, indeed,
like myself, they chanced to come straight to it. I had not gone
more than a few hundred yards from the water when I suddenly came
upon a large native camp, with all the fires burning and every
appearance of its having been just deserted. There were many
weapons of various kinds about, and the numerous tracks in all
directions showed that they evidently had been frightened by the
noise of the camels when at the water. A few miles on some large
granite outcrops appear, but no signs of any rockholes. I Camped
at 4.15 on the edge of a spinifex plain, having made eighteen
miles.</p>
<p>"Saturday, August 8th.&#8212;Start at 7.15, same bearing,
320&#176;. Bearing to prominent black hill, 355&#176;. At five
miles, black hill bears 83&#176;. Occasional outcrops of limestone
occur, and some distance further we come to some kurrajong trees
and stunted mallee in low irregular sandhills, which class of
country continues for some miles. At sixteen miles came to a
rough sandstone ridge. The scrub was so dense that we had to
dismount and break a way for the camels, but fortunately it did
not last long. As soon as we crossed the ridge there was another
of the same description right ahead. In places very rough for the
camels, and I had to twist and turn about a bit to get over.
Camped at 4.7; distance, nineteen miles. Country passed over
to-day of a very poor description. Saw some old nigger camps and
tracks, and some smoke in the far distance.</p>
<p>"Sunday, August 9th.&#8212;Start at 7.5, bearing 328&#176;; at
two and a half miles cross rough stony ridge, and at three and a
half miles pass through valley; in another ridge at four and a
half miles. I altered my course to due west, the country being
very rough, and the stony hills preventing my going straight. Go
west for two miles, when I clear the hills and resume my bearing
320&#176;. In the hills there was evidence of great quantities of
rain having fallen at one time or another, as the numerous small
creeks and watercourses had well-defined flood marks, and in many
places large heaps of driftwood were piled up against the bushes.
When I cleared the hills the usual spinifex flats, alternating
with patches of scrub, were met with. In the afternoon some high
sandhills made a change for the worse, and from the top of each
of these hills my vision to the north and north-west was bounded
by other hills of like nature. Camp at 4; distance, nineteen
miles.</p>
<p>"Monday, August 10th.&#8212;Leave camp at 7.5. One of the
camels was very sick, having eaten some poison weed last night.
Abdul promptly dosed the unfortunate wretch with the usual
remedy, salts, and we got him to walk all right, but a bit shaky
on his legs. At 9.20 I stopped to give the sick camel another
dose of salts. The general direction of the sandhills is W.N.W.
and E.S.E., but in ten miles there is a change, and I come to low
irregular sandhills, with clumps of desert oak. Camped at 3.40;
distance, sixteen miles.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, August 11th.&#8212;Start at 6.55. Travelling as
usual over sandhills, which in places have clumps of bloodwood
growing on the ridges. Saw a hill in the extreme distance bearing
91&#176;. Having travelled seven miles on my usual bearing
320&#176; I determined to turn south, as it would now take the
remainder of my limited time to get back to camp, so at 10.20 I
altered my bearing to 180&#176;. At 3.30, when crossing a large
spinifex flat, Abdul called my attention to three niggers who
were sitting down under a bush some little distance ahead of me.
They must have seen or heard us about the same time, for they
promptly decamped notwithstanding the fact that I shouted at them
in the choicest collection of my limited native vocabulary. Abdul
also yelled at them endearing and pacific phrases in his own
barbarous language, and yet they sloped; so we saw them no more.
I was looking out for some camel feed all the afternoon, as so
far they have fared very badly, but it was a case of Hobson's
choice; so I was compelled to camp on a few miserable green
bushes, which were almost dry. Camped at 4.30; distance south,
eleven miles.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, August 12th.&#8212;Before starting I gave each of
the camels one bucket of water out of the casks, as the weather
has been very hot, and they are beginning to show signs of
fatigue. We were late in starting, as one of the camels had
wandered some distance in the night. In two miles I came to a
ridge with a very rough descent, sharp jagged stones, and very
thick scrub, so that I had to do some more winding in and out to
find a road for the camels; but having crossed this one there
were several others, and my clothes suffered very much forcing a
way through. Noticed some red mulga, once across the ridges, and
the usual flats and sand ridges, and again I was forced. to camp
on very poor feed for the camels. Camp at 4.30; distance, fifteen
miles.</p>
<p>"Thursday, August 13th.&#8212;Start at 7, bearing 180&#176;.
Having travelled five and a half miles, I stopped and went up a
very high sandhill a little on my right, but the view from it was
very uninteresting as far as the eye could see the same
description of useless miserable country. I now determined to
alter my course and strike in for the rockhole which I had found
on my way out, so as to give the camels a drink and fill up the
casks before returning to camp; so at 10 o'clock start on new
bearing 113&#176;. Came across some quondong trees with ripe
fruit; they were very acceptable to Abdul and myself. We left
none behind us. Country of the same description. Camped at 4.25,
having done thirteen and a half miles on the bearing
113&#176;.</p>
<p>"Friday, August 14th.&#8212;Start at 7. For some hours the
same miserable spinifex country, with the inevitable patches of
mulga scrub, and then for variety our old friends the sandhills.
In the afternoon passed some small hills and crossed another
ridge. Saw the Barrow Range from the top of one of these
sandhills. Camp at 4.30; distance, nineteen miles.</p>
<p>"Saturday, August 15th.&#8212;Start at 7. The country begins
to change a bit for the better as there are more bushes, and they
seem fresher and greener. I very soon came across a lot of small
hills, and lost considerable time in getting through the north
end of the Barrow Range as it was very rough and difficult
travelling for the camels. Reached the rockhole at 3; distance,
fourteen miles. Found that the natives had been there since my
first visit and had covered it up again very carefully. Gave the
camels a drink and filled the water casks to take into camp
to-morrow.</p>
<p>"Sunday, August 16th.&#8212;Start at 7.50, bearing 184&#176;.
Reach camp at 12. Ten and a half miles. During the trip I passed
over a most miserable class of country without any redeeming
features, the dried and. withered appearance of the herbage
clearly showing that no rain had fallen for a very considerable
time. Neither could I help noticing the almost entire absence of
game of any kind. One of the objects, indeed the chief one, of
this flying trip was to try if there were any signs or tracks
which might throw some light on the fate of the unfortunate
Gibson. I very much regret to say that I was altogether
unsuccessful in this respect, and I am of opinion that after such
a lapse of years it would only be by the merest chance that any
clue might be discovered."</p>

<p><i>Monday, August 17th.</i>&#8212;Cold. Strong south-east
wind. Ther. 38&#176;. Sent Gwynne and Abdul out with the camels to
feed. The doctor very kindly offered to take them out for me.
About 3 p.m. saw a smoke south-west of Mount Squires, which I
believe was made by Mr. Wells, who I expect here to-morrow. I
hope he will have found water suitable for us to move on to. Cool

clear. About 7 o'clock a strong east wind sprang up. Again sent
Abdul and Gwynne out with the camels to feed. Wells did not
arrive, so that the smoke which we saw yesterday must have been
natives. I am sorry for this, as the feed within four miles is
now finished. and I will have to send the camels some miles
further away; besides Hadji will be bringing all the camels back
here, and no place to send them to feed. At night the wind
changed to the west. Max. temp. 65&#176;, min. temp. 30&#176;. At 9

<p><i>Wednesday, August 19th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 23&#176;. Cold,
clear; south-east wind. Sent Abdul and Gwynne south to some hills
for feed for camels, with instructions to return to-morrow night.
No sign of Mr. Wells yet. This waiting is very terrible for me. I
cannot settle to do anything, as every day's delay here is of
serious import to us. Give me work. Work as hard as you like, but
do not ask me to wait in uncertainty with nothing to do. I would
not mind if there was plenty of water in the locality, but as
that is so scarce delay means placing us in a very awkward
position, unless, indeed, Wells has found water for us to go to.
The only advantage about this delay is that it is giving my leg
and back a complete rest; consequently, I hope to be able to
undertake the lion's share from this out. A smoke is to be seen
to the eastward, which I suppose is Hadji on his way here,
wondering why he has not been summoned before this. His rations
must be nearly finished. The wallabies are very numerous on the
granite rocks, and Mr. Helms has quite an array of stuffed bodies
hanging up. We have had good change of diet here&#8212;wallaby
and galar stews every day. Max. temp., 70&#176;, min. temp.

<p><i>Thursday, August 20th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 28&#176;. Ice, clear,
light south-east wind. Mr. Wells did not return last night. I am
really most anxious for his arrival, as our water will not last
many days, and we will not be able to get a fill up all round in
this part of the country. We want first 800galls., then in ten
days 1,060galls more&#8212;1,800 galls. or 2,000 galls.
altogether, to enable us to start for Queen Victoria's Spring.
Gwynne and Abdul returned at sundown, having had the camels on
good feed. Hadji's smoke again visible, but he has not shown up.

<p><i>Friday, August 21st.</i>&#8212;Thermometer 28&#176;. Clear,
south wind. Last night the moon rose almost blood-red and oval in
shape&#8212;quite remarkable. I, Abdul, and Gwynne went south to
the granite hills to feed the camels, I intending to go around
Mount Squires again to find out where the natives had gone. It
seems to me that there must be another water somewhere in that
range. Just after we had turned out (I wanted my camel to have a
feed before I started) I saw smoke westerly over the range and
also on this side, one and a half miles off. Watching, I saw
another one spring up some distance ahead, so I knew it was
Wells. Saddled up Tommy Dodd and rode across, but did not
overtake them until they reached the camp. Mr. Wells' report was
encouraging, in that 130 miles S.S.W. he had left about 300galls.
of water in a rockhole, but the country traversed is very poor,
<i>vide</i> his report. He, Leech, and I discussed matters, and
decided that our best course was to at once prepare and start
back on his tracks and so on for Queen Victoria's Spring. Mr.
Wells is of opinion that the country which will lay to the east
of our track, if we find no more waters, is nothing but the same
class of country, and from what he has seen there can be nothing
of importance in them. Alumgool came in from Hadji's camp for
some water, so I sent a message out by him to bring in the camels
early to-morrow morning. Mahmoud I sent out to join Abdul, so
that his camels can have feed. He was very grumpy and "did not
want this billet." "Just come back, no spell, no wash, no
tucker." I explained to him that there was no water in the
country and we could not delay a day. We at once set to work to
get the loading in order, repacking and tying up things. Everyone
delighted at the prospect of an early move, all being tired of
delays. All eager for the dart across the desert. Mr. Wells'
camels look wretched, showing what a hard trip they had. Max.

<p>"August 5th.&#8212;At foot of hill (Mount Squires) we left Mr.
Lindsay, and proceeded on bearing 224&#176; for smoke seen
yesterday. At seven miles passed west end of a sandstone ridge:
Country to there of dense mulga scrub and stony scrubby hills.
Selected specimens from top of the hill for the geologist. Saw
three smokes from natives (signals) bearing 189&#176; 202&#176;,
and 220&#176;. Left here at 11 a.m., and going towards most
westerly smoke over red ridges of sand and dense spinifex Rata,
few mulga belts, few acacia, quondong, and other bushes and low
ti-tree. Camped for lunch at ten miles. Left here at 1 p.m., and
travelled on over open broken sand ridges and dense spinifex,
with few belts of mulga, few acacias, poplars, ti-tree, quondong,
and other bushes. Camped at 4.30 p.m., having made about eighteen
miles. Aneroid 28.600, ther. 78&#176;; calm, clear sky, very warm
all day. Noticed smoke behind us at camp bearing 20&#176; mag. and
just behind sandstone ridge bearing from camp to Mount Squires
34&#176; 30'; lat. 26&#176; 26' 47".</p>
<p>"August 6th.&#8212;Very cold night, ice. Let camels go at 4.15
a.m. Made start at 7.35, bearing 224&#176; for smoke seen
yesterday. Passed over a small limestone outcrop. Saw at two
miles smoke on bearing; at five miles smoke 138&#176; 30'; high
point of sand ridge here 1,300ft. above sea level. 213&#176; smoke
very distant; 35&#176; to Mount Squires; 237&#176; distant smoke.
At eight miles dense belts of mulga and loamy flats, intersected
by limestone rises, prickly acacia, quondong, few myall, yellow
bark mallee, dense spinifex. At eleven miles camped for lunch, at
12.10 again entering sand ridges. Left again at 1 p.m.,
continuing on till 4 p.m. (nine&#173;teen miles), when T struck a
claypan with small patch of saltbush, and belt of myall, and
prickly acacia. Being such good camel feed I determined to camp
here. Aneroid at 4 p.m., 28.600; (her. 83&#176;; calm, clear sky,
very warm. Noticed several kurrajongs, bloodwoods, desert gums
this afternoon; remainder similar to yesterday. Saw several
tracks of natives and a few crows this evening; will look for
water to-morrow. I feel sure it is not far from here. Lat.
26&#176; 39' 8".</p>
<p>"August 7th.&#8212;Cold night. Let camels go at 5 a.m. Made
start with Ramsay to look for water; followed tracks of natives
in a round-about way, and after travelling about twelve miles
came upon camp of about a dozen natives bearing from our camp
359&#176; and seven miles distant. Was disgusted to find no water
about here, but saw where they had been chewing the bark from the
kurrajong roots in large quantities; also several of the trees
had the roots dug up. The camp was only that of one or perhaps
two nights. Returned to camp at 3 p.m. Owing to the good feed I
camped here again to-night. Travelled nineteen miles. Aneroid at
3.30, 28.600; ther. 73&#176;; slight easterly breeze, clear sky,
very warm all day.</p>
<p>"August 8th.&#8212;Cold night. Let camels go at 5 a.m., but
they made off, all being very thirsty owing to the very warm calm
clays we have had. Made start at 7.24 a.m., bearing for a high
point seen from Mount Squires 214&#176; mag. Travelled over open
sand ridges with dense triodia flats; desert gums, mallee, belts
of mulga, acacia, quondongs, dense low ti-tree patches, for six
miles; then loamy flats with ferruginous gravel and sandstone
outcrops; very dense mulga, some red; ascended to high point
1,600ft. above sea level, and selected specimens for geologist.
Seven miles. Could see a great distance from here to east and
south-east, all spinifex sand ridges and desert gums, should say
quite forty miles. Left top of hill on mag. bearing 200&#176;, and
at one mile left mulga and sandstone, and again entered sand
ridges as before described. Saw many recent tracks of natives,
and, as we had apparently left the kurrajong trees behind us. I
determined to again try tracking. On same bearing; camped on sand
ridge two miles from summit of hill and nine miles from camp of
last night. Had lunch, and started on foot, with Ramsay,
following fresh tracks from here, the camels being too thirsty to
get along at more than a snail's pace. Following the tracks in a
north-eastern direction for three miles, we found they had only
been hunting, the camp being somewhere to the south-west,
Returned to camp, and after resting for a few minutes I again
started on foot, taking the Afghan this time, following the
tracks in the opposite direction. After walking over sand ridges
for three miles, we came upon. a recent camp of not less than
twenty natives; we also found some good herbage (waterbush) on a
sand ridge here. The natives had evidently had some water here;
there are sonic more sandstone outcrops and patches of dense
mulga. It being late, I determined to return to the camp and
bring the camels over to the feed before daylight and let them
feed for two hours whilst we look for water. They have eaten
nothing to&#173;day, it being very warm. I saw several smokes
again to-day, two at a great distance to the E.S.E., and one a
few miles west, and another on our present bearing, say, ten
miles distant. We saw several crows and two cockatoos or
corellas. Noticed about sandstone ridges tracks of kangaroo and
emu. Aneroid at camp at 3.15, 28.425; ther. 80&#176;; calm, clear
sky.</p>
<p>"August 9th.&#8212;Up very early; packed the camels, and left
for feed at 5.45 a.m., on bearing 200&#176;. At two miles the feed
was thirty chains to west. At the same distance and a quarter of
a mile to the right found where the natives had been getting
water. Three small catch wells sunk in clay and sandstone
formation, and near dense belt of mulga. The largest would not
hold more than 140galls., if full. Cleaned out the mud, and found
that the natives had cleaned out all the water before leaving.
Hearing a shot from the Afghan about a quarter of a mile to the
south-west, I went over a sand ridge to where he had found
another recently-deserted encampment of the natives, about
twenty; also another catch well about the same size. We managed
to get about 5galls. of very dirty water from this hole and gave
it to the most distressed camel. After breakfast, the camels
having eaten all the waterbush, we made a start, first getting on
our bearing 200 mag. passing over loamy flats of firm soil and
ferruginous gravel, with occasional outcrops and rises of
sandstone, and few sand ridges. Dense belts of mulga on rises;
all country clothed with dense triodia, scattered desert gums,
mallee, acacia, quondongs, and low ti-tree. Saw smoke 80&#176;
from second catch well, about five miles distant. At nine miles
bearing to smoke 64&#176;; at twelve miles 192&#176; to distant
smoke; at fourteen miles a smoke bearing 307&#176;. Could see for
considerable distance to east and south-east, say, quite forty
miles&#8212;all apparently of similar sand ridge country, with
dense spinifex. At sixteen miles ascended a high rise, 1,650ft.
above sea level. Could see for great distances from here; all
apparently sandhills and open spinifex, belts of mulga descending
to flats below. We camped at 4.30 p.m. on open flats of
ferruginous gravel and few sand ridges. Noticed very open
country, with rise immediately to west for two or three miles.
Distance from camp, eighteen miles. Aneroid at 4.30 p.m., 28.410,
ther. 76&#176;; strong east breeze, clear sky; lat., 27&#176; 1'
17". Hitherto we have been very unfortunate in not finding any
useful water-holes, and I am of opinion we will not until a
change in formation takes place. I am in hopes of finding some
water about the smoke seen on our bearing to-day, and some
distance ahead. Noticed to-day tracks of natives, emu, and
kangaroo, and also saw two magpies this evening.</p>
<p>"August 10th.&#8212;Mild night. Let camels go on small patch
of poor waterbush found last evening. Made start at 7.30 a.m. on
same bearing (200&#176;), passing over loamy rises and flats of
gravel (ferruginous) for five miles; then entered lower country
of broken ridges of red sand and valleys of pines and mallee, all
clothed with dense spinifex, few acacia, quondong, and scattered
desert gums, with sandstone and quartzite ridges on either side,
from two to five miles off. Noticed round water-worn quartz
crystals and other stones. Saw smoke about on our bearing at five
miles, and on bearing 155&#176;, both some distance off. Travelled
on until 12.40 p.m., when we saw fresh tracks of natives. I
determined to camp here and run tracks; followed them from here
on bearing 290&#176;, when at one and a half miles we (Ramsay and
self) came to sandstone and quartzite ridge clothed with dense
mulga scrub. On entering the same found a recent camp of about
thirty natives; also, on top of rocky knob close by, two
rockholes about 100 gallons each, one of which had four and a
half gallons of dirty water in it, which we gave the camels. The
natives seem to have just finished the waters about here, and now
making off. Returned to camp at 4 p.m. Aneroid 28.475, ther.
70&#176;; moderate north-east breeze; clear sky. We gave the three
pack camels 4&#189;galls. of water apiece, leaving 25galls in
their kegs. Selected specimens of stone for the geologist. Lat.,
27&#176; 11' 30". Distance on course, twelve miles.</p>
<p>"August 11th.&#8212;Mild night. Made start at 6.30 a.m.; still
on same bearing, and travelling over same description of country
as that of yesterday. At four miles saw smoke bearing 273&#176;,
about three miles distant. Altered course at once, and went for
it. Surprised a lubra, who ran off, crying out for her
companions, who were evidently not far off. Ran tracks until we
lost them on stony ground. &#176;Searched about sandstone rise or
hill for some considerable time, when we at last found a camp
with log burning and several wooden dishes at it. Made further
search, when Mahmoud Azim found a rockhole with about 50galls. of
water; when full it would hold about 100galls. It is situated on
a flat sandstone outcrop, and almost surrounded by dense mulga,
with a sandstone rise about a half a mile south. From camp of
last night, at a point three miles on bearing 200&#176;, the
rockhole is about three miles due west. Gave the camels 45galls.
from the supply, and left the remainder for the natives. Made
start from here at 12.30 p.m., bearing 165&#176; mag., to cut
bearing of 200&#176; from camp. Reached same at high point
(sandhill before seen) 1,710ft. above sea level at five miles, or
eight miles from camp of last night. Continued on bearing
200&#176;, passing over similar country, except few kurrajongs and
desert gums more numerous, less acacia. Camped at fifteen miles,
having travelled twenty-two miles for the day. Aneroid at 4.30
p.m., 28.175, ther. 74&#176;. Strong gusts of wind, and breeze
from north-west. Clouds rising from south. Bearing 7&#176; to a
bluff. We saw fresh tracks of emu, also three corellas. Let
camels go early on poor feed.</p>
<p>"August 12th.&#8212;Made start on some bearing, 200&#176;, at
7.30 a.m., passing over sand ridges bearing about 290&#176;, and
generally continuous. Dense spinifex and large desert gums, few
Kurrajong, mallee, acacia, quondong, low ti-tree, and small belts
of mulga, few loamy flats, and little ferruginous gravel. At
twelve miles noticed smoke bearing 273&#176;, about thirty miles
distant. Camped for lunch at 12.30 p.m. Thirteen miles.
Hereabouts I distinctly saw a few yards from me a black cat
(domestic), similar to the ordinary house cat. It trotted slowly
off into some mulga. Left again 10 p.m. same bearing. Red sand
ridges much lower and farther apart. Spinifex and desert gums,
few acacia, quondong, and patches of dry grass where the country
has been burnt. Camped at 4.30 p.m. on poor feed for camels; they
did not feed, being tired and sulky. Aneroid 28.200, ther.
80&#176;. Strong wind from north-west all afternoon. Few clouds to
south-west. Saw fresh tracks of emus to-day, but none of natives,
except old ones. No pines, which appear generally in jumbled sand
ridges. Travelled to-day twenty-one miles. Lat. 27&#176; 39'
0".</p>
<p>"August 13th.&#8212;Let camels go at 5 a.m., but they soon
made off easterly. Made start at 7.30 a.m. At one and a quarter
miles came upon old camp of natives, and found a well-beaten pad
leading to three rockholes ten chains east of our course. They
are situated at the head of a small watercourse coming from
sand&#173;stone ridges (low cliffs), and surrounded by dense
mulga. This was a most fortunate find, as our stock of water was
getting low. I will now be able to examine the country around for
a better supply. The natives have not been camped here for some
time. Rockholes would hold, when full, 200galls., 300galls., and
400galls. respectively. At present I estimate there is about
350galls., after giving the camels 27galls. Saw more mulga and
sandstone ridges bearing 227&#176; mag. from here; so went on that
bearing, at 8.30 a.m. passing over fairly high sand ridges of the
usual description, and reached ridges at ten miles at 12.30 p.m.
Had lunch and camped here. At 1.30 p.m. left with two camels and
Mahmoud Azim for low cliffs seen from camp bearing 315&#176; mag.
No variation of the needle here. Reached the cliffs in three
miles after riding through dense belts of mulga. Tied camels down
here, and going on foot examined outcrops of sandstone for two
miles further. Finding nothing I returned to camp at 4.30 p.m.
Noticed large smokes bearing 210&#176; from ten to fifteen miles
distant. Aneroid at 4.30 p.m. 28.250, ther. 77&#176;. Strong wind
from north-west all day; few clouds. Lat. 27&#176; 44' 54".</p>
<p>"August 14th.&#8212;Let camels go early. Made start at 7.10
a.m. on bearing 143&#176;, and at two miles reached a sandstone
outcrop with mulga; finding no water, altered course to 178&#176;.
At fourteen miles a high point 1,400ft. above sea level. Could
see for very considerable distance to S.E. from here, say, quite
forty miles, with sandstone ridges and red. sand ridges. High
point on bearing 180&#176;; sixteen miles, 1,350ft. above sea
level. Camped for day thirty-two miles. Country passed over
to-day of similar nature to that of yesterday. Can see some
distance to south and west from here, say twenty-five miles. Sand
ridges with desert gums. Saw few belts of pines to-day. Aneroid
at 4 p.m., 28.480, ther. 60&#176;; cold southerly breeze, clear
sky.</p>
<p>"August 15th.&#8212;Very cold night. Let camels go at 4.30
a.m. Made start on return journey at 7.15 a.m. following pad for
main dep&#244;t camp, now being four days later Mr. Lindsay
expects. Travelled twenty-five miles and camped at foot of sand
ridge on fair bush feed. Aneroid at 4 p.m., 28.310, ther.
70&#176;; calm, clear sky.</p>
<p>"August 16th.&#8212;Let camels go at 4,30 a.m. Followed pad
bearing 20&#176;, var. 1&#176;, travelling about twenty-two miles.
I reached a small patch of good feed (waterbush), and determined
to camp at 3.45 p.m. Aneroid at 4 p.m., 28.510, ther. 76&#176;;
clear sky, slight south-west breeze.</p>
<p>"August 17th.&#8212;Very cold and windy night. Let camels go
at 4 a.m. Started at 7.5; still along pad for three miles: then
on bearing 20&#176; until again struck the pad at eight miles at
8.30 p.m. We had travelled twenty-six miles and camped on fair
bush. Aneroid at 4.30 p.m., 28.415, ther. 60&#176;; cold
south-east breeze all day, clear sky. Noticed small patch of
waterbush at five miles to-day.</p>
<p>"August 18th.&#8212;Left camp at 7.15; still along the pad.
The natives seem to have left this part of the country. Travelled
on until 4.45 p.m., and reached our camping place on the 6th
instant, twenty-seven miles, Aneroid at 5 p.m., 28.825, ther.
60&#176;; cold south-east breeze, clear sky. Gave camels 5galls.
water each from our kegs.</p>
<p>"August 19th.&#8212;Let the camels go at 3 a.m., and they did
well on saltbush, myall, and acacia. Some of them are very
footsore from stony ground. Started at 7.5 a.m, along pad. After
a very monotonous ride of twenty-six miles we camped at 5 p.m.
Aneroid 28.750, ther. 70. Moderate breeze from east, clear sky,
warm afternoon.</p>
<p>"August 20th.&#8212;Let the camels go at 3 a.m. Started at
7.10 a.m., following pad to our outward camping place near Mount
Squires, in Barrow Ranges. Reached same at 2.15 p.m., and turned
the camels out on good feed (roley poley), which they ate
ravenously. Examined old fireplace, and found a tin buried by Mr.
Lindsay, with a note in it, which was scorched by a fire he
afterwards kindled to deceive the natives. Managed to read it,
and ascertained that he had found three rockholes in a creek
about half a mile from Mount Squires, bearing about south-east.
Took the camels and waterbags up to spot described, which is
three-quarters of a mile from camp, and, although rough, we
managed to get them right up, so that they could drink. The
largest hole had about 250galls. of water in it, and would hold
1,200galls. if full. Filled the casks, and returned to the camp
at 5.30 p.m. Bearing to Mount Cooper 83&#176; 30' mag., Borrow's
Hill 104&#176;. Aneroid at 3 p.m. 28.550, ther. 72&#176;; slight
easterly breeze, clear sky. Noticed to-day many tracks of natives
having been about here since our departure on outward trip. No
doubt there is more water in the vicinity of Mount Squires. Tied
camels down at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>"August 21st.&#8212;Let the camels go at 2 a.m. Started at
7.45 a.m., the camels having done well on the splendid green
herbage. Reached 32 (dep&#244;t) camp at noon. Reported result
of journey to Mr. Lindsay, and found that neither he nor Mr.
Leech had been very successful either in finding water. The past
seasons here have apparently been very dry ones. During my
absence I examined the country to a distance of 166
miles&#8212;including looking for water, 388 miles&#8212;in
eighteen days. Aneroid at 4 p.m., in camp, 28.430, ther. 73&#176;;
calm, clear, and warm. Height by hypsometer, 1,535ft."</p>

<p><i>Saturday, August 22nd.</i>&#8212;Breakfast before sunrise.
Ther. 36&#176;, north-east wind, veering later to north&#173;west,
and afterwards to west. Hadji did not come until 1 o'clock,
having, he said, lost three or four camels. He had emptied the
rockhole eight miles north-east from here, and was in a very bad
temper. Immediately loaded up. We were surprised to get 90galls.
of water out of the rockhole, but we left very little in it for
any thirsty natives who might come along. Reached Abdul's camp at
sundown. Camp 34. Max. temp. 85&#176;, shade heat; min. temp.
35&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.44, ther. 67&#176;; 3 p.m., bar.
28.35, ther. 82&#176;. Distance, six miles. Zodiacal lights
visible after sunset.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, August 23rd.</i>&#8212;Cool and clear. Strong S.E.
wind, veering to south. Mr. Wells and I went away to look for
water around Mount Squires, the caravan going on to the east end
of Mount Squires. After searching numerous gullies, at 11.30 I
was sitting on top of a hill waiting for Mr. Wells when I saw two
crows flying past. I watched them, and they went into a gully
three-quarters of a mile away. I then walked over there, and as
soon as I struck into the creek saw Mr. Wells' tracks. Went up
the creek, and found what might prove to be a nice little
soakage; Mr. Wells had been there. I then returned and waited for
Mr. Wells; he had gone back to where he had left his camel and
found the brute had broken his nose line and cleared, giving Mr.
Wells a mile and half walk before he caught him. We then crossed
a saddle, going west, and dropped down into the soakage creek. In
a short distance saw crows fly out from under a cliff; going
there we found a waterhole containing apparently enough water for
all our requirements. Two chains further down found a larger one;
quarter of a mile still down the creek found another, there being
altogether, I suppose, 3,000galls. or 4,000galls. on the surface
besides what is in the sand; no feed, thick mulga. Two miles
north-west of Mount Squires. We then crossed over southerly and
searched other gullies without success, but as Mr. Wells saw many
native tracks coming into Mount Squires from the southward on the
20th instant and only two or three had been at these waters it is
evident there is another water to be found. This water is most
providential, and I thank God for it. It gives us an opportunity
to have a good wash, which we all much need, and we can rest Mr.
Wells' camels, which really sadly need a few days' rest after
then: 380 miles' journey. We will now be able to make a favorable
start for Queen Victoria's Spring. We had a very long rough walk
amongst these stony spinifex and mulga clad ranges. I will send
Mr. Leech on twenty miles with water to let the camels top up on.
I am now satisfied that there is but little risk for the camels
or party in the proposed journey, especially if the weather keeps
cool, as it should do. The equinoctial gales due about the 18th
of September might bring us rain, and so help us if we are
unfortunate enough to find no more waters between Wells' rockhole
and Queen Victoria's Spring. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.43, ther.
58&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.38, ther. 72&#176;.
Distance&#8212;caravans, eight miles; I and Wells, sixteen
miles.</p>
<p><i>Monday, August 24th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 36&#176;. Ice on Mr.
Helm's oilsheet, and none on anyone else's, and the thermometer
registering 4&#176; above freezing! The camels did not come in
until 11 o'clock, and then there were nine short. The Afghans
said they had brought some from eight or nine miles, and the
others had gone straight on. 2 x 8 = 16/4 = 4 miles per
hour&#8212;simply impossible. I, Bob, Gwynne, Streich, Helms,
Mahmoud, and Alumgool took twenty-nine camels to water, and
brought back six pairs of casks full. The camels nearly emptied
the top hole, they were so thirsty, <i>having been twenty-four
days without water</i>&#8212;what splendid training for the
desert march! Five and a half miles to the water; very rough
track. We reached camp at 6.35. Found Hadji had not long returned
with the missing camels. Cool day. Let all the camels go, except
those that had no water. Mr. Wells' riding camel very tender
footed; so is one of the bulls, who is in season, and continually
chasing the bullocks about over the stones. Min. temp. 37. At 9
a.m., bar, 28.51, ther. 53&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, August 25th.</i>&#8212;Ther. 40&#176;. Wind from
north-east, veering round to north-west; warm. Again two camels
short, which is dreadfully annoying. Hadji says there is very
good feed, but they want to make back for the waterbush. Mr.
Leech and Mahyedin took nine camels to water. Bob took the two
lame ones and watered them at the small hole near camp. I went
south of Mount Squires to run the native tracks seen by Mr.
Wells, and at 11.20 came on a magnificent rock waterhole in a
rocky creek, south-west of Mount Squires, evidently Giles' tank,
though not quite agreeing with his position. Mr. Streich and I
missed this hole when searching for it on the 5th instant. We
passed within 300yds. of it, but there was no track or sign of
animal or bird life in the vicinity at that time. Very nice
waterbush in the creek; I let my camel have one and a half hours'
feed on it, and then followed the creek down to see if there was
good enough feed to bring the whole caravan on to. Saw some very
well beaten kangaroo pads, which only led out on to little flats
with a little feed. The best feed I saw is on the creek in which
is the first rockhole found, and there within half a mile of the
camp is plenty for us for a few days; but as the mulga scrub is
very dense, and the ground dry and hard, we shall have to
shepherd the camels. Max. temp. 78&#176;; min. temp. 40&#176;. At 9
a.m., bar. 28.34, ther. 52&#176;; at 3 p.m., bar. 28.21, ther.
76&#176;. Strong zodiacal light visible for three hours.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, August 26th.</i>&#8212;At 8.30 Mr. Leech,
Gwynne, and Hadji took six loads of water away to fill up the
troughs some twenty-five miles on our intended course, so that
the day after we leave here the camels can have a top up with
water. Then probably, if the weather remains cool, they will not
quite empty the hole found by Mr. Wells and we can fill up our
casks again, which if we are able to do will make the 280 miles
to Queen Victoria's Spring comparatively easy. Let the camels go
all day and then tied them down at night to prevent trouble. Max.
temp. 66&#176;, min. temp. 41&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.48, ther.
50&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.40, ther. 65&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, August 27th.</i>&#8212;In camp. Engaged with
loading and plans and journals. A gale of wind blew from
south-west and south, with lightly scudding clouds. Tarring some
of the mangy camels. Max. temp. 71&#176;, min. temp. 34&#176;. At 9
a.m., bar. 28.53, ther. 58&#176;; 3 p.m. bar. 28.41, ther.

<p><i>Friday, August 28th.</i>&#8212;North wind; cold. Engaged in
camp. Eight native men, fine tall muscular fellows, came to the
camp. They were very frightened, but by cautiously approaching
them they allowed us all to sit down close by them. I gave them
each a red handkerchief, one knife, tobacco, and some dried beef.
They went away into the scrub and did not show up again. Reduced
our heavy loading so that when we leave here, except the "water
camels", none will be carrying more than 400lbs. weight. All the
dried meat now goes into one pair of bags and only weighs a
little over 200lbs. Of Mount Squires, Mr. Streich says:&#8212;"It
forms a small range for itself, being of different formation,
viz., porphyritic, syenite, and other feldspathic rocks, some of
them semi-porphyritic; quartz veins and lodes occur frequently,
but did not so far prove auriferous. Consider it not unfavorable
for metals, especially towards west, where surely metamorphic
slates and schists are to be found." Mr. Helms busy amongst the
plants. Max. temp. 73&#176;, min. temp. 44&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.
28.59, ther. 62&#176;; 3 p.m., bar 28.46, ther. 70&#176;. Faint
zodiacal light.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, August 29th.</i>&#8212;Clear, cold north-east
wind. About 9.30 our visitors of yesterday accompanied by four
others, came in sight of camp. They were again very frightened
and kept dodging about amongst the bushes, and ready to run off
at any moment. I gave them a little more tobacco and nearly half
a hundredweight of dried beef in a bag. I had picked out all the
coarsest and driest pieces yesterday and put it in a bag for the
natives if they showed up. They were very delighted, and ran off
with it, stopping every now and then to form in a line and dance
a very pretty dance, keeping perfect time with swaying legs and
arms. This was evidently a dance of joy or thankfulness. Mr.
Leech returned at midday, having la the water some twenty-five
miles down. Sunk the troughs in the ground and covered them over
with bushes. He saw a native, but could not get speech with him.
Everything is ready for a start to-morrow. I am afraid we are
going to have some hot weather. The camel Mr. Helms first rode
has been spelling with a bad back for about two months. I asked
Mr. Helms if he wished to ride it again? He said "No; he would
stick to the one he was riding, as he had now broken it in to his
ways, and it was fresh after the month's spell." Accordingly I
gave that camel to Mr. Streich, as his is scarcely fit to carry
him over a long dry stage. Max. temp. 76&#176;, min. temp.
47&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.56, ther. 61&#176;; 3 p.m., bar.
28.39, ther. 74&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, August 30th.</i>&#8212;"A lucky day for a start",
the sailors say. North-east wind, mild, and clear. Started at 9
a.m., and went to Giles' tank, leaving the loading about
three-quarters of a mile down the creek, in charge of Gwynne. The
camels took a very big drink, and most of them took a bucket or
two when brought up the second time. Filled our casks, canteens,
canvas bags, buckets, &amp;c., holding about 400 gallons of pure
clear rain water. This is the best water we have seen since
leaving Mount Sir Thomas. A splendid thing it is for the camels
to have such perfectly fresh water, and they must be in
magnificent training for a long dry stage, having had such short
allowance for so long. Some of them are poor and mangy. Am afraid
at least two will not go through to Queen Victoria's Spring. They
are old Boco and the camel Mr. Wells had out on the last flying
trip. As we are at once going on an allowance of two quarts of
water per man per day the pure rain water is a perfect Godsend
for us. We all had a wash. The hole is about 12ft. in diameter,
and holding about 6,000galls. I carried a billycan of water down
to Gwynne to let him have a final good drink. Loaded up, and at
2.50 headed for the Great Victoria Desert, not without some
anxiety, but with a firm trust in Providence and a settled
conviction that the course we are pursuing is the proper one. At
4.20, say four miles, we camped on the flooded flat of a
watercourse, on which were growing green acacias and other good
food for the camels. The day was hot. Marked a tree
<small>D.L./</small>36 (within diamond), a white gumtree, on the
east bank of the watercourse. Read Divine service in the evening,
as usual, a practice I have followed since we were at Mount Sir
Thomas. Distance, about seven miles. Max. shade temp. 81&#176;,
min. 48&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.41., ther. 61&#176;; 3 p.m., bar.
28.20, ther. 76&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Monday, August 31st.</i>&#8212;Mild night. Having had the
camels tied down (a practice I shall follow all across the
desert), as to be delayed by lost camels would be too serious, we
were all saddled up before sunrise; very cloudy; hot day; north
wind, veering in afternoon to west. Started at 7.16 over
irregular sandhills. At two miles we passed a sandstone range
stretching east, and away to the west the Tomkinson ridges,
evidently a continuation of this, are visible. Quartzites and
sandstones, 200ft. high; spinifex, mulga flats, a few acacias.
Country has a very drought-stricken appearance. At eight miles,
gravelly surface; at ten miles, limestone. Camped at 3 p.m.,
having done nineteen miles. We are now on an allowance of two
quarts of water per man per day; no washing up allowed. Each man
has his own plate, knife, and fork, which he washes with the tea
leaves. As I have decided to go into Fraser Range Station from
the neighborhood of Queen Victoria's Spring for meat and flour, I
will take Gwynne and send him to Adelaide in charge of the
botanical and geological specimens and the photographic plates,
thus relieving us of these parcels. I told Messrs. Helms and
Streich that I would send away the collections from Queen
Victoria's Springs, so that they can be prepared. By doing this I
will relieve at least two camels. If I can get two bags of flour
we can comfortably complete block A, and only be about three
weeks behind time at the Murchison. The Afghans' meat will be
finished this week, and of course our flour will go quicker in
consequence, as they will have nothing but bread to live on. We
have plenty of tinned meat (fresh), but they would sooner perish
than cat that. We have thirty tins of fish, which I will give to
them. Evening very close indeed; hot day to-morrow; I hope the
heat will bring up rain. After supper a big row occurred in the
Afghan camp between Hadji and Mahmoud Azim, about the water, I
believe. Most insulting and filthy language was used, and after a
few blows were struck Hadji rushed to the fire and picked up a
great stick. We at once interfered and prevented bloodshed. The
old man was frantic. I sent Mahmoud out of his way. A little
later Mahmoud was sitting quietly by the fire, and Hadji came up
behind him, jumped on him, caught him by his long hair, dragged
him up, and kicked him in the stomach. The other Afghans
separated them; we did not interfere further. A tremendous
nuisance these Afghans are for this sort of work. Max. temp.

<p><i>Tuesday, September 1st.</i>&#8212;Mild night; ther.
39&#176;. Started at 7.14, bearing 220&#176;, on Well's pad.
Reached troughs at 9.45. The camels had each one bucket (nearly
3gals.)&#8212;a few of the poorer ones two buckets. The 300galls.
which Mr. Leech had deposited here had by leakage (the canvas
troughs being new and touching the ground) and evaporation been
reduced to less than 150galls. Proceeded over sandhills, and
camped at 4 p.m. on saltbush flat, with good acacia and myall.
Kept the camels off the saltbush. Our camp is in a claypan
covered with gypsum, I think a likely spot to get water by
sinking. Camp 38. Distance, fifteen miles. Lat. 26&#176; 39' 9".

<p><i>Wednesday, September 2nd.</i>&#8212;Cold, clear night;
ther. 32&#176;. Started at 7.16, on same bearing. Country more
level. Natives' smokes on left about four miles; another much
further off; another far ahead on our left hand, and one nearly
ahead; also one on the right; a very big smoke or dull-white
clouds very far off to the north-west. Day was hot, with strong
north wind. Camp 39, at 3.15. Distance fourteen miles. Height
above sea level 1,100ft. Poor feed. To save water and bother with
the Afghans I have arranged to give Warren &#163;1 per week
extra while we are on the dry stage for him to cook all the bread
that is required; that means baking every day, which will be
pretty hard on him. The limestone disappeared early to-day, and
gravel and brown ferruginous sandstone were met with. A few large
white desert gums <i>(Eucalyptus endesmioides)</i> on the
sandhills relieve the eye. At seven miles crossed a sandstone
rise, 1,600ft. above sea level. Max. temp. 89&#176;, min. temp.

<p><i>Thursday, September 3rd.</i>&#8212;Camp 39. Clear; south
wind. Started at 6.50. Travelled sixteen miles ever undulating
sandy country; loose ferruginous sandstone pebbles. Passed one
low hill of sandstone, with pebbles very much waterworn. Mulga
and two kinds of spinifex, few acacias <i>(Acacia salicina)</i>,
quondongs. Sandhills are irregular. Fine desert gums lend a
pleasing aspect to the scene. At 1.40, as we were journeying on,
with a high sandhill parallel to our course and close on our left
hand I heard a whistle, like a native, who does it by an
indraught of air. Mr. Wells said "What's that?" and asked if
anyone whistled. No. Presently we heard another, and as we could
see nothing, asked if there was a ventriloquist in the party; but
almost immediately saw a native walking across an open space
100yds. ahead, all unconscious of our approach. Slipped off my
camel and approached the creature, who catching sight of us
seemed spellbound. As I came close to her, for it was a little
girl about seven years of age, she held out to me a lizard, and
was talking, but not crying. The lizard, a yellowish-brown
reptile, new to me, I handed over to Mr. Helms. Gave her some
water, some sugar, and took her up in front of me. Turned out a
little further on some feed, as this child will be able to show
us some water. We had dinner, the child sitting close by me,
eating such a dinner as she never dreamed of, quite happy and
apparently without fear of the strange white men. She is the
first female we have had in camp and the first one the doctor has
had an opportunity to photograph; she was much afraid of the
camera, and I had great difficulty in keeping her quiet. Mr.
Wells and I, with the Young girl in front of me, on Misery, went
away to find the water (kapi). In about two miles she took us to
a round hole on top of a conglomerate and sandstone cliff with
some nice clear water, how much we could not say, as the water
was under a ledge. The cliff escarpment of this rock is to the
south-west and has small caves and big holes. This sandstone
outcrop is similar to all others in this country, being crowned
with dense mulga, with here and there an open space covered with
spinifex and rubble, ferruginous sandstone nodules. No natives
have been here lately. A little saltbush in the flats. We began
to retrace our steps, the child again in front of me, being
clothed in a long shirt and with a red turban twisted around her
head. We had not proceeded far before Mr. Wells called my
attention to some natives ahead. The girl would not call to them.
We saw many black forms in amongst the bushes; the women ran to
the right, the men to the left into some mulga. I dismounted and
taking the girl by the hand led her towards the men. As soon as
we were well in sight, being on an open plateau, I let the girl
go; she immediately ran off, calling out and crying, When she
reached the men they tore off the turban and shirt, dashed them
on the ground, pushed the girl behind them, shipped their spears,
and made a dash out at us. I remounted quickly, and as they were
within 100yds. of us I fired my revolver well clear of them.
During the momentary halt caused by the report we retired a bit.
With a yell they again charged us in open order; again I fired
well clear of them; they were probably only 70yds. distant. Again
they stopped; with a yell we charged them at a gallop. A moment's
hesitation and the sight of the huge monsters coming at them
open-mouthed, struck fear into their hearts, and turning they
fairly raced for the dense mulga thicket, which we could not
penetrate. We retired, and they tried to surround us, setting
fire to the spinifex as they ran. Mr. Wells charged one bold
fellow on the left, and he took to his heels. As we were on a
nice open spot I dismounted, gave my camel to Mr. Wells to hold,
and approached slowly, waving a handkerchief, calling to them the
few words I knew of their tongue, every few yards sitting down
for a few minutes, Mr. Wells standing by his camel with his
Winchester repeating rifle ready to knock over a nigger if there
was a rush for me, or if I fired. After a great deal of this, and
when I had gone 80yds. from the camels, I got one fellow to come
to me; he had his spears. I gently took them from him and placed
them on the ground, quietly tied a red handkerchief around his
head. His eye was on me, and every muscle tense and ready for a
dash for freedom. I touched his arm, and he jumped away as if
hurt. He called to his friends to bring their spears, pointing to
his on the ground. I picked them up and handed them to him. Went
back to the camels, got another red handkerchief and a piece of
tobacco, and again approached them. They drew back into the
bushes, and some time was again occupied in similar manoeuvres
before they would come near. Eventually, slowly, and with halting
steps and much evident trepidation, a man came and was decorated
with the handkerchief. Slowly others came, until I had seven men,
muscular fellows&#8212;two of them being about 5ft. 10in. in
height&#8212;standing close by me. I had all their spears laid on
the ground. I accomplished that by taking the spears out of the
hand of the man I had just adorned with the handkerchief, and
laying them on the ground, pointing to each man's spears and
signing them to do likewise. I broke a. piece of tobacco for each
man, chewed a piece, and then put it behind my ear, as they do
their pitchiri (native tobacco). They grasped my meaning at once,
and seemed quite taken with the horrid taste. Another fellow
wanted a hand&#173;kerchief; having a white one on my hat, I
removed that and tied. it round his head. That seemed to please
them much. Again returning to the camels, having nothing more to
give them, and it being near sundown. As I went to the camels
they retired into the scrub. Noticing a kadnuka on Mr. Well's
saddle, which he had caught as we rode along, I took that to
them, and one fellow quickly came out and eagerly took it from
me. Thus, after about an hour, I was able to hold converse with
everyone of those who had been thirsting for our blood shortly
before. They all felt me and patted me, and expressed their
astonishment by a clicking of the tongue and slapping their legs.
A great triumph I think this was, for really matters looked very
serious at one time. I did not intend to run away from them, and
neither did I wish to shoot at them. We returned to camp. At ten
miles a sand ridge 1,650ft. above sea level. The day had been
cool and pleasant. Min. temp. 46&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.31,

<p><i>Friday, September 4th.</i>&#8212;Camp 40. Clear and cold.
Ther. 31&#176;, light south wind. Rob made a mistake in the time,
and got up at 4.30, lit the fire. and aroused all hands. At 6.30
we started up for the rockhole, leaving Warren and Gwynne in
camp. The natives had been there and lowered the water
considerably. We got 2lgalls. of clear water which we put in the
canteens, and got 72galls. for the camels, leaving a little in
the hole. Throwing the dirt out of this shelving (or cave) was a
work of considerable trouble, and occupied us until midday. The
camels were very thirsty and eager to get at the water; twenty
four of them got a bucket each. The geologist says of the
locality:&#8212;"The formation exposed there, the top of a rise,
consists in its lower strata of brown ferruginous sandstone,
changing gradually; a small band of rough conglomerate of the
same material, cemented by iron ochre, and top layer is composed
of a conglomerate of small pebbles and a kind of travertine
limestone (fresh water form). The whole outcrop is exposed for
12ft. to 15ft. high, and is very much inclined to cavernosity,
the conglomerate forming the roof of the eaves. The waterhole is
about 7ft. below the surface, being one of these excavations; it
has leading to it a drive of an inclination of 45&#176;."
Proceeding on our journey for seven miles, we passed over a
country which, though wretched as far as feed is concerned, has a
very pleasing aspect. Fine healthy looking gum trees; pines on
the sand ridges, which are few and far between. Sandstone table
bluffs; mulga crowned. Camp 41 on very poor feed for the camels.
Warm day. Heavy clouds to the north and north-west. A cool
south-east wind. Lat. 27&#176; 10' 40". Max. temp. 65&#176;, min.

<p><i>Saturday, September 5th.</i>&#8212;Camp 41. Cold, clear;
ther. 28&#176;. Having put our watches back 30' to local time our
start is apparently earlier being at 6.25. Still following Mr.
Wells' pad, the caravan going on, while I went westerly to some
cliffs, four miles distant, to look for water. Crow about. Saw
some native tracks, ran them and eventually came to a small hole
in a cliff. Was only able to get lgall. of water out by tying a
pannican on to my whip handle. This small hole is in the soft
sandstone on the face of the cliff. The natives (about twenty, I
should think) had camped here a night&#8212;the night before
last. Cliffs are of a white clayey material, 70ft. high, capped
by a ferruginous sandstone. Fine saltbush at the fort, and dense
mulga. Country very pleasing aspect. Groves of gum trees (desert
gums) in the valleys and sometimes on the sandhills. Pines
<i>(Thryptomene Maisoeneuvii)</i>. Spinifex everywhere. Very poor
camel feed, Heavy travel&#173;ling over big sandhills. Camp 42, at
3.45. Distance, seventeen miles. Day was cool; south-east wind. I
reached the camp just as the camels were being let go, having
ridden about twenty-seven miles. "Crossed a ridge of sandstone,
which is interstratified by layers of clay somewhat ferruginous.
The same formation exists four miles west; sample brought by Mr.
Lindsay. The surface cover is formed by marine quartz pebbles of
a quartz not found on the spot, probably the remains of an older
stratum, a conglomerate now corroded."&#8212;V. S. Lat. 27&#176;

<p><i>Sunday, September 6th.</i>&#8212;Camp 42. Cold, clear.
Ther. 19&#176; F., the lowest we have had it so far. Cold enough;
it is 13&#176; below freezing. At 8 o'clock an east wind sprang up
and blew strongly. Started at 6.22. Sandhills not so frequent.
Country still pleasing to the eye. Desert gums numerous. Feed
scarce. No grass. Valleys hard sandy soil. No pines. Saw fresh
native tracks and smoke ahead. I hope the natives have not been
camped on the water long, or Mr. Wells' 300galls. will have
shrunk considerably. As Mr. Wells said we should not get any feed
for six or eight miles if we passed a certain place, we turned
out at 12.45, having only done fourteen miles. The travelling was
not so bad to-day, but still in a wretched country. Camp 43. Lat.
27&#176;. 36' 10". An accident happened whereby 1&#189;galls.
more of water was used than customary, viz., Warren's yeast jar
burst. Max. temp. 73&#176;, min. temp. 19&#176; F. At 9 a.m., bar.

<p><i>Monday, September 7th.</i>&#8212;Camp 43. Ther. 46&#176;.
What an extraordinary difference to last night; north-east wind.
Cool night. Resumed our journey at 6.24. The natives tracks more
numerous, and going our way. Good travelling. Sandhills not so
bad. At five miles we reached the rockholes. Pushing our way
through the dense mulga, which crowns this sandstone height and
surrounds the rockhole, we suddenly saw a lot of native women and
children at the hole. With a tremendous yell they fled; I after
them on Misery for a few yards, when the open gully took a sudden
turn to the right, and I saw a mob of men rushing up to see what
had frightened the women. On seeing me they stopped. I "wishta'd"
Misery and dismounted and approached the excited creatures,
adopting somewhat similar tactics to that so successfully tried a
few days ago. I succeeded in getting twelve men to come up to us.
They were terribly frightened. Gave them handkerchiefs. They did
not like the look of the shining barrel of the doctor's gun. I
noticed one man call another's attention to it, and they one by
one sneaked off. One man I detained pointed west and south for
"kapi", but what good is their water to us? I intended tying one
fellow on a camel, and make him take us to water; but on
consideration it seemed to me that we should be dragged about, in
all probability, from one small rockhole to another and never get
enough. Better by far to trust to Providence and make a straight
line for Queen Victoria's Spring. One of these men had only half
a foot on one leg, the heel being in front, the other foot had no
big toe, and he only had one eye. Another man was a dwarf, not
more than 4ft. high, with a long, flowing beard. Another was
about 6ft. high, and a fine muscular fellow. The others were
average height, and all looked well nurtured. We returned to the
water and found the 300galls. reduced to 90galls. of a dirty,
dark, bitter fluid. Thirty camels had a bucket each, which, poor
brutes, though they were very thirsty, did not relish at all. It
was almost worse than no water at all, I think. This is a great
disappointment, but the explorer gets used to disappointments,
and must trust to Providence to pull him through the tight
places. There is for us no turning back. We must push on at all
hazards. We only made six miles farther on a new bearing of
227&#176;, because Mr. Wells said we would not get any feed for
miles if we passed that spot. Turned out at 3 p.m. Distance,
eleven miles. Camp 44. Max. temp. 89&#176;, min temp. 46&#176;. At
9 a.m., bar. 28.37, ther. 59&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.35, ther.
85&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, September 8th.</i>&#8212;Camp 44. Clear, calm,
warm. Two of the young camels sick&#8212;evidently a poison
plant. Gave them eight packets of salts each, and they travelled
with very light loads all day. The country has decidedly
improved, in that it is firmer with irregular sandhills, our
course missing many of them. All the bushes much greener. Some
nice green waterbush here and there on the hills. I went to some
sandstone country, but did not find any water. We started at 6.30
a.m. and camped at 3.15 p.m., having made about eighteen miles on
bearing 225&#176;, and having passed Mr. Wells' farthest at two
miles in lat. 27&#176; 44' 55". Camp 45 in lat. 27&#176; 54' 32".
There is a peculiar looking valley on our right, mulga and stony
looking. I must go there to-morrow to look for water. The day has
been cool; wind veering south&#173;west, west, and north-west. The
barometer fell last night. Camels travelled very well. Saw two
corellas. Max. temp. 78&#176;, min. temp. 50&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.

<p><i>Wednesday, September 9th.</i>&#8212;Camp 45. Ther. 35&#176;.
Clear and calm. Resumed our journey on bearing 225&#176; at 6.20;
shortly afterwards a nice cool breeze sprang up from the
south-west and then south. Rain clouds low down. Passed over low
sandhills with sand plains between. Spinifex, desert gum, and
usual bushes. I went westerly in the valley looking for water.
Saw good mulga country, loamy soil, but no water. At noon we
passed some old native camps. Country gradually changing. Camp
46. At 3 p.m., distance travelled seventeen miles. Lat. 28&#176;
4' 29". Height 1,300ft. Max. temp. 78&#176;, min. temp. 35. At 9

<p><i>Thursday, September 10th.</i>&#8212;Camp 46. Cold east wind
during night. On same bearing at 6.20. Good travelling, level;
more mulga and gravel plains. I was away again searching for
water. At eleven miles found a dry rockhole on a sandstone ridge
1,250ft. above sea level. Numerous old native camps. Searched for
other holes without success. These rockholes, at least many of
them, are not natural. On a suitable place the natives dig a hole
in the soft rubbly sandstone, which, becoming filled with water
after rain, becomes softer, and the cleaning out which is
necessary to get at the water deepens and enlarges the hole, so
that in course of a few years fair sized holes capable of holding
a few hundred gallons are formed. We saw some holes newly made
that had never contained water. A change in the country here
occurred, a big dip taking place, with sandstone cliffs on our
right, which I searched for water without success. Saw smoke
bearing 275&#176; and 210&#176;. Camp 47; at 2.30. Sixteen miles.
Lat. 28&#176; 13' 53". East wind continued all day. Cool. Fairly
good feed for the camels. Height of camp 1,100ft. Max. temp.

<p><i>Friday, September 11th.</i>&#8212;Camp 47. Cool, cloudy;
north-east wind. We all felt better, but very weak and queer all
day. In two miles the country became flat&#8212;a yellowish soil,
with a gypseous clay, like around the mound springs, and I expect
we will soon come to a salt lake. Black oak, sandalwood, myall;
good stock country. Splendid travelling; the camels walked
quickly. A very few low sandhills. We made nineteen miles to lat.
28&#176; 28' 0" on a bearing of 211&#176;, having started at 6.30
and stopped at 2.30. From the dip in the country and the high
white sandhills&#8212;freshly burnt country&#8212;a few natives
(three) and emu (four) tracks, I expected to find water. I
followed the tracks, but the only good fortune I had was to find
a patch of green waterbush. While Misery fed, I cut all there was
and took it to the camp, which I reached at dusk. Misery had a
good feed. Having seen a smoke not far off our course yesterday,
we steered for it to-day, and passed through the burnt patch. I
saw a smoke ahead, about three miles from camp, evidently sent up
in answer to a smoke made at the camp for me when I was away, it
being the custom to always send up a smoke after camping, so that
I should not pass ahead of the caravan. The camels are still
going well, though the feed is poor. Level mallee, poor spinifex,
white sandy country. Lot of this country has been burnt within
the last two years, A strong cool south wind set in about 2
o'clock. Heavy clouds all day; threatening for rain. I hope and
pray rain will fall. I still hope to find water hereabouts; the
presence of natives and emus is encouraging. One of the Afghans
saw a crow, attracted by our smoke. We are to-day half way
between Mount Squires and Queen Victoria's Springs. Marked a
desert gum <small>D.L./</small>11.9.91 (within diamond). The
doctor photographed it. I wonder if a white man will ever see
that tree. Camp 48. Lat. 28&#176; 28' 0". Height 1,300ft. "Change
in the formation, viz., nodulous limestone, partly organic,
afterwards changing into clay and gypsum, with an extinct mound
spring. The limestone continues for two miles, and after that
again sand in vast flats. Height of mound spring,
1,050ft."&#8212;V. S. Strong south wind continued to blow during
night. Lightning seen to south-east. Max. temp. 70&#176;; min.

<p><i>Saturday, September 12th.</i>&#8212;Camp 48. Night clear
and mild; light south wind. Having a strong idea that there is
water somewhere in this vicinity I again went away to have a
search. Had no luck, and came to conclusion that there was not
any water within a radius of five miles at all events. There is
nothing to indicate the presence of water or to guide one in the
search for it. I overtook the caravan at 12.30, having found some
old native camps, but no signs of where the natives had procured
the water. We passed through open forest, undulating hard sandy
soil, scattered spinifex, a little withered grass. Much of the
country has been burnt. At about ten miles we were on top of a
hill 1,100ft. above sea level, with big dark hills to the right,
and ahead sand covered with scrub and forest, looking very
uninviting. Here was a steep descent over sandstone and big
waterworn quartz pebbles; 150ft. lower was a nice valley, with
claypans and good bushes, a watercourse leading down the centre,
southerly. Then we commenced to ascend, and camped in mulga
valley, low sandhills. I think we have finished with the big
sandhills. About three miles back from the Camp we lost the
forest and had open spinifex plains, with belts of dense mulga on
our right, which we are having the good luck to miss; poor camel
feed. Cool south-west wind, cloudy. A few drops of rain fell here
Yesterday. Streich shot a fine eagle, which Mr. Helms is going to
preserve. Camp 49. Lat. 28&#176; 41' 49". Height, 1,000ft.;
distance, nineteen miles. "The cliff We descended is quartzite
grit on top and white quartz and lydite gravel underlaying. The
strike of the grit was east and west, the dip north-west, and
under 15. The rises to-day presented themselves very distinctly
as terraces."&#8212;V. S. Max. temp. 78&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.

seven weeks' supply of tobacco in camp.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, September 13th.</i>&#8212;Camp 49. At 3 o'clock we
were awakened by a slight drizzling rain. The sky was completely
overcast. Rose at the usual time. Cold south-west wind, heavy
clouds. At 5.25 we sat down to our breakfast, and at 6.7 we
started on our journey, only forty-two minutes to breakfast and
load up thirty-two camels; pretty smart work, I think. We altered
our bearing to 222&#176;. Crossed three small sandhills and then
slightly undulating open forest country, sandy soil, hard, small
spinifex, gravelly surface. The desert gums gradually became
less, and we had clumps of mallee, kurrajong, quondong, acacia,
spinifex always. Just before we lost the gums the country was
most pleasing, being park-like in its appearance. At noon we saw
fresh native and emu tracks going our way, but nothing to
indicate where the water might be. At 1 o'clock we were on an
extensive burnt country, with green grass (spear grass), the
first we have seen since leaving Mount Squires. Everlastings and
other small plants in blossom. "Many a flower is born to bloom
unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air"&#8212;showing
that some rain had fallen here a short time ago. The spinifex too
was green. The desert gums again came in. The camels travelled
well, and at 2.15 we turned out, having made about twenty and a
half miles, on bearing 222&#176;. Camp 50. Lat. 28&#176; 55' 14";
height 850ft. Heavy clouds this morning, with slight misty rain.
Cold south-west to south wind, rendering coats necessary, and
being as good to the camels as a bucket of water. We could not
have better weather for travelling, and if it continues I am not
afraid of losing any of the camels. We shall not give them water
for two or three days yet. Again some corellas were seen. Marked
a tree <small>D.L./</small>50 (within diamond). Var. 1&#176; 16'

<p><i>Monday, September 14th.</i>&#8212;Camp 50. Ther. 32&#176;;
cold, clear, calm. The camels ate very freely of the kurrajong or
ordnance tree. Started at 6.25 on bearing 222&#176;, the same
class of country continuing. Camels all well. My compass read
181&#176; on a true south line. At six miles we entered open mulga
and mallee, hard, yellowish clay loam. At eight miles dry grass
and broombush; country level. At ten miles came on burnt country,
with parakylia fairly plentiful; consequently we turned the
camels out, as this moist plant is as good as water, and the
camels deserve a day's rest, having travelled for fifteen
consecutive days. A spell day is rather irksome, as, being unable
to wash my hands, I cannot work at journals. North-east wind,
then south&#173;west; beautiful day&#8212;cool, with few clouds.
The travelling has been exceptionally good. Saw the fresh tracks
of two or three natives and emus, and passed some clumps of
mallee, of which the natives had been pulling up the roots to get
water. This mallee has a smooth bark, nearly white, and the
leaves are very much greener and more shiny than any of the other
kinds growing in the neighborhood. Mr. Wells walked the whole
distance yesterday; every one walks from two to five hours each
day. Camp 51. Lat. 29&#176; 1' 40"; height 850ft. Max. temp.

<p><i>Tuesday, September 15th.</i>&#8212;Camp 51. Cold, clear.
Resumed our journey on same bearing at 6.6. All camels looking
well, the little parakylia having made a most noticeable
impression on them. Passed over the same class of country, with
good coarse green grass. Then at four miles the bush improves;
good sheep country; hard soil; mallee, mulga, myall, broom, and
many bushes and shrubs, less spinifex; white, yellow, and pink
everlastings, and other small, beautiful flowers&#8212;Mr. Helms
is kept very busy amongst them; needle-bush, a few quondongs, a
little saltbush. At fourteen miles we emerged out of a dense
mallee scrub on to burnt country with fresh vegetation. A smoke
bearing 255&#176;. At eighteen miles came on really good fresh
herbage, and turned out. 1.25 p.m. As we proceed the country is
improving, and the flowers, shrubs, herbs, &amp;c., all show a
fair rainfall. I am now quite easy in mind about the camels all
going through, even to Hampton Plains, if Queen Victoria's Spring
should tail us. We are now 126 miles from the latter place. Mr.
Helms has gathered many interesting flowering plants to-day; many
new to us. I noticed the <i>Euphorbia Drummondi</i> and <i>E.
Pilufera</i>. North west wind; pleasant day. Camp 62. Latitude
29" 12' 0". Height, 850ft. Occasional patches of nodulous
limestone. Max. temp. 79&#176;, min. temp. 35&#176;. At 9 a.m. bar.

<p><i>Wednesday, September 16th.</i>&#8212;Camp 52. Clear, cold,
north wind. Barometer falling. Resumed our bearing at 5.55.
exactly one hour and twenty minutes after the fire was lighted.
Camels all looking well, and showing the benefit of the green
juicy food. No necessity now to give them any water out of the
casks. Same class of country, then few pines, mallee, spinifex.
Limestone occurs in small patches occasionally. Emu tracks going
west, three fresh native tracks also. Strong cool north-west
wind. At seven and a half miles sandy soil. Pines more numerous.
Fresh lowan tracks and nests, but no eggs. Desert gums again
<i>(eu. eudesmioides)</i>. At eight and a half miles lost the
pines. Acacias more plentiful, with quondongs, grevillia, few
kurrajongs. Wind west and then south-west. At 10.25 (ten miles) I
saw a smoke bearing 305&#176;. Turned towards it, leaving the
caravan to go on. One mile took me on top of a long low white
sand ridge, and the smoke appearing distant about seven or eight
miles. 262&#176; to white patch on high black range fifteen miles.
Think the range is only high sandhills covered with scrub.
264&#176; to west bluff end of same range. 279&#176; a round hill
not like sand, about twenty miles. At seven miles I reached the
smoke, and found only one native track. I then went 243&#176; for
a smoke which had just sprung up. In three miles I came to a
samphire flat with high banks of gypseous clay and mallee trees,
with the roots pulled up by natives for water. The round hill now
bears 274&#176;, and the bluff 248&#176;. Fine pastoral country,
but suffering from a prolonged drought. Reached the second fire
in four miles, and found it had been made by the same native.
Then sped on hurriedly to another fire, and found that had also
been made by the same man. I now turned south-east to intercept
the caravan, and passed through saltbush, cottonbush, bluebush,
black oak, rich clayey soil suitable for reservoirs. All
extremely dry; no signs of animal or bird life. At six miles I
left the good country and entered a sandy country again with a
few large sandhills, thick mallee, and dense mulga. Reached camp
at 6 o'clock, having ridden thirty miles since I left the
caravan, or forty miles for my day's journey. Poor feed at camp.
Camp 53. Lat. 29&#176; 23' 36". One of the sandhills we crossed
was 1,100ft. above sea level. A strong gale set in from
south-west, the equinoctial gales. Bitterly cold. At 9 a.m., bar.
28.63, ther. 65&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.73, ther. 51&#176;. Distance
for caravan, twenty miles.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, September 17th.</i>&#8212;Camp 53. South-west
gale; heavy scud, very cold. At 5.57 we started on bearing
230&#176;, and passed through open scrub, sandy soil; spinifex,
poor country, At two miles we crossed a salt water channel, two
chains wide, leading south; could see for one and a half miles. I
think this water&#173;course probably leads out by the claypan
discovered by Giles. Immediately on the west bank we found rocks
(schistose), quartz, micaceous schist, granulite, pegmatite
conglomerates of all these rocks, clayey loam (reddish color);
black oak, bluebush, and other good stock bushes; a very pretty
scarlet flowering bush; robin red breasts. Such a complete change
of country is encouraging, and causes us to hope for water. At
six miles we again enter sandy country, with mallee, acacia,
cherry, mulga, spinifex. At eight miles low, irregular sandhills
are met with, becoming closer together as we proceed, from five
to twenty chains apart; mallee sand flats; few desert gums. At
twelve miles sandhills farther apart; at fourteen miles closer
together again and much higher. At 11.30 I saw a smoke to south
quite close. I went off, and in four miles came to the fire; only
one native again. A smoke then sprang up a little farther on;
went to it; found only one track, the same man. Then on bearing
210&#176; about one mile away another smoke sprang up; off I went
to it to find that the same man had been there. I was so close on
the fellow that he did not venture any more smokes. At fifteen
miles, on bearing 125&#176;, distant twenty miles, a white sand
patch on hill, evidently the east side of a valley, as the hills
again show about five miles to the westward. Returned to the
caravan and camped at 2 p.m., sixteen miles, on good feed. Camels
still look well, and Hadji says "No want water." Camp 54.
Latitude 29&#176; 33' 25". Marked a gum tree
<small>D.L./</small>54 (within diamond), 17/9/91 (right hand
side). Height, 1,100ft. Mr. Helms found about ten new plants
to-day, and had six hours' walk to overtake the caravan.
Limestone and sandstone; kurrajongs. I rode Misery nine miles
extra. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.00, ther. 59&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 29.02,
ther. 66&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Friday, September 18th.</i>&#8212;Camp 54. Ther. 38&#176;.
Calm, few clouds. At 8 a.m. cold, strong south-west wind. Resumed
our journey on bearing 230&#176; at 5.55. Irregular sandhills,
general direction 290&#176;. Spinifex, kurrajong, desert gums,
acacia, cherry, and at five miles first grass tree
<i>(Xanthor&#339;a)</i> seen. Afterwards they became more
numerous. Patches of dense mulga in the valleys, which we were
fortunate enough to miss. Yellow sand. The vegetation is most
peculiar, and I am of opinion that water could be obtained by
sinking at no very great depth. Peculiar rush-like plants, grass
amongst the spinifex, few trees. Saw an emu&#8212;the first
living animal seen for a week. Very wretched country&#8212;sand
plains and irregular sand hum&#173;mocks. At fourteen miles
quondongs become more numerous. Yellow sand, brown clay subsoil,
rubbly limestone. At sixteen miles the hills are "jumbly
hummocks". At eighteen miles poor mallee, limestone, very little
feed where we camped at 3.25. Twenty miles, Mr. Helms collected
about fifteen plants new to him. Camp 55. Lat. 29&#176; 44' 45"
Cloudy sky, extremely cold south-west wind. Max. temp. 58&#176;,
min. temp. 38&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.95, ther. 53&#176;; 3 p.m.,
bar. 28.80, ther. 57&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, September 19th.</i>&#8212;Camp 55. At 11.30 last
night we were awakened by rain drops and the clouds hanging low
looked so like rain that we covered all the goods up, but only a
few drops fell. At 8 a.m. a gale sprung up and then the sky
became clear. We were later in rising this morning (5 a.m.);
consequently our start was later, it being 6.20 ere we got away
on bearing 230&#176;, passing over undulating country, limestone
outcrops, mallee, and spinifex, making a most wretched country.
At seven miles yellow sandhills about ten chains apart,
limestone, micaceous schist, and quartz. Camels looking and
travelling well, although owing to the spinifex and hills rather
slow. Mulga in some of the hollows. No tracks of natives, old or
fresh, seen to-day or yesterday. Desert gums continue, few
<i>Xanthor&#339;a</i> (or grass tree), mallee, quondongs, pines,
heath, and many shrubs and bushes, spinifex, and no grass. At
fourteen miles saw at about twenty miles to north&#173;west, all
sandhills, a fresh native track. Country again became more level,
producing little besides mallee and spinifex (five varieties of
mallee). Turned out at 3.50 on better feed than I hoped or
expected to find&#8212;poplars and kurrajong. Very fresh native
track where camped. Cold south wind and cloudy. Saw smokes ahead
to-day. Camp 56. Lat. 29&#176; 54' 35". Height, 750ft.; distance,
eighteen and a half miles. Min. temp. 35&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.

<p><i>Sunday, September 20th.</i>&#8212;Camp 56. Ther. 26&#176;;
clear, cold, dew. At 5.45 resumed journey on bearing 230&#176;. I
left the caravan to follow some native tracks&#8212;two or three
men, a woman, and small child. The tracks led about in all
directions, but after some time I got the woman and child's track
going fairly straight and followed them east for some miles, but
after the experience I had farther back came to the conclusion
that it was useless following them any farther, as in all
probability they are living on mallee root water, there being no
sign of animal life, and they have no dogs with them. At seven
miles could see about twenty or thirty miles to north-west level
sandy country. Cloudy, cold, light south to south-east wind; at
midday, warm, with light southerly breeze. Sandhills not so bad,
but still a wretched country; desert gums, mallees, few acacias,
grevillias, quondong, heath and spinifex, patches of burnt
country, no grass, grass trees. Camped at 3.20; eighteen miles.
On poor feed again. Fresh native tracks, and a smoke about three
miles distant on bearing 250&#176;. Amongst white sandhills. Camp
57. Lat. 30 5' 12". Distance, nineteen miles. Max. temp. 76&#176;,
min. temp. 26&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.32, ther. 56&#176;; 3 p.m.,
bar., 29.30, ther., 75&#176;. The eagle which Mr. Helms stuffed is
causing a lot of trouble; it is carried as top loading, and
sometimes gets a little rough usage. This morning it was
discovered that it had slipped out of the paper Covering when we
were covering up the goods in the dark, and was left out in the
damp.</p>
<p><i>Monday, September 21st.</i>&#8212;Camp 57. Ther. 34&#176;,
clear and cold. Resumed our journey on bearing 230&#176;, which is
direct for Queen Victoria's Spring; distant thirty-six miles, at
5.55. Jumbly sandhills, poor country. Camels still looking well.
At five miles a smoke bearing 283&#176; about ten miles distant.
At five became a half miles a smoke bearing 267&#176; about four
or five miles distant. At six and a half miles the sandhills
became less and lower, though high ones can be seen to west and
north-west. Limestone outcropping. At fifteen miles yellow sand
takes the place of brown, which prevailed for three miles. At 2
o'clock camped, as the feed on the burnt ground is better than in
the unburnt, besides which some of the camels are getting The
last two days were long and the feed poor. We have now been
twenty-two days travelling without a rest, and as it has all been
sandy, and a good many sandhills, the long journey is now telling
on the poor patient brutes. We should make within two or three
miles of the spring to-morrow evening. Emu tracks very numerous
on a patch of burnt country, where there were some green creepers
and herbage. Saw also the fresh tracks of a native man and woman
and two dogs, the first dog tracks we have seen in the desert.
Mallee of various kinds, some very large acacias, quondong,
heath, grass trees, rushes, numerous shrubs, and flowering
plants. Camp 58. Lat. 30&#176; 14' 5".; height, 700ft. Distance
sixteen miles. Max. temp. 77., min. temp. 34&#176;. At 9 a.m.,
bar. 29.32, ther. 55&#176;; at 3 p.m., bar. 29.28, ther. 75&#176;.
One of the camels had a very bad foot and I made a leather shoe
for it. Many of them are lame.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, September 22nd.</i>&#8212;Camp 58. Ther. 36&#176;.
Cold, clear, north-east wind. At 5.50 we resumed on same bearing.
Camels went on well. The shoe I made was a grand success, and the
camel walked well with it. At two miles we entered burnt mallee;
red clayey loam; good herbage and grasses. The mallee has been
burnt in vast patches a year or two ago. The fires must have been
enormous. At five and a half miles passed a salty claypan, the
shores or banks about 20ft. high, formed of crystalline gypsum,
overlying gypseous clays. Limestone appearing as we entered the
unburnt giant mallee country, which continued to the sixth mile,
when we found burnt country with young mallee 3ft. to 6ft. high.
Travelling much easier and quicker, for breaking through the
dense mallee is slow work, and tiring for the poor camels. The
sandy soil is hard. At nine miles white sandhills, with pines,
&amp;c. At twelve miles a conspicuous white sandhill bears
210&#176;, apparently about five miles distant, a black scrub
intervening. Smokes bearing 138&#176;, also 290&#176;, not distant.
At thirteen miles a smoke, bearing 187&#176;, only a few miles
distant. The sandhills here run up to a height of 350ft., in long
slopes, making them look in the distance as fine ranges. At
fifteen miles we turned bearing 197&#176; for the conspicuous
white sandhill, which is a remarkable feature in this country,
and which I am rather surprised that Mr. Giles does not mention
in his journal. We shall get on the latitude given by Mr. Giles
for Queen Victoria's Spring, and then travel along that latitude.
Very good feed on this hill top; as we go south the feed gets
poorer and the scrubs dense. At 3.50 having, we judged, gone far
enough, we camped on poor feed. Camp 59. Lat. 30&#176; 25' 48",
making our position twenty-seven chains too far south for the
spring. Height, 830ft. Distance for day, nineteen miles. We
should now be about five miles east of Queen Victoria's Spring,
and to-morrow is anxiously looked for. I am not very sanguine
about finding any water there&#8212;the country looks so terribly
dry, and from the absence of animal and bird life. Max, temp.
80&#176;; min. temp. 36&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.21, ther.
60&#176;; at 3 p.m., 29.00, ther.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, September 23rd.</i>&#8212;Camp 59. Clear,
warmer; north-east wind. At 6 the caravan, led by Mr. Wells,
started due west along the latitude, with instructions to wait
for me at five miles. I went to the "conspicuous white sandhill",
three and a half miles distant, on bearing 197&#176;. Low
sandhills, and then a gentle slope with quartzite outcropping
then a bare white sand ridge at the foot of the hill, which was
very steep and of pure white sand, like the sand of the seashore,
above which it was elevated 1,150ft. From the top an extensive
view was obtained. To the south. over a level-looking black
scrubby country, with an occasional glimpse of reddish sand, the
horizon appearing perfectly level and distant twenty miles; to
the north the horizon is more irregular, as the long rounded tops
of sandhills can be seen; to the east long black ridges with
hollows between, distant, say, twenty miles; to the west,
distant, say, eight or ten miles, is a long level black scrubby
hill, with white sandhills lying between us which extend
northerly but apparently not southerly. There are three pine
trees on the summit of this hill, and as it is very conspicuous
and visible, towering above its fellows, for some distance it
should be an important landmark and guide for future travellers
to Queen Victoria's Spring; white gumtrees in the deep narrow
hollows on either side. So far as I can see distinctly with the
glasses, say ten or fifteen miles, there is not a "white
sandhill" in view to the east and north-east; therefore I am
certain that we are east of the spring. Just as I overtook the
caravan one of the camels&#8212;the one with the boot
on&#8212;jumped up as if stung with something, and began running
around. He had two empty water casks on; these and the saddle
were taken off. Hadji administered the usual remedy, "cure all",
twelve packets of salts. The poor creature was apparently mad,
and was tearing around with Hadji hanging on to the noseline. We
roped him down, which was no easy matter, got a bucket of water
for him, but Hadji first wanted to dose him with a decoction of
sonic seeds which he hurriedly prepared. As we were administering
the medicine he had a kind of fit, and, with one convulsive fit,
threw his head hack and almost instantly died. This was the most
sudden death I have seen amongst camels. Just before I reached
the caravan the camel had been feeding, and was apparently quite
well, though rather tucked up, having been in season when we left
Mount Squires. The doctor said, "Urinic poisoning." It was a very
good camel, one of the Beltana mob, branded TE conjoined on off
neck and like 8E on near rump. We proceeded due west; shortly I
turned off to some white sand ridges on our left. Ascending the
most southerly one I saw "an open space surrounded by pine trees"
at the south-west end of the white sandhills&#8212;exactly the
view which was presented to Mr. Giles on the 25th September, 1875
(sixteen years ago). I rode on, and in one mile came to the
"funnel-shaped hollow", Queen Victoria's Spring, but, alas for
us, the magnificent spring, which we had come 400 miles to find,
had ceased to exist, for no water was visible. By pushing a stick
down the "natural well" of Mr. Giles I found water, but I am
afraid the supply will be very small. Signalled to the caravan,
which would have passed along fifteen chains to the northwards.
Turned the camels out at 12 o'clock, having travelled eight
miles. Very good feed&#8212;acacias and other good camel bushes,
besides some small herbs, and a small description of parakylia.
Some fine white gums and pine trees grow around the open space of
grass land, which is about forty acres in extent. We immediately
proceeded to sink a well, and obtained a small quantity in a
quicksand. Baling sinking until midnight we took about 50galls.,
and then the well fell in and we could do no more. When I and Bob
went up to the camp about 8 p.m. the doctor, who had served. out
a nip of whisky all round, made a very complimentary speech,
congratulating me upon having brought the whole caravan safely
across the desert for such an enormous distance without water,
and saying how well we had all got on together, and expressed a
wish that the amicable relations would continue to the end of the
expedition, wishing further success to the expedition. They then,
led off by Mr. Leech, sang "For he's a jolly good fellow". I was
surprised, touched, and much gratified, and replied, thanking
them for the sentiments expressed; also thanking them for the
manner in which they had conducted themselves during our trying
march across the desert. Told them that I would do all I could to
make the work as easy and pleasant as possible for them, and
again expressed the wish that if at any time they had, or fancied
they had, any grievance they would at once come to me, and I
would, if possible, give them satisfaction; if unable to do so
myself I would send the matter on to the Geographical Society.
Mr. Giles says in his journal the night before he found the
spring&#8212;"Before us and all along the western horizon we had
a black and scrubby rise of very high sandhills with a big hollow
at the foot." Then next day he says, " Ascended white sandhills,
an open piece of grass land surrounded by pine trees falling into
a funnel-shaped hollow. Scrubs abound beyond the open space.
Though there are many white sandhills in the neighborhood the
open space is so small and so surrounded by scrubs that it cannot
be seen from any conspicuous one nor can any conspicuous sandhill
(distinguishable at any distance) be seen from it. It lies at or
near the south-west end of a mass of white-faced sandhills, there
being none to the south or west of it." The above description of
Queen Victoria's Spring being such a true and faithful word
picture in every detail of this spot and the position agreeing
exactly with Mr. Giles' there can be no shadow of a question as
to our now being at Queen Victoria's Spring. We have now been
without a drink for the camels for twenty-four days, and will
only apparently be able to give them a bucket each to enable them
to carry us on to where? Fraser Range perhaps! Max. temp.
86&#176;, min. temp. 37&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.82, ther. 70; 3
p.m. 28.94, ther. 80.</p>
<p><i>Thursday September 24th.</i>&#8212;Mr. Giles discovered
Queen Victoria's Springs on the 25th of September, 1875, on the
seventeenth day of travel, his camels having done 325 miles with
one bucket of water apiece on the twelfth day. He found it a
veritable oasis in the desert, abundance of water and some game.
We on the 23rd of September, 1891; after a journey of 375 miles,
with one bucket of water each for the camels, in twenty-three
days reach the same spot to find that the spring had dried up.
Early this morning we were at the well, and by using the tent
flies and long pine poles, with broken boxes and bushes, we got
the hole down on to the clay bottom, and obtained a few buckets
more by baling every hour. By taking 40galls. of water out of the
casks we will be able to give the camels about 2galls. each
to-night, and then resume our journey to-morrow for Hampton
Plains, 100 miles distant, where we hope to get water. Having
seen natives' smokes yesterday and the day before, I had good
signal smokes made yesterday and to-day hoping to attract some
natives who might lead us to a water. To-day smokes are numerous
and close, but, none of the natives have come in. The doctor
photographed the spring, and marked a tree for me&#8212;a white
gum on the south side of the
spring&#8212;<small>E.E.E/D.L./</small>23.9.91 Camp 60 on north
side of the depression. Lat. 30&#176; 25' 45". The marked tree
bears 197&#176; 30' true, distant about twenty-three and a half
chains from the spot on which the observations were taken. The
well is eleven and a half chains on the same bearing. Longitude
123&#176; 20' 15", 836ft. above sea level. Variation 0&#176; 41'
east. Soon after midday the water supply gave out. The well is
now 15ft. deep and on a blue clay bed, which is dry, containing
no water. Mr. Streich agreed with me that it was no use sinking
in the clay bed of the lake, unless we were prepared to go 20ft.
or 30ft., to look for water. I am greatly disappointed, for this
was to have been one of my "dep&#244;ts" according to the
instructions, and I confidently relied on being able to make a
start northerly from. here, and now I do not know where we shall
be able to start from. We have already done the biggest journey
on record without water, and it is hardly to be expected that all
the camels will travel much further. We walked around the edge of
the open space, and found traces of Mr. Giles visit, and also of
Fred Newman's, who reported as follows&#8212;"Mr. J. P. Brooks,
of Israelite Bay, W.A., under date 25th August, 1890, sent a
communication to the Victorian Branch of the R.G.S., from which I
have abstracted the following:&#8212;'Three years ago Messrs.
Crawford and Pigott, furnished with camels, started from Moodera,
in the Eucla district, to find the Victoria's Spring, discovered
and named by the explorer Giles. Crawford's party returned
unsuccessful. They reported finding white sandhills 1,500ft.
high, but all attempts to find the spring were in vain. Last year
the Ponton Bros. went out. At ninety miles in a northerly course
from their homestead they came to a large watercourse running in
an easterly direction. . . . .Fred Newman, an intelligent Swede,
who has resided in this vicinity for the last five or six years,
has for the last six months been engaged in prospecting and
exploring. He has just furnished me with the following
particulars of his last trip:&#8212;Procuring a native who knew
the country for a distance of fifteen miles beyond Victoria's
Spring, as a guide, they travelled sixty miles in a
north-westerly course from Fraser Range to a rockhole, beyond
which the country got very poor, being a red sandy loam covered
with spinifex and thin stunted mallee bushes. At ninety-five
miles from the range they struck the dry watercourse previously
described by the Pontons; they followed it in generally a
north-westerly course for ninety miles through miserable country.
Small flats were found here and there in the bed of this dry
river, on which mulga and stunted sandalwood growing. . . .
.Though many holes were dug on the river bed, no water was
obtained, except where natives had wells; some of these were
ample for the needs of his party, while at many others half the
horses were watered at night and the other half in the morning.
Owing to the drought which has been prevailing in these parts the
natives informed him he could proceed no farther, as the water
all "Kakabooka", (dead), but at the west end of the watercourse
there was a large salt lake. . . . At what Newman calculates 135
miles from Fraser's Range they came to Victoria's Spring; he
describes the water as a soakage, not a Spring, about 12ft.
square; his thirsty horses lowered it to about 6in., but it was
refilled in about half an hour; it is surrounded by a small patch
of grass about 40,000 acres in extent, beyond which spinifex,
stunted mallee and poverty. Near the water were seen many traces
of Giles's party, camel dung, fires, tent pegs, trees cut by
axes, &amp;c.... Great numbers of emu came to the water. . . .
Newman saw great numbers of natives there. They made no secret of
being cannibals. . . . .He saw no children. On one occasion while
travelling up the watercourse he came on a native camp, at which,
judging from the numbers of spears and condys lying around, there
must have been, according to Newman's calculation, nearly 600
natives.'" Newman's description is correct, but there is
something wrong with the figures; 40,000 acres should be forty
acres, and a mob of sixty natives would be large for that
country. Max. temp. 90&#176;; min. temp,41&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar

<p><i>Friday, September 25th.</i>&#8212;Queen Victoria's Spring.
Cloudy in the east; warm. At 6.15 we resumed our journey on
bearing 227&#176;for a spring marked on the map. Before leaving we
obtained 3quarts of water as the drainage for twelve hours,
giving a total of 60galls. We have 120galls. of water in the
casks, equal to twelve days, supply. I do not expect to find any
water in the spring, which is sixty-five miles distant, but we
shall get out of the spinifex country and probably have good
travelling to Fraser Range. I have abandoned the idea of going to
Hampton Plains, as there is no certainty of water there; whereas
according to our maps there is a station at Fraser Range which
means an absolutely certainty. At five half miles the
"conspicuous white sandhill" bears 84&#176; true. A strong north
wind, with cloudy sky, like rain. Reddish loamy soil; spinifex,
bushes, grass. Giant yellow bark mallee, 70ft. high, 2in.
diameter, very straight and pretty. Hard clay subsoil; limestone
in places. At thirteen miles a deep hollow at foot of a black
range extending across our line of march. Large circular
depressions. At fourteen miles we began to ascend over a hard
clayey soil with quartzite outcropping. Large yellow bark mallee,
quondongs, acacia, &amp;c.; very poor feed. The top of the hill
is 1,100ft. above sea level. We then descended into a basin, on
which was good feed, but unfortunately a good deal of saltbush
also, off which we must keep the camels. At sixteen miles (2.15)
we turned out. Camp 61. Strong north-west wind, very trying. We
all feel it after the lovely weather of the last fortnight. We
seem to have passed out of the sandhills. Several times we saw
where the natives had been getting water out of the mallee roots.
We dug up some and got a little water. It is evident that a man
could get quite enough to sustain life. It is no troubles to get
the roots, as they are close to the surface and run out 20yds.
sometimes. Up to now I have, in consideration of the Afghans
having to bring in the camels in the evening, and during the day
often having to run back to tie broken nose lines, allowed them
2qts. in addition to the 2gall. per man per day&#8212;12qts.
instead of 10qts.; but now I have stopped the extra allowance,
and Hadji kicked up a row about it, refusing to take their
evening's water. Mr. Leech then called out to Abdul to come and
take the water or he would put it back in the cask. Abdul came.
Hadji complained to me, but I told him he must be content with
what I consider it right to give him. Heavy smokes north of the
spring this morning, and also to south-east and south. Max. temp.

<p><i>Saturday, September 26th.</i>&#8212;Camp 61. Lat. 30&#176;
35' 0". Warm, clear, all clouds having disappeared. At 5.15, just
as soon as we could see to move, having breakfasted by candle
light, we resumed our journey on bearing 227&#176;. At four miles
we were on top of a hill 1,450ft. high, reddish loam, 6in. to
1ft. deep, reddish clay subsoil. Few limestone nodules.
Descending slightly the soil became lighter. All day the spinifex
has been in but small patches. Dense mallee and other bushes. At
five and a half miles an extensive view was obtained before us,
over apparently level scrub country. To the westward similar,
with a big dip between. At eight and a half miles a rugged
granite hill bears 305&#176;, distant about twenty miles. Here the
granite cropped out, and a little cup containing water was found.
In the deep valley beneath us were three smokes, looking like
camp fires. Away to the west, under some white cliffs, a blue
smoke was also rising; also on our course some distance ahead. I
went to the smokes in the valley and found they were all made by
one lubra, going east. I then made across to intercept the
caravan on a big granite hill, making smokes as I rode along.
When I met the caravan I found that Mr. Leech and one or two
others had gone back with a camel for about 10galls. of water
which the doctor had found in a rockhole just after I left the
caravan. Mr. Helms and someone else had gone to my smokes,
thinking they were made by niggers. Spinifex, mallee, poor
country, but very interesting in appearance, and worth a closer
examination than it is possible for us to give it. A high country
extends away easterly with a valley between it and another belt
of high dark-looking country, like a range extending across our
course and away to the east, circling around until it nearly
meets the elevated country we have just crossed, some fifteen or
twenty miles to the east. At fourteen miles a saltpan on our
course; at fifteen miles we crossed a salt creek. The dry river
mentioned by Newman, and discovered by Ponton Brothers, about
which Newman says:&#8212;"At ninety-five miles from Fraser Range
we struck a dry watercourse seen by Pontons. Followed it
north-westerly for ninety miles through miserable country. Small
flats here and there, on which mulga and stunted sandalwood were
growing, and a poor scanty dry grass. Though many holes were dug
in the river bed no water was obtained, except where the natives
had wells. Some of these were ample for the needs of his party;
at many others half the horses were watered at night, and the
other hall in the morning." This creek (the Ponton, I shall call
it) is 75yds.wide; saltwater at 3ft., gypsum, red clay banks
10ft. high; large mallee. Decided to turn out, as there was some
bush on the north-east bank, and apparently none to south-west.
Strong north-west wind hot, cloudy, looks like rain. The camels
are still travelling well, and I have very little doubt that
everyone will go to Fraser Range without water, if necessary.
Sunk a hole in the creek bed and got saltwater at 3ft. I had a
good wash all over and felt much refreshed therewith; the first
wash for twenty-seven days. Heavy clouds at sunset, with
lightning in east and north-east. Camp 62. Lat. 30&#176; 44' 31".
Distance, seventeen miles. The rocks met with to-day are
"gneissic granite, syenite, and talcose schist, intersected by a
multitude of quartz lodes; splendid country for
prospecting."&#8212;V. S. Max. temp. 95&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, September 27th.</i>&#8212;Camp 62. The Ponton.
Clear and cold. Rose at 3.30. Breakfast at 4. Resumed journey,
same bearing, at 5 a.m. That was just as soon as we could see to
move off the camp. It only took us (eight men) sixteen minutes to
put all the loading on thirty-two camels. Travelled very slowly
through thick mallee scrub, spinifex, giant mallee, 3ft. in
diameter, 60ft. to 70ft. high; quondongs and thick scrub. At
eight miles yellow bark mallee and bluebush on a rich red clay
loam, having passed fluted or gimlet mallee, white mallee, and
black butt, which is a most useful timber, very hard, dense,
splitting very straight; the natives make their spears out of it.
At ten miles bluebush, saltbush, limestone nodules, clayey soil
(red, deep, and rich), many bushes; crows about, but no place
inviting examination; very little spinifex; dry grass in patches;
a gum tree with broad thick leaves on extremely long pendulous
branches; also a clean white-barked mallee, on which the bark
hangs in long thin strips or in bunches like
ribbons&#8212;"Ribbon-bark mallee" I term it. At fourteen miles
we left the spinifex and travelled over level red clay loam,
salt- and bluebush in mallee scrub. A really good country, but
suffering from a prolonged drought. At 2.20, having done sixteen
miles, we turned out on very little feed. One of the camels was
knocked up, and laid down two or three times with his loading;
consequently I stopped, and will give him a bucket of water
to&#173;night. All the poor beasts are getting very leg weary and
tired, and I cannot come across any feed on which to spell a day.
The weather too is hot. Camp 63. Lat. 30&#176; 54'. Max. temp.

<p><i>Monday, September 28th.</i>&#8212;Camp 63. Warm night;
clear; all signs of rain gone now; north-east wind. Resumed
journey on bearing 227&#176; at 4.55. Entered good
country&#8212;saltbush, bluebush, high mallee hushes. Crossed
Hunt's Hill at four miles. At seven miles, giant
mallee&#8212;5ft. in diameter, 80ft. high; clay loam; very little
spinifex. The whole country very dry. At eleven miles, low
mallee, sandy, spinifex, and some grass. At thirteen miles, left
the spinifex, and entered good country again. A crow or two
followed us for some miles. I wish I had the same knowledge of
the country as they have. The good clay loam producing fine
mallees. Salt- and bluebush alternates with poor sandy, producing
mallee scrub and spinifex. At eighteen miles, a small saltpan on
our right. At nineteen miles, edge of a salt lake extending as
for as could be seen to the east. We tried to cross it, but found
it too boggy. No feed on this side, so had to go on, and it was
2.45 before we reached the opposite bank, having made the circuit
of the western end in about three miles' travelling. We have
passed the Spot where the spring is shown on the map, and have
seen nothing at all indicative of a spring. The day has been hot,
with a strong. north to north-west wind. The camels have
travelled wonderfully well. The bucket of water which I gave the
knocked up camel yesterday has had a wonderful effect. As each
day closes, and no water and poor dry feed, I am more and more
astonished at the wonderful powers of the camels. Camp 64. Lat.
31&#176; 6' 7"; height, 1,450ft.; distance, twenty-two miles,
98&#176; in the shade to-day. Having been eleven hours travelling,
we were all exceedingly tired. I was very tired, having walked
and sounded the depth of the mud in the salt lake, every few
yards hoping to be able to get the caravan across. To-day I gave
permission for a quart or two of water extra, to allow each man
to enjoy his nobbler without trenching on their allowance, as all
were extremely thirsty. When the Afghans came in with the camels
at sundown, having had a long walk after them, as they had
started off in search of water, I gave them two quarts of water
extra. Poor fellows, they were very grateful. Max. temp. 98&#176;

<p><i>Tuesday, September 29th.</i>&#8212;Camp 64. Resumed.
journey at 4.55 on bearing 157&#176; for a rockhole marked on the
map. Country very good for travelling over&#8212;friable clayey
loam (red), bluebush, little saltbush, large mallees, ti-tree,
some very good flats. A splendid agricultural country, if a
sufficient rainfall. Patches of spinifex and scrubby mallees. At
eight miles, a salt basin. At eleven and a half miles we were on
top of a hill covered with limestone rubble, with a range ahead.
Having been sultry and cloudy at starting, it is now cool.
North-west wind. Cloudy; looking like rain. A beautiful change,
which refreshes and invigorates both man and beast. We gathered
some green herbage as we passed along. At 12.45 (fifteen miles),
in a fine flat, we found a good deal of a narrow, round,
thick-leaf acacia, of which the camels seemed. very fond; so
turned out. We passed a granite outcrop in a hollow, but only
shallow surface holes. We saw where natives had very recently
taken water out of mallee roots, leaving the bark vessel into
which it had drained lying on the top of a heap of broken roots.
Camp 65. Lat. 31&#176; 17' 0". Height 1,100ft. Max. temp. 70&#176;,

<p><i>Wednesday, September 30th.</i>&#8212;Camp 65. Cold, clear
night. Camels had very good feed last evening. At 5 resumed our
journey on bearing 157&#176; over a poorer country; a great deal
of bush and undergrowth; loose red clay. From top of a hill up a
tree could see Fraser Range. At 9.30, eleven miles, a hill bears
178&#176;, and Fraser Range 190&#176;. At thirteen miles we crossed
a limestone hill, stopped for one quarter of an hour on some
green feed. At 12.45 turned out on what I thought was a good
green herb, but finding that it was not the kind the camels liked
we moved on again at 1.5. Hills, samphire, and saltbush flat like
a watercourse was crossed at fourteen miles. At 2.45, sixteen
miles, we turned out for the day on poor bushes, but I could see
the camels had had quite enough for the day and I must be very
careful not to let them knock up. At least twice every day I
stand and let the whole caravan pass me, carefully noting each
camel to see how it is doing. The day has been cool and they are
all travelling wonderfully well. My riding camel, Misery, is very
shaky. If there were good feed the camels would do much better
and we could Possibly do longer stages. Clouds in west and
south-west look very like rain. I wish it would come and relieve
the camels' sufferings and my anxiety. Gneissic granite, quartz,
and conglomerate again to-day with the limestone rubble very
abundant. Camp 66. Lat. 31&#176; 30' 45". Distance, sixteen miles.
At 9 a.m., bar. 28.90; 3 p.m., bar. 28.77.</p>
<p><b><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>October, 1891]</b></p>
<p><i>Thursday, October 1st.</i>&#8212;Camp 66. A few drops of
rain fell, but not sufficient to repay us for the trouble of
covering up the goods. Clear morning. At 4.55 we again moved on
on bearing of 195&#176; now for Fraser Range. At 1 p.m. camped,
having made about sixteen miles. The country on the whole very
good, but a great deal of fallen timber and thickets of bushes
and clumps of trees make the route so circuitous that a good many
more miles were actually travelled. We were camped on some green
herbage. Fraser Range not in sight yet, owing to the high mallee
forest we are in, although I caught a glimpse of it from a tree
top this morning right on our bearing. Camp 67. Lat. 31&#176; 44'
3". Distance, fifteen miles. Although we are within nine miles of
the position assigned to Dempster's station on the map, there is
absolutely no sign of any white men or stock. The country is too
thick for stock.</p>
<p><i>Friday, October 2nd.</i>&#8212;Camp 67. Clear and cold. At
4.45 resumed journey over the same class of country, but at ten
miles we were on top of a long elevation, and through the giant
mallee we had at last a distinct view of Fraser Range, some eight
miles distant. Altered our bearing to 210&#176; for the highest
hill, and at nine miles struck a sheep-proof wire fence just at
the foot of the hill, and fortunately splendid camel food, fresh
young saltbush, quondongs, acacias, sandalwood, &amp;c. For the
eight miles we had been passing through dense thickets of mallee,
with occasional patches of saltbush, and saw a few old horse and
cattle tracks. Here there are plenty of old horse and sheep pads,
but nothing fresh; and from the dry state of the country, I am
almost afraid that the station is abandoned; but the wire fence
shows us there has been a station, and we shall get a drink, if
nothing more. A number of crows about is a sure sign of water.
Mr. Wells rode across about a mile into the thicket to a smoke,
but the natives had gone. The dog Edward went over the hills and
came back with his feet wet, showing there was water near. After
dinner Leech, Streich, and I set out to climb the hill just
inside the fence. We found a fine masonry dam in one of the
gullies, with perhaps 80galls. of dirty water in it; this is
where Edward had been. From this dam a well-beaten dray track led
around the east side of the hills, going south-westerly. No fresh
tracks on it, except of three native women. We followed the road
at a good sharp pace, passed a new reservoir, a tank excavated at
the mouth of a fine valley. Still on. Having gone about five
miles along the road we saw some smokes in the forest, and heard
some natives calling out. I replied, and leaving the road we
quickly and cautiously stole upon four women, who, though much
astonished at our appearance, were not afraid. They could not
speak English, but were familiar with white men. Very wretched
creatures they were; two were old, Wizened up, and two were quite
young, but about the most wretched specimens of Australian native
I have ever seen. They each have a young child. One cannot be
surprised at the smallness and wretched appearance of these
aborigines when the nature of the country which supports them is
taken into consideration. A great scarcity of
water&#8212;absolutely no animal or bird life; they must live on
grubs, white ants, roots, and lizards. Questioning these natives
about water and white men, they answered in the affirmative, and
off we set through the forest to cut the road again. They
followed us as fast as they could, with their babes in bark
trays, swung to their shoulders by mallee bark rope. We each took
a baby; the one I had being about three months old, and lay on
its back very comfortably in the mallee bark tray. In about two
miles a cold drizzling rain came on. It was now dark, and the
lubras camped among some bushes, having made fires with the
firesticks they were carrying. Black-fellows, especially the
women, always carry firesticks, when moving about, for the
purpose of signalling, burning out game, or for the camp fire. A
short distance farther and we saw lights advancing around the
point of a hill, and could hear the merry chatter of the natives
as they came. When we got quite close to them, they not seeing
us, I spoke; they threw down their firesticks and fled like
startled deer, some in one direction and some another, and all
was silence and darkness again. I picked up a firestick, and soon
saw others advancing. When we got near them, I spoke; they,
having seen the firesticks approaching, were not afraid, but much
astonished to see four white men. These Proved to be the station
natives, and told us that two white men, Bob and Cherry, also
ponies and nanny-goats (sheep), sat down and plenty gabi (water.)
Just previously we had heard the tinkle of a horse bell, and I
thought I could make out some fresh sheep tracks on the road, and
knew we were right for water. At 7 o'clock we knocked at the door
of a big stone hut, which was opened to us, and the two old men
gazed with wonder at us. I informed them who we were, and that we
wanted water for our camels. They said they were nearly dried
out, but would let us have a little. They asked us no questions,
but put on the kettle and the camp oven full of mutton chops, a
supper to which we did ample justice. The long walk in the cold
bracing south-west wind had sharpened our appetites. What an
intense feeling of relief it was to know that we had all reached
water safely! The strain on me was removed, and for a few moments
I felt like collapsing. We had walked between ten and twelve
miles, though by road to the camp it was only eight miles, too
far to go back to-night, so after a long talk and a glance at
some papers as late as August, we lay down to rest, but not to
sleep much, on some sheepskins. We were told that twenty-five
miles north&#173;east of the station there was a fine "gnamer"
rockhole and well of good water, at which we were welcome to
camp, there being no stock out there. The camp 68 was in latitude
31&#176; 57' 44"; the distance travelled seventeen and a half
miles. The man in charge of the station, Bob Bryce, said we could
have as many sheep as we wanted and four bags of flour.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, October 3rd.</i>&#8212;Before 5 o'clock on a cold
and bleak morning we were on the road back to the camp with the
good news. Reached the camp at 7 a.m. The other members of the
party had sat up till 9 o'clock the night before wondering what
had become of us. We had breakfast, saddled up the camels and
proceeded to the station, leaving Wells, Streich, and Warren in
camp. The knocked-up camel had managed to reach the camp half an
hour after us yesterday, one of the Afghans having stayed with
him, and he just managed to reach the water to-day. The poor
brutes were very patient, but looked with longing eyes at the
full trough, to which we would not let them go. Gave them 6galls.
each, as much as could be spared, and as much as I cared about
the camels having, for more might have been dangerous. This is
the thirty-fifth day from Mount Squires, 536 miles, over a
terrible country&#8212;sandhills and spinifex, dense mallee
scrubs, forests, and thickets; and all the water the camels have
had is 3galls. on the second day, 2&#189;galls. on the eighth
day, and 2&#189;galls. on the twenty-fifth day at Queen
Victoria's Spring&#8212;a total of 8galls. each. We have brought
all the camels and all the loading and equipment through. We are
proud of our camels and of the journey accomplished. So far as I
know it is a record journey&#8212;certainly for Australia, the
next best being Mr. E. Giles in 1875&#8212;325 miles in seventeen
days with 3galls. of water each on the twelfth day. Ours was
nearly double. It was actually so in point of time, and my riding
camel, Misery, had carried me over seventy miles extra, making
for him 600 miles. We had dinner, killed two sheep, and took one
live one back to the camp with us, where we again turned out. We
left the knocked-up camel in one of the paddocks with two cow
camels belonging to the station, the men promising that he should
have water whenever he came in for it. The live sheep was tied up
to a tree, and contrived to get loose and lost himself in the
scrub. We took two natives out from the station to show us the
well and rockhole. These ranges are of hornblendic schist; nicely
grassed valleys, good saltbush, and other edible bushes; mallee
forests. At camp 68.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, October 4th.</i>&#8212;Camp 68. Loaded up and set
out north-easterly along a dray track for Symons' Hill Well. We
reached the rockhole in seventeen miles, over good stock country,
reddish sandy loam. This rockhole has been enlarged by blasting,
and contains about 7,000galls. now, although it is capable of
holding, roughly, about 15,000galls. The hole is closely covered
with long mallee poles to keep out birds or animals. The water is
clear, pure, and good, but not so good as the Mount Squires
water, of which we had 40galls. in the casks yesterday. Very fair
bush feed, but very dry, for this country is also suffering from
a drought. Pitched a permanent camp, and made ourselves as
comfortable as possible. Gave the camels 6galls. each. Dr. Elliot
hurt his foot to-day through slipping On a stone as he was about
to mount. Mr. Bryce very kindly promised to send a blackboy with
our despatches and telegrams to Esperance Bay, as they could not
lend me horses to go in. All busy letter-writing, Wells and I
till late at night. The camels can have free access to the water
to-morrow. Camp 69. Lat., 31&#176; 50' 56"; height, 1,213ft.;
var., 0&#176; 38' W.</p>
<p><i>Monday, October 5th.</i>&#8212;Camp 69. Symons' Hill
rockhole. Clear, cold; east wind. All busy writing. The camels
had as much water as they desired, some taking 20galls. right off
and presently returned for more.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, October 6th.</i>&#8212;Dep&#244;t No. 3. Camp 69.
Symons' Hill well. Cold; light rain. Abdul started early for the
station for sheep. I left the camp at 12.30: In eight miles a
shower of rain commenced, and continued until I reached the
station at 6 p.m. Heavy rains in places, with bail. South-west
wind; intensely cold; light showers continued to fall all night.
To my disappointment I found that the native who was to have
taken our despatches into Esperance Bay, 160 miles distant, had
run away, and that there was no other reliable native on the
station. Mr. Bryce then kindly offered me the use of the two
camels at the station if I could manage with them, or, failing
that, two horses (the only two they had). I thanked them
heartily, and said I would take the camels.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, October 7th.</i>&#8212;When the two station
camels came in. I was astonished to see how fat they were. They
had not been handled for two years, and I had considerable
trouble to put new nose buttons in without any assistance. After
all my trouble my saddle, although a big one, would not go on the
back of either camel, neither would the pack saddles, so that I
was forced to abandon the camel notion and make arrangements for
the horses, which will prevent me taking Gwynne down. I will
leave him at the station and he can go down with dray as soon as
it comes. The day was cold, cloudy, and like rain.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, October 8th.</i>&#8212;Fraser Range Station.
Cold, cloudy, south-west wind. At 6 p.m. Mr. Leech, the doctor,
and Gwynne came in. Leech and Gwynne both suffering from
diarrh&#339;a, poor Gwynne looking like a corpse. He said he had
hardly been able to sit on the camel, and was afraid lie could
not stand the journey to Esperance Bay.</p>
<p><i>Friday, October 9th.</i>&#8212;Fraser Range Station. At
7.30 I started with two horses, or ponies rather, a broken riding
saddle, a naked native boy on foot leading the pack horse. I am
taking the boy under the advice of the men at the station, who
say that unless I have someone to look after my blankets and
rations while I am out for the horses in the morning the natives,
who are always on that road, will be sure to steal them. At 9.30
I had to stop and make a crupper for the pack saddle, as it had
been repeatedly slipping on the pony's neck. Had a pot of tea,
and at 10.30 saddled up, and passed Peter's hole at 12; ten
miles. At fourteen miles the road crosses a hill of hornblendic
schist, in which is a nice little rockhole filled with water by
the recent rains; some nice grass here, but the extent of good
country is limited, this being the south&#173;western extremity of
Fraser Range. At 3.15 we reached Little Jam Hill&#8212;twenty-two
miles&#8212;and turned out. The water here is in a rockhole in a
hollow. The natural hole in the hornblendic schist has been
enlarged into a tank by the use of blasting powder. Very
indifferent feed for the horses on the burnt sandhills in the
vicinity. My boy does not understand English; therefore he is not
much of a companion.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, October 10th.</i>&#8212;Little Jam Hill. Cold,
clear, south-west wind; heavy dew. The horses had not wandered
far. We were on the road at 5.15, passing through poor sandy
country covered with dense mallee thickets. At twenty miles we
passed the Clear Streak, a patch of open country. Watered the
horses at the tank there, filled our water bag, and pushed on. At
2.10 we camped on some good grass in a patch of burnt mallee. We
had travelled twenty-three miles. I walk some hours and let the
boy have a ride. No water here. It is nine miles to Big Jam Hill,
but the men at the station told me there would be no feed
there.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, October 1lth.</i>&#8212;Foggy, cold. Started at 6
o'clock. Same class of country. At 8.35 we watered our horses at
Big Jam Hill, filled our bag, and resumed the journey through
same miserable mallee country. Stopped for two hours on some
grass, and at twelve miles passed a sheep yard, and found the
country to be Bay of Biscay clay soil, but densely clothed with
mallee thickets&#8212;a most worthless country. The clayholes
were full of water from the recent rains. Twenty-seven miles
brought us to Double Tank. Plenty of water, but poor feed. The
tank is a clay reservoir. Horses and foals watering here. Fresh
native tracks along the road. Just at sundown four natives (three
men and one woman) came to my camp. I gave them some meat and
bread. Most miserable looking wretches; dirty in the extreme. In
all my wanderings in Australia I have never seen dirtier or more
miserable specimens of humanity than these. They slept at my
fire, which I thought was the safest place to have them, as I
could keep an eye on them. They had a bark tray full of white
ants, which I tasted and found very insipid. The addition of
pepper and salt would, I have no doubt, render them very
palatable. They also had the bark of a. tree root, which had a
peculiar glutinous taste. I should not think there is much
nourishment in that&#8212;it seemed too woody&#8212;but I suppose
it gives the digestive organs something to work at.</p>
<p><i>Monday, October 12th.</i>&#8212;Cold, clear, foggy. Had to
tie the horses up last night, as some others came in to drink,
and mine made off after them and would not content themselves.
Started at 5.50. At six miles passed a small salt lake, amongst
irregular white sandhills, dense mallee, and bushes. No feed of
any description. At thirteen miles, having passed two other salt
lakes, we came to a deep well. No feed. Again we stopped on a
burnt patch to let the horses have a mid-day feed. Can see Mount
Ridley, which we reached at 4.25. Here there is a small paddock
(wire fence) to keep sheep in when travelling to or from Fraser
Range, as the mallee scrub is full of the mallock poison, and the
hill has a great deal of the heart leaf (poison), both very
deadly to animals. Some wheat was struggling for an existence in
an enclosure. Very fair crop is usually grown here, but this year
has been too dry. Mount Ridley is of granite, and about 800ft.
above sea level. I ascended it and had an extensive view, which
must have been a very disheartening one to the explorer who first
climbed this hill (Mr. A. Forrest, I think.) From south round
west north to east a level line of mallee scrub. Two bold, bare
hills to the east, a few to the south, those on the seacoast
being visible. Numerous salt lakes are scattered about; the
dazzling whiteness of their salty surface breaks the monotonous
black of the mallee. The water is obtained in a well about 3ft.
deep in black mould&#8212;evidently a spring, and, I believe,
permanent, although not a large supply. Mr. Dempster has erected
a whip and iron troughs. Some very nice sheoaks in the paddock.
Magpies (the first seen in Western Australia) were numerous, and
their sweet, familiar notes sounded very homelike; so too was the
scent of the wattle blossoms. Not very long ago, I believe, a
black-fellow killed a white man who was camped here, travelling
alone. A large party of natives had camped here last night, and
gone off into the scrub this morning.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, October 13th.</i>&#8212;Cold, clear, heavy dew.
Mount Ridley. On the road again at 6.15. Poor, level, white sandy
country, with thickets of whipstick mallee; salt lakes. Stopped
one and a half hours for dinner and to allow the horses to have a
feed, when we again pushed on for Jennapulup, thirty miles, which
we reached at 3.50. Met here two white men&#8212;one going out to
Fraser Range for the horses that are running there, and the other
a Mr. Sinclair, who has a contract for sinking reservoirs on the
Fraser Range station. He had a springcart and three horses. I
arranged with him to bring Gwynne and Hadji, with all the
collections made by the scientists, to Esperance Bay as soon as I
returned to Fraser Range. I found that the name of Fraser Range
is "Orrallinna"; 69 camp, "Wumbinna"; Symons' Hill,
"Kulladunya".</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, October 14th.</i>&#8212;Junnapulup, a ti-tree
creek, with salt water, but on the rocks and in the crevices
rainwater is to be found in limited quantities. Cold, clear,
heavy dew. Started at 6 a.m., and travelled over the "sand
plains", being white sand undulations, covered with low shrubs,
amongst which sheep can find a living. The whole country is
covered with most lovely flowers; every bush is covered with
bloom&#8212;quite a paradise for the botanist. I could not help
gathering some of the forms that were new to me, and only
regretted that I had not the means to make and preserve a
collection. I shall take a few back for Mr. Helms. At 11.30 I
passed the telegraph station, only stopping to send a telegram
home, which I had ready written out, and then rode on to the
woolshed, where I found the manager (Mr. Bostock), to whom I
introduced myself. He very kindly asked me to put up at the
station during my stay at the bay; I very gladly accepted his
invitation. I then, after turning the horses out, walked down to
the telegraph station, half a mile distant, and sent to the
President of the R.G.S. a long telegram descriptive of the
journey from Warrina to Fraser Range and of the country passed
over, and advised that I had intended proceeding from Queen
Victoria's Spring north to lat. 27&#176; 30', then north-westerly
to Forrest's track. "Impossible now. Owing drought can place no
dependence on outside waters. Cannot risk camels undertake long
dry stage again so soon. Propose going <i>vi&#226;</i> Hampton
Plains. Finding no water we will make westerly; if water Cross
Giles at Ularing, Forrest at Mount Ida, to Hope's,
<i>vi&#226;</i> Townsend station. From Windich Spring go
south-easterly to lat. 28&#176;, which would complete examination
block A. Please advise if you concur with this suggested route."
Telegrams were sent to His Excellency the Governor of West
Australia, and to Sir John Forrest for information about the
country. Congratulatory telegrams were received from His
Excellency the Acting Governor of West Australia and from Sir
John Forrest, from friends in South Australia and from the
Victorian branch of the R.G.S.</p>
<p>Numerous private telegrams were sent and received, conveying
the gratifying intelligence that my family and friends were all
well. A vessel was in the harbor and about to sail in a few days
for Albany, so that my despatches will reach Adelaide within a
fortnight; she will return here again in a few weeks, just about
the time I will be able to get Gwynne and Hadji here. Accounts
contained in the newspapers of the drought on the Murchison and
the North-West generally were simply appalling, and gives me but
little hope of finding waters in block A, and convince me of the
wisdom of the route from Fraser Range as suggested by me to the
Council, October 15th.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, October 15th.</i>&#8212;Esperance Bay. The
following telegrams were received:&#8212;</p>
<p>"From A. C. MacDonald, Hon. Sec. Victorian Branch R. G.
S.&#8212;Accept our sincere congratulations for successful
results of your expedition so far. Convey same to Dr. Elliot and
other members of your party. further details anxiously
awaited."</p>
<p>"From A. T. Magarey, Hon. Sec. S.A. Branch R.G.S.,
Adelaide.&#8212;Full reply to your telegram cannot be given until
after council meeting to-morrow. Please say where your party is
now camped, whether there is any urgent necessity for you to
return to them on Sunday, and if you do so, will it be possible
to further communicate you by telegraph. Are you sure you have
sufficient stores to carry you to first dep&#244;t at Hope and
Moore's station, Murchison river, where the stores arrived a few
days ago in charge of a man sent specially from here? Do you
consider it necessary for the man to stay at the dep&#244;t till
you reach there? Stores have also gone to second dep&#244;t
<i>vi&#226;</i> Derby. Are you sure you can safely proceed with
reduced party? It appears desirable to make up strength of party
as soon as possible. Is it advisable to at once send men from
here via Albany? How is Gwynne returning, and when can he be
expected here? Kindly reply to-day if possible, with anything
that occurs to you supplementary first telegram."</p>
<p>"From A. C. Onslow, Administrator.&#8212;I welcome you on your
arrival within the colony, and heartily congratulate you on the
completion of your arduous journey so far."</p>
<p>"From Stirling Bros. &amp; Co., Perth, W.A.&#8212;Proprietors
Inquirer and Daily News congratulate yourself and party on
success of expedition so far, and desire convey best wishes
concerning your future operations. Would be glad of brief outline
of country traversed. Reply paid."</p>
<p>"From R. A. Sholl Esq., P.M.G. Perth, W.A.&#8212;Have issued
instructions for you to have free use of wire Sunday 11 a.m.,
Adelaide time, to speak to your wife in Adelaide. Mr. Sinclair,
stationmaster, will render you every assistance if you will apply
to him."</p>
<p>"From H. D. O'Halloran Esq., Chairman Stock Exchange of South
Australia, Adelaide.&#8212;Stock Ex&#173;change of South Australia
express their gratification of the safe arrival of yourself and
party in West Australia, and earnestly hope that you will safely
accomplish the remaining portion of your expedition. Market dry,
like your journey."</p>
<p>I wired to Sir John Forrest, K.C.M.G., Premier, Perth, W.A.,
asking him for information about waters on his track of 1869, to
which he replied as follows:&#8212;"Postmaster-General will
assist you in every way possible. The spring under Mount Ida
looked fairly permanent when I was there in 1869, and was the
best place in that neighborhood. Two Springs and Dep&#244;t
Spring in same neighborhood not permanent, and nothing to the
eastward on my route of 1869 permanent. On my route of 1874 you
can depend on Windich. and Weld Springs."</p>
<p>I sent the following telegrams:&#8212;"To A. T: Magarey, Hon.
Sec. R.G.S., Adelaide.&#8212;Party camped at Fraser Range, 180
miles distant. My return is not urgent. Camels are on good feed.
Party has plenty water and provisions. No possibility of
communicating me after I leave here, as I purpose resuming
journey immediately on return. Will await here your pleasure.
Have been able to obtain stores sufficient take us Murchison.
Should think unnecessary man to stay at dep&#244;t. Probably
another Afghan will insist on going, as Hadji owes him
&#163;200; therefore should like if you can send George Lindsay
to Murchison. So strong was feeling against Hadji remaining one
day longer than necessary that scientific officers have placed
their services for work amongst camels at my disposal if wanted.
Can therefore manage to Murchison very well, having scarcely any
loading now. Sending men <i>vi&#226;</i> Albany would entail
unnecessary expense and delay. Shall send. Gwynne and Afghans
from here by wool boat next month to Albany. Gwynne will wire you
when leaving there. You will have letter in about three weeks.
The Afghans have not proved very good, being bad bushmen and not
first rate camel men. Had considerable trouble with them when on
allowance of water. Think gave you all important information in
first telegrams." In the evening a message came up from the
telegraph office asking me to go there at once, as I was wanted
to speak to someone in Melbourne. I went down and found Mr.
MacDonald and Mr. Panton waiting to speak me on behalf of the
Victorian Branch of the R.G.S. They asked me some twenty
questions, to which I replied as fully as I was able without
reference to my journals.</p>
<p><i>Friday, October 16th.</i>&#8212;Esperance Bay. The
telegraph station being half a mile from the sheep station, a
flagstaff was erected at the telegraph station, and when a
message was received the flag was hoisted, which would soon be
noticed by someone and a black-fellow would be dispatched for it.
The flag was hoisted very often during my stay, and the black
messengers kept going backwards and forwards pretty often. The
weather is cold and showery, interfering with the shearing, which
is in full swing. The only buildings at Esperance Bay are Messrs.
Dempsters' station buildings, telegraph station, and police
station. The bay is a very good one. Under a high sandhill, just
above high water mark, and nestling among shady bushes, is the
last resting-place of Tommy Windich, a faithful native servant of
Messrs. John and Alexander Forrest. The spot is marked by a black
marble headstone and enclosed with a neat, strong, picket fence.
On the stone was engraved the following:&#8212;"Erected by John
and Alexander Forrest in memory of Tommy Windich; born near Mount
Stirling, 1840; died at Esperance Bay in 1876. He was an
aboriginal native of Western Australia of great intelligence and
fidelity, who accompanied them on four exploring expeditions into
the interior of Australia, two of which were from Perth to
Adelaide. 'Be ye also ready.'"</p>
<p><i>Saturday, October 17th.</i>&#8212;At Esperance Bay. Soon
after breakfast the telegraph flag was seen, and the following
telegram was received:&#8212;</p>
<p>"From A. T. Magarey, Hon. See. R.G.S., Adelaide.&#8212;Council
conveys congratulations upon arrival of yourself and party in
safety. Glad to hear all well. Upon what evidence do you identify
the spring visited by you with the Queen Victoria's Spring of
Giles'? Had you Giles' description to refer
to&#8212;Parliamentary paper No. 22 of 1876, page 8, or Giles'
book, pages 188 and 200? Council surprised to hear that this
spring was dry in view of Giles' description. Council considers
it desirable for you to proceed with the exploration of the
remaining western portion of block <i>en route</i> to the
Murchison. Sir Thomas anxious for us to complete examination of
unknown country as soon as possible as you proceed, regardless of
time. Purchase of camels approved. Lindsay and Joorak will be
sent to the Murchison unless they can reach you <i>vi&#226;</i>
Albany. Can you obtain sufficient stores for the more extended
examination now proposed. Stores asked for will be sent. Council
meets again Monday morning; please reply before meeting and wait
further communications."</p>
<p>To that telegram I replied as under:&#8212;"Had both Giles'
book and Parliamentary paper. Certain of identity Victoria's
Spring, latitude agreeing within few seconds, longitude four
miles. We cut on to Giles' given latitude eight miles east of his
longitude; then travelled west along latitude. No difficulty
recognising locality, Giles' description of surroundings being
faithful. Were you not also surprised at Fort Mueller and Barlee
Springs being dry? Respectfully venture emphasise my opinion that
suggested manner of completing examination block A under existing
circumstances is best. Have obtained services natives Hampton
Plains, who will show me waters. If I can get water enough
between Hampton Plains and Forrest's track 1869 of course will
examine country to eastward. Sir John Forrest wires me he saw no
permanent water except perhaps at Mount Ida. The drought has been
long and severe. Vegetation dead, and rockholes rarely furnish
enough water for our large party. Men this year depending on
Hampton Plains waters they visited last year perished horses and
nearly lost their lives. Council may rest assured I will, if
possible, examine country on way to Murchison, but cannot
possibly go northwards from Victoria Springs; must do it from
west. Distance to Windich Springs too great, and country debars
fast travelling. Bought two camels Dempster &#163;30 each.
Manager Fraser Range says that country drier now than any time
since settlement fifteen years ago. Stock has to be shortly
shifted to coast. No use send men <i>vi&#226;</i> Albany. Can
obtain enough flour, tea, sugar, meat for two mouths. Shall be
speaking Mrs. Lindsay to-morrow 11 o'clock.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, October 18th.</i>&#8212;At Esperance Bay. Enjoying
to the fullest the free hospitality of Mr. Bostock, manager for
Messrs. Dempster and the breezes right off the Southern Ocean,
the roar of whose breaking waves is sweet music to me after the
long silence and solitude of the desert. In the afternoon I was
able to indulge in my favorite pastime, "a sail on the bosom of
the mighty deep", but we found ourselves in rather an awkward
predicament, for when on a lee shore, with a strong breeze and a
high sea, the staysail halyards carried away. The gear was very
rotten, and I had to climb to the top of the mast and reeve the
halyards through the block. As our frail craft rose to the waves
and pitched head foremost into the trough it seemed as if the
mast would go by the board. We ran back to the moorings in
safety. When Mr. Bostock caught hold of the moorings I started to
run forward to help him, but catching my foot in the sheet, and
the boom coming over at the same moment, I was knocked
overboard.</p>
<p><i>Monday, October 19th.</i>&#8212;At Esperance Bay. Received
the following telegram from the Council of the R.G.S.,
Adelaide:&#8212;</p>
<p>"Council approves your proceeding as you suggest, examining
the western portion of block A as far as possible on your way to
the Murchison. As you will no doubt start at once, we heartily
wish you good-bye and good luck. Kind regards to yourself, your
officers and men. Wire when you leave. Tietkins sends
congratulations to yourself and party from. Sydney. Mr. Helms'
brother Charles reports all well. Letters await him Murchison. No
change since. Please convey this to Helms."</p>
<p>To which I replied:&#8212;"Thank you; I will leave here
to-morrow. Reach camp in seven days. Then have to prepare meat
for journey. Hope leave Fraser Range about end of month. You
probably hear from me next from Cruickshanks'. Please send
Dempster Bros., <i>vi&#226;</i> Albany, six bags flour to
replace what they have sup&#173;plied me with. To former list
please add twenty-five pair hobble straps, 2lbs. copper rivets,
assorted. Letters left to-day; expect reach Adelaide within
fortnight. Inform me Murchison whether you require me to go to
Geraldton. Good-bye. Regards."</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, October 20th.</i>&#8212;Received wire from home.
At 11 a.m. I started my boy, Mickey, off with the Packhorse. I
started at 2 p.m. from the telegraph station, having wired my
thanks to the Postmaster-General, Perth. Mr. Sinclair, the
stationmaster, accompanied me some distance. I overtook Mickey
and three other natives who were going to Fraser Range at 5.30,
and reached Jenapulup at 6.45; twenty miles. Threatening for
rain; put up my tent.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, October 21st.</i>&#8212;Started at 6 a.m.
Reached Mount Ridley at 3.45 p.m.; thirty miles. Muggy weather;
thundering to north.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, October 22nd.</i>&#8212;Cloudy and warm. Rode to
double tank, where four natives, one woman and two children,
joined us. They were evidently great friends of Mickey and Kurdi
Kurdi. When they met they embraced, talked away at a great rate,
occasionally bursting out into hearty laughter. The old man who
was with us was evidently a stranger, as he sat outside the
circle, and never a word was addressed to him. Now and then he
would look at me and smile. Later, evidently, an invitation was
made to him to join the group, and the introduction took place.
He sat in the lap of each man in turn for half a minute, the man
embracing him, and then the youngest child, a boy 2 years old,
was passed over to him. He embraced the child and nursed it for a
little while. No introduction was made to the women or the girl 5
years old, but the two women sat together and laughed, talked,
nodded their heads, and every now and then one would lay her head
on the other's shoulder. The old man then joined the magic
circle, and merry conversation was carried on till late. Then the
visitors left my fire and made a camp some little distance off.
My companions Joined them, and a corroboree was indulged in until
the small hours of the morning. Thunderstorm to the
north-west.</p>
<p><i>Friday, October 23rd.</i>&#8212;Cloudy; south-east wind.
Started at 6.10, having overslept myself.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, October 24th.</i>&#8212;Camped at Little Jam
Hill, so called because on the hill a quantity of stunted
raspberry jam wood is growing.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, October 25th.</i>&#8212;Heavy thunderstorm and rain
last night. Reached the station at 12.30. Found Gwynne looking
well and quite fat. Dr. Elliot and Mr. Wells were over at the
damsinkers' camp, some four miles distant. Sent a messenger for
Sinclair. He came over, and I arranged with him to take Gwynne
and others, and all their packages and the boxes of specimens, to
Esperance Bay, starting on Thursday next. I was very annoyed to
find that Sinclair had taken three bags of flour, including one
of the four sold to me. Sinclair was excavating dams under
contract, and the station had agreed to supply him with rations.
He had brought in some fifty natives to work at the darns, and
had demanded the flour as his right, although Bryce told him that
he had promised it to me. This was extremely annoying, as I had
calculated upon getting a two mouths' supply of flour, whereas
now I must start with only three or four weeks' supply. However,
that will be sufficient to take us to one of the outstations near
Lake Austin.</p>
<p><i>Monday, October 26th.</i>&#8212;Fraser Range Station.
Started for camp at 6.45. Heavy fog. Reached camp at mid-day and
found all well. The natives who were to show us water at Hampton
Plains were still at the camp. Took stock of the provisions in
camp, and found we had the following quantities:&#8212;Meat,
tinned, 164lbs. (equal twenty days' supply); sugar, 100lbs.
(equal thirty days' supply); tea, 20lbs. (equal forty-nine days'
supply); peas (dried), 3qts.; beans, 5qts.; vegetables
(compressed), 14lbs.; flour, 150lbs.; salt, 28lbs.; soap, 6 bars;
currants, raisins, dried apples, and apricots, and a two month'
supply of food for Mr. Wells (viz., milk, oatmeal, digestive
meal, and maizena); maizena, 20lbs.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, October 27th.</i>&#8212;Bob, Abdul, and I went to
the station to prepare meat for our journey. There are two or
three head of cattle in one of the paddocks. I hope to be able to
shoot one or two of them, as beef will salt better than
mutton.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, October 28th.</i>&#8212;Searching, assisted by a
black-fellow, unsuccessfully for the cattle. Had dimmer with
Sinclair. It is an interesting sight to see the natives at work.
The ground is ploughed up and some natives with shovels, others
with their hands fill handbarrows, made with two mallee sticks
and a flour bag which two natives carry out to the bank. Old and
young of both sexes to the number of about forty are thus
employed. Many of these natives were, though small, strongly
built. Dr. Elliot has taken some interesting photographs here. I
decided not to waste any more time looking for the cattle. Rain,
squalls, cold.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, October 29th.</i>&#8212;Abdul started back with
two live sheep and two dead ones. Then Bob and I dressed, boned,
and salted thirteen sheep, obtaining 390lbs. of meat. Hadji, who
had come in, cut the throats of the sheep, or else the Afghans
would not have eaten any of it.</p>
<p><i>Friday, October 30th.</i>&#8212;Bob returned to camp. I
remained to look after the meat, square accounts, get Gwynne and
Hadji away. Sent message by Bob that all were to be prepared to
start on Monday 2nd.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, October 31st.</i>&#8212;Gwynne and Hadji with ten
boxes of specimens and a bundle of spears, which I had procured
at Fraser Range, started in Sinclair's dray for Esperance.
Mahyedin came in with two camels to carry out the meat. We had
some trouble getting nose buttons in the two camel cows, and also
in the old camels which had been running in the paddock for the
past month. Mr. Bryce told me that the way Fred Newman, who
visited Queen Victoria's Spring last year used to get about the
country was:&#8212;He had three or four horses and two black
boys, who would take him to the outside water in their country,
where they would wait until some natives were found who they
would persuade to take them to the outside waters in their
country, in the direction Newman wished to travel, where they
would again adopt the same tactics; so that there can be no doubt
he was at Queen Victoria's Spring, and that there was no other
water within a reasonable distance of that place. Newman related
how, when he was at Queen Victoria's Spring, some natives had
come in from a hunting excursion hungry, tired, and with empty
game bags, a fat little girl was taken away into the bushes,
killed, cooked, and eaten. Bryce also told me that a gold
prospector had, in the early part of 1890, come in from Hampton
Plains for provisions, and being unable to get any, had gone on
to Esperance Bay, returning in December. He had five horses and a
black boy. They started for the plains, but the first place they
struck into for water was dry; they then made over to a waterhole
Mr. Giles MacPherson (for that was the prospector's name) knew
of. Alas, that was dry also; and their horses had been three days
without a drink. MacPherson then decided to strike back for the
station. He had to destroy four horses, but one mare bravely
struggled on with them. On the sixth day MacPherson reached the
station; and late in the evening the black boy came in. They had
been three days without water, and the weather had been intensely
hot. The horse had been six days without a drink and lived. Mr.
Wells has observed the latitude of Fraser Range Station to be
32&#176; 2' 15", showing the range to be thirteen miles out of
position on the West Australian maps&#8212;thirteen miles farther
south than shown. The Peak is 2,010ft. above sea level.</p>
<p><b><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>November, 1891]</b></p>
<p><i>Sunday, November 1st.</i>&#8212;Fraser Range Station. I and
Mahyedin returned to the camp, taking the meat and the camels.
Watered all the camels in the evening, and tied them down. Max.
temp. 86&#176;, min. temp. 59&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.89, ther.
70&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 22.72[<i>sic</i>], ther. 83&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Monday, November 2nd.</i>&#8212;Simons' Hill
dep&#244;t&#8212;No. 3. Camp 69. Gave the camels another drink
at the rockhole; and, with all our casks and water vessels full,
we started at 9.45 on bearing 280&#176; for the Murchison,
<i>vi&#226;</i> Hampton Plains, where we expect to get water, a
black-fellow, his wife, and six-year-old boy going with us to
show us plenty "gebi." At six miles we crossed our track inwards.
Camp 70 at 2 p.m.; distance nine miles. The day has been hot,
with a west wind; cloudy, looking like thunder. The country
passed over is fairly good&#8212;a reddish clay loam; mallee,
quondong, acacia, saltbush: very dry. At 5 p.m. a strong south to
south-east wind. Max. temp. 95&#176;, min. temp. 61&#176;. At 9
a.m., bar. 28.73, ther. 75&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.69, ther.
83&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, November 3rd.</i>&#8212;Last night was cold,
windy, and cloudy. This morning broke cold and clear. South-east
wind continued all day. We started at 5.40 and camped at 2.40.
All the country seen to-day was good&#8212;saltbush abundant,
open mallee, ti-tree, few thickets, bluebush, and patches of
grass. At fifteen miles we crossed a high ridge, from which we
could see Fraser Range bearing 155&#176;. The native could from a
treetop see the hill to which he is taking us for the first
water. Our course was 295&#176;. Micaceous and hornblendic
schists. Camp 71. Lat. 31&#176; 42' 3". Distance, sixteen and a
half miles. Max. temp. 82&#176;, min. temp. 53&#176;. At 9 a.m.,
bar. 29.05, ther. 72&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.82, ther. 80&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, November 4th.</i>&#8212;Camp 71. Resumed our
journey at 5.30 on bearing 305&#176;. At five miles came to a
small rockhole, which only contained 16galls. of water, which we
took out and gave to the two Fraser Range camels. Good country,
but dry. Saltbush, mallee, ti-tree, &amp;c. Many good stock
bushes. We should not have seen the rockhole, as it was off the
course we were travelling; but when we came to a big patch of
splendid black butt timber the natives turned off for this
rockhole. The black butt timber is of the Eucalyptus species; it
is a useful timber, splitting easily. The natives make their long
spears out of this wood. Mr. Wells and Mr. Streich went to the
prominent bluff two and a half miles west, which Mr. Streich
described as being of "same formation as yesterday, viz.,
argillaceous slate, micaceous schist, hornblendic schist, and
quartz reefs. A likely country for minerals, and worth
prospecting." Mr. Wells was able to get bearings to some
important hills. The native pointed bearing 310&#176; for water,
and I led the caravan in that direction. At fifteen miles we came
to salt lakes. Country is all mallee; good dark loamy soil,
undulating; mallee very dense; hopbush and few quondongs, with
patches of saltbush. At 2.45 we turned out, having travelled
fifteen miles. Camp 72. Lat. 31&#176; 35' 45". Cool south-east to
east wind. Sun hot. All vegetation extremely dry. Poor feed for
camels. Max. temp. 89&#176;, min. temp. 41&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.
28.92, ther. 20&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.89, ther. 85&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, November 5th.</i>&#8212;Camp 72. Mild night;
clear, cold; east wind. Sun hot. In three and a half miles we
passed the west end of a salt lake, which extends four miles to
the east. At four and a half miles came on the shore of a lake
extending east and west ten or more miles. The lake bed was too
soft to carry the weight of a loaded camel. Mr. Wells led his
camel across, and we met on the quartzite ridge which forms the
northern shore, and which is 1,450ft. above sea level. The
caravan followed the southern shore, and crossed the western end
of the lake. The manner in which I test the state of the lake
beds is by cutting a stick, pointing the end of it, and every few
yards I push it down to the hard bottom, which, if reached at
less than 1ft., I deem it safe to take the loaded camels; if over
that depth it is not safe, as the bed of these lakes is composed
of a stiff gritty red clay, which clings to the feet. From the
top of the low quartzite range, which trends nearly east and
west, we could see salty plains evidently clothed with saltbush
and a chain of salt lakes extending west as far as could be seen,
with low hills beyond. The open country appears to extend
northwards. The prominent hill passed yesterday was seen bearing
120&#176;. We now entered a splendid country&#8212;salt- and
bluebush, mallee, sandalwood, acacias, quondongs, but all very
dry, a rich red loam well adapted for agriculture if the rainfall
was sufficient. This class of country continued for eight miles,
when we camped on good feed, but unfortunately a lot of saltbush,
which the camels will eat. Turned out at 2.15, having travelled
twenty-six miles. Camp 73. Lat. 31&#176; 26' 20". As we were
travelling I noticed the native woman look about her, and then
walk straight for a morrell gumtree. We went across to see what
she had found. The tree trunk branched off into two about 4ft.
from the ground, and just in the fork was a small hole (decayed
centre), out of which the small black ants were streaming in
thousands. The woman pushed a stick in and withdrew it wet; so
here was a water. supply. We watched with interest, wondering how
they would get at the water. Turning to a shrub near by a branch
was broken, and with their teeth they loosened the bark and drew
it off. Pushing the ends of three or four of these into one
another a long pipe was formed and the water sucked up. The water
had collected there by means of the branches guiding the little
streams of water after or during a shower of rain. Max. temp.
93&#176;, min. temp. 55&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 29.0, ther. 55&#176;;
3 p.m., 28.49, ther. 91&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Friday, November 6th.</i>&#8212;Camp 73. At 5 a.m. we
resumed on bearing 310&#176; over the same good country for twelve
miles, when we entered sandhills and sandy country bordering some
salt lakes. The country became much poorer, the vegetation also
being mostly mallee, although occasionally there were patches of
good acacias. The day was intensely hot, and we camped a little
earlier on good green bushes at the north&#173;west point of a
salt lake (dry), having travelled seventeen miles. Thunderstorms
about. Just after leaving camp this morning we passed a cliff,
nob on top, of a long range, whose height is 1,500ft. above sea
level&#8212;sandstone (arg.). In the bed of this salt lake there
are numerous outcrops of white quartz and a dyke of
ironstone&#8212;I fancy rather a likely place for gold. A
splendid red clay forms the bed of this lake, which is surrounded
by high sand ridges. Camp 74. Lat. 31&#176; 14' 8". Mr. Wells'
camel ran him under an overhanging branch, which dragged him off.
Fortunately he escaped without any injury. Max. temp. 99&#176;,
min. temp. 60&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.58, ther. 83; at 3 p.m.,
bar. 28.62, ther. 97&#176;. In the evening a strong wind from the
south cooled the air and drove away the thunderstorms.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, November 7th.</i>&#8212;Camp 74. Cool night;
light sprinkling of rain a few times; strong south wind. At 5.40
we were again travelling on bearing for Mount Monger, which was
in sight. At five miles over the same class of country we struck
one of the eastern arms of Lake Lefroy. We could not see either
end, east or west. We had at two miles crossed a smaller arm of
the same lake. I sounded in the usual way, and got good bottom
from 8in. to 12in., but the red clay was so sticky that the
water-carrying camels fell down when we were some distance out on
the lake. We had considerable difficulty with one of the heavy
camels. We had to spread a tarpaulin in front of him and slip it
under him as he endeavored to rise. We returned to the shore and
followed along westerly where the lake seemed narrower. I sounded
in many places before I found a place where I thought we could
venture to take the camels, halving all the heavy loads. Only one
water-cask was put on a camel. By this means we all got safely to
the other side, after a delay of three hours. An island stood in
the lake, of hornblendic rocks. We camped at 2 o'clock on good
feed two and a half miles from Mount Monger, having only made
eleven miles. Mr. Wells went over to Mount Monger, ascended it,
and took bearings to prominent hills. He found a diorite hill on
his way to camp. Camp 75. Lat. 31&#176; 6' 30". Max. temp.
90&#176;, min. temp. 53&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.81, ther.

and four miles=fifteen miles.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, November 8th.</i>&#8212;Camp 75. Heavy fog; cool
night. At 5.15 we resumed our journey on bearing 290&#176;,
missing the various northern arms of Lake Lefroy, which lay like
a vast sheet of silver in the morning sun, the southern shores
being invisible. We passed over splendid undulating forest
country, grass, salt- and bluebushes, sandalwood, acacia,
quondong, and large mallee; good soil, with red clay subsoil, as
revealed by the sides of the watercourses crossed. At six miles
we changed our course to 266&#176; for Hunt's Slate Well. Our
black guide has pointed straight for Hunt's Well, but told us we
could not go straight owing to the Salt Lake. He now pointed
straight for Hunt's Well. The same beautiful country continued.
When we had gone twelve miles, and when in sight of the creek on
which Hunt's Well is situated, our guide pointed south-west. We
turned, and in one mile came to a saltpan, surrounded by cliffs,
which he examined and seemed very puzzled, and turning led us
north for a short distance, when he saw a horse track ("pony
china"). He turned west again until we came to a small
watercourse, which he followed for one mile southerly, until he
came to where natives had sunk some small wells. He sat down
under a shady bush and, proudly pointing to the hollow, said
"Plenty gebi." We turned out, there being good feed, but the
camels would not cat, the hot weather and the saltbush having
made them so thirsty. Sank the well, and at Oft. came On the
pipeclay bottom, on top of which was a 8in. layer of gravel, out
of which a little water oozed. Sank a hole in the pipeclay to
allow the water to accumulate. The native points up the valley
for more water. I will camp here to-morrow as there is good feed,
and find Hunt's Well and have a look around for water. I am now
much afraid we shall have to go to Yilgarn for water. This will
be very disappointing, as we had hoped to have at least been able
to follow a new line of country (which we expected would be
auriferous) to the Murchison. Very hot and sultry. Camp 76.
Distance, twenty miles. Max. temp. 90&#176;, min. temp. 63&#176;;

<p><i>Monday, November 9th.</i>&#8212;Camp 76. Warm night; clear
warm morning. Messrs. Wells and Streich rode to the red hill six
miles to the south, which Mr. Streich reports to be of "eruptive
hornblendic rocks, intrusive schists, and slates." I, with the
natives, went up the creek to find a water which they assured me
was there, and also to find Hunt's well and tank. The boy got on
some horse tracks and followed them six miles, till we came on
the creek again, when he was again puzzled. went on a bit further
and came on a tank in the red clay bed of the creek, near which
stands a tree marked <small>TANK\15/8/90\W.P.G.</small>
(encircled), the bottom just cracking as it dried in the sun. The
natives were quite nonplussed over the non-existence of water,
"Kapi kuya" (no water) being now their cry. Seeing a smoke not
very far off to the westward I sent the natives off to bring in
the black-fellows. I followed down on the east side of the flat,
passing an old camp (white-fellows'). Found the slate well fallen
in and dry. From the appearance of the spoil heap I do not think
Mr. Hunt, who sank the well in 1864, got any water in it. This is
a nice valley; good grass and saltbush, reddish clayey loam, with
red clay subsoil. The outcropping rocks on the west side indicate
a gold-bearing country. Ther. 120&#176; in shade. Our well yielded
4galls. in twenty-four hours. At sundown the natives returned
very thirsty, bringing with them a man who, so far as we could
understand him, said there was no water in this valley, or
anywhere near here. Charcoal, our guide, said he found the one
man, two women, and some children, but no water. They were living
on root water. This now means westward towards Yilgarn, along
Hunt's track, visiting all the watering places he found or made.
I scarcely expect to find any, or but very little, this side of
Yilgarn, as the country is described as "miserable thickets and
sand plains, with outcrops of granite." I will send Charcoal and
his companions away to-morrow and take the old man on, for if he
does not take us to water he may save us time and trouble by
telling us there is none in places where one would look for it.
Max. temp. shade 102&#176;, min. temp. 60&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.
28.65, ther. 72&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.59, ther. 100&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, November 10th.</i>&#8212;Camp 76. Close, warm,
clear night. At 5.10 we started on bearing 266&#176;. Charcoal
left for Fraser Range. The old man went on with us. Splendid
country continued for twelve miles. At four miles we crossed a
high, stony range, covered with big mallee and gums. Good soil.
At thirteen miles passed Dep&#244;t Hill, 1,500ft high, of
gneiss, very much broken. A large smoke in the distance, W.N.W.
Our native wanted me to go there, saying there was water. It was
not safe to go, as probably we should have found but a small
rockhole. At 1.10 we camped on good feed, having made sixteen
miles. The day was exceedingly hot. The camels look worse than
they did when we reached Fraser Range. They will. not eat, but
lay about under the shady bushes. I really feel more anxious
about them than at any time during our journey. Having been nine
days on half-dry saltbush has played the mischief with them. At.
sundown gave them 2galls. of water each with 7lbs. of oatmeal
mixed between them. The oatmeal was so used at the advice of Dr.
Elliot. Two of the camels. being weaker than the rest, had 4galls
of water. Camp 77. Max. temp. 102&#176;, min. temp. 65&#176;. At 9
a.m., bar. 28.57, ther. 80&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.41, ther.

<p><i>Wednesday, November 11th.</i>&#8212;Camp 77. Close, clear
night. East wind in the morning. Again very hot. The country is
patchy. Sometimes poor soil, with thickets, and then open large
mallees, with clayey loam and good stock bushes. If we had water
the camels would do very well here. Travelling slow. Occasional
outcrops of gneiss. Started at 4.52 and camped at 12.50. The
camels sought the shady bushes and only nibbled at some feed. As
we were travelling this morning we discovered that during the
night Alumgool's riding camel had knocked one eye out and another
camel had cut his foot badly. Dr. Elliot operated on the camel's
eye, but was unable to save the sight. Again gave the camels
2galls. of water each out of the casks as they were in such a bad
state; I was really afraid they would give in. Camp 78. bat.

a.m., bar. 28.46, ther. 81&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.49, ther.
93&#176;. To-day's bearing 268&#176;. Sixteen miles.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, November 12th.</i>&#8212;Clear, close night. Made
our usual early start, and at seven miles came on a patch of
burnt country with some green plants, and turned out hoping the
camels would eat; they picked about a little and then Mr. Helms
reported finding <i>Gastrolobium oxenalis</i> growing
plentifully; fortunately none of the camels ate any. At 4 p.m. we
again started, but as the scrub continued thick we had to stop at
7.15, having only made fourteen miles for the day. Sandy
undulating country with thickets of mallee and miserable scrubs.
Crossed a gneiss outcrop. Camp. 79. To-day's course 275&#176;.
Fourteen miles. Max. temp. 99&#176;, min. temp. 61&#176;. At 9
a.m., bar. 28.62, ther. 81&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.51, ther.

<p><i>Friday, November 13th.</i>&#8212;Camp 79. Hot, clear.
Started at 4 a.m.; at six miles we struck a horse pad on Hunt's
cleared track which led us through some very dense thickets, and
right glad we were to be on a pad, for the camels travelled much
better knowing, poor creatures, that it would lead to water. At
12 o'clock we reached Yerdanie and found a well constructed by
Hunt in 1864. It was well built up with blocks of gneiss and we
had not much trouble in cleaning it out. We sunk the well to
bottom on rock at 15ft., but unfortunately found but little
water. By 11.30 p.m. we had drained it and only secured 70galls.,
which we gave to the camels. Very hot day. Undulating sandy
country, quite useless for any purpose. Granite out&#173;crops
1,650ft. above sea level. Camp 80. Lat. 31&#176; 11' 5". Max.
temp. 96&#176;, min. temp. 59&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.44, ther.

Courses&#8212;275&#176; for six miles; then 255&#176; gradually
making around to 270&#176; for ten miles.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, November 14th.</i>&#8212;Camp 80. Yerdanie. At
8.30 we got 18galls. more water. Started at 5 o'clock, still
along Hunt's track, which is clearly visible here and there by
the stumps of the bushes which had been cut down. Some of the
branches lay on the ground undecayed, although they have been
there for twenty-eight years. At 7 o'clock, six miles having
travelled over good bush country to Warangering, where we found a
rockhole dammed up by white men, and containing about 300galls.
of dirty water. Turned the camels out. Cool west wind sprang up,
and the camels ate for a little while. In the evening we gave
them three buckets (8galls.) each, which revived the poor
creatures greatly. Large bare gneissic granite rocks 1,550ft.
high. Camp 81. Max. temp. 98&#176;, min. temp. 56&#176;. At 9 a.m.,
bar. 28.13, ther. 87&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.03, ther. 96&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, November 15th.</i>&#8212;Camp 81. Yesterday evening
a nice change set in. A cool damp south-east wind blew during the
night. We started at 5.25, and passed over rather poor
country&#8212;mallee thickets, raspberry jam wood, acacias,
spinifex, sandy, with granite outcrops. At 1.15 we camped at
another big out&#173;crop, on the east end of which we found a
stoned well, Boorabbin. Very good feed; acacias and wattles,
sheaoak. Sank the well 4ft. deeper, making it 13ft. to bottom;
but found very little water, and the camels are very thirsty. We
took about 15galls. per hour out. At midnight Bob bailed eight
buckets. We gave the eight poorest camels 4galls. each and six
others 3galls. each. In ordinary seasons there would be a good
supply of water in this well, as the catchment area is large.
Marked a sheaoak tree <small>D.L./</small>15.11.91. Camp 82.
Height 1,650ft. Sixteen miles. Max. temp. 86&#176;, min. temp.

28.11, ther. 80&#176;. At 8 p.m. a strong south wind cooled the
atmosphere and brought up heavy clouds. Course for the day, about
265&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Monday, November 16th.</i>&#8212;Camp 82. Boorabbin. Cold,
windy, cloudy. Ther. 48&#176;. At sunrise we emptied the well
again, which yielded altogether about 160galls. or 170galls. of
very good pure water. Took on 100galls. in the casks. Resumed our
journey along Hunt's track at 5.40 a.m. Passed over most
miserable country&#8212;undulating, sandy, clothed with stunted
bushes of many kinds, dwarf casuarina, mallee, acacias, dead
pines, spinifex, and rushes, numerous flowering plants;
<i>Gastrolobiums</i> everywhere. Mr. Helms is able to add to his
collection, having found two new plants to-day; but for the rest
of us the country has no attractiveness. From the extremely
tortuous course of this track it is evident that twenty-seven
years ago, the country had many dense thickets, which fires have
since destroyed. At 1.40, having travelled eighteen miles, we
came to another granite outcrop, around which a little feed was
growing, and on the east side of which is a very small dry stoned
well, Quardanoolagin, at which we turned out. Camp 83. Much
poison plant on the west side of the rocks. Height 1,750ft.
Passed to-day a rocky hill formed of coarse conglomerate
quartzite. Max. temp. 89, min. temp. 48&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar,

<p><i>Tuesday, November 17th.</i>&#8212;Camp 83. Quardanoolagin.
During the night the wind blew strongly from south-east and east.
Lightning to east and north-east. A few drops of rain. Resumed
our journey at 5.25, with a strong north-east to north wind. Much
<i>Gastrolobium</i>. here. Good, reddish, clayey soil, producing
acacias, quondongs, ti-tree, raspberry jam, &amp;c., with black
wattles around the granite outcrops. In ten miles we came to a
rock called Karoling, on top of which Mr. Wells found two fine
shallow rockholes, full of beautifully clear rainwater, and I
found a stone dam across a creek, with an excavation, into which
is a good soakage. Turned out and pitched our camp amongst some
very large white gum trees. The camels were able to go to the
water and drink their fill and then revel in some really good
feed, but as the dreaded <i>Gastrolobium</i> was abundant I was
very anxious about them. We shall camp here to-morrow to let the
poor brutes have a rest and a good soaking of water. Mr. Helms
found the first true water plants of the journey. He also
obtained some new plants. Camp 84. Karoling 1,500 feet above sea
level. Marked a gum tree <small>E.E.W./D.L./</small>84/17.4.91

<p><i>Wednesday, November 18th.</i>&#8212;Camp 84. Karoling.
Strong south wind during night. Cold, cloudy. Sun rose in a
cloudy sky. Attending camels, washing clothes, &amp;c. Very good
feed, but limited in quantity. About enough for our camels for a
week, but I shall be glad to get away, as the poison plant is too
plentiful. Emptied the casks and half filled them with clear,
fresh water from a rockhole. A shower of rain fell here within
the last month. According to the plans we have we are now about
seventy miles from Knutsford, apparently the town of the Yilgarn
goldfields, and about thirty-five miles from Kookendine, where I
think there are some mines. At last we have obtained sufficient
water to make a fresh start, but on reference to the map it will
be seen that we are 250 miles from the edge of the unexplored
country, with no water for 700 miles, and, so far as we know,
none between us and block A. Our camels are weak and very low in
condition, and absolutely unfit to attempt any exploration.
Nothing can be done from here with flying parties. There can be
no two opinions about the course to pursue. The only reasonable
and safe direction to follow is to go into Knutsford, from where
we shall probably find a road or pad leading northwards to the
Murchison, by following which we shall not have long stages
without water, and the camels will improve a little. Max. temp.

<p><i>Thursday, November 19th.</i>&#8212;Karoling. Camp 84. Left
the camp at 5.40 on bearing 278&#176; for Corling. All the camels
are well, although when I was looking around them after they were
tied down for the night I found Mr. Leech had tied his camel
close up to a large <i>Gastrolobium</i> bush. At four miles we
passed Corling, which is a huge outcrop of granite full of
rounded waterworn cavities, but no water. Surrounding it the
country is good red loamy soil, large mallees and gum trees.
Cool, strong, south to southeast wind, cloudy. Black butt and
rough bark gum trees. Black wattles grow large and luxuriant
close to these granite outcrops. The blazes on the trees are now
very distinct, and Hunt's track has been marked in places by
stakes recently. Between Karoling and Corling the cleared track
has been renewed, but after passing the latter place the track
becomes very indistinct, although every little while we see
Hunt's blazed trees and stumps. At ten miles we came to a narrow
salt lake, which the horses had crossed, but we found it too
sticky for our weak camels, and had to go round the north end of
it. On the western edge of the lake is a low peaked
hill&#8212;quartzite, quartz, lime. Granite on the edge, and
showing to the south. Yellowish soil with limestone. Nodules and
large timber. At fourteen miles, near a granite outcrop, we
struck a somewhat recent dray track leading north-west. We
followed it over poor, hard, yellowish soil, producing only
stunted and poor bushes with low mallee. At 2 o'clock, having
made about eighteen miles, we turned out in a York gum thicket
with mallees, quondong, boxbushes, and one or two other sorts
which the camels eat. I did not care to pass this bit of feed, as

<p><i>Friday, November 20th.</i>&#8212;Camp 85. Clear.
Immediately after leaving camp passed out of the timber and
entered on the sand plains, high undulations covered with low
heath and thick scrubs, through which the pad wound in a most
tortuous course. At about four miles, when we were on top of a
high ridge, we saw some distance ahead of us, at the foot. of a
long, low black range, some white objects, which were very
puzzling. They looked like tents or galvanized iron houses, but
might only be patches of a salt lake showing through the trees.
No one could make them out, and our plans did not show any
township there. I came to the conclusion that unless they were
houses and tents I had never seen anything so misleading in the
bush. At seven miles we came to a paddock (post and wire fence)
in which was two stone tanks with water and some horses. As the
gate was locked with a pair of handcuffs I concluded it was a
police paddock and that a township could not be far off.
According to our plan this is Buladgin. For some miles the track
had been leading us a little south of west, but now it turned
again north-west, and was a well-worn road leading through a
rather better country. Good red soil; mallee forests&#8212;some
very fine timber, black butts, York and morrell gums, salmon
gums, fluted or gimlet mallee, &amp;c. At fourteen miles we saw
two men cutting timber. I went to them and ascertained that the
houses showing through the trees about one mile distant
constituted the township of Southern Cross, the central
dep&#244;t of the Yilgarn goldfields. There being good feed,
suitable trees and bushes, besides a good deal of saltbush, we
turned out and pitched camp. The officers and myself walked up to
the town, the first house we came to being a public-house rudely
constructed of galvanized iron. Those who saw us coming in took
us for a party of mining experts from the other side. But on its
becoming known who we were some little excitement occurred. An
Adelaide man, Mr. Raeside, was amongst the first we met. I then
walked up to the warden's tent and was introduced to him,
learning that he had just returned from a hasty trip to Ularing,
where gold had been found. As there was absolutely no water in
that locality he had declared it a goldfield and granted
suspension to the holders of claims for six months. It was very
fortunate for us that I did not push on from Hampton Plains for
Ularing depending upon getting water there. We should have lost
many of our camels and crippled the the expedition. I and Mr.
Wells dined with Mr. Raeside, who has charge of the Government
works. The other officers had their dinner at the hotel, where
the warden (Mr. Finnerty), the bank officials and other prominent
residents board. After dinner Messrs. Leech, Wells, Streich, and
I were driven out by Mr. Raeside four miles to Kookendine, where,
on the shores of a salt lake, is situated the battery belonging
to the Hope's Hill Gold Mining Company, whose claim or lease is
about two miles distant. After inspecting the battery we went on
to the mine, and found an immense formation or lode of quartz,
with bands of steatite and kaolin, all of which goes straight to
the battery and yields an average of 18dwts. to the ton. As the
formation is 27ft. wide this would pay handsomely, were it not
for the high rate of wages (&#163;3 10s. to &#163;4 per week
for miners), the scarcity of water, and the distance between the
stone and the machine. The cost of feeding a horse is &#163;4
per week, so that the cartage of the stone must be a very heavy
item. It is intended to lay a light tramway; but I think it a
great pity that the stampers were not put up on the mine and the
water forced to it. The battery is a primitive one. and salt
water has to be used for the boilers. Twenty more stampers are
shortly to be added. Water for domestic use is distilled, and, as
eucalyptus leaves and kerosine are put in the boiler to keep the
salt from incrusting, the water has not a pleasant taste. The
rocks are hornblendic, chlorite, and talcose slate. We returned
to the township, taking with us an old South Australian friend,
Mr. W. W. Mills. Camp 86; 900ft. above sea level.
Courses&#8212;West, thirteen miles; north-west, seven
miles=twenty miles.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, November 21st.</i>&#8212;Mr. Streich and I
inspected Fraser's South mine, with which we were very pleased.
The reef, the workings, and the machinery are all good. The reef
is large, and carries a good average of gold (over loz. to the
ton). I made no notes of the mines, asking Mr. Streich to do so,
which he did. I then left him to go on with his inspection of the
other mines, I contenting myself with a chat with the manager of
the Central, and then went into the township to do my business. I
could not help remarking that as the batteries (some of them)
have been built on level ground they will soon be smothered in
their own tailings. All these mines are paying their way, and
will pay good dividends when the railway has reduced the cost of
working to about one-third. There can be no question as to the
future of this district. I went into the store and ordered six
weeks' supply of rations, calculated on a more liberal scale than
usual, that is as regards certain luxuries. Ordered six bottles
of brandy (half a case).</p>
<p><i>Sunday, November 22nd.</i>&#8212;At Southern Cross.
Everyone in the township. Weather exceedingly hot. Busy writing
letters and reports. Promised to take the caravan through the
township at 9.15 on Monday morning.</p>
<p><i>Monday, November 23rd.</i>&#8212;Southern Cross. Hot,
clear. At 9 a.m. we left the camp and, by way of the Fraser
South, we entered the township, and found nearly all the
inhabitants assembled to see us. Some of the leading residents,
seeing that we were about to start, invited us all into the
dining room of the hotel, and produced some champagne. The warden
and magistrate (Mr. Finnerty) in a very kind manner expressed
their great pleasure at having met us, regretted the waterless
state of the country through which we had travelled, sympathised
with us for being driven out of our intended course, and
complimented us upon having come through safely, and
congratulated us upon the wonderful journey we had accomplished.
On behalf of the members of the expedition I replied, thanking
Mr. Finnerty and the residents for the warm welcome and many
kindnesses they had shown us, that while we had been very glad to
have made their acquaintance, it was a source of great annoyance
to us that we had been, for want of water, driven so far into the
known country. Praised the officers for their behavior under the
difficulties and unpleasantnesses of the journey, and referred to
the wonderful power of the camels. I then called upon the members
of the expedition to drink to the success of Southern Cross,
coupled with the name of Mr. Finnerty, who replied, thanking us.
We then went out into the street and walked up to the next store,
where an account had to be settled. I saw that everybody was
mounted, and asked them if they were right, to which Mr. Leech
replied, "Yes; we are all right." I mounted and, amidst the
cheers of the assembled crowd, I took my place at the head of the
caravan, and we moved off along the road towards Golden Valley,
or Knutsford, near where we were to get water, the camels being
very thirsty again. Mr. Wells rode on to Hope's Hill with Mr.
Mills for the latter's swag, I having promised to give him a lift
to the Murchison. On top of the rise half a mile out I looked
back and saw all coming on. We then entered the dense mallee
forest, and the tail of the caravan was of course lost to sight.
After crossing the lake near Kookendine I looked back and saw the
rear guard just emerging on to the open half a mile behind. I
went on and saw no more of them, as we were travelling through
dense scrubs until after we had camped at 4 p.m., thirteen miles
out, on the first feed we came to. I had let my camel go and was
about to assist in unloading when Warren rode in and said the
doctor had sent him on to say that Bob Ramsay had had a
sunstroke, and to send back some water to them, about five miles
behind. Immediately took a fresh camel out of the team, saddled
up, filled two bags with water, broke open a case for some
brandy, and started within ten minutes of Warren's arrival in
camp, and rode back five miles, to find Bob better, but Mr. Leech
said during the doctor's absence he had some kind of a fit. On
our way we met Mr. Wells and Mills, who said they had given them
all the water out of their bags. Dr. Elliot poured water over the
back of Bob's neck, let him drink a little, gave him a thirst
tabloid, a pill, and told him to lay quiet. We got him on his
camel and I kept close to him all the way cheering him up, and
got him into camp safely, but very much done up. Camp 87. Max.

<p><i>Tuesday, November 24th.</i>&#8212;Camp 87. South-east wind
during night; clear. Bob is better, but his head is very bad. At
1.15 in eighteen miles over poor country, we reached the police
tanks, which are just completed. There is a nice little soakage
into a granite tank at the base of a granite outcrop. Watered the
camels. Messrs. Finnerty and Raeside drove out from Southern
Cross, and dined with us. Mr. Finnerty expressed his astonishment
at our camels travelling in their present condition, and said he
would not like to tackle the journey now before us, they looked
so bad. We have not been fortunate enough to find a place to
spell at, and there is no feed here. Camp 88. Height, 130ft. Max.

<p><i>Wednesday, November 25th.</i>&#8212;Walked to another rock
where there are three wells, and found plenty of feed and water.
Altogether a very desirable spot to rest at, and as two of our
camels yesterday could not rise with little more than the empty
saddles, we shall take advantage of the opportunity, and rest a
few days before we start on a journey of in all probability 150
miles without water through a miserable country. Will move on
to-morrow; remaining here to-day partly on account of Ramsay, who
is not fit to move about. I walked ten miles. Cool; south wind,
strong and pleasant. These tanks are on the main road between
Northam and Yilgarn, and about nine miles from Golden Valley. In
the evening a strong, cool south to south-west wind. Camp 88.

<p><i>Thursday, November 26th.</i>&#8212;Camp 88. Cold night,
south-east wind. At 6.25 started for the other water, four miles
distant. One camel again unable to rise with anything on its
back. Rajah fell down with Mr. Leech, and was too weak to rise,
so that we must stop at this water as long as the feed will last,
or else these poor camels will not be able to reach the
Murchison. Pitched camp comfortably; rigged our canvas troughs,
watered the camels, and let them go, many of them without
hobbles. The troughs will be kept full. and as the camels will be
eating saltbush they will come in to water every day. After
dinner Abdul and I went to Golden Valley for sheep; brought out
two alive. Golden Valley is about eleven miles from the camp; it
is just on the eastern edge of the surveyed township of
Knutsford. In the township proper there are no houses. In the
Valley there is a public-house at which the miners working in the
neighborhood board. The only other building is a house belonging
to one of the mines. There is a well of fresh water, but the
owners will not allow the residents to use it; consequently they
have to cart the water from the wells where we are camped. There
are two or three mines here, but very little work is being done;
a battery is being erected, but I do not think these mines will
pay. The country is very hard; the reefs not large, and
apparently not rich. I will send Mr. Streich in to examine them
and the country in the neighborhood. Camp 89. Max. temp. 84&#176;,

<p><i>Friday, November 27th.</i>&#8212;Cold nights, strong
south-east wind; morning broke clear and cold. Mr. Wells busy
over the plans. Messrs. Helms, Mills, and I walked over to some
granite rocks two or three miles distant. No water there, and
only a few acacia bushes. The camels are on good saltbush,
quondong, and. other green bushes, and when they come in to drink
they feed for a while on the green acacias and wattles growing
around this rock at the camp. I have instructed the Afghans to be
sure, that at least once in three days they see all the camels.

<p><i>Saturday, November 28th.</i>&#8212;Dep&#244;t, No. 4. East
wind, cold and clear. Attending to camels. Gave poorer ones
flour, fat and sugar, which mixture has a wonderful effect on
camels when they get low in condition. I have known camels
spelling on good feed without improving in condition, but after
two or three doses of fat, &amp;c., to at once begin to get
strong and put on condition. Rubbed tar and oil on the mangy
ones. Administered castor oil to some who needed it. Mr. Wells
and I working at the plans, which we intend to send away from
here. Max temp. 90&#176;, min. temp. 50&#176;, At 9 a.m., bar.

<p><i>Sunday, November 29th.</i>&#8212;Clear, east wind, cool.
Working at plans. Mr. Leech has not yet acquainted me with his
decision. The camels are on good bush and coming into water every
day, when they drink an enormous quantity. I told Mr. Streich
that I thought it would be advantageous to him to go into Golden
Valley and examine the country there, and that he could go in
to-morrow, when I would be sending in for sheep; he could live at
the hotel for a few days. Max. temp. 96&#176;, min. temp.

<p><i>Monday, November 30th.</i>&#8212;North-east wind, hot. Sent
Mahmoud into Golden Valley for sheep, and Mr. Streich went with
him. I told Mr. Streich to let Mahmoud bring the camel back, as
there was no water and but little feed there, and that I would
send it for him on Wednesday. He promised to do so. Dr. Elliot
and Mr. Helms went to the large granite outcrop three miles
distant, on the shores of Lake Deborah, to take some photographs.
After dark we heard a cooee and answered it. Went across, and
found a black-fellow in charge of 100 sheep going to the Southern
Cross. He said he had been three days on the road and Would be
two days more. He was quite alone, not even a dog. That is cheap
droving. Mahmoud returned with two sheep and a message from Mr.
Streich that he would keep the camel there.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 1st.</i>&#8212;Hot, clear, north-east to
north wind. The doctor came back for some water, and said he was
getting some excellent photographs. I cannot understand what he
is doing. Mr. Leech handed me a telegram to send to the President
of the Royal Geographical Society, Adelaide, asking to be allowed
to resign his position on reaching the Murchison.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, December 2nd.</i>&#8212;Doctor and Helms still
at the rocks. Engaged letter writing and plan making. Mr. Streich

<p><i>Thursday, December 3rd.</i>&#8212;In the evening the doctor
and Mr. Helms returned. I told them that there would be an
opportunity to write, as I would take in a mail to-morrow. Sent
Mahmoud in for two sheep. The camels are improving. The Afghans
are engaged repairing saddles and making two new ones for the two
cows I bought at Fraser Range. Max. temp. 100&#176;, min. temp.

<p><i>Friday, December 4th.</i>&#8212;I reached Golden Valley at
5 p.m, and let my camel go for the night, as I would be engaged
with my correspondence up to a le to hour. The weather is very
peculiar&#8212;hot days, thundery; strong north-west gales at

<p><i>Saturday, December 5th.</i>&#8212;Heavy gale. Thunder to
the southward. Returned to camp at 2 p.m. Made preparations for
starting on Monday. One of the tanks or wells has gone dry, and
we have to commence using from another one. We could not stay
here any longer if we wanted to, or the Valley people would have
no water left for their use. Max. temp. 90&#176;, min. temp.

thirty-six camels seen to-day; six missing, but they were seen
yesterday, so that they cannot be far away. Max. temp. 89&#176;,

about 49&#176;. Five camels missing until near midday. Watered
them all, and at 12.30 started along the road for Golden Valley,
it being necessary to go that way to get across Lake Deborah. At
nine miles we camped, and Abdul and I went into the Valley for a
sheep and some stores I had purchased to replenish those used
during our spell. I stayed to write some letters and pay
accounts. Leech, doctor, Helms, and Streich walked in after
supper, and had a merry evening, returning to camp after
midnight. I reached camp about 11 p.m., having had a very good
Kimberley black boy given me, who will be very useful for
tracking and on the flying trips. Max. temp. 102&#176;, min. temp.

<p><i>Tuesday, December 8th.</i>&#8212;Camp 90. Cold south wind;
clear. Started at 6.25, and cut on to the Barcootin track about
one and a half miles from Golden Valley. Mr. Wells went into
Golden Valley to post a letter to the R.G.S. which I had
hurriedly written in pencil while the camels were being loaded.
We travelled over very good country, brownish sandy soil with
clay subsoil fit for agriculture, and now producing many edible
bushes and some grass, and crossed a narrow neck of Lake Deborah,
which was rather soft, and I was very glad to see all the camels
safely across. At midday we reached Barcootin, which is another
Government well or tank, at the foot of a large outcrop. Here
there is camped a black shepherd with a flock of about 500 sheep
belonging to Mr. Lukin whose station is some distance to the
westward. The scientific gentlemen went into Golden Valley this
morning and did not reach the camp till late. Mr. Rouls, from
Southern Cross, came here, and told me of a good well,
Elijahputten, which the native pointed to as lying to the
north&#173;west, and distant, as near as I could understand,
twenty five miles, but we were advised to ride round by a track,
making the distance somewhat greater. I decided not to fill up
the casks here, but go there and make that our starting point.
Took three sheep, as Mr. Lukin had given me permission to do so;
one was killed, and the other two would be carried alive in the
hide pack bags, thus enabling us to have fresh meat for a week
longer. Very good water here, but poor feed. Min. temp. 58&#176;.
At 9 a.m., bar. 28.61, ther. 70&#176;; 3 p.m., ther. 70&#176;. Camp

<p><i>Wednesday, December 9th.</i>&#8212;Camp 91. Cool night;
clear. South-east wind. Resumed our journey north-easterly to
Enuin, five miles distant, which is a granite outcrop, with a
well, and old hut, and yards. We the then turned with the track
north-westerly for Elijahputten, and passed through some good
saltbush for a short distance, and then miserable sand plains,
with dense thickets of scrub and mallee. At fifteen miles we
camped on poor feed. I am very glad we came by the road, as
pushing through these dense thickets is weary work for both man
and beast. Warm day. Camp 92. Max. temp. 97&#176;, mm. temp.

<p><i>Thursday, December 10th.</i>&#8212;Camp 92. Cool night;
south wind, clear. Started at 5.50, and travelled over poor
country to Elijahputten, fifteen miles. Passed some immense
outcrops of granite. Here is a splendid well, the best we have
seen&#8212;20ft. of water. The well has a whip and troughs, and
is at the eastern foot of an immense granite outcrop. Good feed,
but not much of it. A hobbled horse and some cattle here,
although no one to water them; they must have strayed from
somewhere. We gave the horse a drink, and he at once took the
road leading westward as fast as the hobbles would permit him. A
very strong west wind; cold, cloudy. Camp 93; lat. 30&#176; 35'

<p><i>Friday, December 11th.</i>&#8212;Camp 93. Elijahputten or
Elichaputten. Very cold south wind; little rain; heavy squalls.
Filled all the water vessels, and started bearing 330&#176; at
6.40, and for the first six or seven miles we passed through
fairly good country&#8212;good soil, salmon gums, mallee,
raspberry jam, mulga, acacias, quondongs, and a little saltbush.
Numerous fresh tracks of cattle and sheep crossing our course,
although we never heard of any camp being on our right and
nothing for thirty miles on our left. At eight miles passed an
old fallen in well. Soil is now lighter and poorer. Numerous
granite outcrops. The main body of granite appears to be on our
left and trending in the direction we are travelling. At ten
miles we were on top of an elevation 1,600ft. above sea level,
with the country we have passed over looking like a very deep
valley. Changed our bearing to 310&#176;, to go to some granite
rocks, where we shall find feed on which to camp, the country now
being most miserable, sandy and quartz gravel. At twelve miles
mallee, better soil, and bushes, sandy, ferruginous sandstone
rubble, low bushes. At fourteen miles we turned out on very good
feed; granite rocks, 1,650ft. above sea level. Some grass here,
but everything terribly dry. Found a small granite cup, with a
little water in it. Just on the edge of the scrub, when I was
looking around for a spot to pitch the camp on, some members of
the rearguard set fire to the scrub, which burnt furiously, and
was unpleasantly close to where we had to camp: Camp 94; lat.

<p><i>Saturday, December 12th.</i>&#8212;Camp 94. Clear south
wind during, night. At 6 a.m. we resumed our journey over most
miserable country on bearing 346&#176;, low scrub and thickets,
with patches of fluted mallee. Very poor country indeed, quite
unfit for any purpose; a light soil, poor, but here and there we
saw a little grass. In many places pebbles and broken stones of
quartzite and ferruginous material are scattered over the
surface. Granite outcrops frequently. At thirteen miles we saw a
smoke ahead bearing 315&#176;. The members of the party riding in
the rear have been amusing themselves setting fire to the scrubs,
which burn fiercely, being composed of jambush, dwarf casuarina,
&amp;c., all very dry. At 2 p.m., having only made about thirteen
miles, we turned out. The camels will not stand more than about
eight hours' travelling, and the thickets make our progress very
slow. Bob's camel has a bad knee, appears as if he had knelt on a
piece of broken glass. Dr. Elliot kindly dressed it and says he
will attend to it. Up to now Mr. Mills has been riding the camel
which Mr. Helms rode across the desert, but as it is knocking up
I have given him another one. Two of the young camels are rather
lame. This evening Dr. Elliot asked me for the plan Mr. Panton
gave him. Camp 95. Max. temp. 94&#176;, min. temp. 54&#176;. At 9

<p><i>Sunday, December 13th.</i>&#8212;Camp 95. Cold clear night,
south wind. During the day south to south-east wind,
strong&#8212;few fleecy clouds scudding across the sky. Started
at 5.50 on same bearing, and soon entered a dense jam thicket
through which we had to break our way for about one mile, when we
emerged upon low bushes, light sandy soil, with gravel on the

10", which shows that we have only made twenty-four in two days,
very slow travelling. Yet we cannot do more. The nature of the
country prevents fast travelling and if I keep the camels going
more than about eight hours some of them will give in. I must get
them all to the Murchison, where there is good feed and water on
which to rest them, while we examine the country to the eastward,
with lightly-equipped parties. Cold clear night. Last evening the
doctor cut the wound in Bob's camel's leg and said he ought not
to be ridden. At 5.45 we resumed our journey on bearing 305&#176;
for a big hill which Mr. Wells saw from a tree trop last night.
We rode through dense thickets of mulga and other bushes; with
the exception of the first two miles it is a most worthless
country. We passed a huge out&#173;crop of quartz 30ft. or 40ft.
high and 20yds. wide, direction north and south. Another big
castle-like outcrop of white quartz visible a mile or two to the
south. Very high mallee just here. I broke a good deal of the
quartz, but saw no color of gold. I was surprised to find in the
evening that Mr. Streich did not notice these immense outcrops.
At 10 o'clock we were at the foot of a big granite bill (bare),
which we supposed to be Mount Churchman. Climbed to the top of it
and then did not consider the hill was big enough or conspicuous
enough to be named as a mountain. It answered the description
given by Mr. Giles very well and was on the correct latitude, but
as we had no certain starting point we cannot be sure of its
identity yet. Moved on north-westerly and turned out at 2 p.m.,
having lost two hours at the granite hill. Camp 97. Distance
travelled twelve miles. Max. temp, 95&#176;, min. temp. 56&#176;.

<p><i>Tuesday, December 15th.</i>&#8212;Camp 97. Lat. 29&#176; 58'
30". Night warmer, with light south wind. Just above the camp
from the top of a cliff I could see a big, bare granite hill some
eight miles distant, bearing 290&#176;, which might be Mount
Churchman, but if so, then that mount is considerably out of
position on our map, or else our starting point, Knutsford (a
surveyed township), is incorrectly placed on the litho. maps of
Western Australia. At 5.50 we started on bearing true north. For
a considerable distance we had to go through a dense raspberry
jam thicket, and then had open, burnt country. At seven miles we
came to cliffs of conglomerate, covered with dense thickets. At
the foot open mallee, with saltbush (the same description of
country near our camp of yesterday). At the top of this cliff I
could see what I suppose to be Mount Singleton, dim in the
distance, bearing 301&#176;, and the salt lakes to the right of
it. Our course led us through dense scrub, with pines. So dense
was the scrub that three or four of us walked ahead, clearing the
way for the caravan. Granite outcropped occasionally. At 2.40 we
turned out on edge of a samphire flat, being the head of some
salt lakes we could see to the westward. This valley extends away
to the east for a great distance. Not very much feed, but the
country ahead did not look very promising. The day was hot and
the journey had been very trying. Distance, fifteen miles. Camp

South-east wind, clouds in west and east. Resumed our northward
journey at 5.45. Crossed samphire flats with good saltbush,
&amp;c., making a very good stock country; good reddish soil. At
eight miles crossed a large lake, loose gypseous soil, very dry
and Powdery; much samphire. We then entered low bushes and mulga;
good stock country. At 1.50 we turned out on very good
feed&#8212;acacias, quondongs, kurrajong, &amp;c. Cool, cloudy,
threatening for rain. At times during the day it was very hot and
sultry; thunder in the distance, a few drops of rain. Camp 99.

<p><i>Thursday, December 17th.</i>&#8212;Camp 99. Clear night,
light breeze; no rain. though there was thunder and lightning to
the north-west. We were a little late this morning, having been
sleeping under cover. At eight miles we were on top of a high
stony hill or range of argillaceous sandstone, very much
weathered, densely covered with mulga and other bushes. Can see a
hill, which we suppose to be Mount Kenneth, bearing 12&#176; on a
bearing of 343&#176;. There is a bare rock, to which we shall go
on the chance of finding water. In three miles farther (eleven
miles) we came on a few old cattle tracks. As we proceeded they
became more numerous; also a few horse tracks and many old sheep
tracks, showing that at some time stock bad been depasturing
here. A little farther and we saw some cattle tracks only a few
days old. The cattle had been feeding, so we continued on our
course through the dense mulga country, expecting to shortly
strike a pad leading to water. Numerous were the guesses as to
which way we would have to turn to go to the water. At fourteen
miles we struck a cattle pad with fresh tracks, the freshest
leading north-east. We turned along the pad in that direction,
and in one mile came to Pindeburra Well in the Warne Flats, where
a Chinaman was camped, drawing water out of a well some 30ft.
deep with a hand windlass and one 5galls. bucket to water 150
head of cattle belonging to Mr. Clinch, whose station is some
distance to the westward. At 2 p.m. we turned out, having
travelled fifteen miles. The day was extremely hot, 100&#176; in
the shade. Camp 100. Lat. 29&#176; 19' 59". Max. temp. 98&#176;,

<p><i>Friday, December 18th.</i>&#8212;Camp 100. At Pindeburra
Well. Lat. 29&#176; 20'. This is the exact latitude of Pindeburra
or Gelanding Lake, as shown on both plans. This shows that we
were not at Mount Churchman on the 14th instant, but that the
hill I saw bearing 292&#176; (from about two miles on hearing
310&#176; from the hill we had supposed to be Mount Churchman) was
the mount. As we had no particular object in going there it did
not matter. Very hot day. Everyone had good wash and sleep.
South-west breeze in the afternoon. So far as I can see these
flats are formed of a good reddish loam, with good red. clay
subsoil; red and other mulga. Put 240galls. of water in the
casks, although I understand from the Chinaman that a road leads
up the Warne Flats for about fifty miles when we shall find a
station. Max. temp. 104&#176;, min. temp. 67&#176;. At 9 a.m.' bar.

<p><i>Saturday, December 19th.</i>&#8212;Pindeburra Well. Camp
100. Calm, clear; warm night. At 5.40 we resumed our journey, on
bearing 350&#176;, up the flats. In three miles we came on the
dray road, and followed it, our camels walking along in good
style. Glad to be on a road once again. We followed up on the
east bank of the creek, with good acacias all the way, and turned
out on good feed at 1, where the track crosses and leaves the
creek&#8212;eighteen miles. Camp 101. These flats consist of
really good country, but appear to have been overstocked some few
years ago. The soil is really good, and produces mulga, acacias,
saltbush, grasses, &amp;c., and is fit for stock or agriculture.
Mr. Streich has expressed the opinion that there is abundance of
water underground, and he would not be surprised if it were
artesian. If artesian water could be obtained at the head of
these flats a splendid irrigation colony could be founded, for
the soil is suitable and so is the contour of the country. Max.
temp. 106&#176;, min. temp. 69&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.48, ther.

<p><i>Sunday, December 20th.</i>&#8212;Camp 101. Clear warm
night. At 5.35 we resumed our journey along the dray track, which
is slowing more to the north-west up a very pretty valley, with
good reddish loamy soil strewn with quartz and producing mulga,
acacia, corkbark tree, kurrajong, saltbush, and grass&#8212;a
very likely-looking country for minerals. We are just on the
southern boundary of the newly-proclaimed Murchison goldfield,
and the country is well worth prospecting. At eight miles we
passed a prospector's camp (deserted) with a tree marked
<small>T.
HAYWARD</small>,/Prospector,/1891./&#8212;&#8212;/<small>H
DOWD</small>,/Prospector,/Nov. 17, 1891.</p>
<p>A hole was sunk some 4ft. into the decomposed granite forming
the bed of the creek; very little washdirt showing. The rocks in
the neighborhood are hornblendic, micaceous, and talcose schists,
with much quartz. The soil still remains good. At 9.30 we were
due west of Mount Kenneth, distant four or five miles. At 1.40 we
turned out amongst mulga with many good kurrajongs for the
camels, a low white-looking range just in front of us. Judging by
the sheep tracks, we should not be far from a water. Very hot
day; wind from south to north-west. We passed three or four wells
on the creek, but none of them have any water in. Numerous sheep
camps and yards. Camp 102. Eighteen miles. Max. temp. 105&#176;,
min. temp. 69&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.27, ther. 93&#176;; 3 p.m.,

miles.</p>
<p><i>Monday, December 21st.</i>&#8212;Camp 102. Cold night. At
5.20 we were again on the road, which leads west for six miles
and then north-west over poor country, spinifex, mulga, sandy and
gravelly soil, quartzite, and conglomerates. At 1 o'clock, having
made seventeen miles, we turned out close to Mr. Broad's station,
and pitched our camp under the shade of beautiful casuarina and
prickly acacia growing along the creek, in which is an abundant
supply of perfectly fresh water at about 8ft. This particular
casuarina is a sure index to the existence of water at shallow
depths. This out station, nestling in Canning Hills, is I think
the prettiest spot we have seen for months. In a good season it
must be very beautiful. The hills are undoubtedly
auriferous&#8212;slates, quartz, ironstone, schists, &amp;c.
Mulga country principally. The station buildings consists of
government house, woolshed, two huts, and whip wells, 15ft. deep.
As we rode up to the station we were a source of wonderment to
the natives and children. The owner of the station (Mr. Broad)
was away with the sheep some forty miles north-east, but his wife
gave us a cordial welcome, and as it was just dinner time,
invited us to dinner; I thanked her, but said there are too many
of us, she said "Oh, well, those of you who are here come"; we,
Dr. Elliot, Wells, Mills and I accordingly dined at the station
after seeing the camp pitched. Mrs. Broad, who has four children,
has been here five years; they having bought the station from Mr.
Oliver. This is the furthest out station. They have had no rain
for three years, and natives, speaking no English, have this year
come in from the eastward and are staying about here because
there is no water in their own country&#8212;a further proof that
we had done the right thing by not attempting to push across from
Hampton Plains. The doctor neglected a good opportunity for
getting information from the natives, from those here who belong
to the country and can speak good English. Some native weapons
too might have been obtained. I was too busy to attend to the
natives myself. Mrs. Broad showed us a plan of the country from a
traverse made by the surveyors, with a lot of useful information
on it. She gave us permission to make a tracing off it in the
evening. Camp 103. Course W.N.W. I was disappointed at not being
able to get any fresh meat. There were no sheep on the station;
they had lost about 4,000 through the drought. Mrs. Broad said
twelve miles north-westerly we would find a new station belonging
to Mr. Fogarty where we would be able to get mutton. As the road
did not lead that way she said she would send a native to guide
me to the place. Max. temp. 98&#176;, min. temp. 69&#176;. At 9
a.m., bar. 28.27, ther. 82&#176;; at 3 p.m., bar. 28.31, ther.

is only a few inches deep.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, December 22nd.</i>&#8212;Wargee Station, camp 103.
Strong south-west wind. Cool and clear. Resumed our journey along
the track westerly towards Oliver's, to get through the Canning
Hills; but at five miles we turned to bearing 345&#176;, which
took us over a rough granitic country, with stunted mulga and
other bushes; abundance of the kite leaf poison plant
<i>(Gastrolobium)</i>. For four and a half miles when under the
direction of our native guide our course was changed to 5&#176;,
and we still found a most miserable country. We then struck an
old dray track, which led us rather a circuitous route, with a
general north-west bearing, through some good mulga country. At
twenty-two miles we came to a whip well, at which a black-fellow
was watering few hundred miserable-looking sheep. He told me that
it was only a little way to where Mr. Fogarty's new station was.
We followed the road for two and a half miles through high mulga
a sandy soil till we struck a large watercourse coining from
south-west. Followed it up for about half a mile, when we came to
the new station&#8212;one unfinished but and a shed. No men
about, and only half a dozen starving sheep standing over the dry
troughs, which have just been erected at a new well in the creek
bed, about 10ft. deep; very good water. The native shepherd came
after us, and I learned that the name of this well is Nalbaralla,
and the Fogartys are living at Darn, some distance west or
south-west from here. I saw a well of good water, 6ft. deep, on a
mulga flat; one well west. I am much disappointed at not finding
some men here, as I hoped to get some information about the
country, as well as some mutton. Watered the camels. The native
shepherd directed me which way to travel to-morrow to get water
and to avoid the hills. Max. temp. 93&#176;, min. temp. 64&#176;.
At 9 a.m. bar. 28.43, ther. 46&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.53, ther.
91&#176;. Camp 104. Lat., 28&#176; 38' 35". The one redeeming
feature of this country is the abundant supply of good water to
be obtained at very shallow depths. The country itself is poor
and patchy, and a great deal of the kite leaf poison grows about
the granite ridges.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, December 23rd.</i>&#8212;Camp 104. At 5.45 we
started along a dray track leading north-west to a well at four
miles; then more northerly until we met a well-beaten road
leading east and west. I rode about one mile west to Beera Spring
and found a new well, deeper than usual, had just been completed;
the troughs were not yet fixed. There was a tent with rations and
a shed with tools, and fresh horse tracks, but no one had been
there for the past twenty-four hours. Very nice country. We
crossed the road and steered north, up a good mulga valley, down
which in flood times there is a heavy rush of water. Very good
cattle country, there being abundance of top feed, besides in
ordinary seasons plenty of grass and some saltbush. Later on we
crossed two roads close together, leading east and west. At
nineteen miles we turned out on good camel-feed mulga, kurrajong,
and green saltbush. Camp 105. Max. temp. 100&#176;, min. temp.

<p><i>Thursday, December 24th.</i>&#8212;Camp 105. Warm, clear
night. Resumed our northerly course at 5.20. with an east wind
blowing. Clear sky and very hot. As we proceeded the country
improved. More grass, saltbush, and mulga granite hills close on
our left. At six miles we could see much dust in a valley a
little on our right. We turned to bearing 37&#176;, and should
reach the station in twelve miles. In nine miles, over same class
of good stock country, with a good, reddish, loamy soil, we
struck the road. I had a shot at a turkey, but did not bag him,
as I hoped, for our Christmas dinner. In three miles along the
road easterly, eighteen miles in all, we reached the station
owned by Mr. Watson. It is situated on a level mulga flat, with
abundance of good water at shallow depths. The house well is
perfectly fresh, while a well about twenty chains away is quite
salt. The station has been formed ten years. A similar drought
was prevailing then. Mr. Watson is away at Geraldton. Mrs.
Watson, who is a native of Western Australia, and has some three
or four healthy little children here, was most kind to us and
gave me much valuable information. Water being so easily
obtainable all over their run, they have had no losses from
drought, being able to shift the stock on to new country from
time to time. West Mount Magnet Goldfield is about twenty-four
miles distant. From 200ozs. to 300ozs. of gold were picked up on
the surface of a flat, and there are now over sixty men there. As
soon as the rain comes this country will be prospected right out
to the desert. Many natives have come in from the east reporting
all the waters dried up. The troopers who were sent out in search
of the murderer of young Waldeck returned a few days ago, having
been successful in capturing the fellow after a desperate
struggle, during which the man was shot in the leg. Great credit
should be given to these men, for they had a very hard time. They
had natives with them who knew the country, and report that they
went about 150 miles east and saw good stock Country. also
mineral country; their horses were three days without water and
were knocked up. Mrs. Watson told me I could get a good native
from their out station Millie Millie, north-east of Mount Magnet,
to go out east with me if I want one. This is a very good stock
country, and the settlers should be prosperous. The Christmas
bullock escaped out of the yard yesterday evening, so that we
shall only have mutton for our Christmas dinner. Max. temp.

<p><i>Friday, December 25th.</i>&#8212;Christmas Day,
Yoweragabbie Station. Camp 106. Clear, hot, E.S.E. wind. My eyes
are very weak. We shall remain here to-day. After breakfast I
went up to the station and asked. Mrs. Watson to allow me to stay
inside as it was very hot and the glare hurt my eyes. I went to
the camp at 5 p.m. to dinner; roast mutton and plum pudding. At
the station they had salt beef and plum pudding for dinner.
Cloudy, hot, thunderstorm in evening. One camel missing. If I can
find a good dep&#244;t east of Cruickshank's station and get a
dray to go to Hope's for the stores, the camels will be fit
immediately on arrival of the stores to go out on flying trips
into the desert. We then could make north-east over unfixed
country to the Windich or Weld Springs as seemed to us the best.
It will certainly be a great saving of time and distance for the
camels if I can so arrange it. Mr. Wells got some very good
information from the natives here. Max. temp. 109&#176;, min.

<p><i>Saturday, December 26th.</i>&#8212;Yoweragabbie Station.
Hot night; strong wind. We intended starting to-day, but one
camel was missing. Two Afghans and the black boy returned about 8
o'clock without the camel. They had their breakfast, and then
started out on camelback, Ned, the black boy, riding Misery. At 2
o'clock a little black boy from the station came to tell me that
he had seen a camel's track a long way out. He was out looking
for some lost sheep, and when he saw the track he was afraid and
returned to the station. I put him on in front of me on Mr.
Wells's camel. At two miles came on the tracks, and followed them
for One and a half hours, when we found the camel only about four
miles from the camp. Sent all the camels down to the acacias,
three miles away, for the night. An exceedingly hot day;
thunderstorms to the north&#173;east. Purchased at the station
3lbs. of tea, 20lbs. sugar, 100lbs. fresh meat, and one sheep.
Water is obtainable at from 6ft. to 10ft. on the flat, after
going through a shallow loamy soil and travertine limestone with
a conglomerate of pebbles on the bottom. Max. temp. 107&#176;,

<p><i>Sunday, December 27th.</i>&#8212;Yoweragabbie Station.
Cooler night; wind from south-west. Clear morning. promising to
be a hot day. The camels were brought, and we started at 8.30
along a road leading north. We travelled along the bank of a
creek in a mulga valley. Saw two shallow wells in the creek, both
containing good water. At 2 p.m. we reached Mr. Jones's station
and turned out, there being good acacias in the creek. Mr. Jones
kindly allowed us to use a hut, for which we were thankful, as
the clay was extremely hot and the mulga bushes are shadeless.
This is very good stock country. Water in one well at 10ft. and
another at 6ft., perfectly fresh, and a very large supply one
well will water 4,000 sheep. The Messrs. Jones have only been two
years here, and tell me that the natives inform them that. as
near as they can make out, 150 miles north-east there is good
country&#8212;blue gum creeks, but there is a belt of spinifex
country this side of it. No white men have been out there. We all
supped with Mr. Jones. Camp 107. Fifteen miles. Max. temp.

<p><i>Monday, December 28th.</i>&#8212;Camp 107. Clear cold
night; south-west breeze. At 5.30 we started, still northerly,
along a road, Mr. Jones going with us. At six miles, having
travelled over good country, we came to a well of good water,
with splendid prickly acacias. The doctor came on ahead, as he
expected to get sonic photographs of natives, there being,
according to Mr. Jones, about 100 camped near this well. To his
disappointment all the natives had run away into the bush, having
heard that some policemen were coining. Doctor took some spears,
wommerahs, shields and waddies from the camp. Mr. Jones stopped
at this well. He told me that we would get to a good well with a
flock of sheep in charge of a white man, and that his brother
would come on in the evening, and give me what sheep I wanted. We
followed the track, still northerly, over good pastoral country.
At twelve miles we saw fresh sheep tracks. At twenty-two miles we
came to a well of good water on an acacia flat, but no troughs,
and no one camped. We have come the distance, and there is
splendid feed here, so shall turn out. Old "tucker box" camel
knocked up to-day. The day was very hot and the stage rather
long. If we have a continuation of this weather we shall only be
able to make short stages. After watering the camels I decided
that we must rest here to-morrow for the sake of the knocked up
camel, as to travel would risk his knocking up altogether. I must
get all on the main road, and then it will not matter much if I
have to leave some for a week. Mr. Jones did not come on, but a
black shepherd came here with a flock of sheep, out of which I
took three nice fat wethers. Our dinner to-day consisted of roast
beef, rice, blancmange, jam, and milk. Some diggers passed <i>en
route</i> to West Mount Magnet. Put 150galls. of water in the
casks. Rubbly or nodular limestone. This well is only 6ft. deep,
in an acacia flat. It seems as if the prickly acacia here is an
indication of water. Camp 108. Max. temp. 109&#176;. min temp.,

<p><i>Tuesday, December 29th.</i>&#8212;Camp 108. Cooler night;
hot day. Eight more diggers, on foot, came here this morning,
carrying their swags, provisions, water, and tools. They are
going to Mount Magnet. The camels ate nearly the whole of the
night, and have enjoyed their camp to-day on such good feed. Gave
them another drink, and tied them up all night. Mr. Helms is
better. Max. temp. 106&#176;, mm temp. 68&#176;. At 9 a.m., bar.

<p><i>Wednesday, December 30th.</i>&#8212;Camp 108. Cool change
set in last night. At 5.45 we again resumed the weary and
toilsome march, over good stock country, mulga, acacias,
saltbush, dry grass, &amp;c., reddish soil, loamy and good, with
occasional patches of nodular limestone. At three miles passed a
well of good water, 6ft. deep. At six miles another well, 8ft.
deep, of splendid water, and a large supply. Paid Mr. Jones
&#163;2 5s. for the three sheep caught at the last camp. The
winding track, which was made by my old Northern Territory
friend, Mr. R. R. Cruickshank, a short time ago, still led us
northerly through a dense mulga scrub on sandy soil. At 2.45,
having made about twenty-one miles, we camped on rather poor
feed. The granite hills seemed to be two or three miles farther
on, and although I knew there would be good feed there I
preferred camping here, as I had been warned of the existence of
much poison plant at those rocks. The day was cooler; a
south-west breeze was blowing. Old "tucker-box" camel travelled
well to-day after the rest. Two more footmen on their way to
Mount Magnet camped with us. Camp 109. Height, 1,400ft. Max.
temp. 108, min. temp. 69. At 9 a.m., bar. 28.33, ther. 89&#176;;
at 3 p.m., 28.23, ther. 101&#176;.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, December 31st.</i>&#8212;Camp 109. Southerly
breeze, cool day. Resumed our journey along the track at 5.25. In
two and a half miles we crossed the granite outcrops, on the
south side of which is a small soakage just dry. Poison bush
plentiful. At seven and a half miles came to a well 8ft. deep,
with a whip and good iron troughs; good stock water. The track
then turned a little north of east, and after watering the camels
we proceeded at 8.55 over good mulga country with large granite
hills. At 3 o'clock, having done twenty-one miles, we reached
Townsend's Coodardy Station, on the main road from Geraldton to
the Murchison. A great number of diggers camped here, amongst
them some South Australians; also a spring dray returning to
Geraldton, having been up to the field with the rations I had
ordered from Esperance Bay by telegram. Soon after camping
Messrs. Elliot, Streich, Helms, and Ramsay handed in their
resignations, which I at once telegraphed to the President of
Geographical Society, Adelaide. There is a large sandy creek
here, and in a small watercourse leading into it there is a nice
soakage well, giving a fair supply of beautiful water. Camp 110.
Max. temp. 106&#176;, min. temp. 72&#176;. At9 a.m., bar. 28.32,
ther. 90&#176;; 3 p.m., bar. 28.20, ther. 103&#176;.
Courses&#8212;north seven miles, northwards to station.</p>
<p><b><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>January, 1892]</b></p>
<p><i>Friday, January 1st.</i>&#8212;New Year's day. Camp 110. At
Coodardy Station; strong south-west wind during night. Sent Mr.
Wells along the Geraldton-road to overtake the dray. A man named
Cumming, being strongly recommended by Mr. Cowan, was put on in
Ramsay's place. We resumed our journey at 6.30 along a
well-beaten road, over level mulga country; very good stock
country, and plenty of good water at very shallow depths. At
eighteen miles we crossed a splendid looking belt of mineral
country&#8212;hornblendic slates, ironstone, and quartz. At 3
o'clock, having made twenty-two miles, we turned out at the Deep
Well, which is 30ft. deep, and contains beautifully pure water.
Here we overtook Captain Pleitner, of Adelaide, and Mr. S. T.
Edwards, who had passed us earlier in the day en route for the
field. Mr. Pleitner told me that he had seen George Lindsay in
Geraldton, and that he had had to go back to Perth for horses,
none being obtainable at Geraldton. I was surprised, as I fully
expected he would have been at Moorarie before this. When
starting, one of the camels could not rise with only 50lbs. on
its back.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, January 2nd.</i>&#8212;Camp 111. Resumed journey
at 5.45. At ten miles, having passed over splendid mulga country,
I crossed a creek, in which was a well with a small supply of
fresh water. A good mineral and grazing country. I stopped by the
roadside for a few minutes to examine some rocks, when the doctor
passed me, reaching the station some time before I did, which was
at 1 o'clock. Messrs. Cruickshank extended to me a most cordial
welcome, telling me to make the station our home for a month, or
six months, or as long as we liked. They would give me half of
whatever they had. After dinner a special messenger was sent into
the goldfields for the letters I expected would be waiting for
us. This is a good station; comfortable homestead; good stock
country; plenty of good water at very shallow depths (5ft. or
6ft.) A good deal of sheep-proof wire fencing about. The day was
very hot. North wind, dusty, thunder clouds. Camp 112 was about
ten or twelve miles farther back.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, January 3rd.</i>&#8212;Annean Station. A terrific
duststorm occurred after dark last evening, followed by a light
rain, .19. After breakfast I rode around to look for a feeding
ground for the camels, which I found to be quite near the
station. When I returned, the caravan had arrived, and I informed
those who had resigned that I had made arrangements with Mr.
Cruickshank for them to stay at the station. We camped at the
woolshed. We were disappointed when the messenger returned from
the goldfields without any letters for us. In the evening Mr.
Cruickshank and Mr. Mills drove over to the goldfield, fourteen
or fifteen miles distant, and I rode over on one of the camels.
Stayed at the warden's quarters (Mr. Walters'), and met Mr. Lacey
and many others. All were most kind, and expressed their
admiration of the journey we had accomplished in the face of a
three years' drought. Camp 113.</p>
<p><i>Monday, January 4th.</i>&#8212;Nannine Goldfield. I only
visited Macpherson's claim, and had a long conversation with him.
I saw some wonderful specimens of gold-bearing stone, taken from
a very large reef. I like the appearance of the country for gold
very much indeed. I returned to camp in the evening. Day was
extremely hot, with thunderstorms in different directions.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, January 5th.</i>&#8212;Annean Station. Another
very hot day. Sent Mr. Wells to the goldfield for some stores.
Settled with Ramsay, and he left the camp.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, January 6th.</i>&#8212;Dr. Elliot started at
daylight. I busied myself with the accounts of those leaving, and
wrote to Mr. Streich, telling him that I was going into Geraldton
next day, and asking him to put in writing his reasons for
resigning his position, so that I might send it on to the
society. To that he replied, saying that he "regretted not being
able to furnish me with his reasons for resigning", but that he
"would give them to the Royal Geographical Society, by whom he
was appointed, and to whom he had sent his resignation." I also
wrote to each of them, asking them to comply with the
instructions on page 9, lines 29 to 36, of the "Handbook of
Instructions". Gave Mr. Wells instructions what to do during my
absence, viz., to go to Moorarie for a few things we wanted, and
to meet George Lindsay and Joorak. Wrote a letter for him to give
to Donald Cumming, when leaving, which instructed him to take
charge of the camp.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, January 7th.</i>&#8212;At 5.50 I started alone on
the camel we considered most fit for the journey. At eighteen
miles I camped three hours for dinner and rest for the camel. At
5 o'clock, having done thirty-six miles, I camped on really good
feed, saltbush, &amp;c. Very hot, with thunderstorms. About
midnight, Cruickshank's bullock team, loaded with rations,
passed.</p>
<p><i>Friday, January 8th.</i>&#8212;I was on the road till 4.50,
and stopped for an hour at a good green bush, reaching Coodardy
at 10.35&#8212;eighteen miles&#8212;where, as it was very hot
indeed, I turned out and went into the station, where I remained
until 4 o'clock, when Captain Pleitner and Mr. Edwards drove up,
with one of their horses knocked up. I resumed my journey and
camped at 10 o'clock in mulga, having made eighteen miles. I
spelled one hour on some feed just before sundown.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, January 9th.</i>&#8212;At 4.45 I was again on the
road, passing a man asleep. At 5.35 I reached a well of brackish
water in a salt creek. Stopped for one and a half hours on green
saltbush. The water was good for stock, and only 3ft. from the
surface. Another well, about 200yds. farther on, near the creek,
was better water. Numbers of dead kangaroos lying about. Good
feed for camels, but poison-bush growing amongst the rocks. At
ten miles passed another well of good water only 3ft. from the
surface. Met three men with horses, one being Mr. Carlyon, from
Mullewah, who told me had opened the country north of Weld
Springs, and that the natives told him that after crossing a belt
of spinifex to the north-east good country existed, in which were
some springs. He says there is good country between the tracks of
Forrest and Giles, with good waters and Springs. Intensely hot.
My camel completely fagged, and would not get up with me on his
back. At twenty-three miles came to Willara Station (deserted).
Splendid water in a well only 6ft. deep; three buildings. I took
refuge from the sun in a thatched hut. There was a very strong
hot wind. from the south-west, with clouds. I should think this
extremely hot weather must soon bring up rain. The country is in
a terrible state&#8212;even the mulga is dying, and there is no
grass anywhere. The abundance of good water, at shallow depths,
is the one redeeming feature of this country, but there is no
luxuriant growth of trees as one would expect&#8212;no gum trees,
only acacias of all sorts, with casuarinas in the creek beds,
indicating the presence of water. There is really no surface
soil, the rock being almost bare. My camel had a good camp on
green acacias (prickly).</p>
<p><i>Sunday, January 10th.</i>&#8212;During the night the wind
changed to south-east, and blew very strong. Dusty, hot, cloudy;
few drops of rain. The camel was near by. Started at 5.15 a.m.,
over saltbush and mulga country, with granite outcrops. Cloudy;
wind cooler and strong; looks like rain in the north-east. At
9.15, having let the camel feed awhile by the roadside (fifteen
miles), I reached a soakage well&#8212;my camel being completely
done up. Although there is no feed, I had to camp, and will go on
in evening. This is just about as dreary a time as one could put
in&#8212;with a knocked up camel, sixty-five miles to a station,
three days' rations in the bags, long hot day, nothing to do. I
met one man to-day, who was merely tramping along with his swag.
I envied him; for I would sooner walk and carry my swag than walk
and drive a knocked up camel. A smart shower of rain fell here
recently. The small claypans are just dry; the well is about
15ft. deep, and has but a small supply of perfectly fresh,
whitish soakage water. Jam woods, mulga, cork-bark; shallow
reddish loamy soil. Resumed my journey at 415 on foot, driving my
camel before me. After accomplishing six miles, camped at two
quondong trees, in high dense mulga; sandy soil. Looking very
like heavy rain to the north-east; wind from south-east. Pitched
my drover tent, and made all snug for heavy rain, but not a drop
fell.</p>
<p><i>Monday, January 11th.</i>&#8212;Still cloudy, and looking
like rain to the north-east. Resumed journey on foot at 515. As
the camel would not lead, I had to drive him in front of me. At
ten minutes past 8, having made ten miles, I reached a well, 8ft.
deep, in a large casuarina creek; very good water. Let the camel
go on good green saltbush. In the afternoon Captain Pleitner and
Mr. Edwards came along, and I started again, and managed to reach
a well in big sandy creek&#8212;twelve or fourteen miles
on&#8212;at 7 p.m. Captain Pleitner and Edwards camped here
also.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, January 12th.</i>&#8212;Strong wind; cool. Resumed
my journey, and in five miles came to a well, at which some
natives were watering sheep. Arranged with one of them to look
after the camel; tied the saddle, &amp;c., in a tree down where
the natives camp gave the fellow a tomahawk, and promised to send
some rations from the station (Gabyone) for him. Captain Pleitner
drove up in his buckboard buggy; I jumped up behind, and we
reached Gabyone (Messrs. Lacey's station) in the evening, having
camped for dinner at a good well. Mr. Lacey gave us a kindly
welcome, and lent me a horse for the journey to Geraldton.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, January 13th.</i>&#8212;Extremely hot day. We
stayed at Gabyone until 3.30 p.m., when we started with two fresh
horses, one of which had never seen a collar before. We passed
through mulga country with good saltbush on the
flats;&#8212;water in shallow wells at short distances apart. At
11 a.m. next day, having only stopped for about two hours, we
reached Mullewah, seventy-five miles distant. Mullewah is a
dep&#244;t for the up-country station stores, and is on the edge
of the sand plains which extend nearly to the coast.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, January 14th.</i>&#8212;We stayed at Mullewah
until sundown, when we resumed our journey, and passing over a
heavy road turned out at a deep brackish well&#8212;fourteen
miles.</p>
<p><i>Friday, January 15th.</i>&#8212;By sunrise we were again on
the road, which now became very heavy&#8212;high white sandy
undulations with sand plain vegetation. We reached the Greenough
River about 1 p.m., and turned out under the very welcome shade
of a fine eucalyptus growing in the wide sandy bed of this river.
At 4 p.m. George Lindsay drove up. Captain Pleitner and Mr.
Edwards drove on, leaving me, as I had some arrangements to make.
A Gabyone team took Joorak on, with instructions to pick up my
camel and go on to the camp at Annean. We camped here for the
night.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, January 16th.</i>&#8212;Mr. Darlot kindly
undertook to deliver despatches, &amp;c., to Mr. Wells.</p>
<p><i>Monday, January 18th.</i>&#8212;The following telegrams
were received:&#8212;"Council meets 2 o'clock to-day. Furnish
immediately any information necessary, and acquaint council of
your proposed movements, what number men, and what class men you
require." To that I replied as follows:&#8212;"Purpose working
remainder block A with light parties from dep&#244;t near
Murchison goldfields. Enough camels will be fit to work as soon
as I return to camp. Only require botanical collector and
geologist. I do not mind whether we have a doctor or not, but
must have someone to photograph. Subordinate position can be
filled. locally. No occasion send a third officer, can give
George Lindsay responsibility and charge of stores and equipage.
If geologist and collector can be here shortly would wait and
take them back with me, as much difficulty in arranging for
transport in this country. Would only have to purchase one more
horse. Men only require personal outfit, weighing say 50lbs.
each." The following telegram was received:&#8212;"Please reply
to following questions immediately:&#8212;1. Have you ascertained
if it is practicable to go inland to explore any of the blocks A
or others from the Murchison? 2. How many men do you require to
complete your party? 3. Can they be obtained at Geraldton? 4. In
the present state of the country is it desirable to reappoint
members of scientific staff? 5. In the absence of a scientific
staff how many camels can be dispensed with." To that
replied:&#8212;"From all information I can gather, in spite of
drought, I believe it is practicable to go on with the
exploration of blocks A, B, and C. Am not willing to dispense
with any camels, as by working from dep&#244;ts all camels will
be made use of. Now that we are in country where dep&#244;ts can
be formed better have all the camels in case of losses by poison
or accident. Party is now complete except for three scientists.
As stated in last wire, this is the time for rain, and showers
have already fallen in the back country. With regard to question
4 it is for you to say whether men having special qualifications
for those positions are necessary for carrying out Sir Thomas's
wishes. If you think fit we can carry on the scientific work with
present staff&#8212;say, George take collector's position to the
best of his ability. I am not afraid to undertake the geological
work, and I think I can manage the photography."</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, January 20th.</i>&#8212;I received the following
telegram from the council:&#8212;"Sub-committee on exploration
met to-day; more definite replies are required to questions 1 and
5 in telegram of yesterday, early as possible. Council
endeavoring obtain geologist and desire that all men required for
expedition be employed in South Australia. Tietkens being
communicated with; society offer him position collector and
general assistant. Exercise your discretion what goods really
necessary to take to Murchison."</p>
<p>I replied as follows:&#8212;"Waters about lat. 27&#176;, long.
119&#176;, also lat. 28&#176;, long. 119&#176;, will enable me to go
farther easterly for, say, 250 miles, relieving party with water
to follow few days later so that in event of no water being found
the party would return on its own track to a given point, where,
on a given date, the water team would meet them. Also can from
same waters go across to Mount Hosken; thence to Windich Springs,
meeting the main caravan with rations for next blocks. Same
system of working will enable us complete upper blocks, even if
we find no new waters and have to make dep&#244;ts on the heads
of the various rivers. If no scientists appointed could possibly
dispense with seven to ten camels, but in their present condition
would not be willing to do so. As those resigning have broken
their agreements, I presume I am right in informing them that
their pay ceases. and they must pay their own expenses back to
Adelaide; please instruct me. Good Queenslander now filling
Ramsay's place; no other subordinate wanted. Will be glad to
welcome Tietkens in position proposed." Later on I received the
following&#8212;"Council meeting held to day, Wednesday;
resolution moved and carried that Mr. Wells be instructed to make
explorations, if camels are fit, into block A from nearest
available dep&#244;t to that block; that Mr. George Lindsay take
charge of camp during Wells' absence exploring, and that leader
be asked to come to Adelaide forthwith to confer with council.
Please give necessary instructions and authority to George
Lindsay; write Wells fully sending him particulars of resolution,
advising him best movements after doing which, return forthwith
Adelaide, confer council regard monetary matters. You had better
make provision for payment &#163;25 each scientific gentleman
resigned, giving &#163;10 Ramsay, payment each case account
salary." I replied that I would obey instructions and leave for
Adelaide on Saturday night. The next few days were occupied in
making arrangements and writing despatches to Mr. Wells. The
following is a copy of the instructions I sent to Mr. Wells
:&#8212;"In reply to question from council I said waters about
lat. 27&#176;, long. 119&#176;, and lat. 28&#176;, long. 119&#176;,
will enable us complete block A by light parties, water team
following, &amp;c., Mr. Townsend tells me that I can make sure of
water thirty miles farther east than his outstation, and also he
will so describe the place to you and give you a native to guide
you to a place fully seventy miles further east where you can for
a certainty get water by sinking. If that be the case you will
have not much difficulty in getting about the country, for that
water should be near long. 121&#176;, and with a water team to
follow you from that water you can easily go anywhere you wish.
Remember this: if you find waters make your examination as close
and as much in detail as the formation of the country warrants.
1st. See Townsend, and get all possible information from him.
2nd. Get his native. 3rd. Start as soon as you think the camels
are fit. 4th. Leave Misery with George; he can use him. 5th.
Better take Warren and any other men you think you need. 6th.
Procure long steel drill and spoon, also small quantity dynamite,
to enable you sink wells. 7th. Joorak will remain in charge of
camels under George. 8th. If necessary you may put Mills on to
lead your relieving team with water. 9th. Collect plants, as far
as possible. 10th. In crossing hills or rocky country please
observe the strike or direction of the rocks and reefs, the
inclination or dip, and the direction of the dip (see that book
of mine, 'Mines and Minerals', by Cox; that will give you a good
idea of what is necessary). Elevation.&#8212;Carefully take
aneroid readings of all variations in elevation crossed, so that
a geological map may be constructed. Take specimens of the
different rocks met with, so that they may be classified. If you
meet with any slaty country, with quartz and ironstone, if
possible have a look round for gold, and bring specimens of all
the different rocks in the locality, specially noting the
peculiar features of the locality. George ought to reach you
about the 5th February. I think you will be able to get a good
dep&#244;t for camels at an outstation of Townsend's to the
east, where there is plenty of feed and water, with good bushes
and sheep. If so, shift to there, as camels want to be kept on
best feed available. You might be able to get away, say, the 15th
February. I will reach Adelaide about the 2nd February; say I
stay there a fortnight, equals the 16th; reach here 26th; reach
Cruickshank's 10th, and your camp, if out eastwards, on the 15th
March. That will only give you about a month clear before I am
back, so you had better not try to get across to our desert
track, but examine the country somewhat closely out to about
long. 123&#176; and up to Timperly Range, so that in the event of
waters existing anywhere there we could have a good starting
point from which to go east towards our old track as soon as I
return. That will give you as much as you can do in two months.
11. Buy what stores you require locally. 12th. Maher wishes to
return to Adelaide. Send the buggy back with him, so that I can
have it to go up with on my return. Send by him all specimens,
plants, &amp;c., that may have been left. If necessary leave
someone in charge of stores at Moorarie, but I should think it is
unnecessary. 13th. I authorise you to detain all and every
article belonging to the expedition now in possession of
scientists; all firearms, tools, instruments, chemicals,
medicines, medicine chests, &amp;c., photos. cameras, kodak,
&amp;c. If Streich chooses to come down with Maher you can permit
him to do so, but none of the others are to be permitted to
travel with our buggy. 14th. Do not forget to take salts and
castor oil with you on all flying trips. 15th. Instruct Maher
leave the horses at Giles's, nine miles from here."</p>

<p><b><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>Collapse of the
Expedition]</b></p>
<p><i>Monday, February 1st.</i>&#8212;Lunched with Sir Thomas
Elder, and spent the afternoon with him explaining the work we
had accomplished, and the behaviour of the officers who had
resigned. Sir Thomas expressed himself as perfectly satisfied
with what I had done, and told me to take a month's rest and then
go back with what officers I, in conjunction with the council of
the Geographical Society, considered necessary.</p>
<p>On the 2nd February I attended a meeting of the council and
made a verbal statement concerning the affairs of the expedition.
The meeting was adjourned until the 4th, when I continued the
statement and answered questions. I was then kept in Adelaide
waiting the arrival of the resigned officers, who intended (so
they intimated) "preferring grave and serious charges against
me." On the 8th March Messrs. Leech, Helms, Streich, and Ramsay
attended a meeting of the council, I being present, and made
statements containing their reasons for resigning. Messrs.
Streich and Helms had been in Adelaide ten days, but would not
make their statement until, to use their own words, "their
brother officers arrived, when they would all make a statement
together".</p>
<p>On the 10th March I met the council and denied the charges. On
the 14th March Sir Thomas Elder wrote the following letter to the
President of the Royal Geographical Society:&#8212;</p>
<p>"Dear Sir&#8212;I have considered all the complications which
have arisen in connection with my exploring expedition, and also
its want of success up to date, and I have also considered the
unfavorable character of the season. I have now made up my mind
to bring the exploring expedition to a close at present, in which
course I hope I shall have the approval of the. committee of the
Geographical Society. I shall hold out to myself the hope of
resuming this scientific and exploring work at a more favorable
time. As I have not lost confidence in Mr. Lindsay's management,
and still think he was beaten by the season, I propose to give
him what I consider fair compensation for loss of office.</p>
<p align="right">"I have,
&amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right">"THOS. ELDER."</p>
<p>On the 4th of April Dr. Elliot attended a meeting of the
council, I not being present, and presented a written statement
of his reasons for resigning, and his charges against me. On the
23rd June the remainder of the party reached Adelaide, and on the
27th June Mr. Wells attended a meeting of the council to give
evidence. Warren was not then examined. I was not satisfied with
the incomplete examination, as I wished Mr. Wells and also Warren
to be fully examined in every detail of the charges, and
therefore asked that another meeting might be held, which was
done on the 9th July, when both Mr. Wells and Warren supported me
in the fullest manner. Another meeting was held on the 12th July,
at which the following resolution was carried&#8212;"That after
hearing the evidence of Messrs. Wells and Warren, which has borne
out Mr. Lindsay's evidence in all essential points, the council
consider Mr. Lindsay is exonerated from the charges preferred
against him by the members of the expedition, and that the
evidence taken be filed, and the affairs of the expedition
connected with the society be closed."</p>
<p>As soon as possible after the arrival at Annean Station, of
George Lindsay, with instructions from me, Mr. Wells started to
explore the country to the eastward with a lightly-equipped
party. Fine rains fell, the drought breaking up completely a few
days after he left the dep&#244;t camp, enabling him to send Mr.
W. W. Mills back with the water casks, and to carry his
exploration out to within 100 miles of our desert track. He then
went north-east, and returned to the dep&#244;t by another
route, reaching there after an absence of about six weeks, during
which he had discovered much good pastoral country and belts of
auriferous looking country. His disappointment at finding
instructions to disband the expedition was indeed great, as the
drought had broken up and all the camels were fat and fit to go
on with the work of exploration. Full detail of his work is
contained in his journals herewith. Professor Tate, of the
Adelaide University, classified the geological specimens brought
by Mr. Wells.</p>

<p>Sir&#8212;In accordance with the wishes of the council, and
acting under instructions from the leader of the expedition, I
have the honor to report having examined that portion of block A
situated between lat. 26&#176; and 28 S. and long. 119&#176; and
124&#176; E. Owing to the short space of time at my disposal and
being without an assistant I was unable to subject the country to
so thorough an examination as could be wished. It was my
intention on returning to dep&#244;t, where we expected to find
the leader awaiting us, to suggest making a further examination
between the two routes, as shown on the map, whilst the party
where travelling en route for Weld Springs, where Mr. Lindsay
purposed forming a dep&#244;t. However, on the arrival of the
mail at the goldfields I received instructions to break up the
party with all possible speed and return to Adelaide. Finding it
would be necessary to proceed to Geraldton before I could act I
instructed the party to remove the supplies from Moorarie Station
to Coodardy, where the stores were disposed of to the diggers.
Proceeding to Champion Bay by coach I got necessary instructions
after some delay, and returned on foot to Coodardy, the monthly
mail coach having just left, a distance of 260 miles. Travelling
with caravan and those members of the expedition who were engaged
in Adelaide we reached Geraldton, and proceeded per s.s. <i>South
Australian</i> to Adelaide, arriving on June 23rd.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the country examined with an account
of each day's proceedings will be found herewith.</p>

<p><i>February 15th, 1892.</i>&#8212;Camp 113, Annean
dep&#244;t. Bar. at 9 a.m. 28.200, attached ther. 81&#176;.
South&#173;westerly breeze; 25 per cent. upper clouds. Having
received by mail from Geraldton instructions from the leader to
examine that portion of block A which lies to the eastward from
here I started making the necessary arrangements for removing
everything from here to a well situated about south-east and
distant fifty miles, where I purpose forming a dep&#244;t prior
to making a final start. Party engaged to-day in packing up
stores and equipment. The camels arrived during the evening from
a well about thirty miles north from here, where I have had them
spelling for the last fortnight on a patch of fair feed. They
look much improved, but some of them are still very poor. Bar. at
3 p.m. 28.125, attached ther. 100&#176;. Moderate westerly wind;
50 per cent. clouds.</p>
<p><i>February 16th.</i>&#8212;Camp 113, Annean dep&#244;t. Bar.
at 9 a.m., 28.175, attached ther. 86&#176;. Calm, clear sky.
Making ready for a start to-morrow; preparing loads for pack
camels. Bar. at 3 p.m. 28.125, attached ther. 99&#176;. Strong
westerly wind, clear sky, hot, and dusty.</p>
<p><i>February 17th.</i>&#8212;Camp 113, Annean dep&#244;t. Very
cold during the early morning. Packed camels and having wished
the Messrs. Cruickshank good bye, we left the Annean Station at 8
a.m. Bearing in a south&#173;easterly direction we passed
Cruickshank's Hill (trigonometrical station) at two miles, then
crossing a portion of Annean Lake and travelling over a few sand
ridges and fairly level chocolate loam clothed with mulga,
saltbushes, and grass patches, we passed a well eight miles on
western side of track with some scrubby hills to north-west. Two
miles further on we passed another well in a low flat. Reaching a
patch of good camel feed at twelve miles, which I had previously
noted, I determined to camp for the remainder of the day, there
being no feed further ahead for some distance. A recent shower of
rain had evidently fallen here; the saltbush, acacia, and
quondongs were nice and green. Bar. at 3 p.m., 28.125, attached
ther. 99&#176;; 75 per cent. upper current clouds, slight westerly
wind.</p>
<p><i>February 18th.</i>&#8212;Camp 114. Cold during early
morning. Packed camels and made start at 6.45 a.m., following a
track from Annean Station. At four miles we reached a well called
Kullkulli, where a white man and natives were camped in charge of
a small flock of sheep, which looked miserably poor, and numbers
of dead sheep were lying around the well. We watered all the
camels here. The well, as in most cases in the Murchison
district, is not more than 10ft. deep, and has a fair supply of
good water. Continuing in the same direction we were soon on the
Coodardy run, the property of Mr. E. C. Townsend. Travelling over
level chocolate soil, clothed with a dense growth of mulga and
grassy patches, we passed a short range on our left, where
another trigonometrical station is erected. At six miles from
Kullkulli Well we reached a large bare granite outcrop which
covers some acres of ground. There were two prospectors camped
here on some rockholes of fresh water. Having lunched here we
continued on, and now following along Mr. Townsend's track from
Coodardy to his far out sheep camps. Crossing undulations of
chocolate soil, clothed with dense mulga, few bushes, and little
grass, outcrops of quartz, ironstone, and slate, at five miles we
reached another patch of fair feed at 3 p.m., where we camped.
Bar. at 3 p.m., 27.980, attached ther. 101&#176;. Strong
north&#173;westerly wind, clear sky. Spent the remainder of the
afternoon prospecting.</p>
<p><i>February 19th.</i>&#8212;Camp 115. Getting started at 6.30
a.m., and following the track in a south-easterly direction over
same class of country as above described, we passed a well and
small but at ten miles. This is another sheep camp, but was not
in use at time of our visit. Two miles farther on we passed a
waterhole sunk in a large gum flat. Both these wells are of
shallow depths and the water is of a fair quality. After
travelling for sixteen miles we reached a well called
Yarra-bubba, where there is a white man camped. in charge of
sheep and two native shepherds. This is a shallow well with whip,
and it has a fair supply of good water. There being fair feed in
the neighborhood I decided to camp at 2 p.m. We watered all the
camels here, and dosed one of them with sulphur, he being very
poor and hide-bound. Bar. at 3 p.m., 28.130, ther., 93&#176;;
moderate westerly wind, clear sky. To-day we passed over a
similar class of country to that of yesterday for the first
twelve miles, then sandy soil and limestone patches with open
saltbush, ti-tree, quondongs, acacia, and red and other varieties
of mulga. There are several beefwood or "yarra" trees growing
around this well. The word "bubba" is the native name for water,
hence the name of the well "Yarra-bubba". Several of the settlers
in the Murchison district have informed me that wherever these
trees are found water may be had by sinking, and at shallow
depths. I have seen these trees growing in parts of Queensland,
but do not know if it is considered a sign of water in the
vicinity in that colony.</p>
<p><i>February 20th.</i>&#8212;Camp 116. Cold morning. One camel
strayed during the night and delayed us a little. At 7 a.m. we
left Yarra-bubba, and following a pad about east-south-east from
over level chocolate loam flats clothed with dense mulga, grassy
patches, and herbage, six miles from Yarra-bubba we passed a bare
granite outcrop with a soakage well at foot called Kyarra, a very
prominent granite rock called Barlangi lying to the south, and
about two miles distant. Continuing on through dense mulga for
two miles further we reached another whip well called
Welbundinum, at midday, where we purpose forming our dep&#244;t.
Here there is a strip of splendid camel feed about one mile wide
and four or five miles in length, the acacia (prickly), native
willow, and saltbush being beautifully green, and presenting a
pleasing contrast to the surrounding country. The well is a
shallow one, and it affords a fair supply of good stock water. A
native and his lubra are camped here in charge of a small flock
of sheep. On inquiry he informed me of the existence of a spring
or native well from twenty to thirty miles to the eastward from
here called Walga-gunya, and states that it is in the bed of a
creek which has some other waters further up the channel. I was
unfortunate in having twice just missed seeing Mr. Townsend, who
informed Mr. Lindsay of this or other waters to the eastward. My
time is too limited to allow of my going to Coodardy on the
chance of finding him there. However, the man in charge of these
natives and sheep has promised to send this native with us to
point out the waters he knows of. Bar. at 3 p.m., 28.120,
attached ther. 98&#176;; calm, clear sky. Observed for lat., and
round same 27&#176; 9' 30" S.; var. of compass, 1&#176; 17'
west.</p>
<p><i>February 21st.</i>&#8212;Camp 117, dep&#244;t. Sunday.
Another cold morning. Bar. at 9 a.m., 28.175, attached ther.
86&#176;. Moderate easterly wind, clear sky. Went out to examine
the surrounding country, and was satisfied that the camels
spelling would do well here during my absence. Bar. at 3 p.m.,
28.040, attached ther. 104&#176;. Slight wind from south-west,
clear sky.</p>
<p><i>February 22nd.</i>&#8212;Camp 117, dep&#244;t. Another
cold morning. Bar. at 9 a.m., 28.125, attached ther. 94&#176;.
Easterly breeze, clear sky. Making preparations for start
to-morrow. Sent all the water kegs to a well five miles east from
here to be filled, the water being of a much better quality for
human consumption. Killing and salting sheep. Writing letters.
Bar. at 3 p.m., 28.000, attached ther. 104&#176;. Cold, clear
sky.</p>
<p><i>February 23rd.</i>&#8212;Camp 117, dep&#244;t. Leaving
George Lindsay in charge of the dep&#244;t and camels, with
Warren to take charge during the former's absence for the mail,
taking with me Donald Cumming (whom I find a smart and useful
man), Abdul (an Afghan), and Ned (a Kimberley native), four pack
and three riding camels, six weeks' provisions, also W. W. Mills
and one Afghan with riding and five pack camels to accompany us
on our journey for 150 miles, carrying an extra supply of water
for the camels we are to keep out for the whole of the trip, when
we attain that distance. The native here (Paddy) also accompanied
us to point out Walga-gunya. We made a start at 8.45 a.m. and
travelled to Nanadie Well, which bears 87&#176; mag. from Barlangi
Rock, picking up the sixteen kegs of water, having about
400galls. altogether, and watering all the camels. We left here
at 11.30 a.m., bearing 63&#176; mag., and travelling over level
chocolate loam, thickly clothed with good stock mulga and patches
of dry grass, at three miles from Nanadie entered poor country of
sandy soil, clothed with mulga scrub (low mulga). spinifex and
few acacias (wattle bush). At seven miles reached top of rise
with ridge of granulite, with cliffs facing west and striking
south 30ft. above flats. Read round of bearings here, and
continuing on for half a mile we camped on a small patch of
acacia (wattle bush) and spinifex. Bar. at 3.15 p.m. 27.960,
attached ther. 106&#176;. Choppy easterly wind, 75 per cent.
clouds; occasional peals of thunder, travelling to-day about
twelve miles. A heavy thunderstorm passed over at 8 p.m., and
quite one and half inches of rain fell here. We all got a
soaking, having no tents erected, but I do not think any of us
objected, being overjoyed with our future prospects. This is the
first rain we have had to benefit us since crossing the South
Australian boundary. This being the season for rains here, I hope
to see a good deal more before our return.</p>
<p><i>February 24th.</i>&#8212;Close morning. Made start at 7.10
a.m. and crossed the poor sandy country at two miles, now going
over rich chocolate loam, clothed with good stock mulga, dead
grass and herbage, bearing 82&#176; mag. Crossed at five miles a
wide flat watercourse with shallow water running southwards. Then
entered splendid saltbush, acacia, willow open mulga, few
corkwoods and grass. Reached Walga-gunya at ten and a half mites.
This is a native well sunk in the bed of a creek called
Bubba-ugundi, which loses itself about four miles south-west in a
flat. The creek has a bottom of hard limestone rock, and there
are pools of salt water on either side of the well, which are
filled with mud and sand. The creek was running strongly during
our visit. I decided to camp here at midday, and give the camels
the benefit of the splendid feed along the creek. Bar. at 3 p.m.,
28.080, then, 92&#176;. Variable east wind, fifty per cent.
clouds. During the afternoon went on foot with the native Paddy,
following up the channel, taking a rifle with me. One mile from
Walga-gunya he showed me a beemarra (spring) in the creek called
Yarra-bubba; a beefwood was growing on the bank of the creek. He
stated that this was not very good water, and that it went salt
at times. One mile further on is another spring or native well
called Wallabuckan. I noticed salt patches all along the creek.
There are several beefwood or yarra trees here on south side of
spring. The creek is about one chain wide here, and two miles
further up it splits into two branches, the larger one, coming
from northward, called Partoongarra, and the other from the
eastward called Bundarra. A strip of splendid open saltbush,
about half a mile wide, extends along the creek, with chocolate
loam and good stock mulga fringing same. I fired a shot at a
turkey on our return, but did not bag it. Returning to camp at 5
p.m., I allowed the native to return, and sent by him a note to
George Lindsay. We filled all our kegs here with rainwater from
the creek. Lat. at camp, 27&#176; 5' 12" S.; well being five
chains off, bearing 225&#176; mag.</p>
<p><i>February 25th.</i>&#8212;Walga-gunya. Bearing about 89&#176;
mag., we left here at 6.45 a.m., following along course of creek
to junction; thence along the branch called Bundarra. Passed
several small pools and water-holes, the creek getting much
smaller as we advanced, thickly clothed with mulga on either side
and patches of saltbush. At five miles noticed no rain had
extended further eastward than here. Noticed we were approaching
a range, which we reached after travelling thirteen miles from
Walga-gunya. Quartzitic grit formation. Range bears 145&#176;
mag., and is 2,100ft. above sea level. Slate and quartz reefs and
ironstone in this range. which looks favorable for prospecting.
Had lunch, and here took a round of bearings. Noticed a prominent
mountain in this range bearing 135&#176;, which we steered for,
travelling over stony surface quartz blows, and reefs, dense
thickets of various mulga, jamwood, acacia, few corkwoods, and
coarse grass. After travelling five miles on this course, camped
at foot of range, finding the mountain too far off to reach this
evening. Bar. at 5 p.m., 27.760, attached ther. 100&#176;.
Moderate east breeze, 50 per cent. clouds. Lat. 27&#176; 6' 30".
The country is very dry here, and we are disappointed to find no
rain has fallen here for a considerable time.</p>
<p><i>February 26th.</i>&#8212;Dent Mills with caravan bearing
110&#176; mag., self with Cumming going to mountain. At one mile
struck a large stony creek, which bears north-east and runs out
on flats of mulga. Following up a branch of this creek (which
splits up) through dense mulga thickets and few kurrajong, rough
stony spurs and gullies, reached mountain at four miles, which is
composed of schistose rock, banded with hematite, 2,260ft. above
sea level and 310ft. above flats. Read round of angles here.
Another mountain in this range, three miles distant to
south-east. From here we could see open sandy desert country four
miles distant east, north-east, and extending long distances
towards north; mulga valley extending for considerable distance
north from here, and all around as far as can be seen. Left
mountain and overtook the caravan at four miles, having travelled
through dense mulga, spinifex, and coarse grass. At five miles we
entered the poor sandy country seen from the mountain. Dense
spinifex <i>(triodia)</i>, little low mulga, open low mallee, and
few clumps of desert gums. Reached sand ridges at nine miles, and
here noticed the range we have just left continues for a
considerable distance to the south-east. Rested here for an hour
and had some tea. It was very hot amongst these ridges, and the
vegetation was suffering very much from evidently a prolonged
drought, many bushes being quite dead. Continuing on through this
class of country for six miles, when we came upon some flat
granite outcrops, with numbers of very shallow rockholes, but no
rain having fallen here they were all dry. Seeing a few quondongs
and clumps of fair stock mulga we camped here at 3.30 p.m.,
having travelled about nineteen miles for the day. Bar. at 4
p.m., 27.875, attached ther. 102&#176;. Calm, 75 per cent. clouds.
Noticed a deal of drought-stricken mulga this afternoon, dead in
many places. Lat., 27&#176; 13' south.</p>
<p><i>February 27th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy morning. Close. Distant
thunder. Starting at 6.30. a.m. on same course of 113&#176; mag.,
travelling over sandy undulations of same miserable description
of desert country for nine miles, when we met with good chocolate
loam, clothed with a good class of stock mulga, dense thickets in
parts, jamwood, mulga grass, and saltbush patches. Ten miles from
last night's camp we reached some ridges of granulite 2,090ft.
above sea level, and hard granite rock outcrop 2,000ft. above sea
level. Took round of bearings here, and noticed apparently a
range to the north-east and trending in a south-easterly
direction. Slightly altering our course, and bearing 98&#176; mag.
for a bluff point, and travelling across country as above
described, we reached at seven miles a short range covered with
mulga and few pines. Formation of vein quartz and quartzitic
grit, with hard granite underlay dipping 25&#176; north. Bar. at 3
p.m., 27.830, ther. 102&#176;. East wind, 75 per cent. clouds.
Finding some shallow rockholes here in flat granite outcrops with
a little water from a storm that had apparently fallen about a
month previously, we camped, and started in different directions
in search of more water. Proceeding on foot to the bluff point,
which is the highest part of the range (Mr. Mills going to the
north-east, and Ned and Cumming further east), found the bluff
2,150ft. above sea level and 150ft. above surrounding flats. Took
round of angles from here. Range to the north? east now showing
plainly, and about twenty miles distant. This range extends east
for three miles and west for same distance, an extensive valley
of mulga stretching to north-north-east. Noticed from here a
conspicuous granite boulder bearing 346&#176; 30' mag., and one
mile distant. Made sketch showing the ridges of granulite passed
over this morning, with the prominent mountain tops showing in
the distance. There are some nice saltbush patches around this
range. On returning to camp learnt Mr. Mills had discovered some
more shallow rockholes at the conspicuous granite boulder above
mentioned, and the camels had managed to get a fair drink apiece;
Cumming and Ned returning later, reported having found a nice
little waterhole full of water. On examination I found it was a
hole at the mouth of a small creek which comes from the highest
part of the range, and bearing from bluff point 2&#176;, distant
about sixty chains; from conspicuous boulder 140&#176; and twenty
chains distant. It is 15yds. long, from 7yds to 4yds. wide, and
3ft. deep, in good holding ground. A black cormorant flew away
from the hole as we approached. Put all the camels here for the
night. Lat. at camp 27&#176; 16' 11" S. Bearing to waterhole
65&#176;, distant twenty-five chains.</p>
<p><i>February 28th.</i>&#8212;Thunder and lightning during the
night, but no rain fell. Leaving here at 6.45 a.m. we proceeded
to the waterhole; tried all the camels, and following along the
range to eastward and eventually bearing 113&#176; mag. over red
loam soil and sandy patches densely clothed with stock mulga,
spinifex, and few mallee. The country had been recently burnt in
places, and we saw several recent foot tracks of natives and emus
here. No rain having fallen beyond the range the country was
still showing evidence of a severe drought. At six miles outcrops
of quartz and quartzitic grit. Continuing on we entered a change
of country at twelve miles, of light-colored soil and limestone
outcropping, casuarinas, various bushes, and saltbush. Fifteen
miles from range we came upon a nice patch of prickly acacia,
large boxwoods, and saltbush. This being capital feed for camels,
we camped at 3 p.m. Bar. 27.880, attached ther. 98&#176;,
southerly breeze, 50 per cent heavy clouds. Marked a casuarina on
north side <small>L.A.W./</small>27.2.92 (encircled). This class
of country extends for some miles to the south-east and north.
Large boxwoods to north-east, north, and north-west; var. of
needle, 0&#176; 59' W.</p>
<p><i>February 29th.</i>&#8212;Thunderstorms to the south-west.
Leaving camp at 6.20 a.m., and still bearing 113&#176; mag., for
one mile passed through boxwoods, acacia, saltbush, patch of tall
ti-trees and polygonum, 1,825ft. above sea level; then tall
mulga, mallee and giant acacia (wattle), loamy red soil, and
dense spinifex. At three miles small quartz outcrop 1,850ft.
above sea level. Noticed this morning several birds, magpies,
minahs, parrots, and crows about the camp, but could find no
water. After travelling six miles we touched on edge of desert
country, with belts of desert gums, extending to south-west,
south, and south-east. At seven and a half miles ferruginous
gravel on surface, and good stock mulga. Here we noticed the
range on our left about ten miles distant, now crossing hard
chocolate loam, few acacia (wattle) and jamwoods, and patches of
good saltbush. After travelling ten miles we reached edge of
samphire and saltbush flats, with gypseous ridges intersecting,
extending towards south-east. Tall ti-tree, good mulga, quondongs
and saltbush around edges; 1,850ft. above sea level here.
Crossing these samphire flats and gypseous formations until
sixteen miles, when we again entered good red loam, clothed with
good mulga, various bushes, patches of saltbush, and spinifex. At
twenty miles entered a miserable sandy flat extending north and
south, with low inferior mulga, desert gums, and spinifex. Having
travelled about twenty-five miles, we camped at 5 p.m. on edge of
some fair mulga feed. Bar. 27.960, attached then 100&#176;.
East-south-easterly wind; 75 per cent. clouds rising to north.
The camels were tired and sulky to-night, and did not appear
favorably impressed with the feed. Lat. 27&#176; 29' S.</p>
<p><b><a name="ch-31" id="ch-31"></a>March, 1892]</b></p>
<p><i>March 1st.</i>&#8212;Cool pleasant morning. The camels
being tired last evening did not stray far. We left camp at 6.15
a.m., bearing 85&#176; mag. for a prominent hill in the range we
have noticed on our left for the past two days. One mile from
camp we struck a large gum creek, about one chain wide, with a
sandy bed and alluvial banks; bars of quartzite in bed. The gum
trees were very yellow in most places, suffering from drought. We
followed up the channel for three miles, but seeing no
probability of finding water we continued on towards the hill,
which we found four miles from camp. Formation of diorite and
vein quartz 2,050ft. above sea level and 150ft. above flats.
These hills are all clothed with low mulga and other bushes. Read
from the summit a round of angles. From here there is a good view
in all directions. Noticed a prominent mountain top in range to
southward from here and distant about eight miles, and another in
range south-south-east and twenty miles distant. The gum creek is
plainly visible for about twelve miles to the south&#173;west,
where it is lost sight of in an extensive valley of mulga. Can
see up the gum creek to the north-east for about seven miles,
when it splits up in the hills. There are many hills and ranges
visible to the north and east, mostly all covered with mulga.
Altering our course here and now bearing 110&#176; mag. we passed
some large granite boulders at half a mile 1,900ft. above sea
level. One mile in advance from here we saw numerous quartz,
ironstone, and upright slate reefs with north and south strike.
The country in this neighborhood I believe to be well worth
prospecting. Three miles from hill found specimen of wood
asbestos. Here noticed a quartz reef striking north and south,
which we could trace for quite five miles on the latter bearing,
travelling through good mulga and little saltbush until four
miles from the hill, when we suddenly came upon a small flat with
some good saltbush. Ned here found some shallow waterholes with
about a foot depth of water in a small watercourse from the
range. There had evidently been a thunderstorm here but a few
days ago, and the water was soaking away very quickly. There
being good mulga and saltbush feed all round here I determined to
camp and give the camels the benefit of it. We saw a few
waterhens on our arrival at the water, but they were very wild
and ran off into the scrub. Ned followed them with the gun and
shot two after a good walk. Half a mile south-east from these
small holes we found a larger one with a stony bottom a hundred
yards long and 18in. deep. There were several more waterhens
here, and I managed to shoot one. We found another hole 2ft. deep
and five chains long about one mile south-south-west from camp.
Bar. at 3 p.m., 27.880, attached ther. 91&#176;; south-easterly
wind, 75 per cent. clouds.</p>
<p><i>March 2nd.</i>&#8212;A light rain fell last night, and the
weather is still very threatening this morning, getting a late
start and still bearing 110&#176; mag. through good stock mulga
and patches of saltbush on red loam. Three miles from camp rain
again set in with every appearance of continuing, so we camped
for remainder of day. Outcrop of quartzitic grit, and ironstone,
and quartz rubble on the surface of rich red loam soil. A
miserable drizzling rain for remainder of day; about &#188;in.
fell altogether.</p>
<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&#8212;Very little rain during the night, and
this morning it is very dull and again raining. We will not be
able to proceed to-day. Bar. at 9 a.m., 27.960, attached ther.
70&#176;; east wind, sky overcast, and light rain at intervals. At
3 p.m., bar. 27.940; attached ther. 82&#176;; east wind, sky
overcast, and light rain falling, apparently clearing up.</p>
<p><i>March 4th.</i>&#8212;Dull, misty morning, and everything
damp. Packed camels and left camp at 6.30 a.m. on same course of
110&#176; mag. The weather was very oppressive, a heavy vapor
rising from the wet ground. We noticed numbers of centipedes
crawling about in all directions. After travelling a mile we
entered a large sand plain with very low mulga, spinifex, and
bushes. Large patches of grass where the country had been burnt
by natives. From here we saw a conspicuous granite outcrop
bearing 128&#176;. Sending the caravan on the course we are
steering, I went with Cumming to examine it. Found it about a
mile distant, and covering about an acre of ground. It is
1,975ft. above sea level and 50ft. higher than the sand plain.
There were many shallow rockholes all over the surface and up to
a foot deep. A small creek passes on east side, and bearing
south-south-west runs out on a grassy flat half a mile distant.
This creek comes from a range a few miles north-east from here.
It has a sandy bottom, and there are some large green gum trees
fringing the banks. The edge of the sand plain bears about
south-west and north-east from here. All good stock mulga as far
as can be seen outside this. The caravan cut the creek at three
and a half miles from camp. Here they found a native soakage well
in the bed with water in it. There were numbers of natives' old
encampments about here, and some recent tracks about the well.
The caravan reached the knob we were steering for at five miles
from camp, and we rejoined them there. This is a small knob of
quartzitic grit, and there are several others in the immediate
vicinity, 2,050ft. above sea level. Nice patches of saltbush
around here. Took round of bearings from here. There are
extensive valleys and undulations of mulga visible in all
directions from this point. A prominent hill in southern end of
range bearing 119&#176; mag. Altered our course slightly, and,
bearing for this hill, we travelled through granite outcrops,
jamwood, mulga, currant bush, little saltbush and herbage (dead
roley poky). At one and a half miles passed granite outcrops ten
chains to left, with two dry rockholes. Then passing through
dense mulga and grass, we reached another sand plain at six
miles, clothed with spinifex <i>(triodia)</i>, which we crossed
two miles further on. It extends at right angles across our
course. Then sandy undulations, with large desert gums,
quondongs, and spinifex <i>(triodia)</i> for one mile. Continuing
on from here through good loamy soul with stock mulga and grass,
we ascended a rise 2,000ft. above sea level, with white quartz
outcropping. Formation here of quartzitic grit. Bar. at 4 p.m.,
27.925, attached ther. 92&#176; Calm, 75 per cent. clouds, and
heavy showers falling around. Lowest flat here 1,950ft. above sea
level; still continuing on same course, over good red loam soil,
broken quartz and ironstone on surface, and slate outcrops
striking north and south, with good mulga and saltbush patches.
At nine miles on this bearing we camped about half a mile from
the hill, on some good saltbush feed for the camels. Two heavy
showers fell before we got our tents up for the night. Unable to
observe for latitude, sky overcast with clouds.</p>
<p><i>March 5th.</i>&#8212;About fifteen points of rain fell last
evening. Cloudy morning and misty rain falling. At 6.30 a.m.
proceeded to summit of hill, which is 2,050ft. above sea level,
and 100ft. above flats. Formation of quartzite and ferruginous
quartzose grit; loose rocks of vein quartz breccia around, and
perpendicular slate reefs striking north and south. This hill is
one of a range of low, scrubby hills clothed with mulga. Erected
small cairn of stones here. Took round of bearings from summit.
Noticed a prominent hill in a range to the north-east, and from
twenty to twenty-five miles distant. A small salt lagoon about
three miles south-south-east, with quartz blows showing. A
prominent isolated hill lying to the south-east, and about, eight
miles distant. Valleys of rich chocolate loam, and clothed with
mulga, &amp;c., as far as the eye can reach. Slightly altering
our bearing here and steering 115&#176; mag. for two miles, we
crossed slate ridges, dip 30&#176; to 45&#176; east, and strike
north and south. Patches of good saltbush and grass. At three
miles a low water&#173;course trending southwards, 1,850ft. above
sea level. Cork trees in bed. Five miles from the hill we entered
some splendid open mulga and saltbush country extending north and
south. Outcrops of conglomerate here. After travelling six miles
heavy rain set in and poured down, wetting us thoroughly, the
surface of the ground being 2in. of water deep at times. About
1&#189;in. of rain fell in a very short space of time. Seeing
no prospect of the weather clearing we camped, having travelled
but eight miles for the day. The country soon became very boggy.
There is good mulga, saltbush, and quondong feed here. Bar. at 3
p.m. 28.025, attached ther., 75&#176;. Sky overcast, and
south-easterly wind. Such splendid rains having fallen I
anticipate little difficulty in finding water for the rest of our
journey.</p>
<p><i>March 6th.</i>&#8212;Still cloudy and threatening. So much
rain having fallen, and apparently to the eastward, I started Mr.
Mills with one Afghan, six camels, four pairs of water kegs, and
what equipment I did not require on return journey to
dep&#244;t, and with remainder of party continued our journey,
and bearing 115&#176; mag. Half a mile from camp we crossed a salt
creek coining from the north-east and trending south-south-west,
eventually emptying into a large salt lake. Splendid saltbush,
quondong, and a few bushes along banks and about half a mile
wide, continuing on through good pastoral land of a rich
chocolate soil, flats of splendid. saltbush (open), large open
mulga, quondong, and dry grass. Four miles from camp are some
outcrops of blue diorite, 1,875ft. above sea level, with a large
salt lake at foot, 1,825ft. above sea level. This lake is about
twelve miles long and ten miles wide. There are four conspicuous
hills on the south-eastern side of the lake, and a red-colored
range a little further eastward. Took round of angles here. A
prominent quartz hill visible to the eastward. Ranges to the
north and north-east, and a prominent hill showing in a range
about fifteen miles south-east. Making a sketch of the lake from
here we continued on, now bearing 95&#176; mag., for the quartz
hill, travelling over a series of samphire flats and small
serpentine watercourses, with patches of spinifex and saltbush
extending to the northward for two or three miles, sandy banks
intersecting, with good stock mulga grass and saltbush. Six miles
from the diorite outcrop we struck a long samphire flat, twenty
chains wide, extending east and west, with gypseous banks and a
few stunted boxwoods. Good mulga, grass, and saltbush on either
side. At one and a half miles further on we crossed the end of
the flat and entered good chocolate soil, well clothed with
mulga, ti-tree (large), quondong, few pines and acacias, and
splendid saltbush. We reached the hill at ten miles on this
bearing and found it 1,950ft. above sea level and 40ft. above
base. Formation of vein quartz. Took round of angles from here.
There were two remarkable peak hills in a low range about fifteen
miles north, which formed a noticeable feature from here. Low
scrubby hills and ranges to the north and north-east. Altered
course from here, and bearing 73&#176; mag. for a. prominent
roundhill in a low range, crossing rises of limestone formation
(travertine), rich chocolate loam flats, red and other varieties
of mulga, good saltbush and few corkwoods. Five miles from the
hill we camped on a splendid piece of pastoral country&#8212;open
large mulga, splendid saltbush, quondongs and herbage on good
chocolate loam flats. Travelled for day, twenty miles. Showery
all morning and fine after&#173;noon. Saw here two wire-wing
pigeons and numerous old pads of kangaroos. Bar. at 5 p.m.
27.940, attached ther. 82&#176;. South-east wind, 75 per cent.
clouds. Observed for lat. 27&#176; 39', south. The weather for the
past week has been most unfavorable for observations.</p>
<p><i>March 7th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy morning; fine. Making a start
at 6.25 a.m. and still bearing 73&#176;mag.; we travelled over
some splendid pastoral land extending north and south of open
mulga flats, saltbush, quondong, few other bushes, dead grass and
herbage. At three miles we passed an outcrop of decomposed
quartzose felstone. We reached the hill at nine miles, which is
2,025ft. above the sea level and 75ft. above base. Formation of
ironstone and quantities of quartz and ironstone on the surface
for two miles around the hills, also perpendicular slate reefs
striking north and south. Erected here a small cairn of stones
and read angles. An extensive valley clothed with mulga, &amp;c.,
extends for a considerable distance to the north-west. Low hills
and ranges clothed with mulga scrub to the north and north-east.
This range extends for a few miles to the north and south-east
for four miles. Also in same direction three far distant tops, in
apparently a range, were visible. Leaving here and bearing
73&#176; 30' for a prominent distant hill. We were now crossing
slate rises and reefs with loose flints. Fair mulga, grass and
patches of saltbush. Crossed some shallow water-courses, which
were very boggy. Three miles from the bill, spinifex
<i>(triodia)</i> took the place of grass amongst the mulga. At
four miles we entered an intrusion of open desert country of
sandy soil, dense spinifex, few desert gums, stunted mallee and
mulga, and grass in patches where fires have been. Crossed this
belt at one and a half miles, and again met With good stock mulga
on a rich chocolate loam. Spinifex <i>(triodia)</i> and abundance
of dead grass on burnt patches. Six miles from the hill we saw
very recent foot tracks of natives and children. Ned said they
had only passed here this morning, and were travelling southward.
One mile further on were some nice patches of saltbush. Eight
miles from the bill were several claypans with water, on open
saltbush and grassy flat, with mulga. surrounding. Camped here at
and turned the camels out on good feed. Bar. 27.840, attached
ther. 98&#176;, south-easterly wind; 75 per cent. clouds, and
thunderstorms to the north-east. Here we were surprised to see a
large gum creek, which passes about a quarter of a mile south
from camp, and trends in a south-westerly direction. This creek,
which was running strongly at time of our visit, is fringed with
large white gum trees, and, opposite camp, from three to the
chains in width. The bed has large quantities of sand and shingle
of quartz, slate; and ironstone fragments. The gum trees here
were suffering very much from the recent drought the leaves being
very yellow in appearance. Fifteen chains south from the camp we
marked a gum tree on the north side of the creek, and: just in
the bed <small>L.A.W/E.E.E./</small>7.3.92. (encircled). Read
bearings from the branches of a tree, and made sketch of a
prominent hill in a short range almost due north With a
remarkable knob on southern end, and distant about six miles:
Good grass and herbage, shooting up on the plain fringing the
creek. We saw some mushrooms here. Saltbush and Mulga as far as
can be seen to the south. The course of the creek could be traced
for some miles to the north-east. Fifteen chains north from the
marked tree is a natural claypan, circular, and 3ft. deep,
100yds. diameter, with natural bank all round of red loam,
conglomerate of small pebbles in bed. Six inches of water here at
time of our visit. A large black and white crane flew from here
as we approached:&#8212;Lat. at camp, 27&#176; 34' 21" S.</p>
<p><i>March, 8th.</i>&#8212;Dull and cold morning. Getting an
early start, and continuing same course as yesterday. Following
up the channel we crossed the creek at one mile where it was two
chains wide. Now entered open mulga and spinifex <i>(triodia)</i>
on red loamy soil. After travelling for six miles passed on our
remarkable quartz blow, and another similar a mile further on.
Here we also found hard granite boulders outcropping. Crossing
open mulga, patches of saltbush and grass country, we cut a small
creek (from a high range which trends to the south-east), which
bears about north, and empties in the large gum creek, which is
about one mile on our left. At ten miles we crossed fair sized
gum creek, bearing 340&#176; mag., with sandy bottom and running
water. Having travelled eleven miles, and whilst the quart pots
were being boiled, I walked to the summit of a quartzite hill
fifty chains to north, crossing the large gum creek at half a
mile. Here it junctions with another smaller channel earning in
from the' southward. The main channel is four chains wide here,
with hard granite outcrops in the bed, which is sandy, with
quartz, ironstone and slate shingle. Ascending the hill, I, found
it 2,100ft. above sea level, and 100ft. (about) higher than the
creek. Formation here of quartzite. Read round of angles. This
hill is one of a low range bearing to the north for a few miles,
where it junctions With a larger one. Noticed mulga in all
directions from here. Three-quarters of a mile from this hill in
a south-westerly direction is a large waterhole in the creek,
with a clump of beautifully green gumtrees around it. Also a
quarter of a mile from here and on the north side of the junction
of the two channels are large waterholes 6ft. deep, and gum trees
here were very green also, whilst on all other parts of the creek
they were very yellow in appearance. Probably a permanent soakage
may be found here. Giving to the rains which have recently
fallen, I was unable to test by sinking, but formed this opinion
by the remarkable greenness of the gumtrees at these places,
acacia, corkwoods, and good saltbush fringing the banks of the
creek. Continuing en at noon, we reached the hill, on the course
we have been travelling for the past two days, at two and a half
miles. Formation of decomposed clay slate 2,125ft. above sea
level and 120ft. above flats. Took round of angles front here. A
high point in a range was visible to the north-west, about
twenty-five miles distant. Two prominent tops in range about
seven miles distant and situate east-north-east from here, the
large gum creek passing between these two tops. High tops of a
low range trending about south-east were visible to the south.
The high range we also passed on our right this morning was also
visible for a considerable distance to the south-east. Good
saltbush and mulga around this hill. All hills and Valleys
clothed with mulga as far as can be Seen from here. Bearing from
here 110&#176; mag. passed over a yellow, clayey flat, open, with
good saltbush extending either side, also needle-bush, willow,
and mulga. One and a half miles from hill good red loam with
mulga and grass. Continuing through this class of country, we
reached at six miles the southern end of a long, flat-topped hill
composed of chert and quartzitic grit, 2,260ft. above sea level
here and 150ft. above surrounding flats. Took bearings from here,
and noticed a low range about east-south-east from fifteen to
twenty miles distant. A bluff in scrubby range and isolated top
above horizon about south-south-east and twenty-five miles
distant; 20ft. below the cap of the hill selected specimen of
impure kaolin. Camped at 4 p.m., near foot of this hill. Bar.
27.725, ther. 84&#176;. South-east wind. Sky overcast with leaden
clouds, but little rain has fallen in this locality so far, and
the country around the hill shows evidences of having undergone a
severe drought, the mulga being dead in many places. Patches of
saltbush here.</p>
<p><i>March 9th.</i>&#8212;Dull, and drizzling rain. Pursuing
same course, bearing 110&#176; mag., stony ridge coming from the
hill about half to north about two miles. Passing over rich
chocolate soil, well clothed with mulga, patches of splendid
saltbush extending north and south. patches of grass and herbage,
at eight miles we passed a ridge on our right half a mile
distant, with bluffs facing east formation of ironstone, 2.075ft.
above sea level and 100ft. above flats. We crossed the lowest
flat at eleven miles, 1,925ft. above the sea level. Tall mulga,
grass, and patches of saltbush here. Loamy soil, with surface of
quartz and ironstone. Fifteen miles on our course we ascended a
high, scrubby ridge, the country gradually rising from lowest
flat to this point, which is 2,075ft. above sea level. Outcrops
of similar formation here. At nineteen miles we reached the
summit of a range of low, scrubby hills, 2,130ft. above sea
level, and extending north and south, no hills being, visible to
the eastward from here, and the country was clothed with mulga in
all directions. Continuing on over stony undulations, clothed
with good mulga and grass, for seven miles, when the mulga
becomes more open, with dense undergrowth of spinifex, and few
low mallee. Camped at ten miles from last range, having travelled
twenty-four miles for the day. Bar. at 4.45 p.m. 27.800, attached
ther. 78&#176;. Easterly breeze; 50 percent. clouds, clearing.
Rain set in about midnight, and, as we had not erected our tents,
we got a drenching. We have seen but little game of any
description since leaving the dep&#244;t. In a distance of over
200 miles we have noticed two turkeys, two lowans, a few
wire-wing pigeons, ringneck parrots, minahs, and magpies. No
kangaroos or emus, although we have crossed a few fresh tracks,
numerous old pads being seen every day. The drought seems to have
driven almost everything out of the country.</p>
<p><i>March 10th.</i>&#8212;A. strong south-easterly wind was
blowing all night and continuing this morning. Starting at 7
a.m., and still bearing 110&#176; mag., we entered desert
country&#8212;sandy undulations, clothed' with dense growth of
spinifex, open large luxuriant desert gums, few kurrajong acacia,
Poplars, and corkbarks on flats; occasional mulga thickets;
irregular sand ridges at two miles, with few quondongs. After
travelling. about six miles we reached a high elevation, 2,050ft.
above sea level, and immediately afterwards entered a valley,
which extends north-west and south, 1,875ft. above. sea level.
Further on we saw where natives had been recently grubbing in the
sand. Grasstrees <i>(Xanthor&#339;a)</i> were growing here. At
twelve miles level open red sandy soil, desert gums, forest, and
few acacia. Crossed forest at sixteen miles, and again entered
sand ridges, with red tops, occasional mulga thickets. At
eighteen miles we crossed another large valley, extending
north-west and south-east, 1,850ft. above sea level. Having
travelled twenty miles over miserable desert country we got an
extensive view to the south and south-west; the country in these
directions of sand ridges, and apparently all similar to what we
have been travelling through all day. One mile further on we
reached the highest point of to-day's journey, 2,100 feet above
sea level, mulga thickets and outcrops of quartzitic grit
extending in a south-easterly direction. Camped here at 4.15
p.m., on northern point of a mulga thicket. Examining the
thicket, where we saw a number of old camping places of natives,
I found two nice rockholes with about 500galls. of water between
them (they were full). Six chains south from camp and inside the
mulga thicket, these holes could be passed very easily without
observation. The camels all drank well here and will do well on
the mulga feed. From here we got a very extensive view to the
eastward, and I was surprised to see what appeared a large range
in the extreme distance, the top appearing round and prominent.
From a tree I noticed a low scrubby range, to the
south-south-east, about twenty miles distant, and extending in a
south-easterly direction. Bar. at 4.30 P.m. 27.790, attached
ther. 78&#176;. Strong south-easterly gale, few white upper
current clouds. Lat. at camp, 27&#176; 47' 32" S.; var. of compass
0&#176; 23' west.</p>
<p><i>March 11th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy and cold morning. Leaving
early, and still travelling over the same wretched class of
country&#8212;open sandy valleys of spinifex, desert gums, few
acacias, small mulga thickets, and quondongs. Crossed fresh
tracks of emus and kangaroos. At nine miles we reached the top of
a ridge of granulite 1,840ft. above sea level, bluff point ten
chains south. Read bearings from here, and noticed a conspicuous
range with two very high tops, about east-north-east. Made sketch
shelving the range we are approaching, and slightly altered our
course, now bearing 112&#176; mag. for the highest Point. At the
foot of the ridge an outcrop of flat hard granite rock was met
with. Eleven miles from this morning's camp we had an extensive
view to the south-east, the lookout in that. direction being very
uninviting, nothing visible but same description of desert
country. More granite boulders. outcropping here. At eighteen
miles lowest flat 1,650ft. above sea level. Then sandy
undulations and outcrops of limestone. We reached a small hollow
at twenty miles with a native soakage well at bottom. A belt of
casuarinas and corkbarks around, 1,650ft. above sea level. There
was a small patch of currant hushes; quondongs, &amp;c., here, so
I decided to camp. Bar. at 4 p.m. 28.240, attached ther. 74&#176;.
Strong east wind. sky overcast, and few drops of rain. There is a
small limestone rise about five chains north of the well, which
has a hard limestone bottom. We found it quite dry; but this is
apparently a favorite camping spot of the natives. There were
numerous old camps around and well-beaten pads leading to the
well; but none had evidently been here for a long time. Three
chains north of the well Cumming marked a corkbark tree on east
side <small>L.A.W./</small>11.3.92 (encircled). From the top of a
tree a peak in a scrubby range about twenty miles due south was
visible. High sand ridges about four miles south-west.</p>
<p><i>March 12th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy. morning and few drops of
rain. Left camp at 7 a.m., and at half a mile we entered a narrow
strip, of good stock country. Various low bushes, saltbush,
quondong, casuarina, and few mallee, a. shallow watercourse with
stiff yellow clay bottom, trending in a south-easterly direction.
One mile further in advance we again entered sandy desert
country. Open desert gums, few acacia and kurrajong, and dense
spinifex <i>(triodia)</i>. Made sketch of range from here,
showing the highest point. After travelling thirteen miles we
reached the range, the sand ridges running right up to the foot
on western side, proceeding to the summit of the highest hill,
which is 1,950ft. above sea level and 350ft. above flats,
composed of schistose quartzite, banded with hematite. The rocks
here dip about 45&#176; east, strike north and south; a quartz.
reef running north and south at foot of hill, and loose quartz
ironstone and slate around foot of hill and along the range.
Cumming in prospecting found. a specimen showing specks of gold.
The range bears 150&#176; mag. and lowers to nothing at about ten
miles to the south, and one and a half miles due north. A
prominent mountain top, three miles distant along the range to
the south. Another prominent hill in a parallel range bears
122&#176; mag. and distant eight miles. From hence the casuarina
watercourse crossed this morning can be traced for a good
distance in a south-easterly. direction. Erected a cairn of
stones on the summit and took a number of bearings, the two
prominent tops in the conspicuous range seen yesterday morning
bearing from here 343&#176; and 356&#176; mag., and from twenty to
twenty-five miles distant. The country between here and there is
apparently all of a desert nature. A remarkable small tabletop
hill and prominent bluffs in tablelands from ten to twenty miles
to north-east. An extensive valley of mulga between. Claypans and
open flat of saltbush to the north-east and one mile distant.
Sandy desert country to south and south-east, and dense valley of
mulga, east-south-east. A low scrubby range is visible to the
south&#173;east about twenty miles distant, a prominent bluff
point in northern end of high table range bearing 60&#176; mag.
Leaving the hill we proceeded to the claypans, and small saltbush
flat seen from the summit, and finding some capital feed here I
determined to camp here and allow the camels to get the benefit
of it; they have fared very badly for the past four nights. Lat.
of camp 27&#176; 58' 49" S., and of hill 27&#176; 59' 17" S.</p>
<p><i>March 13th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy morning and very close.
Getting away early, and now bearing 71&#176; mag. for the high
bluff point seen yesterday. We reached an isolated outcrop of
granulite passing to granite, at three miles 1,800ft. above sea
level and 100ft. above flats. Found here on north side of hill a
native soakage well with fresh water. Jamwood, good mulga, and
grass around here. Five and a half miles from camp we crossed the
parallel range seen yesterday, which lowers to the north-west,
upright slate outcrops striking north and south; granulite and
quartz. After travelling eight miles through good loamy country
clothed with mulga and grass we entered sandy desert country of
mallee, dense spinifex, and few desert gums, and three miles
further on sand ridges with few acacia and dense spinifex. These
sand ridges run west-north-west and east-south-east. Occasional
limestone outcrops. At sixteen miles we crossed the south-west
end of a fresh lagoon (dry) ten chains wide and one and a half
miles long, 1,600ft. above sea level. Sand ridges now much
higher, with low ti-tree and casuarina in flats. The sand ridges
get higher, and run right into the table range which we reached
at about twenty-three miles. It extends in a south-easterly
direction, and is covered with low mulga scrub, 1,825ft. above
sea level and 200ft. above flats; formation of granulite; slate
and white quartz at foot strike north and south; no dip visible.
Read bearings from the bluff point. Another similar bluff point
and red looking tablehill lying due east. Prominent bluffs in
tableland lying to the north-west about twelve miles distant. Two
prominent isolated flat-topped hills about eight miles
north-north-east. These tablelands resemble those bluff outcrops
described during our trip from Mount Squires to Queen Victoria
Spring. Country around here of anything but a cheering
nature&#8212;desert sandhills and ridges clothed with dense
spinifex <i>(triodia)</i>, desert gums, mallee, and few acacia
and bushes. Camped at 4 p.m. about thirty chains northeast of
bluff. Bar. 28.190, ther., attached, 100&#176;; calm, and 50 per
cent. dark clouds; thunderstorms around. Lat. of camp, 27&#176;
52' 54" S., and of hill, 27&#176; 53' 7" S.</p>
<p><i>March 14th.</i>&#8212;Some heavy showers of rain fell
during the night, but we saw no water lying about this morning,
having all soaked away in the sand. Bearing now 93&#176; mag. for
high bluff at southern end of tableland over desert country of
high continuous sand ridges, generally bearing 290&#176; mag.
Clothed with acacia and few quondong, flats of dense triodia
(spinifex) and large desert gums with thick foliage. After
monotonous travelling we reached the bluff at twelve miles.
Formation of granulite 1,900ft. above sea level and 200ft. above
flats. Spinifex and mulga scrub around and clothed with mulga on
top. Got a considerable view from here to the north-east, east,
and south-east, all of a most discouraging appearance for at
least thirty miles, red sand ridges being visible in all
directions. Bearing from here 87&#176; 30' mag. and over a
continuation of similar country to that crossed this morning
Camped at 4.45 p.m., having travelled seventeen. miles on this
bearing. The camels were very tired and sulky to-night. They are
poor in condition, and. have sore backs owing to the wet weather
we have lately experienced. Very little feed here. Lat. of camp,
27&#176; 53' S.</p>
<p><i>March 15th.</i>&#8212;Thunderstorm early this morning and
shower of rain. Very close and dull. Seeing no prospect of an
improvement in the country to the eastward, and being satisfied
that we are now in the Great Victoria Desert proper, I determined
to alter our course to a northerly direction. My instructions
from the leader of the expedition also necessitates my getting
back about the end of the present month. Bearing now 21&#176; mag.
and travelling over wretched country similar to that crossed
yesterday, some of the sand ridges being very steep on southern
sides. Camped on edge of mulga thicket, having travelled nineteen
miles for day. Bar: at 4 p.m. 28.140, attached ther. 90&#176;;
calm, cloudy, and thunderstorms around; var. of compass 0&#176; 7'
east.</p>
<p><i>March 16th.</i>&#8212;Continuing on same course and still
crossing continuous red ridges of sand, generally bearing
290&#176; mag., with dense spinifex everywhere, open large desert
gums in flats, few quondongs, acacia, and low ti-tree bushes. The
weather has been very oppressive for the last few days; and the
camels, being low in condition and weak, now show their want of a
drink. Camped at 4.30 p.m., having travelled twenty-three miles
for day. Bar. 28.100, attached ther. 98&#176;. Calm, cloudy, and
thundering. Latitude 27&#176; 19' S. Marked a desert gum on north
side <small>L.A.W./</small>16.3.92. (within triangle).</p>
<p><i>March 17th.</i>&#8212;Very close morning. Travelling still
on same course and over same class of country as that of
yesterday. At six miles saw recent footprints of two natives
going westward, the first signs we have seen for several days.
The country here appears almost entirely destitute of game. At
nineteen miles we camped at 4 p.m. on spinifex flat. Poor feed
for the camels, who look very wretched at present; the sandhills
and hot weather without water telling on them very much. Lat.
27&#176; 3' 20" S. Bar. 4 p.m., 28.050, attached thermometer
98&#176;. Calm and sultry, 50 per cent. clouds. From here we saw a
range of tablehills about due west in the extreme distance. I
purpose proceeding in that direction to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>March 18th.</i>&#8212;Travelling in a westerly direction
and bearing now 272&#176; mag., over same description of miserable
sand ridge country for whole of day, and approaching a high point
of table range seen yesterday. Camped at 5 p.m. at foot of sand
ridge, having travelled twenty-seven miles for day. Noticed some
tabletops from twelve to fourteen miles to the south-east. Too
cloudy to observe to-night. I am in hopes of getting the camels a
drink to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>March 19th.</i>&#8212;Very close morning, small black flies
being very troublesome. Continuing on same course, over sand
ridges, &amp;c., for three miles, when we entered rich red loamy
soil, clothed with good mulga acacia, grass, little saltbush, and
other bushes, shallow watercourses coming from the range. Saw
here recent tracks of an emu. After travelling eight miles we
reached the range, which is flat on top, with abrupt sides facing
the east, all clothed with a dense growth of mulga. Ascended the
bluff point, which is 2,170ft. above sea level, and 200ft. above
flats. Formation here of fine sandstone and white silicious
mudstone. Could not see anything from here except sand ridges to
north-east, as far as the eye could reach. There is a watercourse
amongst some gorges on the north side of this bluff point, in
which we found some shallow pools of water, but not sufficient
for the camels. Altering our course, and bearing 300&#176; mag.
from here, we crossed the range at one mile, a bluff point being
visible to the north, distant about eight miles. Continuing on
through good mulga, grass, species of saltbush, quondong and
spinifex for six miles, when we.again entered red sandhills and
ridges, clothed with dense spinifex, and occasional mulga
thickets, and dead grass, where the country has been burnt by the
natives. Here we saw several recent tracks of the latter.
Fourteen miles from the range we noticed some low, scrubby hills
at the end of same, to the north-east and distant about eight
miles. Three miles further on we camped amongst a jumble of high
red sandhills, with acacia and quondong, and occasional mulga
thickets on red heavy soil. Bar. at 3 p.m., 28.000, attached
ther. 96&#176;. North-west wind, 50 per cent heavy clouds.
Thunderstorms around. Bearing 10&#176; mag. to a red table hill
about fifteen miles distant. Every appearance of rain to the
westward. Too cloudy to observe to-night. The sandfly is very
troublesome here.</p>
<p><i>March 20th.</i>&#8212;Heavy rain fell last night; vivid
lightning and thunder accompanied it. Fully half an inch fell,
but no water was met with until we had travelled two and a half
miles, when Cumming found a shallow native well (soakage) in a
natural grassy basin, which is almost surrounded with sand
ridges. We got 55 gallons of water here for the camels, which
they eagerly swallowed. It was intensely close, and a steamy
vapor rising from the ground. Eight miles from camp we reached
the foot of another low ridge or range, clothed with dense mulga.
Here we found abundance of surface water, in a small stony creek,
from last night's rain. There were a number of old encampments
here. Half filled our kegs, and continuing on for five miles we
reached the range seen this morning, clothed with mulga, and
1,950ft. above sea level, and 50ft. above base. Sandhills amongst
and around same. Formation here of sandstone. From here we saw a
salt lake or lagoon on our bearing. At 3 p.m. we camped on edge
of mulga thicket, having travelled fifteen miles for the day.
Bar. 28.040, attached ther. 100&#176;. Calm and sultry; 50 per
cent. heavy clouds. It was exceptionally hot all day. Poor feed
here, but I anticipate finding better country to-morrow around
the lake seen in advance. Saw two cockatoos; no other game or
birds. Lat. 26&#176; 48' 42" S.</p>
<p><i>March 21st.</i>&#8212;Cold morning and easterly wind.
Travelling on same bearing over high sand ridges. Two very
prominent bluffs, facing south, being visible to the south-west,
from six to eight miles distant. At five miles two high bluffs in
a table range, about due north, from five to eight miles distant;
passing through mulga thickets, open desert gums, mallee,
quondongs, acacia, and spinifex for first four miles, then gently
undulating chocolate soil with saltbush flats, various bushes,
ti-tree, grass, and patches of spinifex. After travelling for
five and a half miles, we reached the edge of the lake, which is
1,550ft. above sea level, and at this point has 18in. of water.
Made sketch of lake from here, which extends for a considerable
distance on bearings 210&#176; and 300&#176; mag. Very narrow in
places towards the south. In attempting to cross over here we got
some of the camels bogged, the bed of the lake being very
treacherous in places. On opposite side of lake is a prominent
tablehill to south-west and two miles distant, also bluff point
four miles distant. The prominent bluffs before mentioned now
about south-south-west. Following along the lake southwards we
noticed good. saltbush, mulga, and various stock bushes around
sandhills and loamy flats, with claypans of fresh water. After
travelling about five miles, we eventually found a crossing on
arm of lake, and with great difficulty got the camels over
without their saddles, floating the kegs and carrying the
equipment across. We camped on western side on top of a sand
ridge, being all thoroughly tired this evening, having been half
submerged in mud and water for some hours. There are some low
tabletop hills from three to four miles eastward and low
tabletops south-south-east and ten miles distant. This evening
sandflies, mosquitoes, and march flies are very troublesome. The
lake here is twenty-five chains wide. Low sand ridges are visible
to the south for a great distance. Ned shot a lowan to-day.</p>
<p><i>March 22nd.</i>&#8212;Bearing from here 292&#176; mag., we
proceeded to one of the two prominent bluff points noted
yesterday, and reached it at one and a half miles. Ascending, we
found it 1,700ft. above sea level and 150ft. above flats and
lake. Formation here of silicious sandstone, covered with dense
mulga. From here we could see the lake extending southwards for
about fifteen miles, and up to five miles in width, with small
islands of sand in bed. It passes under the other prominent bluff
hill, which is two miles clue south from here. A bluff in a low
tableland about twenty miles to southward. A low round hill to
the south-west and fifteen miles distant, also bluff at southern
end of low table range in same direction. Mulga all around and
over these hills, and patches of saltbush and various bushes in
gullies and flats; patches of spinifex. Leaving the hill, and now
bearing 293&#176; 30' mag., following up a gully, and crossing the
range at one and a half miles, flat on top and precipitous
gorges, all clothed with a dense growth of mulga. At two miles
small creek, bearing north-east to the lake. Good grass along
this creek. At two and a half miles, and two miles to right, are
two isolated table tops at end of the range. Sandhills and
numerous outcrops of silicious sandstone at three miles. Seven
miles from the hill we passed a group of tabletops on our right.
A mile further on we crossed a creek coming from a bluff to our
left and emptying in lake. Chocolate soil, stony surface, mulga,
and jamwood. At nine miles we passed three low rough tabletops to
our left. From here on we crossed a number of creeks with grassy
patches and shallow holes of water, all emptying in the lake and
coming from a tableland from one to two miles on our left. After
travelling fourteen miles we reached a very prominent bluff point
in tableland. This point is 1,900ft. above sea level and about
150ft. above surrounding flats. and forms a very conspicuous
feature, the lake shore being about three miles to north.
Formation here of silicious sandstone and mudstone. Erected a
small cairn of stones and read a round of angles. From here I
could trace the sides of this tableland about six miles, bearing
south-east. A small low tablehill and another very conspicuous
bluff point in this tableland were visible about four miles to
west. A long tableland with prominent bluff points extending all
along the northern sides of the lake, and in the distance were
two remarkable bluff points, bearing 290&#176; mag. Made sketch
showing same. Good stock mulga and saltbush patches, on red loam,
between here and lake, with sandhills bordering the latter. We
could trace the lake extending towards the north-west for a great
distance. Camped about half a mile from bluff, which bears from
camp 143&#176; mag. The mulga shows evidences of a severe drought
in this vicinity. Bar. at 3.30 p.m. 28.140, ther. 95; easterly
breeze, 75 per cent. clouds. Lat. of camp, 26&#176; 46' 37" S.,
and of bluff, 26&#176; 47' S.</p>
<p><i>March 23rd.</i>&#8212;Close morning. Bearing for the
conspicuous distant bluffs seen yesterday, we crossed at two
miles a large creek coming from the tableland to southward. Good
saltbush, mulga, and. various other bushes here. At four miles
the tablelands were about one mile to left, and extending to
westward. Two miles further on we were in splendid saltbush,
grass, prickly acacia, currant bushes, and open mulga; few sandy
rises. At seven miles numerous claypans, up to 50yds. long, with
canegrass in beds. At nine miles we were still in good country,
and here passed an arm of the lake extending north-east and from
3ft. to 4ft. of water in places. Ned here shot two teal. At
eleven miles we were passing over some splendid open saltbush
country stretching back towards the tablelands passed on our
left. There were some beautiful large myall trees growing here.
Thirteen miles from the hill we crossed a narrow samphire flat at
right angles extending half a mile either side with large claypan
of fresh water at left end. At seventeen miles samphire flats and
like large creek or watercourse coming in here. We have now
apparently passed the end of the lake. We camped at 4 p.m. on
some splendid saltbush feed. Open belts of mulga and acacia as
far as can be seen around. Red loamy soil and numerous large
shallow claypans. We have passed through all splendid pastoral
lands to-day, saltbush being abundant, myall, mulga, acacia,
quondong, grass, and herbage; patches of spinifex and ti-tree
scrub on sandy soil. The range on our right which bears
south-east from the prominent bluff we are steering for shows up
well. Bar. 28.060, attached ther. 102&#176;; calm, 50 per cent.
clouds. Sandflies, march flies, and mosquitos are very
troublesome here. Lat. 26&#176; 42' S., var. of needle, 0&#176; 17'
W.</p>
<p><i>March 24th.</i>&#8212;Close threatening morning. At 6.50
a.m. we continued on same course over splendid pastoral country.
Soil of a rich chocolate loam and numerous shallow claypans. Open
mulga and bushes, saltbush, grass and herbage (munyeroo). Numbers
of small waterholes in watercourses coming from the tablelands.
We reached the prominent bluff at eight miles, which is very
steep and bold and the most southerly point of a high tableland
which is covered with mulga, 2,000ft. above sea level, 200ft.
above base, and 300ft. above lake. Formation of coarse silicious
sandstone. A natural wall of perpendicular rock from 20ft. to
30ft. deep and all along top. Erected a small cairn of stones and
read round of angles. Very prominent bluffs are visible all along
this range to the eastward and up to twenty-five miles distant,
with splendid mulga and saltbush flats along base. The lake was
not visible from here. The bluff point visited on the 22nd
instant, and also that passed early on the 23rd, being very
prominent features. Other prominent tablelands and hills are
visible from fifteen to thirty miles to the south-east, south,
and south-west, two high isolated tablehills being visible to the
west-south-west and about fifteen miles distant. Numerous
tablelands and tablehills from fifteen to five miles to westward.
A very high bluff point in a tablehill bearing 282&#176; and seven
miles distant, this tableland edge bearing 329&#176; mag. and runs
into sand ridges at about seven miles; from here open country
clothed with mulga and saltbush extending far to the
south&#173;east, mulga and thickets to the south, and open mulga,
saltbush, and grass to the north-west as far as can be seen. At
foot of this bluff and a quarter of a mile south are some small
pot holes of clayey formation in a shallow watercourse trending
towards the lake, altering our course slightly and now bearing
289* mag. for the high bluff point in conspicuous tablehill,
crossing over chocolate loam with quartz and ironstone rubble,
and outcrops of slate which appear to underlie the tableland.
Open mulga, myall, and saltbush. Two miles from tableland we
crossed a large watercourse trending south-west, and eventually
finding its way to the lake with shallow waterholes 2ft. deep.
Here we saw a few teal. At four and a half miles another large
watercourse, with claypans and grass, coining from the north-west
end of a tableland or hill two miles distant. We reached the high
bluff point of the tablehill, which extends in a north-westerly
direction, after travelling seven miles, and camped at foot of
same on a creek, with abundance of water in shallow holes along
the channel. Ascended the hill, which is 2,150ft. above sea
level, 200ft. above base, and 400 feet above surrounding flats.
Formation of sharp quartzitic grit and laminated sandstone with
white hard shale underlay. Erected pile of stones here and took
round of angles. The bluff point visited this morning appearing
very prominent with the other bluffs visited and passed on the
22nd and 23rd instants showing in the distance. A high tableland
with bluff is visible from here to the north-east and about
fifteen miles distant. Two prominent tablehills about three miles
to the southward, a. bluff point at northern end of table range
bearing west-north-west a distance about twenty miles. The creek
from camp can be traced up to this point. Open mulga, grass, and
saltbush along course, and pools of water can be seen for a great
distance. All these tablelands and hills are clothed with a dense
growth of mulga. Valleys surrounding of fair stock country, red
loamy soil, open mulga, grass, and patches of saltbush. Barometer
at camp, which bears 216&#176; mag., at 4 p.m., 27.860, attached
ther. 100&#176;; calm, 50 per cent. clouds; hot. Ned shot two teal
this evening, which is the first meat we have had for four days.
Lat. at camp, 26&#176; 37' 45", and at bluff (computed), 26&#176;
37' 30" S.</p>
<p><i>March 25th.</i>&#8212;Dull and cloudy. A few drops of rain
fell last. night. Now bearing 238&#176; mag. for a bluff point in
another prominent tableland, which we reached at three and a half
miles, having followed a watercourse up to same from camp. Same
formation as last visited. A point at the eastern end of a
tableland range, which trends west-south-west, bears north-west
from here, and about four miles distant. From here we continued
on the same course, following up a valley with large watercourse
on our right. Patches of saltbush, good mulga, and grass, the
tableland being immediately on our left. Six miles from camp we
passed a bluff point where. the tableland edge bears southward. A
mile further on we passed a small tablehill on our left, the
tableland range on our right being four miles distant, where it
terminates in sand ridges. Here we were passing over red loamy
soil, mulga, few mallee, and dense spinifex. At ten miles desert
country and sandhills, green spinifex <i>(triodia)</i>, and
thickets of mulga, mallee, and open desert gums, the edge of
desert country running east and west, the view being considerable
to the eastward. After travelling fifteen and a half miles a
group of tablehills were visible in a low mulga-covered range
about five miles south-south-east and trending in a
south-easterly direction. Continuing over red sand ridges and
spinifex flats, which were beautifully green here, open desert
gums, acacia, and quondongs for remainder of journey. Having
travelled about twenty-two miles we camped on some very green
spinifex, which was seeding, the camels being very fond of it.
Bar. at 3.40 p.m. 28.040, attached ther. 80&#176;. Cool southerly
wind; 75 per cent. leaden clouds. Marked a desert gum tree on
north side <small>L.A.W./</small>25.3.92. (encircled.) Too cloudy
for observation to-night.</p>
<p><i>March 26th.</i>&#8212;Few drops of rain fell last night.
Cold, cloudy morning. Altering our bearing here to 289&#176; mag.,
and continued on over same class of country for four miles, when
we crossed the southern end of some low stony mulga ridges. At
five miles and about five miles south we noticed a low stony
mulga ridge, extending about east and west. At nine miles we were
again crossing over very high sand ridges, the mulga ridge being
now about eight miles on our left. Crossing these high sand
ridges for four miles we entered mulga and thicket on red loamy
soil, some isolated tablehills being about ten miles distant to
the north-west. All mulga country as far as can be seen from
here; the ridge on our left now about six miles distant. At
eighteen miles low stony mulga ridges three miles to the left;
good mulga and mulga grass, suffering from recent drought. Here
we noticed many hundreds of small birds which were devouring
caterpillars from the mulga trees, the latter being stripped
quite bare in places by these pests. After travelling twenty-one
miles we camped on good mulga feed at 4.15 p.m. Bar. 28.160,
attached ther. 76&#176;. Southerly wind all day and sky overcast;
few drops of rain. To-day we saw the recent tracks of a native
with a lubra and child.</p>
<p><i>March 27th.</i>&#8212;Cloudy and cold; few drops of rain.
Still bearing 289&#176; mag. Travelling for five miles we reached
some rises of ironstone and ferruginous gravel, 1,800ft. above
sea level, which we crossed at right angles. Fairly open mulga
and mulga grass. Nine miles on our journey we saw a small
intrusion of desert sand ridges, half a mile on our left, an
extensive view of level mulga country extending southward. One
mile further we touched the edge of the sandy intrusion, which is
about one mile wide here. At thirteen miles we entered sand
ridges with acacia, quondong, and spinifex, with mulga and low
ridges half a mile to right. Allowed the camels to feed for an
hour at noon. From here I saw some higher ridges to the
north&#173;west, about six miles distant. Leaving the desert
country at eighteen miles, which extends some distance on either
side of our track, we entered red loamy soil, clothed with mulga
and grassy patches. At nineteen and a half miles we crossed a low
ridge of decomposed granulite, 1,950ft. above sea level, on the
western side of which, and about 200yds. to our right, is a small
native soakage well. Here we saw many old native encampments.
After travelling twenty-one miles we reached some splendid open
mulga grassy flats. Cumming here found two shallow waterholes,
the largest being 30yds. by 3yds. and 18in. deep, in good clay
holding soil. Geranium and munyeroo were growing here. Camped
here, and watered the camels. Bar. at 4 p.m. 28.000, attached
ther. 82&#176;. Southerly winds; 50 per cent. light clouds,
clearing. It became too cloudy for observation during the night.
We have finished all our provisions, except a little flour and
three pots of meat extract. We have been unable to get any game,
which is very scarce.</p>
<p><i>March 28th.</i>&#8212;Dull and cloudy. Starting at 6.20
a.m., still bearing 289&#176; mag., through splendid grassy flats
and patches of saltbush extending northward, and shallow
watercourses trending in same direction. Crossed at two miles
ridges of granulite, with low cliffs facing eastward; summit
1,950ft. above sea level. A small stony creek heads here and
trends north-west, with small rock waterholes. At three and three
and a half miles we crossed two small creeks, with water in beds
and trending northward. Splendidly grassed along channels, and
good flats on our right. Mulga, jamwood, bushes, and mulga grass;
white quartz and ferruginous gravel in patches of small
dimensions on good red soil. At four and a half miles we crossed
a creek with corkwoods along course, and splendidly-grassed flats
extending northwards. Here we found a waterhole, 50ft. by 6ft.
and 2ft. deep. From six and a half to eight miles we crossed sand
ridges, desert gums, mallee, and spinifex flats, extending about
two miles on either side; then mulga and mulga grass and patches
of spinifex <i>(triodia)</i> splendidly-grassed flats with
corkwoods and munyeroo. Eleven miles from camps we reached the
summit of a high mulga-clothed ridge extending east and west for
half a mile 1,950ft. above sea level and 150ft. above flats;
formation of ironstone gossan. Took bearings here&#8212;a small
range of tops from two to three miles south-west, a ridge or low
mulga-clothed. range from eight to ten miles north-west, with a
valley of open mulga. and grass between. Outcrops of quartz were
visible bearing 300&#176; mag. and about six miles distant, a low
range parallel to our course being about five miles on our
right&#8212;an extensive view in this direction for at least
fifteen miles, and apparently all of a similar nature to this.
From here passing over low ironstone rises with little quartz on
surface, open mulga, and grassy patches. Hence we saw recent
tracks of two emus followed by a native, also numerous old pads
of kangaroos. At thirteen miles splendid saltbush flats of
chocolate loam, quondongs on low red sandy rises, open mulga,
various bushes, grass, and spinifex. Numerous small salt lagoons
here. from a.quarter to half a mile diameter with good saltbush
surrounding. Could see the open country extending for five miles
north&#173;ward; it also extends southward. Here we crossed a salt
creek bearing through lagoons to the north-east, 1,800ft. above
sea level here; at seventeen miles a small lagoon to right and
watercourse coming from south: Saw number of recent tracks of
natives, and Ned informed me of their having just passed here.
Shortly afterwards, on ascending a sandhill, we surprised a
lubra, who was gathering caterpillars from the mulga trees.
Seeing she was perceived she ran away crying out to her friends,
who were evidently not far off. Sent Cumming after her, and he
soon overtook her. However. we only succeeded in showing her we
were friendly, she being too afraid and crying too much to allow
of our getting any information from her. Half a mile further on a
long narrow lagoon, extending three miles north-east; saltbush
and samphire around. At eighteen miles a belt of circular lagoons
from ten to forty chains diameter, with gypseous formation
showing around. Half a mile beyond this we entered sand,
spinifex, quondongs, acacia, grevillia, and dead grass on burnt
patches. Continuing on over miserable level open sandy country,
with dense spinifex <i>(triodia)</i> we camped, after travelling
twenty-three miles, on north side of a mulga thicket. Bar. 4.45
p.m., 27.860, attached ther. 94&#176;. Twenty-five per cent. white
clouds, warm and calm. Low knobs two miles to right of course and
most easterly point of a low cliff ridge we are approaching. Lat.
here 26&#176; 29' 17" S.</p>
<p><i>March. 29th.</i>&#8212;A few points of rain fell last
night. Close, cloudy morning. Bearing 296&#176; mag., over open
mulga and grassy flats, following up a watercourse. Patches of
saltbush. Reached the low cliff range at three miles; cliffs
facing eastward and forming a tableland, level desert country on
top. Formation here of granulite and 2,000ft. above sea level. We
found some small rockholes here. Falling from here we crossed
steep sand ridges at four and a half miles, then open spinifex
flats, acacia, quondong, few bloodwoods, few bushes and grass on
burnt patches. Now 1,930ft. above sea level. At seven miles red
loamy soil, mulga, spinifex, and few mallee, occasional flat
watercourses with grass. We reached the summit.of a low granulite
range or tableland 2,050ft. above sea level at ten and a half
miles. Patches of saltbush around here. At twelve miles spinifex,
mallee, and desert gums; dead grass where burnt. Now 1,950ft.
above sea level. Red sand ridges on either side and few large
bloodwoods. Continuing on through mulga, thicket we reached, at
thirteen and a half miles, another granulite ridge, 2,050ft.
above sea level. A very extensive view from here to the
north-east; nothing but desert country to be seen in this
direction. Again entered sand ridges at fifteen miles could see
from here a low ridge about thirty miles to the north-east; all
desert gums and mulga thickets between. A low ridge or range
about five miles to west. Sixteen miles on course a low flat
1,975ft. above sea. level. Spinifex, desert gums, and few
bloodwoods here. We reached some very high red sand ridges at
twenty miles, generally bearing north and south, 2,120ft. above
sea level at top of highest. Camped at foot on eastern side and
marked a bloodwood tree on south side five chains east of hill
and five chains north from camp <small>L.A.W./</small>29.3.92
(encircled). Var. 0&#176; 41' W. Lat. of camp, 26&#176; 22' 32" S.

per cent. large white clouds. From top of sandhill 305&#176; to
prominent tops in like end of range twenty or thirty miles
distant, lower tops west-north-west fifteen miles distant. Cliffs
bearing north and south of granulite three miles south-west from
here. A very extensive view to the southward, apparently all
desert country. Low mulga tops fifteen or twenty miles
north-north-west.</p>
<p><i>March 30th.</i>&#8212;Dull, cloudy morning. Thunderstorm
last night; about fifteen points of rain fell. Starting at 7.30
a.m. and altering our bearing to 247&#176; mag., we crossed a
large spinifex flat with few bloodwoods. At two miles we entered
a mulga thicket. Travelling one mile through this we reached the
top of a low granulite range 2,000ft. above sea level. Fairly
open and grassy country with patches of good saltbush on western
slopes. Reached lowest flat at six miles, 1,800ft. above sea
level. Granulite outcrops and small quartz on surface. At seven
and a half miles, hearing a shot from Cumming, followed by signal
shots on our right, he having followed some kangaroo tracks in
the hope of getting at them. We hatted and waited until he came
up, hoping he had been fortunate enough to kill one, but we were
disappointed to find he had lost himself in the mulga. Continuing
our journey we crossed fairly open mulga-clothed chocolate soil,
with patches of grass and saltbush; ridges of quartzite,
ironstone, and slate reefs bearing north and south, mulga, mulga
grass, and little spinifex, small saltbush patches. At fifteen
and a half miles a watercourse trending south-west, with shallow
waterholes 12in, deep and 30yds. by 10yds. Half a mile another
similar watercourse, trending south-south-east. At twenty miles
mulga thickets, open mallee, and spinifex, beautifully green, and
going to seed. Camped here at 4.45 p.m. Bar. 28.000, attached
ther. 88&#176;; east wind, 75 per cent. clouds. We saw a turkey
here, but it was very wild.</p>
<p><i>March, 31st.</i>&#8212;Dew last night; close morning.
Pursuing the same course, and crossing low rises of heavy
ironstone and flints, with flats of saltbush, open mulga, grass,
and herbage (munyeroo). After travelling two and a half miles,
and from the branches of a tree, a low long' hill was visible to
the south, from twenty-five to thirty miles distant. All low
country between, and apparently clothed with mulga, saltbush,
&amp;c. Three and a half miles on our course we passed on our
right a low round rise or blow of ironstone, about a mile and a
half distant. Splendidly-grassed mulga flats here. A wide
watercourse, with broken channel tending to south-east, with a
waterhole fifteen chains by half a chain, and 3ft. deep, with
duckweed floating on top. Leaving here and crossing rich red
loam, clothed with mulga, mulga grass, and patches of spinifex,
ferruginous gravel and loose ironstone often covering surface. At
six miles flats 1,750ft. above sea level, with outcrops of
conglomerate of small pebbles. After travelling about twelve
miles we reached a point or knob in a low range trending north
and south, with a creek passing through a gap on the north side
of knob, which is 1,850ft. above sea level. Formation of banded
quartzite and flint. The creek bears 100&#176; mag., and empties
in a watercourse about three miles distant. In the gap are
several nice waterholes from five to ten chains long. half a
chain wide, and 9ft. deep. There are several large beef wood or
yarra trees growing along the channel, Duckweed was floating on
all these holes, and a black cormorant flew from one of them as
we approached. Probably permanent water may be found here. A
higher point in the range lies about half a mile north. Fair open
stock mulga and patches of saltbush around here. A long prominent
hill bears 315&#176; mag. from this knob, and distant seven or
eight miles. Erecting a pile here, we continued on same bearing,
crossing loamy flats, low good mulga, mulga grass, and saltbush
patches. Rotten outcrops of granulite at thirteen miles, and a
small watercourse trending south-east towards valley. At fifteen
miles we reached a high point 1,950ft. above sea level. Outcrops
of white quartz, formation of rotten granulite. A high and
prominent hill was visible from here, bearing 298&#176; mag., and
from twenty to thirty miles distant. The watershed here is to the
north-west. From here very stony surface and granite boulders
outcropping. Jamwood, mulga, and little spinifex. Falling to
level, chocolate loam, mulga, spinifex, and little mallee, all
suffering from drought. Camped at 4 p.m. on open sandy soil,
dense spinifex, few mulga, acacia, quondong, and mallee; rather
poor feed for camels. Travelled for day twenty-two miles. Bar. at
4 p.m., 28.100, attached ther. 90&#176;. Calm. Seventy-five per
cent. leaden clouds. Close all day. A prominent range, and
probably the Kimberley Range, named by Sir John Forrest, is now
showing plainly in front of us, A large hill with bluff very
conspicuous, facing the south, almost on our bearing. To-day we
saw two turkeys, two emus, and a kangaroo. Latitude by Pollux and
e Argus, 26" 38' 40" S.</p>

<p><i>April 1st.</i>&#8212;A cold, cloudy morning. Slightly
altering our course, and now bearing 237&#176; mag. for the
prominent bluff point, a quartz hill or blow showing on the left.
Travelling over open sandy desert country, dense spinifex, low
drought-stricken mulga, and bushes (many being quite perished),
sand ridges on either side, at six miles we reached large mulga
or loamy flats, clothed with good saltbush, few sandy rises with
spinifex. A mile further we struck a large salt lake, edge
bearing south-east for five miles, then bearing round towards the
south-west. Attempting to cross here opposite an island we got
three of our camels bogged, and experienced some difficulty in
extricating them. The lake was dry here and 1,625ft. above sea
level. Following along the edge to westward through splendid open
saltbush and samphire for three miles, when we crossed a creek
coming in from the northward. Large boxwoods, large ti-trees,
splendid saltbush, grass, and herbage, extending north and
north-west as far as can be seen. Two miles further on we reached
the end of the lake, where a large salt creek empties into it. It
was two chains wide, and was running strongly at time of our
visit. There were a great number of teal, mountain ducks, and
small waterhens here. Leaving Cumming and Ned to try and shoot
some game, with instructions to follow us, I took the Afghan and
camels up the creek for one mile, where we found a hard bottom
and 2ft. deep, where we crossed, a large open flat of saltbush
and samphire extending to the westward for two miles. Continuing
on directly for the prominent bluff point, bearing 210&#176; mag.
Crossing an open saltbush plain and gradually ascending over red
loamy soil with loose quartz and small ironstone on surface, we
struck a nice creek coming from the range and emptying in the
lake. Corkbarks and splendid grass and herbage (munyeroo) in the
bed, which is four chains wide here. A small waterhole and a
natives' soakage well. Camped here at 3.30 p.m., having travelled
about eighteen miles for the day. Bar. 4 p.m., 28.140, attached
ther., 90&#176;; west wind, sky overcast, and few drops of rain.
The well is in bed of creek in loose sand, and near a large
corkbark tree, bearing to the bluff 210&#176; and four miles
distant. Cumming and Ned arrived shortly after us, bringing two
waterhens with them, the ducks being too wild to get a shot at.
We enjoyed a good meal off these with some boiled munyeroo.</p>
<p><i>April 2nd.</i>&#8212;Close, cloudy morning. Starting early
we proceeded to the prominent bluff, which is composed of
quartzite rock, and 2,100ft. above sea level, 200ft. above base,
and 400ft. above the lake, clothed with dense mulga. We erected a
small cairn of stones over a quartzite cliff on the eastern side.
Read from here a round of angles. The prominent quartz blow
bearing about east four miles with edge of lake at foot, the end
of the lake being about twelve miles distant in the same
direction. A group of distant tops bearing east-south-east and
thirty miles distant. A narrow salt arm or creek can be seen
bearing in the same direction from the lake's end. An extension
valley of mulga to the south-east with grassy watercourses
emptying into the lake. The range, which is low to the southward,
bears 142&#176; mag., mulga being every&#173;where in this
direction. Nothing prominent is visible to the westward. This
range bears 280&#176;, and junctions with another high rough range
trending north-east and south-west, a high bluff point showing
over the latter to the north-west, and about twenty miles
distant, a prominent round top being about due north and
twenty-five miles distant. An extension valley of mulga in this
direction, all hills being clothed with mulga. Leaving here and
bearing 237&#176; mag. we passed at two miles a prominent bluff
point in the range one and a half miles to right, crossing a very
stony surface, soil of chocolate loam, mulga, mulga grass, and
patches of spinifex for nine miles. Then edge of desert country
with red sand ridges showing about five miles to the southward.
Continuing on over open spinifex, sandy flats, with low scattered
mallee and mulga thickets, few acacia and quondongs, at seventeen
miles from the range we camped on fair bush feed for the camels,
two prominent tops being visible in the range to the northward
from ten to twelve miles distant. A few pines and bloodwoods are
growing in this vicinity Bar. at 4 p.m. 27.910, attached ther.
90&#176;. Calm; 50 per cent. large clouds. Thunderstorms around.
Very warm all day. Lat., 26&#176; 56' 30" S. Variation of needle,
1&#176; 5' W.</p>
<p><i>April 3rd.</i>&#8212;Close, cloudy morning. Altering our
course here and bearing 257&#176; mag. over miserable desert
country for three miles, when we reached a low range or ridge of
quartzite and granulite, clothed with thickets of dense mulga,
1,950ft. above sea level. Then again entered desert country.
After travelling three and a half miles we could plainly see the
two prominent points (mountains) passed on our outward track on
the 26th of February. They were bearing from here about
west-south-west. Six miles from camp we reached some cliffs in
range or ridge of quartzitic grit and granulite, 1,900ft. above
sea level. Jamwood, mulga, and little saltbush around here. Then
flats of good mulga and patches of spinifex clothing chocolate
loam. At fourteen miles low sandy and loamy flat, 1,700ft. above
sea level. Poor open mulga and dense spinifex, few stunted
mallee, low bushes, few pines and bloodwoods. At eighteen and a
half miles a prominent hill was visible about due north. We
crossed horse tracks here and also at twenty-four miles, still
crossing same open spinifex <i>(triodia)</i> flats, few
kurrajong, bloodwoods, native poplars, and cork trees. Now
1,800ft. above sea level. Low sand ridges with few pines here.
Camped at 5 p.m. on a low sand ridge, with a small mulga thicket
to the south-east, the prominent mountains bearing 199&#176; and
214&#176; mag. Travelled for day about twenty-six miles. Ned
caught four bungarras (iguana) to-day, which will be sufficient
for his supper and breakfast. We have had no meat excepting a
little game for a fortnight, and our flour will be finished
to-morrow. Lat. by Castor, Pollux, and E. Argus, 27&#176; 2' 28"
S. The camels are just about done up, being very leg weary and
low in condition.</p>
<p><i>April 4th.</i>&#8212;Cold during early morning. Altering
our course to 266&#176; mag., crossing sandy plains and low red
ridges of sand; kurrajong, acacia, quondong, grevillia, native
poplars, and spinifex for four miles. Then good red loam, tall
stock mulga, and patches of grass. Reached the range in which the
mountains are situated; summit 1,925ft. above sea level, which we
reached at ten miles. Here we struck our outward track of 25th
February, following down a shallow watercourse, with several
small waterholes in channel. Good grass patches along the banks,
and numerous recent tracks of kangaroos. We saw some teal here,
but unfortunately did not shoot any of them. We reached
Wallabuchan, but, finding the hole filled with salt water, we
continued on to Walga-gunya, where we camped at 430 p.m. Bar.
28.160, ther. 94&#176;. West wind; 54 per cent. large white
clouds. The feed here and all along the creek is looking
splendid. The camels will enjoy themselves here to-night. Lat.
27&#176; 5' 12" S.</p>
<p><i>April 5th.</i>&#8212;Cold morning; strong south-easterly
wind. Leaving Walga-gunya early, without breakfast, having
finished our provisions, we started on return to dep&#244;t,
Abdul and Ned following our outward pad back, via Nanadie Well,
whilst Cumming accompanied me to the prominent hill at southern
end of dark range noted on February 23rd. At six miles we crossed
a well-grassed watercourse trending southwards, and here saw a
waterhole which would last for two months. Reached the hill at
ten miles. Formation of schistose rock banded with hematite and
slate, 1,850ft. above sea level, and 200ft. above surrounding
flats. Took round of angles from here. This range bearing to the
north-west. Leaving here.we travelled directly for the
dep&#244;t camp, which we reached at noon. My camel fell over a
fallen mulga, and gave me a slight shaking. Abdul and Ned arrived
shortly after us. We found all well at camp. The party had been
obliged to move from the well to a higher point about ten chains
to the north-west, having been flooded out. Warren informed me
that George Lindsay had left the dep&#244;t yesterday to meet
the mail from Geraldton at Annean Station. Mills had also left,
in hope of meeting Mr. Lindsay there and getting his wages prior
to leaving for the goldfields. I found all the camels left in
dep&#244;t in splendid condition and fit to continue the work of
exploration. We were absent just six weeks and a day, and
travelled over a distance of 750 miles. To-morrow I propose going
to Nannine, to meet George Lindsay with the mail and enable
myself to reply to any communication I may get from Adelaide
should Mr. Lindsay not arrive, the time he stipulated for
returning having passed.</p>
<p><i>April 6th.</i>&#8212;Taking Joorak with me, one riding
camel each and two pairs of pack bags to bring a few necessary
stores from Nannine, I left the dep&#244;t to meet the mail.
After travelling about forty miles we reached the township at 6
p.m., the country passed over presenting a very different aspect
in comparison With two months previously, splendid rains having
fallen everywhere, doing immense good. Mr. Walter, the goldfield
warden, received me most courteously and insisted on my staying
at his quarters. This gentleman has been most kind to all members
of the expedition. The mail was due this morning, but was delayed
by rain. There is a great deal of sickness on the fields at
present. Several diggers have recently died from fever, the
nature of which is unknown to the residents. There are no
medicines and no medical man within 300 miles.</p>
<p><i>April 7th.</i>&#8212;The mailman arrived at midday, and we
were disappointed to receive telegrams from the Royal
Geographical Society intimating that the exploring work was to be
discontinued and the party broken up. Everything being so
favorable for continuing at present makes the disappointment
greater; George Lindsay having also arrived with the mailman I at
once started him back to the dep&#244;t with instructions how to
act. Being unable to settle any of the accounts due by the
expedition, or pay Cumming or Mills their wages, I was compelled
to arrange for going to Geraldton for instructions before leaving
the district; also to arrange about a quantity of goods lying at
Mullewah, seventy miles from Geraldton.</p>
<p>Appended is a list of native names which I have collected from
four tribes met with during the expedition, principally while in
the Murchison district, the greater number of which I regard as
most reliable. The system of orthography followed has, in
accordance with instructions, been that adopted by the council of
the Royal Geographical Society of London.<br>
