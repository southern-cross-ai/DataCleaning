  <h3>A "GENTLE BUCCANEER" STORY</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>Published under syndication in, e.g.:<br>
  <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide, Australia, June 7, 1919<br>
  <br>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">LET it not be imagined by thoughtless readers that the
  Gentle Buccaneers were always splashing about in purple patches. There were
  intervals between lightning streaks of lurid adventure when they sat quietly
  down round their own fireside, so to speak, and occasionally indulged in the
  dubious pleasures of introspection. Now, introspection is not always a
  pleasant thing, even to an amateur pirate, especially if he be connected with
  some ancient family and still bears upon him the rags of tradition as taught
  in English schools and universities. Even if such a man has done something
  which parts him violently and secretly from this native land, he cannot
  altogether forget the playing fields and the covert side and the glamour of
  the river. And some such thoughts as these obsessed Jimmy Graydon, otherwise
  known as Truthful James, as he sat on the deck of the <i>Gehenna</i> with the
  Buccaneers around him. And, sooth to say, Wallace, known as the Brigadier,
  was in somewhat similar case. They were both suffering from what Peter
  Shacklock, otherwise the Prodigal Son, called hobnail conscience, or an
  enlargement of the moral spleen. Anyway, they were a moody crowd, conversing
  fitfully in the absence of Endellion the Skipper, who just then was down
  below in confab with the taciturn individual who was responsible for the
  <i>Gehenna's</i> wireless. This, by-the-way, was something of a new toy, and
  had been installed on the <i>Gehenna</i> after a furtive visit to a nameless
  port in North New Zealand, where Endellion had been in secret conclave for at
  least two days with the officer in command of an English destroyer. What it
  all meant Endellion had not said. There were certain things he kept to
  himself, which is one of the privileges of the commander all the world
  over.</p>

  <p>For some days now, they had been aimlessly drifting about amongst the
  little group of coral islands, two or three hundred miles away from the usual
  base, and perhaps the slowness of the proceedings had something to do with
  the gloom which had settled upon the Gentle Buccaneers. For a week they had
  enjoyed the inestimable privilege of a lady's company on board, until at
  length they had deported Audrey Lashford and her father in a place of
  comparative safety with a view to conveying them elsewhere as soon as
  circumstances would permit.</p>

  <p>So they were lounging on the deck under the lee of a little island and
  waiting on events. They had been talking in a desultory sort of way for some
  time, and, for the most part, listening to the lamentations of the Brigadier
  with regard to the cruel circumstances that prevented him offering his
  services to a distressed motherland in the hour of her need. For the
  Brigadier received papers from time to time, and, now that their wireless had
  been installed, was not entirely outside the ring of current events.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to be here," the Brigadier said moodily.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it comes to that," said Jimmy Graydon, "neither should any of
  us."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but my case is different," Wallace went on. "I was a gunner,
  remember, and a dashed good officer, too, though I say it as shouldn't. They
  could do with me out in France now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you'd better give yourself up," Shacklock drawled unkindly. "Throw
  yourself on the mercy of the court."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it," the Brigadier groaned. "They'd know all about me in a
  week. I was wondering if we couldn't help in the great game out here."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure we can't," said Endellion as he came up on deck and
  joined the group. "If I'm right, sonny, you may be able to strike a blow for
  the flag yet."</p>

  <p>The Brigadier's face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Get on with it," he said. "You've got some deep scheme in your mind, I'm
  sure, else you'd never have shoved up that wireless. Now, then, cough it
  up."</p>

  <p>Endellion proceeded to unfold a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," he said. "Here is an old copy of the <i>Times</i>,
  which contains an interesting account of the voyage of a huge German
  submarine called the <i>Deutschland</i>."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that the boat that went to America before we came in?" Shacklock
  asked. "Crossed the Atlantic under water and got back home with a cargo of
  rubber."</p>

  <p>"That's right," Endellion said. "She used to be a pioneer, they were going
  to build a fleet of 'em, and cheat the British blockade that way. Now, this
  <i>Deutschland</i> was never heard of after the return voyage, and when the
  British unofficially claimed to have sunk her the Huns didn't deny it.
  Because why? I think I can tell you. It was all bluff. Germany never expected
  to feed her population by U-boats, however big. Her game was to supply
  submarines thousands of miles from their base with lubricating oils and
  petrol."</p>

  <p>"I believe that's right," Shacklock said. "Don't you remember that soon
  after the first voyage of the <i>Deutschland</i> certain English vessels were
  torpedoed off the American coast? That was done to get the wind up Uncle Sam.
  But still they did it."</p>

  <p>"You are very bright this afternoon, my worthy prodigal," Endellion
  smiled. "Yes, you've got it. That was a brainy idea. But no one seemed to
  spot it, at least, I thought nobody had till I met that naval acquaintance of
  mine the other day. He told me that the <i>Deutschland</i> was never sunk at
  all. She's knocking about in these seas feeding the U-boats responsible for
  the sinking of shipping in the Bay of Bengal. And somewhere, on one of these
  coral islands here, is a vast store of 'juice' ready for the
  <i>Deutschland</i> when she wants it. And now you understand why I was
  closeted for two days with a certain naval officer and why we had that
  wireless installed. Boys, the <i>Deutschland</i> is not far off, and if we
  can down her then I reckon we shall have struck a blow for the old flag that
  we can be proud of. What says the Brigadier?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Brigadier's willing enough," Wallace replied grimly. "But where,
  precisely, do I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose you can still handle a four-inch gun," Endellion said.
  "Don't forget that we have got a couple on board."</p>

  <p>The Brigadier's eyes lighted up.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten nothing," he said. "I guess I'm as good a shot as ever I
  was. Give me a clear horizon, and the <i>Deutschland</i>, and I'll sink her
  at four miles in as many shots, or for ever hold my peace. Now, then,
  commodore, what's the little scheme?"</p>

  <p>They talked on for an hour or so as they lay in that little bay until
  presently round the headland appeared a rowing boat with four men aboard. It
  was clear that the <i>Gehenna</i> was their destination, for they pulled
  straight to the side and presently two men scrambled on her deck. At the
  sight of one of them Endellion stuck his glass in his eye and for once in his
  life appeared to be almost astonished.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, it's Billy Hutton," he said. "Now what does that infernal
  rascal want here?"</p>

  <p>The big man with the huge black beard came smilingly across the deck in
  Endellion's direction with the air of one who is sure of his welcome, and
  serene in the knowledge that there was no enmity between them.</p>

  <p>"Didn't expect to see me, eh?" he said. "Well, Billy Hutton never bore no
  malice. You downed me in fair fight right enough, and I'm too big a man not
  to admit it."</p>

  <p>"That's very nice of you," Endellion said sweetly. "Now what can I do for
  you, Mr. Hutton?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, we're both Englishmen," Hutton said. "And I thought there
  being a war on, as you might like to help me. That is, me and my friend here.
  Mr. Franks, the great naturalist. Let me introduce him."</p>

  <p>The man called Franks brought his heels together and bowed stiffly from
  the waist. He was of middle age, stiffly built, and looking every inch of him
  as hard as nails, as he removed his cap he disclosed a close-cropped head of
  grey hair that stood up right from a forehead absolutely square. He spoke
  pleasantly enough, his English refined and correct.</p>

  <p>"What my friend Mr. Hutton says is quite right," he said. "I am a
  naturalist connected with the Museum of South Kensington. Unfortunately, some
  of my specimen cases were capsized into a place where the water is too deep
  to recover them, that is, without injury to the tin cases. So I thought, we
  might be able to pump the little lagoon dry and recover them, without rough
  handling. Mr. Hutton has a high pressure pump, but no armored hose. I thought
  perhaps you might be able to supply the deficiency. We only want it for a day
  or two."</p>

  <p>"I dare say I could," Endellion drawled. "On second thoughts, I am quite
  sure I can. And I shall be happy to deliver the hose anywhere you want."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is very good of you," Franks said. "It is not very far away. On
  the north-west of the island there are three palm trees and there the coral
  reef sheers away into deep water. The lagoon is just behind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Endellion said. "I will see that you have the
  stuff tomorrow morning. In fact, I'll take it myself. Will forty fathoms be
  sufficient?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Franks was of the opinion that it would be more than ample. He was
  exceedingly sorry to trouble Mr. Endellion and was overwhelmed with the
  latter's kindness. He partook of the whisky and soda and cigars hospitably
  produced by Endellion, and after a further exchange of compliments left the
  deck of the <i>Gehenna</i> in the wake of the grinning Hutton.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of that?" Graydon asked. "What's the game,
  Skipper?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Endellion said thoughtfully. "Perhaps I shall be able to
  tell you more about it after I have delivered the goods to-morrow. But Billy
  Hutton is hardly the sort of man to go out of his way to help a harmless
  naturalist."</p>

  <p>"Naturalist, be damned," Shacklock exclaimed. "Why, that man's a German
  officer. He's got it written all over him. And see how he stood. Did you see
  how he brought his heels together and bowed from his waist? Why, another
  second and he would have given us a salute."</p>

  <p>"A regular man of the world, the Prodigal Son," Wallace laughed. "What
  makes you so sure, old chap?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have seen the tribe before," Shacklock grinned. "During my
  brief but brilliant career in the United States I put in a few months at West
  Point, and there we had a dozen or more retired German officers. They were
  quite a cult with us at one time. Oh, I am sure I am right."</p>

  <p>"And so am I," Endellion said curtly. "That chap's a German naval officer,
  and Billy Hutton's in his pay. Now, what I make of it is this. We are almost
  on the top of a big petrol store and unless I'm greatly mistaken the
  <i>Deutschland</i> is coming here before long to fill up. That's what they
  want the armored hose for. They have lost theirs, or they haven't got enough.
  The whole thing's plain as a pikestaff. The oil is hidden just round the
  headland yonder so that it can be pumped straight into the submarine. You
  heard what our quasi- naturalist said about the edge of the island where the
  reef sheers into deep water. Well, there you are, and within the next
  eight-and-forty hours the biggest submarine in the world will be here. Now,
  if we can down that boat I guess we can stop all these raids on shipping in
  the Indian Ocean. At least, that's my idea, and that was the idea of the
  Naval Lieutenant who shall be nameless. And there's no time to be lost. We'll
  just get out to sea as soon as the tide turns."</p>

  <p>"You've got a scheme?" the brigadier asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"More than one," Endellion said. "But with any luck one will be enough.
  Now then, lads, jump about a bit. Take a boat, two of you, and dump down that
  armored hose on the spot indicated by the gentle Mr. Franks. And, whatever
  you do, don't go prospecting around. Just chuck the stuff on shore and come
  away."</p>

  <p>Nightfall saw the <i>Gehenna</i> out at sea steering an erratic course
  till dawn, when she ran alongside a dirty, dilapidated tramp steamer that was
  at once a byword and a laughing-stock in the whole of those tropical seas.
  She was dirty and dingy and rusty and slow, a veritable mollusk of the ocean
  creeping from port to port and floating more by the grace of God than
  anything else. A grimy-looking individual behind a short pipe grunted
  something in response to Endellion's hail. As far as the eye could see there
  was no sign of a sail anywhere.</p>

  <p>"That you, Gunter?" Endellion asked.</p>

  <p>"Tain't nobody else," the man behind the black pipe grunted. "What will
  you be wantin' with me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, come on board and I'll tell you," Endellion replied. "We've still
  got a bottle or two of whisky left."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the skipper of the tramp <i>Sardonyx</i> lounged on the
  spotless deck of the <i>Gehenna</i>. After his fourth excursion in the
  direction of the whisky bottle he began to listen more complacently to the
  proposal that Endellion had to make. Briefly, it was this.</p>

  <p>For a valuable consideration Mr. Gunter contracted to hand over the
  <i>Sardonyx</i> to the crew of the <i>Gehenna</i> and take himself modestly
  away, with his men to one of the little islands in the neighborhood where
  they were to remain hidden for a week. And, meanwhile, the <i>Gehenna</i>
  would anchor up in one of the many tiny harbours, not only as a guarantee of
  good faith, but as an earnest that both tobacco and whisky would be plentiful
  so far as the voluntary prisoners were concerned. And if anything happened to
  the <i>Sardonyx</i> then Endellion contracted to make good the loss. And as
  he was known in those seas as a man of his word, and as he was recognised as
  a man of substance, Gunter raised no further objections.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," he said. "You can sink the confounded old hooker
  if you like. If I can get a new boat out of this business I shall be well
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>These high diplomatic arrangements having been completed, the two boats
  lay side by side in a little land-locked harbour far away from all prying
  eyes, and for the next few hours the two crews worked harder than they had
  ever worked in their lives before. By sunset the wireless installation of the
  <i>Gehenna</i> had been transferred to the <i>Sardonyx</i>, and so, also, had
  the two four- inch guns. And the crew of the <i>Gehenna</i>, who were
  crawling about the deck of the <i>Sardonyx</i> like so many lice, were
  transformed out of all recognition, too. Gone were their smart uniforms, gone
  all semblance of discipline and order, and in the place of a smart collection
  of sailormen appeared a lounging set of deck hands, sullen almost to the
  verge of mutiny. It was a fine piece of stage work, and Endellion was
  naturally proud of it. But there was a method behind all this, despite the
  grease and dirt, and the blackened, visages. And so the <i>Sardonyx</i> crept
  across the surface of the waters, a greasy dingy oily outrage on the face of
  the ocean. It was, in the language of Graydon, who had a pretty turn for
  metaphor, like a squashed blue-bottle flattened out on the surface of a
  marine landscape.</p>

  <p>The one individual who viewed the whole scene with an indifference born of
  familiarity was Gunter, the owner of the <i>Sardonyx</i>, who had been taken
  on board at the last moment, or so he thought, though this was part of
  Endellion's strategy. It had been no part of his scheme to let the grimy
  little Welshman into the secret until they were afloat. Not that Gunter
  minded, for the little man was quite a patriot in his way, especially when
  patriotism and pocket walked hand in hand, so to speak.</p>

  <p>"So that's the game, whatever, Mr. Endellion," he said. "Well you can
  count me in, look you. And if the old tub goes down, why you'll just make it
  good."</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," Endellion said.</p>

  <p>"And if there is any trouble with that man Hutton, then I'll ask you to
  see me through. For it is not likely that these parts will be healthy for me
  in future."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Endellion laughed. "You'll get well paid, and if
  this little stunt turns up trumps I don't think you will find the Admiralty
  likely to be stingy. Why you ought to be able to retire out of this
  business."</p>

  <p>Gunter responded that he wanted nothing better. He had done fairly well
  with that rusty old barge of his, and, if he could see a further thousand or
  two, had made up his mind to settle down somewhere in New Zealand and devote
  the balance of his existence to the intensive culture of vegetables. There
  was evidently a vein of poetry in the little man.</p>

  <p>And so for the next twelve hours the <i>Sardonyx</i> blundered along,
  whilst miracles were being wrought on her deck. The dingy, dirty-faced crew
  worked like heroes until at length the two 4-in. guns were in place and
  trained almost to Wallace's satisfaction. To a certain extent he had had to
  make bricks without straw. He had rigged up iron sheeting and steel plates
  and bolts until a couple of fairly efficient platforms had been made. These
  he eyed dubiously.</p>

  <p>"I hope they will be all right," he said. "Though I has ma doots. If those
  guns break loose they'll shake the guts out of this old barge. Well, we'll
  hope for the best."</p>

  <p>So they drifted on through the night, apparently without aim or direction,
  until at length they fetched up to the lee of the coral reef where
  Endellion's crew had dumped down the armored hose. They were lying some three
  miles away from a clump of palms that marked the spot, lying lazily in the
  trough of a silver sea with steam oozing out of every joint of the
  <i>Sardonyx</i>. It was as if something had gone wrong with the rotten
  engines, a complete breakdown leaving it at the mercy of any storm that came
  along. The <i>Sardonyx</i> lay there, a pathetic object, and, at the same
  time, an object of proper contempt for any craft worthy of the name. Any
  passing boat familiar with those seas would have known at once that here was
  the <i>Sardonyx</i> in trouble, again waiting pathetically for a tow, or, in
  the alternative, going down to the bottom, where she should have been long
  ago. She was flying a distress signal, and apparently her crew were resigned
  to despair. A more pathetic, lamentable spectacle had never blotted the South
  Pacific.</p>

  <p>All this to the outward eye, at least. But the grimy crew with their
  blackened faces and the temporary commander who might have just finished
  crawling up the funnel, were eagerly watching with keen eyes for the first
  sign of life on the edge of the coral reef. Endellion stood by the rail with
  a pair of powerful glasses to his eyes. And there he watched hour after hour
  until at length his patience was rewarded.</p>

  <p>He saw a boat beached on the sand from which two men emerged dragging a
  box after them. Then he made out clearly enough the big burly figure of Billy
  Hutton and the trim, square-built man who could have been none else than the
  pseudo-naturalist, who called himself Franks. For a little time the two
  busied themselves, until presently the <i>Sardonyx</i> dawned upon them.
  Apparently this vision of beauty was rather disturbing to Franks, for he
  pointed it out to his companion, and an earnest conversation apparently
  followed. Then the motor boat slid out to the sea again with Hutton upon it,
  and a little later swept round under the counter of the derelict. Hutton
  hailed her.</p>

  <p>At a sign from Endellion, Gunter lounged forward and stood with his elbows
  on the rail. The rest of the crew followed with a certain moody
  indifference.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" Hutton asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual, look you," Gunter said. "Engine trouble whatever."</p>

  <p>Then followed some jargon in the language of machinery to which Hutton
  listened with polite indifference.</p>

  <p>"I can't do anything for you yet, old man," he said. "I am rather busy
  over yonder for an hour or two, and if you can keep going till night I'll
  arrange a tow for you. The usual terms, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The Welshman indicated that it was all the same to him, and Hutton steamed
  off again, apparently quite easy in his mind and suspecting no mischief.
  There was no time to be lost, and, in any case, it did not matter. The crew
  of the <i>Sardonyx</i> were too far away to take in any details, and even if
  they knew what was going on it would be out of their power to do anything
  till the big grey raider was at sea again. And so another hour or two passed,
  until suddenly Endellion emitted a sound between a sigh and a gasp, and
  handed over his glasses to Wallace.</p>

  <p>"There you are, old man," he said. "She's come."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, you are right," Wallace exclaimed as he gazed steadily through
  the binoculars. "The father and mother of all submarines. Lord, she must be
  nearly six hundred feet long! And, what a mark!"</p>

  <p>The glasses were passed from hand to hand until there was not a man on
  board who had not had a good view of the big German U-boat. She lay there, on
  the edge of the coral reef, broadside on to the <i>Sardonyx</i> that yawed
  and dipped in a perfect bath of steam as if her last moment had come. Behind
  this camouflage five-and-twenty pair of eyes were watching the drama that was
  taking place on the edge of the reef.</p>

  <p>"I think she's our bird now, old man," Endellion said cheerfully. "She's
  not a bit suspicious of us."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope not," Wallace said. "It looks like a case of rock me to
  sleep, mother, all right. But you never know with those devils. They might
  take it into their heads at any moment to hand us a dozen shells out of mere
  mischief. And if I don't get her first shot or two, we're done."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had thought of that," Endellion said. "When the band begins to
  play, we'll get the boats out, leaving just you and me and one or two more on
  board. They'll never see the boats in this sea, and, if the worst comes to
  the worst, we can pull round the point and land in the bay beyond."</p>

  <p>To all of which the crew demurred as one man. But Endellion was firm
  enough, and a few moments later the deck was deserted save for the Gentle
  Buccaneers and the little Welshman who owned the <i>Sardonyx</i>.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a score of men had landed from the submarine and were busy on
  the reef, evidently opening the petrol tank and connecting it with the
  U-boat. Gradually the <i>Sardonyx</i> yawed round, still oozing steam at
  every pore until the guns were trained on the long grey hull that rose out of
  the sea like some gigantic whale.</p>

  <p>"Let her have it," Shacklock yelled excitedly. "Plug her under the fifth
  rib, brigadier. Show us what Daddy did in the Great War."</p>

  <p>But Wallace did not appear to be heeding. He was too engrossed on his task
  to hear anything that was going on around him. Presently there was a puff of
  smoke and a dull roar, and a shell from one of the guns pitched neatly into
  the centre of the group hovering around the petrol tanks. Then there was a
  sort of dissolving view, visible enough through the binoculars, and the trim
  figure of the man Franks crumpled up and lay like a brown speck on the
  burning sands.</p>

  <p>"That was a good 'un," Graydon said. "But not quite good enough, old
  man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not bad for a sighting shot," Wallace said coolly. "Let's hand 'em
  another pasteboard."</p>

  <p>The second shot was effective enough, for it struck the submarine forward,
  tearing a huge hole in her bows, and, exploding, seemed to fill the air with
  fragments of steel and fractured machinery. But apparently no vital spot had
  been struck, for the crew gathered to the attack, and almost before Wallace
  could get in another shot the submarine had fired in her turn, and with a
  crash down came most of the top hamper of the <i>Sardonyx</i>. Another and
  another shot followed, the third one sheering away part of the bows of the
  <i>Sardonyx</i> without apparently disturbing Wallace, who worked his guns
  grimly. It was touch and go even now, and it might have gone hard indeed with
  those on board but for the fact that Wallace's fifth and sixth shots were
  absolutely pictures. The fifth pitched plumb on the deck of the submarine,
  blowing the crew thereon into fragments, and the sixth got into the very
  vitals of the U-boat, for the explosion that followed shook the crazy old
  <i>Sardonyx</i> from stem to stern. Then the bows of the submarine rose until
  she stood on end in the grotesque likeness of a church steeple. Just for a
  moment she hung quivering there, then gradually went down in a cloud of steam
  and smoke into 400 fathoms of water off the edge of the reef and was seen no
  more. All that remained of her consisted of Billy Hutton and two German
  sailors dancing frantically on the reef and shaking their fists in the
  direction of the <i>Sardonyx</i>, which was settling by the head.</p>

  <p>"So that's that," Wallace drawled.</p>

  <p>"Amen, not to say Prosit," Graydon cried. "But come on, lads, we haven't
  got a minute to spare."</p>

  <p>They swarmed down the side into the last boat and pulled away vigorously
  from the doomed <i>Sardonyx</i>. She went down presently like a stone, there
  was a ripple on the sea, and a dull explosion somewhere, and the old tram was
  finished.</p>

  <p>"Now what do you think of that for a day's work?" Endellion asked. "Well,
  we can't take any credit, boys. That will all go to Gunter. He'll have all
  the kudos, to say nothing of the Admiralty dollars. But I'm sorry about the
  old hooker."</p>

  <p>"Now, don't you go fretting your fat about that," Gunter grinned. "If you
  are satisfied and the Admiralty is satisfied, then there's no cause for me to
  grumble whatever. And if ever you want any really nice vegetables, you send
  to David Gunter and he will supply you with all you want."</p>
