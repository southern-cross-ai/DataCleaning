<h3><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</h3>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>THE laudable taste for Voyages and Travels, which prevails in
the present age, has been gratified with many excellent
productions, which render that species of literature highly
interesting to readers of almost every description. Modern
voyages of discovery have embraced so Many objects, that in them
the Navigator sees the progress of his important art, the
Geographer observes the improvement of his kindred science, the
Naturalist is gratified with curious and useful objects of
research, the Merchant discovers new scenes of commercial
enterprise, and the General Reader finds, a fund of rational
entertainment.</p>
<p>The Moral Philosopher, too; who loves to trace the advances of
his species through its various gradations from savage to
civilized life, draws from voyages and travels, the facts from
which he is to deduce his conclusions respecting the social,
intellectual, and moral progress of Man. He sees savage life
every where diversified with a variety, which, if he reason
fairly, must lead him to conclude, that what is called the state
of nature, is, in truth, the state of a rational being placed in
various physical circumstances, which have contracted or expanded
his faculties in various degrees; but that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"men always
appear<br>
"among animals a distinct and a superior race;<br>
"that neither the possession of similar organs,<br>
"nor the use of the hand, which nature has<br>
"given to some species of apes, nor the continued<br>
"intercourse with this sovereign artist, have<br>
"enabled any other species to blend their nature<br>
"with his; that in his rudest state he is found<br>
"to be above them, and in his greatest degeneracy<br>
"never descends to their level; that he is,<br>
"in short, <i>a man</i> in every condition; and that<br>
"we can learn nothing of his nature from the<br>
"analogy of other animals."*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every where adapting means to
ends, and variously altering and combining those means, according
to his views and wants, Man, even when pursuing the gratification
of animal instincts, too often miserably depraved, shows himself
to be possessed of nobler faculties, of liberty to chuse among
different objects and expedients, and of reason to direct him in
that choice. There is sufficient variety in human actions to show
that, though Man acts from motives, he acts not mechanically, but
freely; yet sufficient similarity of conduct, in similar
circumstances, to prove the unity of his nature. Hence there
appears no ground whatever for supposing, that any one tribe of
mankind is naturally of an order superior to the rest, or has any
shadow of right to infringe, far less to abrogate, the common
claims of humanity. Philosophers should not forget, and the most
respectable modern philosophers have not forgotten, that the
savage state of the most civilized nations now in Europe, is a
subject within the pale of authentic history, and that the
privation of iron alone, would soon reduce them nearly to the
barbarous state, from which, by a train of favourable events,
their forefathers emerged same centuries ago. If the limits of a
preface would allow us to pursue the reflections suggested by the
different views of savage life, presented by this and various
other scientific voyages, it would be easy to show, that the
boasted refinement of Europe entirely depends on a few happy
discoveries, which are become so familiar to us, that we are apt
to suppose the inhabitants of these parts of the world to have
been always possessed of them; discoveries so unaccountable, and
so remote from any experiments which uncivilized tribes can be
supposed to have made, that we cannot do better than acknowledge
them among the many precious gifts of an indulgent
Providence.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Ferguson on Civil Society.]</p>
<p>Having mentioned Providence, a word not very common in some of
our modern voyages, we are tempted to add a consideration which
has often occurred to our minds, in contemplating the probable
issue of that zeal for discovering and corresponding with distant
regions, which has long animated the maritime powers of Europe.
Without obtruding our own sentiments on the reader, we may be
permitted to ask, whether appearances do not justify a
conjecture, that the Great Arbiter of the destinies of nations
may render that zeal subservient to the moral and intellectual,
not to say the religious, improvement, and the consequent
happiness, of our whole species? or, Whether, as has hitherto
generally happened, the advantages of civilization may not, in
the progress of events, be transferred from the Europeans, who
have but too little prized them, to those remote countries which
they have been so diligently exploring? If so, the period may
arrive, when New Zealand may produce her Lockes, her Newtons, and
her Montesquieus; and and when great nations in the immense
region of New Holland, may send their navigators, philosophers,
and antiquaries, to contemplate the ruins of <i>ancient</i>
London and Paris, and to trace the languid remains of the arts
and sciences in this quarter of the globe. Who can tell, whether
the rudiments of some great suture empire may not already exist
at Botany Bay?</p>
<p>But, not to detain the reader with such general reflections,
which, however, open interesting views to contemplative minds, we
proceed to say a few words of the work now presented to the
Public. And here we need to do little more than refer to the
learned and ingenious Author's introduction to his own work. The
reader will immediately perceive that, if it has been tolerably
executed, it must form a valuable Supplement to the Voyage* of
the unfortunate La P&eacute;rouse so valuable indeed, that it may
fairly be questioned, whether that work can be considered as
perfect without it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Printed for Stockdale, London, in two large
vols. 8vo. with fifty-one fine Plates. It must be observed, that
this is the only edition to which are annexed the interesting
Travels of De Lesseps, over the Continent, from Kamtschatka, with
P&eacute;rouse's dispatches.]</p>
<p>Of the execution of the work, the reader must form his own
judgment. He will perhaps agree with us, that the Author writes
with the modesty and perspicuity which become a philosopher, who
all along recollects that he is composing a narrative, and not a
declamation. He has, in our opinion, with, great taste and
judgment, generally abstained from those rhetorical flourishes,
which give an air of bombast to too many of the works of his
countrymen, even when treating of subjects which demand accuracy
rather than ornament. Most of his reflections are pertinent and
just, and not so far pursued as to deprive the reader of an
opportunity of exercising his ingenuity by extending them
farther.</p>
<p>This chaste and unaffected manner of writing may be considered
as an internal mark of the fidelity of his narrative. He had no
weak or deformed parts to conceal with flowery verbiage, and
therefore he rejected its meretricious aid. As another, and a
fill stronger proof of our Author's fidelity, we may mention his
occasional censure of the conduct of Officers, not excepting the
Commander in Chief himself, when their conduct happened not to
appear quite deserving of that general approbation, which he
seems willing to bestow. A man must be very conscious of having
honestly executed his own mission, and of faithfully describing
the objects of it, when he scruple not to express publicly his
disapprobation of the conduct of Officers of talents and
distinction, engaged in the higher departments of the same great
undertaking.</p>
<p>In translating the work, the object aimed at was to render it
so literally as never to depart from the meaning of the Author;
yet so freely as not merely to clothe his French idiom with
English words. The translation of such a work should, in our
opinion, be free without licence, and literal without
servility.</p>
<p>Some readers would, no doubt, have willingly dispensed with a
great number of the nautical remarks, and with all the bearings
and distances; but those particulars were plainly so important to
navigators, that they could not, on any account, be omitted. Nor,
indeed, has a single sentence of the original, been retrenched in
the translation, except two passages, which would have been
justly considered as indelicate by most English readers; and, for
the same reason, the two engravings referred to in the
exceptionable passages, have been altered.</p>
<p>The whole of the plates are given in a style generally not
inferior to the original, which, with the French work in quarto,
are sold for six guineas, being thrice the price of the present
translation.</p>
<p><b>*<sub>*</sub>*</b> <small>In the original, the distances
are all expressed in the new French denominations of <i>metres,
decametres</i>, &amp;c. and the Author has given a table for
reducing them to toises. But, in the translation, the reader has
been spared that trouble, by every where inserting the equivalent
toises, French fathoms. A toise is equal to six French feet, or
nearly to six feet five inches, English measure; 2,853 toises
make a geographical or nautical league, twenty of which make a
degree of a great circle of the earth. Hence, to reduce toises to
nautical leagues, divide them by 2,853; the quotient will be the
leagues, and the remainder the odd toises.</small></p>

<h3><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<hr>
<p>NO intelligence had been received for three years respecting
the ships Boussole and Astrolabe, commanded by M. de la
P&eacute;rouse, when, early in the year 1791, the Parisian
Society of Natural History called the attention of the
Constituent Assembly to the fate of that navigator, and his
unfortunate companions.</p>
<p>The hope of recovering at least some wreck of an expedition
undertaken to promote the sciences, induced the Assembly to send
two other ships to fleet the same course which those navigators
must have pursued, after their departure from Botany Bay. Some of
them, it was thought, might have escaped from the wreck, and
might be confined in a desert island, or thrown upon same coast
inhabited by savages. Perhaps they might be dragging out life in
a distant clime, with their longing eyes continually fixed upon
the sea, anxiously looking for that relief which they had a right
to expect from their country.</p>
<p>On the 9th of February 1791, the following decree was passed
upon this subject:</p>
<p>"The National Assembly having heard the<br>
"report of its joint Committees of Agriculture,<br>
"Commerce, and the Marine, decrees,<br>
<br>
"That the King be petitioned to issue orders<br>
"to all the ambassadors, residents, consuls, and<br>
"agents of the nation, to apply, in the name of<br>
"humanity, and of the arts and sciences, to the<br>
"different Sovereigns at whose courts they<br>
"reside, requesting them to charge all their<br>
"navigators and agents whatsoever, and in what<br>
"places soever, but particularly in the most south<br>
"erly parts of the South Sea, to search diligently<br>
"for the two French frigates, the Boussole and<br>
"the Astrolabe, commanded by M. de la<br>
"P&eacute;rouse, as also for their ships' companies, and to<br>
"make every inquiry which has a tendency to<br>
"ascertain their existence or their shipwreck; in<br>
"order that, if M. de la P&eacute;rouse and his<br>
"companions should be found or met with, in any place<br>
"whatsoever, they may give them every assistance,<br>
"and procure them all the means necessary<br>
"for their return into their own country, and for<br>
"bringing with them all the property of which<br>
"they may be possessed; and the National<br>
"Assembly engages to indemnify, and even to<br>
"recompense, in proportion to the importance of<br>
"the service, any person or persons who shall<br>
"give assistance to those navigators, shall procure<br>
"intelligence concerning them, or shall be<br>
"instrumental in restoring to France any papers or<br>
"effects whatsoever, which may belong, or may<br>
"have belonged, to their expedition:<br>
<br>
"Decrees, farther, that the King be petitioned<br>
"to give orders for the sitting out of one or more<br>
"ships, having on board men of science,<br>
"naturalists, and draughtsmen, and to charge the<br>
"commanders of the expedition with the<br>
"two-fold mission of searching for M. de la P&eacute;rouse,<br>
"agreeable to the documents, instructions, and<br>
"orders which final be delivered to them, and of<br>
"making inquiries relative to the sciences and to<br>
"commerce, taking every measure to render this<br>
"expedition useful and advantageous to navigation,<br>
"geography, commerce, and the arts and<br>
"sciences, independently of their search for M.<br>
"de la P&eacute;rouse, and even after having found him,<br>
"or obtained intelligence concerning him."</p>

<p>From my earliest years, I had devoted myself to the science of
natural history; and, being persuaded, that it is in the great
book of Nature, that we ought to study her productions, and form
a just idea of her phenomena, when I had finished my medical
course, I took a journey into England, which was immediately
followed by another into the Alps, where the different
temperatures of a mountainous region present us with a prodigious
variety of objects.</p>
<p>I next visited a part of Asia Minor, where I resided two
years, in order that I might examine those plants, of which the
Greek and Arabian physicians have left us very imperfect
descriptions; and I had the satisfaction of bringing from that
country very important collections.</p>
<p>Soon after my return from this last tour, the National
Assembly decreed the equipment of two ships, in order to attempt
to recover at least a part of the wreck of the ships commanded by
La P&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p>It was an honourable distinction to be of the number of those,
whose duty it was to make every possible search, which could
contribute to restore to their country, men who had rendered her
such services.</p>
<p>That voyage was, in other respects, very tempting to a
naturalist. Countries newly discovered might be expected to
increase our knowledge with new productions, which might
contribute to the advancement of the arts and sciences.</p>
<p>My passion for voyages had hitherto increased, and three
months spent in navigating the Mediterranean, when I went to Asia
Minor, had given me some experience of a long voyage. Hence I
seized with avidity this opportunity of traversing the South
Seas.</p>
<p>If the gratification of this passion for study costs us
trouble, the varied products of a newly discovered region amply
compensate us for all the sufferings unavoidable in long
voyages.</p>
<p>I was appointed by the Government to make, in the capacity of
naturalist, the voyage of which I am about to give an
account.</p>
<p>My Journal, which was kept with care during the whole course
of the voyage, contained many nautical observations; but I ought
to observe, that that part of my work would have been very
incomplete, without the auxiliary labour bestowed upon it by
Citizen Legrand, one of the best officers of our expedition.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity of testifying my grateful remembrance
of that skilful mariner, whose loss in the present war is a
subject of regret.</p>
<p>When I was leaving Batavia, in order to proceed to the Isle of
France, Citizen Piron, draughtsman to the expedition, begged my
acceptance of duplicates of his drawings of the dresses of the
natives, which he had made in the course of the Voyage. I do not
hesitate to assure my readers, that those works of his pencil are
striking likenesses.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to report, in the most exact manner, the
facts which I witnessed during this painful voyage, across seas
abounding with rocks, and among savages, against whom it was
necessary to exert continual vigilance.</p>
<p>General Dentrecasteaux received the command of the expedition.
That officer requested from the Government two ships of about
five hundred tons burden, Their bottoms were sheathed with wood,
and then filled with scupper nails. It was not apprehended that
this mode would diminish their velocity, and it was thought that
it would add to the solidity of their construction. It is,
however, acknowledged that ships sheathed and bottomed with
copper may be constructed with equal solidity, and that they have
greatly the advantage in point of sailing. Those ships received
names analogous to the object of the enterprize. That in which
General Dentrecasteaux embarked, was called the Recherche
(Research), and the other, commanded by Captain Huon Kermadec,
received the name of the Esperance (the Hope).</p>
<p>The Recherche had on board one hundred and thirteen men at the
time of her departure: the Esperance only one hundred and
six.</p>

<br>
<small>AUGUST, 1791.</small></p>
<p>THE equipment of the two vessels appointed for the voyage
which we were about to undertake being already in a state of
great forwardness, towards the close of the month of August, we
received orders from General Dentrecasteaux to repair to Brest. I
had the pleasure of travelling thither in the company of three
persons engaged in the same expedition, namely, the Citizens
Riche, Beaupr&eacute;, and Pierson.</p>
<p>We arrived at Brest on the 10th of September. Some of the
finest ships in the French navy, such as the Majestueux, the
Etats de Bourgogne, the America, &amp;c. were then in the
harbour.</p>
<p>While our astronomers were engaged in making the observations
necessary for determining the movements of our time-keepers,
those who designed to make Natural History the principal object
of their attention were employed in furnishing themselves with
all the requisites for preparing the collections, which they
purposed to make in the unknown countries we were about to
visit.</p>
<p>As it was my intention to devote myself chiefly to the
observation of the vegetable kingdom, I stood in need of a great
quantity of paper, and wished to provide myself with some of a
very large size. It was, however, not without great difficulty
that I was able to procure twenty-two reams; almost all that
remained in the warehouses having been lately appropriated to the
service of the artillery.</p>
<p>I employed a part of the time that I had at my own disposal in
examining the botanical garden, which is kept in very good order.
There is also, in this place, a small cabinet of natural history,
which contains several anatomical preparations presented to it by
Citizen Joannet, surgeon of the Esperance.</p>
<p>The muster of our crews took place in the harbour on the 21st
of September.</p>
<p>The vessels went into the road-stead on the 25th. There were
then no foreign ships there, and very few French.</p>
<p>We were very heavily laden, so that when we let sail our
draught was thirteen feet nine inches at the stern, and twelve
feet ten inches at the head.</p>
<p>There were on board the Recherche; 6 eight pounders; 2
carronades of thirty-six; 6 pedereroes of half a pound; 12
pedereroes of six ounces; 45 muskets; 35 pistols; 50 sabres; 30
battle-axes, and 10 espingoles.</p>
<p>The Esperance was provided with nearly the same means of
defence, which were sufficient to secure us against any violence
that might be attempted by savages.</p>
<p>Both vessels were furnished with a great bore of commodities
intended to be distributed amongst the natives of the South-seas.
Iron tools, and stuffs of different colours, especially red,
formed the basis of our bartering stock.</p>
<p>Each of the vessels was bored with provisions sufficient for
the consumption of eighteen months. We now only waited for a
favourable wind to set sail. A pretty fresh breeze springing up
from the east, enabled us to get under way about one o'clock in
the afternoon of the 28th of September. Soon after we had left
the roads, we discovered two sailors and a cabin-boy, who being
very desirous of going on this expedition, and having been
disappointed in their with to be included in our crew, had
concealed themselves in the ship. As we had scarcely room
sufficient for the men already on board, our Commander gave
orders to tack about and make for the roads of Bertheaume, where
our three unbidden guests were set on shore.</p>
<p>The Esperance, having met with no such interruption, had got
considerably a-head of us, but we came up with her before night,
as our vessel was a much better sailer.</p>
<p>At taking our departure at six in the evening, we found our
place to be 48&deg; 13' N. lat. 7&deg; 15' E. long.</p>
<p>We set the ouessant at N. 2&deg; W. of the compass.</p>
<p>The bec de la chevre at S.E. 4&deg; E.</p>
<p>The bec du raz at S. 2&deg; E.</p>
<p>Point Mathieu was then at the distance of 2,565 toises.</p>
<p>We now steered our course E.N.E. till towards midnight, when
we directed it right east.</p>
<p>On the 29th, our Commander Dentrecasteaux was informed, by
dispatches which he had orders not to open before we were in the
main sea, that Major Huon Kermadec, Commander of the Esperance,
was advanced to the rank of post-captain (<i>capitaine de
vaisseau</i>), and himself to that of rear-admiral
(<i>contre-amiral</i>). This intelligence was immediately
conveyed by the speaking-trumpet to the Esperance, and our flags
were hoisted with the distinctive ensigns of the rank conferred
upon the Commander.</p>
<p>We again discovered two marines, and a cabin-boy, who were not
inrolled among our crew, and had kept themselves till now
concealed in the ship. As we were already too far from the land
to set them on shore, the Commander permitted them to accompany
us on our expedition.</p>
<p>Having made several sea-voyages before the present, I had
flattered myself that I was too seasoned a sailor to be any more
incommoded by the motion of the vessel; but I found that I had
already entirely lost this qualification, for I was sea-sick
during the first three days after our sailing from Brest. I have
had frequent opportunities in the course of this voyage of
remarking, that a very short stay upon shore is sufficient to
render me anew susceptible of sickness from the motion of the
vessel; for whenever we have put out to sea, after having lain a
short time at anchor, I have always been disordered for two or
three days as much as I was after our departure from Brest. The
sailors advise one, in these cases, to endeavour to eat,
notwithstanding the loathing of food that always accompanies this
disorder. But this piece of advice it is very difficult to follow
for besides the pain produced by the action of swallowing, the
presence of food in the stomach increases the nausea, and the
vomiting that supervenes is still more distressing.</p>
<p>Diluting liquors, taken in small quantities at a time, so as
not to burden the stomach, have always afforded me the most
relief. Lukewarm water, slightly sweetened with sugar, is the
drink which I have generally used, as it is the easiest to be
procured at sea.</p>
<p>We had, however, several persons on board, who, though they
had never been at sea before, experienced not the smallest
inconvenience from the toiling of the ship. Such a constitution
is very desirable for those who undertake long voyages; for it is
impossible to describe the disagreeable sensations that attend
this spasmodic affection, which, as it operates upon every part
of the frame, produces such a general depression of its powers,
that life would be insupportable, were it not for the hope of a
speedy termination of the disorder.</p>
<p>From the day of our setting sail, to the 5th of October, we
had slight breezes, that varied between the north and east points
of the compass. From that time to our arrival at Teneriffe, they
blew pretty fresh, varying between the north and north-east. This
alteration in the state of the wind gave us no small uneasiness,
as in our situation it might become productive of the most fatal
consequences. Lumbered as we were in every part of the vessel,
and drawing considerably above the load-water line, we ran the
risk of being overset by a sudden squall; besides, the stowage
had been very negligently performed. In this disorderly state we
had sailed from France, although the expedition had been decreed
by the National Assembly almost eight months before it took
place.</p>
<p>On the 11th of October, about fifty-five minutes after ten
o'clock, we observed an eclipse of the moon. The observations
that can be taken at lea, lead to no very accurate results.
Citizen Willaumez, however, concluded, from one which he took,
that we were now in the longitude of 18&deg; 19' 45" W. On the
12th, about eight in the morning, the Esperance intimated to us
by a signal, that land was espied.</p>
<p>Towards noon we reckoned ourselves to be at the distance of
about 71,800 toises from the peak of Teneriffe, which bore S.E.S.
raising its head majestically above the clouds.</p>
<p>At the close of the evening we were not more than about 10,260
toises distant from the northeast point of the island. We shifted
with the fore and main top-sails every three hours, whilst we
expected the dawn. As soon as it appeared, we made towards the
island, coasting along at the distance of 500 toises.</p>
<p>About half an hour after nine in the morning, we cast anchor
in the road of St. Croix, in a muddy bottom of black sand, about
fifteen toises in depth.</p>
<p>The French Consul, Citizen Fontpertuis, waited immediately
upon our Commander, with art offer of his services in furnishing
us with whatever we might want for the prosecution of our
expedition.</p>
<p>I went on shore in the afternoon, to take a view of the
environs of the town. Although the season was considerably
advanced, the reflection of the rays of the sun from the volcanic
stones, produced a degree of heat that was the more oppressive as
the air was perfectly calm.</p>
<p>I observed among the plants that grow in the neighbourhood of
St. Croix, a woody species of balm, known by botanists under the
name of <i>melissa fruticosa</i>, also the <i>saccharum
teneriff&aelig;</i>, the <i>cacalia kleinia</i>, the <i>datura
metel</i>, the <i>chrysanthemum frutescens</i>, &amp;c. Some of
the gardens were ornamented with the beautiful tree termed
<i>poinciana pulcherrima</i>.</p>
<p>In the evening, Citizen Ely, being struck with the grotesque
appearance of some of the women in the town, who, even during the
greatest heat of the season, wear long cloaks of very coarse
woollen stuffs, was employed in drawing a sketch of one of them,
when he was suddenly interrupted by a sentinel, who imagined him
to be taking a plan of the harbour. It was in vain that he
attempted to explain to him what his draught was intended to
represent; the soldier would not suffer him to finish it.</p>
<p>As we had anchored too close to another small vessel, we cast
an anchor in the afternoon nearer to the shore, by which we kept
ourselves at a convenient distance.</p>
<p>The bearings we took at this place gave us the following
results;</p>
<p>The redoubt on the north side of the town, N.N.E. 4&deg;
E.</p>
<p>The great tower situated about the middle of the town,
E.S.E.</p>
<p>At sun-rise each of the forts returned our salute of nine guns
with an equal number. On the noon of the preceding day, we had
saluted the town with fifteen, as it returned us gun for gun.</p>
<p>A packet-boat from Spain cast anchor to-day in the
road-stead.</p>
<p>We had agreed to take a journey to the peak on the morrow, and
subsequently to visit the other high mountains of the island in
succession. The French Consul very obligingly did all that was in
his power, to facilitate the execution of our design, and gave us
letters of recommendation to M. de Cologant, a very respectable
merchant, resident at Orotava.</p>
<p>About four o'clock the next morning, our party assembled upon
the Mole to the number of eight; namely, Develle, one of the
officers of our ship, Piron, Deschamps, Lahaye, and myself, with
three servants, one of whom understood the Spanish language, and
served as our interpreter. We found the mules that were to carry
us at the sea-side; but it was more than an hour before we could
set out upon our journey, it being no easy matter to assemble our
guides, some of whom, knowing that we could not set off without
them, made no scruple of letting us wait till they chose to make
their appearance. When they had arrived we thought we should be
able immediately to proceed, but we were obliged to expostulate
with them a long time, before they could be induced to carry the
small stock of necessaries that we took with us upon our
expedition.</p>
<p>The reader will recollect that our ships were so plentifully
stored with provisions, that one might have thought we were going
to sail to some desert country. Rossel, who had the charge of the
officers' table, had given orders to the cook to send us an
excellent salmon-pie for our journey should not have mentioned in
trivial a circumstance, had it not been for the sake of the
contrast which it affords with the worm-eaten biscuits and
cheese, that were our usual regale whilst we remained on shore,
in the subsequent part of our expedition.</p>
<p>Mons. de Cologant having been informed by the French Consul of
our intended journey, invited us to come to his house at the
harbour of Orotava. This port, which is not more than about
15,390 toises distant from St. Croix, is a very convenient
baiting-place for those who visit the peak; it being situated at
the foot of the nearest mountains of the chain to which it
belongs.</p>
<p>We were three hour before we arrived at Laguna. This town is
only 5,130 toises distant from St. Croix; but the road thither is
very fatiguing, as it ascends for the greater part of the way.
The place is meanly built, and very thinly inhabited. We were
informed that at least one half of its inhabitants consists of
monks.</p>
<p>On our way to Laguna we passed over some barren mountains,
which were covered with a variety of plants of a luxurious
growth. Amongst others we noticed the <i>euphorbia
canariensis</i>, the <i>euphorbia dendroides</i>, the <i>cacalia
kleinia</i>, the <i>cachis opuntia</i>, &amp;c. These plants, as
they derive their nourishment almost entirely from the
atmosphere, thrive very well in spite of the sterility of the
abrupt precipices on which they grow. When we descended into the
small plain on which the town stands, we remarked that the mould
produced from the corruption of the vegetables, and washed down
from the surrounding mountains by the rain, answers a very useful
purpose in fertilizing this little spot of ground, so that it
yields abundance of corn, Indian wheat, millet, and other
esculent plants.</p>
<p>I here observed a species of the <i>periploca</i>, which I had
formerly discovered during my travels in the Levant. I have given
an account of it in the second decade of my description of the
plants of Syria, under the appellation of <i>periploca
angustfolia</i>. Citizen Desfontaines has likewise collected some
of the same species upon the coasts of Barbary.</p>
<p>All the stones that we had hitherto seen these regions
appeared to have undergone the action of fire. As the mountains
of this chain that are of the mean elevation consist of large
masses, that after being fused must have retained a great degree
of heat for a considerable length of time; expected to find the
lavas very compact in their texture. My conjecture was confirmed.
Their grain is very fine, and their colour for the most part a
deep brown.</p>
<p>Surrounded with these volcanic remains, we found the heat very
oppressive, which appeared to incommode our guides much more than
ourselves; so that they exerted all their powers of persuasion in
order to prevail upon us to make halt during the day, and only
travel in the night-time. They probably imagined that our sole
aim was to see the summit of the peak, and several of our company
would have had no very great objections against our journey being
conducted upon that plan. But it is easy to suppose that such a
nocturnal ramble could not promise much advantage to those whose
object of pursuit was the study of natural history.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the island are beset with religious
prejudices from their earliest infancy. The children came running
out of their habitations to enquire if we were of their religion;
and we contented ourselves with commiserating the unfortunate
beings upon whom monkish bigotry and intolerance exert with
unbounded rigour their pernicious sway.</p>
<p>Most of the garden-walls in the country beyond Laguna, are
ornamented with the beautiful plant called <i>trichomanes
canariense</i>.</p>
<p>As we approached Orotava, our road led us down a very gentle
declivity. We saw no more such barren mountains as in the
vicinity of St. Croix, where the luxuriance of the vegetable
kingdom is only an indication of the sterility of the soil; but
verdant banks covered with vineyards, the produce of which
constitutes the chief wealth of the island. The shrub termed
<i>bosea yervamora</i> grows here in low situations.</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the evening we arrived at Orotava, where we
were received by M. de Cologant, in the most hospitable
manner.</p>
<p>Two vessels, an English and a Dutch, were then at anchor in
the road-stead, in order to take in a cargo of wine. The
landing-place here is much more difficult of access than that at
St. Croix, on which account this harbour is less frequented.</p>
<p>M. de Cologant's wine-vaults were an object well worthy of our
attention; as the wines of the island are the principal commodity
in which this opulent merchant trades.</p>
<p>Amongst the different kinds of wine which they contain, there
are two sorts that have qualities very distinct from each other;
namely, the sack, or dry wine, and that which is commonly known
by the name of malmsey. In the preparation of the latter, care is
taken to concentrate its saccharine principle as much as
possible.</p>
<p>The price of the best wine was then 120 piastres per pipe, and
that of the inferior sort 60 piastres. It is necessary however to
remark, that I here speak only of the price at which it is sold
to strangers; for the same wine which they buy at 60 piastres the
pipe, is sold to the inhabitants of the island for six and
thirty.</p>
<p>When the fermentation of these wines has proceeded to a
certain length, it is the custom to mix with them a considerable
quantity of brandy, which renders them so heady, that many
persons are unable to drink them, even in very moderate quantity,
without feeling disagreeable effects upon the nervous system from
this admixture.</p>
<p>We were assured that the island generally yields thirty
thousand pipes of wine in a year. As it does not produce a
sufficient quantity of corn for the consumption of the
inhabitants, a part of the produce of the wines, which are sold
to strangers as Madeira wine (and indeed they differ very little
from it in quality), is expended in the purchase of this
indispensably necessary article of sustenance.</p>
<p>Although the olive thrives very well in this island, it is
very little cultivated. The different species of the palm-tree
that are to be met. with in some of the gardens, are cultivated
only for curiosity.</p>
<p>We had been assured, before our departure from St. Croix, that
we should find the summit of the peak already covered with snow.
I had not thought it necessary to take a barometer with me at
setting out; but I sound at Orotava that I had been led into a
mistake; and there I was unable to procure this instrument of
observation.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* We read, in the account of the Voyage of La
P&eacute;rouse, that when the ship lay at anchor in the road of
St. Croix, the mercury, in the barometer that Lamanon had taken
with him, fell at the peak of Teneriffe to 18 inches 4 lines,
whilst the thermometer indicated 9.7&deg; above 0, though, at the
same moment of time, the barometer stood, at St. Croix, at 28
inches 3 lines, and the thermometer at 24&frac12;&deg;.]</p>
<p>We purposed to proceed very early the next morning on our
journey. But that happened to a festival day, and our guides
could not be persuaded to set out before they had heard mass;
some of them had even heard three already: as for us, we waited
for them with the most impatient solicitude, when our uneasiness
was redoubled by being informed that we ought to consider it as a
very great indulgence if they would agree to travel at all on so
high a festival. They were, however, at length ready to accompany
us, about nine o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
<p>Having left the town, we pursued a track that often led us up
very steep ascents, from whence we observed enormous masses of
mountains piled one upon the other, and forming a sort of
amphitheatre round the base of the peak. On their brows we
frequently met with level spots that served us for
resting-places, where, after having fatigued ourselves with
climbing up the rugged paths, we stopped for a short time to take
breath, and acquire fresh courage for ascending the higher
mountains.</p>
<p>Our guides were astonished to observe that some of us chose to
go on foot, contrary to the custom of the greater part of those
who make the tour of the peak; and incessantly admonished us to
ride upon the mules which they led along with them.</p>
<p>After having passed through some fine plantations of vines, we
found ourselves surrounded with chestnut-trees, which cover the
most elevated regions of these mountains.</p>
<p>In the clefts between the mountains, I observed the
<i>polipodium virginicum</i>, and several species of the laurel
that were new to me, amongst the rest the <i>laura indica</i> of
Linn&aelig;us.</p>
<p>Although we purposed to perform our journey within a space of
not many days, we ought to have provided ourselves with a larger
stock of shoes; for even the strongest soles were soon ground to
pieces by the lava on which we walked.</p>
<p>It was near noon when we arrived at the height of the clouds,
which spread a thick dew over the brush-wood through which our
road led us.</p>
<p>One should think that the abundance of rain which falls upon
these heights, in consequence of the natural propensity of the
atmosphere,* must give rise to a great number of springs. They
arc, nevertheless, very rare; as the earth is not sufficiently
attenuated to retain the water, which filtrating through the
volcanic soil, discharges itself, for the greater part, into the
ocean, without collecting into regular streams.</p>
<p class="foot">[* We may here remark, that when high mountains
become much heated by the rays of the sun, they act as a kind of
stove, by which the superincumbent atmosphere is elevated in
consequence of the dilatation which it undergoes. Hence arises
the moisture of the more distant part of the atmosphere, which,
rushing in to supply the place of that which has been sent into
higher regions by the action of the heat, carries with it the
clouds suspended in it; as I have had frequent opportunities of
observing at Mount Libanon, where this ph&oelig;nomenon never
fails to take place about five o'clock in the afternoon during
the heats of the month of September, unless some violent current
of the atmosphere should happen to counteract its natural
disposition. Perhaps this may be the sole reason of the
attraction that appears to exist between mountains and
clouds.]</p>
<p>As soon as we had surmounted these thick clouds, we enjoyed a
spectacle beautiful beyond conception. The clouds heaped up below
us appeared blended with the distant ocean, and concealed the
island from our light. The sky above us formed a vault of the
most transparent azure, whilst the peak appeared like an
insulated mountain placed in the midst of a vast expanse of
waters.</p>
<p>Soon after we had left the clouds beneath us, I observed a
ph&oelig;nomenon, which I had formerly had occasion to remark,
during my stay amongst the high mountains of Kesroan in Natolia.
It was with new surprise that I saw the outlines of my figure,
delineated in all the beautiful tints of the rainbow, upon the
clouds below me, situated opposite to the sun.</p>
<p>The decomposition of the rays of the sun, by contact with the
surfaces of bodies, affords a very satisfactory explanation of
this splendid ph&oelig;nomenon. It exemplifies, upon a large
scale, a fact well known to natural philosophers; namely, that
when the rays of the sun are made to pals through a small hole in
the window-shutter of a darkened chamber, so as to fall upon any
object within it, they represent the outlines of the object in
all the various colours of the rainbow, by being collected with a
prism and thrown upon white sheet of paper.</p>
<p>We now had to cross a prodigious heap of pumice-stones,
amongst which we observed very few vegetables, and those in a
very languishing condition. The <i>spartium</i> was the only
shrub that could support itself in these elevated regions. It was
very troublesome walking upon this volcanic soil, as we sunk into
it up to the middle of the leg. We found some blocks of pozzolana
sparingly scattered among the pumice-earth.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the evening we took up our abode for the
night in the midst of the lava. Some large fragments that we
found, were our only shelter against the east wind, which blew
with considerable violence. The cold was very intense at this
height, where nature has not consulted the convenience of
travellers, as very little wood is found here; so that the scanty
fuel that we were able to collect, was not sufficient to prevent
us from passing a very unpleasant night.</p>
<p>The day at length began to dawn. We left some of our guides
with their mules at the place where we had spent the night, and
proceeded on our journey to the peak, which we were now in haste
to accomplish.</p>
<p>We continued, for the space of an hour, to travel over large
heaps of fragments of a greyish coloured lava, amongst which some
blocks of pozzolana were scattered, as also, huge masses of a
very compact blackish glass, which bore a great resemblance to
the coarse glass of bottles. This glass though formed in the vast
crucibles of the mountains at the time of their combustion, might
become very useful in the arts; for being already completely
manufactured by the hand of nature, it would only require to be
exposed to the action of the fire in order to fuse it anew, and
render it susceptible of being moulded into all the forms that
the hand of man is able to give to it.</p>
<p>We arrived at the mouth of a cavern called <i>la queve del
ana</i>, the orifice of which is full four feet and a half in
diameter. As its cavity runs for a length of more than six feet
in an almost horizontal direction, we were not able to reach the
bottom otherwise than by descending into it with the help of a
rope. We found that it contained water, the surface of which, as
was to have been expected at this height, was covered with ice
about an inch and a half thick. We immediately made a hole in the
ice, and regaled ourselves with some excellent water. I did not
feel any of those disagreeable sensations in the throat, which I
have often experienced on the French Alps, from drinking the
water which issues from the foot of the Glaciers; although the
cold of the water in this cavern was one degree lower than that
generally indicated by the water of the Glaciers, for upon
plunging a thermometer into it, it fell to the freezing point. It
seems that the disagreeable pricking sensation occasioned by the
water of the Glaciers in the internal fauces, arises from its
being deprived of its atmospherical air.</p>
<p>The roof of the cavern was covered with crystals of
saltpetre.</p>
<p>Piron, who had been indisposed for several days, found himself
so overcome with fatigue as to be unable to proceed any further.
Deschamps also chose to remain with him at the cavern; as for the
rest of us, we set forward on our ascent to the summit of the
peak.</p>
<p>Having reached its base, we saw it elevate itself before us in
the shape of a cone, to a prodigious height, forming the crown of
the highest of there mountains. From this spot our view extended
over all the rest of the mountains, which seemed to form so many
gradations, that must first be surmounted before we can arrive at
this commanding eminence.</p>
<p>At the place called <i>La Ramblette</i>, situated the
north-east side of the peak, our curiosity was excited by some
clefts made in the rock, a few of which were three inches wide;
the rest were merely cracks, from which issued an aqueous vapour
that had no smell, although the sides of the chinks were covered
with crystals of sulphur, shooting out from a very white earth,
which appeared to be of an argillaceous nature.</p>
<p>A mercurial thermometer being introduced into one of the
clefts, the quicksilver rose, in the space of a minute, to
43&deg; above 0 of Reaumur's scale. In several of the others it
did not rise higher than 30&deg;.</p>
<p>We were now engaged in the most toilsome part of our journey,
the acclivity of the peak being exceedingly steep. When we had
surmounted about a third part of the ascent, I made a hole about
three inches deep into the earth, from whence an aqueous
inodorous vapour issued, and though the heat of the surface of
the earth was not greater than it usually is at an equal
elevation, upon plunging a thermometer into it the mercury rose
to 51&deg; above 0.</p>
<p>The <i>spartium supra nubium</i> was the last shrub that I
noticed before we arrived at the foot of the cone; but there is
an herbaceous plant which, notwithstanding its apparent delicacy,
vegetates even in still higher situations. I mean a species of
violet with leaves somewhat elongated, and slightly indented at
the edges; its flowering time was already past. We observed it to
grow quite near to the summit of the peak.</p>
<p>The vapours of the atmosphere not being able to rise so this
height, the sky presents itself in the purest azure, which is
more bright and dazzling than what we can see in the clearest
weather of our climates. Though some scattered clouds hung in the
atmosphere far below our feet, we had still a very perfect view
of the neighbouring islands.</p>
<p>The cone is terminated by a crater, the greatest elevation of
which is on the north-east side. Its south-west side has a deep
depression, which seems to have been produced by the linking of
the ground.</p>
<p>Near to the top are several orifices about three inches in
diameter, from which a very hot vapour issues, that made
Reaumur's thermometer rise to 67&deg; above 0, emitting a sound
very like that of the humming of bees. When the snow begins to
fall on the summit of the peak in the latter part of the year,
that which falls upon these orifices is soon melted by the heat.
The sides of these holes are adorned with beautiful crystals of
sulphur, mostly of the form of needles, and same of them arranged
into very regular figures. The action of the sulphuric acid
combined with the water, effects such a change upon the volcanic
products of this place, that at first sight one might mistake
them for very white argillaceous earth, that has acquired a high
degree of ductility from the moisture constantly issuing from the
above-mentioned apertures. It is in this kind of earth that the
sulphuric crystals which I have spoken of are found.</p>
<p>The decomposition of the sulphur, and the volcanic products,
form an aluminous salt that covers the ground in needles, which
have very little cohesion with each other.</p>
<p>The thermometer, when placed in the shade at the height of
about three feet from the surface of the ground at the summit of
the peak, rose in a quarter of an hour to 15&deg; above 0. No
sensible variation was observed upon changing its distance from
the earth, even by six or eight feet, which gives us reason to
believe, that the internal heat of the ground in this place,
though so very great, has little influence upon the temperature
of the atmosphere. Besides, the air of the atmosphere might
easily be heated at this height by the rays of the sun to
15&deg;, as a higher temperature is often experienced at the foot
of the Glaciers. I have often known the thermometer to stand at
20 above o upon Mount Libanon, though placed quite close to the
snow.</p>
<p>The declivity of the mountain facilitated our return, and we
descended much quicker than we had ascended. It was already
evening before we reached the place where we had passed the
preceding night. The almost total want of sleep, which we had
experienced in consequence of the intense cold, gave us little
courage to spend another night at the same place. We therefore
shed to proceed immediately farther, in order to seek a better
flicker upon some of the neighbouring mountains; but as our
guides would not move a step before the moon rose, we were
compelled to remain there till near midnight, waiting for its
appearance. With the assistance of its feeble light, we descended
over the pumice-stones, following pretty closely the track which
we had made for ourselves in our ascent.</p>
<p>After a march of four hours, the brush-wood, which grew very
thick, obstructed our way so much, that we were obliged to halt
till day-break. We had here abundance of fuel, and made ourselves
amends for the cold of the preceding night, by immediately
kindling a very large fire. Most of our company were so very much
fatigued with their toilsome journey, that they had no other with
left than to make the belt of their way back to St. Croix;
although we had agreed at letting out from Orotava, that we would
return by the opposite side of the mountains. But as we were no
longer all of the same mind, it was settled that those who had
already satisfied their curiosity, should return to the ships;
whilst the gardener and myself alone resolved to complete our
first design. All our guides wished to accompany those who were
returning to the ships, so that it was with great difficulty that
I could persuade one of them to attend us.</p>
<p>I was gratified with finding among the plants that grew on the
sides of the rocks, the <i>campanula aurea</i>, the
<i>prenanthespinnala</i>, the <i>adiantum reniforme</i>, and a
species of the <i>ceterac</i>, remarkable on account of its
leaves, which are much larger than those of the European
species.</p>
<p>As these mountains afford very little water, we directed our
course towards a small habitation, where we presumed we should
find ourselves near to some stream of water. We were not
disappointed, for we came to a very fine spring of delicious
limpid water, which lost itself again under the ground, after
having but kin appeared above its surface.</p>
<p>Apple-trees loaded with fruit adorned the garden of these
peaceable cottagers. This fruit tasted so delicious to the
servant who accompanied us, that he took it into his head, whilst
we were employed in viewing the premises, to make an exchange
that gave us a very poor idea of his foresight. He had given away
our whole store of flesh-meat for some of these apples, without
taking a moment's consideration whether or not they would be an
equally good provision for us in travelling the mountains. We
swore to ourselves that we would never on a future expedition
leave our stores in the charge of such an &oelig;conomist. In
general it may be remarked, that the servants employed at sea are
almost wholly unfit for service on shore.</p>
<p>At the close of the evening we were far from any habitation of
men. About nine o'clock we reached a village, the inhabitants of
which can certainly not be accused of carrying the virtue of
hospitality to a blameable excess. It was not without the
greatest difficulty that we were able to procure shelter among
them. As we did not understand the Spanish language, we were
obliged to make use of signs to express our meaning, a language
that, in the night time at least, is a very impeded means of
communication; but our guide, who was no less desirous of going
to bed than we were, went knocking in vain at one door after the
other, till having gone round almost the whole village, we at
length found two charitable souls who agreed to harbour us.</p>
<p>We were immediately served with a frugal repast, during which
the house was lighted in the manner that is practised by some of
the inhabitants of the Alps. They set fire to small splinters of
very resinous wood, stuck into the wall, which afford plenty of
light, but throw out a great deal of smoke. One of our hosts took
the charge upon himself of lighting new splinters of wood as fast
as the former were confirmed.</p>
<p>We stood much more in need of sleep than of meat, and hastened
to enjoy a repose, which proved the more delectable, as we were
here no more incommoded with the cold we had experienced on the
high mountains.</p>
<p>On the following day, the loth, I went on board with my
collection of volcanic products and some very fine specimens of
plants, such as the <i>tenerium betonicum</i>, the <i>eschium
frutescens</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The birds known by the name of Canary-birds are cry common in
the lower regions of these mountains; their colour is a brown
mixed with various other hues, and their plumage is not so
beautiful in their wild state, as it becomes when they are
domesticated. Some travellers have asserted, that an indigenous
species of the parrot is found in there islands; but I have never
seen any in my excursions, and several credible persons among the
inhabitants have assured me that this assertion is destitute of
foundation.</p>
<p>A very stiff gale, which sprung up to-day, caused the sea to
swell to such a height, as to drive on shore the pinnace of the
Esperance, after having overset it upon one of the sailors, who
could not be extricated in less than a space of several minutes.
He was already suffocated to a great degree; but the means
usually employed in these cases proved successful in restoring
him to animation.</p>
<p>Whilst I here express my gratitude to the garrison of St.
Croix, for the alacrity with which they hastened to the relief of
this unfortunate sailor. I cannot pass over in silence a piece of
knavery committed upon this occasion by some of the natives.</p>
<p>Whilst we were administering our assistance this man, we had
hung up his clothes to dry, little suspecting what should happen.
Some of the inhabitants of the town, perhaps conceiving him
already dead, thought sit to appropriate his clothes to the use
of the living; they were accordingly carried off, and all pursuit
after the robbers was in vain.</p>
<p>Citizens Riche and Blavier, engaged in the study of natural
history, had undertaken a journey to the peak the day after we
had let out upon ours; but they did not succeed in reaching the
summit; for whilst they were still at a considerable distance
from it, their lungs being unable to accommodate themselves to
the rarefied atmosphere, they were seized with a spitting of
blood, which obliged them to relinquish their enterprize.</p>
<p>The following days were employed by us in visiting the
environs of St. Croix, where the country is in general very
barren.</p>
<p>The town is very thinly peopled, even in proportion to the
smallness of its extent; though the harbour here is more
frequented than any other in the island. The Spaniards have
introduced here their own manner of building. The distribution of
the internal part of the houses is, the same with that which they
practise in Europe, without any of those modifications which the
difference of the climate requires.</p>
<p>The Governor-general of the Canary-islands usually resides at
St. Croix. There are several convents of monks and nuns in this
place. One of the parochial churches here is equally remarkable
for the tasteless profusion with which the gilding is lavished
upon it, and the bad choice of its paintings.</p>
<p>In the market-place there is a fine fountain, the water of
which is conveyed from a great distance by wooden pipes through
the mountains. The streets are ill-paved; most of the windows are
without glass-panes, lattices being used instead of them, which
the women very frequently open, when curiosity, or any other
motive, prompts them to let themselves be seen.</p>
<p>Women of condition dress after the French fashion; those of
the lower ranks cover their shoulders with a piece of coarse
woollen stuff, which forms a sort of cloak very incommodious in
this hot climate; broad-brimmed hats of felt shelter their faces
from the rays of the sun; intermarriages with the natives render
their complexions darker than those of their countrywomen; and
their features are upon the whole rather disagreeable.</p>
<p>The multiplicity of religious observances practised by the
inhabitants were not sufficient to prevent the women from going,
with their chaplets in their hands, to meet our tailors, whenever
they came on shore, some of whom, have had to repent for a long
time their having been seduced by such a superabundance of
attractions.</p>
<p>The wine of Teneriffe, which, as I have already observed, is
very heady, was likely to have been the cause of very fatal
consequences to one of our sailors, who, in a fit of
intoxication, committed a very heinous offence upon a sentinel.
The French Consul, however, made use of his interest with the
officer who had the command during the absence of the
Governor-general, so as to prevent any cognizance being taken of
the matter. The discipline observed on board the English ships
effectually secures them from any of these disagreeable
occurrences.</p>
<p>The Scorpion sloop of war, of sixteen guns and one hundred
men, commanded by captain Benjamin Hallowell, had cast anchor in
the roads on the 18th, consorted by a small cutter, They had
sailed from Madeira five days before, where they had left a
vessel of fifty guns, which was expected soon to arrive at
Teneriffe. Commodore Englefield who commanded it, had also the
general command of this small armament which was defined for the
coast of Africa. These officers, aware of the danger to which
sailors are exposed whilst they remain on shore, kept them as
much as possible on board; and never suffered them to quit the
ship but when the exigences of the armament required it. The
Commodore was resolved to keep strictly to this regulation,
during the whole time that he should be stationed on the coast of
Africa.</p>
<p>The variation of the needle was found by an average of sixteen
observations taken on board, fourteen of the azimuth and two of
the ortive amplitude, to be 8&deg; 7' 7" E.</p>
<p>The result of two observations taken by Citizen Bertrand, one
of the astronomers to the expedition, on the terrace of a house
in the town, gave 21&deg; 33' E.</p>
<p>The observations taken on board appeared more to be confided
in than the others, as they agreed with the progressive
diminution of the variation which we had observed since our
departure from Brest, and with the observations that had been
taken long since by different other navigators.</p>
<p>The dip of the needle was now at 62&deg; 25'. The same needle
had pointed 71&deg; 30' at Brest, and 72&deg; 56' at Paris.</p>
<p>The place where we lay at anchor in the road of Teneriffe was
28&deg; 29' 35" N. lat. 18&deg; 86' [sic] E. long.</p>
<p>The thermometer and barometer, observed on board towards noon,
varied very little during our stay in this place. The former
never rose above 20&deg; two tenths, nor the latter above 28
inches two lines.</p>
<p>The station of St Croix is a very excellent one, on account of
the plentiful supply which it affords of all sorts of European
kitchen-vegetables, cabbages excepted, which, though very small,
are sold at an exorbitantly high price. Most of the
orchard-fruits of Europe are likewise to be met with here, and
the same domestic animals as in the ports of France.</p>
<p>Experience had taught us that the sheep of this island do not
bear confinement on board so well as ours. The pure air which
they have been accustomed to breathe on the mountains where they
feed, renders them the more susceptible of injury from the impure
air between-decks.</p>
<p>Teneriffe also affords great abundance of dried fish. They
particularly carry on an extensive traffic with the species
termed <i>bonite</i>.</p>
<p>Those parts of the island upon which the labour of cultivation
has been bestowed, are very fertile, as is generally the case in
volcanic islands. The internal heat of the earth which forms
their basis, exhales towards the surface of the ground a portion
of the rain-water which they have imbibed, which produces a
remarkably luxuriant vegetation.</p>
<p>On the other hand the too slow decomposition of some of these
volcanic stones, and the extreme dryness of some of the
mountains, render many parts of the island unfit for cultivation.
The action of the fire to which they have been exposed at
different periods after long intervals, as attested by historical
records, together with the shelter which they receive from the
plants peculiar to those situations, retarding in many places
that gradual decomposition which would otherwise have taken
place, had they been left entirely bare.</p>
<p>No volcanic eruption had been known in this island, since that
which broke out ninety-two years ago, till in the month of May,
1796, a new eruption took place on the south-east side of the
peak, as I was informed by Citizen Gicquel, officer of marines,
who spent some time at St. Croix on his return in the frigate La
R&eacute;g&eacute;ner&eacute;e from the Isle de France.</p>
<p>I shall insert the account which I received of this event from
Citizen le Gros, Consul of the French Republic.</p>
<p>"On the 21st day of May, 1796, the inhabitants of St. Croix
heard some hollow reiterated sounds, very like the distant report
of cannon; in the night-time they felt a flight trembling of the
earth, and on the following morning a volcano was observed to
have broken out on the south-east side of the peak. During the
first days after its eruption, it appeared to have fifteen
mouths, their number was soon reduced to twelve, and at the end
of a month only two were to be seen, which threw out with their
lava large masses of rock, that often preferred their line of
projection for a space of fifteen seconds before they fell to the
ground."</p>
<p>Before our arrival at Teneriffe our vessels had been so
encumbered with their stores, that we scarcely knew how to
dispose of our crew.</p>

<p>A VERY high swell of the sea had prevented us almost two days
from getting our provisions on board. We were not ready to set
sail till the 23d of October.</p>
<p>We endeavoured at the first dawn to get under way. All our
boats had been taken on board the preceding day as soon as we had
unmoored; as we wished to take advantage of the land-wind, which
blows here almost every morning. It was likewise necessary that
we should put out to sea before the flood-tide, which was
expected to let in about half an hour after five.</p>
<p>We held by a cable to the English corvette. I cannot omit this
opportunity of commending the polite behaviour of the English
captain, who gave us, in the most obliging manner, every
assistance that we stood in need of to enable us to get under
way. Our Commander on his part had likewise done him every
service in his power; when he came to anchor in the roads a few
days after our arrival. One of the anchors of the English sloop
helped us to heave down, and having spread our sails, we steered
off from the coast under a slight breeze, which did not continue
long enough for the Esperance to take advantage of it, although
she had unfurled her sails a few minutes after our vessel.
Carried away by the flood, the force of which had not at first
been perceived, the was obliged to case a final anchor, by which
the hauled in order to keep off from the coast while the
endeavoured to stand clear of the vessels about her.</p>
<p>At half after nine o'clock the stood towards us. We then
directed our course S.S.E.</p>
<p>At noon we were in 28&deg; 5' 40" N. lat. 18&deg; 36' 40" E.
long. At this spot we set the peak of Teneriffe E. 28&deg; N. and
the eastern point of the island of Canary E. 24&deg; S.</p>
<p>We then steered, about one o'clock in the afternoon, S.E.S.
with a view to pass between the Cape Verd islands and the main
land. We had a pretty fresh east breeze.</p>
<p>About six in the evening the island Gomere bore N. 38&deg;
E.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the Esperance told us her longitude, after having
enquired to know ours. The great difference between the longitude
of our reckoning, and that taken by observation, threw us into
some uncertainty, which induced us to bear down two rhomb-lines
starboard from our former S.E.S. course; but subsequent
observations determined us to resume our first direction. The
weather was very fine, and we had nothing, to fear from
approaching the African coast; besides, we knew from our
soundings that it was many leagues distant.</p>
<p>On the following morning we were out of sight of land, which
convinced us that the observations taken on board the Esperance
were erroneous.</p>
<p>We crossed the Tropic of Cancer about one o'clock in the
afternoon, in 20&deg; E. long. The barometer indicated 28 inches
2 4-5ths lines.</p>
<p>The first fish that would bite at the hook of our fishermen,
was a very fine dorado (<i>coryph&aelig;na hyppurus</i>). This
was sufficient to put the whole crew in motion; but the fisherman
had the mortification of finding only a part of its gills upon
his hook, as he had drawn the line too hastily.</p>
<p>Since our departure, from Teneriffe the wind had blown pretty
steadily from the N.E. point.</p>
<p>A swallow of the common species (<i>hirundo rustica</i>),
undoubtedly lately come from Europe, followed us for some time,
without lighting upon the veal; but soon directed its slight
right towards the African coast, where it was sure of finding the
insects on which it feeds. We were now about 28&deg; N. lat.
22&deg; 30' E. long.</p>
<p>As there was very little wind, we observed great number of the
<i>medusa caravela</i> floating upon the surface of the water.
This plant should not be touched unguardedly, as, like many other
kinds of sea-nettles, it raises blisters upon the hand, that
afterwards become very painful.</p>
<p>The species of remora, known by the name of <i>echineis
remora</i>, generally follows the shark, as it finds sufficient
nourishment in the excrements of that voracious fish. It does
not, however, attach itself so exclusively to the shark as not to
follow other large fishes also, and even vessels, to which it
sixes itself when it is fatigued with swimming.</p>
<p>In the night we observed that our vessel was followed by a
large shoal of dorados. As they swam much faster than we sailed,
they often moved in a circular course round our vessel with
incredible swiftness. Although the night was very dark, it was
easy to follow them with the eye, as they leave a luminous track
behind them. This phosphoric light, produced in the agitated
water of the sea, appears the more brilliant in proportion to the
darkness of the night, and the velocity with which the fishes
move; so that we were able to discern their track very
distinctly, although they swam several feet below the surface of
the water.</p>
<p>30th. We were now in those seas that abound with voracious
fillies, such as the <i>bonito</i>, the <i>tunny</i>, and others
of the same class, which find plenty of food amongst the
different species of fish on which they prey; the principal of
which is the flying-fish (<i>exoc&oelig;tus volitans</i>, Linn.).
The bonitos that followed us were easily caught by our fishermen,
though they used no other bait than a bunch of feathers, bound up
so as to resemble a flying-fish, within which the hook was
concealed.</p>
<p>We had been almost becalmed for some time, but the regular
winds began to recover their force. They were again interrupted
on the 3d of November by a storm, which continued during the
whole night; the next morning they blew as on the preceding days.
On the 6th they left us at 9&deg; 6' N. lat. 21&deg; E. long.</p>
<p>The heat was now excessive, though the thermometer was only
23&deg; above o of Reaumur's scale.</p>
<p>A bird, called by Buffon <i>goeland noir</i> (<i>larus
marinus</i>, Linn.), having lighted upon one of the yards,
escaped from a sailor, who had climbed up the mast, in the very
instant when he was about to seize it.</p>
<p>A prodigious number of bonitos followed us day and night; and
it was a matter of great astonishment to us, that they were able
to keep up with us so long without taking any rest.</p>
<p>The <i>motteux</i> of Buffon (<i>motacilla amanthe</i>,
Linn.), fatigued with its long flight over the sea, lighted upon
our vessel, and suffered itself to be taken.</p>
<p>We were becalmed for seventeen days in lat. 5&deg; N. We
afterwards had storms, followed by squalls, that varied from
E.N.E. to S.S.W. having veered round by south.</p>
<p>The tempest-bird (<i>procellaria pelagica</i>, Linn.) is not
so sure an indication of a storm, but that its appearance is
often followed by a calm of several days duration. It was a
pleasing sight to observe these little birds flying close to the
stern of our vessel, in quest of their food, which they find upon
the surface of the ocean.</p>
<p>We were mortified to find that the vegetables and fruits,
which we had bought at Teneriffe, did not keep; as their
corruption was greatly accelerated by the heat and moisture that
prevails during the calms of this zone. We had reason to believe
that as they had been gathered in a very hot and dry climate,
they would have kept much better than those of Europe.</p>
<p>A small shark (<i>squalis carcharias</i>, Linn.) fell a victim
to his voraciousness. As soon as they had hauled him on deck, he
was immediately cut in pieces, and every one had his share. The
shark however is very poor food; for besides the natural
abhorrence which the flesh of an animal that devours human bodies
must excite, it is very difficult of digestion; but at sea we
cannot choose our dishes, and fresh provisions are always
preferable to salted.</p>
<p>I found attached to the higher orifice of his stomach a number
of worms of the genus <i>doris</i> of Linn&aelig;us. They were
about an inch and a half in length, and did not easily let go
their hold, although the shark was dead. I observed them now and
then shoot out the two <i>tentacula</i> that belong to the
characteristics of this genus.</p>
<p>The situation of the mouth of the shark, under his long upper
jaw, obliges him to turn himself almost round upon his back in
order to seize any object above him; so that his white belly,
which the transparency of the sea-water renders distinguishable
even at a great depth below the surface, points out to the
fisherman the exact moment when he ought to draw his line, in
order to fasten this voracious fish to his hook.</p>
<p>Nature has amply provided it with the means of securing its
prey; for besides several rows of teeth formed in the manner most
adapted for penetrating the hardest bodies, the internal part of
the mouth is likewise furnished with various asperities that
serve to prevent the egress of any instance that it has laid hold
of.</p>
<p>Had we been trading to India, we should not have sailed to
coiled a quantity of the fins of this fish, as they are in great
request amongst the Chinese, who believe them to be a very
powerful aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>When the air was calm the heat was extremely oppressive; the
thermometer however stood no higher than 23&deg;; although we
were not more than 9&deg; north of the equator. Our longitude was
20&deg; 50' east. It appears that in these parts the thermometer
affords a very inadequate standard of the sensible heat of the
atmosphere; for though it. indicated several degrees lower than
what we frequently experience in the warm summer weather of
Europe; the heat threw us into a most profuse perspiration, which
gave rise to very troublesome effervescenses of the blood.</p>
<p>Between the tropics, the mercury in the barometer stands at a
very uniform height. We never observed it to vary more than an
inch and a half, More or less. It generally stood at 28 inches 2
lines, although the atmosphere was often agitated by violent
forms, which being generated in the interior of Africa, from the
coast of which we were not more than about 300,000 toises
distant, were brought over to us by winds from N.E. and
E.N.E.</p>
<p>12th. We here caught the fish known among the ichthyologists
by the name of <i>ballistes verrucosus</i>. A great number of a
small species of whales (<i>soufflers</i>) swam about our ships,
followed in their tardy course by sharks which fed upon their
excrements.</p>
<p>A squall from the S.E. gave us intimation of the gales from
the same quarter, that prevailed in the distant regions under the
equator; though they blow there generally from the N.E. during
this season, when the sun remains almost two months within the
Tropic of Capricorn.</p>
<p>14th. A shark that had been preceded by a number of the fishes
called <i>pilots</i> (<i>gasterosteus ductor</i>, Linn.), was
caught by our sailors. Some remoras, that thought themselves in
safety as long as they remained fixed to the body of the shark,
kept their hold still for a considerable time after the fish had
been brought upon deck.</p>
<p>As the weather was excessively hot, and the sea very tranquil,
Piron and Saint-Aignan, unable to resist their desire of cooling
themselves by bathing, plunged themselves a few hours afterwards
into the sea, at the hazard of becoming the prey of another
shark.</p>
<p>It had remained calm almost the whole day; but about eight in
the evening the skies were covered to the south-east with thick
clouds, that portended a violent storm. The night was very dark;
and soon a luminous column of immense height was seen to descend
from there clouds, and illumine the surface of the water. The
scintillation of the sea was for some time interrupted by several
intervals, during which it was quite dark; when all of a sudden
the whole surface of the sea appeared covered with a sheet of
fire, extending in our direction. This sheet was pushed along by
a very high gale, which raised the waves to a great pitch; and we
saw ourselves surrounded with a sea of flames, which afforded one
of the most brilliant spectacles in nature. This ph&oelig;nomenon
very soon disappeared; but the sea appeared during the whole
night much more luminous than usual wherever it was agitated,
particularly at the wake of the ship and the top of the
waves.</p>
<p>The force of the gale had obliged us to strike our top-sails,
and even to bear down, for fear of being taken aback.</p>
<p>The heat had been very oppressive during the whole day. We
were now sailing off the immense gulph formed by the coasts of
upper Guinea, the shores of which extend almost 1,500,000 toises
to the eastward.</p>
<p>The sea is flinch more phosphoric in the vicinity of the
coasts situated between the tropics, than any where else, because
those animals, upon which its phosphorescence depends, abound
there much more than in any other part of the ocean; a fact,
which I have had opportunity of remarking in, parts of the ocean
very distant from each other. I shall enter into some
investigation of this ph&oelig;nomenon.</p>
<p>As we had this gulph under our lee, the currents had carried
over to us many of the luminous substances, with which it
abounds; but it required the concurrence of another circumstance
iii order to produce so vivid a light as we wit-mired. The clouds
that hung over the quarter from whence the wind arose, had
imparted to the atmosphere a superabundance of electricity, which
was one of the principal agents in producing the luminosity of
the water.</p>
<p>The electric state of the atmosphere was proved to me by the
unusual repulsion between the two balls of my electrometer.</p>
<p>15th. A slight breeze from the south-east led us to hope that
we should soon be delivered from the calms, that prevail to a
greater extent in these situations than in any other part of the
ocean. These differences are particularly observable upon a
voyage to India, and appear to depend chiefly upon the vicinity
of the African coast, to which ships, sailing from Europe to the
Cape, approach much nearer, than those which sail from the Cape
to Europe; thus the former voyages generally require a longer
space of time to be accomplished than the latter.</p>
<p>Many able seamen think it advisable to cross the Line much
further to the eastward than is commonly done.</p>
<p>The calms which prevail northward of the equator depend upon
the configuration of the African coast, which projects, at the
distance of a few degrees from the Line, nearly 1,500,000 toises
eastward; whilst the great distance at which one sails from the
coast, after having crossed the equator, prevents the winds,
generally prevalent in this part of the ocean, from being
modified by the land breezes.</p>
<p>I had kept some bottles of the sea-water, which I had
collected the night before, during its phosphorescence, for the
purpose of examining the small luminous substances which occasion
this ph&oelig;nomenon. Having inclosed some of this water in a
vial, I agitated it in the dark, and presently observed luminous
globules arising within it, which appeared perfectly similar to
those that are seen in the agitated water of the ocean. I tried
the simple experiment of separating these particles from the
water, in order to learn whether it would still retain its
phosphorescent quality. Upon filtrating it, by means of a piece
of blotting-paper, a number of minute, transparent particles,
gelatinous in their consistence, and of a globular form, were
left upon the filtre. The water had now entirely lost its
phosphorescent quality, which I again restored to it by mixing it
with those particles. If there small animalcula be exposed for
any considerable time to the air, they lose their phosphorescent
properties.</p>
<p>I have frequently repeated the same experiment upon water
collected in different parts of the ocean, and have uniformly
found it to contain the same sort of animalcula, which I
therefore confider to be the principal cause of the
phosphorescence of the sea. Other substances, however, possess
likewise the property of giving this appearance to the sea; for
many species of the crab, and other marine insects of
considerable bulk, sometimes ascend from its bottom, and give a
luminous appearance to the surface. I have seen some of these
phosphoric animals of more than half a foot in length, but they
were always accompanied by the small animalcula above
mentioned.</p>
<p>We were informed to-day that they had thrown into the lea,
from on board the Esperance, four of the sheep they had brought
with them from Teneriffe, because some persons had imagined that
they had observed upon them symptoms of that disease which our
nation is accused of having imported into Europe, from America.
The monks of the island from whence they had brought the sheep,
had to suffer many severe sarcasms upon this occasion; though I
believe them to have been destitute of foundation; for I have
little doubt, that if the animals had been subjected to a more
accurate examination, the crew would not have been deprived of so
considerable a part of their live-stock.</p>
<p>Breezes from the S.S.E., which began to blow on the 21st of
November, we being in lat. 4&deg; 31' long. 18&deg; 36' W. at
length put an end to the calms, which at this period of the year
are generally experienced several degrees further to the south,
before one arrives at the track of the regular winds.</p>
<p>The bird known among ornithologists by the name of
<i>pelecanus aquilus</i> excited our admiration, We observed two
of them who, whilst they hovered at an immense height, espied
their prey in the water, expecting the moment when it should
appear near enough to the surface for them to dart down and seize
it.</p>
<p>The reason why these birds hover at such a prodigious height
above the ocean, is, undoubtedly, that they may take in a more
extensive view of its surface; but it is astonishing that they
are able at that distance to perceive the small fishes upon which
they generally feed. It is a subject well worthy to be
investigated by natural philosophers, whether this piercing
vision depends more upon the sensibility of the retina, or (as I
father suppose it does), upon the disposition of the humours of
their eye.</p>
<p>The pelican is known to be a great destroyer of the
flying-fish. As soon as it espies one of these fishes, it
descends from the more elevated regions of the atmosphere, and
remains hovering about fifty toises above the surface of the
water, In order to seize its prey whenever it quits the sea. All
the motions of the pelican are concluded with admirable
dexterity; it does not dart head foremost, like most other birds
that seek their food in the water; but placing its feet and neck
horizontally and level with each other, it strikes the air above
it with its pinions, and then laying them crossways upon its
back, so as to afford the least possible resistance to the
atmosphere, darts down upon its prey, and seizes it almost the
instant it has left the water.</p>
<p>We all of us pitied the poor flying-fish when we observed the
astonishing skill of its enemy, which very seldom misses its aim.
As the flying-fish raises itself but to a very small distance
from the surface of the sea, the pelican would run the risk of
falling into the water, did it not possess the art of breaking
its fall by suddenly expanding its wings, so as to be immediately
able to mount again in quest of another victim.</p>
<p>Though nature has given the flying-fish the power of living
both in the water and in the air, it is very difficult for them
to escape from their numerous enemies. If they evade the pursuit
of the bonitos and dorados, by quitting the water, the pelican
awaits them in the air. Some of them, reduced to this dilemma,
were obliged to light upon our vessel.</p>
<p>I found in the stomachs of several bonitos a number of worms,
that ought to be classed among the genus <i>fasciola</i> of
Linn&aelig;us, though their inferior extremity, which is almost
cylindrical, has a very distinguishable bulb. They are about four
lines in length, and terminate in a tube which composes about
half their dimensions.</p>
<p>The winds from the south and south-east continued to blow with
such obstinacy, that we were not able to cross the Line till in
the night of the 28th, about eleven o'clock, in 26&deg; E. long.
though our design had been to cross it about eight or ten degrees
farther eastward.</p>
<p>These south and south-east winds are not common in these
latitudes at this time of the year; for the sun being already
considerably advanced in the Tropic of Capricorn, the regular
winds generally veer round to the east. The calms, in consequence
of which we had got every day 6 or 8' further northward, and the
gales from the south and south-east, were the causes of our being
so long detained by these winds.</p>
<p>Near as we were to the Equator, the thermometer, as observed
for the last eight days, had not stood higher than 21 or 22&deg;.
It was a matter of surprise to us, that being so near the Line,
the thermometer did not indicate a higher degree of heat; but
besides general causes, such as the absorption of the rays of the
sun by the water of the ocean, and the comparatively inferior
density of the water, together with the evaporation that takes
place from it, which prevent an equal degree of heat being
communicated to the atmosphere with what it acquires from the
land, we had for several days had a slight breeze which
contributed not a little to cool the air.</p>
<p>The sailors have a custom of ducking persons who cross the
Line for the first time, with the sea-water. This operation is
performed by pouring several pails of water over their heads; and
is frequently conducted in such a manner, as to afford a great
deal of merriment to those who know themselves exempted from
being the subjects of it. One of the sailors, who calls himself
the Good Man of the Line, lets himself down from the main-top,
with a large beard of tow fastened to hi chin, and presides at
this nautical diversion.</p>
<p>Our Commander, apprehensive that this sort of cold bathing
might not agree very well with some of us, forbade its being
performed upon any of the passengers.</p>
<p>On the 29th of November, Beaum&eacute;'s a&euml;rometer for
salts gave me 3&deg; 4-5ths. We were then half a degree south of
the Line.</p>
<p>The currents carried us somewhat eastward of our former
course. The principal cause of the different currents in the wide
ocean is known to arise from the action of the winds. We had,
every reason to expect a long passage. The Esperance, however,
kept her luff much better than our vessel. We were apprehensive
left our want of water might put us under the necessity of
steering for the coast of Brazil. This circumstance would have
been the more embarrassing to us, as it would have deranged the
whole plan of our expedition; for the investigations we intended
to make in several of the countries that we were about to visit,
were to be determined by the season of the year.</p>
<p>On the 17th of December we crossed the Tropic of Capricorn, in
28&deg; W. long.</p>
<p>On board the Esperance they often caught more than a hundred
bonitoes in the course of a day, whilst the most dexterous
fishermen in our vessel never took more than ten in the same
space of time, and very seldom as many. It was however a matter
of great consequence to the health of the crew, that they should
be supplied with fresh provisions.</p>
<p>On the 18th of December we were in lat. 25&deg; 20' S. and
long. 28&deg; 42' W. when the thermometer observed at noon
indicated only 19&deg; above 0, although the sun was very near
our zenith; before sun-rise it had been 17&frac12;&deg;. In the
night-time the cold had been so considerable as to oblige our
sailors to take to their woollen clothes.</p>
<p>We had thought ourselves sure of meeting with easterly gales
as we approached the Brazilian coast; they, however, blew from
the east; but having drawn aft, we were enabled to keep our sails
pretty full for the space of a fortnight, till we were in 28&deg;
S. lat. and 24&deg; W. long.</p>
<p>We might have expected in this latitude to meet with
favourable winds for steering towards the Cape of Good Hope; but
all the variation that took place was still more to our
disadvantage.</p>
<p>On the 28th of December we had full S.E. winds, though we were
already beyond 29&frac12;&deg; S. lat. The heat of the sun having
been for several months at its greatest height in this
hemisphere, had changed the direction of the regular winds.</p>
<p>The length of our passage had reduced our allowance of water
to one bottle a day.</p>
<p>As soon as the winds had veered from N.E. to N. the currents,
which bore till then to the east, became scarcely
perceptible.</p>
<p>Though we were at so great a distance from the Cape of Good
Hope, we observed a great number of albatrosses (<i>diomedea
exulans</i>).</p>
<p>It is a remarkable circumstance, that the variation of the
magnetic needle is much greater to the south of the Line, than it
is to the north; for between 14&deg; N. lat. and the Equator, in
the space contained between 23&deg; and 26&deg; W. long., the
difference had not been more than 3&deg;, or from 14&deg; to
11&deg;; whilst in the same extent of south latitude, between
26&deg; and 30&deg; W. long. the compass varied eight degrees to
the east, or from 11&deg; to 3&deg;. Might not the vicinity of
the coast of Brazil be one of the principal causes of this
difference?</p>
<p>The smallest variation observed was that of 1&deg; 50', in
25&deg; S. lat. and 29&deg; W. long. It cannot be doubted that
the change of situation with respect to longitude has a much
greater influence upon the variation of the needle, than change
of latitude. The variation increased sensibly in proportion as we
advanced farther eastward.</p>
<p>One of our officers who was taking the distances between the
sun and moon, in a very incommodious situation, with a copper
sextant made by Dollond, the radius of which was a foot in
length, discovered a cause productive of error in the
calculations, which one should hardly have suspected, The radii
of this instrument, though very heavy, were still so slender as
to bend when it was pressed with any degree of force against the
breast, whereby the parallelism of the specula was deranged. The
same effect does not take place with sextants made of wood, for
their radii, being much stronger than those of copper, do not
yield to that degree of pressure which bends the others.</p>
<p>This source of error affords an additional reason why mariners
ought to give the preference to the circle of reflexion, invented
by Citizen Borda. The facility with which any errors that may
arise from the graduation, are reified by cross observations, in
the use of this instrument, gives it a very great superiority
over all others.</p>
<p>I regret that this valuable instrument, though so early in its
application, is not more generally in use. Each of our officers
possessed one of them, and during the course of the expedition
every one learnt to use it with certainty.</p>
<p>With a little practice an observer may take the longitude
within 10, or 15,000 toises; and there is reason to believe, that
when the lunar tables shall have attained a greater degree of
perfection, the observations will approximate still nearer to the
truth.</p>
<p>Though the plants which I had collected at Teneriffe were very
dry when we sailed from that island, they were become much
damaged by the moisture which they had imbibed, during the time
that we were between the Tropics, particularly at the lower part
of the leaves, where the absorbent vessels of the plant are known
to abound more than in any other of its parts.</p>
<p>The water held in a state of solution by the atmosphere, in
consequence of the heat which it acquires from the perpendicular
rays of the sun, is so much greater in quantity than what it can
retain in situations not exposed to an equal degree of heat, that
every thing that is not exposed to the direct rays of the sun,
becomes covered with a great degree of moisture; so that it is
very difficult to preserve instruments of iron, or even of the
most highly polished steel, from the rust.</p>
<p>During the whole period of time that we were sailing round the
Tropics, the barometer had not stood higher than 28 inches 4
lines, nor lower than 28 inches 1-10th lines.</p>
<p>We knew very well that our provision of water could not retain
its freshness in the extreme heat of this climate; but one should
hardly have imagined, that whilst we had means on board of
restoring its purity, they should not have been put effectually
in practice, before distributing to the crew their daily
allowance.</p>
<p>Water that is kept for a long time on board, undergoes the
same sort of decomposition which takes place in stagnant pools;
and this process is considerably accelerated by the influence of
a hot climate. A great quantity of inflammable air is then
disengaged from it; so that a person who goes into the hold where
it is stowed, runs the hazard of being suffocated. This, however,
is an accident that very rarely happens, as a part of the noxious
vapours are discharged by the passage leading into the hold.
Nevertheless, there vapours frequently give rise to nervous
fevers amongst the crew, the malignity of which, is in proportion
to the heat by which the decomposition of the water is
effected.</p>
<p>As this <i>gas</i>, the specific gravity of which was first
determined by Priestley, is considerably lighter than
atmospherical air, and has likewise very little attraction for
the water; it is very easily separated, so as to restore water to
its former purity; nothing more being necessary than to agitate
the fluid for the space of a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>We had a machine on board which was perfectly adapted to this
purpose. It consisted of a large bucket, about five cubic feet in
capacity, which being filled to about two-thirds with water, four
large flat pieces of iron were turned round in the middle of the
vessel, by means of a handle and balance-wheel. By this operation
the water in the bucket was violently agitated, and whilst the
inflammable air, with which it had been impregnated, was
disengaged, it absorbed a quantity of pure air from the
atmosphere, to supply the place of that which it had lost; so
that putrid as it had been before; it soon recovered its original
freshness.</p>
<p>This process, so easy in its execution, affords a satisfactory
answer to the many enquiries that have been made concerning the
means employed by mariners to render water potable, after it has
lost this quality by being kept long in the ship.</p>
<p>It will scarcely be credited, that though we were able to
purify the water according to the simple method just described,
that which was distributed in the vessel often stunk nearly as
much as when it was first brought out of the hold. The cause of
this neglect arose from the circumstance, that the officer, who
had the charge of inspecting the operation, usually committed it
to one of the sailors, who, soon tired with turning the handle,
delivered it out before it had become potable. It was very justly
observed on board, that it would have been much better had this
charge been committed to the surgeon, as the health of the crew
depended so much upon its being well performed, It was
nevertheless left in the hands of the officer of the watch.</p>
<p>On the 29th of December, the sky being very clear, the
thermometer indicated 17&deg; 8-10ths, and the barometer 28
inches 3 9-10ths lines; when a breeze suddenly springing up from
N.N.E. brought with it a thick fog, which concealed sun from our
view for the space of a quarter of an hour. It is very remarkable
that the mercury in the barometer, instead of falling in
consequence of this change of weather, stood a line and a half
higher than before, during the whole time that the fog continued.
I dare not hazard any conjecture of my own in order to account
for this ph&oelig;nomenon, which will appear the more astonishing
to persons conversant in natural philosophy, as this circumstance
ought to have diminished the elasticity of the air instead of
augmenting it; besides, there was no reason to believe that the
fog was occasioned by the explosion of any volcano.</p>
<p>On the 3d of January we enjoyed the spectacle of a lunar
rainbow. This planet was encompassed, at ten o'clock in the
evening, with two concentric circles, that presented all the
colours of the solar rainbow in reverted order. The largest of
the circles did no occupy more than five degrees in the sky.</p>
<p>As this ph&oelig;nomenon, produced by the decomposition of the
rays of the moon, appeared be tween the planet and us, the
prismatical colours naturally presented themselves in an order
the reverse of what takes place in the solar rainbow; because in
the latter case the spectator is situated between the rainbow and
the sun. Thus the smaller circle was terminated at its interior
margin by the red colour, and at its exterior by the violet;
whilst the largest exhibited the red at its exterior, and the
violet at its interior.</p>
<p>We were then in lat. 32&deg; 42' S. long. 7&deg; E.</p>
<p>On the 7th of January we passed under the meridian of Paris,
in 33&deg; S. lat.</p>
<p>Having plunged the a&euml;rometer of Beaum&eacute; in the
sea-water, in order to determine its specific gravity, it
indicated 3&deg; 4-5ths. I had obtained the same result from a
similar experiment which I made near the Equator. Hence it
appears that the saltness of the sea does not perceptibly vary in
different parts of the ocean, though very distant from each
other, and heated to very different degrees of temperature by the
rays of the sun.</p>
<p>On the 9th, we began to exercise the crews of both ships in
shooting at a mark. A prize of small value was the reward of
those who hit an object fixed to one of the fore-sail booms. We
were pleased to observe that most of our men took very good aim,
though they had never been accustomed to the use of fire-arms. It
was a matter of consequence, in an expedition like ours, in the
course of which we might sometimes be under the necessity of
defending ourselves against the attempts of the savages, that
every one of our company should understand the use of such arms
as we had on board.</p>
<p>The captain of the Esperance having ordered an half of a very
fine tunny to be tied to a buoy and thrown into the water, as a
present to our Commander; it did not float near enough to our
vessel to enable us to take it up, when one of the sailors
plunged into the sea in order to swim after it, although it was
known that a shark had been caught that very morning by the crew
of the Esperance, and the calmness of the weather afforded an
additional ground of apprehension, lest one of our best seamen
might fall a prey to another of these animals.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding we had already reached the thirty-third degree
of south lat., being in 5&deg; E. long., the bonitos still
continued to follow us in as numerous shoals as ever; though they
are seldom known to abound at so high a degree of latitude. The
north winds were probably the occasion of their leaving their
usual haunts.</p>
<p>I must do the crew of our ships the justice to remark, that if
they were less skilled in fishing than the crew of the Esperance,
they also laboured under certain disadvantages which the others
did not. It was the business of the boatswain to furnish the
sailors with lines, which ours distributed throughout the whole
expedition with so much parsimony, that the sailors lost all
their inclination for this occupation. The inspecting officer
ought to have apprised him of the pernicious consequences
resulting from this mistaken piece of economy; but he neglected
to do it.</p>
<p>The animal known by the name of <i>medusa velella</i>, was
induced, by the tranquil state of the sea, to rise to the surface
of the water, where we observed large numbers of this species.
They were precisely similar to those which I have often met with
in the Mediterranean, where the sailors confider them very
delicious eating.</p>
<p>The success of our expedition depended very much upon the
ships being such as did not water; we had, however, scarcely left
the roads of Brest, when we were obliged to pump the vessels. As
our ship made three-fourths of an inch water every hour, we were
under the necessity, of pumping it twice every day. This
precaution was the more indispensable, as the water had already
attacked our salt provisions, the preservation of which was an
object of the greatest importance on a voyage like ours. Very
fortunately, that which got into the hold did not penetrate
far.</p>
<p>The space between decks was so much lumbered, that it lasted
several months before we could find out the spot where it leaked,
which at last was discovered to be behind one of the knees. Upon
lightening the vessel, we found that one of the tree-nails had
been forgotten, and the place where it ought to have been
inserted smeared over with tar. Having bolted it properly, we
were enabled to keep the ship dry.</p>
<p>The albatrosses of the Cape of Good Hope, which began to
appear in large flocks, shewed us that we were approaching to the
southern extremity of Africa. We descried the land about eight
o'clock in the morning of the 10th of January. Table Bay was then
about 20,000 toises distant from us.</p>
<p>The currents, which had made us fall off so much from our
course whilst we were in the track of the regular winds, having
fortunately taken an opposite direction where we met with the
variable ones; what we had lost to the west was very nearly made
up to us by what we gained to the east, as appeared when we made
the land of the Cape of Good Hope. It is evident that the
tendency of the seas to preserve the level, some few
irregularities proceeding from the variable winds excepted, ought
to induce mariners, in the parts where there winds prevail, to
bear down to the east in proportion as the general winds
determine the currents to the west.</p>
<p>We had another indication of our being near the land in the
difference of colour of the water, arising from the shallowness
of its bottom.</p>
<p>Some seals, of the species called by Linn&aelig;us <i>phoca
pusilla</i>, approached very near to our vessel in quest of their
food amongst the large masses of <i>fucus pyriformis</i>, which
floated upon the water. There animals often escaped from our
sailors by taking several successive leaps over the water. This
they perform by placing their hinder paws together, so as to
resemble the broad tail of a fish, and act with considerable
resistance against the surface of the water, over which they
bound like a nimble quadruped over a level plain.</p>
<p>We fell a little to leeward of the mouth of Table Bay, which
gave us hopes of coming to anchor in the course of the day. It
was not, however, the most favourable weather for making the
land; for the day was very rainy, and the coast often concealed
by a thick fog from our view.</p>
<p>About seven in the evening we were between 7 and 8,000 toises
from the mountain of Hout Bay, which bore E. 3&deg; 45' N. The
foreland of the Cape bore N.N.E. The Lion's-head E. 3&deg; N. Our
soundings gave us here the depth of water at seventy toises over
a bottom of coral.</p>
<p>The sea appeared very phosphorescent throughout the whole
night which we spent off the coast. A great number of luminous
specks were observable wherever the water was agitated. This
phosphorescence differed in no other respect from that usually
observed at sea, than in its greater intensity, proceeding from
the superabundance of phosphoric globules. Such phosphoric
substances abound much more in the vicinity of the land, than in
the open sea at the same latitude; as I have remarked upon a
former occasion.</p>
<p>A slight S.E. breeze enabled us in the afternoon of the
following day to direct our course towards the mouth of Table
Bay. As soon as it blew a little fresher, we steered with full
sails towards the <i>Point des Pendus</i>, ranging very near to
the coast, our depth according to the soundings being pretty
uniformly about five toises.</p>
<p>About half an hour after five we cast anchor in a bottom of
muddy grey sand, at the depth of about twenty-four feet, and
distant 5,130 toises from the shore. The principal steeple in the
town bore E. 38&deg; S. The flag upon the Croupe de Lion E.
3&deg; N. The flag at the northernmost side of the fort E.
48&deg; N. The Island Robben N. 1&deg; W.</p>
<p>We had not a single sick man on board, although the length of
our passage had reduced us to a very scanty daily allowance of
water; but we had endeavoured to compensate for the want of it by
a copious use of various antiscorbutic remedies. A very wholesome
and pleasant kind of punch, made of brandy, vinegar, sugar and
water, had been daily distributed amongst our crew towards the
latter end of the passage. The ships were fumigated every day,
and we were very careful that the sailors should change their
clothes whenever they had got wet. It was a satisfaction to us to
find that these precautions had not been taken in vain.</p>

<p>TWO officers of health came on board from the Cape Town, in
order to learn whether any of our crew were infected with
contagious disorders. The small-pox is the disease most dreaded
by the inhabitants; for not being endemic, it occasions here, as
well as in every part of India, the most dreadful ravages,
whenever it is imported amongst them from foreign countries.</p>
<p>The master of a merchant vessel from Bourdeaux, which had
arrived here a few days before us, immediately came to acquaint
us that the Commander of the naval forces at Isle de France,
having received some information relative to the fate of La
P&eacute;rouse, had dispatched a frigate to the Cape, in order to
communicate his intelligence to the Commander of the expedition
sent in search of that unfortunate navigator. The frigate had
sailed from Isle de France a few days before our arrival.</p>
<p>Our Commander Dentrecasteaux dispatched an officer to the
Governor of the Cape to arrange the ceremonial of the salute.
This officer received from the <i>Charg&eacute; d'Affaires</i> of
France the dispatches which Citizen Saint-Felix, Commander of our
naval forces in the Indian seas, had sent to Dentrecasteaux by
the frigate Atalante, Captain Bolle, which had immediately sailed
back for Isle de France.</p>
<p>I shall here insert the letter addressed to our Commander,
with the depositions of two masters of merchant yards, who were
at Batavia during the stay which Commodore Hunter made at that
place, upon his return from Botany Bay in a Dutch vessel, after
he had been shipwrecked off Norfolk island.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Letter from Citizen Saint-Felix, Commander
of the Naval Forces of France in the Indian Seas, to General
Dentrecasteaux.</i></p>
<p>"I learn from private correspondence that you do not purpose
to touch at Isle de France till on your return from the important
expedition in which you are engaged. Disappointed in the hope,
with which I had flattered myself, of having the honour to
converse with you, I hasten to dispatch, in order that they may
find you at the Cape of Good Hope, two reports relative to the
object of your million, which I have lately received from the
masters of two French vessels arrived here from Batavia. You will
thereby he informed of the particulars, how a Dutch vessel,
having on board Commodore Hunter of the Sirius English frigate,
together with his ship's company, discovered near the Admiralty
Islands, in the South Sea, several persons clothed in European
manufactures, some of which, in particular, appeared to be French
uniforms. You will also be informed that the Commodore did not
doubt that these were remains of the shipwreck suffered by M. de
la P&eacute;rouse, whom he had often seen at Botany Bay.</p>
<p>"I conceived that the communication of these reports muff
interest you; and they appeared to me of so important a nature,
that I resolved to transmit them directly to you by a frigate,
which I have dispatched to the Cape for that express purpose.
Captain Bolle, who commands the vessel, will leave the papers in
the hands of our Charg&eacute; d'Affaires, in case he should not
meet you there; in order that they may be delivered to you
immediately upon your arrival, Though I have received no official
directions relative to your expedition, that authorize me to send
this frigate upon its present destination, yet I have no doubt
that the step I have taken will meet with the approbation of his
Majesty, both when I confider the interest of the public and the
sentiments of my own heart. It was reserved for you to acquire a
claim upon the gratitude of the whole French nation, by accepting
the command of an expedition which confers equal honour upon the
Sovereign who has ordered it, and the Commander to whom its
execution is intrusted. In every part of the globe that you may
visit, you shall ever be attended by my fervent wishes for your
success, and the inviolable and perfect attachment with which I
am, &amp;c.</p>

<p><small>Isle de France, 9th Nov. 1791.</small></p>
<p align="center"><i>Report delivered to Saint-Felix, Commander
of the Naval Forces of the French Nation in the Indian Seas, by
Captain Pr&eacute;audet, Master of the Jason, from
Batavia.</i></p>
<p>The Sirius English frigate, commanded by Commodore Hunter, and
bound for New Holland, was cast away off Norfolk Island in the
South Sea, towards the end of the year 1790. The ship's company
were taken on board a sloop that accompanied the frigate, and
carried to Botany Bay, where Commodore Phillip engaged a small
Dutch vessel to convey the shipwrecked crew, together with their
commander, to England.</p>
<p>Having sailed from Botany Bay in this vessel, with an intent
to touch at Batavia, they were carried by contrary winds and the
force of the currents as far eastwards as 167&deg; E. long,
meridian of Greenwich. Wishing to pass through the Straits of St.
George, they came within sight of the Admiralty Islands, situated
in 147&deg; E. long. 3&deg; 25' S. lat. Near to the most easterly
of these islands, they observed several boats, amongst the crews
of which there were many persons who wore European stuffs and
pieces of cloth in their dress; they even distinguished some who
were clothed in the uniform of the French Marine. These people
hung out the white flag as a signal for the English to approach;
but though Commodore Hunter was very desirous of doing it, he
found it impracticable, on account of the contrary currents and
winds, and the danger to which the numerous shoals would have
exposed them.</p>
<p>Commodore Hunter had often seen M. de la P&eacute;rouse at
Botany Bay, and lived upon terms of intimacy with him. He had
learnt from him that his intention was to pass through the
Straits of St. George, after leaving Botany Bay, and from thence
to direct his course to the northward. He does not doubt that the
Astrolabe and Boussole were cast away upon the abovementioned
islands, in consequence of the calms and strong currents that
prevail in those parts. He has informed me that he has been
carried by them six hundred miles to the eastward in the space of
ten days; as he knew from repeated observations of the longitude,
from the time-keepers, and from the bearings of the land. In a
word, Commodore Hunter, whom I saw at Batavia in the course of my
last voyage, appeared to me to be fully persuaded that the
European dresses, which he saw in the boats from the Admiralty
Islands, were collected from the wrecks of the vessels, formerly
under the command of La P&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p>Commodore Hunter is at present upon his return home to
England, from whence, he will probably transmit a more
circumstantial account of this affair to France.</p>
<p>From his own experience in approaching the Admiralty Islands,
the English Commander thinks that any vessel intending to sail
thither ought to endeavour to get early into its latitude, in
order to avoid being carried away by the currents, which set to
the east with prodigious strength.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Report delivered by Pierre Magon
L&eacute;pinay, Master of the Maria Helena, from Batavia, to
Saint Felix, Commander of the Naval Forces of France in the
Indian Seas.</i></p>
<p>The commander and officers of the Sirius English frigate,
after being shipwrecked off Norfolk Island, were carried to
Botany Bay, from whence they sailed in a small Dutch vessel for
Batavia, where they arrived towards the latter end of September,
in the present year, after a passage of about six months.</p>
<p>A day or two after they had weathered the Straits of St.
George, they found themselves as soon as it dawned within sight
of two of the Admiralty Islands, which were very near them; they
immediately sounded, but could not reach the bottom.</p>
<p>They afterwards observed two canoes that contained about
twelve men each, rowing from the islands towards them; but though
they would not come on board the vessel, they however approached
very near to it. There was then very little wind blowing. The
veal was exposed to a current which drove it off from the land;
any rate, the Dutch captain had no inclination to approach nearer
to the shore. It was observed that two of the men in the canoes
had sword-belts similar to those worn by European officers; they
made signs as if they wished to have their beards shaved, and
many of them had pieces of red and blue cloth about their dress,
which proved that they had had same communication with Europeans.
As Captain Hunter, Commander of the Sirius, had been informed at
Botany Bay by La P&eacute;rouse himself, that his intention was
to pass the Straits of St. George; all the officers of that
frigate were of opinion that they had thus unexpectedly
discovered the islands upon which he was cast away.</p>
<p>I, the underwritten, certify that the above narrative is
conformable to what I have collected from different conversations
with the officers of the Sirius, who had arrived at Batavia after
the shipwreck of that frigate, in a small Dutch vessel with which
I was in company during the month of October.</p>
<p align="right">(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAGON LEPINAY.</p>
<p><small>Isle de France, 31st Oct. 1791.</small></p>
<p>As Commodore Hunter was at the Cape of Good Hope, on his
return from Batavia to England, at the moment when we arrived
there; we had reason to expect that we should receive from him
every possible information concerning what he had seen at the
Admiralty Islands; but were surprized to hear that he had sailed
from the Cape two hours after we had cast anchor. He was probably
well acquainted with the object our expedition; for we were
expected at the Cape, and our Commander's flag must have
convinced him that these were the ships sent in search of La
P&eacute;rouse. It appeared very astonishing to us, that he had
not attempted to convey to us even the scanty information which
Pr&eacute;audet and Magon L&eacute;pinay had collected from
himself and his officers at Batavia. Our amazement was still
greater, when we understood that Commodore Hunter had not only
not suffered any thing to transpire during his stay at the Cape,
which could give ground to believe that he had seen savages
dressed in the uniforms of the French marines, but that he had
even expressly declared to several of the members of the regency,
and in particular to his friend Mr. Gordon, that he knew nothing
of the facts reported upon the arrival of the Atalante; neither
was there any reason to suspect that the reports left at the
Cape, by Captain Bolle, came from Commodore Hunter himself.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh, Commander of the English sloop Providence,
which had been fitted out for the purpose of searching for the
bread-fruit tree in the Society Islands, had cast anchor in
Table-bay shortly after the Atalante had sailed from thence. It
appeared that Captain Bligh had heard nothing from Commodore
Hunter relative to the depositions of the two French captains;
but, that upon the information communicated to him by persons who
had spoken with the captain of the Atalante, he had assured
Colonel Gordon, that when he returned to the Society Islands, he
would make what enquiries he was able in those parts where La
P&eacute;rouse was reported to have been cast away, and endeavour
to save some of the remains of that unfortunate expedition.</p>
<p>This was the second expedition which Captain. Bligh had
undertaken in quest of the bread-fruit tree. In the course of the
first voyage which he made for the purpose of procuring this
valuable tree to the West Indian settlements of the English, he
had been set on shore in consequence of a mutiny amongst the
crew, of which he published an account after his return to
England.</p>
<p>We learnt that the Pandora English frigate, commanded by
Captain Edwards, had since been at the Society Islands, where
they had seized fourteen of the mutineers. Four of them
afterwards made their escape when the vessel was run aground off
Norfolk Island. The ringleader of the mutineers, Christian, who
had been master of the vessel under the command of Captain Bligh,
had escaped with nine others to another island, and carried
several of the natives with him. One of the officers of the
Pandora lately arrived at the Cape, assured us that Bligh had
behaved very ill to Christian, and that an abuse of authority on
the side of the captain was the cause of all his subsequent
misfortunes. Christian, though master of the vessel, had been
maltreated, according to Captain Bligh's orders, as is he had
been a common sailor of the lowest rank. If this be the fact,
Captain Bligh disguises the truth when he asserts, that he had
always treated him with the greatest liberality.</p>
<p>There were at that time eighteen ships lying at anchor at the
Cape, of which twelve were Dutch, two French, two American, and
two English.</p>
<p>At sun-rise we saluted the place with thirteen guns, which it
returned with the same number.</p>
<p>18th. At nine o'clock the Commander of our expedition went on
shore; upon which the town saluted him with fifteen guns, which
we returned gun for gun. The Governor had sent several carriages,
and a large company of musicians attend General Dentrecasteaux at
the place where he landed. Accompanied by the musicians, playing
upon their instruments in a very boisterous manner, he went with
some of his officers to wait upon the members of the regency, who
received him in a full assembly of the council, and soon after
returned his visit, at the house of the Charg&eacute; d'Affaires
of France, where he lodged.</p>
<p>The greater part of our officers took lodgings in different
houses of the town. The Dutch inhabitants at the Cape are known
to be very fond of lodging strangers at their houses. Their
common price is a piastre a day. I took a lodging, together with
some of my travelling companions, at the house of a M. de
Lettre.</p>
<p>19th. The summit of the Table Mountain was hid in thick
clouds, which at this season of the year is a certain prognostic
of high winds from the south-east, that generally continue for
two or three days. The gales were this time so violent, that
during the whole time they prevailed no vessel of the size of a
sloop dare venture to approach the shore.</p>
<p>Though the clouds appeared immovably attached to the top of
the mountain, even when the winds blew with their greatest
violence, they were, in fat, perpetually replaced by others; but
the force with which they were driven along, after their
separation from the mountain, diminishing their cohesion, they
were soon dissipated in the atmosphere. We often observed large
masses of these clouds, which as soon as they were detached from
the summit, immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>These violent gales from the south-east, which have often been
noticed by travellers, appeared to me to proceed from the nature
of the coast, which forms a very high ridge from the Cape Town as
far as to the mouth of False Bay, and as as a barrier, preventing
the south-east winds from passing beyond it. Whenever these winds
get into False Bay, it can only happen in consequence of their
having surmounted this obstacle which opposes them at the
southern extremity of Africa. The dilatation of the lower column
of air is so much impeded by the compression which it suffers, in
its ascent towards the summit of this ridge, from the weight of
the superincumbent column, that, whenever it has passed these
heights, the reaction of its elasticity is proportionate to the
diminution of the resistance before opposed to its expansion. Its
impetuosity is then such as frequently to loosen ships lying in
the road from their anchors, and set them adrift.</p>
<p>The violence of these winds is the greatest where they descend
along the declivity of these mountains; in the interior of the
country situated at a small distance to the eastward, on the
contrary, they are very moderate; as I have had occasion to
remark in several excursions which I made from the town.</p>
<p>The clouds, with which the summit of the ridge is at such
times covered, are naturally produced from the enormous mass of
air, which, after becoming surcharged with moisture during its
passage over a vast extent of ocean, when it ascends into the
higher regions of the atmosphere, deposits, in the form of
clouds, the superabundant water which, on account of the change
of temperature, it can no longer retain in a state of
solution.</p>
<p>In the course of the night, the long boat of the Esperance was
torn by the gale from her stern, and lost. To supply its place, a
sort of light vessel used in the whale-fishery, was purchased of
an American ship.</p>
<p>20th. Though the south-east wind continued to blow with great
violence, I made an excursion in the neighbourhood of the town,
where I found in great abundance, two species of the
<i>chironia</i>, termed <i>C. trinervia</i> and <i>C.
dendroides</i>. The <i>gorteria ciliaris</i> likewise grew at the
foot of the mountains. The beautiful shrub, known by the name of
<i>brun&eacute;a palacea</i>, adorned the rising grounds. No
insects, of course, could be seen whilst the winds blew with such
violence.</p>
<p>I took a view of the Company's garden, of which many
travellers speak in terms of enthusiastic admiration. It is,
nevertheless, nothing more than an immense inclosure, which
contains some very fine oaks. Several square plots of ground
hedged round with myrtles, are planted with kitchen-vegetables;
but very few curious plants are to be seen there. They also
contain several of the orchard-trees of Europe. I observed some
bananas, the leaves of which had been torn into slender strips by
the wind.</p>
<p>The <i>falco serpentarius</i> of Linn&aelig;us I saw very tame
in a house belonging to the Governor.</p>
<p>The menagery situated, at the extremity of this garden,
contained but a very small number of uncommon animals, the chief
of which were the ostrich, the zebra, the porcupine, the jackal,
and several birds; amongst others, the bald-headed curlieu of
Buffon, (<i>tentalus calvus</i>, Linn.)</p>
<p>The gales were less violent in the evening, and gave us hopes
of fine weather.</p>
<p>A vessel employed in the slave-trade lay at anchor in the
road. It had lately arrived from Mozambique, and its cargo of
four hundred negroes were, for the present, on shore. It was a
most melancholy spectacle, to behold these miserable wretches,
the greater part of whom were already afflicted with the scurvy,
after a very short passage, crowded into three narrow rooms, from
whence they were shortly to be carried on board, doomed to waste
their lives in supporting the luxury of some wealthy American.
The ship had been trading with countries where dogs are in great
request; and these dealers in human lives did not scruple to avow
that they often purchased two or three blacks for one handsome
dog.</p>
<p>On the 22d, I spent the day in examining the Lion's Mountain.
The soil of this mountain, which derives its name from the
appearance which it presents when seen at a distance by sea, is
very unfavourable to vegetation. It is almost every where
covered, even as far as the sea-side, with hard steatites of a
greyish colour, and so barren that I carried home with me but
very few specimens of plants. On the following day I visited the
Devil's Mountain. It well deserves its appellation, on account of
the violence of the southeast winds, which is much greater at the
declivity of this mountain, than in any other part of the
country. The delightful vale, which separates this mountain from
the Lion's Mountain, is adorned with the beautiful species of the
<i>protea</i>, named by Linn. <i>protea argentea</i>, the tufted
tops of which resist the violent blasts of wind from the
surrounding mountains. The leaves of this tree are covered with a
sort of down, which grows the thickest on the parts most exposed
to the wind. This circumstance may here be remarked in most of
the plants liable to be beaten by the winds, which renders it
probable, that their down serves them as a defence from the
injury they might otherwise receive from them.</p>
<p>The fertility of this valley afforded a remarkable contrast
with the barrenness of the Lion's Mountain. The vegetable kingdom
appeared here in its highest luxuriance. Where the grounds rose
with an easy ascent, they were bespangled with the tulip of the
Cape of Good Hope <i>h&aelig;manthus coccinea</i>, Linn.); a
variety of different kinds of shrubs projected from the cleft
between the rocks, and at their bases grew the beautiful
<i>st&oelig;be gnaphaloides</i>, amongst an abundance of other
plants.</p>
<p>24th. As the preparation of the plants, which I had collected
on the preceding day, occupied a great portion of my time, I had
not leisure to undertake any long excursion. I therefore confined
myself to short walks in the neighbourhood of the town.</p>
<p>The false alo&euml;, termed by botanists <i>agave
vivipara</i>, was then in full flower. I admired the lightness
with which the black titmouse (<i>parus ater</i>, Linn.) hovered
about this plant, whilst it fed upon the saccharine liquor which
exudes from the bases of its <i>coroll&aelig;</i>. It was with
regret that I killed some of these beautiful little birds, in
order to carry off their spoils.</p>
<p>Three of us, who were walking together, followed a narrow path
till within a small distance of the country-house of the Fiscal;
his name was Deness. This man, habituated to despotic authority
over his inferiors, wanted to hinder us from walking over some
uncultivated grounds, which, as he told us with great emphasis,
were his property. We were not a little astonished at this
prohibition, uttered in so dictatorial a tone; for the Fiscal
seemed fully persuaded that we durst not be so rash as to proceed
any farther. We, however, after having represented to him that we
could not possibly do any harm to his uncultivated stony grounds,
pursued our route. The petty Vizier fell into a violent rage at
seeing how little we minded his orders, and not being able to
answer our remonstrances, he told us in very bad French, that
such were his commands, and it required no further
explanation.</p>
<p>Two negroes, who had accompanied us from the town, trembled at
the sound of the Fiscal's voice, and it was with difficulty that
we could persuade them to remain with us; for they told us,
whilst they shuddered with horror, that this Monsieur Deness was
the person who presided at the whippings that were administered
according to the orders of the officers of police.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable circumstance that the Fiscal is here
invested with the charge of inspection over all the servants of
the Company, and holds his office independently of any other
person. It seems still more strange that so important a trust
should be committed to the hands of an officer of police, who is
thus enabled to practise all the extortions for which, his office
affords him such ample opportunities; for he it is who both fixes
the amount of fines, and collects their produce. In consequence
of this regulation, pecuniary punishments are the only ones
inflicted upon those who are able to pay; the rest he always
orders to be whipped.</p>
<p>25th. I employed this day in taking a view of the Table
Mountain, which derives its appellation from the horizontal plain
which its summit presents when seen at a distance.</p>
<p>I had frequently to cross a brook that flows down this
mountain. The large stones, rounded by friction, that are found
on its shore, thew that in the rainy season the water descends in
torrents.</p>
<p>About half way up the mountain I found the <i>thesium
strictum</i>. A little higher up I met with the magnificent
umbelliferous plant, called by botanists <i>hermas
depauperata</i>, the beautiful fern, <i>acrostichum
pectinatum</i>; the <i>bubon galbanum</i>, the <i>restio
simplex</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>That portion of the mountain which I had hitherto ascended,
was composed of greyish free-stone, very hard, and covered with
masses of a fine white-coloured quartz, which served as a basis
to several very close strata of micaceous schistus.</p>
<p>Having ascended upwards of 350 toises perpendicular height, I
arrived at a fissure in the side of the mountain, which, when
seen from the town, does not appear to afford a passage to the
summit; but I found the distant view had deceived me, for I
discovered a path in it of no very difficult access to persons
used to climbing mountains, being the track mostly frequented in
order to arrive at the top, which is hardly to be surmounted by
any other.</p>
<p>Though the part of the mountain where we now stood is about
500 toises perpendicular height, the heat of the atmosphere
raised the thermometer to twenty degrees in the shade.</p>
<p>Fuel is very scarce at the Cape of Good Hope; but though the
mildness of the climate exempts the inhabitants from the
necessity of employing artificial heat as a defence against the
severity of the weather, they want it, however, for the purposes
of cookery, and send their slaves even far beyond the Table
Mountain, to fetch the small supply of wood which they require.
We met several blacks carrying to the town their bundles of fuel,
which consisted of the branches of different sorts of shrubs;
amongst others I distinguished <i>cunonia capensis</i>, and
several beautiful species of the <i>protea</i>. I was much
gratified at having an opportunity to see these fine plants, and
regretted only that they had been gathered for no other purpose
than to serve as fuel. I picked out some specimens for myself,
and the blacks, whole burthens were not become much lighter for
what I had taken away, proceeded on their journey to the town. It
gave us pain to observe that these miserable beings were obliged
to march forward, without ever halting; though the steep descent
of the mountain must have been extremely fatiguing.</p>
<p>The mountains in the neighbourhood of the town serve as a
place of refuge for slaves, whom the barbarous treatment they
endure compels to attempt their escape. Driven by hunger they
then frequently approach, under cover of the night, to
habitations, in order to procure by theft their scanty means of
subsistence. That they prefer such a miserable state of existence
to remaining with their matters, proves how inhuman the treatment
must be to which they are exposed. It must be very dangerous to
trust one's self, alone and unarmed, amongst the clefts of the
rocks, where these wretches, driven by despair, shut themselves
from the sight of the sun, in order to escape from slavery.</p>
<p>Some drops of water, that ooze at this height from fissures
between the beds of micaceous schistus, afford the traveller
means of quenching his thirst.</p>
<p>The high borders of the cleft, through which we were
ascending, were ornamented with various beautiful species of
lilacs; we observed particularly the <i>antholiza ethiopica</i>,
remarkable for the brilliant appearance of its scarlet
blossoms.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the summit of the mountain, we were
beginning to regale ourselves upon the provisions which we had
brought with us, when we observed some of the company of the
Esperance coming towards us, who had undertaken the same tour
without providing themselves with any refreshments for their
journey; and we were heartily willing to let them share in our
frugal repast.</p>
<p>The rain discharged by the clouds which had been detained over
the summit of the Table Mountain during several of the preceding
days, had formed pools in the clefts of the rock, between which I
found a great variety of curious plants.</p>
<p>The summit of the mountain presents a view of False Bay in its
whole extent, and I carefully followed it with my eye in all its
windings. We descended by the same track that we had ascended. It
was already dark when I arrived in the town, loaded with an
abundant collection of plants.</p>
<p>26th. As soon as I had made the preparations requisite for
preserving the specimens which I had collected, I directed my
observations to the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>Beyond the farther end of the bay there is a vast plain of
sand, on which one is surprised to see a prodigious number of
plants vegetating. The most frequent are various species of the
<i>diosma, polygala</i>, and <i>borbonia</i>. These plants,
however, would not be able to support themselves in so barren a
soil, if they did not shoot their roots to a great depth into the
ground, so as there to imbibe the moisture necessary for their
vegetation.</p>
<p>I had to cross several brooks, which take their rife from the
neighbouring mountains, and some of which are lost in the sands
before they discharge themselves into the sea. In these moist
situations I found the beautiful shrub, <i>genthyllis
spiralis</i>.</p>
<p>The fissures in the sand serve as places of shelter for the
snakes, which one frequently finds sleeping upon their borders;
but as soon as one approaches them they immediately fly to their
lurking-places for refuge.</p>
<p>27th. I resolved to make a second visit to the Table Mountain.
I went a little off from the common path, and enriched my
collection with several plants which I had not seen before.
Indeed it required a considerable length of time to exhaust all
the botanical stores of a country which produces such an
abundance of vegetables.</p>
<p>A thick fog suddenly spread itself over the part of the
mountain where I stood, and obliged me immediately to descend. I
should certainly have lost my way, had I not happened to be quite
near to the path that leads to the foot of the mountain. Although
there blew but little wind at that time upon the Table Mountain,
the clouds, after passing over its summit, precipitated
themselves in the form of mists, in the same manner as when they
are impelled by the south-east gales.</p>
<p>28th. I enriched my collection with a number of plants which I
gathered in the vicinity of the town.</p>
<p>I had hitherto observed but very few insects, as they do not
generally frequent places so much exposed to currents of the
air.</p>
<p>On the 29th, I made an excursion on the opposite side of the
Table Mountain, following the course of the valley which divides
it from the Lion's Mountain.</p>
<p>The <i>cyanlella capensis</i> grew quite close to the edge of
the sea.</p>
<p>Having reached the heights, I had the pleasure to see the
sides of the rocks ornamented with different species of shrubs,
amongst which the <i>erica halicacaba</i> particularly
distinguished itself, by the oval form, and beautiful tints of
its flowers.</p>
<p>The <i>disa grandiflora</i>, one of the most beautiful plants
of the class of <i>orchis</i>, grew upon the side of the small
streams that wind themselves among these mountains.</p>
<p>This excursion proved the more gratifying to me, as I made it
in the company of M. Masson, who had acquired a very extensive
acquaintance with botany, in the course of his travels.</p>
<p>The following days were employed by me in, making new
researches in the places I had already visited. Vegetation is
here so varied, that I continually met with new objects of
attention.</p>
<p>An English frigate, from Tellicherry, had been lying for five
days at anchor at the Cape, on its return to England to give an
account of an engagement that had taken place between the French
frigate La Resolue, of twelve guns, Captain Calaman, and the
English frigate Phenix, of eighteen. The English frigate had
attempted to make prizes of some vessels under the convoy of La
Resolue.</p>
<p>The English, according to their usual custom, attempted to
spread reports injurious to the character of Captain Calaman,
who, according to the accounts we received from Isle de France,
had conducted himself with equal courage and generosity. The
English Commander would have done well to have contradicted these
reports, by giving a just statement of the facts; but it seemed
it was his interest to disguise them; for it is an unheard-of
thing for that nation to make an attempt upon vessels escorted by
a ship carrying the flag of ours.</p>
<p>Another English vessel, La Couronne, which arrived the day
after the frigate had come to anchor, observed the same
conduct.</p>
<p>I ought to remark, that our Commander having sent an officer
on board each of these vessels, to comply with a customary piece
of etiquette, the English Captains were not polite enough to
return the compliment.</p>
<p>I had already provided myself with specimens of most of the
curious plants that were to be found in the neighbourhood of the
Cape Town; and could not expect to encrease my collection,
without making an excursion into some of the more distant parts
of the country. I had for several days entertained a with to
visit the chain of mountains, called by the Dutch Fransche-Hoek,
situated at a much greater distance eastward of the town than
their appearance might lead one to suppose them. Their aspect
gave me reason to hope that I should find them abounding with
vegetable productions.</p>
<p>FEBRUARY 9. The gardener to our expedition made one of the
party. We had hired a Hottentot to lead the horse that carried
our baggage; and a young negro, who hardly knew three words of
the French language, served as our interpreter.</p>
<p>As a passport was necessary, M. Berg, one of the most amiable
and intelligent men of the Company, provided us with one.</p>
<p>Colonel Gordon, Commander of the troops at the Cape, had
furnished me with letters of recommendation to several of the
colonists.</p>
<p>This gentleman is the celebrated traveller, who communicated
to Buffon the first authentic accounts he received concerning the
giraffe, an animal till then very little known. Colonel Gordon
had penetrated as far as 21&deg; S. lat. into the interior parts
of Africa, with a view to making discoveries in natural history.
He has often assured me, that at this distance, more than twelve
degrees north of the Cape, his barometrical observations shewed
him, that the surface of this country was more than a hundred
toises above the level of the sea; though, in traversing it, he
had not been sensible of any rising of the ground, but had
thought be travelled over a plain that was very little elevated.
There observations, which he repeated at different times, after
intervals of several days, seem to demonstrate that the surface
of this country rises, in a gradual ascent, to a height equal to
that of the most elevated mountains in the other parts of the
globe.</p>
<p>I leave it to natural philosophers to determine, whether or
not the sinking of the mercury in the barometer proceeded from
another cause than that which produces the same effect, when this
instrument is carried upon high mountains.</p>
<p>We met a number of chariots drawn by three or four pairs of
oxen. They were returning empty to the town, each of them
conducted by a Hottentot, who stood erect in the carriage, and
directed his team with wonderful dexterity, by means of a long
whip, which he held in his hand. Though the foremost pair of oxen
were at a great distance from him, he never missed any one of
them that wanted the lash.</p>
<p>Our Hottentot marched on with his pipe in his mouth, and
regaling himself from time to time with the Hottentot's fig
(<i>mesembrianthemum edule</i>), which grew among the lands on
the road side, without seeming to think of the horse entrusted to
his care; so that our baggage fell off several times, and would
have been left on the road, if we had not apprised our smoker of
it, who was walking on without taking any notice of the accident.
We found it necessary to use threats in order to rouse him from
his lethargy, and render him more attentive to his charge.</p>
<p>Several species of the <i>geranium, polygala, lobelia,
&amp;c</i>. grew upon the sandy plain through which we
travelled.</p>
<p>Having arrived at some sandy grounds, we saw several gazelles,
but they kept at so great a distance from us that we were not
able to shoot any of them.</p>
<p>Two hours after dark, we arrived at the house of M. Bosman, at
Bottelary. The letter of recommendation, which Mr. Gordon had
given us, procured us a very friendly reception from this worthy
planter, whom we found sitting at supper in the midst of his
numerous family. He immediately invited us to sit down with him,
and set before us some very agreeable strong-bodied wine, made
from the grapes that grow about Bottelary. Some merchants of the
town sell this wine at a very high price, as Constantia wine, to
which however it is inferior in quality; and M. Bosman told us
that it may be bought twelve times cheaper than the other.</p>
<p>M. Bosman, in his insulated situation upon a small spot of
fertile ground, surrounded by a large desart of sand, was, of
course, very desirous of hearing our news; but we found it very
difficult to communicate any to him, as our negro interpreter
appeared now much less fit for his office, than we had before
conceived him to be. After having having spent a great deal of
time with saying very little, we went to take our repose, of
which we stood in great need. We all envied the peaceable life
which this respectable planter leads, in the midst of a family
where the greatest simplicity of manners is united with the most
engaging politeness.</p>
<p>10th. As soon as it was day, we went to take a view of the
grounds about this delightful habitation. We found in M. Bosman's
garden most of the kitchen-plants and fruits of Europe; fine
plantations of almond-trees rose before the front of the house,
which was surrounded on all sides with vineyards that constitute
the chief wealth of the owner.</p>
<p>Soon after sun-rise, M. Bosman's youngest daughters, seeing
that we were collecting insects, came to offer us their
assistance. They hunted them through the garden with incredible
swiftness; and soon brought us a fine collection of such as they
thought the prettiest.</p>
<p>As we were shortly to sail from the Cape, we had not much time
left us for our expedition to Fransche Hoek. We therefore took
leave of this amiable family, with the most sensible regret, and
proceeded on our journey.</p>
<p>We arrived in good time at Stellenbosch, where we stopped at
the house of M. Hoffman.</p>
<p>The manner in which we were received at Stellenbosch afforded
a striking contrast with the frankness and cordiality of our
reception at Bottelary. This was a very pleasant village; but we
found that we were not to expect every where that agreeable
frankness of manners, which characterises the planters of the
Cape. We had imagined that a letter of recommendation from
Colonel Gordon, addressed to M. Hoffman, would be sufficient to
introduce us: but it was not till after he had carefully examined
our passport, that he invited us to remain at his house. There
are no public inns at Stellenbosch, no more than at the Cape
Town; but the Dutch inhabitants of the town accommodate strangers
at a settled price, which indemnifies the landlord. We were
lodged at M. Hoffman's very nearly upon the same footing as at
the Cape.</p>
<p>On the following day I visited the hills in the neighbourhood
of Stellenbosch.</p>
<p>The beautiful tree called <i>brabeium stellulifolium</i>,
remarkable for its fruit, which resembles in shape that of the
almond-tree, grew here upon the banks of a rivulet that runs
through the village.</p>
<p>I enriched my collection with several kinds of <i>orchis</i>,
and with the species of the <i>protea</i>, called <i>mellifera,
pallens</i> and <i>speciosa</i>; besides a number of other
plants.</p>
<p>On the 12th we proceeded on our way, intending to arrive
towards evening at Fransche Hoek.</p>
<p>This place, which, as is implied by its name, is partly
inhabited by French, served as an asylum for the protestant
families, which in consequence of the persecutions they suffered
on account of their religious opinions, crossed the ocean, in the
year 1675, with a view of establishing themselves in this part of
Africa, where they were well received by the Governor, Simon
Vander Stel, and provided with every requisite for following the
employments of husbandry.</p>
<p>The wind from the south-east blew with force sufficient to
incommode us on our march. It was, however, by no means so
violent here, as we learnt upon our arrival that it had been at
the Cape. The great difference in the force of these gales
depends, undoubtedly, upon local causes, as I have endeavoured to
few upon a former occasion.</p>
<p>It was on this day that the pinnace of the Esperance,
commanded by Citizen Legrand, not being able to reach the ship,
was obliged to run for shelter off the island of Robben.</p>
<p>We had to walk two hours after it was dark, before we arrived
at Fransche Hoek, where we presented ourselves at the house of
Gabriel Deprat, to whom I had a letter of recommendation. As he
was absent, Jacob de Villiers, one of his neighbours, invited us
to remain at his house, where we met with a very friendly
reception.</p>
<p>The names of these planters led us to hope that we were now
amongst people with whom we could convene in our own language;
but these Frenchmen by extraction, having been obliged to make
use of the Dutch for so long a space of time, retained nothing of
their mother-tongue besides their family names.</p>
<p>It will not be uninteresting to the reader to know the names
of those French families that still survived in the midst of
these mountains. They were the following;</p>
<p>Lombart, Faure, Rotif, Blignant, Duplessis, Mar&eacute;e,
Pont&eacute;, Naud&eacute;, Cronier, Hugo, de Villiers, Marais,
du Buisson, le Roux, Deprat, Rousseaux, Villiers, Terrons,
Hubert.</p>
<p>We were here in a pleasant valley, where the rays of the sun,
reflected from the surrounding mountains, soon ripen the grape,
which is the chief source of wealth to the inhabitants. A good
deal of cheese is also made here.</p>
<p>We employed the two following days in climbing up the
mountains in this neighbourhood. I here collected specimens of
the <i>protea florida</i> and <i>ferraria</i>, amongst a great
variety of other plants.</p>
<p>These mountains are composed chiefly of granite, and a very
hard sort of free-stone. The mould produced by the decay of the
vegetables grow upon them, is the cause of the fertility of the
vallies where the colonists reside. Hence they are obliged to
travel over sandy desarts in order to carry the produce of their
labour to the town. This kind of situation is common to all the
establishments at any considerable distance from the Cape. The
cultivators are necessitated to go more than 500,000 toises into
the interior of Africa, in order to seek out some spots of arable
land, scattered like islands in an ocean of sand; and after they
have found them, every one applies to the ground he has cleared
whatever mode of cultivation he thinks most adapted to the soil.
The black slaves, though obliged to labour very hard, are in
general treated with humanity. It is remarkable that, contrary to
the practice of the Spaniards, who always endeavour to make
proselytes of their slaves, the Dutch planters leave theirs in
the most profound ignorance of their religion.</p>
<p>We frequently saw the snakes, which are much dreaded by the
inhabitants of the country, lying in wait under the trees for the
birds which often become their prey.</p>
<p>The zebras are very common in these mountains: they run away
with prodigious swiftness upon the approach of a man.</p>
<p>The ape termed <i>magot</i> by Buffon (<i>simia innuus</i>
Linn.), sometimes came very near to the house where we lodged. I
once witnessed a singular fact, which shews what authority these
animals possess over their young. A large ape that was followed
by a very little one, thinking himself unobserved, took it up in
one of his paws and beat it for a considerable space of time with
the other. If the apes knew how to proportion the punishment to
the offence, the cub must have been very naughty; for he got a
most severe beating.</p>
<p>The olive-coloured thrush, and the starling the Cape of Good
Hope, with some wood-peckers, &amp;c. were the birds I most
frequently saw during this excursion.</p>
<p>As our departure from the Cape was fixed to take place very
foot, we were obliged to leave Fransche Hoek much sooner than we
could have wished. We were in such haste to return to the town,
that we bade adieu to our worthy host Jacob de Villiers, at ten
o'clock in the evening, and immediately set out on our journey.
We marched the whole night through, and at length arrived at the
same hour of the following evening in the town, having travelled
by way of the Paarl-Berg and Paarde-Berg. Such a forced march
could not fail to prove extremely fatiguing to us, who had for
several days past enjoyed but a very few hours sleep. One of the
servants belonging to the Esperance, Emard Serpoy, who had wished
to accompany us, as he was passionately fond of shooting, was so
overtaken with drowsiness about midnight, that we were obliged to
let him sleep for half an hour upon the road, before he was able
to proceed any farther with us.</p>
<p>I was sorry to learn, at my return from Fransche Hoek, that we
were to lose three of our travelling companions, namely, the
astronomer Bertrand, the naturalist Blavier, and the painter Ely,
who had requested the Commander to leave them on shore, as their
health did not allow them to accompany us farther on our
expedition. Bertrand having ascended the Table mountain a few
days before, in order to make some barometrical observations, had
fallen in such a manner as to be very severely hurt. I was
informed at my return to France, that he was not so fortunate as
to see his country once more, having died at the Cape, a short
time after our departure.</p>
<p>As all the houses in the Cape Town are built with flat roofs,
it presents a very agreeable view. The fortifications on the side
facing the sea had been rendered stronger, a few years ago, by
additional ramparts.</p>
<p>The Commander persuaded me, as the vessels were already so
much lumbered, to leave the collections of natural history, which
I had made during our stay at the Cape, in the hands of Gui,
agent of the French government. This person promised to send them
to France by the first opportunity. They, however, never arrived
there, and I was informed at the Isle de France, upon my return
from the South Sea, that they had been seen by the naturalists
Mac&eacute; and Aubert Petit Thouars, deposited in a granary
belonging to this agent, long after our departure from the Cape;
though he had had plenty of opportunities to send them to France,
if his design had been to fulfil his engagement.</p>
<p>Few spots of the globe so well deserve the attention of a
commercial nation, as the Cape of Good Hope. Its situation has
rendered it as an anchoring station almost indispensably
necessary for ships sailing to the East Indies. It affords
abundance of provisions; but the restrictive regulations daily
diminish the number of ships frequenting this harbour, as they
now endeavour to reach the place of their destination without
touching at the Cape; and some put into the harbour at St.
Helena, where they are able to provision themselves at an easier
rate.</p>
<p>The spirit of speculation that prevails amongst the Dutch
Company, has often induced them to feign a great scarcity of
provisions at the Cape, in order to enhance their price. The
cultivators are not permitted to enter into a direct bargain with
strangers for the produce of their lands; but are obliged to
leave them to be disposed of by the Company, who frequently
purchase them at a price four times less than that which they
themselves receive.</p>
<p>The vexatious interference of the superior agents in the
concerns of their subordinate officers, turns likewise to the
disadvantage of strangers, who find it impossible to escape from
the rapacity of so many persons, all combined against their
interest. This avaricious spirit gradually undermines the
prosperity of this country, as it renders navigators unwilling to
touch at the Cape whenever they can. avoid it. A ruinous
propensity to extravagance, which has for some years past
prevailed amongst the women, has produced a great change in the
manners of the inhabitants, who are now eagerly intent upon
adopting all the fashions of Europe.</p>
<p>All these evils have arisen from the Dutch government having
so grossly mistaken its own interest, as to leave a place of the
last importance to the navigation of India, under the direction
of a company of private merchants. But it is known, that the
political views of this people generally act in subordination to
the desire of gain, which governs them, and is often in
contradiction with their interests as a nation.</p>
<p>It was then expected that commissaries were to be sent from
Europe, in order to put affairs upon abetter footing: but such
commissaries have been sent several times, and the affairs fill
remained in their former condition.</p>
<p>We laid in a sufficient stock of provisions at the Cape to
supply the place of what we had already consumed. It would have
been well if as much of our European stock as was had in its
quality had been changed for better. The contractors had deceived
us in the quality of the wine which we bought of them. We had
paid them double the ordinary price, that we might have it of the
best quality, and such as would keep for a long time. Part of it,
however, was already spoiled before we reached the Cape. When we
arrived there, it was a matter of the utmost importance to have
it changed, and the more so, as we knew we could not do it in the
subsequent part of our voyage. We might there have had our choice
between the wine of the country and Bourdeaux wine, as a vessel
at anchor in the road had a cargo of the latter on board, Why it
was neglected, I am at a loss to comprehend. The consequence was,
that our bad wine grew worse and worse, till we were at length
obliged to substitute brandy in its place. This piece of
negligence deprived us of one of the best means for preserving
the health of the crew during a voyage, in the course of which
they ran the hazard of being in want of every necessary.</p>
<p>The observations taken on board the Recherche, gave us for its
anchoring station at the Cape of Good Hope, 33&deg; 54' 24" S.
lat. 16&deg; 4' 25" E. longitude.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle at the same place was
24&deg; 30' W.</p>
<p>Our astronomer Bertrand found, for the place of his
observatory in the town, 33&deg; 55' 22" 4-5ths S. lat. 16&deg;
3' 45" E. long.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle, as observed by him, was
24&deg; 31' 52" W. The dip of a flat needle gave 47&deg; 25'.</p>
<p>During the whole time we lay at anchor, the mercury in the
thermometer was never higher than 25&deg; above 0.</p>

<br>
<small>16th FEBRUARY [1792].</small></p>
<p>WE waited only for a favourable wind to quit our nation at the
the Cape, when a south-east breeze springing up about ten o'clock
in the forenoon, enabled us to get under way. Scarcely had we
spread our sails, when a sudden squall from the mountains blew
with such violence, that it prevented us for some time from
making use of our rudder, so that we were in danger of running
foul of some of the ships which lay at anchor in the road.
However, we soon run past them, and stood for the offing.</p>
<p>18th. About eight in the morning our master carpenter, Louis
Gargan, died, a victim to the excesses in which he had indulged
during our stay at the Cape. A fever, which appeared slight in
its commencement, grew afterwards so violent as to put an end to
his life. We felt the loss of this man the more sensibly, as the
carpenter of a ship is one of the most useful persons on board,
especially in a voyage undertaken for the purpose of discovery in
the midst of seas full of rocks and shoals, where one is in
perpetual danger of being shipwrecked, and where, if one does not
possess the means of constructing another vessel to receive the
crew, all hopes of revisiting one's native country, must go with
the wreck to the bottom.</p>
<p>Two persons had concealed themselves in the ship before our
departure from the Cape, and did not make their appearance upon
deck till we were so far from the land that it was no more
practicable to put them on shore. They were, of course, permitted
to accompany us. The one was a soldier, deserted from the
garrison at the Cape; the other a German, a very skilful workman
in mathematical instruments, who had practised his trade for nine
years in England. The English, he told us, were going to send him
to Botany Bay, amongst a great number of other convicts. He
assured us, that he had been condemned to be sent thither for
debt. Having seized an opportunity of escaping from the vessel
where he was confined, he fled for refuge to the mountains in the
neighbourhood of the Cape-Town. We had no use for the talents of
this artist in the line of his profession; we therefore first
employed him as our armourer, and afterwards as a smith. The
armourer of our ship had been left on shore at the Cape, on
account of sickness.</p>
<p>On the 20th of February we weathered Needle Point, at the
distance of about 100 toises, with winds from S.W. and W.</p>
<p>On the 22d we were in 35&deg; lat. S. long. 20&deg; E. when
the soundings gave us our depth at 62 fathoms, over a bottom of
grey calcareous sand.</p>
<p>The currents had hitherto set to the N.W. but on the 25th they
drove us towards S.W. as we were now off the channel of
Mozambique, where the current, at this season of the year, takes
a S.W. direction along the coast of Natal, which we had in
sight.</p>
<p>On the 26th the surge ran so high, that a windmill, which we
had fastened very strongly to the poop, was carried away by the
billows. As our vessel was much too heavily laden, we thought
ourselves indemnified for the loss, by getting rid of a burden of
eleven hundred weight. I do not know how it happened that we were
burthened with fuel, an almost useless machine, since wherever we
were able to procure wheat, we could likewise procure flour. At
any rate, a hand-mill six times lighter, would have been less
cumbersome, and would have answered our purpose better.</p>
<p>The rolling of the vessel was so violent, that our
time-keepers struck against the sides of their boxes, which ought
to have been made rather more spacious.</p>
<p>We still saw a great number of flying fish, though we had
already passed the 35&deg; of S. latitude.</p>
<p>The quarter-galleries of both vessels were built much too low,
particularly considering they drew so deep. We had reason to
apprehend that they might be carried away by the surge, if it
should long continue to run so high; those of the lower deck of
the Esperance were already considerably damaged.</p>
<p>29th. At this season of the year, vessels that approach near
to the mouth of the channel of Mozambique, generally meet with
violent storms. The gradual fall of the mercury in the barometer
to the amount of eight lines, whilst the northeast winds blew
from this gulph, gave us a presage of a still more violent
hurricane. The clouds contained such a superabundance of electric
matter, that though our conductors helped to draw off a portion
of it, the lightning frequently struck into the water at the
distance of a few yards from our vessel. A gale from the east,
which brought back fair weather, was preceded by a rise of two
lines in the mercury of the barometer. On the st of March, the
sea was swelled to such a height by this gale, that we often lost
sight of our consort behind the billows. This vessel, seen at the
distance of two or three hundred toises, presented a magnificent
spectacle; sometimes it appeared buried in the waves; again it
emerged, and mounted to the very summit of the surge, shewing a
great part of its keel above the water.</p>
<p>3d. As the swell abated, we knew that we had sailed beyond the
mouth of the channel of Mozambique; for, although the wind
continued to blow with nearly the same violence as on the
preceding days, the sea, being sheltered by the coasts of
Madagascar, became very tranquil. We saw a prodigious quantity of
the <i>fucus pyriformis</i>, the largest species of that genus,
floating upon the surface of the water: they had undoubtedly been
detached from the rocks that bound the coast of that large
island. This fucus, which is several yards in length, is provided
with small bladders filled with air at the extremities of its
highest leaves, whereby it is enabled in its growth to take a
direction towards the surface of the water.</p>
<p>About five o'clock in the evening we were surrounded by a
great number of whales, which came within a hundred yards of our
ship. The Anglo-Americans, who sometimes visit these seas in
order to fish for the whales, are more than indemnified for the
expences of their equipment by the profits from the oil which
they carry home.</p>
<p>The depositions of the Captains Magon L&eacute;pinay and
Pr&eacute;audet, had determined our Commander to endeavour to
reach the Admiralty Islands as soon as possible, thinking that,
after passing along the north coast of New Holland, we should be
able to arrive there before the return of the eastern monsoon. We
had, however, made as yet but very little way, being, on the 6th
of March, only in 44&deg; E. lon. The apprehension of being
detained at the Molucca Islands during the whole time of the east
monsoon, which I was expected to set in during the month of
March, induced him to relinquish his former intention, and
resolve to double the Cape of Van Diemen, in order to get into
the South Seas.</p>
<p>About half an hour after six o'clock in the morning, he sent a
boat to the Esperance to acquaint the Captain with his
determination. The wind fell all of a sudden when the two ships
were very close to each other. A very high surge increased the
danger of our situation; so that the bowsprit of the Esperance
was very hear running foul of our stern, had the vessels not been
kept clear of each other by the boats.</p>
<p>We found that the currents set to the north. The ring by which
the long-boat, that had been sent to take an observation of their
direction, was fastened to the cable, gave way as they were
hoisting it on board, and the compass that they had been using
was destroyed.</p>
<p>Though we were upwards of 1,000,000 toises from the Cape of
Good Hope, we saw several albatrosses (<i>diomedea exulans</i>),
some of which let us come very near them, as they floated upon
the surface of the sea. We frequently observed them thrust their
beaks very deep under the water to seize their prey.</p>
<p>The flight of these birds is very astonishing. One cannot
perceive any motion of their wings except at the moment they
raise themselves into the air; when they frequently use their
feet also, which, being webbed, serve them to make several
strokes against the water, in order to raise themselves; out of
it. This impulsion being once given, they have no more occasion
to strike their wings together, but hold them very widely
expanded, whilst they sail along, balancing their bodies
alternately from right to left, and skimming swiftly over the
surface of the sea in quest of their food. This mode of poising
themselves in the air undoubtedly serves to accelerate their
slight, but one can hardly suppose it to be sufficient for
supporting them above the surface. Perhaps some imperceptible
tremulous motion of their feathers may be the principal cause of
their extraordinary mode of flying. If that be the case, they
must be provided with some particular muscles adapted for the
purpose; on which account I think that the structure of the
albatross deserves to be very attentively investigated by
anatomists.</p>
<p>The <i>puffins</i> of Buffon (<i>procellaria puffinus</i>.),
were very numerous in these seas. The flight of this bird is
performed in a manner analogous to that of the albatross, for he
often skims along for a great length of tithe without any
perceptible motion of his wings; it is only when he changes his
oblique position from one side to the other that one may observe
him strike the air with the lowermost wing, by which his body is
immediately inclined in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>We were steering our course S.E.E. in order to pass between
the islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam; but the wind having
shifted to S.E. we were obliged to tack S.S.W.</p>
<p>7th. About nine o'clock in the evening, as we were in lat.
34&deg; 45' S. and long. 44&deg; 5' E. the wind smelt very strong
of sea-water. Had we been sailing in parts less known than these,
we should have had reason to apprehend that we were very near to
some island. It is probable that the smell proceeded from a
quantity of fucus detached from the south west of Madagascar, and
carried a great way, into the sea by the currents.</p>
<p>One of our sailors, in a fit of drunkenness, threw himself
into the sea. As the weather happened very fortunately to be calm
he was taken up and put on board; but this immersion only
increased his drunkenness, and he would have thrown himself again
into the water if he had not been held fast.</p>
<p>We continued for twelve days with slight breezes that shifted
from S.S.W. to N.N.W. veering round by E. to direct our course,
as near as possible, to as to pass between the islands of
Amsterdam and St. Paul. Though this course was the shortest, with
respect to distance, that we could have taken in order to arrive
at the channel through which we intended to sail, the want of
wind detained us much longer than might have been the case had we
steered in another direction. By sailing more directly southward,
we should soon have met with winds that would have carried us in
a short time to the Cape of Van Diemen.</p>
<p>It was not before the 28th of March, when we were in lat.
37&frac12;&deg; S. that the N.N.W. wind began to blow pretty
fresh. A great slight of gulls and mews showed us that we were
near land; as these birds never fly to any great distance from
the shore. We at length came in sight of it about half after one
in the afternoon. It was the island of St. Paul, which bore S.E.
at the distance of about 20,000 toises. This island was
discovered in 1696 by Captain Vlaming, and called by him the Isle
of Amsterdam, whilst he gave the name of the Isle of St. Paul to
the most Southern of the two, Captain Cook, whom I have herein
followed, reversed these appellations, and gave the name of Isle
of Amsterdam to the southernmost, and that of Isle of St. Paul to
the other.</p>
<p>The Isle of St. Paul presented itself, at a distance, as if
covered with thick clouds, above which the tops of the mountains
were visible. In four hours time we were near enough to perceive
that these clouds arose from the island itself, from whence a
thick smoke ascended, which almost entirely covered it,
especially towards the north. We observed flames in different
places, and soon perceived that the forests were on fire; the
course of the flames and smoke, which appeared successively in
different parts of the country, pointed out to us the progress of
the conflagration. We steered our course so as to pass as near as
possible to windward of the island. The same species of birds
that we had observed a few hours before we espied land were
flying about the rocks where they had their nests. A great number
of seals swam amongst large masses of fucus that had been
detached from the island, along the southern coast of which we
ranged at the distance of about 250 toises from the shore. This
coast is very steep and perfectly safe; the surges, which
followed its direction, would have apprized us of our danger in
approaching it if there had been any shoals. The mountains on the
south-east side of the island descend with very steep declivities
as far as the edges of the sea, and appeared to me to consist of
layers of free-stone, inclined from north to south so as to form
an angle of fifty degrees with the horizon. Farther to the south
I observed horizontal layers of the same kind of stone, from
whence a small rivulet discharged itself, in a cascade, into the
sea. The rocks facing the sea were shaped into a variety of those
grotesque figures, commonly termed <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i>. We
observed a light smoke ascending in puffs from a small
subterraneous cavern at a little distance from the shore; though
we could not learn whether the forests had caught fire from some
conflagration in the bowels of the earth, or had been kindled
intentionally by the inhabitants. I was informed at Isle de
France, upon my return from the South Seas, that an American
vessel had left some men, at the islands of Amsterdam and St.
Paul, for the purpose of collecting oil from the fat of seals,
which are very numerous on those coasts. But though we watched
very attentively to see if any signal was made for our
assistance, we observed no signs of the island's being inhabited.
At any rate it would have been impossible to put in there, as we
could not have found an anchoring place except to leeward of the
island, where we ran the risk of being suffocated by the smoke.
The smell of the smoke seemed to show that it proceeded entirely
from the combustion of vegetables.</p>
<p>The mountains gradually diminish in height the south-east end
of the island; so that, in favourable weather, vessels might
easily put in at that part of the coast. We observed several
rivulets, which, after winding with a serpentine course amongst
the hills, discharged themselves into the sea.</p>
<p>We were still very near to the island when the night came on.
The land then appeared as if covered with a sheet of fire, whilst
the illuminated smoke gave that vivid appearance to the sky which
generally portends a hurricane.</p>
<p>The isle of St. Paul is about 10,000 toises in circumference,
and situated in about 37&deg; 56' S. lat. and 75&deg; 2' E.
lon.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle was here 17&frac12;&deg;
W.</p>
<p>During the continuance of the gales from N.W. and S.W. the
mercury of the barometer gradually fell eight lines. On the first
of April, it was stationary at 27 inches 7 lines, when the gale
was so strong, that we went at the rate of ten knots with the
fore and main top-sails set. We never ran so fart as on this day,
in the whole course of our voyage. We were now already in
40&frac12;&deg; S. lat. Lon. 85&deg; E.</p>
<p>Hitherto we had flattered ourselves that no fraud had been
practised upon us, at least with respect to the quality of our
sea-biscuit. But we discovered, when it was too late, that a part
of it had already made a voyage before; for, at the end of five
months after our departure from Brest, it swarmed with prodigious
numbers of those maggots, that are afterwards changed into the
species of fly known by the name of <i>dermestes paniceus</i>.
Thee insects soon became very troublesome to us; in the
night-time they burnt themselves at our lamps in such numbers, as
very frequently to extinguish them. From the biscuits the maggots
soon spread themselves throughout all the rest of our provisions,
and it lasted a considerable time before we could conquer the
disgust which it at first gave us, when we saw them swarming in
all our food.</p>
<p>2d. The impetuosity and frequency of the squalls obliged us to
make a great many tacks. They once forgot to shiver the main
top-sail before they brailed it up, and it was instantly torn in
pieces.</p>
<p>On the 4th of April, being in 41&deg; S. lat. 92&deg; E. lon.
we saw a great number of birds; amongst others, gulls and the
<i>larus marinus</i>, which seldom fly far from the land.
Probably we were near to some rock or island. Though we had made
a very good run, we fill saw the same kinds of birds on the
following day. The land where they have their abode may possibly
be discovered, when these seas shall be more frequented by
navigators.</p>
<p>14th. A fall of the mercury in the barometer from 28 inches 3
lines, to 27 inches 7 lines, announced the approach of violent
gales, which blew from W. and S.W. and raised the billows so high
that they frequently dallied over our decks. One of them, that
had entangled our mizen chains, broke against the stern of the
veal with such force, that the sailors thought we had struck upon
a rock. The shock was tremendous, and some of the store-rooms
instantly leaked.</p>
<p>The violence of the shock had thrown the Commander against one
of the corners of a barrel-organ, intended as a present to same
savage chief. The surgeon thought at first that he had fractured
one of his false ribs; and the pain was so great, that, whenever
he sneezed, it threw him into a fainting fit. However, he soon
recovered his health.</p>
<p>During the night the atmosphere was filled with a
superabundance of electric matter; a part was drawn off by means
of our conductors, upon the top of which we observed a luminous
speck, that vanished and re-appeared several times in succession.
The sea appeared more phosphoric than usual.</p>
<p>In the course of the night a large wave dashed over the deck
of our vessel, having made its way through the opening between
the fore-castle and quarter-deck, where we kept our boats. When I
sprang out of my bed, I found the cabin filled with water, and
imagined we were going to the bottom. It kept us a long time
employed before we could rid the ship of the water it had taken
in. Three or four such waves would infallibly have sunk us. We
should not have ran such a hazard, if we had been provided with
means to lay gratings over the large opening by which the wave
entered.</p>
<p>On the 17th of April, when we were in lat. 43&deg; S. long.
129&deg; E. the variation of the magnetic needle was 0.</p>
<p>The Esperance was apprised, that in case of separation, our
rendezvous at Van Diemen's Cape was to be the Bay of Adventure,
instead of the Baie des Huitres. [Oyster Cove.]</p>
<p>We lay to under our fore-sail during the night of the 20th, as
our day's work had brought us so near the coast, that we could
not carry full sail. At nine in the evening, we sounded, without
striking ground, with a line of seventy-five fathoms. We brought
up with the lead a great quantity of phosphoric substances, from
about three to seven inches in circumference. As the
compressibility of water has been demonstrated, we know the
principal cause of these substances being suspended at different
depths below the surface of the water, in proportion to their
specific gravity.</p>
<p>21st. As soon as it was day we directed our course, with full
sails, E.N.E.</p>
<p>About half an hour after nine o'clock, we observed a rock with
a very sharp point, known by the name of the Mewstone. Some other
rocks and mountains of moderate height appeared to the eastward.
The coast was indented with seven small bights in the land; some
pretty high mountains were seen at a small distance from the
shore, and we could distinguish the large trees which covered
their summits.</p>
<p>We soon bore in with a bay open to the southeast. An island
was visible to the eastward, and nearer us we perceived breakers
to N.E.</p>
<p>It was the Commander's intention to cast anchor in
Adventure-bay. As his wound did not yet permit him to leave his
cabin, he was obliged to give his orders respecting our route,
according to observations which were reported to him as they were
taken. An erroneous observation, taken by Citizen Willaumez,*
having been reported to him, he gave orders to man&oelig;uvre the
ships, so as to enter the bay situated on our left. In vain we
looked for the Pinguin's Hand, thinking ourselves in
Adventure-bay, though it really was Tempest-bay, named thus by
Tasman, who, having entered it in the month of November 1642, was
in the most imminent danger of being driven ashore by a S.E.
wind, when he endeavoured to get into the main sea.</p>
<p class="foot">[* When we made the land of the Cape of Van
Diemen, Willaumez was directed to take the necessary
observations. On being asked the bearing of Eddystone, he said it
bore S. 19&deg; W. though it actually bore S. 19&deg;. E.
Accordingly the Commander gave orders to make the bay on our
left, as he could not doubt that it was Adventure-bay.]</p>
<p>As we had got very far into the bight of the bay, our
soundings gave us a depth of from fifteen to twenty-five fathoms,
over a bottom of shells. The Commander was on the point of giving
orders to leave the bay, that we might pals the night in the open
sea; however, he resolved to dispatch two boats, the one to the
northward and the other to the south-east, in order to look out
for some place of shelter for our ships.</p>
<p>The men in the boat sent to the north side of the bay, found a
place of anchorage, with a very good bottom, where we might
easily procure wood and water. They had seen some remains of
huts, and near them large heaps of shells, that appeared to have
been broiled by the natives.</p>
<p>It was, however, too late for us to put into this anchorage
before night. As the weather was fair, it was resolved to cast
anchor in Tempest-bay, in a bottom of grey sand, at the depth of
ten fathoms. We had been sixty-four days on our passage from the
Cape to this place. Most of the navigators who have made it
before us, have performed it in fifty or at most fifty-five days.
It is to be observed, that they have generally steered southward
as soon as possible, in order to get into the track of the
westerly winds. This route is somewhat longer than that which we
took, but at sea it is not always by taking the shortest road
that one arrives the soonest at one's place of destination.
Navigators ought to be well acquainted with the ordinary courses
of the winds, that they may be able to get into those which are
the most favourable. The night continued very fine, though the
air was charged with a great deal of moisture. We were sheltered
from the N.W. and W.N.W. winds, though we now and then
experienced a few slight blasts.</p>
<p>We caught a great quantity of fishes with our lines. They were
of a great variety of different kinds; the most numerous were
those of the species <i>gadus</i>.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle, observed when we paired
under the meridian of Isle de France, at the distance of more
than 700,000 toises south, had been greater by twelve degrees
than we found it near the coast of that island&mdash;a great
difference when considered as arising merely from change of
latitude.</p>
<p>The greatest W. variation observed, was on the 3d of March. It
was then 30&frac12;&deg;, our lat. being 34&deg; 30'S. and long.
37&deg; 45' E. From that time it continued to decrease, till it
became 0, in lat. 43&deg; S. long. 129&deg; E.; after which it
passed to E. and continued to increase in proportion as we
advanced eastward.</p>
<p>The W. variation of the magnetic needle, as observed till the
period when it was the greatest, had been more influenced by
change of longitude than of latitude; though from that time, till
we were under the meridian of Isle de France, it appeared to
depend much more upon change of latitude; for, from the point at
which it had been the greatest, till we passed under the meridian
of Isle de France, having changed our longitude by 17 degrees,
and our latitude by 2&frac12;, the variation had been only
4&deg;, though, by a change of latitude to 17 degrees further
south, the variation had, been found 12&deg; more than at Isle de
France.</p>
<p>The phosphorescence of the sea, during this passage, had
diminished in an inverse proportion to our distance from the
land; so that a considerable time before we saw the island of St.
Paul, one could hardly perceive any appearance of phosphorescence
in the waves.</p>
<p>During our passage from the Cape, the thermometer had never
indicated lower than 8&deg; below 0; nor higher than 20&deg;
above 0. The mercury in the barometer, during the same period,
had never stood higher than 28 inches 7 lines, nor lower than 27
inches 7 lines.</p>
<p>While we were in the track of the variable winds, the currents
had set from 10' to 20' N.; but whilst we were sailing off the
S.W. coast of New Holland, they had set eastward. These
differences in their direction depend upon the situation of the
lands.</p>
<p>Our tables for rectifying the irregularities of our
time-keepers arising from difference of temperature, extended no
farther than 15&deg; of Reaumur's scale, and the balance-bow for
our pendulum-clock was only calculated to answer between 105&deg;
and 115&deg;. The latter was constantly above 115&deg;, and the
temperature of the atmosphere was very often lower than 15&deg;
of the thermometer. It was necessary to keep up a degree of
temperature, at least equal to this, in the place where our
time-keepers were deposited. A common lamp might have answered
this purpose; but we preferred one of D'Argand's, in order to
avoid the smoke.</p>
<p>22d. The boats that had been dispatched the preceding day for
that purpose, were again sent to sound at the entrance of the
station where we intended to cast anchor, as they had not had
time sufficient to do it the evening before. About half an hour
after nine we received the agreeable intelligence, that it was a
very well sheltered harbour, with safe anchorage in a bottom of
muddy sand, not less than 3&frac12; fathoms in depth at the
entrance facing the middle of the bay. Their soundings had given
them from 2&frac12; to 4 fathoms throughout a considerable part
of the harbour, which extends land-inwards about 2,500 toises. It
was a better station in every respect than Adventure-bay, and we
could here supply ourselves with wood and water as easily as we
could with.</p>
<p>Though the breeze was against us, it was at first so
inconsiderable that we could be towed towards the harbour; but we
had scarcely proceeded 500 toises, when it blew fresher and
obliged us to cast an anchor. The Esperance, however, continued
to be towed, and nearly reached the entrance of the harbour
before it grew dark.</p>
<p>A boat which we sent out to fish, took so many at a single
draught of the net, that the distribution was immediately made,
and every one contented with his portion.</p>
<p>We were much surprised to find amongst the fish caught with
the line in the course of the night, some sharks about a fathom
in length. They. were of the species <i>squalus cinereus</i>.
This kind of shark never rises from the bottom of the water. We
never saw it approach the surface during the whole time of our
stay at the Cape of Van Diemen. It does not appear to be
dangerous to man; for our sailors, though they bathed here very
frequently, never met with any accident. It finds sufficient food
on these coasts to satisfy its voracity without attacking men;
otherwise the natives of the country, who frequently dive to a
great depth into the sea in quest of shell-fish, would be in
perpetual danger of being devoured by these animals.</p>
<p>Some mountains, which appeared to be above 500 toises in
perpendicular height, were visible towards the north at a
distance of about 15,000 toises. Their summits were covered with
tall trees, whole verdure gave additional beauty to the
magnificent prospect which they exhibited.</p>
<p>An officer belonging to our vessel, who had been sent to take
the soundings at the farther end of the harbour, went on shore,
where he found several huts, and near them the remains of broiled
shell-fish, which had evidently served for food to the
natives.</p>
<p>25th. As we had hardly any wind, we weighed anchor a few hours
before day-light, in order to be towed into the harbour. As the
calm continued, this proved the most expeditious method, and we
were soon brought into our anchoring place. We ranged at a small
distance from a rock situated about the middle of the entrance,
leaving it to our left. Our soundings indicated a depth of
2&frac12; to 3&frac12; fathoms; in other parts of the same strait
it was from 4&frac12; to 11&frac12;.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock, we cast anchor in a depth of three
fathoms, 350 toises from the entrance of the harbour, to which we
gave the name of Port Dentrecasteaux. The nearest shore was at
the distance of about 250 toises to the eastward.</p>
<p>It is difficult to express the sensations we felt, at finding
ourselves at length sheltered in this solitary harbour at the
extremity of the globe, after having been so long driven to and
fro in the ocean by the violence of the storms.</p>
<p>The boats afterwards towed in the Esperance, which cast anchor
about one o'clock in the afternoon, at a distance of 150 toises
southward of the Recherche. At first we had attempted to approach
nearer to the shore without taking the soundings accurately; but
we soon found ourselves surrounded by the ooze, and were obliged
to heave in at the capstan in order to extricate ourselves.</p>

<p>PORT Dentrecasteaux is situated at the farthest end of
Tempest-bay, and forms an almost oval basin, extending about
2,500 toises in length towards N.N.E. Its greatest breadth is
about 700 toises. The tall forests that surrounded us on all
sides, and the mountains at no great distance from the coast,
which sheltered more than one half of the circumference of the
harbour, added to the security of our anchorage. Though the gales
were never so high, our pinnaces could sail about it with
security. A muddy bottom, about 3&frac12; fathoms in depth, let
them run no hazard if they were driven aground. More than 100
vessels of the line might ride here with safety, and be supplied
with as much wood and water as they stood in need of.</p>
<p>Towards the N.N.E. extremity of the harbour a small river
discharges itself into the sea. Some of our boats attempted to
row up the stream, but were prevented by the large trees that lay
across it. A few wild dogs were observed in the neighbouring
country; and some sheltering places, slightly constructed of the
barks of trees, shewed that the bores were frequented by the
natives. A piece of alga marina, of the species known by the name
of <i>fucus palmatus</i>, was picked up. It was cut into the
shape of a purse, and appeared to have been used as a drinking
vessel, being found filled with water.</p>
<p>The west side of the harbour is the most favourable for taking
in a supply of water. We took in ours on the W.S.W. and our wood
on the opposite shore.</p>
<p>A fire that was seen at the distance of about 5000 toises to
the South, informed us that we were near the habitations of the
savages, although we had as yet sun none of them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I went on shore, accompanied by the gardener
and two others of our ship's company, in order to make an
excursion into the country towards N.E. We were filled with
admiration at the sight of these ancient forests, in which the
sound of the axe had never been heard. The eye was astonished in
contemplating the prodigious size of these trees, amongst which
there were some myrtles more than 25 fathoms in height, whose
tufted summits were crowned with an ever verdant foliage others,
loosened by age from their roots, were supported by the
neighbouring trees, whilst, as they gradually decayed, they were
incorporated piece after piece with the parent-earth. The most
luxuriant vigour of vegetation is here contrasted with its final
dissolution, and presents to the mind a striking picture of the
operations of nature, who, left to herself, never destroys but
that she may again create.</p>
<p>The trees in this forest did not grow so close together as to
prevent us from penetrating into it. We walked for a long time
over ground, where the water, impeded in its course, has formed
itself into marshes, the borders of which we examined deeper
within the forest, we found small rivulets that contained very
good water. Almost every where the soil consisted of a very fine
mould, produced by the decay of vegetables, over a bed of
reddish, and sometimes greyish sand. In some places it consisted
of an argillaceous kind of earth, which imbibing the water with
great facility, forms itself into bogs; in others this earth has
been washed away by the water filtrating through the ground, so
as to form pools, and sometimes deep holes, the surface of which
being covered with plants, one does not easily apprehend any
danger in approaching them, but by the inadvertency of a single
moment may fall into them unawares. An accident of this kind
happened to the surgeon of the Esperance, who, whilst he was
a-hunting, set his foot upon what he took to be firm ground, and
fell into a very deep bog. He immediately disappeared; but
fortunately he was able to swim.</p>
<p>We found some rudiments of huts in these woods, consisting of
a frame-work made of the branches of young trees, and designed to
be afterwards filled up with pieces of the bark, which the
natives always use to cover the outside of their cabins.</p>
<p>I gathered several species of the <i>eucalyptus</i>, during
this excursion; amongst others, that which White has denominated
<i>eucalyptus resinifera</i>. This is a very tall tree, the
spongy bark of which is often three inches in thickness, and
separates very from the trunk. It produces a gum resin, of a
reddish colour and astringent taste, which is used for medicinal
purposes. We likewise collected several species of
<i>philadelphus</i>, the <i>banksia integrifolia</i>, a new
species of <i>epacris</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On the sea-shore we met the servant of Citizen Riche, greatly
delighted with having shot a few birds, which he was carrying to
his master. This man, who had but just recovered from a fit of
illness, was still upon the list of the surgeon of the Esperance,
who thought he had a right to what his patient had shot; but
neither the threat of being purged, nor even that of being put
upon spare diet could make him give up a single bird. The surgeon
too kept his word; for he made him swallow a purgative and put
him upon a spare regimen. The servant, having learnt by
melancholy experience the consequences of disobeying the Doctor,
always ran away as fast as he was able, whenever he espied him in
any of his shooting excursions afterwards.</p>
<p>After having directed our route for some time to the
north-eastward, we arrived before night at the coast directly
opposite to our vessels. We expected to be immediately taken on
board as we had been promised that a boat should be sent to fetch
us, as soon as we wanted one. This might have been done in five
minutes; but we were obliged to wait two hours on the shore. It
would have been a very proper regulation, if a boat had been kept
expressly for the use of those gentlemen of the expedition who
were appointed to make researches into natural history.</p>
<p>A bird that was shot upon one of the lakes, surprised us very
much by the singularity of its plumage. It was a new species of
the swan, of the same beautiful form, but rather larger than
ours. Its colour was a shining black, as striking in its
appearance as the clear white of ours. In each of its wings it
had six large white feathers; a character, which I have uniformly
remarked in several others that were afterwards killed. The upper
mandible was of a red colour, with a transverse white streak near
the extremity. The male had at the base of it an excrescence
confining of two protuberances, that were scarcely observable in
the female. The lower mandible is red at the edges and white in
the middle. The feet are of a dark grey. (See Plate IX.)</p>

<b>PLATE IX. <i>Black Swan of Van Diemen's-land</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>24th. It was ten o'clock of the next morning, before I could
finish my description and preparation of the specimens I had
collected the preceding day. I then went to examine the country
situated to the eastward of our anchoring nation. It frequently
happened that after having penetrated into the woods to the
distance of 500 toises, at most, from the shore, I was obliged to
return towards the coast on account of the difficulties that
obstructed my passage, which was not only impeded by the
underwood, but often rendered impracticable by the stems of large
trees thrown down by the wind. The direction in which they lay
upon the ground, which was generally from south-west to
north-east, proves that they were torn from their roots by
violent south-west winds. As there trees shoot out their roots in
an almost horizontal direction, they are easily torn from the
ground by the force of the wind, and frequently carry with them a
great quantity of earth, which at a distance appears like a wall
raised by the hands of men.</p>
<p>The finest trees in this country are the different species of
<i>eucalyptus</i>. Their ordinary thickness is about eighteen
feet. I have measured some that were twenty-five in
circumference. The spongy bark of the <i>eucalyptus
resinifera</i>, becoming slippery in consequence of the moisture
that constantly prevails in the heart of these thick forests,
renders it still more difficult to penetrate into them. This bark
very readily peels off into pieces that have a great degree of
flexibility, and are used by the natives for covering their huts.
They often find long stripes of it about a foot in breadth, which
spontaneously shell themselves, off from the lower part of the
trunk. They might easily peel it off in pieces of twenty-five or
thirty feet in length.</p>
<p>Most of the large trees near the edges of the sea have been
hollowed near their roots by means of fire. The cavities are
generally directed to wards the north-east, so as to serve as
places of shelter against the south-west winds, which appear to
be the most predominant and violent in these parts. It cannot be
doubted that these cavities are the work of men; for had they
been produced by any accidental cause, such as the underwood
taking fire, the flames muff have encompassed the whole
circumference of the tree. They seem to be places of shelter for
the natives whilst they eat their meals. We found in some of them
the remains of the shell-fish on which they feed, and frequently
the cinders of the fires at which they had dressed their
victuals. The savages, however, are not very safe in these hollow
trees; for the trunk being weakened by the excavation, may easily
be thrown down by a violent gun of wind; neither are their seats
very commodious, as the ground is very uneven, and we observed no
contrivances to render it more level. Anderson speaks of hearths
of clay, made by the natives in there hollow tress. Whenever I
have found any clay in them, it did not appear to me to have been
placed there by the savages; but one frequently meets with it
piled up between the roots in consequence of natural causes. At
any rate, the natives of this country, as we shall see hereafter,
do not make their fires upon hearths, but kindle them on the bare
ground, and prepare their victuals over the coals.</p>
<p>Some of the largest trees were hollowed by the fire throughout
the whole length of their trunks, so as to form a sort of
chimnies; nevertheless they continued to vegetate.</p>
<p>Many of the large trunks that we felled during our stay at
this place, were found, notwithstanding their apparent soundness
externally, to be rotten at the heart.</p>
<p>After having followed the shore that extends with numerous
windings, towards the south-east, we attempted to make our way
across some marshes, in order to get into grounds that had
acquired a more solid consistence from the roots of the plants;
but a species of the <i>selerya</i>, which grows to the height of
six or eight feet, cut our hands and faces, with its leaves, in
such a manner that we were obliged to desist from our
attempt.</p>
<p>During this excursion I killed several birds of the genus
<i>motacilla</i>, and some parrots, amongst which was the parrot
of New Caledonia, described by Latham.</p>
<p>We now directed our route towards the entrance of the harbour,
where tents had been pitched for the purpose of taking
observations, as we were sure of meeting there with a boat to
carry us on board.</p>
<p>The astronomers expected the first of Jupiter's satellites to
appear at about a quarter of an hour after eight in the evening;
but with all their activity they could not get their instruments
ready in due time; so that the opportunity was lost. Bonvouloir,
one of our officers, who had made the preliminary calculations a
long time since, was so affected by this disappointment, that he
wept like a child.</p>
<p>One of our crew shot a young kangarou upon the shore. The
animal, after running about a hundred yards along the sand, threw
himself into the sea and expired. It was remarkable that he used
all his four feet in running, not supporting himself solely upon
the hinder feet, as he is usually represented to do; though these
as well as the fore, are without hair on the inner side. As he
goes in quest of his food more in the night-time than during the
day, nature has provided him with the membrane termed by
zoologists <i>membrana nictitans</i>, situated at the interior
angle of the eye, which he can extend at pleasure over the whole
ball. His stomach was full of vegetable, and divided by three
very distinct partitions, which seem to approach him to the class
of the ruminant quadrupeds. His testicles were on the outside of
the abdomen. These animals probably find a part of their food on
the sea-coast, as we frequently observed the prints of their feet
in the sand.</p>
<p>25th. Having left some of my plants in the hands of the
painter, that he might take a drawing of them, I followed the
windings of the coast in a south-east direction. The large
slippery pebbles which covered the strand were a great impediment
to us in walking.</p>
<p>We found on the skirts of the forest a fence constructed by
the natives against the winds from the bay. It consisted of
stripes of the bark of the <i>eucalyptus resinifera</i>,
interwoven between stakes fixed perpendicularly into the ground,
forming an arch, of about a third of the circumference of a
circle, nine feet in length and three in height, with its convex
side turned toward the bay. A semicircular elevation covered with
cinders, and heaped round with shells, pointed out the place
where the natives dressed their victuals. Such a fence must be of
great service to them to prevent their fires being extinguished,
when the wind blows with violence from the sea.</p>
<p>Having crossed a promontory of the coast, we walked with
difficulty over the loose sands, which cover a large tract of
land, that sometimes lies under water.</p>
<p>We found another of the fences above described on the skirt of
the forest. It was of the same construction and height as the
former, but twice as long. Within it were broken pieces of
drinking vessels made of the <i>fucus palmatus</i>.</p>
<p>We arrived at the borders of a lake, which is connected with
the sea at flood-tide. Its greatest length was 750 toises, and
its breadth 250.</p>
<p>On our return by a more direct road through the woods, we saw
some unfinished huts of the natives. They consisted of branches
fixed by both ends into the ground, and supported the one upon
the other, so as to form a frame-work of an hemispherical form,
about four feet and an half in height. The branches were fastened
together with the leaves of a species of grass; and the buildings
seemed to require nothing more in order to be completed, than to
receive their coverings of bark, which renders them impenetrable
to the rain.</p>
<p>It seems that human beings are here either very few in number
or in a very savage state. Though a great number of the men from
both vessels had penetrated very far into the country, they had
not met with a single inhabitant.</p>
<p>The Cape of Van Diemen is subject, in consequence of its high
latitude, to very violent winds, which blow from the mountains in
blasts. Fearing that our cables might rot upon the middy bottom
of this harbour, we had taken them on board and held on our
chain. A sudden and violent gale from. N.W. drove us from our
anchorage, to the east side of the harbour, where we ran a-ground
in the mud. After having drawn in the piece of cable to which the
chain was fastened, we found that one of the links had been
broken; though upon examining it we could not perceive any flaw
in the iron, appeared that the chain had been made of brittle
metal. We thought it fortunate that it had been put to the proof
in a harbour, where we ran no other danger than that of being
stuck in the mud; otherwise this chain, upon which our safety
depended, would have become the cause of our ruin.</p>
<p>26th. I remained the whole day on board, employed with
preparing and describing the numerous curiosities of natural
history, which I had collected on the preceding days.</p>
<p>On the following day, soon after dawn, we set out with a
design of penetrating as far as we were able into the country. We
were set on shore towards S.E. After having followed the windings
of the shore for some time, we came to a road frequented by the
natives, which enabled us to enter the forest in a south
direction. We afterwards arrived at a fine sandy beach, extending
about 1000 toises in the same direction.</p>
<p>A beautiful species of <i>erigeron</i>, the woody item, of
which is covered with very small bulbous leaves, grew in this dry
ground. Though there was very little wind, the waves broke with
violence over a great extent of the beach. We regularly observed
that, after three successive waves, one much larger than the rest
followed and broke higher upon the beach, so as to oblige us to
keep further off from the shore.</p>
<p>On a small rising ground of the coast, I found the species of
the <i>banksia</i>, denominated by G&aelig;rtner <i>banksia
gibbosa</i>. Whilst we were journeying through the forest, at a
small distance from the shore, one of our company observed a
young savage, who was running away affrighted by a shot which had
been fired at a bird. As soon as we were informed of it, we all
ran in pursuit of him, being very desirous of having an interview
with some of the natives. But all our search was in vain; for the
young savage had disappeared by rushing into the thickest of the
forest at the risk of tearing his skin; for he was stark naked.
We found one of the fences against the sea-winds at the place
where he had been first seen.</p>
<p>The hope of meeting with some of the savages determined us to
penetrate farther into the forest, with a resolution to pass the
night there. We walked for the space of an hour towards the
southeast, over a very rugged path, before we arrived at a large
plain that extended as far as the sea-shore. A beautiful species
of the mimosa grew here, with long oval leaves, and generally
about twenty-five or thirty feet in height.</p>
<p>Night compelled us to look out for a place of shelter. We
could not have recourse to the cavities burnt in large trees by
the natives, as we were too far distant from them; we therefore
constructed a hut of branches, which we had lopped from the trees
with a pole-axe that one of our company, carried with him for his
defence. The hardness of the ground was meliorated with a bed of
fern, of a species very nearly resembling the <i>polypodium
dichotomum</i>.</p>
<p>Being close to the shore, we had a very extensive prospect,
but observed no signs of the natives being near us. We kindled a
fire as the weather was very sharp.</p>
<p>We were not altogether easy with respect to our means of
subsistence; for when we left the ship we had furnished ourselves
with but one day's provisions; but as sailors are used always to
take some sea-biscuit with them when they go on a journey, those
who accompanied us were still provided with some of it. With this
stock of eatables, our most necessary requisite was water, which
we were obliged to send for to a distance of 1000 toises. Such a
supper as this certainly required a good appetite.</p>
<p>As we were seven in number, we had not much to fear from the
natives. We however settled it that every one should stand upon
watch in his turn, that we might be informed of their motions in
case any of them should come near us.</p>
<p>The severity of the cold obliged us to quit our hut and lie
down to sleep round the fire.</p>
<p>28th. As soon as it was day we went out with our guns, to
endeavour to shoot something for our breakfast. We soon killed a
couple of rooks, which were immediately broiled and eaten, as if
they had been the most delicate food.</p>
<p>We had been obliged to reduce ourselves to a very moderate
allowance on the preceding evening, that we might have means of
subsistence for the following day; but we sound, when it was too
late, that the person to whom we had intrusted the care of our
provisions, was not to be depended upon, for of the six biscuits
that had been committed to his charge, only four were left. Had
he carried, his breach of trust a little farther, we should have
been obliged to return to the ships immediately, with the
mortification of being compelled to relinquish our intended
researches.</p>
<p>We soon arrived at the borders of a large lake, connected with
the sea by a channel about 120 feet in breadth. We attempted to
ford it, but it was too deep about the middle.</p>
<p>Amongst a great variety of other plants that grew in the
neighbouring woods, I observed several species of a new genus of
the <i>pedicularia</i>, very nearly resembling the
<i>polygala</i>. Amongst the shrubs which ornamented the grounds
near the shore, was a beautiful species of sensitive plant with
simple leaves, the stalk of which was bent into the form of the
letter S.</p>
<p>We saw a large flock of black swans sailing upon the lake; but
they were not within reach of our guns. Some small islands were
visible towards S.E. near the opposite shore of the lake. We
killed a number of snipes of different kinds while we directed
our march towards S.W. in order to arrive at the farthest
extremity of the lake. The bottom of the lake is here so even,
that throughout a surface of more than fifty toises in length,
the water is hardly more than a foot and an half deep. It is
covered with a prodigious quantity of shells, many of which are
decayed in consequence of the length of time they have lain
there.</p>
<p>The <i>crista marina</i> is found upon these shores. I
discovered at a little distance from them a new species of
parsley, which I named <i>apium prostratum</i>, on account of the
position of its stem, which always creeps along the ground. Its
analogy with the other species of the same genus, led me to think
it might be good to eat, and it answered my expectations. We
carried a large quantity of it onboard with us, which was
acceptable to mariners who felt the necessity of obviating, by
vegetable diet, the bad effects of the salt provisions on which
we had lived during the whole of our passage from the Cape of
Good Hope to that of Van Diemen.</p>
<p>Cretin, one of the officers of our ship, together with the
engineer, had been sent with the long-boat by our Commander, in
order to reconnoitre Tempest-bay. They brought intelligence at
their return, after having advanced fifteen or twenty thousand
toises into a channel which we had left on our right when we
entered the bay, that every appearance concurred to make it
probable that this was a strait. Wherever they had sounded they
found very good anchorage ground.</p>
<p>29th. I was very little on shore during the two following
days.</p>
<p>30th. The whole forenoon I employed in describing and
preparing the copious collections which I had made on my last
excursion. In those parts of the country which I examined in the
afternoon, I found several plants of the tribe of <i>orchis</i>,
some of which I gave to be copied by the painter.</p>
<p>The fishing nets were regularly sent out every evening, and
abundance of fish was taken. The meals we now made on board
contrasted very strikingly with those we had been obliged to put
up with during our passage.</p>
<p>I must here remark, that those of our company who were engaged
in the pursuit of natural history, were not permitted to take
with them, on their excursions, the smallest quantity of that
allowance of fresh provisions which we claimed as our right:
ship's biscuit, cheese, brandy, and sometimes a little salted
bacon, was all that was provided for us. The reasons we alledged
were sufficient to evince the justice of our demand;
nevertheless, we had no other provisions allowed us on these
occasions, during the whole course of our expedition. I should
have passed over this circumstance in silence, had I not thought
that it might afford a useful hint to persons employed in the
same pursuit, who may hereafter be engaged in such
expeditions.</p>
<p>MAY 1st. I resolved to examine the other coast of the harbour
to the eastward. The bottom was here so shallow, that we could
not come close to the land with our boat, so that we were obliged
to wade part of the way in the water.</p>
<p>I followed the coast in a northerly direction, sometimes
penetrating a short way into the forests. As it was low-tide, I
walked with great facility along the shore, where I observed
several small holes, in the form of a tunnel, made in the sand,
each of which contained a small crab at the bottom. Upon drawing
out the animal, it soon crawled back into its hiding place,
which, as I judge from its analogy with that of the <i>formica
leo</i> in our country, serves it likewise as a trap to catch its
prey.</p>
<p>I was agreeably surprised by the singular form of a new
species of fungus, which grew amongst the mosses with which the
ground was covered. I named it <i>asero&euml;</i>, on account of
the disposition of its radii.</p>
<p>Its roots are small filaments attached to a fungous tubercle,
which supports a globular <i>volva</i>, of a whitish colour and
gelatinous consistence, marked both within and without with seven
stri&aelig;.</p>
<p>From the centre of this volva proceeds a <i>stipes</i> of a
reddish colour, and an almost cylindrical form, hollow
throughout, and open at its superior extremity, which forms a
sort of cup, of a fine red colour, and divided into seven
<i>bifurcate radii</i>, yellow at their extremities. The whole
surface of this fungus is smooth.</p>
<p>This new genus ought to be placed next in order to the genus
<i>phallus</i> of Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>The declivities of the mountains situated to the eastward,
form a pleasant valley, from whence the waters, collected there
by the union of a great number of small streams, are discharged
into the bay. By washing the stems of the large trees which cover
the country, through which it flows, the water acquires a
brownish tinge. The closeness of the shrubs, and the marshes
which occupy the low grounds of this valley render it very
difficult of access. We were, however, resolved to attempt it at
the risk of sticking fast in the mud; but were often stopped in
our progress, by a new species of the <i>scleria</i>, to which I
gave the name of <i>scleria grandis</i>, as it frequently grows
to the height of twelve feet. Its leaves are as sharp at the
edges as a piece of glass; its berries are oval and of a reddish
colour, and contain a sort of almond, which the parrots
frequently feed upon, notwithstanding the hardness of the shell
which surrounds it.</p>
<p>The most common shrub in these low grounds was a new species
of the <i>embothrium</i>, remarkable for the hardness of its
leaves. These leaves are of an oval form, three inches in length
and one in breadth.</p>
<p>We followed a very difficult path, in order to arrive at the
place where our men were taking in water. Night overtook us
before we had finished more than half our journey, and to add to
our misfortunes, a very high wind from the west brought with it
such a heavy rain, that we were obliged, like the savages of New
Holland, to seek for shelter in hollow trunks of trees. We had
reason to apprehend that the signals we made for a boat to come
to fetch us, would be rendered useless by the rainy weather, and
were beginning to make preparations for passing a very unpleasant
night in the midst of the forest; when we heard the voices of
some sailors who were sent to fetch us on board.</p>
<p>They had at length succeeded in extricating the anchor to
which the chain that was broken on the 25th of April had been
fastened. The drag had been used in vain as the chain was sunk
too deep into the mud. The hold of the anchor in the ground was
so strong, that the two long boats lashed together were
repeatedly filled with water whilst they were hauling at the
buoy-rope. Besides, it was sunk so deep, that the divers could
not find its bill; it would have been better if the main capstan
had been used. They then became sensible of the necessity of
doubling the buoy-rope and heaving the anchors from time to time,
to prevent them from sinking too deep in the muddy bottom.</p>
<p>Two boats had been sent a second time to reconnoitre the
north-east side of Tempest-bay, as far as Cape Tasman. They
returned at the end of four days, and it appeared to result from
their observations, that Tasman's headland and the coast of
Adventure-bay made part of an island separated from Van Diemen's
land by the sea. After they had gone up the channel as far as
43&deg; 17' S. lat. they were obliged to return for want of
provisions.</p>
<p>2d. My occupations on board did not permit me to go far into
the country.</p>
<p>3d. On the following day we traversed a glade that extended in
a north-east direction, and conducted us to the great lake. We
had examined the southern side of it in a former excursion, but
we wished still to visit its northern coast, the various
situations of which gave us reason to expect an abundance of
natural curiosities; nor were our hopes deceived. This coast was
in many places formed of high banks, very difficult of access;
the water frequently extending as far as the foot of the hills.
Different species of <i>mimosa</i>, with simple leaves, grew
under the shade of the large trees.</p>
<p>It appears that the natives sometimes fix their habitations
upon the borders of this lake, which affords them abundance of
food in the shell-fish it contains. We found a hut which they had
built a few paces from the shore, of a semi-oval form, about
three feet and three quarters high, and four feet broad at the
base. It consisted of branches fixed at both ends into the ground
and bent into a semi-circular form, supporting each other, so as
to form a pretty solid frame-work, which was covered with the
bark of trees.</p>
<p>Amongst a number of other curious plants which I collected, I
was struck with the beauty of the flower of a new species of
<i>aletris</i>, remarkable for its bright scarlet colour.</p>
<p>As the season was already far advanced, we found very few
insects.</p>
<p>Some hours before sun-set we directed our course to the south
in order to return to our ships; but it was already dark before
we arrived at a sandy beach that we were acquainted with. We were
still at a great distance from the ships, and it was not before
half an hour after nine o'clock that we arrived at the tents of
observation, from whence we were soon conveyed on board.</p>
<p>5th. I remained on board during the greater part of the two
following days, and employed myself with stuffing the skins of a
variety of rare birds, and describing the natural curiosities
which had collected.</p>
<p>The want of room in our vessel put me under the necessity of
drying the plants, which I had preserved in paper, at the fire.
As my cabin was already full, I had no other place where I could
deposit some of my specimens of plants that had not got perfectly
dry than the great cabin. Dauribeau, who acted as first
lieutenant, thought that this place ought not to be lumbered with
such useless things as natural curiosities, and ordered my two
presses, with the plants they contained, to be turned out. I was
obliged to appeal to the Commander, who annulled this act of
authority, and ordered that the presses should remain where I had
placed them.</p>
<p>At low water we found a variety of curious shells on the
shore. This harbour afforded us great plenty of very fine
oysters.</p>
<p>The east coast of the harbour contained a quantity of pyrites
in crystals of various forms. We likewise observed large masses
of silex in very close strata, which bore a great resemblance to
petrified wood.</p>
<p>One of our carpenters killed an amphibious animal of the
species known by the name of <i>phoca monachus</i>, about six
feet in length.</p>
<p>Physiologists have explained in a very ingenious manner how
amphibious animals are enabled to remain so long under the water
by means of the <i>foramen ovale</i>; but, upon examining the
heart of this animal with the utmost attention, I did not find
that it had any <i>foramen ovale</i>. Probably the same may be
the case with many other amphibious animals. By pursuing these
researches we may one day discover the true cause of the
astonishing faculty possessed by these animals, of living equally
well both in the air and in the water.</p>
<p>Each side of its lungs is divided by a transverse fissure into
two lobes.</p>
<p>The stomach, which resembles in shape very nearly that of a
hog, contained a large quantity of calcareous sand, amongst which
I observed seven shell-fish that were still entire. The first
part of the function of digestion in this animal seems to consist
in destroying the shell in which the fish is enclosed, whereby a
quantity of sand is produced in its stomach, which does not
appear to pass through the rest of the intestinal canal, but is
probably disgorged in the same manner as many snakes disgorge the
bones of the animals on which they feed. Possibly too this sand
may serve them as a sort of ballast, by which they are enabled to
keep themselves at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>As the food upon which they live is very easily found, their
mouth is formed with a very small orifice. As they live more in
the water than in the air, they require a great power of
refraction in the humours of the eye; whence the vitreous humour
is found to be very dense. They are likewise provided with the
<i>membrana nictitans</i>, whereby they are enabled to admit a
greater or lesser quantity of light to the eye at pleasure.</p>
<p>The great variety of my other occupations did not permit me to
pursue these anatomical investigations any further.</p>
<p>The dried excrements of this animal produce a very fine powder
of a deep yellow colour, which our painter thought might be used
with advantage in the arts.</p>
<p>6th. I had not as yet been able to procure any of the flowers
of a new species of the <i>eucalyptus</i>, remarkable by its
fruit, which very much resembles a coat-button in shape.</p>
<p>This tree, which is one of the tallest in nature, as it grows
sometimes to the height of 150 feet, blossoms only near its
summit. Its trunk exactly resembles that of the <i>eucalyptus
resinifera</i>, when its spongy bark has been peeled off. In
other respects these two species are nearly of the same
dimensions. The trunk, which is very straight, at least to one
half of its height, might be usefully employed in ship-building,
and especially for masts, although it is neither so light nor so
elastic as that of the fir. Possibly it might be of advantage to
construct masts of different pieces of timber, and even to
perforate the large trunks of trees throughout their whole
length, so as to render them lighter, and to give them strength
by binding them at equal distances with hoops of iron. By this
means, I should think, they might be rendered as strong as one
could wish; since persons versed in mechanics know that a
cylinder, though hollow, still retains a great degree of
strength.</p>
<p>We were obliged to cut down one of these trees in order to
obtain its blossoms. Being already in a very slanting position,
it was easily felled. As the sun shone very bright the sap was
mounting in abundance, and as soon as the tree was cut down it
slowed very copiously from the lower part of the trunk.</p>
<p>This beautiful tree, which belongs to the tribe of the
myrtles, has a very smooth bark; its branches branches are
somewhat crooked, and have towards their extremity alternate
leaves, lightly bent, and about six inches in length, and one
half in breadth.</p>
<p>The flowers are solitary, and grow from the base of the stalk
of the leaf.</p>
<p>The calix is shaped like an inverted urn, and consists, like
that of the other genera of the same tribe, of a single leaf,
which falls off as soon as the stamina are completely formed.</p>
<p>It has no corolla.</p>
<p>The stamina are numerous and attached to the sides of the
receptacle.</p>
<p>The style is simple and divided at its base into four
partitions. It has only one stigma.</p>
<p>The capsule is open at the top, and generally divided into
four partitions, which contain a number of angular seeds; at the
base it has four angles, two of which project more than the rest.
It is shaped like a button, on which account I have denominated
this tree <i>eucalyptus globulus</i>.</p>

<p>The bark, leaves and fruit of this tree are of an aromatic
nature, and might be employed for economical uses in the place of

exclusively by the Molucca Islands.</p>
<p>On the seventh, I was obliged to employ almost the whole day
in preparing my collections, which accumulated prodigiously from
day to day. I could therefore extend my researches only to a very
small distance from our anchoring-station. But on the following
day, I set out in the afternoon with a design of spending three
or four days in the woods without returning at night to the
ships. I was obliged to take this resolution in order to collect
specimens of such plants as only grew at a considerable distance
from our station.</p>
<p>We had a great variety of different kinds of European grain on
board, which might be advantageously propagated at this extremity
of New Holland. The temperature that generally prevails in this
country led us to hope that they would succeed. Our gardener was
directed to prepare a spot of ground so as to render it sit for
receiving this deposit. He dug a small garden for this purpose on
the east coast of the harbour, situated E.N.E. of our place of
anchorage.</p>
<p>We slept on the banks of a rivulet near the western extremity
of the great lake, along the southern coast of which we directed
our route on the following day. We saw some pelicans; they did
not come within gun-shot of us.</p>
<p>Piron, the painter to the expedition, who was of our party,
took several drawings of the landscape. The round hills, covered
with tall trees, which bounded the horizon added greatly to the
beauty of the prospect.</p>
<p>We were obliged to return back by the road we had come, in
order to arrive at the opposite side of the lake. Piron returned
on board.</p>
<p>I discovered an evergreen tree, which has its nut situated,
like that of the acajou, upon a fleshy receptacle much larger
than itself. I therefore named this new genus
<i>exocarpos</i>.</p>
<p>It has hermaphrodite flowers upon the same peduncle with
others which are distinctly male and female.</p>
<p>The male flowers have a calix divided into five roundish
leaves; they have no corolla; the stamina, which are five in
number, are small and attached to the calix between its
divisions; the germen abortive.</p>
<p>The female flowers have a calix similar to that of the male;
but neither corolla nor stamina; the ovarium is globular, with a
short style; the stigma circular and flat.</p>
<p>In the hermaphrodite flowers, the calix, stamina and ovarium
are as I have described them in the others.</p>
<p>The fruit is a nut of an almost spherical form, and of a
blackish colour, placed upon a receptacle, fleshy, red, divided
in the middle, and about three times as large as the nut.</p>
<p>The kernel is of an oily nature, and of the same shape with
its shell.</p>
<p>The principal characters of this plant have led me to rank it
among the terebinthinaceous tribe, next to the anacardium. I have
given it the name of <i>exocarpos cupressiformis</i>.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the evening we arrived at the banks of a
rivulet, where we fixed our place of abode for the night. I
observed at this southern extremity of New Holland several
species of <i>ancistrum</i>, analogous to those found at the
southernmost extremity of America.</p>
<p>We were surrounded with pleasant groves, consisting for the
greater part of a beautiful species of <i>thesium</i> with strait
leaves.</p>
<p>The cold had obliged us to kindle a large fire. Some of us
were scarcely beginning to fall asleep, when we suddenly heard
the cry of a beast of prey at a few paces distance. Our fire had
probably been of greater service to us, in preventing this
animal, which from the sound of its voice we believed to be a
leopard, from approaching nearer, than we should have expected
when we kindled it.</p>
<p>I had found, on one of the preceding days, the upper jaw-bone
of a large animal of the carnivorous tribe.</p>
<p>10th. As soon as the day appeared, we continued our journey on
the borders of the lake, At a very small distance from the coast
we observed five islands covered with trees, which formed an
agreeable contrast with the level surface this vast sheet of
water.</p>
<p>We perceived, for the first time in this country, several
quails that flew at a great distance from us.</p>
<p>After marching for several hours towards the north-east, we
found upon a small hill, under the shade of some very tall trees,
two huts of the same construction with those we had seen before.
They were in perfectly good preservation, and seemed to have been
lately inhabited.</p>
<p>I discovered a very beautiful plant, which forms a new genus
very distinct from any that has hitherto been described. It
resembles the iris, but has only two stamina. On account of this
singularity, f gave it the name of <i>diplarenna</i>, and on
account of its affinity with the genus mor&aelig;a, I called it
<i>diplarenna mor&aelig;a</i>.</p>
<p>The spatha has two partitions, and incloses several flowers,
which leave it one after the other when they are ready to blow.
They fade much sooner than those of the <i>iris</i> and
<i>mor&aelig;a</i>, so that I should have given, up all hopes of
having them copied; if new ones had not followed the others which
withered almost immediately after I had plucked the plant from
the ground.</p>
<p>Like the iris, it has no calix.</p>
<p>The corolla has six petals, three of which are interior, and
much smaller than the exterior; of the three interior petals, the
superior is rather smaller than the rest, and more inflated
towards the base.</p>
<p>Upon examining a great number of the flowers, I have uniformly
found that they contain only two stamina, the filaments of which
terminate in a point supporting anther&aelig; of a white colour,
and marked with two fissures. In the place of a third stamen, I
have only found a small filament, without any anther&aelig;,
situated between the superior interior petal.</p>
<p>The ovarium is inferior. It has three angles, and is supported
by a long peduncle.</p>
<p>The style is a little longer than the stamina, cylindrical,
and terminated by a stigma shaped like a shepherd's crook.</p>
<p>The capsule has three partitions, containing several spherical
seeds, which are fixed to a receptacle that extends from the
middle of the partitions to the top.</p>
<p>This genus, which naturally ranks after the <i>iris</i> and
the <i>mor&aelig;a</i>, has all the habitudes of those plants.
Its leaves are of the same sword-like form, with their edges
compressed near the base.</p>

<p>As we were walking through a small grove, where the underwood
grew very thick, I roused a large kangarou at a very small
distance from me. He immediately ran a length of about thirty
paces through one of those narrow paths which these animals make
for themselves through the thicket, where they are obliged to use
all their four feet, as they have no room for an ere posture; and
having reached the farther end, bounded away over the bushes with
such swiftness, that we soon lost sight of him.</p>
<p>We found a sheet of water covered with a prodigious number of
wild ducks, which flew up when we were quite close to them; but
we were so little prepared for such good fortune, that we were
not able to kill a single bird.</p>
<p>A high wind sprung up towards night, which seemed to threaten
rain. As we had no place of flicker near us, we were obliged to
sleep in the open air. We constructed a fence against the wind
with branches, under shelter of which it was easy to kindle a
large fire.</p>
<p>11th. On the following day we directed our course eastward,
and traversed a vast plain, beset in many places with marshes,
where the plants with which they are overgrown conceal the danger
one is exposed to in passing through them. The water collected in
the lowest situations gives rise to a number of very fine
rivulets.</p>
<p>A very large kangarou sprang out of a bush about four paces
from me. I pointed my gun at him, but it missed fire, and the
animal walked off very composedly, following one of those tracks
through the thicket which they usually frequent. There tracks are
covered passages which cross each other in every direction, and
run very close one to another. The numerous prints of the feet of
those quadrupeds observable upon them, shew that they abound in
this country. The best way of catching them would be to hunt them
with dogs, as they generally keep themselves in the thickest part
of the woods. Their tracks generally terminate at some
rivulet.</p>
<p>Having exhausted our stock of provisions, we were compelled to
endeavor to reach the ships before night. We wandered about the
woods a long time before we arrived at the north-east extremity
of the harbour, from whence we had a distant view of our vessels.
It was not without great difficulty that we reached the place
where they rode at anchor, as we had to pass through many very
rugged grounds.</p>
<p>12th. The whole day was hardly sufficient for me to prepare
and describe what I had collected on our last excursion.</p>
<p>Having left some of my specimens which could not be preserved
without being daily attended to, in the care of one of the
servants, who remained on board during my absence. I had the
satisfaction to find them in good condition.</p>
<p>Citizen Riche found some human bones amongst the ashes of a
fire made by the natives. Several bones of the pelvis he
discovered by their form to have been part of the skeleton of a
young woman some of them were still covered with pieces of
broiled flesh. I am, however, scrupulous of ranking the natives
of this country with the cannibals. I rather suppose that they
have the custom of burning the bodies of their dead; as there
were the only human bones that were seen during the whole of our
abode in this place.</p>
<p>On the 13th I went to the place where our men were taking in
their water. It was furnished by a small rivulet, which
discharges itself into the harbour, after flowing amongst the
trunks of fallen trees with which the country is covered. The
rotten wood gives the water of this rivulet a brownish tinge.
They were obliged to roll the casks upwards of a hundred yards to
the boats, as these could not come nearer to the shore on account
of the shallowness of the bottom.</p>
<p>We found the carpenters employed in railing the sides of our
pinnace, which had shortly before been overset whilst it was
sailing in the harbour. The crew had been obliged to save
themselves by swimming till assistance was brought them. It had
been furnished with too high a mast, and much too large a sail,
by the lieutenant, who ought to have understood the proportions
better.</p>
<p>The wood made use of by the carpenters was that of the new
species of the eucalyptus, which I have denominated <i>eucalyptus
globulus</i>. They thought it very good timber for
ship-building.</p>
<p>A perpetual moisture prevailed in the thick forests into which
I penetrated towards S.W. Mosses and ferns of various kinds grew
there with great luxuriance. I killed a bird of that species of
the <i>merops</i>, which White has denominated the wattled
bee-easter, and of which he has given, a very good engraving. It
is remarkable for its two large excrescences on each side of its
head.</p>
<p>I was obliged to make great haste in preparing the skins of
the birds which I wished to preserve; for the flesh, when exposed
to the air, very soon became full of small living larv&aelig;,
deposited in it by a fly of a reddish brown, colour, which is
viviparous like that of our country, known by the name of
<i>musca carnaria</i>. These larv&aelig; accelerate the
putrefaction of flesh in a surprising manner.</p>
<p>As we intended to weigh anchor on the following day, I wished
to make the best use of the last moments of our stay in this
place, and went on shore at the easterly coast nearest to our
vessels.</p>
<p>I visited, in company with the gardener, the spot where he had
sown different kinds of European grains. It was a plot of ground
of twenty-seven feet by twenty-one, divided into four beds. The
soil was rather too full of clay to insure the success of the
seed.</p>
<p>When we had entered the woods, a quadruped of the size of a
large dog sprang from a bush quite near to one of our company.
This animal, which was of a white colour spotted with black, had
the appearance of a beast of prey. There can be little doubt that
these countries will at some future time add several new species
to the classes of zoology. A spinal vertebra, that was found in
the interior part of the country, the body of which was about
four inches in diameter, gives reason to believe that very large
quadrupeds will some time be discovered here.</p>
<p>A very heavy rain, which overtook us about the middle of the
day, obliged us to halt. We sheltered ourselves in the hollow
trunk of a large tree that was upwards of twenty-four feet in
circumference. We attempted to kindle a fire in it after the
manner of the New Hollanders, but the smoke soon drove us from
our retreat.</p>
<p>We endeavoured to penetrate into parts which we had not yet
visited. A glade, at which we arrived, seemed to conduct us
towards the northeast plain. We had only three hours of the day
before us. A steep ascent impeded our journey, large trees heaped
one upon another obstructed the path, and the shrubs, to which
the moisture that prevails in these forests, give an uncommonly
luxuriant growth, increased the difficulties we had to encounter.
Amongst these shrubs was a beautiful species of polypodium, the
stem of which grows to the height of twelve feet.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The reader will easily excuse me for not
enumerating by name all the curiosities of natural history, which
I collected during this expedition; especially as I intended to
do it in a separate work.]</p>
<p>Towards close of evening we found ourselves on the borders of
the lesser lake. The woods that surrounded it did not permit us
to follow it dry-shod in all its windings; the water through
which we had to wade was; fortunately, not very deep.
Notwithstanding the darkness of the night, discovered a new
species of <i>restio</i>, which I had never seen before.</p>
<p>This lake, though it is connected with the sea at high water,
does not abound with fish. Some of the crew of the Esperance had
been here, with their nets, but caught nothing.</p>
<p>Having reached the sea-shore, we had still considerable part
of our march before us. It was night, and the thick clouds
increased its obscurity. Sometimes we were obliged to pals over
large blocks of rounded stones washed by the surge. We groped our
way along the shore, at the hazard of falling into the sea, and
it was with great difficulty that we were able to support
ourselves on our feet amongst the wet stones, that were rendered
still more slippery by being covered with fucus and other marine
productions.</p>
<p>A great number of phosphoric animalcules, of different sizes,
were driven on shore by the waves, and afforded us the only light
we had to direct our steps.</p>
<p>At length we arrived at the place where the tents had been
pitched for taking astronomical observations. We found nobody
there, as the instruments had already been carried on board.</p>
<p>Our master sail-maker having gone the preceding day on a
shooting excursion, without any companion, had lost his way in
the woods, where he was obliged to spend the night. Several guns
were fired to let him know where the ships lay at anchor; and in
the afternoon he returned on board emaciated with hunger and
fatigue. Having set out without any provisions, he had been a day
and an half without food. He related, that during the night
several quadrupeds had come to smell at him, within a few inches
distance. Many of the crew believed him on his word; but we, who
had spent several nights in the woods, and had never met with
such familiarity from the beasts, were not so credulous; but far
from imagining that he wished to impose upon us, we found, in his
narrative, the natural effects produced upon the imagination of a
man deprived of nourishment, and all alone in the midst of
immense and pathless forests.</p>
<p>15th. On the preceding day the large anchor had been drawn up
and a smaller one moored, that we might be able the sooner to
leave the harbour. The same had been done by the Esperance. Some
sudden blasts from the north-east, during the night, drove both
ships from their anchors and ran them aground in the mud. They;
however, suffered no damage, and were easily let again afloat. It
was surprising that they should have thought themselves secure
with one small anchor, but just moored in a muddy bottom, as this
sort of bottom affords very little hold till the anchor be sunk
to a considerable depth.</p>
<p>We only waited for a favourable wind to leave the harbour.
During the whole day it was contrary, and in the night time it
blew with great violence. Dauribeau, however, although we had ran
aground only the night before, thought it sufficient to moor a
single cablet; but his opinion was overruled by the rest of the
officers, who knew, from experience, the necessity of holding by
the large anchor.</p>
<p>During our abode at the Cape of Van Diemen we had only seen
the natives at at a considerable distance; those who had observed
us having always fled with great precipitation. Some of them left
behind them their household utensils, which gave us a very
imperfect specimen of their industry. These were baskets,
clumsily constructed of the reeds known by the name of <i>juncus
acutus</i>, and drinking vessels, made of a large piece of
<i>fucus palmatus</i>, cut into a circular form, and moulded into
the shape of a purse. We never found any weapons of defence in
the places from whence they had fled: no doubt, they either
carried them away, or carefully concealed them, for fear that we
might employ them against themselves.</p>
<p>These scattered huts indicated a very scanty population; and
the heaps of shells which we found near the sea-shore, shewed
that these savages derive their principal means of subsistence
from the shell-fish which they find there.</p>
<p>As we only once discovered human bones in this country, and
those partly burnt, it appears that they do not expose the bodies
of their dead to the open air. It is difficult to know whether it
be their usual custom to burn them; possibly they bury them in
the earth, or throw them into the sea.</p>
<p>The great number of tracks marked with prints of the feet of
quadrupeds, shew that they abound in this country. They probably
remain during the day-time in the thickest part of these
inaccessible forests.</p>
<p>A great number of small rivulets discharge themselves into the
harbour. The ground was here so full of moisture, that wherever a
hole was dug of a moderate depth, it immediately became filled
with water.</p>
<p>We generally took copious draughts of fishes with our nets;
especially when the east and south-east winds drove them into the
bay.</p>
<p>Van Diemen's land was discovered by Tasman in the month of
November, 1642. When Captain Cook anchored here four years after
Furneaux, in the year 1777, he thought himself the third European
navigator who had been upon this coast. Cook did not know at that
time that Captain Marion, after having remained here for some
time, sailed from thence on the 10th of March, 1772. The natives
conducted themselves in a very different manner to these two
navigators. Possibly the gentleness with which they behaved to
Captain Cook, might be an effect of their terror for European
fire-arms, of which they had received an idea from Marion's
having been under the necessity of using them against them.</p>
<p>The place of our observatory, situated near the entrance of
the harbour to the right of the vessels, was 43&deg; 32' 24" S.
lat. 144&deg; 46' E long.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle was 7&deg; 39' 32" E.</p>
<p>The inclination of a flat needle was 70&deg; 30'.</p>
<p>The tides flowed only once a day. The time of high water in
the harbour at full and change days, was between nine and twelve
o'clock, the water rising about six feet perpendicular height.
The tides were very much influenced by the winds, which often
advanced or retarded them by several hours.</p>
<p>The sheltered situation of this harbour, renders it the most
commodious in the world for vessels to put into in order to be
repaired. The vast forests, with which it is surrounded, furnish
a timber which our carpenters considered as very proper for ship
building, and which they employed with great advantage.</p>
<p>During our stay of nearly a month at this place, the weather
was very unfavourable for making astronomical observations. The
season of the year was likewise not an eligible one for
investigation, these coasts, which was rendered still more
difficult by the violence of the winds.</p>
<p>Whilst we remained at the Cape of Van Diemen, the north-west
and south-west winds were very violent; the former were generally
attended with storms and heavy rains.</p>
<p>As soon as it was day the vessels were towed to the mouth of
the harbour, from whence we sailed with a north breeze towards
the new which we intended to enter.</p>
<p>After ranging along the windings of the reef, which we had
left on our larboard side when we entered Tempest-bay, we were at
ten o'clock in the forenoon at the distance of about 7,600 toises
from the entrance of the strait, which bore N.N.W. when we
trimmed our sails as sharp as possible.</p>
<p>The summits of the highest mountains were already whitened
with the snow. These mountains form part of a chain which extends
from south-east to north-west, and terminates near the farthest
extremity of the harbour.</p>
<p>We were much gratified in viewing, from the ship, the places
which we had lately visited in our excursions.</p>
<p>At one time we observed a thick smoke ascending from the
distant country to the northward of the great lake, and soon
descried five of the natives walking away from a fire which they
had just been kindling on the shore: one of them carried a
fire-brand in his hand with which he lighted the flames in
different places, where the fire presently caught and was almost
as soon extinguished.</p>
<p>We plied to windward, keeping in with the coast; as we had no
danger to apprehend from approaching it.</p>
<p>A slight breeze from the north, as well as the tide, being
against us, we could not enter the strait before night. We
therefore cast anchor at the mouth of it, in a bottom of grey
sand, at the depth of 30 fathoms. The place where we had pitched
our tents of observation was then at the distance of about 10,000
toises to the westward.</p>
<p>The mercury in the barometer having been gradually falling for
the space of four and twenty hours, remained stationary at
27&frac12; inches, though the sky appeared still, very clear. We
were not without some uneasiness, as so great a variation in the
barometer had never failed during our stay in the harbour to be
followed by violent winds. Probably such blew at a distance, but
we experienced none of their effects. During the night we saw a
fire to the west, kindled by the natives.</p>
<p>17th. The current having become favourable about nine in the
morning, we weighed anchor with a northerly breeze, and plied to
the windward.</p>
<p>We were near enough to the coast to be able to perceive at the
entrance of the strait a sort of free-stone, similar to that
found in port Dentrecasteaux.</p>
<p>The snows had increased prodigiously upon the summits of the
high mountains, during the preceding night.</p>
<p>The mercury in the barometer had sunk to 27 inches 4 4-10th
lines, though the breeze from the north still continued
slight.</p>
<p>It was night when we entered the strait to which we gave the
name of our Commander, Dentrecasteaux. About seven o'clock in the
evening, we cast anchor in a bottom of blackish mud mixed with
shells, at the depth of 22&frac12; fathoms.</p>
<p>We were in lat. 43&deg; 20' S.; long. 145&deg; 10' E.</p>
<p>The Esperance was apprised of our having cast anchor by a
signal from the main-sail, and did the same at the distance of
about 1,000 toises from us.</p>
<p>The slightest agitation produced a great degree of
phosphorescence in the sea, during the whole night.</p>
<p>Very violent squalls, accompanied with rain, obliged us to pay
out our cable, and unbend our top-gallant gear.</p>
<p>18th. The darkness of the sky kept us impatiently awaiting the
moment when we could enjoy the beautiful prospect of the immense
bay which forms the entrance of Strait Dentrecasteaux. At length
the horizon cleared up. Wherever the eye could reach the coast
was indented with spacious bights in the land, where navigators,
driven by stress of weather, might fly for shelter with security.
We surveyed with astonishment the immense extent of these
harbours, which might easily contain the combined fleet of all
the maritime powers of Europe. The right foreland of the strait
bore S. 43&deg; W.</p>
<p>As the wind abated about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, we
availed ourselves of this opportunity to sit out the pinnace. The
engineer was dispatched in order to examine whether an opening
seen N. 30&deg; E. afforded a passage for our vessels.</p>
<p>The ebb-tide drifted us from eight in the evening till two in
the morning at the rate of half a knot every hour to N.W.N.</p>
<p>The stiffness of the breeze preventing us from sending any of
our boats to the shore, we were obliged to remain on board.</p>
<p>19th. On the following day we were landed at the distance of
2,500 toises S.W. on an island which bounds this channel
throughout its whole length. A boat belonging to the Esperance
had passed the night at the same place, and taken a great
quantity of fish.</p>
<p>It was a great gratification to me to traverse this country,
where I found a large number of new plants, the most numerous of
which belonged to the genus of <i>melaleuca</i>, <i>aster</i>,
<i>epacris</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The shore of the channel afforded us a very easy path through
the bushes which are here but thinly scattered. We afterwards
climbed up some steep ascents which rise to about 25 toises
perpendicular height above the level of the sea. We here observed
a quantity of sea-salt deposited by the waves in the cavities of
the hard freestone which forms the basis. of these hills.</p>
<p>We had scarcely proceeded a thousand toises, when the remains
of a hut and heaps of sea-shells shewed us that this island was
inhabited.</p>
<p>We saw here for the first time the partridge of the Cape of
Van Diemen. We sprung a very large covey of them, which lighted
at a great distance from us.</p>
<p>Late in the evening we met Citizen Riche, who had passed the
night with the fishermen. We gladly accepted his offer to share
the fruits of his fishery with us, and he shewed us a small
spring, where we had the pleasure of refreshing ourselves with
excellent water over a meal of very fine fish and muscles, which
we broiled upon the coals after the manner of the New Hollanders.
After such a repast we had little occasion for the provisions we
had brought with us from the ship.</p>
<p>We were informed that the principal officers of the Recherche
had agitated the question among themselves, whether the gentlemen
engaged in researches of natural history had any right to the
fresh provisions distributed on board, whilst they were employed
upon shore in making the collections which the object of their
appointment required. Care was taken that none of their number
should be admitted to these discussions; and as they had no one
to support their right, the question was soon decided against
them, contrary to every idea of justice. I must add, that though
the persons who had the charge of providing for our table were
frequently changed, they all adhered with the utmost punctuality
to the dictates of this inequitable decree.</p>
<p>It as already night when our boat came to fetch us. Riche was
obliged to avail himself of the opportunity; otherwise he would
have been under the necessity of remaining on shore. He was,
however, compelled to stay for the night on board of the
Recherche, although it was of great consequence to him to return
to the Esperance, as the preparation of the specimens which he
had collected, required to be immediately attended to.</p>
<p>20th. A small island, situated S. 42&deg; W. about 2,500
toises from our anchoring station, had been denominated Partridge
Island by some of our crew who discovered it. Citizen Riche and
myself spent the following day upon the island; but instead of
partridges we found a great number of quails there. Whether those
who had first visited it had taken the one fowl for the other, or
whether the partridges had since left the island, I must leave
undecided.</p>
<p>This small island is upwards of 100 toises in length, and
situated in 43&deg; 23' 30" S. lat. The new species of parsley,
which I had denominated <i>apium prostratum</i>, grew in
abundance, upon the shore, almost as far as high water mark. We
took a great quantity of it on board with us.</p>
<p>Many species of the <i>casuarina</i> grew here, and seemed to
thrive very well notwithstanding the humidity of the soil.
Amongst the plants which I saw for the first time was a
remarkable species of the <i>limodorum</i>, of which I had a
drawing taken; I also collected various kinds of ferns, and a
beautiful species of the <i>glycine</i>, remarkable for its
scarlet flower.</p>
<p>No fresh water is found upon this island; though several
forsaken huts shewed that it had been frequented by the
savages.</p>
<p>Two of the officers of our vessel, Cretin and Dauribeau, went
about six o'clock in the morning to survey the coast to the
eastward of our station, where they found several bays extending
from N.W. to S.E. They observed several creeks, which formed as
many harbours; but a strong contrary wind prevented them from
examining them farther into the land. Seeing several fires at a
small distance from the shore, they determined to land; when as
soon as they had entered the woods, they found four savages
employed in laying fuel upon three small fires, about which they
were sitting. The savages immediately fled, notwithstanding all
the signs of amity which they made them, leaving their crabs and
shell-fish broiling upon coals. Near this place they saw other
fires and huts.</p>
<p>It appears that this spot is much frequented, as fourteen
fire-places were discovered.</p>
<p>One of these savages, who was very tall and muscular, having
left behind him a small basket filled with pieces of flint, was
bold enough to come quite near to Cretin in order to fetch it,
with a look of assurance with which his bodily strength seemed to
inspire him. Some of the savages were stark naked; the rest had
the skin of a kangarou wrapped about their shoulders. They were
of a blackish colour, with long beards and curled hair.</p>
<p>The utensils which they left behind them consisted of about
thirty baskets made of rushes, some of which were filled with
shell-fish and lobsters, others with pieces of flint and
fragments of the bark of a tree as soft as the best tinder. These
savages, undoubtedly, procure themselves fire by striking two
pieces of flint together, in which they differ from the other
inhabitants of the South Sea islands, and even from those of the
more easterly part of New Holland; whence there is ground to
believe that they are descended from a different origin.</p>
<p>They likewise left behind them several kangarou skins and
drinking vessels.</p>
<p>The officers forbade the sailors to take away any of the
utensils of the savages: they, however, selected two baskets, a
kangarou skin, and a drinking vessel of fucus, to carry to the
Commander. The savages had no reason to regret the loss of these
utensils, as they left, in place of them, several knives and
handkerchiefs, with some biscuit, cheese, and an earthen pot,
perhaps too brittle, but certainly a very good substitute for
that which had cost them so little labour to manufacture.</p>
<p>The savages, though they took very few of their utensils with
them, dropped some of them from time to time on their slight.
Whether they might do this in order to be able to run the faster,
or whether it was with a deign to amuse the Europeans who
followed them, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>A boat belonging to the Esperance had been to examine a creek
situated to the eastward, at the distance of about 5,000 toises.
They had met with one of the natives, who, notwithstanding all
the signs of amity they made him, would not let them come within
two hundred paces distance of him. A fine rivulet discharges
itself into the sea near the farthest extremity of the creek. The
situation of this creek, opposite to an island which shelters it
from the surges, renders it an excellent place of shelter for
vessels that stand in need of any repairs.</p>
<p>The other creeks which they examined afforded in general very
good anchorage.</p>
<p>They discovered a bay that extended so far to the north-east,
that they could not get within view of its extremity. Possibly
some of these bights in the land may be parts of channels which
communicate with the sea on the opposite side.</p>
<p>The preparation of the specimens which I had collected on the
preceding days, employed my whole leisure on the 21st.</p>
<p>The gardener went with six other persons in the long boat,
with the view of landing at the island which I had examined on
the preceding day. After having in vain contended with violent
and contrary winds, they left the boat adrift, thinking it would
run into a creek under shelter of a small island, situated at the
entrance of the channel which they had before endeavoured to
reach. But this step was very near proving their ruin; their sail
fell into the sea, and the boat, being suddenly stopped in its
course, soon began to be filled with water by the violence of the
surge. At length they arrived, overcome with fatigue, under the
shelter of the island, where the calm that prevailed afforded
them a pleasing respite from their toils and dangers. The
Commander, anxious about their fate, sent a boat in the afternoon
in quest of them, as he knew that whilst the wind remained so
unfavourable, the long boat could not return to the ship without
assistance. Towards close of evening, we had the satisfaction of
seeing them return on board. They told us that having proceeded
along; the coast in a S.S.E. direction, they found by some fires
that the savages were near; that they had soon met with several
of them, who were the same that had been seen the day before, but
that the did not suffer them to approach them. They found some
shell-fish broiling upon the fires which the savages had left
with precipitation, and more than thirty kangarou skins which
they found at a little distance, shewed them to be very expert in
hunting.</p>
<p>It appeared that they had made use of the bread and water,
which had been left for them on the preceding day; but the smell
of the cheese had probably given them no inclination to taste it;
as it was found in the same condition in which it had been
deposited. They found at the same place one of the knives and
handkerchiefs that had been left among the utensils of the
natives.</p>
<p>Some shots that were fired at birds, probably terrified these
savages; for when some of our men went to the same place two days
afterwards, they saw none of them.</p>
<p>22d. The boats were sent to take in water at a creek that had
lately been discovered to the eastward. I availed myself of the
opportunity to visit this place, which was situated at the
distance of about 5,000 toises from our anchoring station. It
forms a harbour, about 150 toises in breadth and 500 in length,
with sufficient bottom for large vessels to ride at anchor in it.
A rivulet that discharges itself into it near its extremity,
affords very good water, which, however, was not easily taken in
by the boats, since, in order to have it perfectly pure, it was
necessary to roll the barrels from the distance of more than 160
toises over the muddy bottom. Our men might have been spared this
unhealthy labour, if pipes of leather or of sail-cloth, smeared
over with tar, had been employed, by which the water might easily
have been conveyed into the boats. The advantages of such a
practice will particularly be apparent in cases where the
impracticability of entering a rivulet with the boats obliges
mariners to take in brackish water; whereas, by means of a pipe
carried a few hundred yards higher up the stream, they might
procure it without any admixture of sea-water, which renders it
very unwholesome to drink.</p>
<p>The banks of this rivulet produced several new species of
<i>casuarina</i>, one of which was remarkable for the club-like
form of its fruit. I also observed a pretty tall shrub, which
establishes a new genus of the cruciferous tribe.</p>
<p>The tracks of the kangarous were very numerous, terminating at
the rivulet, where these animals frequently come to drink.</p>
<p>As the wind had been against us when we sailed for this
watering place, we had a right to expect that it would be
favourable to our return; but a calm supervened, and it lasted
several hours before we reached the ships.</p>
<p>The pinnace returned after a voyage of four days, in which the
whole extent of the strait had been surveyed. It is about 20,000
toises in length from S.W. to N.E. They had every where found a
depth of at least six fathoms and an half, over a bottom of mild,
and sometimes of fine sand, it is separated from Adventure-bay by
a narrow slip of land, not more than 200 toises at its greatest
breadth.</p>
<p>We now waited only for a favourable wind to follow the strait,
in order to take an exact survey of it. The N. and N.W. breezes
were contrary, and, besides, so slight, that we were obliged to
remain the whole day at anchor.</p>
<p>During the night we saw several fires of the natives to
S.E.</p>
<p>24th. On the following morning we weighed anchor, and plied to
windward. at the distance of about 500 toises from the land. We
found every where a depth of water of at least 6&frac12; fathoms,
over a very good bottom.</p>
<p>Though the thermometer had never indicated more than 7&deg;
above the point of congelation, even in the coldest mornings, the
snows had greatly increased upon the high mountains seen
W.N.W.</p>
<p>Whilst the currents continued favourable we gained ground at
every tack; but about six o'clock in the evening they became
contrary; and we cast anchor in a bottom of grey sand at the
depth of eight fathoms, very near to the coast, and to the
northward of the station from whence we had sailed in the
morning.</p>
<p>The natives kindled more than twenty fires upon the coast
towards the south. Many families of them had probably come down
to the coast upon hearing the news of our being in the bay.</p>
<p>25th. About seven in the morning the current was favourable,
and we made several tacks in order to enter a narrower part of
the channel, where we ranged very near to the west coast,
steering N.E.N.</p>
<p>Having proceeded about 2,500 toises along this channel, we
entered a second bay upwards of 5,000 toises in length, and
bounded to the west by pretty high grounds; the eastern coast,
which separates this strait from Adventure-bay, was less
elevated.</p>
<p>About half an hour after one in the afternoon, we cast anchor
at the distance of 200 toises from the shore; Cape Canel&eacute;
bearing S. 33&deg; E.</p>
<p>I went on shore to north-west, where I found the woods very
full of thickets, and extremely damp, though no rain had fallen
for several days. A new species of <i>ptelea</i> grew in great
abundance amongst the shrubs with which this country was
covered.</p>
<p>26th. We weighed anchor about seven in the morning, and found
ourselves, at noon, in a third bay, where the great number of
openings in the land left us for some time doubtful what course
we should steer, in order to get out of it, which we at length
accomplished, to north-west, by the most distant of the openings.
The depth of water in this bay was not less than eleven fathoms
about the middle, and at least six and a half at the distance of
a hundred toises from the shore.</p>
<p>Having proceeded almost 10,000 toises to N.N.W., we anchored
about half an hour after three in the afternoon, in a depth of
fourteen fathoms and a half, with a muddy bottom, as it was
probable that, in case the wind should become favourable, we
might proceed on our course before night; none of us, went on
shore.</p>
<p>On the 27th, about eight o'clock in the morning, we weighed
anchor. The current soon set against us, and obliged us to cast
anchor at the depth of twelve fathoms and a half, in a bottom of
sand mixed with mud. We were then in 43&deg; 4' S. lat. 145&deg;
17' E. long.</p>
<p>At the distance of two thousand five hundred toises to
north-east, the farthest end of the strait through which we were
to pass, was visible.</p>
<p>A fire at a small distance from the shore apprised us of the
natives being near. We soon after observed one of them walking
along the shore.</p>
<p>Two boats were sent out to transport some of our men to both
shores of the straits. They discovered a number of the savages
landing from a raft on the east shore. As timid as those we had
seen before, they had hastened with all possible speed to the
land, where they made their escape into the woods, leaving behind
them several darts of a very clumsy construction.</p>
<p>I went on shore at the place where the foliages had
disappeared, and found several pieces of very beautiful hard
granite, rounded by the water.</p>
<p>We found four rafts, made of the bark of trees, on the beach.
These rafts are only fit for crossing the water when the sea is
very tranquil; otherwise they would soon be broken asunder by the
force of the waves. As the savages possess the art of hollowing
the trunks of trees by means of fire, they might employ the same
method to make themselves canoes; but the art of navigation has
made as little progress amongst them as the rest.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the extremity of the strait, found some fine
crystals of feld-spath in several rocks of very hard sand
stone.</p>
<p>On the tops of the hills I met with the plant described by
Phillip, in his account of his voyage to Botany Bay, under the
name of the yellow gum-tree. As it was already in seed, I had no
opportunity of examining the characters requisite for determining
its genus. To me it appears to belong to that of
<i>drac&aelig;na</i>. The grains were contained in long ears,
filled with a vast number of larv&aelig;, which are afterwards
metamorphosed into small phalen&aelig; of the moth kind.</p>
<p>The gum-resin which flows from this plant is very astringent,
and might, no doubt, be used with advantage in medicine. The
gummy principle with which it abounds, renders it more apt to mix
with the fluids of the human body, and ought to give it a
preference before many other astringents that are employed.</p>
<p>Amongst a variety of other beautiful plants, I found a very
remarkable one of the composite tribe; which had never before
been discovered. It constitutes a new genus, which I named
<i>richea</i>, after Citizen Riche, one of the naturalists to our
expedition. This philosopher fell a victim to his love for
science, having made, when already in a very advanced stage of
consumption, a long and fatiguing journey, in which he had more
consulted his scientific zeal than the state of his health.</p>
<p>This new genus naturally ranks in the third section of the
cynarocephales. (Juss. gen. plant.)</p>
<p>The common calix is composed of several obtuse foliol&aelig;,
scarious at their extremities, of equal length, and disposed in a
single row; it incloses several distinct calices, each of which
is supported by a very short peduncle. Each of the small calices
is composed of five or six foliol&aelig;, and contains five or
six floriol&aelig;; all hermaphrodite, and provided with sheaths
of nearly the same length with themselves.</p>
<p>The floriol&aelig; are inflated at their superior extremity,
and divided into five equal divisions.</p>
<p>Five distinct filaments, attached to the inside of the
corolla, support the same number of anther, united in the form of
a cylinder.</p>
<p>The style is filiform, and of an equal height with the
stamina. The stigma is bipartite.</p>
<p>The seed is oval, covered with a light down, and has at the
top twelve or fourteen hairy tufts.</p>
<p>On account of the colour of the leaves of this plant I have
called it <i>richea glauca</i>. The flower is of a brimstone
yellow colour.</p>

<p>One of the officers of the Recherche, following a beaten path
made by the savages through the woods, met six of them walking
slowly towards the south, who were all stark-naked, and armed
with javelins sixteen or eighteen feet in length. Their surprise
at so unexpected a rencounter was visible in their countenances;
but their number inspiring them with courage, they approached at
the invitations of the European, and bound round their heads a
handkerchief and neck-cloth which he offered them. They, however,
appeared terrified at the sight of his hanger, which he shewed
them how to use; nor were their fears quieted till he made them a
present of it. He endeavoured in vain to persuade them to come to
the place where our ships lay at anchor: the savages walked away,
following the same path in a direction opposite to that which led
to the shore.</p>
<p>Some of our men having landed on the other side of the strait,
came to a large fire, round which eight savages, each of whom had
a kangarou skin wrapped round his shoulders, sat warming
themselves under the shelter of four fences against the wind.
They immediately ran away as soon as they saw our people.</p>
<p>An old woman who had the care of their provisions, which the
did not choose to leave behind her, was soon overtaken by some of
the sailors. She accepted with an air of satisfaction, an
handkerchief that was given her, but was so terrified at the
sight of a hanger, which they presented to her, that the leapt
down a precipice more than forty feet in height, and ran away
amongst the rocks, where they soon lost sight of her.</p>
<p>I do not know whether those who related this adventure in a
different manner, wished to make themselves merry at the expence
of the rest, when they asserted that the age of this woman was no
security for her against the attempts of some of the sailors;
however, she was still young enough to make her escape, leaving
behind her two baskets, in which were found a lobster, some
muscles, and a few roots of a fern, which I recognised to belong
to a new species of <i>pteris</i>, of which I had before
collected a considerable quantity. Probably the savages chew
these roots, in order to express the nutritious juice, which
always abounds more or less in plants of this species.</p>
<p>This woman, like the other savages, had the skin of a kangarou
wrapped about her shoulders. She had likewise another of these
skins bound round her waist in the form of an apron. I suppose
that she had provided herself with this piece of clothing, more
on account of the inclemency of the season, than from a principle
of modesty; for those of the savage women who were seen at
Adventure-bay by Captain, Cook, at a distance of not many hundred
toises from this place, were stark naked; and it is not probable
that there should be much difference of manners between the
natives of two countries so near to each other.</p>
<p>28th. A wind from the north blew in such violent squalls
during the night, that the Esperance was set adrift, though the
held by a very large anchor.</p>
<p>We had spent more time in surveying the strait of
Dentrecasteaux than we had intended. Before we could reach the
main sea we had still a passage of 2,500 toises to make through
the channel. The wind was contrary, but the tide favourable; so
that we got under way about half an hour after nine in the
morning. We often came within 150 toises of the coast, where the
soundings gave us our depth at 12 or 15 fathoms, in places where
the coast was high, and 6 or 6&frac12; fathoms near the low
grounds.</p>
<p>At length we reached the extremity of the strait. The two
forelands are at the distance of 2,500 toises from one another
from S.E. to N.W. We ranged very near to that on our starboard
side, where we found the depth to be no more than 3&frac12; or 4
fathoms. Such a great diminution of water at the termination of
the strait, led us to conjecture that the bottom consisted of a
hard rock that resisted the daily action of the tides, and the
soundings verified our supposition. This was the only bad bottom
which we found throughout the whole extent of the strait. We left
it about noon; when we discovered an opening E.S.E. about 5,000
toises in breadth, which affords a passage into the main sea.</p>
<p>To the northward we observed a vast bay, or rather a gulph,
intercepted with islands, and connected with the main land, which
we saw at a distance. Several bights in the land that incloses
the gulph, seemed likely to afford good anchorage.</p>

<p>WE had now compleated a geographical discovery of great
importance to navigation. It was a point of the greatest utility
to know exactly the harbours in which ships might find shelter
from the heavy gales and impetuous storms, which prevail at this
extremity of New Holland. A road, which is not less than 22,000
toises in extent, in that particular situation, might present
great advantages to a commercial nation. Throughout the whole
road, a ship may cast anchor with the certainty of finding a good
bottom, the depth being from 6 to 25 fathoms, and no danger to be
dreaded. At an equal distance between its two extremities, the
bottom is of coarse sand, and not so good. There is also less
water, as the depth there does not exceed six fathoms. It should
seem that the tide entering at once by both extremities had
accumulated the sand, at the place where the opposite currents
meet. A ship may, without danger, come within 100 toises of the
land. The sinuosities of the land present a varied prospect, and
situations truly picturesque.</p>
<p>The season was advanced and the thermometer had not yet been
lower than 7&deg; above 0, although we were near the 44th degree
of S. lat. Impetuous, winds reigned in the open sea, while in the
strait, we enjoyed the greatest tranquillity. We did not expect
to experience so much security near the Bay of Tempests.</p>
<p>Fishes which prefer tranquil waters, abound in this channel,
and we were generally very fortunate in catching them.</p>
<p>Scarcely had we passed the strait, to the distance of 1,500
toises when we could no longer distinguish the opening. The depth
increased, as we advanced into the open sea.</p>
<p>At noon, our latitude was 43&deg; 1' S. and our longitude
145&deg; 19' E.</p>
<p>We were not long in doubling Cape Pillar, and we immediately
steered a north-east course, in order that we might explore the
south-west coast of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>The mercury in the barometer sunk into 27 inches 8 lines, and
we had a violent gale from the N.W. The motion of the ship was to
me as sickening as at our departure from Brest. During our stay
at Cape Diemen, had completely forgotten my sailing habits.</p>
<p>On the 30th of May we had made great progress 5 for at noon,
our latitude was 40&deg; 55' S. and our longitude 150&deg; 4'
E.</p>
<p>The Mercury in the barometer had fallen to 27 inches 4 lines,
and had not deceived us in announcing impetuous winds. We could
only scud under our fore-sail, which at last we were obliged to
strike, but fortunately we had the wind astern.</p>
<p>Although the thermometer was not lower than 9&deg; 2-10ths
above 0, the cold was nevertheless great. The violent agitation
of the air appeared to me the principal cause of the sensation
which we experienced.</p>
<p>On the first of June, having arrived in latitude 37&deg; 17'
S. and longitude 154&deg; 5' E., we saw a great number of
speckled petrels (<i>procellaria capensis</i>) and many
albatrosses remarkable for the red extremities of their
wings.</p>
<p>2d. The next day many flying fishes, of the same species with
those which we had so often met with elsewhere, falling on board
of us, announced our arrival in parts of the sea frequented by
bonitoes.</p>
<p>The motion of the ship, since out departure, had made me so
faint, that I found myself absolutely incapable of taking the
measures necessary for the preservation of the objects which I
had collected in my last excursions.</p>
<p>3d. But this day the sea became more calm, and allowed me to
enter upon that business. My specimens had suffered no damage;
only I found them slightly covered with moisture.</p>
<p>5th. Since our departure from New Holland, we had been reduced
to short allowance of water; and the heat, which, now began to be
very sensibly felt, rendered that privation the more painful. We
were allowed but a bottle in the day; although our want of it
increased as we approached the Torrid Zone. For this beverage we
could not substitute wine, which became daily work, and brandy,
which many preferred to wine, rendered a greater quantity of
water necessary. Salted provisions increased a thirst, which we
had not the means of quenching, and the great quantity of
sea-salt introduced into our fluids, had communicated to them a
great degree of acrimony. Thus the privation of fresh water is
one of the principal causes of the diseases of seamen.</p>
<p>Spotted petrels and many other birds which we saw on the 6th
of June, in latitude 34&deg; 47' S., and longitude 159&deg; 21'
E., made us suppose that we were approaching some land, still too
distant to be seen.</p>
<p>11th. About the middle of this day, we thought we saw land at
east. After steering in that direction for an hour, the phantom
disappeared, ad we resumed our course.</p>
<p>15th. We shot a man-of-war bird, which was hovering over the
ship. This bird had in its bill one of the species of cuttle fish
called <i>sepia loligo</i>. It had probably caught this mollusca,
the instant before it received the fatal stroke. In the
Mediterranean, I have seen this species of cuttle fish raise
itself many feet above the surface of the water, by means of
membranous expansions, situated laterally near its lower
extremity; some of them even dropped on board of us.</p>
<p>16th. About half an hour past five in the morning, we entered
the Torrid Zone, in 65&deg; of E. longitude.</p>
<p>About eight we saw the Isle of Pines, which is at a little
distance from the southern point of New Caledonia. It had the
appearance of a peak of moderate elevation; and we soon had a
view of the low lands, with which it is every where surrounded.
We distinguished large trees, towards the south-east part of the
island. Its position, which we determined, is in S. lat. 22&deg;
42', and E. long. 165&deg; 14', which is but 4' less in lat. and
4' more in long. than its position, as assigned by Captain
Cook.</p>
<p>About five in the evening, we had sight of New Caledonia in
the N.W., distant above twenty thousand toises, and we steered
towards it; but about sun-set, we were obliged to lay to for the
Esperance, which always sailed much worse than our ship. We then
had a view of the coast, from 32&deg; to the northward of west,
to 32&deg; to the westward of north; but we were still too far
distant to see the reefs, between that island and the Isle of
Pines. The Esperance joined us about eight at night. It was
proper for us to make many tacks during the night, but it was so
calm that the ship did not obey her helm.</p>
<p>A south-west wind brought us near New Caledonia; although we
expected to meet with the winds, which generally prevailed
several days before we made the land.</p>
<p>The small change of variation which the compass had undergone,
during the transit which we had made, is very well worthy of
remark. We may look upon it as nothing, from south latitude
36&deg; 30', and east longitude 154&deg;, where the variation was
11&deg; 30' east, to south latitude 23&deg;, and east longitude
164&deg; 30', where the variation was 11&deg; 4'; for in this run
of 13&deg; 30' of latitude, and 10&deg; 30' of longitude, the
compass did not vary a degree; and it is well known that, at sea,
the variation cannot be observed nearer than within a degree of
the truth.</p>
<p>17th. A fire kindled by the savages, on the Isle of Pines, was
seen during the night.</p>
<p>At break of day, we observed immense reefs on the coast of New
Caledonia, stretching first towards the south, and then towards
the west. The calm confined us, the whole morning, between those
dangerous rocks and the Isle of Pines; but in the afternoon, a
slight breeze from. the south-west, enabled us to keep clear of
the breakers.</p>
<p>At noon, our latitude was 22&deg; 49' S., and our longitude
164&deg; 40' E.; the southern point of New Caledonia then hearing
N.N.E., distant about 20,000 toises. This extremity of that
island is in 22&deg; 30' S. lat. and 164&deg; 31' E.
longitude.</p>
<p>18th. We had lost sight of the chain of reefs, but about
eleven o'clock we perceived their southern extremity, at the
distance of about 10,000 toises N.W.W. Their small distance from
our ship at noon, when we observed our latitude, convinced us
that they extended some minutes farther to the southward than
Captain Cook believed; for we saw that they reached 23&deg; of S.
lat., and 164&deg; 31' of E. longitude.</p>
<p>Those reefs, to which we approached nearer than the distance
of 1,000 toises, are nearly 20,000 toises from the coast, and in
that space keep the sea very tranquil; we were obliged to make
several tacks in order to get out of it.</p>
<p>19th. We made little way in the morning of this day; for at
noon, in 23&deg; 3' 43" of S. lat., and 164&deg; 8' 20" of E.
long, we were still in sight of the western extremity of the
reefs, which bore N.W.&frac14;N. at the distance of about 10,000
toises. We brought the Cape to bear N.W.&frac14;W. in order to
double it, and to approach near the coast.</p>
<p>We kept tacking, chiefly under our top-sails, during the whole
night, endeavouring to keep company with our consort. It was
necessary that we should be able, mutually, to communicate the
dangers to which we might be exposed, on a coast bordered with
shelves and rocks, hitherto unexplored by navigators.</p>
<p>20th. During the night, the currents brought us back to the
reefs which we believed we had doubled. We stood towards the
land, when daylight fortunately showed us all the danger of our
situation. We were surrounded with reefs, and had but little room
to beat about. The wind at south-south east, freshened and
increased the waves, which were Carrying us towards the breakers;
and we were in the midst of the danger, when the Esperance
pointed it out to us by a signal. Rossel then commanded on the
quarter-deck. Immediately we trimmed up the sails on the
starboard tack, in order to extricate her from this dangerous
position. The Esperance had succeeded in this man&oelig;uvre, and
we had the pleasure to see her clear of the danger, and standing
towards the west.</p>
<p>Our bell was now rung to summon all hands on deck, in order to
be more sure of success. Four times did Rossel fail in his
man&oelig;uvre, and every attempt did but bring us nearer to the
danger. We were driving towards the reefs, where the waves, ready
to ingulph us, rose to a prodigious height. We could not cast
anchor; for no bottom was to be found with fifty fathoms of line,
although we were close to the rocks. Each of us was looking
eagerly for the means of escaping death, which seemed almost
inevitable. At last the ship touched, when, by unexpected good
fortune, the fifth attempt succeeded, and we had the unspeakable
satisfaction of seeing the ship remove from the danger.</p>
<p>Between the reefs and the land were some little islands,
distant above 5,000 toises from the coast.</p>
<p>The land of New Caledonia, which was low towards its southern
extremity, now began to rise into mountains of moderate
elevation, in a south-east and north-west direction, inclining a
little farther towards the north.</p>
<p>When, at the approach of night, we were going about, the
top-men had forgotten to change the booms of the main-yard, and
the mizen top-sail yard; and they were both broken, the moment we
went upon the other tack. The first fell overboard; but the
other, in its fall, wounded three people, among whom was the
Commander of the expedition.</p>
<p>21st. We stood out to sea, and there remained during the
night, and in the morning we steered for the land. A wind at
south-east carried us to the north-west, at the distance of seven
hundred toises, from the reefs, which deny all access to the
shore, whence they are distant by about 2,500 toises. We expected
to find some opening which would allow, us to anchor under the
shelter of this barrier, against which the waves dashed in a
dreadful manner.</p>
<p>A considerable body of smoke which rose at the foot of the
hill, at a little distance from the shore, indicated the presence
of the natives.</p>
<p>From noon, when we found the latitude 22&deg; 6' 58" south,
and the longitude 163&deg; 34' 36" east, we had proceeded nearly
10,000 toises to the north-west, when we observed, between two
reefs a large opening, which seemed likely to afford us an
entrance to an anchoring place near the shore. But unfortunately
the day was too far gone, and the sea too much agitated, to allow
us to send a boat to sound this entrance. We regretted much that
we were precluded from enjoying the calm which prevailed behind
this rampart, against which the waves made unavailing
efforts.</p>
<p>Hills, almost wholly denuded of vegetation, rose like an
amphitheatre towards the principal chain of mountains, which
appeared to be, at least, nine hundred toises in perpendicular
height, and their direction still towards the north-west. We
there found three ranges of mountains of different degrees of
elevation, and we observed hollows, apparently formed by the fall
of the rains, and which were continued to the summits of the most
arid mountains.</p>
<p>Behind those high mountains, we saw perhaps 20,000 toises
within the land, which towered above all the rest, and appeared
to be, at least, 1,200 toises in perpendicular elevation.</p>
<p>From the middle of one of those ravines, or hollows, issued a
torrent which we distinguished perfectly by the whiteness of its
foaming waters; although we were very distant from it.</p>
<p>The cold on those heights, undoubtedly render it necessary for
the natives to warm themselves. We saw many large fires, which
they had kindled, while we beat about the offing in the
night.</p>
<p>22d. On account of the faintness of the breeze, we could not
make the reefs till noon, when we found ourselves in 21&deg; 51'
south lat. and 163&deg; 8' east long. We steered along the reefs
till night, without finding the least opening.</p>
<p>New Caledonia presents a more charming appearance than the old
country of that name; for we saw some trees growing in the
bottoms of the ravines with which those hills are furrowed.</p>
<p>A fire kindled on shore, indicated that those arid tracts of
land are not wholly destitute of inhabitants. It was not long
before we saw some of them.</p>
<p>The wind having varied from the north-east to the north and
north-west, we brought to, about ten at night. This was not,
perhaps, the most prudent man&oelig;uvre in our situation; for
when danger is near, we should always be prepared to avoid it. It
would certainly have been preferable to have kept tacking, in
order that we might be able to man&oelig;uvre conveniently, in
case any troublesome incidents had occurred.</p>
<p>23d. We were baffled by the winds all night, and at noon, were
only in lat. 21&deg; 37' S., and long. 162&deg; 47' E.</p>
<p>We saw some mountains which were covered with trees to the
summits.</p>
<p>The fires which we observed near the shore, indicated a great
concourse of savages. They were probably brought together by the
appearance of our ship, which was detained by contrary winds,
almost in the same place.</p>
<p>About three o'clock, being about the distance of 35,000 toises
from the land, we observed, near the beach, a group of twelve
Caledonians, whose looks were directed towards us, and who seemed
to be astonished at seeing our ship, at so small a distance from
their island.</p>
<p>Three natives who formed another group, stood very near two
fires, which they had kindled.</p>
<p>By the help of a good spy-glass, we saw that they were
entirely naked. They did not seem inclined to come off to us in
their canoes. Besides, the reefs rendered it impossible for them
to reach our ship.</p>
<p>24th. A strong breeze at south-west obliged us to tack; and we
found ourselves almost at the same place as on the preceding day.
The land was covered with a fog, which had always accompanied
south-west winds.</p>
<p>We found the ship to be in 21&deg; 46' of south latitude, and
162&deg; 46' of east longitude, when we thought we saw between
the reefs an opening which might afford us a passage; but how
could we ascertain that fact, when the wind was blowing so strong
a gale?</p>
<p>25th. As soon as the wind shifted to the south, the fog was
entirely dissipated. The winds which brought the cold into those
latitudes, forced the air, when the sun was withdrawn, to part
with the redundant water, which it had held in solution during
the day. Hence some large drops of very cold water then fell, at
a great distance from each other.</p>
<p>For the two last days, we had made no considerable advances,
in exploring the coast, where we had seen many fires, kindled
perhaps by the same natives as on the preceding days.</p>
<p>26th, 27th, 28th. We had also to struggle with contrary winds,
during the two succeeding days; but, on the 28th, a fresh breeze
at south-east, savoured our views in stretching along the coast.
The high mountains, which we had hitherto seen, were exchanged
for some of a much lower elevation, and at last we thought we had
reached the end of the chain; but farther on, they resumed nearly
the same height, and we saw the northern extremity of the island,
formed of lofty mountains, which, at that distance, did not
appear to differ from those which we had braved on the preceding
days.</p>
<p>At noon, our latitude was 20&deg; 28' south, and our longitude
161&deg; 29' east, and we were not backward in observing, that
near the extremity of the island, the chain of reefs was
interrupted, and presented a large opening, which seemed likely
to afford us an anchoring place; but the wind blew too strong to
allow us to put out a boat, in order to take the soundings in
this opening. We lay to all night, in hopes that the weather
would be more favourable the next day.</p>
<p>In the direction of the land of New Caledonia, we observed
several islands surrounded with reefs, and connected together by
sand banks and other shoals.</p>
<p>29th. During the night, the wind had made us fall off so much,
that we lost sight of the northern extremity of New Caledonia,
which we found to be in 19&deg; 58' south latitude, and 161&deg;
10' east longitude. That island presents a chain of mountains,
extending about eighty nautical leagues, from the south-east to
the north-west. Its mean breadth is not more than seven or eight
leagues. Captain Cook, who discovered it in 1772, only saw the
north-east part of it. The examination of the south-west coast of
the island was an important object in navigation. The reefs by
which it is bordered, are generally from 25 to 30,000 toises
distant from the land, and towards their extremities this
distance is greater, but they are not so broad. That coast,
extremely dangerous at all times, is rendered still more so by
the south-west winds, which were remarkably adverse to us, in
exploring it.</p>
<p>The small number of fires which we observed, and the apparent
sterility of the land, gave me a good reason to believe that the
island was but thinly inhabited.</p>
<p>We did not see a single canoe, although they might have been
managed with facility, under the shelter of the reefs, where the
sea is extremely tranquil.</p>
<p>About seven o'clock in the morning, we came in sight of many
mountainous islands and detached rocks, stretching from N.N.E. to
E.N.E. and which render this extremity of New Caledonia still
more dangerous than the southern part. Some of those islands are
several hundred toises in extent. The points of a great number of
black rocks were elevated above the water. Those rocks,
surrounded by water slightly agitated, seemed themselves to be in
motion, and, at first sight, we took them for canoes, floating on
the surface. We soon discovered that those little islands were
numerous; for they extended as far as we could see from the mast
head. They are encircled with reefs, amidst which the sea assumes
the colour of the reddish sand which composes its bottom. We had
a near view of them; for, about eleven o'clock, we were but about
1,500 toises to the southward of one of those little islands,
when we observed reefs extending from its western point, in the
direction of W.N.W. as far as the eye could reach.</p>
<p>At the place, where we found our latitude at noon to be
20&deg; 6' 4" south, our longitude being 161&deg; 10' 36" east,
we had on the east 22&deg; north, a little island, distant 1,000
toises.</p>
<p>Another island bore from us north 80 degrees west, at the
distance of about 8,000 toises. Those two islands were connected
together by reefs.</p>
<p>We saw other lands, bearing north 28&deg; east.</p>
<p>A fire, on the little island nearest us, not far from a
rivulet descending from a mountain, indicated that those little
spots of land were frequented by the natives.</p>
<p>The strong gusts of wind which blew in the night, would have
greatly embarrassed us in any other situation; but, under shelter
of the islands and reefs, it was easy for us to beat about during
the night.</p>
<p>June 30. Some little islands towards the east, seemed to
terminate this little archipelago. Their elevation gradually
diminished, in proportion to their distance from New Caledonia.
They seemed indeed to be only a continuation of the mountains of
that large island; their bases being covered by the sea, and
their summits rising above it, and forming so many little
islands. The gradual diminution of the height of those mountains,
makes it reasonable to suppose that in those seas, shoals
extending to a great distance, contribute to augment the dangers
of navigation. In the sequel, we shall see that this supposition
is by no means destitute of foundation.</p>
<p>We directed our course to the north-west, very near the reefs,
which precluded our access to the little islands.</p>
<p>The Commander informed the captain of the Esperance, that in
case of separation, the two ships should rendezvous at port
Pralin or Carteret harbour.</p>
<p>Our latitude at noon was 19&deg; 28' 10" south, and our
longitude 160&deg; 36' 12" east; the most northerly of the little
islands bearing east, at the distance of 8,000 toises.</p>
<p>We came in sight of a chain of reefs, which extended as far as
the eye could reach, towards N.W.&frac12;N. in some places
forming bights, by taking a westerly direction. With the wind at
E.S.E. it was easy for us to follow all the windings of those
reefs. In the afternoon, we steered parallel to them for nearly
20,000 toises and then thought that we saw their extremity. We
were already felicitating ourselves with having terminated this
dangerous and troublesome navigation, and entering into an open
sea, when the watch announced shoals and a succession of reefs,
in the direction of N.N.W. It was now too late in the day to
intangle ourselves among them, and we worked to windward during
the night.</p>
<p>A booby, of the species <i>pelecanus varius</i>, allowed
itself to be caught about sun-set. It differed from the ordinary
species, by having a lighter colour. This bird came, without
distrust, and sat down on the round top, beside one of the
sailors. The species is remarkable for being but little afraid of
man; they will even frequently light on one's arm, when presented
to them. Their sense of smelling must not be very subtile; for
their nostrils consist of but two slight chinks in the upper
mandible, which is moveable like that of the parrot.</p>
<p>JULY 1st. We now believed that we had compleated the survey of
this frightful chain of reefs, which obstructs the sea for near
100 marine leagues from the S.E. to the N.W.; and we were 10,000
toises to the northward of them, about noon, when we found
ourselves in 18&deg; 50' of south latitude, and 160&deg; 32' of
east longitude.</p>
<p>We next steered towards the N.N.E. in order to ascertain
whether or not those reefs extended to the north-east.</p>
<p>One of the crew, called Moulin, about two o'clock in the
afternoon, discovered to the northward, at the distance of 10,000
toises, a little low island covered with very tufted trees, and
bordered towards its western side, with reefs, extending towards
W.N.W. This island, which is not above 2,500 toises in
circumference, is situated in 18&deg; 31' 10" of south latitude,
and in 160&deg; 32' 14" of east longitude.</p>
<p>Agreeable to the promise of the General, this island was
called Moulin's Island, after the man who first observed it.</p>
<p>About four o'clock two other little islands were descried
towards N.W.&frac14;N. distant about 8,000 toises. As it was
impossible for us to pass those islands before night, at five
o'clock we directed our course to the S.S.E. and we kept the
ship's head that way till the morning.</p>
<p>We were surrounded during the night with flocks of birds,
which inhabited those low islands. Notwithstanding the darkness,
the man-of-war birds came and hovered over our ship, and several
boobies alighted upon our yards.</p>
<p>2d. The Commander had intended to anchor under the shelter of
Moulin's Island; but we found ourselves carried above 5,000
toises to leeward, and it would have been extremely difficult to
work up to windward against both wind and current. We therefore
steered N.N.E. and it was not long till we observed, towards the
north, breakers not far from the two little islands, which we had
observed the preceding day. We steered parallel to them, at the
distance of about 1,000 toises and in their direction, which was
towards the north-west.</p>
<p>From the point where we observed our latitude at noon, which
was 18&deg; 7' 46" south, our longitude being 166&deg; 32' east,
we saw the nearest reefs, at the distance of near 10,000 toises
to the eastward. We continued to steer along them, in the
direction of N.W.N.</p>
<p>About a quarter past one o'clock, we discovered, at the
distance of nearly 8,000 toises towards the east, a low and very
woody island, which appeared to us to be at the least 8,000
toises in circumference; and it was surrounded with rocks almost
level with the water. Having the wind against us, we steered very
near it; the breakers extended towards the north-east to the
estimated distance of about 8,000 toises, and in the midst of
those reefs, we saw black pointed rocks, similar to those which
we had observed before.</p>
<p>This new island is in latitude 18&deg; 3' south, and in
longitude 160&deg; 31' east.</p>
<p>We steered towards the north, and about four in the afternoon,
we had the last of those rocks to the eastward of us, at the
estimated distance of 8,000 toises. There those reefs seemed to
terminate; appearing to extend towards the east, and then
toward's the south. Their northern extremity is in 17&deg; 54' of
south latitude, and 160&deg; 30' of east longitude, and about ten
leagues to the north of Moulin's Island.</p>
<p>It was easy for us to perceive, by the force of the waves,
that we were disengaged from the reefs.</p>
<p>A great number of tropical birds, boobies and man-of-war
birds, quitting, their retreats in the different little islands,
came and played in airy circles about the ship, almost the whole
day. We saw the trunks of several cocoa-nut trees floating, which
had been torn by the waves from the place of their growth.</p>
<p>About six in the evening, the lead indicated fifty-eight
fathoms depth of water, with a bottom of fine sand, our latitude
having then been 17&deg; 51' south, and our longitude, 160&deg;
18' east. We remained an hour upon that bank, where we hove the
lead several times, and had from fifty to sixty-six fathoms in
depth.</p>
<p>Thus we completed the discovery of a dreadful chain of reefs,
so much the more dangerous towards the north, as they are wholly
out of sight of land. Although they appeared to us interrupted,
to the northward of New Caledonia, it is probable,
notwithstanding what we observed, that they are re-united farther
to the eastward.</p>
<p>Those reefs, are well known to be the work of <i>polypi</i>;
and the danger attending them is the more to be dreaded, as they
form steep rocks covered by the water, and which can only be
perceived at a small distance, is a calm take place, and a ship
be carried towards them by the currents, her loss is almost
inevitable. Vain would be the attempt to save her by the anchor,
for it would not reach the bottom, even close to those walls of
coral, which rise perpendicularly from the depths of the sea.
These works of the polypus, which, by continually increasing,
obstruct more and more the bed of the ocean, may well be
supposed, dreadful to navigators; and many shoals which now allow
a vessel to pals over them, will, at no very distant period; be
converted into reefs extremely dangerous to ships.</p>
<p>The compass experienced but little variation, while we were
cruizing along this immense chain of rocks; for at their southern
extremity, it was observed, to be 11&deg; easterly, and it was
diminished only two degrees, when we had reached their northern
extremity.</p>
<p>3d. The next day we steered N.N.W.; but we saw no more
breakers.</p>
<p>7th. At half past nine p.m. the moon being elevated about
15&deg; above the eastern part of the horizon, we observed, in
the west, a lunar rainbow. It differed in nothing from the solar
rainbow, except that its colours were not so vivid. This
ph&oelig;nomenon is much less frequent than might naturally be
expected.</p>
<p>The allowance of water was very small, which was a prodigious
hardship in latitudes so near the Line; and we had not the means
of procuring more; although we were provided with Doctor
Poissonnier's apparatus for distilling sea-water. This
contrivance was of no use to us, as it required much more fuel
than we could spare; for when water is scare on board ship, wood
is never abundant.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock a.m. we descried the Arsacides, which we
made near Cape Nepean. Those lands, discovered in 1767, by
Captain Surville, in the service of the former French East India
Company, were since seen by Shortland, who, thinking he had made
a new discovery, gave them the name of New Georgia.</p>
<p>Our latitude at noon was 8&deg; 52' south, and our longitude
154&deg; 38' east., The nearest land then bore E.&frac14;N.E.
distant 15,000 toises.</p>
<p>9th. At half past four o'clock, we descried the rock called
Eddystone, bearing north-west, distant about 8,000 toises, At a
distance we took it, as Shortland did, for a vessel under sail.
The deception was the greater, as the colour of it is nearly that
of the sails of ships; but some shrubs, adorned its upper
part.</p>
<p>The lands of the Arsacides opposite to this rock, are steep
and covered with large trees to their summits.</p>
<p>Several fires kindled on the mountains, indicated the presence
of the savages.</p>
<p>Our observations ascertained the situation of Cape Nepean, to
be 8&deg; S. lat. and 154&deg; 56' 24" E. long.</p>
<p>The Eddystone rock is in 8&deg; 0 S. lat. and 154&deg; 5' E.
long, and consequently more to the eastward of Cape Nepean than
Shortland alledges.</p>
<p>We lay to from two o'clock in the morning till day-light.</p>
<p>10th. Early in the morning, we saw the Treasury Islands,
bearing N.W.&frac14;N. distant 20,000 toises. They are situated
20 leagues to the northwest of the Eddystone.</p>
<p>About noon, we were distant about 2,500 toises from the
western point of the largest, and most westerly island of that,
little group. It, is in 7&deg; 25' 36" S. lat. and 152' 56' 34"
E. longitude.</p>
<p>Those islands are five or six in number, and so near together,
that at a distance, they appear to form but one island, as was
believed by General Bougainville, who saw them to the westward,
when passing through the channel to which he gave his name. The
Esperance only distinguished three islands; we saw five
distinctly, and, had we been nearer, we should probably have seen
more. The mountains which form those islands, are of a moderate
elevation, and almost every where covered with large trees. The
little group occupies a space about ten leagues in circuit; the
east and west points being extended into shoals.</p>
<p>After having sailed round them, we steered N.N.E. in order to
view the eastern part of the island of Bougainville. About five
O'clock p.m. we were near its southern extremity, where we espied
a group of ten little islands, the largest of which extends from
east to west. Being covered with large spreading trees,
interspersed with palms, those islands presented an enchanting
prospect. Very near their southern side, we observed among them
some breakers, which rendered it dangerous to approach them.</p>
<p>Two canoes, in which we distinguished a number of natives,
were under sail, and seemed to steer towards us; but they passed
behind the little island nearest us, and their rapid motion soon
carried them out of our sight. On the beach of the same little
island, we saw a company of ten natives, near a canoe, which lay
upon the sand, and which they did not attempt to launch, in order
to visit us. As night approached, it was necessary for us to go
about, in order to get into the offing.</p>
<p>11th. A violent rain drenched us during the night, and was
succeeded by a thick fog, which enveloped the land, and did not
permit us to approach it, till some hours after sun-rise.</p>
<p>Some reefs, level with the water, and extending for some
hundred toises, appeared about eleven o'clock, at the distance of
15,000 toises from the shore, which they warned us not to
approach.</p>
<p>We saw the summits of the high mountains of Bougainville
island piercing the clouds.</p>
<p>The land was again invested with a fog, and we were obliged to
wait till the 13th before we could pursue our examination of the
coast.</p>
<p>13th. We enjoyed the beautiful prospect of the high mountains
gently falling into extensive plains, where however we observed
no trace of cultivation. The whole scene was covered with trees,
even to the highest elevations, which appeared to be at least
twelve hundred toises in perpendicular height, and to be distant
above twenty thousand toises from the shore.</p>
<p>Fires upon the hills announced the pretence of the
natives.</p>
<p>About half-past eleven o'clock, we thought ourselves in the
great security, when we found the ship in shoal water, which the
watch had not perceived. It was so shallow, that we could easily
distinguish the fishes upon the rocks, some points of which,
higher than others, put us in dread of shipwreck every
instant.</p>
<p>We were then in 4&frac12; fathoms of water, and the boat,
which immediately began to sound different parts of the shoal,
found only 3 fathoms at one of its extremities. The whole bottom
was coral.</p>
<p>Thus we were involved in the most imminent dangers, being
surrounded on all sides with shoals, which threatened us with the
immediate destruction of the ship.</p>
<p>Boats were dispatched, to sound the water over the rocks, on
each side of us. The least depth they discovered was 3 fathoms;
so that, a slight agitation of the sea in that place, might have
made us touch the bottom, and lose the ship.</p>
<p>Those rocks, like the reefs of New Caledonia, are the work of
polypi; like those reefs they are built perpendicularly, and
quite close to them, no bottom can be found with one hundred
fathoms of line. They rise, like so many columns, from the bottom
of the lea, and their progressive augmentation daily increases
the danger of navigating those parts of the ocean.</p>
<p>At noon our lat. was 6&deg; 13' 11" S. and our long. 152&deg;
7' 51" E. We brought to, and remained there till two o'clock.</p>
<p>Several trunks of trees floated alongside. On one of those
which the boats brought, we observed a very old notch, which
shewed that the inhabitants of the neighbouring island are in
possession of instruments which cut very clean. Perhaps they
still retain some of the axes, which General Bougainville gave
them.</p>
<p>We drove insensibly towards a shoal; but we saw it in good
time and avoided it.</p>
<p>Though the watches were ordered to redouble their attention,
we found ourselves about half past three upon another shoal,
which it was necessary for us to clear like the first, at the
risk of seeing the vessel drive against the rocks. There was the
same depth of water as before. The surge was rendered very strong
by this bank of coral.</p>
<p>Our position was the more dangerous, as night approached, and
those shoals being at some distance from the coast, gave us
reason to apprehend that we should meet with others still farther
off. How were we to avoid them, during the darkness of the night?
We must trust to chance the security of our ship. We brought to,
till day sight, the ship's head to the south-west, and we
frequently sounded without finding any bottom.</p>
<p>14th. The Esperance, about three o'clock in the morning, made
signals, which produced a lively sensation on board of our ship.
We believed that they indicated some danger; but they were merely
intended to give us notice that she had soundings, in forty-two
fathoms. We stood off a little from the land, and at day-light
steered close along shore. The chain of mountains then began to
subside.</p>
<p>Some little islands, detached from Bougainville Island, were
connected together by reefs, on which we saw the waves beating.
But these were not the only dangers on that coast; sunken rocks
formed shoals, which followed the same direction. Those coral
banks were doubtless covered with fish; for we saw many sea-birds
hovering over them in quest of their prey.</p>
<p>A canoe, manned by six natives, was behind the little islands
the nearest to our ship; but, as we were making great way, we
very soon passed them.</p>
<p>That part of Bougainville Island which was now in sight,
seemed to be much more populous than what we had hitherto seen.
The fine plantations of cocoa-nut trees which bordered the coast,
left us no room to doubt that the population was very
considerable.</p>
<p>At noon, in latitude 5&deg; 43' 12" south, and longitude
152&deg; 3' 26" east, we saw Bougainville Island, forming, with
the little adjoining islands, a bay not less than 15,000 toises
in extent. The General intended to anchor there; but shoals
observed in different points of its entrance, and a sand-bank
near its farther extremity, made him change his resolution.</p>
<p>Bougainville Island terminates in very low lands, and we soon
had sight of the narrow channel which separates it from Bouka
Island.</p>
<p>After standing off, we lay to all night.</p>
<p>The heat of the day had accumulated the materials of thunder
above the high mountains. Frequent flashes of lightning
discovered to us their summits, and the thunder rattled with a
tremendous noise.</p>
<p>During the night the current had carried us more than twenty
minutes towards the north. At six in the morning we were 5,000
toises to the northward of Bouka Island. The vast plantations of
cocoa-nut trees which adorned its shores, indicated a numerous
population.</p>
<p>A canoe, with nine natives on board, put off, and steered
towards us. We immediately hove to in order to receive them; but
they stopped within three hundred toises of the ship, and showing
us their island, made signs to invite us on shore. There were but
seven paddlers in the canoe; two other natives seemed wholly
occupied in baling out the water, which beat over the sides of
the canoe, and in observing our movements.</p>
<p>A native put off alone from the beach, on a <i>catimarran</i>,
and paddling with the greatest celerity, came and joined the
canoe, which kept always to the windward of us. Though a very old
man, he appeared to be still very robust. After having viewed us
for some minutes, he plied towards the island, as rapidly as he
had come off. He appeared to be a messenger dispatched by the
inhabitants, to make his observations, and to report to them what
he had seen.</p>
<p>The canoe left us, and proceeded towards the Esperance,
another very large one having been already alongside of her.</p>
<p>We saw at some distance a small canoe, manned by five natives,
who came astern of our ship, and kept at the distance of about
500 toises, notwithstanding all our invitations to them to come
on board.</p>
<p>In hopes of alluring those savages, we let down into the water
a plank, with some knives and nails upon it, and a bit of scarlet
stuff by way of a flag, tied to a stick placed upright in its
centre. They did not, however, seize upon those objects, till we
cut the string which kept it nearer to the ship than they chose
to venture. The sight of the bit of stuff diffused among them the
most lively joy; they showed us that they had accepted of our
present, and earnestly desired more of the same sort.</p>
<p>At last, by throwing them handkerchiefs, bits of red stuff,
and empty bottles, we succeeded in bringing them alongside. One
of the bottles having taken in some sea-water, the savage who
took it up, thinking perhaps that we had sent him something good
to drink, was disagreeably mistaken on tailing the contrary, and
we regretted that we had not given him timely notice of the
circumstance.</p>
<p>Those natives were acquainted with the method of barter, and
took much pains to the us the price of their goods.</p>
<p>We received a very fine bow and some arrows, in exchange for a
few handkerchiefs, which we let down to them by a rope. As they
did not observe that we possessed this kind of weapon, they
endeavoured to make us sensible of its value, by showing us its
use.</p>
<p>One of the gunners went for his fiddle, and played them some
tunes; and we had the pleasure to see that they were not
insensible to music. They offered us a number of things in
exchange for the instrument, making signs for it, by imitating
the motions of the fiddler upon a paddle. But they soon found
that their solicitations were fruitless. It was the only fiddle
by which the ship's company danced; and we had too long a voyage
before us, to think of parting with the instrument, which
procured us an exercise so salutary to seamen.</p>
<p>We had so loaded them with presents, that they soon began to
make difficulties in giving their commodities in exchange for
ours, to procure which they had recourse to unfair arts. The
Commander had agreed to give them some handkerchiefs striped with
red, their favourite colour, for a bow, and trusting too much to
their good faith, had delivered them the handkerchiefs; but
instead of the bow, they would only give some arrows, which were
refused.</p>
<p>Those natives seemed to, have a great propensity to gaiety.
They seemed to take pleasure in repeating the words which they
heard us pronounce; and the sweetness of their language enabled
them easily to succeed in the imitation.</p>
<p>They were passionately fond of music, and particularly of the
most brisk and noisy tunes. One of the officers, who was a good
performer, played a very lively tune. They listened with very
great attention; astonishment was visible in their features; they
could not conceal the pleasure they felt; but, by different
motions of their arms, which kept exact time with the measure,
and a great agitation of the whole body, they gave unequivocal
proofs of their sensibility.</p>
<p>They did not lose sight of the desire which the Commander had
expressed for a bow. One of them promised him a bow in exchange
for a hat; but when he got possession of the hat, he refused to
surrender the bow.</p>
<p>Most of the things which we gave them were tied to the end of
a line, which they were not at the pains to loose; for they
carried in their girdles, shells which were sufficiently sharp to
cut it at once.</p>
<p>As we had good reason to distrust their promises, a man went
down by a rope ladder astern, with a view to exchange a bit of
red stuff for a bow, when we perceived that the current had
carried us to the north-west, and that we were already too near
the shore. As a calm prevented us from steering the ship, we were
obliged to put out a boat in order to tow her off. The savages
thinking, no doubt, that we intended to pursue them, in order to
punish them for their dishonesty, retreated precipitately towards
the island. Out of gratitude, perhaps, for the patience with
which we allowed them to cheat us, they committed no such act of
treachery as General Bougainville, in his voyage round the world,
had experienced at their hands.</p>
<p>Four canoes were, all this while, dealing with the Esperance.
One of them was manned by natives, of whom sixteen were paddlers,
and the rest warriors.</p>
<p>We learned from the people on board the Esperance, that this
war-canoe had long kept at a distance; but ventured to come
alongside, on seeing the different articles which their
countrymen in the little canoes had procured.</p>
<p>The order with which the savages were stationed in the great
canoe, indicated a kind of naval tactics. A warrior, armed with a
bow and arrows, stood between every two paddlers on each side,
and intermediate parties of two or three warriors stood with
their faces towards the stern of the canoe, in order to observe
the movements in that direction, and to sight while retreating.
Those warriors showed no hostile disposition; they seemed very
fond of the wine and brandy which was given to them, but did not
eat bacon, without a degree of repugnance.</p>
<p>Those savages had excellent teeth, and found no difficulty in
masticating the hardest biscuits which were offered to them.</p>
<p>Could those natives have had any communication with the
English and the Spaniards? One of them, on showing us an arrow,
which he was going to tie to the end of one of our strings to
convey it on hoard, pronounced, very willingly, the English word
<i>arrow</i>. Another, showing us the land, and inviting us to
it, made use of the Spanish word <i>tierra</i>.</p>
<p>We learned from the Esperance, that several of them pronounced
the word <i>Bouka</i>, the name which General Bougainville gave
to their island. This word, which in the Malayan language is the
expression of negation, and which, when the first syllable is
pronounced long, signifies <i>to open</i>, doubtless seems to
indicate some analogy with the Malayan; from which, however, it
differs so much, that one of the ship's company, who spoke the
language fluently, could not understand those natives.</p>
<p>The value which they seemed to affix to nails, and the other
articles of hardware which we gave them, showed that they were
acquainted with the use of iron.</p>
<p>The colour of their skins is blackish. They are of a middling
stature; and being naked, their distinctly marked muscles
indicated great strength. Their figure though not very agreeable,
is extremely expressive. Their heads are very big; their
foreheads broad, like the rest of their faces, which are very
flat, especially under the nose; their chins large and prominent;
their cheeks full, their noses flat, their mouths very large, and
their lips very thin.</p>
<p>The betel, which gives a bloody tint to their large mouths,
adds to the ugliness of their appearance.</p>
<p>Their ears are loaded with large rings made of shells, the
weight of which contributed to the large size of those organs.
Some had red and white streaks traced upon their bodies; and we
observed one whose hair and nose were sprinkled with a red earth,
which appeared to be ochre. Some had bracelets formed of the
fibres of the cocoa-nut husk.</p>
<p>Their hair was curled, thick and bulky, like that of many
Papows, whom we afterwards met with.</p>
<p>They are in the practice of plucking the hair from every part
of the body. There was but one seen, on board the Esperance, who
allowed his beard to grow.</p>
<p>All of them had their loins girded with a cord, which went
several times about the body, and seemed only designed as a point
of support, to increase the muscular strength of those parts. One
of them, probably with a similar view, had his left arm tied in
three different places, dyer the biceps muscle; some flat bits of
wood, on the outside of the arm, supporting the strain of the
cord.</p>
<p>Those savages appeared to handle the bow with much address.
One of them brought on board the Esperance, a booby, which he had
brought down with an arrow; and the fatal wound was seen in the
belly of the bird.</p>
<p>The industry of those islanders seemed to be particularly
directed to the fabrication of their arms, which were formed with
great care. We admired the skill with which they had coated their
bow-strings with a resinous substance, which gave them, at first
sight, the appearance of catgut. The middle of the string was
done round with bark, in order to save it from wear, by giving
the impulse to the arrow. The inferior part of the arrows was
very light, being formed of the stalk of the <i>saccharum
spontaneum</i>; and the other part consisted of very hard wood,
well pointed. The joining is ingeniously fastened with about
thirty turns of bark, as is also the part of the arrow which
bears upon the string, to give it the greater solidity.</p>
<p>Their canoes, formed of several planks, ingeniously joined
together, are of a shape at once elegant, and adapted for a quick
motion. See Plate XLIII.</p>

<b>PLATE XLIII. <i>Canoe of the Island of Bouka</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>At the approach of night, a current setting to the N.N.W.
communicated to the tide a rippling motion, so like the effect of
a shoal, that it might have deceived the most experienced eye.
The boat was sent to sound, but no bottom was found with
twenty-six fathoms of line.</p>
<p>During the night, violent thunder claps dissipated the thick
clouds which enveloped the summits of the mountains, while we
steered S.S.W. in order, if possible, to stem the current.</p>
<p>We had now explored the western coast of those two islands, as
General Bougainville had their eastern parts, when he first
discovered them.</p>
<p>The most easterly, which is at the same time the most
southerly, point of Bougainville Island, is in latitude 7&deg; 4'
50" S. and in longitude 153&deg; 18' 34" E.</p>
<p>The northern point, called Point Laverdy, is in 5&deg; 34' S.
lat. and in 152&deg; 31' E. long.</p>
<p>The coral banks, which we discovered off Bougainville Island,
are situated in 6&deg; 11' S. lat., and 152&deg; 2' E. long.</p>
<p>The north point of the island of Bouka, is in 5&deg; 5' 36" S.
lat. and 152&deg; 9' E. long.</p>
<p>The easterly variation of the compass diminished till it came
to 7&deg; 30'.</p>
<p>The currents along the coast, carried us constantly from 8' to
10' to the north-west every day.</p>
<p>The thermometer did not rise above 22&deg;, although we were
so near the Equator.</p>
<p>16th: At sun-rise we had sight of a flat island, to which
Carteret has given the name of Sir Charles Hardy, stretching from
north 15&deg; east, to north 22&deg; 30' east, distant about
15,000 toises. It is situated 25,000 toises N.N.W. of the island
of Bouka.</p>
<p>About one in the afternoon, we came in sight of Cape Saint
George, on the south-east of New Ireland, beating W.N.W., distant
about 20,000 toises. It was found to be in 4&deg; 54' 30" S. lat.
and 150&deg; 39' E. longitude.</p>
<p>We worked to windward, by tacking, all the night.</p>
<p>17th. At day-break we steered for Carteret harbour, where we
could not stop to anchor. Leaving the island of Marteaux about
25,000 toises on the starboard, we steered so as to pass very
near the Booby rocks, leaving Laig Island on the larboard, and we
arrived between the island of Cocos and New Ireland, where we
came to an anchor, about half past one o'clock p.m. in thirty-two
fathoms of water, the bottom being very soft black mud, mixed
with calcareous sand. We were about 200 toises from the island of
Cocos.</p>
<p>The north-west point of New Ireland bore west 12&deg; north,
distant about 25,000 toises, and the south-east point of the same
island bore south 31&deg; east, at the same distance.</p>
<p>The middle of the passage, on the north-west of Carteret
harbour, bore west 10&deg; north.</p>
<p>At the distance of about fifty toises from the island of
Cocos, we would have been in a harbour well defended on all
sides. There is anchorage at a very small distance from the land;
for about ten toises from the shore there are five fathoms of
water, and, as the distance increases, the depth increases very
rapidly.</p>
<p>We went on shore, on the island of Cocos, to pass the rest of
the day. That little island, the highest part of which is not
above seventy-five toises above the level of the sea, is formed
of very white calcareous stones. Having risen from under the
water, time has not much altered the form of the madrepores,
which enter into its composition. They may be traced even on the
rocks, which are the most exposed to the injuries of the air. The
island is terminated on the south-east, and on the north-west, by
the same kind of stones. About mid-way between it and Laig
Island, there is sufficient depth to allow ships a passage.</p>
<p>A great quantity of rain having fallen in the night, there
arose so much humidity out of the woods, as formed clouds every
instant, which originating chiefly in the lowest places,
resembled, at first sight, the smoke of fires kindled in the
forest, and as soon as they had acquired sufficient elevation to
be exposed to the current of air, they presently disappeared.</p>
<p>Large trees, which always preserve their verdure, cover the
island of Cocos. Though their roots find little vegetable mould
among the calcareous stones, between which they penetrate, yet,
in that moist situation, they flourish very luxuriantly. It was a
pleasant spectacle to see the fine tree, known by the name of
<i>barringtonia speciosa</i>, attracted by the humidity, extend
its branches horizontally a great way over the sea. That island
produces fig-trees of different species; and We expected to find
there abundance of cocoa-nuts. This expectation was indeed one
reason for our preferring this anchoring place to several others
at no great distance. But we found it difficult to procure even a
dozen of those nuts.</p>
<p>We saw, with concern, that same of the party, who had been
sent on shore for wood, had allowed themselves to cut down the
cocoa-nut trees for the sake of the fruit. They carefully
searched for the young leaves on the tops of the trees, which are
very tender, and afforded very agreeable refreshment to people
who had lived long on salted provisions. If we had permitted
them, they would not have left a cocoa-nut tree in the island;
and that anchorage would have been deprived, perhaps for ever, of
a resource extremely agreeable to navigators.</p>
<p>The night overtook us, when in the middle of the wood, and we
were entertained with the charming spectacle of a prodigious
number of glow worms, which diffused so much brightness as to
dazzle, rather than enlighten us.</p>
<p>It was the time at which the species of crab called <i>cancer
ruricola</i>, leaves the holes which it digs. On our way to the
place where the boat was waiting for us, we trod upon several of
them, and some of our party, before they knew what animal it was,
were apprehensive that it was some venomous reptile.</p>
<p>18th. The next day I visited the south-east part of the
island; but vines of different kinds prevented me from
penetrating far into the forests. Different species of the
<i>epidendrum</i> adorned the trunks of the largest trees, and
grew in the midst of a great number of ferns equally
parasitical.</p>
<p>We observed, floating along the shore, the fruits of several
species of the <i>pandanus</i>, of the <i>barringtonia
speciosa</i>, and of the <i>heritiera</i>, which stretched their
branches, and even their trunks; in a very remarkable manner,
over the waters of the sea.</p>
<p>Two of our men who followed me saw an alligator close to the
shore, on the south-east extremity of the island of Cocos. But I
do not believe that those animals are very common there; for,
during the whole time that we lay at anchor, no accident
happened, though a great number of our people were in the habit
of bathing.</p>
<p>Near the eastern extremity of this little island, I observed
several kinds of <i>nautili</i>, disseminated amidst the
prodigious quantity of lithophites, which entered into its
composition.</p>
<p>The abundance and continuance of the rains were astonishing.
It was an incessant torrent of tepid water, which, however, did
not hinder us from visiting the environs of the anchoring
place.</p>
<p>I landed several days successively, on the islands of Cocos
and Laig.</p>
<p>The number of insects of different forms and colours was truly
astonishing; and the rains did not appear to diminish their
activity. They were chiefly <i>coleapteras</i>, which it was
difficult to catch.</p>
<p>The most varied species belonged to the genus <i>cicindela
fabr.</i></p>
<p>We were entertained with the pleasant view of different
species of figtrees, from the top branches of which depended a
great number of radicles, soon to be transferred to the soil, and
to give birth to so many different trees.</p>
<p>The palm <i>cycas circinalis</i> hath multiplied greatly in
the shallows, near the shade of the great trees. We observed near
them an arbour newly constructed with branches, where the natives
had been reposing, and had left the fragments of a repast they
had made on the fruit of the cycas, the kernels of which, if
eaten without preparation, are a powerful emetic, as several of
our ship's company experienced; but the ravages had roasted them,
as we observed the marks of fire on a great number of the
husks.</p>
<p>The kernel of the fruit of the <i>cycas circinalis</i>, is
very bitter. The inhabitants of the Moluccas know how to put it
to a better use, than those of New Ireland, as I had occasion to
observe, towards the end of this voyage. Experience had taught
them that maceration freed it from its hurtful. qualities; and
the same process may also succeed with many other fruits and
roots, which, in this manner, may be rendered useful, as food for
animals and even for man.</p>
<p>There lay on the ground, a great number of the fruits of the
cycas, which the savages had not touched. Their succulent hulk,
which diffused an odour, like that of the finest apple, contains
fermentative particles sufficient to produce a good spirituous
liquor. Those fruits abound there, and may be useful to
navigators.</p>
<p>Among the large trees which grow on the island of Cocos, I
observed, with surprize, a new species of arec, the trunk of
which was above eighteen toises in height, and its thickness
throughout, not more than three inches. It was difficult for us
to conceive how a tree, so weak in appearance, could support
itself to so great an elevation; but our astonishment ceased,
when we attempted to cut one down. Its wood was so very hard, as
to resist, for some time, the most forcible strokes of the axe. A
great quantity of interlaced (<i>amilac&eacute;e</i>) substance,
under the form of pith, occupied its centre, a circumstance
common to many other trees of the same genus. This pith taken out
of the trunk, left a cylinder, the wood of which did not exceed
four-tenths of an inch in thickness, and was of a fine black
colour. The fruit of this new species of arec is red, scarcely
larger than a common olive, and nearly of the same shape.</p>
<p>The <i>caryota urens</i> was one of the large trees of those
forests. Among the number of shrubs, were several species of the
<i>drac&aelig;na</i>. Among the large trees, I admired a
<i>solanum</i>, certainly the highest species of that genus;
those hitherto known to botanists, being only herbs or feeble
shrubs. The leaves of this are oval, hard and very smooth.</p>
<p>That fine tree, the <i>tectona grandis</i>, so valuable for
ship-building, grows at Carteret harbour. I also saw there
different species of the <i>guettarda</i>, and a new species of
<i>hermandia</i>.</p>
<p>Mosses and ferns were very numerous, and grew with the
greatest luxuriance, in those humid situations.</p>
<p>The western shore of the Island of Cocos is precipitous, and
very much elevated above the level of the sea. The calcareous
stones, of which it is composed, being much exposed to the
injuries of the weather, are very friable. I found there the
nutmeg-tree, which Rumphius has described, under the denomination
of <i>myristica mas</i> (<i>Rumph. Amb</i>. vol. 2. tab. 5.) The
fruit was then but young. It is more elongated than that of the
species which is cultivated.</p>
<p>Some savage must certainly have perished among those rocks,
for I found a human skeleton almost entire.</p>
<p>Near to that was a place where I taw the remains of a fire;
which had been kindled by the natives who frequent that
coast.</p>
<p>The continual rains at Carteret harbour, have rendered some
species of spiders very industrious. They construct excellent
places of shelter, in the middle of their webs, consisting of a
snug fabric, in the shape of a cornet of paper, four-fifths of an
inch in height, and one-fifth of an inch broad in the base, with
its top elevated and a little inclined towards the south-east, in
order that the prevailing winds may have the leis force on this
little habitation. The rain glides off this kind of cone, without
being able to enter it, or to press it down, being stretched on
all sides by threads fastened to the neighbouring branches. The
spider, being perfectly sheltered in this habitation, never
leaves it, but to seize the insects which fall into her
toils.</p>
<p>Another sort of spider which is a less productive spinster
than the former, protects herself from the rain under a piece of
a leaf bent into a form almost conical, which the places in the
centre of her web. Every precaution is taken to give solidity to
her habitation, the point of which is opposed to the south-east
wind, in order that it may be the less affected by its
impulse.</p>
<p>Nature hath done every thing for other species of spiders,
which are covered with very hard skins, and as smooth as if they
were coated with the finest varnish. Those suffer no
inconvenience from the great rains to which they are constantly
exposed, and they wait patiently in the middle of their net, for
the insects which form their prey.</p>
<p>Among those spiders, I found some, the bodies of which
terminated in points; the <i>aranea aculeata</i>, and the
<i>aranea spinosa</i>.</p>
<p>The island of Laig, being much less than that of Cocos,
presents fewer productions. The land of it is of the same nature,
but much less elevated.</p>
<p>The precipitous mountains of New Ireland, which border upon
Carteret harbour, are at least, three times as high as those of
the island of Cocos. The marine productions, of which they are
partly composed, are observable, in the same manner, even on
their summits.</p>
<p>On the 23d I landed on New Ireland, N.N.W. of the anchoring
place, and near the place whence our ship received her water. The
stream which furnished it, was visible only near the sea. Farther
inland, we saw the channel of a torrent, along which, in
different places, were cavities filled with water, which
filtrating through the sand, formed the little brook which
supplied the watering-place. After an hour's walk along its
banks, we came to a beautiful cascade, which formed, by dashing
from the high calcareous rocks, in which we observed vast
grottoes, which served as retreats for large bats, of the species
denominated <i>vespertilio vampyrus</i>.</p>
<p>Some wild bread-fruit trees grew in those places.</p>
<p>At a time when Carteret harbour was inundated with continual
rain, I was astonished to see only the channel of a torrent
without any water; but it appeared to me, that the rain did not
extend far enough inland to fill it. Of this it was easy to be
convinced, by the serenity of the sky towards the south-west,
while at the anchoring-place, the rain fell without intermission.
Carteret harbour forms a sort of basin, where the clouds, loaded
with water, after passing over the high mountains of New Ireland,
experience a calm which hinders the air from supporting them.
Hence result those excessive rains, which render the
anchoring-place far from desirable to navigators.</p>
<p>Among the little plants, which grow in the shade of the
forests, I observed several species of the <i>procris</i>.</p>
<p>Besides the nutmeg-trees of which I have already spoken,
nature hath furnished the inhabitants of New Ireland with the
species of pepper, known to botanists, by the name of <i>piper
cubebe</i>, which I observed adorning the bases of the large
trees, through a very extensive space.</p>
<p>Our boat was sent a fishing on the coast of New Ireland, about
5,000 toises to the south-east. There were observed some
habitations, which had been newly and very ingeniously
constructed by the natives, who were not contented with the
roasted fruit of the <i>cycas circinalis</i>; for the remains of
shell-fish were seen near those cottages.</p>
<p>24th. When the Commander anchored in Carteret harbour, he
intended to remain there at least fifteen days; but the excessive
rains made him resolve to leave it much sooner.</p>
<p>The greatest activity had been been exerted in procuring our
complement of wood and water; and on the morning of the 24th we
had made every preparation for setting sail.</p>
<p>The water which we took in at Carteret harbour was very good,
and procured with great facility, by means of wooden spouts,
which conveyed it into the boat, with no other trouble than
lifting it three feet lower than the spout.</p>
<p>Our wood was cut in the Island of Cocos, and the conveyance of
it was the more easy, as the boat could come close to the beach.
It is proper to remark, that the wood, which we obtained at
Carteret harbour, introduced into the ship a prodigious number of
scorpions and scolopendr&aelig; of the species called
<i>scolopendra morsitans</i>, insects which very much incommoded
us.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The harbouring of such noxious and abominable
reptiles, is a solid objection against the wainscotting of houses
in tropical climates, which is afterwards tacitly recommended by
the author.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>It was to no purpose, that we erected the observatory on the
island of Cocos; for the incessant rains did not allow us to make
a single observation. It is difficult to form a proper idea of
these excessive rains, which poured down in an almost
uninterrupted torrent.</p>
<p>The thermometer, observed at noon, while we lay at anchor,
varied from 19&deg; to 21&deg;; and the barometer only from 28
inches 1 7-10th lines, to 28 inches 1 2-10th lines.</p>
<p>Our ship lay at anchor in 4&deg; 48' 10" S. lat., and 150&deg;
25' 40" E. long.</p>
<p>This harbour afforded us no refreshments; and we were
unsuccessful in fishing.</p>
<p>The tides took place but once a day, and rose only about six
feet.</p>

<p>ON the 24th of July about 11 a.m. we set sail from Carteret
harbour, and took advantage of a gentle breeze at south-east, to
pass through the north-west opening, between Cocos Island and New
Ireland.</p>
<p>The current set to the W.N.W. and at noon we were 5,000 toises
W.N.W. of our anchoring place.</p>
<p>The Esperance, not having hove up her anchor in time to profit
by this breeze, a calm succeeded almost as soon as the set her
sails, and the current drove her towards the breakers, on the
starboard of her passage out of the harbour. She was therefore
obliged to cast anchor, and wait for a wind, to extricate her
from this dangerous situation.</p>
<p>We lay to, in hopes that the would soon rejoin us; but it was
half an hour past four before the could overtake us. The captain
then told us that he was in danger of being wrecked at the
entrance of the harbour which we had quitted. Having been forced
by the current to come to an anchor on a coral bottom, the cable
had been cut by the rocks, at the moment when a breeze sprang up
at south-east, and carried them from the rocks. They had come too
near them to cast a second anchor with advantage; and the frigate
quitted the station with the loss of an anchor, and three fathoms
of cable.</p>
<p>Our position now enabled us to observe, that the channel of
St. George is not more than 30,000 or 35,000 toises in breadth,
at its southern extremity. The obscurity of the weather appears
to have led Carteret into the error, of supposing its breadth
almost double of what we found it.</p>
<p>We tried during the night, and the current carried us into St.
George's channel, at the rate of 2,500 toises in the hour.</p>
<p>About one o'clock in the morning the Isle of Man bore W.S.W.,
distant 5,000 toises.</p>
<p>A very thick fog concealed from us, all day, the lofty
mountains of New Ireland. But their summits appeared from time to
time, and we had sight of mountains towards the centre of that
island, at least 1,000 toises in perpendicular devotion. We
observed large trees even on the highest of their peaks.</p>
<p>At four in the afternoon we lay to, with an intention to
explore Sandwich Island the next day. But the currents hurried us
along with such rapidity during the night, that at day break,
when we were setting the sails, we were astonished to find
ourselves not more than two hundred toises, from that island.</p>
<p>The watch had probably been asleep; for we received no
intimation that the current was driving us upon the coast; which,
however, even at that small distance, happily presented no
danger.</p>
<p>The island of Sandwich has no considerable elevation. Like New
Ireland, it was covered with trees; and some old trunks, after
losing part of their branches, were scattered here and there,
upon the little hills. Being covered with parasite plants, they
looked like columns adorned with garlands, and added greatly to
the picturesque appearance of that charming island.</p>
<p>The part of New Ireland too, which lies opposite to Sandwich
Island, presents a tract but little elevated. There arose,
however, in the middle of a vast plain, some little hills which
might be 200 or 250 toises in perpendicular height.</p>
<p>The north-west part of Sandwich Island terminates in several
points or slips of land, advanced into the sea. We distinguished
five principal ones; and near the base of one of them, is a
peaked hill, which is the highest land in the island although its
perpendicular altitude does not exceed 200 or 250 toises, and
consequently it is much less elevated than Captain Carteret
alledges. The clearness of the weather, and the near approach we
made to this little mountain, enabled us to judge of its
elevation.</p>
<p>Some huts in the shade of the woods of cocoa-nut trees, made
us hope for an interview with the inhabitants of Sandwich Island;
but it was doubtless too early in the morning for them to pay us
a visit, for we did not see a single individual.</p>
<p>The most westerly point of that island is in 2&deg; 59' 26" S.
lat. and 148&deg; 29' 15" E. longitude. Its greatest length, from
E.S.E. to W.N.W. is 15,000 toises.</p>
<p>At its western point we observed a little island, which
Carteret had not perceived.</p>
<p>Ten days had elapsed without our having had an opportunity of
observing the passage of the sun over the meridian; but on the
26th of July, we found our latitude at noon to be 2&deg; 50' 29"
S., and our longitude 148&deg; 16' 50" E.; and we were enabled to
determine the situation of the northern, and most westerly point
of New Ireland, which was in 2&deg; 44' 30" S. lat., and 140&deg;
11' 30" E. longitude. The obscurity of the weather must have
occasioned the error of Carteret, who placed it above 10,000
toises farther to the north.</p>
<p>About four o'clock in the evening, we were distant about 1,500
toises from a great number of little islands, situated at the
entrance of, the channel which separates New Ireland from New
Hanover; and we observed that the passage, between those islands
was obstructed by reefs.</p>
<p>New Ireland is terminated by low lands.</p>
<p>New Hanover, towards the north-west, presents a flat surface,
while its centre is occupied by a chain of very high mountains,
which extend towards the south-east.</p>
<p>27th. In the morning of this day, we had sight of Portland
Islands, which we coasted at a small distance. They form a group
of seven little islands, which occupy a space of about 7,500
toises in extent, in the direction of east and west. They are
very flat, covered with large trees, and are connected together
by reefs and sand-banks.</p>
<p>Those little islands are in latitude 2&deg; 39' 44" S. and in
longitude 147&deg; 15'E.</p>
<p>28th. We continued to direct our course towards the Admiralty
Islands, where Commodore Hunter, according to the account of two
French captains, believed that he saw the wreck of the
unfortunate expedition of La P&eacute;rouse; and we steered for
the most southerly of the little group. Like most of the islands
in the South Seas, this is bordered by reefs at a small distance
from the beach.</p>
<p>A line of fifty toises in length did not reach the bottom;
although we were but 1,000 toises from the land.</p>
<p>We observed towards the S.W. some canoes proceeding along
shore, within the reefs; but none of them seemed desirous of
getting clear of the reefs, in order to come towards us. We also
distinguished some groups of natives, upon the most advanced
points of land, in order that they might have the better view of
our ships.</p>
<p>A large tree standing above the breakers, was taken by some
for the wreck of a ship; but the branches and roots which were
distinctly seen, left no doubt that it was a tree, which had been
detached from the coast.</p>
<p>The Commander sent an officer on board the Esperance, to
concert with the captain the researches which it would be proper
to make at the Admiralty Islands, agreeable to the intelligence
which had been sent us at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<b>PLATE II. <i>View of the Admiralty Islands</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>We passed the night in beating about, and making head against
the currents.</p>
<p>29th. Captain Huon waited on the General, early the next
morning. He was of opinion, that we should visit the island
E.N.E. of that we had coasted. In fact, according to one of the
depositions which had been sent to the Commander of the
expedition, it was on the most easterly island that the savages
had been seen cloathed in the uniform of the French marine. About
the middle of the day we were within 2,500 toises of that island,
and saw some of the natives, coming towards the beach. Some huts
were seen among the cocoa-nut trees. Other islanders soon
appeared on the south-east point; and their number increased as
we approached them. Some canoes lay upon the sand, and we hoped
to see the natives launch them, in order to meet us; but they
made no dispositions for that purpose. As the General wished to
have an interview with them, we went under the lee of the island,
where we found but little shelter, it being of small extent. A
crowd of natives now appeared. Some ran along the shore; others
kept their eyes directed towards our ships, inviting us by signs
to come on shore, and expressing their joy by shouting. Some of
them launched a canoe, but hesitated for some time to come near
our ship, and paddled towards the Esperance which was more to
windward. This little canoe was furnished with an out-rigger, and
had on board seven natives, who almost immediately returned on
shore.</p>
<p>At half past one o'clock we brought to, and dispatched from
each ship a boat, with different articles, to be distributed
among the inhabitants of that little island. While the boats were
approaching the land as near as they could, the frigates were in
readiness to protect them, in case of an attack from the savages;
for the perfidy, which the inhabitants of the most southerly of
the Admiralty Islands had practised on Carteret, gave us some
apprehensions with regard to the intentions of those. That
voyager tells us, that in September 1767, when he discovered the
southern part of that archipelago, the savages attacked him with
two volleys of arrows, notwithstanding the marks of friendship
which he had lavished upon them.</p>
<p>This island was cultivated to its very summit. Several pieces
of land were fenced in, which made us believe that the
inhabitants were acquainted with the right of property. The whole
island presented the appearance of a little round mountain, the
base of which was adorned with beautiful plantations of cocoa-nut
trees, while its more elevated parts appeared to be allotted to
the cultivation of different roots, which also furnished to the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>When the boats came within about fifty toises of the shore,
they found no bottom with thirty-three fathoms of line; and the
reefs, with which the island is bordered, prevented them from
approaching nearer.</p>
<p>A great number of natives advanced to the beach. We counted
more than an hundred and fifty, who practised every mean in their
power, to induce us to land on their island; but the reefs were
an obstacle which we could not surmount. They threw our people
some cocoa-nuts, and were pleased and astonished to see with what
facility they were opened with an axe.</p>
<p>One of the natives, distinguished from the rest by a double
row of little shells, which adorned his forehead, appeared to
possess great authority. He ordered one of the natives to swim
towards us with some cocoa-nuts. The fear of approaching persons
of whose intention he was ignorant, made the islander, swimming
and defenceless, hesitate a moment. But the chief who, doubtless,
was little accustomed to have his will disobeyed, did not allow
him to reflect. Blows from a cudgel, which he held in his hand,
immediately succeeded his orders, and enforced instant obedience.
We did not expect to see a man treated in this manner, in the
midst of a crowd of people, who appeared to be so little removed
from a state of nature. By way of comforting the poor fellow, our
people gave him some bits of red stuff, a few nails, and a knife,
with which he was greatly pleased. No sooner had he returned to
the island, than curiosity collected all the rest around him,
every one wishing to see our presents. Canoes were immediately
launched, many natives took to the water and swam, and in a short
time there was a great concourse around our boats. We were
surprized to see that neither the force of the surf, nor of the
breakers, discouraged them from this attempt.</p>
<p>There was another chief distinguished by the same ornaments as
he who has been already mentioned; and also by the blows, which
he inflicted with his cudgel, on those to whom he gave his
orders.</p>
<p>Those islanders, who signified the greatest satisfaction at
the sight of our nails, and still more of our hatchets, had some
difficulty in perceiving the value of our knives. At first they
required them to be shut, before they would receive them; but
their fears were very quickly banished, and they received them
open as well as shut. Those people gave us some spears, armed
with bits of vitreous, volcanic lava, terminating in a point, and
very sharp in the edges. They also presented us with combs,
having only three teeth, very distant from each other, very heavy
bracelets, formed of large shells, and others consisting of small
<i>buccin&aelig;</i>, strung on a fibrous substance, as strong as
the best hemp.</p>
<p>When asking for our articles in exchange for theirs, those
savages often repeated the word <i>capelle</i>. It appeared to us
that this was their name for iron, which they preferred to every
thing we could offer them.</p>
<p>Like the natives of Bouka, they repeated with much justness,
the French words which they heard us pronounce.</p>
<p>One of their canoes was driven by the swell against one of our
boats, and received some damage. One of our rowers taking hold of
it to prevent a second shock, a chief, misapprehending our
intention, made the signal to the canoe-men, the greater part of
whom precipitately jumped into the sea, with a design to swim on
shore; but they returned as soon as they perceived their error,
and confidence was re-established.</p>
<p>The women kept at some distance, under the cocoa-nut trees.
Their whole cloathing consisted of a piece of mat, round their
middle.</p>
<p>The men were very busy about our boats. Some swam towards
them, showing their cocoa-nuts; and others seemed to be attracted
by curiosity; but it was soon discovered that this was not their
only passion; for they exerted all their address to get
possession of our goods. Impunity increased their boldness; and,
when they missed their aim, they were not discouraged; but
presently endeavoured to seize something else.</p>
<p>One of those thieves seized upon a knife; but being caught in
the fact, he was obliged to give it up. This did not make him
abandon his enterprize, and he lost nothing by his failure. A
flag, in which red predominated, attracted his regards he found
means to get possession of it, and the theft was not perceived
till he had got a great way from the boat, and had almost reached
the island.</p>
<p>A looking-glass having been given to one of those savages, he
contemplated his image with surprize; but immediately broke the
glass, hoping, no doubt, to find in it the objects which it
reflected.</p>
<p>The complexion of those islanders is black, but not very deep.
Their physiognomy is agreeable, and not very different from that
of the Europeans. Born in a fine climate, and a fertile island,
they seem to be happy, if one may judge from the air of
satisfaction, which is expressed in all their features. The hair
of their heads is crisped, and they are in the practice of
removing it from every other part of the body. It appeared that
the volcanic glass, with which they pointed their spears,
supplied them also with razors; for they made signs to one of our
gunners, who wore whiskers, to shave them with this sort of
glass.</p>
<p>The boats had orders to return about four o'clock. Their
departure seemed sensibly to affect the natives, who redoubled
their importunity in soliciting us to land in their island. All
the women came to the beach, and joined their invitations to
those of the men. They were, no doubt, much surprised that they
had not more success; but the order had been given, and our boats
could not delay their departure.</p>
<p>It was with regret that we left those people, at the moment
when they had launched several canoes, loaded with cocoa nuts,
and were bringing them to us. The delicious water of those
fruits, would have been of the greatest utility in stopping the
progress of the scurvy, which had already begun its ravages in
both the ships. If our boats could have stopped some minutes,
they would have procured a great number of them.</p>
<p>The satisfaction with which those islanders received nails,
and other articles of iron, and the anxiety they showed to obtain
them, were proofs that they were acquainted with that metal.</p>
<p>Those people, at first, manifested every appearance of good
faith; but they discovered their inclination to theft, as soon as
they thought themselves certain of impunity. We had occasion to
observe, that those who were the most advanced in years were the
boldest thieves.</p>
<p>That little island, which is nearly circular, is about 25,000
toises in diameter, and is situated in 2&deg; 18' S. lat., and
145&deg; 46' E. long. It is extremely populous; for we saw about
three hundred of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The white appearance of several places of the island, where
fractures discovered the strata, gave me reason to believe, that
its base is of a calcareous nature, like the greater part of the
South Sea islands.</p>
<p>As soon as the boats were hoisted on board, we directed our
course towards the E.&frac14;N.E.</p>
<p>30th. The next day we got to the northward of the Admiralty
Islands. There we perceived, that an extensive mountainous island
occupies the centre of the group, the circumference of which
consists of a great number of little flat islands, which seem to
have emerged from the bosom of the ocean, at no very distant
period. Almost all of them are connected together by reefs and
sand banks.</p>
<p>About sun-set, we were 8,000 toises to the north-east of the
little islands which were nearest to the principal one.</p>
<p>31st. As soon as day-light appeared, we steered W.S.W.
standing in for the land. Some canoes, which a very high sail
made to loom large, appeared at a distance.</p>
<p>We were to leeward of those islands, in a large bay, formed by
their curvatures, and a short distance from the land. We sounded
several times, with sixty-eight fathoms of line, but found no
bottom.</p>
<p>There were many cocoa-nut trees on most of the little islands.
A great concourse of natives came upon the beach, and some of
them advanced as far as the adjoining reefs. The little islands
where there were no cocoa-nut trees, did not seem to be
inhabited; for we saw not a single savage upon them.</p>
<p>Several canoes were launched, many still lay on the sand, and
six, which had set sail, were making towards our ship. We
immediately lay to, in order to receive them. Some of them were
manned with seven natives, and others with nine. Having come
within 300 toises of our ship, they furled their sail, and used
the paddle to make a nearer approach. Each canoe had a commander,
who stood on a platform, and gave his orders. When the canoes had
paddled about 150 toises, they stopped, and from that distance
one of the chiefs addressed us in a speech. His eloquence was
wholly lost on us; but the signs with which it was accompanied,
did not allow us to doubt that he wished to induce us to land.
Probably the paddlers were not permitted to speak; but they
joined their signs of invitation to those of the chief.</p>
<p>We endeavoured, on our part, to prevail on them to come nearer
our ship. They could not refill the sight of our large pieces of
red stuff; and, after appearing to deliberate upon the case, they
advanced a little.</p>
<p>Some of our officers imagining that the sound of the bells
would be agreeable them, they were immediately rung; but, as
several persons had foreseen, the noise, instead of attracting
the savages, made them take to flight. They were induced,
however, to return, by the sight of several flags which we waved,
and by some tunes played by our fiddler.</p>
<p>Presents might procure us their confidence. We therefore threw
them an empty bottle, which we supposed they would immediately
seize upon. But they appeared to look upon it as a fatal gift;
for they paid no other attention to it than to keep at a distance
from it.</p>
<p>Nails and knives which were floated to them upon a board,
occasioned loud expressions of joy, when the savage who took them
up showed them to his companions. It appeared then, that those
natives were acquainted with the use of iron.</p>
<p>None of them had hitherto ventured to touch the bottle; but
the presents having won their confidence, one of them took
possession of it, and cut the string by which it was held, with a
piece of volcanic glass.</p>
<p>The natives now made no difficulty of coming alongside of the
ship, but would not consent to come on board. The number of
canoes by degrees increased, and our barter was carried on with
the greatest fairness imaginable. We even saw some of those
people, who were pushed at a distance from the ship, by the
concourse of canoes, before they could give us the article which
they had agreed to exchange for that which they had received,
making their utmost efforts for that purpose. They carefully
sought for the persons to whom they were indebted; and some of
them, after an interval of half an hour, came and delivered us
the articles which they owed.</p>

<b>PLATE III. <i>Savage of the Admiralty Islands</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>[In this place the Author has minutely described a singular
custom which prevails among the natives, who, according to him,
cover certain parts of their bodies with a white shell,
denominated <i>bulla ovum</i>, (See Plate III.) which, however,
they appeared willing to dispose of. Delicacy forbids the
Translator from entering either into a description of the shell,
or of its uses.]</p>
<p>The great number of canoes with which we were surrounded,
prevented many of them from approaching the ship; but some of the
canoemen swam towards us with the objects of their barter. Those
islanders preferred, to every thing that we offered them, bits of
iron in whatever form they happened to be. They so well
distinguished that metal from all other substances, that they
recognized it, even when coated with rust.</p>
<p>I thought that habit must have rendered those people excellent
swimmers. But their movements were too precipitate; though they
differed in no other respect from our good European swimmers.
They needed not, however, to have made great efforts to support
themselves in the water; for, by keeping their mouths shut, they
immersed a part of the head. Several supported themselves in the
water, by the motion of their feet only, till they tied to our
ropes, the articles which they wished to barter.</p>
<p>If we may judge of the character of those natives, by their
conduct towards us, their dispositions were excellent; an air of
goodness was expressed in their features. Very different from the
savages of the little island, which we had visited two days
before, they gave us proofs of great probity. It was surprising
to meet with so great a difference in the manners of savages, so
little removed from each other, and who practised the same arts.
The disparity of their conduct towards us might have proceeded
from this; that the savages of the little island had dealt only
with boats, whereas the others did business with large ships,
which inspired respect.</p>
<p>The commanders of the canoes commonly made the paddlers
surrender the articles which we had given them. We saw with pain,
that they sometimes employed violence for this purpose. One of
those poor people had received from us a bit of red serge, which
he was not willing to deliver to one of the chiefs; but the
latter forced it from him, by repeated blows with his cudgel.</p>
<p>At the same time, one of the islanders, in another canoe, was
treated with similar harshness, by one of the chiefs, because the
poor wretch had allowed his attention to be occupied in
contemplating our ships, and had forgotten to bale the water out
of the canoe.</p>
<p>The natives who swam towards us, in order to exchange their
commodities, were considered as competitors, and soon excited the
jealousy of those in the canoes which surrounded the ship. These
last took great care to preserve their situation; they
endeavoured to keep off the swimmers, and would not allow them to
rest, by taking hold of their canoes. The swimmers, being thus
obliged to move about continually, in carrying on their barter
gave a great deal of activity to this singular scene of
commerce.</p>
<p>These natives, like those whom we had seen two days before,
preferred nails to knives.</p>
<p>Several had in their hands calabashes of different shapes,
filled with lime very finely pulverized. Others had their lime in
pieces of bamboo. One of these last, who had a spoon in the shape
of a spatula, filled it with lime, which he showed to us, no
doubt by way of recommending its qualities. By making many
motions with his mouth, and greatly inflating his cheeks, he
seemed desirous to persuade us, that his lime produced very
agreeable sensations.</p>
<p>Another chief had a little parcel of the leaves of the pepper
tree, <i>piper firiboa</i>, Linn.</p>
<p>They probably chew them without the addition of arec nuts; for
we saw in their mouths none of the marks which are produced by
the mastication of betel. We observed those articles of luxury
only in the possession of the chiefs, for whom they are probably
reserved.</p>
<p>Some of those savages wore bracelets formed of large shells,
among which we observed sea ears, ground in the middle and the
edges.</p>
<p>Most of them had different kinds of shells appended to the
inferior lobes of their ears, which, when pierced, they are in
the habit of extending so prodigiously, that they descend lower
than their shoulders; as appears in Plate III. It seemed that
they produced this great distension, by introducing elastic hoops
into the holes. The only child we saw was furnished with two inch
hoops.</p>
<p>Their hair is crisped and black; but they frequently render it
red with a mixture of ochre and oil, and sometimes they tie it up
with a fillet of bark. Their skin is a light black, which they
sometimes adorn with red figures in different parts of the
body.</p>
<p>They carried neither bows nor clubs but only spears, from
about five feet to six feet and a half in length. (See Plate
XXVIII. Fig. 25.) The vitreous volcanic lava, of which their
heads were formed, was ground to a sharp edge on each side, about
three inches in length, and fastened with a string, coated with a
kind of mastic.</p>
<p>This weapon must be dangerous among a people who wear no
cloaths. Their skin, constantly exposed, must be ill able to
resist so sharp a piece of glass, especially in places where it
has a little tension.</p>
<p>This volcanic glass is perhaps not very common in the
Admiralty Islands; for some of those savages had spears armed
with sharp pieces of wood instead of glass.</p>
<p>Many had the <i>septum</i> of the nose pierced with a hole,
which contained a string, to the extremities of which were
suspended dogs' teeth twice as long as human ones. One of them,
wishing to part with this ornament, a chief, in cutting the
string aukwardly, which was too short, with a piece of volcanic
glass, wounded the native.</p>
<p>An order issued by the General very much interrupted this
bartering trade; although the natives fill had a great many
things which they wished to dispose of. One of the chiefs very
much amused us with his calabash of lime, the properties of which
he displayed with many ostentatious airs, thinking, no doubt,
thereby to enhance its price. His gestures might have been
considered, as a happy imitation of those of our most dextrous
mountebank doctors.</p>
<p>We did not observe among those islanders any articles of
European origin. As by this time, we bought scarcely any thing,
they quitted our ship, and carried the rest of their manufactures
alongside of the Esperance.</p>
<p>Their canoes are formed of the excavated trunk of a tree, with
boards fitted to its sides. Their length is thirty-two feet, and
their extreme breadth not more than twenty-six inches. Their
sides are supported internally by cross boards, which form so
many divisions, in the bottoms of which are the paddlers, towards
the two extremities of the canoe.</p>
<p>Those canoes are furnished with an outrigger, about thirteen
feet in length, which projects laterally and nearly at the same
distance. On the opposite side is a counter-outrigger, which does
not take the water, and which is eight feet in length. It serves
as a place upon which to lay the sail; the commander sometimes
sits upon it but his station is commonly on an elevated platform
or trellis, of the same extent as the outrigger.</p>
<p>The sail is a mat, in the form of a regular square, 13 feet in
the side. Two opposite sides of it are fastened to poles of the
same length, which serve for yards. When the sail is set, one of
its diagonals is always vertical, and its upper angle is elevated
three feet above the top of the mast, which is about twenty feet
in height. The wind as strongly upon so lofty a sail, and gives
to those canoes an impulse, which makes them plough the water
with astonishing rapidity.</p>
<p>When this swift motion is not required, they only hoist about
five feet of one side of their sail in a horizontal position,
while the rest of it lies on the canoe. But in this way they can
only sail right before the wind.</p>
<p>Their paddles are very broad, and are furnished with a handle
six feet and a half in length. They use them as our sailors do
their oars; for they act like levers, whose point of support is
on one side of the canoe. The steersman is stationed in the
stern, and directs the canoe with his paddle.</p>
<p>After lying to till half past ten in the morning, we continued
to follow the coast in a westerly direction. It is every where
bordered with islands connected together by reefs. We observed,
beyond those reefs, several fishing places, constructed with
stakes fixed in the bottom, at a certain distance from the beach,
and which resembled those which we afterwards saw in the
Moluccas.</p>
<p>As soon as we set sail, the canoes followed our example, in
order to accompany us. We admired the celerity with which that
flotilla clave the waters. Although we had a very fresh breeze,
and a great deal of sail set, those little vessels sailed a great
deal faster than our ships.</p>
<p>Close to a fishing place, much larger than any that we had
seen, were seventeen canoes which immediately paddled towards us.
We hove to, in order to wait for them; but as, notwithstanding
our invitations, they remained at the distance of five hundred
toises from our ship, we returned our course, directing, it to
the W.S.W.</p>
<p>At the close of the day, two canoes pushed off from the shore,
and advanced towards us. It was night before they came within
hearing. One of the commanders immediately addressed us in an
elevated voice. It is proper to observe, that the voices of those
natives are very shrill. As it was almost quite calm, we
endeavoured to allure them to the ship; but they durst not
venture near enough to receive our presents.</p>
<p>It was imagined that a squib would be a pleasing spectacle to
them; but on the contrary it terrified them so much, that they
retreated with precipitation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the darkness of the night, those two canoes,
guided by our lights, returned towards us. We sent them some
articles of hardware, upon a board along with a lighted taper.
The light, which we soon left at a distance, engrossed their
whole attention; but they durst not come nearer to it than about
200 toises. It was amusing enough to hear the two chiefs address
long speeches to the taper. They spoke with much warmth,
supposing, no doubt, that one of us was coming towards them with
this light. Chagrined, perhaps, at its silence, which formed so
dire a contrast to their babbling noise, they returned in about
two hours towards their island. Fires were all the while kept
burning upon the beach, perhaps to show the canoes the place to
which they were to return.</p>
<p>We lay to all the night.</p>
<p>AUGUST 1st. In the morning we saw the western extremity of
that little insular group, which extends about fifteen leagues
from east to west. The most western island is in 2&deg; 11' 36"
south latitude, and in 143&deg; 47' 38" east longitude.</p>
<p>Reefs and sand-banks extended beyond them 8,000 toises towards
the south-west.</p>
<p>We soon came in sight of other reefs, which were 5,000 toises
in extent from east to west. They are situated in 2&deg; 13'
south latitude, and 143&deg; 40' east longitude.</p>
<p>We carried a little sail towards W.N.W. during the night.</p>
<p>At day-break we had sight of the Hermit islands, discovered in
1781, by the Spanish frigate the Princessa, which saw them at the
distance of about 25,000 toises. Their high lands seemed, at a
distance, to leave intervals between them sufficient to afford us
a passage; but we soon perceived their lowlands advancing into
the sea, and distinguished the reefs which connected them
together.</p>
<p>That little cluster is composed of thirteen small islands,
having in the middle, like the Admiralty Islands, a principal
one, extending from south-west to north-east by east, about
15,000 toises. The islets which surround it on all sides, except
the south, are very small and very low.</p>
<p>We were 10,000 toises to the northward of those islands, and
to the leeward of the northern point of the great island, when we
saw some canoes under sail. They were behind the reefs, in which
we saw no opening through which they could pass, and we believed
that they could not surmount such obstacles; but, having come
close to the reefs, they took in their sail, and, going into the
water, they carried their vessels fairly over the rocks into the
open sea.</p>
<p>The canoe which was first got over steered towards our ship,
and the rest, being five in number, presently followed; but as
their motions were slow, they were soon nearer to the Esperance,
which was in our wake, and they advanced towards her. After
manoeuvring with much intelligence to bring their sail into a
proper position, they still chose to keep at the distance of
about 100 toises. All the means employed to bring them alongside
were ineffectual; but they went near enough to throw some apples
of the <i>spondias cytherea</i>, and several other fruits of
different species of the <i>eugenia</i>, all very proper to be
eaten. The bottles and bits of stuff given to them were received
with marks of the greatest satisfaction; but it was surprizing to
observe that they had little value for iron.</p>
<p>Like all the other natives we had hitherto met with, they
appeared extremely desirous that we should land on their
island.</p>
<p>One of the canoes advanced towards our ship, while the rest
returned to the shore. Notwithstanding our invitations, those
natives kept at the distance of 150 toises from us. They durst
not touch the different articles which we sent them with a view
to gain their confidence. Some, however, appeared desirous that
their canoe should be steered towards our presents in order to
get possession of them; but the sentiment of fear prevailed among
the majority.</p>
<p>It was noon before we resumed our course. All the canoes
followed is for some time before they returned to our island.
That which approached the nearest to our ship accompanied us with
the greatest perseverance. It was a very large canoe, manned by
thirty people, who all appeared more robust than the inhabitants
of the Admiralty Islands, and of the same complexion.</p>
<p>Those natives advanced towards us with very pacific views; for
they were not furnished with arms; and, from on board the
Esperance, to which they approached much nearer than to our ship,
no weapons were observed even in the bottoms of the canoes.
Perhaps they thought that by this means they might induce us to
land.</p>
<p>Those canoes, though similar in appearance to those of the
Admiralty Islands, were not nearly such good sailors. That which
came nearly to us had at first but one sail; but they set another
abaft it, in order to follow us. This after-sail was much smaller
than the forward one; and they were both in the form of a
rectangle, the length of which was almost double its breadth.
They were trimmed like the square sails of our long boats.</p>
<p>Their large sail was as much raised as that of the canoes we
saw at the Admiralty Islands, and descended lower, so as to offer
a greater surface to the wind.</p>
<p>The whole of the Hermit Islands, including the reefs, occupy a
space about twelve leagues in circuit, the centre of which is in
1&deg; 35' 38" south latitude, and 142&deg; 41' east
longitude.</p>
<p>In the evening we were very near the most eastern of that
little group, to which General Bougainville gave the name of
Exchequer Islands.</p>
<p>It is very low, and only nine leagues W. of the Hermit
Islands. The reefs on its northwest side form a basin, in which
there appeared to be water sufficient for anchoring.</p>
<p>A great number of other islands were seen from north to
west.</p>
<p>We made but little sail during the night, while tacking in
order to keep to windward of those islands.</p>
<p>3d. At day-break the most easterly of the Exchequer Islands
bore south, distant 5,000 toises. It is in 1&deg; 29' of south
latitude, and 142&deg; 26' of east longitude.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock a.m. we steered towards the west; and we
already reckoned thirty little islands from the N.N.E. to the
W.S.W.</p>
<p>We steered for that which appeared to be the most westerly, to
which we approached within about 2,500 toises. It is in 1&deg;
34' south latitude, and 142&deg; 10' east longitude.</p>
<p>All those islands are connected together by reefs, which seem
to deny all passage. They are very low, and covered with very
lofty trees.</p>
<p>More islands came into view as we advanced and at last we had
sight of the most south-westerly island of that little cluster,
which is not connected to the rest by any reef. It is in lat
1&deg; 39' S. and in long. 141&deg; 58' E.</p>
<p>We lay to during the whole night.</p>
<p>4th. This morning, we saw, towards the south, a low and very
woody island, about 8,000 toises in extent. This new island was
in 1&deg; 31' S. lat. and 140&deg; 47' E. longitude.</p>
<p>We soon discovered another island, still less than, and to the
S.W. of, the former, from which it is 15,000 toises. It is
equally low, and covered with large trees.</p>
<p>On those low islands near the Equator, the trees grow with
astonishing rapidity and vigour;* as the atmosphere furnishes
them at once with extreme heat and moisture.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This is more particularly true of tree, which
are of a spongy texture, as the silk cotton tree, <i>bombax</i>,
the sand-box tree, <i>hura</i>, &amp;c. But many of the hard
woods, for example, the <i>lignum vit&aelig;</i>, or
<i>gujacum</i>, grow very slowly, and, hence have been almost
extirpated, in all the tropical islands, fully inhabited by
Europeans.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>Although we had been, for some days, very near the Line, and
found the heat suffocating, the thermometer had not yet risen
above 24&frac12;&deg;.</p>
<p>We saw large trees floating, which had been detached from the
low islands by the waves. One of those trees adhering to the prow
of our ship, for some time retarded her motion.</p>
<p>8th. At five o'clock p.m. being upon the Equator, in 135&deg;
4' E. long, we saw a very considerable water-spout, forming in
the south-west, at the distance of about 2,000 toises; although
the air about us was very tranquil, the waves were foaming with
agitation, at the place where the water-spout originated, over
which a very small cloud hovered, apparently at the distance of a
few feet. This ph&oelig;nomenon was in the form of two very
elongated cones, joined at their summits, the base of one being
upon the sea, and that of the other lost in a very thick
cloud.</p>
<p>The clouds appeared to me to be agitated by a whirlwind, which
having held a great quantity of water suspended, discharged it
again in torrents. Perhaps all water-spouts are formed in this
manner. If, as some natural philosophers alledge, a water-spout
carried up the sea-water; in a great body, it ought to be as salt
in the moment of it descent, as in that of its ascent, which does
not seem to accord with observation. A person, worthy of credit,
who saw two water-spouts fall upon a vessel, assured me that they
discharged fresh water. On the contrary supposition, it would not
be easy to explain this ph&oelig;nomenon.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is not very easy to give a satisfactory
explanation of this ph&oelig;nomenon, upon any principles; though
those of electricity seem to afford, or rather to promise, the
most probable solution of it.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>9th. The limpidity of the sea-water was very much diminished,
during this day, by a <i>fucus</i>, the filaments of which were
very close and short. I met with it again on the 6th of
September, and shall afterwards speak of it more
particularly.</p>
<p>We found sharks very numerous in those parts. We caught
several of the species <i>squalus carcharias</i>, which is the
most extensively diffused through the ocean. One of them, of a
moderate size, astonished us by its voracity. Although lacerated
by four hooks, which it had taken within the space of half an
hour, it followed us, till it was hooked successfully.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** I knew a similar influence, in one of those
monsters, which was eighteen feet in length. It was supposed to
be the same which had devoured a man, some days before it was
taken. Its liver hung up in a net dropped about ten gallons of
oil.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>Being near New Guinea, and but eight minutes distant from the
Line, the thermometer only indicated 25&deg;, although we
suffered a heat much more oppressive than that which is
experienced in Europe, when the thermometer is at the same
elevation.*** In observing that that instrument is a very
uncertain measure of sensible heat, I ought to apprize the reader
that <i>I always speak of the mercurial thermometer of
Reaumur</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** I have very sensibly experienced the same
effect myself. Is it owing to the greater quantity of water,
which the air, <i>constantly heated</i>, holds in solution in
tropical climates?&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>11th, This day, the Esperance ran foul of us, being the sixth
accident of this kind, since we left Europe. She broke the foot
rope of her sprit-sail yard, on the fore part of our rigging.
Fortunately we kept the frigates asunder, by placing a boom
between them. As it was a dead calm, we put out two boats, to tow
the ships still farther from each other.* The boats, at the same
time, observed the direction of the current, which carried us to
the N.N.E. at the rate of half a knot in the hour.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The difficulty of keeping ships asunder in a
calm, is commonly, and very properly, given as an instance of the
mutual attraction of bodies.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>12th. At day-break, we had sight of the largest of Schouten's
Islands, bearing S.S.W.</p>
<p>The surface of the water was violently agitated, in a large
space, through which the Esperance had occasion to pass, in
prosecuting her course. Fearing that it was caused by breakers,
she put about; but the deception soon ceased. This motion was
produced by a large shoal of fishes, swimming near the surface,
and which was pursued by a great number of birds.</p>
<p>Although it was now the season of the eastern monsoon, the
winds blew, for four days, from the south-west to the north-west;
but on the 14th, they resumed their south-east direction.</p>
<p>The same day, we saw a little island, very near New Guinea,
and which is 10,000 toises distant from the island of Providence.
That little island is in 2&deg; 18' 48" S. lat. and 133&deg; 8'
47" E. longitude.</p>
<p>The incessant and great heats in those latitudes, accelerated
the decomposition of our water, which was so much the worse, as
that to the use of which we were by that time reduced, was
somewhat brackish. For the water, which we first took in at
Carteret harbour, was taken up too near the sea, and had been
preserved, notwithstanding its bad quality. Besides, that the
ballast may not be diminished, it is usual to fill the empty
butts with salt-water, which ought to be well rinsed out, before
they are again filled with fresh. But the boatswain's mate, who
had the charge of the water, did not take so much trouble. It was
easy to free the water from its inflammable air, by the machine,
which I have already described; but it always retained a brackish
taste.</p>
<p>18th. A storm had howled, for a part of the night, on the
coast of New Guinea, and had given us a great quantity of rain.
The sky seemed, to announce a tempest; but the storms, near the
Equator, are more menacing, than really formidable,* and we soon
enjoyed a very clear sky.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Should not the Author have excepted, at least,
the hurricanes at Amboyna, mentioned below (Oct. 14.) not to
speak of those, which too often rage in the West
Indies?&mdash;<i>Trans</i>.]</p>
<p>We saw a fine chain of mountains which ranged towards the
east. The highest of them appeared to be at least 750 toises in
perpendicular altitude. The large trees, with which they were
covered, added greatly to the picturesque appearance of the
country.</p>
<p>19th. Being in 0&deg; south latitude, and 430&deg; [sic] 52'
east longitude and 1,000 toises distant from New Guinea, we
sounded with one hundred fathoms of line, but found no
bottom.</p>
<p>The first indication we had of the inhabitants of that island,
was the smoke of two fires, which rose from among the large trees
near the coast.</p>
<p>We were then near the promontory of New Guinea, which is
called the Cape of Good Hope, and which we doubled at the
distance of 1,000 toises. It is 0&deg; 20' south latitude, and
130&deg; 34' east longitude. We were surprized that Forest, in
other respects an accurate navigator, should have so much
mistaken its true latitude; for that which he gave, differed from
ours more than 20' towards the north.</p>
<p>The variation of the compass, after a gradual diminution was
now but 1&deg; 30' east.</p>
<p>We were prevented by calms from coasting along New Guinea,
till a sea-breeze sprang up, about three o'clock p.m. The shore
was generally broken broken and rocky, but we observed some sandy
spots, of a gentle declivity, which presented convenient landing
places.</p>
<p>21st. On the morning of this day we were very near the two
little islands of Miss Palu. The least of them is in 0&deg; 20'
south latitude, and in 130&deg; 7' east longitude. The largest is
in 0&deg; 19' 57" south latitude, and 130&deg; 4' 30" east
longitude.</p>
<p>23d. We steered close to the shore of New Guinea, with an
intention to enter among the Moluccas, by Watson's Strait. It
would have been agreeable to us to explore that strait, which is
much less frequented than those further to the westward. Besides,
we would have had the advantage of keeping more to the windward,
than by passing through Pitt's Straits, which the continuation of
the south winds induced us to take.</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock in the morning, being to the north-west,
and very near it, we found that we were upon a shoal, which
extends more than 5,000 toises from the coast of Bantana. We were
strongly intangled in it, when the lead indicated eight fathoms
water, rocky bottom. It was a bank of coral, which the
transparency of the water displayed in all its whiteness. We were
obliged to go about, in order to extricate ourselves from so
dangerous a situation.</p>
<p>We entered the straits about half an hour past two p.m. A
canoe which we saw at the entrance near the coast of Bantana, at
one time appeared to us to be making for the Esperance but it
soon hastened towards the land.</p>
<p>Having lain to for some time to wait for the Esperance, we
observed that the current carried us very rapidly through the
strait. The tides very much influence those currents, which,
about midnight, and early the next morning, were very
considerably abated.</p>
<p>Five canoes were sailing along the eastern shore, at a good
distance from one another. We observed, that one of them had a
flag hoisted, which we took to be Portuguese. The wind was
carrying us towards the coast of Salwaty, and hindered us from
steering for those canoes. Besides, none of them seemed
inclinable to meet us. These people did not know our intentions;
and perhaps they were apprehensive that we were of the number of
those Europeans, whose avarice induces them to employ every
stratagem to entrap them, in order to make slaves of them.</p>
<p>High lands, every where covered with large trees, border the
Straits of Pitt.</p>
<p>We lay to all night. At nine o'clock we heard from the western
shore the voice of some natives, who seemed to address us. At the
same time a fire appeared on the western point of the entrance,
about the place from whence a canoe came off, when we entered the
strait.</p>
<p>24th. At day break we were very near Passage Island, and we
observed on the coast of Bantana, a little village, the
inhabitants of which seemed to view us with much
indifference.</p>
<p>The Strait of Pitt extends about 2,5000 toises from W.S.W. to
E.N.E., and its mean breadth is about 5,000 toises. On heaving
the lead from on board our ship, no bottom was found with
seventy-five fathoms of line. But the boat, at 100 toises from
the shore, had from fifteen to eighteen fathoms of water, the
bottom being calcareous rock.</p>
<p>We went about, in order to avoid some shoals which we
observed, on leaving the strait, very near the coast of Bantana.
But several persons were of opinion, that there was water enough
to carry over both the ships.</p>
<p>The opening of the strait on this end is near 15,000 toises in
breadth. We observed in it two little islands, very near the
Bantana shore.</p>
<p>The western point of Salwaty was found in 1&deg; 2' 10" S.
lat., and 128&deg; 32' E. longitude.</p>
<p>The constancy of the wind from S.S.E. deprived us of all hope
of getting round Mixoal island to the eastward. We were therefore
obliged to endeavour to make the north of Ceram, in order to get
round, by the western extremity of that island, to Amboyna.</p>
<p>About six o'clock p.m. we were 15,000 toises distant from the
island of Popo, which bore S. 6&deg; W.</p>
<p>The next day we steered with that island on our starboard,
distant about 8,000 toises. It presented a flat surface, in the
midst of which rose three hills, near one another. We had a near
view of same little islands to the south-west, and which extend
nearly from the north-east, to the southwest.</p>
<p>The island of Popo is in 1&deg; 9" 44" S. lat., and 127&deg;
40' E. longitude.</p>
<p>We saw the islands of Canary and Mixoal, with part of the
little islands which surround them.</p>
<p>This morning we lost a young sailor of the name of Pichot, who
died in a state of <i>marasmus</i>, the consequence of a
dysentery, under which he had laboured for six months.</p>
<p>26th. This day the position of Canary Island was found to be
in 1&deg; 51' 36" S. lat., and 127&deg; 35' E. longitude.</p>
<p>27th. Our ship was this day surrounded with a kind of whales,
which were from twenty to twenty-five feet in length. They were
sufficiently numerous to afford fishers, by their oil, an ample
compensation for their labour and expence.</p>
<p>29th. Very early this morning we came in sight of the lofty
mountains of Ceram, which extending from the S.E. to the S.S.W.,
presented us with a very fine landscape.</p>
<p>Such high mountains afford effectual protection to the
independence of their inhabitants. Hence it is, that only a small
number of the natives settled on low parts of the island, near
the sea, endure the tyranny of the Dutch.</p>
<p>SEPTEMBER 1st. The clouds having been entirely dissipated from
the land of Ceram, we enjoyed the magnificent prospect of several
chains of mountains running parallel to each other, in the
direction of east and west. The fine valleys which separate them,
support a luxuriant vegetation, and have the appearance of the
greatest fertility.</p>
<p>We observed many sites on the island of Ceram, some of them
upon one of the highest mountains, which proves that their
summits are frequented by the natives. That mountain appeared to
us to be at least 1,200 toises in perpendicular elevation.</p>
<p>Availing ourselves of the calm, we sent a boat to ascertain
the direction of the current, which then set to the
N.E.&frac14;E. at the rate of three quarters of a knot in the
hour. As, among those islands, the currents depend very much upon
the tides, it may be supposed that their force and their
direction vary extremely.</p>
<p>On the approach of night we were about 1,000 toises from the
coast of Ceram, which becoming less elevated, seemed to indicate
less depth of water on its coast. The lead, however, did not
reach the bottom with thirty-seven fathoms of line.</p>
<p>Soon after this, we saw on the land side, several fires, which
appeared to have been kindled by fishermen, in order to decoy the
fish.</p>
<p>2d. About noon we descried the island of Bonoa, extending from
W. 20&deg; S. to S. 48&deg; W. at the distance of near 20,000
toises. That island is in 2&deg; 58' S. lat., and 125&deg; 56' E.
longitude.</p>
<p>We took care frequently to heave the lead, when we were near
the land; but we had no soundings with sixty-six fathoms of
line.</p>
<p>In the evening, a strong land breeze carried us into the
channel between the islands of Ceram and Bonoa, in which, by moon
light, we observed three small islands. Although it was quite
calm, the current carried us almost to the other extremity of the
channel.</p>
<p>About midnight, while the air scarcely moved, the waves which
foamed very near our ship, made us apprehensive that we were
approaching to breakers. But our alarm was of short continuance,
having been only occasioned by the rapid current of the tide,
which followed the direction of the channel, and opposed our
progress.</p>
<p>5th. We were at a small distance from Kilang. The General
intended to pass between that island and Ceram; but the channel,
which at best is but strait, appeared to be additionally
obstructed by reefs and a sand bank. We therefore made good our
passage, very close to the westward of Kilang. The country
presented beautiful plantations of cocoa-nut and banana trees,
encircling a charming village.</p>
<p>We then continued our course between Kilang and Manipa.</p>
<p>About eleven o'clock a.m. the current of the tide raised a
rapid succession of waves, tumbling over each other, in wild
conflict. We were, in fact, several times witnesses of that
ph&oelig;nomenon, which Dampier and Bougainville compare to the
current of a large and very rapid river.</p>
<p>About four p.m. we had doubled the island of Manipa, which is
not more than 2,500 toises, in extent from north to south. Though
very mountainous, that island appeared to be populous, and many
canoes were plying along its shore. Its latitude is 3&deg; 21'
S., and its longitude 125&deg; 47' E.</p>
<p>The island of Kilang is in latitude 3&deg; 17' S. and
longitude 125&deg; 31' E.</p>
<p>4th. A breeze which arose in the offing, at ten o'clock a.m.
favoured our progress towards the south; and we soon had sight of
a part of the west coast of Amboyna, bearing S.S.E.</p>
<p>The south wind afterwards opposed us, and obliged us to
tack.</p>
<p>5th. A very fresh breeze from the south-east put an end to our
hopes of gaining our intended anchoring place this day. Our
scorbutic patients, whose number was rapidly increasing, and
whose condition became daily more alarming, made us ardently with
for a favourable wind. Their disorder had been greatly influenced
by the perpetual rains at Carteret harbour; and most of them were
afflicted with great pains in the loins.</p>
<p>One of their first symptoms was the appearance of whitish
tubercles, frequently as large as a pullet's egg, in different
parts of the body, particularly on the arms, and which were
commonly succeeded by others on the lower extremities.</p>
<p>It was remarkable that the skins of those patients were not
discoloured with what are called scurvy spots, as that disease,
in hot climates, rapidly suffuses the cellular membrane with a
lymphatic humour, which scarcely alters the colour of the
skin.</p>
<p>I must farther observe, that, although salted provisions be
one of the principal causes of the sea-scurvy, yet two of our
men, who did not subsist on such provisions, were violently
attacked by that disorder. But one of them worked in the hold,
the humid and spoiled air of which is a powerful cause of the
malady.</p>
<p>By means of tacking, we came near enough the western extremity
of Amboyna, to allow us to enter the road in the night. By the
direction of Valentin's plan of it, we kept along its eastern
side, at the distance of about 510 toises.</p>
<p>As soon as we had passed Portuguese-bay, we brought to, and
waited till day light should discover to us a proper place to
anchor in.</p>
<p>6th. The Esperance had not made such progress as our ship; but
was 5,100 toises to the south-west of us, at seven o'clock this
morning, when we were within a small distance of the principal
establishment in the island.</p>
<p>Here I met with the <i>fucus</i>, which I had before observed
near New Guinea. It resembled very fine tow, crossed by little
pieces, somewhat more than an inch in length; the filaments are
as fine as hairs. They are frequently seen united into a sort of
bundles, and are so numerous that they sully the water in the
road.</p>
<p>General Dentrecasteaux sent his second lieutenant to wait upon
the Governor of Amboyna, in order to ask permission to stop at
his island. The Governor immediately summoned the Council, and
gave us leave to come to an anchor; but, as the act which the
second lieutenant presented to them, in the name of the
Commander, had not yet been communicated to them by the
government of Batavia, they were inclined to impose conditions on
us, to which we could not consent. Yet it was not difficult to
make them sensible, that we had anticipated, by several months,
the arrival of their dispatches from Europe, which seldom reach
Amboyna, till eighteen months after their date. It appeared to
us, that their caution originated in the desire of saving
themselves from being blamed by the government of Batavia, to
which that of Amboyna is subordinate; for as soon as they had
adopted regulations in that respect, they rendered us every
service in their power.</p>
<p>We found that little island much better provided than we could
have expected, with every article necessary for the prosecution
of our voyage.</p>
<p>A captain in the service of the Dutch East India Company was
sent by the Governor, to point out to us a proper anchoring
place; and having made some tacks, we let go our anchor about
half an hour past one p.m. in twenty-five fathoms water, bottom
mud and sand. The tower of Victory Fort bore from us E. 9&deg; N.
the nearest redoubt W. 35&deg; S. and the western point of the
entrance of the road, W. 26&deg; 30' S. We were about 340 toises
from the landing place, a wooden wharf, near which there is water
for large ships. One of the Company's ships then lay at it,
taking in a cargo of cloves.</p>
<p>At the same time there were in the road eighteen vessels under
Dutch colours; but only one ship: most of the rest were brigs and
sloops.</p>
<p>The Esperance came to an anchor half an hour after us, and
bore N.E.&frac14;N. of our position.</p>

<p>AT half an hour past three o'clock we saluted the place with
nine guns, and the same number was immediately returned.</p>
<p>The Commander had engaged all his officers to accompany him,
about five in the evening, on a visit to the Governor. As I knew
nothing of this appointment, I landed, along with some persons
belonging to our ship, to view the town. It is encircled with
gardens, in which trees are chiefly cultivated; because they
savour the indolence natural to man in a sultry climate, and
afford him a profusion of fruits, with little other trouble than
that of gathering them.</p>
<p>Besides the kind of wild bread-fruit tree which we met with
there, the inhabitants allured us that there was another which
bore a fruit, the seeds of which all misgive; but that the fruit
was only of a middling size, and the tree did not produce a great
quantity of it.</p>
<p>Several kinds of banana trees, and many varieties of oranges
grow in those charming gardens; and they produce delicious
guavas, papaws, and different species of pineapples
(<i>anones</i>). We observed there same specimens of the
<i>lawsonia inermis</i>, which rose to the height of ten or
twelve feet.</p>
<p>Different odoriferous plants were profusely scattered around.
We there found the <i>chalcas paniculata</i>, the <i>michelia
champaea</i> and <i>tsiampaca</i>, and several species of the
<i>uvaria</i>. The Arabian jessamine, <i>nyctanthes sambac</i>,
rising amidst those charming trees, mixed its sweet odour with
their delightful perfumes.</p>
<p>On our return into the town, one of the protestant ministers
conducted us to his house, where he entertained us with several
sorts of spirituous liquors. But limpid water, just drawn from
the spring, was the most agreeable draught to persons, who had
long been confined to brackish water and salted provisions. This
excellent minister appeared to be much surprised at our being
regaled at so small an expence. He informed us that earthquakes
were frequent at Amboyna, and that some years ago one, among
others, had been very forcibly felt; that it was accompanied with
a hurricane which continued nearly three days, during which time
the sea had overflowed, and inundated the ground on which the
town is built.</p>
<p>This calamity is the most to be dreaded at the change of the
monsoons, and particularly at the commencement of the western
monsoon, which takes place, in those latitudes, in the month of
November.</p>
<p>7th. One of the cabin-boys, of the name of Gabriel Abalen, who
served the table of the marine officers, disappeared on the night
of the 7th. He had been observed to be on board all day; but
after dark was called several times in vain. He was a
good-natured young man, and in general very temperate; but,
during that day, had drunk so much strong liquor, as to justify
serious apprehensions concerning him. He probably fell overboard,
and it was known that he could not swim.</p>
<p>All of us had much need of remaining on shore, in order to
recover our strength; and the Governor gave us leave to take
lodgings in the town.</p>
<p>8th. It was a matter of importance to the naturalists to be
acquainted with the Governor of Amboyna, in order that he might
facilitate the researches which formed the object of their
mission. It was, no doubt, owing to pure forgetfulness, that the
Commander of our expedition did not make us acquainted with the
hour of his first visit to the Governor. But I requested him to
favour us with an introduction, and we accordingly let out for
that purpose, about half an hour past six. M. Bourguell&eacute;s
and M. Van Smiehl pressed themselves upon us as our
interpreters.</p>
<p>M. Van Smiehl was a German Baron, who had lately arrived in
the island. He was then but aspiring, as he expressed it, to be a
servant of the Dutch East India Company. In the sequel, we had
reason to felicitate ourselves that he had not much influence on
the Governor; for he had attempted to persuade him, that the
Regency of Batavia would not approve of our ships being allowed
to remain at Amboyna. Yet the Baron very well knew that, in the
preceding year, two small English vessels, fitted out at Bombay
for the Pelew Islands, had been received without the least
difficulty. They had first put in at Bourou; but, finding no
provisions there, had been permitted to ship some at Amboyna; and
those vessels were far from having so good a title as we had to
such indulgence. But, perhaps, the appearance of foreign vessels
in that road, for two years successively, made it necessary for
the Governor to take every precaution, in order to save his
responsibility. He received us very favourably; but we were
unhappy that he appeared in his ceremonial dress on our account;
for he was oppressed with heat, under a very heavy coat of black
velvet. Such garments are extremely incommodious near the Line,
but the Dutch Governors wear them, as a prerogative annexed to
their station.</p>
<p>Some refreshment was offered to us. I wished for nothing but
water, and I poured out that which appeared the most limpid; but
its saltish talk made me think that the domestics had, by
mistake, brought me some medicinal water. It was in fact
Seltzer-water, which the Dutch here usually drink as an agreeable
potation; and it costs them as much as the best rhenish wine.
Surely they were not aware of our repugnance to such a beverage;
yet they might have supposed that, in a torrid climate, and after
a long privation of fresh provisions, we would not be very fond
of swallowing salt water.</p>
<p>The General proposed to introduce us to the members of the
Council also, to which we readily assented; and they gave us a
very kind reception.</p>
<p>10th. As we intended to remain at Amboyna, for a month at the
least, I had conveyed to the place where we were to lodge, many
things necessary for the preparation of the different
productions, which I intended to coiled in the island. The other
naturalists and I had agreed to live in the same house. It was
already prepared for our reception, and our things had been
carried into it, when, to our great astonishment, we sound it
occupied by some officers from the two ships, who, however, knew
very well that we had taken the house; but the man who had the
key thought that they belonged to our party. The gentlemen made
themselves very merry with this pitiful trick, of which we did
not think them capable; but it was easy for us to find other
lodgings.</p>
<p>Our apprehensions respecting the cabin-boy, who had
disappeared three days before, were but too well founded. His
body had remained at the bottom of the water all that time; but,
about half an hour past two in the afternoon, it was seen
floating near the ship. This small distance from the place where
he had fallen into the sea seemed to prove, contrary to the
opinion of most of the Europeans settled at Amboyna, that the
rapidity of the currents in the road is confined to the surface
merely, and does not reach the bottom, a circumstance which, for
other reasons, appears to me very probable. In fact the currents
are determined by the tides, pouring their waters into and out of
the road, only to restore their equilibrium, which, in these
circumstances, is disturbed to but a small depth from the
surface.</p>
<p>This young man was much regretted by all the ship's company.
Many exclaimed against the carelessness of those, who had had the
charge of him in his early years, in neglecting to instruct him
in swimming. A few lessons in that art would have saved the lad's
life; and it is to be wished that his sate may serve as an
example to others; for I have observed with astonishment, that
many of the sailors cannot swim.</p>
<p>Our observatory was this day established, in the western part
of the town. As it could not be seen from the ship, it was found
inconvenient to be obliged to go upon the beach, in order to
compare the motion of the watches, with that of the clocks.</p>
<p>This western part of the town, in which we also resided,
formed the Chinese quarter, in which there are few natives of the
island, and only one Dutchman. The rest of the Dutch inhabit the
centre of the town, or its eastern part.</p>
<p>Our strength was so reduced, that we were obliged to content
ourselves, for some days, with short excursions from the
town.</p>
<p>We viewed the garden of the Company, where there is nothing
remarkable but a very convenient bath, which the Governor visited
regularly every third or fourth day. It is supplied with very
pure water from a neighbouring hill. Near it is another bath
appropriated to the use of the women.</p>
<p>The Dutch at Amboyna are in the habit of bathing every third
or fourth day, when they carefully avoid exposing themselves to
the excessive heat, which prevails from eleven in the morning
till three in the afternoon. Indeed they are seldom seen abroad
during those hours on other days. For our parts, we had not
leisure to take so many precautions; and accordingly two of the
naturalists were attacked with dangerous disorders.</p>
<p>We many times endeavoured to penetrate into the large
plantations of sago trees; but the water with which they are
floated often forced us to abandon the attempt. That tree, so
useful for the support of man, forms a part of the riches of the
island.</p>
<p>The flat strand, at low water, is covered many places with a
multitude of crabs, of the species denominated <i>cancer
volans</i>, which then emerge from the holes which they dig in
the soft ground. This singular creature; one of whose claws is
sometimes larger than its body, often becomes the prey of birds.
I believe the facility with which its claws are disjoined from
its body is the reason why one of them is almost always much
larger than the other.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The great disproportion of the claws to the
body, and to one another, is more probably a distinctive
characteristic of this curious species of crab. I have seen many
thousands of them; but never an individual in which this
disproportion did not exist. Places situated to leeward of the
muddy salt-flats, in which those creatures breed, are justly
reckoned extremely insalubrious.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>A little excursion to the south of the town, near the quarter
inhabited by the Europeans, brought us to the tomb of Rumphius.
The simplicity of this monument reminded us of the manners of
that able observer of nature. It was encircled with the beautiful
shrub, known by the name of <i>panax fruticosum</i>.</p>
<p>We saw, in the hands of some natives, the pretty <i>lorry</i>
of the Philippines. These, however, were not procured from so
great a distance, but from some islands a little to the eastward
of Amboyna, and chiefly those of Arrou. They had also another
species of the lorry, which breeds in the forests of Amboyna, and
which differs from the former in its colours, which are less
vivid, and not so beautifully blended. Most of those parrots
pronounced some words of the Malayan language.</p>
<p>Towards noon, the heat of the sun affected us with such a
head-ach, as forced us almost always to retire to some shade, in
order to defend ourselves from his direct rays.</p>
<p>Very early on the morning of the 15th we proceeded towards the
west; but about mid-day the heat was so very oppressive, that we
were obliged to return home.</p>
<p>The naturalist who did the duty of chaplain, became so
dangerously ill, that we could not leave him a single moment for
four successive days. The symptoms of the malignant fever, with
which he was attacked, were very dreadful. His stools were
extremely fetid, and accompanied with frequent vomitings,
starting of the tendons, a small pulse and great prostration of
strength. The nervous affection of the patient came to such a
height, that every evacuation was attended with a degree of
weakness which deprived him of recollection. His lower
extremities were affected with violent spasms, which occasioned
very great pain.</p>
<p>Although the disease was exceedingly infectious, no danger
ought to have prevented us from paying to our distressed
ship-mate, all the attention which he had a right to expect from
our friendship; and accordingly we suspended our researches in
natural history, till we should see him out of danger.</p>
<p>16th. The next day the symptoms became still more alarming.
The pulse more and more depressed, with frequent intermissions in
its motion, the hiccups, sometimes continued for half a quarter
of an hour, a great prostration of strength and an appearance
altogether discomposed; made us entertain serious apprehensions
for the life of our patient.</p>
<p>In the night, the symptoms were equally alarming.</p>
<p>About break of day, on the 17th, the pulse sensibly increased,
and a certain flexibility in the stroke of the artery, afforded
us the happy presage of an abundant perspiration, which
accordingly succeeded in a few hours, and snatched our friend
from the gates of death.</p>
<p>He was in a state of convalescence not more than eight
days.</p>
<p>This species of fever, occasioned by stagnant waters, in a
tropical climate, was treated with diluting draughts and
antispasmodics. Ether given frequently, and in small doses, had a
tendency to support the strength of the patient, while it
moderated the violence of the symptoms.</p>
<p>M. Hoffman, surgeon of the military hospital, visited our
patient several times a day. Our chief surgeon also regularly
attended him.</p>
<p>M. Bourguell&eacute;s, the Company's treasurer, persuaded the
Commander of our expedition, that the united of all the
physicians in Europe, was not equal to that of a Malay doctor, in
the treatment of such diseases. One of the most able of them was
therefore called in. He did not propose to perform the cure by
internal remedies; for he gave the patient nothing to take; but
after rubbing slightly the skin of different parts of the body,
and properly adjusting the lower extremities, he pronounced, with
a mysterious air, some words, which he seemed to address to the
Supreme Being. Then he conjured, as we were told, the evil
spirits, whom those islanders look upon as the authors of
diseases. M. Bourguell&eacute;s was overjoyed to see the doctor
operate in his best manner, in order to obtain the desired
success. We allowed him to do every thing, from which no bad
consequences could result; but it was our business to interrupt
his operations, when he was proceeding to souse the patient, with
a pail of water, newly drawn from the well. It was but a very
little time before the critical sweat, which terminated in his
recovery.</p>
<p>The Malay doctor doubtless placed all his science in this
experiment; but he did not know that it would have suppressed the
critical perspiration, of which the pulse had given us the happy
presage.</p>
<p>Our patient was sufficiently recovered on the 19th, no longer
to require such assiduous care. We therefore proceeded westward
into the country. After having long followed the course of a
little river, which runs into the harbour at short distance from
the ton, we were returning with a load of fine plants, when, at
the approach of night, we met some native fishermen who had been
equally fortunate, in their way, and who were proceeding to broil
their fish. We had the pleasure of seeing them light up their
fire, by means of two pieces of bamboo, rubbed against each
other, after being cut in a manner which I shall presently
explain.</p>
<p>20th. We employed half of the day in an excursion towards the
south; and we made haste to ascend a hill, where we found some
young natives setting snares to catch birds. They consisted of
hairs formed into nooses and tied to a very long rope, which lay
on the ground, and was fastened to a wooden peg driven into the
earth.</p>
<p>I supposed that they made use of baits to attract the game;
but they told me that they did not, and at the same time
confessed, that they caught but few birds.</p>
<p>At the bottoms of the hills, we observed the fine palm which
the natives call the sago tree, and which Rumphius has described
(vol. i. fig. 13,) under the name of <i>faguerus</i>. From the
pedicles of the boughs <i>(regimes)</i> of this tree, when newly
cut, a very agreeable liquor oozed, which was received in pieces
of bamboo, tied to their extremities. In so hot a climate, this
liquor very quickly ferments, and would become acid, if the
inhabitants did not add to it tome of the wood of the
<i>soulamea</i>, which, by the fermentation, is entirely freed
from its bitter taste, and preserves the liquor a long time.</p>
<p>One of these palms may yield daily, for above two months in
the year, from a gallon and a half to two gallons of this liquor.
In order to facilitate its efflux, the incisions of the pedicles
are daily renewed.</p>
<p>As the heat of the fun favours the ascension of the sap, one
would naturally suppose that the tree would yield a greater
quantity of this liquor during the day than during the night. The
fact, however, is quite otherwise, for the humidity which is
absorbed by the leaves in the night, mixing with the juice,
increases its apparent quantity; but that which is obtained
during the day contains much more of the saccharine principle,
which is to be extracted.</p>
<p>This extract forms a kind of sugar, which the Malays call
<i>goula itan</i> (black sugar.) It is commonly met with in small
loaves, which retain the shape of the hemispherical vessels, in
which the redundant water is evaporated. Its colour approaches to
that of chocolate; but it is deeper. On breaking those little
loaves, there appear, especially towards the centre, yellowish
shining grains, a circumstance which renders it probable, that
there would be no great difficulty to bring it to the degree of
crystallization, necessary to convert it into sugar of a good
quality. Such as it is, the natives scarcely use any other, that
which is extracted from the sugar-cane being sold for seven or
eight times the price.</p>
<p>From this almost exclusive use of the goula itan, one would be
apt to conclude, that the sugar-cane was not produced in the
island. Almost all the inhabitants, however, devote small
portions of their gardens to this valuable plant; but they
content themselves with regaling on its juice, which they express
by mastication.</p>
<p>In addition to the agreeable and wholesome liquor afforded by
this fine palm, the leaves (or <i>limbs</i>,*) are adorned,
towards the base, with filaments which the natives convert into
good cordage. From the form and black colour of those filaments,
one would take them, at the first sight, for horse-hair, but they
are almost twice as large. The young fruit, prepared with sugar,
makes an excellent comfit.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The French word is <i>feuilles</i>. But the
English use the word <i>limb</i>, for the foots of the cocoa-nut
tree, the cabbage tree and other species of palm; and very
properly: they are too large to be called leaves, and, being
deciduous, cannot be called branches, in the ordinary sense of
that term.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>Some fractures in the earth near the bottoms of the hills,
disclosed to our view the hard, clear, grey <i>steatite</i>,
which forms their bases.</p>
<p>22d. In an excursion which I made to the south-west, I found
many rocks of very friable <i>schistus</i>, of a light grey
colour, and near a very hard species of a <i>asbestos</i>.</p>
<p>One would be apt to imagine, that, in an island so little
removed from the Equator, the preparation of the subjects of
natural history would be singularly facilitated by a quick
desiccation. The contrary, however, was so much the case, that I
was obliged to make great exertions to save the fruits of my
botanical harvest from ruin. In fact, the air, in passing over
the waters of the ocean, becomes charged with a degree of
humidity, which greatly injures such preparations, and the beat
of the climate quickly destroys those plants which are most
retentive of their juices.</p>
<p>23d. At four in the morning, we directed our course towards
the east.</p>
<p>We had several times to cross the beautiful rivulet, known by
the name of Vai-Tomon, which enters the sea a little to the
eastward of the town. Its banks were covered with a great number
of plants, among which are several species of the
<i>jussi&oelig;a</i>. I observed on the surface of the brook, the
species distinguished by the name of the <i>jussi&oelig;a
tennela</i>; and I admired the precaution taken by nature for its
preservation, in disposing along the stalk large oval tubercles,
filled with air, to make the plant swim. Those vesicles are but
little different from the air-bladders, with which most fish are
furnished; only in this instance, each vesicle is composed of a
great number of smaller ones; because otherwise they would be in
danger of being destroyed, by the shocks the different bodies
brought down by the stream.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the shade of the surrounding trees, the
<i>el&oelig;carpus monogynus</i> was covered, even to its lowed
branches, with fine flowers, elegantly figured. In those solitary
forests, where the sun does not easily penetrate the thick
foliage, it is astonishing to observe the vivid colours of
several kinds of parasite plants, of the genus of
<i>orchydes</i>, mostly cleaving to the trunks of the largest
trees. In the least crowded spots, the tree of the
<i>arali&aelig;</i> class, designated by the name of the
<i>cussonia thyrsiflora</i>, adorned the forest with their large
palmated leaves.</p>
<p>Among the great number of lizards which were busily pursuing
insects, I admired the agility of that called the flying dragon
(<i>draco volans</i>, Linn.). During the greatest heat of the
day, that pretty animal rapidly darted from branch to branch, by
extending two membranes in the form of wings, by means of which
it sustains itself for some time in the air. Nature having denied
it the muscles necessary for the vibration of this kind of wings,
it can only spread them out to counteract the rapidity of its
descent. With its hind feet it gives its body an impulse, which
not interfering with its descensive motion, sometimes carries it
forward a few toises, and to a height nearly equal to that of the
place whence it darted.</p>
<p>In my return, I wished to take some branches from the
different vegetables which grew in a garden belonging to a native
of the island. But the guides who accompanied us, apprized me of
the danger to which they believed I would expose myself. Pointing
to a little flied, they several times repeated, with an air of
respect blended with fear, the word <i>mat&eacute;</i>, before
our interpreter could explain to us, that, by this term, which
means a dead person, they meant to signify the ancient possessor
of the garden, who lay buried under the little shed, which we
saw. The natives are persuaded, that the soul of the deceased
possessors wander in the neighbourhood of such places, in order
to preserve their products for the present proprietors. They
believe, that any other person who should take any part of such
products would die within the year; and so generally is this
belief diffused, that seldom does any inhabitant allow himself to
touch the property of another; so that this <i>mat&eacute;</i> is
a bugbear, which almost always insures the harvest to its
legitimate possessor.</p>
<p>The General went on board to review the ship's company, and he
procured advances for them all.</p>
<p>25th. My collection was already so numerous, and called for so
much care, that I spent almost the whole of the 24th in preparing
them; but the next day Citizen Riche and I ascended the river
called <i>Baton Ganton</i>, which empties itself into the road on
the west side of the town. It is confined in a very deep channel,
excavated by its current between the hills, which in many places
are of difficult access. We proposed to ascend as far as we
could, endeavouring to follow exactly the windings of the banks;
but their steepness obliged us to take to the channel itself,
where the water was seldom less than eighteen inches in
depth.</p>
<p>We had advanced but a few steps, when we met a Dutch sailor,
who had made his escape from a large ship loaded with cloves, and
which was on the point of sailing for Batavia. The dread of
perishing by the contagious malady so fatal to Europeans, who
remain there even for a very short time, had made this unhappy
man resolve to conceal himself in the woods till the ship should
have sailed. We lamented his unfortunate situation; but little
did we foresee that the place which he dreaded so much, was to
terminate our own peregrinations.</p>
<p>On the banks of this river; there grew in abundance, a new
species of <i>begonia</i>, remarkable for the smallness of all
its parts.</p>
<p>A beautiful granite, of a fine grain, formed the base of those
hills. Quartz, generally very white, was there in some cases
tinged by the green steatite, and in others by iron, which gave
it the colour of rust. Mica was there disseminated in a very
uniform manner, and we found schorl of a black colour, in minute
slender fragments.</p>
<p>While we were employed in collecting objects of natural
history, our guides took the opportunity of providing themselves
with a repast of a species of crab (<i>cancer carinus</i>), with
which this little river abounds. Their manner of catching them
gave us a good opinion of their ingenuity.</p>
<p>This crab commonly seeks its food in the clearest water, which
it slowly traverses, but the instant it is approached, it moves
off with extreme rapidity. The islanders, however, managed to
catch a great number of them by the eyes. Having tied to the end
of a wand a horse hair with a noose, they render themselves
masters of the animal by passing this noose over the balls of the
spherical part of the eye. When they miss their aim, the crab
seldom fails to return, and in the end is almost always
taken.</p>
<p>Having early consumed all our provisions, we hoped to find
some natives towards the latter part of the day, who would sell
us some. It was about three in the afternoon, when we advanced
confidently towards a small house, near the bank of the river.
But what was our astonishment, when, to every thing we asked for,
we received no other answer than <i>tarda?</i> for thus the
mistress of this little habitation signified, that the could not
furnish us with any of the articles which we desired. Yet we took
great pains to assure her, that we would pay her exactly for
every thing the gave us. We were the more surprised at this
pretended poverty, as the appearance of the natives announced
abundance. In the sequel I learned, that those peaceable people
have not always reason to be satisfied with the conduct of the
Europeans, who govern their island. They thought their safest way
was, not to trust to our promises. A few glasses of arrack,
however, and some trifling matters which we distributed among
them, at last gained us their confidence.</p>
<p>They invited us to sit down under a shed formed by an
elongation of the roof of the cabin. Crabs caught in the little
river were set before us in abundance. They marred for us
potatoes and yams, and regaled us with the wine of the sago palm,
sightly fermented. This liquor, which, when newly drawn from the
tree, is called <i>sagour mouda</i>, and <i>aer saguero
mouda</i>, is much more agreeable than the milk of the cocoa-nut.
The girl who was preparing our repast, to a figure and appearance
extremely pleasing, joined an air of sincerity which gave charms
to the interest which she inspired. Having brought us some
fruits, the immediately went and seated herself behind her
mother, from whence the occasionally stole a glance at us, to
satisfy her curiosity.</p>
<p>This frugal repast was not without its charms. To our
reflections on the life of a man who undertakes long voyages,
were added the pleasing idea which we had formed of the happiness
of those islanders, whose wants nature has supplied with so
liberal a hand.</p>
<p>The construction of their houses is adapted to the beauty of
the climate; and the lightness of their materials renders it
unnecessary to dig their foundations down to the rock.</p>
<p>As the inhabitants never experience severe weather, the walls
are constructed in such a manner as to allow a free passage to
the air. They consist of a sort of paling, frequently formed of
twigs of bamboo, placed very near each other.</p>
<p>The cottage of our host, which occupied a space thirteen feet
in length, and about ten in breadth, instead of bamboos, was
wattled with the stems of the sago-tree limbs (<i>feuilles</i>),
which, though near, together, left some intervals, through which
the external air had free access into the habitation.</p>
<p>Those stems, though very light, have a great deal of solidity,
being covered with a very hard bark. The heart of them consists
of a fungous substance, which the inhabitants use instead of
corks.</p>
<p>Every part of this habitation was derived from the sago-tree,
even to the roof, the top of which being about ten feet in
height, was covered with the leaves (<i>folioles</i>) of that
valuable tree. They were plaited and fixed to a pole, thus
forming rectangles often the whole length of the house, and about
eight inches in breadth, and as they overlapped each other, they
were impenetrable by the hardest rain.</p>
<p>The two sides of the roof were inclined about forty-five
degrees, and a part of it formed at the door a little shed, where
the family enjoyed the fresh air, and where also they dressed
their victuals; for, as the cottage was not furnished with a
chimney, a fire would have rendered it uninhabitable.</p>
<p>It appeared strange that those people, who loved to be at
their case, should sleep on a sort of trellis formed of sticks,
two inches asunder. This was but a hard bed, notwithstanding the
mats with which it was covered; but it afforded them the pleasure
of the fresh air, which circulated freely in the interstices. It
was elevated about eighteen inches above the ground, and below it
was deposited a part of the household utensils, consisting of
three earthen pots of their own manufacture, some square bottles,
which they had bought from the Europeans, and spoons which they
had formed of the large shells common at Amboyna. Among those
shells we recognized different species of the <i>nautilus</i>,
many pearl-oysters, and also a kind known by the name of <i>pinna
rudis</i>.</p>
<p>We observed besides, under the bed, a pick-axe and a large
knife, in the form of a butcher's chopping-knife, called
<i>pissau</i> in the Malayan language. They had both those
instruments from the Europeans.</p>
<p>As the temperature of the climate renders cloathing
unnecessary, their wardrobe contains nothing but what is strictly
requisite to conceal the parts which decency forbids them to
expose to view.</p>
<p>A pair of drawers, which does not reach lower than the middle
of the thigh, or a bit of blue stuff tied round the loins, is the
only cloathing of the men who are employed in agriculture.</p>
<p>The dress of the women is naturally more expensive. They wear
a kind of shist of the same stuff which descends to the middle of
the leg, and is fastened round the loins with a girdle.</p>
<p>Our presents had excited their gratitude. The girl, having
disappeared for a few minutes, returned to offer us some
odoriferous flowers; but as the wanted a string to form them into
nosegays, we had an opportunity of observing the readiness, with
which those natives obtain a fibrous substance from the bastard
aloe, called <i>agave vivipara</i>. The master of the house ran
out and cut a leaf of that plant, and placing it upon his thigh,
in order to split it with his large knife, and to free it from
the pith, he soon produced a parcel of filaments, as long as the
leaf, and as strong as those of our best hemp.</p>
<p>In our return, we met a slave whole decrepitude excited our
curiosity. But it was to no purpose that we asked him, how old he
was; for he could not satisfy us in that particular, as he knew
nothing about it. It appeared strange to us, that a man should
not have counted the number of years which he had passed in
slavery!!</p>
<p>28th. This day I took an airing in the road, in a canoe with a
double outrigger. Some sportsmen, taking the opportunity of this
rapid conveyance to the eastward of the town, joined our party.
We followed the right bank of the road, at a little distance from
the shore. The water was so limpid as to disclose to our view, at
the depth of three and four fathoms, the bottom composed of white
coral, on which we could perfectly distinguish the species of
ray, or thornback, remarkable for its large circular spots of
azure blue, as well as several other fishes exhibiting the most
brilliant colours. There was a Papow on board, who had the
address to catch several of them. Standing in the fore part of
the canoe, he darted his spear, consisting of a bamboo pointed
with iron, at the fish which was his object. The spear, from its
lightness, ascended nearly in the same direction; so that though
it had gone to a great depth, our Papow seldom failed to catch
it, notwithstanding the way we were making.</p>
<p>When we were about 1,500 toises from the town, we admired the
charming situation of the Governor's country house, at the foot
of a chain of mountains, which terminate in a gentle declivity
near the road.</p>
<p>A cottage of the natives, half way up this slope, encircled
with clove and banana trees, added greatly to the beauty of this
rural scene.</p>
<p>The depth diminished so much that, though our canoe scarcely
drew more than eight inches of water, we were obliged to keep off
shore, in order to avoid the rocks.</p>
<p>At the distance of more than 5,100 toises from the town, after
passing some fishing boats, we landed on the right bank near a
cottage, the owner of which furnished us with as many cocoa-nuts
as we wished. Some sailors who were with us, finding their liquor
too sweet, mixed with it as much brandy as suited their taste,
and we had the satisfaction of observing, that this potation was
by no means disagreeable to our host.</p>
<p>After this breakfast, each of us entered on the business which
had brought him thither; and we agreed to rendezvous at the place
where we landed.</p>
<p>For my own part, I resolved to make an attempt on the
mountains to the eastward.</p>
<p>I followed a path very much frequented by the natives, leaving
it, however, and penetrating into the forest at every clear
interval, which facilitated my entrance.</p>
<p>In several places the earth had rushed down, and exposed to
view the hard grey stone, Which formed the bases of those
mountains. I had also observed the same kind of stone on the
shore of the road-side, along which we had just been walking.</p>
<p>Among the different shrubs which grew on the low lands, I
obtained a very fine mixed species of the genus <i>conyfa</i>,
remarkable for having three principal nerves on each leaf, as in
several species of the <i>melastoma</i>. It had also the general
appearance of the plants of that genus, to which I should have
been inclined to refer it, if I had not seen the flower.</p>
<p>The phalanger of Buffon (<i>didelphis orientalis</i>, Linn.)
inhabited the foot of those mountains. I had a near view of
several of them as they rapidly flew past me.</p>
<p>When I had gained about 150 toises of perpendicular elevation,
I remarked a total change in the nature of the soil. Beds of
calcareous stones, perfectly pure and white, crowned those high
grounds, which now presented a great extent of very level
surface.</p>
<p>There I saw a garden surrounded with a paling of bamboo, and
very well cultivated, although at a great distance from any
habitation. There appeared to be no possible means of watering
it; yet the vegetation was very vigorous, owing to the humidity
of the atmosphere in this elevated situation. Large fields were
allotted to the culture of the species of pimento, called
<i>capsicum grossum</i>, of which the inhabitants of the island
consume a great quantity.</p>
<p>A little shed on the west side of the garden afforded us its
shelter, and in it my thirsty guides found a supply of good water
in long bamboos, which appeared to be designed for some other
purpose. This water had been brought from the foot of the
mountain, and we made as free with it as if it had been our
own.</p>
<p>Although it was very hot, they thought proper to kindle a
fire. I was far from foreseeing the intention of those people,
who, like the greatest savages, took pleasure in seeing the
flames devour the dry plants in the clear spots. Presently one of
my guides had the imprudence to set fire to a large bush. The air
was then very calm; but a light breeze soon after springing up,
drove the flames towards the garden, and I had the mortification
to see a part of its paling consumed, without being able to stop
the progress of the conflagration.</p>
<p>The manner in which those natives produce fire, well deserves
to be described. Their method is not so expeditious as a good
flint and steel; but they have the advantage of finding their
material almost every where, a piece of bamboo being
sufficient.</p>
<p>The following is the way in which they perform it. They split
into two equal parts, a bit of bamboo eighteen inches in length.
In one of the parts they form a longitudinal slit, and cut the
other tapering to about an inch and a half in breadth. They put
scrapings of the same wood under the slit, and in the concavity
of the largest piece, which they place horizontally, with the
convex side uppermost; then introducing the other piece into the
middle of the slit, where there is a notch to receive it, and
supporting it strongly, they give it the motion of a saw, and in
less than a minute the scrapings catch fire.</p>
<p>The <i>canarim commune</i> overtopped all the trees, in those
elevated forests. I was surprized to see the calcareous rock
naked in the midst of those extensive woods, the rotten remains
of the trees not having yet covered them with a stratum of
vegetative mould; and the rents contained nothing but stones,
which time had broken asunder. Those stones resembled vast
plates, of the same nature with those which I had many times
observed in our Alps. Their numerous cavities seemed to indicate,
that the most soluble parts of them had been washed away by the
rain.</p>
<p>Having been driven from this spot by the smoke of the
spreading conflagration, I proceeded towards the south-west,
where I found, in the mica of the woods, many individuals of the
<i>nam nam</i> of the Malays (<i>cynometra cauliflora</i>,
Linn.), which they raise in their gardens, on account of its
fruit, the taste of which approaches to that of a good apple,
slightly acid.</p>
<p>Having followed the banks of a rivulet, which discharged its
waters near the place where we landed, curiosity induced me to
visit a cottage situated near the sea. There I found an old man,
who, contrary to the custom of those islanders, wore a long
beard. He was boiling, in a large earthen vessel, some shell
fish, which he had collected at low water, among the mangrove
trees near his habitation. The respectable old man, without being
surprized at my visit, immediately invited me to partake of his
repast. A long splinter of a sago-tree limb was put into my hand,
and I imitated my host in using it to dig out of the shell the
fish, which were set before me on a banana-leaf.</p>
<p>The old man's wife soon after joined us, and I should have
been extremely surprized at the prodigious inequality of their
ages, if I had not learned that those islanders place their
happiness in marrying very young girls. Their physiognomy becomes
singularly animated whenever they speak of a young woman (in
Malay, <i>paranpouang mouda</i>), and, on the other hand, it is
truly diverting to observe the frightful grimace which
discomposes their whole countenance, when they speak of an old
woman, (<i>paranpouang toua</i>).</p>
<p>I endeavoured to make the old man sensible of the extreme
insalubrity of his situation so near to mangrove-trees; where the
stagnant waters might affect him with violent disorders. But I
could not prevail on him to content to remove his cottage to a
more elevated spot. All the answer which he made was, that the
sea afforded him his livelihood.</p>
<p>The palm-tree, named <i>nipa</i>, grew in those salt marshes.
Its leaves are of great use in covering the cottages.</p>
<p>The hunters had already arrived at the place of rendezvous. We
were all extremely thirsty; and we expected to procure
cocoa-nuts, with as much facility as when we came to the same
place in the morning. But the owner of the garden was absent, and
there was no one in the cottage but his wife. It was in vain that
we endeavoured to prevail upon her to sell us some cocoa-nuts,
for which we would have made one of our guides climb the trees.
She gave us to understand that she had not liberty to sell them
to us. Besides, not one of our guides would have dared to climb
the trees in the absence of the owner, and, if he had not come
home, we should have had no cocoa-nuts; for he had placed among
the trees a <i>mat&eacute;</i>, for which our guides showed as
much respect as for the one I have already mentioned. This one
was also in the form of a little shed, the roof of which might be
about twenty-six inches in height, covered with the leaves of the
nipa palm, and supported by four posts, about eighteen inches
distant from each other.</p>
<p>From the middle of the roof was suspended by a rope a piece of
bamboo, about eight inches in length, and covered with half a
cocoa-nut. In this bamboo were contained, as I was told, some
things which had been the property of the person who was buried
under the little shed. I complied with their request not to touch
them; for I did not with to treat their usages with
disrespect.</p>
<p>When it was near sun-set, we went on board, in order to return
to the town. Our Papow gave us fresh proofs of his dexterity, by
transfixing, while we were making considerable way, different
kinds of fish.</p>
<p>It was dark when we arrived at the town.</p>
<p>I was employed for most of the 20th, in preparing and
describing the objects which I had collected on the preceding
day.</p>
<p>One of the fruits of my excursion was the beautiful lizard,
called <i>lacerta Amboinensis</i>. I observed that it changed its
colour like the chameleon; it was most commonly green, but it
frequently assumed a deep brown. This animal is easily taken; for
it allows one to approach it near enough to catch it by the
extremity of the tail, which is of an extraordinary length.</p>
<p>In the evening I repaired to the beach, in order to examine
the marine productions thrown on shore by the waters, and there I
remained till night. I saw many fishermen in their canoes near
the beach, and who, taking advantage of the darkness, decoyed the
fish by torches held near the surface of the water. Pieces of
wood, supported, by the levers of the double outrigger of the
canoe produced a very clear flame. One of the fishermen attended
those torches, and carefully diffused their light, which it was
easy for him to do, by only letting bits of the flaming wood fall
into the water; while others were employed in encircling with
their nets, the fishes collected from afar by this brilliant
light; we did not hesitate to conclude, from what we observed,
that those islanders were very skilful fishermen.</p>
<p>Very early in the morning of the 30th, we set out to survey
the other shore of the road. It was necessary for us to go about
3,000 toises by water, and this transit was dangerous in a canoe,
whose outriggers were not sufficiently strong preserve the
equilibrium of the vessel, when loaded with so great a weight. We
were anxious to visit those places which we had not yet viewed;
and we went on board without knowing all the danger of our
enterprize. But presently we saw one of the outriggers dip under
the water, when one of us leaned a little; and without the
greatest care we should have been overset. If this accident had
happened, towards the middle of the road, it would have been
difficult, on account of the rapidity of the current; even for
the most expert swimmer of our number, to have reached the shore.
The danger diminished as we approached the place where we wished
to land. But we were much astonished at the imprudence of one of
the people belonging to the Esperance, who, although he could not
swim, and was certain of being drowned, if we had been overset,
several times endangered the equilibrium of our little vessel. At
last, however, we got on shore.</p>
<p>The coast was there covered with the shrub called <i>seavola
lobelia</i>. It delights in such a situation; and I also found it
in New Ireland.</p>
<p>At high water, the sea washed the root of the beautiful tree
whole denomination, <i>heritiera</i>; recalled the name of one of
our most able botanists, Citizen l'Heritier.</p>
<p>In proceeding westward I found, among the shells upon the
beach, some lavas very porous, but yet too heavy to swim in
water. As I had not observed, in the inland parts of the island,
any stones which had been subjected to the action of fire, it
seems reasonable to suppose, that those had been brought into
their present situation, by the waters, agitated by some volcanic
eruption; for earthquakes are frequent in those parts, and the
inhabitants still mention with dread, one, among others, which,
twelve years before our arrival in their island, had been
attended with great devastation; the houses could not be
inhabited for several days, and some of them were even
overthrown.</p>
<p>In the island of Banda, a little to the eastward of Amboyna,
there is an open volcano.</p>
<p>At Karuku a little island, also to the eastward of Amboyna,
and at the distance of about 5,100 toises from it, are hot
springs which, according to the accounts of several Europeans,
will completely coagulate an egg in five minutes. The hot vapour
which issues from those waters does not injure the trees which
are continually bathed in it; but on the contrary they exhibit
proofs of a vigorous vegetation.</p>
<p>This little island of Karuku is principally allotted to the
culture of the clove-tree.</p>
<p>I found, in the gardens of the natives some nutmeg-trees, the
largest of which did not exceed twenty-two feet in height, the
trunk having been about three inches in diameter. They already
bore a great quantity of fruit. The nutmeg-tree delights in the
shade of large trees; and these enjoyed the shelter of the
<i>canarium commune</i>. The same tree affords them its shade, in
the island of Banda, which is chiefly applied to their culture by
the Dutch.</p>
<p>The Council of the Dutch East India Company, which is
established at Batavia, finding the produce of the nutmeg
plantations at Banda sufficient for exportation, and wishing,
besides, to prevent all contraband trade in that precious
commodity, ordered, some years before we arrived in Amboyna, all
the nutmeg-trees in that island to be destroyed. This order was
executed, and very few of the devoted trees escaped destruction;
but a hurricane which happened the same year, deranged all their
avaricious calculations. It compleated in Banda, the devastation
which the Council had executed at Amboyna.</p>
<p>The same Council afterwards issued orders to endeavour to
repair the havock which they had committed at Amboyna. They now
wished to re-establish the culture of the nutmeg there. Hence
those which we saw near the road, are still very young. Yet we
observed several in the gardens of the town, and even opposite to
the house of the Commander of the place, which were much larger,
having escaped the destructive orders issued by the government at
Batavia.</p>
<p>We found the beautiful laurel, called <i>laurus culilaban</i>,
which yields, by distillation, an aromatic oil very much in
request. The natives know how to extract this precious oil, and
make it an article of commerce.</p>
<p>The largest clove trees which we saw in this excursion, were
not above twenty-two feet in height; and their trunks not above
eight inches thickness. The natives are obliged to deliver their
produce to the Dutch Company, for about the hundred and fiftieth
part of the price for which it is sold in Europe. We saw great
quantities of the cloves which the natives had spread on mats,
under their sheds, in order to be properly dried before being
delivered to the agents of the Company. Those people took special
care not to expose them to the rays of the sun, which would have
dissipated part of the essential oil of that excellent
aromatic.</p>
<p>Being upon the beach, I heard the sound of wind instruments,
the harmony of which was sometimes very just, and blended with
dissonances by no means displeasing. Those fine and harmonious
sounds seemed to came from such a distance, as to make me
believe, for some time, that the natives were entertaining
themselves with their music, on the other side of the road, and
near 5,000 toises from the place where I stood. My ear was much
deceived as to the distance; for I was not fifty toises from the
instrument. It was a bamboo, at least sixty feet in height, fixed
in a vertical position, close to the sea. Between every joint was
a hole near an inch and 2-10ths long, and somewhat above half an
inch broad. These holes formed so many mouths, which, by the
action of the wind emitted agreeable and varied sounds. As the
joints of this long bamboo were very numerous, care had been
taken to pierce it in different directions; so that from whatever
point the wind blew, it always met with some holes. The sound of
this instrument more nearly resembles that of the harmonica, than
any other to which I can compare it.</p>
<p>The experience which we had had of our canoe, in traversing
the road, had given us the hint to prepare it better for our
return. Accordingly the outriggers were strengthened, and we
proceeded towards the town, without any apprehensions of being
drowned.</p>
<p>OCTOBER 2d. Some hours of this day were employed in visiting
the Governor's cabinet of natural history, in which I admired a
numerous collection of fine papilios, in perfect preservation. I
observed many duplicates of very rare ones, and a large box
entirely filled with the beautiful species called <i>papilio
agamemnon</i>. This cabinet also contained a great variety of
shells, among which were above twenty scalata (<i>turbo
scalaris</i>, Linn.)</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Council also possessed great collections
of this kind. A taste for procuring objects of natural history is
very much diffused among the Dutch, who find it a powerful mean
of obtaining them preferment, when they know how to address their
acquisitions, properly, to persons possessing influence with the
Council at Batavia, or in Europe.</p>
<p>Captain Huon obtained many rare shells from the Secretary of
the Council, who gave him, among others, One of the most precious
and scarce shells, the glazed or glassy nautilus, (<i>la nautile
vitr&eacute;e</i>) which he has made over by will to the museum
of natural history in Paris.</p>
<p>3d. The next day we proceeded towards the entrance of the
road, following the shore in the canoe which we commonly made use
of.</p>
<p>At the same time, the tide rising with great force, produced a
rapid current, particularly towards the middle of the road.
Notwithstanding the skill of our paddlers, we would have gained
nothing by struggling against such an obstacle. As its force was
much diminished towards the shore, we kept as near it as we
could, a man&oelig;uvre which was much facilitated by the
shallowness of our vessel.</p>
<p>I was at some pains in observing the great diminution of the
current towards the shore; but I did not expect to find it so
considerable. The principal cause appeared to me to be the
proximity of the land, which detained the water by a kind of
adhesion; whereas, at a greater distance, the sea being much
deeper, its upper strata, which form the current, glide with
facility upon the lower, and thus the friction is extremely
diminished.</p>
<p>While there is a very rapid current towards the middle of the
road, there is frequently none close to the shore; and sometimes
one in a contrary direction, which ought to be ascribed to the
different points of land, protruding into the sea.</p>
<p>In a deep part, bordered by a sandy bottom, we observed some
fishing places, formed by a paling of bamboos so close together,
that the fish could not escape through it. The entrance was dry
at low water; so that the fishes which were thus encircled at
high water could not get out when the tide had a little subsided.
Besides, the fishes, which commonly prefer the deepest water,
advanced towards the farther part of the inclosure, where the
depth, even at low water, was still about three feet. This
reservoir imprisoned those fishes which were most easily decoyed,
and man was not the only fisher who frequented it; for we
observed there several species of herons. Our presence drove some
of them away, but others still remained, with their long legs
deeply immersed in the water, patiently waiting till the fishes
came within their reach. The fishing martens are also frequent
attendants at those inclosures; some of them were perched upon
the bamboos, from whence we saw them dart, from time to time,
upon the fishes, which afforded them an abundant supply of
food.</p>
<p>We then hastened to a point of land sufficiently advanced into
the sea, to induce the Dutch to build a redoubt upon it. But they
had abandoned this fortification, as well as another which we
observed on the opposite shore nearer to the entrance of the
road. We went on board at a small distance from the former
redoubt, and steered for the country-house of M. Hoffman, chief
surgeon of the hospital, with whom we had formed an
acquaintance.</p>
<p>After making a hasty breakfast, at which spices were served up
with a profusion, which made us remember we were in the Moluccas,
I went to. view the vicinity of this habitation, where a marshy
situation afforded me, among a great number of other plants, the
beautiful species of acanthus, with leaves like those of holly
(<i>acanthus ilicifolius</i>, Linn.), and also its variety, with
whole leaves.</p>
<p>We then returned towards the redoubt, the form of which, on
the side next the sea, is semi-circular, being not more than
eighty-one toises in length and fifty-one in breadth. The walls
are above six feet in height, above three in thickness on the
land side, and six towards the road, with embrasures to receive
forty pieces of cannon.</p>
<p>While I was on shore, Citizen Riche set our canoe-men a
diving, and they frequently brought him up very valuable marine
productions. The road of Amboyna abounds with beautiful shells,
which are seldom met with elsewhere; the most delicate being
protected, in its numerous deep recesses, from the motion of the
waters, are often found in perfect preservation.</p>
<p>Our Papow proved to be not only the best diver, but the
merriest of all our guides. His humour, which was truly
laughable, very much diverted his comrades. He acted several
scenes of comedy, which he told us was a favourite amusement
among his countrymen. One of those which he repeated the
oftenest, because it produced general applause, represented a
woman ready to lye in. He entertained us, when we were taking
some refreshment, with the finest part of the piece, and he
seemed to do great justice to the character.</p>
<p>Some of the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands act similar
comedies. Captain Cook, in his second voyage, relates, that at
the Society Islands, he was present at such an exhibition.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity, while our Papow was in so good a
humour, to ask him, What method the people of his country took to
separate the umbilical cord? He told me, that they burnt it,
above an inch from the body, a mode of operation which has been
practised by some surgeons, and that, for this purpose, the
Papows employed a well kindled torch.</p>
<p>We re-embarked, in order to proceed farther, always following
the same bank. Some of the <i>erythrina corallodendron</i> made
themselves remarkable by their fine bright red flowers.</p>
<p>On the steep sides of the hard grey rocks, which formed the
neighbouring shore, grew some trees of the vacoua (<i>pandanus
odoratissima</i>), which overhanging the sea, gave those places a
very picturesque appearance. The large spherical fruit, depending
from the extremities of their branches, increased their natural
inclination towards the water, the surface of which was always
covered with ripe fruit.</p>
<p>These delightful scenes gave us reason to be pleased with our
excursion. Having passed some time there, we re-embarked, in
order to advance still nearer to the entrance of the road.</p>
<p>A charming situation, in the vicinity of a cottage occupied by
a native, induced us to go on shore. The master of the cottage
was absent; but we found in this peaceful habitation, a young
woman, encircled by her children, whom she was amusing, with a
very simple stringed instrument, which the accompanied with her
agreeable voice. It was formed of a joint of bamboo, about six
inches in length, covered at one end with a piece of parchment,
like a drum. Three strings of bark, each of them stretched by a
bridge, were fixed to the two extremities of this cylinder, which
was placed upon the knees. The two most distant chords sounded an
octave, and the intermediate one a fifth with the farthest chord.
A circle at each extremity, about 4-10ths of an inch in height,
supported other strings, intended to render the instrument more
sonorous. These strings were more or lets stretched, by a slider,
which connected two and two together, and which could be moved at
pleasure, through almost whole length, as in our drums. A little
slip of bamboo bark, put the chords supported by the bridges into
vibration. The accompaniment, although monotonous, seemed
infinitely pleasing to our guides, whole ears were accustomed to
this species of music.</p>
<p>This habitation was encircled with nutmeg-trees, not far
advanced in growth, but already well proportioned; although at
Amboyna, their culture is not generally relished. The vicinity
formed a beautiful orchard, in which the brilliant flowers of the
<i>eugenia malaccensis</i> attracted our admiration; and there we
also partook of the agreeably acid fruit of the <i>averrhoa
carambola</i>.</p>
<p>The shore was embellished, almost to the edge of the water, by
a large plantation of the species of tree called <i>aschinomene
grandiflora</i>, which bears the largest flower of all the
leguminous plants, and which is commonly of a beautiful white,
but also sometimes red. The natives frequently eat it boiled, and
in some cases they use it raw, by way of a sallad.</p>
<p>The bark of this tree yields a bitter extract, which they
administer as a tonic in fevers.</p>
<p>The day was drawing to a close, and the current set against
us. We were therefore obliged to keep close in shore, and it was
night before we got back to the town.</p>
<p>4th. As soon as I, had disposed, in the most convenient
manner, the produce of my last excursions, I went towards the
south-east, to a little distance from the town, and I still found
plants to add to my collections. At my return, I saw a white
negro, of Papow origin. His hair was white, and his skin fair,
and marked in some places with red, like those of the red-haired
Europeans; but his sight was not weak, as it commonly is in other
Albinoes.</p>
<p>This young Papow, was a slave to a Dutchman, and had been but
a short time at Amboyna. When I first cast my eyes on him, he was
playing on an instrument, which I was surprized to see among
those people; it was a jew's harp, cut out of the hardest part of
a bamboo, but was not quite so large as the iron ones which we
use. As the tongue of it could not be bent, to make it vibrate
with the fingers, a little string tied to one of the extremities
of the instrument communicated the impulse necessary to agitate
the tongue, which then gave the same sound as the iron blades of
our jew's harps. I was told that this instrument was very
agreeable to the Papows.</p>
<p>5th. We had, for some days, formed the design of visiting the
country house belonging to the Commander of the place, situated
near the farthest end of the road; and his son favoured us with
his company.</p>
<p>We set off before day-break; and it was scarcely five o'clock,
before we were seated in our canoes.</p>
<p>We soon arrived under a shed, surrounded with trees, which
afforded a salutary protection from the scorching heat; and they
were by no means a vain decoration to this delightful retreat,
for most of them bore excellent fruit. Among the different anonas
which were offered to us, the best was of the species known by
the name of <i>anona muricata</i>.</p>
<p>In a little time, we re-embarked, and we were near 5,000
toises from the town, when we paled a point of land, beyond which
the road extends itself greatly towards the north.</p>
<p>A fresh breeze from the south-east impeded our progress, and
drove the waves against our slight vessel, which proved very
inconvenient.</p>
<p>At the same time, a large boat, loaded with water for the
Esperance, came out of the creek, into which runs a river which
affords that article to the slipping. They bring the water from
that great distance, because it is much more easily obtained
there than near the town, where, however, the water is an very
good.</p>
<p>The current occasioned by the return of the tide opposed our
course; but our boatmen redoubled their efforts, and we at last
reached the end of that long branch of the road.</p>
<p>We walked for some time under the shade of nutmeg trees,
which, as well as the young plants, were much more numerous
there, than in any other part of the country which we had
hitherto visited.</p>
<p>The Commander's son was here in the midst of his relations. We
were near the house of one of his cousins, who was a native of
the island and there we behoved to dine after their manner. Fish,
bread, sago, rice, and some fruits, formed our repast. As we were
not served with spoons, we were obliged to imitate our host by
taking up the victuals with our fingers; but we did not eat the
less on that account, nor with a worse appetite.</p>
<p>All of us reconciled ourselves very well to bread made of
sago; the fish was strongly seasoned with pimento, but some
glasses of the water of the sago-tree diminished the violence of
its effects.</p>
<p>While we sat at dinner, we were entertained with music. A kind
of spinet was accompanied by a man's voice; a drum served as a
base, and a tamtam as a counter-base.</p>
<p>After dinner our host carried us in his canoe about 500 toises
towards the east.</p>
<p>There we saw a man employed in preparing a sago-tree. This
tree, which was about eighteen inches in thickness, had been cut
down a little time before. It was already opened for a part of
its length, the whole of which did not exceed forty feet, and it
had afforded a great deal of sago. This palm, like the other
trees of this genus, preserving nearly the same diameter for its
whole length, yields nearly as much sago towards the top of the
trunk as towards the root. (Fig. A. Plate xlii, is an exact
figure of a young sago tree.) The external part of its trunk is
formed of a very hard ligneous shell or crust, four lines and a
half in thickness. The trunk is a large cylinder filled with
pith, which is interspersed, through the whole length of the
trunk, with ligneous fibres, about the thirteen-thousandth part
of an inch in thickness, and often above two lines distant from
each other.</p>
<p>They pound the sago after taking it out of the tree; they then
put it into bags made of a sort of canvas, furnished by the bases
of the limbs of the cocoa-nut tree. On those bags they throw,
from time to time, pure water, which carries off the
f&aelig;cul&aelig; (or sediment), while this kind of searce, or
strainer, partly retains the woody fibres.</p>
<p>The water replenished with the f&aelig;cul&aelig; is received
into troughs, about three feet in length, formed of the lower
part of the limbs of the sago tree. On the end of each trough
they fasten a grainer, to retain that part of the
f&aelig;cul&aelig; which has subsided, and the ligneous fibres
which have escaped the first washing, swim on the water.</p>
<p>This last strainer required no preparation; it was of the same
nature with the other; both being a fibrous contexture, which
differs from our stuffs in this, that its component fibres are
simply applied, and run parallel to each other throughout the
whole length; but some short lateral fibres, which traverse the
longitudinal ones, bind them together, and form a firm contexture
of the whole.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The reader will observe, that the kind of
searce here described, is merely a natural production, which is
not over plainly intimated by the Author. They are commonly
called by the English cocoa-nut strainers. They resemble
fragments of very coarse brown linen, but are not so pliable. If
I rightly remember, they are from two to three feet in length,
and where broadest, which is about the middle, from a foot to
about fifteen inches in breadth.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>To clear the f&aelig;cul&aelig; of the sago of the ligneous
fibres which still remain, after having been washed in the sacks
or bags, it is again put into troughs, commonly four in number;
and arranged, one higher than the other; so that what is not
deposited in the first, may be received into the second, and, so
on.</p>
<p>The texture of the sago tree well deserves examination, and
therefore I dissected the trunk of one, in which I observed the
conformation of parts common to many other species of palms, as
Citizen Desfontaines has so well described, in a memoir on plants
with seminal leaves.</p>
<p>6th and 7th. I could not go any great distance from the town
on the two following days, on account of the assiduous care
necessary to preserve my collections. An intelligent assistant to
each naturalist, would have saved that precious time, which
should have been employed to a much better purpose.</p>
<p>8th. But this day, light had scarcely appeared, when we were
upon the road. In crossing it we directed our course towards its
entrance, and very nearly approached a redoubt, about 5,000
toises distant from the town. In that place, the road was at
least 3,500 toises in breadth; so that an enemy had nothing more
to fear from this battery, than from the first which I have
described. This is constructed exactly in the same manner; but it
is situated nearer to the entrance of the road.</p>
<p>Near this spot was a hamlet, composed of some cottages, the
neatness of which indicated the easy circumstances of the
inhabitants. The sea supplied them copiously with food, and most
of the houses were encircled with well cultivated gardens.</p>
<p>Some of those islanders raised fowls, and disposed of them at
the market in the town. We accepted the invitation of one of
those honest people, who insisted on treating us with new laid
eggs.</p>
<p>Most of the gardens were surrounded with shrubs, among which
we distinguished the <i>jatropha curcas</i>, which being planted
close together, formed a good fence. Its feeds have a very
agreeable taste, resembling that of the hazle-nut. The natives
apprized us, that, when eaten even in a small quantity, they
induced great drowsiness. They did not know that the narcotic
quality resides in the part, known to the botanists by the name
of the embryo; and I had the pleasure of showing them, that, when
this part is removed, the kernel may be eaten, without any
inconvenience.</p>
<p>Advancing farther into the country, we observed some
individuals of the arnotto, <i>bixa orellana</i>, which were
cultivated with little care. When we had reached the entrance of
the road, we saw at a distance several large canoes striving to
make it, and some others which had nearly gained that object.</p>
<p>Our little canoe had arrived at the place of rendezvous, when
the boisterous tide raised waves, which did not a little
embarrass the steersman, the sea being at the same time very much
broken. It was, in short, absolutely necessary for us to wait
till it was calmed, before we could go on board, in order to
proceed to the other tide of the road, which was the most distant
excursion we had hitherto made.</p>
<p>For some time we kept along the shore, in order that we might
the more easily oppose the tide, and compensate the lee-way,
which was occasioned by the force of the current. Near the
extremity of the road, a great number of dolphins (<i>delphinus
delphis</i>), darting rapidly. through the water, passed us at so
small a distance, as to make such of us as could not swim,
seriously afraid that we should be overset.</p>
<p>We immediately landed near a little habitation, situated near
one of the finest parts of the island.</p>
<p>The fishermen on the other side had provided us abundantly
with their article, which one of our number had a mind to dress,
after the fashion of the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands,
who use the milk of the cocoa-nut as their only sauce to this
dish, so much praised by Captain Cook, he made an addition of
pimento. We had the satisfaction to observe, that this
composition was extremely agreeable to our hosts, to whom it was
unknown; and they cheerfully furnished our guides with every
thing necessary to succeed compleatly in preparing it. He who
gave directions for the composition of this excellent mess,
acquired among the inhabitants the reputation of being a very
good cook; and we were much diverted by their perpetually asking
us, if he was not the chief cook on board of our ship.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of this cottage, I admired the beauties of the
shrub, known by the name of <i>abroma augusta</i>. The
<i>hedysarum umbellatum</i> made a distinguished figure, amidst
several new species of the same genus. The nutmeg-trees invited
to this spot pigeons, of the species <i>columba alba</i>, Linn.
The crops of those which we killed were full of nutmegs.</p>
<p>The excessive perspiration, occasioned by the heat of the
climate, often induce cutaneous diseases. The bodies of five of
our hosts were covered with dry tetters, the scales of which
falling off, were immediately, succeeded by fresh ones; and
appeared the more conspicuous, on account of the colour being a
contrast to the copper tint of their skins. This malady
frequently invades every part of the body. We also saw some
children, who were affected by another cutaneous disorder, from
which they did not appear to suffer any pain; almost the whole of
their bodies were covered with large warts, not much more than an
inch distant from each other.</p>
<p>I seldom visited a cottage at Amboyna, in which I did not find
instruments of music; and I met with one here, which I never saw
any where else. It was a sort of hautboy, the lower extremity of
which terminated in two diverging branches pierced with holes in
the same order in each, and thus forming two flutes, both
sounding the same notes. The natives love to play in unison, and
apply one hand to each branch.</p>
<p>I returned to the town, in a dark night, whew the water in the
road, presented to my view collections of little bodies, which
illuminated large portions of the surface. The water which I took
up in the most luminous parts, left on the filtre, through which
they were passed, little molecules which differed in no respect
from those which I had already examined, before our arrival at
the Cape of Good Hope, and in other places, at a great distance
from land. We made the land near the town, at the moment of high
water, and were obliged to wade, more than 150 toises, through
the water, which was so shallow as not to admit our canoes to
come near enough the shore to land us. The fishermen were
kindling their fires to decoy the fish, which the tide had
brought thither in such numbers, that we saw their nets filled
with them.</p>
<p>9th and 10th. The two next days were employed in viewing the
vicinity of the town. I was surprized to find in so small an
island, so many different species of vegetables; but doubtless
its proximity to Ceram had enriched it with part of the plants of
that extensive island.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Governor gave an entertainment, this
having been the anniversary of one of his sons, who was in Europe
finishing his education. All the naturalists were invited, and we
made our appearance at the Government-house, an hour after
sun-set. As the coolness of the atmosphere was not then
inconsistent with dancing, the ball had already begun, and
several country dances were formed in the great saloon, in which
the Governor received us, on our first visit along with General
Dentrecasteaux.</p>
<p>This saloon was a kind of gallery, which was decorated with
some engravings, and a few very indifferent pictures, placed at a
great distance from each other. The walls were only plastered
with some coats of lime; although it would not have been
difficult to have adorned them with fine wainscotting at a small
expence; as the island produces several kinds of wood proper for
inlaid work.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The number of scorpions and solopendr&aelig;x
(or forty-legs) before observed to have been brought on board
with the wood taken in at Carteret harbour, might have suggested
to the Author, that wainscotting only serves as an asylum to
those and other vile infects, which swarm in most tropical
countries. For the same reason, a great number of prints and
pictures are inconvenient, and it is scarcely possible to
preserve paper from the attacks and the excrements of insects.
Plain painting and white-washing are almost the only decorations,
which the insides of houses conveniently admit in those climates;
as the Author would have discovered, if he had continued to
reside in them.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>Almost all the daughters of the Company's servants were at the
ball. The heat of the clime certainly forbade all violent motion;
yet we were surprized to see the young ladies dance, in a manner
so very unfavourable to the display of their graces. They
contented themselves with walking slowly, scarcely observing the
figures, and their supine air formed a strong contrast with the
extreme quickness, which the composer had given to the country
dances which they performed.</p>
<p>The orchestra consisted of four negroes, who played on the
violin, and another who performed on the bass.</p>
<p>The ball was succeeded by a splendid supper, which was served
up in the same apartment.</p>
<p>From the small number present at half an hour past nine, I
supposed that the party at supper would not be numerous; but the
greater part of the guests, not caring for the dance, did not
come till about ten at night.</p>
<p>Gaiety prevailed at this entertainment, which lasted a good
part of the night; and the dancing was resumed, and continued
till sun-rise.</p>
<p>We were surprized that we had not the company of M. Strampser,
one of the ministers of the Protestant persuasion, who had
received us so kindly; but we soon learned that he had lately
incurred the displeasure of the Governor, because forsooth, after
having diligently attended to the education of that gentleman's
children, for several years, the poor Man had requested payment!
It might well be supposed, that the boasted honour of having
educated the children of the Governor, was a compensation not
quite sufficient for a man who had a family of his own; but he
could obtain nothing more!!</p>
<p>11th. I employed a part of this day, in surveying the beauties
of several gardens, and among the plants which adorned them, I
observed the Chinese box-tree, <i>murraya exotica</i>, which
formed very fine avenues, also the mixed carmanthine, <i>justitia
variegata</i>, and the variegated turnsole, <i>croton
variegatum</i>, so remarkable for the beauty of their flowers and
their foliage.</p>
<p>The <i>lawsonia inermis</i>, called by the natives,
<i>boungnia laca</i>, is employed as on the continent of Asia, to
stain certain parts of the body, and particularly the extremities
of the fingers. The Chinese make the most use of this
article.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards I came to a cottage, surrounded with a great
number of cocoa-nuts, suspended from the leaves of the roof, and
from the adjoining trees. The owner of this cabin, pointing to
his numerous family, told me that he was preparing to make a
large plantation of cocoa-nut trees. Most of those nuts had
germinated, and he said that the plants must be about eighteen
inches in height, before they were committed to the earth,
assuring me that, but for this precaution, many of them would
rot, without springing up.</p>
<p>As the moment of our departure from Amboyna approached, I sent
on board the collections, which I had made in that charming
island, and on the 13th I followed them in person.</p>
<p>14th. The express orders, which had been issued the evening
before, for every one belonging to the expedition to repair on
board the frigates, made us suppose that every thing was ready
for our departure, and that nothing but contrary winds could
prevent us from sailing. A part, however, of the water, which had
been consumed while we lay at anchor, still remained to be
replaced; and, as this business was not finished till the
afternoon, we could not take our departure till the next day.</p>
<p>The people belonging to the ships were very well satisfied
with this relaxation. They had enjoyed as much leisure as they
could desire, and slaves had even been employed to bring on board
our complement of wood and water, in the large shallops which
they call <i>yacou</i>.</p>
<p>Our ship had been caulked, and having been surveyed, with
scrupulous attention, was found to be generally in good
condition.</p>
<p>The island of Amboyna, called Ambon by the natives, was then
the Dutch government in India, which ranked next to the general
one of Batavia.</p>
<p>The latitude of the place of the observatory, towards the
western extremity of the town, was found to be 3&deg; 41' 40" S.
and its longitude 126&deg; 9' E.</p>
<p>The variation of the compass there, was 1&deg; 13' 20" W.</p>
<p>A flat dipping needle gave 3&deg; of inclination.</p>
<p>Although the heat was oppressive, the thermometer varied
regularly every day, only from 22&deg; to 25&deg;.</p>
<p>The barometer kept constantly at 28 inches two lines, its
variation not exceeding one line.</p>
<p>At the place where we lay at anchor, the time of high water,
at the full and change of the moon, was at half an hour past
twelve at noon, and the water rose about eight feet. The tides
take place twice a day.</p>
<p>The road of Amboyna forms a channel about 10,200 toises in
length, and its mean breadth is about 3,400 toises. In many
places, towards the sides, there is good anchorage,
notwithstanding that the bottom, in some situations, is coral.
About the middle, the depth is too great for anchoring.</p>
<p>The fort, which is called Victory. Fort, is built with bricks,
and the Governor and some of the members of the council reside in
it. It was then falling into ruin, and from every gun which was
fired, it sustained some damage.</p>
<p>The garrison was composed of about two hundred men; the
greater part of them natives of the island; the rest were
European soldiers in the Company's service, and a weak detachment
of the regiment of Wirtemberg.</p>
<p>Most of the European soldiers were tormented with the desire
of revisiting their native country; but none of them had yet seen
the happy moment of return. Some who had been amused with this
vain hope, for many years, were a source of dejection to the
rest.</p>
<p>The small number of soldiers who survive any long residence in
India, renders those who have passed some years there, still more
valuable; and hence the Dutch East India Company seldom fulfil
their promise to allow the men, whose time is expired, to return
to Europe. Every method is tried, in order to induce them to make
a fresh engagement; and they who carefully avoid every
stipulation, which can tend to prolong their confinement in the
island, do not the sooner obtain their liberty. I have met some
of those unhappy men who had been detained in the island more
than twenty years; although, in conformity with the terms of
their agreement, they ought to have been then free.</p>
<p>The Island of Amboyna is divided into several districts, which
in many places, form so mangy villages, called <i>nygri</i>. The
command of each <i>nygri</i> is conferred on a native, who is
decorated with the title of <i>orencaye</i>. This man, to whom
the police of his little canton is entrusted, is himself
altogether subordinate to the Dutch government, to whom all
weighty cases are referred. The Dutch commonly chuse for
orancayes, natives who profess the Protestant religion,
preferring the ancient chiefs, or their nearer relations, and
above all those who are richer.</p>
<p>Each of those orancayes has the government of about one
hundred natives. The Dutch Company, when they invest them with
their authority, present them with a silver-hilted sword. Those
chiefs are cloathed in the European stile, all in black, and they
wear three-cocked hats, very much pointed and depressed. Of this
dress of ceremony, shoes form a part, which they wear when they
are obliged to appear in public, or in the presence of their
Dutch superiors.</p>
<p>The title orancaye is compounded of two Malayan words <i>oran
kaya</i>, the literal translation of which is, a rich man.</p>
<p>The dignity of orancaye, is by no means an empty title; it
gives those petty chiefs the means of making their fortune, which
they seldom fail to do, although very vexatiously to those who
are subjected to them; for when raising contributions on the poor
Amboynians, on account of the agents of the Company, they take
care not to neglect their own interests. It nevertheless happens
sometimes, that their fortunes decline faster than they
increased, when the agents of the Company find the means of
turning the avarice of the orancayes to their own advantage.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Amboyna speak the Malayan language, which
is very soft. Its analogy with the language spoken in the South
Sea Islands, has induced me to present the reader, at the end of
the second volume, with a very copious vocabulary, which I
collected at Amboyna and in the island of Java, where I remained
a long time, at the close of this expedition.</p>
<p>The use of betel has been established among those people, time
immemorial. They take some young leaves of the pepper tree called
<i>piper striboa</i>, in Malay <i>firi</i>, and having covered
them with a little very fine lime, made of burnt shells, and
newly slaked, they chew them with the arec-nut. Some of them
always continue this amusement, except when they are eating or
sleeping. I was much surprized that, notwithstanding their
incessant use of lime, those people had in general very sound
teeth. They become, however, of a blackish colour, which
penetrates the enamel without diminishing its polish. They are in
the practice of cleaning them frequently with a powder which is
not very far fetched; for it consists merely of a calcareous
stone of moderate hardness, which they pound between two pieces
of hard grey stone. They also use a small quantity of this last
stone, to rub the external part of their incisive teeth.</p>
<p>Those people, not content with chewing the betel, import from
Malacca an extract of a bitter plant, known by the name of
<i>gamber</i>, which they use for mastication.</p>
<p>Mountains of moderate elevation cover Amboyna, and principally
the eastern part of that island.</p>
<p>The coffee which they gather appeared to us inferior to that
of the Isles of France and of the Reunion. Besides, the Dutch
settled in the Moluccas, are very careless in its preparation.
Their domestics are in the practice of subjecting it to a degree
of torrefaction, which almost reduces it to a cinder, in order
that they may have the less trouble in pounding it, with the
wooden pestles and mortars, which are the only machines they use
for this purpose.</p>
<p>The greater part of the marshy grounds are allotted to the
cultivation of the sago tree, which furnishes the inhabitants
with wholesome food. It forms an article of their sea-stores for
long voyages, as does also the Canary almond, which they dry for
preservation. That almond has likewise a very agreeable taste
when newly gathered.</p>
<p>The rice consumed at Amboyna is not the produce of that
island. Yet it would succeed well, on most of the low lands,
where the water which issues from the bases of the mountains,
presents very convenient situations for its culture. But the
Dutch East India Company has prohibited the application of the
land to this article; because the purchase of it drains from the
island the specie paid by the Company for cloves. Thus those
monopolists prevent the accumulation of ready money, and procure,
at a very moderate rate, the produce of the labour of the
inhabitants. Besides, as rice is much used by persons in
tolerable circumstances, it is found to be a branch of lucrative
commerce to the Company's agents, who import it chiefly from the
island of Java.</p>
<p>By such means that Government, exclusively consulting its own
interests, cramps the industry of the natives, by obliging them
to abandon, so to speak, every sort of cultivation; except those
of cloves and nutmegs.</p>
<p>The Dutch also take care to limit the cultivation of spices,
in order that the quantity produced may not much exceed the
ordinary demand. Those measures, though destructive of all
activity, are, however, well suited to the supine disposition of
those people.</p>
<p>Many farinaceous roots, and a variety of trees, afford them
abundant supplies of food, almost without cultivation; as is
nature had thus intended to compensate man, for the inactivity to
which the seems to have condemned him, in so sultry a
climate.</p>
<p>Engrafting would doubtless contribute to improve the various
fruits produced in this island; but no person, even among the
Europeans, has yet succeeded in that experiment; for they have
always allowed the joint to dry, before the circulation of the
sap was fairly established between the stock and the scion. It
would, however, have been easy to prevent that accident by
keeping the part in a suitable state of moisture, till the
junction was fairly formed.</p>
<p>The European kinds of pulse are but little adapted to the heat
of the climate.</p>
<p>A very small banana, called <i>pifang raja</i>, is looked upon
as the best kind. Next to the <i>litchi</i> and the mango, it
appeared to me the best fruit in Amboyna. They have several
species of the litchi, among which ought to be reckoned the
<i>nephelium lappaceum</i>, or the <i>ramb-outan</i> of the
Malays. Those celebrated botanists, Linn&aelig;us, Jussieu and
G&aelig;rtner, were mistaken in the classification of that genus;
doubtless, because they had not an opportunity of examining its
parts of fructification, in a state of perfection.</p>
<p>Linn&aelig;us has classed it among the euphorbia, Jussieu
among the composites, and G&aelig;rtner among the
amentace&aelig;; but it evidently belongs to the tribe of
soap-berry trees (<i>Sapindus saponaria</i>, Linn.).</p>
<p>The same restrictive system, which we experienced at the Cape
of Good Hope, also prevails at Amboyna. In order to prevent any
augmentation in the price of commodities, the Company undertook
to furnish us with provisions; and gave the natives a trifling
price, for articles which they sold to us at a very great
advance.</p>
<p>The Dutch have transformed a custom still more pernicious into
a law, which authorizes the chiefs employed by the Company to
take from the natives, without any payment, the provisions
necessary for their daily consumption. Nothing can be imagined
more oppressive than this arbitrary contribution. The most
laborious man, like the most lazy, is almost sure of being
stripped of every thing but a scanty subsistence. Hence most of
the natives content themselves with the easiest species of
cultivation, passing in idleness that time which, under a
different government, they might have employed in placing
themselves in easy circumstances.</p>
<p>The fiscal, who superintends the police, compleats the
oppression of the inhabitants. That officer has the power of
imposing, <i>for his own benefit</i>, pecuniary sines, which he
fixes according to the measure of his own rapacity, and the
circumstances of the natives, whom he is often pleased to find
guilty, when they have not committed the slightest offence!! A
Mr. M'Kay, however, then exercised that office in a manner very
different from that of most of his predecessors. The inhabitants
very much extolled his humanity, which was the more praiseworthy,
as he had it in his power to do them every possible mischief with
impunity. That brave man told us, that he preferred mediocrity of
fortune to riches obtained by such means. Mr. M'Kay, when
explaining to us one day the prerogatives of his office, informed
us that some of our sailors had caused a riot, at an unseasonable
hour of the night, in the house of a very rich Chinese, who sold
arrack and other spirituous liquors; adding, with much frankness,
that the powers with which he was invested entitled him to extort
a large sum from the Chinese, by way of fine, and to convert it
to his own use. Others, said he, would not have scrupled to have
availed themselves of such an opportunity; but I never had
occasion to repent of my moderation.</p>
<p>The clove is the principal article of produce at Amboyna, and
several little islands to the eastward of it, where it succeeds
extremely well. The Dutch have placed residents there, to prevent
the exportation of that precious commodity.</p>
<p>The nature of the soil of Banda appeared me more favourable to
the cultivation of nutmegs than that of Amboyna; for it is
generally acknowledged that the nutmegs of the latter island are
inferior to those of the former.</p>
<p>Nutmeg-trees and clove-trees were formerly diffused over the
islands of Ternate, Tidor, Makian, &amp;c. in much greater
abundance than in Amboyna and Banda; but the Dutch, determined to
appropriate to themselves the exclusive benefit of those precious
trees, obliged the chiefs of the first-mentioned islands to
destroy the plantations of them. Their agents, who reside there,
make very rigorous visitations, in order to see this order
executed; and those articles are only cultivated at Amboyna, and
the other islands immediately dependent on the Company, where
they can exercise continual vigilance. This inquisition, imposed
by Dutch avarice, is very much frustrated by the birds, which
convey to the neighbouring islands the seeds of the spice-trees
from those where they are cultivated. This circumstance made the
Company resolve to settle residents in those islands, whose
principal business it is, continually to search for and destroy
all the young spice-trees they can meet with. But it also often
happens that the seeds are dropped in situations so precipitous,
as to escape the most active vigilance.</p>
<p>The slaves introduced into the Moluccas, are chiefly brought
from Macassar and Ceram. The women of Macassar are generally of a
middling stature, and have agreeable features. Their hair is not
crisped; and their complexion, though still more yellow than that
of European women labouring under the chlorosis, yet procures
them, from the natives of the Moluccas, the name of white women,
<i>paranpouang pouti</i>.</p>
<p>Before the Dutch established the slave-trade, the islanders of
Ceram were in the barbarous practice of devouring their prisoners
of war. It is melancholy to learn that they have abandoned that
atrocious custom, only because they turn their captives to better
account by selling them. If this change of system has been
attended with an apparent good, it must also give rise to more
frequent wars. Man must indeed have sunk to extreme degradation,
when the introduction of slavery becomes instrumental to his
civilization! This, however, may be said of a people who were
formerly cannibals.</p>
<p>The Dutch settled in the Moluccas, speak the Malayan language
to their slaves; taking special care not to teach them their own
mother-tongue, lest the slaves should understand their
conversation among themselves.</p>
<p>As soon as the Dutch had secured the exclusive commerce of the
Moluccas, they endeavoured to ascertain the population of those
islands, and, by exaggeration in that particular, in order to
convey a great idea of the subjugated country, they stated it at
150,000 souls, which, according to universal opinion, and the
most recent estimates, is double the number of people in the
Moluccas.</p>
<p>The quantity of cloves annually produced in that settlement is
about 2,000 packages, each 534 pounds avoirdupois. The crop of
two years forms the cargoes of three ships, two of which are sent
in one year, and the third in the year following. The quantity of
cloves and nutmegs exported sometimes exceeds the consumption;
and, in that case, it is well known that the Dutch East India
Company burn the overplus, in order to keep those commodities
always at the same price.</p>
<p>In spite of all their anxiety to monopolize the spice trade,
it is computed that one-fiftieth part of the crop is annually
smuggled. As the small salaries of the Company's agents do not
allow them to make their fortunes rapidly, several of them have
recourse to means of improving their situation, which, though
certainly dangerous, are easily put in practice. And,
notwithstanding all the vigilance of the Company, their servants
succeed in depriving them of a small part of the spices.</p>
<p>It is not long since the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of
Banda were deposed and sent to Batavia, for having converted to
their own uses part of the produce of that island. But those
abuses are come to such a pitch, that this example will only
serve to make others conduct their operations with more address,
in order to prevent a discovery.</p>
<p>That contraband trade is more particularly carried on by means
of the canoes of Ceram, in the vicinity of which the spice
islands are situated; and the spices thus procured are bartered,
with English ships, for Indian silks, opium, firearms, gunpowder,
lead, hardware and tin, which the inhabitants of Ceram
exceedingly value, converting it into bracelets, earrings,
&amp;c. Some of those articles are again sold at Amboyna.</p>
<p>The Dutch have two factories at Ceram, one of them at its
north-west extremity, and the other at Savay. General
Bougainville had been misinformed when he said, that they had
been expelled from this last post. They have lost, it is true,
very extensive possessions in other parts of that large island;
but they still retain their establishment at Savay.</p>
<p>The resident who entertained General Bougainville, during his
stay at Bourou, had been dead several years. At Amboyna, we had
the pleasure of seeing his widow, who has preserved an agreeable
remembrance of that French gentleman. Such is her taste for our
language, that the has employed all the means in her power, at
that distance from Europe, to have her children instructed in
it.</p>
<p>The Chinese are almost the only strangers who are permitted to
reside at Amboyna; but they are obliged to submit to
naturalization, and thus can never return to their own country.
They are permitted to trade among the Moluccas; but it is only at
Macassar and Batavia, where vessels from China are permitted to
enter, that they can procure Chinese commodities. They are all of
a commercial turn; and some of them have purchased, at a very
high price, the exclusive privilege of dealing in certain
articles; and hence they sell them at exorbitant rates. They
practise all sorts of expedients to get money, and hence their
reputation often suffers exceedingly; but, on that head, they
seem to have lost all sensibility. Some Jews, whom the Company
permit to reside in the island, enter into commercial
competitions with those Chinese; but the Israelites are no
matches for them, the Chinese having greatly the advantage, in
point of numbers and connections.</p>
<p>The collector of the Company's revenue is a Chinese, who is
likewise charged with preserving the police among his countrymen
established in the island, and takes cognizance of such cases as
are not sufficiently important to be reserved for the decision of
the government of Amboyna. We one day paid him a visit, in
company with one of the ministers of the Protestant persuasion;
and he entertained us with excellent tea. The table was covered
with a great variety of well-preserved comfits; one of the best
was the young nut of the fruit of the sago-palm. That chief, who
is called the Chinese Captain, showed us, with an air of
satisfaction, his armorial escutcheons, variegated with a great
number of colours. Those ornaments were profusely displayed in
the apartment where he received us, and his bed was hung round
with them.</p>
<p>His house, like those of his countrymen, was in no respect
similar to those of the natives. The Chinese build much more
solidly. Their houses are constructed like those of the
Europeans, with some difference in the distribution of the
apartments. The body of the building is of wood, and the walls of
clay, thickly rough-cast, and afterwards covered with several
coats of lime.</p>
<p>The frequency of earthquakes and hurricanes makes the
inhabitants prefer wooden houses; and scarcely any other than the
public buildings are of stone. It almost always happens, that in
those moments of consternation the inhabitants are obliged to
quit their habitations, and to betake themselves to little cabins
very slightly constructed, where they are much more safe than in
their houses, which the tempests and the earthquakes sometimes
overturn.</p>
<p>We enjoyed excellent weather at Amboyna; the winds were never
violent, and those which we had from the south-east and
north-west, were very weak.</p>
<p>The market for the different fruits of the country is in the
Chinese quarter. The Malays, like the Arabians, call it by the
name of <i>bazar</i>. The dealers assemble there, chiefly in the
evening, and remain till nine at night, each of them being
lighted with one or two torches, composed of the resin called
<i>dammer</i>, furnished by a species of <i>cycas</i>, of the
same name; (<i>dammara alba, Rumph. Amb</i>. vol. ii. chap. xii,
tab. 57.) They inclose this resin in sago tree leaves, without
any central wick. It burns with very little smoke; but care must
be taken to remove the covering, as it is reduced into a cinder,
and to trim it level with the resin. Those people are lighted at
a very small expence; for a dammer torch, eight inches in length,
and about an inch and a quarter in thickness, costs them not
one-sixtieth of a penny sterling, and yields a very clear light
for three hours. Their cottages are lighted with the same
rein.</p>
<p>Besides the fruit, there are some other eatables sold in that
Bazar. In a sultry climate, and an extremely humid atmosphere,
fish would soon putrefy, if it was not quickly dried; and hence
more dried than fresh fish is sold in that market. When the fish
is prepared with the smoke of a small fire, its taste is
preferred by the inhabitants to that of fresh fish.</p>
<p>The Molucca islands, after having been long under the dominion
of the Arabians, the Moors, and the Malays, came at last under
that of the Europeans. The Portuguese, the Spaniards, and the
Dutch, contended for that dominion, and established their
factories and their forts in those islands. The Dutch finally
prevailed, and have for many years enjoyed the monopoly of their
spices. Those different sovereigns have produced such a change in
the manners of the natives of Amboyna, that it is now difficult
to discover any traces of their original character. The
Portuguese introduced among those people the catholic religion.
The Dutch have used their utmost efforts to render them
Protestants, thinking that one of the most likely means to
subjugate them. Hence they have a great number of schools, where
the children of the natives are instructed in that religion, and
in reading and writing Malayan. Service is performed in that
language, in a church appropriated to the use of the natives; and
in Dutch in another church, attended by the Europeans. There are
two ministers belonging to each.</p>
<p>The Chinese, as may well be supposed, have a pagoda in this
place.</p>
<p>Some natives, who still adhere to the religion introduced by
the Arabs and the Moors, are provided with a mosque. The greatest
number of true believers are settled on the other side of the
road, to the northward of the town. The Dutch have succeeded much
better in making proselytes to their religion, in the vicinity of
their principal settlement. The iron rod, with which they truth
those miserable people, has reduced them so nearly to the
condition of slavery, that it will not excite surprize, if we
observe in them some of the vices which originate in that state
of human degradation.</p>
<p>Although those people be habituated to resign almost every
thing they possess to the Europeans, there is one article which
they are not disposed to resigns to them. Jealousy reigns among
them to an extreme, which makes any indiscreet proposal to their
women very dangerous. In such a case no dread of punishment would
prevent them from executing their vengeance.</p>
<p>The Dutch men preserve their European clothes as a sort of
ceremonial dress; but they have all veils with sleeves, in order
that they may conveniently throw off their coats, when the master
of the house, to which they happen to be invited, sets them the
example. On such occasions, those who wear wigs, lay them aside,
and put on large caps of very fine linen. The European women over
a petticoat, which falls very low, wear a gown made like a shirt,
as long as the petticoat, and which being divided in the fore
part, is kept close to the body by a girdle. Their hair is formed
into a spiral behind the head, and fastened with two large pins,
which cross each other. Such is the ordinary dress of the
European ladies. The native women, in good circumstances, who,
live in the town, wear dresses of the same form, but commonly
black; by the country women, blue is preferred to every other
colour.</p>
<p>The female slaves wear a sort of shift, by way of a gown; but
it is not divided before, like that of the free women.</p>
<p>The free men dress their hair with a bent comb. The slaves tie
it up with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>The Chinese, it is well known, received spices from the
Moluccas many ages before those islands were seized upon by the
Europeans. The Greeks and Romans were also acquainted with them;
and they were long objects of research with the navigators who
first penetrated into the oriental seas.</p>
<p>Those aromatics were then confined to a small number of
islands; but have been since transplanted into very distant
countries, where they succeed perfectly well. We have grounds to
hope, that our colony of Cayenne, will one day rival the
Moluccas, and by producing a much greater quantity of spices,
will diminish their price, and bring them into more general use.
Those articles are also successfully cultivated. in the isles of
France and Bourbon.</p>
<p>We took on board the Recherche two hinds and a stag, with a
design to enrich New Holland with that beautiful species of
quadrupeds.</p>
<p>We provided a good stock of fowls, common ducks, and Senegal
ducks, (<i>oies de Guin&eacute;e</i>.)</p>
<p>The <i>cazoard</i> was not included among our live stock. That
bird, though kept in the poultry-yards at Amboyna, is not very
easily procured, not being a native of that island, but imported
from the great islands to the eastward. It does not well agree
with long voyages, and besides its flesh is black, tough and dry.
In proportion to the room, which it would have occupied on board,
that bird would have afforded us much less food than the poultry
which we had already provided; for except its thighs which are
muscular, being intended by nature for running, the rest of its
body is of a very moderate size, in proportion to its height.</p>
<p>Our roots were chiefly potatoes and yams.</p>
<p>The beautiful leaves of the banana tree, and different kinds
of melons adorned the stern of our ship.</p>
<p>We bought a good number of hogs and goats.</p>
<p>We took much care of our cow; although her milk was exhausted;
for it would have been impossible to have procured another. The
species of buffalo common in India, is indeed a sort of domestic
animal at Amboyna; but the female of that quadruped gives little
milk, and being almost untameable, would have been very
troublesome, not to say dangerous, on board.</p>
<p>Our butcher, whose business it was to take care of the
quadrupeds, could procure them little food but what was hard and
dry, consisting, in a great measure, of the <i>anthistiria
ciliata</i>; but happily, before we sailed, he was enabled to
provide the large stocks of banana trees which, for a long time,
afforded those animals succulent food. They were allowed but
little water, the abundant juice of those plants were extremely
serviceable to them.</p>
<p>The flour which we procured at Amboyna, was but of a middling
quality, and the quantity with which they could furnish us, was
but about 11,000lbs avoirdupois. This scarcity, whether real or
pretended, obliged us to purchase it at an exorbitant price.</p>
<p>We found at Amboyna but few articles of European provision.
The Lieutenant-Governor, however, had a considerable quantity of
Hamburgh beef, which is in great request among navigators. That
officer very willingly let our Commander have a part of it; but
when we had got out to sea, we discovered that his servants had
dishonestly withheld the most juicy pieces of the beef, and had
substituted the same weight of the bony and tendinous parts.</p>
<p>The young shoots of the bamboo, cut into slices, and preserved
in vinegar, are excellent pickles, in a long voyage, and we
provided abundance of them. Those young shoots are generally very
tender, is care be taken to gather them in proper time. They are
sold in the market as pulse, for which they are a good
substitute. They are often above three feet in length, and
considerably more than an inch in thickness.</p>
<p>We also furnished ourselves with cloves and nutmegs, preserved
in sugar. The rind of the nutmeg is the only part fit for this
purpose; and unfortunately the blundering confectioners had
chosen such as were too far advanced, as were also the cloves,
which, having reached the size of middling olives, had acquired
too much of the aromatic flavour to form an agreeable preserve. A
man must have an Indian palace, who wishes to enjoy those
delicacies. I may say the same thing of the preserved ginger,
with which we were provided.</p>
<p>Our store of sago was by far too great; for we used only a
small part of it. Our people never could reconcile themselves to
that food, wholesome as it was; and, notwithstanding all the
arguments of our chief surgeon, they, in some months, conceived
such an aversion to it, as to give the preference to salted
provisions of the worst quality.</p>
<p>We had but few hogsheads of wine remaining, which were fit for
use. The only spirituous liquor we could procure was arrack, of
which we purchased several hogsheads. Some navigators are too
lavish in their praises of that liquor, which is not even so good
as middling French brandy.</p>

<p align="center"><small>OCTOBER 15th [1792].</small></p>
<p>WE only waited for a fair wind, to take our departure. At half
an hour past seven a.m. having a small breeze from the south-east
we immediately weighed anchor, and about eleven o'clock, we had
reached the entrance of the road, the western point of which bore
W. 6&deg; 15' N. and the eastern E. 6&deg; 15' S. our distance
from this last being about 1,200 toises.</p>
<p>Our meridian observations gave the latitude of the most
westerly part of Amboyna, 3&deg; 46' 54" south, and its longitude
125&deg; 53' 28" east.</p>
<p>The breeze continuing all the day at south-east, we kept close
to the wind, on the larboard-tack.</p>
<p>One of the boys of the large Dutch East-Indiaman, which had
just sailed for Batavia, had hid himself on board the Recherche,
and made his appearance at the very instant when the Captain of
the Esperance, acquainted the General, that he had discovered, on
board his ship, six fugitives from Amboyna, namely, three of the
Company's soldiers, a sailor and two negro slaves. Those unhappy
men had made their escape from a country, where they groaned
under an almost equal state of servitude!</p>
<p>The Commodore had allowed the people to bring pigs and fowls
on board, for their private use; and all parts of the ship were
lumbered with them, but especially between decks; and they were
the more troublesome, as the disagreeable odour which they
diffused, was considerably increased by the heat of the
climate.</p>
<p>19th. This evening, when we were in latitude 7&deg; 10' south,
and longitude 123&deg; 14' east; the compass had no
variation.</p>
<p>21st. This morning early; we saw a ph&oelig;nomenon, which we
had already observed several times, and which never fails to
alarm navigators, who sometimes, during the night, take it for
the effect of breakers. The air being scarcely in motion, we
observed the sea foaming at some distance. Waves followed each
other in quick succession, and we were fast approaching to the
spot. A very heavy swell, occasioned by the sea receiving an
impulse contrary to that communicated to it in the preceding
night, succeeded the agitation of the water. The cause appeared
to me to depend on the tide struggling between lands, where the
currents acquire a velocity proportioned to the confinement of
the channel.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock in, the morning, we saw Kisser island,
extending from S. to E&frac14;S.E. It is very mountainous,
especially on the western side. Its greatest dimension is from
W.S.W. to E.N.E. It is situated in 8&deg; 13' 2" south latitude
and 123&deg; 32' 17" east longitude.</p>
<p>Dark weather prevented us, till about three o'clock p.m. from
seeing the north side of the island of Timor, although our
distance from it was then but about 5,000 toises. Its lofty
mountains rose above the clouds, and during the night we had
observed, fires at different elevations, on their sides.
Doubtless the inhabitants, at those altitudes, find it
comfortable to correct by fires the cold air of the night, and
perhaps also they may use them to fray away the wild beasts.
Those fires served as so many light-houses to direct our course
along shore, when some gentle breezes interrupted the calm which
prevailed for a great part of the night.</p>
<p>24th. About seven in the morning, we were within 2,500 toises
of Laphao, a little Portuguese settlement, on the west side of
Timor, in lat. 9&deg; 22' 45" S. and long. 122&deg; 23' 36"
E.</p>
<p>The Portuguese flag hoisted there, bore S. 30&deg; E. They
saluted us with five guns. A canoe with a double outrigger,
immediately came off to view our ships, to which it very nearly,
approached; but instantly returned towards the shore, without
hailing us. On coming still nearer the land, we saw both natives
and canoes, upon the sandy beach. We sounded several times, with
thirty fathoms of line; but found no bottom.</p>
<p>About four o'clock p.m. we saw the Island of Batou, bearing
south-east, distant about 10,000 toises. It is separated from
Timor, only by an interval of 2,500 toises.</p>
<p>26th. Calms being frequent on the coast of Timor, we stood off
shore this afternoon, by help of a breeze from the south, and
steered towards the west; but without finding a steadier wind.
Those calms appear to be caused by the heats, which at that
season of the year are the more violent, as the sun darts his
rays almost perpendicularly.</p>
<p>The continuance of the calms renders the navigation very
troublesome along those coasts, on which there is always danger
of being thrown by the currents. The great irregularity of those
currents, renders it very difficult to construct charts of those
coasts; and hence the great disagreement between those which have
been hitherto offered to the public.</p>
<p>A great number of whales of different species, several times
surrounded our ship, and leaped out of the water close alongside.
From the little fear with which they approached us, we concluded
that they had never been pursued by fishers.</p>
<p>We were pestered with the species of parrot called lorries, of
which our people had bought a great number at Amboyna. Their
piercing cries gave us no rest in the day time. Their new
situation, on board ship, did not agree with them, for they died
daily. They were seized with convulsions for which we found
vitriolic ether a palliative; but it did not preserve their
lives.</p>
<p>The mortality also spread among our feathered flock, the
greater part of which were seized with violent diseases in the
eyes, in consequence of the coldness of the nights; and those
which were deprived of sight, soon died of hunger. It would,
however, have been very easy to have, prevented that disagreeable
circumstance, by sheltering them from the night air, with a sail
properly spread over their coops.</p>
<p>The water, which we took in at Amboyna, did not justify the
great encomiums bestowed upon it, for keeping well at sea. It had
already become so putrid, that it could not be drunk, till the
inflammable air, with which, fortunately, it was but weakly
united, had been expelled by strong agitation. This unexpected
decomposition certainly arose from the negligence with which the
cases had been cleansed. There remained enough of the
fermentative principle of the old water, quickly to corrupt the
new.</p>
<p>It is certainly very disagreeable to be obliged to drink the
corrupted water of salt marshes; but it is encouraging to know
that by agitating it some minutes, as I have shown, it resumes
its original purity.</p>
<p>At half an hour past four a.m. we saw, by star light, the
island of Savu, extending from W. 13&deg; S. to S. 27&deg; W. at
the distance of 1,000 toises. We steered west, in order to pass
to the northward of that little island; and about half past nine,
we were abreast of the bay in which Captain Cook anchored, in his
second voyage, after having passed Endeavour Straits. We
distinguished five canoes plying very near the shore, where they
were sheltered from the waves, which spent their force upon a
little reef, level with the water.</p>
<p>The island of Savu presents an enchanting prospect; being
intersected, especially towards the south-west, by very beautiful
hills, whose gentle declivity seems to offer to the natives a
soil of easy and favourable cultivation.</p>
<p>Groups of cocoa-nut trees scattered on the shore, afford
shelter to some cottages, which additionally embellish those
charming plantations. That island, on which the Dutch have a
small settlement, is in 10&deg; 25' 48" S. lat. and 119&deg; 45'
19" E. longitude.</p>
<p>About noon, a little island, within our view, extended from S.
46&deg; 30' W. to S. 57&deg; 30' W. at the distance of 7,500
toises. It appeared to us not to exceed 5,100 toises in length.
Its latitude is 10&deg; 28' 50" S. and its longitude 119&deg; 56'
17" E.</p>
<p>29th. At six o'clock a.m. New Savu bore E. 31&deg; 30' S. at
the distance of about 5,100 toises. That little island, which is
very low, is in 10&deg; 37' 28" S. lat. and 119&deg; 2' 47" E.
longitude.</p>
<p>At sun-set, we saw a part of the island of San del Bose, in
the N.N.E. distant about 20,500 toises. It is covered with
mountains of a moderate elevation, and is situated in 10&deg; 27'
4" S. lat. and 118&deg; 6' 34" E. longitude.</p>
<p>The position of a little island, which bore from N. 1&deg; E.
to N. 3&deg; 30' W. at 20,500 toises distance, was ascertained to
be 10&deg; 27' S. lat. and 118&deg; 7' 5" E. longitude.</p>
<p>30th: This day the current ceased to set westward, and carried
us ten minutes northward. The bight in the coast of New Holland
to the south ward of Timor, probably causes this different
direction of the currents, which constantly set from east to west
through Endeavour Strait; for they soon resumed their westerly
direction, and carried us from 20 to 24 minutes daily.</p>
<p>It must be observed, that Captain Cook, after having passed
Endeavour Strait, experienced like us, a change in the currents;
for twenty-four hours, but in a still greater degree than we
did.</p>
<p>31st. After losing sight of San del Bose, we met with no other
land till our arrival on the south-west coast of New Holland. The
light winds which we experienced, made us apprehensive, that we
should arrive on that coast, too late to finish our survey of
it.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 3d. In the afternoon of this day, we were probably at
no great distance from some rocks, for we were surrounded with a
great number of birds, which never venture far from the land, and
we did not lose sight of them, till the approach of night.</p>
<p>4th. We continued to see many birds this day. Navigators in
traversing those seas, ought to redouble their vigilance, in
order to avoid the rocks, which those birds frequent.</p>
<p>16th. Our flag fell over board during the night, through an
opening, left at the extremity of the gangway, much larger than
necessity required. Besides this loss, we had to regret that one
of our hinds had been delivered over to the butcher's knife,
because it was dying with sickness. We acquainted Captain Huon
with this accident, begging him to take all possible care of his
stag; but it died before our arrival in New Holland.</p>
<p>We passed the Trials at too great a distance to have a view of
them; but we saw a great number of birds, which doubtless took
shelter there during the night.</p>
<p>The species of cockroach, called <i>blatta germanica</i>, had
multiplied to such a degree, during the months we had passed
between the tropics, as to incommode us exceedingly. Those
insects, not contented with our biscuits, gnawed our linen;
paper, &amp;c. Nothing came amiss to them. Their taste for
vegetable acids was surprizing; no sooner was a citron opened
than they attacked it; but it was still more astonishing to
observe the rapidity with which they emptied my ink-glass, when I
happened to leave it open. The causticity of the vitriol which
they swallowed, appeared to have no bad effect on them.</p>
<p>The sugar extracted from the sago-tree, which we brought from
Amboyna was a bait, which they could not resist. We destroyed
great numbers of them, by mixing a small quantity of that sugar
with water in a vessel, into which they tumbled.</p>
<p>Those insects tormented us still more in the night than in the
day. They continually disturbed our repose, by passing over any
part of our bodies which happened to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The cockroach, called <i>blatta orientalis</i>, made its
appearance on board soon after our departure from Brest; but it
soon took leave: of us, and its place was supplied by the first
mentioned species.</p>
<p>17th. This day we were carried 38' to the north-west. The
Trials, from which, we were not far distant, and some shoals,
doubtless caused very strong currents.</p>
<p>19th. This day we passed the tropic of Capricorn. The mercury
in the barometer rose, on the same day, to 28 inches 5 lines,
which appeared the more surprizing, as it varies but little in
the tropical regions. It was besides the only instance, in our
whole voyage, in which it rose so high in such a latitude.
Although the thermometer was not lower than 18&deg;, we
experienced a keen sensation of cold.</p>
<p>21st. We began to meet with variable winds, being in latitude
26&deg; S.</p>
<p>Our goats daily perished for want of proper food. We lost at
the rate of two in the day.</p>
<p>28th. About five o'clock p.m. the Esperance being to windward,
had very nearly run foul of us; though the wind was favourable
for steering. That piece of negligence in the officer of the
watch, might greatly have injured the ships, and might have
obliged us to abandon our design of visiting the south-west coast
of New Holland, which it was our business to explore, without
loss of time. But fortunately a boom, placed in the critical
moment between the ships, prevented the accident.</p>
<p>DECEMBER 6th. The appearance of several species of sea-gulls,
and other birds, which never stray far from the coast, indicated
our proximity to land. The wind blew too violently from the
S.S.W. to permit us immediately to stand in for it with safety.
Besides, the sea having been strongly agitated, and the horizon
much obscured with clouds, we resolved to steer S.E.&frac14;S.
hoping that next day circumstances would be more favourable.</p>
<p>At noon, we found our latitude to be 34&deg; 12' south, and
our longitude 112&deg; east.</p>
<p>We lay to all night, sounding many times with 112 fathoms of
line, without finding any bottom.</p>
<p>7th. About half past two in the morning, we were steering
E.S.E. and at day-break, the Esperance made the signal for land
at N.E. distant about 15,400 toises. It was the western extremity
of the south-west coast of New Holland, discovered by Lewen in
1622; being a low land, extending from N.W. to S.W.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Should not this last bearing be
S.E.?&mdash;<i>Translator.</i>]</p>
<p>At six o'clock we tried, E.&frac14; S.E. and when we came
within 5,000 toises of the coast, we followed its direction
towards the S.E. A very strong gale at W.N.W. drove us at the
rate of 15,400 toises in the hour.</p>
<p>The interior country was interspersed with sandy downs, which
had the appearance of the greatest sterility. Those small hills,
scattered on a flat country, looked at a distance like little
islands. In the intervals which separated them were some shrubs,
the blackish foliage of which, indicated a state of
suffering.</p>
<p>The peaked rocks, which rose in the midst of those sandy
plains, the explained formation of the downs, the bases of which
were doubtless composed of other rocks of the same nature, but of
forms more favourable to the accumulation of the sand by the
winds.</p>
<p>Fresh water must be scarce in such randy regions, where that
which falls from the clouds doubtless penetrates to great depths,
without meeting with strata to stop their progress.</p>
<p>This morning our blacksmith was found dead in his hammock. The
preceding evening he had partaken of a feast, which the gunners
formerly used to celebrate with exactness. They had long been
saving a considerable part of their provisions for this
entertainment. The unfortunate son of Vulcan, extenuated, like
the rest of us, by the abstinence to which we had been condemned
since our departure from Amboyna, had too much indulged his
appetite, and we were deprived of him by a stroke of the
apoplexy. This loss would have been irreparable, if good fortune
had not conduced on board of our ship, at the Cape of Good Hope,
the very intelligent workman who succeeded him.</p>
<p>At noon, being in latitude 34&deg; 45' 36" south, and
longitude 113&deg; 38' 56", the nearest part of the coast bore
N.E. distant 5,100 toises; and the land we saw, set from W.
15&deg; S. to E. 40&deg; 30' S.</p>
<p>The mountains now began to assume the appearance of a regular
chain, the highest of which did not seem to exceed 200 toises in
perpendicular elevation. We observed large tracts of them
entirely denuded of vegetation; in other places, feeble shrubs
were sparingly scattered, with here and there a tree of moderate
height.</p>
<p>The mountains sometimes presented several chains, rising by
degrees above each other.</p>
<p>At four o'clock p.m. we saw some breakers near the coast, and
a little to the eastward, two rocks 510 toises from the beach,
and which we passed at a very small distance. The largest was
remarkable for a separation in the middle, from which rose
perpendicularly, about twenty-five toises above the level of the
sea, an isolated piece, in the form of a very flat plate. I took
it and its base, to be composed of a sort of hard grey stone. We
admired the fine effect of the waves, which rising to the very
summit of the rock, assumed a colour perfectly white, and
descending again in foam, displayed that singular rock, as if it
had just emerged from the bosom of the deep.</p>
<p>The coast then extended very regularly towards E.S.E. its
little bights being terminated by points, the most prominent of
which scarcely advanced 1,000 toises into the sea.</p>
<p>Being driven by an impetuous wind, we were not without
apprehensions, on finding ourselves so near a coast which offered
us not the least shelter; but we clawed off during the night, by
steering S.S.W. A very rough sea from the W.N.W. made our ship
labour prodigiously. Having been so long accustomed to navigate
smooth seas, we had lost the habit of supporting such violent
agitation; the wind blew in impetuous squalls, and allowed us to
carry very little sail.</p>
<p>8th. About half an hour past six this morning we stood to the
north-east, towards the land, near to which a strong breeze at
west soon carried us; but we fell to leeward. The coast then
stretched almost directly eastward; and the interior land
presented the same appearance as on the preceding day. We
observed vast yellowish tracks, which appeared to consist of hard
stone, on which we did not distinguish the smallest trace of
vegetation.</p>
<p>At noon our latitude was 35&deg; 17' south, and our longitude
115&deg; 12' east. In a little time the mountains subsided, and
we came in sight of a vast plain of sand, in which were
interspersed, at great distances, little hills, of which some
formed capes, advancing a small way into the sea.</p>
<p>About four o'clock p.m. we passed a clutter of rocks, situated
near the coast, and scarcely covered with shrubs, the dismal
green of which was a proof of the sterility of the soil. At six,
we were abreast of a bay, of which we could not see the farthest
extremity. It would have afforded us perfect security against the
impetuous winds which blew, while we were upon that coast. A
foreland, which advanced from the north-west to the south-east,
near 5,000 toises into the sea, some little islands and several
rocks, situated at the entrance of that bay, presented abundant
protection from the winds in the offing; but the waves ran so
high as to prevent us from sending a boat to sound it.</p>
<p>We lay to during the whole night.</p>
<p>Being about 2,500 toises from the shore, we had soundings with
42 fathoms of line, the bottom being shells and bits of coral
mixed with very transparent quartzose sand, which seemed to me an
indication that we should have found a good bottom in the bay
which we had passed.</p>
<p>9th. During the night, a clear sky permitted us to see the
land, from which we stood off a little, having still the same
kind of bottom.</p>
<p>The west wind was not very violent, and at half past four in
the morning, we made sail, in order to stand along the coast,
which trended towards the north-east, and a little farther on,
towards the east and the south-east.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock we passed a bay, which appeared to reach
15,400 toises into the land, and to have an opening of at least
equal extent. It is exposed to the south-east wind, but secure
against that of the west.</p>
<p>Farther on, we saw in the offing some little rocks, not very
distant from the shore.</p>
<p>At noon, being in latitude 34&deg; 48' south, and longitude
116&deg; 52' east, we saw, within the land, N. 4&deg; W. a
mountain more elevated than any which we had observed, on the
preceding days. Being isolated amidst vast plains of sand, it
produced a very picturesque effect, and appeared to be about
25,500 toises distant from the coast. Its shattered summit
exposed to view many irregular peaks, most of them perpendicular.
Such peaks indeed extended over the whole mountain, which
stretched 7,600 toises from east to west. This configuration left
no room to doubt, that the rocks of which it consisted were not
extremely hard.</p>
<p>We had not yet seen the least indication of inhabitants, since
we began to coast those sterile shores. It was to be supposed,
that some springs of fresh water would attract them to the state
of that mountain; and accordingly the smoke of two fires, which
they had kindled, convinced us of their presence.</p>
<p>About half past four o'clock p.m. after having doubled a cape
terminated by some rocks near the shore, we came abreast of a bay
as wide as that which we had seen in the morning, but not
reaching so far into the land. The surrounding land was generally
very low; but we observed, towards its eastern part, some little
hills detached from each other. It offers excellent shelter from
west and south-west winds; but it is entirely exposed to those of
the south-east.</p>
<p>Tropical birds with red streaks, and some albatrosses, of a
darker colour than those commonly seen at the Cape of Good Hope,
flew around the ship.</p>
<p>We lay to all night, and sounding every hour, we had
constantly thirty-three fathoms of water, with a bottom of grey
sand.</p>
<p>10th. At half past four in the morning, we stood to
N.&frac14;N.E to get in with the coast, and we soon saw it
extending from N. 2&deg; E. to W. 25&deg; N. A clear horizon
permitted us to see other low lands, stretching towards the
north-east.</p>
<p>We soon after passed between the main land and the reefs,
which were 10,200 toises distant from it. About eight o'clock, we
left others, 12,800 toises distant; and it was not long till we
saw, that a little island which we perceived towards the east,
was connected to the land by a chain of reefs which, advancing
into the offing, obliged us to keep on its south side, till we
had doubled it.</p>
<p>Three fires successively kindled on the point of land, where
the reefs originated, apprized us that the natives were on that
spot. The produce of the sea is doubtless the principal resource
of those people, who inhabit so barren a soil.</p>
<p>At noon, we were in 34&deg; 11' south latitude, and 118&deg;
22' east longitude, when the little island already mentioned bore
N. 38&deg; W. at the distance of 1,020 toises.</p>
<p>Other fires lighted along the coast, sent up large columns of
smoke, intended no doubt, by the inhabitants, to let us know that
they were there.</p>
<p>About half past four o'clock, we stood away from a little
island, distant 20,500 toises from the coast. It was joined to a
series of reefs, which extended above 510 toises towards the
east. The lead then indicated ten fathoms water, but some time
afterwards, twenty-one fathoms of line did not reach the
bottom.</p>
<p>We were becalmed, a short space, towards the close of the day;
but a small breeze at south-east soon sprung up, and permitted us
to stretch to the south-west, which course we held during the
whole night.</p>
<p>We hove the lead every hour, and had a bottom of quartzose
sand, mixed with broken shells and coral, at a depth varying from
twenty-five to thirty-three fathoms.</p>
<p>11th. This morning, we stood towards the east, with all sails
set, having a fresh breeze from the W.N.W.</p>
<p>At six o'clock a.m. The mercury in the barometer had fallen
more than three lines. Although the weather was fine, this
certain indication of a great loss of equilibrium in the
atmosphere, merited serious attention. We nevertheless advanced
before the wind, towards the centre of a group of little islands,
about 5,100 toises from the coast, although we were uncertain of
finding a passage between them, when we saw them at a distance.
About ten o'clock, when we were intangled among them, we
discovered that they were joined together by reefs. The sky
assumed a menacing aspect, the horizon lowered in the W.S.W. and
presently the wind blew from that point, with the greatest
impetuosity. It was to no purpose, that we spent a long time in
seeking among those reefs an opening, which might allow us a
passage into the open sea; and as we had no other than that by
which we had entered, we put about, in order to gain it. The
impetuosity of the tempest having forced us to furl most of our
sails, the ship fell off so much, that we went to leeward of our
intended exit. Our running rigging giving way on all sides, our
man&oelig;uvres were much retarded. Our repeated attempts to
extricate ourselves, were unsuccessful; we always fell back into
our dangerous situation, there to beat about, in a space
abounding with sunken rocks, at different depths, on which the
ship was in danger every instant of being dashed to pieces; and
it required an experienced eye to distinguish those rocks, in a
sea so strongly agitated. Citizen Raoul, a very skilful young
mariner, in whom our Commander had great confidence, was at the
mast head, directing the movements of the ship. Many times we
were carried close to rocks concealed by the waves; but he
concluded us safely past them all, though it was very difficult
to distinguish them, even at a small distance.</p>
<p>The Esperance, which did not keep to windward so well as our
ship, was close in with the shore, having no other alternative
than to cast anchor or be stranded. About one p.m. we saw her at
a considerable distance, in a place where we did not think the
could come to an anchor. She had clued up all her sails; and we
were very uneasy about her, being apprehensive that she had
struck. But the steadiness of her masts soon removed our fears,
by shewing us that the was riding at anchor. Her distance,
however, and the force of the wind, hindered us from
distinguishing her signals.</p>
<p>We did not hesitate to have recourse to the same shelter. The
Commodore immediately gave orders to bear down under the
fore-sail; and we were soon alongside of the Esperance, which was
feebly defended from the waves by a little island. We were
advised by those on board that frigate, to steer close to the
land, in order to obtain a better station than they. In
approaching near to the little island, we had the frightful
spectacle of an impetuous sea which, when it had cleared the
south point, opened, by its precipitate fury, a gulph which
exposed to view part of the bate of the rock. The dread of coming
too near the land induced us to let go our anchor to windward of
the Esperance, but not sufficiently within the anchoring place,
to avoid falling foul of her, if our ship should drag her
anchors. The danger was so much the greater, as our sheet-anchor
could not hold fast the ship. The axes were in. readiness to cut
the masts, in order to give less hold to the wind, when our best
bower secured us in our position.</p>
<p>We now rode at anchor in nineteen fathoms of water, with a
bottom of quartzose sand, mixed with broken shells.</p>
<p>We were violently agitated by the waves, and exposed to almost
the whole force of the wind; and we were apprehensive that our
cables would give way, in which case we mull have been dashed
upon the rocks, where the waves broke in a tremendous manner.</p>
<p>In the evening, we let go a third anchor, to give us more
security against such violent agitation.</p>
<p>12th. The mercury in the barometer, which had sunk to 27
inches 8 lines, sensibly rose, as soon as day light appeared, and
announced to us the termination of the tempest.</p>
<p>The surge having considerably abated, Captain Huon sent his
boat to tell us, that on the preceding day, the Esperance was
driving towards the land so rapidly, that the was on the point of
being stranded, when Citizen Legrand, an officer of distinguished
merit, went to the mast-head, in the very midst of the tempest,
and almost immediately came down, exclaiming with enthusiasm,
that the ship was out of danger! He then pointed out the
anchoring-place, which he had viewed, and in which he was certain
that she would ride in safety. This discovery saved both the
ships; for the Recherche, obliged to beat about in the night
among dangerous rocks, after struggling as long as the could,
against the tempest, in hopes that a change of the wind would
enable her to get into the open sea, would at last have been
infallibly wrecked.</p>
<p>We gave to that bay the name of Citizen Legrand, which will
recall the signal service which that able mariner rendered to our
expedition. His advice was to come to nearer the land, and it was
to be regretted that it was not followed, for the larboard chain
by which the Esperance rode gave way in the night by the force of
the waves, and that frigate swinging by one anchor, would soon
have been driven ashore, if another anchor had not fortunately
taken hold. That ship had also lost two of her rudder-irons, and
had no spare ones to replace them. They were broken by the
violent shocks of the waves against the rudder, in the combined
motion of pitching and rolling. The motion of pitching, all
things else alike, is much quicker at anchor than at sea.</p>
<p>From the place where we lay at anchor, we reckoned twelve
little islands, besides the rocks and breakers, which afforded us
shelter. The seas, in that vast basin, sent in very heavy waves;
but fortunately we were anchored in good holding ground.</p>
<p>The little island, to leeward of which we lay at anchor, bore
from S. 25&deg; W. to W. 3&deg; N.</p>
<p>In the morning, a boat was sent thither from each ship, to
take the soundings; for we intended to come nearer to it. They
found every where an excellent bottom, and eight fathoms of
water, at a small distance from the land.</p>
<p>Some persons, in order to get on shore, were obliged to plunge
into the water, for the boat would have been stove, if it had
gone near enough to set them on shore dry.</p>
<p>Many seals, of the species which Buffon denominates <i>petit
phoque</i>, and Linn&aelig;us <i>phoca pusilla</i>, basked
quietly in the sun, upon the rocks and the sandy beach; and some
of them allowed themselves to be knocked on the head. It is
proper to observe, that the figure which Buffon gives this
amphibious animal, has undoubtedly been taken from a skin badly
stuffed; for it represents the neck much smaller than the head,
as is the case in most quadrupeds; but the seal being formed for
swimming, has nearly the shape of a fish, the head being less
than the neck.</p>
<p>In the same figure, the ears are represented as very open,
whereas they are nearly of a conical shape, without any other
aperture than a longitudinal slit. It would seem that nature
intended to hinder the water from entering the ears of that
animal; for he has the power of shutting them closely when under
the water, and of opening them, though slightly, when he
emerges.</p>
<p>On the same island, there was a numerous flock of swans,
several of which allowed themselves to be taken by the hand; but
the rest, apprized of the danger, immediately flew away. This new
species, is somewhat smaller than our wild swan, and of an
ash-coloured grey, a little lighter on the belly. The bill is
blackish, with a tumour of a sulphur-yellow at its base. The legs
are slightly tinged with red.</p>
<p>Our main-sail had suffered a small rent when we were
struggling against the tempest the preceding day. This morning we
availed ourselves of the fine weather, and shifted it.</p>
<p>13th. A small breeze at south-east, succeeded the tempest. As
the moment was favourable, we warped, early in the morning,
nearer to the shore, from whence we were then distant but about
150 toises.</p>
<p>I landed on the little island on the south-west of us. It is
mountainous, and not more than 2,050 toises in length, and 1,025
in breadth.</p>
<p>The swell was not yet sufficiently abated to allow us to land
with facility. It was necessary for us to seize the moment of the
highest surge for allowing our wherry, kept fast by a small
painter, to come close to the beach, and each time one of us
leapt on shore. As the edge of the wherry, on which it was
necessary to place the foot, in order to jump out, presented an
inclined plane, and the beach was steep, we ran the risk of
tumbling into the water, and being carried off by the surges,
which followed each other very quickly, and from which even a
good swimmer would have found it difficult to escape. That was
not the only danger we had to apprehend; for we might have fallen
a prey to a large shark, which kept at a small distance astern.
We had observed him hovering about the ship ever since day-break,
and he followed our boat as if he longed for one of us. The
chaplain of the Recherche fell into the water, and would have
been devoured by that animal, if the cockswain of the boat had
not rescued him from the danger.</p>
<p>Some sailors belonging to the Esperance, when strolling upon
the rocks, killed a number of seals of different colours; white,
grey more or less deep, and brown, bordering upon black. They
were, however, all of the same species, which has been
denominated by Buffon <i>petit phoque</i>. Their flesh was found
very good eating.</p>
<p>The little island on which we were, was composed of fine
granite or quartz. There were also quantities of feldspar and
mica; this last in blackish plates. We also observed some few
<i>spicul&aelig;</i> of black schorl. The granite lay bare in
many places. The vegetable mould, collected in the least
precipitous situations, was covered with shrubs, sometimes so
close together, as not to be easily penetrated. I plucked a
magnificent species of <i>leptospermum</i>, remarkable for its
silvery leaves, and bright red flowers.</p>
<p>I found there several new species, belonging to the tribe of
<i>thymele&aelig;</i> (mezereons), which have but two
<i>stamina</i>, and of which Forster has composed a new genus,
under the denomination of <i>banksia</i>. I also observed new
species of the <i>rumex</i>, the <i>lobelia</i> and the
<i>buplevrum</i>.</p>
<p>The western part of that little island presents, in one of its
highest parts, a plain surface of calcareous stone, the
<i>strata</i> of which follow the gentle declivity of the
mountain. Strata of the same stone doubtless formerly covered the
other parts of the island, and masses of granite served as their
bases; but probably they have tumbled down, and have left the
steep places exposed; for in the north-east, where the mountains
fall with a very gentle declivity, there are still some
calcareous stones, at a small distance from the beach. I, was not
able to discover any shells, by all the search I could make.</p>
<p>From the summit of that little island, we had a distant view
of a part of the reefs and rocks on which our ships were in
danger of being wrecked, before they arrived at this anchorage.
Their number still appalled us, and we were astonished at having
effected our escape from so many dangers.</p>
<p>Two sea-gulls, a male and a female, of the species called by
Buffon, <i>bougmestre</i>, and by Linn&aelig;us, <i>larus
fuscus</i>, perched upon the heights at a small distance from us.
The female having been shot, the male frightened by the noise of
the explosion, took to flight; but presently returned, and being
determined not to abandon his mate, was killed by her side.</p>
<p>I also fired at a seal, which lay at a distance from me.
Feeling himself wounded, and distrusting his strength, he durst
not take to the water. Immediately another very large one,
hearing the cries of that which I had wounded, came and licked
the blood with apparent satisfaction; but at the sight of a
long-boat, which was steering towards them, they plunged into the
sea.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, I saw more of those animals advancing towards
the beach. Before they ventured upon the land, they never failed
to raise their bodies nearly half out of the water, and they
remained some time in that attitude, smelling and gazing all
round, in order to discover whether or not they could safely come
and repose upon the rocks.</p>
<p>14th. As on the preceding day, I had gathered an abundant
harvest of objects of natural history, of different genera, it
became necessary for me to pass a part of this day on board, in
order to describe and prepare them.</p>
<p>About five o'clock p.m. the tents belonging to the observatory
were seat on shore to be pitched. I wished to embrace this
opportunity to make another visit to the little island. As the
tide was only beginning to rise, a landing could fill be
effected; but in a little time it would been impossible to get
back to the boat, and we should have been obliged to pass the
night on-shore. This consideration prevented several of my
companions from landing. The interval to be got over before
reaching the shore, was about twenty feet, and at every surge,
the water rose there above six feet perpendicularly. There was a
necessity for seizing the moment between the two surges, or of
running the risk of being swept into the sea, an accident which
actually happened to the surgeon's mate of the Recherche. He had
told us before hand, that he would get on shore with dry feet;
but not being sufficiently quick in his motion, he was hurried
along the shore by a violent surge. Fortunately he could swim,
and returned towards the boat; but in a very different plight
from what he had supposed, when he boasted of his agility.</p>
<p>Those who had landed were obliged to pass the night on shore,
without any other provisions than a few biscuits. Urged by
thirst, they scrambled in a very dark night, above 1,000 toises,
over rocks, in order to procure water; and, to add to their
misfortune, they found it brackish.</p>
<p>Enormous sharks, of the most common species, the <i>squalus
carcharias</i>, frequently appeared in the basin where we lay at
anchor. On board the Esperance, they caught one which was about
thirteen feet in length, and of more than proportionable
bulk.</p>
<p>As every circumstance convinced us of the impossibility of
renewing our stock of water, the officer second in command
ordered, that each person should be allowed only three quarters
of a bottle daily. At the same time he, as well as the Commander
in Chief, used it without restriction. I thought, however, that
water was one of those articles, the enjoyment or privation of
which ought to have been extended to all, without
distinction.</p>
<p>15th. The geographical engineer of the Recherche, set out at
day-break, in the barge, to survey the little group of islands,
to examine whether there was any passage to the eastward, between
the rocks, and to look out for a proper watering place. I
ardently wished to have joined this expedition; but as
geographical operations have but little connection with
researches in natural history, we were not apprized of the hour
of departure, for which every thing was arranged so
clandestinely, that I knew nothing of it, till the barge was
pushing off from the frigate.</p>
<p>The impossibility of getting a boat to convey me to the main
land, made me resolve to pass this day, on the island in the
south-west, the sea-line of which I traced, setting out in a
northwesterly direction, soon arrived in the southwest part of
the island, near the most elevated land, where I found a little
rill of fresh water, is wing from a fissure in a granite rock.
This discovery diffused great joy among us; for we shad been for
some time reduced to very short allowance of that article.</p>
<p>Very near that rill, I saw some cavities full of limpid water,
which I had reason to believe as fresh as that which issued from
the rock; for it was more than 200 toises above the level of the
sea. But I was mistaken; it was very salt, and farther on, other
excavations filled with the same water, were bordered with
crystals of sea salt in <i>lamin&aelig;</i> so thin, that at a
certain distance, they resembled glass. This fact having been
mentioned on board by those who accompanied me, some persons, in
order to account for the ph&oelig;nomenon affirmed, that the
waves must beat up to that height in bad weather, notwithstanding
the coast was guarded by very large rocks; although indeed they
were but at a small distance from the bases of the mountains.</p>
<p>As the rill, which was very weak, furnished slowly the water
necessary to quench our third, we were obliged to remain beside
it, when presently some little drops of the salt water with which
we were wetted, convinced me that the air raised to the place
where we stood, the sea water, attenuated by impinging against
the rocks. It was not long till our clothes were covered with it,
as if we had been exposed to a slight fog; and this water had
lost none of its saltness.</p>
<p>Some birds came to our retreat to quench their thirst. There I
killed the charming yellow turtle dove, remarkable for six or
eight golden feathers towards the bases of its wings, and which
induced White to call it the golden winged pigeon (see page 43,
where he has given a good figure of it): I had before found the
same species at Cape Diemen.</p>
<p>There we also caught many penguins, of the species called
<i>aptenodyta minor</i>, and which Captain Cook likewise met with
at New Zealand. They were in the same manner concealed in very
deep holes in the rocks, from whence it was frequently very
difficult to expel them.</p>
<p>The summit of one of the highest mountains, which I visited
this day, for the first time, was formed of calcareous stone
disposing in strata almost horizontal, similar to those which I
had before met with on those heights. It was of a very fine
grain, with some few small cavities. I did not there observe any
shells. It may be presumed, that that conformation was the effect
of a slow deposition of calcareous matter in a state of
solution.</p>
<p>The change of the soil presented me with some plants, which I
had not yet found.</p>
<p>I gathered a new species of very tall (<i>faillante)
eucalyptus</i>, of which the following is a description:</p>
<p>The most elevated twigs of that shrub, are not above thirteen
feet in height. They are smooth, are furnished, chiefly towards
the extremity, with leaves, alternate, oval, elongated, slightly
bent, and about four inches in length.</p>
<p>The flowers are sessile, and generally eight or ten in number,
at the extremity of a common peduncle, about an inch and
one-fifth in length, having all the characters of the genus
<i>eucalyptus</i>. Their stamina, which are very numerous, have
long filaments of a yellow colour. The style projects a little
over the stamina.</p>
<p>The calix is very much elongated, and is pushed outwards by
the stamina, in proportion as they are developed, and it falls
when they have acquired their full growth.</p>
<p>The capsule is open at top, and furnished with three cells and
sometimes four. It is surmounted by a small portion of the base
of the style, which is divided into as many parts as there are
cells.</p>
<p>Every cell contains a great number of angular seeds.</p>
<p>The form of the calix has induced me to give it the name of
the <i>eucalyptus cornuta</i>.</p>

<p>After having resolved to pass the night on shore, we sought
for a commodious retreat, and found at last an excavation in a
rock, where we were for some time perfectly sheltered from the
wind and the rain which overtook us at the close of the day. The
cold was sufficiently keen to induce us to kindle a fire, and as
we had not much provisions, after I had chosen from among the
birds I had shot, those which I wished to preserve for my
collection, I gave the rest to my companions to be broiled. We
were expecting to make a hearty supper, and to sleep soundly,
when all on a sudden, the wind chopped about and blew directly
into our grotto, which we were immediately obliged to abandon, to
avoid being stifled by the smoke of our fire. This change of
weather made us regret that we had not returned on board; for the
wind was so strong as to extinguish our fire, before our penguins
were sufficiently broiled, but yet we found them very good.</p>
<p>At this repast, the ample supply of water, which we had
brought from the top of the mountain, agreeably reminded us, that
here at least, we could drink without restraint.</p>
<p>16th. At day-break I advanced towards the south-west. Among
many other vegetable productions, I discovered at the base of the
mountains, in a marly soil, a leguminous plant, which ought to be
ranked among those the corolla of which is papilionaceous, and
the filaments of their stamina separate from each other.</p>
<p>It forms a new genus, which I call <i>chorizema</i>.</p>
<p>The calix is in one piece, and divided into four parts on its
borders. The upper division is large, hollowed, and longer than
the rest. The three lower ones are equal among themselves, strait
and terminated by a point.</p>
<p>The superior border of the vexillum is hollowed, and almost
entirely covers the al&aelig; of the carina.</p>
<p>The stamina, which are six in number, are all separated from
one another.</p>
<p>The ovarium is oval, elongated, and terminated by a recurvated
style.</p>
<p>The pod is oval, and filled with a great number of black and
almost spherical seeds.</p>
<p>This plants perennial, and its leaves are simple, alternate,
sessile, coriaceous, long, dentated, and have two little spines
for stipul&aelig;.</p>
<p>The form of the leaves has induced me to delineate this
species, under the name of <i>chorizema elicifolia</i>.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning the Esperance had sent a boat to the
main land, with a view to some astronomical observations. Citizen
Riche had also landed there. The rendezvous was fixed for two
o'clock in the afternoon, at the landing place; but the boat's
crew waited in vain till seven in the evening, when they were
obliged to return to the ship, from their want of provisions, and
the dangerous situation of the boat, if the surge had risen ever
so little. They left upon the beach a written note, acquainting
Citizen Riche, in case he should return thither, that they would
return and take him off very early the next morning, if the
weather would permit.</p>
<p>The geographical engineer, who had been sent to survey the
little islands, returned in the evening, having determined the
position of more than twenty of them, scattered in the space of a
degree in longitude, and as much in latitude. He landed in
several places, without finding a commodious watering place, and
the only rill of fresh water which he discovered could scarcely
furnish a sufficiency for the daily consumption of the ships. But
he had found an anchoring place, behind the point of the main
land, which bore from us, E.N.E. but it was not so deep as that
which we occupied.</p>
<p>The discoveries of Nuyts terminated at this archipelago. We
were astonished at the precision with which the latitudes had
been determined by that navigator, at a time when nautical and
astronomical instruments were so impeded. I ought to extend the
same observation, to almost all those ascertained by Lewen on
this coast.</p>
<p>For some days the winds had blown from the east, inclining to
the north in the morning, and to the south in the afternoon. The
sands, strongly heated by the solar rays, caused this diurnal
variation. The equilibrium of the atmosphere was not affected by
those winds, and hence the mercury in the barometer commonly
stood at 28 inches, 3 or 4 lines.</p>
<p>17th. This day the weather being favourable, a boat was sent
in quest of Citizen Riche. That naturalist, enraptured with the
riches and novelty of all the productions of that region, which
no observer had hitherto visited, had doubtless been so absorbed
in admiration of them, that he had quickly lost his way; and he
had not yet returned to the appointed rendezvous.</p>
<p>When advancing in the direction which he was seen to take on
the preceding day, our people saw, at a small distance, some
savages, with whom, however, any communication was impossible;
for they always fled when our people offered to approach
them.</p>
<p>The situation of Riche was so much the more alarming, as he
had been absent nearly a day and a half, and as we knew that he
had landed upon that sterile soil without provisions.</p>
<p>The boat, which returned about two o'clock in the afternoon,
brought the dismal intelligence that he was not to be found.
Captain Huon immediately waited on the Commodore, in order to
concert with him the measures, which it would be advisable to
take, on this disagreeable occasion. The Commodore, having sent
for the naturalist Deschamps and me, Captain Huon told us the
methods he had taken to recover our unfortunate colleague;
stating to us the dangers to which he must necessarily be
exposed, in advancing alone into the interior country, where,
perhaps, he had fallen by the attacks of the savages; in short,
he said, he could not but apprehend the most fatal event,
believing it to be impossible that he could willingly have
absented himself so long.</p>
<p>The nature of those burning sands, which are totally destitute
of water, rendered all the conjectures, which we could form
concerning him, still more melancholy.</p>
<p>As our stock of water was partly consumed, and we had found no
means of renewing it, at that anchoring-place, Captain Huon,
after representing to us the disadvantages of prolonging our
stay, added, that it was evident any farther search could only
injure the expedition, without expressing the lead hope of
finding our unhappy associate.</p>
<p>Deschamps, upon whom those arguments had the desired effect,
espoused the opinion of the Captain, and seconded his proposition
for sailing, by declaring that it could not be dissembled, that
we could now do nothing more than lament the loss of our
friend.</p>
<p>Those probabilities had not the same weight with me. But it
was necessary for me to persuade the sailors; and I employed what
I thought the most proper argument for that purpose, by citing,
in support of my opinion, an instance taken from the voyages of
the most celebrated of navigators. I reminded them that, in
December 1777, two sailors strayed from Captain Cook, into the
island of Noel, one of whom was absent a whole day, and the other
eight and forty hours; that Cook had ordered several detachments
to search for them with the greatest care; that Noel, however,
was but a little low island, scarcely covered with shrubs,
whereas New Holland, where Riche had lost himself, was an immense
region. I requested, therefore, that the same time should be
allowed to search for our unhappy friend, as Captain Cook had
employed in seeking one of his sailors.</p>
<p>This reasoning produced all the effect which I could
desire.</p>
<p>A boat was immediately dispatched, from each ship, for the
main land; and I had the pleasure to be of the party, whose
business it was to use every method, and to make every effort, to
recover our unfortunate mess-mate.</p>
<p>The Commodore ordered guns to be fired every half hour, to
enable Riche, if still alive, to direct his steps with the more
certainty towards the anchoring place.</p>
<p>The wind favoured us, and, in a short time, we made good our
landing.</p>
<p>After having advanced into the country, in different
directions, we returned to the landing place, on the approach of
night.</p>
<p>We traversed a track wholly covered with sand, where we found
extensive spaces absolutely destitute of vegetables. But I saw
with surprize, on those distant shores, the grass known by the
name of <i>spinifex squarrosus</i>; and thus had a new and an
admirable instance of the facility with which plants, which grow
on the sea shore, diffuse themselves to prodigious distances.</p>
<p>In those arid wastes, grows a fine plant which nearly
resembles the iris, and which naturally classes itself with the
genera <i>dilatris</i> and <i>argolasia</i>. It forms, however, a
new and a very distinct genus, principally by its irregular
corolla.</p>
<p>I have delineated it under the name of
<i>anigozanthos</i>.</p>
<p>Its flowers have no calix.</p>
<p>The corolla has the form of a tube, the edges of which are
divided into six unequal parts recurvated inwards. It is covered
with reddish pili.</p>
<p>The stamina, which are six in number, are inserted under the
divisions of the corolla, which is placed upon the ovarium.</p>
<p>The style is simple, as well as the stigma.</p>
<p>The capsule is nearly spherical; and of the same colour with
the flower by which it is surmounted. It has three cells filled
with a great number of angular seeds.</p>
<p>The top of the stalk is covered with reddish pili, like the
flowers.</p>
<p>I have denominated this species <i>anigozanthos rufa</i>.</p>

<p>Although in the day, the heat was very powerful upon the land,
we experienced a very keen cold in the night.</p>
<p>As soon as day began to dawn, we divided ourselves into two
parties. That which I accompanied advanced towards the north, and
the other towards the north-west.</p>
<p>Directing our steps by the compass, we had proceeded at least
5,100 toises across plains of calcareous sand, heaped up in
different places, when we arrived in a very narrow bottom, where
the verdure of the plants formed a very pleasing contrast with
the dismal places we had traversed, and they, grew in a very rich
soil. There we saw some cavities which afforded us a little fresh
water, but they were too distant to be of any use to the
ships.</p>
<p>Continuing our route, I observed in the midst of those sands,
some rocks of a calcareous nature, where I collected some fine
plants, which still resisted the aridity of the soil. Among the
great number of the tribe of the protea, which I observed there,
I shall mention two species of <i>banksia</i>, which I call
<i>banksia repens</i>, and <i>banksia nivea</i>.</p>
<p>The first has a creeping stalk, thickly covered with reddish
down, terminated by flowers joined together in a conical
form.</p>
<p>The leaves are pinnatisid, and when very young, are coated
with the same down as the stalk; so that one would take that
plant for some species of <i>acroflichum</i>; but when more
advanced in age, they are very smooth.</p>

<p>I also found there the <i>eucalyptus cornuta</i>, and many
other plants of the myrtle tribe.</p>
<p>At the end of four hours very quick walking, we arrived on the
banks of a great lake which has a communication with the sea.</p>
<p>The natives had recently made fires in many places which we
passed.</p>
<p>We saw no kangarous; but their excrements, which we saw every
where in great abundance, convinced us that that quadruped has
multiplied greatly on that coast. We also observed excrements
which very much resembled those of the cow; but we did not see
the animal to which they belonged. We saw in the sand the prints
of a cloven hoof, more than three inches in breadth. There is no
doubt that that region is inhabited by animals much larger than
the kangarous. It affords but little food for birds; and
accordingly I found none in this excursion except two species, a
<i>musicapa</i>, which I afterwards met with in the Moluccas, and
the fine species of red crested cockatoes, <i>psittacus
moluccensis</i>, which are met with in the same islands, in
flocks of many hundreds. When I attempted to approach them, they
always removed to a great distance, flying rapidly with sudden
starts, and emitting loud and very disagreeable shrieks.</p>
<p>The banks of the lake, which we followed for some time in
approaching the sea, are somewhat marshy. The lake extends a
great way into the land; for the other party, who proceeded
towards the north-west, also arrived on its banks. Some of them
came to our rendezvous to acquaint us, that they had observed on
the very edge of the lake, towards the part farthest from the
sea, the prints of shoes, which left no doubt that Riche had
passed that way; but that the marks of naked feet which appeared
near his, gave grounds for apprehending that he had been dragged
by the savages into the interior country. What tended to give
still more probability to this conjecture was, that they soon
found his handkerchief upon the sand, and a little farther on,
one of his pistols. At a small distance, they saw a little smoke
from a deserted fire, around which they found some bits of paper,
on which they recognized the handwriting of Riche; and besides,
the sand still bore the marks of one who had been resting himself
on the spot.</p>
<p>We returned towards the landing place, lamenting the fate of
our unfortunate mess-mate, and had very nearly reached the shore,
in a hopeless state of mind, when we saw one of those who had
been left to take care of the boat, running to meet us with the
pleasing intelligence, that Riche was still alive, and that he
had just arrived at the landing-place, extenuated with hunger and
fatigue. He had been above fifty-four hours on shore, with no
other provision than some bits of biscuit. The famished state to
which he was reduced, rendered it imprudent for his friends to
allow him to indulge his appetite, and in giving him food we
tried gradually to bring into action the digestive powers of his
stomach. His appearance, at first entirely discomposed, became by
degrees re-animated. When he had recovered from the slate of
stupor into which he had been thrown by so long a privation of
nourishment, he told us that, near the fire which we had found
still burning, there was a little rill of fresh water, at which
he had quenched his thirst; and that, by dint of searching among
the plants, analogous to those which yield esculent fruits, he
had discovered a shrub of the tribe of plaqueminiers which
furnished him, with some small fruits; but in a quantity
insufficient for the supply of his necessities. On the first day
of his absence, he found the spring, near which his things had
been picked up. There he passed the night, and the next day he
spent wholly in seeking the anchoring-place; without being able
to find it. In all this painful peregrination, he had not met
with a drop of water; but chance happily conducted him in the
evening to the same spring, where he passed the second night.
Having seen savages at a distance, he had attempted to obtain
some intercourse with them, in order to know their manner of
subsistence, and to ask them for some food; for he was violently
tormented with hunger; but they always fled, when he was
advancing towards them. They frequently set fire to the dried
grass which was diffused over the sand. In that climate, men not
being under the necessity of wearing cloaths, they were all
absolutely naked.</p>
<p>Some cazoards and kangarous of the large species, were the
only animals seen by Riche. Although in a state of weakness, he
had carried for two days a numerous collection of very
interesting productions; but, during the third day, his strength
sunk so rapidly, that it was with great difficulty he could trail
himself along the shore, in quest of the ships, and in those
circumstances, he was obliged to abandon his whole collection,
not being able to reserve even the most precious articles.</p>
<p>As soon as he had a little recovered his strength, we conveyed
him towards the ships. It was to little purpose that we made the
signals agreed upon to announce our success. Every one was so
convinced before hand of the inutility of our researches, that
they did not understand the meaning of them, till we had come
close to the ships, and Riche was seen in the midst of us. The
horrible situation in which he would have been if the opinion
entertained by some persons concerning him had prevailed, ought
to be an alarming and dreadful lesson to captains and naturalists
who undertake long voyages; for, if we had quitted that anchoring
place the day before, his existence would have been terminated by
a most frightful death, in all the anguish of the most terrible
despair.</p>
<p>Though it was demonstrated by this fact, that it was possible
for a man to lose himself for more than two days in that country,
the greater part of our sailors chose to be of a different
opinion; some of them being more willing to believe and to say,
that Riche had designedly absented himself; as if it could be
believed, that he would wantonly expose himself to all the
horrors of famine.</p>
<p>During our slay at that anchoring place, we could not fish
with the seine. But on board the ships, some fishes were caught
with the hook, among which were the <i>labrus cyprinoides</i>,
and several new species of the genus <i>perca</i>.</p>
<p>We lay at anchor, in latitude 33&deg; 55' south, and longitude
119&deg; 82' [sic] east.</p>
<p>The variation of the compass was found to be 6&deg; west.</p>
<p>19th. All the boats having been got on board over night, we
waited for the morning to weigh anchor, if the wind should serve.
It shifted from the N.E. to the E.S.E. and at six o'clock a.m. we
were under sail.</p>
<p>Passing to the northward of the little island which had
sheltered us, we advanced into the open sea.</p>
<p>At noon, being in latitude 34&deg; 12' 54" south, and in
longitude 119&deg; 21' east, the most southerly of the rocks bore
E. 2&deg; S. distant about 3,400 toises, and the most northerly
land bore N. 1&deg; E.</p>
<p>For same days, east winds prevailed, which made us apprehend
great difficulties, in exploring that coast; and analogy gave
much probability to that supposition; for at the Cape of Good
Hope, which even extends some degrees farther to the southward
than that part of New Holland, east winds also predominate at the
same season of the year.</p>
<p>24th. About noon this day, we had only reached 34&deg; 24'
south latitude, and 120&deg; 22' east longitude; and the little
islands at which we had anchored were still in sight.</p>
<p>The east wind blew very fresh in the afternoon, but in the
evening, we had a hot suffocating breeze from the land.
Immediately we were enveloped in a very thick fog, the air being
loaded with a humidity which pervaded every thing. I can compare
it to nothing so properly, as to those fogs which southerly winds
diffuse, over the Mediterranean, near the African coast, in a
very hot season. The sands, heated by the solar rays, had
communicated to the atmosphere an additional power of retaining
water, and we found ourselves immersed, as it were, in a vapour
bath of a moderate temperature.</p>
<p>About eleven at night, we lost sight of the Esperance, which
did not answer the signals we made, till three hours afterwards,
when we heard a very distant report of a gun.</p>
<p>25th. The breeze was weak; we plied close to windward; and
when day-light appeared, we saw the Esperance at a small
distance. The wind soon began to blow forcibly from the
south-west; and for some time, we went at a great rate towards
the east.</p>
<p>At noon, we were in 34&deg; 14' south latitude, and 121&deg;
east longitude; and two hours afterwards, we perceived behind
some little islands, a large bight, which appeared to offer us
excellent shelter.</p>
<p>The natives announced their presence by the smoke of fires, a
great way from the shore, and from each other.</p>
<p>The barometer having descended still lower than when it
foretold the tempest, which forced us to anchor in Legrand road,
we stood off shore, to avoid being embayed on that dangerous
coast. We afterwards lay to, for the whole night, keeping the
ship's head towards the south and S.S.E.</p>
<p>There was a very heavy sea; the wind blew impetuously from the
S.W. and the W.S.W. and increasing gradually, it raged with the
greatest violence for almost the whole night, raising the waves
to a prodigious height. We had never yet been so violently tossed
by a tempest.</p>
<p>The south-west winds there are almost always impetuous, and
add very much to the dangers to which ships are exposed, in
coasting from west to east, along that low shore, frequently
lined with shoals; and there is danger of their not being
perceived soon enough to be able to double them.</p>
<p>When day-light appeared, we stood in for the land. A wind from
W.S.W. brought us back fine weather.</p>
<p>Towards noon, we were in latitude 33&deg; 42' south, and
longitude 122&deg; 4' east, when we saw from the mast-head,
beyond several little islands, a part of the coast, extending
from west to northwest, and which still appeared low. Presently
it assumed the appearance of a bank, raised in a very uniform
manner, trending towards the east, and intercepting our view of
the land. At the approach of night, we clawed off shore, and
afterwards lay to.</p>
<p>27th. The next morning, we continued to follow the coast, and
about three o'clock p.m. our distance from it was but 1,000
toises. It uniformly presented the same appearance, for more than
15,400 toises. We perfectly distinguished thin horizontal strata,
of the same form with the calcareous rocks, which I found in
Legrand road.</p>
<p>I am inclined to believe, that this interruption of mountains,
through so great an extent, is the work of the waters, which
appear to have undermined the strata, making them rush into the
sea, where they form a rampart which renders that coast
inaccessible. We observed little slopes, which they had formed in
ruffling down, but which it would have been very difficult to
climb. We had approached it so nearly, that it became necessary
to get into the offing, where we found twenty fathoms of water,
with a bottom of calcareous sand.</p>
<p>28th. Very early in the morning, we saw the land trending
towards the north-east, and with the wind at south-west, it was
easy for us to follow all its windings. It always presented the
same steep rampart, which rose very uniformly to the height of
about forty-five toises, and presented, from its top to the level
of the sea, the parallel strata of which it is composed.</p>
<p>About noon, the coast inclined a little towards the
south-east, and changed its appearance, being then interspersed
with little sandy hills, which, falling with a gentle declivity,
were bounded by a very low beach. The sea then assuming a
greenish appearance, even in the distant offing, indicated a
change of bottom; but a line of fourteen fathoms could not reach
it.</p>
<p>The wind soon began to blow very fresh. Experience had taught
us to dread the south-west winds, on that coast, which had almost
always become impetuous; and therefore we stood S.E.&frac14;E. to
get into the offing.</p>
<p>The want of water began to be severely felt on board of both
the ships, and it was evident that if we could not immediately
find a supply of that article, we must in a short time abandon
that coast. But if we had begun with its most easterly part, and
coasted it from east to west, we would have had the advantage of
getting a full supply of water at Cape Diemen; whereas, the half
of our's was consumed, when we began to explore the coast, at its
most westerly point. This consideration, among many others, is a
strong inducement to coast it from east to west. Betides, the
impetuosity of the west winds exposes ships to the greatest
dangers; while the east winds, which are the most constant, never
blow with violence.</p>
<p>29th. We were but 1,020 toises from the coast, when the sea
indicated a bottom, sometimes of coarse sand, sometimes of rock,
the depth varying, from nine to twelve fathoms.</p>
<p>At noon, our latitude, was 32&deg; 10' south, and our
longitude 124&deg; 52' east, the nearest land bearing N.N.W:
distant 340 toises. It set by compass, from N. 69&deg; W. to E.
20&deg; N. In a little time, it reassumed the form of a rampart,
like that which we had already coasted, but with this difference,
that its upper part rose by a gentle elevation into the interior
country. We observed some shrubs, which did not seem to be in so
suffering a state, as those which we had seen hitherto on the
same coast.</p>
<p>The sea was covered with the species of fucus, called <i>fucus
natans</i>, and by the French <i>raisin de mer</i>.</p>
<p>JANUARY 1st; 1793. Having been opposed by the easterly winds,
we had only reached, about noon this day, 32&deg; 8' south
latitude, and 126&deg; 42' east longitude, when we saw a fog
rise, which every where represented a flat shore; and so striking
was the illusion, that persons who came from between decks,
thought that we had entered into a vast basin. We were, however,
at the distance of 10,200 toises from the coast, which the fog
concealed from our view.</p>
<p>In the evening, the sky lowered on the land side; and flashes
of lightning darted from the thickest clouds. Then the fog, which
encircled the horizon, dissipated, and the wind shifting to the
west, became very fresh.</p>
<p>4th. In the evening, Captain Huon acquainted the Commodore
with the damage which the rudder of the Esperance had sustained.
At the same time, he told us, that on board of his ship, they had
long been reduced to an allowance of three quarters of a bottle
of water per day; that they had been obliged to discontinue the
distribution of antiscorbutic draughts; and that thirty butts of
water then composed the whole stock on board the Esperance.</p>
<p>5th. About six o'clock this morning, our Commander sent
Captain Huon a letter, letting him, know the resolution which he
had come to, respecting the situation of the two ships.</p>
<p>At noon, our latitude was 31&deg; 52' south, and our longitude
129&deg; 10' east, and we had sight of the land from E. to N.
10&deg; W. being 5,100 toises from the nearest part of it.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat was hoisted in, we stood close on our
course on the larboard tack, with the wind at E.S.E. steering for
Cape Diemen, and abandoning an extremely arid coast, along which
we had held our course, above 820,000 toises, in the general
direction of W.&frac14;S.W. to E.&frac14;N.E. Fifteen months
before us, Vancouver, equally opposed by the east winds, had been
forced to abandon his enterprize, after having explored only
about 360,000 toises of the coast.</p>
<p>Before we approached that coast, we did not expect to find
boisterous winds so frequent, of especially at that season, which
might have been supposed the finest, in those latitudes, the sun
having been then above two months in the southern hemisphere. Is
this impetuosity of the winds caused by the prodigious
difference, which exists between the cool temperature of the
atmosphere over the sea, and the ardour of the solar rays
concentrated by the burning sands on the main land?</p>
<p>The currents, experienced on that coast, always conform to the
direction of the winds.</p>
<p>The Esperance was in still greater distress than we. Besides,
that frigate had sustained several injuries, when last at anchor,
and needed an excellent harbour, where the might receive all the
necessary repairs.</p>
<p>At four o'clock no land could be seen, even from the
mast-head; and, at the same time, a line of thirty fathoms
reached a bottom of fine sand, mixed with broken shells and
lythophites. The lead was hove every two hours, and each time it
was found that the depth increased two or three fathoms;
insensibly augmenting with our distance from the coast.</p>
<p>6th. At six this evening, being then 102,000 toises from the
land, a line of seventy-two fathoms indicated a bottom of very
fine sand mixed with gravel; and from that moment, no bottom was
found, though we sounded at different times. This gradual
augmentation of the depth of the sea near that coast, proves that
the land subsides under the water by an almost insensible
declivity, and gives us reason to believe, that it rises in the
interior by an acclivity equally gentle, so that those heights
are too distant to be perceived from the coast.</p>
<p>8th. We were carried on the 7th, 23' to the westward, and this
day 21' in the same direction. At noon, we were in 35&deg; 30'
south latitude. The rapidity of those currents towards the west,
perhaps depends on some channel, which separates the lands of New
Holland and those of Cape Diemen, between Point Hick and
Furneaux's Islands. Captain Cook, in exploring the eastern part
of New Holland, saw no land in that space, the extent of which is
about 102,600 toises, and believed it to be the entrance of a
great gulph. Perhaps on that part of the coast, a channel
commences, which, after forming different sinuosities, opens
westward in the same latitude, in which we experienced such
strong currents.</p>
<p>We had no westerly winds, till we reached the fortieth degree
of south latitude; and they carried us to Cape Diemen, varying
from the southwest to the north-west.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock, we saw at a small distance, a great number
of cetaceous fishes, of a new species, which appeared to me to be
of the genius <i>delphinus</i>. They were easily distinguished by
a large white spot, behind the dorsal fin. The upper part of the
body is of a blackish brown, and the belly white. The largest
were above nine feet in length. They were preceded by a great
number of dolphins (<i>delphinus delphis</i>), and they swam in
shoals like them, making, with great rapidity, nearly the same
movements with those cetaceous fishes.</p>
<p>We lay to during the night, designing in the morning to make
the land, a degree lower in latitude than Cape Diemen. We hoped
to discover there a harbour which would afford great advantages
to future navigators, who might intend to reconnoitre the
south-west: coast of New Holland, by availing themselves of the
south-west wind.</p>
<p>19th. By half past four in the morning, we saw the land,
extending from N.E.&frac14;N. to E.&frac14;S.E. the nearer part
bearing E.N.E., distant 15,400 toises.</p>
<p>For some time we stood on the starboard tack, close upon the
wind, which blew from southwest. Two hours afterwards, when we
were not more than 7,800 toises from the shore, a line of
seventy-five fathoms indicated a bottom of very coarse sand, and
broken shells.</p>
<p>The shore we saw was steep, and at a little distance, was a
chain of mountains, of moderate elevation, which nearly followed
the same direction. The land was almost wholly covered with large
trees.</p>
<p>At noon, we were in 42&deg; 51' S. lat., and 142&deg; 49' E.
long. The land to the north-east, could only be seen through a
thick fog, which obscured the whole horizon.</p>
<p>20th. The variation of the compass had very rapidly increased
since it became easterly; for it was now observed to be 7&deg;
east.</p>
<p>The coast presented no bight, in which we could hope to find
good anchorage. At noon, we had arrived in latitude 43&deg; 22'
S., and longitude 143&deg; 28' E., being but 5,100 toises distant
from the land, which, from N. 7&deg; W. to E. 23&deg; S. always
presented very high mountains to our view.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the evening, we doubled the southern cape,
at the distance of 10,200 toises. It is remarkable, that in the
different windings of the coast, which we followed, we had always
the wind astern. It appeared to me, that the high mountains,
opposing a barrier to the wind, forced them to observe the
direction of the coast.</p>
<p>All the other mountains were surpassed in altitude, by that
which we saw covered with snow, when we anchored in Port
Dentrecasteaux, the preceding year. But as this was a much warmer
season, we observed snow only in great excavations, where it was
screened from the solar rays, for a considerable part of the day.
That mountain is remarkable for a little conical peak, which
forms its summit.</p>
<p>At the approach of night, we passed very near the Mewstone,
and soon after we brought to, before a very fresh breeze at
west.</p>
<p>We sounded several times with a line of eighty-three fathoms,
without reaching the bottom.</p>
<p>As we were embayed upon the coast, by a wind at S.S.W. we were
obliged to tack.</p>
<p>21st. At noon, we were in latitude 43&deg; 44' S. and
longitude 144&deg; 16 W., when the Mewstone bore W. 16&deg; 30'
S., the Eddystone S.S.E. 1&deg; E. and the nearest land about
N.N.W. at the distance of 1,540 toises.</p>
<p>22d. Very early this morning, we were at the entrance of the
Bay of Tempests. The wind blowing from the E.S.E. hindered us
from entering Dentrecasteaux's Strait, where we intended to
anchor in a bay which we had explored the preceding year, and
which was extremely commodious for giving our ships all the
necessary repairs. But we were obliged to enter the Bay of Rocks,
a name, which some rocks almost level with the water, situated
near its middle, had induced us to give that bay, which is the
first on the larboard, on entering the Bay of Tempests, and lies
in the direction of north-east and southwest. The Esperance
anchored there in very good time.</p>
<p>Having proceeded up this bay, about one-third part of its
length, we found but sixteen feet of water; and consequently it
would not have been prudent for us to go farther, without
sounding all the way, which was the easier to be done, as we had
several boats afloat. Cretin, who had taken soundings in this
road the preceding year, told our Commander that he would not
find less water in it than sixteen feet; and this prevented all
farther search. That assertion, however, ought not to have been
entirely adopted; for, besides that Cretin had not sounded the
bay so deliberately as to be able to inform us respecting its
depth within a foot or two, he was in doubt whether or not he had
performed that operation at low water, a circumstance which would
produce a difference of at least six feet, and consequently would
not have left sufficient water for our ship. Notwithstanding
these considerations, we did not hesitate to steer to the
larboard, and to approach still nearer to the low shore. The
consequence was, that we ran a-ground, but fortunately upon a
sandy bottom. This accident happened at half an hour past nine
o'clock. The wind blowing in heavy squalls, from the high
mountains, drove the ship violently towards the shore, and fixed
her deeper and deeper into the sand.</p>
<p>The Esperance immediately sent her long-boat and her pinnace,
which, in conjunction with our own boats, made vain efforts, on
the starboard side of our ship, to tow her off. It then became
necessary to carry out an anchor to the W.N.W. and to fix the
ship by a hawser, to prevent her from being carried nearer the
land. Next, in order to lighten her, the salt-water, with which
most of our casks were filled, was emptied into the hold, and all
the pumps set a-going to pump it out. As soon as we had
discharged this ballast, we set the capstan to work upon a large
anchor, which had been put down close to the first; but, with our
utmost efforts, it was near one p.m. before we could disengage
the ship from the sand-bank, and get her fairly afloat.</p>
