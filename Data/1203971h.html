<h2>BOOK 2.&mdash;AUSTRALIAN DISCOVERY BY LAND</h2>

<h3><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>"New Holland is a very large tract of land. It is not yet
determined whether it is an island or a continent, but I am certain
that it joins neither to Asia, Africa nor America." William Dampier
arrived at that conclusion in 1688, and a century later no more
confident opinion could have been expressed. The myth about the
existence of a Great Southern Continent stretching from the tropics
to the Antarctic Pole had been demolished by Cook, after whose time
it was no longer possible for a reasonable man to believe that
there was any other very large habitable land-mass in the South
Seas than that whose western shores were known to the Dutch as New
Holland and whose eastern coasts had been named New South Wales by
Cook himself. But it was not yet certain whether New Holland and
New South Wales were parts of one undivided territory, or whether
there was a strait between them, or whether there were two or three
large contiguous islands. Thus Pinkerton, in his <i>Modern
Geography</i> (1807), stated under the heading "New Holland": "Some
suppose that this extensive region, when more thoroughly
investigated, will be found to consist of two or three vast islands
intersected by narrow seas, an idea which probably arises from the
discovery that New Zealand consists of two islands, and that other
straits have been found to divide lands in this quarter formerly
supposed to be continuous."</p>

<p>Several contemporary writings show that the belief was general
that a strait would be found dividing New Holland. James Grant, in
his <i>Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery</i> (1803), expressed his
regret that his orders did not permit him to take his ship, the
<i>Lady Nelson,</i> northward from Port Jackson in 1801&mdash;"we
might betimes have ascertained if the Gulf of Carpentaria had any
inlet to Bass Straits; and this I trust will not be thought
chimerical when it was not known whether other Straits did not
exist as well as that dividing New Holland from Van Diemen's Land."
The Institute of France, also, in preparing instructions for the
voyage of exploration commanded by Nicholas Baudin (1800), directed
a search to be made for a strait which it was supposed divided New
Holland "into two great and nearly equal islands."</p>

<p>This problem, however, was solved by Flinders during his
explorations in the <i>Investigator.</i> When he examined Spencer
Gulf in March 1802, he found as he worked northward that the shores
converged and the water became continually shallower. When he
entered the gulf he thought it might be the conjectured strait,
which should lead through to the Gulf of Carpentaria. As it tapered
to an end, he concluded that "our prospects of a channel or strait
cutting off some considerable portion of Terra Australis grew
less." After Flinders' voyage the hypothesis of a bifurcated
Australia was destroyed.</p>

<p>The situation chosen by Captain Arthur Phillip for the first
colony planted by the British in Australia was extraordinarily
suitable for the purpose for which it was intended; but the very
geographical features which made Sydney a natural gaol at the same
time made the country inland from that locality extremely difficult
to explore. For about thirty miles from the coast stretched a
plain. Then rose, steep and rough to a height of about 1000 feet, a
great scarp, "the truncated edge of a sandstone plateau."
Officially the first Governor named the northern section of this
plateau the Carmarthen Hills, and the southern section the
Lansdowne Hills; but the inhabitants found a more expressive name
for the whole range. These blue mountains looked as though they
ought to have a name signifying their colour as seen from the coast
through the bright atmosphere of a Sydney morning; and so the first
history of New South Wales, that by David Collins, spoke of them as
"commonly known in the colony by the name of Blue Mountains, from
the appearance which land so high generally wears."</p>

<p>The first attempts to ascertain the nature of the interior of
Australia were necessarily made from Sydney, because there was no
other settlement till strategic motives, rather than the necessity
of occupying additional territory, occasioned an extension.
Governor Phillip himself was the first Australian inland explorer,
and his first attempt, through heavily timbered country, did not
take him even as far as the foot of the scarp after five days of
toilsome travelling. Collins relates that in April 1788:</p>

<blockquote>"His Excellency, desirous of acquiring a knowledge of
the country about the seat of government, and profiting by the
coolness of the weather, made during the month several excursions;
in one of which, having observed a range of mountains to the
westward, and hoping that a river might be found to take its course
in their neighbourhood, he set off with a small party, intending if
possible to reach them, taking with him six days' provisions; but
he returned without attaining either object of his journey-the
mountains or a river. He penetrated about thirty miles inland,
through a country most amply clothed with timber, but in general
free from underwood. On the fifth day of his excursion he caught,
from a rising ground which he named Belle Vue, the only glance of
the mountains which he obtained during his journey; and as they
then appeared at too great a distance to be reached on one day's
allowance of provisions, which was all they had left, he determined
to return to Sydney Cove."</blockquote>

<p>Phillip took the lead in later expeditions, in one of which
(1789) he discovered the Hawkesbury River; other energetic men
strove to reveal the character of the territory, and their efforts
led to the finding of the Nepean River (which is the upper
Hawkesbury), the Grose, and some outlying ridges of the mountain
mass. But all early attempts to get beyond the wall were defeated
by the peculiarly broken, precipitous and irregular character of a
region where, instead of broad river-valleys winding through the
hills, as in ordinary mountain lands, deep gorges seemed to cut
across every ridge, and every stream tumbled over a succession of
waterfalls. According to a physiographer's technical description,
"in place of steep ranges with broad valleys between, there are
here rather broad undulating plateaux dissected by narrow deep
gorges and bounded by fault-scarps or huge monoclinal folds." The
early records contain many illustrations of the difficulties.
William Paterson, exploring the River Grose, had to clamber up the
rugged flanks of five waterfalls in ten miles. George Bass spent
fifteen days trying to find a pass through the mountains. He and
his companions equipped themselves with scaling-irons for the feet
and hooks for the hands; they had strong ropes by means of which
members of the party could be lowered down ravines; they were
strong and determined men; but they were completely baffled. A
settled conviction grew that, as Collins stated it, "an impassable
barrier seemed fixed to the westward." Courageous efforts were made
by Ensign Barrallier of the New South Wales Corps and by the
botanist George Caley, but both failed, though they were capable
and hardy explorers. Governor King in 1806 voiced the conclusion
that the mountains were impassable, and that further efforts to
master them would be "as chimerical as useless." The Governor
reported:</p>

<blockquote>"As far as respects the extension of agriculture beyond
the first range of mountains, that is an idea that must be given
up, as the rocks to the west of that range wear the most barren and
forbidding aspect which men, animals, birds and vegetation have
ever been strangers to; a better proof of which may not be adduced
than the remark of one of Cayley's party in returning, who
exclaimed, on seeing two solitary crows, that 'they had lost their
way.'"</blockquote>

<p>Success was not attained, indeed, till 1813; and then its
achievement was not the result of a search for the sake of solving
the problem as one of geographical importance, but for the
practical reason that it was desired to ascertain whether there was
good grazing ground for cattle amongst or beyond the mountains.
Gregory Blaxland, the leader of the expedition, was the younger
brother of John Blaxland, and the two had come to Australia in 1806
as settlers who had obtained land grants from the Secretary of
State on condition that they invested a stipulated amount of
capital in the colony. It was expected that, being experienced in
agriculture, they would by their example contribute to the
improvement of agricultural methods in New South Wales. But they
found it profitable to engage in cattle-breeding rather than in the
production of wheat and other crops, and they were continually on
the look-out for fresh pastures for their herds. Three governors,
King, Bligh and Macquarie, found them troublesome people. But it
was the Blaxland keenness for the acquisition of land that led at
last to the solution of the Blue Mountains problem.</p>

<p>In 1812 a severe drought afflicted the little colony. It was
desirable in the public interest to find other lands for
cultivation and stock-raising than the cramped area between the sea
and the hills; and the Blaxlands particularly were interested in
ascertaining the possibilities which might exist beyond the blue
ridges. It happened that in 1810 Gregory Blaxland accompanied
Governor Macquarie on a boat journey up the Hawkesbury River as far
as it was navigable. According to the story afterwards written by
Blaxland, the idea came to his mind on this expedition that the way
to cross the mountains was not to follow a valley, but to climb to
the top of a ridge and track it westward. He was confirmed in this
theory on a later expedition, when he took with him three European
servants and two natives. He found himself blocked by the sheer
walls of rock, as previous explorers had been; but, he said:</p>

<blockquote>"This journey confirmed me in the opinion, that it was
practicable to find a passage over the mountains, and I resolved at
some future period to attempt it by endeavouring to cross the
river, and reach the high land on its northern bank, by the ridge
which appeared to run westward, between the Warragomby and the
River Grose. I concluded, that if no more difficulties were found
in travelling than had been experienced on the other side, we must
be able to advance westward towards the interior of the country,
and have a fair chance of passing the mountains. On inquiry, I
found a person who had been accustomed to hunt the kangaroo on the
mountains, in the direction I wished to go, who undertook to take
the horses to the top of the first ridge. Soon after I mentioned
the circumstance to His Excellency the Governor, who thought it
reasonable, and expressed a wish that I should make the attempt.
Having made every requisite preparation, I applied to the two
gentlemen who accompanied me to join in the expedition, and was
fortunate in obtaining their consent. Before we set out, we laid
down the plan to be pursued, and the course to be attempted,
namely, to ascend the ridge before-mentioned, taking the streams of
water on the left, which appeared to empty themselves into the
Warragomby, as our guide; being careful not to cross any of them,
but to go round their sources, so as to be certain of keeping
between them and the streams that emptied themselves into the River
Grose."</blockquote>

<p>The gentlemen referred to were Lieutenant William Lawson,
formerly of the New South Wales Corps, and the youth William
Charles Wentworth, who was hereafter to be one of the outstanding
figures in Australian public life. Blaxland's <i>Journal</i>
reprinted in this volume, tells its own tale of the traverse of the
Blue Mountains without any need of amplification. But it is
desirable to add that fourteen years after the event a claim was
put forward, not by Lawson himself, but on his behalf, and
apparently with his knowledge&mdash;since he was living in New
South Wales at the time, and did not disavow the use of his name in
this manner-that he was the originator of the theory that the Blue
Mountains would be found crossable by climbing to the top of the
table-land and pursuing the high ridges. It was asserted that
Lawson "secured an agreeable companion in Mr. William Wentworth and
a persevering assistant in Mr. Gregory Blaxland." (This claim
appeared in <i>The Australian,</i> March 13, 1827) But there is no
evidence that Lawson propounded such a theory, or that he claimed
to have done so immediately after the expedition proved successful,
nor did he make any statement over his own name in support of the
assertions. Nor did Wentworth ever contest the authorship of the
expedition. Blaxland's statement of its genesis is deserving of
full credit. As a student in England a few years later Wentworth
competed for the Chancellor's medal at Cambridge, the prescribed
subject being a poem on "Australasia." There was not much poetic
merit in the piece as a whole; but there certainly was truth in the
concluding passage wherein Wentworth described the toilsome journey
in which he had shared, and its successful issue:</p>

<blockquote>And as a meteor shoots athwart the night<br>
The boundless champaign burst upon our sight,<br>
Till, nearer seen, the beauteous landscape grew<br>
Op'ning like Canaan on rapt Israel's view."</blockquote>

<p>Blaxland's discovery was the first important step forward in the
revelation of inland Australia. No attempt had been made up to this
time to penetrate the continent from any other point on the coast.
One great chance had been missed. In 1803 Colonel David Collins was
sent to occupy Port Phillip, which was discovered in February 1802
by Lieutenant John Murray in the <i>Lady Nelson.</i> Grimes, the
surveyor who accompanied Murray, made a careful chart of the
harbour, as also did Flinders, who entered in the
<i>Investigator</i> in the following April. Flinders gave an
encouraging account of the country surrounding Port Phillip, which,
he wrote, "has a pleasing and in many parts a fertile appearance,
and the sides of some of the hills and several of the valleys are
fit for agricultural purposes; it is in great measure a grassy
country, and capable of supporting much cattle, though better
calculated for sheep." This was an intelligent observation, which
should have incited Collins to explore the country inland when he
had established his company in a suitable place. But Collins never
had his heart in the task committed to him. The disadvantages of
Port Phillip were all that he saw. "Every day's experience
convinces me that it cannot nor ever will be resorted to by
speculative men. . . . When all the disadvantages attending this
bay are publicly known, it cannot be supposed that commercial
people will be very desirous of visiting Port Phillip." Acting on
Collins's extremely fallacious report, Governor King ordered the
abandonment of the first Port Phillip settlement, on the ground
that it appeared "totally unfit from every point of view to remain
at, without subjecting the Crown to the certain expensive prospect
of the soil not being equal to raise anything for the support of
the settlement." Collins's surveyor did, it is true, enter the
lower reaches of the River Yarra, but made no attempt to explore
beyond a few yards from the shore, and, taking his cue from the
commander, reported that the soil was "neither in quality nor
quantity sufficient for cultivation to repay the cares of the
husbandman." But it is evident that had the country inland from
Port Phillip been explored in 1803, the difficulties which were
incidental to exploration over the Blue Mountains from Sydney would
not have been encountered, and the key to the great river system of
Australia would have been found probably more than twenty years
before it was revealed by Sturt.</p>

<p>But through the failure of Collins, the further exploration of
Central Australia was fated to be pursued from the eastern side of
the continent until settlement was commenced again on the south and
on the west. Governor Macquarie was thoroughly sensible of the
importance of Blaxland's work, but determined to have his report
officially confirmed before signifying that the Government would
reward the explorers. He therefore sent Surveyor G. W. Evans in
charge of a party to traverse Blaxland's route and examine the
country beyond the point reached by him. Evans started in November
1813, reached the terminus of Blaxland's journey, and travelled for
three weeks beyond that point. His important discovery was the
River Macquarie; and from the summits of the hills he saw
stretching towards the horizon "a vast extent of flat country"
which "far surpassed in beauty and fertility of soil" any that he
had seen elsewhere in New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land. But the
Governor miscalculated distances when he judged that the Macquarie
was "supposed to empty itself into the ocean on the western side of
New South Wales at a distance of from two to three hundred miles
from the termination of the tour." Evans's journey, however,
enabled a town to be established at Bathurst, the first inland
centre in Australia; and the Governor caused a road to be
constructed from Sydney to this point. In a further expedition
(1815) Evans discovered the Lachlan River, revealing a still
further great stretch of valuable territory.</p>

<p>During the next seven years a group of enterprising men, expert
in bushcraft and excellent judges of country, filled up gaps on the
map between Evans's two rivers and the Murrumbidgee, which was
found by Throsby in 1821. Officially the exploratory work was in
charge of the surveyor-general of New South Wales, John Oxley, who
was appointed to that office in 1811. The first task committed to
him was to trace the courses of the two rivers, the Macquarie and
the Lachlan, and "ascertain their final termination." But he found
that both streams, though broad, deep and swift during part of
their course, simply oozed away into impenetrable marshes, which
seemed like inland seas. His journeys of 1817-18, when he was
accompanied by the eminent botanist Allan Cunningham, were heroic
efforts, but resulted in disappointment and delusion. In the
watershed of the Macquarie Oxley found "a country of running
waters, on every hill a spring and in every valley a rivulet." But
the river itself disappeared. On his return journey to Sydney in
1818, Oxley crossed twelve rivers, and guessed that they all
drained into a great central lake. He did not suspect the existence
of the vast river-system of the Murray and the Darling.</p>

<p>The discoveries made between 1813 and 1820 were not only
geographically important; they heralded a new era in the history of
Australia. A new province, of incalculable extent as yet, but
certainly vast and potentially rich, was opened. A new political
situation was created. As long as the settlement at Sydney was
confined to the stretch of territory between the mountain-wall and
the sea, with its comparatively small agricultural outposts on the
Hawkesbury, at Parramatta, and wherever else patches of
agricultural or grazing ground could be found, there was no serious
obstacle to the continuance of the colony for the purposes for
which it was founded. Those purposes might be condemned for moral
reasons, or the current theories of criminology might change and
new methods be preferred. But the area was suitable for its grim
uses, it was sufficient, and there was not much temptation for
anyone to suggest that it might be employed for nobler ends. The
revelation of the immense interior, however, made all the
difference. The Napoleonic wars ended in 1815, and the disruption
of commerce occasioned by those wars plunged Great Britain into
poverty. People were eager for opportunities to emigrate. The time
was ripe for the opening of fresh avenues of trade. These
discoveries came opportunely. It was as if a new world had swum
into the orbit of the old, and its vacancy called for
alleviation.</p>

<p>During the terms of the next four Governors-Brisbane, Darling,
Bourke and Gipps-problems of exploration were concurrent with land
problems. How were these great areas to be permitted to be
occupied? The growth of the Australian wool trade, following the
brilliant experiments of John Macarthur in the breeding of merino
sheep, made the new lands immediately profitable. There were
fortunes in wool. Jason's golden fleece, "the sea-born wonder of
all lands," was an irrecoverable treasure of antiquity; and if
Jason had been living in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century it would have been worth his while to think better of his
project:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>To reach the oak-grove and the Golden Fleece,<br>
Or, failing, die at least far off from Greece," . . .</blockquote>

<p>and try his luck with merinos in the back country of New South
Wales. In vain did the Government endeavour to restrain the owners
of flocks from "trespassing" on Crown land beyond the limits
prescribed for occupation. The Governors made "squatting"
regulations, and they were ignored. The Secretary of State, who,
with his officials, never really grasped the magnitude of the
problem, made Downing Street regulations, and they also were
ignored. Governor Gipps stated the case with picturesque imagery
and serious truth when he wrote, "As well attempt to confine an
Arab within a circle traced on sand as to confine the graziers or
wool-growers of New South Wales within bounds that can possibly be
assigned to them." In despair, seeing all their orders disregarded
and their regulations laughed to scorn, the Government grasped at
the plausibly ingenious theories of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who
wrote his "Letter from Sydney" as the result of an enforced period
of reflection in Newgate prison, and who "hocussed" his generation
into accepting him as an expert in colonisation, of which, in fact,
he was totally destitute of personal experience.</p>

<p>This confusion was the result of the geographical discoveries
which have been described, with their natural corollary of throwing
open for use immense areas of valuable land. Greater discoveries
followed within a few years. Those made by Allan Cunningham
directed the attention of the eager sheep-men northwards, to the
country which was hereafter to become Queensland. Cunningham was a
botanist, trained at Kew Gardens, who was sent out to New South
Wales in 1815 to collect plants for that institution. He was glad
to take advantage of the opportunity offered to him, to accompany
John Oxley on his journey beyond the Blue Mountains in 1817. During
the next four years he applied himself to botanical collecting
along the coast, under P. P. King, and his <i>Journal</i>
(preserved in the South Kensington Natural History Museum) contains
abundant evidence of the diligence and delight with which he
pursued his investigations. New species of plants, fresh varieties,
the beauty of leaf and flower and the majesty of the great trees
gave him the joy of the discoverer.</p>

<p>In 1823 Cunningham led an expedition of his own, the chief
result of which was the discovery of Pandora's Pass through the
eastern end of the Liverpool Range to the northern plains. Still
more important was his expedition of 1827 across these plains, over
the present Queensland border, into the great stretch of fertile
territory which he named the Darling Downs. He recognised at once
that he had found "very considerable grazing country", and the
squatters, following his tracks in the ensuing years, proved him
right. Cunningham's rich services in the cause of exploration and
science were never rewarded by the grant of a yard of land, and
this at a period when lavish land-grants were being made to persons
who benefited from his efforts. Indeed, the authorities were
grotesquely unaware of his rare and shining merits. When, after
spending four years in England arranging his specimens at Kew,
Cunningham returned to New South Wales as Colonial Botanist, he
found, to his disgust, that he, one of the most eminent men of
science of his age, was expected to grow vegetables for the higher
ranks of the Civil service in a patch of ground in the Botanical
Gardens. Unwilling to devote himself to what he called "the
Government Cabbage Garden", he went on a botanical excursion to New
Zealand. "I am now about to enter with all my might on a more
legitimate occupation," he wrote. But he was already in failing
health, and on his return to Sydney he had to acknowledge that "I
have failed in my best endeavours to patch myself up." He died in
1839.</p>

<p>Of all the inland explorers of Australia, Allan Cunningham was
the best equipped by knowledge to discern the economic value of the
fresh lands brought within the purview of those who were competent
to make use of the opportunities thrown open by discovery. He was a
man of science of high distinction, a traveller of unconquerable
courage and resource. In botanical collections throughout the world
the name "Cunningham", after the scientific names of plants,
appears on hundreds of the little painted labels which distinguish
species and varieties. Sir S. D. Hooker truly said of him that
"Cunningham's botanical researches are by far the most continuous
and extensive that have ever been performed in Australia, or
perhaps in any other country."</p>

<p>The researches so far described related to the region north of
the River Murray. The nature of the country south of that stream
was as yet unknown. Governor Brisbane, who desired to ascertain its
possibilities, proposed to land a party of convicts at or near
Wilson's Promontory, provide them with food and equipment, and let
them find their way back to Sydney if they could. If they
succeeded, they were to have their freedom; if they perished by the
way, as they were likely to do, that would be their misfortune. But
a better plan was propounded by Hamilton Hume, who had already done
some useful exploratory work, and was at this time (1824) in
occupation of a property at Lake George. It was that an expedition
should start from his home, and make its way south to Westernport.
The Governor approved, and suggested that Hume should be associated
with William Hilton Hovell, a retired sea-captain, who had had an
adventurous life in many parts of the globe. Hume and Hovell set
out in October 1824, crossed the Murrumbidgee, and were the first
explorers to find the great river which they named the Hume, but
which was at a later date renamed the Murray. They came to this
river on November 16, crossed it, and soon found themselves in the
rugged mountain country of northern Victoria. They crossed three
fine rivers on their journey farther south, the Mitta-Mitta, the
Ovens and the Goulburn; became entangled in the Plenty Ranges;
scrambled to the top of Mount Disappointment in the hope of being
able to get a glimpse of the sea, but found their view blocked by
the big timber; and at length came out upon fairly level,
meadow-like country, through which they toiled wearily to the
shores of Corio Bay, a branch of Port Phillip. Both the leaders
believed themselves to be at Westernport, and did not discover that
they had made a mistake till some years later. In fact, they were
one degree out in their calculations. The error of reckoning was
Hovell's, but Hume was at the time just as much in the belief that
the expedition had reached Westernport as was his colleague.</p>

<p>The mistake had two consequences of importance. First, it
induced the Government to send an expedition to occupy Westernport
in 1826, in the belief that the surrounding country was as
promising as Hume and Hovell had described it to be. This was
withdrawn in 1828, in consequence of the unfavourable reports of
the commanding officer, who was convinced that Westernport did not
"possess sufficient capabilities for colonisation on a large
scale". The second consequence was that the description given by
Hume and Hovell of the territory which they had traversed directed
attention to its pasturage resources, which was the main incentive
to the unauthorised occupation of the Port Phillip country by John
Batman and other squatters after 1835.</p>

<p>Hume and Hovell were the first explorers to traverse the present
state of Victoria; it was traversed again, farther west, by Major
Thomas Mitchell in 1836. Crossing the Murray at the point of its
junction with its tributary the Murrumbidgee, Mitchell marched over
rich grassy plains which were later to provide pasture for great
flocks of sheep. "I felt conscious," he wrote, "of being the
harbinger of mighty changes, for our steps would soon be followed
by the men and the animals for which it seemed to have been
prepared." To his great surprise, when he came upon the sea-coast
at Portland, he found men and animals already there; for the Henty
brothers had established a whaling station at this favourable spot
in 1835. "Australia Felix," the name which Mitchell gave to this
land, did not endure; but it was not inapt.</p>

<p>Mitchell's journey connects naturally with that of Hume and
Hovell on account of the region which it unveiled, but in
chronological sequence it followed a series of explorations which
provided a solution to the great river problem of Australia. A
considerable number of rivers had been found since Evans came upon
the Macquarie and the Lachlan&mdash;the Murrumbidgee, Bogan,
Castlereagh, Namoi, Gwydir, Barwon, Abercrombie, Dumaresq and Logan
amongst them. Had these rivers, or some of them, independent
courses to the sea, or did they flow into some great inland lake?
The solution of those questions was to be the achievement of one
whose name will ever shine brightly in the history of Australian
exploration-the intrepid, chivalrous, gentle, patient Charles
Sturt. He came to Australia in 1827 as a captain in the 39th
regiment with a dislike of the military duty assigned to
him&mdash;"highly prejudiced against W" was his own phrase. In
Sydney he became acquainted with Oxley, Cunningham and Hume, and
conversed with them about the expedition in which they had taken
part. Oxley was a sick man no longer capable of leadership. Sturt
was fascinated by the prospect of taking up the work which these
men had been doing. Routine garrison duty gave no scope for his
eager intelligence; discovery was entirely to his taste; and he was
delighted when the Governor decided to give him an opportunity to
take an expedition into the interior "to determine the supposed
existence of an inland sea."</p>

<p>The chief result of Sturt's expedition of 1828-9 was the
discovery of the Darling, which he named. The season was
unfortunately unfavourable for seeing this great river in full
flood, and Sturt could not realise that it is the stem-stream into
which flow the immense spread of rivers which drain the plains of
central Queensland. Drought had, in the year of this enterprise,
laid its parching hand upon New South Wales. The interior was baked
and blistered with heat. The rivers were dry. All the more
surprising was it, therefore, when, after traversing country so
desolate and so and that Sturt's men on finding a little mud in a
river-bed were glad to squeeze it through pieces of cloth to get a
drop of water to moisten their mouths, they came, on January 18,
1829, to the banks of a river from seventy to eighty yards broad,
and gleaming silvery more than forty feet below its banks.</p>

<p>The travellers climbed down the steep banks to the water, but to
their intense disappointment found it salt. "The cup of joy was
dashed from our hands before we could raise it to our lips," wrote
the leader. Sturt, accompanied by Hamilton Hume, followed the river
down-stream for forty miles from the camp and found that it
continually increased in breadth; but as the water was still salt
he could not risk further exploration. He was compelled to retreat
from the Darling to his depot on the Macquarie, which river also
was reduced to a chain of water-holes by the terrific drought. An
examination of the bed of the Castlereagh, also dry, convinced
Sturt that it was a tributary of the Darling, and he was assured
that the Macquarie flowed into that river in seasons when there was
water enough to enable it to do so. There was no doubt, from the
great depth of the Darling's banks, that "furious torrents must
sometimes rage in it"; but Sturt was unable to form an opinion as
to what became of it when, in a season of plentiful rainfall, it
received immense contributions of water from the rivers which
poured into it. "Its course is involved in mystery," he wrote.
"Does it make its way to the south coast, or exhaust itself in
feeding a succession of swamps in the centre of the island?"</p>

<p>That problem was to be solved by Sturt's expedition of 1829,
when he discovered the Murray. His immediate object on this journey
was to trace the course of the Darling; but in case there should
again be perplexity through finding the water salt, it was
determined to follow the course of the Murrumbidgee, whose waters
were known to be sweet, in the belief that this river was connected
with the Darling watershed. The theory proved to be correct. Sturt
also judged it possible that it would be desirable to travel some
distance by water-an extremely fortunate conjecture; he therefore
took with him the frame and timbers of a strong whaleboat. His
party travelled to the Murrumbidgee through rich and delightful
country, and found the river itself foaming and eddying in a strong
current. He was convinced that it would be found to form a junction
with another river, and that this river would be navigable.</p>

<p>Arriving at this conclusion, Sturt resolved upon a bold course.
He hazarded the entire success of his expedition upon it, and
probably also the lives of himself and his men; but it was not a
reckless expedient. It is easy enough to-day, with the map open
before us, to see that Sturt did the perfectly right thing when he
resolved to fit together the parts of his boat, take to the water
with a selected band of men, and send back his bullock drays and
stores. But Sturt had no map of the country. He only knew of the
existence of sundry streams, of the source and ultimate course of
not one of which was anything at this time ascertained. It was a
remarkable feat of imagination on Sturt's part to conclude that
these streams reached one great channel by which they flowed to the
sea. But that was the idea which now possessed his mind, and he was
certain that he had reached the point on the Murrumbidgee where he
must put it to the test. "The Murrumbidgee kept up its character,"
he wrote in a letter, "and is a magnificent stream. I do not know
its fate, but I am obliged to abandon my cattle and have taken to
the boats. Where I shall wander to God only knows. I have little
doubt, however, that I shall ultimately make the coast. Where do
the Hume and the Goulburn and the other streams flow to?" What was
in his mind is apparent from that question; and the idea in its
absolute rightness came to him in a brilliant flash of
inspiration.</p>

<p>Sturt's men proceeded to construct the whaleboat, and also built
a smaller boat to carry part of the provisions. He chose six men to
accompany him, and on the morning of January 7, 1830, the voyage
down-stream commenced. On the following day the smaller boat struck
a sunken tree and was wrecked, but most of the useful stores were
recovered. On January 14th the Murrumbidgee was found suddenly to
take a southerly direction, and the boat shot forward with great
velocity. A little later it was "hurried into a great and noble
river." Sturt had entered the Murray, as he afterwards named it;
though it was the same river as Hume and Hovell had crossed in
1824, which they named the Hume. Eight days later another large
river was found, coming from the north. He was convinced that this
was the Darling, which he had discovered 300 miles away. "An
irresistible conviction impressed me that we were now sailing on
that very stream," he wrote. This remarkable expedition finished
its work when it reached "the termination of the Murray", where
seagulls overhead heralded the first craft that had ever floated on
the waters of the great river of Australia.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Murray, like the preceding revelations of
the character of inland Australia, had important political
consequences. The Wakefieldians in England wished for an
opportunity of demonstrating the efficacy of their theory.
Previously, the published accounts of that part of the Australian
coast which was shortly to pertain to the new province of South
Australia had given no reason to hope that fertile lands lay behind
the rocky and sandy edge. But Sturt's story suggested great
possibilities. "My eye never fell upon a country of more promising
aspect or of more favourable position," was his verdict. In 18311
the first project was launched for founding a new colony in the
region which Sturt had brought under public notice. Wakefield and
his enthusiastic supporters took up the idea; and South Australia
came into being in 1836.</p>

<p>The foundation of South Australia led to a series of important
expeditions being projected from Adelaide, its capital, westward
across the and country above the Great Australian Bight, and
northward into the region of the great lakes, into the centre of
the continent, and ultimately through to the extreme north opening
upon the tropical Timor Sea. Edward John Eyre&mdash;who was later
to become famous as Governor of Jamaica&mdash;in 1841, accompanied
by only one white man, Baxter, and three aboriginals, faced immense
difficulties in a waterless waste on an expedition of more than
three months between South and Western Australia. Baxter was
murdered by two of the blacks, but Eyre struggled on through the
hot sand with the third, who remained faithful, till he was rescued
by a French whaler in Thistle Cove near Esperance. He had hoped to
trace out a track for a road between the southern colony and that
by this time established on the Swan River in the west; but that
road was never made, though the transcontinental railway,
constructed in the twentieth century, runs, through a large part of
its course, not very far from Eyre's route.</p>

<p>Charles Sturt, who had resigned his commission in the army and
accepted the post of Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands in South
Australia, deduced from the flight of birds an ingenious theory as
to the existence of good pasture land in the middle of the
continent. His argument was this:</p>

<blockquote>"Birds observed east of the Darling in the summer of
1828 in about lat. 29&deg; 30' S. and long. 144&deg; had invariably
migrated to the west-north-west. Cockatoos and parrots, known while
in the colony to frequent the richest and best-watered valleys of
the higher lands, would pass in countless flights to that point of
the compass. In South Australia, in lat. 35&deg; and long. 138&deg;, I had
also observed that several birds of the same kind annually visited
that province from the north. I had seen the <i>Psittacus Novae
Hollandiae</i> and the shell paroquet following the shore-line of
St. Vincent's Gulf like flights of starlings )in England. The
different flights, at intervals of more than a quarter of an hour,
all came from the north and followed in one and the same direction.
Now, although the casual appearance of a few strange birds should
not influence the judgment, yet from the regular migration of the
feathered race a reasonable inference may be drawn. Seeing that
these two lines if prolonged would meet a little to the northward
of the tropic, I formed the following conclusions. First, that the
birds migrating on those lines would rest for a time at the point
where those lines meet. Secondly, that the country to which they
went would resemble that which they had left-that birds which
frequented rich valleys or high hills would not settle down in
deserts and flat country. Thirdly, that the intervening country,
whether owing to deserts or to large sheets of water, was not such
as these birds could inhabit. Indeed, such large migrations from
different parts to one particular point argued no less strongly the
existence of deserts or of sea to a certain distance, than the
probable richness of the country to which as to a common goal these
migrations tended."</blockquote>

<p>Sturt endeavoured to test this theory on his expedition into the
interior in 1844. At the head of a competent party, he followed the
course of the Darling to Menindie, 180 miles north of the junction
of that river with the Murray, and then struck north-west for the
Barrier Range, which was not at that time suspected to contain vast
wealth in silver ore. From these hills the party moved north into
desert country. The sufferings of men and animals were intense. In
January 1845 they were toiling across plains in the blistering
summer heat. On January 27 they pitched their tents at a sheltered
spot called Rocky Glen, where there was a lagoon and some pasture;
but from that depot they were not able to move for six months
because they had no hope of finding water anywhere else between
their camp and the Darling, more than miles south. "We were locked
up in this desolate and heated region," wrote Sturt, "as
effectually as if we were ice-bound at the Pole." He saw clearly
enough, too, that this enervating detention would paralyse his
expedition. Not till the following July, when rain fell, was the
party able to move away from Rocky Glen; and then it was forced
back by the waterless waste. Ultimately, Sturt, in broken health,
had to choose between facing another summer at Rocky Glen and
making a rapid dash to the Darling. He chose the latter
alternative, himself carried on a bullock-dray because he was too
weak to ride; and by easy stages the shattered expedition made its
way back to Adelaide, where the gaunt and sun-scorched travellers
with their skeleton cattle arrived on January 19, 1846.</p>

<p>This was Sturt's last essay in exploration. He had hoped to
reach the centre of the continent, but was baulked by the torrid
summer and the waterless waste. But for broken health, however, he
would have tried again. "I can only say," he wrote, "that I would
not hesitate again to plunge into those dreary regions, that I
might be the first to place my foot in the centre of this vast
territory, and finally to raise the veil which still shrouds its
features, even though, like those of the veiled prophet, they
should wither the beholder."</p>

<p>Central Australia nearly turned Sturt's attempt to reveal its
secrets into a great tragedy; for two famous expeditions it
achieved that end. The first was that of a Prussian man of science,
Ludwig Leichhardt. He had come to Australia with letters of
introduction to a German mission to aboriginals in Queensland, and
his first exploratory work was of a purely scientific character. He
hoped to secure an appointment as naturalist on an expedition to be
led by Mitchell through the continent to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
As Mitchell's plans did not mature, Leichhardt in 1844 raised funds
for an expedition of his own, which he conducted to Port Essington
in the extreme north. It was the longest journey accomplished
through the tropical regions of Australia up to this date. It
occupied fifteen months, and the travellers arrived at the coast
famished and with scarcely a rag to their backs.</p>

<p>The courage displayed by Leichhardt prompted the people of
Sydney to subscribe to fit out a second expedition, and the
Legislative Council of New South Wales supplemented the
subscription by voting &pound;1000. On this occasion (1846-7)
Leichhardt hoped to traverse Australia from cast to west, but was
driven back to the coast after fighting against drought and heat
for five months. Nothing daunted, however, he started again in
1848, planning to march from Moreton Bay to the Swan River. From
this journey he never returned, and no authentic trace of him and
his party has ever been found. His fate is one of the mysteries of
Australian history which there is no hope of clearing up. A. C.
Gregory, who led a party in search of Leichhardt, found on the
Barcoo River a tree marked with the letter L, and the remains of
several camps which may have been Leichhardt's were examined, but
none of the traces were satisfactorily connected with his fate. The
several expeditions which went in search of him, however, did find
good pastoral country; and probably the scouring of the interior in
the endeavour to solve the mystery did more to reveal the real
nature of central Australia, to distinguish its economically useful
tracts from its patches of desert, and to prove that seasonal
variations made all the difference to its value, than his own
expedition would have done if he had succeeded in his stated
object.</p>

<p>The second tragedy of the interior was that of Burke and Wills
in 1861. It was the best equipped expedition that ever set forth to
explore any part of Australia. In Melbourne, where it originated,
there was keen desire to ascertain what good pasture-lands there
might be in the centre of the continent. By public subscription and
Government subsidy &pound;12,000 was raised, camels were brought
from India, a scientific staff was engaged, and all the
preparations appeared to be so carefully planned as to ensure
success for a journey which, starting from a depot established at
Menindie on the Darling, was to terminate at the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>

<p>But a mistake was made in entrusting the command to Robert
O'Hara Burke. He was a police officer of undoubted courage, but he
had no knowledge of bushcraft, and his impatient rashness brought
calamity to the enterprise and death to himself and to Wills. G. J.
Landells, chosen as second in command, quarrelled with Burke before
the expedition reached the Darling, and returned to Melbourne with
the artist, Ludwig Beckler, who also found Burke's manner
unendurable. W. J. Wills, who had been taken as surveyor, was then
appointed by Burke to Landells' position.</p>

<p>Bunke, having formed his depot at Menindie, hurried on to
Cooper's Creek. Finding grass and water plentiful, he sent back an
order to move the depot to Cooper's Creek, and waited six weeks for
this order to be executed. But he became impatient, and determined
to make a dash for the Gulf of Carpentaria. He took with him three
men, Wills, King and Gray, with provisions for three months, borne
on six camels. The provisions were nearly exhausted before the sea
was reached, and the camels all succumbed to Burke's impetuous
speed. Burke and Wills went ahead of their two companions, and
reached the estuary of the Flinders River, but did not obtain a
glimpse of the sea, nor dared to spend the two extra days that
would have been necessary to cut their way through the jungle to
the beach.</p>

<p>The return journey was a march to death. Gray died by the way,
but Burke, Wills and King managed to get back to Cooper's Creek,
though terribly emaciated by their privations and exertions. They
had expected to find the depot there; but the man who had been left
in charge of it, having waited six weeks longer than he had been
ordered to wait and finding his provisions diminishing, departed
for Menindie seven hours before Burke and Wills arrived. He left
behind a small stock of provisions, which the three eagerly ate.
The obvious course was to follow to Menindie as soon as they had
rested; but a strain of perversity in Burke brought calamity. He
insisted on making for Adelaide, because, he said, there was a
cattle station at Mount Hopeless 50 miles away. Wills argued
strongly for taking the Menindie route, but could not persuade the
leader, and accompanied him on the fatal journey along Cooper's
Creek in the direction of Adelaide. Both men perished by the way;
King fell in with a native tribe, who succoured him till he was
rescued by a relief party under the command of Alfred Howitt.</p>

<p>To the Burke and Wills expedition, however, pertains the credit
of being the first to traverse the continent from south to north,
though this success was only barely achieved. John McDouall Stuart,
starting from Adelaide, attempted the same feat in 1860. His
memorable attainment on this journey was the reaching of the centre
of the continent (April 22, 1860), where he erected a cairn upon
which he placed a pole with the British flag nailed to it. The red
sandstone hill which he found near the central point he named
Central Mount Sturt, "after my excellent and esteemed commander of
the expedition in 1844 and 1845, Captain Sturt"; but the name was
afterwards changed to Central Mount Stuart by the Governor of South
Australia. Stuart found in the centre of the continent a fine
stretch of well-grassed country, but in his advance farther north
was defeated by lack of provisions, attacks by aboriginals, and
shortage of water.</p>

<p>He made another attempt in 1861, and this time penetrated 100
miles beyond his farthest point in the previous year, but found the
hot plains and the thick scrub "as great a barrier as if there had
been an inland sea or a wall." But his long experience as an
explorer, and his consummate knowledge of bush travelling, were
rewarded by complete success when he made his third attempt in
1862. On July 24 of that year his party emerged from their seven
months' journey upon the north coast of the continent near Port
Darwin. Stuart himself spent every grain of his strength in these
three great journeys, which left him a sick and partially blind
man, but they were of the utmost value in demonstrating the truth
about central Australia&mdash;that in favourable seasons much of
the country is good grazing land.</p>

<p>The inland journeys of Mitchell, Gregory, Landsborough, Stephen
Hart, McKinlay, and Frederick Walker also did much to dispel gloomy
ideas of the barrenness of the interior, which the failures of
Sturt, Leichhardt and Burke and Wills had engendered, McKinlay
demonstrated the possibility of driving sheep across the continent,
and all the explorers just named found excellent pastoral lands,
from which, in fact, fortunes have been made in later years by
enterprising men with knowledge, experience, and sufficient
discernment to distinguish between seasons when man and beast
cannot live in drought-stricken territory and those when the
feeding-grounds are green with nourishing grasses.</p>

<p>Turning next to the south-east corner of the continent, a sharp
contrast is presented in the mountain ranges which extend from the
Monaro table-land across the New South Wales border into the
Victorian Alps and the steep slopes of Gippsland. The pioneer in
Gippsland exploration was Angus Macmillan, a Scottish Highlander
who came to Australia in 1838, and found employment with a
squatter, Lachlan Macalister, who had a sheep-station near
Goulburn. These were the squatting days, and Macalister, on the
look-out for desirable lands to occupy with his flocks, sent
Macmillan to examine the country south of Monaro, then entirely
unknown. In a narrative written by himself, Macmillan stated that
he heard from aboriginals "that a fine country existed near the
sea-coast." In May 1839 he started to look for it, accompanied by
one black of the Maneroo tribe, who knew something of the lay of
the land. He did not reach the coast on this journey, but found a
good site for a cattle-station for his employer, and then returned.
He started again early in 1840, when, travelling over "some of the
worst description of country I ever saw", he succeeded in breaking
through the range leading down to the coast, but did not quite get
there. Provisions ran short, "and as some of the party were
unwilling to prosecute the journey on short allowance," he
retreated with the determination to bring cattle down to the
district which he had discovered. This he did in October 1840, when
he cleared a road over the mountains and drove 500 head of cattle
over it to the Avon River; after which he cleared a track to Port
Albert. "When I started to explore the district," Macmillan said,
"I had no guide but my pocket compass and a chart of Captain
Flinders. We had not even a tent, but used to camp out and make
rough gunyas wherever we remained for the night."</p>

<p>Macmillan wanted to call the district which he had thus opened
Caledonia Australis, because it reminded him of his native country;
a Highlander was naturally struck with the similarity between this
region of rough peaks and green valleys through which tumbled cool,
sparkling rivers, and the hills and glens of Scotland. But
Caledonia Australis was Latin, and long; the name Gippsland, after
the Governor of New South Wales at that time, was suggested by a
Polish traveller, Count Strzelecki, and endured.</p>

<p>Strzelecki was a geologist, who came to Australia in 1838 to
make researches in his own field of science; he was, indeed, one of
the first to discover traces of gold in this country. It is owing
to him, likewise, that the highest mountain in Australia bears a
Polish name, that of the celebrated patriot of his country,
Kosciusko. In 1840 the Count set out with a small party to traverse
the rough country which Macmillan had already crossed; but he was
less skilful than his predecessor, though he was rewarded with the
gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, whilst Macmillan
received no official recognition. Strzelecki miscalculated his
whereabouts and the distance to the coast. Planning to march
through Caledonia Australis to Westernport, he and his companions
toiled for twenty-two days over the hills and across the swamps,
cutting their way with terrific exertion, reduced to the verge of
starvation by the exhaustion of their provisions. They arrived at
Westernport in a ragged and famished condition. If they had
followed Macmillan's directions, they would have reached the sea
with comparatively little difficulty.</p>

<p>The exploration of the western part of Australia makes a chapter
of history in itself, because, though that country is connected
continuously by land with eastern and southern Australia, the
country forming the connection is less like a link than a cleavage.
An enormous stretch of territory, much of which is desert and all
difficult to traverse, even in favourable seasons, lies between.
After the commencement of colonisation in 1829 many journeys into
the interior were made from the capital, Perth, with the practical
object of finding good land for settlement. The first expedition
that attracted much general attention to Western Australia was that
of George Grey and Lushington in 1837-8 and again in 1839. The
discovery of the Glenelg, Irwin and Gascoyne rivers rewarded Grey's
efforts, and brought him under the notice of the authorities in
England, with the consequence that he was appointed Governor of
South Australia and afterwards of New Zealand and South Africa.</p>

<p>Apart from Grey, the most famous of the explorers of Western
Australia were the brothers John and Alexander Forrest and Ernest
Giles. The colony on the Swan River had existed for forty years,
however, before John Forrest, who was in 1869 a junior officer in
the Survey Department, undertook to lead an expedition into the
interior, primarily to investigate a story which some natives had
told that white men had been murdered on the shores of a great lake
to the east of the Hampton Plains. It was thought that traces of
Leichhardt might be found by examining the locality. Forrest soon
satisfied himself that there was no foundation for the report; but
he travelled for 200 miles through territory which he found
entirely worthless for pastoral or settlement purposes, but which
nevertheless he believed to be richly mineralised. In 1870 Forrest
set out again with his brother to travel overland from Perth to
Adelaide. He knew that the difficulties would be great, for the
route lay over the ground which had brought Eyre to a desperate
plight, and nearly to disaster, in 1837. But, being prudent as well
as courageous and very strong, Forrest arranged for a schooner with
provisions to meet him at Esperance Bay for a first renewal of
necessities, and at Eucla for a second supply. These plans
succeeded; so that, though Forrest and his party certainly suffered
severely from thirst, especially between Esperance and Eucla, they
travelled through the waterless territory with the knowledge that
there was relief for them at the appointed place. Adelaide was
reached after a journey of five months. The object was not merely
geographical discovery. It was desired to ascertain whether there
was any good pastoral country inland from the Bight. On this point
Forrest's reports were reassuring. He satisfied himself that water
could be found in some places by digging, that there were excellent
patches of grass land, and that in seasons of liberal rainfall the
district was worth using for stock purposes.</p>

<p>A third important journey of Forrest, who again had his brother
Alexander with him, was for the purpose of examining the tropical
areas of Western Australia which was drained by the Murchison,
Gascoyne, Fitzroy and other rivers, flowing into the sea on the
north and north-west. Splendid grazing-land was found between the
rivers, with abundance of water. But Forrest's determination to
return after an examination of the desert country east of these
river valleys brought him into difficulties and privations which
tried the courage and endurance of his party.</p>

<p>Ernest Giles made three expeditions into the arid lands west of
Stuart's transcontinental track&mdash;in 1872, 1873 and 1875, on
the third of which lie travelled overland to Perth and back. By
this time there was no longer much occasion to send out exploring
expeditions, because the general character of the continent was
well known, and there was no lack of enterprising mining
prospectors and pastoralists who were continually on the move to
find profitable ground.</p>

<p>This books brings together a collection of the original
narratives of the men who unveiled the face of Australia. The
stories which they wrote are scattered over many volumes, and few
people, even among those who are keenly interested in the tale of
the discovery of this continent, have the opportunity of gaining
access to first-hand records of these memorable achievements. Many
of the volumes are rare; few are easy to obtain. Here, however, the
reader will find Blaxland's own narrative of the first crossing of
the Blue Mountains, and the most important passages describing the
discoveries of other men who cut their way through trackless
regions and prepared the way for the pastoralist, the miner and the
farmer. By these men, in the manner represented herein by
themselves, was the continent of Australia made known.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>I. BLAXLAND'S STORY OF THE
CROSSING OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS</h3>

<blockquote>[GREGORY BLAXLAND printed his account of the journey of
1813*, in which he succeeded in crossing the Blue Mountains in
company with Lawson and Wentworth, during a visit to England in
1823. He dedicated the little book to an uncle for whom he had
"feelings of gratitude for your kind attention to me during the
early part of my life." The book has been twice reprinted-in a
limited facsimile edition in 1923, and more recently with
explanatory notes by F. Walker.*]</blockquote>

</p>

<p>On Tuesday, May 11, 1813, Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William Went
worth, and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by four servants, with five
dogs, and four horses laden with provisions, ammunition, and other
necessaries, left Mr. Blaxland's farm at the South Creek, for the
purpose of endeavouring to effect a passage over the Blue
Mountains, between the Western River, and the River Grose. They
crossed the Nepean, or Hawkesbury River, at the ford, on to Emu
Island, at four o'clock p.m., and having proceeded, according to
their calculation, two miles in a south-west direction, through
forest land and good pasture, encamped at five o'clock at the foot
of the first ridge. The distance travelled on this and on the
subsequent days was computed by time, the rate being estimated at
about two miles per hour. Thus far they were accompanied by two
other gentlemen.</p>

<p>On the following morning (May 12), as soon as the heavy dew was
off, which was about nine a.m., they proceeded to ascend the ridge
at the foot of which they had camped the preceding evening. Here
they found a large lagoon of good water, full of very coarse
rushes. The high land of Grose Head appeared before them at about
seven miles distance, bearing north by east. They proceeded this
day about three miles and a quarter, in a direction varying from
south-west to west-north-west; but, for a third of the way, due
west. The land was covered with scrubby brush-wood, very thick in
places, with some trees of ordinary timber, which much incommoded
the horses. The greater part of the way they had deep rocky gullies
on each side of their track, and the ridge they followed was very
crooked and intricate. In the evening they encamped at the head of
a deep gully, which they had to descend for water; they found but
just enough for the night, contained in a hole in the rock, near
which they met with a kangaroo, who had just been killed by an
eagle. A small patch of grass supplied the horses for the
night.</p>

<p>They found it impossible to travel through the brush before the
dew was off, and could not, therefore, proceed at an earlier hour
in the morning than nine. After travelling about a mile on the
third day, in a west and north-west direction, they arrived at a
large tract of forest land, rather hilly, the grass and timber
tolerably good, extending, as they imagine, nearly to Grose Head,
in the same direction nearly as the river. They computed it at two
thousand acres. Here they found a track marked by a European, by
cutting the bark of the trees. Several native huts presented
themselves at different places. They had not proceeded above two
miles, when they found themselves stopped by a brushwood much
thicker than they had hitherto met with. This induced them to alter
their course, and to endeavour to find another passage to the
westward; but every ridge which they explored proved to terminate
in a deep rocky precipice; and they had no alternative but to
return to the thick brushwood, which appeared to be the main ridge,
with the determination to cut a way through for the horses next
day. This day some of the horses, while standing, fell several
times under their loads. The dogs killed a large kangaroo. The
party encamped in the forest tract, with plenty of good grass and
water.</p>

<p>On the next morning, leaving two men to take care of the horses
and provisions, they proceeded to cut a path through the thick
brushwood, on what they considered as the main ridge of the
mountain, between the Western River and the River Grose; keeping
the heads of the gullies, which were supposed to empty themselves
into the Western River on their left hand, and into the River Grose
on their right. As they ascended the mountain these gullies became
much deeper and more rocky on each side. They now began to mark
their track by cutting the bark of the trees on two sides. Having
cut their way for about five miles, they returned in the evening to
the spot on which they had encamped the night before. The fifth day
was spent in prosecuting the same tedious operation but, as much
time was necessarily lost in walking twice over the track cleared
the day before, they were unable to cut away more than two miles
further. They found no food for the horses the whole way. An emu
was heard on the other side of the gully, calling continually in
the night.</p>

<p>On Sunday they rested, and arranged their future plan. They had
reason, however, to regret this suspension of their proceedings, as
it gave the men leisure to ruminate on their danger; and it was for
some time doubtful whether, on the next day, they could be
persuaded to venture farther. The dogs this day killed two small
kangaroos. They barked and ran off continually during the whole
night; and at day-light, a most tremendous howling of native dogs
was heard, who appeared to have been watching them during the
night.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 17th, having laden the horses with as much grass
as could be put on them, in addition to their other burdens, they
moved forward along the path which they had cleared and marked,
about six miles and a half. The bearing of the route they had been
obliged to keep along the ridge, varied exceedingly; it ran
sometimes in a north-north-western direction&mdash;sometimes
south-east, or due south, but generally south-west, or
south-south-west. They encamped in the afternoon between two very
deep gulleys, on a narrow bridge, Grose Head bearing north-east by
north; and Mount Banks north-west by west. They had to fetch water
up the side of the precipice, about six hundred feet high, and
could get scarcely enough for the party. The horses had none this
night; they performed their journey well, not having to stand under
their loads.</p>

<p>The following day was spent in cutting a passage through the
brushwood, for a mile and a half further. They returned to their
camp at five o'clock, very much tired and dispirited. The ridge,
which was not more than fifteen or twenty yards over, with deep
precipices on each side, was rendered almost impassable by a
perpendicular mass of rock, nearly thirty feet high, extending
across the whole breadth, with the exception of a small broken
rugged track in the centre. By removing a few large stones, they
were enabled to pass.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 19th, the party moved forward along this path;
bearing chiefly west, and west-south-east. They now began to ascend
the second ridge of the mountains, and from this elevation they
obtained for the first time an extensive view of the settlements
below. Mount Banks bore north-west; Grose Head, north-east;
Prospect Hill, east by south; the Seven Hills, east-north-east;*
Windsor, northeast by east. At a little distance from the spot at
which they began the ascent, they found a pyramidical heap of
stones, the work, evidently, of some European, one side of which
the natives had opened, probably in the expectation of finding some
treasure deposited in it. This pile they concluded to be the one
erected by Mr. Bass,** to mark the end of his journey. That
gentleman attempted, some time ago, to pass the mountains, and to
penetrate into the interior; but having got thus far, he gave up
the undertaking as impracticable; reporting, on his return, that it
was impossible to find a passage even for a person on foot. Here,
therefore, the party had the satisfaction of believing that they
had penetrated as far as any European had been before them.</p>

<p class="foot">[* So in Journal, but it should be "north-west".
Ed.]</p>

<p class="foot">[** The guess was incorrect. Ed.]</p>

<p>They encamped this day to refresh their horses, at the head of a
swamp covered with a coarse rushy grass, with a small run of good
water through the middle of it. In the afternoon, they left their
camp to mark and cut a road for the next day.</p>

<p>They proceeded with the horses on the 20th nearly five miles,
and encamped at noon at the head of a swamp about three acres in
extent, covered with the same coarse rushy grass as the last
station, with a stream of water running through it. The horses were
obliged to feed on the swamp grass, as nothing better could be
found for them. The travellers left the camp as before, in the
afternoon, to cut a road for the morrow's journey. The ridge along
which their course lay now became wider and more rocky, but was
still covered with brush and small crooked timber, except at the
heads of the different streams of water which ran down the side of
the mountain, where the land was swampy and clear of trees. The
track of scarcely any animal was to be seen, and very few birds.
One man was here taken dangerously ill with a cold. Bearing of the
route at first, south-westerly; afterwards north-north-west, and
west-north-west.</p>

<p>Their progress the next day was nearly four miles, in a
direction still varying from north-west-by-north to south-west.
They encamped in the middle of the day at the head of a
well-watered swamp, about five acres in extent; pursuing, as
before, their operations in the afternoon. In the beginning of the
night the dogs ran off and barked violently. At the same time
something was distinctly heard to run through the brushwood, which
they supposed to be one of the horses got loose; but they had
reason to believe afterwards that they had been in great
danger&mdash;that the natives had followed their track, and
advanced on them in the night, intending to have speared them by
the light of their fire, but that the dogs drove them off.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 22nd instant, they proceeded in the track
marked the preceding day rather more than three miles, in a
south-westerly direction, when they reached the summit of the third
and highest ridge of the mountains southward of Mount Banks. From
the bearing of Prospect Hill and Grose Head, they computed this
spot to be eighteen miles in a straight line from the River Nepean,
at the point at which they crossed it. On the top of this ridge
they found about two thousand acres of land clear of trees, covered
with loose stones and short coarse grass, such as grows on some of
the commons in England. Over this heath they proceeded for about a
mile and a half, in a south-westerly direction, and encamped by the
side of a fine stream of water, with just wood enough on the banks
to serve for firewood. From the summit they had a fine view of all
the settlements and country eastward, and of a great extent of
country to the westward and south-west. But their progress in both
the latter directions was stopped by an impassable barrier of rock,
which appeared to divide the interior from the coast as with a
stone wall, rising perpendicularly out of the side of the
mountain.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they left their little camp in the charge of
three of the men, and made an attempt to descend the precipice by
following some of the streams of water, or by getting down at some
of the projecting points where the rocks had fallen in; but they
were baffled in every instance. In some places the perpendicular
height of the rocks above the earth below could not be less than
four hundred feet. Could they have accomplished a descent, they
hoped to procure mineral specimens which might throw light on the
geological character of the country, as the strata appeared to be
exposed for many hundred feet, from the top of the rock to the beds
of the several rivers beneath. The broken rocky country on the
western side of the cow pasture has the appearance of having
acquired its present form from an earthquake, or some other
dreadful convulsion of nature, at a much later period than the
mountains northward, of which Mount Banks forms the southern
extremity. The aspect of the country which lay beneath them much
disappointed the travellers: it appeared to consist of sand and
small scrubby brushwood, intersected with broken rocky mountains,
with streams of water running between them to the eastward, towards
one point, where they probably form the Western River, and enter
the mountains.</p>

<p>They now flattered themselves that they had surmounted half the
difficulties of their undertaking, expecting to find a passage down
the mountain more to the northward.</p>

<p>On the next day they proceeded about three miles and a half; but
the trouble occasioned by the horses when they got off the open
land induced them to recur to their former plan of devoting the
afternoon to marking and clearing a tract for the ensuing day, as
the most expeditious method of proceeding, notwithstanding that
they had to go twice over the same ground. The bearing of their
course this day was, at first, north-east and north, and then
changed to north-west and north-north-west. They encamped on the
side of a swamp, with a beautiful stream of water running through
it.</p>

<p>Their progress on the next day was four miles and a-half, in a
direction varying from north-north-west to south-south-west: they
encamped, as before, at the head of a swamp. This day, between ten
and eleven a.m., they obtained a sight of the country below, when
the clouds ascended. As they were marking a road for the morrow,
they heard a native chopping wood very near them, who fled at the
approach of the dogs.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 25th, they could proceed only three miles and
a-half in a varying direction, encamping at two o'clock at the side
of a swamp. The underwood being very prickly and full of small
thorns, annoyed them very much. This day they saw the track of the
wombat (an animal which burrows in the ground as a badger, and
lives on grass) for the first time. On the 26th they proceeded two
miles and three-quarters. The brush still continued to be very
thorny. The land to the westward appeared sandy and barren. This
day they saw the fires of some natives below; the number they
computed at about thirty&mdash;men, women, and children. They
noticed also more tracks of the wombat. On the 27th they proceeded
five miles and a quarter&mdash;part of the way over another piece
of clear land, without trees; they saw more native fires, and about
the same number as before, but more in their direct course. From
the top of the rocks they saw a large piece of land below, clear of
trees, but apparently a poor reedy swamp. They met with some good
timber in this day's route.</p>

<p>The bearing of the route for the last three days has been
chiefly north and north-west.</p>

<p>On the 28th they proceeded about five miles and three-quarters.
Not being able to find water, they did not halt till five o'clock,
when they took up their station on the edge of the precipice. To
their great satisfaction, they discovered that what they had
supposed to be sandy barren land below the mountain, was forest
land, covered with good grass and with timber of an inferior
quality. In the evening they contrived to get their horses down the
mountain by cutting a small trench with a hoe, which kept them from
slipping, where they again tasted fresh grass for the first time
since they left the forest land on the other side of the mountain.
They were getting into miserable condition. Water was found about
two miles below the foot of the mountain. The second camp of
natives moved before them about three miles. In this day's route
little timber was observed fit for building.</p>

<p>On the 29th, having got up the horses and laden them, they began
to descend the mountain (Mt. York) at seven o'clock through a pass
in the rock, about thirty feet wide, which they had discovered the
day before, when the want of water put them on the alert. Part of
the descent was so steep that the horses could but just keep their
footing without a load, so that, for some way, the party were
obliged to carry the packages themselves. A cart road might,
however, easily be made by cutting a slanting trench along the side
of the mountain, which is here covered with earth. This pass is,
according to their computation, about twenty miles north-west, in a
straight line from the point at which they ascended the summit of
the mountains. They reached the foot at nine o'clock a.m., and
proceeded two miles north-north-west, mostly through open meadow
land, clear of trees, the grass from two to three feet high. They
encamped on the bank of a fine stream of water. The natives, as
observed by the smoke of their fires, moved before them as
yesterday. The dogs killed a kangaroo, which was very acceptable,
as the party had lived on salt meat since they caught the last. The
timber seen this day appeared rotten and unfit for building.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 30th, they rested in their encampment. One of the
party shot a kangaroo with his rifle, at a great distance across a
wide valley. The climate here was found very much colder than that
of the mountain or of the settlements on the east side, where no
signs of frost had made its appearance when the party set out.
During the night the ground was covered with a thick frost, and a
leg of the kangaroo was quite frozen. From the dead and brown
appearance of the grass it was evident that the weather had been
severe for some time past. We were all much surprised at this
degree of cold and frost in the latitude of about 34 degrees. The
track of the emu was noticed at several places near the camp.</p>

<p>On the Monday they proceeded about six miles, south-west and
west, through forest land, remarkably well watered, and several
open meadows, clear of trees, and covered with high good grass.
They crossed two fine streams of water. Traces of the natives
presented themselves in the fires they had left the day before, and
in the flowers of the honeysuckle tree scattered around, which had
supplied them with food. These flowers, which are shaped like a
bottle-brush, are very full of honey. The natives on this side of
the mountains appear to have no huts like those on the eastern
side, nor do they strip the bark or climb the trees. From the
shavings and pieces of sharp stones which they had left, it was
evident that they had been busily employed in sharpening their
spears.</p>

<p>The party encamped by the side of a fine stream of water, at a
short distance from a high hill, in the shape of a sugar-loaf. In
the afternoon they ascended its summit, from whence they descried
all around, forest or grass land, sufficient in extent in their
opinion, to support the stock of the colony for the next thirty
years. This was the extreme point of their journey. The distance
they had travelled they computed at about fifty-eight miles nearly
north-west; that is, fifty miles through the mountain, (the greater
part of which they had walked over three times,) and eight miles
through the forest land beyond it, reckoning the descent of the
mountain to be half-a mile to the foot.</p>

<p>The timber observed this day still appeared unfit for building.
The stones at the bottom of the rivers appeared very fine,
large-grained, dark coloured granite, of a kind quite different
from the mountain rocks, or from any stones which they had ever
seen in the colony. Mr. Blaxland and one of the men nearly lost the
party to-day by going too far in the pursuit of a kangaroo.</p>

<p>They now conceived that they had sufficiently accomplished the
design of their undertaking, having surmounted all the difficulties
which had hitherto prevented the interior of the country from being
explored, and the colony from being extended. They had partly
cleared, or, at least, marked out, a road by which the passage of
the mountain might easily be effected. Their provisions were nearly
expended, their clothes and shoes were in very bad condition, and
the whole party were ill with bowel complaints. These
considerations determined them therefore, to return home by the
track they came. On Tuesday, the 1st of June, they arrived at the
foot of the mountain which they had descended, where they encamped
for the night. The following day they began to ascend the mountain
at seven o'clock, and reached the summit at ten; they were obliged
to carry the packages themselves part of the ascent. They encamped
in the evening at one of their old stations. One of the men had
left his great coat on the top of the rock, where they reloaded the
horses, which was found by the next party who traversed the
mountain. On the 3rd they reached another of their old stations.
Here, during the night, they heard a confused noise arising from
the eastern settlements below, which, after having been so long
accustomed to the death-like stillness of the interior, had a very
striking effect. On the 4th they arrived at the end of their marked
track, and encamped in the forest land where they had cut the grass
for their horses. One of the horses fell this day with his load,
quite exhausted, and was with difficulty got on, after having his
load put on the other horses. The next day, the 5th, was the most
unpleasant and fatiguing they had experienced. The track not being
marked, they had great difficulty in finding their way back to the
river, which they did not reach till four o'clock p.m. They then
once more encamped for the night to refresh themselves and the
horses. They had no provisions now left except a little flour, but
procured some from the settlement on the other side of the river.
On Sunday, the 6th of June, they crossed the river after breakfast,
and reached their homes, all in good health. The winter had not set
in on this side of the mountain, nor had there been any frost.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Friday, November 19th, 1813</i>&mdash;I directed the
Provisions and other necessarys to be conveyed across the Nepean to
the N.E. Point of Forest Land, commonly called Emu Island, which
was done, and by the time every thing was arranged evening
approached.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 20th.</i>&mdash;The Night was most uncomfortable,
and the Morning being wet prevented our departing so early as I
meant; feeling anxious to proceed, I made up my mind to make the
best of our way to the end of the Mountains, and on my return to
measure the distance of Messrs. Blaxlands, Wentworths and Lawsons
recent excursion; it appeared to me that while the Horses were
fresh it was a plan likely to meet with approbation, as I could
then refresh them on good grass, and take my time in exploring to
the Westward, which I conceived the object of the greatest
importance; on returning should I not have sufficient provisions to
subsist on to complete measuring the track of the above named
Gentlemen, I could send in a Man and Horse to meet me with a small
supply.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 22nd</i>&mdash;The Weather bad; determined to proceed
we loaded the Horses when one of them turned stubborn having laid
down and rolled several times over his load; he at length became
steady; our track was through a thick brush; at 9 o'Clock we were
on a very high Mountain but could not see any of the low Country;
it is now disagreeable travelling; the Brush is so very thick, and
the surface of the ridges are covered with pieces of sharp Granite
intermixed with Quartz; the Horses seemed to step with caution; we
stopped at 1 o'Clock, where there was a spacious Valley covered
with grass and Rushes, a stream of water running through it.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 24th.</i>&mdash;We all rested, which was a
preservation to us, not having done so since our departure, and
which we felt the effects of, as nothing could be procured for
shelter but green Boughs, that was not sufficient to screen us from
rain; we start quite refreshed; at 9 o'Clock came to the end of the
Range from which the Prospect is extensive and gives me sanguine
hopes; the descent is rugged and steep; I stowed away here a week's
provisions in some hollow Cliffs in hopes of it being sufficient
for our use back from this place; it was 12 o'Clock when we got
into a Valley of good feed and appears a fine part of the Country;
I have no doubt but the points of Ridges or Bluffs to the N.W. and
S. (the Country seems to open in the form of this Angle) are the
termination of what is called the <i>Blue Mountains</i> and that we
are now over them; at 1 o'Clock I stopped on the bank of a
Riverlett, which is a rapid stream from the N.E., its source
springing from very high Mountainous; the two dogs went off after
game without success and came to us severely cut.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 26th.</i>&mdash;My Course is along the Stream; the
banks are sandy and appear to be overflowed at times by heaps of
Timber being lodged at the foot of some of the Trees; when I had
proceeded about 2 miles the Forest ground rises and forms a steeper
Bank; in places the Water has a great fall over Rocks; the numerous
Valleys carry off the Water in rainy seasons into the riverlett; on
one of the small ridges is a Rock resembling <i>White Marble</i>
with Yellow Veins; we could not break it but from small Crevices I
scraped out small pieces much like Crystal (Paper No. 1); at 4
Miles the stream alters its direction to the South, at which place
the main Run joins from the West forming a considerable rapid
Riverlett; the land here gets better and the Country has a fine
appearance; it resembles the hills to the Eastward of the <i>Cori
Linn</i> at Port Dalrymple, and put me in mind particularly of that
part; the Trees being thin and light, the flats clear of Timber, a
few Honeysuckles on the Banks of the Ridges, the Lockett Bird
singing, and the seed of the wild Burnett sticking to our legs,
neither of the two last are to be seen on the East side of the
Mountains; the soil still continues sandy but the feed is good, and
better than any I have seen in New South Wales; I stopped this
evening near the foot of a very handsome Mount, which I take the
liberty to call <i>Mount Blaxland</i>, also two Peaks rather North
of it, and which the Riverlett separates <i>Wentworths and Lawsons
Sugar Loaves</i>. I am at a loss to describe the pleasant
appearance of this place, the Grass being quite green and good
makes it look a pleasing scene, this is the termination of the
excursion of the above named Gentlemen; be assured it was not
without much labour, perseverance and fatigue that enabled them to
reach thus far; I am certain that it is at least 50 Miles, and as
the present track is, no person in the Colony on the Choicest Horse
could reach this and return to the Nepean in four days; you may
rely on what I say in this respect; the Mountains being covered
with sharp Granite, would be dangerous to put any Horse out of a
walk, and impossible so to do through the Brushes; Kangaroos are
numerous, we caught one this day altho' the dogs are so much
hurt.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 29th.</i>&mdash;I stopped in very bad Spirits, not
being able to get on, being completely entangled among the hills,
and our Course being so little Westling; were it not for the Horses
the difficulty to ourselves would be nothing; they are sometimes
bad to manage, and soon tire among the high Lands; when so they
will not move; after travelling 2&frac12; Miles we were on a lofty hill,
from whence the Country N.W. is all Forest hills as far as I could
see, which I suppose about 15 Miles, every other direction was
obscured by high Ranges; impossible there can be a better grazing
Track of land, and has the same good appearance as far as I have
been able to get a sight of it to the Westward; I hope I will be
able to do better tomorrow, and that in a few days my account will
be more interesting.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 30th.</i>&mdash;I have at length reached the Ridge I
so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles, where I had a
prospect to the North for a great distance; A Mist arises from a
part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off;
the Country in this direction has a fine appearance, the Trees
being thin and the hills covered with Grass; A &frac14; of Mile farther
along the Range, I came to a very high Mount, when I was much
pleased with the sight Westward; I think I can see 40 Miles which
had the look of an open Country. To the South of me there are large
hills much higher than the one I am on, with pasture to their tops;
This Range is rather overrun with underwood and larger Timber
growing thereon, but the sides are as green as possible; in
descending for 2 Miles the verdure is good; the descent then
becomes steep for a &frac14; of a Mile, leading into a fine valley at the
end I met a large Riverlett arising from the Southern Hills. We
shot Ducks and caught several trout weighing at least 5 or 6 Pounds
each.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, December 1st, 1813</i>&mdash;My Course is down the
Riverlett; it appears to lead me North of West; on the North side
of it at this place is a remarkable Sugar Loaf Hill having a Stone
on the Peak of it, which I have named after myself; I am more
pleased with the Country every day; it is a great extent of Grazing
land without being divided by barren spaces as on the East side of
the Mountains, and well watered by running streams in almost every
Valley; I took a walk to the top of a very high Mount where I can
see at least 50 Miles West, which gives me great Spirits.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 4th.</i>&mdash;My Progress is through an exceeding
good Track of Country; it is the handsomest I have yet seen with
gentle rising hills and dales well watered; the distant hills,
which are about 5 Miles South, appear as Grounds laid out divided
into fields by edges, there are few Trees on them and the Grass
quite green; I still keep the river, and at times I walk a few
Miles South or North as seems to me most requisite. The Dogs killed
a Kangaroo and the river supplies us <i>with abundance of
Fish</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 5th.</i>&mdash;We remained near the River as it is
Sunday. The Horses are getting fat but am Sorry to observe their
backs are sore; the Saddles should have been lined; straw stuffing
is too hard to render it easy we put our Blankets under them; I
walked out this Evening some Miles; I cannot speak too highly of
the Country, indeed I am now at a loss what to say as it exceeds my
expectations and daily gets better. We are on an Allowance of Bread
having lost so much by the bad Weather on the Mountains, we require
little pork in this part, a Kangaroo can be procured at any time,
there are also Emu's, we killed some Ducks this day.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 6th.</i>&mdash;The river now forms large ponds; at
the Space of about a Mile I came on a fine Plain of rich Land, the
handsomest Country I ever saw; it surpasseth Port Dalrymple; this
place is worth speaking of as good and beautiful; the Track of
clear land occupies about a Mile on each side of the River; I have
named it after the Lieut. Governor, "O'Connell Plains," on which we
saw a number of wild Geese but too shy to let us near them; the
Timber around is thinly scattered, I do not suppose there are more
than ten Gum Trees on an Acre, their Bark is amazing thick at least
2 Inches; At 3 o'Clock I stopped at the commencement of a Plain
still more pleasing and very Extensive; I cannot see the
termination of it North of me; the soil is exceeding rich and
produces the finest grass intermixed with variety of herbs; the
hills have the look of a park and Grounds laid out; I am at a loss
for Language to describe the Country; I named this part "Macquarie
Plains".</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 9th.</i>&mdash;I have called the Main Stream
"Macquarie River". At 2&frac12; Miles commences a most extensive Plain,
the hills around are fine indeed; it requires a clever person to
describe this Country properly, I never saw any thing equal to it;
the soil is good; I think the lower parts of the Plains are
overflowed at times, but do not see marks to any height; the small
Trees on the lower banks of the River stand straight, not laying
down as you see them on the banks of the river and Creeks at
Hawkesbury. The grass here might be mowed it is so thick and long,
particularly on the flat lands.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 10th.</i>&mdash;Yesterdays trace led me much North of
West; today it is South of it. The extent of the Plain following
the River is 11 Miles and about 2 wide on each side, the whole
excellent good land, and the best Grass I have seen in any part of
New South Wales; the hills are also covered with fine pasture, the
Trees being so far apart must be an acquisition to its Growth; it
is in general the sweetest in an open Country. At the termination
of the Plain is a very handsome Mount; I named it "Mount Pleasant"
from the Prospect it commands to the N.E. The River now winds
itself round the Points of Forest hills nearly the same as
described some days since.</p>

<p>Emues are numerous; the Dogs will not give chase; I imagine they
are bad ones; we have not been able to get a shot at any of the
Geese, altho' plentiful, they are so shy; but frequently shoot
Ducks. Nothing astonished me more than the amazing large Fish that
are caught; one is now brought me that weighs at least 15 lb., they
are all the same species. I call the Plains last passed over
"Bathurst Plains".</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 18th.</i>&mdash;We departed for our journey
homewards, keeping as far from the River as we conveniently could,
and find the feed for Stock exceeding good; the farther back among
these hills the better it is; the Valleys are beautiful, as also
the intervening ridges that divide them, being thickly covered with
herbage; Grazers may keep stock here to great advantage,
particularly sheep, as they like dry healthy parts.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 21st.</i>&mdash;Fine weather very warm; halted at
the commencement of <i>Bathurst Plains</i> early, as I was desirous
to examine this part; I ascended <i>Mount Pleasant</i>, the West
end led me on a Ridge of Beautiful hills, along which I travelled 3
Miles, a small stream of Water forming ponds run at their foot; I
was gratified with a pleasing sight of an open Country to the S.W.
of them; at the space of 7 or 8 Miles I could discern <i>the Course
of a River winding to the West</i>; I saw three or four large
Plains; the first of them I was on, the Chain of Ponds before
mentioned running through it; I feel much regret I am not able to
Travel a week or more in that direction; I imagine the flat open
Country extends 30 or 40 Miles; at the termination I can only
discern one Mountain quite Pale with three Peaks; I suspected an
open Country lay about the S.W. point, as I passed, the Range of
hills then obscured it from me, nor had I time to examine it; I
cannot speak too much of the Country, the increase of Stock for
some 100 Years cannot overrun it; the Grass is so good and
intermixed with variety of herbs. Emu's and Geese are numerous, but
cannot get any; we counted 41 Emu's this day; our dogs will not
follow them. Returning we saw smoke on the North side of the River,
at Sun sett as we were fishing I saw some Natives coming down the
Plain; they did not see us untill we surprized them; there was only
two Women and four Children, the poor Creatures trembled and fell
down with fright; I think they were coming for Water; I gave them
what Fish we had, some Fish Hooks, Twine and a Tomahawk, they
appeared glad to get from us; two Boys ran away; the other small
Children cried much at first; a little while after I played with
them they began to be good humoured and laugh, both of the Women
were blind of their Right Eye.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 23rd.</i>&mdash;About 9 o'clock crossed Campbell's
River; the Water has fallen so much that it was fordable in many
places, which saved us a journey of 6 Miles round to our Bridge;
Macquaries River is likewise fordable between the large sheets of
Water; these rivers resemble the <i>Esks</i> in Van Diemans Land,
being fine streams running over hard gravel Bottoms, I kept some
distance back from the River and find the Country as usual, fine
pasture and distant hill North and South are Forest lands thinly
wooded; we stopped at the West end of O'Connell Plains.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 25th.</i>&mdash;Being Christmas day we remained for
a day's rest; yet we walked about as much as a day's journey
looking around us, and ascending Hills to see the Country, which is
excellent pasture, the soil is light, but exceeds the Forest Lands
in general on the East side of the Mountains. The day is so hott
the Fish will not bite; it is the only time they have missed;
therefore I opened my tin case of Roasted Beef.</p>

ON THE COUNTRY BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS</h3>

<p>Government and General Orders*.<br>
Government House, Sydney, 10th June, 1815.</p>

</p>

<p>THE Governor desires to communicate, for the information of the
public, the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue
Mountains, undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally
to appreciate the importance of the Tract of Country lying Westward
of them, which had been explored in the latter end of the year,
1813, and the beginning of 1814, by Mr. G. W. Evans, Deputy
Surveyor of Lands.</p>

<p>To those, who know how very limited a tract of country has been
hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Wales, extending
along the eastern coast, to the north and south of Port Jackson,
only 80 miles, and westward about 40 miles to the foot of the chain
of mountains in the interior, which forms its western boundary, it
must be a matter of astonishment and regret that amongst so large a
population no one appeared, within the first 25 years of the
establishment of this settlement, possessed of sufficient energy of
mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains;
but, when it is considered that, for the greater part of that time,
even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient
produce for the wants of the people, whilst on the other hand the
whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick, and
in many places nearly an impenetrable, forest, the surprise at the
want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very
considerably.</p>

<p>The records of the Colony only afford two instances of any bold
attempt, having been made to discover the country to the westward
of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr. Bass, and the other by
Mr. Cayley; and both ended in disappointment; a circumstance, which
will not be much wondered at by those, who have lately crossed
those mountains.</p>

<p>To G. BIaxland and W. Wentworth, Esqs., and Lieutenant Lawson,
of the Royal Veteran Company, the merit is due of having, with
extraordinary patience and much fatigue, effected the first passage
over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p>The Governor, being strongly impressed with the importance of
the object, had early after his arrival in this colony, formed the
resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the
Western Country, and willingly availed himself of the facilities,
which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him.
Accordingly on the 20th of November, 1813, he entrusted the
accomplishment of this object to Mr. G. W. Evans, Deputy Surveyor
of Lands, the result of whose journey was laid before the public
through the medium of the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> on the 12th of
Feb., 1814.</p>

<p>The favourable account given by Mr. Evans of the country he had
explored, induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed
for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the
interior; and men of good character, from amongst a number of
convicts who had volunteered their services, were selected to
perform this arduous work, on condition of being fed and clothed
during the continuance of their labour, and being granted
emancipation, as their final reward, on the completion of the
work.</p>

<p>The direction and superintendence of this great work was
entrusted to W. Cox, Esq., the chief magistrate of Windsor; and to
the astonishment of every one, who knows what was to be encountered
and sees what has been done, he effected its completion in six
months from the time of its commencement, happily without the loss
of a man or any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to
appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr. Cox to this colony in
the execution of this arduous work, which promises to be of the
greatest public utility by opening a new source of wealth to the
industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr. Cox
voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house and the
society of his numerous family, and exposed himself to much
personal fatigue with only such temporary covering, as a bark hut
could afford, from the inclemency of the season, it is difficult to
express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and
services are entitled.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of
January, the Governor, accompanied by Mrs. Macquarie and that
gentleman, commenced his tour on the 25th of April over the Blue
Mountains, and was joined by Sir J. Jamieson at the Nepean, who
accompanied him during the entire tour.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen composed the Governor's
suite:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell, secretary; Captain Antill, major of brigade;
Lieutenant Watts, aide-de-camp; Mr. Redfern, assistant surgeon; Mr.
Oxley, surveyor-general; and Mr. G. W. Evans, deputy surveyor of
lands, who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further
discoveries and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at
Bathurst plains.</p>

<p>The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first
depot, and thence to a resting place, now called "Spring Wood",
distant 12 miles from Emu Ford, was through a very handsome open
forest of lofty trees, and much more practicable and easy than was
expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited
surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to give the
traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to
encounter. At the further distance of 4 miles, a sudden change is
perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the
soil, the former becoming stunted, and the latter barren and rocky.
At this place, the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence.
Here the country became altogether mountainous and extremely
rugged. Near the 18th mile mark (it is observed that the measure
commences from Emu Ford) a pile of stones attracted attention; it
is close to the line of the road on the top of a rugged and abrupt
ascent, and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr. Cayley, as
the extreme limit of his tour; hence the Governor gave that part of
the mountain the name of "Cayley's Repulse". To have penetrated
even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From
hence, forward to the 26th mile, is a succession of steep and
rugged hills, some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a
passage altogether; but at this place an extensive plain is arrived
at, which constitutes the summit of the Western Mountain; and from
thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on
all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor, the river Hawkesbury,
Prospect Hill, and other objects within that part of the colony now
inhabited, of equal interest, are distinctly seen from hence. The
majestic grandeur of the situation, combined with the various
objects to be seen from this place, induced the Governor to give it
the appellation of "The King's Table Land".</p>

<p>On the S.W. side of the King's Table Land, the mountain
terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth; at the bottom of
which is seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can he imagined,
bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude,
terminating equally abruptly as the others, and the whole thickly
covered with timber. The length of this picturesque and remarkable
tract of country is about 24 miles, to which the Governor gave the
name of "The Prince Regent's Glen". Proceeding hence to the 33rd
mile on the top of a hill, an opening presents itself on the S.W.
side of the Prince Regent's Glen from whence a view is obtained
particularly beautiful and grand. Mountains rising beyond
mountains, with stupendous masses of rock in the foreground, here
strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The circular form,
in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed, induced the Governor
to give the name of "Pitt's Amphitheatre", in honour of the late
Right Hon. Wm. Pitt, to this first branch from the Prince Regent's
Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on
the ridge of the mountain, which forms one side of the Prince
Regent's Glen; and it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular
precipice of 676 feet high, as ascertained by measurement. The road
constructed by Mr. Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent
through all its windings is no less than three fourths of a mile in
length, and has been executed with such skill and stability, as
reflects much credit on him. The labour here under gone and the
difficulties surmounted can only be appreciated by those who view
the scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr. Cox's services,
the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name
to this grand and extraordinary Pass, and he accordingly called it
"Cox's Pass". Having descended into the valley at the bottom of
this pass, the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is
much higher than those on either side of it; from whence it is
distinguished at a considerable distance, when approaching it from
the interior, and in this point of view it has the appearance of a
very high distinct hill, although it is in fact only the abrupt
termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of "Mount York"
to this termination of the ridge in honour of his Royal Highness
the Duke of York.</p>

<p>On descending Cox's Pass, the Governor was much gratified by the
appearance of good pasture land, and soil fit for Cultivation,
which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his
tour. The valley at the base of Mount York, he called "the Vale of
Clwyd" in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale
of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good
quality and very abundant, and rivulet of fine water runs along it
from the eastward, which unites itself at the western extremity of
the vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The
junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river, now
called by the Governor "Cox's River", which takes its course, as
has been ascertained, through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties
itself into the Nepean River; and it is conjectured from the nature
of the country, through which it passes, that it must be one of the
principal causes of the floods, which have been occasionally felt
on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury into which the Nepean
discharges itself. The vale of Clwyd from the base of Mount York
extends six miles in a westerly direction, and has its termination
at Cox's River. West of this river the country again becomes hilly;
but is generally open forest land and very good pasturage.</p>

<p>Three miles to the Westward of the Vale of Clwyd, Messrs.
Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson had formerly terminated their
excursion; and when the various difficulties are considered, which
they had to contend with, especially until they had effected the
descent from Mount York, to which place they were obliged to pass
through a thick brush wood, where they were under the necessity of
cutting a passage for the baggage horses, the severity of which
labour had seriously affected their healths, their patient
endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and
admiration. In commemoration of their merits, three beautiful high
hills, joining each other at the end of their tour at this place,
have received their names in the following order, viz.; "Mount
Blaxland," "Wentworth's Sugar Loaf," and "Lawson's Sugar Loaf". A
range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the
tract of country from Cox's River for a distance of 16 miles, until
the Fish River is arrived at; and the stage between these rivers is
consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this
Range, the Governor gave the name of "Clarence Hilly Range".</p>

<p>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short distance from it,
a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attention, its
summits being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking
rock, nearly circular in form, which gives to the whole very much
the appearance of a hill or fort, such as are frequent in India. To
this lofty hill, Mr. Evans, who was the first European discoverer,
gave the name of "Mount Evans". Passing on from hence, the country
continues hilly, but affords a good pasturage, gradually improving
to Sidmouth Valley, which is distant from the pass of the Fish
River 12 miles. The land here is level, and the first met with
unincumbered with timber; it is not of very considerable extent,
but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants, such as would
probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanists. This
beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east between hills
of easy ascent, thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth
Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and, in other respects,
resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for
some miles. Having reached Campbell River, distance 13 miles from
Sidmouth Valley, the Governor was highly gratified by the
appearance of the country, which there began to exhibit an open and
extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains, judging
from the height of the banks and its general width, the Campbell
River must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude but
the extraordinary drought, which has apparently prevailed on the
western side of the mountains, equally as throughout this colony
for the last three years, has reduced this river so much, that it
may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream
at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River,
the very curious animal called the Paradox or Water-mole is seen in
great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich, and the
grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the
line of road which crosses the Campbell River, there is a very fine
tract of low lands, which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was
found growing in considerable quantities. The Fish River, which
forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the
northward of the road and bridge over the latter, has also two very
fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Connell Plains, and
the other Macquarie Plains, both of very considerable extent and
capable of yielding all the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell
River, Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a rich tract of
campaign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on both sides by
gently rising and very beautiful hills, thinly wooded. The
Macquarie River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish
and Campbell River, takes a winding course through the plains,
which can be easily traced from the high lands adjoining by the
particular verdure of the trees on its bank, which are likewise the
only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clear
surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the
appearance of lands in a state of cultivation.</p>

<p>It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of
admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude, which
reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by
nature for the occupancy and comfort of man, create a degree of
melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than
described.</p>

<p>The Governor and suite arrived at these plains on Thursday, the
4th of May, and encamped on the southern left bank of the Macquarie
river; the situation being selected in consequence of its
commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in
every direction around it. At this place, the Governor remained for
a week, which time he occupied in making excursions in different
directions through the adjoining country on both sides of the
river.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor fixed on a site suitable
for the erection of a town at some future period, to which he gave
the name of "Bathurst," in honour of the present Secretary of State
for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated
sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur, and it
is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to
derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The
mechanics and settlers, of whatever description, who may be
hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at
this place, will have the highly important advantages of a rich and
fertile soil, with a beautiful river flowing through it, for all
the uses of man. The Governor must, however, add, that the hopes,
which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming
navigable to the Western Sea, have ended in disappointment.</p>

<p>During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst, he made
daily excursions in various directions:&mdash;one of these extended
22 miles in a south-west direction, and on that occasion, as well
as on all others, he found the country chiefly composed of valleys
and plains, separated occasionally by ranges of low hills, the
soils throughout being generally fertile and well circumstanced for
the purpose of agriculture and grazing. The Governor here feels
much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that
the favourable reports, which he had received of the country to the
west of the Blue Mountains, have not been by any means exaggerated.
The difficulties, which present themselves in the journey from
hence, are certainly great and inevitable; but those persons, who
may be inclined to become permanent settlers there, will probably
content themselves with visiting this part of the colony but
rarely, and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of
water and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains
for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them; and the
tracts of fertile soil and rich pasturage, which the new country
affords, are fully extensive enough for any increase of population
and stock, which can possibly take place for years.</p>

<p>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst, there
is not less than 50,000 acres of land clear of timber, and fully
one half of that may be considered excellent soil, well calculated
for cultivation. It is a matter of regret, that, in proportion as
the soil improves, the timber degenerates; and it is to be
remarked, that every where to the westward of the Mountains, it is
much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present
colony; there is, however, a sufficiency of timber of tolerable
quality, within the district around Bathurst, for the purpose of
house-building and husbandry.</p>

<p>The Governor has here to lament, that neither coals or limestone
have yet been discovered in the western country, articles in
themselves of so much importance that the want of them must be
severely felt whenever that country shall be settled.</p>

<p>Having enumerated the principal and most important features of
this new country, the Governor has now to notice some of its live
productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of game; and
the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish, but all
of one denomination, resembling the perch in appearance and of a
delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a rock-cod; this fish
grows to a large size, and is very voracious. Several of them were
caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at the
halting-place of the Fish River. One of those caught weighed 17
lb., and the people stationed at Bathurst stated, that they had
caught some weighing 25 lbs.</p>

<p>The field game are kangarooes, emus, black swans, wild geese,
wild turkeys, bustards, ducks of various kinds, quail, bronze and
other pigeons, etc.; the water-mole or paradox also abounds in all
the rivers and ponds.</p>

<p>The site designed for the town of Bathurst, by observation taken
at a flag-staff, which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving
that name, is situated in lat. 33&deg; 24' 30" south, and in long.
149&deg; 37' 45" east of Greenwich, being also 27&frac12; miles north of
Government House in Sydney, and 94&frac12; west of it, bearing west
20&deg; 30' north 83 geographic miles, or 95&frac12; statute miles; the
measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English
miles.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 17th of May, the Governor and suite set out
from Bathurst on their return, and arrived at Sydney on Friday, the
19th ult.</p>

<p>The Governor deems it expedient to notify here to the public
that he does not mean to make any grant of land to the westward of
the Blue Mountains, until he shall receive the commands of his
Majesty's Ministers on that subject, and in reply to the report he
is now about to make them upon it.</p>

<p>In the mean time, such gentlemen, or other respectable free
persons, as may wish to visit this new country, will be permitted
to do so on making a written application to the Governor to that
effect, who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It
is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person,
whether civil or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue
Mountains, without having previously applied for and obtained
permission in the above prescribed form. The military guard
stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full
instructions to prevent the progress of any persons, who shall not
have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing
and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one,
who will reflect on it, to require any explanation here.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>IV. EVANS'S DISCOVERY OF THE
LACHLAN</h3>

<blockquote>[EVANS left Sydney on his second inland journey In 1815
under instructions from Governor Macquarie to pursue a western
course from Bathurst "until he shall fall in with the western
ocean." The Governor hoped that he might meet with some great river
"which may probably fall into the sea on that part of the coast
bearing in a south-easterly direction from Spencer's Gulf." Evans
did not reach the sea on this journey, but he found the river
Lachlan*.]<br></blockquote>

</p>

<p><i>Saturday, May 13th, 1815.</i>&mdash;I should have left
Bathurst yesterday; when near ready to go, one of my Horses threw
his Load, which damaged some of his tackling; repairs being
necessary caused my delay until the Morning; my Course was S.
30&deg; W. or thereabouts along the fine flat, named Queen
Charlotte Vale. I halted near the junction of it with the Main
Creek, which bears S. 20 W., having plains on both sides; the Vale
is also clear of Timber; this day's journey is over exceeding good
Land, well watered.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 14th.</i>&mdash;I follow the Vale, which still
continues very good; at about 5 Miles, a fine Valley comes into it,
bearing up S. 20 W., which is well watered; at 6&frac12; Miles, the Valley
is rather contracted, and remains so a short distance, when it
again opens, producing the rankest of Grass with ponds as before
alternately; the Land is of the strongest nature; the hills that
gradually rise on each side are covered with good pasture; the
steepest of them grow serviceable Timber, namely Stringy Bark,
which is a Tree most used in this part of the World.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 15th.</i>&mdash;Lost the Horses; they were tied
together, but not secured in a proper manner; the Men were in
search of them, but returned without success late in the day. I
then went myself, and had the good fortune to come upon their
track; at length discovered them fast round a Tree in Princess
Charlotte Valley; the walk afforded me an opportunity of seeing a
part that was before obscured from sight by the Woods in travelling
along the Ridge.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 16th.</i>&mdash;The first half hour's Chaining was
tolerably good; but, for six Miles afterwards, it was extremely
fatiguing along a Rocky and Bushy Ridge, which led me to the Centre
of the three hills, I shewed you in our long Ride and which I have
named "<i>Mount Macquarie</i>"; the three range in a direct line,
bearing N.W. and S.E.; that to the S.E. measuring &frac34; of a Mile from
Mount Macquarie, I call "<i>Maclaine's Peak</i>"; the N.W. one is
separated from the others by a small Gully, and at a distance of
about 2 Miles from Mount Macquarie, I have named "Antill's Peak";
they are most remarkable and conspicuous hills; I see no other in
any direction of their shape; from these lofty eminences, I had a
clear and perfect View of the Country. The S.W., West and N.W. is a
series of high Mountainous hills, their tops shewing themselves at
a great distance; in the direction of E. 20&deg; S., about 15 Miles
is a fine looking Country; there are plains, I suppose it, towards
the head of Campbell River, as I can trace it down some distance;
it continues round to S.E. If I cannot do better, or see a more
satisfactory prospect Westward tomorrow, I shall travel South for
10 or 12 Miles, where, from present appearances, I think I may be
able to wind round some hills again to the West; the hill at the
end of my last journey is W. 12&deg; N. about 14 Miles. I was
convinced, when there, I could not make further in a S.W. line, all
my dependance is in getting South about; I halted at some Water
holes running N.E.; they empty themselves into the River by way of
Queen Charlotte Vale.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 19th.</i>&mdash;After a Mile and half, finding the
Valley bend off East of South, I followed a ridge; in the space of
two Miles, I had asscended a very high Conical hill; the sight from
it quite astonished me; the whole Country I suppose from 30 to 40
Miles from S.E. to S.W. is covered with Conic hills, which are lost
to me in distant Mountains. I took a Man to examine a few Miles,
and found that between each Chain of these pointed hills are ponds;
in one of the Gullies is a small stream; with much difficulty I
travelled down it to a Main one from the S.E.; to climb up the
hills we were obliged to crawl upon our hands and knees: the whole
of them are thinly wooded with small Crooked Gums and covered with
good Grass; but the sharp Rocks render travelling disagreeable and
bad. I went among them, so far as to convince me that the principal
Stream runs through a break, bearing near West; the last two Miles
Chaining took me close upon three hours, nor could the Horses
travel faster from sliping about; besides this is not half the
difficulties, that appears before us, which I unavoidably
experienced to make myself certain of the direction the Stream led.
<i>Appledore</i> and myself returned much fatigued, I never was
more so in my life; from a sudden slip in climbing the hills, I am
quite unwell with a pain in my left side; I thought it would be
labour in vain to penetrate into a Country, where I could not see a
possibility for a Road to be made, or Horses to travel with loads
in safety.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 22nd.</i>&mdash;I took a W. 20&deg; S. direction
through a fine Grazing Country, most part a thick Forest of various
description of good grown timber; at five Miles is a Valley, which
bears down West. A remarkable round top'd high hill is now North of
me, about 4 Miles, I have taken the liberty to name it "<i>Mount
Lachlan</i>".</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 23rd.</i>&mdash;There are hills a-head. I thought a
West Course would avoid them, but found I was necessitated to
asscend, and the Ridge led me onward for Four Miles, when a
prospect appear'd at which I was highly gratified. I never saw a
more pleasing Country. I cannot express the pleasure, I feel, in
going forward; the hills we have passed are excellent land, well
wooded; to the South distant objects are obscured by high hills; in
the S.W. are very distant Mountains; under them appear a Mist as
tho' rising over a River; it has the like look round to West; but,
beyond, the loom of low hills are very faintly distinguished; in
the N.W. are high distant Mountains; one with a flat top bearing N.
70&deg; W., I name "Jamison's Table Mountain". The intermediate
space is a grassy Country, thinly wooded; there are hills and
dales; between some, appear Valleys clear of Timber; at a great
distance is a remarkable Peaked hill standing alone, as it were, in
the Centre of an immense flat Country. Finding a Valley with ponds
led near N.W., my anxiety obliges me to deviate from the intended
course to follow them; at a Mile and half is a clear hill on my
right hand, which I have named "Mount Molle," and the fine Valley
under it "Redfern Valley", the end of Four Miles ponds form a
junction from an E. 20&deg; S. point down a spacious flat, I have
called it "Meehan Valley". I then travel near West; at about a Mile
other Ponds join the Main ones from the N.E., and at the end of
to-day's journey they have almost the appearance of a River; there
is no perceptible Stream, but some of the ponds are a &frac14; and &frac12; a
Mile long.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 24th.</i>&mdash;My Course was West for three
Miles; it led me to the top of an high hill; the Water shewed
itself about &frac12; Mile North of me; on the South is an extensive flat;
from the hill I travelled W. 20&deg; S. two Miles; at one and half,
I crossed a small Creek coming from the South leading to the Ponds;
I then went on again West for 5&frac12; Miles, which brought me on a
second hill; in following it down, I was rather North of West for
upwards of a Mile, and there found a Creek bearing up South; I
resolved on tracing it, which I did for three Miles North; here the
points of the hills end in perpendicular heads 30 or 40 feet high,
which is pure Lime Stone of a Misty Grey Colour; this Creek joins
the bed of a River, rising in a N. 30&deg; E. direction, now dry
except in hollow places; it is full 70 ft. wide, having a pebbly
bottom; on each side grow large swamp Oaks; I travelled down in the
bed of it &frac34; of a Mile near West, and halted greatly fatigued. The
open Country and falling on the Water courses encouraged me so much
that I made every exertion to push forward, besides being full of
anxiety hoping soon to reach a River of some consequence. Every
steep hill, between the Lime Rocks and Bathurst, may be avoided
except two, and they are not worse than that at the Fish River. An
handsomer and finer Country I never saw than what I have been over
these last two Days; greatest part of the Land is good; Timber is
its worst production; Kangaroos Emu and Wild Ducks are very
numerous.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 25th.</i>&mdash;The Lime Cliffs having the
appearance of being very steep down the run, I thought it prudent
to let the Horses have a day's rest; in the mean time I took
Appledore with me to examine the Country; large Ponds of Water are
now in the River Bed; they connect with each other by a small
stream that I distinctly see to rise up between the Stones; its
general course is W. 15&deg; N. I walked down about Five Miles; it
was impossible to proceed further as perpendicular Cliffs of Slate
Rock prevents me; with much difficulty I got so far. The Stream is
now equal to Macquarie River. On leaving the Water, I made for the
high Peak, which bore S. 40&deg; E. about three Miles; it was a
fatiguing matter to reach the top and feel happy I did so, as it
convinced me I could not go on in a West direction, as I should be
impeded by high head lands and Gullies. I named the Peak "Mount
Lewin".</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 28th.</i>&mdash;Being determined to see the Plains I
started at day break with a Man; in the space of an hour, we
arrived on one this side of the River; it reached about a Mile, and
is at least 1&frac12; deep. I suppose I went up the River six Miles; the
Plains are alternately on each, and nearly the same size; opposite
to the Plains are Woodlands, and appeared to continue so for a
great distance S. 30&deg; W.; the River comes from about that
point, and to the best of my judgment the Stream empties into it
that I mention on the 19th Instant; the Soil on the plains is very
rich, and the woodlands are equally so; when about to return we saw
a number of Natives. On making towards them, they run from us; all
that I could do had no avail in having communication with them; it
was past One O'Clock when we got back, and I was too fatigued to go
down the River any distance, therefore remained to wash and clean
ourselves; I have named the Plains "Oxley's Plains".</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 31st.</i>&mdash;The River took the direction I
supposed N.W.; points of Rocky hills, every Mile or Mile and half,
lead down to it; the flats continue rich Soil; on the S.W. side are
no hills, but a continued space of level Rich Land, thinly wooded,
except near the Water's edge, where the timber is good and very
large; they are what is called Black Butted Gums; some of them are
8 and 10 feet in diamiter. We see Natives two or three times a day;
I believe we are a great terror to them; a Woman with a young Child
fell in our way this afternoon, to whom I gave a Tomahawk and other
trifles; she was glad to depart; soon after we suddenly came upon a
Man, who was much frightened; he run up a Tree in a moment,
carrying with him his Spear and Crooked throwing Stick; he hallowed
and cryed out so much and loud, that he might have been heard half
a Mile; it was useless entreating him to come down, therefore stuck
a Tomahawk in the Tree, and left him; the more I spoke, the more he
cryed out. 7 Miles.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 1st June, 1815.</i>&mdash;The River to-day is near
West, and am clear of the points of hills; the Country is good
indeed; these fine flats are flooded; there are rising Lands clear
of it as I before stated, but no hill that will afford a prospect;
to-morrow I am necessitated to return, and shall asscend a very
high hill, I left on my right Hand early this Morning. I could
leave no mark here more than cutting Trees; on one situated in an
Angle of the River and a wet Creek, bearing up North, I have deeply
carved "Evans 1st June 1815". The Country continues good, and
better than ever I expected to discover.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 2nd June.</i>&mdash;In travelling back, I left the
River; at about a Mile from it, the Land is not so Rich; the Soil
changed to red loom, as deep colour'd as a burnt Brick, wherein the
Grass is poor and the Box Trees small. I am glad to observe that
the deficiency is made up by useful Pine Trees from one Inch to
three feet in Diamiter, as straight as Arrows, some of them at
least 40 feet high before the Branches begin to shoot out; those,
growing on what I term Pine hills, are stinted; the trunks of them
rise but a few feet from the Ground before their Branches spread,
which I think may be accounted for by those hills being chiefly a
Mass of Granite Rock. I asscended the Height; no Country can
possibly have a more interesting aspect; so much so that, if a
further trace into the interior is required at a future period, I
respectfully beg leave to offer myself for the Service. I see no
end of travelling. I am deficient in abilities to describe it
properly, but shall endeavour to do so by compareing the Country to
an Ocean, as it is nearly level, with the Horizon from N.W. to
S.W.; small Hillocks are seen at great distance of a pale Blue,
shewing as Land appears when first discovered at Sea; Spaces clear
of Trees may be imagined Islands, and the Natives Smokes, rising in
various points, vessels; it is a clear calm Evening near
Sunsetting, which shewed every part advantageously. The River I can
distinctly discover to continue near due West, and rest confident
that, when it is full, Boats may go down it in safety; my meaning
of being full is its general height in moderate Seasons, which the
banks shew, about Five feet above the present level; it would then
carry Boats over Trees and Narrows that now obstruct the Passage;
no doubt the Stream connects with Macquarie or some other River
further West; the Channel then sure is of great magnitude; I should
think so to carry off the body of Water that must in time of Floods
cover these very extensive flats.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 5th June.</i>&mdash;Left the River, which I have now
called "<i>The River Lachlan</i>". The Rain has fallen very heavy;
we were completely washed up last Night; it extinguished our Fire,
which made us still more uncomfortable, besides damaging my papers.
I am fearful we shall experience the like this Evening, but have
taken every precaution to prevent it.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 6th June.</i>&mdash;We reached Lime Stone Creek; the
descent was not down so bad a hill as I expected; I cutt off about
6 Miles, and find abundance of Lime Stone more convenient upwards
without going down the Creek at all, by which means a difficult
road is avoided; there is also good Water and fine bottoms of Land,
containing in each from 5 to 10 Acres, surrounded with Lime Stone
Rocks; This is a fine Grazing Country with plenty of Wood.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 7th June.</i>&mdash;The ascent from Lime Stone
Creek is the steepest part in my way; I examined it particularly,
and do not think it near so bad as the Fish River hill. I left the
height, mentioned on the 24th Ulto., about a Mile North of me, and
crossed the flat then spoken of, which is very extensive; it bears
up South for some distance, then bends to the East and S.E. The
Soil is Rich, and well watered by large Ponds; I have named this
place "Warwick Plains".</p>

<p><i>Monday, 12th June.</i>&mdash;Arrived at Bathurst, having
experienced for these last six days extremely cold uncomfortable
Weather, with Misty rain. My journal is short; but have endeavoured
to state every thing as it actually is, in as plain and correct a
manner as I am capable of doing, that it should be clearly
understood by any person, who may hereafter follow my Track.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>V. OXLEY'S EXPLORATION OF THE
LACHLAN</h3>

<blockquote>[JOHN OXLEY's exploration of the Lachlan in 1817, and
of the Macquarie in 1818, revealed for the first time the peculiar
character of the inland rivers, and furnished a more detailed
account of the territory between the rivers than had hitherto been
available. Oxley was greatly puzzled, and in submitting his first
narrative to the public, expressed himself as doubtful whether
Australia, with a surface nearly as extensive as Europe, possessed
rivers which terminated in interior seas, or whether they made
their way to estuaries on the coast. It did not occur to him that
these rivers were part of a great riparian system, that of the
Murray-Darling watershed. This narrative is taken from the
<i>Journals of Two Expeditions into the Interior of New South
Wales*</i>, by Oxley, published at London, 1820.]<br></blockquote>

listing</a>.</b><br>
</p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth of March I received the instructions of his
excellency the Governor to take charge of the expedition which had
been fitted out for the purpose of ascertaining the course of the
Lachlan River, and generally to prosecute the examination of the
western interior of New South Wales.</p>

<p>On the sixth of April I quitted Sydney, and after a pleasant
journey arrived at Bathurst on the fourteenth, and found that our
provisions and other necessary stores were in readiness at the
depot on the Lachlan River. We were detained at Bathurst by rainy
unfavourable weather until the nineteenth, when the morning proving
fine, the BAT horses, with the remainder of the provisions,
baggage, and instruments, were sent off, we intending to follow
them the ensuing morning.</p>

<p>Bathurst had assumed a very different appearance since I first
visited it in the suite of his excellency the Governor in 1815. The
industrious hand of man had been busy in improving the beautiful
works of nature; a good substantial house for the superintendant
had been erected, the government grounds fenced in, and the stack
yards showed that the abundant produce of the last harvest had
amply repaid the labour bestowed on its culture. The fine healthy
appearance of the flocks and herds was a convincing proof how
admirably adapted these extensive downs and thinly wooded hills are
for grazing, more particularly of sheep. The mind dwelt with
pleasure on the idea that at no very distant period these secluded
plains would be covered with flocks bearing the richest fleeces,
and contribute in no small degree to the prosperity of the eastern
settlements.</p>

<p>The soil, in the immediate neighbourhood of Bathurst, is for the
first six inches of a light, black, vegetable mould, lying on a
stratum of sand, about eighteen inches deep, but of a poor
description, and mixed with small stones, under which is a strong
clay. The surface of the hills is covered with small gravel, the
soil light and sandy, with a sub-soil of clay. The low flats on the
immediate borders of the river are evidently formed by washings
from the hills and valleys deposited by floods, and the
overflowings of the watercourses.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, April 20.</i>&mdash;Proceeded on our journey towards
the Lachlan River. At two o'clock we arrived at the head of Queen
Charlotte's Valley, passing through a fine open grazing country;
the soil on the hills and in the vale a light clayey loam,
occasionally intermixed with sand and gravel: the late rains had
rendered the ground soft and boggy. The trees were small and
stunted, and thinly scattered over the hills, which frequently
closed in stony points on the valley. The rocks a coarse
granite.</p>

<p><i>April 25.</i>&mdash;Our course for the first seven or eight
miles was through a level open country, the soil and grass
indifferently good. We now ascended a hill a little to the left of
the road, for the purpose of viewing the country through which the
river ran: it appeared a perfect plain encompassed by moderately
high hills, except in the south-east and west quarters, these being
apparently the points whence and to which the river flows. The
whole country a forest of eucalypti, with occasionally on the banks
of the river a space clear of timber: there was nothing either
grand or interesting in the view from this hill, neither did I see
in any direction such high land as might be expected to give source
to a river of magnitude. When we quitted the hill, we went west, to
make the Lachlan River, passing for nearly six miles over a perfect
level, the land poor, and in places scrubby. At two o'clock saw the
river, which certainly did not disappoint me: it was evidently much
higher than usual, running a strong stream; the banks very steep,
but not so as to render the water inaccessible: the land on each
side quite flat, and thinly clothed with small trees; the soil a
rich light loam: higher points occasionally projected on the river,
and on those the soil was by no means so good. The largest trees
were growing immediately at the water's edge on both sides, and
from their position formed an arch over the river, obscuring it
from observation, although it was from thirty to forty yards
across. At four o'clock we arrived at the depot.</p>

<p>We had scarcely alighted from our horses, when natives were seen
in considerable numbers on the other side of the river. I went down
opposite to them, and after some little persuasion about twenty of
them swam across, having their galengar or stone hatchet in one
hand, which on their landing they threw at our feet, to show us
that they were as much divested of arms as ourselves. After staying
a short time they were presented with some kangaroo flesh, with
which they re-crossed the river, and kindled their fires. They were
very stout and manly, well featured, with long beards: there were a
few cloaks among them made of the opossum skin, and it was evident
that some of the party had been at Bathurst, from their making use
of several English words, and from their readily comprehending many
of our questions.</p>

<p><i>April 26.</i>&mdash;Fine clear warm weather. The natives were
still on the opposite bank, and five of them came over to us in the
course of the morning; but remained a very short time. During the
last night a few fine shrimps were caught; the soldiers stationed
at the depot said they had frequently taken them in considerable
numbers. During the day arranged the loads for the boats and
horses, that they might be enabled to set off early the next
morning.</p>

<p><i>April 27.</i>&mdash;Loaded the boats with as much of the salt
provisions as they could safely carry, and despatched them to wait
at the first creek about seven or eight miles down the river until
the loaded horses came, and then to assist in taking their loads
over the creek; intending myself to follow with the remainder of
the baggage early to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>April 29.</i>&mdash;Proceeded on our journey down the river,
directing the boats to stop at the creek which terminated Mr.
Evans's former journey. The country through which we passed this
day in every respect resembles the tracts we have already gone
over. The crowns and ridges of the hills are uniformly stony and
barren, ending as before alternately on each side of the river; the
greater proportion of good flat land lies on the south side of the
river; there are however very rich and fertile tracts on this side.
After riding about eight miles, we ascended a considerable hill
upon our right, from the top of which we could see to a
considerable distance; between the south-west and north-north-west,
a very low level tract lay west of us, and no hill whatever bounded
the view in that quarter. Three remarkable hummocks bore
respectively S. 72. W., S. 51&frac12; W. and S. 34&frac12; W., within which range
of bearing the country was uniformly level, or rising into such low
hills, as not to be distinguished from the general surface. The
tops of distant ranges could be discerned over low hills in the
north-west, whilst, from north by the east to south, the country
was broken into hill and valley. The whole of this extensive scene
was covered with eucalypti, whilst on the rocky summits of the
hills in the immediate neighbourhood a species of callitris was
eminently distinguished. From this extensive view I named the hill
Mount Prospect.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the afternoon we arrived at the place where
the horses had been directed to wait for the boats, but they had
not arrived; the distance is at least doubled by following the
immediate course of the stream, but I had calculated that its
rapidity would make up for the distance, and enable the boats to
keep pace with the horses.</p>

<p>At six o'clock the boats arrived safe, the men having had a very
fatiguing row, and been obliged to clear the passage of fallen
trees, and other obstructions; so that we determined to give them
some repose, and halt here for the night. At half past eight
o'clock proceeded down the river, intending to stop at the
termination of Mr. Evans's journey in 1815, about five miles
further, for the purpose of repairing the small boat, which had
sustained some slight damage in coming down the river yesterday. I
rode about three miles back into the country; the callitris was
here more frequent, though not of large growth; the soil is not
good. In returning to the river we came upon the creek which
terminated Mr. Evans's journey, down which we travelled until we
came to the river, about half a mile from which is a large shallow
lagoon, full of ducks, bustards, black swans and red-hills. At
twelve o'clock the horses arrived at the mouth of the creek, and
the boats half an hour afterwards. The banks of the creek were very
steep, and it was three o'clock before all the provisions were got
over. The creek was named Byrne's Creek, after one of the present
party, who had accompanied Mr. Evans in his former journey.</p>

<p><i>May 1.</i>&mdash;The creek fell upwards of a foot during the
night, by which some of the articles in the large boat received
damage. Commenced the survey of the river from this point. The
flats on both sides the river were very extensive, and in general
good; the same timber and grass as usual; the stream was from
thirty to forty yards broad on an average.</p>

<p><i>May 2.</i>&mdash;Our journey this day was very fatiguing, the
grass being nearly breast high, thick, and entangled. The soil is
tolerably good within a mile and a half of the banks: I rode five
or six miles out, in hopes of finding some eminence on which to
ascend, but was disappointed, the country continuing a dead level,
with extensive swamps, and barren brushes.</p>

<p><i>May 3.</i>&mdash;Proceeded down the river. We passed over a
very barren desolate country, perfectly level, without even the
slightest eminence, covered with dwarf box-trees and scrubby
bushes; towards the latter part of the day a few small cypresses
were seen. I think the other side of the river is much the same. We
have hitherto met with no water except at the river, and a few
shallow lagoons, which are evidently dry in summer. I do not know
how far this level extends north and south, but I cannot estimate
it at less than from ten to twelve miles on each side; but this is
mere conjecture, since for the last three days I have been unable
to see beyond a mile: I have, however, occasionally made excursions
of five or six miles, and never perceived any difference in the
elevation of the country.</p>

<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;As soon as it was light I sent two men up
the river to search for the boat: at nine o'clock one of them
returned, having found it about four miles back. It appeared that
the large boat had got stoved against a tree under water, and that
the people were obliged to unload and haul her on shore to undergo
some repairs, which they had effected; but the rain prevented them
from paying her bottom. They expected to be able to proceed in an
hour or two, as the weather had begun to clear up. It was fortunate
that no damage had befallen any part of the boat's lading. At
twelve proceeded about three quarters of a mile down the river, and
from a small eminence half a mile north of it, an extensive tract
of clear country was seen, bearing N. 50. W., about two or three
miles from us, having a low range of hills bounding them in the
direction of S. 65. W. and N. 65. E. The river wound immediately
under the hill, taking a westerly direction as far as I went, which
was about three miles; its windings were very sudden, and its width
and depth much the same as before. The country, as far as I could
see, was precisely similar to that already passed over: the hills
were slaty and barren, with a few small cypresses: in fact, I have
seen them grow on no other spots so frequently as on those stony
hills. The boats arrived about two o'clock.</p>

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;Proceeded down the river, ascended the
eminence mentioned yesterday, and from the top of a cypress tree a
very distant view of the whole country was obtained. The country
was in general poor, with partial tracts of better ground; the
hills were slaty, and covered as well as the levels with small
eucalypti, cypresses, and casuarinas. About a mile from this place
we fell in with a small tribe of natives, consisting of eight men;
their women we did not see. They did not appear any way alarmed at
the sight of us, but came boldly up: they were covered with cloaks
made of opossum skins; their faces daubed with a red and yellow
pigment, with neatly worked nets bound round their hair: the front
tooth in the upper row was wanting in them all: they were unarmed,
having nothing with them but their stone hatchets. It appeared from
their conduct that they had either seen or heard of white people
before, and were anxious to depart, accompanying the motion of
going with a wave of their hand.</p>

<p>About three miles from our last night's halting-place we had to
cross a small creek, the banks of which were so steep that we were
obliged to unload the horses. I rode up the creek about three
quarters of a mile, and came upon those extensive plains
before-mentioned; the soil of this level appears a good loamy clay,
but in some places very wet: it was far too extensive to permit us
to traverse much of it; we saw sufficient to judge that the whole
surface was similar to that we examined; it was covered with a
great variety of new plants, and its margin encircled by a new
species of acacia, which received the specific name of
<i>pendula,</i> from its resembling in habit the weeping willow.
Low hills to the north bounded this plain, whilst a slip of barren
land, covered with small trees and shrubs, lay between it and the
river.</p>

<p>It appeared to me that the whole of these flats are occasionally
overflowed by the river, the water of which is forced up the creek
before-mentioned, and which again acts as a drain on the fall of
the water.</p>

<p>At four o'clock we halted for the evening, after a fatiguing
day's journey; the boats were obliged to cut their passage three or
four times, and the whole navigation was difficult and dangerous:
the current ran with much rapidity, and the channel seemed rather
to contract than widen. We were obliged to stop on a very barren
desolate spot, with little grass for the horses; but further on the
country appeared even worse. The south bank of the river (as far as
I could judge) is precisely similar to that which we are travelling
down. The clear levels examined to-day were named the Solway Flats.
Many fish were caught here, one of which weighed upwards of thirty
pounds.</p>

<p><i>May 6.</i>&mdash;Proceeded down the river. It is impossible
to fancy a worse country than the one we were now travelling over,
intersected by swamps and small lagoons in every direction; the
soil a poor clay, and covered with stunted useless timber. It was
excessively fatiguing to the horses which travelled along the banks
of the river, as the rubus and anthistiria were so thickly
intermingled, that they could scarcely force a passage. After
proceeding about eight miles, a bold rocky mount terminated on the
river, and broke the sameness which had so long wearied us: we
ascended this hill, which I named Mount Amyot, and from the summit
had one of the most extensive views that can be imagined. On the
opposite side of the river was another hill precisely similar to
Mount Amyot, leaving a passage between them for the river, and the
immense tract of level country to the eastward; this hill was named
Mount Stuart. Vast plains clear of timber lay on the south side of
the river, and which, from our having travelled on a level with
them, it was impossible for us to distinguish before. These plains
I named Hamilton's Plains, and they were bounded by hills of
considerable elevation to the southward; whilst the whole level
country thus bounded was honoured with the designation of Princess
Charlotte's Crescent.</p>

<p>To the west of Mount Amyot the view was equally extensive, being
bounded only by the horizon; some high detached hills, rising like
islands from the ocean, broke, in some measure, the sameness of the
prospect. I estimated that in the west north-west I could see at
least forty miles, and in the south south-west as far; the view in
other points being slightly interrupted by low ranges of hills,
rising occasionally to points of considerable elevation: none of
those elevated spots was nearer than twenty-five or thirty miles,
and considerable spaces of clear ground could, by the assistance of
the telescope, be distinguished, interspersed amidst the ocean of
trees whence those hills arise: a long broken mountain, bearing W.
32&frac12; N., was named Mount Melville; one W. 24. N. Mount Cunningham;
and another, bearing S. 70. W. Mount Maude. Smoke, arising from the
fires of the wandering inhabitants of these desolate regions was
seen in several quarters. At four o'clock we stopped for the
evening, about three miles west of Mount Amyot.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe that the whole of the tract named
Princess Charlotte's Crescent is at times drowned by the
overflowing of the river; the marks of flood were observed in every
direction, and the waters in the marshes and lagoons were all
traced as being derived from the river. During a course of upwards
of seventy miles not a single running stream emptied itself into
the river on either side; and I am forced to conclude that in
common seasons this whole tract is extremely badly watered, and
that it derives its principal if not only supply from the river
within the bounding ranges of Princess Charlotte's Crescent. There
are doubtless many small eminences which might afford a retreat
from the inundations, but those which were observed by us were too
trifling and distant from each other to stand out distinct from the
vast level surface which the crescent presents to the view. The
soil of the country we passed over was a poor and cold clay; but
there are many rich levels which, could they be drained and
defended from the inundations of the river, would amply repay the
cultivation. These flats are certainly not adapted for cattle; the
grass is too swampy, and the bushes, swamps, and lagoons, are too
thickly intermingled with the better portions to render it either a
safe or desirable grazing country. The timber is universally bad
and small; a few large misshapen gum trees on the immediate banks
of the river may be considered as exceptions. If however the
country itself is poor, the river is rich in the most excellent
fish, procurable in the utmost abundance. One man in less than an
hour caught eighteen large fish, one of which was a curiosity from
its immense size, and the beauty of its colours. In shape and
general form it most resembled a cod, but was speckled over with
brown, blue, and yellow spots, like a leopard's skin; its gills and
belly a clear white, the tail and fins a dark brown. It weighed
entire seventy pounds, and without the entrails sixty-six pounds:
it is somewhat singular that in none of these fish is any thing
found in the stomach, except occasionally a shrimp or two.</p>

<p><i>May 8.</i>&mdash;Proceeded down the river. Our general course
was westerly, and the country, though equally level with any we had
passed, improved in the quality of the soil, which, during the
greater part of to-day's route, was a good vegetable mould, the
land thickly covered with small acacia and dwarf trees. The banks
of the river were, I think, much lower, not exceeding fifteen or
twenty feet high, and they were rather clearer of timber than
before. The casuarina, which used to line the banks, was now seldom
seen, the acacia pendula seeming to take its place. We stopped for
the night on a plain of good land, flooded, but clear of timber:
large flocks of emus were feeding on it, and we were fortunate
enough to kill a very large one after a fine chase. At three
o'clock, the boats not having arrived, I sent a man back to look
for them; at eight he returned, having found them about six miles
up the river, unable to proceed until morning, having met with
continual interruptions from fallen trees. These impediments in the
navigation of the river obstruct our progress very materially, and
its windings continue so great and frequent, that the distance
travelled by land is nearly trebled by water.</p>

<p><i>May 9.</i>&mdash;The boats not having arrived at ten o'clock,
Mr. Evans proceeded with the BAT horses another stage down the
river. Mr. Cunningham and I waited to bring up the boats, which
shortly afterwards came in sight. We proceeded to join the horses,
which we did about five o'clock, the boats having gone in that time
nearly thirty-six miles, although the distance from the last
station did not exceed seven in a direct line.</p>

<p>The country we had passed through during this day's route was
extremely low, consisting of extensive plains divided by lines of
small trees: the banks of the river, and the deep bights formed by
the irregularity of its course, were covered with acacia bushes and
dwarf trees. The river, at the spot where we stopped, wound along
the edge of an extensive low plain, being at least six miles long
and three or four broad; these I called Field's Plains, after the
judge of the supreme court of this territory; they are the same
which we saw from the top of Mount Amyot. The soil of these plains
is a light clayey loam, very wet in many places; they were fringed
round with that beautiful tree, the acacia pendula, which here
seems to perform the part of the willow in Europe; the cypresses
were also more frequent, and the banks of the river much lower than
even those we passed yesterday. I cannot help thinking that the
whole of this extensive region has been at some time or other under
water, and that the present river is the drain by which the waters
have been conveyed to lower grounds. It is evident that even now
the plains (on those parts clear of trees) are frequently under
water, and that at very high floods the wooded lands are so too,
for it is almost impossible to distinguish any difference in their
elevation; but the wooded lands, from being actually higher, seem
to have given time for the growth of the diminutive timber with
which they are covered, whereas the lower plains are too frequently
covered to give time for such growth.</p>

<p><i>May 10.</i>&mdash;The horses having strayed in the night, and
it being nearly noon before they were found, I determined to make
this a halting day.</p>

<p>These plains are much more extensive than I supposed yesterday,
and many new plants were found on them. The river rose upwards of a
foot during the night, and still continues to rise; a circumstance
which appears very singular to me, there having been no rains of
any magnitude for the last five weeks, and none at all for the last
ten days. We are also certain that no waters fall into it or join
it easterly for nearly one hundred and fifty miles. This rise must
therefore be occasioned by heavy rains in the mountains, whence the
river derives its source; but it is not the less singular, that
during its whole course, as far as it is hitherto known, it does
not receive a single tributary stream. Observed the latitude 33.
16. 33. S.</p>

<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;The river rose about four feet during the
night, and still continues to rise. Set forward on our journey down
the river. About four miles and a half from this morning's station,
the river began to wash the immediate edge of the plain, and so
continued to do all along. My astonishment was extreme at finding
the banks of the river not more than six feet from the water: it at
once confirmed my supposition that the whole of this extensive
country is frequently inundated; the river was here about thirty
yards broad. The soil of these extensive plains, designated Field's
Plains, is for the most part extremely rich, as indeed might be
expected, from the deposition of the quantities of vegetable matter
that must take place in periods of flood.</p>

<p><i>May 12.</i>&mdash;The fine weather still continues to favour
us. The river rose in the course of the night upwards of a foot. It
is a probable supposition that the natives, warned by experience of
these dangerous flats, rather choose to seek a more precarious, but
more safe subsistence in the mountainous and rocky ridges which are
occasionally to be met with. The river and lagoons abound with fish
and fowl, and it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that the natives
would not avail themselves of such store of food, if the danger of
procuring it did not counterbalance the advantages they might
otherwise derive from such abundance.</p>

<p>About three quarters of a mile farther westward we had to cross
another small arm of the river, running to the northward, which
although now full, is, I should think, dry when the river is at its
usual level. It is probable that this and the one which we first
crossed join each other a few miles farther to the westward, and
then both united fall into the stream which gave them existence. We
had scarcely proceeded a mile from the last branch, before it
became evident that it would be impossible to advance farther in
the direction in which we were travelling. The stream here
overflowed both banks, and its course was lost among marshes: its
channel not being distinguishable from the surrounding waters.</p>

<p>Observing an eminence about half a mile from the south side, we
crossed over the horses and baggage at a Place where the water was
level with the banks, and which when within its usual channel did
not exceed thirty or forty feet in width, its depth even now being
only twelve feet.</p>

<p>We ascended the hill, and had the mortification to perceive the
termination of our research, at least down this branch of the
river: the whole country from the west north-west round to north
was either a complete marsh or lay under water, and this for a
distance of twenty-five or thirty miles, in those directions; to
the south and south-west the country appeared more elevated, but
low marshy grounds lay between us and it, which rendered it
impossible for us to proceed thither from our present situation. I
therefore determined to return back to the place where the two
branches of the principal river separated, and follow the
south-west branch as far as it should be navigable; our fears were
however stronger than our hopes, lest it would end in a similar
manner to the one we had already traced, until it became no longer
navigable for boats.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this intention we descended the hill, which was
named Farewell Hill, from its being the termination of our journey
in a north-west direction at least for the present, and proceeded
up the south bank of the stream. We were able to reach only a short
distance from the spot where we stopped last night, having been
obliged to unload the horses no less than four times in the course
of the day, added to which, the travelling loaded through those
dreadful marshes had completely exhausted them: my own horse, in
searching for a better track, was nearly lost, and it consumed four
hours to advance scarcely half a mile.</p>

<p>My disappointment at the interruption of our labours in this
quarter was extreme, and what was worse, no flattering prospect
appeared of our succeeding better in the examination of the
south-west branch. I was however determined to see the present end
of the river in all its branches, before I should finally quit it,
in furtherance of the other objects of the expedition.</p>

<p><i>May 13.</i>&mdash;Returned to the point whence the river
separates into two branches; intending first to descend the
south-west branch for some distance before the boats and baggage
should move down, being unwilling the horses should undergo an
useless fatigue in traversing such marshy ground, unless the branch
should prove of sufficient magnitude to take us a considerable
distance; conceiving it an object of the first importance that the
horses should start fresh, if I should find it necessary to quit
the river at this point of the coast.</p>

<p><i>May 14.</i>&mdash;My present intention is to take a
south-west direction for Cape Northumberland, since should any
river be formed from those marshes, which is extremely probable,
and fall into the sea between Spencer's Gulf and Cape Otway, this
course will intersect it, and no river or stream can arise from
these swamps without being discovered. The body of water now
running in both the principal branches is very considerable, fully
sufficient to have constituted a river of magnitude, if it had
constantly maintained such a supply of water, and had not become
separated into branches, and lost among the immense marshes of this
desolate and barren country, which seems here to form a vast
concavity to receive them. It is impossible to arrive at any
certain opinion as to what finally becomes of these waters, but I
think it probable, from the appearance of the country, and its
being nearly on a level with the sea, that they are partly absorbed
by the soil, and the remainder lost by evaporation.</p>

<p><i>May 18.</i>&mdash;At nine o'clock we commenced our journey
towards the coast; at three stopped within four miles of Mount
Maude, on a dry creek, with occasional pools of very indifferent
water. The country through which we passed from the branch was for
the first three miles very low and wet, with large lagoons of
water. During the latter part of the journey the country was more
elevated though still level, the soil light and rotten, and overrun
with the acacia pendula. The horses being very heavily laden fell
repeatedly during the early part of the day. Our course was nearly
south-west, and we performed about ten miles.</p>

<p><i>June 14.</i>&mdash;Fine clear weather. Proceeded on our
journey northwards: the first four or five miles was over a rocky
broken country, consisting of low hills, rising westerly of Peel's
range. After going about six miles and a half the country became
more open and less rocky; as the grass was here better than at our
last night's halting-place, and the water convenient and tolerable,
we resolved upon stopping, particularly as I intended resting the
horses to-morrow; and I was fearful if I proceeded farther I might
meet with neither, and thus be obliged to continue travelling
to-morrow; an exertion which the horses were not in a condition to
make. Nothing can be more irksome than the tedious days' journeys
we are obliged to make through a country in which there is not the
smallest variety, each day's occurrences and scenes being but a
recapitulation of the former: our patience would frequently be
exhausted, were we not daily reanimating ourselves with the hopes
that the morrow will bring us to a better country, and render a
journey, the labour of which has hitherto been ill repaid, of some
service to the colony, and of some satisfaction to the expectations
which had been formed of its result.</p>

<p><i>June 23.</i>&mdash;After going eight miles and a quarter, we
suddenly came upon the banks of the river; I call it the river, for
it could certainly be no other than the Lachlan, which we had
quitted nearly five weeks before. Our astonishment was extreme,
since it was an incident little expected by any one. It was here
extremely diminished in size, but was still nearly equal in
magnitude to the south-west branch which we last quitted. The banks
were about twelve or fourteen feet above the water, and it was
running with a tolerably brisk stream to the westward. The banks
were so thickly covered with large eucalypti, that we did not
perceive it until we were within a very few yards of it; it
appeared about thirty feet broad, running over a sandy bottom. I
think it extremely probable that the waters of both the main
branches, after losing a very considerable portion over the low
grounds in the neighbourhood of Mount Cunningham and Field's
Plains, have again united and formed the present stream.</p>

<p>Our future course did not admit of any hesitation, and it was
resolved to go down the stream as long as there was a chance of its
becoming more considerable, and until our provisions should be so
far expended as barely to enable us to return to Bathurst.</p>

<p>It is a singular phenomenon in the history of this river, that,
in a course of upwards of two hundred and fifty miles, in a direct
line from where Mr. Evans first discovered it, not the smallest
rivulet, or, in fact, water of any description, falls into it from
either the north or south; with the exception of the two small
occasional streams near the depot, which flow from the north.</p>

<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;The first two or three miles were somewhat
harder travelling than the greater part of yesterday. Immense
plains extended to the westward, as far as the eye could reach.
These plains were entirely barren, being evidently in times of rain
altogether under water, when they doubtless form one vast lake:
they extended in places from three to six miles from the margin of
the stream, which on its immediate borders was a wet bog, full of
small water holes, and the surface covered with marsh plants, with
a few straggling dwarf box-trees. It was only on the very edge of
the bank, and in the bottoms of the bights, that any eucalypti
grew; the plains were covered with nothing but gnaphalium: the soil
various, in some places red tenacious clay, in others a dark
hazel-coloured loam, so rotten and full of holes that it was with
difficulty the horses could travel over them. Although those plains
were bounded only by the horizon, not a semblance of a hill
appeared in the distance; we seemed indeed to have taken a long
farewell of every thing like an elevation, whence the surrounding
country could be observed. To the southward, bounding those plains
in that direction, barren scrubs and dwarf box-trees, with
numberless holes of stagnant water, too clearly proclaimed the
nature of the country in that quarter. We could see through the
openings of the trees on the river that plains of similar extent
occupied the other side, which has all along appeared to us to be
(if any thing) the lower ground. We travelled in the centre of the
plains, our medium distance from the river being from one to two
miles; and although we did not go above thirteen miles, some of the
horses were excessively distressed from the nature of the
ground.</p>

<p>There was not the least appearance of natives; nor was bird or
animal of any description seen during the day, except a solitary
native dog. Nothing can be more melancholy and irksome than
travelling over wilds, which nature seems to have condemned to
perpetual loneliness and desolation. We seemed indeed the sole
living creatures in those vast deserts.</p>

<p>The plains last travelled over were named Molle's Plains, after
the late lieutenant-governor of the territory; and those on the
opposite side, Baird's Plains, after the general to whom he once
acted as aide-de-camp, and whose glory he shared. The naming of
places was often the only pleasure within our reach; but it was
some relief from the desolation of these plains and hills to throw
over them the associations of names dear to friendship, or sacred
to genius.</p>

<p><i>July 5.</i>&mdash;Our route lay over the same unvarying plain
surface as on the preceding days, and after travelling about five
miles, we again saw the line of trees growing on the banks of the
stream; and having performed about ten miles more, we halted on the
immediate banks of it. These were considerably lower, being about
six feet above the water; the current was almost imperceptible, and
the depth did not exceed four feet, and was extremely muddy; the
trees growing on the banks were neither so large nor so numerous as
before, and a new species of eucalyptus prevailed over the old blue
gum. The north-east side was precisely of the same description of
country as the south-east. A very large sheet of water or lake lay
on the north-west side, opposite to the place where we made the
river. The horizon was clear and distinct round the whole circle,
the line of trees on the river alone excepted. From the marks on
these trees, the waters appear to rise about three feet above the
level of the bank; a height more than sufficient to inundate the
whole country. This stream is certainly in the summer season, or in
the long absence of rain, nothing more than a mere chain of ponds,
serving as a channel to convey the waters from the eastward over
this low tract. It is certain that no waters join this river from
its source to this point; and passing, as it does, for the most
part, through a line of country so low as to be frequently
overflowed, and to an extent north and south perfectly unknown, but
certainly at this place exceeding forty miles, it must cause the
country to remain for ever uninhabitable, and useless for all the
purposes of civilized man.</p>

<p>These considerations, added to the state of our provisions, of
which, at the reduced ration of three pounds of flour per man per
week, we had but ten weeks remaining, determined me to proceed no
farther westward with the main part of the expedition; but as the
state of the greater part of our horses was such as absolutely to
require some days' rest and refreshment, before we attempted to
return eastward, I considered that it would be acting best up to
the spirit of my instructions to proceed forward myself with three
men and horses, and as we should carry nothing with us but our
provisions, we should be enabled to proceed with so much
expedition, as to go as far and see as much in three days as would
take the whole party at least seven to perform.</p>

<p>My object in thus proceeding farther was to get so far to the
westward as to place beyond all question the impossibility of a
river falling into the sea between Cape Otway and Cape Bernouilli.
In my opinion, the very nature of the country altogether precludes
such a possibility, but I think my proceeding so far will be
conclusive with those who have most strongly imbibed the conviction
that a river enters the sea between the Capes in question, which
was certainly an idea I also had entertained, and which nothing but
the survey of a country, without either hills or permanent streams,
could have destroyed.</p>

<p>I must observe as a remarkable feature in this singular country,
that for the last fifty miles we have not seen a stone or pebble of
any kind, save two, and they were taken out of the maws of two
emus. I am now firmly persuaded that there are no eminent grounds
in this part of the country, until these low sandy hills* which
bound the south-western coast-line are reached; and these, in my
judgment, are the only barriers which prevent the ocean from
extending its empire over a country which was probably once under
its dominion.</p>

<p class="foot">[* Note: From Encounter Bay to this slight
projection (Cape Bernouilli), the coast is little else than a bank
of sand, with a few hummocks on the top, partially covered with
small vegetation, nor could any thing in the interior country be
distinguished above the bank. Flinders' Voy. Vol. I. p. 197.]</p>

<p><i>July 7.</i>&mdash;At eight o'clock, taking with me three men,
I proceeded to follow the course of the stream; I attempted in the
first instance to keep away from the banks, but was soon obliged to
join them, as the morasses extended outwards and intersected my
proposed course in almost every direction. About three miles and a
half from the tent, a large arm extended from the north bank to a
considerable distance on that side; the banks continually getting
lower, and before we had gone six miles it was evident that the
channel of the stream was only the bed of a lagoon, the current now
being imperceptible, with small gum trees growing in the middle.
Three miles farther the morasses closed upon us, and rendered all
farther progress impossible. The water was here stagnant. The large
trees that used to be met with in such numbers up the stream were
entirely lost, a few diminutive gums being the only timber to be
seen: the height of the bank from the water-line was three feet six
inches; and the marks of floods on the trunks of the trees rose to
the height of four feet six inches, being about one foot above the
level of the surrounding marshes. It would appear that the water is
frequently stationary at that height for a considerable time, as
long moss and other marks of stagnant waters were remaining on the
trunks and roots of the trees, and on the long-leaved acacia, which
was here a strong plant. There could not be above three feet water
in this part of the lagoon, as small bushes and tufts of tea grass
were perceptible. The water was extremely muddy, and the odour
arising from the banks and marshes was offensive in the extreme.
There were only four different kinds of plants at this terminating
point of our journey, viz. the small eucalyptus, the long-leaved
acacia, the large tea grass, and a new diaeceous plant which
covered the marshes, named polygonum junceum. It is possible that
the bed of the lagoon might extend eight or ten miles farther, but
I do not think it did, as the horizon was perfectly clear in all
directions, a few bushes and acacia trees, marking the course of
the lagoon, excepted.</p>

<p>Had there been any hill or even small eminence within thirty or
forty miles of me they must now have been discovered, but there was
not the least appearance of any such, and it was with infinite
regret and pain that I was forced to come to the conclusion, that
the interior of this vast country is a marsh and uninhabitable. How
near these marshes may approach the south-western coast, I know
not; but I do not think that the range of high and dry land in that
quarter extends back north-easterly for any great distance; it
being known, that the coast from Cape Bernouilli to the head of
Spencer's Gulf is sandy and destitute of water.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no river, the history of which is known, that
presents so remarkable a termination as the present: its course in
a straight line from its source to its termination exceeds five
hundred miles, and including its windings, it may fairly be
calculated to run at least twelve hundred miles; during all which
passage, through such a vast extent of country, it does not receive
a single stream in addition to what it derives from its sources in
the eastern mountains.</p>

<p>I think it a probable conjecture that this river is the channel
by which all the waters rising in those ranges of hills to the
westward of Port Jackson, known by the name of the Blue Mountains,
and which do not fall into the sea on the east coast, are conveyed
to these immense inland marshes; its sinuous course causing it to
overflow its banks on a much higher level than the present, and in
consequence, forming those low wet levels which are in the very
neighbourhood of the government depot. Its length of course is, in
my opinion, the principal cause of our finding any thing like a
stream for the last one hundred miles, as the immense body of water
which must undoubtedly be at times collected in such a river must
find a vent somewhere, but being spent during so long a course
without any accession, the only wonder is, that even those waters
should cause a current at so great a distance from their source;
everything however indicates, as before often observed, that in dry
seasons the channel of the river is empty, or forms only a chain of
ponds. It appears to have been a considerable length of time since
the banks were overflowed, certainly not for the last year; and I
think it probable they are not often so: the quantity of water must
indeed be immense, and of long accumulation, in the upper marshes,
before the whole of this vast country can be under water.</p>

<p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;At eight o'clock we proceeded towards
Bathurst, hoping to reach it by the evening; this we effected
between eight and nine o'clock, passing over a very hilly country
with numerous running streams, joining the river near Pine Hill,
and afterwards keeping along its banks.</p>

MACQUARIE</h3>

<blockquote>[This Journal was included in Oxley's book of
1820*.]</blockquote>

</p>

<p><i>May 20, 1818.</i> Having received his Excellency the
Governor's instructions for the conduct of the expedition intended
to examine the course of the Macquarie River, and every preparation
having been made at the depot in Wellington Valley for that
purpose, I quitted Sydney in company with Dr. Harris (late of the
102nd foot), and after a pleasant journey, arrived at Bathurst on
the 25th. Our little arrangements having been completed by the
28th, we again set forward with the baggage horses and men that
were to compose the expedition.</p>

<p>We at first kept nearly upon the track pursued by us on our
return from the first expedition in August last; but on approaching
Wellington Valley, keeping a little more to the westward, we
avoided much of that steep and rugged road which we then complained
of; the country being quite open, the valleys and flats good, the
hills limestone rock. We did not meet with the slightest
interruption, and arrived at the depot on the 2nd of June, where we
found the boats, etc. in perfect readiness for our immediate
reception.</p>

<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;Proceeded down the river about four miles,
when the boats were finally laden. The river in Wellington Valley
had been swelled by the late rains, insomuch that the water below
its junction with the Macquarie was quite discoloured. From the
fineness of the soil, the rain had made the ground very soft,
rendering it difficult for the horses to travel.</p>

<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;Proceeded on our journey, both boats and
horses being very heavily laden with our stores and provisions. The
river rose but little. Our day's journey lay generally over an open
forest country, with rich flats on either side of the river: high
rocky limestone hills ended occasionally in abrupt points, obliging
the horses to make considerable detours. The hills were very stony,
and so light was the soil upon them, that the rain rendered the
ground very soft. The river had many fine reaches, extending in
straight lines from one to three miles, and of a corresponding
breadth. The rapids, although frequent, offered no material
obstruction to the boats. The current in the long reaches was
scarcely perceptible, and it appears to me that the difference of
elevation between this station and the last is not
considerable.</p>

<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;The river expanded into beautiful reaches,
having great depth of water, and from two to three hundred feet
broad, literally covered with water-fowl of different kinds: the
richest flats bordered the river, apparently more extensive on the
south side. The vast body of water which this river must contain in
times of flood is confined within exterior banks, and its
inundations are thus deprived of mischief. About six miles down the
river, a freestone hill ended on the north side of the river: I
mention this, as the only stone of that description I had yet seen.
The trees were of the eucalyptus (apple tree), and on the hills a
few of the callitris macrocarpa* were seen: the trees would furnish
large and useful timber.</p>

<p class="foot">[* Note: Callitr. Vent decad.]</p>

<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;The country this day was as various as can
be imagined; low but not level; in some places covered with the
acacia pendula, chenopodeae, and polygonum juncium; in others, with
good gum and box trees. The whole, with few exceptions, appeared
liable to flood. Four or five miles back the country imperceptibly
rises, and is free from river floods; but the hollows, proceeding
from the inequalities of its surface, are in rainy seasons the
reservoirs of the land floods. The whole country was now perfectly
dry, and must have been so for a long period: it would indeed have
been impossible, had the season been wet, to have kept company with
the boats. The river itself continues undiminished, and is a fine
stream, with nothing to impede the navigation; its windings,
however, are very considerable.</p>

<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;After making every arrangement that we
could devise to ensure our keeping company with the boats, we
proceeded down the river. Our progress was, however, interrupted
much sooner than I anticipated; for we had scarcely gone six miles,
and never nearer to the river than from one to two miles, when we
perceived that the waters which had overflowed the banks were
spreading over the plains on which we were travelling, and that
with a rapidity which precluded any hope of making the river again
to the north-west by north, in which direction we imagined it to
run for some distance, when its course appeared to take a more
northerly direction. Our situation did not admit of hesitation as
to the steps we were to pursue. Our journey had, in fact, been
continued longer than strict prudence would have warranted, and the
safety of the whole party was now at stake: no retreat presented
itself except the station we left in the morning, and even there it
was impossible that we could, with any regard to prudence, remain
longer than to carry the arrangements which I had in contemplation
into effect. The horses were therefore ordered back, and two men
succeeded, after wading through the water to the middle, in making
the river about three miles below the place they set out from.
Fortunately the boats had not proceeded so far, and on their coming
up were directed to return. The boats arrived at sunset, having had
to pull against a strong current. The river itself continued, as
usual, from fifteen to twenty-five feet deep, the waters which were
overflowing the plains being carried thither by a multitude of
little streams, which had their origin in the present increased
height of the waters above their usual level. The river continued
undiminished, and presented too important a body of water to allow
me to believe that those marshes and low grounds had any material
effect in diffusing and absorbing it: its ultimate termination,
therefore, must be more consonant to its magnitude. These
reflections on the present undiminished state of the river would of
themselves have caused me to pause before I hastily quitted a
pursuit from the issue of which so much had naturally been
expected. For all practical purposes, the nature of the country
precluded me from indulging the hope, that even if the river should
terminate in an inland sea, it could be of the smallest use to the
colony. The knowledge of its actual termination, if at all
attainable, was, however, a matter of deep importance, and would
tend to throw some light on the obscurity in which the interior of
this vast country is still involved. My ardent desire to
investigate as far as possible this interesting question,
determined me to take the large boat, and with four volunteers to
proceed down the river as long as it continued navigable; a due
regard being had to the difficulties we should have to contend with
in returning against the stream. I calculated that this would take
me a month; at all events, I determined to be provided for that
period, which indeed was the very utmost that could be spared from
the ulterior object of the expedition.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;I proceeded down the river, during one of
the wettest and most stormy days we had yet experienced. About
twenty miles from where I set out, there was, properly speaking, no
country; the river overflowing its banks, and dividing into streams
which I found had no permanent separation from the main branch, but
united themselves to it on a multitude of points. We went seven or
eight miles farther, when we stopped for the night upon a space of
ground scarcely large enough to enable us to kindle a fire. The
principal stream ran with great rapidity, and its banks and
neighbourhood, as far as we could see, were covered with wood,
encreasing us within a margin or bank. Vast spaces of country clear
of timber were under water, and covered with the common reed,*
which grew to the height of six or seven feet above the surface.
The course and distance by the river was estimated to be from
twenty-seven to thirty miles, on a north-north-west line.</p>

<p class="foot">[* Note: Arundo phragmites. Linn.]</p>

<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;Towards the morning the storm abated, and
at daylight we proceeded on our voyage. The main bed of the river
was much contracted, but very deep, the waters spreading to the
depth of a foot or eighteen inches over the banks, but all running
on the same point of bearing. We met with considerable interruption
from fallen timber, which in places nearly choked up the channel.
After going about twenty miles, we lost the land and trees: the
channel of the river, which lay through reeds, and was from one to
three feet deep, ran northerly. This continued for three or four
miles farther, when although there had been no previous change in
the breadth, depth, and rapidity of the stream for several miles,
and I was sanguine in my expectations of soon entering the long
sought for Australian sea, it all at once eluded our farther
pursuit by spreading on every point from north-west to north-east,
among the ocean of reeds which surrounded us, still running with
the same rapidity as before. There, was no channel whatever among
those reeds, and the depth varied from three to five feet. This
astonishing change (for I cannot call it a termination of the
river), of course left me no alternative but to endeavour to return
to some spot, on which we could effect a landing before dark. I
estimated that during this day we had gone about twenty-four miles,
on nearly the same point of bearing as yesterday. To assert
positively that we were on the margin of the lake or sea into which
this great body of water is discharged, might reasonably be deemed
a conclusion which has nothing but conjecture for its basis; but if
an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances,
mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity
of an inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually
filling up by immense depositions from the higher lands, left by
the waters which flow into it. It is most singular, that the
high-lands on this continent seem to be confined to the sea-coast,
or not to extend to any great distance from it.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>VII. EVANS'S DISCOVERY OF THE
CASTLEREAGH</h3>

<blockquote>[This narrative is embodied in Oxley's
"Journals"*.]<br></blockquote>

</p>

<p><i>July 18</i>, 1818.&mdash;In the evening Mr. Evans returned,
after an interesting though disagreeable journey. His horses were
completely worn out by the difficulties of the country they had
travelled over. His report decided me as to the steps that were now
to be pursued; and I determined on making nearly an easterly course
to the river which he had discovered, and which was now honoured
with the name of Lord Castlereagh. This route would take us over a
drier country, and the river being within a short distance of
Arbuthnot's range, would enable me to examine from those elevated
points the country to the north-east and east; and to decide how
far it might be advisable to trace the river, which it is my
present inclination to do as long as its course continues to the
eastward of north.</p>

<p><i>July 27.</i>&mdash;This morning the weather cleared up just
in time to enable us to retreat to the river banks in safety, for
we were washed out of the tent. The provisions and heavy baggage
were carried by the people to a firmer spot of ground, at which
place the horses being lightly laden, we got every thing
transported to the river by one o'clock. Castlereagh River is
certainly a stream of great magnitude; its channel is divided by
numerous islands covered with trees: it measured in its narrowest
part one hundred and eighty yards, and the flood that had now risen
in it was such as to preclude any attempt to cross it. The outer
banks were good firm land, apparently free from floods, and
extending not more on this side than a quarter of a mile, when it
became wet and marshy: the banks were twelve to seventeen feet
high, and gradually sloped to the water. The trees on this firm
margin of land were a species of eucalyptus, cypresses, and the
sterculia heterophylla, with a few camarinae. This river doubtless
discharges itself into that interior gulf, in which the waters of
the Macquarie are merged: to that river it is in no respect
inferior, and when the banks are full, the body of water in it must
be even still more considerable. Towards evening I thought the
waters were falling, which was an event we anxiously looked for, to
enable us to proceed to Arbuthnot's Range, from the heights of
which we hoped for an interesting view. Natives appear to be
numerous; the guniahs (or bark-huts) are in every direction, and by
their fireplaces several muscle-shells of the same kind as those
found on the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers were seen. Game
(kangaroos and emus), frequenting the dry banks of the river, were
procured in abundance.</p>

<p><i>July 28.</i>&mdash;The river during the night had risen
upwards of eight feet, and still continued rising with surprising
rapidity, running at the rate of from five to six miles per hour,
bringing down with it great quantities of driftwood and other
wreck. The islands were all deeply covered, and the whole scene was
peculiarly grand and interesting. The sudden rise probably was
caused by the heavy rains of the preceding days; but great must be
the sources from whence so stupendous a body of water is supplied,
and equally grand must be that reservoir, which is capable of
containing such an accumulation of water as is derived from this
and the Macquarie Rivers; not to mention t he supplies from the
occasional streams which had their sources in the marshes which we
have crossed. The water was so extremely thick and turbid, that we
could not use it; but were forced to send back to the marshes for
what we wanted. At night, the river seemed at its greatest
height.</p>

<p><i>July 29.</i>&mdash;The waters this day subsided rapidly. It
is evident that there has been no flood in the river for a very
considerable period prior to the present one, there being no marks
of wreck or rubbish on the trees or banks. Now the quantity of
matter is astonishing, and such as must take some years to remove.
The rapid rise and fall in the water would seem to indicate that
neither its source nor its embouchure can be at any great distance.
The former is probably not far east of Arbuthnot's Range.</p>

<p><i>August 2.</i>&mdash;It was not until this morning that the
river had fallen sufficiently to allow us to ford it.</p>

<p><i>August 3.</i>.&mdash;A dark cloudy morning. At nine o'clock
proceeded on our eastern course towards Arbuthnot's Range. The
river had risen in the night so considerably, that had we delayed
until this morning, we should have been unable to pass it. The rain
had rendered the ground so extremely soft and boggy, that we found
it impossible to proceed above three-quarters of a mile on our
eastern course. We therefore returned, resolving to keep close to
the river's edge, until we should be enabled to sound the vein of
quagmire, with which we appeared to be hemmed in. In this attempt
we were equally unfortunate, the horses falling repeatedly: one
rolled into the river, and it was with difficulty we saved him: my
baggage was on him, and was entirely spoiled; the chartcase and
charts were materially damaged, and our spare thermometer broken:
we therefore unladed the horses where they stood, and the men
carried the provisions to a firmer spot, where they were reladen.
We again proceeded easterly, and for upwards of a mile we travelled
up to our knees in water and mud: the horses were here stopped by
running waters from the marshes, encircling a spot of comparatively
dry ground; they were again unladen, and with the utmost difficulty
we got every thing safe over. Both men and horses were so much
exhausted by the constant labour they had undergone, that I
determined to halt, in order to restore our baggage to some order.
Our ardent hopes are fixed upon the high lands of Arbuthnot's
Range, which I estimate to be about twenty miles off. The
intermediate country, we fear, will be one continued morass.</p>

<p><i>August 4.</i>&mdash;Proceeded on our journey. In the seven
miles and a half which we accomplished to-day, the water and bog
were pretty equally divided, and a plain covered with the former
was a great relief both to men and horses, since an apparently dry
brush, or forest, was found a certain forerunner of quicksands and
bogs. The natives appear pretty numerous: one was very daring,
maintaining his ground at a distance armed with a formidable jagged
spear and club, which he kept beating against each other, making
the most singular gestures and noises that can be imagined: he
followed us upwards of a mile, when he left us, joining several
companions to the right of us. Emus and kangaroos abound, and there
is a great diversity of birds, some of which have the most
delightful notes, particularly the thrush.</p>

EXPLORATIONS</h3>

<blockquote>[ALLAN CUNNINGHAM contributed the following account of
his explorations to the <i>Geographical Journal</i>,
1832.]<br></blockquote>

<p>Amidst the ardour with which geographical research has been
patronized and prosecuted in almost every other portion of the
globe, it is a subject of surprise and regret that so little
anxiety should have been shown by geographers, and even by men of
science in general, to increase our knowledge of the interior of
the Australian continent. But so it is,&mdash;that land of
anomalies may still be said to be almost a terra incognita; and,
limited as may be the information which we possess of its internal
features yet, with the conviction that some concise notice of the
way in which that knowledge has been progressively acquired will
not prove altogether uninteresting to the Geographical Society, I
beg to lay before it, in a brief view, the results of the several
expeditions which have been employed in inland discovery since the
first settlement was formed at Port Jackson; to which I have added,
a few occasional remarks on the different routes which have been
pursued, and which will be further illustrated by the accompanying
map.</p>

<p>To that fine settlement, in whose internal prosperity and
advancement I have, during my long residence among its inhabitants,
ever felt a lively interest, I shall consider myself as having
rendered no small service, if what may appear in the following
pages should induce this society to promote, by such means as it
may have at command, the more extensive examination of the interior
of New South Wales. We possess colonies, on its eastern and western
shores, which are daily exciting more and more interest in this
country; and, should the tide of emigration continue to flow, as it
has done for some years past, new land must be thrown open to meet
the wants of the settlers.</p>

<br>
<b>CUNNINGHAM'S ROUTE, APRIL-MAY-JUNE, 1823</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>Up to that period (1819), the colonists knew nothing of the
southern country, beyond the cow-pastures, where that extensive
patch of thicket, called the "Bargo-brush", formed a boundary,
which had not been penetrated. At length, about this time, both
that and the Wombatbrush, in Argyle, were passed, and a third river
flowing inland, and called by the aborigines "Morrumbidgee", was
discovered. Minor excursions were immediately afterwards made by
individuals into that interesting country, where many fine tracts
of land were found, which have since proved of great value to the
grazier. It was not, however, until the winter of 1823, that an
extensive tract of undulated country, clear of timber, and watered
by the Morrumbidgee, was discovered by a party, conducted by an
officer of the navy, at a point nearer to its source than had
before been seen. This open country, which was named, upon its
discovery, "Brisbane Downs," the travellers learnt from a tribe of
natives was called in aboriginal language, "Monaroo", and its
extent was described by the Indians as very considerable. These
fine sheep-walks were ascertained, by accurate observations, to lie
immediately to the eastward of the meridian of 149&deg;, and were
found to extend upwards of forty miles to the southward of the
parallel of 36&deg; 15', which appears to be the latitude of their
northern skirts. They are further described as being bounded on the
east by the coast range of bills, which give an interior direction
to the course of the streams, by which they are permanently
watered; and on their western side, by those lofty mountains, now
known by the native name Warragong.</p>

<p>The elevation of Brisbane Downs, above the sea-shore (distant
from them to the eastward about seventy miles), although it has
never been measured, cannot be less than two thousand feet; and as
they are in higher latitude than other portions of land, within the
present boundaries of the colony, the climate may probably be found
more congenial to the growth of wool aria the constitution of
sheep, than that of those extensive tracts of pastoral country,
from which the colonists are annually obtaining so many thousand
fleeces for the English market. The mean height of any one point of
the great Warragong Chain, which appears to extend without
interruption to Wilson's Promontory (the southernmost extremity of
the Australian continent), has not yet been determined. That
portion, however, of which may be called the backbone of the
country, is, probably, of greater elevation above the level of the
ocean than any other range of mountains along the eastern coast,
either within or beyond the tropic, since its summit is not simply
covered with snow during the winter months, but has been seen
perfectly white at other seasons of the year.</p>

<p>At the same time that these important geographical researches
were carrying on in the southern parts of the colony, I was
occupied with a party in the elevated country on the north of
Bathurst, in which direction, at a distance of fifty miles from
that settlement, the Cudgeegong, a tributary to the Macquarie, had
been previously discovered, and stock stations erected on its
banks.</p>

<p>In my excursion through that mountainous country, I succeeded
not only in effecting a clear, well-defined route for the grazier
to Liverpool Plains from Bathurst, but also in bringing the
settlers of the latter district in direct communication with those
farmers, who had taken their lands on Hunter's River.</p>

<p>With the exception of my examination of the western and northern
sides of Liverpool Plains in the month of May, 1825, which enabled
me to furnish something more than what had been previously known of
those extensive levels, our stock of geographical knowledge
received no accession during either that or the following year. The
year 1827, however, anew scene opened to the colonists; for a
journey which the late Mr. Oxley had himself at one period
contemplated, was determined on, viz., to explore the entire
unknown country, lying on the western side of the dividing range,
between Hunter's River in latitude 32&deg; and Moreton Bay in
latitude 27&deg; S. For this purpose a well-appointed expedition,
equipped fully for an absence of five months, was placed by the
Colonial Government under my direction.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April of that year (1827), having provided myself
with the necessary instruments, and with an escort of six servants
and eleven horses, I took my departure from a station on an upper
branch of Hunter's River, and upon crossing the dividing range to
the westward, at a mean elevation above the level of the sea of
three thousand and eighty feet, I pursued my journey northerly,
through an uninteresting forest country, skirting Liverpool Plains
on the eastern side. As it is my intention to lay before the
public, ere long, a narrative of this journey, which, in
consequence of the long drought by which this part of the country
had suffered, cost my party no ordinary exertions, I trust that an
outline of it will now be sufficient.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, we crossed (in latitude 31&deg; 2') Mr.
Oxley's track easterly towards Port Macquarie in 1818, and from
that point the labours of the expedition commenced on ground
previously untrodden by civilized man. It was my original design to
have taken a fresh departure to the northward, from the point at
which the late Surveyor-General had passed the river named by him
the "Peel", upon our reaching the abovementioned parallel, and
which bore from a spot on which we had encamped, due east about
twelve miles: however, the intermediate country, although Mr. Oxley
had passed it, proved too elevated and rocky for my
heavily-burdened horses; and I was, therefore, obliged to continue
the course of the expedition to the north under the meridian of our
tents, (viz. 150&frac12;&deg;) being well aware that as the final course
of that river was towards the interior, we should cross its channel
whenever the chain of lofty hills which bounded us on the east, and
which appeared to stretch far to the north, should either terminate
or become so broken as to allow of its escape through them to a
lower level. Thus we continued our journey to the north through a
barren, but densely-timbered country, of frequently brushy
character, and altogether very indifferently watered. Each day as
we advanced, our barometer showed us that these poor
forest-grounds, which, to add to the difficulty of penetration,
were occasionally traversed by low and ridges of argillaceous
ironstone and clay-slate, rose in elevation from the low level of
the northern margin of Liverpool Plains, which I found to be only
eight hundred and forty feet above the level of the sea. This rise
of surface was, however, most gradual; for, after a march of forty
miles directly to the north, we found, on reaching the bank of a
small stream, a branch evidently of the Peel, that we had attained
but a mean height of one thousand nine hundred feet above the
sea-coast&mdash;an elevation which was too inconsiderable to
produce any obvious change for the better, either in the growth of
the timber, the nature of the soil, or of the scanty herbage.
Through those gloomy woods, with scarcely a trace of either Indian
or kangaroo, we patiently pursued our way until the 19th of May,
when upon passing the parallel of 30&deg;, we descended from some
stony hills to the head of a beautiful well-watered valley,
affording abundance of the richest pasturage, and bounded, on
either side, by a bold and elevated rocky range. This grassy vale
we followed northerly about sixteen miles to its termination at the
left bank of a large river, which, in seasons less unfavourable to
vegetation, appeared evidently a stream of considerable magnitude.
This was the Peel of Mr. Oxley; which, after pursuing its course to
the north for upwards of a degree of latitude from the point at
which that officer had passed it in 1818, had at length forced its
passage through a break in the eastern ranges, and, passing the
lower extremity of the valley in latitude 29&deg; 51', flowed on
towards an open country observed beyond it at north-west. So
considerable was the dip of the vale along which our route had
extended, that we found ourselves in the channel of this river,
again nearly on the level of the northern or lower sides of
Liverpool Plains; the mean of the results of our morning and
evening observations of the barometer giving us only nine hundred
and eleven feet. The channel of the Peel, which, at this period,
exhibited a bed of gravel two hundred and fifty yards in breadth,
is, in seasons of long rains, entirely filled by floods to the
depth of twelve and fifteen feet, as was obvious from the marks of
those freshes on the upper banks. The long continuance of dry
weather, which had alike distressed the colony and these distant
parts of the interior, had, however, reduced its stream to a mere
rill, which we forded without difficulty. Passing the channel of
this river, by which a considerable tract of broken mountainous
country to the S.E. is drained, we resumed our journey to the
north, between the meridian of 150&deg; and 151&deg;. Our course
led us through a variety of country; for, on quitting the river, we
traversed a barren, brushy tract, which extended more or less for
fourteen miles; beyond, however, the land materially improved, and,
as it was less encumbered with small timber and more open to the
action of the atmosphere, a considerable growth of grass was
produced. A succession of open forest hills of moderate elevation,
and narrow intermediate valleys, with an occasional patch of plain,
of a good soil, characterised the line of country, which the
expedition afterwards crossed; and although the land (the mean
elevation of which did not exceed eleven hundred feet) was,
generally speaking, rich, and productive of much grass, it was,
nevertheless, distressing to meet with tracts, many miles in
extent, entirely destitute of water. Traces of the natives were
frequent, although not of recent date. We met, however, with
neither the wandering Indian nor any description of animal, for the
parched state of vegetation and the distressed condition of the
country generally, had evidently driven both to other parts of the
interior, where the means of sustaining life were less precarious,
or, at least, where a permanent supply of water, although it might
be in a stagnant state, was to be obtained. Hitherto our view
towards the west had been circumscribed by a continued chain of
thinly-wooded ridges, which had extended, northerly, parallel to
the course we were daily pursuing. On reaching the latitude of
29&deg; 10' which we did on the 25th of the month, all the hills to
the westward of our line of route terminated, and a level, open
interior, of vast expanse, bounded on the north and north-west by a
distant horizon, broke suddenly on our view! At north-west, more
particularly, it was evident to all of us that the country had a
most decided dip, and on that bearing, the line of sight extended
over a great extent of densely wooded, or brushed, land, the
monotonous aspect of which was here and there relieved by a brown
patch of plain: of these some were so remote as to appear a mere
speck on the ocean of land before us, on which the eye sought
anxiously for a rising smoke, as indicative of the presence of the
wandering aborigines, but in vain: for, excepting in the immediate
neighbourhood of a river of the larger magnitude, these vast
solitudes may be fairly said to be almost entirely without
inhabitants. We had now all the high grounds on our right hand, or
to the east of us, and before us, at north, a level, wooded
country. With an anxious curiosity to explore so extraordinary a
region, we continued our route on the 26th of May, from a rocky
creek, where we had rested upon some tolerable pasture. Our
elevation above the sea-shore, we found by our barometer to be one
thousand two hundred and twenty-eight feet, and we soon discovered
that we had entered a barren waste, over which was spread a loose
sand, (the debris of the prevalent rock formation of the eastern
hills,) which gave it a desert-like aspect. A blighted kind of the
iron-bark tree, (apparently Eucalyptus resinifera,) scarcely
twenty-five feet high, clothed its surface, on which were here and
there interspersed dense patches of underwood, composed of plants
formerly observed on the western skirts of Liverpool Plains. In
this stage of our journey we crossed the parallel of 29&deg;, in
about the meridian of 150&deg; 40'; and having very little
expectation of meeting with water, in any state, in so and a
region, we were most agreeably surprised to find the channel of a
river from eighty to one hundred yards in width, winding its course
to the westward. This stream, which received the name of Dumaresq's
River, although greatly reduced by drought, presented,
nevertheless, a handsome piece of water, half a mile in length,
about thirty yards in width, and evidently very deep. My barometer,
which I set up on the gravelly bed of the river, gave me only eight
hundred and forty feet of elevation above the sea-coast, from which
we were distant to the westward about one hundred and seventy
English miles.</p>

<p>It was my full intention to have continued my course in the
direction of the meridian, at least to the parallel of 27&deg;,
before I made the least easting towards the coast-line; this
design, however, the existing circumstances of the country we had
penetrated compelled me to abandon; for the great debility to which
the whole of my horses were reduced, by the labours of the journey
through a line of country parched up by the drought, at once
obliged me to pursue a more eastern course, in which direction,
upon gaining the higher lands, I could alone expect to meet with a
better pasture than that on which they had for some time
subsisted.</p>

<p>On our new course to the northward and eastward, we had to
struggle through a desert waste for many miles, before we gained a
more undulated surface to the eastward of 151&deg;, when the
country through which we journeyed for about thirty miles,
presented a succession of thinly wooded stony hills, or low ridges
of sandstone rock, separated from each other by narrow valleys, in
which my half-famished horses met with but scanty subsistence. At
length, on the 5th of June, having gained an elevation of about
nine hundred feet above the bed of Dumaresq's River, we reached the
confines of a superior country. It was exceedingly cheering to my
people, after they had traversed a waste often times of the most
forbiddingly and character, for a space, more or less, of eighty
miles, and had borne, with no ordinary patience, a degree of
privation to which I had well-nigh sacrificed the weaker of my
horses-to observe, from a ridge which lay in our course, that they
were within a day's march of open downs of unknown extent, which
stretched, easterly, to the base of a lofty range of mountains,
distant, apparently, about twenty-five miles. On the 6th and
following day, we travelled throughout the whole extent of these
plains, to the foot of the mountains extending along their eastern
side, and the following is the substance of my observations on
their extent, soil, and capability.</p>

<p>These extensive tracts of clear pastoral country, which were
subsequently named Darling Downs, in honour of his Excellency the
Governor, are situated in, or about, the mean parallel of 28&deg;
S., along which they stretch east, eighteen statute miles to the
meridian of 152&deg;. Deep ponds, supported by streams from the
highlands, immediately to the eastward, extend along their central
lower flats, and these, when united, in a wet season, become an
auxiliary to Condamine's River&mdash;a stream which winds its
course along their south-western margin. The downs, we remarked,
varied in breadth in different parts of their lengthened surface:
at their western extremity they appeared not to exceed a mile and a
half, whilst towards their eastern limits, their width might be
estimated at three miles. The lower grounds, thus permanently
watered, present flats, which furnish an almost inexhaustible range
of cattle pasture at all seasons of the year&mdash;the grasses and
herbage generally exhibiting, in the depth of winter, an
extraordinary luxuriance of growth. From these central grounds,
rise downs of a rich, black, and dry soil, and very ample surface;
and as they furnish an abundance of grass, and are conveniently
watered, yet perfectly beyond the reach of those floods, which take
place on the flats in a season of rains, they constitute a valuable
and sound sheep pasture. We soon reached the base of some hills,
connected laterally with that stupendous chain of mountains, the
bold outline of which we had beheld with so much interest during
the three preceding days. These hills we found clothed, from their
foot upwards, with an underwood of the densest description, in the
midst of which, and especially on the ridges, appeared a pine,
which I immediately discovered to be the same species as that
observed in 1824, on the Brisbane River. Encamping, I ascended a
remarkable square-topped mount, which formed the western
termination of one of these ridges; and from its summit had a very
extensive view of the country lying between north and south,
towards the west. At N. and N.N.W. we observed a succession of
heavily-timbered ridges, extending laterally from the more elevated
chain of mountains immediately to the east, which evidently forms
the main dividing range in this part of the country, whilst from
north-west to west, and thence to south, within a range of twenty
miles, a most beautifully diversified landscape, made up of hill
and dale, woodland, and plain, appeared before us.</p>

<p>Large patches of land, perfectly clear of trees, lying to the
north of Darling Downs, were named Peel's Plains, whilst others,
hearing to the south and south-east, and which presented an
undulated surface with a few scattered trees, were called after the
late Mr. Canning. Directing our view beyond Peel's Plains to the
north-west, an expanse of flat, wooded country met the eye, being
evidently a continuation of those vast levels, which we had
frequently observed, in the progress of our journey, extending to
the west-ward of our line of route, and which, it was now
perceived, were continued northerly at least to the parallel of
27&deg;.</p>

<p>In a valley which led to the immediate base of the mountain
barrier, I fixed my northernmost encampment, determining, as I had
not the means of advancing further in consequence of the state of
my provisions and the low condition of my horses, to employ a short
period in a partial examination of the principal range, to the
western base of which we had penetrated from the southward, through
a considerable portion of barren interior. In exploring the
mountains immediately above our tents, with a view more especially
of ascertaining how far a passage could be effected over them to
the shores of Moreton Bay, a remarkably excavated part of the main
range was discovered, which appeared likely to prove a very
practicable pass through these mountains from the eastward. Its
more particular examination, however, I left to the period of a
visit, by sea, to Moreton Bay, which I had already contemplated,
and which I was enabled to effect in the course of the succeeding
year (1829). And the brief notice of my having thus, in a most
satisfactory manner, connected my sketch of the Brisbane River
country with this pass, and with the lands to the westward, will be
seen in another part of this paper.</p>

<p>The situation of my tents in the valley was determined to be as
follows. Latitude, by meridional altitudes of the sun, being the
mean of five observations, 28&deg; 10' 45" south Longitude, by
account corrected by bearings taken to fixed points on or near the
coast-line, and compared with the mean results of several sets of
distances of the sun and star Antares from the moon, 152&deg; 7'
45" E. The variation of the compass was found by azimuths to be
8&deg; 18' E. The mean height of the spot above the level of the
sea, by the mercurial column noted morning and evening, was one
thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven feet; and its distance
from the penal settlement on the Brisbane River, which bore by
compass about north-east from us, was estimated at about
seventy-five statute miles. Circumstances now urged me to commence
my journey homewards, and this I determined to prosecute with as
much despatch as the condition of my horses and the nature of the
country would admit of. I had also resolved to pursue my course to
the southward, under the meridian of our encampment, as that would
lead us through a tract of perfectly unknown country, lying nearly
equidistant between our outward-bound track and the coast-line.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, therefore, I again put my people in motion,
and quitting the vale in which we had rested, (and which I had
named after the late Captain Logan, at that period commandant of
Moreton Bay,) I shaped my course to the southward; and after
passing through a fine, open, forest tract, abounding in excellent
pasturage, in nine miles gained the north-eastern [65] skirts of
Canning Downs, of which I had had a view from a station on the
hills which we had left.</p>

<p>At the close of the 18th, after penetrating an uninteresting
forest, chiefly of red gum (Eucalyptus robusta), we reached the
borders of a broken mountainous country, which exhibited a
geological structure that had not been previously met with in any
part of our journey. The rock was a very hard granite, in which the
quartz, greatly preponderating, was unusually large; and at this
stage of our homeward-bound journey our difficulties commenced.
During the succeeding week, our daily journeys were attended with
great fatigue both to my people and horses; for being surrounded by
high lands, we had no alternative but to pursue our way southerly,
from one rocky range to another of greater elevation; until at
length we found ourselves upon an open heath, totally devoid of
trees, but covered with a low, scrubby vegetation, and interspersed
with small patches of spongy swamp, in aspect similar to parts of
the Blue Mountains to the westward of Port Jackson. And although
the base continued of granite, and the difference of latitude was
nearly 5&deg; yet the same species of plants as are to be observed
upon those elevated ranges of the colony were, for the most part,
to be found. At noon of the 25th, our latitude, observed on a very
bleak sterile spot on those mountains, (two thousand nine hundred
and sixty-nine feet above the sea-shore,) was 28&deg; 45' S., and
our longitude, reduced from the meridian of our encampment in Logan
Vale, was about 151&deg; 59' E. From that point, notwithstanding
our elevation, our view towards the east was altogether
circumscribed by lofty ranges, whose summits towered far above the
height we had attained. In the course of the succeeding day, the
progress of the expedition to the south was arrested by a most wild
and frightful region, which obliged me at once to seek a more
practicable country, by directing the course of my party to the
westward, in which direction we, with difficulty, gained a lower
level, and thence prosecuted our journey to the south-west, by such
stages as the reduced strength of my horses was able to accomplish.
On passing to the southward of the parallel of 29&deg;, which we
did in longitude 151&deg; 32' E., we again forded Dumaresq's River
about fifty miles nearer its source, or to the eastward of the
point at which we had discovered it on our outward-bound journey.
Here our barometer gave us an elevation of one thousand and forty
feet above the level of the sea, which showed a mean fall of four
feet per mile, between the two fords.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, after having traversed in a south-western
direction a great diversity of country, in general of broken, rocky
surface, we fell in with our former track, and on the following day
crossed the channel of what I had considered the Peel, but which I
subsequently named the Gwydir, upon finding it formed by a junction
of Mr. Oxley's River with another as large, to which I gave the
title of Horton's River. This latter has a course parallel to the
Peel, through a valley lying to the westward of it, along which I
was again enabled to direct my party to the south many miles,
before a series of elevated forest ridges, stretching laterally
from Hardwicke's range of Mr. Oxley, once more obliged us to climb
the hills. These we ascended from the head of the vale, by a steep
acclivity, and, at an elevation of one thousand three hundred feet
above its level, resumed our course to the south. Among these hills
we again observed granite, but of a reddish appearance, in
consequence of the quantity and colour of the felspar which might
be seen disseminated through the rock, of which Hardwicke's range
is evidently formed; the elevation, above the level of the sea, of
whose curiously formed cubical and chimney-shaped summits cannot be
less than three thousand five hundred feet. The vegetation of this
group of hills exhibited nothing remarkable; the ridges were
generally grassy, but the Gramineae, as well as the timbers, which
were of Eucalyptus, were of species frequent in the colony. At the
close of our second day's journey, we had traversed these lateral
ranges to their southern side, which overlooked an apparently
level, wooded country, extending to Liverpool Plains, the greater
body of which at length appeared before us to the south-west, at a
distance of forty miles. Repeatedly, in our attempts to descend to
the lower country, were we stopped by rocky ravines several hundred
feet in depth; and it was not without considerable difficulty and
danger to the horses that we gained the levels beneath us, having
actually descended a wooded ridge, from which there was an abrupt
declivity of one thousand five hundred and forty feet. After a
severe march of thirty miles through a barren forest for the most
part of blighted Iron-bark, furnishing but little pasturage and
still less water, we at length arrived at Barrow's Valley of Mr.
Oxley, which, in seasons of long rains, is evidently laid under
water by the overflow of Field's River, which, in its course
inland, we met meandering north-west, through the adjacent forest.
On the bank of this river, where I gave my horses a day's rest upon
the richest meadow-land we had seen in the whole tour, it was with
pleasure that I hailed the colonial blue gum (Eucalyptus piperita)
of stupendous size, the alluvial grounds on each bank producing
also the herbage of the flooded flats of the Hawkesbury River in
the colony. On the 20th of July, we resumed our route to the
southward, and after pursuing a steady course for about
twenty-seven miles through a barren, brushy country, not nine
hundred feet above the level of the sea, we passed the northern
margin of Liverpool Plains, throughout which, such had been the
effect of drought, that we crossed their extensive surface almost
to the foot of the dividing range (a space of twenty-five miles)
before we found water for the horses or ourselves. On the 28th my
party repassed the Mountain Range, and after an absence of thirteen
weeks, we returned to the station from which we had departed, on
the Hunter, having, in that period, traversed upwards of eight
hundred miles of every description of country.</p>

<p>My report to the Colonial Government of this journey&mdash;-of
the spacious downs we had discovered in latitude 28&deg;&mdash;and
the considerable tract of very indifferent country, in part actual
desert, that lay between the colony and those extensive pastoral
lands, immediately suggested the importance of examining the space
between those downs and the sea-coast at Moreton Bay; since, should
the Gap, which had been discovered in the main dividing range in
the above parallel, prove, on actual survey, to admit of a passage
through that chain of mountains, the readiest point of access to
the very desirable country on their western side would be from the
shores of Moreton Bay and Brisbane River,&mdash;-on the banks of
the latter of which a penal settlement had already been established
for several years. This inquiry became one of the objects of my
voyage from Port Jackson the following year; and its results proved
every way most satisfactory to the colonial government, and the
colonists generally.</p>

<p>As I propose to make some general remarks elsewhere on the
character of the country around Moreton Bay&mdash;a country alike
interesting to the botanist and geologist&mdash;I will here simply
remark, that in exploring the intermediate tract between the
Brisbane River and the point where my overland journey of the
preceding year had terminated, I ascertained that a line of road
could be easily constructed from the western downs, easterly
through the mountain pass, and thence in a north-eastern direction
to the head of the navigation of a branch of the Brisbane River,
named the Bremer; to which point evidently the future produce of
the interior beyond those mountains will be conveyed, since from it
the means of water-carriage to shipping in the bay will be found
practicable at all seasons of the year, whatever may be the effect
of drought on the land; the tide, which daily sets into the
Brisbane for fifty miles above its mouth, flowing also up the
channel of the Bremer, the depth of water in which it augments
eight or more feet.</p>

<p>I was happy on this occasion of my visit to the Brisbane River,
with in part other objects in view, to be enabled to carry on my
survey from Darling Downs to the very shores of Moreton Bay; and in
effecting it, I derived an additional pleasure, in closing my
sketch of an extent of intricate country, comprehending from
Hunter's River to Brisbane Town, 5&deg; of latitude, to find out a
very small error in my longitude. In the winter of the following
year (1829), I again made a voyage to Moreton Bay, where I was
engaged more particularly in botanical research. From that most
interesting occupation, in so novel and ample a field as the banks
of the Brisbane River afforded me, I found a short period of
leisure to devote to geographical inquiry; and, accordingly, in an
excursion to the north-west, I explored that stream far towards its
source, through an irregular country, which presented much
diversity of surface to interest the geographer. During that short
journey, in which I employed a small party about six weeks, I
traced the principal branch of the river as far north as latitude
26&deg; 52', until its channel assumed merely the character of a
chain of very shallow stagnant pools. In this excursion I made such
observations as fully established two facts, viz.:&mdash;That the
Brisbane River, at one period supposed to be the outlet of the
marshes of the Macquarie, etc., originates on the eastern side of
the dividing range, its chief sources being in elevated lands,
lying almost on the coast line, between the parallels of 26&deg;
and 27&deg;; and that the main ranges, which separate the
coast-waters from those that flow inland, continue to the north in
one unbroken chain as far as the eye could discern, from a
commanding station near my most distant encampment up the river,
and present no opening or hollow part in their elevated ridge,
through which to admit of a road being made, to the interior beyond
them. My pass, therefore, through those lofty mountains (the mean
elevation of which above the shores of Moreton Bay cannot be less
than four thousand feet), seems thus the only opening to the
interior country from the coast between the parallels of 26&deg;
and 29&deg; south.</p>

<p>Whilst I was engaged at Moreton Bay, the long droughts to which
our distant colony has been repeatedly subjected since its
foundation, and which, again visiting that country in 1826, had
continued with most distressing severity for upwards of three
years, led the colonial government to inquire into the state of the
interior, to the westward of the termination of the Macquarie
River, with the view of attempting to make some discoveries in that
quarter. Whilst the drought continued, an expedition was despatched
under the direction of Captain Sturt, an officer of his Majesty's
39th regiment, to Mount Harris, a detached hill upon the Macquarie
River, where Mr. Oxley had left his boats upon proceeding easterly
towards the coast. Upon reaching that remarkable eminence, which
Captain Sturt and the party forming his expedition were enabled to
do on the 20th of December, he ascended the summit to survey the
country below. But how much had the evaporation of the sun, which,
in its operation, had continued during a period of three years,
changed the face of those regions! The plains which Mr. Oxley had
left entirely under water in 1815, now presented an expanse of
dried-up surface, which to all appearance extended northerly,
without the slightest semblance of rising ground, to a distant
"clear unbroken horizon." Encouraged by these appearances, the
expedition traced the Macquarie, through the last stage of its
existence, to the woodlands below Mount Harris, where its channel
becoming broken and in parts having altogether disappeared on the
common level, ceased "to exist in any shape as a river." In
exploring the country beyond this point, the party traversed the
bed of that extensive morass, into which the late surveyor-general
had ten years previously descended in his boat: this they now found
"a large and blasted plain, on which the sun's rays fell with
intense heat"; the ground itself, parched to an extreme, exhibiting
in many places deep and dangerous clefts, which clearly
demonstrated the long existence of those droughts, to which every
known part of New South Wales was at that period exposed. On these
inhospitable levels, Captain Sturt passed a week; and in that
period he skirted three distinct patches of marsh, in which were
found broken channels of the river, forming so many stagnant
lagoons or canals, surrounded by reeds.</p>

<p>In whatever direction they advanced to satisfy themselves as to
the fate of the Macquarie, whether on the plains or wooded grounds,
reeds of gigantic stature (the clearest indication of what such a
country is in a regularly wet season) encompassed them, and greatly
obstructed their progress. Mr. Hume, whose enterprising disposition
was abundantly manifested in his journey to the south coast, which
has been already noticed in this paper, was associated with Captain
Sturt on this occasion. With such aid, the latter proposed to
divide the party, in order to undertake at the same time two
distinct excursions, to ascertain more fully the nature and extent
of those marshy flats, and set at rest any doubts which might be
entertained as to the mode in which that river terminated-that is,
of its non-existence in that low country, after the devastating
operation of a drought of three years. Accordingly, one party,
conducted by Mr. Hume, proceeded in a north-easterly direction,
towards the Castlereagh, whilst Captain Sturt himself pursued a
course to the north-west.</p>

<p>It would indeed have been most interesting, at this stage of the
expedition, had Captain Sturt been provided with good barometers,
to have ascertained the mean height above the level of the sea, not
only of the lowlands over which the party had so patiently borne
the burden and heat of the day, but also of the country which
Captain Sturt traversed in his excursion to the north-west, and
which he found, "after travelling between twenty and thirty miles,"
began to rise. Also his level at the end of his journey, which was
extended to an estimated distance of one hundred miles, where he
"made a hill of considerable elevation," from the summit of which
he had "a view of other high lands"; one in particular to the
south-west, which he describes as "being a very fine mountain", and
which he afterwards visited, and found "of sandstone formation,"
elevated above the "desert waste" on which it stands, one thousand
three hundred feet. Captain Sturt, however, had no barometer on
which he could in the least depend; the instrument with which he
had been provided on his quitting Sydney having sustained an injury
on the Macquarie, four days before the expedition reached Mount
Harris.</p>

<p>The observations made during these short excursions satisfied
the party, that the river had no existence in any shape beyond the
"third marsh" previously explored. Mr. Hume passed from east to
west, along the northern skirts of those extensive reedy flats,
without either meeting with a further trace of a channel northerly,
or finding water enough to supply his daily wants. And the
character and direction of those vast flats, as well as the points
to which the waters discharged upon them by the Macquarie in
seasons of prolonged rains, tend, were now fully determined.</p>

<p>From the report of Captain Sturt's examination of those
lowlands, then, affected as they were at the time by drought, these
facts may be gathered. At a distance of about twenty-eight miles
below Mount Harris, the flat lands commence, and there the
Macquarie itself ceases to be a river, having no banks, or
continued channel, by which to prevent the dispersion of its waters
when they rise in rainy seasons. The surface of those flats,
however, has not one continued dip, but presents a succession of
levels and inclinations, with each a detached lagoon-like channel,
hemmed in on all sides by high reeds which catch the waters as they
spread; and it is only when these are overflowed that the floods
spread over the level, "until," as Captain Sturt observes, "a
slight declivity giving them fresh impulse," they arrive at a
second channel, and so spread to a third, until a considerable
extent of surrounding country is laid under water. When such a
general inundation takes place, as that witnessed in 1818, there is
a current through the body of these marshes, setting, agreeably to
configuration of the ground (as at length shown to us by Captain
Sturt), to the north and north-north-east, where, uniting with the
waters of Morissett's ponds, the whole is thrown into the channel
of the Castlereagh River.</p>

<p>To the north-west of those marshy grounds, Captain Sturt
described the country as rising, and therefore preventing any flow
of the waters of the morass to that point of the compass. This rise
of the surface, which I observe is elsewhere described as a
"table-land with scarcely water to support its inhabitants", may be
clearly understood as meaning a series of low terraces of dry
forest-land, which present a level tract of ground, or one but
slightly undulated, extending, probably, a considerable distance,
until a second rise of the ground takes place. And the extreme
perpendicular elevation of such a tract above the plane. of the
marshes is far too inconsiderable to justify its being considered a
rising hilly country; nor is its actual mean height above the level
of the sea raised in the least, because it has been ascertained
that there are upon its desert-like surface a few rocky hills,
which, standing far detached from each other, appear, when viewed
with the country surrounding the base of each, like so many islands
in the ocean. This view of the face of the country bounding the
marshes of the Macquarie on the northwest will assuredly be
verified, whenever a barometer is carried to that part of the
interior.</p>

<p>Finally, before I quit the subject of those low marshy grounds,
which have excited so much interest and speculation among
geographers since the report of them given by Mr. Oxley, I would
briefly remark, that although a drought of unparalleled duration
had disposed of their waters, so as to enable Captain Sturt and his
party to traverse their bed in a dried-up, hardened state, still,
whenever a wet season sets in, and rain falls upon the mountainous
districts of that colony, in the same quantity that it did in the
years 1817 and 1818, it can scarcely be doubted that a like
considerable inundation will again take place in that part of the
interior; and when it is considered (as Captain Sturt informs us)
that a space, twenty miles in breadth, and more than fifty in
length, is subject to be thus deluged, can it be a subject of
surprise that the late indefatigable surveyor-general, when he
descended in his boat to such an expanse of water, to which he
could perceive neither boundary nor shore, should, with no previous
knowledge of such a water, or of the features of the surrounding
country, have conceived himself in the "vicinity of an inland sea
or lake", of the temporary or more permanent existence of which he
did not, nor could he have offered an opinion?</p>

<p>Captain Sturt now directed his expedition to the north-west,
with a view to further discoveries, aware as he was, from the
observations he had previously made during his own short excursion,
that a clear open country was before him in that direction. In
their route his party traversed plains "covered with a black
scrub", yet furnishing in parts some good grass. The detached
hills, already spoken of, as relieving the otherwise monotonous
aspect of that part of the interior, and in the neighbourhood of
which Captain Sturt had directed his course, he described "as
gentle picturesque elevations, for the most part covered with
verdure." Of two of these isolated spots, the one "Oxley's Table
Land", the other "New Year's Range", it appears our indefatigable
officer determined the positions; these were as follows:</p>

<p>Oxley's Table Land, lat. 29&deg; 57' 30" S., long. 145&deg; 43'
30" E.<br>
New Year's Range, lat. 30&deg; 21' 00" long. 146&deg; 33' 30".</p>

<p>In continuing their journey westerly over this level country,
its total want of water, excepting in creeks where the supply was
both bad and uncertain, became a source of considerable annoyance
to the party; who ultimately were obliged to follow one of the
water-courses, which, when tracing it to the northwest, brought
them (on the 2nd of February) to the left bank of a large river,
the appearance of which "raised their most sanguine expectations."
To the utter disappointment of the travellers, however, its waters
were found perfectly salt; and this circumstance was the more
severely felt, as the horses of the expedition had travelled long
in an excessively heated atmosphere, and had been without water a
considerable time. After making some arrangement in favour of his
exhausted animals, Captain Sturt, accompanied by Mr. Hume,
proceeded to explore this river, to which he gave the name of
Darling. They followed it in the direction of its course
(southwesterly) about forty miles, and throughout found its waters
not only not drinkable, but rather becoming, as they advanced, more
considerably impregnated with salt. In one part they observed
"brine-springs", and the banks throughout were encrusted with
"salt", or, probably, with aluminous particles. The breadth of the
river, at the point they first made it, was estimated at sixty
yards, and its boundary banks were from thirty to forty feet in
height&mdash;dimensions which they maintained as far as it was
possible to explore the river.</p>

<p>At length the want of "drinkable water" along its bank, and the
appearance of a loose red sandy soil, at the point to which the
patience and perseverance of the travellers had induced them to
trace the river, at once destroying all hope of meeting with the
most scanty supply in the back country, obliged them to give up its
further examination. The extreme point to which the Darling was
traced, and from which it continued its course through a level
country to the south-west, Captain Sturt marks on his map, in
latitude 30&deg; 16' south, and longitude 144&deg; 50' east.</p>

<p>Thus was a portion of the interior of New South Wales,
comprehending two degrees of longitude to the westward of the part
to which Mr. Oxley had penetrated in the marshes, explored; and
although the country is little better than a desert waste, and,
therefore, can hold out no prospect of an advantageous "extension
of the colony in that direction", its character, nevertheless, was
ascertained, and so much of the map of the country, previously a
blank, was at length filled up.</p>

<p>The expedition had daily intercourse with the natives who
inhabit the river and adjacent country, which it would seem is,
comparatively speaking, well peopled; for Captain Sturt estimates
that he could not have seen fewer than two hundred and fifty of
these Indians, among whom his party passed on the most friendly
terms, and, indeed, were frequently indebted to them for kindly
acts.</p>

<p>Captain Sturt, however, draws a most melancholy picture of these
distant regions, which, notwithstanding the population found on
their surface, were rendered, by the distress of the season,
scarcely habitable. "The natives," he observed, "were remarked
wandering in the desert, and from the badness of the water which
they were obliged to drink, had contracted a cutaneous disease,
which was fast carrying them off. Birds, which were noticed sitting
on the trees, appeared to be gasping for existence, amidst the
glare of torrid heat. The wild dog, or dingo, was seen prowling
about in the day-time, being unable from debility to avoid the
party; and while minor vegetation was altogether burnt up, the very
trees were absolutely drooping from the depth to which the drought
had penetrated the soil. Several of the party were affected by
ophthalmia, produced by the reverberated heat from the plains which
they had traversed, where the thermometer stood in the shade at
three P.M. at 122&deg; or from 98&deg; to 102&deg; Fahrenheit, at
sunset."</p>

<p>The Darling may be justly considered the largest river which has
been discovered in New South Wales, since it is formed by a
junction of all the streams which were discovered by Mr. Oxley in
1818 (and these were five in number, each of considerable
magnitude), as well as of those I met with in my journey of 1827;
and thus it constitutes the great drain of a tract of mountainous
country lying between the parallels of 27&deg; and 33&frac12;&deg;. But
what ultimately becomes of this river so sustained, to what other
channels it becomes united, what course it eventually pursues,
beyond the spot where Captain Sturt and his comrade left it flowing
through a desert country to the south-west, or on what coast it is
discharged, if it really does make the sea at any point, remains
wholly unknown, and is therefore still to be discovered.</p>

<p>The party were now glad to direct their steps towards Bathurst;
but before they finally quitted these parched levels, they shaped a
course to the eastward, with the view of meeting with the
Castlereagh, the channel of which (one hundred and eighty yards in
width) Mr. Oxley experienced no small difficulty in crossing, as
the rains which had fallen on the mountains to the south-east,
whence it derives its principal sources, had swollen its waters to
the level of its upper banks. On making this river they traced it
down full one hundred miles to its junction with another part of
the Darling, the water of which they found even salter than it was
at the point at which the expedition had originally fallen in with
it; nor did they find a sufficiency in the Castlereagh to meet
their daily demands, for its bed was laid bare "for a distance of
thirty miles at a stretch", which obliged our travellers to "search
the country round" for the little water which it had to yield
them.</p>

<p>Surrounded as the party were by difficulties in a region
"deserted by the native tribes", scarcely capable of sustaining
animal life, and in which all the dogs of the expedition fell a
sacrifice, still Captain Sturt appears to have been unwilling to
quit his ground; for although the briny waters of the Darling were
in themselves quite enough to have induced him to have made a hasty
retreat southerly, to higher grounds and a better country, we,
nevertheless, find him crossing the Salt River, to see what the
country was in a north-westerly direction; nor does it appear that
the curiosity of our travellers was at all satisfied, until they
had penetrated a considerable distance on that course, where they
found the ground uniformly level, and the surface in no part broken
by either creek or minor water-course, the entire country around
being, as far as could be seen from the highest tree, "a boundless
flat," the elevation of which above the level of the sea was,
probably, not more than five hundred feet. Captain Sturt had at
length done his utmost; he, therefore, very wisely directed his
party to the southward, and soon reached Bathurst.</p>

<p>Thus, much of our knowledge of the internal parts of New South
Wales in the parallel of 30&deg;, was derived from the labours of
this indefatigable officer; to whom was entrusted, at the close of
1829, the direction of a second expedition, destined to trace the
course of the Morrumbidgee, another western stream, rising in a
range of mountains situated to the southward of the parallel of
35&deg;, and under the meridian of 149&deg;, at a distance of about
eighty miles inland from the eastern coast line, and within what is
now denominated the county of Murray. Of the character of this
river it may be here briefly remarked, that its bed forms a
succession of planes, of which some are of great inclination; along
these its waters flow with considerable velocity in nearly a west
direction.</p>

<p>After receiving the Yass River and some other minor streams, all
of which fall into it at an early stage of its progress, namely, in
longitude 148&frac12;&deg;, the Morrumbidgee pursues a long and tortuous
course for upwards of three hundred statute miles, without deriving
the slightest increase from the country it waters; and thus in this
respect it resembles the Lachlan, which maintains a parallel course
through the low interior to the northward. From this fact may be
inferred the generally sterile character of a considerable portion
of the country lying between the channels of these two rivers, and
which was in part ascertained by Mr. Oxley in 1817. As its course
extends to the westward of the meridian 147&deg;, the Morrumbidgee
falls on a low level, the hills of sandstone rock, which give a
picturesque appearance to the lands on its banks, higher up the
stream, disappear; and flats of alluvial deposit occupy their
place.</p>

<p>Thus far the river had been followed down some years ago, by
stock-keepers in pursuit of strayed cattle, who also ascertained,
in their long rides along its banks, the extent to which the
country westerly, from its elevation above inundation, might be
safely occupied as grazing stations. The direction which this river
was also at that period known to take towards the marshes of the
Lachlan, led to the conclusion, that both streams were united in
those morasses; and on so low a level, (as was ascertained by Mr.
Oxley in 1817), as to favour the opinion that their confluent
waters were rather dissipated over an extensively flat surface,
than carried on in one body to the ocean, distant at least three
hundred miles. And this opinion, gratuitous as it was, would
nevertheless have proved to have been correct, had the Morrumbidgee
not pursued its course so far to the westward as to reach the
channel of a much larger river; since, as will presently be seen,
it has neither magnitude nor velocity sufficient to force its way
two hundred and sixty miles to the sea-coast; but which the
principal stream, by its volume and strength, has the power to
effect.</p>

<p>The second expedition conducted by Captain Sturt proceeded from
Sydney to explore the Morrumbidgee, in December, 1829. Tracing it
down on its right bank, until he had passed every rapid or fall
that might impede its navigation, he established a
depot&mdash;launched a boat, which he had conveyed overland from
Sydney, and having, by dint of great exertion, built another on the
spot, he lost no time in commencing his examination of the river to
the westward. Before we follow the enterprising party on their
voyage, it may be interesting to give the height of the river at
the depot, above the sea-coast, as derived from the observations of
the late surveyor-general many years ago, on the adjacent country,
which results it would have been very satisfactory had Captain
Sturt been possessed of the means of verifying. This will show not
only how slight is the inclination of its bed to give an impetus to
its stream westerly towards the ocean, but also how perfectly
unavailable to the colony are those vast flats of low country,
which were observed to extend along its banks. The situation of his
depot Captain Sturt found to be in latitude 34&frac14;&deg; south, and
longitude 143&deg; 57' east, or about twenty-seven geographic miles
southwest from Mr. Oxley's extreme point of penetration on the
steppes of the Lachlan, in July 1817, the mean elevation of which
above the level of the sea, that accurate traveller had determined,
by barometrical admeasurement, to be not more than two hundred and
fifty feet. Now, as Captain Sturt informs us that the dispersed
waters of those morasses again unite, and drain into the
Morrumbidgee by a "large creek", which he passed about twelve miles
west from his depot, it is very evident that the bed of this latter
river, and the country immediately adjacent, are at a somewhat
lower level than Mr. Oxley's last or westernmost encampment.</p>

<p>On the 7th January, the expedition moved forward down the river,
and on the fourth day, having passed extensive alluvial flats, on
which were patches of reeds, the navigation became much interrupted
by "fallen timber", and as the current was frequently very rapid,
particularly in those parts of the river where its channel had
become contracted, the boats were oftentimes in great danger from
sunken logs. After advancing on their voyage about ninety miles to
the westward, through a country of level, monotonous aspect, the
party were relieved from the state of anxiety which a week's most
difficult and dangerous navigation had caused, by their arrival at
(to use Captain Sturt's words) "the termination of the
Morrumbidgee," for its channel, much narrowed and partially choked
by driftwood, delivered its waters "into a broad and noble river",
the current of which was setting to the westward at the rate of two
miles and a half per hour, with a medium width from bank to bank of
from three to four hundred feet. This "new river", which was called
the Murray, and into which the diminished waters of the
Morrumbidgee fall, is evidently formed by a junction of the "Hume",
and "Ovens,"&mdash;which streams, taking their rise in the great
Wanagong Chain, were first made known to us by the travellers
Messrs. Hovell and Hume, who crossed them, two hundred and fifty
statute miles nearer their sources, in their excursion to Port
Philip in 1824. Pursuing the course of the Murray, on the 14th
January, the voyagers made "rapid progress to the W.N.W.",
noticing, as they passed on, a low "unbroken and uninteresting
country of equal sameness of features and vegetation", to that
observed whilst descending the intricate Morrumbidgee on quitting
their depot.</p>

<p>After nine days' voyage down the Murray, in which period they
made about one hundred miles of westing, without observing the
slightest change of country for the better, or the least rise in
its surface, the expedition passed the mouth of a stream flowing
from the north by east, with a strong current, and in point of
magnitude but "little inferior" to the Murray itself. Ascending it,
Captain Sturt found it preserved a breadth of one hundred yards,
and its banks, on which were many natives, "were overhung with
trees of finer and larger growth" than those of the Murray. Its
waters were, moreover, ascertained to be two fathoms in depth; of
turbid appearance, but "perfectly sweet to the taste." The
confluence of these two rivers takes place, it appears, (by Captain
Sturt's reckoning), in exactly longitude 141&deg; east, and
immediately to the south of the parallel of 34&deg;. It was at this
stage of the expedition that the face of the country began to
assume (comparatively speaking) an interesting appearance, and the
first rise of ground which had been seen in the advance of the
party to the westward in a direct line of more than two hundred
miles, was observed at a moderate distance from the river to the
north-west. Previous to his reaching the point of confluence of the
two rivers, Captain Sturt, it would appear, had entertained a doubt
as to the "decline of the vast plain through which the Murray
flows", as well as of "the probable fall of the waters of the
interior" to the north of it; but on observing a new stream flowing
into the Murray, the circumstance of the "parallel" (meridian
doubtless) in which he had struck it, "and the direction from which
it came", combined to satisfy him, "that it could be no other than
the Darling." It was therefore concluded that the whole of the
internally formed streams, at present known in that country, from
my Dumaresq's River, (discovered in 1827 in lat. 29&deg;) to the
Murray in 34&deg;, are discharged into the ocean on the south
coast-the dip of the continent within the parallels of 28&deg; and
35&frac12;&deg;, being of course to that point. However, the identity of
this tributary to the Murray with the Darling, remains still to be
ascertained, before the declension of so considerable portion of
the interior can be said to be southerly, and before one can
positively assert, with the president of a society in New South
Wales, either that an interesting fact has been established-viz.,
"that all the waters from the Bathurst country, owing to the dip of
the earth, run to the south-west extremities of eastern
Australia,"&mdash;or that these discoveries have opened a water
communication from the south coast, "one thousand miles through a
variety of agricultural and pastoral country, in one of the finest
climates which the world can boast of", and capable of sustaining
"millions of emigrants".</p>

<p>The character of the Darling, as also the general direction of
its course, beyond the point to which it has been traced, we have
yet to ascertain. Since, however, it is by far the most
considerable inland stream at present known in that country, it is
to be hoped, that its further examination, which may furnish much
interesting information respecting the actual features of the more
remote regions of the interior to the north-west, will ere long be
prosecuted. But to follow the expedition down the Murray.</p>

<p>That river, after it receives the supposed Darling, continues
its course upwards of a degree farther to the westward, and in that
space received a second stream, which falls in on its left bank
from the south-east. This tributary stream, which is described as a
river of "considerable importance", and was named the "Lindesay",
is most probably the "Goulburn" of the same indefatigable
explorers, whose journey overland to the south coast in 1824 I have
already adverted to, and who, in fording their river at a part
where its channel presented a breadth of eighty yards, left it
winding its course to the north-west. From this point, the Murray
assumed a new feature, and along its northern bank extended a range
of cliffs, which appeared to the party, as they passed beneath
them, to be of "partial volcanic origin." The navigation at length
became rather intricate, for those cliffs being immediately
succeeded by others on each bank, of limestone, the river was found
to force its way through a glen of that rock, in its passage
frequently striking bases of precipices of the same formation,
which rose to a perpendicular elevation of two hundred feet, and in
which "coral and fossil remains" were remarked to be plentifully
imbedded. At this stage of their passage, those long ranges of
forest hills, which extend along the eastern shore of the Gulf of
St. Vincent, became discernible, indicating to the exploring party
their approach to the coast. On the 3d February, the river having
reached the meridian of 139&frac34;&deg;, the disposition of the bounding
cliffs gave its course a decided bend to the southward, through a
continuation of the glen, which at length opened into a valley.</p>

<p>Here the river was observed to have lost the sandy bottom which
it had exhibited throughout its long course from the eastward, for
its bed having now dipped to almost the level of the sea, its
waters had become "deep, still, and turbid." Its course to the
south was followed by the voyagers along reaches of from two to
four miles in length; and upon their passing the parallel of
35&deg;, a more open country appeared before them, for the cliffs
having partially ceased, had given place to picturesque hills and
lower undulations, beneath which extended "thousands of acres of
the richest flats"; but, as Captain Sturt adds that these were
covered with reeds, and were evidently liable to inundation from
the river, the value to the agriculturist of such marshy grounds,
scarcely at all elevated above the sea-shore, may be easily
estimated.</p>

<p>On the 8th of February (the thirty-second day of the voyage from
the depot) the hills "wore a bleak appearance", and the few trees
which had at one period fringed their ridges, were for the most
part broken off, "as if by the prevalent winds." At noon, upon
entering the river's last reach, no land could be discerned at its
extremity; some low hills continued, however, along its left bank,
whilst its right was hid by high reeds. Immediately afterwards,
these enterprising voyagers entered an extensive lake, the body of
which stretched away far to the south-west, in which direction "the
line of water met the horizon." This lake, which received the name
of "Alexandrina", was estimated at from fifty to sixty miles in
length, and from thirty to forty in breadth. A large bight was
observed in it to the south-east, and an extensive bay at the
opposite point; still, notwithstanding these dimensions, this very
considerable sheet of water appears to be but a mere shoal
throughout, since Captain Sturt states, "its medium depth" is but
"four feet"!</p>

<p>Upon this vast but shallow lake, he pursued his voyage to the
southward, remarking that its waters, which at seven miles from the
point of discharge of the Murray into it were brackish, were at
twenty-one miles across perfectly salt, and there the force of the
tide was perceived. As the party approached the southern shore, the
navigation of the boats was interrupted by mud flats, and soon
their further progress was effectually stopped by banks of sand.
Captain Sturt therefore landed, and walking over some sandy
hummocks, beyond which he had, from his morning's position, seen
the sea, almost immediately came out upon the coast of Encounter
Bay of the charts, whence he took bearings to Cape "Jarvoise,"
(rather Jervis of Captain Flinders), and the South-east point of
Kangaroo Island. At the lower part of the lake seals were observed,
and near the spot on the southern shore, where the party had
effected a landing, some natives were seen grouped together, but as
they bore arms and had their bodies painted, it was obvious that
their intentions were far from being friendly; nor did they,
although they saw the party were peaceably disposed, attempt to
visit the encampment of the travellers during their stay on the
margin of the lake.</p>

<p>Having thus seen the termination of the Murray and the outlet of
the lake into which it falls upon the south coast, Captain Sturt
lost as little time as possible in conducting his party back by
water to his depot&mdash;circumstances not permitting of a more
perfect examination of that extensive piece of water, from the
north-western extremity of which, some hopes had been entertained
of there being a clear and open communication with the Gulf of St.
Vincent.</p>

<p>Now we gather from the results of this second tour of discovery
of Captain Sturt, simply this, and no more, viz.&mdash;in what way
the Morrumbidgee, as well as the several streams which were crossed
by Messrs. Hovell and Hume in 1824, and the waters of the Lachlan
of Oxley in 1817 (all which unite), are disposed of; as also the
nature of the "unbroken, uninteresting country," lying to the
westward of the marshes of the latter. It must, however, be
acknowledged that, in effecting this service, Captain Sturt has
added largely to the geographical knowledge which we previously
possessed, since the facts ascertained by him during the progress
of his expedition have enabled him to fill up no inconsiderable
blank on the map of that part of New South Wales lying to the west
and south-west of Port Jackson. That the expedition of this
enterprising officer has opened to the settler "unmeasurable tracts
of well-watered" country previously unknown, as stated in the
report of a society in the colony already referred to, his dispatch
to the local government does not in the slightest degree support;
nor does it contain the announcement to the colonists, that a
river, navigable for commercial purposes, has been discovered in
that country, which can be available at some future day "to convey
to the coast the wools and other exportable produce" of the
settlers, who may hereafter be established in those parts of the
interior which lie in the neighbourhood of its banks. The reverse
is the fact. The Murray, when flooded from the eastward, will
doubtless carry a boat safely down its channel, but as a navigable
river at all seasons, it is, like the Macquarie, and indeed every
other western stream, useless to the colonists. Even if the Murray
were throughout the year, and during the driest seasons, a deep
navigable river, its waters could not be rendered of use for the
purposes of commerce, since it discharges itself into a shoal lake,
and that again into the sea at Encounter Bay, where, although the
passage is, as Captain Sturt states, "at all periods of the tide,
rather more than a quarter of a mile in width, and of sufficient
depth for a boat to enter," still, as he also observes, and the
master of every coaster well knows, "a line of dangerous breakers,"
which are constantly rolling against the sand-bars thrown up by the
prevalent winds, "will always prevent an approach to the lake from
the sea, excepting in the calmest weather; whilst the bay itself
will at all times be a hazardous place for any vessel to enter
under any circumstance." The opinion also, which has been
entertained, that a more practicable communication with the lake
might be found from the Gulf of Saint Vincent is wholly gratuitous,
for a reference to the voyage of Captain Flinders, who closely
examined the shores of that deep bight, and an inspection of the
chart of that able navigator (the accuracy of which, generally, no
seaman ever doubted who had sailed by it), on which is laid down a
range of wooded hills, extending from the promontory of Cape Jervis
northerly, along the whole of the eastern shore of the gulf, are
sufficient for us rather to entertain every doubt of the existence
of such a channel of communication with the north-western bay of
the lake, which is itself, in all probability, nothing else than an
extensive mudshoal.</p>

<p>I have now given the sum of our geographical knowledge of New
South Wales up to the present period; and dividing the map of that
vast country into seven equal parts, one division will fully
include the tracks of all the journeys which have been undertaken
since 1817, with a view to discovery, by Oxley, Sturt, Hovell and
Hume, myself, and others; whilst the remaining six portions, which
comprehend a great expanse of interior beyond the tropic, and the
whole of the equinoctial part of the continent, continue, at this
day, a vast region, entirely unknown. The want of navigable rivers
in that "Great South Land", must necessarily impede the progress of
discovery in the interior of the country.</p>

<p><i>October 2</i>, 1824.&mdash;At 1 p.m. loaded the cart with the
provisions and all things necessary for our intended journey, being
a supply for four months, viz., 640 lbs. flour, 200 lbs. pork, 100
lbs. sugar, 14 lbs. tea, 8 lbs. tobacco, 12 lbs. soap, salt,
coffee, etc., etc., etc., for myself and three men, together with a
musket and ammunition for each man. This is exclusively for
ourselves, as Mr. Hume has supplied (as I understand) the same
quantity.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 3rd October.</i>&mdash;At 1 p.m. left Mr. Hume's
house in company with his cart; at 4 o'clock crossed the Cowpasture
River, and commenced measuring our distance by perambulator.
Weather fine, but very hot considering the time of the year.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 16th November.</i>&mdash;At half an hour after
sunrise we were away, and at the end of 3&frac12; miles (7 o'clock) we
suddenly arrived at the bank of a very fine river, at least two
hundred feet wide, apparently deep, with the bank about eight or
nine feet above the level which is overflowed at the time of a
flood, and the stream running about three knots per hour. On both
sides the land is low and level, and consists of a fine alluvial
soil, with grass up to our middle. This I named Hume's River, lie
being the first that saw it. As we could not cross here, we
followed its course to the distance of 3&frac12; miles, making seven miles
in all, and stopped to breakfast. Between 2 and 3 o'clock we set
out with the intention to follow the course of the river, to find a
crossing place, but we had not proceeded far before we found that
impossible, as all between the river and the high land are lagoons
and swamps to the distance of about two miles back. We had
therefore to keep back to the high land, and came to at the foot of
a hill alongside the river, and, at the end of ten miles, myself
and Mr. Hume went to the top of the hill to see if there was any
place down the river where it was likely there would be a fall, or
crossing place. From south to west is a range, at about the
distance of sixty miles, under which I think a river runs. It is
all a flat level country in front of us, say, west. This river, as
far as we can see it, bore W. by S., and I think I may venture to
say it afterwards runs W.N.W., the land there appearing the lowest.
The flax plant grows in common here, and there is also a peppermint
plant, different but superior to the English. Wild duck are
numerous; some we shot. Caught one fish, the same as the Lachlan
River fish, and one of another description, different to any that
has been seen before in the Colony (as Mr. Hume informs me). I
think, from what I can recollect of the tench, these and they are
sworn brothers. Got the skin of a very large black snake; the snake
itself must have been at least eight feet Ion, as the skin is fully
six. The bell-bird is common here. The natives frequently resort
here, and I have no doubt are numerous, as fish are plentiful, both
in the river and lagoons. It appears they are caught in dams where
there is a running stream, as there is one they have made now in
front of us. They are driven into the dam by the natives at one
end, which is closed up when they think they have got sufficient.
They are made intoxicated (as is usually done near to the sea coast
about the Five Islands) by the bark of the willow tree, which they
throw on to the place. By this they are supposed to be brought to
the top. The natives then get into the water and throw them out.

tree I cut my name, "Hovell, Novr. 17/24."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 17th November.</i>&mdash;As we did not know where
we could cross the river, we thought it advisable to let the cattle
remain, and myself, Mr. Hume, and two men to follow the course of
the river down, to seek for a crossing place. We therefore started
about 7 o'clock for that purpose; but we found that to keep along
its banks was impossible, as the lagoons and swamps in most places
completely shut us out, some of them forming a half circle, the
centre part extending to a distance of two miles and the two ends
coming to this river. Many of these creeks are as wide as the river
itself, therefore we only got to the river in two places until we
got to the distance of about eight or nine miles. Here the river
appeared to us as it did when we first saw it, but if at all
different, it is with a more majestic appearance, it being rather
wider, the banks more open and regular, and their height being
about eight feet, over which I think the flood seldom comes (at
least I saw no appearance of it here, but I may be mistaken). The
timber near the river is blue gum (as Hume assures me). But the
timber at a distance from the river, where the soil is not so good,
is box tree; the whole is very thin. In many parts there is very
little more than sufficient to give it a handsome appearance. The
grass is of a good quality, as well as the soil, and of all parts
of the Colony I have seen, this has the advantage for feeding pigs
or cattle, and if the banks are overflowed at times, there is high
land at a short distance for them to retire to. This river, like
the last two, is deficient in either swamp oak or appletree. As we
f found that it would be impossible to cross the river in any part
we had seen without a good boat, sufficient to keep up the heads of
the cattle, we propose going towards the mountains, where perhaps
we may find it practicable to cross, as it is not unlikely but we
may find two rivers instead of one. If it so happens that we cannot
cross it at all, it is our intention to follow it down for at least
one hundred miles. If circumstances will admit, I should like much
to start from where we now are for that purpose, but as we have one
object now in view, and which we set out for the purpose of
carrying into effect, if at all possible, we are anxious to
accomplish that desire, if <i>practicable</i>. If not, we will
endeavour to follow his Excellency's directions, viz., that should
we on our journey fall in with any extensive river (which he had no
doubt we should) that we could not cross, to trace it down for some
distance. But which of the two objects hereafter may attend to the
greatest advantage, time must show.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 18th November.</i>&mdash;Every morning at the first
dawn of day, and often before the birds themselves, we are on the
move, and by the time we have everything packed up, bullocks and
horses loaded, it is generally about half an hour after sunrise; by
so doing we can get half our day's work over by 9
o'clock&mdash;before the heat of the day comes on, and about 2
p.m., we are ready to start again. This was the case to-day, and we
arrived at the place where we first made the river on the 16th
inst. Here we got breakfast. The river at this place we find to be
eighty yards, according to our measurement by throwing a stone. At
2 p.m. we proceeded on to follow the course of the river up, but at
the end of about three miles in an easterly direction we came to
the river again. Here the river was as wide as any part we had
seen, with a fine level forest on the opposite side, and with its
course about N.E. and S.W. I have no doubt now, from what I could
see from the top of the hill adjoining the river, but all the
waters we passed hitherto running to the southward all fall into
this, and that the river itself comes from an opening in the Snow
Mountains. The country all around us has a very fine appearance. In
some places there is not more than half a dozen trees in a hundred
acres. The swamps and creeks back in the river here are the same as
lower down, and in some future day will be valuable to those that
may come to reside here. They are full of fish and wild ducks. We
also saw two black swans on one of the creeks, being the first we
have seen since leaving home.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 19th November.</i>&mdash;Throughout the day the
weather has been very pleasant. At the usual time we started, and,
having arrived at a place where we thought we could cross the
river, we stopped to breakfast rather earlier than usual. As this
place did not appear to me to be safe for our cattle to cross, I
took one man and our horses with me to trace the river higher up,
to endeavour to find one more suitable for our purpose, and having
gone a few miles we found a place where the current is not so
strong, being more broken by rocks above us, the river not more
than half the width, and the banks not so steep. But how we are to
contrive to make a boat to take our provisions across (having no
cart with us now) I am as yet at a loss to say, as the only
tarpaulin we have with us is going to pieces, and the bark will not
strip off the trees this time of the year. At 3 P.M. we started
again and arrived at the crossing place (at least the place we
propose for that purpose) by 5 o'clock, the whole distance we have
travelled to-day being only 7&frac12; miles.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 20th November.</i>&mdash;Throughout the day the
weather was very pleasant, and favourable for the purpose we had to
carry into effect, for having determined overnight to cross the
river to-day, if practicable, we commenced first to patch up my
tarpaulin, the only one we have with us; and having done it to our
satisfaction, we then made a frame (neither round nor square), the
bow being something narrower than the stem, and made something
after the shape of one I had before made when wrecked at Kent's
Group, Bass Straits, in the year 1816. We then put the tarpaulin
over the frame, as we had before done by the cart. At 11 o'clock we
began to send the articles across, and by 4 p.m. horses, bullocks,
etc., etc., were over, but it was nearly with the loss of Mr.
Hume's bullock. At 5 o'clock we left the banks of the river and
travelled 2&frac12; Miles into the forest before dark. The river on this
side is encircled by creeks, lagoons and swamp, the same as on the
other, and it is but seldom that we can come near it. All the back
land is of an excellent quality, and I think, from the little I
have seen of it, I may venture to say it is superior to the soil on
the other, and the grass, of course, will also have the advantage.
We found in crossing all the other rivers that the waters, as well
as the creeks which ran either to the northward or westward were
all of them very cold, but this river, as well as the creeks which
ran to the southward or eastward, are altogether as warm. How to
account for it, I am not equal to the task. I should have thought
this river in particular would have been cold, as we have every
reason to believe that most of the streams which fall into it must
come from the Snow Mountains range, which forms a part of the
Australian Alps.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 21st November.</i>&mdash;About the usual time we
started in hopes that we should be able to make up for the lost
time which this river had occasioned, not even allowing ourselves a
Sunday, knowing that we had no time to spare. But we had not
travelled more than a mile and a half (or four miles from the
other) through swamps, etc., before we came to the banks of a sixth
river, its width being 110 feet from the water's edge. The stream
was equally as strong as the other river, but it was not so deep,
and the cattle crossed with little difficulty. But we had to make
another boat, the same as before, to get our provisions, etc.,
etc., across, and by noon we were ready to start again. Having had
some little trouble to get out from the side of the river, through
the swamps, lagoons, etc., we kept a course S.W. over a range and
descended on the other side, where we came to other lagoons, which
plainly showed that another river was at hand. At the distance of
about four miles, we had for our comforts to cross another river,
its width being about the same as the other, its current the same
also, but in what part of the Hume they come into I can only judge.
But I think this comes in below, and the last one above, where we
first made that river. The banks of both are not more than six or
seven feet, and there is every proof that all the lagoons and
rivers are in the time of flood one immense sheet of water, perhaps
not less than two miles in some places, in others more. It is quite
clear that there is only one range of mountains or hills between
each of those rivers. The first appeared to come from the N.N.E.,
(Perhaps after N.E.) the second S.E. and this south. The one we
crossed yesterday was a rocky bottom, but those two are pebbly
bottom. The natives are numerous here, but we have not seen any,
only their smoke. There is little doubt but they have seen us. Shot
two native companions and ducks, and caught some of the Lachlan
River fish out of both those. We have caught no perch, only out of
the ponds.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 22nd November.</i>&mdash;In the middle of the day the
weather was very warm, but the morning and evening cool and
pleasant. As it was too late last night to get everything across
the river, we did not begin to do so until this morning, and as a
very large tree had fallen across the river, which reached from
bank to bank, with the body out of the water, we fastened a rope
from one side to the other as a hand rope, and it saved us the
trouble of making another boat, for upon this tree we carried
everything across. As our cattle have become so used to the water,
we have no trouble (to what we had at first) to cross any of the
streams, unless they are very strong, as for instance the
Murrumbidgee. This, and the last, they crossed at one and the same
time by being strung together by one rope. By the time the first
bullock has foothold on the opposite side, the last is about going
in. As for my mare, she wants no rope, for she feels as much
pleasure in swimming about in the water as we do ourselves when we
got into the water for that purpose. By half-past eight we had
everything over, got our breakfast, and were ready to proceed on
our journey. After getting out from between the creeks, etc., we
kept our course S.W. between two ranges, which appeared favourable
for that purpose, and at the end of six miles, it being half-past
eleven, we came to for two or three hours. The land is of the same
quality as that which is already described, as is the grass also;
but the flax plant is, in my opinion, superior to any I have seen
in the Colony, the length being from 4&frac12; to 5&frac12; feet. I think the
natives make use of it for different purposes. At the end of 10&frac12;
miles, it being 6 o'clock, we stopped for the night, having got to
the end of the opening, we took the bearing in the morning. The
land which we have passed through this afternoon is something of a
mountain forest&mdash;I cannot call it good. In parts the grass is
long and of the same description as grows on the sides of
mountains; but where there is moisture, the grass is better.</p>

<p>We have seen no limestone since the 15th inst., at the Limestone
Falls, nor have I seen any stone that contains any part of it.
Nearly all the stone that we have seen since that time is granite.
The timber is principally stringy-bark and very good. There is
every appearance by the marks on those trees where they have taken
the bark off, that it has been cut by an iron tomahawk. I suppose
they have communication with the coast natives, as they can have no
other way of obtaining them but through that channel, as the
distance from any station is too great for them to procure them by
that means. The bronzewing pigeon is not so common here as with us,
but the black and white cockatoos and the parrots are, as also the
quail. And where there is water, the curlew and the snipe are seen.
It is now the season for the swans and other waterfowls to bring
out their young ones. The flesh of the native companions, when
boiled, resembles beef, both in appearance and flavour, but there
is no fat. We killed one kangaroo this afternoon, being the first
for several days.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 23rd November.</i>&mdash;For the first three miles
this morning we crossed several ends of ranges, when we came to a
forest of good grass, but the ground not of a very good quality,
but thinly covered with timber, which is excellent stringy bark and
box gum. At 10 a.m. stopped to breakfast beside a spring of water,
and at the distance of 6&frac12; miles. At 3 p.m. we started again and
travelled 5&frac12; miles further (making in all 11&frac12; miles, S.W.) and
stopped at the foot of the last high range we had but a little
before ascended and descended again, beside a fine running stream
of cold water. All the land we have gone over this afternoon is of
a more inferior quality than that which we passed over this
morning, and in parts worse than any land we have seen since
leaving home. The appearance of the country to the westward is low,
with few or no hills. To the S.W. it appears like the end of ranges
falling off to a level; but to the eastward immense mountains
appear to view. I find, whenever we come near the mountains, we are
plagued by the devil fly and the mosquito&mdash;we cannot rest for
them now, unless we get into a cloud of smoke, and the remedy is
nearly as bad as the evil. I think the snakes are not numerous, as
we have not seen more than one these last few days.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 24th November.</i>&mdash;We started about 6 this
morning, our course being S.W. through a forest country nearly on a
line with the mountains, till we got to the distance of about five
miles, when we came to a running stream of water. We had now to
ascend a very high hill, the north side of which, and another at a
little distance, were quite clear of trees, growing only brushwood;
but the tops were very thick of timber. On getting to the top we
found it to be a dividing range, from which we had a fine view. On
the east side, all mountains&mdash;I suppose a continuation of the
Australian Alps&mdash;on the north, the country we had passed
through; on the west, similar to what I described on the 17th
instant. On the south side an opening appeared through which we
shall have to pass, and which I have no doubt the waters, which we
see below us, run also. This creek comes from the east, and I
suppose we shall find hereafter that it runs into the Hume. All
below us, from east to the foot of the mountains around, is a large
open forest through the middle of which the creek runs. The land is
dry and parched up by the drought; the grass is dry also. Beside
this nearly dry creek, we stopped to breakfast, having travelled 71
miles by 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. proceeded on through a pleasant country, but we see it
now at a great disadvantage. It is quite level, the grass tolerably
good, and some very fine timber. At 6 o'clock, and at 4&frac12; miles from
where we last started, we came to the north bank of the eighth
river. The width where the river is at its usual height, is
something wider than the last two we crossed, but as it is low I
think we shall be able to cross it without the trouble of making a
boat. I think from appearances that it is at times flooded. The
land adjoining is exceedingly good, and is without the scrubs,
lagoons and swamps to which the last three are subject. The timber
which grows on its banks is thin, but of good quality. The land
could be cleared at a very little expense. There are fine hills and
grass land in the back. In my opinion it is as pretty a spot and as
valuable as any I have seen since leaving home. But we cannot judge
to what extent it runs, as the bush is all on fire around us.
Consequently our view is obstructed. The river comes from the east.
From the mountains which now appear to us in that direction, I have
no doubt that the Hume and this join, but it will be at some
distance to the westward from us. Which will be the leading river
time must shew. I have named it the Ovens, in compliment to Major
Ovens. My friend (Hume) has just ventured an opinion, that he is
sure all those rivers empty themselves into the sea, but he does
not say whether an inland sea or the ocean. My opinion is that they
empty themselves, first into one immense lake, and the waters from
the lake are carried off into the ocean in the N.E. or S.W. coasts,
as part of the coast, in these directions, is low. The land in a
N.W. direction, whenever we can see it to advantage from the top of
a mountain, always appears the lowest part around. Whenever the
journey is undertaken to determine that which now appears a
mystery, and there is a problem to solve, I have no doubt but it
will be pleasant one, if they follow the north side of the Hume, as
there does not appear to be any mountains, as I before mentioned in
that part, in the westerly direction. Mr. Hume calls the timber
here the Bong Bong Gum.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 25th November.</i>&mdash;We found very little
trouble in crossing the Ovens, as it has fallen so very low, that
it was fordable in many parts. The one we took had not more than
three feet of water upon it, and it being of a pebbly bottom, it
occasioned little trouble or delay, as the cattle crossed it with
their load upon their backs, notwithstanding the current being
strong at the falls. I think the banks of the river are higher than
the last two we crossed, but it is not so subject to be flooded as
either of the others, although there are evident marks of its being
flooded at times. The land at the back is as good as on the other
side. It was here we saw the flax plant growing in perfection, its
length being six or seven inches longer than a soldier's musket. It
is here also we saw the honeysuckle growing. Wherever we find the
honeysuckle and the grass tree in this country we find the land to
be good. A mountain with snow upon it bore S.E. about fifteen or
twenty miles&mdash;a singular looking mount, but on this side of
the above, which we call Mount Buffalo S.E. At the distance of five
miles in the same range, but further west, we had another view of a
fine level country all to the west, in parts as far as the eye
could reach, particularly N.W. The country south from us does not
appear to be so mountainous as hitherto. All the country from where
we started this morning is all burned, and in every direction the
bush is all on fire.</p>

<p>At 4 we started and, having gone a short distance, came to a
creek of fine running water which runs to the northward. For the
most of the afternoon we have been crossing the ends of ranges to
keep our course. Some of them, one a complete mass of stones
apparently as if they had been heaped together for the purpose,
which make it very bad for the feet of the poor beasts. From one of
the hills we had a fine view of the country to the southward.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 26th November.</i>&mdash;At half past 5 o'clock this
morning we proceeded on again, keeping a course of about S.W. by S.
for a hill of which we took the bearing yesterday, and keeping a
range of forest hills on the north side of us. All the land below
those hills is of a good quality, and has a good coat of grass. The
timber is stringy-bark and fine gum, and a description of manna
tree. At the distance of 11 miles from where we started, we came to
a creek of fine running water, and, from appearances, we were sure
a river was at hand. I was not wrong in my conjecture, for at the
distance of about half a mile we came to the banks of the ninth
river. As we fortunately hit upon a good crossing place, we were
not delayed much in doing it. The banks of this river are not more
than five or six feet, the width from twenty to thirty; it has very
little current, only at the falls; the water is very low at this
time, but is occasionally flooded. It comes from the southward, and
I have no doubt that at some distance further to the N.N.W. the
Ovens and it join, but as that river is the largest it is into that
it will fall. At the distance of 4&frac14;, miles we came to the top of a
range which gave us a fine view of the country to the north of us.
All in that direction appeared a fine, open level country, the
grass green, and here and there a plain, but seldom of any great
extent.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 27th November.</i>&mdash;Started about 6 o'clock.
From the appearance of the morning I thought we should have a
change of weather, as the morning was cloudy and threatened rain;
but it was all deception. For a few hours the sun was intolerably
hot, and as our whole time has been employed in ascending and
descending five different ranges, all stones, bad soil and brush,
we felt the heat much more than we should have otherwise done had
the road been good or level. By the time we had got to the distance
of 6&frac12; miles, it being half-past 10 o'clock, the cattle were quite
exhausted, and the men fatigued. There being a run of water near
us, but very little or no grass, we came to. Our object in crossing
these ranges is, first, that we think as we get to the southward
the ranges may not be so high; secondly, there appears to be a
division in the ranges; and, thirdly, that a river must come from
that opening, and we are anxious to ascertain its course and
extent.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 28th November.</i>&mdash;As the place we stopped at
last night did not afford enough grass for our cattle for to-day,
we left it early this morning to seek a better place, and having
got to the top of the range, a plain and meadow appeared in front
of us, but not of any great extent. This hill also offered us a
good view of the country to the N.W. It appears here, as it has
always done, viz., level forest country, with here and there a
plain, one of which bore N. 20 deg. W. To the S.W. the ranges lie
quite across our course. We descended the range and crossed the
swamp, which we before thought was a plain, and at the distance of
four miles we stopped, as the place afforded good grass. This place
appears to be the same as all the other meadows where the division
of the ranges is of any extent, viz., always a run of water towards
the top,&mdash;swampy, with reeds growing. As the ranges run to the
N.W. they fall off with a gentle slope, as they become level, And,
of course, there is a greater extent of forest as the ranges come
to an end; and from being a swamp, it becomes dry, good land fit
for any purpose.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 29th November.</i>&mdash;About the usual time this
morning we started, keeping a course as near S.W. as circumstances
would permit. Most part of the ground we passed near this morning
is of a very good quality and the quality of timber always denotes
it. Some of the soil is a complete scarlet colour, the stone from
which it is composed is of the same colour. The trees were mostly
honeysuckle, manna and cow-pasture box. At the distance of 5&frac34; miles
we crossed a creek which runs N.W.; here we rested. At 4 o'clock
got under way and crossed another range, the whole of which appears
as if it had been turned topsy-turvy. There is scarcely one stone
lying upon another; the whole is separated and divided, and lying
in irregularly sized pieces. Nor can I tell which way the strata
formerly lay; the whole is coarse granite, the soil good below.
After descending the hill we crossed a creek, and came to a second,
the waters of both running to the N.W. Here we remained for the
night, with abundance of good grass for our cattle. It will not be
improper to remark here that, whatever place we have been in,
whether on the top of the highest mountain, or in any of the
deepest ravines, we always find evident marks that the natives
occasionally resort to them, although there does not appear to be
any inducement for them to visit those secluded places. Those are
the people we generally call "miserable wretches", but in my
opinion the word is misapplied, for I cannot for a moment consider
them so. They have neither house-rent nor taxes to provide, for
nearly every tree will furnish them with a house, and perhaps the
same tree will supply them with food (the opposum). Their only
employment is providing their food. They are happy within
themselves; they have their amusements and but little cares; and
above all they have their liberty.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 1st December.</i>&mdash;Towards daylight this
morning the weather was very cold, so much so that we could not
keep ourselves warm in bed, and with all the clothes we could put
on us. It is true we were elevated much above our usual height, and
the wind was at S.W. At daylight the thermometer stood at 41 deg.
in the tent, but it must have been much lower before that time. At
sunrise the weather, which before had threatened rain, had now
altered its appearance, and we moved off at our usual time. But
previous to our descending from that high range, we got a view of
the country around from an adjoining hill. Towards the east there
appeared to be a forest country, flat, and extending along on each
side of what I suppose to be the banks of a river. There are also
three plains, the nearest about four miles from us, the farthest
about twelve. There is also a gap in the mountains which appear to
surround this place, the which I suppose to be the opening where
the river runs through to the eastward or takes its rise farther to
the eastward, and comes to where we think we shall fall in with a
river to the S.W. of us, as there are two ranges, in that direction
(both very high, but the farthest much the highest) between which
we think the river comes. The country S.E. to south is completely
broken, so much so as any we have seen. It is only to the N.W. the
country looks at all favourable. At the distance of one mile in
descending this range, we had to unload to get the cattle across a
creek. We had then to ascend another range, and descend again to
another creek, where we stopped to breakfast, at the distance of 4&frac34;
miles. As two of our dogs which went in chase of a kangaroo had not
returned this morning we did not think it advisable to proceed
without first sending in search of them, and three men were sent
for that purpose, but returned a little before sundown without
having seen the least trace of them. Our best missing dog had also
been away, but just returned wounded by the feet of a kangaroo. We
have now only one dog, and him so very low in condition from not
having had animal food so long that he is now unable to run, but
more likely to die.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 2nd December.</i>&mdash;We were surprised this
morning on rising to find that one of the dogs had returned some
time in the night. He was a little cut by a kangaroo. At half-past
five this morning we set off. At two miles we came to a meadow with
a creek running through the centre. We continued our course S.W.
through a good forest country till we got to the distance of 5&frac12;
miles, when we were obliged to stop, as the natives had set the
grass on fire in the direction we wanted to go, and we were
doubtful whether we should find grass for our cattle if we passed
this place, where it is plentiful, and good water. A little after
we stopped the other dog returned. 'They had every appearance that
they had killed the kangaroo, and had been lying by it till they
had filled themselves. About 2 o'clock we left this place as the
smoke and fire had passed by us and the weather was pleasant for
travelling. On getting to the top of the hill, about one mile from
where we last started, we observed that a gap, which on Tuesday
last bore S.E. by S. but now bore S. 35 deg. W., would be
favourable for us to pass between if we could get to it, and there
was every appearance of a river passing through, and forest hills
adjoining it. To this we directed our course, and, having ascended
the ranges, we found the country alter, in our opinion for the
better; but in this whole country the grass for miles around was
burnt. Therefore we saw it at a very great disadvantage. Having
travelled thirteen miles this day, and the sun being nearly set, we
at length came to a spot of about two acres where the grass had
escaped the fire. Here we remained all night, beside some
waterholes. I should have observed before that in all the holes of
water (where the stream is not strong) we have always found leeches
of a very large size and fit for medical purposes.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 3rd December.</i>&mdash;Started very early this
morning, but it was not till we had got the distance of four or
five miles through the burnt grass, following the course of the
creek down, when we got to the end, that it brought us within a
short distance of the river (eight miles) which runs N.W. On one
side of the creek is a sort of meadow, but the whole is a fine
pleasant country. The soil, being good, produces abundance of fine
grass and the whole, both hills and lowlands, are thinly covered
with timber. It is our opinion that we have not seen a more
agreeable and interesting country since leaving home. At 5 p.m. we
came to the banks of the river and found a place where we could
cross upon a tree, without the trouble of making a boat. But it
will require some trouble to make a road to the water to get the
cattle over, as also to carry the provisions, as the banks are at
least twelve feet and perpendicular. This river is as wide as the
Hume where we first made it, say, eighty yards, but the current is
not so strong. The creeks and lagoons back into the river, but in
some parts the south end of the high ranges comes close to the side
of the river, thereby making it impossible to pass between with
cattle. Here we remained all night and prepared for carrying our
things across in the morning. Caught some of the Lachlan River
fish. This river we named the Goulburn, in compliment to Major
Goulburn. Killed one kangaroo.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 4th December.</i>&mdash;Before breakfast we had all
our provisions, etc., etc., across the river, and after breakfast
the bullocks and horses were swum over, and at 10 o'clock we
proceeded on our journey. Having got through the swamps and creeks,
which were nearly one mile from the river, we ascended a range the
foot of which came close to a creek, the same as on the other side.
We continued our course S.W. through agreeable and picturesque
country, soil good, a good coat of grass, but at present dried up
in consequence of the drought, and only here and there trees, just
enough to answer as a shade for cattle on a warm day. I think the
fine dry hills have less timber upon them than the flats. At the
distance of seven miles from the Goulburn we suddenly arrived at
the banks of another river, but although it was only a small one
when compared with the other, yet it gave us nearly as much trouble
in getting our things across, which we did by means of a tree lying
across it. But we had much more trouble with our cattle, as we had
to let every one swim over separately. This was occasioned by the
depth of water, broken trees, and a mud-bank to land them upon on
the opposite side. After crossing it we loaded again and got to the
edge of the forest distant about one mile, where we stopped for the
night, it being sundown before we arrived here.</p>

<p>In all our travels I have seen no country better adapted for
feeding sheep, the hills adjoining the Goulburn River being nearly
clear of timber, grass to the top, and in the hollows below an
abundance of herbage of a very excellent quality.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 7th December.</i>&mdash;At the rise of the sun this
morning we set off to cross some ranges which were in front of us,
and at the distance of 2&frac14; miles we came to a creek, or river, which
receives the waters from the mountains to the east of us. The
stream runs very strong, but we found a good place to cross; it has
a pebbly bottom and at times rises very high. It was here we first
saw any king parrots since leaving home. From that circumstance we
named the water King Parrot Creek. After leaving this we ascended a
very high range full of stones, which made it very troublesome for
the cattle to get up with their loads, and it was 9 o'clock before
we got to the top; and for our trouble we found that we should have
to descend it again, as there was no range leading from this to the
one opposite, which was much higher than the one we were then upon.
As we considered by getting upon the other, we should find a
communication from range to range, by what we call cross ranges,
and if so we could cross the mountains to the opposite side, we
descended again, and stopped at a run of water below to breakfast.
Here we remained for about two hours and then commenced our task of
ascending the mountain in front of us. After two hours' hard
labour, not so much for ourselves as for the cattle, we arrived at
the top. Here we were put to our wit's end to know in what
direction to proceed, as the brush was so thick (we could not see
ten yards before us); the consequence was we were obliged to go by
guess and to keep two men in front cutting away the brushwood f or
the cattle to pass through. This we had to do for about 1&frac14; miles,
and as the night was fast approaching, we found it necessary to
stop for the night, as both cattle and men were fatigued and could
not proceed any further. As there was neither grass nor water, we
had to make the beasts fast to trees, leaving them only room or
rope enough to lie down. As for ourselves, I think we felt the
greatest want of that necessary article, water, more than the
cattle, for, having been accustomed of late to so much good water,
we did not before know the value of that-principal support of life.
As I had given each man some spirits to drink with his bread, it
was the occasion of making them more thirsty than they would
otherwise have been, nor was this the only cause of their being
very uncomfortable, for as the top of the range was all stones,
there was not a place to be found that would admit of their lying
down at all with any comfort.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 8th December.</i>&mdash;It may be supposed that
owing to the miserable state we were in all night we were anxious
to move from the place which was the occasion of it. Therefore
before it was properly daylight we were on our legs, ready to
start, and having got to the distance of about 1&frac14; miles through the
brush which had to be cut for us to pass along, we found it
impossible to get any further in that direction, say, about south,
because of the closeness of the brush, dead timber lying in all
directions on the ground, and the large pieces of stone, which
crippled the feet of the cattle. Then we found it necessary to
descend the mountain again in an easterly direction, and make for
the King Parrot Creek. This we did, and, by 8 o'clock, we had got
nearly to the bottom. As also an agreeable run of water presented
itself for our acceptance, to us as well as the cattle, it was a
welcome stranger, for we had been nearly eighteen hours without
such a friend. At 9 o'clock we came to the banks of the King Parrot
Creek, which we crossed, and then stopped to breakfast.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 9th December.</i>&mdash;Before 6 o'clock this
morning, myself, Mr. Hume and two men, set out, taking a
sufficiency of flour, tea and sugar to last us for four or five
days. About 7 we began to ascend the Forlorn Hope Range, or
Doubtful Range. The reason for my giving it that name was that
yesterday I had paid particular attention to the soil of this and
the different mountains around, together with the timber, the scrub
and the stone. By doing so I found that they had all nearly one and
the same appearance. By this I judged that if the ranges and
mountains are of that quality on this side, doubtless they would be
the same on the other, and therefore judged it impossible to get
the cattle through, even if we were able to get through ourselves.
From my doubts on that head it was that I gave it that name.</p>

<p>At 10 we got to the top and crossed our track of yesterday. We
then began to descend gradually on the other side; but it was only
till now that we had seen anything of the difficulty of getting
through this thicket. Scrambling for about two hours, sometimes on
our hands and knees, at other times on the tops of bushes and
rocks, in this manner did we go on till 12 o'clock, when we arrived
at a spring of water, a distance of about two miles, where we
stopped to take a pot of tea and some bread. After we had finished
our humble meal we set forward again with hopes to find it better
on the range opposite us. But this was not the case, for, instead
of getting better, we found that it got worse, and, to add to this,
a grass known about the Five Islands by the name of the "Cutting
Grass", became more frequent. It runs here about four or five feet
long, the edges are as sharp as a butcher's knife, and its width
about one and a half inches. It is tough and strong, and should it
by any chance draw edgeways across the flesh, it will make a deep
incision in it, which afterwards will become very troublesome.
About 4 p.m. we got to the top of the other range, but without any
appearance of a change for the better, and, from what we could see
from a high stump where a tree had been broken off, the general
appearance was the same all around. We now thought that to continue
going forward would be madness, as we could not, in the first
place, form any idea where it would end, and, in the second place,
if we went on much farther, we should not have a rag left upon our
backs. We therefore thought it the most advisable plan to retrace
our steps towards home (the tent) and, having arrived at a small
run of water a little before dark, we took up our abode for the
night, having gone nearly four miles into the scrub, our whole
distance from the station to where we returned to sleep being about
fourteen miles. To describe this brush or scrub is almost
impossible, as it cannot be compared with any that is known in the
Colony. Suffice it to say that it is worse than any that is known
in it, or worse than any jungle in any other country. It is much
worse than the scrub at the Five Islands, for there, if you cannot
get over it, you can get under it, and can see your road before
you; but here we could not see either over or under, nor two yards
before. Sometimes we were on the top of dead logs, lying five or
six feet above the ground, at other times in holes fully as deep,
and had we been seen coming into a town in the state we were in,
people would have sworn that we had been in some drunken affray.
Mr. Hume had his face so nearly covered with the brambles and
boyers that it appeared as if it had been done by the fair hand of
some Amazonian damsel; and myself had an eye that would have done
honour to any young gentleman taking his first rudiments in that
admirable art, pugilism. But worse than all was one of the men that
had got on the only pair of trousers among three men. He had got an
unfortunate tumble, which not only took away every part of his
trousers, but the front flap of his shirt also, thereby leaving him
in that state that, had there been any doubt of his manhood before,
these doubts were now removed.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 10th December.</i>&mdash;There is nothing will make a
man forget the quality or the harshness of the bed he is lying upon
more than being well fatigued. It is ten chances to one but he will
lie down and fall asleep without once thinking to put on his
nightcap. This was the case with me, for having made choice of the
softest place I could find, I ate my piece of bread and drank my
quart of tea and fixed some boughs to break off the south wind,
when I laid myself down, as I thought to rest, not to sleep. But in
this I was mistaken, for I fell asleep, nor did I awake till the
morning. As soon as the sun was up we were up also, and set forward
to reach our tent, which we did by a little after 9 o'clock. The
fatigues of yesterday made our humble home acceptable to us. I have
now to express my regret that we have not been able to penetrate
through the brush across the range, as there would have been some
hopes of our being able to get to our place of destination in time,
and to have a sufficiency of flour left to return to Argyleshire
with. But now those hopes are banished, unless we find a country at
the west end of this range more favourable, judging from
appearances, than we can possibly expect. But should we be
fortunate enough to find good travelling, and at last to gain our
object, this will indeed be a great relief to our mind, as that
will do away with all doubts as to our exertions or endeavours to
gain the intended object. Having refreshed ourselves, we set
forward to our journey about 2 o'clock, following the course of the
King Parrot Creek down.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 12th December.</i>&mdash;Before 5 o'clock this
morning we were under way. Our motive for setting off so early was
that, by the time the sun got up, it was likely the wind would rise
also and prevent us from crossing the burning grass and scrub,
which was still in the track we wanted to go. At the distance of
eight miles (9 o'clock) the land began to change its appearance for
the better, being gently sloping hills covered with grass, the soil
good, and thinly covered with stringy-bark and gum trees. Should
Fortune, that fickle-minded jade, but favour us in our one grand
object, (to us it is so, having set our mind and our whole soul
upon the thing,) she will then have recompensed us for all our
troubles and difficulties when crossing the mountains, nor shall I
care, living upon bread and water, and that but half allowance on
my return, so long as I gain the object. At 5 we stopped, having
travelled 12&frac12; miles, beside a creek which we call Sunday Creek.
Some part of the land we passed over this afternoon is not so good
as that which we passed over a little before we stopped in the
forenoon, but it produces good grass. From the hill I before
mentioned, we could see that the country is on fire in all
directions. This appears to be the season for their burning the old
grass to get new. The country to the westward is high, inclining to
the mountains; to the northward the land is low, through which the
Goulburn River runs. There appears to be a river (at least from
appearances of the land) ahead of us, which I have no doubt will
join the above river at some distance farther northward.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 14th December.</i>&mdash;Mr. Hume ascended a high
but single hill, in front, from which we saw a very gratifying
sight. This was a very extensive plain, extending from west to S.E.
for several miles with patches of forest which appear to separate
one plain from another. But the whole appeared in front, say,
south, to be level, but in parts in the plains, some hills rose, of
conical shape, with only here and there a few trees upon them, and
all of the soil of the best quality. At eight miles we had got to
the entrance of a forest and continued till we got to another hill
from which we had another gratifying sight. This was plains and
open forest, the latter serving to give the former a more beautiful
appearance. They stretched beyond the reach of the eye and as far
as we could see with the spy-glass, say, from S.E. to west, and the
land fell with a gradual descent towards the south. Never did I
behold a more charming and gratifying sight, at least not where it
is in its natural state. I have travelled from Launceston to Hobart
Town, but in the whole distance, I do not recollect seeing any one
place where it can at all be compared with the spot we have passed
and this before us. It perhaps may be supposed that I speak
interestedly, or beyond what it really deserves, but that is not
the case. I am always anxious to confine myself as near to truth as
possible, and in this case in particular, as some day not far
distant it might be proved that I had pictured it beyond what it
deserved, thereby making me ashamed of what I had made public.
After descending from the hill we went in search of water for
ourselves and cattle, but we had to travel twenty-one miles from
where we started this morning before we succeeded in getting any,
it being nearly sundown before we arrived at the creek.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 15th December.</i>&mdash;As the cattle were very
much fatigued from yesterday's journey, we did not start till after
breakfast, half past 8 o'clock, and having kept a course about
S.S.W. four miles, we came to a very deep creek, which I suppose,
lower down, becomes a river.</p>

<p>From where we now are, we can see at least fifty miles in any
direction. It is all plains and small forests around. The whole is
easy travelling. Should I be asked if I should, or would, come to
reside here, which is usually the question first asked when
recommending any place, my answer would be, yes, provided
encouragement is given to me, as is usually given to gentlemen
coming to reside among us as settlers under this Government. I have
been endeavouring to bring to recollection a resemblance of this
country to some counties in England, and of those I have seen the
nearest of any which I can bring to mind is that of the County of
Norfolk. That is supposed to be the most level county, and has the
best soil; and this at first view would appear level, but after
observing it closely you may perceive the gradual descent.</p>

<p>It has just occurred to my recollection that I have frequently
heard persons express their astonishment that, in such an extensive
country as this is, there is not a greater number of fine rivers
along the east coast, through Bass's Straits, etc., etc., than what
there is. We need not now wonder at the cause, when we come to
consider that all the rain which falls within fifty miles may, in
some of the places not more than twenty miles of the coast, run to
the N.W. and north. This will give an idea of the height of the
coast mountains, and the waters which come from the east side of
the Alps are joined by those which come from the west side of the
coast mountains, and are undoubtedly carried off by the
Murrumbidgee, the Hume and the Ovens, and the Goulburn, all to the
N.W. and north, except as far as about Cape Howe, when it is
carried off by the Yar through Western Port.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 16th December.</i>&mdash;After breakfast we carried
our provisions across the river, and afterwards crossed with the
cattle, which was done with very little trouble, as they were able
to walk across, and the water was only up to their bellies. This
river Mr. Hume called the Arndell, in compliment to the late Dr.
Arndell (the father of Mrs. Hovell) and to my son, Arndell Hovell.
We continued our course through the plains, about S.W. by S. and at
the distance of six miles we thought we saw the water, but at other
times we thought it was the grass on fire. Sometimes we thought we
could see the blaze, at other times the smoke; but this we
afterwards found was occasioned by the wind blowing in hard from
the N.W., which blew the heads of the billows, as it were, from us,
we being to windward. But as the plain was so perfect a level, and
had no high land at the back except at a very great distance, I was
enabled to get a meridian altitude, which gave the latitude 38 deg.
6 min. and longitude 145 deg. 25 min. E. We bore down nearly south,
and about 4 o'clock we could plainly perceive that that which we at
times thought was fire and smoke was the very thing we were so very
anxiously looking out for. At 5 o'clock we came to the point of
land which separates the S.E. from the N.W. branches. On this point
I took several bearings of the harbour (refer to bearing book).
From the place we were standing upon to the nearest land on the
opposite, but S.E. side, I think is not less than eight or ten
miles, and about the same distance to the west side. But higher up
the S.E. branch than where we stood it was one immense sheet of
water, and continued up as far as the eye could reach, and as I
thought up to an opening near to the south end of the Australian
Alps. Should there be water for shipping of a large tonnage up that
branch it is equal to any harbour I have seen, and it will be an
easy conveyance for timber for building, from those mountains, and
the one most recommended is Mount Disappointment. Into this branch
all the waters which we have crossed since coming upon the plains
empty themselves, and it will be the conveyance for the produce
coming through the Duke of York's Downs, which come up to the first
river we crossed from Mount Disappointment round to the Gap in the
Australian Alps. From this river to the Arndell River is Salamank
(? Salamanca) Plains, in compliment to his Excellency, who
distinguished himself in that action. From the Arndell up to
Kennedy's Creek is the Duke of Clarence's Downs. This creek comes
round the west end of Mount Wollstonecraft. I gave it that name for
the respect I have for the gentleman bearing its name. It is a very
conspicuous mountain, or rather it consists of a number of peaked
hills adjoining each other, particularly when it bears N. 50 deg.
W. (distance about five miles).</p>

<p>For the whole of the distance we have come since entering the
plains, I find very little difference in the appearance of the
country. There is a sameness throughout; the soil, generally
speaking, is everywhere good. I have seen none bad, but I have seen
some (I do not speak of a few acres, but of large spaces) equal to
the best of any land, and the grass and herbage denotes it.
Notwithstanding it is dried and parched by the long drought which
has shrivelled up the leaves, it is generally of a fine silky
nature, and in places is intermixed with the long forest grass. The
greatest deficiency this fair land has is that of timber. To make
it a delightful spot, what nature has been very sparing of here
must be supplied by artificial means. But I before observed there
are places or rather patches of trees which will answer for fuel,
and at the same time will be sufficient to hide its nakedness. On
the sides of the rivers and creeks there is plenty of gum, etc.,
etc. There are parts of the plains where it is very stony, some of
the stones weighing three or four cwts. Between them the grass
grows best, and is always dry. But there are parts for a
considerable distance where there is not a stone to be seen. From
Mount Wollstonecraft there are two or three ridges of stones, which
continue nearly to the water side, a distance of about six or seven
miles. At the same time they are very little above the level of the
other land.</p>

<p>On the beach are numerous beds of shells; therefore there can be
no want of lime, supposing there was no limestone to be found. But
in this I think there will be no deficiency, if the hills on the
Jullian range are examined. But here the earth which is below the
top soil may answer for the making of bricks. I am not able to
judge, as we have no spade to dig down sufficiently deep to tell
what quality of earth lies below.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 17th December.</i>&mdash;A little after 5 o'clock
this morning, we left this place (the place where we slept all
night) and kept our course by Kennedy's Creek till we came to fresh
water, a distance of about four or five miles from the extreme
point, which separates the two branches. As there was good grass
round the ponds, we remained here for the day, to refresh the
cattle, which since the time of our first coming into this country,
say, since last Monday, have had nearly double the work to do to
accomplish the object by the time stipulated. To-morrow is the day
fixed for our return, and we have only five weeks' ration of flour,
at 8&frac12; lbs. per man (instead of ten lbs.), and no meat, to travel
back the distance which has taken us eleven weeks to come. We have
to take the chances of the weather and should there be any change
which would occasion the rise of ten rivers, exclusive of Muddy and
King Parrot Creeks, and several others which we took no notice of
at the time. They would occasion us a great deal of trouble if once
filled with water. But we generally hope for the best.</p>

<p>A little after breakfast one of the men, Jas. Fitzpatrick, went
out with his gun a little way up the creek to shoot some ducks, but
he had not gone more than half a mile from our station when he
suddenly came within a short distance of two natives, whom, it
appeared, were either watching him, or were coming to watch us. As
soon as the man saw them he began to retreat, but they, on the
contrary, advanced, and having thrown off their cloak and with
their arms in their hands, gave chase. When the man saw their
hostile intentions, he turned round and snapped his pieces at one,
but it miss-fired. The only chance then left him was his heels,
which, being rather heavy, the lightness of the others gained upon
him. However the short distance we were from him enabled us to hear
him call for assistance, and as soon as the natives saw us they
retreated as fast as they had before advanced. About two hours
afterwards, as two of the men were going for a little firewood,
from among some standing trees, taking their arms with them, two
natives sprang from behind the tree, but seeing the men present
their guns at them, they made signs of peace, at the same time
calling out, as the men understood: "Good while ago, good while
ago." As Mr. Hume was not far off, and knew their manners, he also
made signs to them of peace. They laid down their arms, and at the
same time called out to our men to lay down theirs also. When this
was done they advanced, and, after a great deal of jabbering on
both sides (not a word either one or the other understood), they
came with us to the tent, and by degrees we began to understand
each other by signs. From this we understand that a vessel had
lately been in the bay, that they had been landing some things,
including something like my trunk, that the commander always
appeared in a bustle, and said to the men, "here, here," at the
same time pointing to them to come down, or put them down. They
described to us where the vessel laid. They also pointed towards
Port Phillip and indicated that they had seen the men fell trees at
that place; at the same time taking an axe, they described the way
they used them, not forgetting the grunt or hiss which the men
invariably do when they are striking anything with any force
(undoubtedly alluding to the time that a settlement was about to be
established there). The young man (who I understood was son-in-law
to the elder man) began at last to be very inquisitive, as well as
excessively troublesome, and by degrees to endeavour to secrete
small articles. (I should have observed before, that a third
native, son of the old man, had joined the other two) and
notwithstanding there were generally one or others looking after
him, yet he contrived to get away with several small but needful
articles. At least he had hid them, for he had them when he left
us. We afterwards found a tin pot and a spear, which he had buried
in the ground at some distance. Taking their conduct generally, it
appeared to all very suspicious and treacherous. They laughed about
running after the man, but I have not the least doubt that had they
got him they would have eaten a good part of him before we should
have thought of looking for him. It was my wish, as also that of
Mr. Hume, to have taken our horses to-morrow (the time the cattle
rest) and have gone across to Port Phillip. But after what had
passed, we did not consider it safe either to go or to leave the
cattle behind, and from the different signals which were being made
around us, we thought it better to abandon that plan, and to face
towards home tomorrow after breakfast. I see very little difference
between these men and those about Sydney, but their language is
quite different. Mr. Hume knows a little of the Jervis Bay
language, which he spoke to them, but they could not understand one
word. Their manners are the same, and they use the same kind of
weapon. By the largeness of their belly and their appearance they
seem to live well. The name of the bay where they said the vessel
lay is Geelong; Mount Wollstonecraft they call "Wibamanharter";
water is "Golamoo"; the name of a bird which Mr. Hume shot and
skinned (something of a diver) they call "Bonering"; dog is
"Narranuki"; bread is "Mumbungea." They did not appear to be
astonished at the sight of the horses and bullocks, but they were
very much afraid of them, much more so than they were of us, and
dreadfully alarmed if they saw the bullocks look towards them,
notwithstanding they were at a great distance from them. This fear
we encouraged, as we considered it the greatest security against
any attack. I have no doubt but this is the principal cause of our
not seeing any of the natives during the whole of our journey
before.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 18th December.</i>&mdash;By 7 o'clock this morning
we had the natives with us again with the addition of another, but
having shown our displeasure at their concealing the articles, they
did not move from the place where they first sat down (their wives,
children, and some other men remained at a little-distance in the
rear), they stopped until they saw the men bringing up the horses
and cattle to be harnessed, when they took a hasty leave and
retired. It was not till after they were gone that I missed a small
bag, which contained a number of very useful articles, and such as
I shall feel the want of before we get home. I had had it out the
evening before to get some trifles as presents to give them, but
not being satisfied with what I had given them, they watched where
I had laid it down, and took the first opportunity to conceal it
from our sight. At 9 o'clock we set off, and followed the creek
down part of the way which we had come the day before. This we did
purposely to fill our bottles with the water, and to get other
things necessary as a proof of our having been to Western Port.
Myself and Mr. Hume rode to the extreme point of land which
separates the two branches, to take another view of this fine bay
and harbour before we take our departure for home. I have already
spoken much in its praise. Should I say much more, it may be
thought I have said too much, I shall therefore leave the rest for
those that may be sent to survey both it and the country. When that
is done, I feel little fear of being contradicted in the account I
have given of either. By 10 a.m. we began to retrace our steps, but
kept nearer to the water than when we had come. By so doing we
avoided the stones which we before passed through, and about the
distance of fifteen miles we stopped for the night, beside
Dickson's Creek. This creek comes from Mount Wollstonecraft. Round
the edge of the salt water are numerous black swans and pelicans,
and other sea birds. On the downs are numbers of emus, native
companions, and Cape Barren geese. The emus run too fast to be
caught by our dogs. We have not seen, since leaving the small river
on this side of the Murrumbidgee, either the swamp or forest oak,
nor the apple tree; but the black or white thorn grows close to the
water's (sea) side on very rich soil. To the very top of Mount
Wollstonecraft is fine green grass, and many parts that we have
passed through to-day is fine young grass, notwithstanding the long
drought.</p>

<p>We shot a white cockatoo this morning, which differs somewhat
from those about Cumberland, both in their note, and in the shape
of the beak. They are white outside, but red underneath to the
skin. Last night we heard the roaring of the sea. I suppose at the
entrance.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 19th December.</i>&mdash;A little before we set out
this morning, say, ten minutes before eight, every man except Mr.
Hume, heard what they thought was a cannon gun. It appeared to come
from the bay, but the distance is very great, and I think too far
to be heard from there, notwithstanding the wind came from that
direction. Each man had a different conjecture, but each was
satisfied of the reality of the thing, at the same time regarding
it impossible to get near to where we supposed the vessel lay. Had
we been sure that there was one, we could not have got to the point
which separates Western Port from Port Phillip under three days;
and to have gone round to the eastward round that large sheet of
water (besides the rivers with which we must have expected to have
fallen in to have got to the bay) would have been a labour too
great, under the present circumstances, to have undertaken. Besides
there was the chance of her not being there when we arrived. We
kept a little nearer the water to look if there was anything to be
seen sailing in the bay. We took notice of two smokes on the south
side which the natives had made as signals to each other, after we
started. There was now some appearance of a change of weather,
which we may expect at the change of the moon, which will be
to-morrow evening. We continued our course about N. 25 deg. W. till
we arrived at the banks of the Arndell, which was at some distance
lower down than where we crossed it before. Having recrossed it we
kept a little up till we came to good feed for our cattle. Here we
stopped to kill a bullock, which we found impossible to take any
further. Poor old "Captain" had been our leader the whole distance
coming. From having to make a road for the others, besides carrying
his load, the great change of feed, and above all the cold weather,
which he felt very severely and which had struck to his limbs, he
became at last unable to walk. To leave him behind to be destroyed
by the natives I thought bad policy. As for any chance of his
getting home by himself there was not the least, the distance being
too great. But there was a greater reason for killing him
ourselves, viz., the men had now been without meat one week, and
had had only one kangaroo for a fortnight before that; and their
allowance of flour, as I before mentioned, has been reduced, they
were becoming very weak. Under all circumstances I thought it the
most advisable plan to kill him and eat him ourselves than to leave
it for the natives to do for us, or him. The water of the Arndell
is fresh as far as we have been down, which perhaps will be within
the distance of five or six miles from the bay. It was fortunate
for the men that I killed the bullock, as there are not more than
two that have shoes to their feet. Therefore the skin comes in for
mocassins for them, which answer the place of shoes.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 21st December.</i>&mdash;Having retraced our steps
to the spot which gave us fresh hopes that we should accomplish our
object, I have only now to return thanks to Providence 3 not only
for enabling us to surmount every obstacle which presented itself
as well as gaining our point in arriving at the place we took our
departure for when leaving home for that purpose, but also that we
should have been so very fortunate as to find so delightful a
country adjoining to where our journey terminated, with every
possible advantage attached to it, and without that scrub and brush
which we were led to expect at least within thirty miles of the sea
coast (as we were given to understand would be the case). I say
again, in expressing my gratitude, that nothing could have been
more fortunate, and in addition to this there is all that fine
country west of the Australian Alps to where we now are; and this
is the only place where there can be any communication (that is to
say, easy communication) without the trouble of crossing those
troublesome mountains. But from this direction there will be no
inconvenience attending a regular intercourse between the two
countries.</p>

<p>Having spoken much in praise of the country now behind us, and
which we shall lose sight of to-morrow, (I was going to say,
perhaps for ever, but I hope that will not be the case,) I would
wish, before I take my leave of it to say that I do not see any
reason for making any alteration in the statement which I made when
going. But, on the contrary, I think I might venture to make some
addition, but as I presume it will not be long before it will be
examined by abler and more competent judges, I shall say but little
more on the subject. I hope when it is surveyed that the season
will be the same as it is now. In that case I should not have much
fear of being contradicted. I mention this because the change of
season sometimes alters the appearance (for better or worse) of the
country from what it was at the time when persons were taking a
memorandum of it.</p>

<p>I was fearful that as my eyes were generally fixed (when
approaching the end of our journey, in the direction where we
should fall in with the sea) towards the front and seldom exceeding
an angle of 45 deg. from the front on each side of me, I might have
mis-stated some part and forgotten others. But now we are returning
and I am so well satisfied with the country, my eyes are as much
behind as they are in front, admiring the different spots which
occasionally present themselves to view. I have only now to say
that I think those persons who may come to settle here first should
make choice of the Duke of York's downs, because it is better
supplied with timber for uses about their farms, being so much
nearer to the Jullian range and Australian Alps, which have the
timber for building, as also the shelter from the cold S.W. and
N.W. winds. Whether the soil is inferior to the other downs or not
I am not able to say, but this I may venture to say, that it cannot
be better. The great advantage this country will derive will be the
communication with the interior, as also with the country east of
the Alps, along the river Yar through the Gap. I gave it that name
from the great resemblance of this country to the County of
Norfolk, and the Yar the principal river in it.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>X. LOCKYER'S EXPLORATION OF THE
BRISBANE RIVER</h3>

<blockquote>[MAJOR EDMUND LOCKYER, late of the 57th Regiment of
Foot, was despatched from Sydney in 1825 to explore the Brisbane
River. The copy of his journal from which the following extracts
have been made was lent to the editor by his son, Sir Nicholas
Lockyer.]<br></blockquote>

<p><i>Sept. 1st.</i>&mdash;Embarked on board the cutter
Mermaid.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;At 5 a.m. sailed from Sydney. After a fine run
anchored inside Nobby's Island, Hunter River.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Passed in between reef of rocks and flat
island. Eighteen fathoms to eleven to the outer buoys of the
Channel, leading into Morton Bay by Amity Point. Good anchorage
inside and close under the shore of Amity Point. From this
anchorage through the channel up to Peel's Island not less than
four fathoms at high water. After rounding Peel's Island plenty of
water for ships of any size which continues all the way up to Green
Islands thence to the buoy on spit off the mouth of the
Brisbane.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Weighed anchor and stood for the river, came
to anchor at the buoy at end of spit. The navigation would be
considerably facilitated by regular buoys of different colours
placed to mark the sides of the channel. Learning from the master
of the Mermaid that he did not think it prudent to take the cutter
over the bar, I departed in my boat to the settlement up the
river.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Several natives were seen on the side
opposite the settlement. Capt. Bishop and Lieut. Miller informed me
that they did not appear before in numbers. On this occasion I
think there were upwards of thirty men, women and children. They
seemed desirous to cross the river. I learnt on my return they had
swam across higher up after my departure but could not be persuaded
to approach the settlement nearer than two hundred yards, where
they remained for a while and then made off.</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. landed on the right side of river going up, which we
observed to be a brush with long grass, thinly wooded and rising in
a gradual slope from the river. A very pretty situation where I
halted for the night, which was very cold and a heavy dew falling.
Mosquitoes innumerable and very troublesome, which we found to
disperse by our smoking. The boat's sail made a good substitute for
a tent though it did not keep out the rain, which was very
heavy.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;The Wood on the banks Fig-tree Blue gum,
Swamp oak, Ironbark. For the last half distance no Pines, here and
there a solitary Cedar. On landing found spinach in abundance, also
mint, parsley and poppy. Halted on left side of river, a sandstone
rock forming a jetty.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;The country as yesterday. Except the hills
being high with fine downs thinly wooded, with very high grass of
the cat species. Very few Pines to be seen. The river in some
places very narrow then wide. Over the rapids rather shallow,
obliged to track them over, to do which the men were forced to get
out. Mr. Oxley had been thus far.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>-This day from the number of rapids and shoals, the
getting of the boats up was a matter of great difficulty as the men
were in the water for six hours. At 2.30 landed and camped for the
night. Saw cedar trees, honeysuckle and swamp oak. On the high
ground blue gum and ironbark. Fires of the natives; caught cod fish
similar to that of Bathurst River.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>-8.30 proceeded up the river. The hills beautifully
covered with Pine trees, the bank with swamp oak, honeysuckle, blue
gum and ironbark. Saw some of the natives and ordered the boats to
pull up where they stood. After much hesitation and the sight of a
looking glass they came within a few yards. We gave them biscuit;
showed them two sheep and also two of the soldiers with red hair,
which was a matter of curiosity to them. They were naked, stout,
clean skinned, well made people and showed no signs of hostility.
From the short intercourse I had, I think they had not seen a
European before. In the evening heavy rain; the sail completely
drenched through. Passed a very uncomfortable night, the fires
going out, much thunder and lightning.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;About 7 rain ceased and the weather began to
break. We soon got our clothes dry and embarked at 9 o'clock. The
natives we saw yesterday again made their appearance. Saw an old
man a cripple, also a little boy. Gave them fishing hooks and
lines. At 2 p.m. I ordered a landing. Under a range of hills camped
near a blue gum. I caused a broad arrow to be cut four feet from
bottom. Country very good on both sides. Kangaroos in abundance
extremely shy. The whole country appeared to be well timbered with
tall pines. Walked several miles, found the grass very long and
fatiguing to walk in. Rain fell.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;At 9 a.m. departed. Landed at the spot where
Mr. Gray the Pilot had stated he saw the white race. We made our
huts for the night. The Pine hills which we had left in our rear
presented only their tops, which proved we had ascended. This place
was pointed out by Thomas Robinson one of the sailors who was with
Mr. Gray, stated that he saw only two or three men running in the
bush who appeared to be of a light color but he saw no bows nor
arrows. N.B.&mdash;The natives are known on some occasions to
whiten themselves with wood ashes.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;At half past eight again set out. Much
obstruction from dead trees lying across a narrow and winding part
of the river, too numerous and large to attempt cutting a passage
through them, consequently had to pull the boats over, taking every
article out of them and in making a distance of a mile and a half
they were unladen four times which occupied upwards of three hours,
the stream running four knots and a half. Shot several wild ducks,
also a yellow snake. On the left side going up and opposite our
halting place a large stream joined the main river. The men caught
several cod fish and eels, the former were particularly good. The
country about this place was fine and the soil excellent. Ironbark
and stones in abundance.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Landed at 4.30 p.m. From the number of falls
and rapidity of the stream this proved laborious and the party were
knocked up. Parroquetes in great variety, but similar to those seen
in the country about Sydney.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;Rain began to pour in torrents about 12,
which compelled us to shelter at a remarkable spot under a high
hill near its base about the size of a side box of a theatre, the
abode of cats and dogs. Walked up the hill for one hour and half.
It appeared to me to be not less than 1000 feet high. On reaching
the summit we had a good view of the country. Mountainous to the
W.N.W. To the S. and S.E. high land discernable. To the W.N.W. was
a large flat country 30 or 40 miles finely wooded with blue and
ironbark. The ironstone prevails, very rotten, good sand stone and
fine soil fit for any cultivation. Rain the greater part of the
night.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Weather cleared and we quitted this spot at 9
a.m. As I could not ascertain the direction the natives had taken
we took the boats and proceeded up about a mile when two natives
were seen and calling to us. We went on shore and after some
difficulty induced them to have confidence to allow us to approach.
They were a woman and a lad about 14. The former had an infant in
arms. Gave them looking glasses, beads, and fish hooks. They appear
surprised at seeing people opposite in color to themselves. It is
certain that they had never seen white people before. They appeared
to believe that the boats were living animals as I could not induce
them to go near the boats. She shook her head and made signs as if
she was afraid they would bite; several women and children were
seen at a distance. Finding we could not induce them to approach we
left our new acquaintances of friendly intentions. The woman in
return for what I had given her held out a neat basket made of
plaited straw, and a kangaroo skin. The former I took, but declined
the latter as it was of value to them. As we proceeded up the river
these poor people continued to wave and shout after us until out of
sight. They were black and perfectly naked. We shot wild ducks. At
5 p.m. landed for the night. This place from the color of the soil
was called Red Bank.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;This morning at 7.30 I observed the water had
risen a foot in less than an hour, and its discoloration indicating
that a flood was coming down, no time was to be lost in getting the
boats up this rapid into the next reach. We accordingly left.</p>

<p>The country on both banks of the river was fine with rich
alluvial soil, and on both sides all the way up quite fit for the
cultivation of wheat, barley, oats, maize, fruit, vegetables,
grape, coffee, cotton, rice and sugar cane. Fine fish were
caught.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;Heavy rain during the night, river running
with much noise in rushing over the rocks. At this place a
considerable stream runs into the river from eastward. The weather
proved so bad that I considered it advisable to remain where we
were.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;We attempted to go with the boats but found
it impossible to make headway against the stream running at least
eight or nine knots. We landed and had the ropes carried well up
the bank as the river was rising fast. Opposite our camp was a
range of mountains, the largest of which and the nearest was about
1500 ft. high. Having landed at about 1 o'clock we made an
excursion into the country. There can be no doubt that the natives
avoid us. From the marks of fires and empty huts and the number of
trees barked, I should think them rather numerous in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;We again attempted at 8 o'clock to proceed.
The river we found had gone down 6 feet. Advanced about a mile but
found it impossible to pull against the stream against a rapid,
made arrangements for tracking the boats up by sending ashore and
the party passing the end of a rope to each other along the banks
and all the party hauling one boat at a time against the stream,
remaining myself to steer her clear of trees and stumps lying in
the middle. We succeeded in doing so nearly half way up the rapid
when the rope broke and the boat carried a distance down without
coming into contact with anything, but by steering into an eddy I
got the boat to the opposite shore. I found it useless to make
further attempt up this rapid, which was upwards of a mile, and
trying the stream with the log line found it running at the rate of
nine knot, therefore considerable danger was to be apprehended. The
loss of the boat and of the provisions would have placed me in an
awkward situation. I directed everything to be landed, having fixed
on a good spot under the mountain. I made arrangements to proceed
by land for further exploring the river, leaving the Corporal in
charge. I gave strict orders to the Corporal to be on his guard in
the event of the approach of any number of natives, to prevent any
violence being offered to them, and to behave towards them in a
manner to convince them no hostility was intended. Everything being
ready I set out at 12 o'clock accompanied by Mr. Dulhunty, private
of the 40th, one sailor and two convicts, kept the river in view,
found walking difficult in the long grass four or five feet high
out of which started numbers of kangaroo of the large sort or
forest kangaroo. Private Ward nearly trod on an immense snake 10
feet in length which was shot. It was of the diamond species and
measured 7 inches round. We crossed three considerable beds of
rivers running down from the mountain to the main river. The water
in the streams was excellent. At 5 we halted for the night a
quarter of a mile from the river bank. The night was cold and a
number of emus which our fires had disturbed making an intolerable
noise all night. From the number of trees newly barked as well of
the skeleton of bark huts, we concluded that the natives must be
numerous and not far off.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;At 8 o'clock we again set out keeping the
river in view. Nothing can possibly exceed the fine rich country we
are now in. We continued till 12 o'clock. Here the bed of the river
though broad was nearly dry, except a small stream passing through
it and quite impossible for boats, and from the large number of
streams running down the Brisbane Mountain I am induced to suppose
that the river to be chiefly supplied by these streams as it
certainly terminates here as a river, but I think it very probable
that the large swamp into which the river at Bathurst loses itself,
occasionally overflows and is the cause of tremendous floods, that
at times take place in the Brisbane River. From the Brisbane
Mountain looking to the west all a flat country behind a ridge of
hills running North and South. These hills well wooded with Pine
trees and with thick long grass making it dreadfully fatiguing to
walk through it with our loads. In consequence of this, seeing the
impossibility of making any progress by land, I determined to
rejoin the boats, which we accomplished the same evening after
having crossed the easternmost end of the Brisbane mountain at half
past six p.m. myself and companions quite knocked up.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Much rain, directed the boats to be got ready
to descend the river, as my instructions were to return if possible
by the middle of October. At 10 we left the Brisbane mountain and
before quitting I caused a tree to be barked and a broad arrow to
be cut into it. Made rapid progress going at the rate of eight or
nine knots, which was attended with considerable danger for the
want of ropes to ease the boats down. The weather threatening I
deemed it prudent to land, raining very hard with thunder and
lightning as we had experienced these three days past. Made the
distance 25 miles.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;At 9 set out and continued going down the
river until 3 o'clock. In passing down one of the falls the whale
boat was caught by the stump of a tree and nearly upset, she was
half full of water before she was clear. I also with the green boat
struck a tree with great force, the jerk nearly threw me out of the
boat being head and shoulders in the water, but was prevented from
going further by one of the men holding me by the leg. Shot several
duck. Smoke was seen in several directions around us.</p>

<p>Saw a bird not unlike a goose but he was too quick to get a shot
at him.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;We again set out at 8 , passed through
several falls. Several fresh obstacles had taken place by the flood
having taken away large trees from the banks. Arrived at the caves
at 2 o'clock, heavy rain, shot a wild duck of a new species which
proved good eating. I could not find any variety of rocks, they
were either rotten iron stone or sandstone. Distance 14 miles.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;From the circumstance of having clothes wet
and having a wish to examine the large branch which here joined
from the southward I determined on haling at this spot. Took one of
the boats and went up this branch three miles, found a large open
country with scarcely any wood to impede cultivation on it, the
trees chiefly blue gums. The natives had set fire to the long grass
and the new grass was just above the ground appearing like a
bowling green. The soil rich beyond idea, it would be well adapted
for the cultivation of rice, sugar cane, cotton and coffee. Saw
plenty of kangaroos and wild turkey. After traversing this fine
piece of land which was six to seven thousand acres I returned to
the camp.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;In passing through one of the reaches saw a
native on the banks where Mr. Gray had stated he had seen white
people. This man was sick and was indifferent to our presence.
Landed at 3 and discovered some natives about a mile. Two men, a
woman and three children. We made them presents. The woman could
not be induced to look up but hid her face between her legs. As
soon as we moved she on her legs and off like an arrow. The day's
distance 22 miles.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Made rapid progress and arrived at the coal
bed, filled a sack as a sample. There is fine coal just below. The
whale boat struck a tree and knocked a hole in her bottom. Took
everything out of her, hauled her up and in about two hours had her
completely repaired. Made our distance this day 28 miles.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;Passed down a fall with a remarkable bed of
rocks in it. On going up the water was much lower, it was now
nearly four feet higher and broke violently. We met several natives
who were shy at first but soon became confident and were fine
people. Distance 118 miles.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Arrived at the settlement at 11 o'clock,
distance 20 Miles, having been absent 27 days, the party being in
good health and without meeting a single accident of any
consequence. I am certain the distances are considerably underrated
from a wish at the same time rather to underrate than otherwise.
The obstructions in the river might be easily removed, the fine
timber growing on its bank is fit for every purpose, particularly
ship building. Moreton Bay is well calculated to become a place of
trade when once settled.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;Quitted the settlement to join the cutter at
Moreton Bay for the purpose of returning to Sydney. It becoming
dark on clearing the river we did not get on board till 11 p.m. as
it was with great difficulty we discovered the cutter, which I
should not have succeeded in doing, but for the discharging my
fouling piece. We saw a light over a mile away.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Beat down to Peel's island. Landed and found
it good soil and well wooded. On removing it from the surface found
a good clay below. In the middle of the island is a lagoon of
excellent fresh water. The island is from 12 to 15 miles in
circumference and would be a very proper place to build a
storehouse to deposit large stores from vessels that could not
approach the settlement nearer than this. It would also feed
cattle, and other stock.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;Dropped down to Amity Point and anchored
there with a strong sea-breeze from NE. Went on shore, a number of
the natives being there, was much amused by their singing a song
and pronouncing several English words most distinctly and by their
instantly recognising James Finnegan, one of the three men who was
wrecked there three years ago having been driven away to the
Northward from Illawarra or the Five Islands by a gale of wind.
These men were kindly treated and taken care of for nine months
until discovered by Mr. Oxley. They appeared delighted at meeting
Finnegan again and brought a supply of fish without expecting any
return though I took care to give them fishhooks and several other
things to show them we did not slight such good will. The stories
told of their being cannibals are fabulous and absurd. They are a
quiet inoffensive, good natured, lively set of people.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;Quitted Moreton Bay at 9 p.m. with a land
breeze leaving our friends the natives sitting on the shore at
Amity Point watching us until lost from their view. The attachment
of these people to their dogs is worthy of notice. I was very
anxious to get one of the wild native breed of a black color, a
very handsome puppy which one held in his arms. I offered a small
axe for the animal, his companions urged him to take it and he was
about to do so when he looked at his dog and the animal licked his
face, which settled the business, I tried him afterwards with
handkerchiefs of glaring colors but he would not part with his dog.
I gave him however the axe and the handkerchief.</p>

<p>On Sunday 16th Oct. at 4 in the afternoon anchored in Sydney
Cove and on Monday made my report to his Excellency the
Governor.</p>

<b>CHARLES STURT, AGED 73</b>
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>XI. STURT'S DISCOVERY OF THE
DARLING</h3>

<blockquote>[THE discovery of the Darling by Captain Charles Sturt
in 1829 was one of the outstanding events in Australian
exploration. It was followed by his even more important voyage down
the Murray. Both expeditions are described by Sturt in his two
volumes, <i>Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern
Australia*</i>, published in London in 1834.]<br></blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>[* This is one of two works by Sturt available

listing</a>.</b><br>
</p>

<p>The year 1826 was remarkable for the commencement of one of
those fearful droughts to which we have reason to believe the
climate of New South Wales is periodically subject. It continued
during the two following years with unabated severity. The surface
of the earth became so parched up that minor vegetation ceased upon
it. Culinary herbs were raised with difficulty, and crops failed
even in the most favourable situations. Settlers drove their flocks
and <!--page 2 OBJECTS OF
THE EXPEDITION. /page-->herds to distant tracts for pasture and
water, neither remaining for them in the located districts. The
interior suffered equally with the coast, and men, at length, began
to despond under so alarming a visitation. It almost appeared as if
the Australian sky were never again to be traversed by a cloud.</p>

<p>But, however severe for the colony the seasons had proved, or
were likely to prove, it was borne in mind at this critical moment,
that the wet and swampy state of the interior had alone prevented
Mr. Oxley from penetrating further into it, in 1818. Each
successive report from Wellington Valley, the most distant
settlement to the N. W., confirmed the news of the unusually dry
state of the lowlands, and of the exhausted appearance of the
streams falling into them. It was, consequently, hoped that an
expedition, pursuing the line of the Macquarie, would have a
greater chance of success than the late Surveyor General had; and
that the difficulties he had to contend against would be found to
be greatly diminished, if not altogether removed. The immediate
fitting out of an expedition was therefore decided upon, for the
express purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of that basin
into which the Macquarie was supposed to fall, and whether any
connection existed between it and the streams falling westerly. As
I had early taken a great interest in the geography of New South
Wales, the Governor was pleased to appoint me to the command of
this expedition.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1828, I received his Ex<!--page 3
JOURNEY FROM SYDNEY TO EMU PLAINS. /page-->cellency's commands to
prepare for my journey; and by the commencement of November, had
organized my party, and completed the necessary arrangements. On
the 9th of that month, I waited on the Governor, at Parramatta, to
receive his definitive instructions. As the establishments at
Sydney had been unable to supply me with the necessary number of
horses and oxen, instructions had been forwarded to Mr. Maxwell,
the superintendent of Wellington Valley, to train a certain number
for my use; and I was now directed to push for that settlement
without loss of time. I returned to Sydney in the afternoon of the
9th, and on the 10th took leave of my brother officers, to commence
a journey of very dubious issue; and, in company with my friend,
Staff-surgeon M'Leod, who had obtained permission to accompany me
to the limits of the colony, followed my men along the great
western road. We moved leisurely over the level country, between
the coast and the Nepean River, and availed ourselves of the kind
hospitality of those of our friends whose property lay along that
line of road, to secure more comfortable places of rest than the
inns would have afforded.</p>

<p>On the 17th of January we encamped under New Year's Range, which
is the first elevation in the interior of Eastern Australia to the
westward of Mount Harris. Yet when at its base, I do not think that
we had ascended above forty feet higher than the plains in the
neighbourhood of that last mentioned eminence. There certainly is a
partial rise of country, where the change of soil takes place from
the alluvial deposits of the marshes, to the sandy loam so
prevalent on the plains we had lately traversed; but I had to
regret that I was unable to decide so interesting a question by
other than bare conjecture.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Mr. Hume had already been on them, I
encouraged hopes that a second survey of the country from the
highest point of New Year's Range would enable us to form some
opinion of it, by which to direct our future movements; but I was
disappointed.</p>

<p>The two wooded hills I had seen from Oxley's Table Land were
visible from the range, bearing south; and other eminences bore by
compass S.W. and W. by S.; but in every other direction the horizon
was unbroken. To the westward, there appeared to be a valley of
considerable extent, stretching N. and S., in which latter
direction there was a long strip of cleared ground, that looked
very like the sandy bed of a broad and rapid river. The bare
possibility of the reality determined me to ascertain by
inspection, whether my conjecture was right, and Mr. Hume
<!--page 67 MOSQUITOES. /page-->accompanied me on this excursion.
After we left the camp we crossed a part of the range, and
travelled for some time through open forest land that would afford
excellent grazing in most seasons. We passed some hollows, and
noticed many huts that had been occupied near them; but the hollows
were now quite dry, and the huts had been long deserted. After
about ten miles' ride we reached a plain of white sand, from which
New Year's Range was distinctly visible; and this no doubt was the
spot that had attracted my attention. Pools of water continued on
it, from which circumstance it would appear that the sand had a
substratum of clay or marl. From this plain we proceeded southerly
through acacia scrub, bounding gently undulating forest land, and
at length ascended some small elevations that scarcely deserved the
name of hills. They had fragments of quartz profusely scattered
over them; and the soil, which was sandy, contained particles of
mica.</p>

<p>The view from them was confused, nor did any fresh object meet
our observation. We had, however, considerably neared the two
wooded hills, and the elevations that from the range were to the
S.W., now bore N.W. of us. We had wandered too far from the camp to
admit of our returning to it to sleep; we therefore commenced a
search for water, and having found some, we tethered our horses
near it for the night, and should have been tolerably comfortable,
had not the mosquitoes been so extremely troublesome. They defied
the power of smoke, and annoyed me so much, that, hot as it was, I
rolled myself in my boat <!--page 68 A
MAN MISSING. /page-->cloak, and perspired in consequence to such a
degree, that my clothes were wet through, and I had to stand at the
fire in the morning to dry them. Mr. Hume, who could not bear such
confinement, suffered the penalty, and was most unmercifully
bitten.</p>

<p>We reached the camp about noon the following day, and learnt, to
our vexation, that one of the men, Norman, had lost himself shortly
after we started, and had not since been heard of. Dawber, my
overseer, was out in search of him. I awaited his return,
therefore, before I took any measures for the man's recovery; nor
was I without hopes that Dawber would have found him, as it
appeared he had taken one of the horses with him, and Dawber, by
keeping his tracks, might eventually have overtaken him. He
returned, however, about 3 p.m. unsuccessful, when Mr. Hume and I
mounted our horses, and proceeded in different directions in quest
of him, but were equally disappointed.</p>

<p>We met at the creek in the dark, and returned to the camp
together, when I ordered the cypresses on the range to be set on
fire, and thus illuminated the country round for many miles. In the
morning, however, as Norman had not made his appearance, we again
started in search of the poor fellow, on whose account I was now
most uneasy; for his horse, it appeared, had escaped him, and was
found with the others at watering time.</p>

<p>I did not return to the camp until after sunset, more fatigued
than I recollect ever having been before. I was, however, rejoiced
on being informed that the object of my
<!--page 69 COUNTRY AROUND NEW
YEAR'S RANGE. /page-->anxiety was safe in his tent; that he had
caught sight of the hill the evening before, and that he had
reached the camp shortly after I left it. He had been absent three
nights and two days, and had not tasted water or food of any kind
during that time.</p>

<p>To my enquiries he replied, that, being on horseback, he thought
he could have overtaken a kangaroo, which passed him whilst waiting
at the creek for the cattle, and that in the attempt, he lost
himself. It would appear that he crossed the creek in the dark, and
his horse escaped from him on the first night. He complained more
of thirst than of hunger, although he had drunk at the
watering-place to such an excess, on his return, as to make him
vomit; but, though not a little exhausted, he had escaped better
than I should have expected.</p>

<p>New Year's Range consists of a principal group of five hills,
the loftiest of which does not measure 300 feet in height. It has
lateral ridges, extending to the N.N.W. on the one hand, and
bending in to the creek on the other. The former have a few
cypresses, sterculia, and iron bark upon them; the latter are
generally covered with brush, under box; the brush for the most
part consisting of two distinct species of stenochylus, and a new
acacia. The whole range is of quartz formation, small fragments of
which are profusely scattered over the ridges, and are abundantly
incrusted with oxide of iron. The soil in the neighbourhood of New
Year's Range is a red loam, with a slight mixture of sand. An open
forest country lies between it and the creek, and it is not at all
deficient in pasture. <!--page 70 NEW YEAR'S CREEK. /page--></p>

<p>That a change of soil takes place to the westward of the creek,
is obvious, from the change of vegetation, the most remarkable
feature of which is the sudden check given to the further extension
of the acacia pendula, which is not to be found beyond it, it being
succeeded by another acacia of the same species and habits; neither
do the plants of the chenopedia class exist in the immediate
vicinity of the range.</p>

<p>I place these hills, as far as my observations will allow, in
east long. 146&deg; 32' 15", and in lat. 30&deg; 21' south; the
variation of the compass being 6&deg; 40' easterly.</p>

<p>As New Year's Creek was leading northerly, it had been
determined to trace it down as long as it should keep that course,
or one to the westward of it. We broke up the camp, therefore,
under the range, on the evening of the 18th, and moved to the
creek, about two miles north of the place at which we had before
crossed it, with the intention of prosecuting our journey on the
morrow. But both Mr. Hume and I were so fatigued that we were glad
of an opportunity to rest, even for a single day. We remained
stationary, therefore, on the 19th; nor was I without hope that the
natives whom we had surprised in the woods, would have paid us a
visit, since Mr. Hume had met them in his search for Norman, and
they had promised not only to come to us, but to do all in their
power to find the man, whose footsteps some of them had crossed.
They did not, however, venture near us; and I rather attribute
their having kept aloof, to the circumstance of Mr. Hume's having
fired a shot, shortly after he left them, as a signal
<!--page 71 ANNOYED BY
KANGAROO FLIES. /page-->to Norman, in the event of his being within
hearing of the report. They must have been alarmed at so unusual a
sound; but I am sure nothing was further from Mr. Hume's intention
than to intimidate them; his knowledge of their manners and
customs, as well as his partiality to the natives, being equally
remarkable. The circumstance is, however, a proof of the great
caution that is necessary in communicating with them.</p>

<p>I have said that we remained stationary the day after we left
the range, with a view to enjoy a little rest; it would, however,
have been infinitely better if we had moved forward. Our camp was
infested by the kangaroo fly, which settled upon us in thousands.
They appeared to rise from the ground, and as fast as they were
swept off were succeeded by fresh numbers. It was utterly
impossible to avoid their persecution, penetrating as they did into
the very tents.</p>

<p>The men were obliged to put handkerchiefs over their faces, and
stockings upon their hands; but they bit through every thing. It
was to no purpose that I myself shifted from place to place; they
still followed, or were equally numerous everywhere. To add to our
discomfort, the animals were driven almost to madness, and galloped
to and fro in so furious a manner that I was apprehensive some of
them would have been lost. I never experienced such a day of
torment; and only when the sun set, did these little creatures
cease from their attacks.</p>

<p>It will be supposed that we did not stay to subject our
<!--page 72
SUDDENLY RELIEVED. /page-->selves to another trial; indeed it was
with some degree of horror that the men saw the first light of
morning streak the horizon. They got up immediately, and we moved
down the creek, on a northerly course, without breakfasting as
usual. We found that dense brushes of casuarina lined the creek on
both sides, beyond which, to our left, there was open rising
ground, on which eucalypti, cypresses, and the acacia longifolia,
prevailed; whilst to the east, plains seemed to predominate.</p>

<p>Although we had left the immediate spot at which the kangaroo
flies (cabarus) seemed to be collected, I did not expect that we
should have got rid of them so completely as we did. None of them
were seen during the day; a proof that they were entirely local.
They were about half the size of a common house fly, had flat brown
bodies, and their bite, although sharp and piercing, left no
irritation after it.</p>

<p>About noon we stopped at the creek side to take some
refreshment. The country bore an improved appearance around us, and
the cattle found abundance of pasture. It was evident that the
creek had been numerously frequented by the natives, although no
recent traces of them could be found. It had a bed of coarse red
granite, of the fragments of which the natives had constructed a
weir for the purpose of taking fish. The appearance of this rock in
so isolated a situation, is worthy of the consideration of
geologists.</p>

<p>The promise of improvement I have noticed, gradually <!--page 73
DESOLATION OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->disappeared as we proceeded on
our day's journey, and we at length found ourselves once more among
brushes, and on the edge of plains, over which the rhagodia
prevailed. Nothing could exceed in dreariness the appearance of the
tracks through which we journeyed, on this and the two following
days. The creek on which we depended for a supply of water, gave
such alarming indications of a total failure, that I at one time,
had serious thoughts of abandoning my pursuit of it. We passed
hollow after hollow that had successively dried up, although
originally of considerable depth; and, when we at length found
water, it was doubtful how far we could make use of it. Sometimes
in boiling it left a sediment nearly equal to half its body; at
other times it was so bitter as to be quite unpalatable. That on
which we subsisted was scraped up from small puddles, heated by the
sun's rays; and so uncertain were we of finding water at the end of
the day's journey, that we were obliged to carry a supply on one of
the bullocks. There was scarcely a living creature, even of the
feathered race, to be seen to break the stillness of the forest.
The native dogs alone wandered about, though they had scarcely
strength to avoid us; and their melancholy howl, breaking in upon
the ear at the dead of the night, only served to impress more fully
on the mind the absolute loneliness of the desert.</p>

<p>It appeared, from their traces that the natives had lingered on
this ground, on which they had perhaps been born, as long as it
continued to afford them a scanty
<!--page 74 SANDY PLAINS. /page-->though precarious subsistence;
but that they had at length been forced from it. Neither fish nor
muscles remained in the creek, nor emus nor kangaroos on the
plains. How then could an European expect to find food in deserts
through which the savage wandered in vain? There is no doubt of the
fate that would have overtaken any one of the party who might have
strayed away, and I was happy to find that Norman's narrow escape
had made a due impression on the minds of his comrades.</p>

<p>We passed some considerable plains, lying to the eastward of the
creek, on parts of which the grass, though growing in tufts, was of
luxuriant growth. They were, however, more generally covered with
salsola and rhagodia, and totally destitute of other vegetation,
the soil upon them being a red sandy loam. The paths across the
plains, which varied in breadth from three to eight miles, were
numerous; but they had not been recently trodden. The creek
continued to have a thick brush of casuarina and acacia near it, to
the westward of which there was a rising open forest track; the
timber upon it being chiefly box, cypress, and the acacia
longifolia. It was most probably connected with New Year's Range,
those elevations being about thirty miles distant. It terminated in
some gentle hills which, though covered in places with acacia
shrub, were sufficiently open to afford an extensive view. From
their summit Oxley's Table Land, towards which we had been
gradually working our way, was distinctly visible, distant about
twenty miles, and bearing by compass W. by S. On
<!--page 75 LEAVE THE CREEK. /page-->descending from these hills*
which were scattered over with fragments of slaty quartz, we
traversed a box flat, apparently subject to overflow, having a
barren sandy scrub to its left. I had desired the men to preserve a
W.N.W. direction, on leaving them, supposing that that course would
have kept them near the creek; but, on overtaking the party, I
found that they had wandered completely away from it. The fact was,
that the creek had taken a sudden bend to the eastward of N. and
had thus thrown them out. It was with some difficulty that we
regained it before sunset; and we were at length obliged to stop
for the night at a small plain, about a quarter of a mile short of
it, but we had the satisfaction of having excellent feed for the
animals.</p>

<p class="foot">[* Called the Pink Hills, from the colour of a
flower upon them]</p>

<p>Fearful that New Year's Creek would take us too far to the
eastward, and being anxious to keep westward as much as possible,
it struck me that we could not, under existing circumstances, do
better than make for Oxley's Table Land. Water, I knew, we should
find in a swamp at it's base, and we might discover some more
encouraging feature than I had observed on my hasty visit to it. We
left the creek, therefore on the 23rd, and once more took up a
westerly course. Passing through a generally open country, we
stopped at noon to rest the animals; and afterwards got on an
excellent grazing forest track, which continued to the brush,
through another part of which I had penetrated to the marsh more to
the south. While making our way through it, we came upon a small
pond of water, and must
<!--page 76 OXLEY'S TABLE LAND. /page-->have alarmed some natives,
as there was a fresh made fire close to it. Our journey had been
unusually long, and the cattle had felt the heat so much, that the
moment they saw water they rushed into it; and, as this created
some confusion, I thought it best to stop where we were for the
night.</p>

<p>In the morning, Mr. Hume walked with me to the hill, a distance
of about a mile. It is not high enough to deserve the name of a
mountain, although a beautiful feature in the country, and showing
well from any point of view. We ascended it with an anxiety that
may well be imagined, but were wholly disappointed in our most
sanguine expectations. Our chief object, in this second visit to
Oxley's Table Land, had been to examine, more at leisure, the face
of the country around it, and to discover, if possible, some fixed
point on which to move.</p>

<p>If the rivers of the interior had already exhausted themselves,
what had we to expect from a creek whose diminished appearance
where we left it made us apprehend its speedy termination, and
whose banks we traversed under constant apprehension? In any other
country I should have followed such a water course, in hopes of its
ultimately leading to some reservoir; but here I could encourage no
such favourable anticipation.</p>

<p>The only new object that struck our sight was a remarkable and
distant hill of conical shape, bearing by compass S. 10 E. To the
southward and westward, in the direction of D'Urban's Group, a
dense and apparently low brush extended; but to the N. and N.W.,
there was a regular
<!--page 77 EXCURSION TO D'URBAN'S GROUP. /page-->alternation of
wood and plain. I left Mr. Hume upon the hill, that he might the
more readily notice any smoke made by the natives; and returned
myself to the camp about one o'clock, to move the party to the
swamp. Mr. Hume's perseverance was of little avail. The region he
had been overlooking was, to all appearance, uninhabited, nor did a
single fire indicate that there was even a solitary wanderer upon
its surface.</p>

<p>Our situation, at this time, was extremely embarrassing, and the
only circumstance on which we had to congratulate ourselves was,
the improved condition of our men; for several of the cattle and
horses were in a sad plight. The weather had been so extremely
oppressive, that we had found it impossible to keep them free from
eruptions. I proposed to Mr. Hume, therefore, to give them a few
days' rest, and to make an excursion, with such of them as were
serviceable, to D'Urban's Group. We were both of us unwilling to
return to the creek, but we foresaw that a blind reliance upon
fortune, in our next movements, might involve us in inextricable
difficulty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a very great risk in delay. It was
more than probable, from the continued drought, that our retreat
would be cut off from the want of water, or that we should only be
enabled to effect our retreat with loss of most of the animals. The
hope, however, of our intersecting some stream, or of falling upon
a better country, prevailed over other considerations; and the
excursion was, consequently, determined upon.
<!--page 78 DISTRESS FROM WANT OF WATER. /page--></p>

<p>We left the camp on the 25th, accompanied by Hopkinson and the
tinker; and, almost immediately after, entered an acacia scrub of
the most sterile description, and one, through which it would have
been impossible to have found a passage for the boat carriage. The
soil was almost a pure sand, and the lower branches of the trees
were decayed so generally as to give the whole an indescribable
appearance of desolation. About mid-day, we crossed a light sandy
plain, on which there were some dirty puddles of water. They were
so shallow as to leave the backs of the frogs in them exposed, and
they had, in consequence, been destroyed by solar heat, and were in
a state of putrefaction. Our horses refused to drink, but it was
evident that some natives must have partaken of this sickening
beverage only a few hours before our arrival. Indeed, it was clear
that a wandering family must have slept near this spot, as we
observed a fresh made gunneah (or native hut), and their
foot-prints were so fresh along the line we were pursuing, that we
momentarily expected to have overtaken them. It was late in the
evening when we got out of this brush into better and more open
ground, where, in ordinary seasons we should, no doubt, have found
abundance of water. But we now searched in vain for it, and were
contented to be enabled to give our wearied animals better food
than they had tasted for many days, the forest grass, though in
tufts, being abundant.</p>

<p>We brought up for the night at the edge of a scrub, having
travelled from thirty-two to thirty-five miles, judging
<!--page 79 BEARINGS
FROM OXLEY'S TABLE LAND. /page-->the distance from the mountains
still to be about twelve.</p>

<p>In the morning we started at an early hour, and immediately
entered the brush, beneath which we had slept; pursuing a westerly
course through it. After a short ride, we found ourselves upon a
plain, that was crowded with flocks of cockatoos. Here we got a
supply of water, such as it was&mdash;so mixed with slime as to
hang in strings between the fingers; and, after a hasty breakfast,
we proceeded on our journey, mostly through a barren sandy scrub
that was a perfect burrow from the number of wombats in it, to
within a mile of the hill group, where the country appeared like
one continuous meadow to the very base of them. I never saw
anything like the luxuriance of the grass on this tract of country,
waving as it did higher than our horses' middles as we rode through
it. We ascended the S.W. face of the mountain to an elevation of at
least 800 feet above the level of the plain, and had some
difficulty in scaling the masses of rock that opposed themselves to
our progress. But on gaining the summit, we were amply repaid for
our trouble. The view extended far and wide, but we were again
disappointed in the main object that had induced us to undertake
the journey. I took the following bearings by compass. Oxley's
Table Land bore N. 40 E. distant forty-five miles; small and
distant hill due E.; conical peak seen from Oxley's Table Land S.
60 E., very distant; long ridge of high land, S.E., distant
thirty-five miles; high land, S. 30 E., distant thirty miles; long
range, S. 25 W. <!--page 80 D'URBAN'S GROUP. /page--></p>

<p>To the westward, as a medium point. the horizon was unbroken,
and the eye wandered over an apparently endless succession of wood
and plain. A brighter green than usual marked the course of the
mountain torrents in several places, but there was no glittering
light among the trees, no smoke to betray a water hole, or to tell
that a single inhabitant was traversing the extensive region we
were overlooking. We were obliged to return to the plain on which
we had breakfasted, and to sleep upon it.</p>

<p>D'Urban's Group is of compact sandstone formation. Its extreme
length is from E.S.E. to W.N.W., and cannot be more than from seven
to nine miles, whilst its breadth is from two to four. The central
space forms a large basin, in which there are stunted pines and
eucalyptus scrub, amid huge fragments of rocks. It rises like an
island from the midst of the ocean, and as I looked upon it from
the plains below, I could without any great stretch of the
imagination, picture to myself that it really was such. Bold and
precipitous, it only wanted the sea to lave its base; and I cannot
but think that such must at no very remote period have been the
case, and that the immense flat we had been traversing, is of
comparatively recent formation.</p>

<p>We reached the camp on the 28th of the month, by nearly the same
route; and were happy to find that, after the few days' rest they
had enjoyed, there was a considerable improvement in the
animals.</p>

<p>Our experience of the nature of the country to the south
<!--page 81
DESCRIPTION OF OXLEY'S TABLE LAND. /page-->ward, and the westward,
was such as to deter us from risking anything, by taking such a
direction as was most agreeable to our views. Nothing remained to
us but to follow the creek, or to retreat; and as we could only be
induced to adopt the last measure when every other expedient should
have failed, we determined on pursuing our original plan, of
tracing New Year's Creek as far as practicable.</p>

<p>Oxley's Table Land is situated in lat. 29&deg; 57' 30", and in
E. long. 145&deg; 43' 30", the mean variation being 6.32 easterly.
<!--comment {probably 6&deg;
32'} /comment--> It consists of two hills that appear to have been
rent asunder by some convulsion of nature, since the passage
between them is narrow and their inner faces are equally
perpendicular. The hill which I have named after the late
Surveyor-general, is steep on all sides; but the other gradually
declines from the south, and at length loses itself in a large
plain that extends to the north. It is from four to five miles in
length, and is picturesque in appearance, and lightly wooded. A few
cypresses were growing on Oxley's Table Land; but it had,
otherwise, very little timber upon its summit. Both hills are of
sandstone formation, and there are some hollows upon the last that
deserve particular notice. They have the appearance of having been
formed by eddies of water, being deeper in the centre than at any
other part, and contain fragments and slabs of sandstone of various
size and breadth, without a particle of soil or of sand between
them. It is to be observed that the edges of these slabs, which
were perfect parallelograms, were unbroken, and that they were as
clean as if they had only just been
<!--page CONTINUE THE JOURNEY /page-->turned out of the hand of the
mason. We counted thirteen of these hollows in one spot about
twenty-five feet in diameter, but they are without doubt of
periodical formation, since a single hollow was observed lower than
the summit of the hill upon its south extremity, that had evidently
long been exposed to the action of the atmosphere, and had a
general coating of moss over it.</p>

<p>We left Oxley's Table Land on the morning of the 31st of
January, pursuing a northern course through the brush and across a
large plain, moving parallel to the smaller hill, and keeping it
upon our left. The soil upon this plain differed in character from
that on the plains to the eastward, and was much freer from sand.
We stopped to dine at a spot, whence Oxley's Table Land bore by
compass, S. by W., distant about twelve miles. Continuing our
journey, at 2 p.m. we cleared the plain, and entered a tract
covered with the polygonum junceum, on a soil evidently the deposit
of floods. Box-trees were thinly scattered over it, and among the
polygonum, the crested pigeons were numerous. These general
appearances, together with a dip of country to the N.N.W., made us
conclude that we were approaching the creek, and we accordingly
intersected it on a N.N.E. course, at about three miles' distance
from where we had dined. It had, however, undergone so complete a
change, and had increased so much in size and in the height of its
banks, that we were at a loss to recognise it. Still, with all
these favourable symptoms, there was not a drop of water in it. But
small <!--page
DOWN NEW YEAR'S CREEK. /page-->shells lay in heaps in its bed, or
were abundantly scattered over it; and we remarked that they
differed from those on the plains of the Macquarie. A circumstance
that surprised us much, was the re-appearance of the flooded-gum
upon its banks, and that too of a large size. We had not seen any
to the westward of the marshes, and we were, consequently, led to
indulge in more sanguine expectation as to our ultimate success
than we had ever ventured to do before.</p>

<p>The party crossed to the right bank of the creek, and then moved
in a westerly direction along it in search of water. A brush
extended to our right, and some broken stony ground, rather
elevated, was visible, to which Mr. Hume rode; nor did he join me
again until after I had halted the party for the night.</p>

<p>My search for water had been unsuccessful, and the sun had set,
when I came upon a broad part of the creek that appeared very
favourable for an encampment, as it was encompassed by high banks,
and would afford the men a greater facility of watching the cattle,
that I knew would stray away if they could.</p>

<p>My anxiety for them led me to wander down the bed of the creek,
when, to my joy, I found a pond of water within a hundred yards of
the tents. It is impossible for me to describe the relief I felt at
this success, or the gladness it spread among the men. Mr. Hume
joined me at dusk, and informed me that he had made a circuit, and
had struck upon the creek about three miles below us but that, in
tracing it up, he had not found a drop of water
<!--page 84 DISTRESSED FOR WATER. /page-->until he came to the pond
near which we had so providentially encamped. On the following
morning, we held a westerly course over an open country for about
eight miles and a half. The prevailing timber appeared to be a
species of eucalypti, with rough bark, of small size, and evidently
languishing from the want of moisture. The soil over which we
travelled was far from bad, but there was a total absence of water
upon it. At 6 p.m. Oxley's Table Land was distant from us about
fifteen miles, bearing S. 20 E. by compass.</p>

<p>We had not touched upon the creek from the time we left it in
the morning, having wandered from it in a northerly direction,
along a native path that we intersected, and that seemed to have
been recently trodden, since footsteps were fresh upon it. At
sunset, we crossed a broad dry creek that puzzled us extremely, and
were shortly afterwards obliged to stop for the night upon a plain
beyond it. We had, during the afternoon, bent down to the S.W. in
hopes that we should again have struck upon New Year's Creek; and,
under an impression that we could not be far from it, Mr. Hume and
I walked across the plain, to ascertain if it was sufficiently near
to be of any service to us. We came upon a creek, but could not
decide whether it was the one for which we had been searching, or
another.</p>

<p>Its bed was so perfectly even that it was impossible to say to
what point it flowed, more especially as all remains of debris had
mouldered away. It was, however, extremely broad, and evidently, at
times, held a furious torrent. In the centre of it, at one of the
angles, we discovered a pole
<!--page 85 REACH A LARGE RIVER. /page-->erected, and at first
thought, from the manner in which it was propped up, that some
unfortunate European must have placed it there as a mark to tell of
his wanderings, but we afterwards concluded that it might be some
superstitious rite of the natives, in consequence of the
untowardness of the season, as it seemed almost inconceivable that
an European could have wandered to such a distance from the located
districts in safety.</p>

<p>The creek had flooded-gum growing upon its banks, and, on places
apparently subject to flood, a number of tall straight saplings
were observed by us. We returned to the camp, after a vain search
for water, and were really at a loss what direction next to pursue.
The men kept the cattle pretty well together, and, as we were not
delayed by any preparations for breakfast, they were saddled and
loaded at an early hour. The circumstance of there having been
natives in the neighbourhood, of whom we had seen so few traces of
late, assured me that water was at hand, but in what direction it
was impossible to guess. As the path we had observed was leading
northerly, we took up that course, and had not proceeded more than
a mile upon it, when we suddenly found ourselves on the banks of a
noble river. Such it might in truth be called, where water was
scarcely to be found. The party drew up upon a bank that was from
forty to forty-five feet above the level of the stream. The channel
of the river was front seventy to eighty yards broad, and enclosed
an unbroken sheet of water, evidently very deep, and literally
covered with pe<!--page 86 DISAPPOINTMENT ON FINDING /page-->licans
and other wild fowl. Our surprise and delight may better be
imagined than described. Our difficulties seemed to be at an end,
for here was a river that promised to reward all our exertions, and
which appeared every moment to increase in importance to our
imagination. Coming from the N.E.,and flowing to the S.W., it had a
capacity of channel that proved that we were as far from its source
as from its termination. The paths of the natives on either side of
it were like well trodden roads; and the trees that overhung it
were of beautiful and gigantic growth.</p>

<p>Its banks were too precipitous to allow of our watering the
cattle, but the men eagerly descended to quench their thirst, which
a powerful sun had contributed to increase; nor shall I ever forget
the cry of amazement that followed their doing so, or the looks of
terror and disappointment with which they called out to inform me
that the water was so salt as to be unfit to drink! This was,
indeed, too true: on tasting it, I found it extremely nauseous, and
strongly impregnated with salt, being apparently a mixture of sea
and fresh water. Whence this arose, whether from local causes, or
from a communication with some inland sea, I knew not, but the
discovery was certainly a blow for which I was not prepared. Our
hopes were annihilated at the moment of their apparent realization.
The cup of joy was dashed out of our hands before we had time to
raise it to our lips. Notwithstanding this disappointment, we
proceeded down the river, and halted at about five miles, being
influenced by the goodness of the <!--page 87 THE
RIVER SALT. /page-->feed to provide for the cattle as well as
circumstances would permit. They would not drink of the river
water, but stood covered in it for many hours, having their noses
alone exposed above the stream. Their condition gave me great
uneasiness. It was evident they could not long hold out under their
excessive thirst, and unless we should procure some fresh water, it
would impossible for us to continue our journey. On a closer
examination, the river appeared to me much below its ordinary
level, and its current was scarcely perceptible. We placed sticks
to ascertain if there was a rise or fall of tide, but could arrive
at no satisfactory conclusion, although there was undoubtedly a
current in it. Yet, as I stood upon its banks at sunset, when not a
breath of air existed to break the stillness of the waters below
me, and saw their surface kept in constant agitation by the leaping
of fish, I doubted whether the river could supply itself so
abundantly, and the rather imagined, that it owed such abundance,
which the pelicans seemed to indicate was constant, to some
mediterranean sea or other. Where, however, were the human
inhabitants of this distant and singular region? The signs of a
numerous population were around us, but we had not seen even a
solitary wanderer. The water of the river was not, by any means, so
salt as that of the ocean, but its taste was precisely similar.
Could it be that its unnatural state had driven its inhabitants
from its banks?</p>

<p>One would have imagined that our perplexities would have been
sufficient for one day, but ere night closed,
<!--page 88 JUNCTION OF NEW
YEAR'S CREEK. /page-->they increased upon us, although our anxiety,
with regard to the cattle, was happily removed. Mr. Hume with his
usual perseverance, walked out when the camp was formed; and, at a
little distance from it, ascended a ridge of pure sand, crowned
with cypresses. From this, he descended to the westward, and, at
length, struck upon the river, where a reef of rocks creased its
channel, and formed a dry passage from one side to the other; but
the bend, which the river must have taken, appeared to him so
singular, that he doubted whether it was the same beside which we
had been travelling during the day. Curiosity led him to cross it,
when he found a small pond of fresh water on a tongue of land, and,
immediately afterwards, returned to acquaint me with the welcome
tidings. It was too late to move, but we had, at least, the
prospect of a comfortable breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>In consequence of the doubts that hung upon Mr. Hume's mind, as
to the course of the river, we arranged that the animals should
precede us to the fresh water; and that we should keep close in
upon the stream, to ascertain that point. After traversing a deep
bight, we arrived nearly as soon as the party, at the appointed
rendezvous. The rocks composing the channel of the river at the
crossing place, were of indurated clay. In the course of an hour,
the animals appearing quite refreshed, we proceeded on our journey,
and at about four miles crossed New Year's Creek, at its junction
with the salt river. We passed several parts of the main channel
that were perfectly dry, and were altogether
<!--page 89 NATIVE VILLAGE. /page-->at a loss to account for the
current we undoubtedly had observed in the river when we first came
upon it. At midday D'Urban's Group bore S. 65 E. distant about 32
miles. We made a little westing in the afternoon. The river
continued to maintain its character and appearance, its lofty
banks, and its long still reaches: while, however, the blue-gum
trees upon its banks were of magnificent size, the soil had but
little vegetation upon it, although an alluvial deposit.</p>

<p>We passed over vast spaces covered with the polygonum junceum,
that bore all the appearance of the flooded tracks in the
neighbourhood of the marshes, and on which the travelling was
equally distressing to the animals. Indeed, it had been
sufficiently evident to us that the waters of this river were not
always confined to its channel, capacious as it was, but that they
inundated a belt of barren land, that varied in width from a
quarter of a mile to a mile, when they were checked by an outer
embankment that prevented them from spreading generally over the
country, and upon the neighbouring plains. At our halting place,
the cattle drank sparingly of the water, but it acted as a violent
purgative both on them and the men who partook of it.</p>

<p>On the 5th, the river led us to the southward and westward.
Early in the day, we passed a group of seventy huts, capable of
holding from twelve to fifteen men each. They appeared to be
permanent habitations, and all of them fronted the same point of
the compass. In searching amongst them we observed two beautifully
made nets, of <!--page 90 TERROR OF THE
NATIVES. /page-->about ninety yards in length. The one had much
larger meshes than the other, and was, most probably, intended to
take kangaroos; but the other was evidently a fishing net.</p>

<p>In one hut, the floor of which was swept with particular care, a
number of white balls, as of pulverised shells or lime, had been
deposited&mdash;the use of which we could not divine. A trench was
formed round the hut to prevent the rain from running under it, and
the whole was arranged with more than ordinary attention.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded very far when we came suddenly upon the
tribe to which this village, as it might be called, belonged. In
breaking through some brush to an open space that was bounded on
one side by the river, we observed three or four natives, seated on
a bank at a considerable distance from us; and directly in the line
on which we were moving. The nature of the ground so completely
favoured our approach, that they did not become aware of it until
we were within a few yards of them, and had ascended a little
ridge, which, as we afterwards discovered, ended in an abrupt
precipice upon the river, not more than thirty yards to our right.
The crack of the drayman's whip was the first thing that aroused
their attention. They gazed upon us for a moment, and then started
up and assumed an attitude of horror and amazement; their terror
apparently increasing upon them. We stood perfectly immovable,
until at length they gave a fearful yell, and darted out of sight.
<!--page 91 THEY FIRE
THE BUSH. /page--></p>

<p>Their cry brought about a dozen more natives from the river,
whom we had not before observed, but who now ran after their
comrades with surprising activity, and without once venturing to
look behind them. As our position was a good one, we determined to
remain upon it, until we should ascertain the number and
disposition of the natives. We had not been long stationary, when
we heard a crackling noise in the distance, and it soon became
evident that the bush had been fired. It was, however, impossible
that we could receive any injury on the narrow ridge upon which we
stood, so that we waited very patiently to see the end of this
affair.</p>

<p>In a short time the fire approached pretty near to us, and dense
columns of smoke rose into the air over our heads. One of the
natives, who had been on the bank, now came out of the bush,
exactly from the spot into which he had retreated. He advanced a
few paces towards us, and bending his body so that his hands rested
on his knees, he fixed his gaze upon us for some time; but, seeing
that we remained immovable, he began to throw himself into the most
extravagant attitudes, shaking his foot from time to time. When he
found that all his violence had no effect, he turned his rear to us
in a most laughable manner, and absolutely groaned in spirit when
he found that this last insult failed of success.</p>

<p>He stood perplexed and not knowing what next to do, which gave
Mr. Hume an opportunity to call out to him, and with considerable
address he at length got the savage
<!--page 92 REMARKS ON THE NATIVES /page-->to approach close up to
him; Mr. Hume himself having advanced a short distance from the
animals in the first instance. As soon as I thought the savage had
sufficiently recovered from his alarm, I went up to him with a
tomahawk, the use of which he immediately guessed. We now observed
that the natives who had fled from the river, had been employed in
setting a net. They had placed it in a semicircle, with either end
to the shore, and rude pieces of wood were attached to it to keep
the upper part perpendicular. It was in fact a sein, only that the
materials, with the exception of the net-work, were simpler and
rougher than cork or lead&mdash;for which last, we afterwards
discovered stones had been substituted.</p>

<p>We had on this occasion a remarkable instance of the docility of
the natives of the interior, or of the power they have of subduing
their apprehensions; manifesting the opposite extremes of fear and
confidence. These men whom we had thus surprised, and who, no
doubt, imagined that we were about to destroy them, having
apparently never seen nor heard of white men before, must have
taken us for something preternatural; yet from the extremity of
fear that had prompted them to set their woods in flames, they in a
brief space so completely subdued those fears as to approach the
very beings who had so strongly excited their alarm. The savage who
had been the principal actor in the scene, was an elderly man,
rather descending to the vale of years than what might be strictly
called aged. I know not how it was, but I regarded him with
peculiar interest. Mr.
<!--page 93 DISEASE AMONG THEM. /page-->Hume's manners had in a
great measure contributed to allay his evident agitation; but, from
the moment I approached him, I thought there was a shade of anxiety
upon his brow, and an expression of sorrow over his features, the
cause of which did not originate with us. I could see in a moment,
that his bosom was full even to bursting, and he seemed to claim at
once our sympathy and our protection, although we were ignorant of
that which oppressed him. We had not long been seated together,
when some of his tribe mustered sufficient courage to join him.
Both Mr. Hume and I were desirous of seeing the net drawn, but the
old man raised some objection, by pointing to the heavens and
towards the sun. After a little more solicitation, however, he gave
a whistle, and, four or five natives having obeyed the summons, he
directed them to draw the net, but they were unfortunate, and our
wish to ascertain the kind of fish contained in the river was
disappointed. As his tribe gathered round him, the old chief threw
a melancholy glance upon them, and endeavoured, as much as he
could, to explain the cause of that affliction which, as I had
rightly judged, weighed heavily upon him. It appeared, then, that a
violent cutaneous disease raged throughout the tribe, that was
sweeping them off in great numbers. He called several young men to
Mr. Hume and myself, who had been attacked by this singular malady.
Nothing could exceed the anxiety of his explanations, or the mild
and soothing tone in which he addressed his people, and it really
pained me that I could not assist him in his distress. We now
<!--page 94 DEPARTURE OF THE NATIVES. /page-->discovered the use to
which the conical substance that had been deposited with such
unusual care in one of the huts, was applied. There were few of the
natives present who were not more or less marked with it, and it
was no doubt, indicative of mourning.</p>

<p>Some of the men, however, were painted with red and yellow
ochre, with which it was evident to me they had besmeared
themselves since our appearance, most likely in preparing for the
combat in which they fancied they would be engaged. We distributed
such presents as we had to those around us, and when we pursued our
journey, the majority accompanied us, nor did they wholly leave us
until we had passed the place to which their women had retired.
They might have left us when they pleased, for we intended them no
harm; as it was, however, they struck into the brushes to join
their families, and we pushed on to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>The travelling near the river had been so bad, not only in
consequence of the nature of the soil and brush, but from the
numerous gullies that had been formed by torrents, as they poured
into its channel after heavy rains and floods, that it was thought
advisable to keep at a greater distance from it. We turned away,
therefore, to the plains, and found them of much firmer surface.
They partook, however, of the same general character as the plains
we had traversed more to the eastward. Their soil was a light sandy
loam, and the same succulent plants still continued to prevail upon
them, which we have already noticed as
<!--page 95 BRINE SPRINGS IN THE RIVER. /page-->existing upon the
other plains. Both emus and kangaroos were seen, though not in any
considerable numbers, but our dogs were not in a condition to run,
and were all but killed by the extreme heat of the weather. We had
fallen on a small pool of water shortly after we started in the
morning, but we could do no more than refresh ourselves and the
animals at it. In the afternoon, we again turned towards the river,
and found it unaltered. Its water was still salt, and from the
increased number of wild fowl and pelicans upon it, as well as from
the general flatness of the country, I certainly thought we were
rapidly approaching some inland sea. It was, however, uncertain how
long we should be enabled to continue on the river. The animals
were all of them extremely weak, and every day increased the
probable difficulty of our return. There was not the least
appearance of a break-up of the drought, the heavens were without a
cloud, and the atmosphere was so clear that the outline of the moon
could be distinctly seen, although she was far in her wane.</p>

<p>On the 6th, we journeyed again through a barren scrub, although
on firmer ground, and passed numerous groups of huts. At about
eight miles from our last encampment, we came upon the river, where
its banks were of considerable height. In riding along them, Mr.
Hume thought he observed a current running, and be called to inform
me of the circumstance. On a closer examination, we discovered some
springs in the very bed of the river, from which a considerable
stream was gushing, and from the incrustation around
<!--page 96 DISTRESS FOR WANT OF FRESH
WATER. /page-->them, we had no difficulty in guessing at their
nature: in fact, they were brine springs, and I collected a
quantity of salt from the brink of them.</p>

<p>After such a discovery, we could not hope to keep our position.
No doubt the current we had observed on first reaching the river,
was caused by springs that had either escaped our notice or were
under water. Here was at length a local cause for its saltness that
destroyed at once the anticipation and hope of our being near its
termination, and, consequently, the ardour with which we should
have pressed on to decide so interesting a point.</p>

<p>Our retreat would have been a measure of absolute necessity ere
this, had we not found occasional supplies of fresh water, the last
pond of which was now about eighteen miles behind us.</p>

<p>Whether we should again find any, was a doubtful question, and I
hesitated to run the risk. The animals were already, from bad food,
and from the effects of the river water, so weak, that they could
scarcely carry their loads, and I was aware, if any of the bullocks
once fell, he would never rise again. Under such circumstances, I
thought it better to halt the party at the edge of the scrub,
though the feed was poor, and the water not drinkable. Our
situation required most serious consideration. It was necessary
that we should move either backward or forward in the morning. Yet
we could not adopt either measure with satisfaction to ourselves,
under such unfavorable circumstances. I determined to relieve my
own mind by getting <!--page 97 OUR COURSE
ARRESTED. /page-->the animals into a place of safety, as soon as
possible; and, as the only effectual way of doing this was to
retire upon the nearest fresh water, I resolved at once to do so.
The party turned back on the morning of the 6th; nor do I think the
cattle would ever have reached their destination had we not found a
few buckets of rain water in the cleft of a rock, to refresh them.
Thus it will appear that under our most trying circumstances, we
received aid from Providence, and that the bounty of Heaven was
extended towards us, when we had least reason to expect it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding we had been thus forced to a partial retreat,
both Mr. Hume and myself were unwilling to quit the pursuit of the
river, in so unsatisfactory a manner. There was no difference in
the appearance of the country to the westward of it; but a seeming
interminable flat stretched away in that direction. A journey
across it was not likely, therefore, to be attended with any
favorable results, since it was improbable that any other leading
feature was within our reach. I proposed, therefore, to take the
most serviceable of the horses with me down the river, that, in the
event of our finding fresh water, we might again push forward. Mr.
Hume requesting to be permitted to accompany me, it was arranged
that we should start on the 8th, thereby giving the animals a day's
rest. We had not seen any natives since our parting with the chief
horde; and as we were stationed at some little distance from the
river, I hoped that they would not visit the camp during my
absence. This was the only circum
<!--page 98 EXTRAORDINARY SOUND. /page-->stance that gave me
uneasiness, but the men had generally been behaving so well that I
relied a great deal upon them.</p>

<p>About 3 p.m. on the 7th, Mr. Hume and I were occupied tracing
the chart upon the ground. The day had been remarkably fine, not a
cloud was there in the heavens, nor a breath of air to be felt. On
a sudden we heard what seemed to be the report of a gun fired at
the distance of between five and six miles. It was not the hollow
sound of an earthly explosion, or the sharp cracking noise of
falling timber, but in every way resembled a discharge of a heavy
piece of ordnance. On this all were agreed, but no one was certain
whence the sound proceeded. Both Mr. Hume and myself had been too
attentive to our occupation to form a satisfactory opinion; but we
both thought it came from the N.W. I sent one of the men
immediately up a tree, but he could observe nothing unusual. The
country around him appeared to be equally flat on all sides, and to
be thickly wooded: whatever occasioned the report, it made a strong
impression on all of us; and to this day, the singularity of such a
sound, in such a situation, is a matter of mystery to me.</p>

<p>On the 8th, we commenced our journey down the river, accompanied
by two men, and a pack-horse, carrying our provisions on one side
and a bucket of water on the other. Keeping in general near the
stream, but making occasional turns into the plains, we got to the
brush from which the party had turned back, about 3 p.m. Passing
through, we crossed a small plain, of better soil and vegetation
<!--page 99 FURTHER ATTEMPT TO
EXPLORE THE RIVER. /page-->than usual; but it soon gave place to
the sandy loam of the interior; nor did we observe any material
alteration, either in the country or the river, as we rode along.
The flooded-gum trees on the banks of the latter, were of beautiful
growth, but in the brushes dividing the plains, box and other
eucalypti, with cypresses and many minor shrubs, prevailed. We
slept on the river side, and calculated our distance from the camp
at about twenty-six or twenty-eight miles.</p>

<p>The horses would not drink the river water, so that we were
obliged to give them a pint each from our own supply. On the
following morning we continued our journey. The country was
generally open to the eastward, and we had fine views of D'Urban's
Group, distant from twenty to twenty-five miles. About noon,
turning towards the river to rest, both ourselves and the horses,
we passed through brush land for about a mile and a half. When we
came upon its banks, we found them composed of a red loam with
sandy superficies. We had, in the course of the day, crossed
several creeks, but in none of them could we find water, although
their channels were of great depth.</p>

<p>The day had been extremely warm, and from shaking in the barrel
our supply of water had diminished to a little more than a pint; it
consequently became a matter of serious consideration, how far it
would be prudent to proceed farther; for, however capable we were
of bearing additional fatigue, it was evident our animals would
soon fail, since they trembled exceedingly, and had the look of
total exhaustion.
<!--page 100 CALLED IT THE &ldquo;DARLING&rdquo;. /page-->We
calculated that we were forty miles from the camp, in a S.W.
direction, a fearful distance under our circumstances, since we
could not hope to obtain relief for two days. Independently
however, of the state of the animals, our spirits were damped by
the nature of the country, and the change which had taken place on
the soil, upon which it was impossible that water could rest; while
the general appearance of the interior showed how much it had
suffered from drought. On the other hand, although the waters of
the river had become worse to the taste, the river itself had
increased in size, and stretched away to the westward, with all the
uniformity of a magnificent canal, and gave every promise of
increasing importance; while the pelicans were in such numbers upon
it as to be quite dazzling to the eye. Considering, however, that
perseverance would only involve us in inextricable difficulties,
and that it would also be useless to risk the horses, since we had
gained a distance to which the bullocks could not have been
brought, I intimated my intention of giving up the further pursuit
of the river, though it was with extreme reluctance that I did
so.</p>

<p>As soon as we had bathed and finished our scanty meal, I took
the bearings of D'Urban's Group, and found them to be S. 58 E.
about thirty-three miles distant; and as we mounted our horses, I
named the river the &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; as a lasting memorial of
the respect I bear the governor.</p>

<p>I should be doing injustice to Mr. Hume and my men, <!--page 101
ABANDON THE ATTEMPT. /page-->if I did not express my conviction
that they were extremely unwilling to yield to circumstances, and
that, had I determined on continuing the journey, they would have
followed me with cheerfulness, whatever the consequences might have
been.</p>

<p>Whether the discoveries that have been made during this
expedition, will ultimately prove of advantage to the colony of New
South Wales, is a question that time alone can answer. We have in
the meanwhile to regret that no beneficial consequences will
immediately follow them. The further knowledge that has been gained
of the interior is but as a gleam of sunshine over an extensive
landscape. A stronger light has fallen upon the nearer ground, but
the distant horizon is still enveloped in clouds. The veil has only
as it were been withdrawn from the marshes of the Macquarie to be
spread over the channel of the Darling. Un
<!--page 152 RESULT OF THE EXPEDITION. /page-->satisfactory,
however, as the discoveries may as yet be considered in a
commercial point of view, the objects for which the expedition had
been fitted out were happily attained. The marsh it had been
directed to examine, was traversed on every side, and the rivers it
had been ordered to trace, were followed down to their terminations
to a distance far beyond where they had ceased to exist as living
streams. To many who may cast their eyes over the accompanying
chart, the extent of newly discovered country may appear trifling;
but when they are told, that there is not a mile of that ground
that was not traversed over and over again, either by Mr. Hume or
by myself, that we wandered over upwards of 600 miles more than the
main body of the expedition, on different occasions, in our
constant and anxious search for water, and that we seldom
dismounted from our horses, until long after sunset, they will
acknowledge the difficulties with which we had to contend, and will
make a generous allowance for them; for, however unsuccessful in
some respects the expedition may have been, it accomplished as
much, it is to be hoped, as under such trying circumstances could
have been accomplished.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>XII. STURT'S DISCOVERY OF THE
MURRAY</h3>

<p>The expedition of which we have just detailed the proceedings
was so far satisfactory in its results, that it not only set at
rest the hypothesis of the existence of an internal shoal sea in
southern Australia, and ascertained the actual termination of the
rivers it had been directed to trace, but also added very largely
to our knowledge of the country considerably to the westward of
former discoveries. And although no land had been traversed of a
fertile description of sufficient extent to invite the settler, the
fact of a large river such as the Darling lying at the back of our
almost intertropical <!--page 2 OBJECTS OF THE
EXPEDITION. /page-->settlements, gave a fresh importance to the
distant interior. It was evident that this river was the chief
drain for carrying off the waters falling westerly from the eastern
coast, and as its course indicated a decline of country
diametrically opposite to that which had been calculated upon, it
became an object of great importance to ascertain its further
direction. Had not the saline quality of its waters been accounted
for, by the known existence of brine springs in its bed, it would
have been natural to have supposed that it communicated with some
mediterranean sea; but, under existing circumstances, it remained
to be proved whether this river held on a due south course, or
whether it ultimately turned westerly, and ran into the heart of
the interior. In order fully to determine this point, it would be
necessary to regain it banks, so far below the parallel to which it
had been traced as to leave no doubt of its identity; but it was
difficult to fix upon a plan for approaching that central stream
without suffering from the want of water, since it could hardly be
expected that the Lachlan would afford such means, as it was
reasonable to presume that its termination was very similar to that
of the Macquarie. The attention of the government was,
consequently, fixed upon the Morumbidgee, a river stated to be of
considerable size and of impetuous current. Receiving its supplies
from the lofty ranges behind Mount Dromedary, it promised to hold a
longer course than those rivers which, depending on periodical
rains alone for existence, had been found so soon to exhaust
themselves. <!--page 3 PREPARATIONS. /page--></p>

<p>The fitting out of another expedition was accordingly determined
upon; and about the end of September 1829, I received the
Governor's instructions to make the necessary preparations for a
second descent into the interior, for the purpose of tracing the
Morumbidgee, or such rivers as it might prove to be connected with,
as far as practicable. In the event of failure in this object, it
was hoped that an attempt to regain the banks of the Darling on a
N.W. course from the point at which the expedition might be
thwarted in its primary views, would not be unattended with
success. Under any circumstances, however, by pursuing these
measures, an important part of the colony would necessarily be
traversed, of which the features were as yet altogether
unknown.</p>

<p>It became my interest and my object to make the expedition as
complete as possible, and, as far as in me lay, to provide for
every contingency: and as it appeared to me that, in all
likelihood, we should in one stage or other of our journey have to
trust entirely to water conveyance, I determined on taking a
whale-boat, whose dimensions and strength should in some measure be
proportioned to the service required. I likewise constructed a
small still for the distillation of water, in the event of our
finding the water of the Darling salt, when we should reach its
banks.</p>

<p>From our camp, the Morumbidgee held a direct westerly course for
about three miles. The hills under which we had encamped, rose so
close upon our right as to leave little space between them and the
river. At the distance of three miles, however, they suddenly
terminated, and the river changed its direction to the S.W., while
a chain of ponds extended to the westward, and separated the
alluvial flats from a somewhat more elevated plain before us. We
kept these ponds upon our left for some time, but, as they
ultimately followed the bend of the river, we left them. The blacks
led us on a W. by S. course to the base of a small range two or
three miles distant, near which there was a deep lagoon. It was
evident they here expected to have found some other natives. Being
disappointed, how
<!--page 39 NATIVES&mdash;WILD GAME, &amp;c. /page-->ever, they
turned in towards the river again, but we stopped short of it on
the side of a serpentine sheet of water, an apparent continuation
of the chain of ponds we had left behind us, forming a kind of
ditch round the S.W. extremity of the range, parallel to which we
had continued to travel. This range, which had been gradually
decreasing in height from the lagoon, above which it rose
perpendicularly, might almost be said to terminate here. We fell in
with two or three natives before we halted, but the evident want of
population in so fine a country, and on so noble a river, surprised
me extremely. We saw several red kangaroos in the course of the
day, and succeeded in killing one. It certainly is a beautiful
animal, ranging the wilds in native freedom. The female and the kid
are of a light mouse-colour. Wild turkeys abound on this part of
the Morumbidgee, but with the exception of a few terns, which are
found hovering over the lagoons, no new birds had as yet been
procured; and the only plant that enriched our collection, was an
unknown metrosideros. In crossing the extremity of the range, the
wheels of the dray sunk deep into a yielding and coarse sandy soil,
of decomposed granite, on which forest-grass prevailed in tufts,
which, being far apart, made the ground uneven, and caused the
animals to trip. We rose at one time sufficiently high to obtain an
extensive view, and had our opinions confirmed as to the level
nature of the country we were so rapidly approaching. From the N.
to the W.S.W. the eye wandered over a wooded and unbroken interior,
if I except a solitary double hill that rose in the midst of
<!--page 40
CHARACTER OF THE RIVER /page-->it, bearing S. 82&deg; W. distant 12
miles, and another singular elevation that bore S. 32&deg; W.
called by the natives, Kengal. The appearance to the E.S.E. was
still that of a mountainous country, while from the N.E., the hills
gradually decrease in height, until lost in the darkness of
surrounding objects to the northward. We did not travel this day
more than 13 miles on a W. by N. course. The Morumbidgee, where we
struck it, by its increased size, kept alive our anticipations of
its ultimately leading us to some important point. The partial
rains that had fallen while we were on its upper branch, had
swollen it considerably, and it now rolled along a vast body of
water at the rate of three miles an hour, preserving a medium width
of 150 feet; its banks retaining a height far above the usual level
of the stream. A traveller who had never before descended into the
interior of New Holland, would have spurned the idea of such a
river terminating in marshes; but with the experience of the former
journey, strong as hope was within my breast, I still feared it
might lose itself in the vast flat upon which we could scarcely be
said to have yet entered. The country was indeed taking up more and
more every day the features of the N.W. interior. Cypresses were
observed upon the minor ridges, and the soil near the river,
although still rich, and certainly more extensive than above, was
occasionally mixed with sand, and scattered over with the claws of
crayfish and shells, indicating its greater liability to be
flooded; nor indeed could I entertain a doubt that the river had
laid a great part of the levels around us under water
<!--page 41 AND THE
ADJOINING COUNTRY. /page-->long after it found that channel in
which nature intended ultimately to confine it. We killed another
fine red kangaroo in the early part of the day, in galloping after
which I got a heavy fall.</p>

<p>The two blacks who had been with us so long, and who had not
only exerted themselves to assist us, but had contributed in no
small degree to our amusement, though they had from M'Leay's
liberality, tasted all the dainties with which we had provided
ourselves, from sugar to concentrated cayenne, intimated that they
could no longer accompany the party. They had probably got to the
extremity of their beat, and dared not venture any further. They
left us with evident regret, receiving, on their departure, several
valuable presents, in the shape of tomahawks &amp;c. The last thing
they did was to point out the way to us, and to promise to join us
on our return, although they evidently little anticipated ever
seeing us again.</p>

<p>In pursuing our journey, we entered a forest, consisting of
box-trees, casuarinae, and cypresses, on a light sandy soil, in
which both horses and bullocks sunk so deep that their labour was
greatly increased, more especially as the weather had become much
warmer. At noon I altered my course from N.W. by W. to W.N.W., and
reached the Morumbidgee at 3 in the afternoon. The flats bordering
it were extensive and rich, and, being partially mixed with sand,
were more fitted for agricultural purposes than the stiffer and
purer soil amidst the mountains; but the interior beyond them was
far from being of corresponding quality. We
<!--page 42 TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIVER. /page-->crossed several
plains on which vegetation was scanty, probably owing to the
hardness of the soil, which was a stiff loamy clay, and which must
check the growth of plants, by preventing the roots from striking
freely into it. The river where we stopped for the night appeared
to have risen considerably, and the fish were rolling about on the
surface of the water with a noise like porpoises. No elevations
were visible, so that I had not an opportunity of continuing the
chain of survey with the points I had previously taken.</p>

<p>We started on the 26th, on a course somewhat to the N.W., and
traversed plains of the same wearisome description as those I have
already described. The wheels of the drays sank up to their
axle-trees, and the horses above their fetlocks at every step. The
fields of polygonum spread on every side of us like a dark sea, and
the only green object within range of our vision was the river line
of trees. <!--page 66
COUNTRY COVERED WITH REEDS. /page-->In several instances, the force
of both teams was put to one dray, to extricate it from the bed
into which it had sunk, and the labour was considerably increased
from the nature of the weather. The wind was blowing as if through
a furnace, from the N.N.E., and the dust was flying in clouds, so
as to render it almost suffocating to remain exposed to it. This
was the only occasion upon which we felt the hot winds in the
interior. We were, about noon, endeavouring to gain a point of a
wood at which I expected to come upon the river again, but it was
impossible for the teams to reach it without assistance. I
therefore sent M'Leay forward, with orders to unload the pack
animals as soon as he should make the river, and send them back to
help the teams. He had scarcely been separated from me 20 minutes,
when one of the men came galloping back to inform me that no river
was to be found&mdash;that the country beyond the wood was covered
with reeds as far as the eye could reach, and that Mr. M'Leay had
sent him back for instructions. This intelligence stunned me for a
moment or two, and I am sure its effect upon the men was very
great. They had unexpectedly arrived at a part of the interior
similar to one they had held in dread, and conjured up a thousand
difficulties and privations. I desired the man to recall Mr.
M'Leay; and, after gaining the wood, moved outside of it at right
angles to my former course, and reached the river, after a day of
severe toil and exposure, at half-past five. The country, indeed,
bore every resemblance to that around the marshes of the Macquarie,
but I was too weary to make any further <!--page 67 ANXIOUS
COGITATIONS. /page-->effort: indeed it was too late for me
undertake anything until the morning.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which we were so unexpectedly placed,
occupied my mind so fully that I could not sleep; and I awaited the
return of light with the utmost anxiety. If we were indeed on the
outskirts of marshes similar to those I had on a former occasion
found so much difficulty in examining, I foresaw that in
endeavouring to move round then I should recede from water, and
place the expedition in jeopardy, probably, without gaining any
determinate point, as it would be necessary for me to advance
slowly and with caution. Our provisions, however, being calculated
to last only to a certain period, I was equally reluctant to delay
our operations. My course was, therefore, to be regulated by the
appearance of the country and of the river, which I purposed
examining with the earliest dawn. If the latter should be found to
run into a region of reeds, a boat would be necessary to enable me
to ascertain its direction; but, if ultimately it should be
discovered to exhaust itself, we should have to strike into the
interior on a N.W. course, in search of the Darling. I could not
think of putting the whale-boat together in our then state of
uncertainty, and it struck me that a smaller one could sooner be
prepared for the purposes for which I should require it. These
considerations, together with the view I had taken of the measures
I might at last be forced into, determined me, on rising, to order
Clayton to fell a suitable tree, and to prepare a saw-pit. The
labour <!--page 68 SURVEY OF RIVER AND ENVIRONS. /page-->was of no
consideration, and even if eventually the boat should not be
wanted, no injury would arise, and it was better to take time by
the forelock. Having marked a tree preparatory to leaving the camp,
M'Leay and I started at an early hour on an excursion of deeper
interest than any we had as yet undertaken; to examine the reeds,
not only for the purpose of ascertaining their extent, if possible,
but also to guide us in our future measures. We rode for some miles
along the river side, but observed in it no signs, either of
increase or of exhaustion. Its waters, though turbid, were deep,
and its current still rapid. Its banks, too, were lofty, and showed
no evidence of decreasing in height, so as to occasion an overflow
of them, as had been the case with the Macquarie. We got among vast
bodies of reeds, but the plains of the interior were visible beyond
them. We were evidently in a hollow, and the decline of country was
plainly to the southward of west. Every thing tended to strengthen
my conviction that we were still far from the termination of the
river. The character it had borne throughout, and its appearance
now so far to the westward, gave me the most lively hopes that it
would make good its way through the vast level into which it fell,
and that its termination would accord with its promise. Besides, I
daily anticipated its junction with some stream of equal, if not of
greater magnitude from the S.E. I was aware that my resolves must
be instant, decisive, and immediately acted upon, as on firmness
and promptitude at this crisis the success of the expedition
depended. About noon I checked my horse,
<!--page 69 BOAT BUILDING. /page-->and rather to the surprise of my
companion, intimated to him my intention of returning to the camp,
He naturally asked what I purposed doing. I told him it appeared to
me more than probable that the Morumbidgee would hold good its
course to some fixed point, now that it had reached a meridian
beyond the known rivers of the interior. It was certain, from the
denseness of the reeds, and the breadth of the belts, that the
teams could not be brought any farther, and that, taking every
thing into consideration, I had resolved on a bold and desperate
measure, that of building the whale-boat, and sending home the
drays. Our appearance in camp so suddenly, surprised the men not
more than the orders I gave. They all thought I had struck on some
remarkable change of country, and were anxious to know my ultimate
views. It was not my intention however, immediately to satisfy
their curiosity. I had to study their characters as long as I
could, in order to select those best qualified to accompany me on
the desperate adventure for which I was preparing.</p>

<p>The attention both of M'Leay, and myself, was turned to the
hasty building of the whale-boat. A shed was erected, and every
necessary preparation made, and although Clayton had the keel of
the small boat already laid down, and some planks prepared, she was
abandoned for the present, and, after four days more of arduous
labour, the whale-boat was painted and in the water. From her
dimensions, it appeared to me impossible that she would hold all
our provisions and stores, for her after-part
<!--page 70 COMPLETION OF ARRANGEMENTS /page-->had been fitted up
as an armoury, which took away considerably from her capacity of
stowage. The small boat would still, therefore, be necessary, and
she was accordingly re-laid, for half the dimensions of the large
boat, and in three days was alongside her consort in the river.
Thus, in seven days we had put together a boat, twenty-seven feet
in length, had felled a tree from the forest, with which we had
built a second of half the size, had painted both, and had them at
a temporary wharf ready for loading. Such would not have been the
case had not our hearts been in the work, as the weather was close
and sultry, and we found it a task of extreme labour. In the
intervals between the hours of work, I prepared my despatches for
the Governor, and when they were closed, it only remained for me to
select six hands, the number I intended should accompany me down
the river, and to load the boats, ere we should once more proceed
in the further obedience of our instructions.</p>

<p>It was impossible that I could do without Clayton, whose
perseverance and industry had mainly contributed to the building of
the boats; of the other prisoners, I chose Mulholland and Macnamee;
leaving the rest in charge of Robert Harris, whose steady conduct
had merited my approbation. My servant, Harris, Hopkinson, and
Fraser, of course, made up the crews. The boats were loaded in the
evening of Jan. 6th, as it had been necessary to give the paint a
little time to dry. On the 4th, I had sent Clayton and Mulholland
to the nearest cypress range for a mast
<!--page 71 FOR EMBARKATION. /page-->and spar, and on the evening
of that day some blacks had visited us; but they sat on the bank of
the river, preserving a most determined silence; and, at length,
left us abruptly, and apparently in great ill humour. In the
disposition of the loads, I placed all the flour, the tea, and
tobacco, in the whaleboat. The meat-casks, still, and carpenters'
tools, were put into the small boat.</p>

<p>As soon as the different arrangements were completed, I
collected the men, and told off those who were to accompany me. I
then gave the rest over in charge to Harris, and, in adverting to
their regular conduct hitherto, trusted they would be equally
careful while under his orders. I then directed the last remaining
sheep to be equally divided among us; and it was determined that,
for fear of accidents, Harris should remain stationary for a week,
at the expiration of which time, he would be at liberty to proceed
to Goulburn Plains, there to receive his instructions from Sydney;
while the boats were to proceed at an early hour of the morning
down the river,&mdash;whether ever to return again being a point of
the greatest uncertainty.</p>

<p>The camp was a scene of bustle and confusion long before
day-light. The men whom I had selected to accompany me were in high
spirits, and so eager to commence their labours that they had been
unable to sleep, but busied themselves from the earliest dawn in
packing up their various articles of clothing, &amp;c. We were
prevented from taking our departure so early as I had intended, by
rain that fell about six. At a little after seven, however, the
weather cleared up, the morning mists blew over our heads, and the
sun struck upon us with his usual fervour. As soon as the minor
things were stowed away, we bade adieu to Harris and his party; and
shortly after, em<!--page 73 SUPPOSED JUNCTION
OF LACHLAN. /page-->barked on the bosom of that stream along the
banks of which we had journeyed for so many miles.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that we only used two oars, our progress down
the river was rapid. Hopkinson had arranged the loads so well, that
all the party could sit at their ease, and Fraser was posted in the
bow of the boat, with gun in hand, to fire at any new bird or beast
that we might surprise in our silent progress. The little boat,
which I shall henceforward call the skiff, was fastened by a
painter to our stern.</p>

<p>As the reader will have collected from what has already fallen
under his notice, the country near the depot was extensively
covered with reeds, beyond which vast plains of polygonum stretched
away. From the bed of the river we could not observe the change
that took place in it as we passed along, so that we found it
necessary to land, from time to time, for the purpose of noting
down its general appearance. At about fifteen miles from the depot,
we came upon a large creek-junction from the N.E., which I did not
doubt to be the one M'Leay and I had crossed on the 25th of
December. It was much larger than the creek of the Macquarie, and
was capable of holding a very great body of water, although
evidently too small to contain all that occasionally rushed from
its source. I laid it down as the supposed junction of the Lachlan,
since I could not, against the corroborating facts in my
possession, doubt its originating in the marshes of that river.
Should this, eventually, prove to be the case, the similar
termination of the <!--page 74 EMUS&mdash;NATIVE TOMB. /page-->two
streams traced by Mr. Oxley will be a singular feature in the
geography of the interior.</p>

<p>We were just about to land, to prepare our dinner, when two emus
swam across the river ahead of us. This was an additional
inducement for us to land, but we were unfortunately too slow, and
the birds escaped us. We had rushed in to the right bank, and found
on ascending it, that the reeds with which it had hitherto been
lined, had partially ceased. A large plain, similar to those over
which we had wandered prior to our gaining the flooded region,
stretched away to a considerable distance behind us, and was backed
by cypresses and brush. The soil of the plain was a red sandy loam,
covered sparingly with salsolae and shrubs; thus indicating that
the country still preserved its barren character, and that it is
the same from north to south. Among the shrubs we found a tomb that
appeared to have been recently constructed. No mound had been
raised over the body, but an oval hollow shed occupied the centre
of the burial place, that was lined with reeds and bound together
with strong net-work. Round this, the usual walks were cut, and the
recent traces of women's feet were visible upon them, but we saw no
natives, although, from the number and size of the paths that led
from the river, in various directions across the plain, I was led
to conclude, that, at certain seasons, it is hereabouts numerously
frequented. Fraser gathered some rushes similar to those used by
the natives of the Darling in the fabrication of their nets, and as
they had not before been observed, we judged them, of course, to be
a sign of our near approach to that river.
<!--page 75 ASPECT OF COUNTRY AND RIVER. /page--></p>

<p>As soon as we had taken a hasty dinner, we again embarked, and
pursued our journey. I had hoped, from the appearance of the
country to the north of us, although that to the south gave little
indication of any change, that we should soon clear the reeds; but
at somewhat less than a mile they closed in upon the river, and our
frequent examination of the neighbourhood on either side of it only
tended to confirm the fact, that we were passing through a country
subject to great and extensive inundation. We pulled up at
half-past five, and could scarcely find space enough to pitch our
tents.</p>

<p>The Morumbidgee kept a decidedly westerly course during the day.
Its channel was not so tortuous as we expected to have found it,
nor did it offer any obstruction to the passage of the boats. Its
banks kept a general height of eight feet, five of which were of
alluvial soil, and both its depth and its current were
considerable. We calculated having proceeded from 28 to 30 miles,
though, perhaps, not more than half that distance in a direct line.
No rain fell during the day, but we experienced some heavy squalls
from the E.S.E.</p>

<p>The second day of our journey from the depot was marked by an
accident that had well nigh obliged us to abandon the further
pursuit of the river, by depriving us of part of our means of
carrying it into effect. We had proceeded, as usual, at an early
hour in the morning, and not long after we started, fell in with
the blacks who had visited us last, and who were now in much better
humour than upon <!--page 76 THE
SKIFF STRIKES AND SINKS. /page-->that occasion. As they had their
women with them, we pushed in to the bank, and distributed some
presents, after which we dropped quietly down the river. Its
general depth had been such as to offer few obstructions to our
progress, but about an hour after we left the natives, the skiff
struck upon a sunken log, and immediately filling, went down in
about twelve feet of water, The length of the painter prevented any
strain upon the whale-boat, but the consequence of so serious an
accident at once flashed upon our minds. That we should suffer
considerably, we could not doubt, but our object was to get the
skiff up with the least possible delay, to prevent the fresh water
from mixing with the brine, in the casks of meat. Some short time,
however, necessarily elapsed before we could effect this, and when
at last the skiff was hauled ashore, we found that we were too late
to prevent the mischief that we had anticipated. All the things had
been fastened in the boat, but either from the shock, or the force
of the current, one of the pork casks, the head of the still, and
the greater part of the carpenter's tools, had been thrown out of
her. As the success of the expedition might probably depend upon
the complete state of the still, I determined to use every effort
for its recovery: but I was truly at a loss how to find it; for the
waters of the river were extremely turbid. In this dilemma, the
blacks would have been of the most essential service, but they were
far behind us, so that we had to depend on our own exertions alone.
I directed the whale-boat to be moored over the place where the
accident had happened, <!--page 77
LABOUR IN RECOVERING ARTICLES LOST. /page-->and then used the oars
on either side of her, to feel along the bottom of the river, in
hopes that by these means we should strike upon the articles we had
lost. However unlikely such a measure was to prove successful, we
recovered in the course of the afternoon, every thing but the
still-head, and a cask of paint. Whenever the oar struck against
the substance that appeared, by its sound or feel to belong to us,
it was immediately pushed into the sand, and the upper end of the
oar being held by two men, another descended by it to the bottom of
the river, remaining under water as long as he could, to ascertain
what was immediately within arm's length of him. This work was, as
may be imagined, most laborious, and the men at length became much
exhausted. They would not, however, give up the search for the
still head, more especially after M'Leay, in diving, had descended
upon it. Had he, by ascertaining his position, left it to us to
heave it up, our labours would soon have ended; but, in his anxiety
for its recovery, he tried to bring it up, when finding it too
heavy, he let it go, and the current again swept it away.</p>

<p>At sunset, we were obliged to relinquish our task, the men
complaining of violent head-aches, which the nature of the day
increased. Thinking our own efforts would be unavailing, I directed
two of the men to go up the river for the blacks, at day-light in
the morning, and set the reeds on fire to attract their notice. The
day had been cloudy and sultry in the afternoon, the clouds
collecting in the N.E.: we heard the distant thunder, and expected
to have <!--page 78 PILFERING OF NATIVES. /page-->been deluged with
rain. None, however, fell, although we were anxious for moisture to
change the oppressive state of the atmosphere. The fire I had
kindled raged behind us, and threw dense columns of smoke into the
sky, that cast over the landscape a shade of the most dismal gloom.
We were not in a humour to admire the picturesque, but soon betook
ourselves to rest, and after such a day of labour as that we had
undergone, I dispensed with the night guard.</p>

<p>In the morning we resumed our search for the still head, which
Hopkinson at length fortunately struck with his oar. It had been
swept considerably below the place at which M'Leay had dived, or we
should most probably have found it sooner. With its recovery, all
our fatigues were at once forgotten, and I ordered the breakfast to
be got ready preparatory to our reloading the skiff. Fraser and
Mulholland, who had left the camp at daylight, had not yet
returned. I was sitting in the tent, when Macnamee came to inform
me that one of the frying-pans was missing, which had been in use
the evening previous, for that he himself had placed it on the
stump of a tree, and he therefore supposed a native dog had run
away with it. Soon after this, another loss was reported to me, and
it was at last discovered that an extensive robbery had been
committed upon us during the night, and that, in addition to the
frying-pan, three cutlasses, and five tomahawks, with the pea of
the steelyards, had been carried away. I was extremely surprised at
this instance of daring in the natives, and determined, if
possible, <!--page 79 CONTINUE OUR VOYAGE. /page-->to punish it.
About ten, Fraser and Mulholland returned with two blacks. Fraser
told me he saw several natives on our side of the river, as he was
returning, to whom those who were with him spoke, and I felt
convinced from their manner and hesitation, that they were aware of
the trick that had been played upon us. However, as Fraser had
promised them a tomahawk to induce them to accompany him, I
fulfilled the promise.</p>

<p>Leaving this unlucky spot, we made good about sixteen miles
during the afternoon. The river maintained its breadth and depth
nor were the reeds continuous upon its banks. We passed several
plains that were considerably elevated above the alluvial deposits,
and the general appearance of the country induced me strongly to
hope that we should shortly get out of the region of reeds, or the
great flooded concavity on which we had fixed our depot; but the
sameness of vegetation, and the seemingly diminutive size of the
timber in the distance, argued against any change for the better in
the soil of the interior. Having taken the precaution of shortening
the painter of the skiff, we found less difficulty in steering her
clear of obstacles, and made rapid progress down the Morumbidgee
during the first cool and refreshing hours of the morning. The
channel of the river became somewhat less contracted, but still
retained sufficient depth for larger boats than ours, and preserved
a general westerly course. Although no decline of country was
visible to the eye, the current in places ran very strong. It is
impossible for me to convey to the reader's mind an idea of the
nature <!--page 80 CONTRACTION OF THE CHANNEL. /page-->of the
country through which we passed. On this day the favourable
appearances, noticed yesterday, ceased almost as soon as we
embarked. On the 10th, reeds lined the banks of the river on both
sides, without any break, and waved like gloomy streamers over its
turbid waters; while the trees stood leafless and sapless in the
midst of them. Wherever we landed, the same view presented
itself&mdash;a waving expanse of reeds, and a country as flat as it
is possible to imagine one. The eye could seldom penetrate beyond
three quarters of a mile, and the labour of walking through the
reeds was immense; but within our observation all was green and
cheerless. The morning had been extremely cold, with a thick haze
at E.S.E. About 2 p.m. it came on to rain heavily, so that we did
not stir after that hour.</p>

<p>I had remarked that the Morumbidgee was not, from the depot
downwards, so broad or so fine a river as it certainly is at the
foot of the mountain ranges, where it gains the level country. The
observations of the last two days had impressed upon my mind an
idea that it was rapidly falling off, and I began to dread that it
would finally terminate in one of those fatal marshes in which the
Macquarie and the Lachlan exhaust themselves. My hope of a more
favourable issue was considerably damped by the general appearance
of the surrounding country; and from the circumstance of our not
having as yet passed a single tributary. As we proceeded down the
river, its channel gradually contracted, and immense trees that had
been swept down it by floods, rendered the navigation dangerous and
intricate. Its waters became so <!--page 81 ANOTHER
ACCIDENT. /page-->turbid, that it was impossible to see objects in
it, notwithstanding the utmost diligence on the part of the
men.</p>

<p>About noon, we fell in with a large tribe of natives, but had
great difficulty in bringing them to visit us. If they had
<i>heard</i> of white men, we were evidently the first they had
ever <i>seen</i>. They approached us in the most cautious manner,
and were unable to subdue their fears as long as they remained with
us. Collectively, these people could not have amounted to less than
one hundred and twenty in number.</p>

<p>As we pushed off from the bank, after having stayed with them
about half an hour, the whaleboat struck with such violence on a
sunken log, that she immediately leaked on her starboard side.
Fortunately she was going slowly at the time, or she would most
probably have received some more serious injury. One of the men was
employed during the remainder of the afternoon in bailing her out,
and we stopped sooner than we should otherwise have done, in order
to ascertain the extent of damage, and to repair it. The reeds
terminated on both sides of the river some time before we pulled
up, and the country round the camp was more elevated than usual,
and bore the appearance of open forest pasture land, the timber
upon it being a dwarf species of box, and the soil a light
tenacious earth.</p>

<p>About a mile below our encampment of the 12th, we at length came
upon a considerable creek-junction from the S.E. Below it, the
river increased both in breadth and depth; banks were lofty and
perpendicular, and even the lowest levels were but partially
covered with reeds. We met with fewer
<!--page 82 ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY, /page-->obstructions in
consequence, and pursued our journey with restored confidence.
Towards evening a great change also took place in the aspect of the
country, which no longer bore general marks of inundation. The
level of the interior was broken by a small hill to the right of
the stream, but the view from its summit rather damped than
encouraged my hopes of any improvement. The country was covered
with wood and brush, and the line of the horizon was unbroken by
the least swell. We were on an apparently boundless flat, without
any fixed point on which to direct our movements, nor was there a
single object for the eye to rest upon, beyond the dark and gloomy
wood that surrounded us on every side.</p>

<p>Soon after passing this hill, the whale-boat struck upon a line
of sunken rocks, but fortunately escaped without injury.
Mulholland, who was standing in the bow, was thrown out of her,
head foremost, and got a good soaking, but soon recovered himself.
The composition of the rock was iron-stone, and it is the first
formation that occurs westward of the dividing range. We noticed a
few cypresses in the distance, but the general timber was
dwarf-box, or flooded-gum, and a few of the acacia longa scattered
at great distances. In verifying our position by some lunars, we
found ourselves in 142&deg; 46' 30" of east long., and in lat.
35&deg; 25' 15" S. the mean variation of the compass being 4&deg;
10' E. it appearing that we were decreasing the variation as we
proceeded westward.</p>

<p>On the 13th, we passed the first running stream that joins the
Morumbidgee, in a course of more than 340 miles. <!--page 83 AND OF
THE RIVER. /page-->It came from the S.E., and made a visible
impression on the river at the junction, although in tracing it up,
it appeared to be insignificant in itself. The circumstance of
these tributaries all occurring on the left, evidenced the level
nature of the country to the north. In the afternoon, we passed a
dry creek also from the S.E. which must at times throw a vast
supply of water into the river, since for many miles below, the
latter preserved a breadth of 200 feet, and averaged from 12 to 20
feet in depth, with banks of from 15 to 18 feet in height. Yet,
notwithstanding its general equality of depth, several rapids
occurred, down which the boats were hurried with great velocity.
The body of water in the river continued undiminished,
notwithstanding its increased breadth of channel; for which reason
I should imagine that it is fed by springs, independently of other
supplies. Some few cypresses were again observed, and the character
of the distant country resembled, in every particular, that of the
interior between the Macquarie and the Darling. The general
appearance of the Morumbidgee, from the moment of our starting on
the 13th, to a late hour in the afternoon, had been such as to
encourage my hopes of ultimate success in tracing it down; but
about three o'clock we came to one of those unaccountable and
mortifying changes which had already so frequently excited my
apprehension. Its channel again suddenly contracted, and became
almost blocked up with huge trees, that must have found their way
into it down the creeks or junctions we had lately passed. The
rapidity of the current increasing at the same <!--page
84 DANGEROUS NAVIGATION /page-->time, rendered the navigation
perplexing and dangerous. We passed reach after reach, presenting
the same difficulties, and were at length obliged to pull up at 5
p.m., having a scene of confusion and danger before us that I did
not dare to encounter with the evening's light; for I had not only
observed that the men's eye-sight failed them as the sun descended,
and that they mistook shadows for objects under water, and <i>vice
versa</i>, but the channel had become so narrow that, although the
banks were not of increased height, we were involved in comparative
darkness, under a close arch of trees, and a danger was hardly seen
ere we were hurried past it, almost without the possibility of
avoiding it. The reach at the head of which we stopped, was crowded
with the trunks of trees, the branches of which crossed each other
in every direction, nor could I hope, after a minute examination of
the channel, to succeed in taking the boats safely down so
intricate a passage.</p>

<p>We rose in the morning with feelings of apprehension, and
uncertainty; and, indeed, with great doubts on our minds whether we
were not thus early destined to witness the wreck, and the defeat
of the expedition. The men got slowly and cautiously into the boat,
and placed themselves so as to leave no part of her undefended.
Hopkinson stood at the bow, ready with poles to turn her head from
anything upon which she might be drifting. Thus prepared, we
allowed her to go with the stream. By extreme care and attention on
the part of the men we passed this formidable barrier. Hopkinson in
particular exerted himself, and more
<!--page 85 OF THE MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->than once leapt from the
boat upon apparently rotten logs of wood, that I should not have
judged capable of bearing his weight, the more effectually to save
the boat. It might have been imagined that where such a quantity of
timber had accumulated, a clearer channel would have been found
below, but such was not the case. In every reach we had to
encounter fresh difficulties. In some places huge trees lay athwart
the stream, under whose arched branches we were obliged to pass;
but, generally speaking, they had been carried, roots foremost, by
the current, and, therefore, presented so many points to receive
us, that, at the rate at which we were going, had we struck full
upon any one of them, it would have gone through and through the
boat. About noon we stopped to repair, or rather to take down the
remains of our awning, which had been torn away; and to breathe a
moment from the state of apprehension and anxiety in which our
minds had been kept during the morning. About one, we again
started. The men looked anxiously out ahead; for the singular
change in the river had impressed on them an idea, that we were
approaching its termination, or near some adventure. On a sudden,
the river took a general southern direction, but, in its tortuous
course, swept round to every point of the compass with the greatest
irregularity. We were carried at a fearful rate down its gloomy and
contracted banks, and, in such a moment of excitement, had little
time to pay attention to the country through which we were passing.
It was, however, observed, that chalybeate-springs were numerous
close to the water's
<!--page 86 JUNCTION OF A LARGE RIVER. /page-->edge. At 3 p.m.,
Hopkinson called out that we were approaching a junction, and in
less than a minute afterwards, we were hurried into a broad and
noble river.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the effect of so
instantaneous a change of circumstances upon us. The boats were
allowed to drift along at pleasure, and such was the force with
which we had been shot out of the Morumbidgee, that we were carried
nearly to the bank opposite its embouchure, whilst we continued to
gaze in silent astonishment on the capacious channel we had
entered; and when we looked for that by which we had been led into
it, we could hardly believe that the insignificant gap that
presented itself to us was, indeed, the termination of the
beautiful and noble stream, whose course we had thus successfully
followed. I can only compare the relief we experienced to that
which the seaman feels on weathering the rock upon which he
expected his vessel would have struck&mdash;to the calm which
succeeds moments of feverish anxiety, when the dread of danger is
succeeded by the certainty of escape.</p>

<p>To myself personally, the discovery of this river was a
circumstance of a particularly gratifying nature, since it not only
confirmed the justness of my opinion as to the ultimate fate of the
Morumbidgee, and bore me out in the apparently rash and hasty step
I had taken at the depot, but assured me of ultimate success in the
duty I had to perform. We had got on the high road, as it were,
either to the south coast, or to some important outlet; and the
appearance of the river itself was such as to justify our most
sanguine <!--page 87 CHARACTER OF THE
RIVER. /page-->expectations. I could not doubt its being the great
channel of the streams from the S.E. angle of the island. Mr. Hume
had mentioned to me that he crossed three very considerable
streams, when employed with Mr. Hovell in 1823 in penetrating
towards Port Phillips, to which the names of the Goulburn, the
Hume, and the Ovens, had been given; and as I was 300 miles from
the track these gentlemen had pursued, I considered it more than
probable that those rivers must already have formed a junction
above me, more especially when I reflected that the convexity of
the mountains to the S.E. would necessarily direct the waters
falling inwards from them to a common centre.</p>

<p>We entered the new river at right angles, and, as I have
remarked, at the point of junction the channel of the Morumbidgee
had narrowed so as to bear all the appearance of an ordinary creek.
In breadth it did not exceed fifty feet, and if, instead of having
passed down it, I had been making my way up the principal streams,
I should little have dreamt that so dark and gloomy an outlet
concealed a river that would lead me to the haunts of civilized
man, and whose fountains rose amidst snow-clad mountains. Such,
however, is the characteristic of the streams falling to the
westward of the coast ranges. Descending into a low and level
interior, and depending on their immediate springs for existence,
they fall off, as they increase their distance from the base of the
mountains in which they rise, and in their lower branches give
little results of the promise they had previously made.
<!--page 88 ABSENCE OF
NATIVES. /page--></p>

<p>The opinion I have expressed, and which is founded on my
personal experience, that the rivers crossed by Messrs. Hovell and
Hume had already united above me, was strengthened by the capacity
of the stream we had just discovered. It had a medium width of 350
feet, with a depth of from twelve to twenty. Its reaches were from
half to three-quarters of a mile in length, and the views upon it
were splendid. Of course, as the Morumbidgee entered it from the
north, its first reach must have been E. and W., and it was so, as
nearly as possible; but it took us a little to the southward of the
latter point, in a distance of about eight miles that we pulled
down it in the course of the afternoon. We then landed and pitched
our tents for the night. Its transparent waters were running over a
sandy bed at the rate of two-and-a-half knots an hour, and its
banks, although averaging eighteen feet in height, were evidently
subject to floods.</p>

<p>We had not seen any natives since falling in with the last tribe
on the Morumbidgee. A cessation had, therefore, taken place in our
communication with them, in re-establishing which I anticipated
considerable difficulty. It appeared singular that we should not
have fallen in with any for several successive days, more
especially at the junction of the two rivers, as in similar
situations they generally have an establishment. In examining the
country back from the stream, I did not observe any large paths,
but it was evident that fires had made extensive ravages in the
neighbourhood, so that the country was, perhaps, only tem
<!--page 89 WEATHER, TEMPERATURE, &amp;c. /page-->porarily
deserted. Macnamee, who had wandered a little from the tents,
declared that he had seen about a dozen natives round a fire, from
whom (if he really did see them) he very precipitately fled, but I
was inclined to discredit his story, because in our journey on the
following day, we did not see even a casual wanderer.</p>

<p>The river maintained its character, and raised our hopes to the
highest pitch. Its breadth varied from 160 to 200 yards; and only
in one place, where a reef of iron-stone stretched nearly across
from the left bank, so as to contract the channel near the right
and to form a considerable rapid, was there any apparent
obstruction to our navigation. I was sorry, however, to remark that
the breadth of alluvial soil between its outer and inner banks was
very inconsiderable, and that the upper levels were poor and sandy.
Blue-gum generally occupied the former, while the usual productions
of the plains still predominated upon the latter, and showed that
the distant interior had not yet undergone any favourable change.
We experienced strong breezes from the north, but the range of the
thermometer was high, and the weather rather oppressive than
otherwise. On the night of the 16th, we had a strong wind from the
N.W., but it moderated with day-light, and shifted to the E.N.E.,
and the day was favourable and cool. Our progress was in every way
satisfactory, and if any change had taken place in the river, it
was that the banks had increased in height, in many places to
thirty feet, the soil being a red loam, and the surface much above
the reach of <!--page 90
INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->floods. The bank opposite to the
one that was so elevated, was proportionably low, and, in general,
not only heavily timbered, but covered with reeds, and backed by a
chain of ponds at the base of the outer embankment.</p>

<p>About 4 p.m., some natives were observed running by the river
side behind us, but on our turning the boat's head towards the
shore, they ran away. It was evident that they had no idea what we
were, and, from their timidity, feeling assured that it would be
impossible to bring them to a parley, we continued onwards till our
usual hour of stopping, when we pitched our tents on the left bank
for the night, it being the one opposite to that on which the
natives had appeared. We conjectured that their curiosity would
lead them to follow us, which they very shortly did; for we had
scarcely made ourselves comfortable when we heard their wild notes
through the woods as they advanced towards the river; and their
breaking into view with their spears and shields, and painted and
prepared as they were for battle, was extremely fine. They stood
threatening us, and making a great noise, for a considerable time,
but, finding that we took no notice of them, they, at length,
became quiet. I then walked to some little distance from the party,
and taking a branch in my hand, as a sign of peace, beckoned them
to swim to our side of the river, which, after some time, two or
three of them did. But they approached me with great caution,
hesitating at every step. They soon, however, gained confidence,
and were ultimately joined by all the males of
<!--page 91 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->their tribe. I gave
the <i>first</i> who swam the river a tomahawk (making this a rule
in order to encourage them) with which he was highly delighted. I
shortly afterwards placed them all in a row and fired a gun before
them: they were quite unprepared for such an explosion, and after
standing stupified and motionless for a moment or two, they
simultaneously took to their heels, to our great amusement. I
succeeded, however, in calling them back, and they regained their
confidence so much, that sixteen of them remained with us all
night, but the greater number retired at sunset.</p>

<p>On the following morning, they accompanied us down the river,
where we fell in with their tribe, who were stationed on an
elevated bank a short distance below&mdash;to the number of
eighty-three men, women, and children. Their appearance was
extremely picturesque and singular. They wanted us to land, but
time was too precious for such delays. Some of the boldest of the
natives swam round and round the boat so as to impede the use of
the oars, and the women on the bank evinced their astonishment by
mingled yells and cries. They entreated us, by signs, to remain
with them, but, as I foresaw a compliance on this occasion would
hereafter be attended with inconvenience, I thought it better to
proceed on our journey, and the natives soon ceased their
importunities, and, indeed, did not follow or molest us.</p>

<p>The river improved upon us at every mile. Its reaches were of
noble breadth, and splendid appearance. Its cur
<!--page 92 ASPECT OF THE
COUNTRY, /page-->rent was stronger, and it was fed by numerous
springs. Rocks, however, were more frequent in its bed, and in two
places almost formed a barrier across the channel, leaving but a
narrow space for the boats to go down. We passed several elevations
of from 70 to 90 feet in height, at the base of which the stream
swept along. The soil of these elevations was a mixture of clay
(marl) and sand, upon coarse sandstone. Their appearance and the
manner in which they had been acted upon by water, was singular,
and afforded a proof of the violence of the rains in this part of
the interior. From the highest of these, I observed that the
country to the S.E. was gently undulated, and so far changed in
character from that through which we had been travelling; still,
however, it was covered with a low scrub, and was barren and
unpromising.</p>

<p>About noon of the 18th, we surprised two women at the
water-side, who immediately retreated into the brush. Shortly
after, four men showed themselves, and followed us for a short
distance, but hid themselves upon our landing. The country still
appeared undulated to the S.E.; the soil was sandy, and cypresses
more abundant than any other tree. We passed several extensive
sand-banks in the river, of unusual size and solidity, an evident
proof of the sandy nature of the interior generally. The vast
accumulations of sand at the junctions of every creek were
particularly remarkable. The timber on the alluvial flats was not
by any means so large as we had hitherto observed it; nor were the
flats themselves so extensive as they are on the Morum<!--page 93
AND OF THE RIVER BANKS. /page-->bidgee and the Macquarie.
Notwithstanding the aspect of the country which I have described,
no <i>positive</i> change had as yet taken place in the general
feature of the interior. The river continued to flow in a direction
somewhat to the northward of west, through a country that underwent
no perceptible alteration. Its waters, confined to their immediate
bed, swept along considerably below the level of its inner banks;
and the spaces between them and the outer ones, though generally
covered with reeds, seemed not recently to have been flooded; while
on the other hand, they had, in many places, from successive
depositions, risen to a height far above the reach of inundation.
Still, however, the more remote interior maintained its sandy and
sterile character, and stretched away, in alternate plain and wood,
to a distance far beyond the limits of our examination.</p>

<p>About the 21st, a very evident change took place in it. The
banks of the river suddenly acquired a perpendicular and water-worn
appearance. Their summits were perfectly level, and no longer
confined by a secondary embankment, but preserved an uniform
equality of surface back from the stream. These banks, although so
abrupt, were not so high as the upper levels, or secondary
embankments. They indicated a deep alluvial deposit, and yet, being
high above the reach of any ordinary flood, were covered with
grass, under an open box forest, into which a moderately dense
scrub occasionally penetrated. We had fallen into a concavity
similar to those of the marshes, but successive depositions had
almost filled it, and no longer subject to in<!--page 94 THREATENED
ATTACK. /page-->undation, it had lost all the character of those
flooded tracts. The kind of country I have been describing, lay
rather to the right than to the left of the river at this place,
the latter continuing low and swampy, as if the country to the
south of the river were still subject to inundation. As the
expedition proceeded, the left bank gradually assumed the
appearance of the right; both looked water-worn and perpendicular,
and though not more than from nine to ten feet in height, their
summits were perfectly level in receding, and bore diminutive
box-timber, with widely-scattered vegetation. Not a single
elevation had, as yet, broken the dark and gloomy monotony of the
interior; but as our observations were limited to a short distance
from the river, our surmises on the nature of the distant country
were necessarily involved in some uncertainty.</p>

<br>
<b>STURT'S DISCOVERIES, 1828-9 AND 1829-30</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>On the 19th, as we were about to conclude our journey for the
day, we saw a large body of natives before us. On approaching them,
they showed every disposition for combat, and ran along the bank
with spears in rests, as if only waiting for an opportunity to
throw them at us. They were upon the right, and as the river was
broad enough to enable me to steer wide of them, I did not care
much for their threats; but upon another party appearing upon the
left bank, I thought it high time to disperse one or the other of
them, as the channel was not wide enough to enable me to keep clear
of danger, if assailed by both, as I might be while keeping amid
the channel. I found, however, that they did not know how to use
the advantage they
<!--page 95 AMICABLE CONFERENCE. /page-->possessed, as the two
divisions formed a junction; those on the left swimming over to the
stronger body upon the right bank. This, fortunately, prevented the
necessity of any hostile measure on my part, and we were suffered
to proceed unmolested, for the present. The whole then followed us
without any symptom of fear, but making a dreadful shouting, and
beating their spears and shields together, by way of intimidation.
It is but justice to my men to say that in this critical situation
they evinced the greatest coolness, though it was impossible for
any one to witness such a scene with indifference. As I did not
intend to fatigue the men by continuing to pull farther than we
were in the habit of doing, we landed at our usual time on the left
bank, and while the people were pitching the tents, I walked down
the bank with M'Leay, to treat with these desperadoes in the best
way we could, across the water, a measure to which my men showed
great reluctance, declaring that if during our absence the natives
approached them, they would undoubtedly fire upon them. I assured
them it was not my intention to go out of their sight. We took our
guns with us, but determined not to use them until the last
extremity, both from a reluctance to shed blood and with a view to
our future security. I held a long pantomimical dialogue with them,
across the water, and held out the olive branch in token of amity.
They at length laid aside their spears, and a long consultation
took place among them, which ended in two or three wading into the
river, contrary, as it appeared, to the earnest remonstrances of
the majority, who, <!--page 96 APPEARANCE
OF THE NATIVES. /page-->finding that their entreaties had no
effect, wept aloud, and followed them with a determination, I am
sure, of sharing their fate, whatever it might have been. As soon
as they landed, M'Leay and I retired to a little distance from the
bank, and sat down; that being the usual way among the natives of
the interior, to invite to an interview. When they saw us act thus,
they approached, and sat down by us, but without looking up, from a
kind of diffidence peculiar to them, and which exists even among
the nearest relatives, as I have already had occasion to observe.
As they gained confidence, however, they showed an excessive
curiosity, and stared at us in the most earnest manner. We now led
them to the camp, and I gave, as was my custom, the first who had
approached, a tomahawk; and to the others, some pieces of iron
hoop. Those who had crossed the river amounted to about thirty-five
in number. At sunset, the majority of them left us; but three old
men remained at the fire-side all night. I observed that few of
them had either lost their front teeth or lacerated their bodies,
as the more westerly tribes do. The most loathsome diseases
prevailed among them. Several were disabled by leprosy, or some
similar disorder, and two or three had entirely lost their sight.
They are, undoubtedly, a brave and a confiding people, and are by
no means wanting in natural affection. In person, they resemble the
mountain tribes. They had the thick lip, the sunken eye, the
extended nostril, and long beards, and both smooth and curly hair
are common among them. Their lower extremities appear to
<!--page 97 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->bear no proportion to
their bust in point of muscular strength; but the facility with
which they ascend trees of the largest growth, and the activity
with which they move upon all occasions, together with their
singularly erect stature, argue that such appearance is entirely
deceptive.</p>

<p>The old men slept very soundly by the fire, and were the last to
get up in the morning. M'Leay's extreme good humour had made a most
favourable impression upon them, and I can picture him, even now,
joining in their wild song. Whether it was from his entering so
readily into their mirth, or from anything peculiar that struck
them, the impression upon the whole of us was, that they took him
to have been originally a black, in consequence of which they gave
him the name of Rundi. Certain it is, they pressed him to show his
side, and asked if he had not received a wound
there&mdash;evidently as if the original Rundi had met with a
violent death from a spear-wound in that place. The whole tribe,
amounting in number to upwards of 150, assembled to see us take our
departure. Four of them accompanied us, among whom there was one
remarkable for personal strength and stature.&mdash;The 21st passed
without our falling in with any new tribe, and the night of the
22nd, saw us still wandering in that lonely desert together. There
was something unusual in our going through such an extent of
country without meeting another tribe, but our companions appeared
to be perfectly aware of the absence of inhabitants, as they never
left our side.</p>

<p>Although the banks of the river had been of general <!--page 98
RAPID IN THE RIVER. /page-->equality of height, sandy elevations
still occasionally formed a part of them, and their summits were
considerably higher than the alluvial flats.</p>

<p>It was upon the crest of one of these steep and lofty banks,
that on the morning of the 22nd, the natives who were a-head of the
boat, suddenly stopped to watch our proceedings down a foaming
rapid that ran beneath. We were not aware of the danger to which we
were approaching, until we turned an angle of the river, and found
ourselves too near to retreat. In such a moment, without knowing
what was before them, the coolness of the men was strikingly
exemplified. No one even spoke after they became aware that silence
was necessary. The natives (probably anticipating misfortune) stood
leaning upon their spears upon the lofty bank above us. Desiring
the men not to move from their seats, I stood up to survey the
channel, and to steer the boat to that part of it which was least
impeded by rocks. I was obliged to decide upon a hasty survey, as
we were already at the head of the rapid. It appeared to me that
there were two passages, the one down the centre of the river, the
other immediately under its right bank. A considerable rock stood
directly in own way to the latter, so that I had no alternative but
to descend the former. About forty yards below the rock, I noticed
that a line of rocks occupied the space between the two channels,
whilst a reef, projecting from the left bank, made the central
passage distinctly visible, and the rapidity of the current
proportionably great. I entertained hopes that the passage was
<!--page 99 DANGEROUS DESCENT OF THE BOATS. /page-->clear, and that
we should shoot down it without interruption; but in this I was
disappointed. The boat struck with the fore-part of her keel on a
sunken rock, and, swinging round as it were on a pivot, presented
her bow to the rapid, while the skiff floated away into the
strength of it. We had every reason to anticipate the loss of our
whale-boat, whose build was so light, that had her side struck the
rock, instead of her keel, she would have been laid open from stem
to stern. As it was, however, she remained fixed in her position,
and it only remained for us to get her off the best way we could. I
saw that this could only be done by sending two of the men with a
rope to the upper rock, and getting the boat, by that means, into
the still water, between that and the lower one. We should then
have time to examine the channels, and to decide as to that down
which it would be safest to proceed. My only fear was, that the
loss of the weight of the two men would lighten the boat so much,
that she would be precipitated down the rapid without my having any
command over her; but it happened otherwise. We succeeded in
getting her into the still water, and ultimately took her down the
channel under the right bank, without her sustaining any injury. A
few miles below this rapid the river took a singular bend, and we
found, after pulling several miles, that we were within a stone's
throw of a part of the stream we had already sailed down.</p>

<p>The four natives joined us in the camp, and assisted the men at
their various occupations. The consequence was,
<!--page 100 DESERTED
NATIVE VILLAGE. /page-->that they were treated with more than
ordinary kindness; and Fraser, for his part, in order to gratify
these favoured guests, made great havoc among the feathered race.
He returned after a short ramble with a variety of game, among
which were a crow, a kite, and a laughing jackass (alcedo
gigantea,) a species of king's-fisher, a singular bird, found in
every part of Australia. Its cry, which resembles a chorus of wild
spirits, is apt to startle the traveller who may be in jeopardy, as
if laughing and mocking at his misfortune. It is a harmless bird,
and I seldom allowed them to be destroyed, as they were sure to
rouse us with the earliest dawn. To this list of Fraser's spoils, a
duck and a tough old cockatoo, must be added. The whole of these
our friends threw on the fire without the delay of plucking, and
snatched them from that consuming element ere they were well
singed, and devoured them with uncommon relish.</p>

<p>We pitched our tents upon a flat of good and tenacious soil. A
brush, in which there was a new species of melaleuca, backed it, in
the thickest part of which we found a deserted native village. The
spot was evidently chosen for shelter. The huts were large and
long, all facing the same point of the compass, and in every way
resembling the huts occupied by the natives of the Darling. Large
flocks of whistling ducks, and other wild fowl, flew over our heads
to the N.W., as if making their way to some large or favourite
waters. My observations placed us in lat. 34&deg; 8' 15" south, and
in east long. 141&deg; 9' 42" or nearly so; and I was <!--page 101
CONVERSING BY SIGNS. /page-->at a loss to conceive what direction
the river would ultimately take. We were considerably to the N.W.
of the point at which we had entered it, and in referring to the
chart, it appeared, that if the Darling had kept a S.W. course from
where the last expedition left its banks, we ought ere this to have
struck upon it, or have arrived at its junction with the stream on
which we were journeying.</p>

<p>The natives, in attempting to answer my interrogatories, only
perplexed me more and more. They evidently wished to explain
something, by placing a number of sticks across each other as a
kind of diagram of the country. It was, however, impossible to
arrive at their meaning. They undoubtedly pointed to the westward,
or rather to the south of that point, as the future course of the
river; but there was something more that they were anxious to
explain, which I could not comprehend. The poor fellows seemed
quite disappointed, and endeavoured to beat it into Fraser's head
with as little success. I then desired Macnamee to get up into a
tree. From the upper branches of it he said he could see hills; but
his account of their appearance was such that I doubted his story:
nevertheless it might have been correct. He certainly called our
attention to a large fire, as if the country to the N.W. was in
flames, so that it appeared we were approaching the haunts of the
natives at last.</p>

<p>It happened that Fraser and Harris were for guard, and they sat
up laughing and talking with the natives long after we retired to
rest. Fraser, to beguile the hours, proposed shaving his sable
companions, and performed that opera
<!--page 102 LARGE CONCOURSE OF NATIVES. /page-->tion with
admirable dexterity upon their chief, to his great delight. I got
up at an early hour, and found to my surprise that the whole of
them had deserted us. Harris told me they had risen from the fire
about an hour before, and had crossed the river. I was a little
angry, but supposed they were aware that we were near some tribe,
and had gone on a-head to prepare and collect them.</p>

<p>After breakfast, we proceeded onwards as usual. The river had
increased so much in width that, the wind being fair, I hoisted
sail for the first time, to save the strength of my men as much as
possible. Our progress was consequently rapid. We passed through a
country that, from the nature of its soil and other circumstances,
appeared to be intersected by creeks and lagoons. Vast flights of
wild fowl passed over us, but always at a considerable elevation,
while, on the other hand, the paucity of ducks on the river excited
our surprise. Latterly, the trees upon the river, and in its
neighbourhood, had been a tortuous kind of box. The flooded-gum
grew in groups on the spaces subject to inundation, but not on the
levels above the influence of any ordinary rise of the stream.
Still they were much smaller than they were observed to be in the
higher branches of the river. We had proceeded about nine miles,
when we were surprised by the appearance in view, at the
termination of a reach, of a long line of magnificent trees of
green and dense foliage. As we sailed down the reach, we observed a
vast concourse of natives under them, and, on a nearer approach, we
not only heard their war-song, if
<!--page 103 THEIR HOSTILE DEMEANOUR. /page-->it might so be
called, but remarked that they were painted and armed, as they
generally are, prior to their engaging in deadly conflict.
Notwithstanding these outward signs of hostility, fancying that our
four friends were with them, I continued to steer directly in for
the bank on which they were collected. I found, however, when it
was almost too late to turn into the succeeding reach to our left,
that an attempt to land would only be attended with loss of life.
The natives seemed determined to resist it. We approached so near
that they held their spears quivering in their grasp ready to hurl.
They were painted in various ways. Some who had marked their ribs,
and thighs, and faces with a white pigment, looked like skeletons,
others were daubed over with red and yellow ochre, and their bodies
shone with the grease with which they had besmeared themselves. A
dead silence prevailed among the front ranks, but those in the back
ground, as well as the women, who carried supplies of darts, and
who appeared to have had a bucket of whitewash capsized over their
heads, were extremely clamorous. As I did not wish a conflict with
these people, I lowered my sail, and putting the helm to starboard,
we passed quietly down the stream in mid channel. Disappointed in
their anticipations, the natives ran along the bank of the river,
endeavouring to secure an aim at us; but, unable to throw with
certainty, in consequence of the onward motion of the boat, they
flung themselves into the most extravagant attitudes, and worked
themselves into a state of frenzy by loud and vehement shouting.
<!--page 104 PREPARATIONS FOR
CONFLICT. /page--></p>

<p>It was with considerable apprehension that I observed the river
to be shoaling fast, more especially as a huge sand-bank, a little
below us, and on the same side on which the natives had gathered,
projected nearly a third-way across the channel. To this sand-bank
they ran with tumultuous uproar, and covered it over in a dense
mass. Some of the chiefs advanced to the water to be nearer their
victims, and turned from time to time to direct their followers.
With every pacific disposition, and an extreme reluctance to take
away life, I foresaw that it would be impossible any longer to
avoid an engagement, yet with such fearful numbers against us, I
was doubtful of the result. The spectacle we had witnessed had been
one of the most appalling kind, and sufficient to shake the
firmness of most men; but at that trying moment my little band
preserved their temper coolness, and if any thing could be gleaned
from their countenances, it was that they had determined on an
obstinate resistance. I now explained to them that their only
chance of escape depended, or would depend, on their firmness. I
desired that after the first volley had been fired, M'Leay and
three of the men, would attend to the defence of the boat with
bayonets only, while I, Hopkinson, and Harris, would keep up the
fire as being more used to it. I ordered, however, that no shot was
to be fired until after I had discharged both my barrels. I then
delivered their arms to the men, which had as yet been kept in the
place appropriated for them, and at the same time some rounds of
loose cartridge. The men assured me they would follow my instruc
<!--page 105 UNEXPECTED
INTERFERENCE. /page-->tions, and thus prepared, having already
lowered the sail, we drifted onwards with the current. As we neared
the sand-bank, I stood up and made signs to the natives to desist;
but without success. I took up my gun, therefore, and cocking it,
had already brought it down to a level. A few seconds more would
have closed the life of the nearest of the savages. The distance
was too trifling for me to doubt the fatal effects of the
discharge; for I was determined to take deadly aim, in hopes that
the fall of one man might save the lives of many. But at the very
moment, when my hand was on the trigger, and my eye was along the
barrel, my purpose was checked by M'Leay, who called to me that
another party of blacks had made their appearance upon the left
bank of the river. Turning round, I observed four men at the top of
their speed. The foremost of them as soon as he got a-head of the
boat, threw himself from a considerable height into the water. He
struggled across the channel to the sand-bank, and in an incredibly
short space of time stood in front of the savage, against whom my
aim had been directed. Seizing him by the throat, he pushed
backwards, and forcing all who were in the water upon the bank, he
trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation that were
exceedingly striking. At one moment pointing to the boat, at
another shaking his clenched hand in the faces of the most forward,
and stamping with passion on the sand; his voice, that was at first
distinct and clear, was lost in hoarse murmurs. Two of the four
natives remained on the left bank of the river, but
<!--page 106 JUNCTION OF ANOTHER STREAM. /page-->the third followed
his leader, (who proved to be the remarkable savage I have
previously noticed) to the scene of action. The reader will imagine
our feelings on this occasion: it is impossible to describe them.
We were so wholly lost in interest at the scene that was passing,
that the boat was allowed to drift at pleasure. For my own part I
was overwhelmed with astonishment, and in truth stunned and
confused; so singular, so unexpected, and so strikingly
providential, had been our escape.</p>

<p>We were again roused to action by the boat suddenly striking
upon a shoal, which reached from one side of the river to the
other. To jump out and push her into deeper water was but the work
of a moment with the men, and it was just as she floated again that
our attention was withdrawn to a new and beautiful stream, coming
apparently from the north. The great body of the natives having
posted themselves on the narrow tongue of land formed by the two
rivers, the bold savage who had so unhesitatingly interfered on our
account, was still in hot dispute with them, and I really feared
his generous warmth would have brought down upon him the vengeance
of the tribes. I hesitated, therefore, whether or not to go to his
assistance. It appeared, however, both to M'Leay and myself, that
the tone of the natives had moderated, and the old and young men
having listened to the remonstrances of our friend, the middle-aged
warriors were alone holding out against him. A party of about
seventy blacks were upon the right bank of the newly discovered
river, and I thought that by land<!--page 107 PROVIDENTIAL
DELIVERANCE FROM DANGER. /page-->ing among them, we should make a
diversion in favour of our late guest; and in this I succeeded. If
even they had still meditated violence, they would have to swim a
good broad junction, and that, probably, would cool them, or we at
least should have the advantage of position. I therefore, ran the
boat ashore, and landed with M'Leay amidst the smaller party of
natives, wholly unarmed, and having directed the men to keep at a
little distance from the bank. Fortunately, what I anticipated was
brought about by the stratagem to which I had had recourse. The
blacks no sooner observed that we had landed, than curiosity took
place of anger. All wrangling ceased, and they came swimming over
to us like a parcel of seals. Thus, in less than a quarter of an
hour from the moment when it appeared that all human intervention
was at on end, and we were on the point of commencing a bloody
fray, which, independently of its own disastrous consequences,
would have blasted the success of the expedition, we were
peacefully surrounded by the hundreds who had so lately threatened
us with destruction; nor was it until after we had returned to the
boat, and had surveyed the multitude upon the sloping bank above
us, that we became fully aware of the extent of our danger, and of
the almost miraculous intervention of Providence in our favour.
There could not have been less than six hundred natives upon that
blackened sward. But this was not the only occasion upon which the
merciful superintendance of that Providence to which we had humbly
committed ourselves, was strikingly manifested. If these pages fail
to convey <!--page 108 NEW RIVER, /page-->entertainment or
information, sufficient may at least be gleaned from them to
furnish matter for serious reflection; but to those who have been
placed in situations of danger where human ingenuity availed them
not, and where human foresight was baffled, I feel persuaded that
these remarks are unnecessary.</p>

<p>It was my first care to call for our friend, and to express to
him, as well as I could, how much we stood indebted to him, at the
same time that I made him a suitable present; but to the chiefs of
the tribes, I positively refused all gifts, notwithstanding their
earnest solicitations. We next prepared to examine the new river,
and turning the boat's head towards it, endeavoured to pull up the
stream. Our larboard oars touched the right bank, and the current
was too strong for us to conquer it with a pair only; we were,
therefore, obliged to put a second upon her, a movement that
excited the astonishment and admiration of the natives. One old
woman seemed in absolute ecstasy, to whom M'Leay threw an old tin
kettle, in recompense for the amusement she afforded us.</p>

<p>As soon as we got above the entrance of the new river, we found
easier pulling, and proceeded up it for some miles, accompanied by
the once more noisy multitude. The river preserved a breadth of one
hundred yards, and a depth of rather more than twelve feet. Its
banks were sloping and grassy, and were overhung by trees of
magnificent size. Indeed, its appearance was so different from the
water-worn banks of the sister stream, that the men ex
<!--page 109 SUPPOSED TO BE THE
DARLING. /page-->claimed, on entering it, that we had got into an
English river. Its appearance certainly almost justified the
expression; for the greenness of its banks was as new to us as the
size of its timber. Its waters, though sweet, were turbid, and had
a taste of vegetable decay, as well as a slight tinge of green. Our
progress was watched by the natives with evident anxiety. They kept
abreast of us, and talked incessantly. At length, however, our
course was checked by a net that stretched right across the stream.
I say checked, because it would have been unfair to have passed
over it with the chance of disappointing the numbers who apparently
depended on it for subsistence that day. The moment was one of
intense interest to me. As the men rested upon their oars, awaiting
my further orders, a crowd of thoughts rushed upon me. The various
conjectures I had formed of the course and importance of the
Darling passed across my mind. Were they indeed realized? An
irresistible conviction impressed me that we were now sailing on
the bosom of that very stream from whose banks I had been twice
forced to retire. I directed the Union Jack to be hoisted, and
giving way to our satisfaction, we all stood up in the boat, and
gave three distinct cheers. It was an English feeling, an
ebullition, an overflow, which I am ready to admit that our
circumstances and situation will alone excuse. The eye of every
native had been fixed upon that noble flag, at all times a
beautiful object, and to them a novel one, as it waved over us in
the heart of a desert. They had, until that moment been
particularly <!--page 110 HOIST THE UNION JACK. /page-->loquacious,
but the sight of that flag and the sound of our voices hushed the
tumult, and while they were still lost in astonishment, the boat's
head was speedily turned, the sail was sheeted home, both wind and
current were in our favour, and we vanished from them with a
rapidity that surprised even ourselves, and which precluded every
hope of the most adventurous among them to keep up with us.</p>

<p>Arrived once more at the junction of the two rivers, and
unmolested in our occupations, we had leisure to examine it more
closely. Not having as yet given a name to our first discovery,
when we re-entered its capacious channel on this occasion, I laid
it down as the Murray River, in compliment to the distinguished
officer, Sir George Murray, who then presided over the colonial
department, not only in compliance with the known wishes of his
Excellency General Darling, but also in accordance with my own
feelings as a soldier. <!--page 112 INUNDATED AND
ALLUVIAL COUNTRY. /page--></p>

<p>The new river, whether the Darling or an additional discovery,
meets its more southern rival on a N. by E. course; the latter,
running W.S.W. at the confluence, the angle formed by the two
rivers, is, therefore, so small that both may be considered to
preserve their proper course, and neither can be said to be
tributary to the other. At their junction, the Murray spreads its
waters over the broad and sandy shore, upon which our boat
grounded, while its more impetuous neighbour flows through the deep
but narrow channel it has worked out for itself, under the right
bank. The strength of their currents must have been nearly equal,
since there was as distinct a line between their respective waters,
to a considerable distance below the junction, as if a thin board
alone separated them. The one half the channel contained the turbid
waters of the northern stream, the other still preserved their
original transparency.</p>

<p>The banks of the Murray did not undergo any immediate change as
we proceeded. We noticed that the country had, at some time, been
subject to extensive inundation, and was, beyond doubt, of alluvial
formation. We passed the mouths of several large creeks that came
from the north and N.W., and the country in those directions seemed
to be much intersected by water-courses; while to the south it was
extremely low. Having descended several minor rapids, I greatly
regretted that we had no barometer to ascertain the actual dip of
the interior. I computed, however, that we were not more than from
eighty to ninety feet above the level of the sea. We found the
<!--page 113 STATE OF PROVISIONS. /page-->channel of the Murray
much encumbered with timber, and noticed some banks of sand that
were of unusual size, and equalled the largest accumulations of it
on the sea shore, both in extent and solidity.</p>

<p>We would gladly have fired into the flights of wild fowl that
winged their way over us, for we, about this time, began to feel
the consequences of the disaster that befell us in the Morumbidgee.
The fresh water having got mixed with the brine in the meat casks,
the greater part of our salt provisions had got spoiled, so that we
were obliged to be extremely economical in the expenditure of what
remained, as we knew not to what straits we might be driven. It
will naturally be asked why we did not procure fish? The answer is
easy. The men had caught many in the Morumbidgee, and on our first
navigation of the Murray, but whether it was that they had
disagreed with them, or that their appetites were palled, or that
they were too fatigued after the labour of the day to set the
lines, they did not appear to care about them. The only fish we
could take was the common cod or perch; and, without sauce or
butter, it is insipid enough. We occasionally exchanged pieces of
iron-hoop for two other kinds of fish, the one a bream, the other a
barbel, with the natives, and the eagerness with which they met our
advances to barter, is a strong proof of their natural disposition
towards this first step in civilization.</p>

<p>As they threw off all reserve when accompanying us as
ambassadors, we had frequent opportunities of observing their
habits. The facility, for instance, with which they pro
<!--page 114 DEXTERITY OF NATIVES IN
FISHING. /page-->cured fish was really surprising. They would slip,
feet foremost, into the water as they walked along the bank of the
river, as if they had accidentally done so, but, in reality, to
avoid the splash they would necessarily have made if they had
plunged in head foremost. As surely as they then disappeared under
the surface of the water, so surely would they re-appear with a
fish writhing upon the point of their short spears. The very otter
scarcely exceeds them in power over the finny race, and so true is
the aim of these savages, even under water, that all the fish we
procured from them were pierced either close behind the lateral
fin, or in the very centre of the head, It is certain, from their
indifference to them, that the natives seldom eat fish when they
can get anything else. Indeed, they seemed more anxious to take the
small turtle, which, sunning themselves on the trunks or logs of
trees over the water, were, nevertheless, extremely on their guard.
A gentle splash alone indicated to us that any thing had dropped
into the water, but the quick eyes and ears of our guides
immediately detected what had occasioned it, and they seldom failed
to take the poor little animal that had so vainly trusted to its
own watchfulness for security. It appeared that the natives did
not, from choice, frequent the Murray; it was evident, therefore,
that they had other and better means of subsistence away from it,
and it struck me, at the time, that the river we had just passed
watered a better country than any through which the Murray had been
found to flow. <!--page 115 BREAK UP THE
SKIFF. /page--></p>

<p>We encamped rather earlier than usual upon the left bank of the
river, near a broad creek; for as the skiff had been a great drag
upon us, I determined on breaking it up, since there was no
probability that we should ever require the still, which alone
remained in her. We, consequently, burnt the former, to secure her
nails and iron work, and I set Clayton about cutting the copper of
the latter into the shape of crescents, in order to present them to
the natives. Some large huts were observed on the side of the
creek, a little above the camp, the whole of which faced the N.E.
This arrangement had previously been noticed by us, so that I was
led to infer that the severest weather comes from the opposite
quarter in this part of the interior. I had not the least idea, at
the time, however, that we should, ere we reached the termination
of our journey, experience the effects of the S.W. winds.</p>

<p>We must have fallen considerably during the day from the level
of our morning's position, for we passed down many reaches where
the decline of country gave an increased velocity to the current of
the river.</p>

<p>I had feared, not only in consequence of the unceremonious
manner in which we had left them, but, because I had, in some
measure, rejected the advances of their chiefs, that none of the
natives would follow us, and I regretted the circumstance on
account of my men, as well as the trouble we should necessarily
have in conciliating the next tribe. We had not, however, been long
encamped, when seven blacks joined us. I think they would have
passed <!--page 116 NEW RIVER IDENTIFIED /page-->on if we had not
called to them. As it was, they remained with us but for a short
time. We treated them very kindly, but they were evidently under
constraint, and were, no doubt, glad when they found we did not
object to their departing.</p>

<p>I have stated, that I felt satisfied in my own mind, that the
beautiful stream we had passed was no other than the river Darling
of my former journey. The bare assertion, however, is not
sufficient to satisfy the mind of the reader, upon a point of such
importance, more especially when it is considered how remarkable a
change the Darling must have undergone, if this were indeed a
continuation of it. I am free to confess that it required an effort
to convince myself, but after due consideration, I see no reason to
alter the opinion I formed at a moment of peculiar embarrassment.
Yet it by no means follows that I shall convince others, although I
am myself convinced. The question is one of curious speculation,
and the consideration of it will lead us to an interesting
conjecture, as to the probable nature of the distant interior,
between the two points. It will be remembered that I was obliged to
relinquish my pursuit of the Darling, in east long. 144&deg; 48'
30" in lat. 30&deg; 17' 30" south. I place the junction of the
Murray and the new river, in long. 140&deg; 56' east, and in south
lat. 34&deg; 3'. I must remark, however, that the lunars I took on
this last occasion, were not satisfactory, and that there is,
probably, an error, though not a material one, in the calculation.
Before I measure the distance between the above points, or make any
remarks <!--page 117 WITH
THE DARLING. /page-->on the results of my own observations, I would
impress the following facts upon the reader's mind.</p>

<p>I found and left the Darling in a complete state of exhaustion.
As a river it had ceased to flow; the only supply it received was
from brine springs, which, without imparting a current, rendered
its waters saline and useless, and lastly, the fish in it were
different from those inhabiting the other known rivers of the
interior. It is true, I did not procure a perfect specimen of one,
but we satisfactorily ascertained that they were different,
inasmuch as they had large and strong scales, whereas the fish in
the western waters have smooth skins. On the other hand, the waters
of the new river were sweet, although turbid; it had a rapid
current in it; and its fish were of the ordinary kind. In the above
particulars, therefore, they differed much as they could well
differ. Yet there were some strong points of resemblance in the
appearance of the rivers themselves, which were more evident to me
than I can hope to make them to the reader. Both were shaded by
trees of the same magnificent dimensions; and the same kind of huts
were erected on the banks of each, inhabited by the same
description, or race, of people, whose weapons, whose implements,
and whose nets corresponded in most respects.</p>

<p>It now appeared that the Murray had taken a permanent southerly
course; indeed, it might strictly be said that it ran away to the
south. As we proceeded down it, the valley expanded to the width of
two miles; the alluvial flats became proportionably larger; and a
small lake generally occupied their centre. They were extensively
covered with reeds and grass, for which reason, notwithstanding
that they were little elevated above the level of the stream, I do
not think they are subject to overflow. Parts of them may be laid
under water, but certainly not the whole. The rains at the head of
the Murray, and its tributaries, must be unusually severe to
prolong their effects to this distant <!--page
152 DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY. /page-->region, and the flats bordering it
appear, by successive depositions, to have only just gained a
height above the further influence of the floods. Should this prove
to be the case, the valley may be decidedly laid down as a most
desirable spot, whether we regard the richness of its soil, its
rock formation, its locality, or the extreme facility of water
communication along it. It must not, however, be forgotten or
concealed, that the summits of the cliffs by which the valley is
enclosed, have not a corresponding soil. On the contrary, many of
the productions common to the plains of the interior still existed
upon them, and they were decidedly barren; but as we measured the
reaches of the river, the cliffs ceased, and gave place to
undulating hills, that were very different in appearance from the
country we had previously noted down. It would have been impossible
for the most tasteful individual to have laid out pleasure ground
to more advantage, than Nature had done in planting and disposing
the various groups of trees along the spine, and upon the sides of
the elevations that confined the river, and bounded the low ground
that intervened between it and their base. Still, however, the soil
upon these elevations was sandy, and coarse, but the large
oat-grass was abundant upon them, which yielded pasture at least as
good as that in the broken country between Underaliga and
Morumbidgee.</p>

<p>We had now gained a distance of at least sixty miles from that
angle of the Murray at which it reaches its extreme west. The
general aspect of the country to our right was beautiful, and
several valleys branched away into the
<!--page 153 ADVERSE GALES. /page-->interior upon that side which
had a most promising appearance, and seemed to abound with
kangaroos, as the traces of them were numerous, and the dogs
succeeded in killing one, which, to our great mortification, we
could not find.</p>

<p>While, however, the country to the westward had so much to
recommend it, the hills to our left became extremely bare. It was
evident that the right was the sheltered side of the valley. The
few trees on the opposite side bent over to the N.E., as if under
the influence of some prevailing wind.</p>
<br>

<b>STURT'S DIAGRAM OF THE SEA MOUTH OF THE MURRAY</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>We experienced at this time a succession of gales from the S.W.,
against which we, on several occasions, found it useless to
contend: the waves on the river being heavy and short; and the
boat, driving her prow into them, sent the spray over us and soon
wet us through. Indeed, it is difficult for the reader to imagine
the heavy swell that rolled up the river, which had increased in
breadth to the third of a mile, and in the length of its reaches to
eight or ten. I was satisfied that we were not only navigating this
river at a particularly stormy, perhaps <i>the</i> stormy, season;
but also, that the influence of the S.W. wind is felt even as far
in the interior as to the supposed Darling; in consequence of the
uniform build of the huts, and the circumstance of their not only
facing the N.E., but also being almost invariably erected under the
lee of some bush.</p>

<p>The weather, under the influence of the wind we experienced, was
cool and pleasant, although the thermometer stood at a medium
height of 86&deg;; but we found it very dis
<!--page 154 OBLIGED TO TAKE
REPOSE. /page-->tressing to pull against the heavy breezes that
swept up the valley, and bent the reeds so as almost to make them
kiss the stream.</p>

<p>We communicated on the 6th and 7th with several large tribes of
natives, whose manners were on the whole quiet and inoffensive.
They distinctly informed us, that we were fast approaching the sea,
and, from what I could understand, we were nearer to it than the
coast line of Encounter Bay made us. We had placed sticks to
ascertain if there was any rise or fall of tide, but the troubled
state of the river prevented our experiments from being
satisfactory. By selecting a place, however, that was sheltered
from the effects of the wind, we ascertained that there was an
apparent rise of about eight inches.</p>

<p>It blew a heavy gale during the whole of the 7th; and we
laboured in vain at the oar. The gusts that swept the bosom of the
water, and the swell they caused, turned the boat from her course,
and prevented us from making an inch of way. The men were quite
exhausted, and, as they had conducted themselves so well, and had
been so patient, I felt myself obliged to grant them every
indulgence consistent with our safety. However precarious our
situation, it would have been vain, with our exhausted strength, to
have contended against the elements. We, therefore, pulled in to
the left bank of the river, and pitched our tents on a little
rising ground beyond the reeds that lined it.</p>

<p>I had been suffering very much front tooth-ache for the <!--page
155 CHRONOMETER BROKEN. /page-->last three or four days, and this
day felt the most violent pain from the wind. I was not, therefore,
sorry to get under even the poor shelter our tents afforded.
M'Leay, observing that I was in considerable pain, undertook to
wind up the chronometer; but, not understanding or knowing the
instrument, he unfortunately broke the spring. I shall not forget
the anxiety he expressed, and the regret he felt on the occasion;
nor do I think M'Leay recovered the shock this unlucky accident
gave him for two or three days, or until the novelty of other
scenes drove it from his recollection.</p>

<p>We landed close to the haunt of a small tribe of natives, who
came to us with the most perfect confidence, and assisted the men
in their occupations. They were cleaner and more healthy than any
tribe we had seen; and were extremely cheerful, although reserved
in some respects. As a mark of more than usual cleanliness, the
women had mats of oval shape, upon which they sat, made,
apparently, of rushes. There was a young girl among them of a most
cheerful disposition. She was about eighteen, was well made, and
really pretty. This girl was married to an elderly man who had
broken his leg, which having united in a bent shape, the limb was
almost useless. I really believe the girl thought we could cure her
husband, from her importunate manner to us. I regretted that I
could do nothing for the man, but to show that I was not
inattentive to her entreaties, I gave him a pair of trousers, and
desired Fraser to put them upon him; but the poor fellow
<!--page 156 APPEARANCE OF SOME /page-->cut so awkward an
appearance in them, that his wife became quite distressed, and
Fraser was obliged speedily to disencumber him from them again.</p>

<p>We could not gain any satisfactory information, as to the
termination of the river, from these people. It was evident that
some change was at hand; but what it was we could not
ascertain.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th, we left our fair friend and her lame
husband, and proceeded down the river. The wind had moderated,
although it still blew fresh. We ascended every height as we went
along, but could not see any new feature in the country. Our view
to the eastward was very confined; to the westward the interior was
low and dark, and was backed in the distance by lofty ranges,
parallel to which we had been running for some days. The right bank
of the valley was beautifully undulated, but the left was bleak and
bare. The valley had a breadth of from three to four miles, and the
flats were more extensive under the former than under the latter.
They were scarcely two feet above the level of the water, and were
densely covered with reeds. As there was no mark upon the reeds to
indicate the height to which the floods rose, I cannot think that
these flats are ever wholly laid under water; if they are, it
cannot be to any depth: at all events a few small drains would
effectually prevent inundation.</p>

<p>The soil upon the hills continued to be much mixed with sand,
and the prevailing trees were cypress and box. Among the minor
shrubs and grass, many common to the
<!--page 157 APPROACHING CHANGE. /page-->east coasts were noticed;
and although the bold cliffs had ceased, the basis of the country
still continued of the fossil formation. At a turn of the stream
hereabouts, however, a solitary rock of coarse red granite rose
above the waters, and formed an island in its centre; but only in
this one place was it visible. The rock was composed principally of
quartz and feldspar.</p>

<p>A little below it, we found a large tribe anxiously awaiting our
arrival. They crowded to the margin of the river with great
eagerness, and evinced more surprise at our appearance than any
tribe we had seen during the journey; but we left them very soon,
notwithstanding that they importuned us much to stay.</p>

<p>After pulling a mile or two, we found a clear horizon before us
to the south. The hills still continued upon our left, but we could
not see any elevation over the expanse of reeds to our right. The
river inclined to the left, and swept the base of the hills that
still continued on that side. I consequently landed once more to
survey the country.</p>

<p>I still retained a strong impression on my mind that some change
was at hand, and on this occasion, I was not disappointed; but the
view was one for which I was not altogether prepared. We had, at
length, arrived at the termination of the Murray. Immediately below
me was a beautiful lake, which appeared to be a fitting reservoir
for the noble stream that had led us to it; and which was now
ruffled by the breeze that swept over it. The ranges were more
distinctly visible, stretching from south to north, and were cer
<!--page 158 TERMINATION OF THE MURRAY /page-->tainly distant forty
miles. They had a regular unbroken outline; declining gradually to
the south, but terminating abruptly at a lofty mountain northerly.
I had no doubt on my mind of this being the Mount Lofty of Captain
Flinders; or that the range was that immediately to the eastward of
St. Vincent's Gulf&mdash;Since the accident to the chronometer, we
had not made any westing, so that we knew our position as nearly as
possible. Between us and the ranges a beautiful promontory shot
into the lake, being a continuation of the right bank of the
Murray. Over this promontory the waters stretched to the base of
the ranges, and formed an extensive bay. To the N.W. the country
was exceedingly low, but distant peaks were just visible over it.
To the S.W. a bold headland showed itself; beyond which, to the
westward, there was a clear and open sea visible, through a strait
formed by this headland and a point projecting from the opposite
shore. To the E. and S.E. the country was low, excepting the left
shore of the lake, which was backed by some minor elevations,
crowned with cypresses. Even while gazing on this fine scene, I
could not but regret that the Murray had thus terminated; for I
immediately foresaw that, in all probability, we should be
disappointed in finding any practicable communication between the
lake and the ocean, as it was evident that the former was not much
influenced by tides. The wind had again increased; it still blew
fresh from the S.W. and a heavy sea was rolling direct into the
mouth of the river. I hoped, notwithstanding, that we should have
been enabled to <!--page 159 IN A LARGE LAKE. /page-->make sail,
for which reason we entered the lake about 2 p.m. The natives had
kindled a large fire on a distant point between us and the further
headland, and to gain this point our efforts were now directed. The
waves were, however, too strong, and we were obliged to make for
the eastern shore, until such time as the weather should moderate.
We pitched our tents on a low track of land that stretched away
seemingly for many miles directly behind us to the eastward. It was
of the richest soil, being a black vegetable deposit, and although
now high above the influence, the lake had, it was evident, once
formed a part of its bed. The appearance of the country altogether
encouraged M'Leay and myself to walk out, in order to examine it
from some hills a little to the S.E. of the camp. From them we
observed that the flat extended over about fifty miles, and was
bounded by the elevations that continued easterly from the left
bank of the Murray to the north, and by a line of rising-ground to
the south. The whole was lightly wooded, and covered with grass.
The season must have been unusually dry, judging from the general
appearance of the vegetation, and from the circumstance of the
lagoons in the interior being wholly exhausted.</p>

<p>Thirty-three days had now passed over our heads since we left
the depot upon the Morumbidgee, twenty-six of which had been passed
upon the Murray. We had, at length, arrived at the grand reservoir
of those waters whose course and fate had previously been involved
in such obscurity. It remained for us to ascertain whether the
extensive sheet of water upon whose bosom we had embarked, had any
<!--page 160
DETAINED BY THE WIND. /page-->practicable communication with the
ocean, and whether the country in the neighbourhood of the coast
corresponded with that immediately behind our camp, or kept up its
sandy and sterile character to the very verge of the sea. As I have
already said, my hopes on the first of these points were
considerably damped, but I could not help anticipating a favourable
change in the latter, since its features had so entirely
changed.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty against which we had at present to
contend was the wind; and I dreaded the exertion it would call for,
to make head against it; for the men were so much reduced that I
felt convinced they were inadequate to any violent or prolonged
effort. It still blew fresh at 8 p.m., but at that time it began to
moderate. It may be imagined that I listened to its subdued gusts
with extreme anxiety. It did not wholly abate until after 2 a.m.,
when it gradually declined, and about 3 a light breeze sprung up
from the N. E.</p>

<p>We had again placed sticks to ascertain with more precision the
rise of tide, and found it to be the same as in the river. In the
stillness of the night too we thought we heard the roaring of the
sea, but I was myself uncertain upon the point, as the wind might
have caused the sound.</p>

<p>From the top of the hill from which we had obtained our first
view of the lake, I observed the waves breaking upon the distant
headland, and enveloping the cliff in spray; so that, independent
of the clearness of the horizon beyond it, I was further led to
conclude that there
<!--page 161 GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. /page-->existed a great expanse
of water to the S.W.; and, as that had been the direction taken by
the river, I thought it probable that by steering at once to the
S.W. down the lake, I should hit the outlet. I, consequently,
resolved to gain the southern extremity of the lake, as that at
which it was natural to expect a communication with the ocean would
be found.</p>

<p>At 4 we had a moderate breeze, and it promised to strengthen; we
lost no time therefore in embarking, and with a flowing sheet
stretched over to the W.S.W., and ran along the promontory formed
by the right bank of the Murray. We passed close under its extreme
point at nine. The hills had gradually declined, and we found the
point to be a flat, elevated about thirty feet above the lake. It
was separated from the promontory by a small channel that was
choked up with reeds, so that it is more than probable that the
point is insulated at certain periods; whilst in its stratification
it resembled the first cliffs I have described that were passed
below the Darling. It is a remarkable fact in the geology of the
Murray, that such should be the case; and that the formation at
each extremity of the great bank or bed of fossils should be the
same. Thus far, the waters of the lake had continued sweet; but on
filling a can when we were abreast of this point, it was found that
they were quite unpalatable, to say the least of them. The
transition from fresh to salt water was almost immediate, and it
was fortunate we made the discovery in sufficient time to prevent
our losing ground. But, as it was, we filled our
<!--page 162 PASSAGE ACROSS THE LAKE. /page-->casks, and stood on,
without for a moment altering our course.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give a just description of our passage across
the lake. The boisterous weather we had had seemed to have blown
over. A cool and refreshing breeze was carrying us on at between
four and five knots an hour, and the heavens above us were without
a cloud. It almost appeared as if nature had resisted us in order
to try our perseverance, and that she had yielded in pity to our
efforts. The men, relieved for a time from the oar, stretched
themselves at their length in the boat, and commented on the
scenery around them, or ventured their opinions as to that which
was before them. Up to this moment their conduct had been most
exemplary; not a murmur had escaped from them, and they filled the
water-casks with the utmost cheerfulness, even whilst tasting the
disagreeable beverage they would most probably have to subsist on
for the next three or four days.</p>

<p>As soon as we had well opened the point, we had a full view of
the splendid bay that, commencing at the western most of the
central points, swept in a beautiful curve under the ranges. No
land was visible to the W.N.W. or to the S.S.W.: in both these
quarters the lake was as open as the ocean. It appeared, therefore,
that the land intermediate was an island. To the north the country
was extremely low, and as we increased our distance from it we lost
sight of it altogether. At noon we were nearly abreast of the
eastern headland, or in the centre of the strait to which I
<!--page 163 ITS SHALLOWNESS. /page-->have alluded. At this time
there was an open sea from W.N.W. to N. by E. A meridian altitude
gave our latitude 35&deg; 25'. The land to our left was bold and
precipitous; that to the right was low and wooded; and there was
evidently a considerable space between the shores of the lake and
the base of the ranges. The country to the eastward was hidden from
us by the line of cliffs, beyond which from E.S.E. to W.S.W. there
was an open sea. We had kept the lead going from the first, and I
was surprised at the extreme shallowness of the lake in every part,
as we never had six feet upon the line. Its bottom was one of black
mud, and weeds of enormous length were floating on its surface,
detached by the late gales, and which, from the shallowness of the
lake, got constantly entangled with our rudder.</p>

<p>We tried to land on the eastern point, but found the water too
shallow, and were obliged to try the western shore. In passing
close under the head, we observed several natives upon it, who
kindled a large fire as soon as they saw they were noticed, which
was answered from every point; for, in less than ten minutes
afterwards, we counted no fewer than fourteen different fires, the
greater number of which were on the side of the ranges.</p>

<p>As we were standing across from one shore to the other, our
attention was drawn to a most singular object. It started suddenly
up, as above the waters to the south, and strikingly resembled an
isolated castle. Behind it, a dense column of smoke rose into the
sky, and the effect was
<!--page 164 SHORES OF THE LAKE. /page-->most remarkable. On a
nearer approach, the phantom disappeared and a clear and open sea
again presented itself to our view. The fact was, that the
refractive power upon the coast had elevated the sand-hillocks
above their true position, since we satisfactorily ascertained that
they alone separated the lake from the ocean, and that they alone
could have produced the semblance we noticed. It is a singular
fact, that this very hillock was the one which Capt. Barker
ascended whilst carrying on the survey of the south coast, and
immediately previous to his tragical death.</p>

<p>It was not without difficulty that we succeeded in landing on
the western shore; but we did, at length, succeed, and prepared our
dinners. The shore was low, but above the reach of all floods; the
soil was rich, and superficially sandy. It was covered with high
grasses, and abounded in kangaroos; within the space of a few yards
we found five or six, but they were immediately lost to us and to
the dogs in the luxuriance of the vegetation amidst which they were
feeding.</p>

<p>As soon as we had finished our meal, we once more embarked, and
stood along the shore to the S.W., but the lake was so shoal, that
I was every moment apprehensive we should ground. I ran across,
therefore, to the south, towards a low flat that had just appeared
above the line of the horizon, in hope that, in sounding, we should
have found the channel, but there either was none, or else it was
so narrow that we passed over it between the heaves of the lead. At
this time, the western shore was quite distinct, and the scenery
was beautiful. <!--page 165 WARLIKE
DEMEANOUR OF THE NATIVES. /page--></p>

<p>The flat we were approaching was a mud-flat, and, from its
appearance, the tide was certainly at the ebb. We observed some
cradles, or wicker frames, placed far below high water-mark, that
were each guarded by two natives, who threatened us violently as we
approached. In running along the land, the stench from them plainly
indicated what they were which these poor creatures were so
anxiously watching.</p>

<p>We steered a S.W. course, towards some low and wooded hills,
passing a rocky island, and found that we had struck the mouth of a
channel running to the W.S.W. It was about half-a-mile wide, was
bounded to the right by some open flat ground, and to the left by a
line of hills of about sixty or seventy feet in elevation, partly
open and partly covered with beefwood.</p>

<p>Upon the first of these hills, we observed a large body of
natives, who set up the most terrific yells as we approached. They
were fully equipped for battle and, as we neared the shore, came
down to meet us with the most violent threats. I wished much to
communicate with them, and, not without hopes of quieting them,
stood right in with the intention of landing. I observed, however,
that if I did so, I should have to protect myself. I hauled a
little off, and endeavoured, by holding up a branch and a tomahawk,
to gain their confidence, but they were not to be won over by my
show of pacification. An elderly man walked close to the water's
edge unarmed, and, evidently, directed the others. He was followed
by seven or eight of <!--page 166 LOVELY
EVENING. /page-->the most daring, who crept into the reeds, with
their spears shipped to throw at us. I, therefore, took up my gun
to return their salute. It then appeared that they were perfectly
aware of the weapon I carried, for the moment they saw it, they
dashed out of their hiding place and retreated to the main body;
but the old man, after saying something to them, walked steadily
on, and I, on my part, laid my firelock down again.</p>

<p>It was now near sunset; and one of the most lovely evenings I
had ever seen. The sun's radiance was yet upon the mountains, but
all lower objects were in shade. The banks of the channel, with the
trees and the rocks, were reflected in the tranquil waters, whose
surface was unruffled save by the thousands of wild fowl that rose
before us, and made a noise as of a multitude clapping hands, in
their clumsy efforts to rise from the waters. Not one of them
allowed us to get within shot.</p>

<p>We proceeded about a mile below the hill on which the natives
were posted; some few still following us with violent threats. We
landed, however, on a flat, bounded all round by the continuation
of the hills. It was an admirable position, for, in the centre of
it, we could not be taken by surprise, and, on the other hand, we
gave the natives an opportunity of communicating with us if they
would. The full moon rose as we were forming the camp, and,
notwithstanding our vicinity to so noisy a host, the silence of
death was around us, or the stillness of the night was only broken
by the roar of the ocean, now too near to be mistaken for
<!--page 167 EXTENT OF THE LAKE. /page-->wind, or by the silvery
and melancholy note of the black swans as they passed over us, to
seek for food, no doubt, among the slimy weeds at the head of the
lake. We had been quite delighted with the beauty of the channel,
which was rather more than half-a-mile in width. Numberless mounds,
that seemed to invite civilized man to erect his dwelling upon
them, presented themselves to our view. The country round them was
open, yet ornamentally wooded, and rocks and trees hung or drooped
over the waters.</p>

<p>We had in one day gained a position I once feared it would have
cost us infinite labour to have measured. Indeed, had we been
obliged to pull across the lake, unless during a calm, I am
convinced the men would have been wholly exhausted. We had to thank
a kind Providence that such was not the case, since it had extended
its mercy to us at so critical a moment. We had indeed need of all
the little strength we had remaining, and could ill have thrown it
away on such an effort as this would have required. I calculated
that we could not have run less than forty-five miles during the
day, a distance that, together with the eight miles we had advanced
the evening previously, would give the length of the lake at
fifty-three miles. We had approached to within twelve miles of the
ranges, but had not gained their southern extremity. From the camp,
Mount Barker bore nearly north. The ranges appeared to run north
and south to our position, and then to bend away to the S.S.W.,
gradually declining to that point,
<!--page 168 CHANNEL TO THE SEA. /page-->which I doubted not
terminated in Cape Jervis. The natives kept aloof during the night,
nor did the dogs by a single growl intimate that any had ventured
to approach us. The sound of the surf came gratefully to our ears,
for it told us we were near the goal for which we had so anxiously
pushed, and we all of us promised ourselves a view of the boundless
ocean on the morrow.</p>

<p>As the morning dawned, we saw that the natives had thrown an
out-post of sixteen men across the channel, who were watching our
motions; but none showed themselves on the hills behind us, or on
any part of the south shore. We embarked as soon as we had
breakfasted, A fresh breeze was blowing from the N.E. which took us
rapidly down the channel, and our prospects appeared to be as
cheering as the day, for just as we were about to push from the
shore, a seal rose close to the boat, which we all regarded as a
favourable omen. We were, however, shortly stopped by shoals; it
was in vain that we beat across the channel from one side to the
other; it was a continued shoal, and the deepest water appeared to
be under the left bank. The tide, however, had fallen, and exposed
broad flats, over which it was hopeless, under existing
circumstances, to haul the boat. We again landed on the south side
of the channel, patiently to await the high water.</p>

<p>M'Leay, myself, and Fraser, ascended the hills, and went to the
opposite side to ascertain the course of the channel, for
immediately above us it turned south round the hills. We there
found that we were on a narrow tongue
<!--page 169 ITS SHALLOWNESS. /page-->of land. The channel was
immediately below us, and continued to the E.S.E. as far as we
could trace it. The hills we were upon, were the sandy hills that
always bound a coast that is low, and were covered with banksias,
casuarina and the grass-tree.</p>

<p>To the south of the channel there was a flat, backed by a range
of sand-hummocks, that were covered with low shrubs; and beyond
them the sea was distinctly visible. We could not have been more
than two and a half miles from the beach where we stood.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sandy nature of the soil, the fossil
formation again showed itself, not only on these hills, but also on
the rocks that were in the channel.</p>

<p>A little before high water we again embarked. A seal had been
observed playing about, and we augured well from such an omen. The
blacks had been watching us from the opposite shore, and as soon as
we moved, rose to keep abreast of us. With all our efforts we could
not avoid the shoals. We walked up to our knees in mud and water,
to find the least variation in the depth of the water so as to
facilitate our exertions, but it was to no purpose. We were
ultimately obliged to drag the boat over the flats; there were some
of them a quarter of a mile in breadth, knee-deep in mud; but at
length got her into deep water again. The turn of the channel was
now before us, and we had a good run for about four or five miles.
We had completed the bend, and the channel now stretched to the
E.S.E. At about nine miles from us there was a bright
<!--page 170 BEACH OF ENCOUNTER BAY. /page-->sand-hill visible,
near which the channel seemed to turn again to the south; and I
doubted not that it terminated there. It was to no purpose,
however, that we tried to gain it. Shoals again closed in upon us
on every side. We dragged the boat over several, and at last got
amongst quicksands. I, therefore, directed our efforts to hauling
the boat over to the south side of the channel, as that on which we
could most satisfactorily ascertain our position. After great
labour we succeeded, and, as evening had closed in, lost no time in
pitching the tents.</p>

<p>While the men were thus employed, I took Fraser with me, and,
accompanied by M'Leay, crossed the sand-hummocks behind us, and
descended to the sea-shore. I found that we had struck the south
coast deep in the bight of Encounter Bay. We had no time for
examination, but returned immediately to the camp, as I intended to
give the men an opportunity to go to the beach. They accordingly
went and bathed, and returned not only highly delighted at this
little act of good nature on my part, but loaded with cockles, a
bed of which they had managed to find among the sand. Clayton had
tied one end of his shirt up, and brought a bag full, and amused
himself with boiling cockles all night long.</p>

<p>If I had previously any hopes of being enabled ultimately to
push the boat over the flats that were before us, a view of the
channel at low water, convinced me of the impracticability of any
further attempt. The water was so low that every shoal was exposed,
and many stretched directly
<!--page 171 CURIOUS EFFECT OF REFRACTION. /page-->from one side of
the channel to the other; and, but for the treacherous nature of
the sand-banks, it would not have been difficult to have walked
over dry footed to the opposite side of it. The channel stretched
away to the E.S.E., to a distance of seven or eight miles, when it
appeared to turn south under a small sand-hill, upon which the rays
of the sun fell, as it was sinking behind us.</p>

<p>There was an innumerable flock of wild-fowl arranged in rows
along the sides of the pools left by the tide, and we were again
amused by the singular effect of the refraction upon them, and the
grotesque and distorted forms they exhibited. Swans, pelicans,
ducks, and geese, were mingled together, and, according to their
distance from us, presented different appearances. Some were
exceedingly tall and thin, others were unnaturally broad. Some
appeared reversed, or as if they were standing on their heads, and
the slightest motion, particularly the flapping of their wings,
produced a most ridiculous effect. No doubt, the situation and the
state of the atmosphere were favourable to the effect I have
described. The day had been fine, the evening was
beautiful,&mdash;but it was the rarefaction of the air immediately
playing on the ground, and not the haze at sunset that caused what
I have noticed. It is distinct from mirage, although it is
difficult to point out the difference. The one, however, distorts,
the other conceals objects, and gives them a false distance. The
one is clear, the other is cloudy. The one raises objects above
their true position, the other does not. The one plays about, the
other <!--page 172 CRITICAL SITUATION /page-->is steady; but I
cannot hope to give a proper idea either of mirage or refraction so
satisfactorily as I could wish. Many travellers have dwelt upon
their effects, particularly upon those of the former, but few have
attempted to account for them.</p>

<p>Our situation was one of peculiar excitement and interest. To
our right the thunder of the heavy surf, that almost shook the
ground beneath us, broke with increasing roar upon our ears; to our
left the voice of the natives echoed through the brush, and the
size of their fires at the extremity of the channel, seemed to
indicate the alarm our appearance had occasioned.</p>

</p>

<p><i>June 29,</i> 1836.-The party moved forward in the direction
of Mount Hope, and leaving it on the left, we continued towards
Pyramid Hill, where we encamped at about three-quarters of a mile
from its base. We were under no restraint now in selecting a camp,
from any scarcity of water or grass; for all hollows in the plains
contained some water, and grass grew everywhere. The strips of wood
which diversified the country as seen from the hills, generally
enclosed a depression with polygonum bushes, but without any marks
of having had any water in them, although, in very wet seasons,
some probably lodges there, as in so many canals, and this indeed
seemed to me to be a country where canals would answer well, not so
much perhaps for inland navigation, as for the better distribution
of water over a fertile country, enclosed as this is by copious
rivers.</p>

<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;Having seen the party on the way, and
directed it to proceed on a bearing of 215&deg; from N., I ascended
the rocky pyramidic hill, which I found arose to the height of 300
feet above the plain. Its apex consisted of a single block of
granite, and the view was exceedingly beautiful over the
surrounding plains, shining fresh and green in the light of a fine
morning. The scene was different from anything I had ever before
witnessed, either in New South Wales or elsewhere. A land so
inviting, and still without inhabitants! As I stood, the first
European intruder on the sublime solitude of these verdant plains,
as yet untouched by flocks or herds, I felt conscious of being the
harbinger of mighty changes, and that our steps would soon be
followed by the men and the animals for which it seemed to have
been prepared. A haziness in the air prevented me, however, from
perceiving clearly the distant horizon from that summit, but I saw
and intersected those mountains to the southward, which I had
observed from Mount Hope.</p>

<p>The progress of the party was still visible from that hill,
pursuing their course over the distant plains, like a solitary line
of ants. I overtook it when a good many miles on, and we encamped
after travelling upwards of fourteen miles, in one uninterrupted,
straight line. Our camp was chosen on the skirts of a forest of
box, having a plain on the east covered with rich grass, and where
we found some small pools of rain water.</p>

<p><i>July 1.</i>&mdash;Proceeding still on the bearing followed
yesterday, we reached at three miles from our camp, a fine chain of
ponds. They were deep, full of water, and surrounded by strong
yarra trees. Passing them, we met a small scrub of casuarinae,
which we avoided; and we next entered on a fine plain, in which the
anthistiria or oatgrass appeared. This is the same grass which
grows on the most fertile parts of the counties of Argyle and
Murray, and is, I believe, the best Australian grass for cattle; it
is also one of the surest indications of a good soil and dry
situation. Beyond the plain, the line of noble yarra trees, which I
had observed from Mount Hope, gave almost certain promise of a
river; and at 61 miles our journey was terminated by a deep running
stream. The banks were steep, and about twenty feet high, but
covered thickly with grass to the edge of the water. The yarra
trees grew by the brink of the stream, and not on the top of the
bank. The water had a brown appearance as if it came from melted
snow, but from the equality of depth (about nine feet) and other
circumstances, I was of opinion that it was a permanent running
stream. The current ran at the rate of four chains in 122 seconds,
or near 11 miles per hour; thus it would appear, from what we had
seen, that there is much uniformity in the velocity of the rivers,
and consequently in the general inclination of the surface. The
banks of this little river were, however, very different in some
respects from any we had previously seen, being everywhere covered
thickly with grass. No fallen timber impeded its course, nor was
there any indication in the banks, that the course was ever in the
least degree affected by such obstructions. It was so narrow, that
I anticipated little difficulty in making a bridge by felling some
of the overhanging trees. Finding a large one already fallen across
the stream, where the slopes of the banks could be most readily
made passable, we lost no time in felling another, which broke
against the opposite bank and sunk into the water. No other large
trees grew near, but the banks were, at that place, so favourable
for the passage of the waggons, that I determined to take advantage
of the large fallen tree; and to construct a bridge by bringing
others of smaller dimensions to it, not unmindful of the useful
suggestions of Sir Howard Douglas, respecting temporary
bridges.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;Late in the evening of this day we
completed a bridge formed of short but strong sleepers, laid
diagonally to the fallen tree, which constituted its main support,
and the whole was covered with earth from cuttings made in the
banks to render it accessible to the carts. At length every thing
was ready for crossing, and we had thus a prospect of being able to
advance beyond the river, into that unknown but promising land of
hill and dale.</p>

<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;This morning our bridge was no longer to be
seen, the river having risen so much during the night, that it was
four feet under water. Yet no rain had fallen for five days
previous, and we could account for this unexpected flood only by
supposing that the powerful shining of the sun, during the last two
days, had melted the snow near the sources of the stream. At noon,
the water had risen fourteen feet. A whispering sound, much
resembling wind among the trees, now arose from it, and, however
inconvenient to us, the novelty of a sudden rise in the river was
quite refreshing, accustomed as we had been so long, to wander in
the beds of rivers and to seek in vain for water. Our little bridge
continued to be passable even when covered with four feet of water,
but as it had no parapets, we could not prevent some of the
bullocks from going over the side, on attempting to cross, when it
was thus covered. The river still continuing to rise, we were
compelled at last to launch the boats, and by this means, we
effected the passage of the whole party and equipment before
sunset; the boats having been also again mounted on the carriage
the same evening. The carts and boat-carriage were drawn through
the bed of the river by means of the drag-chains, which reached
from the carriage on one side, to a strong team of bullocks on the
other. This was a very busy day for the whole party&mdash;black and
white; I cannot fairly say savage and civilised, for in most of our
difficulties by flood and field, the intelligence and skill of our
sable friends made the "white-fellows" appear rather stupid. They
could read traces on the earth, climb trees, or dive into the
water, better than the ablest of us. In tracing lost cattle,
speaking to "the wild natives", hunting, or diving, Piper was the
most accomplished man in the camp. In person he was the tallest,
and in authority he was allowed to consider himself almost next to
me, the better to secure his best exertions. When Mr. Stapylton
first arrived, Piper came to my tent and observed that "That fellow
had two coats", no doubt meaning that I ought to give one of them
to him! The men he despised, and he would only act by my orders.
This day, he rendered us much useful assistance in the water; for
instance, when a cart stuck in the bottom of the river, the rope by
which it was to be drawn through having broken, Piper, by diving,
attached a heavy chain to it, thereby enabling the party to draw it
out with the teams.</p>

<p>At this place the widow, being far beyond her own country, was
inclined to go back; and although I intended to put her on a more
direct and safe way home after we should pass the heads of the
Murrumbidgee on our return, I could not detain her longer than she
wished. Her child, to whom she appeared devotedly attached, was
fast recovering the use of its broken limb; and the mother seemed
uneasy under an apprehension, that I wanted to deprive her of this
child. I certainly had always wished to take back with me to Sydney
an aboriginal child, with the intention of ascertaining, what might
be the effect of education upon one of that race. This little
savage, who at first would prefer a snake or lizard to a piece of
bread, had become so far civilised at length, as to prefer bread;
and it began to cry bitterly on leaving us. The mother, however,
thought nothing of swimming, even at that season, across the broad
waters of the "Millewa", as she should be obliged to do, pushing
the child before her, floating on a piece of bark.</p>

<p><i>July 4.</i>&mdash;At the distance of about a mile to the
southward, a line of trees marked the course of another channel,
which, containing only a few ponds, we crossed without difficulty.
Beyond it, we traversed a plain five miles in extent, and backed by
low, grassy hills, composed of grey gneiss. The most accessible
interval between these hills still appeared to be in the direction
I had chosen at Mount Hope, as leading to the lowest opening of a
range, still more distant: I, therefore, continued on that bearing,
having the highest of those hills to our left, at the distance of
five or six miles. On entering the wood skirting the wide plain,
our curiosity was rather disappointed at finding, instead of rare
things, the black-butted gum and casuarinae, trees common in the
colony. The woolly gum also grew here, a tree much resembling the
box in the bark on its trunk, although that on the branches, unlike
the box, is smooth and shining. In this wood we recognised the
rosella parrot, and various plants, so common near Sydney; but not
before seen by us in the interior.</p>

<p>At ten miles, we travelled over undulating ground, for the first
time, since we left the banks of the Lachlan; and we crossed a
chain of ponds watering a beautiful and extensive valley, covered
with a luxuriant crop of the anthistiria grass. Kangaroos were now
to be seen on all sides, and we finally encamped on a deeper chain
of ponds, probably the chief channel of the waters of that valley.
A ridge of open forest-hills appearing before us, I rode to the top
of one of the highest summits, while the men pitched the tents; and
from it, I perceived a hilly country, through whose intricacies I,
at that time, saw no way, and beyond it, a lofty mountain-range
arose in the south-west. To venture into such a region with wheel
carriages, seemed rather hazardous, when I recollected the coast
ranges of the colony; and I determined to examine it further,
before I decided, whether we should penetrate these fastnesses, or
travel westward round them, thus to ascertain their extent in that
direction, and that of the good land watered by them.</p>

<p><i>July 5.</i>&mdash;I proceeded with several men mounted,
towards the lofty hill to the eastward of our route, the highest of
those I had intersected from Mount Hope and the Pyramid-hill, its
aboriginal name, as I afterwards learnt, being Barrabungale. Nearly
the whole of our way was over granite rocks. We had just reached a
naked mass, near the principal summit, when the clouds, which had
been lowering for some time, began to descend on the plains to the
northward, and soon closing over the whole horizon, compelled me to
return, without having had an opportunity of observing more than
the westward. This was, however, a fact of considerable importance
with respect to our further progress; for I could enter that
mountain-region with less hesitation, as I knew, that I could leave
it, if necessary, and proceed westward by following down any of the
vallies which declined in that direction.</p>

<p><i>July 6.</i>&mdash;The morning being rainy, I could learn
nothing more by ascending Barrabungale as I intended; but I rode
into the country to the southward, in order to examine it in the
direction, in which I thought it most desirable to lead the party.
After passing over several well-watered, grassy flats or vallies,
each bounded by open forest-hills, we crossed at six miles from the
camp, a range, the summit of which was covered by a low scrub, but
it did not much impede our way. Beyond this range, we again found
open forest land, and we saw extensive flats still more open to our
right, in which direction all the waters seemed to fall. At length,
after travelling about twelve miles, we came upon a deep chain of
ponds, winding through a flat thickly covered with anthistiria, and
resembling a field of ripe grain. Smoke arose in all directions
from an extensive camp of natives; but, although I coeyed and saw
them at a distance, they continued to crouch behind trees, and
would not approach. I did not disturb them further, but returned
with the intention of leading the party there the next day, when I
hoped to see more of these natives. An abundance of a beautiful
white or pale yellow-flowered, herbaceous plant, reminding me of
the violets of Europe, to which it was nearly allied, grew on the
sides of hills.</p>

<p>In the evening, the widow returned with her child on her back@
She stated, that after we left our late encampment, a numerous
tribe arrived on the opposite bank of the river, and seeing the
fires on her side, called out very angrily, as Piper translated her
tale, "Murry coola," (very angry); inquiring, who had made those
fires; and that, receiving no reply, (for she was afraid, and had
hid herself,) they danced a corrobory in a furious style, during
which she and the child crept away, and had passed two nights
without fire and in the rain. Piper seemed angry at her return, but
I took particular care, that she should be treated with as much
kindness as before. She was a woman of good sense, and had been
with us long enough to feel secure under our protection, even from
the wrath of Piper, as displayed on this occasion; and I
discovered, that her attempted return home had been suggested by
Piper's gin, who probably anticipated a greater share of food,
after the widow's departure.</p>

<p><i>July 7.</i>&mdash;The party moved to the creek, where I had
before seen the natives; and Piper found at their fires an old
woman and several boys. They said, pointing far to the south-east,
doubtless to Port Phillip, that a station of white-fellows was
there, and that they had been themselves to the sea, which was not
very distant. The old woman spoke with expressive gestures, of a
part of the coast, she called "Cadong", where the waves raged; and
of a river, she named Woollamaee, running into it. It appeared that
the rest of the tribe were at that time in search of opossums; but
she promised, that when they returned in the evening or next day,
some of them should visit our camp.</p>

<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;This morning, Piper prevailed on an old
man, with his gins and some boys, to come to us. The former pointed
towards "Cadong", in the direction of 232&deg; from N. and in reply
to my queries, through Piper, said it was not "Geelong" (Port
Phillip), but a water like it; and that no white men had ever been
there. On mentioning lake Alexandrina, by its native name Keyinga,
he said, that it was a place filled sometimes with rain (i.e.
river-) water, and not like "Cadong" which was salt water. He
described the whole country before us as abounding in good water
and excellent grass; and he said, that in the direction I was
pursuing, there was no impediment between me and the sea-coast.
Piper's countenance brightened up with the good news this man gave
him; assuring me that we should "find water all about; no more want
water." In return for all this intelligence, I presented the old
man with an iron tomahawk, which he placed under him as he sate;
and he continued to address me with great volubility for some time.
I was told by Piper, that he was merely saying "how glad he was",
and enumerating (apparently with a sort of poetic fervour) the
various uses to which he could apply the axe I had given him. I
left these natives with the impression on my mind, that they were
quiet, well-disposed people.</p>

<p>Proceeding a little west of south-west, we intersected this
creek (Tarray) three times, leaving it finally flowing southward,
and to our left, into that of Dyoonboors, which it joined, at a
mile and a half from where we had been encamped. At three miles,
having crossed a low ridge of forest land, we entered a fine
valley, backed on the west by romantic, forest hills, and watered
by some purling brooks, which united in the woods on the east. The
flat itself had a few stately trees upon it, and seemed quite ready
to receive the plough; while some round hillocks, on the north,
were so smooth and grassy, that the men said they looked as if they
had already been depastured by sheep. From an extremity of the
clear ridge, I obtained an extensive view of the mountain chain to
the south-east; and I intersected most of its summits. The whole
seemed smooth (i.e. not rocky), grassy, and thinly timbered.
Crossing the lower or outer extremity of this forest ridge, we
entered another fine valley watered by a creek which we passed at
six miles from the commencement of the day's journey. This little
channel was grassy to the water's edge, and its banks were firm and
about eight feet high; the course being eastward. In the valley I
saw the Banksia for the first time, since we left the Lachlan. A
calamifolia, or needle-leaved wattle, occurred also in considerable
quantity. After crossing two more brooks and some flats of fine
land, with grassy forest-hills on our right, we reached the crest
of a forest-range, which afforded an extensive view over the
country beyond it. The surface seemed to be low for some distance,
but then to rise gradually towards some rocky points, over which
were partially seen the summits of a higher range, still further
southward. The descent to the low country, was easy for our carts;
and we found there, a beautifully green and level flat, bounded on
the south by a little river, flowing westward. The banks of this
stream consisted of rounded acclivities, and were covered with
excellent grass. The bed was 18 or 20 feet below the level of the
adjacent flats, and from its resemblance in some respects to the
little stream in England, I named it the Loddon. We encamped on its
bank in latitude 36&deg; 36' 49" S., longitude 143&deg; 35' 30"
E.</p>

<p><i>July 9.</i>&mdash;By continuing the same line of route, we
crossed several minor rivulets, all flowing through open grassy
vales, bounded by finely undulating hills. At about three miles, we
came to a deep chain of ponds, the banks being steep and covered
with grass. Keeping a tributary to that channel on our left, we
passed some low hills of quartz; and a little beyond them, we
crossed poor hills of the same rock, bearing an open box-forest.
After travelling through a little scrub, we descended on one of the
most beautiful spots I ever saw:&mdash;The turf, the woods, and the
banks of the little stream which murmured through the vale, had so
much the appearance of a well kept park, that I felt loth to injure
its surface by the passage of our cart wheels. Proceeding for a
mile and a half along the rivulet, and through a valley wholly of
the same description, we at length encamped on a flat of rich earth
(nearly quite black), and where the anthistiria grew in greater
luxuriance than I had ever before witnessed in Australian grasses.
The earth indeed seemed to surpass in richness, any that I had seen
in New South Wales; and I was even tempted to bring away a specimen
of it. Our dogs killed three kangaroos, and this good fortune was
most timely, as I had that very morning, thought it advisable to
reduce the allowance of rations.</p>

<p><i>July 10.</i>&mdash;Tracing upwards the rivulet of the vale we
left this morning, we passed over much excellent grassy land
watered by it, the channel containing some very deep ponds,
surrounded by the white barked eucalyptus. A hill on its bank,
consisted of a conglomerate in which the ferruginous matter
predominated over the embedded fragments of quartz. The ground
beyond was hilly, and we at length ascended a ridge, apparently an
extremity of a higher range. On these hills grew the varieties of
eucalypti known in the colony, such as iron-bark, blue-gum, and
stringybark. The lower grounds were so wet and soft, and the
watercourses in them so numerous, that I was desirous to follow a
ridge as long as it would take us in the direction, in which we
were proceeding; and this range answered well for the purpose. Its
crest consisted of ferruginous sandstone much inclined, the strike
extending north-north-west. I found the opposite side much more
precipitous, and that it overlooked a much lower country. In
seeking a favourable line of descent for the carts, I climbed a
still higher forest-hill on the left, which consisted chiefly of
quartz-rock. I not only recognised from that hill, some lofty
points to the eastward, and obtained angles on them, but I also
perceived very rugged summits of a range at a great distance in the
south-west. Having selected among the various hills and dales
before me, that line of route which seemed the best, and having
taken its bearing, I returned to conduct the carts by a pass along
one side of that hill, having found it, in a very practicable state
for wheel carriages. At three miles beyond the pass, we crossed a
deep creek running westward, which I named the Avoca, and we
encamped on an excellent piece of land beyond it. This day, we had
even better fortune in our field sports than on the one before, for
besides three kangaroos, we killed two emus, one of which was a
female and esteemed a great prize, for I had discovered, that the
eggs, found in the ovarium, were a great luxury in the bush; and
afforded us a light and palatable breakfast for several days.</p>

<p><i>July 11.</i>&mdash;At the end of two miles on this day's
journey, we crossed a deep stream running westward. The height of
its banks above the water was twelve feet, and they were covered
with a rich sward. The land along the margins of the stream was as
good as that we were now accustomed to see everywhere around us, so
that it was no longer necessary to note the goodness or beauty of
any place in particular. At four miles, we passed over a foresthill
composed of mica-slate, and after crossing another good valley at
six miles, I saw before us, on gaining a low forest ridge, other
grassy hills of still greater height, connected by a rock, that
cost us less trouble to ascend than I expected. It was in the
vallies now, that we met most difficulty; the earth having become
so soft and wet, that the carts could be got through some places
only by the tedious process of dragging each successively, with the
united strength of several teams.</p>

<p>From a high forest-hill, about a mile east of our route, I first
obtained a complete view of a noble range of mountains, rising in
the south to a stupendous height, and presenting as bold and
picturesque an outline as ever painter imagined. The highest and
most eastern summit was hid in the clouds, although the evening was
serene. It bore W. of S. 26&deg; 54'; and the western extremity,
which consisted of a remarkably round hill, bore 16&deg; 30' S. of
W. Having descended from the range by an easy slope to the
southward, we passed through a beautiful valley, in which we
crossed, at a mile and a quarter from the hills, a fine stream
flowing also westward; and in other respects similar to those we
had already met. I named it Avon water, and we encamped on its left
bank.</p>

<p><i>July 12.</i>&mdash;At two miles and a half from the spot,
where we had slept, we crossed another stream flowing
west-north-west, which I named the Smallburn. Beyond it, the ground
was good and grassy, but at this season very soft, so that the
draught was most laborious for the cattle. At seven miles, we
crossed a wet flat with ponds of water standing on it, and beyond
we entered on a clay soil, altogether different from any hitherto
passed on this side the Yarrayne. About eight miles from our camp,
we reached a fine running brook with grassy banks, its course being
to the northwest. The bed consisted of red-sand and gravel, and the
banks were about fourteen feet high, presenting fine swelling
slopes covered with turf. On this stream, which I named the
Doscasas, I halted, as it was doubtful whether some of the carts
could be brought even so far before night; the ground having proved
soft and rotten to such a degree, especially on the slopes of low
hills, that in some cases the united strength of three teams had
been scarcely sufficient to draw them through. It was night before
the last cart arrived, and two bullocks had been left behind, in an
exhausted state.</p>

<p><i>July 13.</i>&mdash;We had at length discovered a country
ready for the immediate reception of civilised man; and destined
perhaps to become eventually a portion of a great empire.
Unencumbered by too much wood, it yet possessed enough for all
purposes; its soil was exuberant, and its climate temperate; it was
bounded on three sides by the ocean; and it was traversed by mighty
rivers, and watered by streams innumerable. Of this Eden I was the
first European to explore its mountains and streams&mdash;to behold
its scenery-to investigate its geological character&mdash;and, by
my survey, to develope those natural advantages, certain to become,
at no distant date, of vast importance to a new people. The lofty
mountain range, which I had seen on the 11th, was now before us,
but still distant between thirty and forty miles; and as the cattle
required rest, I determined on an excursion to its lofty eastern
summit. Such a height was sure to command a view of the country
between these mountains and the sea, in the direction of Lady Julia
Percy's Isles; and of that region between the range and those less
connected forest-hills, I had seen to the eastward.</p>

<p>When I first discovered these mountains, I perceived that the
land immediately to the eastward of them, was very low, and that if
I found it necessary, I might conduct the party in that direction
to the coast. I was, however, more desirous to level my theodolite
on that summit first, and thus obtain valuable materials for the
construction of an accurate map of the whole country around it. I
accordingly left the party encamped, and proceeded towards the
mountain, accompanied by six men on horseback; having previously
instructed Mr. Stapylton to employ the men, during my absence, in
forming a way down the bank, and a good ford across the stream, in
order that there might be no impediment to the immediate advance of
the party, on my return.</p>

<p>Pursuing the bearing of 193&deg;, we crossed, at three miles
from the camp, a deep creek, similar to that on which it was
placed; and the first adventure of the morning occurred here. The
fordable place was so narrow, that the horse of one of the party
plunged into the deep water with its rider, who, while the animal
was swimming, incautiously pulled the bridle, and of course
overturned it, so that they parted company in the water, the horse
reaching one bank, the rider the other. The latter, who was my
botanical collector, Richardson, took his soaking on a cold frosty
morning so philosophically, talking to his comrades as he made his
way to the bank, partly swimming, partly floating on two huge
portfolios, that I gave his name to the creek, the better to
reconcile him to his wet jacket. We entered soon after, upon one of
the finest tracts of grassy forest land, we had ever seen. The
whole country recently crossed was good, but this was far better,
having several broad and deep ponds, or small lakes in the woods,
and all full of the clearest water. At eight miles, I perceived a
forest-hill on my left (or to the eastward), and the country before
us was so open, sloping and green, that I felt certain, we were
approaching a river; and we soon came upon one, which was full,
flowing, and thirty feet wide, being broader than the Yarrayne, but
not so uniformly deep. Unlike the latter river, reeds grew about
its margin in some places, and its banks, though grassy and fifteen
feet high, were neither so steep as those of the Yarrayne, nor so
closely shut together. We swam our horses across, but our progress
had scarcely commenced again on the other side, when it was impeded
by another similar stream or channel. In this we managed, with
Piper's assistance, to find a ford, but at less than a quarter of a
mile, we met a third channel, more resembling the first in the
height of its banks and velocity of the current, and also from its
flowing amongst bushes. This we likewise forded, and immediately
after we ascended a piece of rising ground, which convinced me,
that we had at length crossed all the branches of that remarkable
river. It is probable we came upon it where it received the waters
of tributaries, and some of these channels might be such.</p>

<p>We next fell in with some undulating ground, different in many
respects from any, that we had traversed during the morning. The
soil was poor and sandy; and the stunted trees and shrubs of the
Blue mountains grew upon it, instead of the novelties we expected
at such a great distance from home. We also recognised the birds,
common about Sydney. On reaching the higher part of this ground (at
nine miles), I again saw the mountain, which then bore 196&deg;.
The intervening ground seemed to consist of a low ridge rather
heavily wooded, its crest presenting a line as level as the ocean.
At eleven miles, I suppose we were upon the dividing ground between
the sea-coast country and that of the interior, and on what
appeared to be the only connection between the forest mountains to
the eastward, and the lofty mass then before us. We found upon this
neck, huge trees of ironbark and stringy-bark; some fine
forest-hills appeared to the eastward, and distant only a few
miles. At the end of sixteen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty-one, and
twenty-three miles, we crossed small rivers, all flowing westward,
and the third over sandstone. After passing the last or fifth
stream, we halted on a very fine, open, dry and grassy flat. We
found a large fallen tree, which we set on fire, and passed the
night, a very mild one, most comfortably, on the ground beside it,
with the intention of renewing our journey at daylight in the
morning.</p>

<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;On leaving our bivouac we crossed some
hills of trap-rock which were lightly wooded, and covered with the
finest grass, in great abundance. The scenery around them, the
excellent quality of the soil, the abundance of water and verdure,
contrasted strangely with the circumstance of their lying waste and
unoccupied. It was evident that the reign of solitude in these
beautiful vales was near a close; a reflection which, in my mind,
often sweetened the toils and inconveniences of travelling through
such houseless regions. At the foot of the last hill, and about a
mile on our way, we crossed a chain of deep ponds running to the
south-west. Beyond them was a plain of the very finest open
forest-land, on which we travelled seven miles; and then came upon
a river with broad deep reaches of very clear water, and flowing
towards the north-west. We easily found a ford, and on proceeding,
entered upon a tract of white sand, where banksia and casuarinae
were the chief trees. There was also some good grass, but it grew
rather thinly upon it. The next water we crossed was a small
mountain-torrent, hurrying along to the eastward in a deep and
rocky channel, overhung with bushes. Being now close under the
mountain, we dismounted, and sent our horses back, for the sake of
food, to the bank of the last mentioned river. The first part of
our ascent, on foot, was extremely steep and laborious, although it
was along the most favourable feature I could find. Above it, the
impediments likely to obstruct our further ascent, were two high
and perpendicular rocky cliffs; but I had observed before
ascending, those crevices and intervals between rocks, where we
might most easily effect an ascent; and through these we
accordingly penetrated without much difficulty. The upper precipice
consisted of cliffs, about 140 feet in perpendicular height.
Fortunately the ablest of the men with me, was a house carpenter,
and, being accustomed to climb roofs, he managed to get up, and
then assist the rest. Having gained the top of this second
precipice, we found winter and desolation under drizzling clouds,
which afforded but partial and transient glimpses of the world
below. The surface at the summit of the cliffs was broad, and
consisted of large blocks of sandstone, separated by wide fissures,
full of dwarf bushes of banksia and casuarinae. These rocks were
inclined but slightly towards the north-west, and the bushes being
also wet and curiously encrusted with heavy icicles, it was by no
means a pleasant part of our journey to travel nearly half a mile
upwards, either on the slippery rock or between fissures among wet
bushes. At length however we reached the highest point, and found
that it consisted of naked sandstone. The top block was encrusted
with icicles; and had become hoary under the beating of innumerable
storms. At the very summit I found a small heath-like, bushy
Leucopogon, from six inches to a foot high. It was in flower,
although covered with ice. Also a variety of <i>Leucopogon
villosus</i>, with rather less hair than usual, and another species
of the same genus, probably new. Near the highest parts of the
plateau, I found a new species of eucalyptus with short broad
viscid leaves, and rough-warted branches. All around us was hidden
in mist. It was now within half an hour of sunset, but the ascent
had cost so much trouble, and the country, this summit commanded,
was so interesting to us, that I was unwilling to descend without
trying, whether it might not be clear of clouds at sunset. We had
not come prepared in any way to pass the night on such a wild and
desolate spot, for we had neither clothing, nor food, nor was there
any shelter; but I was willing to suffer any privations, for the
attainment of the object of our ascent. One man, Richardson, an old
traveller, had most wisely brought his day's provisions in his
haversack, and these I divided equally among five. No rocks could
be found near the summit, to shelter us from the piercing wind and
sleet. The thermometer stood at 29&deg;, and we strove to make a
fire to protect us from the piercing cold; but the green twigs,
encrusted with icicles, could not by our united efforts be blown
into a flame sufficient to warm us. There was abundance of good
wood at the foot of the cliffs&mdash;huge trees of iron-bark,
stringy-bark, and blue gum; but had we descended, a second ascent
might have appeared too laborious, on a mere chance of finding the
summit clear; so we remained above. The men managed to manufacture
some tea in a tin pot, and into the water as it boiled, I plunged a
thermometer, which rose to exactly 95&deg; of the centigrade scale.
We got through that night of misery as well as might have been
expected under the circumstances, and we succeeded in keeping the
fire alive, although while twigs were blown into red heat at one
end, icicles remained at the other, even within a few inches of the
flame. In order to maintain it through the night, we divided, at
eleven o'clock, the stock of branches which had been gathered
before dark, into eight parcels; this being the number of hours we
were destined to sit shivering there; and as each bundle was laid
on the dying embers, we had the pleasure at least of knowing, that
it was an hour nearer daylight. I coiled myself round the fire in
all the usual attitudes of the blacks, but in vain; to get warm was
quite impossible, although I did once feel something like comfort,
when one of the men gave me for a seat, a flat stone on which the
fire had been blown for some hours. Partial cessations in the fall
of sleet were also cheering occasionally; but the appearance of
stars, two hours before daylight, promised to reward our
enterprise, and inspired me with hope.</p>

<p><i>July 15.</i>&mdash;At six o'clock, the sky became clear, the
clouds had indeed left the mountain, and as soon as it was day, I
mounted the frozen rock. In the dawn, however, all lower objects
were blended in one grey shade, like the dead colouring of a
picture. I could distinguish only a pool of water, apparently near
the foot of the mountain. This water. I afterwards found to be a
lake eight miles distant, and in my map I have named it Lake
Lonsdale, in honour of the Commandant then, or soon after,
appointed to Port Phillip. I hastily levelled my theodolite, but
the scene, although sublime enough for the theme of a poet, was not
at all suited to the more common-place objects of a surveyor. The
sun rose amid red and stormy clouds, and vast masses of a white
vapour concealed from view both sea and land, save where a few
isolated hills were dimly visible. Towards the interior, the
horizon was clear, and during a short interval, I took what angles
I could obtain. To the westward, the view of the mountain ranges
was truly grand. Southward, or towards the sea, I could at
intervals perceive plains clear of timber, and that the country was
level, a circumstance of great importance to us; for I was
apprehensive that between these mountains and the coast, it might
be broken by mountain gullies, as it is in the settled colony and
all along the Eastern coast. If such had proved to be the case, the
carts could not have been taken there; and I must have altered the
plan of my intended route. Before I could observe the angles so
desirable, clouds again enveloped the mountain, and I was compelled
to quit its summit without completing the work. The wind blew
keenly, the thermometer stood as low as 27&deg; and in the morning
the rocks were more thickly encrusted with ice. The difficulty of
our descent under such circumstances was, therefore, increased, but
no impediment could have arrested us then, the lower regions having
so many attractive charms for such cold and hungry beings. That
night on the summit materially injured the health of two of my best
men, and who had been with me on all three of my expeditions.
Muirhead was seized with ague, and Woods with a pulmonary
complaint; and although both recovered in a few weeks, they were
never so strong afterwards. We found upon the mountain, besides
those already mentioned, various interesting plants, which we had
seen nowhere else. Amongst them a most beautiful downy-leaved
Epacris, with large, curved, purple flowers, allied to E.
grandiflora, but much handsomer. A most remarkable species of
Phebalium with holly-like leaves and bright red flowers, resembling
those of a Boronia. It was related to P. <i>phylicifolium</i>, but
quite distinct. A new Cryptandra remarkable for its downy leaves. A
beautiful species of Baeckea, with downy leaves, and rose-coloured
flowers, resembling those of the dwarf almond. A new Pultenaea
allied to P. <i>biloba</i>, but more hairy, and with the flowers
half concealed among the leaves. A new species of Bossiaea which
had the appearance of a Rosemary bush, and differed from all the
published kinds in having linear pungent leaves. A beautiful, new,
and very distinct species of Genetyllis, possessing altogether the
habit of a Cape Diosma, the heath-like branches being terminated by
clusters of bright pink and white flowers. Several species of
Grevillea, particularly a remarkable kind, with leaves like those
of an European holly, but downy; another fine new species, with
leaves like those of an European oak; and a third with brownish red
flowers and hoary leaves, varying from an erect straight-branched
bush, to a diffuse entangled shrub; lastly a new Leucopogon,
besides that found on the summit as already mentioned.</p>

<p>In adding this noble range of mountains to my map, I felt some
difficulty in deciding on a name. To give appellations that may
become current in the mouths of future generations, has often been
a perplexing subject with me, whether they have been required to
distinguish new counties, towns, or villages, or such great natural
features of the earth as mountains and rivers. I have always gladly
adopted aboriginal names, and in the absence of these, I have
endeavoured to find some good reason for the application of others,
considering descriptive names the best, such being in general the
character of those used by the natives of this and other countries.
Names of individuals seem eligible enough, when at all connected
with the history of the discovery, or that of the nation by whom it
was made. The capes on the coast, I was then approaching, were
chiefly distinguished with the names of naval heroes; and as such
capes were but subordinate points of the primitive range, I
ventured to connect this summit with the name of the sovereign in
whose reign the extensive, valuable, and interesting region below
was first explored; and, I confess, it was not without some pride,
as a Briton, that I, "more majorum", gave the name of the
Grampians, to these extreme summits of the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>We reached the banks of the little river, where the horses
awaited us, in three hours, the distance being eight miles from the
summit of Mount William. There, we found a large fire, and under a
wide spreading casuarina, during a delightful interval of about
twenty minutes, I enjoyed the pleasures of eating, sleeping,
resting, and warming myself, almost all at the same time. To all
who would know how to enjoy most intensely a good fire, shelter,
sunshine and the dry soft turf, I would recommend, by way of whet,
a winter night on a lofty mountain, without fire, amidst
frost-covered rocks and clouds of sleet. I shall long remember the
pleasure of those moments of repose, which I enjoyed on my arrival
in the warm valley, after such a night. We could afford no longer
delay, however, having brought provisions only for one day with us,
whereas this was the morning of the third of our absence from the
camp. Retracing our steps, we reached the little river only at
eight in the evening, and as I hoped to find a ford in it at
daylight, we lay down on its bank for the night.</p>

<p><i>July 16.</i>&mdash;I slept on a snug bit of turf, within two
feet of the stream; so that the welcome murmur of its rippling
waters, assisted my dreams of undiscovered rivers. As soon as
morning dawned, I succeeded in finding a ford on that branch across
which we swam our horses on the 13th. We thus met with less cause
of delay, and reached the camp at an early hour, with excellent
appetites for breakfast.</p>

<p>Two natives had visited the party during my absence; and had
slept by the fires. They had been at cattle-stations, and could say
"milk". They consequently approached our camp boldly, and during
the night shewed much restlessness, endeavouring to decoy the gins
away with them. But the widow gave the alarm and, very properly
handed over these insidious wooers to the especial surveillance of
the man on duty. Notwithstanding they were vigilantly watched, they
contrived to steal a tomahawk, and went off leaving their wooden
shovels at our camp, saying they should return. I had now several
men on the sick-list, but under the treatment of Drysdale, our
medical attendant, they speedily recovered.</p>

<p><i>July 17.</i>&mdash;The ground on the sides of the low hills
was still so soft, (and in this respect, I had found the country we
had lately crossed, even worse than that previously traversed by
the carts,) that the only prospect which remained to us of being
able to continue the journey, was by proceeding, over the plains,
extending along the interior side of the Grampians of the South.
The soil of such plains consisted chiefly of clay, and we had
recently found, that it bore the wheels of the waggons much better
during the winter season, than the thin and loose soil on the sides
of hills; apparently, because this lay on rock, or a substratum so
tenacious as to support the water in, or just under, the surface.
The wheels, and also the feet of the cattle, sunk at once to this
rocky subsoil whatever its depth, and up came the water, so that on
level parts, our track resembled a ditch of mud and water, and on
slopes it formed a current of water, and a drain from the sides of
the hills. I had observed the plains during my reconnaissance of
the interior from the side of Mount William, and I now directed our
course towards them. We crossed without difficulty the little
river, by the passage Mr. Stapylton had prepared during my absence;
and after travelling about four miles, first west and then
north-west, we came upon an extensive plain. The soil consisted of
good strong clay on which the cattle travelled very well, and it
was covered with the best kind of grass. On reaching it I resumed
my former course, which was nearly west-south-west, towards Mount
Zero, a name I applied to a remarkable cone, at the western
extremity of the chain in of mountains. After travelling 2&frac12; miles
over the plain, we again reached the banks of Richardson's creek,
and forded it after some delay and considerable difficulty, on
account of the softness of the bottom. We next entered on a tract
of grassy, forest land, the trees being chiefly box and casuarinae.
At 21 miles beyond Richardson's creek we crossed a small run of
water, flowing west-north-west, apparently towards it. After
passing over similar ground for some miles further, and having had
another plain on our right, we at length encamped near a large
serpentine pond or lake, which was broad, deep, and bordered with
lofty gum-trees.</p>

<p><i>July 18.</i>&mdash;We continued for five miles along good
firm ground, on which there was an open forest of box and
gum-trees; and part of the bold outline of the Grampians appeared
to our left. At 9 miles we fell in with a flowing stream, the water
being deep and nearly as high as the banks. I did not doubt, that
this was the channel of the waters from the north-side of these
mountains, and, I was convinced, that it contained the water of all
the streams we had crossed on our way to Mount William, with the
exception of Richardson's creek, already crossed by the party,
where it was flowing to the north-west. The richness of the soil,
and the verdure near the river, as well as the natural beauty of
the scenery, could scarcely be surpassed in any country. The banks
were in some places open and grassy, and shaded by lofty yarra
trees, in others mimosa-bushes nodded over the eddying stream.</p>

<p>Continuing along the right bank in a north-west direction, we
travelled two miles on a grassy plain; and we then turned towards
the river, encamping on its banks, in latitude 36&deg; 46' 30" S.,
longitude 142&deg; 39' 25" E. Magnetic variation 50&deg; 21' 45"
E.</p>

<p>Some natives being heard on the opposite bank, Piper advanced
towards them as cautiously as possible; but he could not prevail on
them to come over, although he ascertained, that the name of the
river was the "Wimmera."</p>

<p><i>July 19.</i>&mdash;On examining the Wimmera with Piper's
assistance, I found that it was fordable in some places; but, in
order to effect a passage with greater facility, we took over
several of the loads in one of the boats. Thus, the whole party had
gained, what I considered to be the left bank, by ten A.M. On
proceeding, I perceived some yarra trees before me, which grew, as
we soon discovered, beside a smaller branch, the bottom of which
was soft. We had however the good fortune to pass the carts across
this branch also. At a quarter of a mile further, we came upon
another flowing stream, apparently very deep, and having steep but
grassy banks. The passage of this, occupied the party nearly two
hours, one of the carts having sunk up to the axle in a soft bank
or channel island. While the men were releasing the cart, I rode
forward and found a fourth channel, deep, wide, and full to the
brim. In vain did Tally-ho (trumpeter, master of the horse, etc. to
the party) dash his horse into the stream in search of a bottom;
though at last, one broad, favourable place was found, where the
whole party forded, at a depth of not more than 2&frac12; feet. Beyond
these channels another similar one still obstructed our progress;
but this we also successfully forded, and at length we found rising
ground before us, consisting of an open plain which extended to the
base of the mountains. On its skirt, we pitched our tents, at a
distance of not quite one mile and a half from our last camp; a
short journey certainly, but the passage of the five branches of
the Wimmera was, nevertheless, a good day's work. I had frequently
observed in the Australian rivers, an uniformity of character
throughout the whole course of each, and the peculiarities of this
important stream were equally remarkable, it being obviously the
same, we had crossed in three similar channels, when on our way to
Mount William, twenty miles above this point. The shrubs on the
banks at the two places were also similar.</p>

<p><i>July 20.</i>&mdash;While Mr. Stapylton conducted the party
across the plains in a west-south-west direction, I proceeded
towards Mount Zero, the most western extremity of the mountain
range, and distant from our camp 81 miles. I found this hill
consisted also of highly micacious sandstone; the whole being
inclined towards the north-west. Having planted my theodolite on
the summit, I intersected various higher points to the eastward,
and also a very remote, isolated hill, on the low country, far to
the northward, which I had also seen from Mount William, and from
several stations on our route. Several specimens of shrubs and
flowers, that had not been previously seen by us, were gathered on
the sides of this rocky hill. Among them, was a very singular,
hairy Acacia, covered with a profusion of the most brilliant yellow
flowers. In some respects it resembled A. <i>lanigera</i>, but it
proved upon examination to be undescribed. An isolated mass
appeared to the westward, having near its base a most remarkable
rock resembling a mitre. Beyond this, the distant horizon was not
<i>quite</i> so level as the plains of the interior usually are;
and, as far as I could see northward with a good telescope, I
perceived open forest-land and various fine sheets of water. I
observed with great satisfaction, that the Grampians, terminated to
the westward, on a comparatively low country. This was an important
object of attention to me then, as it comprised all that intervened
between us and the southern coast; in which direction, I perceived
only one or two groups of conical hills. I resolved, however,
before turning southwards, to extend our journey to the isolated
mass already mentioned, which I afterwards named Mount Arapiles.
After descending from Mount Zero, I proceeded towards the track of
the carts, and found that the plains, unlike any hitherto seen,
undulated so much, that in one place, I could perceive only the
tops of trees in the hollows. On these plains, I found small
nodules of highly ferruginous sandstone, apparently similar to that
which occurs near Jervis Bay and in other places, along the eastern
coast. Reaching at length a low green ridge of black soil very
different from that of the plains, I found it formed the eastern
bank of another of those remarkable circular lakes, of which I had
seen so many near the Murray, The bed of this hollow consisted of
rich black earth, and was thirty-two feet below the level of the
adjacent plain. It seemed nearly circular; the diameter being about
three-quarters of a mile. One peculiarity in this lake was a double
bank on the eastern side, consisting first of a concentric break or
slope from the plain, the soil not being clay as usual, but a dry
red sand; and then arose the green bank of black earth, leaving a
concentric fosse or hollow between. A belt of yarra trees grew
around the edge of this singular hollow, which was so dry and firm,
that the carts, in the track of which I was riding, had traversed
it without difficulty. I learnt from Mr. Stapylton, on reaching the
camp, that the party had previously passed near two other lakes,
the largest containing salt water; and in the neighbourhood of
these, he had also remarked a great change of soil; so that what
with the verdure upon it, the undulating surface, and clumps of
casuarinae on light soil, or lofty yarra trees growing in black
soil, that part of the country looked tolerably well.</p>

<p><i>July 21.</i>&mdash;At a quarter of a mile from the camp, we
crossed a running stream, which also contained deep, and apparently
permanent pools. Several pine or callitris trees grew near its
banks, being the first we had seen for some time. I named this
mountain stream the Mackenzie. Beyond it, were grassy, undulating
plains, with clumps of casuarinae, and box trees (eucalypti). At
three miles and a half, we crossed another chain of ponds, and at
four miles, we came to a deep stream, running with considerable
rapidity, over a bed of sandstone rock. It was overhung with
mimosa-bushes; and it was not until after considerable search, that
I could find a convenient place for fording it. This I named the
Norton. Good grassy hills arose beyond, and after crossing them, we
found an undulating country and sandy soil, where there were
shallow lagoons and but little grass. At nine miles, I was aware,
from the sloping of the ground, of the vicinity of a river; and we
soon came once more upon the Wimmera, flowing in one deep channel
nearly as broad as the Murrumbidgee, but in no other respect at all
similar. The banks of this newly discovered river were not
water-worn, but characterised by verdant slopes, the borders being
fringed with bushes of mimosa. The country was indeed fine adjacent
to the Wimmera, and at the point where we came to it, the river was
joined by a running creek from the south, which we crossed, and at
two miles and a quarter further, we encamped on a spot overlooking
a reedy lagoon, from which some long slopes, descended towards the
river, distant from our camp about half a mile. When we thus again
intersected the Wimmera, I was travelling due west, partly with a
view to ascertain its ultimate course. The isolated hill lay before
me, and it was now to be ascertained, whether the course of the
stream was to the south or north of it. The appearance of the
country from Mount Zero certainly afforded no prospect of our
falling in with the river where we did, but at this camp, Burnett
having climbed to the top of a high tree, thought he could trace
the course to the southward of the hill before us, which bore
nearly west. This prospect accorded with my wishes, and I hoped to
trace it to the coast, without deviating too far to the westward of
my intended route.</p>

<p><i>July 22.</i>&mdash;A small stream from the south crossed our
way, when we had proceeded about half a mile. At six miles and a
half, we met with another; and three miles beyond it, I perceived a
change in the appearance of the country. We had been for some time
travelling through forest land, which now opened into grassy and
level plains, variegated with belts and clumps of lofty trees,
giving to the whole the appearance of a park. We had now the hilly
mass of Mount Arapiles on our right, or north of us, but to my
surprise there was no river flowing between us and those heights,
as I had reason to suppose from what had been seen from the tree by
Burnett. Turning towards the north-west, therefore, and at last
northward, we finally encamped on a spot to the westward of the
hill, after a journey of sixteen miles. Much of the ground near
this hill was so soft, that one of the carts could not be brought
in before midnight, although assisted by several teams, sent back
from the camp. We were now encamped on a dark coloured soil from
which arose the same peculiar smell, that I had remarked at
Cudjallagong (Regent's Lake of Oxley). What had become of the
Wimmera, I could scarcely imagine, but anxious to ascertain its
course, I hastened before sunset, to a western extremity of the
hill; but instead of the river, of which I could see no trace, I
beheld the sun setting over numerous lakes; the nearest, two miles
and a half to the northward, being apparently six miles in
circumference. It seemed to be nearly circular, and a group of low
grassy hills formed a concentric curve around the eastern margin,
and from the total absence of any reeds, trees, or smoke of
natives, it was too obvious that the water was salt. From the spot
where I then stood, I counted twelve such lakes, most of them
appearing to have a crescent-shaped mound or bank on the eastern
side. This certainly was a remarkable portion of the earth's
surface, and rather resembled that of the moon as seen through a
telescope. The eastern and principal summit of the hill was at some
distance; and I returned to the camp, in hopes of being able to
discover from that point, in the morning, some indication of the
further course of the Wimmera.</p>

<p><i>July 23.</i>&mdash;Having ascended the highest summit, I
counted from that height, twenty-seven circular lakes, two of the
largest being about seven miles to the north-east, the direction in
which I expected to see the river. Beyond these, however, I
observed an extensive woody valley, whence much smoke arose,
marking, to all appearance, the course of the Wimmera, which must
have taken a turn in that direction, not far below the junction of
the last creek crossed by the party. Beyond that supposed bed of
the Wimmera, the country appeared to be undulated, open, and
grassy; and it was probably covered with lakes similar to those on
this side, for I had observed from Mount Zero, patches of water in
that direction. From this summit, I had a good view of the
Grampians of the South, and discovering that a lofty range extended
from them southward, I named it the Victoria range, having also
recognised and intersected Mount William, distant 531 miles. I
could see no high land to the westward, and the hill on which I
stood seemed to divide the singular lacustrine country, from that
where the character of the surface was fluviatile. Mount Arapiles
is a feature which may always be easily recognised, both by its
isolated position, and by its small companion the Mitre Rock,
situated mid-way between it and the lake to the northward which I
named Mitre Lake after the little hill, its neighbour. Like the
mountains in the east, Mount Arapiles consists of sandstone passing
into quartz, the whole apparently an altered sandstone, the
structure being in one part almost destroyed; in others perfectly
distinct, and containing pebbles of quartz. At the western
extremity, this rock occurs in columns, resembling, at a distance,
those of basalt. On the steep slopes grew pines, casuarinae, and a
variety of shrubs, among which we found a fine new species of
Baeckea, forming a handsome evergreen bush, the ends of whose
graceful branches were closely covered with small white delicate
flowers. This mass occupies about two square miles, its highest
summit being elevated above Mitre Lake 726 feet. I ascended this
hill on the anniversary of the battle of Salamanca, and hence the
name.</p>

<p><i>July 24.</i>&mdash;While Mr. Stapylton rode northward in
search of the Wimmera, I proceeded to examine and survey some of
these remarkable lakes. On the margin of one of them, bearing
55&frac12;&deg; W. of N. from our camp, a green hill of rather singular
shape rose to a considerable height, above the surrounding country.
I found the water in the lake beside it, shallow and quite salt.
The basin was nearly circular, though partially filled with firm
level earth, which was waterworn at the brink, its surface being
about three feet higher than the water. This was surrounded by a
narrow beach of soft white mud or clay, in which we found no
change, on digging to the depth of several feet. The green hill was
the highest of several semicircular ridges. There was a remarkable
analogy in the form and position of all these hills; the form being
usually that of a curve, concentric with the lake, and the position
invariably on the eastern or north eastern shores, a peculiarity I
had previously observed, not only in the lakes near the banks of
the Murray, but also in others on the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan,
where the ridge consisted of red sand. The country on the western
shore of these lakes is, on the contrary, low and wooded like the
surrounding country. In such hills concretions of indurated marl
frequently occur, but the earth they consist of is sometimes light
coloured, in other cases very dark, like the soil from trap-rock,
and the ridges beside the lakes on the Murrumbidgee, consisted of
red sand. The water of Mitre lake was also salt, but there were
numbers of ducks and black swans upon it. The western shore was
low, and the soil where it had been thrown up, in the roots of
fallen trees, was nearly as white as chalk. A gray rather fine
quartzose sand occurred in some places; and along the water's edge
a very minute shell had been cast up in considerable quantities by
the waves. The hills to the eastward of this lake were arranged in
a crescent around the basin, but this being composed of a number of
hills almost separate from each other, had a less regular or
uncommon appearance, although they were, apparently, the remains of
a curve equally as symmetrical as the others. The basin of this
lake was very extensive, but partly filled, on the side next the
low hills, by a level tract of dry land, covered with a brown bush
(Salicornia arbuscula of Brown). and the concentric curves in which
it grew, as if closing on the lake, seemed to record its
progressive diminution. The breadth of this healthy-looking flat,
between the water and the crescent of low hills, was nearly half a
mile. A small rill of fresh water oozed into the lake from the
sides of Mount Arapiles. The bed of this watercourse was soft and
boggy near the lake, so that I could cross only by going up its
channel much nearer to the bill, and at a point where some rocks
protruded and prevented our horses from sinking.</p>

<p>Mr. Stapylton, in his search for the Wimmera, rode about six
miles to the northward without reaching the river, although he saw
the valley, through which he thought it flowed; and where the river
seemed likely to resume a course to the southward of west. Upon the
whole, I think that the estuary of the Wimmera will most probably
be found either between Cape Bernouilli and Cape Jaffa, or at some
of the sandy inlets laid down by Captain Flinders to the northward
of the first of these capes. The country which Mr. Stapylton
crossed, assumed the barren character of the lower parts of the
Murray. He actually passed through a low scrub of the eucalyptus
dumosa; but I have no doubt that the country on the immediate banks
of the Wimmera continues good, whatever its course may be, even to
the sea-coast. At all events, I here abandoned the pursuit of that
river, and determined to turn towards the south-west, that we might
ascertain what streams fell in that direction, from the Grampians;
and also the nature of the country between these mountains and the
shores of the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;Proceeding accordingly about south-west,
we crossed at less than a mile from our camp, the dry bed of a
circular lake. The ground on the eastern shore was full of wombat
holes, which had been made in a stratum of compact tuff, about a
foot in thickness. The tuff was irregularly cavernous; and it was
loose, calcareous or friable in the lower part, where the wombats
had made their burrows. On the opposite margin of this dry lake,
the surface was covered with concretions of indurated marl; and the
burrows of the wombat were even more numerous there than in the
other bank; the stratum of compact tuff occurring also, and being
three feet in thickness. At 2&frac12; miles, we came upon the shores of
Red lake, which I so named from the colour of a weed growing upon
its margin. The lake was nearly a mile in length and half a mile
broad; the water was so slightly brackish, that reeds grew upon the
borders, which were frequented by many swans and ducks. A very
symmetrical bank overlooked the eastern shore, the ground on the
westward being low and wooded, with the ordinary trees of the
country. We next crossed a flat of dry white sand, on which banksia
grew thickly; and then we reached some low white sand-hills, on
which were stunted ironbark trees (eucalypti). In the higher part
of those hills, we crossed a small dry hollow or lake which had
also its bank on the eastern side. At the end of 5&frac12; miles, we
passed two small lakes of fresh water, about half a mile to the
right, and soon after, another about the same distance to the left.
On completing seven miles, we crossed a low ridge of white sand, on
which grew stunted trees of stringybark, and black butted gum-trees
(both belonging to the genus eucalyptus). Beyond this we crossed a
country, in which wet, reedy swamps of fresh water, white
sand-hills, and fine flats of good forest-land, occurred
alternately. Towards the end of our day's journey, the barren
sand-hills seemed to prevail, but at length we descended from them
rather suddenly to a smooth firm plain, clothed with the finest
grass, and, on the edge of this, we pitched our tents for the
night.</p>

<p><i>July 26.</i>&mdash;We proceeded through a thick fog, and
found the plain studded with clumps of casuarinae. About a mile
from the camp, we came upon an extensive swamp or lake, full of
grass and rushes. Turning this, by the left, we crossed some more
good country, and then reached the banks of an extensive lagoon,
also full of green rushes and water. The western bank was high, and
consisted of rich grassy land, very open; a small stream of water
fell into the lake on the north-west side, and another on the
south-east. It was surrounded by lofty gum-trees, and had a wood on
the south and cast. We met with sand-hills and stunted timber
beyond. They enclosed a long grassy flat covered with water,
stretching away to the south-east. We next entered on a fine flat
of forest-land, bounded by a low ridge, with <i>callitris
pyramidalis</i>, or pine trees. From this, I perceived a circular
lake a little to our right, and on riding to it, I found the water
salt and of a very white colour. No trees grew on the margin, and
the surrounding scene was so dreary, that it resembled a
mountain-tarn. Two solitary ducks were upon it, apparently of a
species new to us, but this I could not ascertain, having had only
my rifle with me, and the cap missing fire, I lost even that chance
of killing them. The bed of the lake also consisted of a very white
marl. A high semi-circular bank swept round the eastern shore; that
opposite, or towards the west, being low and swampy. On that side,
I saw two natives at a distance, making the best of their way to
the southward. We had this day noticed some of their huts which
were of a very different construction from those of the aborigines,
in general, being large, circular, and made of straight rods
meeting at an uptight pole in the centre; the outside had been
first covered with bark and grass, and then entirely coated over
with clay. The fire appeared to have been made nearly in the
centre; and a hole at the top had been left as a chimney. The place
seemed to have been in use for years, as a casual habitation. In
this hut, the natives had left various articles, such as jagged
spears, some of them set with flints; and an article of their
manufacture which we had not before seen, namely, bags of the gins,
very neatly wrought, apparently made of a tough small rush. Two of
these also resembled reticules, and contained balls of resin,
flints for the spearheads, etc. The iron bolt of a boat was
likewise found in one of these huts. The natives invariably fled at
our approach; a circumstance to be regretted, perhaps, on account
of the nomenclature of my map; but otherwise their flight was
preferable to the noisy familiarity of the natives of the Darling,
perplexing us between their brands of defiance, and treacherous
invitations to dance. Indeed the two regions were as different in
character as the manners of their respective inhabitants. Instead
of salsolaceous deserts and mesembryanthemum, we now found a
variety of every thing most interesting in a newly discovered
country. Every day we passed over land, which, for natural
fertility and beauty, could scarcely be surpassed; over streams of
unfailing abundance and plains covered with the richest pasturage.
Stately trees and majestic mountains adorned the ever-varying
scenery of this region, the most southern of all Australia, and the
best. Beyond the White Lake, which may be the distinguishing name
of the last-mentioned, we passed over several tracts of open
forest-land, separated by dry sand-hills, and at length encamped on
a rich flat. The cattle were very much fatigued from the heaviness
of the draught, owing to the extreme softness of the surface,
especially on the more open forest-lands; and one bullock-driver
remained behind with a cart, until we could send back a team by
moonlight to his assistance.</p>

<p><i>July 27.</i>&mdash;The cart which had fallen behind came in
about three o'clock in the morning. The natives had soon been heard
about the solitary driver, and four of them came up to him and
demanded tomahawks; but, being an old bushranger, he, on their
approach, laid out all his cartridges one by one before him on a
tarpaulin, with his pistol and carabine, ready for action; but,
fortunately, his visitors did not proceed to extremities. The
morning was very foggy, and as this weather did not admit of my
choosing a good line of route, and as the surface of the country
was so soft, that it was imperatively necessary to look well before
us, I halted. I could thus at least bring up my maps and journals,
and rest the jaded cattle after so much long-continued daily toil
in travelling through the mud. I directed Mr. Stapylton to ride in
the direction of 30&deg; W. of S. (my intended route), and
ascertain whether we were approaching any river. The country we
were in, being still lacustrine, I hoped to find the surface more
favourable for travelling upon, where it was drained by rivers; for
on that amongst the salt lakes, although the land was very good in
point of fertility, there was evidently a deficiency of slope, and
consequently much more water retained in the soil. Still the ground
presented undulations, being rarely quite level like the plains,
except indeed in the beds of swamps. Recent experience had taught
us to avoid the very level parts, and to seek any kind of rising
ground. The hills we occasionally fell in with consisted of white
sand, and at first looked like connected ridges, where we might
find streams; but we ascertained that they always parted without
enclosing any channels, and left us in the mud. The sand itself
still consisted of the same rock (decomposed), which appeared to be
so generally spread over the country then between us and the
eastern shores of New Holland. Mr. Stapylton did not return this
evening, a circumstance which very much alarmed me, as he had taken
only one man with him, and was to have come back before sunset.</p>

<p><i>July 28.</i>&mdash;Supposing that Mr. Stapylton had gone past
our camp, in returning, the afternoon having been very rainy, I
this morning sent out two parties, the one to proceed east, the
other west, in search of his track, which, if found by either, was
to be followed until he was overtaken. Mr. Stapylton returned,
however, before mid-day, having ridden twenty miles in the
direction pointed out, without having seen any river. He had passed
a number of circular lakes, similar to those already described; the
seventh and most remote having appeared the largest. Just then, as
he turned his horse, he perceived that the land beyond became
higher, indicating a change of country. The party, which had gone
eastward, heard our signal shot on Mr. Stapylton's arrival, and
returned, having also seen four similar lakes; but the party sent
westward did not reach the camp until some hours after the other.
They had unfortunately come upon some huts of the natives, where
one of them remained, and who, refusing to listen to Piper's
explanations, was about to hurl his spear at Pickering, when this
man, at Piper's desire, immediately fired his carabine and wounded
the native in the arm. I regretted this unlucky collision
exceedingly, and blamed Pickering for having been so precipitate;
but his defence was, that Piper told him unless he fired, he would
be instantly speared.</p>

<p><i>July 29.</i>&mdash;We endeavoured to proceed to-day in a
direction more to the eastward, than the route of Mr. Stapylton, in
the hope of finding firmer ground than he had seen, by following
that which was highest and sandy. But even in this way we could not
accomplish five miles and a half, although the last of the carts
did not arrive at the spot, where we were at length compelled to
re-encamp, until long after it became dark. The wheels sank up to
the axles, and the cattle, from wallowing in the mud, had become so
weak as to be scarcely able to go forward when unyoked, much less
to draw the laden carts. I had with difficulty found a spot of firm
ground where we could encamp, but during that evening, I had
reconnoitred a more favourable looking line, which I meant to try
in the morning.</p>

<p>Soon after we commenced this day's journey, while I was watching
in some anxiety the passage of a soft hollow by the carts, a man
was sent back by the chaining party to inform me, that a number of
natives had come before them, pointing their spears. On going
forward, I found they had retired, having probably, with their
usual quickness of perception, observed the messenger sent back,
and guessed his errand. But their conduct, as I then explained it
to the men, was quite reasonable on this occasion. One (I was
told), had spoke very loud and fast, pointing west towards where
the man had been fired at the day before, and then touching his
shoulder, in allusion to the wound, he finally poised his spear at
Blanchard, as if in just resentment.</p>

<p>While awaiting the slow progress of the carts through the mud, I
found a most curious new genus allied to Correa, with the habit of
C. speciosa, and with long tubular four-petaled, green flowers. It
had been previously observed by Mr. Cunningham, who called it Sida
correoides; it was, however, not a Sida, nor even a Malvaceous
plant, but a new form of Australasian Rutaccar, differing from
Correa in having the petals each rolled round a pair of stamens, in
his quadripartite conical calyx, and in there being constantly two
seeds in each cell of the fruit.</p>

<p><i>July 30.</i>&mdash;By pursuing a course towards the base of
the friendly mountains, I hoped that we should at length intercept
some stream, channel or valley, where we might find a drier soil,
and so escape, if possible, from the region of lakes. We could but
follow such a course, however, only as far as the ground permitted,
and after travelling over the hardest that we could this day find
for a mile and a half, I discovered a spacious lake on the left,
bounded on the east by some fine-looking green hills. These
separated it from a plain where I found the ground firm, and also
from several smaller lakes to the right of my intended route. I
accordingly proceeded along the ground between them, and I found
that it bore the wheels much better than any, we had recently
crossed. The lakes were, however, still precisely similar in
character to those of which we had already seen so many. The water
in them was rather too brackish to be fit for use, and the ridges
were all still on the eastern shores. From the highest of these
ridges, the pinnacled summits of the Victoria range presented an
outline of the grandest character. The noble coronet of rocks was
indeed a cheering object to us, after having been so long half
immersed in mud. We had passed between the lakes, and were
proceeding as lightly as we could across the plain, when down went
the wheel of a cart, sinking to the axle, and the usual noise of
flogging (cruelty which I had repeatedly forbidden), and a
consequent delay of several hours, followed. In the meantime, I
rode to some grassy hills on the right, and found behind them on
the south-west, another extensive lake, on which I saw a great
number of ducks. Its bed consisted of dark-coloured mud, and the
water was also salt. The green hills before mentioned, were
curiously broken and scooped out into small cavities, much
resembling those on Green-hill Lake, near Mount Arapiles. The plain
rose gradually towards the cast, to some scrubby ground nearly as
high as these hills, and in a fall beyond this scrub, I found at
length, to my great delight, a small hollow sloping to the
southeast, and a little water running in it. Following it down, I
almost immediately perceived a ravine before me, and at a mile and
a quarter from the first fall of the ground, I crossed a chain of
fine ponds, in a valley where we finally encamped on a fine stream,
flowing to the south-west over granite rocks. Thus suddenly were we
at length relieved, from all the difficulties of travelling in mud.
We had solid granite beneath us; and instead of a level horizon,
the finely rounded points of ground, presented by the sides of a
valley thinly wooded and thickly covered with grass. This
transition from all that we sought to avoid, to all we could desire
in the character of the country, was so agreeable, that I can
record that evening as one of the happiest of my life. Here too the
doctor reported, that no men remained on the sicklist, and thus we
were in all respects prepared for going forward, and making up for
so much time lost.</p>

<p><i>July 31.</i>&mdash;We now moved merrily over bill and dale,
but were soon, however, brought to a full stop by a fine river
flowing, at the point where we met it, nearly south-west. The banks
of this stream were thickly overhung with bushes of the mimosa,
which were festooned in a very picturesque manner with the wild
vine. The river was everywhere deep and full, and as no ford could
be found we prepared to cross it with the boats. But such a passage
required at least a day, and when I saw the boats afloat, I was
tempted to consider, whether I might not explore the further course
of this river in them, and give the cattle some rest. It was
likely, I imagined, soon to join another, where we might meet with
less obstruction. During the day every thing was got across save
the empty carts and the boat-carriage, our camp being thus
established on the left bank. One bullock was unfortunately drowned
in attempting to swim across, having got entangled in the branches
of a sunken tree; which, notwithstanding a careful search,
previously made in the bottom of the stream, had not been
discovered.</p>

<p>The river was here, on an average, 120 feet wide, and 12 feet
deep. Granite protruded in some places, but in general the bold
features of the valley through which this stream flowed, were
beautifully smooth and swelling; they were not much wooded, but on
the contrary almost clear of timber, and accessible everywhere. The
features were bold and round, but only so inclined, that it was
just possible to ride in any direction without obstruction; a
quality of which those who have been shut up among the rocky
gullies of New South Wales, must know well the value. I named this
river the Glenelg, after the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, according to the usual custom.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 1.</i>&mdash;The first part of this day was taken up in
dragging the carts and boat-carriage through the river. At one P.M.
I embarked in the boats, taking in them a fortnight's provisions,
and leaving Mr. Stapylton in a strong position, with nine men, the
stores and the cattle. We proceeded for two miles without
encountering much obstruction, but we found on going further, that
the river ran in several channels, all of these being overgrown
with bushes, so that it was not without great difficulty, that we
could penetrate about a mile farther by the time it had become
nearly quite dark. It was no easy matter, to push through the
opposing branches even to reach the bank. Many similar branches had
been cut during this day's navigation; Woods, Palmer, and most of
the other men, having been more in the water than in the boats
during the last mile. Every article having been at length got to
land, we encamped on the side of a steep hill for the night, and I
made up my mind to resume our land journey next day, unless I saw
the river more favourable a-head. By the banks of the Glenelg, we
found a stiff furze-like bush, with small purple flowers, spiny
branches, and short stiff spiny leaves. It proved to be a new
Daviesia allied to D. colletioides. Bossiaea cordifolia, a hairy
shrub, with beautiful purple and yellow flowers, was common.</p>

<p><i>Aug 2.</i>&mdash;There was a noble reach, a quarter of a mile
below the point to which we had brought the boats, and it was
terminated by a rocky fall, which we had heard during the night.
Beyond that point, the river turned southward, and this being the
direction of our intended journey, I perceived that we could more
conveniently and in less time pursue its course by land. The
country on its banks was, as far as I could see, the finest
imaginable, either for sheep and cattle or for cultivation. A
little rill then murmured through each ravine,</p>

<blockquote>Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,<br>
Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst.</blockquote>

<p>But it was in returning along a winding ridge towards the camp,
that I was most struck with the beauty and substantial value of the
country on the banks of this river. It seemed, that the land was
everywhere alike good, alike beautiful; all parts were verdant,
whether on the finely varied hills or in the equally romantic
vales, which seemed to open in endless succession on both banks of
the river. No time was lost this morning in raising the boats out
of the water; and having proceeded myself to the camp at an early
hour, and led the carts round, and the carriage to take up the
boats, the whole party was once more in movement by eleven o'clock.
As far as I had yet traced the course of the river, it appeared to
flow towards the west-south-west, and it was thus doubtful, at that
stage of our progress, whether the estuary might not be to the
westward of Cape Northumberland; whereas my chief inducement in
looking for a river on this side of the Grampians, was the
promising situation afforded by the great bay to the eastward of
that cape, for some harbour or estuary, and this being more likely,
considering the position of the mountains. I had little doubt that
under such circumstances, some river would be found to enter the
sea there; and having left the Wimmera flowing westward, and
crossed as I imagined the highest ground, that could extend from
the mountain range to Cape Bernouilli, I expected to meet at length
with rivers falling southward. The ultimate course of the Glenelg,
could only be ascertained by following it down, and to do this by
land was not easy; first, because it was joined by many small
tributaries flowing through deep valleys, and from all points of
the compass; and secondly, because the general horizon was so
level, that no point commanding any extensive view over the country
could be found. Thus, while our main object was to pursue the
river, we were obliged to grope our way round the heads of ravines
often very remote from it, but which were very perplexing from
their similarity to the ravine in which the main stream flowed. A
more bountiful distribution of the waters, for the supply of a
numerous population, could not be imagined, nor a soil better
adapted for cultivation. We this day crossed various small rivulets
or chains of ponds, each watering a grassy vale, sheltered by fine
swelling hills. The whole country consisted of open forest land, on
which grew a few gum-trees (or eucalypti), with banksia, and,
occasionally, a few casuarinae.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 3.</i>&mdash;The ponds where we had encamped, were large
and deep, and I endeavoured to ascertain whether the cod-perch
(Gristes Peelii) inhabited these waters. Neither this fine fish,
nor either of the two others found in the streams flowing towards
the interior from the eastern coast range, have ever been seen in
the rivers which reach the eastern shores; and I had now
ascertained, that all the waters in which we had procured the fish
in question belonged to the extensive basin of the Murray. We were
at length on channels evidently distinct, both from those leading
to the eastern coast, and those belonging to the basin of the
Murray. The beds of the rivers flowing to the east coast are
chiefly rocky, containing much sand but very little mud,
consequently no reeds grow on their banks, nor is the freshwater
muscle found in them, as in rivers on the interior side. which in
general flow over a muddy bed, and are not unfrequently
distinguished by reedy banks. judging therefore from the nature of
the soil of this southern region, the fishes peculiar to the Murray
might be looked for in the rivers of the south, rather than those
fishes known in the rivers falling eastward. It was important to
ascertain at least, what point of the coast separated the rivers
containing different kinds of fish. In these ponds we caught only
some very small fry, and the question could not be satisfactorily
determined, although the natives declared that none of them were
the spawn of cod-perch.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter now to ascertain in what direction the
waters of the valley ran, but by the tendency of the hollows on
each side, they appeared to decline, in general, to the left or
northward. In proceeding on our route, the heads of other similar
ravines rendered our course very intricate: to have been shut in
between any such ravine and the river must have been rather
embarrassing, and seemed then almost inevitable. We had the good
fortune however to avoid this; and at length, keeping along dry
ground, a beautiful scene appeared on the left, in an open valley
about two miles in width, where the hills sloped gradually to the
confluence of two streams, brimful of water, which shone through
some highly ornamental wood. Both streams came from vallies of a
similar character, and beyond them I saw hills of the finest forms,
all clothed with grass to their summits, and many entirely clear of
timber. A bronze-winged pigeon flew up just as I discovered the
stream, and as this bird had not been before seen by us on that
side of the mountains, I named the waters "Pigeon" ponds. We
descended to that part of the valley which lay in our proposed
course, and found that some of these ponds rather deserved to be
styled lakes. The soil was everywhere black and rich.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 4.</i>&mdash;Proceeding over ground of a similar
character, we crossed several fine streams, some flowing in shallow
channels over rocks, others in deep ravines. The ground on the
higher parts was, however, still so soft as to yield to the wheels,
and very much impeded the progress of the party, especially at one
place, where an extensive lake, full of reeds or rushes, appeared
to the right. The drays sunk to the axles, the whole of the soil in
our way having become so liquid, that it rolled in waves around the
struggling bullocks. The passage of some of the streams could not
be accomplished, until we had filled up the bed with large logs,
covered them with boughs, and strewed over the whole, the earth cut
away from the steep banks. Under such circumstances, I considered
six miles a good day's journey, and, indeed, too much for the
cattle. I halted for the night, with a small advanced party only,
on a fine little stream running over a rocky bed; while the main
body was compelled to remain with the carts several miles behind,
having broken, in the efforts made to extricate the carts and
boat-carriage, many of the chains, and also a shaft. The small
river I had reached, ran in a bed of little width, but was withal
so deep, that it seemed scarcely passable without a bridge. At the
junction, however, of a similar one, some rocks, favourably
situated, enabled us to effect a passage by bedding logs between
them, and covering the whole with branches and earth, leaving room
for the water to pass between.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 5.</i>&mdash;A halt was this day unavoidable, but the
necessity was the less to be regretted, as the weather was very
unfavourable. Indeed, we had scarcely seen one fine day for some
weeks. Mr. Stapylton set out to trace the rivulet downwards, and
returned in the evening, after having reached its junction with the
Glenelg, at the distance of nine miles in a north-west direction.
The course of the river, thus determined to that junction, appeared
to be more to the westward than I had previously expected, and I
begun again to think its estuary might still be to the westward of
Cape Northumberland, and this prospect induced me to alter our
course. The carts having come up about one P.M., the blacksmith was
set to work, and wrought throughout the night to repair all the
claw-chains. While other men were employed at the log-bridge, some
natives were heard coming along the most southern of the two
streams; whereupon Piper went towards them as usual, and found they
were females, with children; but from the moment they discovered
us, until they were fairly out of hearing, their shrieks were so
loud and incessant, that it seemed, for once, our presence in that
country had been unknown to the surrounding natives, a proof
perhaps of the smallness of their numbers. In the evening, other
natives (men), were heard approaching along the creek, and we at
first supposed they had come to that place, as their rendezvous, to
meet the gins and their families, whom we had unwillingly scared;
but Mr. Stapylton, during his ride home along one side of the
ravine, had observed four natives very intent on following the
outward track of his horses' hoofs on the other; and these were
doubtless the same men guided by his tracks to our camp. They could
not be brought to a parley, however, although Piper and Burnett at
first invited them towards the camp, and when they set off, pursued
them across the opposite ridge. On the bank of this little stream,
I found a charming species of Tetratheca, with large rich purple
flowers, and slender stems growing in close tufts about a foot
high. It was perhaps the most beautiful plant we met with during
the expedition.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 6.</i>&mdash;The passage of the rivulet, which I named
the Chetwynd, after Stapylton, who had explored it at considerable
risk, was effected with ease by the temporary bridge, and we
proceeded, soon crossing by similar means two other running
streams, probably tributaries to this. When we had travelled four
miles we came to a swamp, where a considerable current of water was
flowing into it through some ponds; the margin of this running
water being broad, flat, and grassy, and having also lofty
gum-trees (white bark eucalypti) growing on it. Unfortunately, it
was so soft and rotten, as the men described it, that all the
wheels sunk to the axles, and although in such cases it was usual
to apply the combined force of several teams to draw each vehicle
through in turn, we found that the cattle could have no firm
footing to enable them to pull. It was night before we could, with
the strength of all the teams united by long chains and yoked to
each vehicle successively, bring the whole through, the broad
wheels of each cart actually ploughing to the depth of the axle in
soft earth; the labour of the cattle may therefore be imagined. We
encamped on a small barren plain much resembling a heath, and just
beyond the swamp which had proved so formidable an impediment.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 7.</i>&mdash;Our progress this day was still less than
that made during the preceding one, for it did not much exceed a
mile. To that distance we had proceeded tolerably well, having
crossed two small running brooks, and all appeared favourable
before us. But a broad piece of rising ground, which being sandy
with banksia and casuarinae trees on it. I had considered firm,
proved so very soft, that even my own horse went down with me and
wallowed in the mud. There was no way of avoiding this spot, at
least without delay, and I ordered the men immediately to encamp;
being determined to go forward with a party on horse back, and
ascertain the position of some point where the ground was more
favourable, and then to adopt such a mode of extricating the carts
and proceeding thither, as circumstances permitted. I took with me
provisions for three days, that I might explore the country, if
necessary, to the coast. I had not proceeded above five miles
southward, when I perceived before me a ridge in bluey distance,
rather an unusual object in that close country. We soon after
emerged from the wood, and found that we were on a kind of
table-land, and approaching a deep ravine coming from our right,
and terminating on a very fine looking open country below, watered
by a winding river. We descended by a bold feature to the bottom of
the ravine, and found there a foaming little river hurrying
downwards over rocks. After fording this stream, we ascended a very
steep but grassy mountain-side, and on reaching a brow of high
land, what a noble prospect appeared! a river winding amongst
meadows, that were fully a mile broad, and green as an emerald.
Above them rose swelling hills of fantastic shapes, but all smooth
and thickly covered with rich verdure. Behind these were higher
hills, all having grass on their sides and trees on their summits,
and extending east and west, throughout the landscape, as far as I
could see. I hastened to ascertain the course of the river, by
riding about two miles along an entirely open grassy ridge, and
then found again the Glenelg, flowing eastward, towards an
apparently much lower country. All our difficulties seemed thus
already at an end, for we had here good firm ground clear of
timber, on which we could gallop once more. The river was making
for the most promising bay on the coast (for I saw that it turned
southward some miles below the hill on which I stood,) through a
country far surpassing in beauty and richness any part hitherto
discovered. I hastened back to my men in the mud, and arrived
before sunset with the good news, having found most of the
intervening country fit for travelling upon. Thus the muddy hill
which had before seemed insurmountable, led to the immediate
discovery of the true course of the river, and prevented me from
continuing my route into the great angle of its course over
unfavourable ground, instead of thus reaching it so much sooner by
a much less deviation from the course I wished to pursue. I now
hoped to extricate the carts in the morning, and henceforward to
accomplish journeys of considerable length.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 8.</i>&mdash;It was in vain that I reconnoitered the
environs of the hill of mud for some portion of surface harder than
the rest; and we could only extricate ourselves by floundering
through it. Patches of clay occurred, but they led only to places,
where the surface under the pressure of the cattle was immediately
converted into white and liquid mud. It was necessary to take the
loads from the carts, and carry them by hand half a mile; and then
to remove the empty vehicles by the same means. After all this had
been accomplished, the boat-carriage, (a four-wheeled waggon,)
still remained immoveably fixed up to the axle-tree in mud, in a
situation where the block and tackle used in hoisting out the boats
could not be applied. Much time was lost in our attempts to draw it
through, by joining all the chains we possessed, and applying the
united strength of all the bullocks; but even this was at length
accomplished after the sun had set; the wheels, four inches broad,
actually cutting through to the full depth of the spokes. On the
eastern side of the hill the ground descended into a ravine, where
it was grassy and firm enough; and it was a great relief to us all
to feel thus at liberty, even by sunset, to start next morning
towards the beautiful country, which we now knew lay before us.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 9.</i>&mdash;Once more in a state of forward movement,
we crossed green hills and running brooks, until, when we had
travelled nearly six miles from Muddy Camp, and had crossed six
fine streams or burns, we met with a more formidable impediment in
the seventh. The sides of this ravine were so uncommonly steep,
that our new difficulty was how to move the vehicles down to the
bank of the stream. In one place, where a narrow point of ground
projected across, a passage seemed just possible; and after we had
made it better with spades, we attempted to take a light cart over.
The acclivity was still, however, rather too much, and over went
the cart, carrying the shaft bullock with it, and depositing all my
instruments, etc. under it in the bed of the stream. With
travellers on roads, this might have been thought a serious
accident, but in our case, we were prepared for joltings, and
nothing was in the least degree injured; neither was the animal
hurt, and we ascertained by the experiment, dangerous though it
was, that still more was necessary to be done for the passage of
the heavy carts and boats, which were still some way behind; and I
encamped on the bank beyond, that the men might set about this
work. No time was lost in filling up the hollow with all the dead
trees that lay about, and what others we could cut for the purpose;
and thus, before sunset, the three carts and one waggon were got
across. The rocks in the bed of this stream, consisted of grey
gneiss, and on the hills beyond it, I found nodules of highly
ferruginous sandstone.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 10.</i>&mdash;By means of a block and tackle attached to
a large tree, the remaining carts and the boat-carriage were safely
lowered to the bed of the stream. To draw them up the opposite bank
was practicable only by uniting the strength of several teams, yet
this too was effected successfully, and the whole party were
enabled to go forward in the morning. At a mile and a half from the
camp, a scene was displayed to our view, which gladdened every
heart. An open grassy country, extending as far as we could
see&mdash;hills round and smooth as a carpet&mdash;meadows broad,
and either green as an emerald, or of a rich golden colour, from
the abundance, as we soon afterwards found, of a little
ranunculus-like flower. Down into that delightful vale, our
vehicles trundled over a gentle slope, the earth being covered with
a thick matted turf, apparently superior to anything of the kind,
previously seen. That extensive valley was enlivened by a winding
stream, the waters of which glittered through trees fringing each
bank. As we went on our way rejoicing, I perceived at length two
figures at a distance, who at first either did not see, or did not
mind us. They proved to be a gin with a little boy, and as soon as
the female saw us, she began to run. I presently overtook her, and
with a few words I knew, prevailed on her to stop, until the two
gins of our party could come up; p; for I had long been at a loss
for the names of localities. This woman was not so much alarmed as
might have been expected; and I was glad to find that she and the
gins perfectly understood each other. The difference in the costume
on the banks of the Wando, immediately attracted the notice of the
females from the Lachlan. The bag usually carried by gins, was
neatly wove in basket-work, and composed of a wiry kind of rush.
She of Wando carried this bag fastened to her back, having under it
two circular mats of the same material, and beneath all, a kangaroo
cloak, so that her back at least was sufficiently clothed, although
she wore no dress in front. The boy was supported between the mats
and the cloak; and his pleased and youthful face, he being a very
fine specimen of the native race, presented a striking contrast to
the miserable looks of his whining mother. In the large bag, she
carried some pieces of fire-wood, and a few roots, apparently of
Tao, which she had just been digging from the earth. Such was the
only visible inhabitant of this splendid valley, resembling a
nobleman's park on a gigantic scale. She stated that the main river
was called "Temiangandgeen", a name unfortunately too long to be
introduced into maps. We also obtained the gratifying intelligence,
that the whole country to the eastward was similar to these
delightful vales; and that, in the same direction, as Piper
translated her statement, "there was no more sticking in mud." A
favourable change in the weather accompanied our fortunate
transition, from the land of watery soil and dark woody ravines, to
an open country. The day was beautiful; and the balmy air was
sweetened with a perfume resembling hay, which arose from the thick
and matted herbs and grass. Proceeding along the valley, the stream
on our left vanished at an isolated, rocky hill; but, on closer
examination, I found the apparent barrier cleft in two, and that
the water passed through, roaring over rocks. This was rather a
singular feature in an open valley, where the ground on each side
of it, was almost as low as the rocky bed of the stream itself. The
hill was composed of granular felspar, in a state of decomposition;
the surrounding country consisting chiefly of very fine grained
sandstone. It is not so easy to suppose that the river could ever
have watered the valley in its present state, and forced its way
since, through that isolated hill of hard rock; as to believe that
the rock, now isolated, originally contained a chasm, and afforded
once the lowest channel for the water, before the valley, now so
open, had been scooped out on each side, by gradual decomposition.
Another rivulet approached this hill, flowing under its eastern
side, and joining the Wando just below. According to my plan of
following down the main river, it was necessary to cross both these
tributaries. In the open part of the valley, the channels of these
streams were deep, and the banks soft; but at the base of the hill
of Kinganyu (for such was its name,) we found rock enough, and
having effected a passage there of both streams that afternoon, we
encamped, after travelling about three miles further, on the banks
of the Glenelg once more. Our route lay straight across an open
grassy valley, at the foot of swelling hills of the same
description. Each of these vallies presented peculiar and very
romantic features, but I could not decide which looked most
beautiful. All contained excellent soil and grass, surpassing in
quality any I had seen in the present colony of New South Wales.
The chase of the emu and kangaroo, which were both numerous,
afforded us excellent sport on these fine downs. When about to
cross the Wando, I took my leave of the native woman before
mentioned, that she might not have the trouble of fording the
river, and I presented her with a tomahawk, of which our females
explained to her the use-although she seemed still at a loss to
conceive the meaning of a present. The use of the little hatchet
would be well enough known, however, to her tribe, so leaving her
to return to it, and assuring her at the same time of our friendly
disposition towards the natives, we proceeded.</p>

<p>The left bank of the principal stream was very bold, where we
reached it on this occasion, but still open, and covered with rich
turf. The right bank was woody, and this was generally its
character at the other points where we had seen the Glenelg. It was
flowing with considerable rapidity, amongst the same kind of bushes
we had met with above, but they did not appear so likely here to
obstruct the passage of boats.</p>

<p>On the plains, we found a singular acacia, the leaves being
covered with a clammy exudation resembling honey-dew. It differed
from A. graveolens in its much more rigid habit, shorter and
broader leaves, and much shorter peduncles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 11.</i>&mdash;Passing along the bank of the river, under
the steep grassy hills, which consisted of very fine-grained,
calcareous sandstone, we began, two miles on, to ascend these
heights; as well to avoid a place where they closed precipitously
on the Glenelg, as to gain a point, from which I hoped to command
an extensive view of its further course, and so cut off some of the
windings. From that point, or rather on riding through the woods to
some distance beyond it, I perceived that the river was joined by
another, coming from the south-east, through an open country of the
finest character. Below their junction, the principal river
disappeared on passing through a woody range, and turned towards
the south-west. Nothing could be seen beyond that crest, which
seemed a very predominant feature, bounding the fine valley of the
Wannon on the south. By turning round the eastern brow of the high
ground on which we then were, we gained a Ion, ridge of smooth
grassy land, leading, by an easy descent, from this height to the
junction of the rivers. This high ground was thickly wooded with
stringy-bark trees, of large dimensions, and a few other eucalypti,
together with banksia and casuarinae. The soil there was soft and
sandy, and the substratum contained masses of iron-stone. The
shrubs upon the whole reminded me of those in the wooded parts of
the sand hills on the shores of Port Jackson. Smoke arose from the
various parts of the distant country before us; and we perceived
one native running at prodigious speed across the plain below. On
reaching the banks of the Wannon, we found it a deep flowing
stream, about half as large as the river itself. We succeeded in
finding a ford, and crossed, after cutting away some bushes and
levelling the banks. Beyond the Wannon, we travelled 2&frac34; miles over
a portion of very fine country, and encamped in a little vale in
the bosom of a woody range, the western side of which overhung the
river at the distance of two miles.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 12.</i>&mdash;A fine clear morning gave full effect to
the beauty of the country which I now saw to the eastward, from a
hill near our camp. The summit of the Victoria range crowned the
distant landscape; and the whole of the intervening territory
appeared to consist of green hills, partially wooded. We crossed a
mountain stream by filling up its bed with logs, and as we ascended
the slopes beyond, we found the country grassy, until we reached
the high and wooded crest. Lofty stringy-bark trees and other
timber grew there on a white sandy soil; but we found among the
bushes, abundance of the anthistiria or kangaroo grass.</p>

<p>After travelling some miles beyond this crest, we at length
found the ground sloping to the southward; and some swampy hollows
with reeds in them, obliged us to turn to the right, or south-west,
as the water in these depressed parts falling eastward, or to the
left, shewed that we were not so very near the river, on the right,
which I was endeavouring to follow. We were delayed in several of
these hollows by the sinking of the carts and boat-carriage. We
next traversed an extensive moor or heath, on which the ground was
firm, and a little way beyond it, some rising ground bounded our
view. On ascending this highest feature which I named the Rifle
range, I found it commanded an extensive view over a low and woody
country. One peaked hill alone appeared on the otherwise level
horizon, and this bore 68&deg; W. of S. I supposed this to be Mount
Gambier, near Cape Northumberland, which, according to my survey,
ought to have appeared in that direction at a distance of
forty-five miles. I expected to find the river on reaching the
lower country beyond this range; but, instead of the Glenelg and
the rich country on its banks, we entered on extensive moors of the
most sterile description. They were, however, firm enough for
travelling upon, the surface being very level, and the soil a
whitish sand. These open wastes were interrupted, in some parts, by
clumps of stringy-bark forest, which entirely concealed from view
the extent of this kind of country. Swamps full of water, and
containing reeds of a dark yellow colour, at length became
numerous; and, although I succeeded in pursuing a course clear of
these obstacles, we were obliged to encamp at twilight, without
having any immediate prospect of a better country before us. There
was, however, abundance of grass in these wet swamps, and our carts
passed over one, quite covered with water, without sinking. Our
camp was marked out on a low hill of white sand, on which grew
mahogany and stringy-bark trees of large dimensions. The range from
which we had descended, now appeared continuous as far as we could
see eastward. Much smoke arose from this lower country when we
entered upon it, and after sunset, the incessant calls of a native
were heard near our camp, as if he had lost some comrade. I sent up
a rocket, that he might be convinced, we had not arrived by
stealth, as the tribes do, when they insidiously make war on each
other, but he only reiterated his calls the more.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 13.</i>&mdash;At. day-break, the cries of the native
were renewed. I then made Piper cooy to him, whereupon he became
silent, and I heard him no more, the natives of that country being,
as Piper expressed it, "still very wild". This morning we were on
the march as soon as the sun rose, all being very anxious to see
the river again, and a better country. At two miles, we passed
along a sandy ridge between two extensive swamps; but at a mile and
a half farther, I found at length a small hollow and water running
in it, a feature which convinced me at once, that the river could
not be very distant. In the bank there was a thin stratum of shelly
limestone, bearing a resemblance to some of the oolitic limestones
of England; and in the bed were irregular concretions of
iron-stone, containing grains of quartz, some of the concretions
having externally a glazed appearance, arising from a thin coating
of compact brown h&aelig;matite. <i>Casuarinae</i> and <i>banksia</i>
growing on grassy slopes, were the next marks of a different
country from that of the swamps, and at less than a mile from this
point, we came upon the river. Its banks had a different character
from that which they presented above, but they were still fine. The
river now flowed in a narrow valley, the bed being about 70 feet
below the common level of the swampy flats. At sharp bends, the
banks consisted of cliffs of a soft limestone, composed, in part,
of comminuted fragments of corallines, the interstices being rarely
filled up; the rock contained also a few specimens of Foraminifera,
most probably of recent species. In the narrow valley all was
flourishing and green, attesting the rich luxuriance of the
alluvial soil. The <i>mimosa</i> trees predominated, but still the
bushes of leptospermum darkened the stream, which was deep, rapid,
and muddy, its breadth being about 40 yards, and the bed consisting
of a friable or soft calcareous sandstone. In accompanying it in
its course downward, we met with less difficulty than I had
expected, but I perceived that the barren swampy land, or, more
frequently, the stringy-bark forests, approached the higher banks
on both sides the river. The few ravines falling in our way, were
only the drains from swamps close at hand, and they were easily
crossed by the party, at the fall of the ground, where we found
rocky strata. After tracing the river more than four miles, we
encamped on an elevated point overlooking a flat of good grass, so
necessary for the cattle.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 14.</i>&mdash;Some of the bullocks were missing, and we
were compelled to wait an hour or two, while parties went in search
of them; one party being guided by Piper, the other by the two
Tommies. I availed myself of the leisure afforded by this delay, to
measure the breadth, depth, and velocity of the river, which were
respectively as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Average breadth 35 yards.<br>
Mean depth 17 feet.<br>
Velocity of the current 1,863 yards per hour; the general course,
as far as we had traced this portion being nearly S.E.<br></p>

<p>When most of the cattle had been brought in, we proceeded, and
in endeavouring to keep along the highest ground between the
swamps, I unavoidably left the river at some distance on our right,
a circumstance I considered of less consequence, as the ground
appeared to be falling on my left towards some tributary; and at
four miles, we came upon a small river flowing rapidly, in a valley
nearly as deep and wide as the main stream. The country on its
immediate bank looked better than that last found on the main
stream. Limestone rock appeared in the bank opposite, and at the
foot of some cliffs we found fossil oyster-shells. Mr. Stapylton
traced this stream to its junction with the river, about two miles
lower down.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 15.</i>&mdash;Two bullocks were still missing, and I had
recourse to compulsory measures with Piper and the man who lost
them, in order to find them again; I declared that unless they were
found, Piper should have no provisions for a week; and I condemned
the man who lost them to be kept every second night on watch,
during the remainder of the journey. The passage of the little
river (which I named the Stokes, in memory of a brother officer,
who fell at Badajoz,) was not to be easily accomplished, owing to
the depth and softness of the alluvial soil, through which it
flowed. One place passable on horseback was found after long
search, by Mr. Stapylton and myself. Out of the bed of the stream
at that part, we drew some dead trees, and after two hours of great
exertion, the passage of the boat-carriage and carts was effected,
the latter sinking deeper in the water than they ever had done in
any river which we had previously forded. We found the country
beyond very intricate, being so intersected with swamps, draining
off in all directions, and so divided by stringybark forests, that
it was next to impossible to avoid the soft swampy ground, or reach
the river bank again. We headed one deep ravine falling towards it,
and had indeed travelled in the desired direction, about four miles
further on dry ground, but only by winding about as the swamps
permitted, when, at length, the ground appeared to slope towards
the river, being also covered with the fine grass and the kind of
trees which usually grew near it. But this ground, notwithstanding
its firm appearance, proved to be as soft, as that of Mount Mud;
and it spread at length around us on all sides, except that from
which we had approached it by so circuitous a route. We had no
alternative but to cross this bad ground, and after finding out, by
careful examination, the narrowest part, we prepared to pass to the
nearest firm ground beyond, an undertaking infinitely more
difficult and laborious to us, than the passage of the broadest
river. One of the carts was with much labour taken across, and
being anxious to know the actual situation of the river, I rode
southward into the wood, taking with me the chain or measuring men,
and leaving the rest of the people at work in the mud. I found much
of the ground equally soft as I proceeded, but all consisted of
excellent open forest-land, covered with good grass. I found there
a woolly Correa, profusely covered with pink, bell shaped blossoms,
and small round rufous leaves; and the beautiful Kennedya prostrata
was climbing among the bushes, and rendering them brilliant with
its rich crimson flowers. At length I approached a ravine on the
left, which I at first took for that of the river; but I soon
perceived through the trees on my right, a still greater opening,
and there I at last found the valley of the Glenelg. In the ravine
to the left ran another small stream, rather larger than that
crossed yesterday. We reached the bank of this at 21 miles from the
place where we left the party, and at about half a mile above its
junction with the main stream. The high ground between the two
streams terminated in a round, grassy promontory, overlooking one
of the finest flats imaginable. I determined to endeavour once
more, to explore the river's course with the boats; provided we
should succeed in transporting them over the mud to this spot; and
I returned with this intention to the muddy scene, where I had left
the men. It was quite dark before I found it again, and then they
had succeeded in getting through only the three light carts. I did
not despair of accomplishing the passage, at least in the course of
time; but I was indeed impatient for daylight, that I might
carefully examine with that view, all parts of the country between
our camp and the place where I intended to launch the boats into
the Glenelg again.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 15.</i>&mdash;This morning it rained heavily, and there
was a balmy and refreshing mildness in the air, probably owing to
the vicinity of the sea. It occurred to me, that as the ground
appeared to slope towards the south-east, we might reach some
hollow on that side leading to the little river, we discovered
yesterday; and that such a hollow would afford the best chance of
escape from the soft flats, which now impeded us, since the
drainage they afforded to the immediate banks, was likely to leave
them at least firm enough to be travelled upon. On this principle
alone, I understood why the ground, on the banks of the stream seen
yesterday, was so firm; and I therefore hoped that the head of any
ravine, found near our camp, would lead by a dry though perhaps
circuitous route, first to the tributary, and next, by its bank, to
the point already mentioned, where it joined the Glenelg. I
accordingly instructed Mr. Stapylton to examine the ground in the
direction proposed, while I superintended the exertions of the
party to drag the boat-carriage through the mud. We finally
succeeded in this last effort, and just as I stood watching with
joy the ascent of the carriage to the firm ground beyond, Mr.
Stapylton came to me with the intelligence, that he had found the
head of a ravine, and firm ground on its bank, in the direction
where he had been. One bad place alone intervened between our
present position and the firm ground at the head of the ravine, but
this, Mr. Stapylton said, was very bad indeed. By 10 A.M.
everything was got across the first swamp, the loads of all the
carts having been carried by the men. To the new difficulty
mentioned by Mr. Stapylton, I therefore led them next, and we soon
accomplished the passage of the light carts; after which I
proceeded, leaving to Mr. Stapylton the management of the rest,
having first brought the boat-carriage within reach of the firm
ground opposite, by means of blocks and tackle attached to trees,
and drawn by five bullocks. On going forward with the carts, I was
guided altogether by the course of the ravine or gully, keeping
along the fall of the ground, and so avoiding the softer soil
above. Thus we proceeded successfully, for although another ravine
came in our way, I managed to travel round its head, near which I
found a place where we crossed the small water-course it contained,
by filling up the chasm with logs. On passing this, we entered the
stringy-bark forest, which I had traversed on the day previous; and
I at length recognised through the trees, the hill from which I had
seen the junction of the streams. A tremendous hail-storm met us in
the face, just as we descended to encamp in the valley, near the
bank of the river, but this troubled us but little, while we were
up to the waist in the thickest crop of grass, growing on the
richest black soil, I had ever seen. Mr. Staplyton and Burnett came
up in the evening with the intelligence, that the whole party had
effected a safe passage across the swampy ground; but that the
wheels of the boat-carriage and some of the carts had sunk deep in
the earth, where I had previously crossed on horseback followed by
the light carts without leaving any impression, and that
consequently they had made but little progress beyond the
swamp.</p>

<br>
<b>THE RIVER DARLING, 1838</b>
</p>
<br>

<p><i>Aug. 17.</i>&mdash;I sent Burnett back with some spare
bullocks to assist the people in bringing on the carts and the
boat-carriage, a man having been despatched from them early to
inform me, that the carriage had again stuck fast. Piper drew my
attention to the sound of a distant waterfall, which, he said, he
had heard all night, and wished now to go down the river to look
at. I directed him to do so, and to examine the river also still
further if he could, that he might bring back information as to how
the boats might get down the stream. On his return in the
afternoon, he stated, that the river was joined just below, by
several large streams from the left, and by one still larger from
the right, which falling on rocks, made the noise he had heard,
during the night: also, that on climbing a high tree he had seen
the river very large "like the Murray", adding that it was
excellent for boats. All this news only made me the more impatient
to embark in them, while they were still afar on the muddy hills.
The whole day passed without any tidings of their approach, and
another night had closed over us, before I heard the distant calls
of the bullock-drivers; but I had the satisfaction soon after of
seeing the whole party and equipment again united on the banks of
this promising stream. The barometer was rising, the spring was
advancing, and the approaching warmth might be expected to harden
the ground. The cattle would be refreshed by a week's rest in the
midst of the rich pasture around us, while our labours to all
appearance were on the eve of being crowned by the discovery of
some harbour, which might serve as a port to one of the finest
regions upon earth. At all events, if we could no longer travel on
land, we had at length arrived with two boats within reach of the
sea, and this alone was a pleasing reflection after the delays we
had lately experienced.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 18.</i>&mdash;An uncommonly fine morning succeeded a
clear frosty night. The boats were hoisted out to be launched once
more on the bosom of the newly discovered Glenelg; and they were
loaded with what the party going with them might require for ten
days. I left with Mr. Stapylton instructions, that the men under
his charge should move up to, and occupy the round point of the
hill, a position which I named Fort O'Hare, in memory of a truly
brave soldier, my commanding officer, who fell at Badajoz in
leading the forlorn hope of the Light Division to the storm. At
twelve o'clock, I embarked on the river with sixteen men, in two
boats, leaving eight with Mr. Stapylton in the depot. We met with
many dead trees for the first mile or two, but none of these either
prevented or delayed our passage; and the river then widened into
fine reaches wholly clear of timber, so that the passage further
down was quite uninterrupted. The scenery on the banks was pleasing
and various; at some points picturesque limestone cliffs overhung
the river, and cascades flowed out of caverns hung with
stalactites; at others, the shores were festooned with green
dripping shrubs and creepers, or terminated in a smooth grassy bank
sloping to the water's edge. But none of the banks consisted of
water-worn earth; they were in general low and grassy, bounding the
alluvial flats, that lay between the higher points of land. Within
the first three or four miles from Fort O'Hare, two tributaries
joined the main stream from the right or westward, and one from the
left or eastward; one of the former ending in a noisy cascade at
the junction. The river soon opened to a uniform width of sixty
yards, its waters being everywhere smooth and unruffled, and the
current scarcely perceptible. Ducks were always to be seen in the
reaches before us, and very frequently the ornithorynchus
paradoxus, an animal which had not, I believe, been hitherto seen
so near the sea. After rowing about sixteen miles we landed on the
left bank, near a cascade falling from under a limestone cliff, and
there we encamped for the night. The sun was setting in a cloudless
sky, while I eagerly ascended the highest cliffs in hopes of
obtaining a sight of the coast, but nothing was visible beyond a
gently undulating woody country, some swamps alone appearing in it
to the westward. The land about the cliffs of limestone, was
tolerably good and grassy, but towards the end of this day's pull,
forests of the stringy-bark sort of eucalyptus, having in them
trees of large dimensions, closed on the river. We endeavoured, but
in vain, to catch fish, and whether the waters contained the
cod-perch (Gristes Peelii) or not, remained a question. Our
position and our prospects were now extremely interesting, and
throughout the night, I was impatient for the light of the next
day.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 19.</i>&mdash;I arose at three in order to determine the
latitude more exactly, by the altitude of various stars then
approaching the meridian. These were Aries and Menkar; while the
two feet of the Centaur, both fine circum-polar stars, were so
steadily reflected in the placid stream, that I obtained by that
means, the altitude of both below the pole. It was most essential
to the accuracy of my survey of the river, that I should determine
the latitude as frequently and exactly as possible. The sun
afterwards rose in a cloudless sky, and I ascertained the breadth
of the river, by means of a micrometer telescope, to be exactly 70
yards. We continued our interesting voyage, and found the river of
very uniform width, and that its depth increased.</p>

<p>The current was slower but still perceptible, although we found
the water had ebbed six inches during the night, an indication that
it was already influenced by the tide, although it tasted perfectly
fresh. At a place where I observed the sun's meridian altitude, I
found the breadth on measurement to be 71 yards, and the depth, on
sounding, 4&frac12;, 3&frac12;, and 3 fathoms. The direction of the course had
there, however, changed. To the camp of last night it had been
remarkably straight towards south-south-east, although full of
turnings, being what may be termed "straight serpentine," and I had
accordingly expected to find the estuary at Portland Bay, in which
case it was likely to be sheltered sufficiently by Cape Nelson to
form a harbour. Now, however, the general course was nearly west,
and it preserved the same general direction without much winding,
during the progress we made throughout the day. I had therefore
every reason to suppose, that it would thus terminate in the wide
bay between Cape Northumberland and Cape Bridgewater. The scenery
on the long reaches was in many places very fine, from the
picturesque character A the limestone-rock, and the tints and
outline of the trees, shrubs, and creepers upon the banks. In some
places stalactitic-grottoes, covered with red and yellow creepers,
overhung or enclosed cascades; at other points, casuarinae and
banksia were festooned with creeping vines, whose hues of warm
green or brown were relieved by the grey cliffs of more remote
reaches, as they successively opened before us. Black swans being
numerous, we shot several; and found some eggs, which we thought a
luxury, among the bulrushes at the water's edge. But we had left,
as it seemed, all the good grassy land behind us; for the
stringy-bark and a species of Xanthorhaea (grass tree), grew to the
water's edge, both where the soil looked black and rich, and where
it possessed that red colour which distinguishes the best soil in
the vicinity of limestone rock. One or two small tributaries joined
the river, the principal one coming from the left bank, at that
point or angle, where the great change takes place in its course.
When the sun was near setting, we put ashore on this bank, and from
a tree on the highest part of the country behind it, we now once
again saw Mount Gambier, bearing 57&deg; W. of N. Here the water
was slightly brackish but still very good for use; the saltness
being most perceptible when the water was used for tea. The river
had increased considerably both in width and depth; for here the
measured breadth was 101 yards, and the mean depth, five fathoms.
It was, upon the whole, considering the permanent fullness of its
stream, the character of its banks, and uniformity of width and
depth, the finest body of fresh water I had seen in Australia; and
our hopes were that day sanguine that we should find an outlet to
the sea of proportionate magnitude.</p>

<p>Aug. 20. This morning I found there was a rise of six inches in
the river, evidently the effect of tide as the water was brackish
although still fit for use. The reach on which we embarked afforded
us a view for a mile further down the river; the vista being truly
picturesque and with the interest attached to the scene it looked
indeed quite enchanting. We pulled on through the silent waters,
awakening the slumbering echoes with many a shot at the numerous
swans or ducks. At length another change took place in the general
course of the river which from west turned to east-south-east. The
height of the banks appeared to diminish rapidly and a very
numerous flock of the small sea-swallow or tern indicated our
vicinity to the sea. The slow-flying pelican also with its huge
bill pursued, regardless of strangers its straight-forward course
over the waters.</p>

<p>A small bushy island next came in sight having on it some rocks
resembling what we should have thought a great treasure then, a
pile of flour-bags and we named it accordingly the Isle of
Bags.</p>

<p>Soon after passing the island a few low, sandy-looking hills
appeared before us; and we found ourselves between two basins where
in the water was very shallow although we had sounded just
previously to entering one of them in four fathoms. The widest lay
directly before us but having no outlet we steered into the other
on the right and on rounding a low rocky point we saw the green
rolling breakers of the sea through an opening which proved to be
the mouth of the river. It consisted of two low rocky points and as
soon as we had pulled outside of them we landed on the eastern one.
In the two basins we had seen there was scarcely sufficient water
to float the boats and thus our hopes of finding a port at the
mouth of this fine river were at once at an end. The sea broke on a
sandy beach outside and on ascending one of the sandhills near it I
perceived Cape Northumberland; the rocks outside called the
Carpenters bearing 7 degrees 20 minutes South of West (variation 3
degrees 30 minutes) and being distant, as I judged, about fifteen
miles. Mount Gambier bore 23 degrees 40 minutes North of West and a
height which seemed near the extreme point of the coast on the
eastward and which I therefore took for Cape Bridge water bore 52
degrees East of South.</p>
<br>

<br>
<b>MOUTH OF THE GLENELG</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>These points seemed distant from each other about forty miles;
the line of coast between forming one grand curve or bay which
received this river at the deepest part and which I now named
Discovery Bay.</p>

<p>There was no reef of rocks upon the bar; a circumstance to be
regretted in this case for it was obvious that the entrance to this
fine river and the two basins, was choked merely by the sand thrown
up by the sea. The river was four fathoms deep, the water being
nearly fresh enough for use, within sight of the shore.
Unfortunately, perhaps, for navigation, there is but little tide on
that coast; the greatest rise in the lower part of the river
(judging by the floating weeds,) did not exceed a foot. I was too
intent on the completion of my survey, to indulge much in
contemplating the welcome sight of old ocean; but when a plank was
picked up by the men on that desolate shore, and we found the
initials, I.W.B., and the year 1832, carved on wood which had
probably grown in old England, the sea really seemed like home to
us. Although it was low water, a boat might easily have been got
out, and it is probable that in certain states of the tide and
sand, small craft might get in; but I, nevertheless, consider the
mouth of this river quite unavailable as a harbour. Near the beach
were holes, dug apparently by the natives, in which we found the
water perfectly sweet. The hills sheltering the most eastern of the
two basins, were well wooded, as were also those behind. The line
of sandhills on the beach seemed to rise into forest hills, at
about five miles further eastward, and all those in the west, to
within a short distance of the coast, were equally woody. The day
was squally, with rain; nevertheless, during an interval of
sunshine, I obtained the sun's meridian altitude, making the
latitude 38&deg; 2' 58" S. I also completed, by two P.M., my survey
of the mouth of the river and adjacent country; and we then again
embarked to return a few miles up the river, and encamp where wood
and water were at hand. On re-entering the river from the sea, I
presented the men with a bottle of whiskey, with which it was
formally named the Glenelg, after the present Secretary of State
for the Colonies, according to my previous intention.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 21.</i>&mdash;We had encamped in a rather remarkable
hollow on the right bank, at the extreme western bend of the fiver.
There was no modern indication, that water either lodged in or ran
through that ravine, although the channel resembled in width the
bed of some considerable tributary; the rock presenting a section
of cliffs on each side, and the bottom being broad, but consisting
of black earth only, in which grew trees of <i>eucalyptus.</i> I
found, on following it some way up, that it led to a low tract of
country, which I regretted much I could not then examine further. I
found shells embedded in limestone, varying considerably in its
hardness, being sometimes very friable, and the surface, in some
places, presenting innumerable fragments of corallines, with
pectens, spatangi, echini, ostrea, and foraminifera. In the
opposite bank of the river, I found several thin strata of compact
chert, containing probably fragments of corallines, not only on the
surface, but imbedded in the limestone. In pulling up the river
this morning, we observed a cavern or opening in the side of the
limestone rock, and having ascended to it by means of a rope, we
entered with lights. It proved to be only a large fissure, and
after penetrating about 150 yards under ground, we met with red
earth, apparently fallen from the surface. We found, at the mouth
of the fissure, some fine specimens of shells, coral, and other
marine productions, embedded in several thin strata of a coarser
structure, under one of very compact limestone, upwards of 20 feet
thick. While the people in the boat awaited us there, a fish was
taken by Muirhead, who had also caught the first fish in the river
Darling. That of the Glenelg was a salt-water fish, known at Sydney
by the name of Snapper.</p>

<p>The weather was more moderate today, although still showery; and
the scenery, as we proceeded upwards, was very picturesque, and
full of variety. At sunset, we encamped about a mile and a half
short of our camp of the 18th, and just as the trees were groaning
under a heavy squall, which obliged us to land on the first spot
where sufficient room was left in the thick woods, for our tents.
This spot happened to be on a steep bit of bank; and, in the
evening, I was called in haste to a new danger. The wind had
suddenly changed, and blew with great fury, filling my tent with
sparks from a large fire which burnt before it. I had placed in it,
according to usual custom, our stock of ammunition packed in a keg;
and, notwithstanding these precautions, its preservation now,
between the two elements of fire and water, was rather doubtful. We
contrived, however, to avert the danger, and were no more disturbed
during the night, except by the storm.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 22.</i>&mdash;The squally weather continued until noon,
when sunbeams again adorned the river-scenery. We met with no
impediment in the current, until within about six miles of the
depot camp, when dead trees in the channel began again to appear;
but we passed them all without hindrance, and reached Fort O'Hare
at two o'clock, where we found all well. Mr. Stapylton had set
Vulcan to repair the broken chains, etc.&mdash;a ford had been
cleared across the stream, from the north east, which I named the
Crawford; and the cattle being refreshed, we were once more in trim
to continue the land journey. The height of the water in the river
had undergone no change during our absence, and was probably about
its usual level there, although I observed abundant marks of flood
in the branches of trees, where dry floated matter remained at the
height of fifteen feet above the water, as it stood then. The rock
about this position consisted of limestone, apparently similar to
that seen on its banks higher up. It possessed a stalactitic
aspect, by the infiltration of calcareous matter, and, in crevices
below, I found a reddish stalagmite containing grains of sand.
Large petrified oyster shells, lay loosely about the bank above
these cliffs. No natives had approached the depot during our
absence, and we had indeed reason to believe that the adjacent
country contained but few inhabitants. During the afternoon, I laid
down my survey of the estuary of the Glenelg, and completed, by 10
p.m. not only my plan of it, but that of the river also. I found a
considerable difference between the result of my survey and the
Admiralty charts, not only in the longitude, but also in the
relative position of the two capes with respect to Mount Gambier, a
solitary hill easily recognised.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 23.</i>&mdash;Having at length disposed of the course of
the Glenelg, my next object was to cross and examine the high
ground which enclosed its basin on the east, supplying those
tributaries which the river received from its left bank, and
evidently extending from the Grampians to Cape Bridgewater. I had
named this the Rifle range, in crossing that branch of it extending
northwestward, when I ascertained its characteristics to be lofty
woods and swamps; but its ramifications in other directions, and
how it was connected backwards with the mountains, still remained
to be discovered; and from what I did know of this range, I
apprehended considerable difficulty in getting over it with our
heavy carriages, at such a season. That we might, if possible,
escape the bogs, I devoted the day to an extensive reconnoissance
of the country before us; my guile in this case being the river
Crawford, which, flowing in deep ravines, was likely to afford (so
long as its general course continued to be nearly parallel to our
route), one means at least of avoiding those soft swampy flats,
which could not possibly impede us, so long as the side of such a
ravine as that of the river was within reach. I had the good
fortune to find that the range in general was firm under the hoof,
and its direction precisely such as I wished. Extensive swamps
occasionally appeared on my right; but I had on the left the deep
ravines of the Crawford, and I travelled across the highest slopes
of the ground. Having thus found good sound turf, for twelve miles
in the direction in which I wished to take the carriages, I
returned on descending from a trap-range, where the rock consisted
of granular felspar and hornblende with crystals of glassy felspar.
On this hill the soil was exceedingly rich, and the grass green and
luxuriant. I obtained thence a most useful bearing on Mount
Gambier, and saw also some heights to the eastward, beyond the
Rifle range. The timber grew to an enormous size on the ranges
which I traversed this day; it consisted chiefly of that useful
species of eucalyptus, known as "stringy-bark." Some of the trees
we measured were 13 feet and one as much as 14&frac12; feet in
circumference, and 80 feet was no uncommon height. The fallen
timber was of such magnitude as to present a new impediment to our
progress, for we had not previously met with such an obstruction on
any journey.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 24.</i>&mdash;The carriages were taken across the
Crawford without much delay, considering its depth and the softness
of the banks. The carts sank at least five feet in the water, yet
nothing was damaged, for we had taken care to pack the flour and
other perishable articles on the tops of the loads. We succeeded in
crossing the rivulets at the heads of several ravines, by filling
up their channels with logs; and thus, after crossing the last of
these, and ascending the steep bank beyond it, we encamped, after a
journey of seven miles. The weather had been stormy on both days,
since I crossed the Crawford, a circumstance very much against our
progress. Near this camp, we found a new Correa, resembling C.
virens, but having distinctly cordate toothed leaves, with less
down on their under side, and a much shorter calyx.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 25.</i>&mdash;In our progress eastward, we were still
governed by the line of the Crawford; and the tortuous direction of
the ravines connected with it, required constant attention, while
the very variable character of the swamps at the head of them was
still more perplexing. We succeeded in finding a passage between
all, this day also, and on again crossing a small mountain torrent
by filling up the chasm with dead timber, we encamped after another
journey of seven miles. On our left to the northward, lay a deep
valley, in which we found a broad sheet of water covered with
ducks, the banks being soft and overgrown with reeds. A
considerable stream flowed westward from this lake through a narrow
part of the valley, so that I concluded we were still on the
principal branch of the Crawford. Trees of large dimensions were
abundant, and the fallen timber impeded our progress even more,
than any unusual softness of the earth.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 26</i>.&mdash;After proceeding several miles without
lett or hindrance, having successfully crossed some swampy
rivulets, all flowing to the left amidst thick scrubs, we at length
arrived at a water-course in which my horse went down, and which
filled a very wide swampy bed, enclosed by a thick growth of young
mimosa trees, through which it was necessary to cut a passage wide
enough for the carts. The scrub&mdash;having been thus cleared to
the extent of about 100 yards with much labour, I found only then,
unfortunately, that although the roots grew very closely, and that
water flowed over the surface, the earth was withal so soft, that I
could at every point, with ease, push a stick five feet down,
without reaching any firm bottom. The loose cattle were driven in,
an experiment which until then we had tried with success, in
doubtful places&mdash;but they with difficulty got across this, for
one of them sank and could not be extricated without considerable
delay. While the men were busily employed there, I rode to the head
of the swamp, which extended about a mile to the southward. On this
swampy plain I at length succeeded in finding, with Mr. Stapylton's
assistance, a line of route likely to bear the carts, and we passed
safely in that direction, not one carriage having gone down. While
on this swampy surface, we distinctly heard the breakers of the
sea, apparently at no great distance to the south-west, and I was
convinced that the head of this swamp was about the highest ground
immediately adjacent to Discovery Bay. On travelling a mile and a
half further, we reached a small rivulet, the first we had crossed
flowing to the south. Beyond it the country appeared open and good,
consisting of what is termed forest-land, with casuarinae and
banksia growing upon it. We had at length reached the highest parts
of the range, and were about to descend into the country beyond it.
We continued to travel a considerable distance further than the
rivulet flowing to the south. Crossing others running northward or
to the left, and leaving also on the same side a swamp, we finally
came to a higher range clothed with trees of gigantic size,
attesting the strength and depth of the soil, and here enormous old
trunks obstructed our passage, covering the surface so as to form
an impediment almost as great to us as the swampy ground had been;
but this large timber so near the coast, was an important feature
in that country. Piper having climbed to the top of one of these
trees, perceived some fine green hills to the south-east, saying
they were very near us, and that the sea was visible beyond them.
It was late in the afternoon, when I reluctantly changed my
intended route, which had been until then eastward, to proceed in
the direction recommended by Piper, or to the south-east, and so to
follow down a valley, instead of my proposed route, which had been
along a favourable range. I had still less reason to be satisfied
with the change when, after pushing my horse through thick scrubs
and bogs until twilight, and looking in vain for a passage for the
carts, I encountered at length bushes so thickly set, and bogs so
soft, that any further progress in that direction was out of the
question; and thus on the evening when I hoped to have entered a
better sort of country, after so successful a passage of the range,
we encamped where but little grass could be found for the cattle,
our tents being not only under lofty trees, but amongst thick
bushes and bogs during very rainy weather.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 27.</i>&mdash;I was so anxious to get into open ground
again, that as soon as daylight permitted, I carefully examined the
environs of our camp, and I found that we occupied a broad flat,
where the drainage from the hills met and spread among bushes; so
that at one time, I almost despaired of extricating the party
otherwise than by returning to the hill at which I had first
altered my route. The track we made, had been, however, so much cut
up by our wheels, that I preferred the chance of finding a passage
northward, which, of course, was also less out of our way. We
reached an extremity of the hill, (the nearest to us on that side,)
with much less difficulty than I had reason to apprehend; and
keeping along that feature, we soon regained a range, which led us
east-north-east. By proceeding in this direction, however, we could
not avoid the passage of a valley where the water was not confined
to any channel, but spread and lodged on a wide tract of very soft
ground, also covered with mimosa bushes, and a thick growth of
young saplings of eucalyptus. The light carts and the first heavy
cart got over this soft ground or bog, but the others, and the boat
carriage, sank up to the axles, so that we were obliged to halt
after having proceeded about five miles only. This was near a fine
forest-hill, consisting of trap-rock in a state of decomposition,
but apparently similar to that of the trap range I had ascended on
the 23rd of August; and from a tree there, Burnett thought he saw
the sea to the north-east, and even to the northward of a
remarkable conical hill. The discovery of the sea in that
direction, was so different from the situation of the shore as laid
down on the maps, that I began to hope an inlet might exist there
as yet undiscovered&mdash;the "Cadong" perhaps, of the native
woman, "where white men had never been." I had now proceeded far
enough to the eastward, to be able to examine the coast about
Portland Bay, and extend my survey to the capes in its
neighbourhood, the better to ascertain their longitude. I therefore
determined to make an excursion in that direction, and thus afford
time not only for the extrication of the heavy carts still
remaining in the mud, but also for the repose of the cattle after
their labours.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 28.</i>&mdash;By the survey proposed, I hoped to extend
my map of the country sufficiently in that direction to be at
liberty, on my return to the party, to pursue a route directly
homeward; not doubting that at a short distance to the northward of
our camp, we should again enter the beautiful open country, which,
when seen from the mouth of the Wannon, seemed to extend as far as
could be seen to the eastward. In our ride to the south, we
reached, at four miles from the boggy ground, a fine green hill
consisting of trap-rock, and connected with a ridge of the same
description, which extended about two miles further to the
southward. There we found it to terminate abruptly in a lofty brow
quite clear of timber, and commanding an extensive view to the east
and south, over a much lower country. This hill had a very
remarkable feature&mdash;a deep chasm, separating it from the ridge
behind, the sides being so steep, as to present a section of the
trap-rock, which consisted principally of compact felspar. The
hill, which I named Mount Eckersley, was covered, as well as the
ridge to which it belonged, with a luxuriant crop of anthistirium,
or kangaroo grass. Unfortunately the weather was squally, but by
awaiting the intervals between clouds on the horizon, I obtained
angles, at length, on nearly all the distant hills, the waters of
Portland Bay just appearing in the south over an intervening woody
ridge. From this hill I recognised a very conspicuous, flat-topped
hill to the northward, which had been previously included in a
series of angles observed on the 12th instant from the valley of
the Wannon, and which I now named Mount Napier. Portland Bay was
distant about fifteen miles, but the intervening country seemed so
low, and swamps, entirely clear of timber, appeared in so many
places, that I could scarcely hope to get through it&mdash;knowing
it to contain all the water from those boggy vallies where our
progress had been already so much impeded. Smoke arose from various
parts of the lower country&mdash;a proof that at least some dry
land was there. We were provided with horses only, and, therefore,
desperately determined to flounder through or even to swim if
necessary, we thrust them down the hill. On its side we met an emu
which stood and stared, apparently fearless, as if the strange
quadrupeds had withdrawn its keen eye from the more familiar
enemies who bestrode them. In the lower country we saw also a
kangaroo, an animal that seldom frequents marshy lands. I was
agreeably surprised to find also, on descending, that the rich
grass extended among the trees across the lower country; and I was
still more pleased on coming to a fine running stream, at about
three miles from the hill, and after crossing a tract of land of
the richest description. Reeds grew thickly amongst the long grass,
and the ground appeared to be of a different character from any
that I had previously seen. This seemed to be just such land as
would produce wheat during the driest seasons, and never become
sour even in the wettest, such as this season undoubtedly was. The
timber was thin and light, and with a fine deep stream flowing
through it, the tract which at first sight from Mount Eckersley, I
had considered so sterile and wet, proved to be one likely, at no
distant day, to smile under luxuriant crops of grain. We found the
river (which I named the Fitzroy) fordable, although deep at the
place where we first came upon it. Shady trees of the mimosa kind
grew along the banks, and the earth was now good and firm on both
sides. We heard the natives as we approached this stream, and
cooyed to them; but our calls had only the effect, as appeared from
the retiring sound of their voices, of making them run faster away.
Continuing our ride southward, we entered at two miles beyond the
Fitzroy, a forest of the stringy-bark eucalyptus; and, although the
anthistirium still grew in hollows, I saw swampy open flats before
us, which I endeavoured to avoid, sometimes by passing between
them, and, finally, by turning to a woody range on the left. I
ascended this range as night came on, in hopes of finding grass for
our horses; but there the mimosa and xanthorhaea alone
prevailed-the latter being a sure indication of sterility, and
scanty vegetation. We found naked ground higher up, consisting of
deep lagoons and swamps, amongst which I was satisfied with my
success, in passing through in such a direction, as enabled me to
regain, in a dark and stormy night, the shelter of the woods on the
side of the range. But I sought in vain for the grass, so abundant
elsewhere on this day's ride, and we were at length under the
necessity of halting for the night, where but little food could be
found for our horses, and under lofty trees that creaked and
groaned to the blast.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 29.</i>&mdash;The groaning trees had afforded us
shelter, without letting fall even a single branch upon our heads,
but the morning was squally and unfavourable for the objects of the
excursion, and we had still to ride some way, before I could
commence operations. Proceeding along the skirts of the woody ridge
on the left in order to avoid swamps, we at length saw through the
trees, the blue waters of the sea and heard the roar of the waves.
My intended way towards the deepest part of the bay, and the hills
beyond it, did not lead directly to the shore, and I continued to
pursue a course through the woods, having the shore on our left. We
thus met a deep and rapid little river, exactly resembling the
Fitzroy, and coming also from the westward. Tracing this a short
distance upwards, we came to a place set with a sort of trellice
work of bushes by the natives, for the purpose, no doubt, of
catching fish. Here we found the stream fordable, though deep; a
brownish granular limestone appearing in the bank. We crossed, and
then continuing through a thick wood, we came out at length on the
shore of Portland Bay, at about four miles beyond the little river.
Straight before us lay "Laurence's Island", or rather, islands,
there being two small islets of rock in that situation; and, some
way to the eastward, I perceived a much larger island, which I
concluded was one of "Lady Julia Percy's Isles." At a quarter of a
mile back from the beach, broad broom-topped casuarinae were the
only trees we could see; these grew on long ridges, parallel to the
beach, resembling those long breakers, which, aided by winds, had
probably thrown such ridges up. They were abundantly covered with
excellent grass; and, as it wanted about an hour of noon, I halted
that the cattle might feed, while I took some angles, and
endeavoured to obtain the sun's altitude during the intervals
between heavy squalls; some of which were accompanied by hail and
thunder. On reaching the sea shore at this beach, I turned to
observe the face of "Tommy Came-last", one of my followers, who
being a native from the interior, had never before seen the sea. I
could not discover in the face of this young savage, even on his
first view of the ocean, any expression of surprise; on the
contrary, the placid and comprehensive gaze he cast over it, seemed
fully to embrace the grand expanse then for the first time opened
to him. I was much more astonished, when he soon after came to tell
me of the fresh tracks of cattle, that he had found on the shore,
and the shoe marks of a white man. He also brought me portions of
tobacco-pipes, and a glass bottle without a neck. That whaling
vessels occasionally touched there, I was aware, as was indeed
obvious from the carcases and bones of whales on the beach; but how
cattle could have been brought there, I did not understand.
Proceeding round the bay with the intention of examining the head
of an inlet and continuing along shore as far as Cape Bridgewater,
I was struck with the resemblance to houses that some supposed grey
rocks under the grassy cliffs presented; and while I directed my
glass towards them, my servant Brown said he saw a brig at anchor;
a fact of which I was soon convinced, and also that the grey rocks
were in reality wooden houses. The most northern part of the shore
of this bay was comparatively low, but the western consisted of
bold cliffs rising to the height of 180 feet.</p>

<p>We ascended these cliffs near the wooden houses, which proved to
be some deserted sheds of the whalers. One shot was heard as we
drew near them, and another on our ascending the rocks. I then
became somewhat apprehensive that the parties might either be, or
suppose us to be, bushrangers, and to prevent if possible some such
awkward mistake, I ordered a man to fire a gun and the bugle to be
sounded; but on reaching the higher ground, we discovered not only
a beaten path, but the track of two carts, and while we were
following the latter, a man came towards us from the face of the
cliffs. He informed me in answer to my questions, that the vessel
at anchor was the "Elizabeth of Launceston"; and that just round
the point there was a considerable farming establishment, belonging
to Messrs. Henty, who were then at the house. It then occurred to
me, that I might there procure a small additional supply of
provisions, especially of flour, as my men were on very reduced
rations. I, therefore, approached the house, and was kindly
received and entertained by the Messrs. Henty, who as I learnt had
been established there during upwards of two years. It was very
obvious indeed from the magnitude and extent of the buildings, and
the substantial fencing erected, that both time and labour had been
expended in their construction. A good garden stocked with
abundance of vegetables, already smiled on Portland Bay; the soil
was very rich on the overhanging cliffs, and the potatoes and
turnips produced there, surpassed in magnitude and quality any I
had ever seen elsewhere. I learnt that the bay was much resorted to
by vessels engaged in the whale fishery, and that upwards of 700
tons of oil had been shipped that season. I was likewise, informed
that only a few days before my arrival, five vessels lay at anchor
together in that bay, and that a communication was regularly kept
up with Van Diemen's Land by means of vessels from Launceston.
Messrs. Henty were importing sheep and cattle as fast as vessels
could be found to bring them over, and the numerous whalers
touching at or fishing on the coast, were found to be good
customers for farm produce and whatever else could be spared from
the establishment.</p>

<p>Portland Bay is well sheltered from all winds except the
east-south-east, and the anchorage is so good that a vessel is said
to have rode out a gale even from this quarter. The part of the
western shore where the land is highest, shelters a small bay,
which might be made a tolerable harbour by means of two piers or
quays, erected on reefs of a kind of rock apparently very
favourable for the purpose, namely amygdaloidal trap in rounded
boulders. The present anchorage in four fathoms is on the outside
of these reefs, and the water in this little bay is in general
smooth enough for the landing of boats. A fine stream falls into
the bay there, and the situation seems altogether a most eligible
one for the site of a town. The rock is trap, consisting
principally of felspar; and the soil is excellent, as was amply
testified by the luxuriant vegetation in Mr. Henty's garden.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 30.</i>&mdash;I proceeded with the theodolite to a
height near Cape Nelson, and from it I intersected that cape and
also Cape Bridgewater, Cape Sir William Grant, the islands to the
eastward, etc. I here recognised also the high hill, which appeared
within these capes when first seen from the westward. It formed the
most elevated part of the Rifle range at its termination on the
coast, and I was informed by Mr. Henty, that there was a fine lake
at its base. I named the Hill Mount Kincaid, after my old and
esteemed friend of Peninsular recollections. Returning to the party
at Portland Bay, where I had left my sextant, I then obtained a
good observation on the sun's meridian altitude. I was accommodated
with a small supply of flour by Messrs. Henty, who having been
themselves on short allowance, were awaiting the arrival of a
vessel then due two weeks. They also supplied us with as many
vegetables, as the men could carry away on their horses, just as I
was about to leave the place, a "whale" was announced, and
instantly three boats, well manned, were seen cutting through the
water, a harpooneer standing up at the stem of each with oar in
hand, and assisting the rowers by a forward movement at each
stroke. It was not the least interesting scene in these my
Australian travels, thus to witness from a verandah on a beautiful
afternoon at Portland Bay, the humours of the whale fishery, and
all those wondrous perils of harpooners and whale boats of which I
had delighted to read as scenes of "the stormy north". The object
of the present pursuit was "a hunchback", and being likely to
occupy the boats for some time, I proceeded homewards. I understood
it frequently happened, that several parties of fishermen, left by
different whaling vessels, would engage in the pursuit of the same
whale, and that in the struggle for possession, the whale would
occasionally escape from them all and run ashore, in which case it
is of little value to whalers, as the removal, etc. would be too
tedious, and they in such cases carry away part of the head matter
only. The natives never approach these whalers, nor had they ever
shewn themselves to the white people of Portland Bay; but as they
have taken to eat the cast-away whales, it is their custom to send
up a column of smoke when a whale appears in the bay, and the
fishers understand the signal. This affords an instance of the
sagacity of the natives, for they must have reflected, that by thus
giving timely notice, a greater number will become competitors for
the whale, and that consequently there will be a better chance of
the whale running ashore, in which case a share must fall finally
to them. The fishers whom I saw were fine able fellows; and with
their large ships and courageous struggles with the whales, they
must seem terrible men of the sea to the natives. The neat trim of
their boats, set up on stanchions on the beach, looked well, with
oars and in perfect readiness to dash at a moment's notice, into
the "angry surge". Upon the whole, what with the perils they
undergo, and their incessant labour in boiling the oil, these men
do not earn too cheaply the profits derived from that kind of
speculation. I saw on the shore the wreck of a fine boat, which had
been cut in two by a single stroke of the tail of a whale. The men
were about to cast their net into the sea to procure a supply of
fish for us, when the whale suddenly engaged all hands.</p>

<p>We returned along the shore of the bay, intersecting at its
estuary, the mouth of the little river last crossed, and which, at
the request of Mr. Henty, I have named the Surry. This river enters
Portland Bay in latitude 38&deg; 15' 43" S.; longitude (by my
survey) 141&deg; 58' E. We encamped on the rich grassy land just
beyond, and I occupied for the night, a snug old hut of the
natives.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 31.</i>&mdash;Early this morning Richardson caught a
fine bream, and I had indeed been informed by Messrs. Henty that
these streams abound with this fish. On ascending the highest point
of the hill, immediately behind the estuary of the Surry, and which
I named Mount Clay, I found it consisted of good forest-land, and
that its ramifications extended over as much as three miles. Beyond
it, we descended into the valley of the Fitzroy, and at noon I
ascertained the latitude, where we had before forded it, to be
38&deg; 8' 51" S. The river had risen in the interim a foot and a
half, so that we were obliged to carry the flour across, on the
heads of the men, wading up to the neck.</p>

<p>When we reached the summit of Mount Eckersley, the horizon being
clear, I completed my series of angles on points visible from that
station, by observing the "Julian Island" and Mount Abrupt, two of
great importance in my survey, which were hidden from our sight by
the squally weather, when I was last on this hill. We reached the
camp about sunset, and found all right there, the carts having been
drawn out of the bogs; all the claw chains repaired by the
blacksmith; our hatchets resteeled; and two new shafts made for the
heavy carts. Piper had, during our absence, killed abundance of
kangaroos, and I now rejoiced at his success, on account of the
aboriginal portion of our party, for whose stomachs, being of
savage capacity, quantity was a more important consideration than
quality in the article of food, and we were then living on a very
reduced scale of rations. On my return from such excursions, the
widow and her child frequently gave notice of our approach, long
before we reached the camp; their quick ears seemed sensible of the
sound of horses' feet at an astonishing distance, for in no other
way, could the men account for the notice which Turandurey and her
child, seated at their own fire, were always the first to give, of
my return, sometimes long before our appearance at the camp. Piper
was usually the first to meet me, and assure me of the safety of
the party, as if he had taken care of it during my absence; and I
encouraged his sense of responsibility, by giving him credit for
the security they had enjoyed. A serene evening, lovely in itself,
looked doubly beautiful then, as our hopes of getting home were
inseparable from fine weather, for on this chance our final escape
from the mud and bogs seemed very much to depend. The barometer,
however, indicated rather doubtfully.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 1.</i>&mdash;Heavy rain and fog detained us in the same
camp this morning, and I availed myself of the day for the purpose
of laying down my recent survey. The results satisfied me that the
coast-line on the engraved map was very defective, and indeed the
indentations extended so much deeper into the land, that I still
entertained hopes of finding some important inlet to the eastward,
analogous to that remarkable break of the mountain-chain at Mount
William.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 2.</i>&mdash;We travelled as much in a north-east
direction as the ground permitted, but although I should most
willingly have followed the connecting features whatever their
directions, I could not avoid the passage of various swamps or
boggy soft hollows, in which the carts, and more especially the
boat-carriage, notwithstanding the greatest exertions on the part
of the men, again sank up to the axles. I had proceeded with the
light carts and one heavy cart nearly nine miles, while the
boat-carriage fell at least six miles behind me, the other heavy
carts having also been retarded, from the necessity for yoking
additional teams to the cattle drawing the boats. The weather was
still unsettled, and the continued rains had at length made the
surface so soft, that even to ride over it was in many places
difficult. I had reached some fine forest land on the bank of a
running stream, where the features were bolder, and I hoped to
arrive soon at the good country near the head of the Wannon. I
encamped without much hope that the remainder of the party could
join us that night, and they, in fact, did remain six miles behind.
I had never been more puzzled in my travels, than I was with
respect to the nature of the country before us then. Mount Napier
bore 74&deg; E. of N. distant about 16 miles. The little rivulet
was flowing northward, and yet we had not reached the interior side
of that elevated though swampy ground, dividing the fine vallies we
had seen further westward, from the country sloping towards the
sea.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 3.</i>&mdash;This morning we had steady rain,
accompanied as usual by a north-west wind; I remarked also that at
any rise of the barometer after such rain, the wind changed to the
southeast in situations near the coast, or to the north-east when
we were more inland. I sent back the cattle, we had brought forward
to this camp, to assist those behind, and in the meanwhile, Mr.
Stapylton took a ride along the ridge on which we were encamped, in
order to ascertain its direction. Towards evening Burnett returned
from the carts with the intelligence, that the boat-carriage could
not be got out of the swamps, and that after the men had succeeded
in raising it with levers, and had drawn it some way, it had again
sunk, and thus delayed the carts, but that the latter were at
length coming on, two men having been left behind with the
boat-carriage. Mr. Stapylton returned in the afternoon, having
ascertained that a swamp of upwards of a mile in breadth, and
extending north and south as far as he could see, lay straight
before us, and he had concluded, that the rivulet upon which we
were then encamped, turned into it. Under such circumstances, we
could not hope to be able to travel much further with the boats,
nor even indeed with the carts, unless we found ground with a
firmer surface in the country before us. Ere we could reach the
nearest habitations of civilised men, we had yet to traverse 400
miles of a country intersected by the highest mountains, and
watered by the largest rivers, known in New Holland.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 4.</i>&mdash;Although the boats and their carriage had
been of late a great hindrance to us, I was very unwilling to
abandon such useful appendages to an exploring party, having
already drawn them overland nearly 3000 miles. A promising part of
the coast might still be explored, large rivers were to be crossed,
and we had already found boats useful on such occasions. One,
however, might answer these temporary purposes, since, for the main
object, the exploration of inland seas, they could not possibly be
wanted. We had two, and the outer one, which was both larger and
heavier than the inner, had been shaken so much when suspended
without the thwarts, that she was almost unserviceable in the
water, and very leaky, as we had lately found in exploring the
Glenelg. She had, in fact, all along served as a case for the inner
boat, which could thus be kept distended by the thwarts, and was
consequently in excellent repair, and in every respect the best. I
determined therefore to abandon the outer boat, and shorten the
carriage, so that the fore and hind wheels would be brought two
feet nearer each other. I expected from this arrangement, that
instead of boats retarding the party, this one might thus be drawn
in advance with the light carts. Having directed the alteration to
be made during my intended absence, I set out for Mount Napier, and
soon found the broad swamp before me. After riding up an arm of it
to the left, for a mile and a half, I found it passable, and having
crossed, we proceeded towards the hill by a rather circuitous
route, but over a fine tract of country, although then very soft
under our horses' feet. We next reached a deeper ravine, where the
land on each side was more open, and also firmer, while a small
rivulet flowing through it amongst bushes, was easily crossed, and
we ascended some fine rising ground beyond it. Rich flats then
extended before us, and we arrived at an open grassy valley, where
a beautiful little stream, resembling a river in miniature, was
flowing rapidly. Two very substantial huts shewed that even the
natives had been attracted by the beauty of the spot, and as the
day was showery, I wished to return, if possible, to pass the night
there, for I began to learn that such huts, with a good fire before
them, made very comfortable quarters in bad weather. We had heard
voices in the woods several times this day, but their inhabitants
seemed as timid as kangaroos, and not more likely to come near us.
The blue mass of Mount Napier was visible occasionally through the
trees, but I found as we proceeded, that we were not so near it as
I had supposed, for at three miles beyond the little stream, we
came upon one of greater magnitude, a river flowing southward, with
open grassy banks in which two kinds of trap-rock appeared. The
edge of a thin layer of the lowest, a nearly decomposed trap,
projected over the stream; the other lay in rounded blocks, in the
face of the hill above, and appeared to be decomposed amygdaloid,
principally felspar. The river ran through a valley where the
forest land was remarkably open, being sprinkled with only a few
trees as in a park, and this stream appeared to fall into the head
of the extensive swamp already mentioned. About a mile beyond the
river, (which I named the Shaw,) we came upon the extremities of
Mount Napier, for at least so I considered some rough sharp-pointed
fragments of rock laying about in heaps, which we found it very
difficult and tedious to ride over; indeed so sharp-edged and large
were these rocks on the slopes of the terraces they formed, that we
were often obliged to dismount and lead our horses. In these
fragments I recognised the cellular character of the rocks I had
noticed in the bed of the Shaw. The rock here might have been taken
for decomposed amygdaloid, but having found the vestiges of an old
crater in the summit of the hill, I was induced to consider it an
ancient lava. The reefs at Portland Bay consist of the same rock in
rounded nodules, a more compact traprock consisting principally of
felspar lying above them, as was observable in the section of the
coast. In some of the fragments on Mount Napier, these cells or
pores were several inches in diameter, and, unlike amygdaloidal
rocks, all were quite empty. The surface consisted wholly of this
stone, without any intermediate soil to soften its asperity under
the feet of our horses, and yet it was covered with a wood of
eucalyptus and mimosa, growing there as on the open forest land,
between which and this stony region the chief difference consisted
in the ruggedness of surface, this being broken, as already stated,
into irregular terraces, where loose stones lay in irregular heaps
and hollows, most resembling old stone quarries. We travelled over
three miles of this rough surface, before we reached the base of
the cone. On the sides of it we found some soft red earth mixed
with fragments of lava, and on reaching the summit, I found myself
on the narrow edge of a circular crater, composed wholly of lava
and scoriae. Trees and bushes grew luxuriantly everywhere, except
where the sharp rocks shot up almost perpendicularly. The igneous
character of these was so obvious, that one of the men thrust his
hand into a chasm to ascertain whether it was warm. The discovery
of an extinct volcano gave additional interest to Mount Napier, but
it was by no means a better station for the theodolite on that
account; on the contrary, it was the worst possible, for as the
trees grew on the edge of the crater, no one station could be found
to afford a view of the horizon, until the whole circumference was
cleared of the trees, and this was too great a work for us at that
visit. Mount William and the Grampian range presented a noble
outline of the northward. The sun had set, before I could recognise
distant points in the highly interesting country, to be seen from
this remarkable hill. The weather was also unfavourable, and I
descended to pass the night at its base, in hopes that the next
morning might be clear.</p>

<p>On reaching the spot where I had left the horses, I found that
our native friend, Tommy Came-last, could discover no water in any
of the numerous hollows around the hill, and though the
superabundance of this element had caused the chief impediment to
our progress through the country at that time, we were obliged to
pass a night most uncomfortably from the total want of it, at the
base of Mount Napier. The spongy looking rocks were, however, dry
enough to sleep upon, a quality of which the soil in general had
been rather deficient, as most of us felt in our muscles. I
perceived a remarkable uniformity in the size of the trees, very
few of which were dead or fallen. From this circumstance, together
with the deficiency of the soil and the sharp edge of the rock
generally, some might conclude, that the volcano had been in
activity at no very remote period.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 5.</i>&mdash;A thick fog hung upon the mountain until
half-past 10 A.M., and when I ascended an extremity, I could see
nothing of the distance. I had however ascertained the nature of
the country thus far, this having been the object of my visit, and
as I had resolved from what I had seen, to pass to the northward at
no great distance from this hill, I returned with less reluctance,
in hopes that I might have it in my power yet to revisit it, during
more favourable weather. The day was squally with several very
heavy showers, the wind being from the south-west. We saw two
natives at a fire, when we were returning, and our friend Tommy
readily advanced towards them, but they immediately set up such
loud and incessant cries, that I called to him to come away. After
a ride of twenty-six miles across swamps and many muddy hollows, we
reached, soon after sunset, the camp, which I had directed to be
moved back, to near where the boats lay. I found that these had
been drawn out of the swamp, and one only brought forward as I
wished to this camp, and where I found all the carts once more
ranged together. The alteration of the boat-carriage required a
little more time, and I accordingly determined to halt one day,
that we might also have our horses shod, several shoes having come
off on the rough rocks near Mount Napier.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 6.</i>&mdash;This day I requested Mr. Stapylton to
examine the country in a north-west direction. Some of the swamps
crossed by me yesterday had appeared to fall westward, and I wished
to ascertain the situation and character of the ground dividing
them from those discharging their waters eastward or towards the
sea, as it was only by keeping on that dividing ground, that I
could hope to avoid them. Mr. Stapylton proceeded nine miles
north-west, crossing many swampy flats, and at length a small
rivulet, all falling westward. Beyond the rivulet, he got upon some
good hills connected with higher land. Our best line of route
homewards, was in a north-east direction, or at right angles to the
route of Mr. Stapylton. The great swamp already mentioned, being
the channel and recipient of the Shaw, was somewhat in my way, and
my object now was, to trace out the dividing ground as we
proceeded, so as to avoid the swamps on both sides. By sunset, the
single boat was mounted in the shortened carriage, the whole being
now so manageable and light, that the boat could be lifted out by
hand, without block and tackle; and when on the carriage, she could
be drawn with case wherever the light carts could pass. Thus we got
rid of that heavy clog on our progress over soft ground, "the
boats," by reserving but one; and we left the larger, keel upwards,
at the swamp which had occasioned so much delay.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 7.</i>&mdash;Having chosen for a general line of route,
the bearing most likely to avoid the swamps, according to the
knowledge I had gained of the country, I proceeded as these and the
soft ground permitted, and had the singular, and indeed, unexpected
good fortune to come upon my horse's track from Mount Napier,
without having even seen the large swamp. The boat-carriage now
travelled with the light carts, and we at length reached the first
running stream at a short distance below where I had previously
crossed it. The bottom was boggy, and the water flowed in two
channels, the ground between them being very soft. The whole party
crossed it, with the exception of two carts, which did not arrive,
and we encamped on the bank beyond, after a journey of about eight
miles. Near this stream, we found a pretty new species of
Dillwynia, with plain yellow flowers, clustered on a long stalk at
the end of the branches, and with curiously hairy heath-like
leaves. It resembles D. peduncularis, but proved, on examination,
to be distinct. At this spot, we found a very small bower of twigs,
only large enough to contain a child; the floor was hollowed out,
and filled with dry leaves and feathers; and the ground around had
been cut smooth, several boughs having been also bent over it, so
as to be fixed in the ground at both ends. The whole seemed
connected with some mystic ceremony of the aborigines, but which
the male natives, who were with us, could not explain. The gins,
however, on being questioned, said it was usual to prepare such a
bower for the reception of a new-born child. Kangaroos were more
numerous in this part of the country, than in any other that we had
traversed. I counted twenty-three in one flock, which passed before
me, as I stood silently by a tree. Two of the men counted
fifty-seven in another flock, and it was not unusual for them to
approach our camp, as if from curiosity, on which occasions two or
three were occasionally caught by our dogs.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 8.</i>&mdash;The remainder of the heavy carts not
having come up, I left the two with us, to await their arrival,
that the men might assist the drivers with their teams, in crossing
this stream. On proceeding then with the light carts only, I
crossed several soft bad places, and one or two fine little
rivulets, encamping at last where we again fell in with my horse's
track on an open space, about eight miles from Mount Napier. During
the day's journey, we traversed some fine, open, forest hills near
the banks of rivulets. We generally found the south-eastern slope
of such heights very indistinct, and the ground soft, boggy, and
covered with banksias. The rock in such places consisted of the
same cellular trap, so common on this side of the Grampians. Our
camp lay between two swamps, for no better ground appeared on any
side. I hoped, however, to obtain a more general knowledge of the
surrounding country from Mount Napier, during clear weather, and
thus to discover some way by which we might make our escape to the
northward. The carts did not overtake us this day, and I
determined, when they should arrive, to overhaul them, and throw
away every article of weight, not absolutely required for the rest
of the journey.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 9.</i>&mdash;Once more I set out for Mount Napier,
followed by a party of men with axes to clear its summit, at least
sufficiently for the purpose of taking angles with the theodolite.
The night had been clear, and the morning was fine, but as soon as
I had ascended the hill, rain-clouds gathered in the south-west,
and obscured the horizon on all sides; I could only see some points
at intervals, but I took as many as I could, after the men had
cleared a station for the theodolite. I perceived two very
extensive lakes in the low country between Mount Napier and the
south-eastern portion of the Grampian range, which terminated in
the hill, that I had previously named Mount Abrupt. Between the
largest of these waters (called by me Lake Linlithgow,) and the
mountains, there appeared an extensive tract of open grassy land.
To the eastward, at the distance of twelve miles, I perceived a
solitary hill, somewhat resembling Mount Napier, and named it Mount
Rouse; but a haze still concealed the more distant country. On
reaching the camp, where we arrived in the dark, I found that the
carts had not, even then, returned; but as the barometer promised
better weather, I did not much regret their non-arrival, as the
delay would afford me another chance of having a clear day on Mount
Napier.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 10.</i>&mdash;I again proceeded to the hill, and
obtained, at length, a clear and extensive view from it in all
directions. In the north, the Grampian range, on all sides grand,
presented a new and striking outline on this. Far in the west, I
could recognise in slight breaks, on a low horizon, some features
of the valley of Nangeela (Glenelg). Eastward, the summits of a
range, I thought of naming the Australian Pyrenees, were just
visible over a woody horizon; and to the south-east were several
detached hills, and some elevated ridges of forest-land, apparently
near the coast. One isolated hill, resembling a haystack, was very
remarkable on the seashore. This I named Mount Hotspur, being the
only elevation near Lady Julia Percy's Isle, (not Isles, as laid
down on the charts, for there is but one, now called by whalers the
Julian Island). To the southward, I could just distinguish the
Laurence Islands, but a haze upon the coast prevented me from
seeing that of Lady Julia Percy. Smoke arose from many parts of the
lower country, and shewed that the inhabitants were very generally
scattered over its surface. We could now look on such fires with
indifference, so harmless were these natives, compared with those
on the Darling, and the smoke now ascended in equal abundance from
the furthest verge of the horizon. It was impossible to discover
the sources of streams, or the direction of any ranges visible in
the surrounding country; but upon the whole, I concluded that the
only practicable route for us homewards, at that time, would be
through the forests, and by passing as near as possible to the base
of Mount Abrupt, the south-eastern extremity of the Grampians.
Several forest-hills stood above the extensive level country,
extending from our camp to Mount Abrupt; but I could trace no
connection between these hills, and was rather apprehensive that a
soft and swampy country intervened. I had this day leisure to
examine the crater on this hill more particularly, and found its
breadth to be 446 feet; its average depth 80 feet. The cellular
rocks and lava stood nearly perpendicular around one portion of it;
but there was a gap towards the west-north-west, on which side the
crater was open almost to its greatest depth. Several deep tongues
of land descended from it to the west and north-west, forming the
base of the hill, and had somewhat of the regularity of waterworn
features. No marks of decomposition appeared in the fragments
projecting from the highest points, however much exposed. On the
contrary, all the stringy twisted marks of fusion were as sharp and
fresh, as if the lava had but recently cooled. One species of moss
very much resembled the Orchilla, and I thought it not improbable
that this valuable weed might be found here, as it occurs on
similar rocks at Teneriffe. Just as I reached the highest summit
this morning, a bronzewing pigeon arose from it; a circumstance
rather remarkable, considering that this was the only bird of that
species seen on this side the mountains, besides the one we saw in
Pigeon Ponds, on the 3rd of August. On returning to the camp, I
found that the carts had arrived soon after my departure in the
morning; but the men had the misfortune to lose two bullocks in
crossing the swampy stream where we had been previously encamped.
One was suffocated in the mud, and the other having lain down in
it, could not be made to rise. By observing the stars a and p
Centauri, I ascertained the magnetic variation to be 3&deg; 2' 45"
E., and by the sun's altitude, observed this day at Mount Napier, I
found the latitude of that hill to be 37&deg; 52' 29" S.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 11.</i>&mdash;In order to lighten the carts as much as
possible, I caused the pack-saddles to be placed on the spare
bullocks, and various articles carried upon them; thus lightening,
to less than eight hundred weight each, the loads of two of the
heavy carts, which had narrow wheels and sunk most in the ground.
The old cover of the boat-carriage was also laid aside, and in its
place, some tarpaulins, which had previously added to the loads,
were laid across our remaining boat. A heavy jack used to raise
cart wheels, was also left at this camp, and some iron bars, that
had been taken from the boat-carriage when it was shortened. Thus
lightened, we proceeded once more into the fields of mud, taking a
northerly direction. For several miles, we encountered worse ground
than we had ever crossed before, yet the carts came over it; but
broad swamps still lay before us. Despairing at length of being
able to avoid them, I impatiently galloped my horse into one, and
the carts followed, thanks to my impatience for once, for I do not
think that I could otherwise have discovered that a swamp so
uninviting could possibly have borne my horse, and still less the
carts. After this I ventured to pursue a less circuitous route.
About that time a yellow flower in the grass caught my eye, and
remembering that we had seen none of these golden flowers since we
left the beautiful valley of the Wannon, I ventured to hope, that
we were at length approaching the good country at the head of that
stream. Such was my anxious wish, when I perceived through the
trees a glimpse of an open grassy country, and immediately entered
a fine clear valley with a lively little stream flowing westward
through it, and which I named the Grange. This was indeed one of
the heads of the Wannon, and we had at length reached the good
country. The contrast between it and that from which we had
emerged, was obvious to all; even to the natives, who for the first
time, painted themselves in the evening, and danced a spirited
corrobory on the occasion. This day, Piper had seen two of the
native inhabitants, and had endeavoured to persuade them to come to
me, but all to no purpose, until at length, enraged at the
unreasonable timidity of one of them, he threw his tomahawk at him,
and nearly hit him as he edged off, an act of which, as I told him,
in the strongest terms, I very much disapproved.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 12.</i>&mdash;The course of the little stream being to
the northward, I proceeded along its right bank this morning, until
it turned to the north-west; but we soon after came to another to
which the former seemed to be but a tributary. Its course was
almost due west, and the valley in which it flowed, was deep and
boldly escarped. The stream thundered along with considerable
rapidity over a rocky bottom, consisting of the same sort of trap
or ancient lava. I had little doubt, that this was the principal
head of the Wannon, a river crossed by us on the 11th of August.
Meeting, next, an important branch falling into it from the
south-east, and being obliged to cross this, we effected the
passage, even with the carts, although the horses were nearly
swimming. We proceeded next along a continuous ridge of fine firm
ground covered with excellent grass, and soon after, we saw before
us a smaller stream flowing through a broad grassy vale, and having
crossed it also, without difficulty, we encamped in one of the
valleys beyond, where this tributary appeared to originate. A finer
country could scarcely be imagined; enormous trees of the mimosa or
wattle, of which the bark is so valuable, grew almost every where;
and several new varieties of Caladenia were found to-day. The blue,
yellow, pink, and brown coloured were all observed on these flowery
plains. The sublime peaks of the Grampians began to appear above
the trees to the northward, and two lower hills of trap-rock arose,
one to the southwest, the other north-west of our camp. That to the
northward, I named Mount Bainbrigge, the other on the south, Mount
Pierrepoint.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 13.</i>&mdash;We broke up our camp early this morning,
and on reaching the highest ground we discovered a large lake on
our left; it was nearly circular, about half a mile in
circumference, and surrounded by high firm banks, from which there
was no visible outlet; I named it Lake Nivelle. At a few miles
beyond this lake, the cheering sight of an open country extending
to the horizon, first appeared through the trees; and we soon
entered on these fine downs where the gently undulating surface was
firm under our horses' feet, and thickly clothed with excellent
grass. The cart-wheels trundled merrily along, so that twelve miles
were accomplished soon after mid-day, and we encamped near the
extreme southern point of the Grampians, which I named Mount
Sturgeon. The weather was very wet, but this troubled us the less,
as we had not known a day without rain for several months.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 14.</i>&mdash;I was most anxious to ascend Mount
Abrupt, the first peak to the northwards of Mount Sturgeon, that I
might close my survey of these mountains, and also reconnoitre the
country before us. This morning, clouds hung upon the mountains,
however, and I could scarcely indulge a hope that the weather would
be favourable for the proposed survey; nevertheless I bent my steps
towards the mountains, having first set the carpenter to work to
make an additional width of felloe to the narrow wheels of one of
the carts, that it might pass with less difficulty over soft
ground. We soon came to a deep stream flowing not from, but
apparently towards the mountains; its general course being
westward. It was so deep that our horses could scarcely ford it
without swimming. Reeds grew about, and the bottom was soft 5
although two kinds of rock appeared in its banks. On the right was
trap, on the left the ferruginous sandstone of which all these
mountains consist. We soon entered on the barren and sandy but firm
ground at their base, which, with its peculiar trees and shrubs,
appeared so different from the grassy plains. The banksia, the
casuarina, and the hardy xanthorhaea, reminded us of former toils
on the opposite side of these ranges. The weather turned out better
than I had expected, and from the summit of Mount Abrupt I beheld a
truly sublime scene; the whole of the mountains, quite clear of
clouds, the grand outline of the more distant masses blended with
the sky, and forming a blue and purple background for the numerous
peaks of the range on which I stood, which consisted of sharp cones
and perpendicular cliffs foreshortened, so as to form one grand
feature only of the extensive landscape, though composing a
crescent nearly 30 miles in extent; this range being but a branch
from the still more lofty masses of Mount William, which crowned
the whole. Towards the coast, there was less haze than usual, for I
could distinguish Lady Julia Percy's Isle, which I had looked for
in vain from Mount Napier, a point twenty-four miles nearer to it.
Here I could also trace the course of the stream we had crossed
that morning, from its sources under the eastern base of the
mountains to a group of lower hills twenty-seven miles distant to
the westward; which hills, named by me Dundas group, formed a most
useful point in my trigonometrical survey. Several extensive lakes
appeared in the lowest parts adjacent; but what interested me most,
after I had intersected the various summits, was the appearance of
the country to the eastward, through which we were to find our way
home. There I saw a vast extent of open downs, and could trace
their undulations to where they joined a range of mountains, which,
judging by their outlines, appeared to be of easy access. Our
straightest way homewards passed just under a bluff head about
fifty miles distant, and so far I could easily perceive a most
favourable line of route, by avoiding several large reedy lakes.
Between that open country and these lakes on one side, and the
coast on the other, a low woody ridge extended eastward; and, by
first gaining that, I hoped we should reach the open ground, in a
direction which should enable us to leave all the lakes on our
left.</p>

<p>The largest pieces of water, I could see, were Lake Linlithgow
and its companion in the open grassy plains between the range and
Mount Napier, as previously discovered from that hill. Several
small and very picturesque lakes, then as smooth as mirrors,
adorned the valley immediately to the westward of the hill, I was
upon. They were fringed with luxuriant shrubs, so that it was
really painful to me to hurry, as I was then compelled to do, past
spots like these, involving in their unexplored recesses so much of
novelty amidst the most romantic scenery. The rock consisted of a
finely grained sandstone as in other parts of that mass. The
Grampians of the south consist of three ranges, covering a surface
which extends latitudinally 54 miles, and longitudinally 20 miles.
The extreme eastern and highest summit is Mount William, in height
4,500 feet above the sea. The northern point is Mount Zero, in
latitude 36&deg; 52' 35" S., and the southern point is Mount
Sturgeon, in latitude 37&deg; 38' 00" I here again recognised the
outline of the most northern and elevated range extending from
Mount William to Mount Zero, but it was not so steep on the
southern as on the northern side. From this hill two other ranges
branch off to the south; the western being marked Victoria range on
the map, the eastern, the Serra, from its serrated appearance; the
broken outlines they present being highly ornamental to the fine
country around. On the northern slopes of the range, are some
forests of fine timber, but, in general, the higher summits are
bare and rocky. The chief source of the Glenelg, is between the
Victoria range and the most northern, whence it soon sinks into a
deep glen or ravine, receiving numberless tributaries from other
dells, intersecting the adjacent country. A considerable branch of
the Glenelg, named by the natives the "Wannon", has its sources in
the eastern and southern rivulets from these mountains. The waters
falling northward, enter the "Wimmera", a different river, whose
estuary has not yet been explored. Returning towards the camp, on
approaching the stream, we met with one of the most strikingly
beautiful species of the common genus Pultenaea; its narrow
heathlike leaves were so closely covered with soft silky hairs as
to have quite a silvery appearance, and the branches were loaded
with the heads of yellow and brown flowers now fully open. It
formed a new species of the "Proliferous" section, allied to
Pultenaea stipularis.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 15.</i>&mdash;Pursuing an easterly course in order to
avoid the Wannon, we again found the ground so soft and boggy that
it was impossible to proceed; and after advancing with incredible
labour (under which one of the poor bullocks fell to rise no more),
barely four miles, I ordered the tents to be again set up, but
almost in despair, for having performed during the previous days
several good journeys with perfect freedom from this species of
impediment, and having seen no indication of any change in the
surface, I had assured the men on descending from the mountains,
that the country before us was favourable. We were nevertheless
compelled to halt again at this part by the breaking of the iron
axle of one of the carts, for it was necessary to endeavour to
repair it, before we could proceed. The highest part of the woody
ridge, between us and the plains, bore according to my map due
east, being distant 14 miles.</p>

<p>I gave that bearing to Mr. Stapylton, who rode forward with
Burnett to ascertain how far we were from firmer ground, while I
continued in my tent occupied with the map of the mountains. It was
dark before Mr. Stapylton returned and brought the pleasing
tidings, that the soft ground extended only to three or four miles
from the camp, and that from beyond that distance to the forest
hills, he had found the ground tolerably firm.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 16.</i>&mdash;The country which proved so soft was
nevertheless stony, and trap-rock projected from every higher
portion; yet such rocky eminences being unconnected, each was
surrounded by softer ground. I was resolved to make the very most
of them; but an iron axle having been broken in our struggles with
the mud, the smith required more time to repair it, and I therefore
determined to proceed with but half the equipment drawn by all the
bullocks, leaving Burnett and the remaining portion of the party
and equipment to come on next day by the same means, as soon as the
cattle could be sent back. Having previously examined the ground,
and carefully traced out the hardest parts, connecting these rocky
features, I led the way with the carts, and got through the first
part of the journey much better than any of us had expected. After
passing over four miles of soft boggy ground, we came to a small
running stream, the surface beyond it rising to a somewhat steep
ascent. On reaching that side, I found myself on a good, firm
ridge, along which I continued for some time until we reached a
swampy lagoon, the banks of which were very firm and good. Leaving
this on our right, we at length saw the darkly wooded hills of the
ridge before mentioned; and having travelled eleven miles, we
encamped near a small lagoon, on a spot, where there was excellent
grass; but it was still necessary to send back the poor cattle with
their drivers that evening, to where the other party still remained
encamped.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 17.</i>&mdash;This day the rest of the party came up,
but the cattle seemed quite exhausted. They had at length become so
weak, from the continued heavy dragging through mud, that it was
obvious they could not proceed much further until after they had
enjoyed at least some weeks of repose. But our provisions did not
admit of this delay, as the time had arrived, when I ought to have
been at Sydney, although still so far from it. After mature
deliberation, we hit upon a plan, which might, as I thought, enable
us to escape. The arrangement proposed was, that I should go
forward with some of the freshest of the cattle drawing the light
carts and boat, with a month's provisions, and taking with me as
many men as would enable me to leave with those who should remain,
provisions for two months. That the cattle should rest at the
present camp two weeks and then proceed, while I, by travelling so
far before them with so light a party, could send back a supply of
provisions, and also the boat, to meet this second party following
in my track, on the banks of the Murray. Thus I could reach Sydney
some weeks sooner, and also carry on my survey much more
conveniently; the cattle, which had been sinking almost daily,
would be thus refreshed sufficiently to be able to travel, and the
chance of the whole party suffering from famine would be much
diminished. Such was the outline of the plan, which our position
and necessities suggested.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 18.</i>&mdash;This day was passed, in making
preparations for setting out tomorrow with the light party, as
proposed. The catalogue of the objects of natural history,
collected during the journey, included several birds and animals
not hitherto mentioned in this journal. Amongst the most remarkable
of these was the pig-footed animal, found on June 16. It measured
about ten inches in length, had no tail, and the fore feet
resembled those of a pig. There was also the rat, which climbs
trees like the opossum, the flat-tailed rat from the scrubs of the
Darling, where it builds an enormous nest of branches and boughs,
so interlaced as to be proof against any attacks of the native dog.
The unique specimen from the reedy country on the Murray of a very
singular animal much resembling the jerboa or desert rat of Persia;
also a rat-eared bat from the Lachlan. We had several new birds,
but the most admired of our ornithological discoveries, was a
white-winged superb warbler, from the junction of the Darling and
the Murray, all the plumage not white, being of a bright blue
colour; but of this we had obtained only one specimen. I had not
many opportunities of figuring the birds from life, so very
desirable in ornithological subjects. The eye of the eagle and the
rich crest of the cockatoo of the desert, could not be preserved,
in dead specimens, and were too fine to be omitted among the
sketches, I endeavoured to snatch from nature. Our herbarium had
suffered from the continued wet weather, especially in fording deep
rivers; and this was the more to be regretted, as it contained many
remarkable specimens. The seeds and bulbous roots, comprising
varieties of Calostemma, Caladenia and Anguillaria, besides a
number of large lillaceous bulbs, were however preserved in a very
good state.</p>

<p>The camp in which Mr. Stapylton's party was to remain two weeks,
was in as favourable a place for refreshing the cattle as could be
found. The ground undulated, and was thickly clothed with fresh
verdure. A grassy swamp also, such as cattle delight in, extended
northward into a lake of fresh water, which I named Lake Repose.
The peaks of the 3 Serra Range, and especially Mount Abrupt, were
landmarks which secured the men from even the possibility of losing
their way in looking after the cattle.</p>

<p>Of the natives in our party, it was arranged amongst themselves
that Tommy Came-first, and the widow, who most required a rest,
having sore feet, should remain with Mr. Stapylton, and that Piper
and Tommy Came-last should accompany me.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 19.</i>&mdash;When about to set out I observed that the
widow Turandurey, who was to remain with Mr. Stapylton's party and
the carts, was marked with white round the eyes (the natives'
fashion of mourning), and that the face of her child Ballandella
was whitened also. This poor woman, who had cheerfully carried the
child on her back, when we offered to carry both on the carts, and
who was as careful and affectionate as any mother could be, had at
length determined to entrust to me the care of this Infant. I was
gratified with such a proof of the mother's confidence in us, but I
should have been less willing to take charge of her child, had I
not been aware of the wretched state of slavery to which the native
females are doomed. I felt additional interest in this poor child,
from the circumstance of her having suffered so much by the
accident, that befel her while with our party, and which had not
prevented her from now preferring our mode of living so much, that
I believe the mother at length despaired of being ever able to
initiate her thoroughly in the mysteries of killing and eating
snakes, lizards, rats, and similar food. The widow had been long
enough with us to be sensible, how much more her sex was respected
by civilised men than savages, and, as I conceived, it was with
such sentiments that she committed her child to my charge, under
the immediate care, however, of Piper's gin.</p>

<p>For several miles, we met with soft ground at the low connecting
parts of hills, but we at length gained the woody ridge, so likely,
as I had hoped, to favour our progress. Its turnings were
intricate, but by one or two rivulets falling to my left, and then
by others falling to the right, I learnt how to keep on the
intermediate ground, until, at length, after a journey of nine
miles, we emerged from the woods on a firm open surface, and an
extensive prospect was seen before us. Leaving the party to encamp,
I rode to a round forest-hill some miles to the eastward, and
obtained a comprehensive view of the Grampians, and also of the
country to the northward, which now appeared to be chiefly open;
and I had little doubt that we should find it more favourable for
travelling upon. Eastward of the forest-hill, the ground sank into
a deep valley which turned round to the south-east, after receiving
the drainage from some hollows in the open country north of it.
This ravine received also the waters from the woody ridge now south
of us, where the numerous deep vallies were irrigated by streams
arising in swamps; the whole probably forming the head of some more
important streams flowing to the coast, and which I here named the
river Hopkins. This eminence, which I distinguished as Mount
Stavely, consisted, apparently of decomposed clay-stone or felspar,
having a tendency to divide naturally into regular prisms. A very
beautiful and singular looking shrub appeared on the hills we
crossed this day, and also on the open ground, where indeed it was
most abundant. It was a species of acacia, the leaves adhering
edgeways to thorny branches; many of these shrubs were in blossom,
the flowers being yellow, and as large and round as marbles, and
those growing very thickly, they gave to the branches, the
appearance of garlands of festoons, the effect altogether being
extremely graceful and singular. We found also a beautiful new
species of acacia, looking like a broad-leaved variety of A.
armata. The branches were singularly protected by short spiny
forks, which proved to be the hardened permanent stipules. With
this occurred another species with hard stiff scymetar-shaped
leaves and a profusion of balls of browner yellow flowers, which
had been previously observed (on June 22) in a more vigorous
condition. By observations from this hill I made the height of
Mount William about 4,500 feet above the sea.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 20.</i>&mdash;Our wheels now rolled lightly over fine
grassy downs, and our faces were turned towards distant home.
Before us arose a low, thinly-wooded hill, which at first bounded
our view towards the north, and afterwards proved to be the
feature, connecting the low woody ridge near our last camp with the
hills still further to the northward. On reaching the summit, I
perceived, that a considerable extent of open country intervened,
being watered in the lower parts by several lakes. Descending
northward along an offset of the same hills which had led us in
that direction, and which I now named Mount Nicholson, I observed
that the lakes occurred at intervals in a valley apparently falling
from the westward in which no stream appeared, although it was shut
in by well escarped rocky banks. We encamped, after a journey of
ten miles, at a point where another valley from the north joined
the above, and I was somewhat surprised to find after encamping,
that the water in the adjacent lakes was extremely salt. No
connection existed by means of any channel between them, although
they formed together a chain of lagoons in the bed of a deep and
well defined valley. On the contrary, the soil was particularly
solid and firm between them, and the margin of the most eastern of
these lakes, was separated by a high bank from the bed of another
valley, where a running stream of pure water flowed over a broad
and swampy bed fifteen feet higher than the adjacent valley
containing the stagnant salt lakes. The rocks enclosing these
singular vallies was basalt, and from these peculiarities,
considered with reference to the ancient volcano and the dip of the
mountain strata to the north-west, it was evident that some
upheaving or subsidence had materially altered the levels of the
original surface.</p>

<p>I could find no brine-springs in or about these lakes, and as it
was evident, that a stream had once washed the bed of the ravine
now occupied by them, I may leave the solution of the problem to
geologists. As we proceeded over the open ground, before we reached
the spot where we finally encamped, several natives appeared at a
great distance in a valley eastward of Mount Nicholson, and Piper
went towards them supported by Brown, whom I sent after him on
horseback. They proved to be three or four gins only, but Piper
continued to pursue them to the top of a hill, when a number of men
armed with spears suddenly started from behind trees, and were
running furiously towards Piper, when Brown rode up. On presenting
his pistol they came to a full stop, thereby showing that they had
some idea of firearms, although they refused to answer Piper's
questions or to remain longer. In the evening, four of them
approaching our camp, Piper went forward with Burnett to meet them.
They advanced to the tents apparently without fear, and I obtained
from them the names of various localities. On being questioned
respecting Cadong, they told us, that all these waters ran into it,
and pointed to the south-east, saying that I should by-and-bye see
it. When I found we could obtain no more information, I presented
the most intelligent of them with a tomahawk, on which they went
slowly away, repeatedly turning round towards us and saying
something, which, according to Piper, had reference to their tribe
coming again and dancing a corrobory, a proposal these savage
tribes often make, and which the traveller who knows them well,
will think it better to discourage. These men carried a singular
kind of malga, of a construction different from any Piper had ever
seen. The malga is a weapon usually made in the form of fig. 2,
[Sketch omitted] but that with which these natives were provided
somewhat resembled a pick-axe with one half broken off, being made
so as to be thickest at the angle. The blow of such a formidable
weapon could not be easily parried, from the uncertainty whether it
would be aimed with the thick heavy corner or the sharp point. All
the weapons of this singular race are peculiar, and this one was
not the least remarkable. At dusk, while Woods was looking after
the cattle near the camp, he surprised a native concealed behind a
small bush, who did not make his escape until Woods was within two
yards of him. How many more had been about we could not ascertain,
but next morning we found near the spot, one of the bags usually
carried by gins, and containing the following samples of their
daily food: three snakes, three rats, about 2 lbs. of small fish,
like white bait; cray fish, and a quantity of the small root of the
cichoraceous plant tao, usually found growing on the plains with a
bright yellow flower. There were also in the bag, various bodkins
and colouring stones, and two mogos or stone hatchets. It seemed
that our civility had as usual inspired these savages with a desire
to beat our brains out while asleep, and we were thankful that in
effecting their cowardly designs, they had been once more
unsuccessful.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 21.</i>&mdash;Early in the morning, a tribe of about
forty were seen advancing toward our camp, preceded by the four men
who had been previously there. Having determined, that they should
not approach us again, I made Piper advance to them, and inquire
what they wanted last night behind the bush, pointing at the same
time to the spot. They returned no answer to this question, but
continued to come forward, until I ordered a burning bush to be
waved at them, and when they came to a stand without answering
Piper's question, I ordered a party of our men to charge them,
whereupon they all scampered off. We saw them upon our encamping
ground after we had proceeded about two miles, but they did not
attempt to follow us. Whether they would find a letter which I had
buried there for Mr. Stapylton or not, we could only hope to
discover after that gentleman's return to the colony. It was
understood between us, that where a cross was cut in the turf where
my tent had stood, he would find a note under the centre of the
cross. This I buried, by merely pushing a stick into the earth, and
dropping into the hole thus made, the note twisted up like a cigar.
The letter was written chiefly to caution him about these natives.
Basalt appeared in the sides of the ravine, which contained the
salt-lakes, and, in equal abundance, and of the same quality, in
that which enclosed the living stream, where it lay in blocks
forming small cliffs. Finding, at length, a favourable place for
crossing this stream, we traversed the ravine, and resumed our
direct course towards the southern extremity of a distant range,
named Mammala by the natives; the bluff head previously seen from
Mount Abrupt. We now travelled over a country quite open, slightly
undulating, and well covered with grass. To the westward the noble
outline of the Grampians terminated a view extending over vast
plains, fringed with forests and embellished with lakes. To the
northward appeared other more accessible looking hills, some being
slightly wooded, some green and quite clear to their summits, long
grassy vales and ridges intervening: while to the eastward, the
open plain extended as far as the eye could reach. Our way lay
between distant ranges, which, in that direction, mingled with the
clouds. Thus I had both the low country, which was without timber,
and the well wooded hills, within reach, and might choose either
for our route, according to the state of the ground, weather, etc.
Certainly a land more favourable for colonisation could not be
found. Flocks might be turned out upon its hills, or the plough at
once set to work in the plains. No primeval forests required to be
first rooted out, although there was enough of wood for all
purposes of utility, and as much also for embellishment as even a
painter could wish. One feature peculiar to that country appeared
on these open downs: it consisted of hollows, which being usually
surrounded by a line of "yarra" gum trees, or white bark
eucalyptus, seemed at a distance to contain lakes, but instead of
water, I found only blocks of vesicular trap, consisting
appearently of granular felspar, and hornblende rock also appeared
in the banks enclosing them. Some of these hollows were of a
winding character, as if they were the remains of ancient
watercourses; but if ever currents flowed there, the surface must
have undergone considerable alteration since, for the downs where
these hollows appeared, were elevated at least 900 feet above the
sea, and surrounded on all sides by lower ground. There was an
appearance of moisture among the rocks, in some of these
depressions; and whether, by digging a few feet, permanent wells
might be made, may be a question worth attention when colonisation
extends to that country. We found on other parts of this open
ground, large blocks composed of irregular concretions of
ironstone, covered with a thin coating of compact brown h&aelig;matite.
The purple-ringed <i>Anguillaria dioica</i>, first seen on Pyramid
Hill, again appeared here; and in many places the ground was quite
yellow with the flowers of the cichoraceous plant Tao, whose root,
small as it is, constitutes the food of the native women and
children. The cattle are very fond of the leaves of this plant, and
seemed to thrive upon it. We also found a new bulbine with a
delicate yellow flower, being perfectly distinct from both the
species described by Brown. The genial warmth of spring had begun
to shew its influence on these plants, and also brought the snakes
from their holes, for on this day in particular, it was ascertained
that twenty-two had been killed by the party. These were all of
that species, not venomous I believe, which the natives eat. We
encamped near a small clump of trees, for the sake of
fire-wood.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 22.</i>&mdash;This day's journey lay chiefly across the
open downs, with wooded hills occasionally to the left. On the
southward, these downs extended to the horizon; and several
isolated hills at great distances, apparently of trap, presented an
outline like the volcanic Mount Napier. All the various small
rivulets we traversed in our line of route, seemed to flow in that
direction. Having crossed three of these, we encamped on the right
bank of the fourth. The hills (in our left were of granite, and as
different as possible in appearance from the mountains to the
westward, which were all of red sandstone. In the afternoon there
was a thunder storm, but the sky became again perfectly serene in
the evening.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 23.</i>&mdash;This morning a thick fog hung over us;
but having well reconnoitred the country beyond, I knew that I
might travel in a straight line, over open ground, for several
miles. When the fog arose, some finely wooded hills appeared on our
right; but after advancing seven miles on good firm earth, we again
came upon very soft ground, which obliged us to turn, and wind, and
pick our way, wherever the surface seemed most likely to bear us.
The fog was succeeded by a fine warm day, and as we proceeded, we
saw two gins and their children, at work separately, on a swampy
meadow; and, quick as the sight of these natives is, we had
travelled long within view, before they observed us. They were
spread over the field much in the manner in which emus and
kangaroos feed on plains, and we observed them digging in the
ground for roots. All carried bags, and when Piper went towards
them, they ran with great speed across the vast open plains to the
southward. This day we perceived the fresh track of several
bullocks, a very extraordinary circumstance in that situation. The
beautiful yellow-wreathed acacia was not to be seen after we
quitted the open country. The ground was becoming almost hopelessly
soft, when we reached a small run of water from the hills, and by
keeping along its bank, we had the good fortune to reach an
extremity of the range, where the solid granite was as welcome to
our feet, as a dry beach is to shipwrecked seamen.</p>

<p>We had at length arrived under Mammala, the bluff hill which had
been my land-mark, from the time I left Mr. Stapylton. I found this
was the southern extremity of a lofty range, which I lost no time
in ascending, after I had fixed on a spot for the camp. It
consisted of huge blocks of granite, and was crowned with such
lofty timber, that I could only catch occasional peeps of the
surrounding country; nevertheless, I obtained, by moving about
among the trees with my pocket sextant, almost all the angles I
wanted; and I thus connected the survey of the region I was
leaving, with that I was about to enter. My first view over this
eastern country was extensive, and when I at length descended to a
projecting rock, I found the prospect extremely promising, the land
being variegated with open plains and strips of forest, and studded
with smooth green hills, of the most beautiful forms. In the
extreme distance, a range, much resembling that on which I stood,
declined at its southern extremity, in the same manner as this did,
and thus left me a passage precisely in the most direct line of
route homewards. The carts had still, however, to cross the range
at which we had arrived, and which, as I perceived here, not only
extended southward, but also broke into bold ravines on the eastern
side, being connected with some noble hills, or rather mountains,
all grassy to their summits, thinly wooded, and consisting wholly
of granite. They resembled very much some hills of the lower
Pyrenees, in Spain, only that they were more grassy and less
acclivitous, and I named this hill Mount Cole. To the southward,
the sea-haze dimmed the horizon: but I perceived the eastern margin
of a large piece of water bearing south-south-east, and which I
supposed might be Cadong. It was sheltered on the south-east by
elevated ground apparently very distant, but no high range appeared
between us and that inlet of the sea. On the contrary, the heights
extending southward from this summit being connected with the
highest and most southern hills visible from it, seemed to be the
only high land or separation of the waters falling north and south.
With such a country before us, I bade adieu to swamps, and returned
well pleased to the camp, being guided to it only by the gushing
torrent, for I had remained on the hill as long as daylight
lasted.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 24.</i>&mdash;The morning was rainy, and our way having
to be traced up the ravines and round the hills, was very tortuous
for the first three miles. We then reached the dividing part of the
range, and descended immediately after into vallies of a less
intricate character. Having passed over the swampy bed of a rivulet
flowing southward, and having also crossed several fine bold ridges
with good streams between them, we at length encamped near a round
hill, which, being clear on the summit, was therefore a favourable
station for the theodolite. This hill also consisted of granite,
and commanded an open and extensive view over the country to the
eastward.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 25.</i>&mdash;One bold range of forest land appeared
before us, and after crossing it, we passed over several rivulets
falling northward, then over a ridge of trapean conglomerate with
embedded quartz pebbles, and descended into a valley of the finest
description. Grassy hills clear of timber appeared beyond a stream
also flowing northward. These hills consisted of old vesicular
lava. We next entered a forest of very large trees of iron bark
eucalyptus, and we finally encamped in a grassy valley in the midst
of this forest.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 26.</i>&mdash;We first crossed more hills of the
trapean conglomerate, on which grew iron-bark eucalypti, and box.
The rock consisted of a base of compact felspar, with embedded
grains of quartz, giving to some parts the character of
conglomerate, and there were also embedded crystals of common
felspar. By diverging a little to the right, we entered upon an
open tract of the most favourable aspect, stretching away to the
south-west among similar hills, until they were lost in the extreme
distance. The whole surface was green as an emerald, and on our
right for some miles ran a fine rivulet between steep grassy banks,
and over a bed of trap-rock. At length, this stream was joined by
two others coming through similar grassy vallies from the south;
and, when we approached two lofty, smooth, round hills, green to
their summits, the united streams flowed in an open dell, which our
carts rolled through without meeting any impediment. I ascended the
most western of these hills, as it was a point which I had observed
from various distant stations, and I enjoyed such a charming view
eastward from the summit, as can but seldom fall to the lot of the
explorers of new countries. The surface presented the forms of
pristine beauty, clothed in the hues of spring; and the shining
verdure of these smooth and symmetrical hills, was relieved by the
darker hues of the wood with which they were interlaced; which
exhibited every variety of tint, from a dark brown in the
fore-ground, to a light blue in extreme distance. The hills
consisted entirely of lava, and I named them, from their peculiar
shape, the Mammeloid hills, and the station on which I stood, Mount
Greenock. In travelling through this Eden, no road was necessary,
nor any ingenuity in conducting wheel-carriages, wherever we chose.
The beautiful little terrestrial orchidaceous plants, Caladenia
dilatata and Diuris aurea, were already in full bloom; and we also
found on the plains this day, a most curious little bush resembling
a heath in foliage, but with solitary polypetalous flowers
resembling those of Sollya. When we had completed fourteen miles,
we encamped on the edge of an open plain and near a small rivulet,
the opposite bank consisting of grassy forest land.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 27.</i>&mdash;I was surprised to hear the voice of a
Scotch-woman in the camp, this morning. The peculiar accent and
rapid utterance could not be mistaken, as I thought, and I called
to inquire who the stranger was, when I ascertained that it was
only Tommy Came-last, who was imitating a Scotch female, who, as I
then learnt, was at Portland Bay, and had been very kind to Tommy.
The imitation was ridiculously true, through all the modulations of
that peculiar accent, although, strange to say, without the
pronunciation of a single intelligible word. The talent of the
aborigines for imitation seems a peculiar trait in their character.
I was informed that the widow could also amuse the men
occasionally&mdash;by enacting their leader, taking angles, drawing
from nature, etc.</p>

<p>While the party went forward over the open plains with Mr.
Stapylton, I ascended a smooth round hill, distant about a mile to
the southward of our camp, from which I could with case continue my
survey, by means of hills on all sides, the highest of them being
to the southward. I could trace the rivulets flowing northward,
into one or two principal channels, near several masses of
mountain; these channels and ranges being probably connected with
those crossed by us on our route from the Murray. In these bare
hills, and on the open grassy plains, old vesicular lava abounded;
small loose elongated fragments lay on the round hills, having a
red scorified appearance, and being also so cellular, as to be
nearly as light as pumice. We this day crossed several fine running
streams, and forests of box and blue-gum growing on ridges of
trapean conglomerate. At length, we entered on a very level and
extensive flat, exceedingly green, and resembling an English park.
It was bounded on the east by a small river flowing to the
northwest, (probably the Loddon,) and abrupt but grassy slopes
arose beyond its right bank. After crossing this stream, we
encamped, having travelled nearly fifteen miles in one straight
line, bearing 60&frac12;&deg; east of north. This tract was rather of a
different character from that of the fine country of which we had
previously seen so much, and we saw for the first time, the
Discaria Australia, a remarkable green leafless spiny bush and
resembling in a most striking manner the Colletias of 'Chili.
Sheltered on every side by woods or higher ground, the spring
seemed more advanced there than elsewhere, and our hard wrought
cattle well deserved to be the first to browse on that verdant
plain. The stream, in its course downwards, vanished amongst grassy
hills to water a country apparently of the most interesting and
valuable character.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 28.</i>&mdash;The steep banks beyond the river
consisted of clay-slate, having under it a conglomerate, containing
fragments of quartz cemented by compact haematite. The day was hot,
and we killed several large snakes of the species eaten by the
natives. I observed that our guides looked at the colour of the
belly, when in any doubt about the sort they preferred; these were
white bellied; whereas the belly of a very fierce one with a large
head, of which Piper and the others seemed much afraid, was yellow.
On cutting this snake open, two young quails were found within; one
of them not being quite dead. The country we crossed during the
early part of the day, was at least as fine as that we had left. We
passed alternately through strips of forest and over open flats
well watered-the streams flowing southward; and at nine miles we
crossed a large stream also flowing in that direction: all these
being evidently tributaries to that on which we had been encamped.
Beyond the greater stream, where we last crossed it, the country
presented more of the mountain character, but good strong grass
grew among the trees, which consisted of box and lofty blue-gum.
After making out upwards of eleven miles, we encamped in a valley
where water lodged in holes, and where we found also abundance of
grass. We were fast approaching those summits which had guided me
in my route from Mount Cole, then more than fifty miles behind us.
Like that mountain these heights also belonged to a lofty range,
and, like it, were beside a very low part of it, through which I
hoped to effect a passage. Leaving the party to encamp, I proceeded
forward in search of the hill I had so long seen before me, and I
found that the hills immediately beyond our camp were part of the
dividing range, and broken into deep ravines on the eastern side.
Pursuing the connection between them and the still higher summits
on the north-east, I came at length upon an open valley enclosed by
hills very lightly wooded. This change was evidently owing to a
difference in the rock, which was a fine grained granite, whereas
the hills we had recently crossed, belonged chiefly to the volcanic
class of rocks, with the exception of the range I had traversed
that evening in my way from the camp, which consisted of
ferruginous sandstone. With the change of rock, a difference was
also obvious in the shape of the hills, the quantity and quality of
the water, and the character of the trees. The hills presented a
bold sweeping outline, and were no longer broken by sharp-edged
strata, but crowned with large round masses of rock. Running water
was gushing from every hollow in much greater abundance than
elsewhere; and, lastly, the timber, which on the other ranges,
consisted chiefly of iron-bark and stringybark, now presented the
shining bark of the blue-gum or yarra, and the grey hue of the box.
The anthistiria australia, a grass which seems to delight in a
granitic soil, also appeared in great abundance, and we also found
the aromatic tea, Tasmania aromatica, which represents in New
Holland, the Winter's bark of the southern extremity of South
America. The leaves and bark of this tree have a hot biting
cinnamon-like taste, on which account it is vulgarly called the
pepper-tree. I could ride with ease to the summit of the friendly
hill, that I had seen from afar, and found it but thinly wooded, so
that I could take my angles around the horizon without difficulty.
Again reminded by the similar aspect this region presented, of the
lower Pyrenees and the pass of Orbaicetta, I named the summit Mount
Byng. A country fully as promising as the fine region we had left,
was embraced in my view from that point. I perceived long patches
of open plains, interspersed with forest hills and low woody
ranges, among which I could trace out a good line of route for
another fifty miles homewards. The highest of the mountains lay to
the south, and evidently belonged to the coast range, if it might
be so called; and on that side, a lofty mass arose above the rest,
and promised a view towards the sea; that height being distant from
the hill on which I stood, about thirty miles. A broad chain of
woody hills connected the coast range with Mount Byng, and I could
trace the general course of several important streams through the
country to the east of it. Northward, I saw a little of the
interior plains, and the points where the various ranges terminated
upon them. The sun was setting, when I left Mount Byng, but I
depended on one of our natives, Tommy-Came-last, who was then with
me, for finding our way to the camp; and who, on such occasions,
could trace my steps backwards, with wonderful facility by day or
night.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 29.</i>&mdash;The range before us was certainly rather
formidable for the passage of carts, but home lay beyond it, while
delay and famine were synonymous terms with us at that time. By
following up the valley in which we had encamped, I found, early on
this morning, an easy way through which the carts might gain the
lowest part of the range. Having conducted them to this point
without any other inconvenience besides the overturning of one cart
(from bad driving), we descended along the hollow of a ravine,
after making it passable by throwing some rocks into the narrow
part near its head. The ravine at length opened, as I had expected,
into a grassy valley, with a fine rivulet flowing through it, and
from this valley we debouched into the still more open granitic
country at the foot of Mount Byng. The pass, thus auspiciously
discovered and opened, over a neck apparently the very lowest of
the whole range, I named Expedition-pass, confident that such a
line of communication between the southern coast and Sydney, must,
in the course of time, become a very considerable thoroughfare. The
change of soil, however, introduced us to the old difficulty from
which we had been happily relieved for some time, for we came once
more upon rotten and boggy ground. We met with this unexpected
impediment in an open-looking flat, near a rivulet I was about to
cross, when I found the surface so extremely soft and yielding,
that from the extreme resistance, a bolt of the boat-carriage gave
way, a circumstance which obliged us immediately to encamp,
although we had travelled only four miles.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 30.</i>&mdash;Compelled thus to await the repair of the
boat-carriage, I determined to make an excursion to the lofty
mountain mass, which appeared about thirty miles to the southward,
in order that I might connect my survey with Port Phillip, which I
hoped to see thence. The horses were not found as soon as they were
required, but when we at last got upon their backs, we were
therefore less disposed to spare them. We crossed some soft hollows
during the first few miles, and then arrived on the banks of a
small and deep river with reeds on its borders, and containing many
broad and deep reaches. It was full, and flowed, but not rapidly,
towards the north-east, and it was not until we had continued along
the left bank of this stream for a considerable way upwards, that
we found a rapid, where we could cross without swimming. The left
bank was of bold acclivity, but grassy and clear of timber, being
very level on the summit; and I found it consisted of trap-rock of
the same vesicular character, which I had observed in so many other
parts of this southern region. Beyond the river (which I then named
the Barnard), we first encountered a hilly country from which we
emerged rather unexpectedly; for, after crossing a small rivulet
flowing in a deep and grassy dell, where trap-rock again appeared,
and ascending the opposite slope, we found that the summit
consisted of an open level country of the finest description. It
was covered with the best kind of grass, and the immediate object
of our ride, the mountain, was now visible beyond these rich
plains. Some fine forest-hills arose in various directions to the
right and left, and indeed I never saw a more pleasing or promising
portion of territory. The rich open ground, across which we rode,
was not without slight undulations; and when we had traversed about
four miles of it, we came quite unawares to a full and flowing
stream, nearly on a level with its grassy banks; the bottom being
so sound, that we forded it without the least difficulty. Emus were
very numerous on the downs, and their curiosity brought them to
stare at our horses, apparently unconscious of the presence of the
biped on their backs, whom both birds and beasts seem instinctly to
avoid. In one flock, I counted twenty-nine emus, and so near did
they come to us, that having no rifle with me, I was tempted to
discharge even my pistol at one, although without effect. Kangaroos
were equally numerous. Having proceeded three miles beyond the
stream, we came to another, flowing to the westward between some
very deep ponds, and it was probably a tributary to the first. At
twenty-two miles from the camp, on descending from some finely
undulating open ground, we arrived at a stream flowing westward,
which I judged to be also a branch of that we had first crossed.
Its bed consisted of granitic rocks, and on the left bank I found
trap. We had this stream afterwards in sight on our left until, at
two miles further, we again crossed it and entered a wood of
eucalyptus, being then only five miles distant from the mountain,
and we subsequently found, that this wood extended to its base. The
effects of some violent hurricane from the north were visible under
every tree, the earth being covered with broken branches, some of
which were more than a foot in diameter; the withering leaves
remained upon them, and I remarked that no whole trees had been
blown down, although almost all had lost their principal limbs, and
not a few had been reduced to bare poles. The havoc which the storm
had made, gave an unusual aspect to the whole of the forest land,
so universally was it covered with withering branches. Whether this
region is subject to frequent visitations of a like nature, I could
not of course then ascertain; but I perceived that many of the
trees had lost some of their top limbs at a much earlier period, in
a similar manner. Neither had this been but a partial tempest, for
to the very base of the mountain the same effects were visible. The
trees on its side were of a much grander character than those in
the forest, and consisted principally of black-butt and blue-gum
eucalypti, measuring from six to eight feet in diameter. The rock
was syenite, so weathered as to resemble sandstone, I ascended
without having been obliged to alight from my horse, and I found
that the summit was very spacious, being covered towards the south
with tree-ferns, and the musk-plant grew in great luxuriance. I saw
also many other plants found at the Illawarra, on the eastern coast
of the colony of New South Wales. The summit was full of wombat
holes, and, unlike that side by which I had ascended, it was
covered with the dead trunks of enormous trees in all stages of
decay. I had two important objects in view in ascending this hill;
one being to determine its position trigonometrically, as a point
likely to be seen from the country to which I was going, where it
might be useful to me in fixing other points; the other being to
obtain a view of Port Phillip, and thus to connect my survey with
that harbour. But the tree-fern, musk-plant, brush, and lofty
timber, together shut us up for a long time from any prospect of
the low country to the southward, and it was not until I had nearly
exhausted a fine sunny afternoon in wandering round the broad
summit, that I could distinguish and recognise some of the hills to
the westward; and when I at length obtained a glimpse of the
country towards the coast, the features of the earth could scarcely
be distinguished from the sky or sea, although one dark point
looked more like a cape than a cloud, and seemed to remain steady.
With my glass, I perceived that water lay inside of that cape, and
that low plains extended northward from the water. I next
discovered a hilly point outside of the cape or towards the sea;
and on descending the hill to where the trees grew less thickly, I
obtained an uninterrupted view of the whole piece of water. As the
sun went down, the distant horizon became clearer towards the
coast, and I intersected at length the two capes; also one at the
head of the bay, and several detached hills. I perceived distinctly
the course of the Exe and Arundell rivers, and a line of mangrove
trees along the low shore. In short, I at length recognised Port
Phillip and the intervening country around it, at a distance
afterwards ascertained to be upwards of fifty miles from Indented
Head, which proved to be the first cape I had seen; that outside
being Point Nepean, on the east side of the entrance to this bay.
At that vast distance, I could trace no signs of life about this
harbour. No stockyards, cattle, or even smoke, although at the
highest northern point of the bay, I saw a mass of white objects
which might have been either tents or vessels. I perceived a white
speck, which I took for breakers or white sand, on the projecting
point of the north-eastern shore. On that day nine years exactly, I
first beheld the heads of Port Jackson, a rather singular
coincidence. Thus the mountain on which I stood, became an
important point in my survey, and I gave it the name of Mount
Macedon, with reference to that of Port Phillip. It had been long
dark before I reached the base of the mountain, and picked out a
dry bit of turf, on which to lie down for the night.</p>

</p>

<p>In May, 1844, Captain Grey, the Governor of South Australia,
received a private letter from Lord Stanley, referring to a
despatch his Lordship had already written to him, to authorise the
fitting out of an expedition to proceed under my command into the
interior. This despatch, however, did not come to hand until the
end of June, but on the receipt of it Captain Grey empowered me to
organise an expedition, on the modified plan on which Lord Stanley
had determined....</p>

<p>I decided on our final departure from Adelaide on the 15th of
the month; for having received my instructions I should then have
nothing further to detain me. That day, therefore, was fixed upon
as the day on which we should start to overtake the party on its
road to Moorundi. The sun rose bright and clear over my home on the
morning of that day. It was indeed a morning such as is only known
in a southern climate; but I had to bid adieu to my wife and
family, and could but feebly enter into the harmony of Nature, as
everything seemed joyous around me....</p>

<p>We reached the Darling [on September 24th] at half-past five, as
the sun's almost level beams were illuminating the flats, and every
blade of grass and every reed appeared of that light and brilliant
green which they assume when held up to the light. The change from
barrenness and sterility to richness and verdure was sudden and
striking, and nothing certainly could have been more cheering or
cheerful than our first camp on the Darling River. The scene itself
was very pretty. Beautiful and drooping trees shaded its banks, and
the grass in its channel was green to the water's edge. Evening's
mildest radiance seemed to linger on a scene so fair, and there was
a mellow haze in the distance that softened every object. The
cattle and horses were up to their flanks in grass and young reeds,
and plants indicative of a better soil, such as the sowthistle, the
mallow, peppermint, and indigofera were growing in profusion around
us. Close to our tents there was a large and hollow gum-tree, in
which a new fishing net had been deposited, but where the owner
intended to use it was a puzzle to us, for it was impossible that
any fish could remain in the shallow and muddy waters of the
Darling; which was at its lowest ebb, and the current was so feeble
that I doubted if it really flowed at all. Whether the natives
anticipated the flood which shortly afterwards swelled it I cannot
say, although I am led to believe they did, either from habit or
experience....</p>

<p>We commenced our journey up the Darling at nine o'clock, on a
course somewhat to the westward {<i>eastward</i> in published text}
of north. We passed flat after flat of the most vivid green,
ornamented by clumps of trees, sufficiently apart to give a most
picturesque finish to the landscape. Trees of denser foliage and
deeper shade dropped over the river, forming long dark avenues, and
the banks of the river, grassed to the water, had the appearance of
having been made so by art.</p>

<p>We halted, after a journey of fourteen miles, on a flat little
inferior to that we had left, and again turned the cattle out to
feed on the luxuriant herbage around them.</p>

<p>The Darling must have been in the state in which we found it for
a great length of time, and I am led to infer, from the very grassy
nature of its bed, that it seldoms contains water to any depth, or
length of time, since in such case the grass would be killed. Its
flats, like those of the Murray, are backed by lagoons, but they
had long been dry, and the trees growing round them were either
dead or dying....</p>

<p>The position we had taken up was a very favourable one, since
being on the right or northern bank of the creek, we were, by the
flooding of the lake, cut off from the Darling natives. I now
therefore determined on making an excursion into the interior to
the N.W., to examine the ranges seen by Mr. Poole, and to ascertain
if, as he supposed, there was a body of water to the westward of
them....</p>

<p>The principal object I had in view during the excursion I was
then employed upon, was if possible to find a proper position to
which the party might move; for I foresaw that my absence would be
frequent and uncertain, and although my men were very well disposed
towards the natives, I was anxious to prevent the chance of
collision or misunderstanding. I had now found such a position, for
on examining the water-hole I felt satisfied that it might be
depended upon for ten days or a fortnight, whilst the grass in its
neighbourhood although dry was abundant. Wishing, however, to
penetrate the ranges by the gap through which the creek issued from
them, I still thought it advisable to prosecute my intended journey
up it. Accordingly on the 24th we mounted our horses and rode
towards the hills. A little above where we had slept we passed a
small junction from the westward, and at 7 miles entered the gap,
the Coonbaralba, on the bearing of which we had run across the
plains, being on our right. We had already passed several small
water-holes, but at the entrance of the gap passed some larger ones
in which the water was brackish, and these had the appearance of
being permanent. Topar had shewn much indignation at our going on,
and constantly remonstrated with us as we were riding along;
however, we saw two young native dogs about a third grown, after
which he bounded with incredible swiftness, but when they saw him
they started off also. It was soon evident, that both were doomed
to destruction, his speed being greater that that of the young
brutes, for he rapidly gained upon them. The moment he got within
reach of the hindmost he threw a stick which he had seized while
running, with unerring precision, and striking it full in the ribs
stretched it on the ground. As he passed the animal he gave it a
blow on the head with another stick, and bounding on after the
other was soon out of our sight. All we knew further of the chase,
was, that before we reached the spot where his first prize lay, he
was returning to us with its companion. As soon as he had secured
his prey he sat down to take out their entrails, a point in which
the natives are very particular. He was careful in securing the
little fat they had about the kidneys, with which he rubbed his
body all over, and having finished this operation he filled their
insides with grass and secured them with skewers. This done he put
them on the cart, and we proceeded up the pass, at the head of
which we arrived sooner than I expected. We then found ourselves at
the commencement of a large plain. The hills we had ascended the
day before trended to the north, and there was a small detached
range running perpendicular to them on our right. To the south
there were different points, apparently the terminations of
parallel ranges, and westward an unbroken line of hills. The creek
seemed to trend to the S.W., and in that direction I determined to
follow it, but Topar earnestly entreated us not to do so. He was in
great consternation; said here was no water, and promised that if
we would follow him he would shew us water in which we could swim.
On this condition I turned as he desired, and keeping along the
western base of the main or front range, took up a course somewhat
obtuse to that by which I had crossed the plains of Cawndilla. The
productions on the ground were of a salsolaceous kind, although it
was so much elevated above the plains, but amongst them there was
not any mesembryanthemum. At about three miles we passed a very
remarkable and perfectly isolated hill, of about 150 feet in
height. It ran longitudinally from south to north for about 350
yards, and was bare of trees or shrubs, with the exception of one
or two casuarinas. The basis of this hill was a slaty ferruginous
rock, and protruding above the ground along the spine of the hill
there was a line of the finest hepatic iron ore I ever saw; it laid
in blocks of various sizes, and of many tons weight piled one upon
the other, without a particle of earth either on their faces or
between them. Nothing indeed could exceed the clean appearance of
these huge masses. On ascending this hill and seating myself on the
top of one of them to take bearings, I found that the compass
deviated 37 degrees from the north point, nor could I place any
dependance on the angles I here took.</p>

<p>At about nine miles the main range turned to the N.N.E., and
Topar accordingly keeping near its base changed his course, and at
five miles more led us into a pass in some respects similar to that
by which we had entered the range. It was however less confined and
more open. Steep hills, with rocks in slabs protruding from many
parts, flanked it to the south, whilst on its northern side
perpendicular rocks, varying in height from 15 to 20 feet, over
which the hills rose almost as perpendicularly more than 200 feet
higher, were to be seen. Close under these was the stony bed of a
mountain torrent, but it was also evident that the whole pass,
about 160 yards broad, was sometimes covered by floods. Down this
gully Topar now led us, and at a short distance, crossing over to
its northern side, he stopped at a little green puddle of water
that was not more than three inches deep. Its surface was covered
with slime and filth, and our horses altogether rejected it. Some
natives had recently been at the place, but none were there when we
arrived. I was exceedingly provoked at Topar's treachery, and have
always been at a loss to account for it. At the time, both Mr.
Browne and myself attributed it to the machinations of our friend
Nadbuck; but his alarm at invading the hilly country was too
genuine to have been counterfeited. It might have been that Nadbuck
and Toonda expected that they would benefit more by our presents
and provisions than if we left them for the interior, and therefore
tried by every means to deter us from going: they certainly had
long conversations with Topar before he left the camp to accompany
us. Still I may do injustice to them in this respect. However,
whether this was the case or not, we had to suffer from Topar's
misconduct. I turned out of the pass, and stopped a little beyond
it, in a more sheltered situation. Here Topar coolly cooked his
dogs, and wholly demolished one of them and part of the other. In
wandering about the gorge of the glen, Mr. Browne found a native
well, but there was no water in it.</p>

<p>Our camp at Cawndilla now bore S.S.E. from us, distant 70 odd
miles, and having determined on moving the party, I resolved to
make the best of my way back to it. On the following morning,
therefore, we again entered the pass, but as it trended too much to
the eastward, I crossed a small range and descended at once upon
the plains leading to the camp. At about 17 miles from the hills,
Topar led us to a broad sheet of water that must have been left by
the recent rains. It was still tolerably full, and water may
perhaps be found here when there is none in more likely places in
the hills. This spot Topar called Wancookaroo; it was unfortunately
in a hollow from whence we could take no bearings to fix its
precise position.</p>

<p>We halted at sunset on the top of a small eminence, from which
the hills Mr. Poole had ascended bore E.N.E., and the hill at the
pass N.W. We were suddenly roused from our slumbers a little before
daylight by a squall of wind that carried away every light thing
about us, hats, caps, etc. all went together, and bushes of
atriplex also went bounding along like so many foot-balls. The wind
became piercing cold, and all comfort was gone. As morning dawned
the wind increased, and as the sun rose it settled into a steady
gale. We were here about forty miles from Cawndilla, nor do I
remember having ever suffered so severely from cold even in Canada.
The wind fairly blew through and through us, and Topar shivered so
under it that Morgan gave him a coat to put on. As we seldom put
our horses out of a walk, we did not reach the tents until late in
the afternoon, but I never was more rejoiced to creep under shelter
than on this occasion....</p>

<p>Fully satisfied then that the greatest obstacle to the progress
of the Expedition would be the want of water, and that it would
only be by long and laborious search that we should succeed in
gaining the interior, I determined on taking as much as I could on
my proposed journey, and with a view to gaining more time for
examining the country, I had a tank constructed, which I purposed
to send a day or two in advance.</p>

<p>The little pond of which I have spoken at the head of the pass,
had near it a beautiful clump of acacias of a species entirely new
to us. It was a pretty graceful tree, and threw a deep shade on the
ground; but with the exception of these and a few gum-trees the
vicinity was clear and open. Our position in the creek on the
contrary was close and confined. Heavy gusts of wind were
constantly sweeping the valley, and filling the air with sand, and
the flies were so numerous and troublesome that they were a
preventative to all work. I determined, therefore, before Mr.
Browne and I should start for the interior, to remove the camp to
the upper part of the glen. On the 4th we struck our tents and
again pitched them close to the acacias. Early on the morning of
the 5th, I sent Flood with Lewis and Sullivan, having the cart full
of water, to preserve a certain course until I should overtake
them, being myself detained in camp with Mr. Browne, in consequence
of the arrival of several natives from whom we hoped to glean some
information; but in this we were disappointed. Toonda had continued
with us as far as "Parnari"; but on our moving up higher into the
hills, his heart failed him, and he returned to Cawndilla.</p>

<p>At eleven, Mr. Browne and I took leave of Mr. Poole, and
pursuing a course of 140 degrees to the west of south, rode on to
overtake the cart. At about four miles from the camp we crossed a
small ironstone range, from which we saw Flood and his party nearly
at the foot of the hill on which I had directed him to move, and at
which I intended to cross the ranges if the place was favourable.
In this, however, we were disappointed, for the hills were too
rugged, although of no great breadth or height. We were
consequently obliged to turn to the south, and in going over the
rough uneven ground, had the misfortune to burst our tank. I
therefore desired Lewis to stop, and gave the horses as much water
as they would drink, still leaving a considerable quantity in the
tank, of which I hoped we might yet avail ourselves. Although we
had found it impracticable to cross the ranges at the proposed
point, Mr. Browne and I had managed to scramble up the most
elevated part of them. We appeared still to be amidst broken stony
hills, from which there was no visible outlet. There was a line of
gum-trees, however, in a valley to the southwest of us, as if
growing on the side of a creek that would in such case be tributary
to the main creek on which our tents were pitched, and we hoped, by
running along the base of the hills to the south and turning into
the valley, to force our way onwards. At about three and a half
miles our anticipations were verified by our arriving opposite to
an opening leading northwards into the hills. This proved to be the
valley we had noticed. A line of gum-trees marked the course of a
small creek, which passing behind a little hill at the entrance of
the valley, reappeared on the other side, and then trended to the
N.W. Entering the valley and pursuing our way up it, at two miles
we crossed another small creek, tributary to the first, and at a
mile beyond halted for the night, without having found water.
Although there was a little grass on the plains between the camp
and the ranges, there was none in the valley in which we stopped.
Low bushes of rhagodia and atriplex were alone to be seen, growing
on a red, tenacious, yet somewhat sandy soil, whilst the ranges
themselves were covered with low brush.</p>

<p>The water had almost all leaked out of the tank when we examined
it, so that it was no longer of any service to us. On the morning
of the 7th, therefore, I sent Lewis and Sullivan with the cart back
to the camp, retaining Flood and Morgan to attend on Mr. Browne and
myself.</p>

<p>When we started I directed them to follow up the creek, which
did not appear to continue much further, and on arriving at the
head of it to cross the range, where it was low, in the hope that
they would strike the opposite fall of waters in descending on the
other side, whilst I went with Mr. Browne to a hill from which I
was anxious to take bearings, although Lewis, who had already been
on the top of it, assured me that there was nothing new to be seen.
However, we found the view to be extensive enough to enable us to
judge better of the character of the country than from any other
point on which we had yet been. It was traversed by numerous rocky
ridges, that extended both to the north and south beyond the range
of vision. Many peaks shewed themselves in the distance, and I was
enabled to connect this point with "Coonbaralba", the hill above
the camp. The ridge I had directed Flood to cross was connected
with this hill, and appeared to create a division of the waters
thereabouts. All however to the north or northwest was as yet
confused. There was no visible termination of the ranges in any
direction, nor could we see any feature to guide us in our
movements.</p>

<p>The rock formation of this hill was a fine grained granite, and
was in appearance a round and prominent feature. Although its sides
were covered with low dark brush, there was a considerable quantity
of oat-grass in its deep and sheltered valleys. We soon struck on
Flood's track after leaving this hill, which, as Lewis had been the
first to ascend, I called "Lewis's Hill"; and riding up the valley
along which the men had already passed, at six miles crossed the
ridge, which (as we had been led to hope) proved to be the range
dividing the eastern and western waters. On our descent from this
ridge we proceeded to the north-west, but changed our course to
north in following the cart tracks, and at four miles overtook
Flood and Morgan on the banks of a creek, the channel of which, and
the broad and better grassed valley through which it runs, we
ourselves had several times crossed on our way down, and from the
first had hoped to find it the main creek on the west side of the
ranges.</p>

<p>At the point where we overtook Flood it had increased greatly in
size, but we searched its hopeless bed in vain for water, and as it
there turned too much to the eastward, for which reason Flood had
stopped until we should come up, we left it and crossed the low
part of a range to our left; but as we were going too much to the
south-west, I turned shortly afterwards into a valley that led me
more in the direction in which I was anxious to proceed. The
country had been gradually improving from the time we crossed the
little dividing range, not so much in soil as in appearance, and in
the quality of its herbage. There was a good deal of grass in the
valleys, and up the sides of the hills, which were clear and open
on the slopes but stony on their summits. After proceeding about
two and a half miles, we got into a scrubby part of the hills,
through which we found it difficult to push our way, the scrub
being eucalyptus dumosa, an unusual tree to find in those hills.
After forcing through the scrub for about half a mile, we were
suddenly stopped by a succession of precipitous sandstone gullies,
and were turned to the eastward of north down a valley the fall of
which was to that point. This valley led us to that in which we had
rejoined Flood, but lower down; in crossing it we again struck on
the creek we had then left, much increased in size, and with a row
of gum-trees on either side of it, but its even broad bed composed
of the cleanest gravel and sand, precluded the hope of our finding
water. At about a mile, however, it entered a narrow defile in the
range, and the hills closed rapidly in upon it. Pursuing our way
down the defile it gradually narrowed, the bed of the creek
occupied its whole breadth, and the rocks rose perpendicularly on
either side. We searched this place for water with the utmost care
and anxiety, and I was at length fortunate enough to discover a
small clear basin not a yard in circumference, under a rock on the
left side of the glen. Suspecting that this was supplied by surface
drainage, we enlarged the pool, and obtained from it an abundance
of the most delicious water we had tasted during our wanderings.
Mr. Browne will I am sure bear the Rocky Glen in his most grateful
remembrance. Relieved from further anxiety with regard to our
animals, he hastened with me to ascend one of the hills that
towered above us to the height of 600 feet, before the sun should
set, but this was no trifling task, as the ascent was exceedingly
steep. The view from the summit of this hill presented the same
broken country to our scrutiny which I have before described, at
every point excepting to the westward, in which direction the
ranges appeared to cease at about six miles, and the distant
horizon from S.W. to N.W. presented an unbroken level. The dark and
deep ravine through which the creek ran was visible below us, and
apparently broke through the ranges at about four miles to the
W.N.W. but we could not see any water in its bed. It was
sufficiently cheering to us however to know that we were near the
termination of the ranges to the westward, and that the country we
should next traverse was of open appearance.</p>

<p>We started at eight to pursue our journey, and kept for some
time in its bed. The rock formation near and at our camp was trap,
but at about a mile below it changed to a coarse grey granite, huge
blocks of which, traversed by quartz, were scattered about. The
defile had opened out a little below where we had slept, but it
soon again narrowed, and the hills closed in upon it nearer than
before. The bed of the creek at the same time became rocky, and
blocked up with immense fragments of granite. We passed two or
three pools of water, one of which was of tolerable size, and near
it there were the remains of a large encampment of natives. Near to
it also there was a well, a sure sign that however deep the
water-holes in the glen might now be, there are times when they are
destitute of any. There can be no doubt, indeed, but that we owed
our present supply of water both at this place and at the
Coonbaralba pass, to the rains that fell in the hills during the
week we remained at Williorara.</p>

<p>Soon after passing the native camp, our further progress was
completely stopped by large blocks of granite, which, resting on
each other, prevented the possibility of making a passage for the
cart or even of advancing on horseback. In this predicament I sent
Flood to climb one of the hills to our left, to see if there was a
leading spur by which we could descend to the plains; but on his
return to us he said that the country was wholly impracticable, but
that he thought we should see more of it from a hill he had noticed
about three miles to the north-east. We accordingly left Morgan
with the horses and walked to it. We reached the summit after a
fatiguing walk of an hour, but neither were we repaid for our
trouble, nor was there anything in the view to lead us to hope for
any change for the better. The character of the country had
completely changed, and in barrenness it far exceeded that through
which we had already passed. The line of hills extended from S.E.
by S. to the opposite point of the compass, and formed a steep wall
to shut out the level country below them.</p>

<p>One might have imagined that an ocean washed their base, and I
would that it really had been so, but a very different hue spread
between them and the distant horizon than the deep blue of the sea.
The nearer plains appeared of a lighter shade than the rest of the
landscape, but there were patches of trees or shrubs upon them,
which in the distance were blended together in universal scrub. A
hill, which I had at first sight taken to be Mount Lyell of Sir
Thomas Mitchell, bore 7 degrees to the east of north, distant 18
miles, but as our observations placed us in 31 degrees 32 minutes 0
seconds S. only, it could not have been that hill. To the south and
east our view was limited, as the distant horizon was hid from our
sight by higher ground near us, but there was a confused succession
of hills and valleys in those directions, the sides of both being
covered with low brush and huge masses of granite, and a dark brown
sombre hue pervaded the whole scene. We could not trace the
windings of the creek, but thought we saw gumtrees in the plains
below us, to the N.E., indicating the course of a creek over them.
Some of the same trees were also visible to our left
(looking-westward), and the ranges appeared less precipitous and
lower in the same direction. We cast our eyes therefore to that
point to break through them, and returned to Morgan with at least
the hope of success. In the view I had just then been
contemplating, however, I saw all realized of what I had imagined
of the interior, and felt assured that I had a work of extreme
difficulty before me in the task of penetrating towards the
centre.</p>

<p>As soon as we had got well into the plains, we pursued a course
of half a point to the eastward of north, nearly parallel to the
ranges, until we reached the glen from which the creek issues, and
formed our little camp on its banks. The water however was not
good, so that we were obliged to send for some from a pool a little
above us. In the bed of this creek we found beautiful specimens of
Solani, and a few new plants.</p>

<p>I halted at this place in consequence of the resolution I had
taken to push into the interior on the following morning. I was
therefore anxious that the horses should start as fresh as
possible, as we could not say where we should again find water.</p>

<p>The direction of the hills was nearly north and south, extending
at either hand to a distance beyond the range of vision or
telescope. Our observations here placed us in latitude 31 degrees
23 minutes 20 seconds S., so that we were still nearly half a
degree to the south of Mount Lyell, and a degree to the south of
Mount Serle. I had little prospect of success, however, in pursuing
a direct westerly course, as it would have led me into the visible
scrub there; on the other hand I did not wish to move exactly
parallel to the ranges, but, in endeavouring to gain a knowledge of
the more remote interior, to keep such a course as would not take
me too far from the hills in the event of my being obliged to fall
back upon them. We started on the 11th, therefore, on a N.N.W.
course, and on the bearing of the low hills we had seen to the
westward, and which were now distinctly visible. For the first five
miles we travelled over firm and open plains of clay and sand,
similar to the soil of the plains of the Murray. At length the
ground became covered with fragments of quartz rock, ironstone, and
granite. It appeared as if M'Adam had emptied every stone he ever
broke to be strewed over this metalled region. The edges of the
stones were not, however, rounded by attrition, or mixed together,
but laid on the plains in distinct patches, as if large masses of
the different rocks had been placed at certain distances from each
other and then shivered into pieces. The plains were in themselves
of undulating surface, and appeared to extend to some low
elevations on our left, connecting them with the main range as
outer features; although in the distance they only shewed as a
small and isolated line of hills detached about eleven miles from
the principal groups, from which we were gradually increasing our
distance. This outer feature prevented our seeing the north-west
horizon until we gained an elevated part of it, whence it appeared
that we should soon have to descend to lower ground than that on
which we had been travelling. There was a small eminence that just
shewed itself above the horizon to the N.N.W., and was directly in
our course, enabling us to keep up our bearings with the loftier
and still visible peaks on the ranges. We found the lower ground
much less stony and more even than the higher ground, and our
horses got well over it. At 4 p.m. we observed a line of gum-trees
before us, evidently marking the line of a creek, the upper branch
of which we had already noticed as issuing from a deep recess in
the range. At the distance we were from the hills, we had little
hope of finding water; on approaching it, however, we alarmed some
cockatoos and other birds, and observed the recent tracks of emus
in the bed of the creek. Flood, who had ridden a-head, went up it
in search for water. Mr. Browne and I went downwards, and from
appearances had great hopes that at a particular spot we should
succeed by digging, more especially as on scraping away a little of
the surface gravel with our hands, there were sufficient
indications to induce us to set Morgan to work with a spade, who in
less than an hour dug a hole from which we were enabled to supply
both our own wants and those of our animals; and as there was good
grass in the creek, we tethered them out in comfort. This discovery
was the more fortunate, as Flood returned unsuccessful from his
search.</p>

<p>The gum-trees on this creek were of considerable size; and many
of the shrubs we had found in the creek, at the glen, were in
beautiful flower in its broad and gravelly bed, along which the
Clyanthus was running with its magnificent blossoms; a situation
where I certainly did not expect to find that splendid creeper
growing. It was exceedingly curious to observe the instinct which
brought the smaller birds to our well. Even whilst Morgan was
digging, and Mr. Browne and I sitting close to him, some Diamond
birds (Amandina) were bold enough to perch on his spade; we had, in
the course of the day, whilst passing over the little stony range,
been attracted to a low Banksia, by seeing a number of nests of
these little birds in its branches, and of which there were no less
than fourteen. In some of them were eggs, and in others young
birds; so that it appeared they lived in communities, or
congregated together to breed. But we had numberless opportunities
of observing the habits of this interesting little bird, whose note
cheered us for months, and was ever the forerunner of good, as
indicating the existence of water.</p>

<p>We placed the cart under a gum-tree, in which the cockatoos we
had alarmed when descending into the creek had a nest. These noisy
birds (<i>Plyctolophus</i> Leadbeaterii) kept incessantly
screeching to their young, which answered them in notes that
resembled the croaking of frogs, more than anything else.</p>

<p>On the 11th we left the creek, well satisfied with our night's
occupation of it, as also, I believe, to the still greater
satisfaction of our noisy friends. For about two and a half or
three miles there was every appearance of an improving country It
was open, and in many places well covered with grass; and although
at three miles it fell off a little, still the aspect on the
northern side of the creek was, to a considerable distance,
preferable to that on the south side. At 11 a.m. we gained the
crest of the little stony hill we had seen the day before to the
N.N.W., and from it were enabled not only to take back bearings,
but to carry others forward. We were fast losing sight of the
hills, whose loftier summits alone were visible, yet we now saw
fresh peaks to the north, which satisfied me that they continued in
that direction far beyond the most distant one we had seen. From
this circumstance I was led to hope that we might fall on another
creek, and so gradually, but surely, work our way to the N.W.</p>

<p>On descending from the little hill, however, we traversed an
inferior country, and at two miles saw a few scattered Pine-trees.
Shortly afterwards, on breaking through a low scrub, we crossed a
ridge of sand, on which numerous Pine-trees were growing. These
ridges then occurred in rapid succession, separated by narrow flats
only; the soil being of a bright red clay covered with Rhagodiae,
and having bare patches on them. The draught over this kind of
country became a serious hindrance to our movements, as it was very
heavy, and the day excessively hot, the horses in the team suffered
much. I therefore desired Morgan to halt, and, with Mr. Browne,
rode forward in the hope of finding water, for he had shot a new
and beautiful pigeon, on the bill of which some moist clay was
adhering; wherefore we concluded that he had just been drinking at
some shallow, but still unexhausted, puddle of water near us: we
were, however unsuccessful in our search; but crossed pine ridge
after pine ridge, until at length I thought it better to turn back
to the cart, and, as we had already travelled some 25 miles, to
halt until the morning; more especially as there was no deficiency
of grass on the sand ridges, and I did not apprehend that our
horses would suffer much from the want of water.</p>

<p>Whatever idea I might have had of the character of the country
into which we had penetrated, I certainly was not prepared for any
so singular as that we encountered. The sand ridges, some
partially, some thickly, covered with Pine-trees, were from thirty
to fifty feet high, and about eighty yards at their base, running
nearly longitudinally from north to south. They were generally well
covered with grass, which appeared to have been the produce of
recent rains; and several very beautiful leguminous plants were
also growing on them. I did not imagine that these ridges would
continue much longer, and I therefore determined, the following
morning to push on. Our position was in lat. 30 degrees 40 minutes
S. and in longitude 140 degrees 51 minutes E. nearly.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th we commenced our day's journey on a
N.W. course, as I had proposed to Mr. Browne. Flood had been about
half a mile to the eastward, in the hope of finding water before we
rose, but was disappointed; the horses did not, however, appear to
have suffered from the want of it during the night. On starting I
requested Mr. Browne to make a circuit to the N.E. for the same
purpose, as we had observed many birds fly past us in that
direction; and I sent Flood to the westward, but both returned
unsuccessful. Nevertheless, although we could not find any water,
the country improved.</p>

<p>The soil was still clay and sand, but we crossed some very fine
flats, and only wanted water to enjoy comparative luxury. Both the
flats and the ridges were well clothed with grass, and the former
had box-trees and hakeas scattered over them; but these favourable
indications soon ceased. The pine ridges closed upon each other
once more, and the flats became covered with salsolaceous plants.
The day was exceedingly hot, and still more oppressive in the
brushes, so that the horses began to flag. At 2 p.m. no favourable
change had taken place. Our view was limited to the succeeding sand
hill; nor, by ascending the highest trees, could we see any
elevated land at that hour; therefore I stopped, as the cart got on
so slowly, and as the horses would now, under any circumstances, be
three days without water, I determined on retracing my steps to the
creek in which we had dug the well. I directed Mr. Browne, with
Flood, however, to push on, till sunset, in the hope that he might
see a change. At sunset I commenced my retreat, feeling satisfied
that I had no hope of success in finding water so far from the
hills. Turning back at so late an hour in the afternoon, it was
past midnight when we reached the sand ridge from which we had
started in the morning; where we again stopped until dawn, when
proceeding onwards, and passing a shallow puddle of surface water,
that was so thick with mud and animalculae as to be unfit to drink,
we gained the creek at half-past 4 p.m. Mr. Browne and Flood joined
us some little time after sunset, having ridden about 18 miles
beyond the point at which we had parted, but had not noticed any
change. The sandy ridges, Mr. Browne informed me, continued as far
as he went; and, to all appearance, for miles beyond. The day we
returned to the creek was one of most overpowering heat, the
thermometer at noon being 117 degrees in the shade. I had promised
to wait for Mr. Browne at the shallow puddle, but the sun's rays
fell with such intense effect on so exposed a spot that I was
obliged to seek shelter at the creek. It blew furiously during the
night of the 13th, in heated gusts from the north-east, and on the
morning of the 14th the gale continued with unabated violence, and
eventually became a hot wind. We were, therefore, unable to stir.
The flies being in such myriads around us, so that we could do
nothing. It is, indeed, impossible for me to describe the
intolerable plague they were during the whole of that day from
early dawn to sunset.</p>

<p>On the night of the 14th it rained a little. About 3 a.m. the
wind blew round to the north-west, and at dawn we had a smart
shower which cooled the air, reducing the temperature to something
bearable. The sun rose amidst heavy clouds, by which his fiery
beams were intercepted in their passage to the earth's surface.
Before we quitted our ground I sent Flood up the creek, to trace it
into the hills, an intention I was myself obliged to forego, being
anxious to remain with the cart. The distance between the two
creeks is about 26 miles, but, as I have already described the
intervening country, it may not be necessary to notice it further.
I was unable to take many back bearings, as the higher portions of
the ranges were enveloped in mist. We reached the glen at half-past
5 p.m., and took up our old berth just at the gorge, preparatory to
ascending the hills on the following day. Flood had already arrived
there, and informed me that he had not followed the creek to where
it issued from the ranges, but had approached very nearly, and
could see the point from which it broke through them. That he had
not found any surface water, but had tried the ground in many
places, and always found water at two or three inches depth, and
that where the water was the most abundant the feed was also the
most plentiful....</p>

<p>As the reader will have learnt from what I have stated at the
conclusion of the last chapter, we pitched our tents at the place
to which I have led him, and which I shall henceforth call the
"Depot", on the 27th of January, 1845. They were not struck again
until the 17th of July following.</p>

<p>This ruinous detention paralyzed the efforts and enervated the
strength of the expedition, by constitutionally affecting both the
men and animals, and depriving them of the elasticity and energy
with which they commenced their labours. It was not however until
after we had run down every creek in our neighbourhood, and had
traversed the country in every direction, that the truth flashed
across my mind, and it became evident to me, that we were locked up
in the desolate and heated region, into which we had penetrated, as
effectually as if we had wintered at the Pole. It was long indeed
ere I could bring myself to believe that so great a misfortune had
overtaken us, but so it was. Providence had, in its allwise
purposes, guided us to the only spot, in that wide-spread desert,
where our wants could have been permanently supplied, but had there
stayed our further progress into a region that almost appears to be
forbidden ground. The immediate effect, however, of our arrival at
the Depot, was to relieve my mind from anxiety as to the safety of
the party. There was now no fear of our encountering difficulties,
and perhaps perishing from the want of that life-sustaining
element, without which our efforts would have been unavailing, for
independently of the beautiful sheet of water, on the banks of
which the camp was established, there was a small lagoon to the
S.E. of us, and around it there was a good deal of feed, besides
numerous water-holes in the rocky gully. The creek was marked by a
line of gum-trees, from the mouth of the glen to its junction with
the main branch, in which, excepting in isolated spots, water was
no longer to be found. The Red Hill (afterwards called Mount
Poole), bore N.N.W. from us, distant 3&frac12; miles; between us and it
there were undulating plains, covered with stones or salsolaceous
herbage, excepting in the hollows, wherein there was a little
grass. Behind us were level stony plains, with small sandy
undulations, bounded by brush, over which the Black Hill, bearing
S.S.E. from the Red Hill, was visible, distant 10 miles. To the
eastward the country was, as I have described it, hilly. Westward
at a quarter of a mile the low range, through which Depot Creek
forces itself, shut out from our view the extensive plains on which
it rises. This range extended longitudinally nearly north and
south, but was nowhere more than a mile and a half in breadth. The
geological formation of the range was slate, traversed by veins of
quartz, its interstices being filled with magnesian limestone.
Steep precipices and broken rugged gullies alternated on either
side of this creek, and in its bed there were large slabs of
beautiful slate. The precipices shewed the lateral formation with
the rock split into the finest laminae, terminating in sharp
points. But neither on the ranges or on the plains behind the camp
was there any feed for the cattle, neither were the banks of the
creek or its neighbourhood to be put in comparison with Flood's
Creek in this respect, for around it there was an abundance as well
as a variety of herbage. Still the vegetation on the Depot Creek
was vigorous, and different kinds of seeds were to be procured.</p>

<p>The morning we started to pay a visit to the blacks was more
than usually oppressive even at daybreak, and about 9 it blew a hot
wind from the N.E. As we rode across the stony plain lying between
us and the hills, the heated and parching blasts that came upon us
were more than we could bear. We were in the centre of the plain,
when Mr. Browne drew my attention to a number of small black specks
in the upper air. These spots increasing momentarily in size, were
evidently approaching us rapidly. In an incredibly short time we
were surrounded by several hundreds of the common kite, stooping
down to within a few feet of us, and then turning away, after
having eyed us steadily. Several approached us so closely, that
they threw themselves back to avoid contact, opening their beaks
and spreading out their talons. The long flight of these birds,
reaching from the ground into the heavens, put me strongly in mind
of one of Martin's beautiful designs, in which he produces the
effect of distance by a multitude of objects gradually vanishing
from the view. Whatever the reader may think, these birds had a
most formidable aspect, and were too numerous for us to have
overpowered, if they had really attacked us. That they came down to
see what unusual object was wandering across the lonely deserts
over which they soar, in the hope of prey, there can be no doubt;
but seeing that we were likely to prove formidable antagonists,
they wheeled from us in extensive sweeps, and were soon lost to
view in the lofty region from whence they had descended....</p>

<p>The three last days of February were cool in comparison to the
few preceding ones. The wind was from the south, and blew so
heavily that I anticipated rough weather at the commencement of
March. But that rough month set in with renewed heat, consequent on
the wind returning to its old quarter the E.S.E. There were however
some heavy clouds floating about, and from the closeness of the
atmosphere I hoped that rain would have fallen, but all these
favourable signs vanished, the thermometer ascending to more than
100 degrees.</p>

<p>When we first pitched our tents at the Depot the neighbourhood
of it teemed with animal life. The parrots and paroquets flew up
and down the creeks collecting their scattered thousands, and
making the air resound with their cries. Pigeons congregated
together; bitterns, cockatoos, and other birds; all collected round
as preparatory to migrating. In attendance on these were a variety
of the Accipitrine class, hawks of different kinds, making sad
havoc amongst the smaller birds. About the period of my return from
the north they all took their departure, and we were soon wholly
deserted. We no longer heard the discordant shriek of the parrots,
or the hoarse croaking note of the bittern. They all passed away
simultaneously in a single day; the line of migration being
directly to the N.W., from which quarter we had small flights of
ducks and pelicans.</p>

<p>On the 6th I sent Flood to the eastward to see if he could
recover the channel of the main creek on the other side of the
plain on which Mr. Poole had lost it; he returned the following
day, with information that at 25 miles from the Depot he had
recovered it, and found more water than he could have supposed. The
day of Flood's return was exceedingly hot and close, and in the
evening we had distant thunder, but no rain.</p>

<p>In consequence of his report, I now determined on a journey to
the eastward to ascertain the character of the country between us
and the Darling, and left the camp with this intention on the 12th
instant. I should have started earlier than that day had not Mr.
Poole's illness prevented me, but as he rallied, I proceeded on my
excursion, accompanied by Mr. Browne, Flood, and another of the
men. We observed several puddles near our old camp on the main
creek as we rode away, so that rain must have fallen there though
not at the Depot. After passing the little conical hill of which I
have already spoken, we traced the creek down until we saw plains
of great extent before us, and as the creek trended to the south,
skirting them on that side, we rode across them on a bearing of 322
degrees or N.W.&frac12;N. They were 7 or 8 miles in breadth, and full 12
miles in length from east to west; their soil was rich and grassed
in many places. At the extremity of the plains was a sand hill,
close to which we again came on the creek, but without water, that
which Flood had found being a little more to the eastward. Its
channel at this place was deep, shaded, and moist, but very narrow.
I was quite surprised when we came to the creek where Flood had
been to find so much water; there was a serpentine sheet, of more
than a quarter of a mile in length, which at first sight appeared
to be as permanent as that at the Depot. The banks were high and
composed of light rich alluvial soil, on which there were many new
shrubs growing; the whole vegetation seemed to be more forward on
this side of the hills than on that where the Depot was. Just as we
halted we saw a small column of smoke rise up due south, and on
looking in that direction observed some grassy plains spreading out
like a boundless stubble, the grass being of the kind from which
the natives collect seed for subsistence at this season of the
year.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 14th March we again saw smoke in the
same direction as before, but somewhat to the eastward, as if the
grass or brush had been fired. In hopes that we should come upon
some of the natives on the plains, through which the creek appeared
to run, I determined on examining them before I proceeded to the
eastward. We accordingly crossed its channel when we mounted our
horses after breakfast, and rode at some little distance from it on
a course of 80 degrees or nearly east, over flooded lands of
somewhat sandy soil, covered with different kinds of grass, of
which large heaps that had been thrashed out by the natives were
piled up like hay cocks. At about two and a half miles we ascended
a sandy rise of about fifty feet in elevation, whence we obtained
bearings of the little conical hill at the western termination of
the plain, and of the hill we had called the Black Hill. These
bearings with our latitude made the distance we had travelled 33
miles. From the sand hill we overlooked plains of great extent to
the N.E.; partly grassed and partly bare, but to the eastward there
was low brush and a country similar to that we had traversed before
the commencement of the sandy ridges. There were low sandy
undulations to be seen; but of no great height. I now turned for
the smoke on a bearing of 187 degrees, or nearly south, traversing
a barren sandy level intermediate between the sand hill and the
plains now upon our right, at length we entered upon the flooded
ground, it was soft and yielding, and marked all over with the
tracks of the natives; at 7 miles arrived at a large clump of
gum-trees, and under them the channel of the creek which we had
lost on the upper part of the plains was again visible. It was here
very broad, but quite bare, except a belt of polygonum growing on
either side, which had been set on fire, and was now in flames. We
were fortunate enough soon after to find a long shallow sheet of
water, in the bed of the creek, where we rested ourselves. It was
singular enough that we should have pulled up close to the camp of
some natives, all of whom had hidden themselves in the polygonum,
except an old woman who was fast asleep, but who did not faint on
seeing Mr. Browne close to her when she awoke. With this old lady
we endeavoured to enter into conversation, and in order to allay
her fears gave her five or six cockatoos we had shot, on which two
other fair ones crept from behind the polygonum and advanced
towards us. Finding that the men were out hunting, and only the
women with the children were present, I determined to stop at this
place until the following morning, we therefore unloaded the horses
and allowed them to go and feed. A little before sunset, the two
men returned to their families. They were much astonished at seeing
us quietly seated before their huts, and approached us with some
caution, but soon got reconciled to our presence. One of them had
caught a talpero and a lizard, but the other had not killed any
thing, so we gave him a dinner of mutton. The language of these
people was a mixture between that of the river and hill tribes; but
from what reason I am unable to say, although we understood their
answers to general questions, we could not gather any lengthened
information from them. I gave the elder native a blanket, and to
the other a knife, with both of which they seemed highly delighted,
and in return I suppose paid us the compliment of sending their
wives to us as soon as it became dusk, but as we did not encourage
their advances they left us after a short visit. The native who had
killed the talpero, skinned it the moment he arrived in the camp,
and, having first moistened them, stuffed the skin with the leaves
of a plant of very astringent properties. All these natives were
very poor, particularly the men, nor do I think that at this season
of the year they can have much animal food of any kind to subsist
on. Their principal food appeared to be seeds of various kinds, as
of the box-tree, and grass seeds, which they pound into cakes and
bake, together with different kinds of roots.</p>

<p>On the 15th we started at 7 a.m., and crossing at the head of
the water, pursued a south course over extensive flooded plains, on
which we again lost the channel of the creek, as, after winding
round a little contiguous sand hill, it split into numberless
branches; but although the plains hereabouts were well grassed, the
soil was not so good as that on the plains above them. At six miles
we ascended a sand hill, from which we could see to the extremity
of the plain; but it had no apparent outlet excepting to the E.S.E.
I therefore proceeded on that course for three miles, when we lost
sight of all gum-trees, and found ourselves amongst scrub. Low
bushes bounded the horizon all round, and hid the grassy plains
from our view; but they were denser to the south and east than at
any other point. Mount Lyell, the large hill south, bore 140
degrees to the east of north, distant between forty and fifty
miles. A short time after we left the grassy flats we crossed the
dry bed of a large lagoon, which had been seen by Mr. Poole on a
bearing of 77 degrees from the Magnetic Hill. In the richer soil, a
plant with round, striped fruit upon it, of very bitter taste, a
species of cucumber, was growing. We next proceeded to the
eastward, and surveying the country from higher ground, observed
that the creek had no outlet from the plains, and that it could not
but terminate on them.</p>

<p>As I had no object in a prolonged journey to the south, I turned
back from this station, and retracing my steps to the water where
we had left the natives, reached it at half-past six. All our
friends were still there; we had, therefore, the pleasure of
passing another afternoon with them, during which they were joined
by two other natives, with their families, who had been driven in
from the south, like ourselves, by the want of water. They assured
us that all the water in that quarter had disappeared, "that the
sun had taken it," and that we should not find a drop to the
eastward, where I told them I was going. All these men, excepting
one, had been circumcised. The single exception had the left
fore-tooth of his upper jaw extracted, and I therefore concluded
that he belonged to a different tribe. I had hoped to have seen
many more natives in this locality; but it struck me, from what I
observed, that they were dispersed at the different water-holes,
there being no one locality capable of supporting any number.</p>

<p>The low and flooded track I have been describing must be
dreadfully cold during the winter season, and the natives, who are
wholly unprovided for inclemency of any kind, must suffer greatly
from exposure; but at this time the temperature still continued
very high, and the constant appearance of the deep purple tint
opposite to the rising and setting sun seemed to indicate a
continuance of it.</p>

<p>As our horses had had some long journeys for the last three
days, we merely returned to our first bivouac on the creek, when we
left the natives, with whom we parted on very good terms, and a
promise on their part to come and see us. On the 17th started at
quarter-past six for the eastward, with as much water as we could
carry in the cart, as from the accounts of the natives we scarcely
hoped to find any. For the first five miles we kept a course rather
to the north of east, nearly E.N.E. indeed, to round some
sand-hills we should otherwise have been obliged to cross. There
were very extensive plains to our left, on which water must lie
during winter; but their soil was not good, or the vegetation thick
upon them. We could just see the points of the northern flat-topped
ranges beyond them. At five miles we turned due east, and crossed
several small plains, separated by sandy undulations, not high
enough to be termed ridges; the country, both to the south and
east, appearing to be extremely low. At about fifteen miles, just
as we were ascending a sand hill, Mr. Browne caught sight of a
native stealing through the brush, after whom he rode; but the
black observing him, ran away. On this Mr. Browne called out to
him, when he stopped; but the horse happening to neigh at the
moment, the poor fellow took to his heels, and secreted himself so
adroitly, that we could not find him. He must, indeed, have been
terribly alarmed at the uncouth sound he heard.</p>

<p>A short time before our adventure with the native we had seen
three pelicans coming from the north. They kept very low to the
ground, and wheeled along in circles in a very remarkable manner,
as if they had just risen from water; but at length they soared
upwards, and flew straight for the lagoon where we had left the
natives. With the exception of these three birds, no other was to
be seen in those dreary regions. Both Mr. Browne and I, however,
rode over a snake, but our horses fortunately escaped being bitten;
this animal had seized a mouse, which it let go on being disturbed,
and crept into a hole; it was very pretty, being of a bright yellow
colour with brown specks. Arriving at the termination of the sand
hills, we looked down upon an immense shallow basin, extending to
the north and south-east further than the range of vision, which
must, I should imagine, be wholly impassable during the rainy
season. There was scarcely any vegetation, a proof, it struck me,
that it retains water on its surface till the summer is so advanced
that the sun's rays are too powerful for any plants that may spring
up, or that the heat bakes the soil so that nothing can force
itself through. There was little, if any grass to be seen; but the
mesembryanthemum reappeared upon it, with other salsolaceous
plants. The former was of a new variety, with flowers on a long
slender stalk, heaps of which had been gathered by the natives for
the seed. Of the timber of these regions there was none; a few
gum-trees near the creeks, with box-trees on the flats, and a few
stunted acacia and hakea on the small hills, constituted almost the
whole. Water boiled on this plain at 212 degrees; that is to say at
our camp were we slept, about two miles advanced into it, but the
plain extended about five miles further to the eastward. After
crossing this on the following morning, we traversed a country
which Mr. Browne informed me was very similar to that near Lake
Torrens. It consisted of sand banks, or drifts, with large bare
patches at intervals: the whole bearing testimony to the violence
of the rains that must sometimes deluge it. We then traversed a
succession of flats (I call them so because they did not deserve
the name of plains) separated from each other by patches of red
sand and clay, that were not more than a foot and a half above the
surface of the flats. At nine miles the country became covered with
low scrub, and we soon after passed the dry bed of a lagoon, about
a mile in circumference, on which there was a coating of salt and
gypsum resting on soft black mud. About a mile from this we passed
a new tree, similar to one we had seen on the Cawndilla plain. From
this point the land imperceptibly rose, until at length we found
ourselves on some sandy elevations thickly covered with scrub of
acacia, almost all dead, but there was a good deal of grass around
them, and the spot might at another season, and if the trees had
been in leaf, have looked pretty. We pushed through this scrub, the
soil being a bright red sand for nine miles, when we suddenly found
ourselves at the base of a small stony hill, of about fifty feet in
height. From the summit we overlooked the region round about. To
the eastward, as a medium point, it was covered with a dense scrub,
that extended to the base of a range of hills, distant about 33
miles, the extremities of which bore 71 degrees and 152 degrees
respectively from us. But although the country under them was
covered with brush, the hills appeared to be clear and denuded of
brushes of any kind. Our position here was about 138 miles from the
Darling, and about 97 from the Depot. My object in this excursion
had been to ascertain the characteristic of the country between us
and the Darling, but I did not think it necessary to run any risks
with my horses, by pushing on for the hills, as I could not have
reached them until late the following day, when in the event of not
finding water, their fate would have been sealed; for we could not
have returned with them to the creek. They had already been two
days without, if I except the little we had spared them from the
casks. I had deemed it prudent to send Joseph and Lewis back to the
creek for a fresh supply, with orders to return and meet at a
certain point, and there to await our arrival, for without this
supply I felt satisfied we should have great difficulty as it was
in getting our animals back to the creek. We descended from the
hill therefore to some green looking trees, of a foliage new to me,
to rest for an hour before we turned back again. There were neither
flowers or fruit on the trees, but from their leaf and habit, I
took them to be a species of the Juglans. At sunset we mounted our
horses and travelled to the edge of the acacia scrub to give our
horses some of the grass, and halted in it for the night, but
started early on the following morning to meet Joseph. We reached
the appointed place, about 10, but not finding him there continued
to journey onwards, and at five miles met him. We then stopped and
gave the horses 12 gallons of water each, after which we tethered
them out, but they were so restless that I determined to mount
them, and pushing on reached the creek at half-past 1, a.m. The
animals requiring rest I remained stationary the next day, and was
myself glad to keep in the shade, not that the day was particularly
hot, but because I began to feel the effects of constant exposure.
Having expressed some opinion, however, that there might have been
water to the north of us, in the direction whence the pelicans
came, Mr. Browne volunteered to ride out, and accordingly with
Flood left me about 10, but returned late in the afternoon without
having found any. He ascertained that the creek I had sent Flood to
trace when Mr. Stuart went to sketch in the ranges, terminated in
the barren plain we had crossed, and such, the reader will observe,
is the general termination of all the creeks of these singular and
depressed regions.</p>

<p>The month of April set in without any indication of a change in
the weather. It appeared as if the flood gates of Heaven were
closed upon us for ever. We now began to feel the effects of
disappointment, and watched the sky with extreme anxiety, inso-much
that the least cloud raised all our hopes. The men were employed in
various ways to keep them in health. We planted seeds in the bed of
the creek, but the sun burnt them to cinders the moment they
appeared above the ground. On the evening of the 3rd there was
distant thunder, and heavy clouds to the westward. I thought it
might have been that some shower had approached sufficiently near
for me to benefit by the surface water it would have left to push
towards Lake Torrens, and therefore mounted my horse and rode away
to the westward on the 4th, but returned on the night of the 7th in
disappointment. Time rolled on fast, and still we were unable to
stir. Mr. Piesse, who took great delight in strolling out with my
gun, occasionally shot a new bird.</p>

<p>On the 4th the wind blew strong from the south; but although the
air was cooled, no rain fell, nor indeed was there any likelihood
of rain with the wind in that quarter. Still as this was the first
decided shift from the points to which it had kept so steadily, we
augured good from it. On the 7th a very bright meteor was seen to
burst in the south-east quarter of the heavens; crossing the sky
with a long train of light, and in exploding seemed to form
numerous stars. Whether it was fancy or not we thought the
temperature cooled down from this period. On this day also we had a
change of moon, but neither produced a variation of wind or weather
of any immediate benefit to us. On the 14th we tried to ascertain
the dew point, but failed, as in previous instances. The
thermometer in our underground room stood at 78 degrees of
Farenheit, but we could not reduce the moist bulb below 49 degrees;
nor was I surprised at this, considering we had not had rain for
nearly four months, and that during our stay at the Depot we had
never experienced a dew. The ground was thoroughly heated to the
depth of three or four feet, and the tremendous heat that prevailed
had parched vegetation and drawn moisture from everything. In an
air so rarified, and an atmosphere so dry, it was hardly to be
expected that any experiment upon it would be attended with its
usual results, or that the particles of moisture so far separated,
could be condensed by ordinary methods. The mean of the thermometer
for the months of December, January, and February, had been 101
degrees, 104 degrees, and 101 degrees respectively in the shade.
Under its effects every screw in our boxes had been drawn, and the
horn handles of our instruments, as well as our combs, were split
into fine laminae. The lead dropped out of our pencils, our signal
rockets were entirely spoiled; our hair, as well as the wool on the
sheep, ceased to grow, and our nails had become as brittle as
glass. The flour lost more than eight per cent of its original
weight, and the other provisions in a still greater proportion. The
bran in which our bacon had been packed, was perfectly saturated,
and weighed almost as heavy as the meat; we were obliged to bury
our wax candles; a bottle of citric acid in Mr. Browne's box became
fluid, and escaping, burnt a quantity of his linen; and we found it
difficult to write or draw, so rapidly did the fluid dry in our
pens and brushes. It was happy for us, therefore, that a cooler
season set in, otherwise I do not think that many of us could much
longer have survived. But, although it might be said that the
intense heat of the summer had passed, there still were intervals
of most oppressive weather.</p>

<p>About the beginning of March I had had occasion to speak to Mr.
Browne as to certain indications of disease that were upon me. I
had violent headaches, unusual pains in my joints, and a coppery
taste in my mouth. These symptoms I attributed to having slept so
frequently on the hard ground and in the beds of creeks, and it was
only when my mouth became sore, and my gums spongy, that I felt it
necessary to trouble Mr. Browne, who at once told me that I was
labouring under an attack of scurvy, and I regretted to learn from
him that both he and Mr. Poole were similarly affected, but they
hoped I had hitherto escaped. Mr. Browne was the more surprised at
my case, as I was very moderate in my diet, and had taken but
little food likely to cause such a malady. Of we three Mr. Poole
suffered most, and gradually declined in health. For myself I
immediately took double precautions, and although I could not hope
soon to shake off such a disease, especially under such
unfavourable circumstances as those in which we were placed, I was
yet thankful that I did not become worse. For Mr. Browne, as he did
not complain, I had every hope that he too had succeeded in
arresting the progress of this fearful distemper. It will naturally
occur to the reader as singular, that the officers only should have
been thus attacked; but the fact is, that they had been constantly
absent from the camp, and had therefore been obliged to use bacon,
whereas the men were living on fresh mutton; besides, the same men
were seldom taken on a second journey, but were allowed time to
recover from the exposure to which they had been subjected, but for
the officers there was no respite.</p>

<p>On the 18th the wind, which had again settled in the S.E.
changed to the N.E., and the sky became generally overcast. Heavy
clouds hung over the Mount Serle chain, and I thought that rain
would have fallen, but all these favourable indications vanished
before sunset. At dawn of the morning of the 19th, dense masses of
clouds were seen, and thunder heard to the west; and the wind
shifting to that quarter, we hoped that some of the clouds would
have been blown over to us, but they kept their place for two days,
and then gradually disappeared. These distant indications, however,
were sufficient to rouse us to exertion, in the hope of escaping
from the fearful captivity in which we had so long been held. I
left the camp on the 21st with Mr. Browne and Flood, thinking that
rain might have extended to the eastward from Mount Serle,
sufficiently near to enable us to push into the N.W. interior, and
as it appeared to me that a W. by N. course would take me abreast
of Mount Hopeless, I ran upon it. At 16 miles I ascended a low
range, but could not observe anything from it to the westward but
scrub. Descending from this range we struck the head of a creek,
and at six miles came on the last dregs of a pool of water, so
thick that it was useless to us. We next crossed barren stony
undulations and open plains, some of them apparently subject to
floods; and halted at half-past six, after a journey of between
thirty and forty miles without water, and with very little grass
for our horses to eat. Although the course we kept, had taken us at
times to a considerable distance from the creek, we again came on
it before sunset, and consequently halted upon its banks; but in
tracing it down on the following morning we lost its channel on an
extensive plain, and therefore continued our journey to the
westward. At seven miles we entered a dense scrub, and at fifteen
ascended a sand hill, from which we expected to have had a more
than usually extensive view, but it was limited to the next sand
hill, nor was there the slightest prospect of a change of country
being at hand. At four miles from this position we came upon a
second creek seemingly from the N.E., whose appearance raised our
hopes of obtaining water; but as its channel became sandy, and
turned southwards, I left it, and once more running on our old
course, pulled up at sunset under a bank of sand, without anything
either for ourselves or our horses to drink. During the latter part
of the evening we had observed a good deal of grass on the sand
hills, nor was there any deficiency of it round our bivouac; but,
notwithstanding that there was more than enough for the few horses
we had, a herd of cattle would have discussed the whole in a night.
It was evident from the state of the ground that no rain had fallen
hereabouts, and I consequently began to doubt whether it had
extended beyond the mountains. Comparing the appearance of the
country we were in, with that through which Mr. Browne passed for
50 miles before he came upon Lake Torrens, and concluding that some
such similar change would have taken place here if we had
approached within any reasonable distance of that basin, I could
not but apprehend that we were still a long way from it.</p>

<p>The horses having refused the water we had found in the creek, I
could hardly expect they would drink it on their return, so that I
calculated our distance from water at about 68 miles; and I foresaw
that unless we should succeed in finding some early in the day
following, it would be necessary for us to make for the Depot
again. Close to where we stopped there was a large burrow of
Talperos, an animal, as I have observed, similar to the rabbit in
its habits, and one of which the natives are very fond, as food.
The sandy ridges appeared to be full of them, and other animals,
that must live for many months at a time without water. Whilst we
were sitting in the dusk near our fire, two beautiful parrots
attracted by it, I suppose, pitched close to us; but immediately
took wing again, and flew away to the N.W. They, no doubt, thought
that we were near water, but like ourselves were doomed to
disappointment. During the evening also some plovers flew over us,
and we heard some native dogs howling to the south-west. At
daylight, therefore, we rode in that direction, with the hope of
finding the element we now so much required. At three miles a large
grassy flat opened out to view upon our right, similar to that at
the termination of the Depot creek. It might have contained 1000
acres, but there was not at the first glance, a tree to be seen
upon it This flat was bounded to the S.W. by a sand bank, lying at
right angles to the sand ridges we had been crossing. The latter,
therefore, ran down upon this bank in parallel, lines, some falling
short of, and others striking it; so that, as the drainage was
towards the embankment, the collected waters lodged against it.
After crossing a portion of the plain we saw some box-trees in a
hollow, towards which we rode, and then came upon a deep dry pond,
in whose bottom the natives had dug several wells, and had
evidently lingered near it as long as a drop of water remained. It
was now clear that our further search for water would be useless. I
therefore turned on a course of 12 degrees to the north of east for
the muddy water we had passed two days before, and halted there
about an hour after sunset, having journeyed 42 miles. We fell into
our tracks going out about four miles before we halted, and were
surprised to observe that a solitary native had been running them
down. On riding a little further however, we noticed several tracks
of different sizes, as if a family of natives had been crossing the
country to the north-west. It is more than probable that their
water having failed in the hills, they were on their way to some
other place where they had a well.</p>

<p>Although we had ourselves been without water for two days, the
mud in the creek was so thick that I could not swallow it, and was
really astonished how Mr. Browne managed to drink a pint of it made
into tea. It absolutely fell over the cup of the panakin like thick
cream, and stuck to the horses' noses like pipe-clay. They drank
sparingly however, and took but little grass during the night. As
we pursued our journey homewards on the following day, we passed
several flights of dotterel making to the south, this being the
first migration we had observed in that direction. These birds were
in great numbers on the plains of Adelaide the year preceding, and
had afforded good sport to my friend Torrens; we also observed a
flight of pelicans, wheeling about close to the ground, as they had
before done to the eastward, as well as a flight of the
black-shouldered hawks hovering in the air. Our day's ride had been
very long and fatiguing, as the horses were tired, but we got
relieved by our arrival at the camp a little before sunset on the
25th: and thus terminated another journey in disappointment. We
regretted to find that Mr. Poole was seriously indisposed. His
muscles were now attacked and he was suffering great pain, but, as
the disease appeared inclined to make to the surface, Mr. Browne
had some hopes of a favourable change. Both Mr. Browne and myself
found that the sameness of our diet began to disagree with us, and
were equally anxious for the reappearance of vegetation, in the
hope that we should be able to collect sow-thistles or the tender
shoots of the rhagodia as a change. We had, whilst it lasted, taken
mint tea, in addition to the scanty supply of tea to which we were
obliged to limit ourselves, but I do not think it was
wholesome.</p>

<p>The moon entered her third quarter on the 27th, but brought no
change; on the contrary she chased away the clouds as she rose, and
moved through the heavens in unshrouded and dazzling brightness.
Sometimes a dark mass of clouds would rise simultaneously with her,
in the west, but as the queen of night advanced in her upward
course they gradually diminished the velocity with which they at
first came up; stopped, and fell back again, below the horizon. Not
once, but fifty times have we watched these apparently contending
forces, but whether I am right in attributing the cause I will not
say.</p>

<p>At this time (the end of April) the weather was very fine,
although the thermometer ranged high. The wind being steady at
south accounted for the unusual height of the barometrical column,
which rose to 30.600. On the night of the 20th we had a heavy dew,
the first since our departure from the Darling. On the morning of
the 28th it thundered, and a dense cloud passed over to the north,
the wind was unsteady, and I hoped that the storm would have worked
round, but it did not. At ten the wind sprung up from the south,
the sky cleared and all our hopes were blighted.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that we treated the natives who came to the
creek with every kindness, none ever visited us, and I was the more
surprised at this, because I could not but think that we were
putting them to great inconvenience by our occupation of this spot.
Towards the end of the month, it was so cold that we were glad to
have fires close to our tents. Mr. Poole had gradually become worse
and worse, and was now wholly confined to his bed, unable to stir,
a melancholy affliction both to himself and us, rendering our
detention in that gloomy region still more painful. My men
generally were in good health, but almost all had bleeding at the
nose; I was only too thankful that my own health did not give way,
though I still felt the scurvy in a mitigated form, but Mr. Browne
had more serious symptoms about him.</p>

<p>The 10th of May completed the ninth month of our absence from
Adelaide, and still we were locked up without the hope of escape,
whilst every day added fresh causes of anxiety to those I had
already to bear up against. Mr. Poole became worse, all his skin
along the muscles turned black, and large pieces of spongy flesh
hung from the roof of his mouth, which was in such a state that he
could hardly eat. Instead of looking with eagerness to the moment
of our liberation, I now dreaded the consequent necessity of moving
him about in so dreadful a condition. Mr. Browne attended him with
a constancy and kindness that could not but raise him in my
estimation, doing every thing which friendship or sympathy could
suggest.</p>

<p>On the 11th about 3 p.m. I was roused by the dogs simultaneously
springing up and rushing across the creek, but supposing they had
seen a native dog, I did not rise; however, I soon knew by their
continued barking that they had something at bay, and Mr. Piesse
not long after came to inform me a solitary native was on the top
of some rising ground in front of the camp. I sent him therefore
with some of the men to call off the dogs, and to bring him down to
the tents. The poor fellow had fought manfully with the dogs, and
escaped injury, but had broken his waddy over one of them. He was
an emaciated and elderly man, rather low in stature, and half dead
with hunger and thirst; he drank copiously of the water that was
offered to him, and then ate as much as would have served me for
four and twenty dinners. The men made him up a screen of boughs
close to the cart near the servants, and I gave him a blanket in
which he rolled himself up and soon fell fast asleep. Whence this
solitary stranger could have come from we could not divine. No
other natives approached to look after him, nor did he shew anxiety
for any absent companion. His composure and apparent
self-possession were very remarkable, for he neither exhibited
astonishment or curiosity at the novelties by which he was
surrounded. His whole demeanour was that of a calm and courageous
man, who finding himself placed in unusual jeopardy, had determined
not to be betrayed into the slightest display of fear or
timidity.</p>

<p>From the period of our return from the eastward, I had remained
quiet in the camp, watching every change in the sky; I was indeed
reluctant to absent myself for any indefinite period, in
consequence of Mr. Poole's precarious state of health. He had now
used all the medicines we had brought out, and none therefore
remained either for him or any one else who might subsequently be
taken ill. As however he was better, on the 12th, I determined to
make a second excursion to the eastward, to see if there were any
more natives in the neighbourhood of the grassy plains than when I
was last there. Wishing to get some samples of wood I took the
light cart and Tampawang also, in the hope that he would be of
use.</p>

<p>Although the water in the creek had sunk fearfully there was
still a month's supply remaining, but if it had been used by our
stock it would then have been dry. Close to the spot where we had
before stopped, there were two huts that had been recently erected.
Before these two fires were burning, and some troughs of grass seed
were close to them, but no native could we see, neither did any
answer to our call. Mr. Browne, however, observing some recent
tracks, ran them down, and discovered a native and his lubra who
had concealed themselves in the hollow of a tree, from which they
crept as soon as they saw they were discovered. The man, we had
seen before, and the other proved to be the frail one who exhibited
such indignation at our rejecting her addresses on a former
occasion; being a talkative damsel, we were glad to renew our
acquaintance with her. We learnt from them that the second hut
belonged to an absent native who was out hunting, the father of a
pretty little girl who now obeyed their signal and came forth. They
said the water on the plain had dried up, and that the only
water-holes remaining were to the west, viz. at our camp, and to
the south, where they said there were two water-holes. As they had
informed us, the absent native made his appearance at sunset, but
his bag was very light, so we once more gave them all our mutton;
he proved to be the man Mr. Browne chased on the sand hills, the
strongest native we had seen; he wanted the front tooth, but was
not circumcised.</p>

<p>In the evening we had a thunder storm, but could have counted
the drops of rain that fell, notwithstanding the thunder was loud
and the lightning vivid. We returned to the Depot on the 13th, and
on crossing the plain Mr. Browne had well nigh captured a jerboa,
which sprang from under my horse's legs, but managed to elude him,
and popped into a little hole before he could approach sufficiently
near to strike at it. On reaching the tents we had the
mortification to find Mr. Poole still worse, but I attributed his
relapse in some measure to a depression of spirits. The old man who
had come to the camp the day before we left it, was still there,
and had apparently taken up his quarters between the cart and my
tent. During our absence the men had shewn him all the wonders of
the camp, and he in his turn had strongly excited their
anticipations, by what he had told them.</p>

<p>He appeared to be quite aware of the use of the boat, intimating
that it was turned upside down, and pointed to the N.W. as the
quarter in which we should use her. He mistook the sheep net for a
fishing net, and gave them to understand that there were fish in
those waters so large that they would not get through the meshes.
Being anxious to hear what he had to say I sent for him to my tent,
and with Mr. Browne cross-questioned him.</p>

<p>It appeared quite clear to us that he was aware of the existence
of large water somewhere or other to the northward and westward. He
pointed from W.N.W. round to the eastward of north, and explained
that large waves higher than his head broke on the shore. On my
shewing him the fish figured in Sir Thomas Mitchell's work he knew
only the cod. Of the fish figured in Cuvier's works he gave
specific names to those he recognised, as the hippocampus, the
turtle, and several sea fish, as the chetodon, but all the others
he included under one generic name, that of "guia," fish.</p>

<p>He put his hands very cautiously on the snakes, and withdrew
them suddenly as if he expected they would bite him, and evinced
great astonishment when he felt nothing but the soft paper. On
being asked, he expressed his readiness to accompany us when there
should be water, but said we should not have rain yet. I must
confess this old native raised my hopes, and made me again anxious
for the moment when we should resume our labours, but when that
time was to come God only knew.</p>

<p>It had been to no purpose that we had traversed the country in
search for water. None any longer remained on the parched surface
of the stony desert, if I except what remained at the Depot, and
the little in the creek to the eastward. There were indeed the
ravages of floods and the vestiges of inundations to be seen in the
neighbourhood of every creek we had traced, and upon every plain we
had crossed, but the element that had left such marks of its fury
was no where to be found.</p>

<p>From this period I gave up all hope of success in any future
effort I might make to escape from our dreary prison. Day after
day, and week after week passed over our heads, without any
apparent likelihood of any change in the weather. The consequences
of our detention weighed heavily on my mind, and depressed my
spirits, for in looking over Mr. Piesse's monthly return of
provisions on hand, I found that unless some step was taken to
enable me to keep the field, I should on the fall of rain be
obliged to retreat. I had by severe exertion gained a most
commanding position, the wide field of the interior lay like an
open sea before me, and yet every sanguine hope I had ever indulged
appeared as if about to be extinguished. The only plan for me to
adopt was to send a portion of the men back to Adelaide. I found by
calculation that if I divided the party, retaining nine in all, and
sending the remainder home, I should secure the means of pushing my
researches to the end of December, before which time I hoped,
(however much it had pleased Providence to stay my progress
hitherto,) to have performed my task, or penetrated the heartless
desert before me, to such a distance as would leave no doubt as to
the question I had been directed to solve.</p>

<p>The old man left us on the 17th with the promise of returning,
and from the careful manner in which he concealed the different
things that had been given to him I thought he would have done so,
but we never saw him more, and I cannot but think that he perished
from the want of water in endeavouring to return to his
kindred.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly remarked that we had been deserted by all the
feathered tribes. Not only was this the case, but we had witnessed
a second migration of the later broods; after these were gone,
there still remained with us about fifty of the common kites and as
many crows: these birds continued with us for the offals of the
sheep, and had become exceedingly tame; the kites in particular
came flying from the trees when a whistle was sounded, to the great
amusement of the men, who threw up pieces of meat for them to catch
before they fell to the ground. When the old man first came to us,
we fed him on mutton, but one of the men happening to shoot a crow,
he shewed such a decided preference for it, that he afterwards
lived almost exclusively upon them. He was, as I have stated, when
he first came to us a thin and emaciated being, but at the
expiration of a fortnight when he rose to depart, he threw off his
blanket and exhibited a condition that astonished us all. He was
absolutely fat, and yet his face did not at all indicate such a
change. If he had been fed in the dark like capons, he could not
have got into better condition. Mr. Browne was anxious to accompany
him, but I thought that if his suspicions were aroused he would not
return, and I therefore let him depart as he came. With him all our
hopes vanished, for even the presence of that savage was soothing
to us, and so long as he remained, we indulged in anticipations as
to the future. From the time of his departure a gloomy silence
pervaded the camp; we were, indeed, placed under the most trying
circumstances; every thing combined to depress our spirits and
exhaust our patience. We had gradually been deserted by every beast
of the field, and every fowl of the air. We had witnessed migration
after migration of the feathered tribes, to that point to which we
were so anxious to push our way. Flights of cockatoos, of parrots,
of pigeons, and of bitterns, birds also whose notes had cheered us
in the wilderness, all had taken the same high road to a better and
more hospitable region. The vegetable kingdom was at a stand, and
there was nothing either to engage the attention or attract the
eye. Our animals had laid the ground bare for miles around the
camp, and never came towards it but to drink. The axe had made a
broad gap in the line of gum-trees which ornamented the creek, and
had destroyed its appearance. We had to witness the gradual and
fearful diminution of the water, on the possession of which our
lives depended; day after day we saw it sink lower and lower,
dissipated alike by the sun and the winds. From its original depth
of nine feet, it now scarcely measured two, and instead of
extending from bank to bank it occupied only a narrow line in the
centre of the channel. Had the drought continued for a month longer
than it pleased the Almighty to terminate it, that creek would have
been as dry as the desert on either side. Almost heart-broken, Mr.
Browne and I seldom left our tents, save to visit our sick
companion. Mr. Browne had for some time been suffering great pain
in his limbs, but with a generous desire to save me further anxiety
carefully concealed it from me; but it was his wont to go to some
acacia trees in the bed of the creek to swing on their branches, as
he told me to exercise his muscles, in the hope of relaxing their
rigidity.</p>

<p>One day, when I was sitting with Mr. Poole, he suggested the
erection of two stations, one on the Red Hill and the other on the
Black Hill, as points for bearings when we should leave the Depot.
The idea had suggested itself to me, but I had observed that we
soon lost sight of the hills in going to the north-west; and that,
therefore, for such a purpose, the works would be of little use,
but to give the men occupation; and to keep them in health I
employed them in erecting a pyramid of stones on the summit of the
Red Hill. It is twenty-one feet at the base, and eighteen feet
high, and bears 329 degrees from the camp, or 31 degrees to the
west of north. I little thought when I was engaged in that work,
that I was erecting Mr. Poole's monument, but so it was, that rude
structure looks over his lonely grave, and will stand for ages as a
record of all we suffered in the dreary region to which we were so
long confined.</p>

<p>The months of May and June, and the first and second weeks of
July passed over our heads, yet there was no indication of a change
of weather. It had been bitterly cold during parts of this period,
the thermometer having descended to 24 degrees; thus making the
difference between the extremes of summer heat and winter's cold no
less than 133 degrees.</p>

<p>About the middle of June I had the drays put into serviceable
condition, the wheels wedged up, and every thing prepared for
moving away.</p>

<p>Anxious to take every measure to prevent unnecessary delay, when
the day of liberation should arrive, I had sent Mr. Stuart and Mr.
Piesse, with a party of chainers, to measure along the line on
which I intended to move when the Depot was broken up. I had
determined, as I have elsewhere informed the reader, to penetrate
to the westward, in the hope of finding Lake Torrens connected with
some more extensive and more central body of water; and I thought
it would be satisfactory to ascertain, as nearly as possible, the
distance of that basin from the Darling, and in so doing to unite
the eastern and western surveys. I had assumed Sir Thomas
Mitchell's position at Williorara as correct, and had taken the
most careful bearings from that point to the Depot, and the
position in which they fixed it differed but little from the result
of the many lunars I took during my stay there. As I purpose giving
the elements of all my calculations, those more qualified than
myself to judge on these matters, will correct me if I have been in
error; but, as the mean of my lunars was so close to the majority
of the single lunars, I cannot think they are far from the truth.
Be that as it may, I assumed my position at the Depot to be in lat.
29 degrees 40 minutes 14 seconds S. and in long. 141 degrees 29
minutes 41 seconds E., the variation being 5 degrees 14 minutes
East. Allowing for the variation, I directed Mr. Stuart to run the
chain line on a bearing of 55 degrees to the west of north, which I
intended to cut a little to the west of the park-like and grassy
plain at the termination of the creek I had traced in that
direction. By supplying the party with water from the camp, I
enabled them to prolong the line to 30 miles.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June I commenced my preparations for moving; not
that I had any reason so to do, but because I could not bring
myself to believe that the drought would continue much longer. The
felloes and spokes of the wheels of the drays had shrunk to
nothing, and it was with great difficulty that we wedged them up;
but the boat, which had been so long exposed to an ardent sun, had,
to appearance at least, been but little injured.</p>

<p>As it became necessary to point out the drays that were to go
with the home returning party, I was obliged to break my intentions
to Mr. Poole, who I also proposed sending in charge of them. He was
much affected, but, seeing the necessity of the measure, said that
he was ready to obey my orders in all things. I directed Mr. Piesse
to weigh out and place apart the supplies that would be required
for Mr. Poole and his men, and to pack the provisions we should
retain in the most compact order. On examining our bacon we found
that it had lost more than half its weight, and had now completely
saturated the bran in which it had been packed. Our flour had lost
more than 8 per cent., and the tea in a much greater
proportion.</p>

<p>The most valuable part of our stock were the sheep, they had
kept in excellent condition, and seldom weighed less than 55 lbs.
or 65 lbs.; but their flesh was perfectly tasteless. Still they
were a most valuable stock, and we had enough remaining to give the
men a full allowance; for the parties employed on detached
excursions, could only take a day or two's supply with them, and in
consequence a quantity of back rations, if I may so term them, were
constantly accumulating.</p>

<p>Mr. Poole's reduced state of health rendered it necessary that a
dray should be prepared for his transport, and I requested Mr.
Browne to superintend every possible arrangement for his comfort. A
dray was accordingly lined with sheep skins, and had a flannel
tilt, as the nights were exceedingly cold, and he could not be
moved to a fire. I had also a swing cot made, with pullies to raise
him up when he should feel disposed to change his position.</p>

<p>Whilst these necessary preparations were being forwarded, I was
engaged writing my public despatches.</p>

<p>In my communication to the Governor of South Australia, I
expressed a desire that a supply of provisions might be forwarded
to Williorara by the end of December, about which period I hoped I
should be on my return from the interior. I regretted exceedingly
putting her Majesty's Government to this additional cost, but I
trust a sufficient excuse will have been found for me in the
foregoing pages. I would rather that my bones had been left to
bleach in that desert than have yielded an inch of the ground I had
gained at so much expense and trouble.</p>

<p>The 27th of June completed the fifth month of our detention at
the Depot, and the prospect of our removal appeared to be as
distant as ever; there were, it is true, more clouds, but they
passed over us without breaking. The month of July, however, opened
with every indication of a change, the sky was generally overcast,
and although we had been so often disappointed, I had a
presentiment that the then appearances would not vanish without
rain.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Poole, whose health on the whole was
improving, had a severe attack of inflammation, which Mr. Browne
subdued with great difficulty. After this attack he became
exceedingly restless, and expressed a desire to be moved from the
tent in which he had so long been confined, to the underground
room, but as that rude apartment was exceedingly cold at night, I
thought it advisable to have a chimney built to it before he was
taken there. It was not until the 12th that it was ready for him.
As the men were carrying him across the camp towards the room he
was destined to occupy for so short a time, I pointed out the
pyramid to him, and it is somewhat singular, that the first drops
of rain, on the continuance of which our deliverance depended, fell
as the men were bearing him along.</p>

<p>Referring back to the early part of the month, I may observe
that the indications of a breaking up of the drought, became every
day more apparent.</p>

<p>It was now clear, indeed, that the sky was getting surcharged
with moisture, and it is impossible for me to describe the intense
anxiety that prevailed in the camp. On the morning of the 3rd the
firmament was again cloudy, but the wind shifted at noon to west,
and the sun set in a sky so clear that we could hardly believe it
had been so lately overcast. On the following morning he rose
bright and clear as he had set, and we had a day of surpassing
fineness, like a spring day in England.</p>

<p>The night of the 6th was the coldest night we experienced at the
Depot, when the thermometer descended to 24 degrees. On the 7th a
south wind made the barometer rise to 30 degrees 180 minutes, and
with it despair once more stared us in the face, for with the wind
in that quarter there was no hope of rain. On the 8th it still blew
heavily from the south, and the barometer rose to 30 degrees 200
minutes; but the evening was calm and frosty, and the sky without a
cloud. I may be wearying my reader, by entering thus into the
particulars of every change that took place in the weather at this,
to us, intensely anxious period, but he must excuse me; my
narrative may appear dull, and should not have been intruded on the
notice of the public, had I not been influenced by a sense of duty
to all concerned.</p>

<p>No one but those who were with me at that trying time and in
that fearful solitude, can form an idea of our feelings. To
continue then, on the morning of the 9th it again blew fresh from
the south, the sky was cloudless even in the direction of Mount
Serle, and all appearance of rain had passed away.</p>

<p>On the 10th, to give a change to the current of my thoughts, and
for exercise, I walked down the Depot creek with Mr. Browne, and
turning northwards up the main branch when we reached the junction
of the two creeks, we continued our ramble for two or three miles.
I know not why it was, that, on this occasion more than any other,
we should have contemplated the scene around us, unless it was that
the peculiar tranquillity of the moment made a greater impression
on our minds. Perhaps the death-like silence of the scene at that
moment led us to reflect, whilst gazing on the ravages made by the
floods, how fearfully that silence must sometimes be broken by the
roar of waters and of winds. Here, as in other places, we observed
the trunks of trees swept down from the hills, lodged high in the
branches of the trees in the neighbourhood of the creek, and large
accumulations of rubbish lying at their butts, whilst the line of
inundation extended so far into the plains that the country must on
such occasions have the appearance of an inland sea. The winds on
the other hand had stripped the bark from the trees to windward (a
little to the south of west), as if it had been shaved off with an
instrument, but during our stay at the Depot we had not experienced
any unusual visitation, as a flood really would have been; for any
torrent, such as that which it was evident sometimes swells the
creek, would have swept us from our ground, since the marks of
inundation reached more than a mile beyond our encampment, and the
trunk of a large gum-tree was jambed between the branches of one
overhanging the creek near us at an altitude exceeding the height
of our tents.</p>

<p>On the 11th the wind shifted to the east, the whole sky becoming
suddenly overcast, and on the morning of the 12th it was still at
east, but at noon veered round to the north, when a gentle rain set
in, so gentle that it more resembled a mist, but this continued all
the evening and during the night. It ceased however at 10 a.m. of
the 13th, when the wind shifted a little to the westward of north.
At noon rain again commenced, and fell steadily throughout the
night, but although the ground began to feel the effects of it,
sufficient had not fallen to enable us to move. Yet, how thankful
was I for this change, and how earnestly did I pray that the
Almighty would still farther extend his mercy to us, when I laid my
head on my pillow. All night it poured down without any
intermission, and as morning dawned the ripple of waters in a
little gully close to our tents, was a sweeter and more soothing
sound than the softest melody I ever heard. On going down to the
creek in the morning I found that it had risen five inches, and the
ground was now so completely saturated that I no longer doubted the
moment of our liberation had arrived.</p>

<p>I had made every necessary preparation for Mr. Poole's departure
on the 13th, and as the rain ceased on the morning of the 14th the
home returning party mustered to leave us. Mr. Poole felt much when
I went to tell him that the dray in which he was to be conveyed,
was ready for his reception. I did all that I could to render his
mind easy on every point, and allowed him to select the most quiet
and steady bullocks for the dray he was to occupy; together with
the most careful driver in the party. I also consented to his
taking Joseph, who was the best man I had, to attend personally
upon him, and Mr. Browne put up for his use all the little comforts
we could spare. I cheered him with the hope of returning to meet us
after we should have terminated our labours, and assured him that I
considered his services on the duty I was about to send him as
valuable and important as if he continued with me. He was lifted on
his stretcher into the dray, and appeared gratified at the manner
in which it had been arranged. I was glad to see that his feelings
did not give way at this painful moment; on my ascending the dray,
however, to bid him adieu, he wept bitterly, but expressed his hope
that we should succeed in our enterprise.</p>

<p>As I knew his mind would be agitated, and that his greatest
trial would be on the first day, I requested Mr. Browne to
accompany him, and to return to me on the following day. On Mr.
Poole's departure I prepared for our own removal, and sent Flood
after the horses, but having an abundance of water everywhere, they
had wandered, and he returned with them too late for me to move. He
said, that in crossing the rocky range he heard a roaring noise,
and that on going to the glen he saw the waters pouring down,
foaming and eddying amongst the rocks, adding that he was sure the
floods would be down upon us ere long. An evident proof that
however light the rain appeared to be, an immense quantity must
have fallen, and I could not but hope and believe that it had been
general.</p>

<p>Before we left the Depot Flood's prediction was confirmed, and
the channel which, if the drought had continued a few days longer,
would have been perfectly waterless, was thus suddenly filled up to
the brim; no stronger instance of the force of waters in these
regions can be adduced than this, no better illustration of the
character of the creeks can be given. The head of the Depot creek
was not more than eight miles from us, its course to its junction
with the main creek was not ten, yet it was a watercourse that
without being aware of its commencement or termination might have
been laid down by the traveller as a river. Such however is the
uncertain nature of the rivers of those parts of the continent of
Australia over which I have wandered. I would not trust the largest
farther than the range of vision; they are deceptive all of them,
the offsprings of heavy rains, and dependent entirely on local
circumstances for their appearance and existence.</p>

<p>Having taken all our circumstances into consideration, our
heart-breaking detention, the uncertainty that involved our future
proceedings, and the ceaseless anxiety of mind to which we should
be subjected, recollecting also that Mr. Browne had joined me for a
limited period only, and that a protracted journey might injure his
future prospects, I felt that it was incumbent on me to give him
the option of returning with Mr. Poole if he felt disposed to do
so, but he would not desert me, and declined all my
suggestions.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th I struck the tents, which had stood
for six months less eleven days, and turned my back on the Depot in
grateful thankfulness for our release from a spot where my feelings
and patience had been so severely tried. When we commenced our
journey, we found that our progress would be slow, for the ground
was dreadfully heavy, and the bullocks, so long unaccustomed to
draught, shrunk from their task. One of the drays stuck in the
little gully behind our camp, and we were yet endeavouring to get
it out, when Mr. Browne returned from his attendance on Mr. Poole,
and I was glad to find that he had left him in tolerable spirits,
and with every hope of his gradual improvement.</p>

<p>As we crossed the creek, between the Depot and the glen, we
found that the waters, as Flood predicted, had descended so far,
and waded through them to the other side. We then rode to the glen,
to see how it looked under such a change, and remained some time
watching the current as it swept along.</p>

<p>On our return to the party I found that it would be impossible
to make a lengthened journey; for, having parted with two drays, we
had necessarily been obliged to increase the loads on the others,
so that they sank deep into the ground. I therefore halted, after
having gone about four miles only.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock p.m. we were surprised by the sudden return
of Joseph, from the home returning party; but, still more so at the
melancholy nature of the information he had to communicate. Mr.
Poole, he said, had breathed his last at three o'clock. This sad
event necessarily put a stop to my movements, and obliged me to
consider what arrangements I should now have to make.</p>

<p>It appeared, from Joseph's account, that Mr. Poole had not shewn
any previous indications of approaching dissolution. About a
quarter before three he had risen to take some medicine, but
suddenly observed to Joseph that he thought he was dying, and
falling on his back, expired without a struggle.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of this day, and before we ourselves
started, I had sent Mr. Stuart and Mr. Piesse in advance with the
chainers, to carry on the chaining. On the morning of the 17th,
before I mounted my horse to accompany Mr. Browne to examine the
remains of our unfortunate companion, which I determined to inter
at the Depot, I sent a man to recall them.</p>

<p>The suddenness of Mr. Poole's death surprised both Mr. Browne
and myself; but the singular fairness of his countenance left no
doubt on his mind but that internal haemorrhage had been the
immediate cause of that event.</p>

<p>On the 17th the whole party, which had so lately separated, once
more assembled at the Depot. We buried Mr. Poole under a Grevillia
that stood close to our underground room; his initials, and the
year, are cut in it above the grave, "J. P. 1845," and he now
sleeps in the desert.</p>

<p>The sad event I have recorded, obliged me most reluctantly to
put Mr. Piesse in charge of the home returning party, for I had had
every reason to be satisfied with him, and I witnessed his
departure with regret. A more trustworthy, or a more anxious
officer could not have been attached to such a service as that in
which he was employed.</p>

<p>The funeral of Mr. Poole was a fitting close to our residence at
the Depot. At the conclusion of that ceremony the party again
separated, and I returned to my tent, to prepare for moving on the
morrow.</p>

<br>
<b>STURT'S EXPEDITION INTO CENTRAL AUSTRALIA, 1844-5-6</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>At 9 a.m. accordingly of the 18th we pushed on to the N.W. The
ground had become much harder, but the travelling was still heavy.
At three miles we passed a small creek, about seven miles from the
Depot, at which I intended to have halted on leaving that place. We
passed over stony plains, or low, sandy, and swampy ground, since
the valleys near the hills opened out as we receded from them. On
the 19th I kept the chained line, but in consequence of the heavy
state of the ground we did not get on more than 8&frac12; miles. The
character of the country was that of open sandy plains, the sand
being based upon a stiff, tenacious clay, impervious to water. With
the exception of a few salsolae and atriplex, the plains were
exceedingly bare, and had innumerable patches of water over them,
not more than two or three inches deep. At intervals pure sand
hills occurred, on which there were a few stunted casuarina and
mimosae, but a good deal of grass and thousands of young plants
already springing up. As the ground was still very soft, I should
not have moved on the 20th, but was anxious to push on. Early in
the day, and at less than 18 miles from the hills, we encountered
the sandy ridges, and found the pull over them much worse than over
the flats. The wheels of the drays sank deep into the ground, and
in straining to get them clear we broke seven yokes. Two flights of
swans, and a small flight of ducks, passed over our heads at dusk,
coming from the W.N.W. The brushes were full of the Calodera, but
being very wild we could not procure a specimen.</p>

<p>The chainers had no difficulty in keeping pace with us, and on
the 26th we found ourselves in lat. 29 degrees 6 minutes, having
then chained 61 miles on a bearing of 55 degrees to the west of
north, as originally determined upon. Finding that I had thus
passed to the south-west of the grassy plain, I halted, and rode
with Flood to the eastward; when at seven miles we descended into
it, and finding that there was an abundance of water in the creek
(the channel we had before noticed), I returned to Mr. Browne; but
as it was late in the afternoon when we regained the tents, we did
not move that evening, and the succeeding day being Sunday we also
remained stationary. We had halted close to one of those clear
patches on which the rain water lodges, but it had dried up, and
there was only a little for our use in a small gutter not far
distant. Whilst we were here encamped a little jerboa was chased by
the dogs into a hole close to the drays; which, with four others,
we succeeded in capturing, by digging for them. This beautiful
little animal burrows in the ground like a mouse, but their
habitations have several passages, leading straight, like the radii
of a circle, to a common centre, to which a shaft is sunk from
above, so that there is a complete circulation of air along the
whole. We fed our little captives on oats, on which they thrived,
and became exceedingly tame. They generally huddled together in a
corner of their box, but, when darting from one side to the other,
they hopped on their hind legs, which, like the kangaroo, were much
longer than the fore, and held the tail perfectly straight and
horizontal. At this date they were a novelty to us, but we
subsequently saw great numbers of them, and ascertained that the
natives frequented the sandy ridges in order to procure them for
food. Those we succeeded in capturing were, I am sorry to say, lost
from neglect.</p>

<p>On Monday I conducted the whole party to the new depot, which
for the present I shall call the Park, but as I was very unwilling
that any more time should be lost in pushing to the west, I
instructed Mr. Stuart to change the direction of the chained line
to 75 degrees to the west of south, direct upon Mount Hopeless, and
to continue it until I should overtake him. In this operation Mr.
Browne kindly volunteered to assist Mr. Stuart, as the loss of Mr.
Piesse had so reduced my strength.</p>

<p>By the 30th I had arranged the camp in its new position, and
felt myself at liberty to follow after the chainers. Before I left,
however, I directed a stockyard to be made, in which to herd the
cattle at night, and instructed Davenport to prepare some ground
for a garden, with a view to planting it out with
vegetables&mdash;pumpkins and melons. I left the camp with Flood,
at 10 a.m. on the above day, judging that Mr. Browne was then about
42 miles a-head of me, and stopped for the night in a little
sheltered valley between two sand hills, after a ride of 28 miles.
The country continued unchanged. Valleys or flats, more or less
covered with water, alternated with sandy ridges, on some of which
there was no scarcity of grass.</p>

<p>We had not ridden far on the following morning when a partial
change was perceptible in the aspect of the country. The flats
became broader and the sand hills lower, but this change was
temporary. We gradually rose somewhat from the general level, and
crossed several sand hills, higher than any we had seen. These sand
hills had very precipitous sides and broken summits, and being of a
bright red colour, they looked in the distance like long lines of
dead brick walls, being perfectly bare, or sparingly covered with
spinifex at the base. They succeeded each other so rapidly, that it
was like crossing the tops of houses in some street; but they were
much steeper to the eastward than to the westward, and successive
gales appeared to have lowered them, and in some measure to have
filled up the intervening flats with the sand from their
summits.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August we did not find the country so heavy or so
wet as it had been. It was indeed so open and denuded of every
thing like a tree or bush, that we had some difficulty in finding
wood to boil our tea. In the afternoon when we halted the men had
chained 46 miles on the new bearing, but as yet we could not see
any range or hill to the westward.</p>

<p>About two hours before we halted Mr. Browne and I surprised some
natives on the top of a sand hill, two of them saw us approaching
and ran away, the third could not make his escape before we were
upon him, but he was dreadfully alarmed. In order to allay his
fears Mr. Browne dismounted and walked up to him, whilst I kept
back. On this the poor fellow began to dance, and to call out most
vehemently, but finding that all he could do was to no purpose he
sat down and began to cry. We managed however to pacify him, so
much that he mustered courage to follow us, with his two
companions, to our halting place. These wanderers of the desert had
their bags full of jerboas which they had captured on the hills.
They could not indeed have had less than from 150 to 200 of these
beautiful little animals, so numerous are they on the sand hills,
but it would appear that the natives can only go in pursuit of them
after a fall of rain, such as that we had experienced. There being
then water, the country, at other times impenetrable, is then
temporarily thrown open to them, and they traverse it in quest of
the jerboa and other quadrupeds. Our friends cooked all they had in
hot sand, and devoured them entire, fur, skin, entrails and all,
only breaking away the under jaw and nipping off the tail with
their teeth.</p>

<p>They absolutely managed before sunset to finish their whole
stock, and then took their departure, having, I suppose, gratified
both their appetite and their curiosity. They were all three
circumcised and spoke a different language from that of the hill
natives, and came, they told us, from the west.</p>

<p>As we advanced the country became extremely barren, and surface
water was very scarce, and the open ground, entirely denuded of
timber, wore the most desolate appearance. If we had hitherto been
in a region destitute of inhabitants it seemed as if we were now
getting into a more populous district. About noon of the 2nd, as
Mr. Browne and I were riding in front of the chainers, we heard a
shout to our right, and on looking in that direction saw a party of
natives assembled on a sand hill, to the number of fourteen. As we
advanced towards them they retreated, but at length made a stand as
if to await our approach. They were armed with spears, and on Mr.
Browne dismounting to walk towards them, formed themselves into a
circle, in the centre of which were two old men, round whom they
danced. Thinking that Mr. Browne might run some risk if he went
near, I called him back, and as I really had not time for
ceremonies, we rejoined the chainers, being satisfied also that if
the natives felt disposed to communicate with us, they would do so
of their own accord; nor was I mistaken in this, for, judging, I
suppose, from our leaving them that we did not meditate any
hostility, seven of their number followed us, and as Mr. Browne was
at that time in advance, I gave my horse to one of the men and
again went towards them, but it was with great difficulty that I
got them to a parley, after which they sat down and allowed me to
approach, though from the surprise they exhibited I imagine they
had never seen a white man before. They spoke a language different
from any I had heard, had lost two of the front teeth of the upper
jaw, and had large scars on the breast. I could not gather any
information from them, or satisfactorily ascertain from what
quarter they came; staying with them for a short time therefore,
and giving them a couple of knives I left them, and after following
abreast of us, for a mile or two, they also turned to the north,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The night of the 2nd August was exceedingly cold, with the wind
from the N.E. (an unusual quarter from which to have a low
temperature) and there was a thick hoar frost on the morning of the
3rd. Why the winds should have been so cold blowing from that
quarter, whence our hottest winds also came, it is difficult to
say; but at this season of the year, and in this line, they were
invariably so.</p>

<p>Near the flat on which we stopped on the evening of the 2nd
there was a hill considerably elevated above the others; which,
after unsaddling and letting out the horses, Mr. Browne and I were
induced to ascend. From it we saw a line of high and broken ranges
to the S.S.W. but they were very distant. At three and a half miles
from this point we crossed a salt water creek, having pools in it
of great depth, but so clear that we could see to the bottom; and
wherever our feet sank in the mud, salt water immediately oozed up.
There were some box-trees growing near this creek, which came from
the north, and fell towards the ranges. At half a mile further we
crossed a small fresh water creek, and intermediate between the two
was a lagoon of about a mile in length, but not more than three
inches in depth. This lagoon, if it might so be called, from its
size only, had been filled by the recent rains; but was so thick
and muddy, from being continually ruffled by the winds, that it was
unfit for use. The banks of the fresh water creek were crowded with
water-hens, similar to those which visited Adelaide in such
countless numbers the year before I proceeded into the interior
(1843). They were running about like so many fowls; but, on being
alarmed, took flight and went south.</p>

<p>The fresh water creek (across which it was an easy jump) joined
the salt water creek a little below where we struck it, and was the
first creek of the kind we had seen since we left the Depot, in a
distance of more than 100 miles, and up to this point we had
entirely subsisted on the surface water left by the rains. The
country we now passed through was of a salsolaceous character, like
a low barren sea coast. The sand hills were lower and broader than
they had been, and their sides were cut by deep fissures made by
heavy torrents. From a hill, about a mile from our halting place on
this day, we again saw the ranges, which had been sighted the day
before. South of us, and distant about a mile, there was a large
dry lagoon, white with salt, and another of a similar kind to the
west of it.</p>

<p>These changes in the character of the country convinced me that
we should soon arrive at some more important one. On the 4th we
advanced as usual on a bearing of 75 degrees to the west of south,
having then chained 65 miles upon it. At about three miles we
observed a sand hill in front of us, beyond which no land was to be
seen, as if the country dipped, and there was a great hollow. On
arriving at this sand hill our further progress westward was
checked by the intervention of an immense shallow and sandy basin,
upon which we looked down from the place where we stood. The hills
we had seen the day before were still visible through a good
telescope, but we could only distinguish their outlines; in
addition to them, however, there was a nearer flat-topped range,
more to the northward and westward of the main range, which latter
still bore S.S.W., and appeared to belong to a high and broken
chain of mountains. The sandy basin was from ten to twelve miles
broad, but destitute of water opposite to us, although there were,
both to the southward and northward, sheets of water as blue as
indigo and as salt as brine. These detached sheets were fringed
round with samphire bushes with which the basin was also speckled
over. There was a gradual descent of about a mile and a half, to
the margin of the basin, the intervening ground being covered with
low scrub. My first object was, to ascertain if we could cross this
feature, which extended southwards beyond the range of vision, but
turned to the westward in a northerly direction, in the shape in
which Mr. Eyre has laid Lake Torrens down. For this purpose Mr.
Browne and I descended into it. The bed was composed of sand and
clay, the latter lying in large masses, and deeply grooved by
torrents of rain. There was not any great quantity of salt to be
seen, but it was collected at the bottom of gutters, and, no doubt,
was more or less mixed with the soil. At about four miles we were
obliged to dismount; and, tying our horses so as to secure them,
walked on for another mile, when we found the ground too soft for
our weight and were obliged to return; and, as it was now late, we
commenced a search for water, and having found a small supply in a
little hollow, at a short distance from the flag, we went to it and
encamped. The length of the chain line to the flag staff was 70&frac34;
miles, which with the 61 we had measured from the Depot, made 131&frac34;
miles in all; the direct distance, therefore, from the Depot to the
flag staff, was about 115 miles, on a bearing of 9&frac12; degrees to the
North of West or W. &frac34; N.</p>

<p>My object in the journey I had thus undertaken, was not so much
to measure the distance between the two places, as to ascertain if
the country to the north-west of Lake Torrens, on the borders of
which I presumed I had arrived, was practicable or not, and whether
it was connected with any more central body of water. It behoved me
to ascertain these two points with as little delay as possible, for
the surface water was fast drying up, and we were in danger of
having our retreat cut off. Whether the country was practicable or
not, in the direction I was anxious to take, it was clear that I
could not have penetrated as far as I then was, with the heavy
drays, with any prudence.</p>

<p>To be more satisfied, however, as to the nature of the country
to the westward, I rode towards the N.E. angle of the Sandy Basin,
on the morning of the 4th, sending Mr. Stuart southwards, to
examine it in that direction; but, neither of these journeys
proving satisfactory, I determined on fixing the position of the
hills in reference to our chained line, and then return to the
Depot, to prepare for a more extensive exploration of the N.W.
interior. I found the country perfectly impracticable to the N.W.,
and that it was impossible to ascertain the real character of this
Sandy Basin. On the other side of it the country appeared to be
wooded; beyond the wood there was a sudden fall; and, as far as I
could judge, this singular feature must have been connected with
Spencer's Gulf, before the passage that evidently existed once
between them, was filled up....</p>

<p>To that man who is really earnest in the performance of his duty
to the last, and who has set his heart on the accomplishment of a
great object, the attainment of which would place his name high up
in the roll of Fame; to him who had well nigh reached the topmost
step of the ladder, and whose hand had all but grasped the
pinnacle, the necessity must be great, and the struggle of feeling
severe, that forces him to bear back, and abandon his task.</p>

<p>Let any man lay the map of Australia before him, and regard the
blank upon its surface, and then let me ask him if it would not be
an honourable achievement to be the first to place foot in its
centre.</p>

<p>Men of undoubted perseverance and energy in vain had tried to
work their way to that distant and shrouded spot. A veil hung over
Central Australia that could neither be pierced or raised. Girt
round about by deserts, it almost appeared as if Nature had
intentionally closed it upon civilized man, that she might have one
domain on the earth's wide field over which the savage might roam
in freedom.</p>

<p>I had traced down almost every inland river of the continent,
and had followed their courses for hundreds of miles, but, they had
not led me to its central regions. I had run the Castlereagh, the
Macquarie, the Lachlan, the Murrumbidgee, the Hume, the Darling,
and the Murray down to their respective terminations, but beyond
them I had not passed&mdash;yet&mdash;I looked upon Central
Australia as a legitimate field, to explore which no man had a
greater claim than myself, and the first wish of my heart was to
close my services in the cause of Geography by dispelling the mists
that hung over it.</p>

<p>True it is that my friend Eyre had penetrated high up to the
north of Mount Arden, and there can be no doubt but that his ardent
and chivalrous spirit would have carried him far beyond the point
he attained, if he had not met unconquerable difficulties. I
thought that a cooler and more leisurely progress would enable me
to feel my way into a country, whose inhospitable character
developed itself more the more it was penetrated. I had adopted
certain opinions, the correctness of which I was anxious to test,
and I thought the investigations I desired to make, were not only
worthy the pursuit of private ambition, but deserving the attention
of Her Majesty's Government. With these feelings I could not but be
grateful to Lord Stanley, for having entertained my proposition,
and given me an opportunity to distinguish myself. It is not
because his Lordship is no longer at the head of the Colonial
Office, that I should refrain from making my acknowledgments to
him, and expressing the sense I entertain of the obligation under
which he has laid me. It so happened that the course pointed out to
me by Lord Stanley, and that in which I desired to go, were the
same, and I had hoped that in following up my instructions, I
should ultimately have gained the spot I so ardently desired to
reach, and to have left the flag of my native country flying over
it.</p>

<p>The feelings then with which I returned to the creek after the
failure of our last attempt to penetrate to the north may well be
imagined. I returned to it, as I have said, with perhaps a sullen
determination to stand out the drought; but, on calm reflection, I
found that I could not do so. I could not indeed hide from myself
that in the course of a few days my retreat to the Depot would
unavoidably be cut off if rain should not fall. Looking to the
chance of our being delayed until our provisions should be
consumed, and to the fact that we could not expect to get back to
the Depot in less than three weeks, and that I could not hope for
any amendment either in Mr. Browne or my men, so long as they were
confined to the scanty diet we then had. I determined on my return
to the Park, thence to take out fresh hands, and to make another
attempt to penetrate across the Desert in some other direction;
but, as this measure, like our detention at the Depot, would
involve a great loss of time, I proposed to myself again to divide
the party, and to send Mr. Browne home with all the men, except Mr.
Stuart and two others. I saw no objection to such a course, and
certainly did not anticipate any opposition to it on the part of my
companion. I resolved then, with a due regard to his state, to
retrace my steps with all possible expedition; and, accordingly,
directed that everything should be prepared for our retreat on the
morning of the 14th, for the sky had cleared, and all prospect of
rain had again vanished. Although we were here so close to the
Tropic, the climate was not oppressive. The general temperature
after noon was 84 degrees, the morning 46 degrees. The prevailing
wind was from S.S.E. to E.S.E. and it was invariably cold; at least
we felt it so, and I regretted to observe, that in Mr. Browne's
case it caused a renewed attack of violent pains in the muscles and
joints, from which he had before been somewhat free. It is also
remarkable, that up to this distant point, no material change had
taken place in the character of the vegetation; with the exception
of the few trees and plants I have mentioned the herbage of these
sterile regions, and of the Darling were essentially the same, only
with this difference, that here they were all more or less stunted,
whereas, in the month of October, when we passed up the Darling,
they were only just flowering, now in the month of September they
had ripened their seed.</p>

<p>Before we commenced our journey back to the Depot, I named this
"Eyre's Creek". No doubt it is an important feature in the country
where it exists. Like the other creeks, however, it rises in
plains, and either terminates in such or falls into the Stony
Desert. There can be no doubt, however, that to any one desiring to
cross the continent to the north, Eyre's Creek would afford great
facilities; and if the traveller happened fortunately to arrive on
it at a favourable moment he would have every chance of
success.</p>

<p>For twelve miles below the salt lagoon there is not a blade of
grass either in the bed of the creek or on the neighbouring flats,
the soil of both being a stiff cold clay. We passed this ungenial
line, therefore, and encamped near a fine pool of water, where both
our own wants and those of our horses, as far as feed and water
went, were abundantly supplied.</p>

<p>In going along one of the flats, before we discovered the creek,
Mr. Browne and I had chased a Dipus into a hollow log, and there
secured it. This pretty animal we put into a box; but as it
appeared to eat but little grass, we gave it some small birds,
which it always devoured at night. Our dogs had killed one on the
banks of the Darling, but had so mutilated it, that we could not
preserve it. We hoped, however, to keep this animal alive, and up
to the present time there was every chance of our doing so. It was
an exceedingly pretty animal, of a light grey colour, having a long
tail, feathered at the end, insectivorous, and not marsupial. On
the 16th we turned from the creek to the south, and passed down the
long flat up which we had previously come. On the following day we
passed several of the hollows scraped by the natives, and in one of
them found a little water, that must have accumulated in it from
the drizzly showers that fell on the night of the 8th, and which
might have been heavier here than with us. On the 19th we arrived
at the creek where Flood's horse was lost, but could not make out
any track to betray that he had been to water, and as there was not
enough remaining in the pond for our use, we crossed the plain,
over which we had had so much difficulty in travelling, and halted
for a short time at the native well, out of which numbers of birds
flew as we approached. From the Box-tree Forest we pushed on down
the polygonum flat, where we had seen the native woman who had
secreted herself in the bush. A whole family was now in the same
place, but an old man only approached us. We were, indeed, passing,
when he called to us, expressly for the purpose of telling us that
the horse (Flood's) had gone away to the eastward. This native came
out of his way, and evidently under considerable alarm, to tell us
this, and to point out the direction in which he had gone, Our
stock of presents being pretty nearly exhausted, Mr. Browne, with
his characteristic good nature, gave him a striped handkerchief,
with which he was much pleased. As it was evident the poor horse
had kept along the edge of the Desert, and as he was a wandering
brute, not caring for companions, it was uncertain to what distance
he had rambled, I did not, therefore, lose time by attempting to
recover him. We were all of us sure that he would not face the
Stony Desert, but he may still be alive, and wandering over that
sterile country. We stopped for the night on the long channel near
the sandy rise where we had before rested, about ten miles short of
our camp, and the trees on the muddy plain; and having effected our
passage across that plain and the Stony Desert, over which it was
with extreme difficulty that we kept our track, found ourselves on
the 22nd, in the little grassy valley, from which we had entered
upon it; little water was remaining, however, at the place where we
had then stopped, so that I sent over to the sequestered spot Lewis
had discovered, but the water there had entirely disappeared. Flood
managed to shoot a couple of ducks (Teal), of which there were four
or five that flew away to the south-east. These two birds were, I
may truly say, a God-send, and I beg to assure the reader they were
uncommonly good.</p>

<p>From this valley we had to cross the heavy sand ridges which had
so fatigued our horses before, and I hardly expected we should find
water nearer than the Fish Pond. We therefore started early to get
over the distance as soon as possible, and, as on the outward
journey, had a most severe task of it. The ridges were certainly
most formidable, although they were not of such size as those from
which we had retreated. At six miles we crossed the salt lagoon,
and late in the afternoon descended to the box-tree forest before
mentioned, having the grassy plains now upon the left-hand side.
The sandy ridges overlooked these plains, so that in riding along
we noticed some natives, seven in number, collecting grass seeds
upon them, on which alone, it appears to me, they subsist at this
season of the year. However, as soon as they saw us, they all ran
away in more than usual alarm, perhaps from the recollection of our
misunderstanding with Mr. Popinjay. Their presence, however,
assured us that there must be water somewhere about, and as on
entering the plain, more to the west than before, we struck on a
track, I directed Mr. Browne to run it down, who, at about
half-a-mile, came to a large well similar to that in the creek on
the other side of the Stony Desert, but not of the same dimensions.
We had lost sight of him for some little time, when suddenly his
horse made his appearance without a rider, and caused me great
anxiety for the moment, for my mind immediately reverted to our
sulky friend, and my fears were at once raised that my young
companion had been speared; riding on, therefore, I came at length
to the well, down which, to my inexpressible relief, I saw Mr.
Browne, who was examining it, and who came out on my calling to
him. There was not sufficient water to render it worth our while to
stop; but the well being nine feet deep, shewed the succession of
strata as follows: four feet of good alluvial soil; three feet of
white clay; and two feet of sea sand.</p>

<p>I should perhaps have been more particular in the description of
our interview with the old man and his family on the northern side
of the earthy plain. As I have stated, he called out to us, and in
order to discover what he wanted, I held Mr. Browne's horse, while
he dismounted and went to him. The old native would not, however,
sit down, but pointed to the S.E. as the direction in which, as far
as we could understand, the horse, "cadli" (dog), as he called him,
the only large four-legged brute of which he knew any thing, had
gone. The poor fellow cried, and the tears rolled down his cheeks
when he first met Mr. Browne, and the women chanted a most
melancholy air during the time we remained, to keep the evil
spirits off, I suppose; but they had nothing to fear from us, if
they could only have known it. This confusion of tongues is a sad
difficulty in travelling the wilds of Australia. Both the old man
and the women wanted the two front teeth of the upper jaw, and as
the former had worn his down almost to a level with his gums like
an old horse, he looked sadly disfigured.</p>

<p>We halted about three miles short of the place at which we had
before stopped, but as Joseph followed some pigeons to a clump of
trees across the plain at about a mile distance, and there found a
small pond of water, we moved over to it, and remained stationary
on the following day to rest our wearied animals.</p>

<p>The 24th again saw us at the Fish Pond, where Mr. Browne again
exhibited his skill in the gentle craft, and caught a good dish of
the finny tribe. The mystery as to how these fish could have got
into so isolated a spot, was not yet cleared up, and I was really
puzzled on the subject.</p>

<p>On the 27th, as we were crossing the country between the creeks,
some natives came in from the north and called out to us, in
consequence of which Mr. Browne and I rode up to them. They were in
a sad state of suffering from the want of water; their lips
cracked, and their tongues swelled. They had evidently lingered at
some place or other, until all the water, intermediate between them
and the creeks had dried up. The little water we had was not
sufficient to allay their thirst, so they left us, and at a sharp
trot disappeared over the sand hill.</p>

<p>On the 29th our journey over the sandy ridges was very
distressing. They appeared to me to be much more numerous, and the
valleys between them much more sandy than when we first passed over
them, and were thickly covered with spinifex, although grass was
also tolerably abundant in the flats. At this stage of our journey,
I was the only one of the party who was not ill; Mr. Browne and all
the men were suffering, added to which, the men were fairly knocked
up. Their labours were now, however, drawing to a close, and I was
only too thankful, that I retained my strength....</p>

<p>By half past eleven of the 9th November we had again got quietly
settled, and I then found leisure to make such arrangements as
might suggest themselves for our further retreat. To insure the
safety of the animals as much as possible, I determined to leave
all my spare provisions and weightier stores behind, and during the
afternoon we were engaged making the loads as compact and as light
as we could.</p>

<p>It was not, however, the fear of the water in Strzelecki's Creek
having dried up, that was at this moment the only cause of anxiety
to me, for I thought it more than probable that Mr. Browne had been
obliged to retreat from Fort Grey, in which case I should still
have a journey before me to the old Depot of 170 miles or more,
under privations, to the horses at least, of no ordinary character;
and I had great doubts as to the practicability of our final
retreat upon the Darling. The drought had now continued so long,
and the heat been so severe, that I apprehended we might be obliged
to remain another summer in these fearful solitudes. The weather
was terrifically hot, and appeared to have set in unusually
early.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, and with so many causes to render my
mind anxious, the reader will believe I did not sleep much. The men
were as restless as myself, so that we commenced our journey before
the sun had risen on the morning of the 10th of November, to give
the horses time to take their journey leisurely. Slowly we retraced
our steps, nor did I stop for a moment until we had got to within
five miles of our destination, at which distance we saw a single
native running after us, and taking it into my head that he might
be a messenger from Mr. Browne, I pulled up to wait for him, but
curiosity alone had induced him to come forward. When he got to
within a hundred yards, he stopped and approached no nearer. This
little delay made it after sunset before we reached the upper pool
(not the one Mr. Browne and I had discovered), and were relieved
from present anxiety by finding a thick puddle still remaining in
it, so that I halted for the night. Slommy, Bawley, and the colt
had hard work to keep up with the other horses, and it really
grieved me to see them so reduced. My own horse was even now
beginning to give way, but I had carried a great load upon him.</p>

<p>As we approached the water, three ducks flew up and went off
down the creek southwards, so I was cheered all night by the hope
that water still remained at the lower pool, and that we should be
in time to benefit by it. On the 11th, therefore, early we pushed
on, as I intended to stop and breakfast at that place before I
started for the Depot. We had scarcely got there, however, when the
wind, which had been blowing all the morning hot from the N.E.,
increased to a heavy gale, and I shall never forget its withering
effect. I sought shelter behind a large gum-tree, but the blasts of
heat were so terrific, that I wondered the very grass did not take
fire. This really was nothing ideal: every thing, both animate and
inanimate, gave way before it; the horses stood with their backs to
the wind, and their noses to the ground, without the muscular
strength to raise their heads; the birds were mute, and the leaves
of the trees, under which we were sitting, fell like a snow shower
around us. At noon I took a thermometer, graduated to 127 degrees,
out of my box, and observed that the mercury was up to 125 degrees.
Thinking that it had been unduly influenced, I put it in the fork
of a tree close to me, sheltered alike from the wind and the sun.
In this position I went to examine it about an hour afterwards,
when I found that the mercury had risen to the top of the
instrument, and that its further expansion had burst the bulb, a
circumstance that I believe no traveller has ever before had to
record. I cannot find language to convey to the reader's mind an
idea of the intense and oppressive nature of the heat that
prevailed. We had reached our destination however before the worst
of the hot wind set in; but all the water that now remained in the
once broad and capacious pool to which I have had such frequent
occasion to call the attention of the reader, was a shining patch
of mud nearly in the centre. We were obliged to dig a trench for
the water to filter into during the night, and by this means
obtained a scanty supply for our horses and ourselves.</p>

<p>About sunset the wind shifted to the west, a cloud passed over
us, and we had heavy thunder; but a few drops of rain only fell.
They partially cooled the temperature, and the night was less
oppressive than the day had been. We had now a journey of 86 miles
before us: to its results I looked with great anxiety and doubt. I
took every precaution to fortify the horses, and again reduced the
loads, keeping barely a supply of flour for a day or two. Before
dawn we were up, and drained the last drop of water, if so it could
be called, out of the little trench we had made, and reserving a
gallon for the first horse that should fall, divided the residue
among them. Just as the morning was breaking, we left the creek,
and travelled for 36 miles. I then halted until the moon should
rise, and was glad to see that the horses stood it well. At seven
we resumed the journey, and got on tolerably well until midnight,
when poor Bawley, my favourite horse, fell; but we got him up
again, and abandoning his saddle, proceeded onwards. At a mile,
however, he again fell, when I stopped, and the water revived him.
I now hoped he would struggle on, but in about an hour he again
fell. I was exceedingly fond of this poor animal, and intended to
have purchased him at the sale of the remnants of the expedition,
as a present to my wife. We sat down and lit a fire by him, but he
seemed fairly worn out. I then determined to ride on to the Depot,
and if Mr. Browne should still be there, to send a dray with water
to the relief of the men. I told them, therefore, to come slowly
on, and with Mr. Stuart pushed for the camp. We reached the plain
just as the sun was descending, without having dismounted from our
horses for more than fifteen hours, and as we rode down the
embankment into it, looked around for the cattle, but none were to
be seen. We looked towards the little sandy mound on which the
tents had stood, but no white object there met our eye; we rode
slowly up to the stockade, and found it silent and deserted. I was
quite sure that Mr. Browne had had urgent reasons for retiring. I
had indeed anticipated the measure: I hardly hoped to find him at
the Fort, and had given him instructions on the subject of his
removal, yet a sickening feeling came over me when I saw that he
was really gone; not on my own account, for, with the bitter
feelings of disappointment with which I was returning home, I could
calmly have laid my head on that desert, never to raise it again.
The feeling was natural, and had no mixture whatever of reproach
towards my excellent companion.</p>

<p>We dismounted and led our horses down to water before I went to
the tree under which I had directed Mr. Browne to deposit a letter
for me. A good deal of water still remained in the channel, but
nevertheless a large pit had been dug in it as I had desired. I did
not drink, nor did Mr. Stuart, the surface of the water was quite
green, and the water itself was of a red colour, but I believe we
were both thinking of any thing but ourselves at that moment. As
soon as we had unsaddled the horses, we went to the tree and dug up
the bottle into which, as agreed upon, Mr. Browne had put a letter;
informing me that he had been most reluctantly obliged to retreat;
the water at the Depot having turned putrid, and seriously
disagreed with the men; he said that he should fall back on the old
Depot along the same line on which we had advanced, and expressed
his fears that the water in Strzelecki's Creek would have dried, on
the permanence of which he knew our safety depended. Under present
circumstances the fate of poor Bawley, if not of more of our
horses, was sealed. Mr. Stuart and I sat down by the stockade, and
as night closed in lit a fire to guide Morgan and Mack on their
approach to the plain. They came up about 2 p.m. having left Bawley
on a little stony plain, and the Colt on the sand ridges nearer to
us, and in the confusion and darkness had left all the provisions
behind; it therefore became necessary to send for some, as we had
not had anything for many hours. The horses Morgan and Mack had
ridden were too knocked up for further work, but I sent the latter
on my own horse with a leather bottle that had been left behind by
the party, full of water for poor Bawley, if he should still find
him alive. Mack returned late in the afternoon, having passed the
Colt on his way to the Depot, towards which he dragged himself with
difficulty, but Bawley was beyond recovery; he gave the poor animal
the water, however, for he was a humane man, and then left him to
die.</p>

<p>We had remained during the day under a scorching heat, but could
hardly venture to drink the water of the creek without first
purifying it by boiling, and as we had no vessel until Mack should
come up we had to wait patiently for his arrival at 7 p.m. About 9
we had a damper baked, and broke our fast for the first time for
more than two days.</p>

<p>While sitting under a tree in the forenoon Mr. Stuart had
observed a crow pitch in the little garden we had made, but which
never benefited us, since the sun burnt up every plant the moment
it appeared above the ground. This bird scratched for a short time
in one of the soft beds, and then flew away with something in his
bill. On going to the spot Mr. Stuart scraped up a piece of bacon
and some suet, which the dogs of course had buried. These choice
morsels were washed and cooked, and Mr. Stuart brought me a small
piece of bacon, certainly not larger than a dollar, which he
assured me had been cut out of the centre and was perfectly clean.
I had not tasted the bacon since February, nor did I now feel any
desire to do so, but I ate it because I thought I really wanted it
in the weak state in which I was.</p>

<p>Perhaps a physician would laugh at me for ascribing the pains I
felt the next morning to so trifling a cause, but I was attacked
with pains at the bottom of my heels and in my back. Although lying
down I felt as if I was standing balanced on stones; these pains
increased during the day, insomuch that I anticipated some more
violent attack, and determined on getting to the old Depot as soon
as possible; but as the horses had not had sufficient rest, I put
off my journey to 5 p.m. on the following day, when I left Fort
Grey with Mr. Stuart, directing Mack and Morgan to follow at the
same hour on the following day, and promising that I would send a
dray with water to meet them. I rode all that night until 3 p.m. of
the 17th, when we reached the tents, which Mr. Browne had pitched
about two miles below the spot we had formerly occupied. If I
except two or three occasions on which I was obliged to dismount to
rest my back for a few minutes we rode without stopping, and might
truly be said to have been twenty hours on horseback.</p>

<p>Sincere I believe was the joy of Mr. Browne, and indeed of all
hands, at seeing us return, for they had taken it for granted that
our retreat would have been cut off. I too was gratified to find
that Mr. Brown was better, and to learn that everything had gone on
well. Davenport had recently been taken ill, but the other men had
recovered on their removal from the cause of their malady.</p>

<p>When I dismounted I had nearly fallen forward. Thinking that one
of the kangaroo dogs in his greeting had pushed me between the
legs, I turned round to give him a slap, but no dog was there, and
I soon found out that what I had felt was nothing more than strong
muscular action brought on by hard riding.</p>

<p>Mr. Browne informed me that the natives had frequently visited
the camp during my absence. He had given them to understand that we
were going over the hills again, on which they told him that if he
did not make haste all the water would be gone. It now behoved us
therefore to effect our retreat upon the Darling with all
expedition. Our situation was very critical, for the effects of the
drought were more visible now than before the July rain,&mdash;no
more indeed had since fallen, and the water in the Depot creek was
so much reduced that we had good reason to fear that none remained
anywhere else. On the 18th I sent Flood to a small creek, between
us and the Pine forest, but he returned on the following day with
information that it had long been dry. Thus then were my fears
verified, and our retreat to the Darling apparently cut off. About
this time too the very elements, against which we had so long been
contending, seemed to unite their energies to render our stay in
that dreadful region still more intolerable. The heat was greater
than that of the previous summer; the thermometer ranging between
110 degrees and 123 degrees every day; the wind blowing heavily
from N.E. to E.S.E. filled the air with impalpable red dust, giving
the sun the most foreboding and lurid appearance as we looked upon
him. The ground was so heated that our matches falling on it,
ignited; and, having occasion to make a night signal, I found the
whole of our rockets had been rendered useless, as on being lit
they exploded at once without rising from the ground.</p>

<b>EDWARD JOHN EYRE</b>
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>XV. EYRE'S JOURNEY FROM FOWLER'S
BAY TO ALBANY IN 1841</h3>

<blockquote>[THE purpose of the expeditions commanded by Edward
John Eyre was to explore the territory north and west of Adelaide
in the hope of discovering good grazing grounds and stock routes.
He made two journeys with this object in view in 1839. In 1840 he
set out from Adelaide to explore the Lake Torrens country. Coming
to the conclusion that it was useless to attempt to proceed beyond
Mount Hopeless, he sent to Adelaide for a fresh supply of
provisions, and moved his party down to Fowler's Bay. The following
narrative relates his adventures after he sent back the main body
of his expedition*, and determined to take pack-horses and try to
reach Albany (King George's Sound) by a direct route round the
shores of the Great Australian Bight.]<br></blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>[* An account of this expedition, written by
Eyre, is available in full on the Project Gutenberg Australia
website at <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#eyre">Eyre's
listing</a>.</b><br>
</p>

<p>Upon maturely considering our circumstances and position, I
decided to attempt to force a passage round the Great Bight, with
pack-horses only, sending, upon the return of the cutter, all our
heavy stores and drays in her to Cape Arid, if I found, upon her
arrival, the instructions I might receive, would justify me in
taking her so far beyond the boundaries of South Australia. This
was the only plan that appeared to me at all feasible, and I
determined to adopt it as soon as our horses were sufficiently
recruited to commence their labours again. . . .</p>

<p>The native boys I intended to accompany me in my journey, as
they would be better able to put up with the fatigues and
privations we should have to go through, than Europeans; whilst
their quickness of sight, habit of observation, and skill in
tracking, might occasionally be of essential service to me. The
native who had lately joined me from Adelaide, and whose country
was around King George's Sound, would, I hoped, be able to
interpret to any tribes we might meet with, as it appeared to me
that some of the words we had heard in use among the natives of
this part of the coast were very similar to some I had heard among
the natives of King George's Sound. Three natives, however, were
more than I required, and I would gladly have sent the youngest of
them back to Adelaide, but he had been with me several years, and I
did not like to send him away whilst he was willing to remain;
besides, he was so young and so light in weight, that if we were
able to get on at all, his presence could cause but little extra
difficulty. I therefore decided upon taking him also.</p>

<p>There remained now only the overseer; a man who had been in my
service for many years, and whose energy, activity, and many useful
qualities, had made him an invaluable servant to me at all times;
whilst his courage, prudence, good conduct, and fidelity, made me
very desirous to have him with me in this last effort to cross to
the westward. Having sent for him, I explained to him most fully
the circumstances in which I was placed, the utter impossibility of
taking on the whole party through so inhospitable a region as that
before us, my own firm determination never to return unsuccessful,
but either to accomplish the object I had in view, or perish in the
attempt. I pointed out to him that there were still eight hundred
and fifty miles of an unknown country yet to be traversed and
explored; that, in all probability, this would consist principally,
if not wholly, of an all but impracticable desert. I reminded him
of the fatigues, difficulties, and losses we had already
experienced in attempting to reconnoitre the country only as far as
the head of the Great Bight; and stated to him my own conviction,
that from the knowledge and experience we had already acquired of
the nature of the country; the journey before us must of necessity
be a long and harassing one&mdash;one of unceasing toil, privation,
and anxiety, whilst, from the smallness of our party, the probable
want of water, and other causes, it would be one, also, of more
than ordinary risk and danger. I then left him to determine whether
he would return to Adelaide, in the cutter, or remain and accompany
me. His reply was, that although he had become tired of remaining
so long away in the wilds, and should be glad when the expedition
had terminated, yet he would willingly remain with me to the last;
and would accompany me to the westward at every hazard. . . .</p>

<p><i>February 24.</i>&mdash;This being the day I had appointed to
enter upon the arduous task before me, I had the party up at a very
early hour. Our loads were all arranged for each of the horses; our
blankets and coats were all packed up, and we were in the act of
burying in a hole under ground the few stores we could not take
with us, when to our surprise a shot was heard in the direction of
Fowler's Bay, and shortly after a second; we then observed two
people in the distance following up the dray tracks leading to the
depot. Imagining that some whaler had anchored in the bay, and
being anxious to prevent our underground store from being noticed,
we hastily spread the tarpaulins over the hole, so that what we
were about could not be observed, and then fired shots in reply. .
. .</p>

<p><i>February 25.</i>&mdash;Having finished my letters, and buried
all the spare stores, I sent the native boys away early with the
sheep, that they might travel more slowly than we should do with
the horses. About two we loaded the pack animals, and wishing Mr.
Scott a final adieu, set off upon our route. The party consisted of
myself, the overseer, three native boys, nine horses, one Timor
pony, one foal, born at Streaky Bay, and six sheep; our flour which
was buried at the sand-hills to the north-west, was calculated for
nine weeks, at an allowance of six pounds of flour each weekly,
with a proportionate quantity of tea and sugar. The long rest our
horses had enjoyed, and the large supply of oats and bran we had
received for them, had brought them round wonderfully, they were
now in good condition, and strong, and could not have commenced the
journey under more favourable circumstances, had it been the winter
instead of the summer season.</p>

<p>Two of the native boys having gone on early in the morning with
the sheep, there remained only myself, the overseer, and one
native, to manage ten horses, and we were consequently obliged to
drive some of the pack-horses loose; at first they went well and
quietly, but something having unluckily startled one of them, he
frightened the others, and four out of the number set off at full
gallop, and never stopped for five miles, by which time they had
got rid of all their loads except the saddles. Sending the black
boy back to the depot with the four horses that had not got away, I
and the overseer went on horseback after the others, picking up the
baggage they had been carrying, scattered about in every direction;
luckily no great damage was done, and at sunset we were all
assembled again at the depot, and the animals reloaded. Leaving a
short note for Mr. Scott, who had gone on board the cutter, we
again recommenced our journey, and, travelling for five miles,
halted at the well in the plains. I intended to have made a long
stage, but the night set in so dark that I did not like to venture
amongst the scrub with the pack-horses now they were so fresh, and
where, if they did get frightened and gallop off, they would cause
us much greater trouble and delay than they had done in the
daytime.</p>

<p><i>February 26.</i>&mdash;Moving on very early, we arrived at
the grassy plain under the sand-hills, a little after three in the
afternoon, just in time to save the gun and clothes of the black
boys, which they had imprudently left there whilst they took the
sheep to water, a mile and a half away. At the very instant of our
arrival, a native was prowling about the camp, and would,
doubtless, soon have carried off every thing. Upon examining the
place at which we had buried our flour on the 31st December, and
upon which we were now dependent for our supply, I found that we
had only just arrived in time to save it from the depredations of
the natives; it seems, that having found where the cask containing
it was buried, and being unable, from its weight, to get it out of
the ground, they had broken a square hole in one of the staves (by
what means I could not discover), and though, as yet, every thing
was safe and uninjured inside, I have no doubt, that, had we been
one day later in coming, they would have enlarged the opening in
the cask, and scattered or destroyed the contents, and we should
have then had the unpleasant and laborious task of returning to
that we had buried at Fowler's Bay for a fresh supply. A bucket,
which we had also left buried, was broken to pieces, a two gallon
keg carried off, and a twenty-five gallon cask full of water had
been dug up, and the water drank or emptied, so that we were very
fortunate in arriving when we did to prevent further loss.</p>

<p>The black boys, who had gone a-head with the sheep, returned
soon after our arrival, tired and hungry, having only had one meal
since they left us on the 25th. They had been over the sandhills to
fetch water, and were now coming to try and find the flour which
they knew we had left buried at these plains. After dark,
accompanied by the overseer, I took the horses down to the water,
but the sand had slipped in, and we could not get them watered
to-night.</p>

<p><i>February 27.</i>&mdash;Sending the overseer and two boys down
with the horses to the well this morning, I and the other boy set
to work, and dug out the cask with the flour, which we then weighed
out, and subdivided into packages of fifty pounds each, for the
convenience of carrying. The native I had seen about the camp, on
our approach, yesterday, had returned, and slept near us at night;
but upon inquiring from him this morning, where our two-gallon keg
was, he took the very earliest opportunity of decamping, being
probably afraid that we should charge him with the robbery, or
punish him for it. The natives, generally, are a strange and
singular race of people, and their customs and habits are often
quite inexplicable to us. Sometimes, in barely passing through a
country, we have them gathering from all quarters, and surrounding
us, anxious and curious to observe our persons, or actions; at
other times, we may remain in camp for weeks together without
seeing a single native, though many may be in the neighbourhood;
when they do come, too, they usually depart as suddenly as their
visit had been unexpected. Among all who had come under my
observation, hitherto, along this coast, I found that every male
had undergone the singular ceremony I have described as prevailing
in the Port Lincoln peninsula; each, too, had the cartilage of the
nose perforated, but none had lost the front teeth, nor did I see
any (with one exception) having scars raised on the back, breast,
or arms, as is frequently the case with many tribes in
Australia.</p>

<p><i>February 28.</i>&mdash;As we had a long distance to travel to
the next water, and the sheep could not keep pace with the horses,
I left the overseer and two natives to bring the latter after us,
whilst I and the younger boy set off with the sheep. At fifteen
miles, we passed the place where the nine-gallon keg of water had
been buried on the 5th January. Upon digging it up, and taking out
the bung, the water appeared discoloured and offensive in smell. It
was still clear, however, and the sheep drank hastily of it, and we
did the same ourselves, but the horses would not touch it. Leaving
the cask out in the air with the bung out that it might sweeten a
little against the overseer came up, we went on with the sheep to
the undulating plains, arriving there between ten and eleven at
night. After hobbling the horses, and making a brush-yard for the
sheep, we laid down, tired with the labours of the day.</p>

<p><i>March 2.</i>&mdash;A hot day, with the wind north-east.
Between eleven and twelve we arrived at the first water, at the
head of the Bight, and had a long and arduous task to get the sheep
and horses watered, no natives being here to help us now, and the
sand rushing in as fast as we could throw it out. By great exertion
we effected our object, and then getting some tea, and leaving a
note to tell the overseer not to halt at this difficult
watering-place, if he could possibly avoid it, we pushed on again,
and took up our position at Yeerkumban kauwe, in time to dig holes,
and water the sheep, before dark.</p>

<p><i>March 3.</i>&mdash;Having got up and watered the horses and
sheep, I sent the boy out to tend them at grass, whilst I commenced
digging two large holes to water the pack-horses, that there might
be no delay when the overseer came up with them. I had nothing but
a shell to dig with, and, as a very large excavation was required
to enable a bucket to be dipped, my occupation was neither a light
nor a short one. Having completed my work, I killed a sheep, well
knowing the party would be fatigued and hungry, when they came up.
About three they made their appearance, and thus, upon the whole,
we had very successfully got over this our first push, and were
soon very comfortably established at "Yeerkumban kauwe". The holes
I had dug enabled us easily and speedily to water the horses, and
the sheep I had killed afforded a refreshing meal to the overseer
and boys, after their harassing journey. In the afternoon the sand
blew about in a most annoying manner, covering us from head to
foot, and filling everything we put down, if but for an instant.
This sand had been our constant torment for many weeks past;
condemned to live among the sand-hills for the sake of procuring
water, we were never free from irritation and inconvenience. It
floated on the surface of the water, penetrated into our clothes,
hair, eyes, and ears, our provisions were covered over with it, and
our blankets half buried when we lay down at nights,&mdash;it was a
perpetual and never-ceasing torment, and as if to increase our
miseries we were again afflicted with swarms of large horse-flies,
which bit us dreadfully. On the 4th, we remained in camp to rest
the horses, and I walked round to reconnoitre. Upon the beach I
found the fragments of a wreck, consisting of part of a mast, a
tiller wheel, and some copper sheathings, the last sad records of
the fate of some unfortunate vessel on this wild and breaker-beaten
shore. There was nothing to indicate its size, or name, or the
period when the wreck occurred.</p>

<p>Knowing from the accounts of the natives that upon leaving
Yeerkumban kauwe, I should have a task before me of no ordinary
difficulty to get either the sheep or the horses to the next water,
I determined to proceed myself in advance, with the sheep, that by
travelling slowly, at the same time that we kept steadily
advancing, every chance might be given to them of accomplishing the
journey in safety. I was anxious too to precede my party, in order
that by finding out where the water was, I might be on the look out
for them, to guide them to it, and that thus when in their greatest
difficulty, no time should be lost in searching for water. Having
given the overseer orders to keep the tracks of my horses, when he
had travelled about seventy miles along the coast, I set off on the
7th March, with the youngest of the natives to assist me in driving
the sheep, leaving the two elder ones with the overseer, to aid in
managing the pack-horses. As before we took two horses with us, one
to carry our provisions and water, and the other to ride upon in
turn, the boy however, being young, and incapable of much fatigue,
the greater portion of the walking naturally fell to my share. The
day was cool and favourable, and we accomplished a stage of
twenty-four miles; the afternoon became dark and lowering, and I
fully expected rain, but towards sunset two or three drops fell,
and the clouds cleared away. Our horses fed tolerably upon the
little withered grass that we found, but the sheep were too tired
to eat, and lay down; we put them therefore into a yard we had made
for them for the night.</p>

<p><i>March 8.</i>&mdash;Having turned the sheep out of the yard
three hours before daylight, I was in hopes they would have fed a
little before we moved on, but they would not touch such food as we
had for them, and at six I was obliged to proceed onwards; the
morning was dark and looked like rain, but as was the case
yesterday, a drop or two only fell. We made a stage to-day of
twenty-six miles, through a level country, generally open, but near
the sea covered with a very low dwarf tea-tree, small prickly
bushes, and salsolae, and having the surface almost every where
sprinkled over with fresh-water shells; further from the coast the
plains extending to the north were very extensive, level, and
divided by belts of scrub or shrubs. There was no perceptible
inclination of the country in any direction, the level land ran to
the very borders of the sea, where it abruptly terminated, forming
the steep and precipitous cliffs, observed by Captain Flinders, and
which it was quite impossible to descend anywhere. The general
elevation of this table land, was from three to four hundred
feet.</p>

<p>The day turned out fine and clear, and the effect produced by
refraction in these vast plains was singular and deceptive: more
than once we turned considerably out of our way to examine some
large timber, as we thought it to be, to the north of us, but
which, upon our approach, proved to be low scrubby bushes. At
another time we imagined we saw two natives in the distance, and
went towards them as carefully and cautiously as we could; instead,
however, of our having seen the heads of natives, as we supposed,
above the bushes, it turned out to be only crows. Yet the native
boy, whose quickness and accuracy of vision had often before
surprised me, was equally deceived with myself. Upon halting in the
evening our sheep again were very tired, and refused to eat. The
horses too were now beginning to feel the want of water, and fed
but little. I therefore sat up and watched them until half past
eight, after which I tied them up to some bushes. At one o'clock I
again got up and let them loose, hoping they might feed a little
better in the cool of the night. The scud was rapidly passing the
moon, and I watched for hours the clouds gathering to the south and
passing to the north, but no rain fell.</p>

<p><i>March 9.</i>&mdash;The day was cloudy and gathering for rain,
but none fell. After travelling twenty-five miles we halted for an
hour or two to rest the sheep and horses, feeding was out of the
question, for they were too much in want of water to attempt to cat
the dry and withered grass around us. We now lay down to rest
ourselves, and the boy soon fell asleep; I was however feverish and
restless, and could not close my eyes. In an hour and a half I
arose, got up the horses and saddled them, and then, awaking my
companion, we again pushed on by moonlight. At ten miles we crossed
a well beaten native pathway, plainly discernible even then, and
this we followed down towards the cliffs, fully hoping it would
lead to water. Our hopes however had been excited but to render our
disappointment the greater, for upon tracing it onwards we found it
terminate abruptly at a large circular hole of limestone rock,
which would retain a considerable quantity of water after rains,
but was now without a single drop. Gloomily turning away we again
pushed on for eight miles further, and at three in the morning of
the 10th were compelled to halt from downright exhaustion and
fatigue. The horses and sheep were knocked up. The poor boy was so
tired and sleepy that he could scarcely sit upon his horse, and I
found myself actually dosing as I walked: mechanically my legs kept
moving forwards, but my eyes were every now and then closed in
forgetfulness of all around me, until I was suddenly thrown down by
getting entangled amongst the scrub, or aroused by a severe blow
across the face from the recoil of a bough after the passage of the
boy's horse. I now judged we had come about ninety-three miles from
Yeerkumban-kauwe, and hoped that we could not be very far from
water. Having tied up the horses for an hour or two, and without
making a fire, or even unrolling our cloaks to cover us, we
stretched ourselves on the ground, and were in a few moments fast
asleep.</p>

<p><i>March 10.</i>&mdash;At five we were again on our route, every
moment expecting to see a break in the line of cliffs along which
we had now travelled so far. Alas! they still continued stretching
as far as the eye could see to the westward, and as fast as we
arrived at one point which had bounded our vision (and beyond which
we hoped a change might occur), it was but to be met with the view
of another beyond. Distressing and fatal as the continuance of
these cliffs might prove to us, there was a grandeur and sublimity
in their appearance that was most imposing, and which struck me
with admiration. Stretching out before us in lofty unbroken
outline, they presented the singular and romantic appearance of
massy battlements of masonry, supported by huge buttresses, and
glittering in the morning sun which had now risen upon them, and
made the scene beautiful even amidst the dangers and anxieties of
our situation. It was indeed a rich and gorgeous view for a
painter, and I never felt so much regret at my inability to sketch
as I did at this moment. Our sheep still travelled, but they were
getting so tired, and their pace was so slow, that I thought it
would be better to leave them behind, and by moving more rapidly
with the horses endeavour at least to save their lives. Foreseeing
that such a contingency as this might occur, I had given the
overseer strict orders to keep the tracks of my horses, that if I
should be compelled to abandon the sheep he might find them and
bring them on with his party.</p>

<p>Having decided upon this plan we set to work and made a strong
high yard of such shrubs as we could find, and in this we shut up
the sheep. I then wrote a note for the overseer, directing him to
bury the loads of the horses, and hastening on with the animals
alone endeavour to save their lives. To attract attention I raised
a long stick above the sheep-yard, and tied to it a red
handkerchief, which could be seen a long way off. At one we again
proceeded, and were able to advance more rapidly than we could
whilst the sheep were with us. In a few miles we came to a
well-beaten native road, and again our hopes were raised of
speedily terminating the anxiety and suspense we were in. Following
the road for ten miles it conducted us to where the cliffs receded
a little from the sea, leaving a small barren valley between them
and the ocean, of low, sandy ground; the road ceased here at a deep
rocky gorge of the cliffs, where there was a breach leading down to
the valley. There were several deep holes among the rocks where
water would be procurable after rains, but they were now all dry.
The state of mind in which we passed on may be better imagined than
described. We had now been four days without a drop of water for
our horses, and we had no longer any for ourselves, whilst there
appeared as little probability of our shortly procuring it as there
had been two days ago. A break, it is true, had occurred in the
line of the cliffs, but this appeared of a very temporary
character, for we could see beyond them the valley again abutting
upon the ocean.</p>

<p>At dark we were fifteen miles from where we left the sheep, and
were again upon a native pathway, which we twice tried to follow
down the steep and rugged slopes of the table land into the valley
below. We were only, however, fagging our poor horses and
bewildering ourselves to no purpose, for we invariably lost all
track at the bottom, and I at last became convinced that it was
useless to try and trace the natives' roadway further, since it
always appeared to stop at rocky holes where there was no water
now. Keeping, therefore, the high ground, we travelled near the top
of the cliffs, bounding the sandy valley, but here again a new
obstacle impeded our progress. The country, which had heretofore
been tolerably open was now become very scrubby, and we found it
almost impossible either to keep a straight course, or to make any
progress through it in the dark. Still we kept perseveringly
onwards, leading our horses and forcing our way through in the best
way we could. It was, however, all in vain; we made so little
headway, and were so completely exhausting the little strength we
had left, that I felt compelled to desist. The poor boy was quite
worn out, and could scarcely move. I was myself but little better,
and we were both suffering from a parching thirst; under such
obstacles labour and perseverance were but thrown away, and I
determined to await the day-light. After tying up the horses the
boy lay down, and was soon asleep, happy in his ignorance of the
dangers which threatened him. I lay down, too, but not to sleep; my
own distresses were lost in the apprehensions which I entertained
for those who were behind. We were now about one hundred and
twenty-eight miles from the last water; we had been four whole days
and nights without a drop for our horses, and almost without food
also, (for parched as they were they could not feed upon the dry
and withered grass we found.) The state the poor animals were in
was truly pitiable, what then was likely to be the condition of
those that were coming after us, and carrying heavy packs. It was
questionable, even, if they would reach the distance we had already
attained in safety; and it was clear, that unless I discovered
water early in the morning, the whole of our horses must perish,
whilst it would be very doubtful if we could succeed even in saving
our own lives.</p>

<p><i>March 11.</i>&mdash;Early this morning we moved on, leading
slowly our jaded animals through the scrub. The night had been one
of painful suspense and gloomy forebodings; and the day set in dark
and cloudy, as if to tantalise us with the hope of rain which was
not destined to fall. In a few miles we reached the edge of the
cliffs, from which we had a good view of the sandy valley we had
been travelling round, but which the thick scrub had prevented our
scrutinising sooner.</p>

<p>For a few minutes I carefully scanned the line of coast before
me. In the distance beyond a projecting point of the cliffs, I
fancied I discerned a low sandy shore, and my mind was made up at
once, to advance in the line we were pursuing. After a little
while, we again came to a well beaten native pathway, and following
this along the summit of the cliffs, were brought by it, in seven
miles, to the point where they receded from the sea-shore; as they
inclined inland, leaving a low sandy country between them and some
high bare sand-hills near the sea. The road now led us down a very
rocky steep part of the cliffs, near the angle where they broke
away from the beach, but upon reaching the bottom we lost it
altogether on the sandy shore; following along by the water's edge,
we felt cooled and refreshed by the sea air, and in one mile and a
half from where we had descended the cliffs, we reached the white
sand-drifts. Upon turning into these to search for water, we were
fortunate enough to strike the very place where the natives had dug
little wells; and thus on the fifth day of our sufferings, we were
again blessed with abundance of water,&mdash;nor could I help
considering it as a special instance of the goodness of Providence,
that we had passed the sandy valley in the dark, and had thereby
been deterred from descending to examine the sand-hills it
contained; had we done so, the extra fatigue to our horses and the
great length of time it would have taken up, would probably have
prevented the horses from ever reaching the water we were now at.
It took us about two hours to water the animals, and get a little
tea for ourselves, after which the boy laid down to sleep, and I
walked round to search for grass. A little grew between the
sand-drifts and the cliffs, and though dry and withered, I was most
thankful to find it.</p>

<p><i>March 12.</i>&mdash;The first streak of daylight found us on
our way to meet the party, carrying with us three gallons of water
upon one of the horses, the other was ridden by the boy.</p>

<p>At night, the whole party were, by God's blessing, once more
together, and in safety, after having passed over one hundred and
thirty-five miles of desert country, without a drop of water in its
whole extent, and at a season of the year the most unfavourable for
such an undertaking. In accomplishing this distance, the sheep had
been six and the horses five days without water, and both had been
almost wholly without food for the greater part of the time. The
little grass we found was so dry and withered, that the parched and
thirsty animals could not eat it after the second day. The day
following our arrival at the water was one of intense heat, and had
we experienced such on our journey, neither men nor horses could
ever have accomplished it; most grateful did we feel, therefore, to
that merciful Being who had shrouded us from a semi-tropical sun,
at a time when our exposure to it would have ensured our
destruction.</p>

<p>From the 12th to the 18th we remained at the sand-drifts, during
which time we were engaged in attending to the horses, in sending
back to recover the stores that had been left by the overseer, and
in examining the country around.</p>

<p>Being now at a part of the cliffs where they receded from the
sea, and where they had a last become accessible, I devoted some
time to an examination of their geological character. The part that
I selected was high, steep, and bluff towards the sea, which washed
its base; presenting the appearance described by Captain Flinders,
as noted before. By crawling and scrambling among the crags, I
managed, at some risk, to get at these singular cliffs. The brown
or upper portion consisted of an exceedingly hard, coarse grey
limestone, among which some few shells were embedded, but which,
from the hard nature of the rock, I could not break out; the lower
or white part consisted of a gritty chalk, full of broken shells
and marine productions, and having a somewhat saline taste: parts
of it exactly resembled the formation that I had found up to the
north, among the fragments of table-land; the chalk was soft and
friable at the surface, and easily cut out with a tomahawk, it was
traversed horizontally by strata of flint, ranging in depth from
six to eighteen inches, and having varying thicknesses of chalk
between the several strata. The chalk had worn away from beneath
the harder rock above, leaving the latter most frightfully
overhanging and threatening instant annihilation to the intruder.
Huge mis-shapen masses were lying with their rugged pinnacles above
the water, in every direction at the foot of the cliffs, plainly
indicated the frequency of a falling crag, and I felt quite a
relief when my examination was completed, and I got away from so
dangerous a post.</p>

<p>On the 18th we moved on, making a short stage of fourteen miles,
through a heavy, sandy, and scrubby country. At first I tried the
beach, but finding the sand very loose and unsuitable for
travelling, I was again compelled to enter the scrub behind the
sea-shore ridge, travelling through a succession of low scrubby
undulations, with here and there the beds of dried up lakes The
traces of natives were now more recent and numerous, but found
principally near the bushes bearing the red berries, and which grew
behind the front ridge of the coast in the greatest abundance. From
this circumstance, and from our having now travelled a considerable
distance beyond the first water, I began to fear that the second
which had been spoken of by the natives must, if it existed at all,
be behind us instead of in advance, and that in reality the fruit
we saw, and not water, was the object for which the natives, whose
tracks were around us, were travelling to the westward. The day was
cloudy, and likely for rain, but after a few drops had fallen, the
clouds passed away. In the afternoon the overseer dug behind the
sand-ridge, and at six feet came to water, but perfectly salt.</p>

<p><i>March 19.</i>&mdash;To-day we travelled onwards for
twenty-six miles, through a country exactly similar to that we had
passed through yesterday. At three in the afternoon we halted at an
opening when there was abundance of grass, though dry and withered.
The indications of natives having recently passed still continued,
and confirmed me in my impression, that they were on a journey to
the westward, and from one distant water to another, and
principally for the purpose of gathering the fruit. We were now
forty miles from the last water, and I became assured that we had
very far to go to the next; I had for some time given over any hope
of finding the second water spoken of by the natives at the head of
the Bight, and considered that we must have passed it if it
existed, long ago, perhaps even in that very valley, or among those
very sandhills where we had searched so unsuccessfully on the 12th.
There was now the prospect of a long journey before us without
water, as we had brought only a little with us for ourselves, and
which was nearly exhausted, whilst our horses had been quite
without, and were already suffering from thirst. Consulting with
the overseer, I resolved to leave our baggage where we were, whilst
the horses were sent back to the water (forty miles) to rest and
recruit for three or four days; by this means I expected they would
gather strength, and as they would have but little weight to carry
until they reached our present position, when they returned we
should be better able to force a passage through the waste before
us, at the same time that we should be able to procure a fresh and
larger stock of water for ourselves. At midnight I sent the whole
party back to the last water, but remained myself to take care of
the baggage and sheep. I retained an allowance of a pint of water
per day for six days, this being the contemplated period of the
overseer's absence. My situation was not at all enviable, but
circumstances rendered it unavoidable.</p>

<p>From the departure of my party, until their return, I spent a
miserable time, being unable to leave the camp at all. Shortly
after the party left, the sheep broke out of the yard, and missing
the horses with which they had been accustomed to travel and to
feed, set off as rapidly as they could after them; I succeeded in
getting them back, but they were exceedingly troublesome and
restless, attempting to start off, or to get down to the sea
whenever my eye was off them for an instant, and never feeding
quietly for ten minutes together; finding at last that they would
be quite unmanageable, I made a very strong and high yard, and
putting them in, kept them generally shut up, letting them out only
to feed for two or three hours at once. This gave me a little time
to examine my maps, and to reflect upon my position and prospects,
which involved the welfare of others, as well as my own. We had
still 600 miles of country to traverse, measured in straight lines
across the chart; but taking into account the inequalities of the
ground, and the circuit we were frequently obliged to make, we
could not hope to accomplish this in less than 800 miles of
distance. With every thing in our favour we could not expect to
accomplish this in less than eight weeks; but with all the
impediment and embarrassments we were likely to meet with, it would
probably take us twelve. Our sheep were reduced to three in number,
and our sole stock of flour now amounted to 142 pounds, to be
shared out amongst five persons, added to which the aspect of the
country before us was disheartening in the extreme; the places at
which there was any likelihood of finding water were probably few
and far apart, and the strength of our horses was already greatly
reduced by the hardships they had undergone. Ever since we had left
Fowler's Bay, the whole party, excepting the youngest boys, had
been obliged chiefly to walk, and yet every care and precaution we
could adopt were unable to counteract the evil effects of a barren
country, and an unfavourable season of the year. The task before us
was indeed a fearful one, but I firmly hoped by patience and
perseverance, safely and successfully to accomplish it at last.</p>

<p>During nearly the whole time that my party were away the weather
was cool and cloudy. Occasionally there was a great deal of thunder
and lightning, accompanied by a few drops of rain, but it always
cleared away without heavy showers. The storms came up from
seawards, and generally passed inland to the north-east; which
struck me as being somewhat singular, especially when taken in
conjunction with the fact that on one or two occasions, when the
wind was from the north-east, it was comparatively cool, and so
unlike any of those scorching blasts we had experienced from the
same quarter when on the western side of the Great Bight. There was
another thing connected with my present position which equally
surprised me, and was quite as inexplicable: whilst engaged one
morning rambling about the encampment as far as I could venture
away, I met with several flights of a very large description of
parrot, quite unknown to me, coming apparently from the north-east,
and settling among the shrubs and bushes around. They had evidently
come to eat the fruit growing behind the sand-hills, but being
scared by my following them about, to try and shoot one, they took
wing and went off again in the direction they had come from.</p>

<p><i>March 26.</i>&mdash;Upon moving on this morning we passed
through the same wretched kind of country for eighteen miles, to an
opening in the scrub where was a little grass, and at which we
halted to rest. There was so much scrub, and the sandy ridges were
so heavy and harassing to the horses, that I began to doubt almost
if we should get them along at all. We were now seventy-two miles
from the water, and had, in all probability, as much further to go
before we came to any more, and I saw that unless something was
done to lighten the loads of the pack-animals (trifling as were the
burdens they carried) we never could hope to get them on. Leaving
the natives to enjoy a sleep, the overseer and I opened and
re-sorted all our baggage, throwing away every thing that we could
at all dispense with; our great coats, jackets, and other articles
of dress were thrown away; a single spare shirt and pair of boots
and socks being all that were kept for each, besides our blankets
and the things we stood in, and which consisted only of trowsers,
shirt, and shoes. Most of our pack-saddles, all our horse-shoes,
most of our kegs for holding water, all our buckets but one, our
medicines, some of our fire-arms, a quantity of ammunition, and a
variety of other things, were here abandoned. Among the many things
that we were compelled to leave behind there was none that I
regretted parting with more than a copy of Captain Sturt's
Expeditions, which had been sent to me by the author to Fowler's
Bay to amuse and cheer me on the solitary task I had engaged in; it
was the last kind offering of friendship from a highly esteemed
friend, and nothing but necessity would have induced me to part
with it. Could the donor, however, have seen the miserable plight
we were reduced to, he would have pitied and forgiven an act that
circumstances alone compelled me to.</p>

<p>After all our arrangements were made, and every thing rejected
that we could do without, I found that the loads of the horses were
reduced in the aggregate about two hundred pounds; but this being
divided among ten, relieved each only a little. Myself, the
overseer, and the King George's Sound native invariably walked the
whole way, but the two younger natives were still permitted to ride
alternately upon one of the strongest horses. As our allowance of
flour was very small, and the fatigue and exertion we were all
obliged to undergo very great, I ordered a sheep to be killed
before we moved on again. We had been upon short allowance for some
time, and were getting weak and hardly able to go through the toils
that devolved upon us. Now, I knew that our safety depended upon
that of our horses, and that their lives again were contingent upon
the amount of fatigue we were ourselves able to endure, and the
degree of exertion we were capable of making to relieve them in
extremity. I did not therefore hesitate to make use of one of our
three remaining sheep to strengthen us for coming trials, instead
of retaining them until perhaps they might be of little use to us.
The whole party had a hearty meal, and then, watching the horses
until midnight, we moved on when the moon rose.</p>

<p><i>March 27.</i>&mdash;During the night we travelled slowly over
densely scrubby and sandy ridges, occasionally crossing large
sheets of oolitic limestone, in which were deep holes that would
most likely retain water after rains, but which were now quite dry.
As the daylight dawned the dreadful nature of the scrub drove us to
the sea beach; fortunately it was low water, and we obtained a firm
hard sand to travel over, though occasionally obstructed by
enormous masses of sea-weed, thrown into heaps of very many feet in
thickness and several hundreds of yards in length, looking exactly
like hay cut and pressed ready for packing.</p>

<p>To-day we overtook the natives, whose tracks we had seen so
frequently on our route. There was a large party of them, all
busily engaged in eating the red berries which grew behind the
coast ridge in such vast quantities; they did not appear so much
afraid of us as of our horses, at which they were dreadfully
alarmed, so that all our efforts to communicate with them were
fruitless; they would not come near us, nor would they give us the
opportunity of getting near them, but ran away whenever I advanced
towards them, though alone and unarmed.</p>

<p>Whilst in camp, during the heat of the day, the native boys
shewed me the way in which natives procure water for themselves,
when wandering among the scrubs, and by means of which they are
enabled to remain out almost any length of time, in a country quite
destitute of surface water. I had often heard of the natives
procuring water from the roots of trees, and had frequently seen
indications of their having so obtained it, but I had never before
seen the process actually gone through. Selecting a large healthy
looking tree out of the gum-scrub, and growing in a hollow, or flat
between two ridges, the native digs round at a few feet from the
trunk, to find the lateral roots; to one unaccustomed to the work,
it is a difficult and laborious thing frequently to find these
roots, but to the practised eye of the native, some slight
inequality of the surface, or some other mark, points out to him
their exact position at once, and he rarely digs in the wrong
place. Upon breaking the end next to the tree, the root is lifted,
and run out for twenty or thirty feet; the bark is then peeled off,
and the root broken into pieces, six or eight inches long, and
these again, if thick, are split into thinner pieces; they are then
sucked, or shaken over a piece of bark, or stuck up together in the
bark upon their ends, and water is slowly discharged from them; if
shaken, it comes out like a shower of very fine rain. The roots
vary in diameter from one inch to three; the best are those from
one to two and a half inches, and of great length. The quantity of
water contained in a good root, would probably fill two-thirds of a
pint. I saw my own boys get one-third of a pint out in this way in
about a quarter of an hour, and they were by no means adepts at the
practice, having never been compelled to resort to it from
necessity.</p>

<p><i>March 28.</i>&mdash;AT daylight we moved on, every one
walking, even the youngest boy could not ride now, as the horses
were so weak and jaded. Soon after leaving the camp, one of them
laid down, although the weight upon his back was very light; we
were consequently obliged to distribute the few things he carried
among the others, and let him follow loose. We had scarcely
advanced six miles from our last night's camp when the little Timor
pony I had purchased at Port Lincoln broke down completely; for
some time it had been weak, and we were obliged to drive it loose,
but it was now unable to proceed further, and we were compelled to
abandon it to a miserable and certain death, that by pushing on, we
might use every exertion in our power to relieve the others, though
scarcely daring to hope that we could save even one of them. It
was, indeed, a fearful and heart-rending scene to behold the noble
animals which had served us so long and so faithfully, suffering
the extremity of thirst and hunger, without having it in our power
to relieve them.</p>

<p>The country we had already passed through, precluded all hope of
our recrossing it without the horses to carry water for us, and
without provisions to enable us to endure the dreadful fatigue of
forced marches, across the desert. The country before us was, it is
true, quite unknown, but it could hardly be worse than that we had
traversed, and the chance was that it might be better. We were now
pushing on for some sand-hills, marked down in Captain Flinders'
chart at about 126&frac12; degrees of east longitude; I did not expect to
procure water until we reached these, but I felt sure we should
obtain it on our arrival there. After this point was passed, there
appeared to be one more long push without any likelihood of
procuring water, as the cliffs again became the boundary of the
ocean; but beyond Cape Arid, the change in the character and
appearance of the country, as described by Flinders, indicated the
existence of a better and more practicable line of country than we
had yet fallen in with.</p>

<p>My overseer, however, was now unfortunately beginning to take up
an opposite opinion, and though he still went through the duty
devolving upon him with assiduity and cheerfulness, it was evident
that his mind was ill at ease, and that he had many gloomy
anticipations of the future. He fancied there were no sand-hills
ahead, that we should never reach any water in that direction, and
that there was little hope of saving any of the horses. In this
latter idea I rather encouraged him than otherwise, deeming it
advisable to contemplate the darker side of the picture, and by
accustoming ourselves to look forward to being left entirely
dependent upon our own strength and efforts, in some measure to
prepare ourselves for such an event, should it unfortunately befal
us.</p>

<p><i>March 29.</i>&mdash;After calling up the party, I ascended
the highest sand-hill near me, from which the prospect was
cheerless and gloomy, and the point and sandy cones we imagined we
had seen last night had vanished. Indeed, upon examining the chart,
and considering that as yet we had advanced only one hundred and
twenty-six miles from the last water, I felt convinced that we had
still very far to go before we could expect to reach the
sand-drifts. The supply of water we had brought for ourselves was
nearly exhausted, and we could afford none for breakfast to-day;
the night, however, had been cool, and we did not feel the want of
it so much. Upon moving, I sent one of the natives back to the
horse I had tied up, about four miles from our camp to try to bring
him on to where we should halt in the middle of the day.</p>

<p><i>March 30.</i>&mdash;Getting up as soon as the day dawned, I
found that some of the horses had crossed the sand ridge to the
beach, and rambled some distance backwards. I found, too, that in
the dark, we had missed a patch of tolerable grass among the scrub,
not far from our camp. I regretted this the more, as during the
night a very heavy dew had fallen, and the horses might perhaps
have fed a little.</p>

<p>Leaving the overseer to search for those that had strayed, I
took a sponge, and went to try to collect some of the dew which was
hanging in spangles upon the grass and shrubs; brushing these with
the sponge, I squeezed it, when saturated, into a quart pot, which,
in an hour's time, I filled with water. The native boys were
occupied in the same way; and by using a handful of fine grass,
instead of a sponge, they collected about a quart among them.
Having taken the water to the camp, and made it into tea, we
divided it amongst the party, and never was a meal more truly
relished, although we all ate the last morsel of bread we had with
us, and none knew when we might again enjoy either a drink of
water, or a mouthful of bread. We had now demonstrated the
practicability of collecting water from the dew. I had often heard
from the natives that they were in the habit of practising this
plan, but had never before actually witnessed its adoption. It was,
however, very cold work, and completely wet me through from head to
foot, a greater quantity of water by far having been shaken over
me, from the bushes, than I was able to collect with my sponge. The
natives make use of a large oblong vessel of bark, which they hold
under the branches, whilst they brush them with a little grass, as
I did with the sponge; the water thus falls into the trough held
for it, and which, in consequence of the surface being so much
larger than the orifice of a quart pot, is proportionably sooner
filled. After the sun once rises, the spangles fall from the
boughs, and no more water can be collected; it is therefore
necessary to be at work very early, if success is an object of
importance.</p>

<p>I took the overseer up one of the ridges to reconnoitre the
country for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was no place
near us where water might be procured by digging. After a careful
examination a hollow was selected between the two front ridges of
white sand, where the overseer thought it likely we might be
successful. The boys were called up to assist in digging, and the
work was anxiously commenced; our suspense increasing every moment
as the well was deepened. At about five feet the sand was observed
to be quite moist, and upon its being tasted was pronounced quite
free from any saline qualities. This was joyous news, but too good
to be implicitly believed, and though we all tasted it over and
over again, we could scarcely believe that such really was the
case. By sinking another foot the question was put beyond all
doubt, and to our great relief fresh water was obtained at a depth
of six feet from the surface, on the seventh day of our distress,
and after we had travelled one hundred and sixty miles since we had
left the last water. Words would be inadequate to express the joy
and thankfulness of my little party at once more finding ourselves
in safety, and with abundance of water near us. A few hours before
hope itself seemed almost extinguished, and those only who have
been subject to a similar extremity of distress can have any just
idea of the relief we experienced. The mind seemed to have been
weighed down by intense anxiety and over-wrought feelings. At first
the gloomy restlessness of disappointment or the feverish
impatience of hope had operated upon our minds alternately, but
these had long since given way to that calm settled determination
of purpose, and cool steady vigour of action which desperate
circumstances can alone inspire. Day by day our prospects of
success had gradually diminished; our horses had become reduced to
so dreadful a state that many had died, and all were likely to do
so soon; we ourselves were weak and exhausted by fatigue, and it
appeared impossible that either could have gone many miles further.
In this last extremity we had been relieved. That gracious God,
without whose assistance all hope of safety had been in vain, had
heard our earnest prayers for his aid, and I trust that in our
deliverance we recognized and acknowledged with sincerity and
thankfulness his guiding and protecting hand. It is in
circumstances only such as we had lately been placed in that the
utter hopelessness of all human efforts is truly felt, and it is
when relieved from such a situation that the hand of a directing
and beneficent Being appears most plainly discernible, fulfilling
those gracious promises which he has made, to hear them that call
upon him in the day of trouble.</p>

<p>As soon as each had satisfied his thirst the pots were filled
and boiled for tea, and some bread was baked, whilst the overseer
and natives were still increasing the size of the well to enable us
to water the horses. We then got a hasty meal that we might the
better go through the fatigue of attending to the suffering
animals. Our utmost caution now became necessary in their
management; they had been seven days without a drop of water, and
almost without food also, and had suffered so much that with
abundance of water near us, and whilst they were suffering agonies
from the want of it, we dared not give it to them freely. Having
tied them up to some low bushes, we gave each in turn about four
gallons, and then driving them away for half a mile to where there
was a little withered grass, we watched them until the evening, and
again gave each about four gallons more of water.</p>

<p><i>March 31.</i>&mdash;The morning broke wild and lowering, and
the sand blew fearfully about from the drifts among which the water
was. Our well had tumbled in during the night, and we had to
undergo considerable labour before we could water the horses. After
clearing it out, we gave each of them seven gallons, and again sent
them away to the grass, letting the native boys watch them during
the day, whilst we rested for a few hours, shifted our camp to a
more sheltered place, weighed out a week's allowance of flour at
half a pound each per day, and made sundry other necessary
arrangements.</p>

<p><i>April 1.</i>&mdash;The last night had been bitterly cold and
frosty, and as we were badly clad, and without the means of making
a large or permanent fire, we all felt acutely the severity of the
weather.</p>

<p><i>April 2.</i>&mdash;Another severe cold frosty night made us
fully sensible that the winter was rapidly closing in upon us,
notwithstanding the ill-provided and unprotected state we were in
to encounter its inclemencies. Our well had again tumbled in, and
gave us a good deal of trouble, besides, each successive clearing
out deepened it considerably, and this took us to a level where the
brackish water mixed with the fresh; from this cause the water was
now too brackish to be palatable, and we sunk another well apart
from that used for the horses, at which to procure any water we
required for our own use.</p>

<p>On the 3rd, I sent the overseer out in one direction and I went
myself out in another, to examine the country and try to procure
wallabies for food. We both returned late, greatly fatigued with
walking through dense scrubs and over steep heavy sand ridges, but
without having fired a shot.</p>

<p>Our mutton (excepting the last sheep) being all used on the 4th,
we were reduced to our daily allowance of half a pound of flour
each, without any meat.</p>

<p>On the 5th, the overseer and one of the native boys got ready to
go back for some of the stores and other things we had abandoned,
forty-seven miles away. As they were likely to have severe
exercise, and to be away for four days, I gave them five pounds
extra of flour above their daily allowance, together with the
wallabie which I had shot, and which had not yet been used; they
drove before them three horses to carry their supply of water, and
bring back the things sent for.</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, with the assistance of the two native
boys who were left, I removed the camp to the white sand-drifts,
five miles further west. Being anxious to keep as near to the grass
as I could, I commenced digging at some distance away from where
the natives procured their water, but at a place where there were a
great many rushes. After sinking to about seven feet, I found the
soil as dry as ever, and removing to the native wells, with some
little trouble opened a hole large enough to water all the horses.
The single sheep gave us a great deal of trouble and kept us
running about from one sand hill to another, until we were tired
out, before we could capture it; at last we succeeded, and I tied
him up for the night, resolved never to let him loose again.</p>

<p><i>April 6.</i>&mdash;The severe frost and intense cold of last
night entirely deprived me of sleep, and I was glad when the
daylight broke, though still weary and unrefreshed. After clearing
out the well, and watering the horses, I sent one of the boys out
to watch them, and gave the other the gun to try and shoot a
wallabie, but after expending the only two charges of slugs I had
left, he returned unsuccessful. At night we all made up our supper
with the bark of the young roots of the gum-scrub. It appears to be
extensively used for food by the natives in this district, judging
from the remnants left at their encamping places. The bark is
peeled off the young roots of the eucalyptus dumosa, put into hot
ashes until nearly crisp, and then the dust being shaken off, it is
pounded between two stones and ready for use. Upon being chewed, a
farinaceous powder is imbibed from between the fibres of the bark,
by no means unpleasant in flavour, but rather sweet, and resembling
the taste of malt; how far a person could live upon this diet
alone, I have no means of judging, but it certainly appeases the
appetite, and is, I should suppose, nutritious.</p>

<p><i>April 7.</i>&mdash;Another sleepless night from the intense
cold. Upon getting up I put a mark upon the beach to guide the
overseer to our camp on his return, then weighed out flour and
baked bread for the party, as I found it lasted much better when
used stale than fresh.</p>

<p>The weather on the 8th and 9th suddenly became mild and soft,
with the appearance of rain, but none fell. I was becoming anxious
about the return of my overseer and native boy, who had been absent
nine tides, when they ought to have returned in eight, and I could
not help fearing some mischance had befallen them, and frequently
went back wards and forwards to the beach, to look for them. The
tenth tide found me anxiously at my post on the look out, and after
watching for a long time I thought I discerned some dark objects in
the distance, slowly advancing; gradually I made out a single
horse, driven by two people, and at once descended to meet them.
Their dismal tale was soon told. After leaving us on the 5th, they
reached their destination on the 7th; but in returning one of the
horses became blind, and was too weak to advance further, when they
had barely advanced thirteen miles; they were consequently obliged
to abandon him, and leave behind the things he had been carrying.
With the other two horses they got to within five miles of the
place we first procured water at on the 30th March. Here a second
horse had become unable to proceed, and the things he had carried
were also obliged to be left behind. They then got both horses to
the first well at the sand-hills and watered them, and after
resting a couple of hours came on to join me. Short as this
distance was, the jaded horse could not travel it, and was left
behind a mile and a half back. Having shewn the overseer and boy
the camp, I sent the other two natives to fetch up the tired horse,
whilst I attended to the other, and put the solitary sheep in for
the night. By a little after dark all was arranged, and the horse
that had been left behind once more with the others.</p>

<p>From the overseer I learnt, that during the fifty miles he had
retraced our route to obtain the provisions we had left, he had
five times dug for water: four times he had found salt water, and
once he had been stopped by rock. The last effort of this kind he
had made not far from where we found water on the 30th of March,
and I could not but be struck with the singular and providential
circumstance of our first halting and attempting to dig for water
on that day in all our distress, at the very first place, and at
the only place, within the 160 miles we had traversed, where water
could have been procured. It will be remembered, that in our
advance, we had travelled a great part of the latter portion of
this distance by night, and that thus there was a probability of
our having passed unknowingly some place where water might have
been procured. The overseer had now travelled over the same ground
in daylight, with renovated strength, and in a condition
comparatively strong, and fresh for exertion. He had dug wherever
he thought there was a chance of procuring water, but without
success in any one single instance.</p>

<p>We were now about half way between Fowler's Bay and King
George's Sound, located among barren sand-drifts, and without a
drop of water beyond us on either side, within a less distance than
150 miles. Our provisions were rapidly decreasing, whilst we were
lying idle and inactive in camp; and yet it would be absolutely
necessary for us thus to remain for some time longer, or at once
abandon the horses, and endeavour to make our way without them. To
the latter, however, there were many objections, one of which was,
that I well knew from the experience we had already had, that if we
abandoned the horses, and had those fearful long distances to
travel without water, we never could accomplish them on foot, if
compelled at the same time to live upon a very low diet, to carry
our arms, ammunition, and provisions, and in addition to these, a
stock of water, sufficient to last six or seven days. The only
thing that had enabled us to get through so far on our journey in
safety, had been the having the horses with us, for though weak and
jaded, they had yet carried the few things, which were
indispensable to us, and which we never could have carried
ourselves under the circumstances.</p>

<p>There was another inducement to continue with the horses, which
had considerable weight with me, and however revolting the idea
might be at first, it was a resource which I foresaw the desperate
circumstances we were in must soon compel us to adopt. It was
certainly horrible to contemplate the destruction of the noble
animals that had accompanied us so far, but ere long I well knew
that such would be the only chance of saving our own lives, and I
hoped that by accustoming the mind to dwell upon the subject
beforehand, when the evil hour did arrive, the horror and disgust
would be in some degree lessened. Upon consulting the overseer, I
was glad to find that he agreed with me fully in the expediency of
not abandoning the horses until it became unavoidable, and that he
had himself already contemplated the probability of our being very
shortly reduced to the alternative of using them for food.</p>

<p><i>April 10.</i>&mdash;Four days' provisions having been given
to each of the party, I took the King George's Sound native with me
to retrace, on foot, our route to the eastward. For the first ten
miles I was accompanied by one of the other native boys, leading a
horse to carry a little water for us, and take back the stores the
overseer had buried at that point, when the second horse knocked up
with him on the morning of the 9th. Having found the things, and
put them on the horse, I sent the boy with them back to the camp,
together with a large sting-ray fish which he had speared in the
surf near the shore. It was a large, coarse, ugly-looking thing,
but as it seemed to be of the same family as the skate, I did not
imagine we should run any risk in eating it. In other respects,
circumstances had broken through many scruples and prejudices, and
we were by no means particular as to what the fish might be, if it
were eatable.</p>

<p><i>April 11.</i>&mdash;Moving away long before daylight, we
pushed steadily on, and about dusk arrived, after a stage of
twenty-three miles, at the place where our stores were.</p>

<p><i>April 12.</i>&mdash;To-day the weather was cloudy and sultry,
and we found it very oppressive carrying the weight we had with us,
especially as we had no water. By steady perseverance, we gained
the place where our little keg had been buried; and having
refreshed ourselves with a little tea, again pushed on for a few
miles to a place where I had appointed the overseer to send a
native to meet us with water. He was already there, and we all
encamped together for the night, soon forgetting, in refreshing
sleep, the fatigues and labours of the day.</p>

<p>The 13th was a dark cloudy day, with light rains in the morning.
About noon we arrived at the camp, after having walked seventy-six
miles in the last three days and a half, during great part of
which, we had carried heavy weights. We had, however, successfully
accomplished the object for which we had gone, and had now
anxieties only for our future progress, the provisions and other
stores being all safely recovered.</p>

<p><i>April 14.</i>&mdash;Early this morning I sent the overseer,
and one of the native boys, with three days' provision to the
commencement of the cliffs to the westward, visible from the
sand-hills near our camp, in order that they might ascertain the
exact distance they were from us, and whether any grass or water
could be procured nearer to their base than where we were. After
their departure, I attended to the horses, and then amused myself
preparing some fishing lines to set off the shore, with a large
stone as an anchor, and a small keg for a buoy. The day was,
however, wild and boisterous; and in my attempts to get through the
surf, to set the lines, I was thrown down, together with the large
stone I was carrying, and my leg severely cut and bruised. The
weather was extremely cold, too, and being without coat or jacket
of any kind, I suffered severely from it.</p>

<p>The 15th was another cold day, with the wind at south-west, and
we could neither set the lines, nor spear sting-ray, whilst the
supply we had before obtained was now nearly exhausted. One of the
horses was taken ill, and unable to rise, from the effects of the
cold; his limbs were cramped and stiff, and apparently unable to
sustain the weight of his body. After plucking dry grass, and
making a bed for him, placing a break-wind of boughs round, and
making a fire near him, we left him for the night.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, the overseer and boy returned from the
westward, and reported, that the cliffs were sixteen miles away;
that they had dug for water, but that none could be found, and that
there was hardly a blade of grass any where, whilst the whole
region around was becoming densely scrubby; through much of which
we should have to pass before we reached the cliffs. Altogether,
the overseer seemed quite discouraged by the appearance of the
country, and to dread the idea of moving on in that direction,
often saying, that he wished he was back, and that he thought he
could retrace his steps to Fowler's Bay, where a supply of
provisions had been buried. I was vexed at these remarks, because I
felt that I could not coincide in them, and because I knew that
when the moment for decision came, my past experience, and the
strong reasons which had produced in my own mind quite a different
conviction, would compel me to act in opposition to the wishes of
the only European with me, and he a person, too, whom I sincerely
respected for the fidelity and devotion with which he had followed
me through all my wanderings. I was afraid, too, that the native
boys, hearing his remarks, and perceiving that he had no confidence
in our future movements, would catch up the same idea, and that, in
addition to the other difficulties and anxieties I had to cope
with, would be the still more frightful one of disaffection and
discontent. Another subject of uneasiness arose from the nature of
our diet;&mdash;for some few days we had all been using a good deal
of the sting-ray fish, and though at first we had found it
palatable, either from confining ourselves too exclusively to it,
or from eating too much, it had latterly disagreed with us. The
overseer declared it made him ill and weak, and that he could do
nothing whilst living upon it. The boys said the same; and yet we
had nothing else to supply its place, and the small quantity of
flour left would not admit of our using more than was barely
necessary to sustain life. At this time we had hardly any fish
left, and the whole party were ravenously hungry. In this dilemma,
I determined to have the sick horse killed for food. It was
impossible he could ever recover, and by depriving him of life a
few hours sooner than the natural course of events would have done,
we should be enabled to get a supply of food to last us over a few
days more, by which time I hoped we might again be able to venture
on, and attempt another push to the westward.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 16th, I sent the overseer to kill
the unfortunate horse, which was still alive, but unable to rise
from the ground, having never moved from the place where he had
first been found lying yesterday morning. The miserable animal was
in the most wretched state possible, thin and emaciated by dreadful
and long continued sufferings, and labouring under some complaint,
that in a very few hours at the farthest, must have terminated its
life.</p>

<p>After a great portion of the meat had been cut off from the
carcase, in thin slices, they were dipped in salt water and hung up
upon strings to dry in the sun. I could not bring myself to eat any
to-day, so horrible and revolting did it appear to me, but the
overseer made a hearty dinner, and the native boys gorged
themselves to excess, remaining the whole afternoon by the carcase,
where they made a fire, cutting off and roasting such portions as
had been left. They looked like ravenous wolves about their prey,
and when they returned to the camp at night, they were loaded with
as much cooked meat as they could carry, and which they were
continually eating during the night; I made a meal upon some of the
sting-ray that was still left, but it made me dreadfully sick, and
I was obliged to lie down, seriously ill.</p>

<p><i>April 17.</i>&mdash;Being rather better to-day, I was obliged
to overcome my repugnance to the disagreeable food we were
compelled to resort to, and the ice once broken, I found that
although it was far from being palatable, I could gradually
reconcile myself to it. The boys after breakfast again went down to
the carcase, and spent the whole day roasting and eating, and at
night they again returned to the camp loaded. We turned all the
meat upon the strings and redipped it in sea water again to-day,
but the weather was unfavourable for drying it, being cold and
damp. Both yesterday and to-day light showers fell sufficient to
moisten the grass.</p>

<p><i>April 18.</i>&mdash;The day being much warmer, many large
flies were about, and I was obliged to have a fire kept constantly
around the meat, to keep them away by the smoke.</p>

<p><i>April 22.</i>&mdash;Upon weighing the meat this morning,
which as usual was left out upon the strings at night, I discovered
that four pounds had been stolen by some of the boys, whilst we
were sleeping. I had suspected that our stock was diminishing
rapidly for a day or two past, and had weighed it overnight that I
might ascertain this point, and if it were so, take some means to
prevent it for the future. With so little food to depend upon, and
where it was so completely in the power of any one of the party, to
gratify his own appetite at the expense of the others, during their
absence, or when they slept, it became highly necessary to enforce
strict honesty towards each other; I was much grieved to find that
the meat had been taken by the natives, more particularly as their
daily allowance had been so great. We had, moreover, only two days'
supply of the meat left for the party, and being about to commence
the long journey before us, it was important to economise our
provisions to support us under the fatigue and labours we should
then have to undergo.</p>

<p>Having deducted the four pounds stolen during the night, from
the daily rations of the three boys, I gave them the remainder,
(eight pounds) telling them the reason why their quantity was less
to-day than usual, and asking them to point out the thief, who
alone should be punished and the others would receive their usual
rations. The youngest of the three boys, and the King George's
Sound native, resolutely denied being concerned in the robbery; but
the other native doggedly refused to answer any questions about it,
only telling me that he and the native from King George's Sound
would leave me and make their way by themselves. I pointed out to
them the folly, in fact the impossibility almost, of their
succeeding in any attempt of the kind; advised them to remain
quietly where they were, and behave well for the future, but
concluded by telling them that if they were bent upon going they
might do so, as I would not attempt to stop them.</p>

<p>For some time past the two eldest of the boys, both of whom were
now nearly grown up to manhood, had been far from obedient in their
general conduct. Ever since we had been reduced to a low scale of
diet they had been sulky and discontented, never assisting in the
routine of the day, or doing what they were requested to do with
that cheerfulness and alacrity that they had previously exhibited.
Unaccustomed to impose the least restraint upon their appetites or
passions, they considered it a hardship to be obliged to walk as
long as any horses were left alive, though they saw those horses
falling behind and perishing from fatigue; they considered it a
hardship, too, to be curtailed in their allowance of food, as long
as a mouthful was left unconsumed; and in addition to this, they
had imbibed the overseer's idea that we never should succeed in our
attempt to get to the westward, and got daily more dissatisfied at
remaining idle in camp, whilst the horses were recruiting.</p>

<p>The excess of animal food they had had at their command for some
few days after the horse was killed, made them forget their former
scarcity, and in their folly they imagined that they could supply
their own wants, and get on better and more rapidly than we did,
and they determined to attempt it. Vexed as I had been at finding
out they had not scrupled to plunder the small stock of provisions
we had left, I was loth to let them leave me foolishly without
making an effort to prevent it. One of them had been with me a
great length of time, and the other I had brought from his country
and his friends, and to both I felt bound by ties of humanity to
prevent if possible their taking the rash step they meditated; my
remonstrances and expostulations were however in vain, and after
getting their breakfasts, they took up some spears they had been
carefully preparing for the last two days, and walked sulkily from
the camp in a westerly direction. The youngest boy had, it seemed,
also been enticed to join them, for he was getting up with the
intention of following, when I called him back and detained him in
the camp, as he was too young to know what he was doing, and had
only been led astray by the others. I had intended to have moved on
myself to-day, but the departure of the natives made me change my
intention, for I deemed it desirable that they should have at least
three or four days start of us. Finding that the single sheep we
had left would now be the cause of a good deal of trouble, I had it
killed this afternoon, that we might have the full advantage of it
whilst we had plenty of water, and might be enabled to hoard our
bread a little. We had still a little of the horse-flesh left, and
made a point of using it all up before the mutton was allowed to be
touched.</p>

<p>The morning of the 23rd broke cool and cloudy, with showers
gathering from seawards; the wind was south-west, and the sky wild
and lowering in that direction. During the forenoon light rain
fell, but scarcely more than sufficient to moisten the grass; it
would, however, probably afford our deserters a drink upon the
cliffs. Towards evening the sky cleared, and the weather became
frosty.</p>

<p><i>April 25.</i>&mdash;During the night dense clouds,
accompanied by gusts of wind and forked lightning, passed rapidly
to the south-west, and this morning the wind changed to that
quarter. Heavy storms gathered to seawards with much thunder and
lightning, but no rain fell near us; the sea appearing to attract
all the showers. The overseer shot a very large eagle to-day and
made a stew of it, which was excellent. I sent the boy out to try
and shoot a wallabie, but he returned without one.</p>

<p>In the evening, a little before dark, and just as we had
finished our tea, to my great astonishment our two runaway natives
made their appearance, the King George's Sound native being first.
He came frankly up, and said that they were both sorry for what
they had done, and were anxious to be received again, as they found
they could get nothing to eat for themselves. The other boy sat
silently and sullenly at the fire, apparently more chagrined at
being compelled by necessity to come back to us than sorry for
having gone away. Having given them a lecture, for they both now
admitted having stolen meat, not only on the night they were
detected but previously, I gave each some tea and some bread and
meat, and told them if they behaved well they would be treated in
every respect as before, and share with us our little stock of
provisions as long as it lasted.</p>

<p>I now learnt that they had fared in the bush but little better
than I should have done myself. They had been absent four days, and
had come home nearly starved.</p>

<p>Being determined to break up camp on the 27th, I sent the King
George's Sound native on a-head, as soon as he had breakfasted,
that, by preceding the party, he might have time to spear a
sting-ray against we overtook him. The day was dull, cloudy, and
warm, and still looking likely for rain, with the wind at
north-east. At eleven we were ready, and moved away from a place
where we had experienced so much relief in our extremity, and at
which our necessities had compelled us to remain so long. For
twenty-eight days we had been encamped at the sand-drifts, or at
the first water we had found, five miles from them. Daily, almost
hourly, had the sky threatened rain, and yet none fell. We had now
entered upon the last fearful push, which was to decide our fate.
This one stretch of bad country crossed, I felt a conviction we
should be safe. That we had at least 150 miles to go to the next
water I was fully assured of; I was equally satisfied that our
horses were by no means in a condition to encounter the hardships
and privations they must meet with in such a journey; for though
they had had a long rest, and in some degree recovered from their
former tired-out condition, they had not picked up in flesh or
regained their spirits; the sapless, withered state of the grass
and the severe cold of the nights had prevented them from deriving
the advantage that they ought to have done from so long a respite
from labour. Still I hoped we might be successful. We had lingered
day by day, until it would have been folly to have waited longer;
the rubicon was, however, now passed, and we had nothing to rely
upon but our own exertions and perseverance, humbly trusting that
the great and merciful God who had hitherto guarded and guided us
in safety would not desert us now.</p>

<p><i>April 28.</i>&mdash;After travelling along the beach for two
miles we ascended behind the cliffs, which now came in bluff to the
sea, and then keeping along their summits, nearly parallel with the
coast, and passing through much scrub, low brushwood, and dwarf
tea-tree growing upon the rocky surface, we made a stage of twenty
miles; both ourselves and the horses greatly tired with walking
through the matted scrub of tea-tree every where covering the
ground.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th we moved away very early, passing
over a rocky level country, covered with low brush, and very
fatiguing to both ourselves and our horses. The morning was gloomy
and close, and the day turned out intensely hot. After travelling
only fifteen miles we were compelled to halt until the greatest
heat was passed. Our stock of water and provisions only admitted of
our making two meals in the day, breakfast and supper; but as I
intended this evening to travel great part of the night, we each
made our meal now instead of later in the day, that we might not be
delayed when the cool of the evening set in. We had been travelling
along the summit of the cliffs parallel with the coast line, and
had found the country level and uniform in its character; the
cliffs still being from two to three hundred feet in elevation, and
of the same formation as I noticed before. There were patches of
grass scattered among the scrub at intervals, but all were old and
withered.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon we again proceeded on our journey, but
had not gone far before the sky unexpectedly became overcast with
clouds, and the whole heavens assumed a menacing and threatening
appearance. To the east and to the west, thunderclouds gathered
heavily around, every indication of sudden and violent rain was
present to cheer us as we advanced, and all were rejoicing in the
prospects of a speedy termination to our difficulties. The wind had
in the morning been north-east, gradually veering round to north
and north-west, at which point it was stationary when the clouds
began to gather. Towards sunset a heavy storm passed over our
heads, with the rapidity almost of lightning; the wind suddenly
shifted from north-west to south-west, blowing a perfect hurricane,
and rendering it almost impossible for us to advance against it. A
few moments before we had confidently expected a heavy fall of
rain; the dark and lowering sky had gradually gathered and
concentrated above and around us, until the very heavens seemed
over-weighted and ready every instant to burst. A briefer interval
of time, accompanied by the sudden and violent change of wind, had
dashed our hopes to the ground, and the prospect of rain was now
over, although a few heavy clouds still hung around us.</p>

<p>To-night the overseer asked me which of the watches I would
keep, and as I was not sleepy, though tired, I chose the first. At
a quarter before six, I went to take charge of the horses, having
previously seen the overseer and the natives lay down to sleep, at
their respective break-winds, ten or twelve yards apart from one
another. The arms and provisions, as was our custom, were piled up
under an oilskin, between my break-wind and that of the overseer,
with the exception of one gun, which I always kept at my own
sleeping place. I have been thus minute in detailing the position
and arrangement of our encampment this evening, because of the
fearful consequences that followed, and to shew the very slight
circumstances upon which the destinies of life sometimes hinge.
Trifling as the arrangement of the watches might seem, and
unimportant as I thought it at the time, whether I undertook the
first or the second, yet was my choice, in this respect, the means
under God's providence of my life being saved, and the cause of the
loss of that of my overseer.</p>

<p>The night was cold, and the wind blowing hard from the
south-west, whilst scud and nimbus were passing very rapidly by the
moon. The horses fed tolerably well, but rambled a good deal,
threading in and out among the many belts of scrub which
intersected the grassy openings, until at last I hardly knew
exactly where our camp was, the fires having apparently expired
some time ago. It was now half past ten, and I headed the horses
back, in the direction in which I thought the camp lay, that I
might be ready to call the overseer to relieve me at eleven. Whilst
thus engaged, and looking steadfastly around among the scrub, to
see if I could anywhere detect the embers of our fires, I was
startled by a sudden flash, followed by the report of a gun, not a
quarter of a mile away from me. Imagining that the overseer had
mistaken the hour of the night, and not being able to find me or
the horses, had taken that method to attract my attention, I
immediately called out, but as no answer was returned, I got
alarmed, and leaving the horses, hurried up towards the camp as
rapidly as I could. About a hundred yards from it, I met the King
George's Sound native (Wylie), running towards me, and in great
alarm, crying out, "Oh Massa, oh Massa, come here,"&mdash;but could
gain no information from him, as to what had occurred. Upon
reaching the encampment, which I did in about five minutes after
the shot was fired, I was horror-struck to find my poor overseer
lying on the ground, weltering in his blood, and in the last
agonies of death.</p>

<p>Glancing hastily around the camp I found it deserted by the two
younger native boys, whilst the scattered fragments of our baggage,
which I left carefully piled under the oilskin, lay thrown about in
wild disorder, and at once revealed the cause of the harrowing
scene before me.</p>

<p>Upon raising the body of my faithful, but ill-fated follower, I
found that he was beyond all human aid; he had been shot through
the left breast with a ball, the last convulsions of death were
upon him, and he expired almost immediately after our arrival. The
frightful, the appalling truth now burst upon me, that I was alone
in the desert. He who had faithfully served me for many years, who
had followed my fortunes in adversity and in prosperity, who had
accompanied me in all my wanderings, and whose attachment to me had
been his sole inducement to remain with me in this last, and to him
alas, fatal journey, was now no more. For an instant, I was almost
tempted to wish that it had been my own fate instead of his. The
horrors of my situation glared upon me in such startling reality,
as for an instant almost to paralyse the mind. At the dead hour of
night, in the wildest and most inhospitable wastes of Australia,
with the fierce wind raging in unison with the scene of violence
before me, I was left, with a single native, whose fidelity I could
not rely upon, and who for aught I knew might be in league with the
other two, who perhaps were even now, lurking about with the view
of taking away my life as they had done that of the overseer. Three
days had passed away since we left the last water, and it was very
doubtful when we might find any more. Six hundred miles of country
had to be traversed, before I could hope to obtain the slightest
aid or assistance of any kind, whilst I knew not that a single drop
of water or an ounce of flour had been left by these murderers,
from a stock that had previously been so small.</p>

<p>With such thoughts rapidly passing through my mind, I turned to
search for my double-barelled gun, which I had left covered with an
oilskin at the head of my own break wind. It was gone, as was also
the double-barelled gun that had belonged to the overseer. These
were the only weapons at the time that were in serviceable
condition, for though there were a brace of pistols they had been
packed away, as there were no cartridges for them, and my rifle was
useless, from having a ball sticking fast in the breech, and which
we had in vain endeavoured to extract. A few days' previous to our
leaving the last water, the overseer had attempted to wash out the
rifle not knowing it was loaded, and the consequence was, that the
powder became wetted and partly washed away, so that we could
neither fire it off, nor get out the ball; I was, therefore,
temporarily defenceless, and quite at the mercy of the natives, had
they at this time come upon me. Having hastily ripped open the bag
in which the pistols had been sewn up, I got them out, together
with my powder flask, and a bag containing a little shot and some
large balls. The rifle I found where it had been left, but the
ramrod had been taken out by the boys to load my double-barelled
gun with, its own ramrod being too short for that purpose; I found
it, however, together with several loose cartridges, lying about
near the place where the boys had slept, so that it was evident
they had deliberately loaded the fire-arms before they tried to
move away with the things they had stolen; one barrel only of my
gun had been previously loaded, and I believe neither barrels in
that of the overseer.</p>

<p>After obtaining possession of all the remaining arms, useless as
they were at the moment, with some ammunition, I made no further
examination then, but hurried away from the fearful scene,
accompanied by the King George's Sound native, to search for the
horses, knowing that if they got away now, no chance whatever would
remain of saving our lives. Already the wretched animals had
wandered to a considerable distance; and although the night was
moonlight, yet the belts of scrub, intersecting the plains, were so
numerous and dense, that for a long time we could not find them;
having succeeded in doing so at last, Wylie and I remained with
them, watching them during the remainder of the night; but they
were very restless, and gave us a great deal of trouble. With an
aching heart, and in most painful reflections, I passed this
dreadful night. Every moment appeared to be protracted to an hour,
and it seemed as if the daylight would never appear. About midnight
the wind ceased, and the weather became bitterly cold and frosty. I
had nothing on but a shirt and a pair of trowsers, and suffered
most acutely from the cold; to mental anguish was now added intense
bodily pain. Suffering and distress had well nigh overwhelmed me,
and life seemed hardly worth the effort necessary to prolong it.
Ages can never efface the horrors of this single night, nor would
the wealth of the world ever tempt me to go through similar ones
again.</p>

<p><i>April 30.</i>&mdash;At last, by God's blessing, daylight
dawned once more, but sad and heart-rending was the scene it
presented to my view, upon driving the horses to what had been our
last night's camp. The corpse of my poor companion lay extended on
the ground, with the eyes open, but cold and glazed in death. The
same stern resolution, and fearless open look, which had
characterized him when living, stamped the expression of his
countenance even now. He had fallen upon his breast four or five
yards from where he had been sleeping, and was dressed only in his
shirt. In all probability, the noise made by the natives, in
plundering the camp, had awoke him; and upon his jumping up, with a
view of stopping them, they had fired upon and killed him.</p>

<p>Around the camp lay scattered the harness of the horses, and the
remains of the stores that had been the temptation to this fatal
deed.</p>

<p>As soon as the horses were caught, and secured, I left Wylie to
make a fire, whilst I proceeded to examine into the state of our
baggage, that I might decide upon our future proceedings. Among the
principal things carried off by the natives, were, the whole of our
baked bread, amounting to twenty pounds weight, some mutton, tea
and sugar, the overseer's tobacco and pipes, a one gallon keg full
of water, some clothes, two double-barrelled guns, some ammunition,
and a few other small articles.</p>

<p>There were still left forty pounds of flour, a little tea and
sugar, and four gallons of water, besides the arms and ammunition I
had secured last night.</p>

<p>From the state of our horses, and the dreadful circumstances we
were placed in, I was now obliged to abandon every thing but the
bare necessaries of life. The few books and instruments I had still
left, with many of the specimens I had collected, a saddle, and
some other things, were thrown aside to lighten somewhat more the
trifling loads our animals had to carry. A little bread was then
baked, and I endeavoured once more to put the rifle in serviceable
condition, as it was the only weapon we should have to depend upon
in any dangers that might beset us. Unable in any way to take out
the breech, or to extract the ball, I determined to melt it out,
and for that purpose took the barrel off the stock, and put the
breech in the fire, holding the muzzle in my hand. Whilst thus
engaged, the rifle went off, the ball whizzing close past my head;
the fire, it seems, had dried the powder, which had been wetted,
not washed out; and when the barrel was sufficiently heated, the
piece had gone off, to the imminent danger of my life, from the
incautious way in which I held it. The gun, however, was again
serviceable; and after carefully loading it, I felt a degree of
confidence and security I had before been a stranger to.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock we were ready to proceed; there remained but to
perform the last sad offices of humanity towards him, whose career
had been cut short in so untimely a manner. This duty was rendered
even more than ordinarily painful, by the nature of the country,
where we happened to have been encamped. One vast unbroken surface
of sheet rock extended for miles in every direction, and rendered
it impossible to make a grave. We were some miles away from the
sea-shore, and even had we been nearer, could not have got down the
cliffs to bury the corpse in the sand. I could only, therefore,
wrap a blanket around the body of the overseer, and leaving it
enshrouded where he fell, escape from the melancholy scene,
accompanied by Wylie, under the influence of feelings which neither
time nor circumstances will ever obliterate. Though years have now
passed away since the enactment of this tragedy, the dreadful
horrors of that time and scene, are recalled before me with
frightful vividness, and make me shudder even now, when I think of
them. A life time was crowded into those few short hours, and death
alone may blot out the impressions they produced.</p>

<p>For some time we travelled slowly and silently onwards. Wylie
preceding, leading one of the horses, myself following behind and
driving the others after him, through a country consisting still of
the same alternations of scrub and open intervals as before. The
day became very warm, and at eleven, after travelling ten miles to
the west, I determined to halt until the cool of the evening. After
baking some bread and getting our dinners, I questioned Wylie as to
what he knew of the sad occurrence of yesterday. He positively
denied all knowledge of it&mdash;said he had been asleep, and was
awoke by the report of the gun, and that upon seeing the overseer
lying on the ground he ran off to meet me. He admitted, however,
that, after the unsuccessful attempt to leave us, and proceed alone
to King George's Sound, the elder of the other two natives had
proposed to him again to quit the party, and try to go back to
Fowler's Bay, to the provisions buried there. But he had heard or
knew nothing, he said, of either robbery or murder being first
contemplated.</p>

<p>My own impression was, that Wylie had agreed with the other two
to rob the camp and leave us;&mdash;that he had been cognisant of
all their proceedings and preparations, but that when, upon the eve
of their departure, the overseer had unexpectedly awoke and been
murdered, he was shocked and frightened at the deed, and instead of
accompanying them, had run down to meet me. My opinion upon this
point received additional confirmation from the subsequent events
of this day; but I never could get Wylie to admit even the
slightest knowledge of the fatal occurrence, or that he had even
intended to have united with them in plundering the camp and
deserting. He had now become truly alarmed; and independently of
the fear of the consequences which would attach to the crime,
should we ever reach a civilized community again, he had become
very apprehensive that the other natives, who belonged to quite a
different part of Australia to himself, and who spoke a totally
different language, would murder him as unhesitatingly as they had
done the white man.</p>

<p>We remained in camp until four o'clock, and were again preparing
to advance, when my attention was called by Wylie to two white
objects among the scrub, at no great distance from us, and I at
once recognized the native boys, covered with their blankets only,
and advancing towards us. From Wylie's account of their proposal to
go back towards Fowler's Bay, I fully hoped that they had taken
that direction, and left us to pursue our way to the Sound
unmolested. I was therefore surprised, and somewhat alarmed, at
finding them so near us. With my rifle and pistols I felt myself
sufficiently a match for them in an open country, or by daylight.
Yet I knew that as long as they followed like bloodhounds on our
tracks our lives would be in their power at any moment that they
chose to take them, whilst we were passing through a scrubby
country, or by night. Whatever their intention might be, I knew,
that if we travelled in the same direction with them, our lives
could only be safe by their destruction. Although they had taken
fully one-third of the whole stock of our provisions, their
appetites were so ravenous, and their habits so improvident, that
this would soon be consumed, and then they must either starve or
plunder us; for they had already tried to subsist themselves in the
bush, and had failed.</p>

<p>As these impressions rapidly passed through my mind, there
appeared to me but one resource left, to save my own life and that
of the native with me: that was, to shoot the elder of the two.
Painful as this would be, I saw no other alternative, if they still
persisted in following us. After packing up our few things, and
putting them upon the horses, I gave the bridles to Wylie to hold,
whilst I advanced alone with my rifle towards the two natives. They
were now tolerably near, each carrying a double-barrelled gun,
which was pointed towards me, elevated across the left arm and held
by the right hand. As I attempted to approach nearer they gradually
retreated.</p>

<p>Finding that I was not likely to gain ground upon them in this
way, I threw down my weapons, and advanced unarmed, hoping that if
they let me near them I might suddenly close with the eldest and
wrest his gun from him. After advancing about sixty or seventy
yards towards them, I found that they again began to retreat,
evidently determined not to let me approach any nearer, either
armed or unarmed. Upon this I halted, and endeavoured to enter into
parley with them, with a view to persuading them to return towards
Fowler's Bay, and thus obviate the painful necessity I should have
been under of endeavouring, for my own security, to take away the
life of the eldest whenever I met with him, should they still
persist in going the same road as myself. The distance we were
apart was almost too great for parley, and I know not whether they
heard me or not; though they halted, and appeared to listen, they
did not reply to what I said, and plainly wished to avoid all
closer contact. They now began to call incessantly to Wylie, and in
answer to my repeated efforts to get them to speak to me, only
would say, "Oh massa, we don't want you, we want Wylie." Thus fully
confirming me in the opinion I had formed, that Wylie had agreed to
go with them before the deed of violence was committed. It was now
apparent to me that their only present object in following us had
been to look for Wylie, and get him to join them. In this they were
unsuccessful; for he still remained quietly where I left him
holding the horses, and evidently afraid to go near them. There was
no use wasting further time, as I could not get them to listen to
me. The sun, too, was fast sinking in the horizon, we had been four
days without finding water, and the probability was we had very far
still to go before we could hope to procure any; every moment,
therefore, was precious.</p>

<p>Having returned to Wylie, I made him lead one of the horses in
advance, and I followed behind, driving the rest after him,
according to the system of march I had adopted in the morning. As
soon as the two natives saw us moving on, and found Wylie did not
join them, they set up a wild and plaintive cry, still following
along the brush parallel to our line of route, and never ceasing in
their importunities to Wylie, until the denseness of the scrub, and
the closing in of night, concealed us from each other.</p>

<p>I was now resolved to make the most of the opportunity afforded
me, and by travelling steadily onwards, to gain so much distance in
advance of the two natives as to preclude the possibility of their
again overtaking us until we had reached the water, if indeed we
were ever destined to reach water again. I knew that they would
never travel more than a few miles before lying down, especially if
carrying all the bread they had taken, the keg of water, guns, and
other articles. We had, however, seen none of these things with
them, except the fire-arms.</p>

<p>Our road was over scrubby and stony undulations, with patches of
dry grass here and there; in other parts, we passed over a very
sandy soil of a red colour, and overrun by immense tufts of prickly
grass (spinifex), many of which were three and four yards in
diameter. After pushing on for eighteen miles, I felt satisfied we
had left the natives far behind, and finding a patch of grass for
the horses, halted for the remainder of the night. It was quite
impossible, after all we had gone through, to think of watching the
horses, and my only means of preventing from them straying, was to
close the chains of their hobbles so tight, that they could not go
far; having thus secured them, we lay down, and for a few hours
enjoyed uninterrupted and refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>Moving on again on the 1st of May, as the sun was above the
horizon, we passed through a continuation of the same kind of
country, for sixteen miles, and then halted for a few hours during
the heat of the day. We had passed many recent traces of natives
both yesterday and to-day, who appeared to be travelling to the
westward. After dividing a pot of tea between us, we again pushed
on for twelve miles, completing a stage of twenty-eight miles, and
halting, with a little dry grass for the horses.</p>

<p>One circumstance in our route to-day cheered me greatly, and led
me shortly to expect some important and decisive change in the
character and formation of the country. It was the appearance for
the first time of the Banksia, a shrub which I had never before
found to the westward of Spencer's Gulf, but which I knew to abound
in the vicinity of King George's Sound, and that description of
country generally. Those only who have looked out with the
eagerness and anxiety of a person in my situation, to note any
change in the vegetation or physical appearance of a country, can
appreciate the degree of satisfaction with which I recognised and
welcomed the first appearance of the Banksia. Isolated as it was
amidst the scrub, and insignificant as the stunted specimens were
that I first met with, they led to an inference that I could not be
mistaken in, and added, in a tenfold degree, to the interest and
expectation with which every mile of our route had now become
invested.</p>

<p><i>May 2.</i>&mdash;We again moved away at dawn, through a
country which gradually become more scrubby, hilly, and sandy. The
horses crawled on for twenty-one miles, when I halted for an hour
to rest, and to have a little tea from our now scanty stock of
water. The change which I had noticed yesterday in the vegetation
of the country, was greater and more cheering every mile we went,
although as yet the country itself was as desolate and inhospitable
as ever.</p>

<p><i>May 3.</i>&mdash;The seventh day's dawn found us early
commencing our journey. The poor horses still crawled on, though
slowly. I was surprised that they were still alive, after the
continued sufferings and privations they had been subject to. As
for ourselves, we were both getting very weak and worn out, as well
as lame, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could get Wylie
to move, if he once sat down. I had myself the same kind of
apathetic feeling, and would gladly have laid down and slept for
ever. Nothing but a strong sense of duty prevented me from giving
way to this pleasing but fatal indulgence.</p>

<p>At ten miles from where we had slept, a native road led us down
a very steep part of the cliffs, and we descended to the beach. The
wretched horses could scarcely move, it was with the greatest
difficulty we got them down the hill, and now, although within
sight of our goal, I feared two of them would never reach it. By
perseverance we still got them slowly along, for two miles from the
base of the cliffs, and then turning in among the sand-drifts, to
our great joy and relief, found a place where the natives had dug
for water; thus at twelve o'clock on the seventh day since leaving
the last depot, we were again encamped at water, after having
crossed 150 miles of a rocky, barren, and scrubby table land.</p>

<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;After an early breakfast we gave the horses
as much water as they chose to drink, and removing their hobbles
gave them full liberty to range where they liked. I then left Wylie
to continue his slumbers, and taking my rifle, walked about three
miles among the sand-drifts to search for grass, but could find
none, except the coarse vegetation that grew amongst the
sand-drifts. I found two other places where the natives got water
by digging, and have no doubt that it may be procured almost
anywhere in these drifts, which extend for some miles, along the
coast.</p>

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;Up before day-break, and moved down to the
water to breakfast, then examined carefully round the wells, and
between the sand-drifts and the sea, to see if any foot-prints had
been made during the night, but none had. There were many pigeons
about, and as I had still some ammunition left, I felt the loss of
my gun severely. During the morning a very large eagle came and
settled near us, and I sent Wylie with the rifle to try to shoot
it; he crept within a very few yards of it, and being a good shot,
I felt sure of a hearty meal, but unfortunately the rifle missed
fire, having got damp during the heavy fall of dew a few evenings
before. We lost our dinner, but I received a useful lesson on the
necessity of taking better care of the only gun I had left, and
being always certain that it was in a fit and serviceable state; I
immediately set to work, cleaned and oiled it, and in the afternoon
made some oil-skin covers for the lock and muzzle to keep the damp
from it at nights.</p>

<p><i>May 6.</i>&mdash;After breakfast we carefully examined the
sand-drifts and the sea-shore, to see if the two boys had passed,
but there were no traces of them to be found, and I now felt that
we were secure from all further interruption from them.</p>

<p>The youngest of the two had been with me for four years, the
eldest for two years and a half, and both had accompanied me in all
my travels during these respective periods. Now that the first and
strong impressions naturally resulting from a shock so sudden and
violent as that produced by the occurrences of the 29th April, had
yielded, in some measure, to calmer reflections, I was able
maturely to weigh the whole of what had taken place, and to indulge
in some considerations in extenuation of their offence. The two
boys knew themselves to be as far from King George's Sound, as they
had already travelled from Fowler's Bay. They were hungry, thirsty,
and tired, and without the prospect of satisfying fully their
appetites, or obtaining rest for a long period of time, they
probably thought, that bad and inhospitable as had been the country
we had already traversed, we were daily advancing into one still
more so, and that we never could succeed in forcing a passage
through it; and they might have been strengthened in this belief by
the unlucky and incautiously-expressed opinions of the overseer. It
was natural enough, under such circumstances, that they should wish
to leave the party. Having come to that determination, and knowing
from previous experience, that they could not subsist upon what
they could procure for themselves in the bush, they had resolved to
take with them a portion of the provisions we had remaining, and
which they might look upon, perhaps, as their share by right. Nor
would Europeans, perhaps, have acted better. In desperate
circumstances men are ever apt to become discontented and impatient
of restraint, each throwing off the discipline and control he had
been subject to before, and each conceiving himself to have a right
to act independently when the question becomes one of life and
death.</p>

<p>Having decided upon leaving the party, and stealing a portion of
the provisions, their object would be to accomplish this as
effectually and as safely as they could; and in doing this, they
might, without having had the slightest intention originally, of
injuring either myself or the overseer, have taken such
precautions, and made such previous arrangements as led to the
fatal tragedy which occurred. All three of the natives were well
aware, that as long as they were willing to accompany us, they
would share with us whatever we had left; or that, if resolutely
bent upon leaving us, no restriction, save that of friendly advice,
would be imposed to prevent their doing so; but at the same time
they were aware that we would not have consented to divide our
little stock of food for the purpose of enabling any one portion of
the party to separate from the other, but rather that we would
forcibly resist any attempts to effect such a division, either
openly or by stealth. They knew that they never could succeed in
their plans openly, and that to do so by stealth effectually and
safely, it would first be necessary to secure all the fire-arms,
that they might incur no risk from our being alarmed before their
purpose was completed. No opportunity had occurred to bring their
intentions into operation until the evening in question, when the
scrubby nature of the country, the wildness of the night, the
overseer's sound sleeping, and my own protracted absence, at a
distance with the horses, had all conspired to favour them. I have
no doubt, that they first extinguished the fires, and then
possessing themselves of the fire-arms, proceeded to plunder the
baggage and select such things as they required. In doing this they
must have come across the ammunition, and loaded the guns
preparatory to their departure, but this might have been without
any premeditated intention of making use of them in the way they
did. At this unhappy juncture it would seem that the overseer must
have awoke, and advanced towards them to see what was the matter,
or to put a stop to their proceedings, when they fired on him, to
save themselves from being caught in their act of plunder. That
either of the two should have contemplated the committal of a
wilful, barbarous, cold-blooded murder, I cannot bring myself to
believe&mdash;no object was to be attained by it; and the fact of
the overseer having been pierced through the breast, and many yards
in advance of where he had been sleeping, in a direction towards
the sleeping-place of the natives, clearly indicated that it was
not until he had arisen from his sleep, and had been closely
pressing upon them, that they had fired the fatal shot. Such
appeared to me to be the most plausible and rational explanation of
this melancholy affair&mdash;I would willingly believe it to be the
true one.</p>

<p><i>May 8.</i>&mdash;About two hours before daylight, rain began
to fall, and continued steadily though lightly for three hours, so
that enough had fallen to deposit water in the ledges or holes of
the rocks. The day was wild and stormy, and we did not start until
late. Even then we could only get the tired horse along for three
miles, and were again compelled to halt.</p>

<p><i>May 9.</i>&mdash;The day was cold and cloudy, and we remained
in camp to rest the horses, and diminish the weight of meat, which
was greater than our horses could well carry in their present
state. Our progress was slow, and at eight miles I halted. Here we
found a little dry grass not far from the sea, and as the horses
did not require water, they fared tolerably well. This was the
first grass we had met with since we descended the cliffs on the
3rd instant. The horses having entirely subsisted since then on the
wiry vegetation which binds the sand-drifts together.</p>

<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;Upon moving away this morning, I kept
behind the sea shore along the borders of the salt swamp, steering
for some sand-hills which were seen a-head of us. A hill was now
visible in the distance, a little south of west, rising above the
level bank behind the shore,&mdash;this was the first hill,
properly so called, that we had met with for many hundreds of
miles, and it tended not a little to cheer us and confirm all
previous impressions relative to the change and improvement in the
character of the country. Our horses were dreadfully fatigued and
moved along with difficulty, and it was as much as we could do to
reach the sand-hills we had seen, though only seven miles away. In
our approach to them we passed through a fine plain full of grass,
and of a much better description than we had met with since leaving
Fowler's Bay. Not only was it long and in the greatest abundance,
but there were also mixed with the old grass many stalks of new and
green, the whole forming a rich and luxurious feast for our horses,
such as they had not enjoyed for many a long day. Nearer to the
sand-hills we obtained excellent water by digging, at a depth of
five feet, and only half a mile away from the grass. This place was
too favourable not to be made the most of, and I determined to halt
for a day or two to give our horses the benefit of it, and to
enable us to diminish the weight of meat they had to carry. Whilst
here I gave Wylie free permission to eat as much as he
could,&mdash;a privilege which he was not long in turning to
account. Between last night's supper and this morning's breakfast
he had got through six-and-a-half pounds of solid cooked flesh,
weighed out and free from bone, and he then complained, that as he
had so little water (the well had fallen in and he did not like the
trouble of cleaning it out again), he could hardly eat at all. On
an average he would consume nine pounds of meat per day.</p>

<p><i>June 2.</i>&mdash;As we had made a shorter stage yesterday
than I intended to have done, and the quantity of flour we had now
remaining was very small, I did not dare to make use of any this
morning, and we commenced our journey without breakfast. Being now
near Thistle Cove, where I intended to halt for some time, and kill
the little foal for food, whilst the other horses were recruiting,
and as I hoped to get there early this afternoon, I was anxious to
husband our little stock of flour in the hope, that at the little
fresh-water lake described by Flinders, as existing there, we
should find abundance of the flag-reed for our support. Keeping a
little behind the shore for the first hour, we crossed over the
sandy ridge bounding it, and upon looking towards the sea, I
thought I discovered a boat sailing in the bay. Upon pointing this
object out to Wylie, he was of the same opinion with myself, and we
at once descended towards the shore, but on our arrival were
greatly disappointed at not being able again to see the object of
our search. In the course of half an hour, however, whilst resting
ourselves and watching the surface of the ocean, it again became
visible, and soon after a second appeared. It was now evident that
both these were boats, and that we had noticed them only when
standing off shore, and the light shone upon their sails, and had
lost them when upon the opposite tack. It was equally apparent they
were standing out from the main land for the islands. I imagined
them to be sealers, who having entered the bay to procure water or
firewood, were again steering towards the islands to fish. Having
hastily made a fire upon one of the sand-hills, we fired shots,
shouted, waved handkerchiefs, and made every signal we could to
attract attention, but in vain. They were too far away to see, or
too busy to look towards us. The hopes we had entertained were as
suddenly disappointed as they had been excited, and we stood
silently and sullenly gazing after the boats as they gradually
receded from our view.</p>

<p>Whilst thus occupied and brooding over our disappointment, we
were surprised to see both boats suddenly lower their sails, and
apparently commence fishing. Watching them steadily we now
perceived that they were whale boats, and once more our hearts beat
with hope, for I felt sure that they must belong to some vessel
whaling in the neighbourhood. We now anxiously scanned the horizon
in every direction, and at last were delighted beyond measure to
perceive to the westward the masts of a large ship, peeping above a
rocky island which had heretofore concealed her from our view. She
was apparently about six miles from us, and as far as we could
judge from so great a distance, seemed to be at anchor near the
shore.</p>

<p>Poor Wylie's joy now knew no bounds, and he leapt and skipped
about with delight as he congratulated me once more upon the
prospect of getting plenty to eat. I was not less pleased than he
was, and almost as absurd, for although the vessel was quietly at
anchor so near us, with no sails loose and her boats away, I could
not help fearing that she might disappear before we could get to
her, or attract the notice of those on board. To prevent such a
calamity, I mounted one of the strongest horses and pushed on by
myself as rapidly as the heavy nature of the sands would allow,
leaving Wylie at his own especial request to bring on the other
horses. In a short time I arrived upon the summit of a rocky cliff,
opposite to a fine large barque lying at anchor in a well sheltered
bay, (which I subsequently named Rossiter Bay, after the captain of
the whaler,) immediately east of Lucky Bay, and at less than a
quarter of a mile distant from the shore. The people on board
appeared to be busily engaged in clearing their cables which were
foul, and did not observe me at all. I tied up my horse, therefore,
to a bush, and waited for Wylie, who was not long in coming after
me, having driven the poor horses at a pace they had not been
accustomed to for many a long day. I now made a smoke on the rock
where I was, and hailed the vessel, upon which a boat instantly put
off, and in a few moments I had the inexpressible pleasure of being
again among civilized beings, and of shaking hands with a
fellow-countryman in the person of Captain Rossiter, commanding the
French Whaler "Mississippi".</p>

<p>Our story was soon told, and we were received with the greatest
kindness and hospitality by the captain.</p>

<p><i>June 2.</i>&mdash;After watering the horses at a deposit left
by the rains, in the sheets of granite near us, and turning them
loose, we piled up our little baggage, and in less than an hour we
were comfortably domiciled on board the hospitable
Mississippi,&mdash;a change in our circumstances so great, so
sudden, and so unexpected, that it seemed more like a dream than a
reality; from the solitary loneliness of the wilderness, and its
attendant privations, we were at once removed to all the comforts
of a civilised community.</p>

<p>After we had done ample justice to the good cheer set before us,
by our worthy host, he kindly invited us to remain on board as long
as we pleased, to recruit our horses, and told us, that when we
felt refreshed sufficiently to renew the journey, he would supply
us with such stores and other articles as we might require. I
learnt that the Mississippi had but recently arrived from France,
and that she had only been three weeks upon the ground she had
taken up for the season's whaling. As yet no whales had been seen,
and the season was said not to commence before the end of June or
beginning of July. The boats I saw in the morning belonged to her,
and had been out chasing what they thought to be a whale, but which
proved to be only a fin-back, a species which was not thought to
repay the trouble of trying out.</p>

<p>Early in the evening the whalers retired to rest, and I had a
comfortable berth provided for me in the cabin, but could not
sleep; my thoughts were too much occupied in reflecting upon the
great change which the last few hours had wrought in the position
of myself and my attendant. Sincerely grateful to the Almighty for
having guided us through so many difficulties, and for the
inexpressible relief afforded us when so much needed, but so little
expected, I felt doubly thankful for the mercy we experienced,
when, as I lay awake, I heard the wind roar, and the rain drive
with unusual wildness, and reflected that by God's blessing, we
were now in safety, and under shelter from the violence of the
storm, and the inclemency of the west season, which appeared to be
setting in, but which, under the circumstances we were in but a few
short hours ago, we should have been so little able to cope with,
or to endure.</p>

<p><i>June 5.</i>&mdash;From this time until the fourteenth of June
I remained on board the Mississippi, enjoying the hospitality of
Captain Rossiter. Wylie went out once or twice to try to shoot a
kangaroo for the ship, but he never succeeded; he had so much to
eat on board that he had no stimulus to exertion, and did not take
the trouble necessary to insure success. During almost the whole of
the time that I remained on board the Mississippi, the weather was
exceedingly boisterous, cold, and wet, and I could not but feel
truly thankful that I had not been exposed to it on shore; even on
board the ship, with shelter and extra clothing, I felt very
sensibly the great change which had taken place in the
temperature.</p>

<p><i>June 15.</i>&mdash;Early this morning the boat came on shore
for me, and I went on board to take a farewell breakfast, in the
Mississippi, and to wish good bye to her kind-hearted people. At
eight I landed with the Captain, got up my horses and loaded them,
a matter of some little time and trouble, now my stock of
provisions and other things was so greatly augmented; in addition
too to all I had accumulated before, the Captain insisted now upon
my taking six bottles of wine, and a tin of sardines.</p>

<p>Having received a few letters to be posted at Albany for France,
I asked the Captain if there was anything else I could do for him,
but he said there was not. The only subject upon which he was at
all anxious, was to ascertain whether a war had broken out between
France and England or not. In the event of this being the case, he
wished me not to mention having seen a French vessel upon the
coast, and I promised to comply with his request.</p>

<p>After wishing my kind host good bye, and directing Wylie to lead
one of the horses in advance, I brought up the rear, driving the
others before me. Once again we had a long and arduous journey
before us, and were wending our lonely way through the unknown and
untrodden wilds. We were, however, in very different circumstances
now, to what we had been in previous to our meeting with the French
ship. The respite we had had from our labours, and the generous
living we had enjoyed, had rendered us comparatively fresh and
strong. We had now with us an abundance, not only of the
necessaries, but of the luxuries of life; were better clothed, and
provided against the inclemency of the weather than we had been;
and entered upon the continuation of our undertaking with a spirit,
an energy, and a confidence, that we had long been strangers
to.</p>

<p><i>July 7.</i>&mdash;Getting up the horses early, we proceeded
up the King's river, with a view of attempting to cross, but upon
sounding the depths in one or two places, I found the tide, which
was rising, was too high; I had only the alternative, therefore, of
waiting for several hours until the water ebbed, or else of leaving
the horses, and proceeding on without them. Under all the
circumstances, I decided upon the latter; the rain was still
falling very heavily, and the river before us was so wide and so
dangerous for horses, from its very boggy character, that I did not
think it prudent to attempt to force a passage, or worth while to
delay to search for a proper crossing place. There was good feed
for the horses where they were, and plenty of water, so that I knew
they would fare better by remaining than if they were taken on to
the Sound; whilst it appeared to me more than probable that I
should have no difficulty, whenever I wished to get them, to
procure a guide to go for and conduct them safely across, at the
proper crossing place.</p>

<p>For a great part of the way we walked up to our ankles in water.
This made our progress slow, and rendered our last day's march a
very cold and disagreeable one. Before reaching the Sound, we met a
native, who at once recognised Wylie, and greeted him most
cordially. From him we learnt that we had been expected at the
Sound some months ago, but had long been given up for lost, whilst
Wylie had been mourned for and lamented as dead by his friends and
his tribe. The rain still continued falling heavily as we ascended
to the brow of the hill immediately overlooking the town of
Albany&mdash;not a soul was to be seen&mdash;not an animal of any
kind&mdash;the place looked deserted and uninhabited, so completely
had the inclemency of the weather driven both man and beast to seek
shelter from the storm.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood gazing at the town below me&mdash;that goal
I had so long looked forward to, had so laboriously toiled to
attain, was at last before me. A thousand confused images and
reflections crowded through my mind, and the events of the past
year were recalled in rapid succession. The contrast between the
circumstances under which I had commenced and terminated my labours
stood in strong relief before me. The gay and gallant cavalcade
that accompanied me on my way at starting&mdash;the small but
enterprising band that I then commanded, the goodly array of horses
and drays, with all their well-ordered appointments and equipment
were conjured up in all their circumstances of pride and pleasure;
and I could not restrain a tear, as I called to mind the
embarrassing difficulties and sad disasters that had broken up my
party, and left myself and Wylie the two sole wanderers remaining
at the close of an undertaking entered upon under such hopeful
auspices.</p>

<p>Upon entering the town I proceeded direct to Mr. Sherrats',
where I had lodged when in King George's Sound, in 1840. By him and
his family I was most hospitably received, and every attention
shewn to me; and in the course of a short time, after taking a
glass of hot brandy and water, performing my ablutions and putting
on a clean suit of borrowed clothes, I was enabled once more to
feel comparatively comfortable, and to receive the many kind
friends who called upon me.</p>

<p>Finding that a vessel would shortly sail for Adelaide, I at once
engaged my passage, and proceeded to make arrangements for leaving
King George's Sound.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>XVI. THE BURKE AND WILLS
EXPEDITION</h3>

<blockquote>[THE purpose of the Burke and Wills expedition, which
set out from Melbourne in 1860, was to cross the continent from
south to north. By making a dash from his depot on Cooper's Creek,
Burke succeeded in reaching the mouth of the Flinders River, which
flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria. But through a series of
mishaps, tragedy marked the end of the expedition. The two leaders
perished from thirst and starvation on the Barcoo, and one of the
men who had accompanied them, Gray, also died, of exhaustion. The
fourth of the party, King, saved his life through the kindness of a
native tribe with which he took refuge. The three following
narratives consist of Burke's last despatch, which was found
amongst the papers found at Cooper's Creek; of King's narrative and
of Wills's account of the dash from Cooper's Creek to the Gulf. The
two first-mentioned documents are contained in the pamphlet on
<i>The Burke and Wills Exploring Expedition</i>, published at
Melbourne, 1861; the third is from Wills's journal, published in
the volume entitled <i>A Successful Exploration through the
Interior of Australia*</i>, compiled from Wills's papers by his
father, and published at London, 1863.]<br></blockquote>

<h4>(A) Burke's Last Despatch</h4>

<p>The following is the last despatch written by Mr. Burke. It was
found amongst the papers deposited on Cooper's Creek:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Depot 2, Cooper's Creek Camp 65.&mdash;</p>

<p>The return party from Carpentaria, consisting of myself, Wills,
and King (Gray dead), arrived here last night and found that the
depot party had only started on the same day. We proceed on,
to-morrow, slowly down the creek towards Adelaide by Mount
Hopeless, and shall endeavour to follow Gregory's track; but we are
very weak. The two camels are done up, and we shall not be able to
travel faster than four or five miles a day. Gray died on the road,
from exhaustion and fatigue. We have all suffered much from hunger.
The provisions left here will, I think, restore our strength. We
have discovered a practicable route to Carpentaria, the chief
position of which lies in the 140 degrees of East longitude. There
is some good country between this and the Stony Desert. From thence
to the tropics the land is dry and stony. Between the Carpentaria a
considerable portion is rangy, but well watered and richly grassed.
We reached the shores of Carpentaria on the 11th of February, 1861.
Greatly disappointed at finding the party here gone.</p>

<p>(Signed) ROBERT O'HARA BURKE, Leader.<br>
April 22, 1861.</p>

<p>P.S. The camels cannot travel, and we cannot walk, or we should
follow the other party. We shall move very slowly down the
creek.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>(B) King's Narrative</h4>

<p>Mr. Burke, Mr. Wills, and I, reached the depot at Cooper's
Creek, on April 2 1st, about half-past seven in the evening, with
two camels; all that remained of the six Mr. Burke took with him.
All the provisions we then had consisted of one-and-a-half pound of
dried meat. We found the party had gone the same day; and looking
about for any mark they might have left, found the tree with 'DIG,
Ap. 21.' Mr. Wills said the party had left for the Darling. We dug
and found the plant of stores. Mr. Burke took the papers out of the
bottle, and then asked each of us whether we were able to proceed
up the creek in pursuit of the party; we said not, and he then said
that he thought it his duty to ask us, but that he himself was
unable to do so, but that he had decided upon trying to make Mount
Hopeless, as he had been assured by the Committee in Melbourne,
that there was a cattle station within 150 miles of Cooper's Creek.
Mr. Wills was not inclined to follow this plan, and wished to go
down our old track; but at last gave in to Mr. Burke's wishes. I
also wished to go down by our old track. We remained four or five
days to recruit, making preparations to go down the creek by stages
of four or five miles a day, and Mr. Burke placed a paper in the
plant stating what were our plans. Travelling down the creek, we
got some fish from the natives; and some distance down, one of the
camels (Landa) got bogged, and although we remained there that day
and part of the next, trying to dig him out, we found our strength
insufficient to do so. The evening of the second day we shot him as
he lay, and having cut off as much meat as we could, we lived on it
while we stayed to dry the remainder. Throwing all the least
necessary things away, we made one load for the remaining camel
(Rajah), and each of us carried a swag of about twenty-five pounds.
We were then tracing down the branches of the creek running south,
and found that they ran out into earthy plains. We had understood
that the creek along Gregory's track was continuous; and finding
that all these creeks ran out into plains, Mr. Burke returned, our
camel being completely knocked up. We then intended to give the
camel a spell for a few days, and to make a new attempt to push on
forty or fifty miles to the south, in the hope of striking the
creek. During the time that the camel was being rested, Mr. Burke
and Mr. Wills went in search of the natives, to endeavour to find
out how the nardoo grew. Having found their camp, they obtained as
much nardoo cake and fish as they could eat, but could not explain
that they wished to be shown how to find the seed themselves: they
returned on the third day bringing some fish and nardoo cake with
them. On the following day the camel Rajah seemed very ill, and I
told Mr. Burke I thought he could not linger out more than four
days, and as on the same evening the poor brute was on the point of
dying, Mr. Burke ordered him to be shot; I did so, and we cut him
up with two broken knives and a lancet: we cured the meat and
planted it, and Mr. Burke then made another attempt to find the
nardoo, taking me with him: we went down the creek expecting to
find the natives at the camp where they had been last seen, but
found that they had left; and not knowing whether they had gone up
or down the creek, we slept in their gunyahs that night, and on the
following morning returned to Mr. Wills. The next day, Mr. Burke
and I started up the creek, but could see nothing of them, and were
three days away, when we returned and remained three days in our
camp with Mr. Wills. We then made a plant of all the articles we
could not carry with us, leaving five pounds of rice and a quantity
of meat, and then followed up the creek to where there were some
good native huts. We remained at that place a few days; and finding
that our provisions were beginning to run short, Mr. Burke said,
that we ought to do something, and that if we did not find the
nardoo, we should starve, and that he intended to save a little
dried meat and rice to carry us to Mount Hopeless. The three of us
then came to the conclusion that it would be better to make a
second attempt to reach Mount Hopeless, as we were then as strong
as we were likely to be, our daily allowance being then reduced.
Mr. Burke asked each of us whether we were willing to make another
attempt to reach the South Australian settlements, and we decided
on going; we took with us what remained of the provisions we had
planted two-and-a-half pounds of oatmeal, a small quantity of
flour, and the dried meat: this, with powder and shot, and other
small articles, made up our swags to thirty pounds each, and Mr.
Burke carried one billy of water; and I another. We had not gone
far before we came on a flat, where I saw a plant growing which I
took to be clover, and on looking closer saw the seed, and called
out that I had found the nardoo; they were very glad when I found
it. We travelled three days, and struck a watercourse coming south
from Cooper's Creek; we traced this as it branched out and
re-formed in the plains, until we at last lost it in flat country;
sandhills were in front of us, for which we made, and travelled all
day but found no water. We were all greatly fatigued, as our
rations now consisted of only one small Johnny cake and three
sticks of dried meat daily. We camped that evening about four
o'clock, intending to push next day until two o'clock P.M., and
then, should we not find water, to return. We travelled and found
no water, and the three of us sat down and rested for one hour, and
then turned back. We all felt satisfied that had there been a few
days' rain we could have got through: we were then, according to
Mr. Wills's calculation, forty-five miles from the creek. We
travelled, on the day we turned back, very late, and the following
evening reached the nearest water at the creek. We gathered some
nardoo and boiled the seeds, as we were unable to pound them. The
following day we reached the main creek; and knowing where there
was a fine waterhole and native gunyahs, we went there intending to
save what remained of our flour and dried meat for the purpose of
making another attempt to reach Mount Hopeless. On the following
day Mr. Wills and I went out to gather nardoo, of which we obtained
a supply sufficient for three days, and finding a pounding stone at
the gunyahs, Mr. Burke and I pounded the seed, which was such slow
work that we were compelled to use half flour and half nardoo. Mr.
Burke and Mr. Wills then went down the creek for the remainder of
the dried meat which we had planted; and we had now all our things
with us, gathering nardoo and living the best way we could. Mr.
Burke requested Mr. Wills to go up the creek as far as the depot,
and to place a note in the plant there, stating that we were then
living on the creek, the former note having stated that we were on
our road to South Australia. He also was to bury there the
field-books of the journey to the Gulf. Before starting he got
three pounds of flour and four pounds of pounded nardoo, and about
a pound of meat, as he expected to be absent about eight days.
During his absence I gathered nardoo and pounded it, as Mr. Burke
wished to lay in a supply in case of rain.</p>

<p>A few days after Mr. Wills left, some natives came down the
creek to fish at some waterholes near our camp. They were very
civil to us at first and offered us some fish. On the second day
they came again to fish, and Mr. Burke took down two bags, which
they filled for him. On the third day they gave us one bag of fish,
and afterwards all came to our camp. We used to keep our ammunition
and other articles in one gunyah, and all three of us lived
together in another. One of the natives took an oilcloth out of
this gunyah, and Mr. Burke seeing him run away with it followed him
with his revolver and fired over his head, and upon this the native
dropt the oilcloth; while he was away, the other blacks invited me
away to a waterhole to eat fish, but I declined to do so as Mr.
Burke was absent, and a number of natives were about who would have
taken all our things. When I refused, one took his boomerang and
laid it over my shoulder, and then told me by signs that if I
called out for Mr. Burke (as I was doing) that he would strike me;
upon this I got them all in front of the gunyah and fired a
revolver over their heads, but they did not seem at all afraid
until I got out the gun, when they all ran away. Mr. Burke hearing
the report came back, and we saw no more of them until late that
night, when they came with some cooked fish and called out 'white
fellow.' Mr. Burke then went out with his revolver, and found a
whole tribe coming down, all painted, and with fish in small nets
carried by two men. Mr. Burke went to meet them, and they wished to
surround him; but he knocked as many of the nets of fish out of
their hands as he could, and shouted out to me to fire. I did so,
and they ran off. We collected five small nets of cooked fish. The
reason he would not accept the fish from them was, that he was
afraid of being too friendly lest they should be always at our
camp. We then lived on fish until Mr. Wills returned. He told us
that he had met the natives soon after leaving us, and that they
were very kind to him, and had given him plenty to eat both on
going up and returning. He seemed to consider that he should have
very little difficulty in living with them, and as their camp was
close to ours he returned to them the same day and found them very
hospitable and friendly, keeping him with them two days. They then
made signs to him to be off: he came to us and narrated what had
happened, but went back to them the following day, when they gave
him his breakfast, but made signs for him to go away; he pretended
not to understand them, and would not go, upon which they made
signs that they were going up the creek, and that he had better go
down: they packed up and left the camp, giving Mr. Wills a little
nardoo to take to us.</p>

<p>During his absence, while Mr. Burke was cooking some fish during
a strong wind, the flames caught the gunyah and burned so rapidly
that we were unable not only to put it out but to save any of our
things, excepting one revolver and a gun. Mr. Wills having
returned, it was decided to go up the creek and live with the
natives if possible, as Mr. Wills thought we should have but little
difficulty in obtaining provisions from them if we camped on the
opposite side of the creek to them. He said he knew where they were
gone, so we packed up and started. Coming to the gunyahs where we
expected to have found them, we were disappointed, and seeing a
nardoo field close by halted, intending to make it our camp. For
some time we were employed gathering nardoo, and laying up a
supply. Mr. Wills and I used to collect and carry home a bag each
day, and Mr. Burke generally pounded sufficient for our dinner
during our absence; but Mr. Wills found himself getting very weak,
and was shortly unable to go out to gather nardoo as before, or
even strong enough to pound it, so that in a few days he became
almost helpless. I still continued gathering, and Mr. Burke now
also began to feel very weak, and said he could be of very little
use in pounding; I had now to gather and pound for all three of us.
I continued to do this for a few days; but finding my strength
rapidly failing, my legs being very weak and painful, I was unable
to go out for several days, and we were compelled to consume six
days' stock which we had laid by. Mr. Burke now proposed that I
should gather as much as possible in three days, and that with this
supply we should go in search of the natives&mdash;a plan which had
been urged upon us by Mr. Wills as the only chance of saving him
and ourselves as well, as he clearly saw that I was no longer able
to collect sufficient for our wants. Raving collected the seed as
proposed, and having pounded sufficient to last Mr. Wills for eight
days, and two days for ourselves, we placed water and firewood
within his reach and started; before leaving him, however, Mr.
Burke asked him whether he still wished it, as under no other
circumstance would he leave him, and Mr. Wills again said that he
looked on it as our only chance. He then gave Mr. Burke a letter
and his watch for his father, and we buried the remainder of the
field-books near the gunyah. Mr. Wills said that, in case of my
surviving Mr. Burke, he hoped that I would carry out his last
wishes, iii giving the watch and letter to his father.</p>

<p>In travelling the first day, Mr. Burke seemed very weak, and
complained of great pain in his legs and back. On the second day he
seemed to be better, and said that he thought he was getting
stronger, but on starting, did not go two miles before he said he
could go no further. I persisted in his trying to go on, and
managed to get him along several times, until I saw that he was
almost knocked up, when he said he could not carry his swag, and
threw all he had away. I also reduced mine, taking nothing but a
gun and some powder and shot, and a small pouch and some matches.
In starting again, we did not go far before Mr. Burke said we
should halt for the night; but as the place was close to a large
sheet of water, and exposed to the wind, I prevailed on him to go a
little further, to the next reach of water, where we camped. We
searched about and found a few small patches of nardoo, which I
collected and pounded, and with a crow, which I shot, made a good
evening's meal. From the time we halted Mr. Burke seemed to be
getting worse, although he ate his supper; he said he felt
convinced he could not last many hours, and gave me his watch,
which he said belonged to the committee, and a pocket-book to give
to Sir William Stawell, and in which he wrote some notes. He then
said to me, 'I hope you will remain with me here till I am quite
dead&mdash;it is a comfort to know that some one is by; but, when I
am dying, it is my wish that you should place the pistol in my
right hand, and that you leave me unburied as I lie.' That night he
spoke very little, and the following morning I found him
speechless, or nearly so, and about eight o'clock he expired. I
remained a few hours there, but as I saw there was no use remaining
longer I went up the creek in search of the natives. I felt very
lonely, and at night usually slept in deserted wurleys belonging to
the natives. Two days after leaving the spot where Mr. Burke died,
I found some gunyahs where the natives had deposited a bag of
nardoo, sufficient to last me a fortnight, and three bundles
containing various articles. I also shot a crow that evening; but
was in great dread that the natives would come and deprive me of
the nardoo.</p>

<p>I remained there two days to recover my strength, and then
returned to Mr. Wills. I took back three crows; but found him lying
dead in his gunyah, and the natives had been there and had taken
away some of his clothes. I buried the corpse with sand, and
remained there some days, but finding that my stock of nardoo was
running short, and as I was unable to gather it, I tracked the
natives who had been to the camp by their footprints in the sand,
and went some distance down the creek shooting crows and hawks on
the road. The natives, hearing the report of the gun, came to meet
me, and took me with them to their camp, giving me nardoo and fish:
they took the birds I had shot and cooked them for me, and
afterwards showed me a gunyah where I was to sleep with three of
the single men. The following morning they commenced talking to me,
and putting one finger on the ground and covering it with sand, at
the same time pointing up the creek saying 'white fellow,' which I
understood to mean that one white man was dead. From this I knew
that they were the tribe who had taken Mr. Wills's clothes. They
then asked me where the third white man was, and I also made the
sign of putting two fingers on the ground and covering them with
sand, at the same time pointing up the creek. They appeared to feel
great compassion for me when they understood that I was alone on
the creek, and gave me plenty to eat. After being four days with
them, I saw that they were becoming tired of me, and they made
signs that they were going up the creek and that I had better go
downwards; but I pretended not to understand them. The same day
they shifted camp, and I followed them, and on reaching their camp
I shot some arrows, which pleased them so much that they made me a
break-wind in the centre of their camp, and came and sat round me
until such time as the crows were cooked, when they assisted me to
eat them. The same day one of the women, to whom I had given part
of a crow, came and gave me a ball of nardoo, saying that she would
give me more only she had such a sore arm that she was unable to
pound. She showed me a sore on her arm, and the thought struck me
that I would boil some water in the billy and wash her arm with a
sponge. During the operation, the whole tribe sat round and were
muttering one to another. Her husband sat down by her side, and she
was crying all the time. After I had washed it, I touched it with
some nitrate of silver, when she began to yell, and ran off, crying
out 'Mokow! Mokow!' (Fire! Fire!). From this time, she and her
husband used to give me a small quantity of nardoo both night and
morning, and whenever the tribe was about going on a fishing
excursion he used to give me notice to go with them. They also used
to assist me in making a wurley or break-wind whenever they shifted
camp. I generally shot a crow or a hawk, and gave it to them in
return for these little services. Every four or five days the tribe
would surround me and ask whether I intended going up or down the
creek; at last I made them understand that if they went up I should
go up the creek, and if they went down I should also go down; and
from this time they seemed to look upon me as one of themselves,
and supplied me with fish and nardoo regularly: they were very
anxious, however, to know where Mr. Burke lay, and one day when we
were fishing in the waterholes close by, I took them to the spot.
On seeing his remains, the whole party wept bitterly, and covered
them with bushes. After this, they were much kinder to me than
before, and I always told them that the white men would be here
before two moons; and in the evening when they came with nardoo and
fish they used to talk about the 'white-fellows' coming, at the
same time pointing to the moon. I also told them they would receive
many presents, and they constantly asked me for tomahawks, called
by them, 'Bomay Ko.' From this time to when the relief party
arrived, a period of about a month, they treated me with uniform
kindness, and looked upon me as one of themselves. The day on which
I was released, one of the tribe who had been fishing came and told
me that the 'white fellows', were coming, and the whole of the
tribe who were then in camp sallied out in every direction to meet
the party, while the man who had brought the news took me over the
creek, where I shortly saw the party coming down.</p>

<h4>(C) Wills' Account of the Dash to the Gulf of Carpentaria</h4>

<p><i>Sunday, 16th December</i>, 1860.&mdash;The horse having been
shod and our reports finished, we started at 6.40 A.M. for Eyre's
Creek, the party consisting of Mr. Burke, myself, King, and
Charley, having with us six camels, one horse, and three months'
provisions. We followed down the creek to the point where the
sandstone ranges cross the creek, and were accompanied to that
place by Brahe, who would return to take charge of the depot. Down
to this point the banks of the creek are very rugged and stony, but
there is a tolerable supply of grass and salt bush in the vicinity.
A large tribe of blacks came pestering us to go to their camp and
have a dance, which we declined. They were very troublesome, and
nothing but the threat to shoot them will keep them away. They are,
however, easily frightened; and, although fine-looking men,
decidedly not of a warlike disposition. They show the greatest
inclination to take whatever they can, but will run no unnecessary
risk in so doing. They seldom carry any weapon, except a shield and
a large kind of boomerang, which I believe they use for killing
rats, etc. Sometimes, but very seldom, they have a large spear;
reed spears seem to be quite unknown to them. They are undoubtedly
a finer and better-looking race of men than the blacks on the
Murray and Darling, and more peaceful; but in other respects I
believe they will not compare favourably with them, for from the
little we have seen of them, they appear to be mean-spirited and
contemptible in every respect.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 17th December</i>, 1860.&mdash;We continued to follow
down the creek. Found its course very crooked, and the channel
frequently dry for a considerable distance, and then forming into
magnificent waterholes, abounding in water fowl of all kinds. The
country on each side is more open than on the upper part of the
creek. The soil on the plains is of a light earthy nature,
supporting abundance of salt bush and grass. Most of the plains are
lightly timbered, and the ground is finer and not cracked up as at
the head of the creek. Left Camp 67 at ten minutes to six A.M.,
having breakfasted before leaving. We followed the creek along from
point to point, at first in a direction west-north-west for about
twelve miles, then about north-west. At about noon we passed the
last water, a short distance beyond which the creek runs out on a
polygonum* flat; but the timber was so large and dense that it
deceived us into the belief that there was a continuation of the
channel. On crossing the polygonum ground to where we expected to
find the creek we became aware of our mistake. Not thinking it
advisable to chance the existence of water ahead, we camped at the
end of a large but shallow sheet of water in the sandy bed of the
creek.</p>

<p class="foot">[* Polygonum Cunninghami.]</p>

<p>The hole was about 150 links broad, and * {* Blank in original.}
feet deep in most places. In many places the temperature of the
water was almost incredibly high, which induced me to try it at
several points. The mean of two on the shady side of the creek gave
97 4/10 degrees. As may be imagined this water tasted disagreeably
warm, but we soon cooled some in water bags, and thinking that it
would be interesting to know what we might call cool, I placed the
thermometer in a pannikin containing some that appeared
delightfully so, almost cold in fact; its temperature was, to our
astonishment, 78 degrees. At half-past six, when a strong wind was
blowing from south, and temperature of air had fallen to 80
degrees, the lowest temperature of water in the hose, that had been
exposed to the full effect of evaporation for several hours was 72
degrees. This water for drinking appeared positively cold, and is
too low a temperature to be pleasant under the circumstances. A
remarkable southerly squall came on between five and six P.M., with
every appearance of rain. The sky however soon cleared, but the
wind continued to blow in a squally and irregular manner from the
same quarter at evening.</p>

<b>BURKE AND WILLS'S ROUTE TO THE GULF OF CARPENTARIA, 1861</b>
</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 19th December</i>, 1860.&mdash;Started at a
quarter-past eight A.M., leaving what seemed to be the end of
Cooper's Creek. We took a course a little to the north of west,
intending to try and obtain water in some of the creeks that Sturt
mentioned that he had crossed, and at the same time to see whether
they were connected with Cooper's Creek, as appeared most probable
from the direction in which we found the latter running, and from
the manner in which it had been breaking up into small channels,
flowing across the plains in a north and north-north-west
direction. We left on our right the flooded flats on which this
branch of the creek runs out, and soon came to a series of sand
ridges, the directions of which were between north half-west and
north-north-west. The country is well grassed and supports plenty
of salt bush. Many of the valleys are liable to be inundated by the
overflow of the main creek. They have watercourses and polygonum
flats bordered with box trees, but we met with no holes fit to hold
a supply of water. At about ten miles we crossed a large earthy
flat lightly timbered with box and gum. The ground was very bad for
travelling on, being much cracked up and intersected by innumerable
channels, which continually carried off the water of a large creek.
Some of the valleys beyond this were very pretty, the ground being
sound and covered with fresh plants, which made them look
beautifully green. At fifteen miles we halted, where two large
plains joined. Our attention had been attracted by some
red-breasted cockatoos, pigeons, a crow, and several other birds,
whose presence made us feel sure that there was water not far off;
but our hopes were soon destroyed by finding a claypan just drying
up. It contained just sufficient liquid to make the clay boggy. At
ten minutes to seven P.M., we moved on, steering straight for
Eyre's Creek, north-west by north, intending to make a good night's
journey and avoid the heat of the day; but at a mile and a half we
came to a creek which looked so well that we followed it for a
short distance, and finding two or three waterholes of good milky
water we camped for the night. This enabled me to secure an
observation of the eclipse of Jupiter's (I) satellite, as well as
some latitude observations. The night was so calm that I used the
water as an horizon; but I find it much more satisfactory to take
the mercury for several reasons.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 20th December.</i>&mdash;We did not leave this camp
until half-past eight, having delayed to refill the water-bags with
the milky water, which all of us found to be a great treat again.
It is certainly more pleasant to drink than the clear water, and at
the same time more satisfying. Our course from here, north-west by
north, took us through some pretty country, lightly timbered and
well grassed. We could see the line of creek timber winding through
the valley on our left. At a distance of five miles there was a
bush fire on its banks, and beyond it the creek made a considerable
bend to the south-west. At two miles farther we came in sight of a
large lagoon bearing north by west, and at three miles more we
camped on what would seem the same creek as last night, near where
it enters the lagoon. The latter is of great extent and contains a
large quantity of water, which swarms with wild fowl of every
description. It is very shallow, but is surrounded by the most
pleasing woodland scenery, and everything in the vicinity looks
fresh and green. The creek near its junction with the lagoon
contains some good waterholes five to six feet deep. They are found
in a sandy alluvium which is very boggy when wet. There was a large
camp of not less than forty or fifty blacks near where we stopped.
They brought us presents of fish, for which we gave them some beads
and matches. These fish we found to be a most valuable addition to
our rations. They were of the same kind as we had found elsewhere,
but finer, being from nine to ten inches long, and two to three
inches deep, and in such good condition that they might have been
fried in their own fat. It is a remarkable fact, that these were
the first blacks who have offered us any fish since we reached
Cooper's Creek.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 21st December.</i>&mdash;We left Camp 70 at half-past
five A.M., and tried to induce one or two of the blacks to go with
us, but it was of no use. Keeping our former course we were pulled
up at three miles by a fine lagoon, and then by the creek that
flows into it; the latter being full of water, we were obliged to
trace it a mile up before we could cross. I observed on its banks
two wild plants of the gourd or melon tribe, one much resembling a
stunted cucumber: the other, both in leaf and appearance of fruit,
was very similar to a small model of a water melon.* The latter
plant I also found at Camp 68. On tasting the pulp of the
newly-found fruit, which was about the size of a large pea, I found
it to be so acrid that it was with difficulty that I removed the
taste from my mouth. At eight or nine miles from where we crossed
the creek we passed another large lagoon, leaving it two miles on
our left, and shortly afterwards we saw one nearly as far on our
right. This last we should have availed ourselves of, but that we
expected to find water in a creek which we could see, by the timber
lining its banks, flowed from the lagoon on our left and crossed
our course a few miles ahead. We reached it at a distance of four
or five miles farther, and found a splendid waterhole at which we
camped. The creek at the point flows in a northerly direction
through a large lightly timbered flat, on which it partially runs
out. The ground is, however, sound and well clothed with grass and
salsolaceous plants. Up to this point the country through which we
have passed has been of the finest description for pastoral
purposes. The grass and saltbush are everywhere abundant, and water
is plentiful with every appearance of permanence. We met with
porcupine grass,** and only two sand ridges before reaching Camp
71.</p>

<b>WILLIAM JOHN WILLS</b>
</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 22nd December.</i>&mdash;At five minutes to five
A.M. we left one of the most delightful camps we have had in the
journey, and proceeded on the same course as before, north-west by
north, across some high ridges of loose sand, many of which were
partially clothed with porcupine grass. We found the ground much
worse to travel over than any we have yet met with, as the ridges
were exceedingly abrupt and steep on their eastern side, and
although sloping gradually towards the west, were so honeycombed in
some places by the burrows of rats, that the camels were
continually in danger of falling. At a distance of about six miles,
we descended from these ridges to undulating country of open box
forest, where everything was green and fresh. There is an abundance
of grass and salt bushes, and lots of birds of all descriptions.
Several flocks of pigeons passed over our heads, making for a point
a little to our right, where there is no doubt plenty of water, but
we did not go off our course to look for it. Beyond the box forest,
which keeps away to the right, we again entered the sand ridges,
and at a distance of six miles, passed close to a dry salt lagoon,
the ridges in the vicinity of which are less regular in their form
and direction, and contain nodules of limestone. The ground in the
flats and claypans near, has that encrusted surface that cracks
under the pressure of the foot, and is a sure indication of saline
deposits. At a distance of eight miles from the lagoon, we camped
at the foot of a sand ridge, jutting out on the stony desert. I was
rather disappointed, but not altogether surprised, to find the
latter nothing more nor less than the stony rises that we had
before met with, only on a larger scale and not quite as
undulating. During the afternoon several crows came to feed on the
plain. They came from an east-north-east direction, no doubt from a
portion of the creek that flows through the forest that we left on
our right. In the morning, as we were loading, a duck passed over,
but it was too dark to see which way it went.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 23rd December.</i>&mdash;At five A.M. we struck out
across the desert in a west-north-west direction. At four and
a-half miles we crossed a sand ridge, and then returned to our
north-west by north course. We found the ground not nearly as bad
for travelling on as that between Bulloo and Cooper's Creek. In
fact I do not know whether it arose from our exaggerated
anticipation of horrors or not, but we thought it far from bad
travelling ground, and as to pasture it is only the actually stony
ground that is bare, and many a sheep run is in fact worse grazing
ground than that. At fifteen miles we crossed another sand ridge,
for several miles round which there is plenty of grass and fine
salt bush. After crossing this ridge we descended to an earthy
plain, where the ground was rather heavy, being in some places like
pieces of slaked lime, and intersected by small watercourses;
flocks of pigeons rose from amongst the salt bushes and polygonum;
but all the creeks were dry, although marked by lines of box
timber. Several gunyahs of the blacks were situated near a
waterhole that had apparently contained water very lately, and
heaps of grass were lying about the plains, from which they had
beaten the seeds. We pushed on, hoping to find the creeks assuming
an improved appearance, but they did not, and at one o'clock we
halted, intending to travel through part of the night. About
sunset, three flocks of pigeons passed over us, all going in the
same direction, due north by compass, and passing over a ridge of
sand in that direction. Not to have taken notice of such an
occurrence would have been little short of a sin, so we determined
to go eight or ten miles in that direction. Starting at seven
o'clock P.M., we, at six miles, crossed the ridge over which the
birds had flown, and came on a flat, subject to inundation. The
ground was at first hard and even like the bottom of a claypan, but
at a mile or so, we came on cracked earthy ground, intersected by
numberless small channels running in all directions. At nine miles
we reached the bed of a creek running from east to west: it was
only bordered by polygonum bushes, but as there was no timber
visible on the plains, we thought it safer to halt until daylight,
for fear we should miss the water. At daylight, when we had
saddled, a small quantity of timber could be seen at the point of a
sand ridge about a mile and a half or two miles to the west of us,
and on going there we found a fine creek, with a splendid sheet of
water more than a mile long, and averaging nearly three chains
broad: it is, however, only two or three feet deep in most
parts.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 24th December,</i> 1860.&mdash;We took a day of rest
on Gray's Creek to celebrate Christmas. This was doubly pleasant,
as we had never, in our most sanguine moments, anticipated finding
such a delightful oasis in the desert. Our camp was really an
agreeable place, for we had all the advantages of food and water,
attending a position of a large creek or river, and were at the
same time free from the annoyance of the numberless ants, flies,
and mosquitoes that are invariably met with amongst timber or heavy
scrub.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 25th December</i>, 1860.&mdash;We left Gray's Creek
at half-past four A.M. and proceeded to cross the earthy rotten
plains in the direction of Eyre's Creek. At a distance of about
nine miles we reached some lines of trees and bushes which were
visible from the top of the sand ridge at Gray's Creek. We found
them growing on the banks of several small creeks which trend to
the north and north-north-west; at a mile and a half further we
crossed a small creek north-north-east, and joining the ones above
mentioned. This creek contained abundance of water in small
detached holes from fifty to a hundred links long, well shaded by
steep banks and overhanging bushes. The water had a suspiciously
transparent colour and a slight trace of brackishness, but the
latter was scarcely perceptible. Near where the creek joined the
holes is a sandhill and a dense mass of fine timber. The smoke of a
fire indicated the presence of blacks, who soon made their
appearance and followed us for some distance, beckoning us away to
the north-east. We however continued our course north-west by
north, but at a distance of one mile and a half found that the
creek did not come round as we expected, and that the fall of the
water was in a direction nearly opposite to our course, or about
west to east. We struck off north half west for a high sand ridge,
from which we anticipated seeing whether it were worth while for us
to follow the course of the creeks we had crossed. We were
surprised to find all the watercourses on the plains trending
rather to the south of east, and at a distance of three miles,
after changing our course, and when we approached the sandhills
towards which we had been steering, we were agreeably pulled up by
a magnificent creek coming from the north-north-west, and running
in the direction of the fire we had seen. We had now no choice but
to change our course again, for we could not have crossed even if
we had desired to do so. On following up the south bank of the
creek we found it soon keeping a more northerly course than it had
where we first struck it. This fact, together with its magnitude
and general appearance, lessened the probability of its being
Eyre's Creek, as seemed at first very likely from their relative
positions and directions. The day being very hot and the camels
tired from travelling over the earthy plains, which by-the-by are
not nearly so bad as those at the head of Cooper's Creek, we camped
at one P.M., having traced the creek up about five miles, not
counting the bends. For the whole of this distance we found not a
break or interruption of water, which appears to be very deep; the
banks are from twenty to thirty feet above the water, and very
steep; they are clothed near the water's edge with mint and other
weeds, and on the top of each side there is a belt of box trees and
various shrubs. The lower part of the creek is bounded towards the
north by a high red sand ridge, and on the south side is an
extensive plain, intersected by numerous watercourses, which drain
off the water in flood-time. The greater portion of the plain is at
present very bare, but the stalks of dry grass show that after rain
or floods there will be a good crop on the harder and well drained
portion; but I believe the loose earthy portion supports no
vegetation at any time. The inclination of the ground from the edge
of the creek-bank towards the plain is in many places very
considerable; this I should take to indicate that the flooding is
or has been at one time both frequent and regular.</p>

<p>Wednesday, 26th December, 1860.&mdash;We started at five A.M.,
following up the creek from point to point of the bends. Its
general course was at first north-by-west, but at about six miles,
the sand ridge on the west closed in on it, and at this point it
takes a turn to the north-north-east for half a mile, and then
comes around suddenly north-west. Up to this point it had been
rather improving in appearance than otherwise, but in the bend to
the north-west, the channel is very broad. Its bed being limestone
rock and indurated clay, is for a space of five or six chains quite
dry; then commences another waterhole, the creek keeping a little
more towards north. We crossed the creek here and struck across the
plain in a due northerly course, for we could see the line of
timber coming up to the sand ridges in that direction. For from
seven to eight miles we did not touch the creek, and the eastern
sand ridge seceded to a distance, in some places of nearly three
miles, from our line, leaving an immense extent of grassy plain
between it and the creek. The distinctly marked feature on the
lower part of this creek is that whenever the main creek is on one
side of a plain, there is always a fine billibong on the opposite
side, each of them almost invariably sticking close to the
respective sand ridges. Before coming to the next bend of the creek
a view from the top of a sandhill showed me that the creek received
a large tributary from the north-west at about two miles above
where we had crossed it. A fine line of timber, running up to the
north-west, joined an extensive tract of box forest, and the branch
we were following was lost to view in a similar forest towards the
north. The sand ridge was so abrupt when we came to the creek, that
it was necessary to descend into its bed through one of the small
ravines adjoining it. We found it partially run out, the bed being
sand and strewed with nodules of lime, some of which were from one
half to two feet long: they had apparently been formed in the
sand-downs by infiltration.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 30th December,</i> 1860.&mdash;Finding that the creek
was trending considerably towards the east without much likelihood
of altering its course, we struck off from it, taking a ten days'
supply of water, as there were ranges visible to the north, which
had the appearance of being stony. A northeast by northerly course
was first taken for about seven miles in order to avoid them. The
whole of this distance was over alluvial earthy plains, the soil of
which was firm, but the vegetation scanty.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 5th January,</i> 1861.&mdash;On leaving Camp 84, we
found slight but distinct indications of rain in the groves, and a
few blades of grass and small weeds in the little depressions on
the plain: these indications were, however, so slight, that, but
for the fact of our having found surface-water in two holes near
our camp, we should hardly have noticed them. At a distance of
about two miles in a north-north-easterly direction, we came to a
creek with a long broad shallow waterhole. The well-worn paths, the
recent tracks of natives, and the heaps of shells, on the contents
of which the latter had feasted, showed at once that this creek
must be connected with some creek of considerable importance. The
camels and horses being greatly in need of rest, we only moved up
about half a mile, and camped for the day.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 6th January,</i> 1861.&mdash;Started at twenty
minutes to six o'clock, intending to make an easy day's stage along
the creek. As we proceeded up in a northerly direction, we found
the waterhole to diminish in size very much, and at about two and a
half miles the creek ran out in a lot of small watercourses. At the
upper end of the creek we found in its bed what appeared to be an
arrangement for catching fish: it consisted of a small oval mud
paddock about twelve feet by eight feet, the sides of which were
about nine inches above the bottom of the hole, and the top of the
fence covered with long grass, so arranged that the ends of the
blades overhung scantily by several inches the sides of the hole.
As there was no sign of timber to the north, we struck off to
north-west by north for a fine line that came up from south-west,
and seemed to run parallel with the creek we were about to leave.
At a distance of about three miles, we reached the bank of a fine
creek containing a sheet of water two chains broad, and at least
fifteen feet deep in the middle. The banks are shelving, sandy, and
lightly clothed with box trees and various shrubs. On starting to
cross the plains towards this creek we were surprised at the bright
green appearance of strips of land, which look in the distance like
swamps. On approaching some of them, we found that there had been a
considerable fall of rain in some places, which had raised a fine
crop of grass and portulac* wherever the soil was of a sandy and
light nature; but the amount of moisture had been insufficient to
affect the hard clayey ground which constitutes the main portion of
the plain. The sight of two native companions feeding here, added
greatly to the encouraging prospects; they are the only specimens
of that bird that I remember to have seen on that side of the
Darling.</p>

<p class="foot">[* Portulaca oleracea. L.]</p>

<p><i>7th January,</i> 1861.&mdash;We started at half-past four
A.M. without water, thinking that we might safely rely on this
creek for one day's journey. We, however, found the line of timber
soon begin to look small; at three miles the channel contained only
a few pools of surface water. We continued across the plains on a
due northerly course, frequently crossing small watercourses, which
had been filled by the rain, but were fast drying up. Here and
there, as we proceeded, dense lines of timber on our right showed
that the creek came from the east of north; at a distance of
thirteen miles we turned to the north-north-east towards a fine
line of timber. We found a creek of considerable dimensions, that
had only two or three small water-holes, but as there was more than
sufficient for us, and very little feed for the beasts anywhere
else, we camped. I should have liked this camp to have been in a
more prominent and easily recognizable position, as it happens to
be almost exactly on the tropic of Capricorn. The tremendous gale
of wind that we had in the evening and night prevented me from
taking a latitude observation, whereas I had some good ones at the
last camp and at Camp 87. My reckoning cannot be far out. I found,
on taking out my instruments, that one of the spare thermometers
was broken, and the glass of my aneroid barometer cracked; the
latter I believe not otherwise injured. This was done by the camel
having taken it into his head to roll while the pack was on his
back.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 8th January</i>, 1861.&mdash;Started at a quarter
past five A.M. with a load of water, determined to be independent
of all creeks and watercourses. At a mile and a half, found surface
water in a small creek, and at a mile farther, water in two or
three places on the open plains. The country we crossed for the
first ten miles consists of fine open plains of firm argillaceous
soils, too stiff and hard to be affected by the small quantity of
rain that has fallen as yet. They are subject to inundations from
the overflow of a number of small creeks, which intersect them in a
direction east-north-east to west-south-west. Nearly all the creeks
are lined with box trees and shrubs in a tolerably healthy state;
of the remains of dead trees there is only a fair proportion to the
living ones. After traversing a plain of greater extent than the
rest, we, at ten miles, reached the creek, proportionately large
and important looking. The channel, however, at the point where we
struck it, was deep, level, and dry; but I believe there is water
in it not far off, for there were some red-breasted cockatoos in
the trees, and native parrots on each side. On the north side there
is a part bearing off to the north-north-west. The mirage on the
plain to the south of the creek was stronger than I have before
seen it. There appear to be sheets of water within a few yards of
one, and it looks sufficiently smooth and glassy to be used for an
artificial horizon. To the westward of the plains, some fine
sandhills were visible, nearly in the direction in which the creek
flowed. To the north of the creek the country undergoes a great
change. At first there is a little earthy land subject to
inundation. The soil then becomes more sandy, with stony pans in
which water collects after rain; the whole country is slightly
undulating, lightly timbered, and splendidly grassed. A number of
small disconnected creeks are scattered about, many of which
contained water protected from the sun and wind by luxuriant growth
of fine grasses and small bushes. We passed one or two little rises
of sand and pebbles, on which were growing some trees quite new to
me; but for the seed pods I should have taken them for a species of
Casuarina, although the leaf-stalks have not the jointed
peculiarities of those plants. The trunks and branches are like the
she oak, the leaves like those of a pine; they droop like a willow,
and the seed is small, flat, in a large flat pod, about six inches
by three-quarters of an inch. As we proceeded, the country improved
at every step. Flocks of pigeons rose and flew off to the eastward,
and fresh plants met our view on every rise; everything green and
luxuriant. The horse licked his lips, and tried all he could to
break his nose-string in order to get at the food. We camped at the
foot of a sandy rise, where there was a large stony pan with plenty
of water, and where the feed was equal in quality, and superior as
to variety, to any that I have seen in Australia, excepting perhaps
on some soils of volcanic origin.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 9th January</i>, 1861.&mdash;Started at five
minutes past five, without water, trusting to get a supply of water
from the rain that fell during the thunderstorm. Traversed six
miles of undulating plains covered with vegetation richer than
ever. Several ducks rose from the little creeks as we passed, and
flocks of pigeons were flying in all directions. The richness of
the vegetation is evidently not suddenly arising from chance
thunderstorms, for the trees and bushes on the open plain are
everywhere healthy and fresh looking; very few dead ones are to be
seen; besides which, the quantity of dead and rotten grass which at
present almost overpowers in some places the young blades shows
that this is not the first crop of the kind. The grasses are
numerous and many of them unknown to me, but they only constitute a
moderate portion of the herbage. Several kinds of spurious vetches
and portulac, as well as salsolaceae, add to the luxuriance of the
vegetation. At seven miles we found ourselves in an open forest
country, where the feed was good, but not equal to what we had
passed, neither had it been visited by yesterday's rain. We soon
emerged again on open plains, but the soil being of a more clayish
nature, they were not nearly so much advanced in vegetation as the
others. We found surface water in several places, and at one spot
disturbed a fine bustard which was feeding in the long grass; we
did not see him until he flew up. I should have mentioned that one
flew over our camp last evening in a northerly direction; this
speaks well for the country and climate. At noon we came to a large
creek the course of which was from east-north-east to
west-south-west; the sight of the white gum trees in the distance
had raised hopes, which were not at all damped on a close
inspection of the channel. At the point where we struck it there
was certainly no great quantity of water; the bed was broad and
sandy, but its whole appearance was that of an important
watercourse, and the large gums which line its banks, together with
the improved appearance of the soil, and the abundance of feed in
the vicinity, satisfied us as to the permanency of the water and
the value of the discovery. Although it was so early in the day,
and we were anxious to make a good march, yet we camped here, as it
seemed to be almost a sin to leave such good quarters. The bed of
the creek is loose sand, through which the water freely permeates;
it is, however, sufficiently coarse not to be boggy, and animals
can approach the water without any difficulty.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 10th January</i>, 1861.&mdash;At twenty minutes
past five A.M., we left our camp with a full supply of water,
determined to risk no reverses, and to make a good march. I should
mention that last evening we had been nearly deafened by the noise
of the cicadariae, and but for our large fires should have been
kept awake all night by the mosquitoes. A walk of two miles across
a well grassed plain brought us to a belt of timber, and we soon
afterwards found ourselves pulled up by a large creek in which the
water was broad and deep; we had to follow up the bank of the creek
in a north-easterly direction for nearly a mile before we could
cross, when to our joy we found that it was flowing; not a muddy
stream from the effects of recent floods, but a small rivulet of
pure water as clear as crystal. The bed of the river at this place
is deep and rather narrow; the water flows over sand and pebbles,
winding its way between clumps of melalema, and gum saplings. After
leaving the river, we kept our old course due north, crossing, at a
distance of one mile, three creeks with gum trees on their banks.
The soil of the flats through which they flow is a red loam of fair
quality and well grassed. Beyond the third creek is a large plain,
parts of which are very stony, and this is bounded towards the east
by a low stony rise, partly composed of decayed and honeycombed
quartz rock in situ, and partly of waterworn pebbles and other
alluvial deposits. At about two miles across this plain, we reached
the first of a series of small creeks with deep waterholes: these
creeks and holes have the characteristics peculiar to watercourses
which are found in flats formed from the alluvial deposits of
schistose rocks. The banks are on a level with the surrounding
ground, and are irregularly marked by small trees, or only by tufts
of long grass which overhang the channel and frequently bide it
from one's view, even when within a few yards. At about five miles
from where we crossed the river, we came to the main creek in these
flats, Patten's Creek; it flows along at the foot of a stony range,
and we had to trace it up nearly a mile in a north-north-easterly
direction before we could cross it; as it happened, we might almost
as well have followed its course up the flat, for at a little more
than two miles we came to it again. We re-crossed it at a stony
place just below a very large waterhole, and then continued our
course over extensive plains, not so well grassed as those we had
passed before, and very stony in some places. At eight miles from
Patten's Creek, we came to another, running from south-west to
south-east there was plenty of water in it, but it was evidently
the result of recent local rains. On the banks was an abundance of
good feed but very little timber.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 11th January</i>, 1861.&mdash;We started at five
A.M., and in the excitement of exploring fine well-watered country,
forgot all about the eclipse of the sun until the reduced
temperature and peculiarly gloomy appearance of the sky drew our
attention to the matter; it was then too late to remedy the
deficiency, so we made a good day's journey, the moderation of the
midday heat, which was only about 86 degrees, greatly assisting us.
The country traversed has the most verdant and cheerful aspect;
abundance of feed and water everywhere. All the creeks seen to-day
have a course more or less to the east by south. The land improves
in appearance at every mile. A quantity of rain has fallen here and
to the south, and some of the flats are suitable for cultivation,
if the regularity of the seasons will admit.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 12th January</i>, 1861.&mdash;We started at five
A.M., and, keeping as nearly as possible a due northerly course,
traversed for about eight miles a splendid flat, through which flow
several fine well-watered creeks, lined with white gum trees. We
then entered a series of slaty, low, sandstone ranges, amongst
which were some well-grassed flats, and plenty of water in the main
gullies. The more stony portions are, however, covered with
porcupine grass, and here and there with mallee; large ant-hills
are very numerous; they vary in height from two and a half to four
feet. There was a continuous rise perceptible all the way in
crossing the ranges, and from the highest portion, which we reached
at a distance of about seven miles, we had a pretty good view of
the country towards the north. As far as we could see in the
distance, and bearing due north, was a large range, having somewhat
the outline of a granite mountain. The east end of this range just
comes up to the magnetic north; on the left of this, and bearing
north-north-west, is a single conical peak, the top of which only
is visible. Further to the west there were some broken ranges,
apparently sandstone; to the east of north the tops of very distant
and apparently higher ranges were seen, the outline of which was so
indistinct that I can form no idea as to their character; the
intermediate country below us appeared alternations of fine valleys
and stony ranges, such as we had just been crossing. From here a
descent of two miles brought us to a creek having a northern
course, but on tracing it down for about a mile, we found it to
turn to the southeast and join another from the north. We crossed
over to the latter on a north-by-westerly course, and camped on the
west bank. It has a broad sandy channel; the waterholes are large,
but not deep; the banks are bordered with fine white gums, and are
in some places very scrubby. There is abundance of rich green feed
everywhere in the vicinity. We found here numerous indications of
blacks having been here, but saw nothing of them. It seems
remarkable that where their tracks are so plentiful, we should have
seen none since we left King's Creek. I observed that the natives
here climb trees as those on the Murray do, in search of some
animal corresponding in habits to the opossum, which they get out
of the hollow branches in a similar manner. I have not yet been
able to ascertain what the animal is.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 13th January</i>, 1861.&mdash;We did not leave camp
this morning until half-past seven, having delayed for the purpose
of getting the camels' shoes on&mdash;a matter in which we were
eminently unsuccessful. We took our breakfast before starting, for
almost the first time since leaving the depot. Having crossed the
creek, our course was due north as before, until, at about six
miles, we came in sight of the range ahead, when we took a
north-half-easterly direction for the purpose of clearing the
eastern front of it. We found the ground more sandy than what we
had before crossed, and a great deal of it even more richly
grassed. Camp 93 is situate at the junction of three sandy creeks,
in which there is abundance of water. The sand is loose, and the
water permeates freely, so that the latter may be obtained
delightfully cool and clear by sinking anywhere in the beds of the
creeks.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 19th January,</i> 1861.&mdash;Started from Camp 98
at 530 A.M., and passing to the north-west of Mount Forbes, across
a fine and well-grassed plain, kept at first a north-by-easterly
direction. At a distance of three miles, the plain became
everywhere stony, being scattered over with quartz pebbles; and a
little further on we came to low quartz ranges, the higher portions
of which are covered with porcupine grass, but the valleys are well
clothed with a variety of coarse and rank herbage. At about five
miles we crossed a creek with a sandy bed, which has been named
Green's Creek; there were blacks not far above where we crossed,
but we did not disturb them. After crossing the creek, we took a
due northerly course over very rugged quartz ranges of an
auriferous character. Pieces of iron ore, very rich, were scattered
in great numbers over some of the hills. On our being about to
cross one of the branch creeks in the low range, we surprised some
blacks&mdash;a man who, with a young fellow apparently his son, was
upon a tree, cutting out something; and a lubra with a piccaninny.
The two former did not see me until I was nearly close to them, and
then they were dreadfully frightened; jumping down from the trees,
they started off, shouting what sounded to us very like 'Joe, Joe.'
Thus disturbed, the lubra, who was at some distance from them, just
then caught sight of the camels and the remainder of the party as
they came over the hill into the creek, and this tended to hasten
their flight over the stones and porcupine grass. Crossing the
range at the head of this creek, we came on a gully running north,
down which we proceeded, and soon found it open out into a creek,
at two or three points in which we found water. On this creek we
found the first specimen of an eucalyptus, which has a very
different appearance from the members of the gum-tree race. It
grows as high as a good-sized gum tree, but with the branches less
spreading: in shape it much resembles the elm; the foliage is dark,
like that of the light wood; the trunk and branches are covered
with a grey bark resembling in outward appearance that of the box
tree. Finding that the creek was trending too much to the eastward,
we struck off to the north again, and at a short distance came on a
fine creek running about south-south-east. As it was now nearly
time to camp, we travelled it up for about one and a-half mile, and
came to a fine waterhole in a rocky basin, at which there were lots
of birds.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 27th January,</i> 1861.&mdash;Started from Camp 105
at five minutes past two in the morning. We followed along the
bends of the creek by moonlight, and found the creek wind about
very much, taking on the whole a north-easterly course. At about
five miles it changed somewhat its features; from a broad and sandy
channel, winding about through gum-tree flats, it assumes the
unpropitious appearance of a straight, narrow creek, running in a
north-north-easterly direction between high, perpendicular, earthy
banks. After running between three or four miles in this manner, it
took a turn to the west, at which point there is a fine waterhole,
and then assumed its original character. Below this we found water
at several places, but it all seemed to be either from surface
drainage or from springs in the sand. The land in the vicinity of
the creek appears to have received plenty of rain, the vegetation
everywhere green and fresh; but there is no appearance of the creek
having flowed in this part of the channel for a considerable
period. Palm trees are numerous, and some bear an abundance of
small, round dates (nuts) just ripening. These palms give a most
picturesque and pleasant appearance to the creek.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 30th January,</i> 1861.&mdash;Started at half-past
seven A.M., after several unsuccessful attempts at getting Golah
out of the bed of the creek. It was determined to try bringing him
down until we could find a place for him to get out at; but after
going in this way two or three miles it was found necessary to
leave him behind, as it was almost impossible to get him through
some of the waterholes, and had separated King from the party,
which became a matter for very serious consideration when we found
blacks hiding in the box trees close to us.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, February,</i> 1861.&mdash;Finding the ground in such
a state from the heavy falls of rain, that camels could scarcely be
got along, it was decided to leave them at Camp 119, and for Mr.
Burke and I to proceed towards the sea on foot. After breakfast we
accordingly started, taking with us the horse and three days'
provisions. Our first difficulty was in crossing Billy's Creek,
which we had to do where it enters the river, a few hundred yards
below the camp. In getting the horse in here, he got bogged in a
quicksand bank so deeply as to be unable to stir, and we only
succeeded in extricating him by undermining him on the creek's
side, and then lugging him into the water. Having got all the
things in safety, we continued down the river bank, which bent
about from east to west, but kept a general northerly course. A
great deal of the land was so soft and rotten that the horse, with
only a saddle and about twenty-five pounds on his back, could
scarcely walk over it. At a distance of about five miles we again
had him bogged in crossing a small creek, after which he seemed so
weak that we had great doubts about getting him on. We, however,
found some better ground close to the water's edge, where the
sandstone rock crops out, and we stuck to it as far as possible.
Finding that the river was bending about so much that we were
making very little progress in a northerly direction, we struck off
due north and soon came on some table-land, where the soil is
shallow and gravelly, and clothed with box and swamp gums. Patches
of the land were very boggy, but the main portion was sound enough;
beyond this we came on an open plain, covered with water up to
one's ankles. The soil here was a stiff clay, and the surface very
uneven, so that between the tufts of grass one was frequently knee
deep in water. The bottom, however, was sound and no fear of
bogging. After floundering through this for several miles, we came
to a path formed by the blacks, and there were distinct signs of a
recent migration in a southerly direction. By making use of this
path we got on much better, for the ground was well trodden and
bard. At rather more than a mile, the path entered a forest through
which flowed a nice watercourse, and we had not gone far before we
found places where the blacks had been camping. The forest was
intersected by little pebbly rises, on which they had made their
fires, and in the sandy ground adjoining some of the former had
been digging yams, which seemed to be so numerous that they could
afford to leave lots of them about, probably having only selected
the very best. We were not so particular, but ate many of those
that they had rejected, and found them very good. About half a mile
further, we came close on a black fellow, who was coiling up by a
camp fire, whilst his gin and piccaninny were yabbering alongside.
We stopped for a short time to take out some of the pistols that
were on the horse, and that they might see us before we were so
near as to frighten them. Just after we stopped, the black got up
to stretch his limbs, and after a few seconds looked in our
direction. It was very amusing to see the way in which he stared,
standing for some time as if he thought he must be dreaming, and
then, having signalled to the others, they dropped on their
haunches, and shuffled off in the quietest manner possible. Near
their fire was a fine hut, the best I have ever seen, built on the
same principle as those at Cooper's Creek, but much larger and more
complete I should say a dozen blacks might comfortably coil in it
together. It is situated at the end of the forest towards the
north, and looks out on an extensive marsh, which is at times
flooded by the sea water. Hundreds of wild geese, plover and
pelicans, were enjoying themselves in the watercourses on the
marsh, all the water on which was too brackish to be drinkable,
except some holes that are filled by the stream that flows through
the forest. The neighbourhood of this encampment is one of the
prettiest we have seen during the journey. Proceeding on our course
across the marsh, we came to a channel through which the sea water
enters. Here we passed three blacks, who, as is universally their
custom, pointed out to us, unasked, the best part down. This
assisted us greatly, for the ground we were taking was very boggy.
We moved slowly down about three miles and then camped for the
night; the horse Billy being completely baked. Next morning we
started at daybreak, leaving the horse short hobbled.</p>

CENTRE OF AUSTRALIA</h3>

<blockquote>[THE following narrative of John McDouall Stuart's
journey to the centre of Australia is taken from his journals,
edited by William Hardman, and published at London, 1864. The
statement in the text, that the explorer named the hill near to the
exact centre of the continent "Central Mount Stuart", after
himself, is printed as it appears in Hardman's edition. But the
original manuscript, in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, shows that
what Stuart wrote was that he named the hill "Central Mount Sturt,
after my excellent and esteemed commander of the expedition in 1844
and 1845, Captain Sturt." He placed a paper in a bottle on the top
of a cone erected on the hill. That paper is now in the museum at
Adelaide, and it shows that "Central Mount Sturt" was the name
originally given. But Stuart was alive when Hardman published his
journals, and apparently approved of the alteration, which was made
on the suggestion of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry
Anthony MacDonnell.]<br></blockquote>

<p><i>Journal of Mr. Stuart's Fourth Expedition&mdash;Fixing the
Centre of the Continent, from March to September, 1860.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Friday, 2nd March, 1860, Chambers Creek.</i>&mdash;Left the
creek for the northwest, with thirteen horses and two men. The grey
horse being too weak to travel was left behind. Camped at Hamilton
Springs.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 3rd March, Mount Hamilton.</i>&mdash;Camped at the
Beresford Springs, where it was evident that the natives, whose
camp is a little way from this, had had a fight. There were the
remains of a body of a very tall native lying on his back. The
skull was broken in three or four places, the flesh nearly all
devoured by the crows and native dogs, and both feet and hands were
gone. There were three worleys on the rising ground, with waddies,
boomerangs, spears, and a number of broken dishes scattered round
them. The natives seemed to have run away and left them, or to have
been driven away by a hostile tribe. Between two of the worleys we
observed a handful of hair, apparently torn from the skull of the
dead man, and a handful of emu feathers placed close together, the
feathers to the north-west, the hair to the south-east. They were
between two pieces of charred wood, which had been extinguished
before the feathers and hair were placed there.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 22nd April, Small Gum Creek under Mount Stuart,
Centre of Australia.</i>&mdash;To-day I find from my observations
of the sun, 111&deg; 00' 30", that I am now camped in the centre of
Australia. I have marked a tree and planted the British flag there.
There is a high mount about two miles and a half to the
north-north-east. I wish it had been in the centre; but on it
to-morrow I will raise a cone of stones, and plant the flag there,
and name it "Central Mount Stuart". We have been in search of
permanent water today, but cannot find any. I hope from the top of
Central Mount Stuart to find something good to the north-west.
Examined a large creek; can find no surface water, but got some by
scratching in the sand. It is a large creek divided into many
channels, but they are all filled with sand; splendid grass all
round this camp.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 23rd April, Centre.</i>&mdash;Took Kekwick and the
flag, and went to the top of the mount, but found it to be much
higher and more difficult of ascent than I anticipated. After a
deal of labour, slips, and knocks, we at last arrived on the top.
The view to the north is over a large plain of gums, mulga, and
spinifex, with watercourses running through it. The large gum creek
that we crossed winds round this hill in a north-east direction; at
about ten miles it is joined by another. After joining they take a
course more north, and I lost sight of them in the far-distant
plain. To the north-north-east is the termination of the hills; to
the northeast, east and south-east are broken ranges, and to the
north-north-west the ranges of the west side of the plain
terminate. To the north-west are broken ranges; and to the west is
a very high peak, between which and this place to the south-west
are a number of isolated hills. Built a large cone of stones, in
the centre of which I placed a pole with the British flag nailed to
it. Near the top of the cone I placed a small bottle, in which
there is a slip of paper, with our signatures to it, stating by
whom it was raised. We then gave three hearty cheers for the flag,
the emblem of civil and religious liberty, and may it be a sign to
the natives that the dawn of liberty, civilization, and
Christianity is about to break upon them. We can see no water from
the top. Descended, but did not reach the camp till after dark.
This water still continues, which makes me think there must
certainly be more higher up. I have named the range "John Range",
after my friend and well-wisher, John Chambers, Esq., brother to
James Chambers, Esq., one of the promoters of this expedition.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 24th April, Central Mount Stuart.</i>&mdash;Sent
Kekwick in search of water, and to examine a hill that has the
appearance of having a cone of stones upon it; meanwhile I made up
my plan, and Ben mended the saddle-bags, which were in a sad mess
from coming through the scrub. Kekwick returned in the afternoon,
having found water higher up the creek. He has also found a new
rose of a beautiful description, having thorns on its branches, and
a seed-vessel resembling a gherkin. It has a sweet, strong perfume;
the leaves are white, but as the flower is withered, I am unable to
describe it. The native orange-tree abounds here. Mount Stuart is
composed of hard red sandstone, covered with spinifex, and a little
scrub on the top. The white ant abounds in the scrubs, and we even
found some of their habitations near the top of Mount Stuart.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 25th April, Central Mount Stuart.</i>&mdash;There
is a remarkable hill about two miles to the west, having another
small hill at the north end in the shape of a bottle; this I have
named "Mount Esther", at the request of the maker of the flag.
Started at 9 o'clock, on a course a little north of west, to the
high peak that I saw from the top of Mount Stuart, which bears
272&deg;. My reason for going west is that I do not like the
appearance of the country to the north for finding water, it seems
to be sandy. From the peak I expect to find another stratum to take
me up to the north-north-west. Around the mount and on the west
side, the country is well grassed, and red sandy soil; no stones.
To the north and south of our line are several isolated hills,
composed principally of granite. At ten miles there is a quartz
reef on the north side of the south hills.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 27th June, Hayward Creek.</i>&mdash;This morning
we see signal fires all around us. It was my intention last night
to have gone this morning to Kekwick Ponds to water the horses,
then to give them the day to rest and proceed to-morrow back again
to the large creek, and go on to the distant hills that I was
steering for on the 25th inst., but, after considering the matter
over the whole night, I have most reluctantly come to the
determination to abandon the attempt to make the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Situated as I now am, it would be most imprudent. In
the first place my party is far too small to cope with such wily,
determined natives as those we have just encountered. If they had
been Europeans they could not better have arranged and carried out
their plan of attack. They had evidently observed us passing in the
morning, had examined our tracks to see which way we had gone, and
knew we could get no water down the creek, but must retrace our
steps to obtain it above them; they therefore lay in wait for our
return. Their charge was in double column, open order, and we had
to take steady aim to make an impression. With such as these for
enemies in our rear, and, most probably, far worse in advance, it
would be destruction to all my party for me to attempt to go on.
All the information of the interior that I have already obtained
would be lost. Moreover, we have only half rations for six months,
four of which are gone, and I have been economizing as much as I
possibly could in case of our having to be out a longer time, so
that my men now complain of great weakness, and are unable to
perform what they have to do. Again, only two showers of rain have
fallen since March, and I am afraid of the waters drying up to the
south, and there is no appearance of rain at present. The days are
now become very hot again, and the feed for the horses as dry as if
it were the middle of summer. The poor animals are very much
reduced in condition, so much so that I am afraid of their being
longer than one night without water. Finally, my health is so bad
that I am hardly able to sit in the saddle. After taking all those
things into consideration, I think it would be madness and folly to
attempt more. If my own life were the only sacrifice, I would
willingly risk it to accomplish my purpose; but it seems that I am
destined to be disappointed; man proposes, but the Almighty
disposes, and his will must be obeyed. Seeing the signal fires
around, and dreading lest our black friends at Kekwick Ponds might
have been playing a double part with us in spite of their Masonic
signs, I gave them a wide berth, and steered for Bishop Creek.
Arrived there in the afternoon, and found that the creek had not
been visited by natives since we left. These natives do not deposit
their dead bodies in the ground, but place them in the trees, and,
judging from the number of these corpses which we have passed
between this and the large creek. where they made their attack upon
us, they must be very numerous. These natives have quite a
different cast of features from those in the south; they have
neither the broad flat nose and large mouth, nor the projecting
eyebrows, but have more of the Malay; they are tall, muscular,
well-made men, and I think they must have seen or encountered white
men before.</p>

<b>STUART'S ROUTE ACROSS AUSTRALIA, 1862</b>
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>XVIII. STUART'S JOURNEY ACROSS
THE CONTINENT</h3>

<p><i>Friday,18th July, 1862,Priscilla Creek.</i>&mdash;Started at
8.15, course north-west. Passed over grassy plains and stony rise;
when at three miles, seeing the termination of a range in a bluff
point, changed my course to 310&deg;. Proceeded, still crossing
stony hills, consisting of ironstone, slate, and a hard white rock,
which is broken into rectangular fragments; also over broad
valleys, which are covered with grass that when green must have
stood very high, but is now so dry that it breaks off before the
horses. My horse being first, collects so much on his front legs
that I have been obliged to stop, pull him back, and allow it to
fall, so that he may step over it, go on, get another load, and do
the same. At six miles and a half, after crossing a plain, crossed
a deep bamboo creek; this I have named "Ellen Creek". Proceeded
over two other stony rises and valleys of the same description, and
came upon extensive plains, well grassed, and of beautiful alluvial
soil; crossing them towards the bluff point at fifteen miles, came
upon the Adelaide between me and the bluff, which is about a mile
further on; the river is about eighty yards wide, and so still that
I could not see which way the current was. I suppose its being high
tide was the cause of this. The banks are thickly lined with
bamboo, very tall and stout, very steep, and twelve feet down to
the water's edge; the water appeared to be of great depth, and
entirely free from snags or fallen timber. The range on the
opposite side of the river, for which I was directing my course,
being the highest I have seen in this new country, I have named it
after His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief of South Australia,
"Daly Range," and its highest peak to the north "Mount Daly".
Before reaching the river, at thirteen miles, we passed a high
conspicuous tent hill, at right angle, north-east to our line; this
I have named "Mount Goyder", after the Surveyor-General of South
Australia. Followed the river on a north course for about a mile,
when I was stopped by a deep side creek of thick bamboo, with
water; turned to the east, rounded the bamboo, but found myself in
a boggy marsh, which I could not cross. This marsh is covered with
fine grass, in black alluvial soil, in which is growing a new kind
of lily, with a large broad heart-shaped leaf a foot or more
across; the blossoms are six inches high, resemble a tulip in
shape, and are of a deep brilliant rose colour; the seeds are
contained in a vessel resembling the rose of a watering-pot, with
the end of each egg-shaped seed showing from the holes, and the
colour of this is a bright yellow. The marsh is studded with a
great number of melaleuca trees, tall and straight. As I could not
cross, I had to round it, which took me a little more than an hour;
when I got upon some low undulating rises, not far from Mount
Goyder, composed of conglomerate ironstone and ironstone gravel,
which seem to produce the springs which supply the marsh. Camped on
the side of the marsh, to give the horses the benefit of the green
grass, for some of them are still troubled with worms, and are very
poor and miserable, and I have no medicine to give them, and there
is not a blade of grass on the banks of the river&mdash;all has
been burnt within the last four days. Native smoke in every
direction.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 19th July, Lily Marsh, Adelaide
River.</i>&mdash;Started at 9.10, course 20&deg; east of north. At
three miles crossed some stony rises and broad alluvial grassy
valleys; at four miles met the river, had to go half a mile to the
south-east to round it. Again changed to my first course; at seven
miles and a half crossed a creek with water. The country to this is
good, with occasionally a little ironstone and gravel, timber of
stringy-bark, and a little low gum scrub. Having crossed this
creek, we ascended a sandy table-land with an open forest of
stringy-bark (good timber), palms, gums, other trees and bushes; it
has been lately burnt, but the roots of the grass abound. This
continued for about three miles. There is a small stony range of
hills to the west, which at the end of the three miles dropped into
a grassy plain of a beautiful black alluvial soil, covered with
lines and groves of the cabbage palm trees, which give it a very
picturesque appearance; its dip is towards the river; in two miles
crossed it, and again ascended low table-land of the very same
description as the other. At fourteen miles struck another creek
with water, and camped. The country gone over to-day, though not
all of the very best description, has plains in it of the very
finest kind&mdash;even the sandy table-land bears an abundant crop
of grass. The trees are so thick that I can get no view of the
surrounding country; the tall beautiful palm grows in this creek.
Native smoke about, but we have not seen any natives. There are
large masses of volcanic rock on the sides of this creek. At about
a mile to the eastward is a large body of springs that supply water
to this creek, which I have named "Anna Creek". Camped at ten
minutes to three o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 20th July, Anna Creek.</i>&mdash;The mosquitoes at
this camp have been most annoying; scarcely one of us has been able
to close his eyes in sleep during the whole night: I never found
them so bad anywhere&mdash;night and day they are at us. The grass
In, and on the banks of, this creek is six feet high; to the
westward there are long reaches of water, and the creek very
thickly timbered with melaleuca, gum, stringy-bark, and palms.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 21st July, Anna Creek and Springs.</i>&mdash;Again
passed a miserable night with the mosquitoes. Started at eight
o'clock; course, north-north-west. At three miles came upon another
extensive fresh-water marsh, too boggy to cross. There is rising
ground to the north-west and north; the river seems to run between.
I can see clumps of bamboos and trees, by which I suppose it runs
at about a mile to the north-north-west. The ground for the last
three miles is of a sandy nature, and light-brown colour, with
ironstone gravel on the surface, volcanic rock occasionally
cropping out. The borders of the marsh are of the richest
description of black alluvial soil, and when the grass has sprung
after it has been burnt, it has the appearance of a rich and very
thick crop of green wheat. I am now compelled to alter my course to
30&deg; south of east, to get across a water creek coming into the
marsh, running deep, broad and boggy, and so thick with trees,
bushes, and strong vines interwoven throughout it, that it would
take a day to cut a passage through. At three miles we crossed the
stream, and proceeded again on the north-north-west course, but at
a mile and a half were stopped by another creek of the same
description. Changed to east, and at half a mile was able to cross
it also, and again went on my original bearing. Continued on it for
three miles, when we were again stopped by another running stream,
but this one I was able to cross without going far out of my
course. Proceeded on the north-north-west course, passing over
elevated ground of the same description as the first three miles.
At seventeen miles came upon a thick clump of trees, with beautiful
palms growing amongst them; examined it and found it to have been a
spring, but now dry. Proceeded on another mile, and was again
stopped by what seemed to be a continuation of the large marsh; we
now appeared to have got right into the middle of it. It was to be
seen to the south-west, north-west, and south-east of us. Camped on
a point of rising ground running into it. The timber on the rises
between the creeks is stringy-bark, small gums, and in places a
nasty scrub, very sharp, which tore a number of our saddle-bags: it
is a very good thing the patches of it are not broad. The grass,
where it has not been burned, is very thick and high&mdash;up to my
shoulder when on horseback. About a mile from here, to the west, I
can see what appears to be the water of the river, running through
clumps of trees and bamboos, beyond which, in the distance, are
courses of low rising ground, in places broken also with clumps of
trees; the course of the river seems to be north-north-west. On the
east side of the marsh is also rising ground; the marsh in that
direction seems to run five or six miles before it meets the rising
ground, and appears after that to come round to the north.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 22nd July, Fresh-water Marsh.</i>&mdash;As the marsh
seems to run so much to the east, and not knowing how much further
I shall have to go to get across the numerous creeks that appear to
come into it, I shall remain here to-day and endeavour to find a
road through it to the river, and follow up the banks if I can. I
have a deal of work to do to the plan, and our bags require
mending. After collecting the horses, Thring tried to cross the
marsh to the river, and succeeded in reaching its banks, finding
firm ground all the way; the breadth of the river here being about
a hundred yards, very deep, and running with some velocity, the
water quite fresh. He having returned with this information, I sent
him, King, and Frew, mounted on the strongest horses, to follow the
banks of the river till noon, to see if there is any obstruction to
prevent my travelling by its banks. In two hours they returned with
the sad tidings that the banks were broken down by watercourses,
deep, broad, and boggy; this is a great disappointment, for it will
take me a day or two longer than I expected in reaching the
sea-coast, in consequence of having to go a long way round to clear
the marsh and creeks. The edge of the marsh was still of the same
rich character, and covered with luxuriant grass. The rise we are
camped on is also the same, with ironstone gravel on the surface;
this seems to have been a favourite camping place for a large
number of natives. There is a great quantity of fish bones, mussel,
and turtle shells, at a little distance from the camp, close to
where there was some water. There are three poles fixed in the
ground, forming an equilaterial triangle, on the top of which was a
framework of the same figure, over which were placed bars of wood;
its height from the ground eight feet. This has apparently been
used by them for smoke-drying a dead blackfellow. We have seen no
natives since leaving the Roper, although their smoke is still
about us. On and about the marsh are large flocks of geese, ibis,
and numerous other aquatic birds; they are so wild that they will
not allow us to conic within shot of them. Mr. Kekwick has been
successful in shooting a goose. It has a peculiar-shaped head,
having a large horny lump on the top resembling a topknot, and only
a very small web at the root of his toes. The river opposite this,
about a yard from the bank, is nine feet deep.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 23rd July, Fresh-water Marsh.</i>&mdash;Started at
7.40, course 22&deg; east of south, one mile, to round the marsh;
thence one mile south-east; thence east for six miles, when we
struck a large creek, deep and long reaches, thence three-quarters
of a mile south before we could cross it. This I have named "Thring
Creek", in token of my approbation of his conduct throughout the
journey; thence east, one mile and a half; thence north for nine
miles, when I again struck the large marsh. Thring Creek has been
running nearly parallel with the north course until it empties
itself into the marsh. The country gone over to-day, after leaving
the side of the marsh, as well as the banks of the creek, and also
some small plains, is of the same rich description of soil covered
with grass; the other parts are slightly elevated, the soil light
with a little sand on the surface of a brown colour; timber,
mixture of stringybark and gums, with many others; also, a low
thick scrub, which has lately been burnt in many places, the few
patches that have escaped abounding in grass. I have come twelve
miles to the eastward to try to round the marsh, but have not been
able to do so; the plains that were seen from the river by those
who came up it in boats is the marsh; it is covered with luxuriant
grass, which gives it the appearance of extensive grassy plains. I
have camped at where the Thring spreads itself over a portion of
the marsh. There is rising ground to the north-west, on the
opposite side, which I suppose to be a continuation of the elevated
ground I passed before crossing the creek, and the same that I saw
bearing north from the last camp. I suppose it runs in towards the
river.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 24th July, Thring Creek, Entering the
Marsh.</i>&mdash;Started at 7.40, course north. I have taken this
course in order to make the sea-coast, which I suppose to be
distant about eight miles and a half, as soon as possible; by this
I hope to avoid the marsh. I shall travel along the beach to the
north of the Adelaide. I did not inform any of the party, except
Thring and Auld, that I was so near to the sea, as I wished to give
them a surprise on reaching it. Proceeded through a light soil,
slightly elevated, with a little ironstone on the surface, the
volcanic rock cropping out occasionally; also some flats of black
alluvial soil. The timber much smaller and more like scrub, showing
that we are nearing the sea. At eight miles and a half came upon a
broad valley of black alluvial soil, covered with long grass; from
this I can hear the wash of the sea. On the other her side of the
valley, which is rather more than a quarter of a mile wide, is
growing aline of thick bushes, very dense, showing that to be the
boundary of the beach. Crossed the valley, and entered the scrub,
which was a complete network of vines. Stopped the horses to clear
a way, whilst I advanced a few yards on to the beach, and was
gratified and delighted to behold the water of the Indian Ocean in
Van Diemen Gulf, before the party with the horses knew anything of
its proximity. Thring, who rode in advance of me, called out "The
Sea!" which so took them all by surprise, and they were so
astonished, that he had to repeat the call before they fully
understood what was meant. Then they immediately gave three long
and hearty cheers. The beach is covered with a soft blue mud. It
being ebb tide, I could see some distance; found it would be
impossible for me to take the horses along it; I therefore kept
them where I had halted them, and allowed half the party to come on
to the beach and gratify themselves by a sight of the sea, while
the other half remained to watch the horses until their return. I
dipped my feet, and washed my face and hands in the sea, as I
promised the late Governor Sir Richard McDonnell I would do if I
reached it. The mud has nearly covered all the shells; we got a
few, however. I could see no sea-weed. There is a point of land
some distance off, bearing 70&deg;. After all the party had had
some time on the beach, at which they were much pleased and
gratified, they collected a few shells; I returned to the valley,
where I had my initials (J.M.D.S.) cut on a large tree, as I did
not intend to put up my flag until I arrived at the mouth of the
Adelaide. Proceeded along the valley; at one mile and a half,
coming upon a small creek, With running water, and the valley being
covered with beautiful green grass, I have camped to give the
horses the benefit of it. Thus have I, through the instrumentality
of Divine Providence, been led to accomplish the great object of
the expedition, and take the whole party safely as witnesses to the
fact, and through one of the finest countries man could wish to
behold-good to the coast and with a stream of running water within
half a mile of the sea. From Newcastle Water to the sea-beach, the
main body of the horses have been only one night without water, and
then got it within the next day. If this country is settled, it
will be one of the finest Colonies under the Crown, suitable for
the growth of any and everything&mdash;what a splendid country for
producing cotton! judging from the number of the pathways from the
water to the beach, across the valley, the natives must be very
numerous; we have not seen any, although we have passed many of
their recent tracks and encampments. The cabbage and fan palm trees
have been very plentiful during to-day's journey down to this
valley. This creek I named "Charles Creek", after the eldest son of
John Chambers, Esq.: it is one by which some large bodies of
springs discharge their surplus water into Van Diemen Gulf; its
banks are of soft mud, and boggy.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 25th July, Charles Creek, Van Diemen
Gulf.</i>&mdash;I have sent Thring to the south-west to see if he
can get round the marsh. If it is firm ground I shall endeavour to
make the mouth of the river by that way. After a long search he has
returned and informs me that it is impracticable, being too boggy
for the horses. As the great object of the expedition is now
attained, and the mouth of the river already well known, I do not
think it advisable to waste the strength of my horses in forcing
them through, neither do I see what object I should gain by doing
so; they have still a very long and fatiguing journey in recrossing
the continent to Adelaide, and my health is so bad that I am unable
to bear a long day's ride. I shall, therefore, cross this creek and
see if I can get along by the sea-beach, or close to it. Started
and had great difficulty in getting the horses over, although we
cut a large quantity of grass, putting it on the banks and on logs
of wood which were put into it. We had a number bogged, and I was
nearly losing one of my best horses, and was obliged to have him
pulled out with ropes; after the loss of some time we succeeded in
getting them all over safely. At two miles came upon an open part
of the beach, went on to it, and again found the mud quite
impassable for horses. Stopped the party, as this travelling is too
much for the horses, and taking Thring with me, rode two miles to
see if the ground was any firmer in places; found it very soft
where the salt water had covered it, in others not so bad. judging
from the number of shells banked up in different places, the sea
must occasionally come over this. I saw at once that this would not
do for the weak state in which my horses were, and I therefore
returned to where I had left the party, resolving to recross the
continent to the city of Adelaide. I now had an open place cleared,
and selecting one of the tallest tress, stripped it of its lower
branches, and on its highest branch fixed my flag, the Union jack,
with my name sewn in the centre of it. When this was completed, the
party gave three cheers, and Mr. Kekwick then addressed me,
congratulating me on having completed this great and important
undertaking, to which I replied. Mr. Waterhouse also spoke a few
words on the same subject, and concluded with three cheers for the
Queen and three for the Prince of Wales. At one foot south from the
foot of the tree is buried, about eight inches below the ground, an
air-tight tin case, in which is a paper with the following
notice:</p>

<blockquote>"South Australian Great Northern Exploring
Expedition.<br>
<br>
"The exploring party, under the command of John McDouall Stuart,
arrived at this spot on the 25th day of July, 1862, having crossed
the entire Continent of Australia from the Southern to the Indian
Ocean, passing through the centre. They left the City of Adelaide
on the 26th day of October, 1861, and the most northern station of
the colony on 21st day of January, 1862. To commemorate this happy
event, they have raised this flag bearing his name. All well. God
save the Queen!"<br>
<br>
(Here follow the signatures of myself and party.)<br>
<br>
As this bay has not been named, I have taken this opportunity of
naming it "Chambers Bay", in honour of Miss Chambers, who kindly
presented me with the flag which I have planted this day, and I
hope this may be the first sign of the dawn of approaching
civilization. Exactly this day nine months the party left North
Adelaide. Before leaving, between the hours of eleven and twelve
o'clock, they had lunch at Mr. Chambers' house; John Bentham Neals,
Esq., being present, proposed success to me, and wished I might
plant the flag on the north-west coast. At the same hour of the
day, nine months after, the flag was raised on the shores of
Chambers Bay, Van Diemen Gulf. On the bark of the tree on which the
flag is placed is cut&mdash;DIG ONE FOOT&mdash;S. We then bade
farewell to the Indian Ocean, and returned to Charles Creek, where
we had again great difficulty in getting the horses across, but it
was at last accomplished without accident. We have passed numerous
and recent tracks of natives to-day; they are still burning the
country at some distance from the coast.</blockquote>
