  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Review</i>, February 1923<br>
  First published as "Oh, Jerusalem!" in <i>The Delineator</i>, April 1921</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">THE MOSLEMS call Jerusalem El-Quds 'The Holy' not
  without justification. They hold it next in importance and sanctity after
  Mecca and Medina, while painfully aware that Christians and Jews give it
  first place in their imaginations, if not actually in their hearts. Moslems
  own most of the property, and practically all the historic sites; the mayor
  is a Moslem, and so are the majority of the Legislative Assembly; but the
  Governor of the city is an Englishman, and the High Commissioner of Palestine
  a Jew. The police are mostly Moslems, with a small army to support them
  composed mainly of Indian troops under British officers. And under the eyes
  of that nervous administration, meet, move, and quarrel, representatives of
  all this world's fanaticisms.</p>

  <p>The city is not visible from far-off, as one might think from studying the
  countless hymns and paeans in its praise. It stands about 3800 feet above
  sea-level. From the summit of the Mount of Olives one can view, like a
  turquoise framed in the yellow of the Mountains of Moab, the Dead Sea, 6000
  feet lower and only twenty miles away. But the bald and rock-strewn Judaean
  Hills &mdash; with laden camels usually on the skyline &mdash; shut off the
  view in all other directions; so that even from the railway station there is
  nothing of the city visible but one corner of the medieval walls and a huge
  French convent.</p>

  <p>However, romance begins from the moment the train leaves the plains at
  Ludd and begins to follow a spur-track into the limestone mountains. In the
  train are 'Parthians, Medes, and Elamites' &mdash; Jews from New York,
  Poland, and Bokhara; Abyssinians; Turkomans, Punjabis, Armenians, Egyptians,
  Englishmen, &mdash; representatives of nearly any nation and religion all the
  way from China to Peru &mdash; a Christian bishop, maybe, chin-by-jowl with a
  Moslem sheik. And there is always someone leaning from a window lecturing the
  rest, with plenty of material for his sermon.</p>

  <p>They boast, and with sufficient truth, that every yard of those hills and
  gorges, among which the train toils noisily, has been fought over a thousand
  times. Not even Belgium has been such a battle-ground. They say the little
  red anemones, that grow wherever a pinch of dirt has settled in the crannies
  of the rocks, mark places where the dead fell fighting. And they point out
  dry stream-beds that "once ran blood for days." No two tales are quite alike;
  they vary with the creed of the individual, and again with his political
  prejudices, which are almost as divergent. But all take pride in the
  fighting, and are in agreement as to that if nothing else.</p>

  <p>There are no trees. Men cut those down to fight with; and amber-eyed,
  black goats, that look like swarms of insects in the distance, devour the new
  shoots. There are ruins everywhere &mdash; caverns for hunted men to hide in
  -sepulchers, long looted &mdash; pralaya plain to see.</p>

  <p>And then Jerusalem, with her domed roofs golden in the sunset, and history
  underfoot. You drive from the station up a dusty road, across a score of
  battle-fields, between stones once set in place by Solomon (whoever he was),
  with walls on your right hand built by the crusaders and repaired by modern
  British troops.</p>

  <p>The walls are magnificent and perfect; there are no such city-walls
  elsewhere. They stand for the most part on the first foundations. There are
  stones in them that have been torn down and replaced a dozen times, as army
  succeeding army sacked the place, and men inspired by undying zeal rebuilt.
  It is safe to say, the only time when Jerusalem was taken and not sacked was
  this last, when Allenby, after terrific fighting, walked in alone on foot,
  when an Arab servant had surrendered the city keys to a British cook with the
  rank of private. The British army set to work at once to spare and preserve;
  prisoners and destitutes were paid to remove dead donkeys and the rest of it
  from the moat and drains; the Order of the Bath was introduced; the city was
  washed; Solomon's Pool, outside the walls, was cemented up and filled with
  water for the first time in centuries for the use of troops. The water-works
  left incomplete by Pontius Pilate were rediscovered and finished. Jerusalem
  still smells of everywhere and everything, but she is tolerable nowadays.</p>

  <p>What strikes you first? Red heads. The boot-blacks at the Jafa Gate, who
  yell for your patronage, are blue-eyed, red-haired &mdash; almost certainly
  descendants of the Scots crusaders; Moslems all since Saladin prevailed, and
  recently Turk conscripts. There is no ill-will on that score. All concede
  that the Turk fought handsomely &mdash; all that is who fought against him
  and have lived beside him since. Islam, sword in hand, attends to business;
  having sheathed the sword, is tolerant. It is due to the humorously patient
  Turk that Christians in Jerusalem did not Kilkenny-cat themselves out of
  existence long ago.</p>

  <p>Then, if it is night, and the modern meanness is invisible, all ancient
  history beckons. You pass by proud-looking Bedouins (some not too proud to
  beg, though wearing amber worth a farm or two) and plunge between laden
  camels into the dark throat of David Street, where the roofs nearly meet
  overhead, above rows of arches (now vegetable stalls) with open fronts, in
  which Knights Templar used to live. To right and left roofed passages, and
  darkness lit at intervals by feeble lamp-rays. Here and there the shadow of a
  Sikh on guard, silent, all-observing, mindful of his duty &mdash; and eleven
  rupees monthly, less deductions for his family in India. Greeks, Jews, Arabs,
  Levantines, brush by you, fitting less awkwardly by dark into the ancient
  molds. Then coffee-shops, where men in red tarboosh talk politics by candle
  light, and spies listen. Snatches of song in Arabic. Melancholy 'cello-music,
  by a Jew from Chicago or somewhere. Explosive bursts of quarreling.
  Silence.</p>

  <p>Narrower and narrower the street grows, until in places you can touch the
  walls with either hand. Through key-hole arches you can peer down dark courts
  and passage-ways, where the mystery reigns. A door opens; a man in Arab robes
  steps out; stands for a moment as if conscious of the picture; disappears.
  Beyond another opening a shadowy camel trudges round and round, grinding out
  semsem, blindfolded, and cursed by someone stridently whenever he pauses for
  a rest.</p>

  <p>Then the walls, and the Haram-es-Shariff, where Omar's Mosque stands; and
  the Dome of the Rock above the far-famed Rock of Abraham. They are lovelier
  by moonlight than the fame of Fars, and mounting the walls you can make the
  whole circuit of the city. Below lies the Valley of Jehoshaphat, glistening
  white with crowded tombs &mdash; "dry bones in the Valley of Death." The
  Hospice on the Mount of Olives, now government headquarters, looms against
  the sky, and around it and about are silhouettes of mosques, and churches,
  where once on a time the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Roman armies camped. From
  the walls you can see the place where Titus rode to reconnoitre, and came
  within an ace of being taken (which might have changed a deal of
  history).</p>

  <p>On the other side, within a stone's throw of the walls, is Golgotha, where
  four roads used to meet, and crucifixions were. Some say the place where they
  buried Jesus is within a hundred yards of that skull-shaped hill, and they
  are probably right if the account in the gospels is at all accurate. The
  moonlight emphasizes the resemblance to a skull, leaving hardly any doubt of
  the locality. But the Christian sects have chosen to adopt as authentic a
  site within the walls where neither execution nor burial can possibly have
  taken place; and there the sects fight and bicker, while a soldier stands on
  guard to keep them from bloodshed. He used to be a Turk, but is nowadays an
  Indian, or a stalwart from some plough-tail in the English shires.</p>

  <p>Most sites within Jerusalem are doubtful, although all are labeled, and
  those possessed by Moslems have at least the merit of really ancient
  tradition and logical argument. The Christian claims all date from the
  crusades, when 'proof' was what a priest or a monk said, and 'fragments of
  the true cross' became almost a drug on the market.</p>

  <p>It is indisputable, for instance, that an enormous and very ancient
  building once stood on the site of the Haram-es-Shariff; and it may have been
  Solomon's Temple. The titanic, squared foundation-stones are there, and one
  wall is standing, to which go the orthodox Jews to mourn the departed glories
  of their race. No orthodox Jew will enter the courtyard surrounding the Dome
  of the Rock, for fear he might tread unwittingly an the spot (unknown now)
  where the Holy of Holies stood. And in any case, Jews are not welcome within
  the mosque, for the Moslems regard them as would-be usurpers.</p>

  <p>Once, when Mohammed shaped his creed and welded Islam into one, he sought
  to attract the Jews by incorporating Jewish legend and the laws of Moses into
  the doctrine; but the Jews rejected all overtures, and ever since, although
  the Moslem has permitted synagogues, he has regarded the Jew as a hereditary
  enemy. He is forever suspicious of Jewish plans to regain possession of
  Jerusalem; the scorn and distrust are mutual, and there is not much love lost
  when Jew and Moslem meet.</p>

  <p>Directly under the Dome of the Rock, protruding through the floor and
  surrounded by an iron railing, is the red rock said to be that on which
  Abraham offered up Isaac (although who first said so is not so clear).
  Underneath it is a cavern (conceivably a cistern once) lit by one small lamp,
  and the guide points out corners in which David, Solomon, Elijah, and
  Mohammed habitually prayed. There is a hollow in the low roof , which they
  tell you receded to let the Prophet of Islam stand upright when he rose from
  prayer, and they also permit you to stand on the very spot from which he rode
  to heaven on his horse Barak.</p>

  <p>The floor of the cavern sounds hollow, and there have been many attempts
  to burrow secretly and discover ancient treasure there &mdash; the true Tomb
  of the Kings perhaps, or the hiding-place of ancient treasures. Some say that
  when Jerusalem was taken everything of value, chronicles included, was hidden
  down there. But the Moslems believe, or at any rate say, that underneath that
  cavern is a hole which reaches to the center of the earth, and thither the
  souls of dead men come once a week. So they guard all approaches carefully,
  and he who seeks to dig a tunnel does so at his own risk, which is imminent
  and not to be withstood by argument.</p>

  <p>There is another story that the Rock of Abraham is the identical
  "threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite" that David purchased for the site
  of the temple his son should build. But there is nothing mentioned in the Old
  or New Testament whose exact location has not been identified by some
  enthusiast and accepted as authentic by others. Within the city-walls they
  show you Pilate's judgment-hall, the tomb of David, the upper room in which
  the Last Supper was held; and he who wishes may believe. Most of the city
  that Pilate knew lies seventy feet below the present level, smothered under
  the debris of centuries; but there are excavations now proceeding that are
  likely to throw wholly new light on history.</p>

  <p>There are people in Jerusalem who have come there from the earth's ends to
  await the last blast of Gabriel's trumpet. The valleys are crowded with the
  graves of Jews, whose bones are expected to arise reclad with flesh and
  clothing when the time comes. Moslems declare that on the last day a hair
  will be stretched across the Valley of Jehosaphat, and over that the
  resurrected True-believer will be required to walk, to save himself from
  hell-fire. Christians have sent their hearts in hundreds to be buried near
  the Holy City. There is a profession, decidedly profitable, whose members
  receive steady remittances from oversea in return for prayers prayed in
  Jerusalem. It is a city of frauds, faith, fanaticism, and sudden death.</p>

  <p>Easter is the riot season. Then, as is so well known, the Christians fly
  at one another, while the Moslem hot-heads are encouraged to attend a rival
  ceremony that takes them in procession to the reputed tomb of Moses, near the
  Dead Sea, an affair that lasts a week and gives the Christians time to
  control themselves. Nothing, not even danger, brings the Christians into
  unity; there is quite likely to be a fight in the Holy Sepulcher on any
  Easter morning, and troops are kept well within hail. The Moslems have their
  differences, too, and have learned these latter days, the art of accusing
  everybody else; but religion unites them at a touch, and they are one at the
  first suggestion of danger to Islam.</p>

  <p>Zionism is regarded as a danger, and for the first time in history has
  found Moslem, Christian, and orthodox Jew making common cause. The Zionists
  base their claim to a national home in Palestine on Old Testament history. In
  fact, they have no other basis for their claim. The Moslems meet them on that
  ground and reply, that if the story of the conquest of the 'Promised Land' is
  true, as stated in the Jewish records, then that is reason enough for not
  admitting Jews today. They point to the accounts of butchery of the
  inhabitants, of intolerance, and of ruthless destruction of cities. They
  claim that they, the Arabs, too, are descendants of Abraham, and were there
  first, with prior right of inheritance. They declare, and the Christians and
  orthodox Jews admit it, that under Moslem rule there has been tolerance of
  other men's religions; and that, whether or not the Jews once owned
  Palestine, confessedly they took it by the sword, and by the sword were
  turned out.</p>

  <p>Nowhere on earth stands the law so plainly written as in Jerusalem, that
  "as ye sow, so shall ye reap." It is a city whose Karma has overtaken her
  before the eyes of all the world, and again and again.</p>

  <p>And Jerusalem stands "beautiful upon a mountain," recleaned, rebuilt,
  rerising like a Phoenix from the ashes of her past, as a symbol that
  something survives in spite of all men's treachery and hatred. Dome, minaret,
  convent roof, and synagogue stand crowded there; and among them and within
  them rivalries persist like worms in a camel's carcass. But the stars smile
  down on all of it &mdash; yet greater symbols, each in its appointed place.
  The flowers bloom and blow in league-long carpets. City of Peace is the
  meaning of the word Jerusalem. And there is peace for him who earns it, even
  there, as everywhere.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, May 1923</h3>

  <p class="cp">March 27, 1923</p>

  <p style="text-indent:0">Dear Madame Tingley:</p>

  <p style="text-indent:0">SINCE I first began to read Professor Kenneth
  Morris's poems and historical works I have found it impossible to speak of
  them without enthusiasm; and it has been a surprise to me to learn that some
  enterprising publisher has not pounced on Professor Morris long ago.</p>

  <p>If only Wells could have gone to school to Morris before he wrote that
  Outline!</p>

  <p>Of course, the day must come when we shall all see history in more nearly
  true proportion and perspective; but why not hasten the day, as it would be
  hastened, if the works of Professor Morris were more widely read?</p>

  <p>Some of his poems, too, are magnificent. All of them are so far above the
  ordinary that, in my judgment, he is in the front rank of modern poets; and,
  at that, I do not know whom I would rank with him.</p>

  <p>To those (and they must be many) who want to know what history is all
  about, instead of how it can be twisted into parish-pump and town-hall
  insignificance, the collected writings of Professor Morris should be the most
  welcome light &mdash; in a darkness, in which we otherwise grope amid the
  bellowing of Gibbon and his imitators.</p>

  <p>The world-vision &mdash; the universal vision, is the need. Professor
  Morris holds a light that we may see by; he disperses historical shadows, and
  the present, in view of the past, becomes intelligible as a pulse-beat in the
  endless, law-obeying process of Evolution. I know of no authority now living
  whose public utterances on the subjects he has chosen I would dare to prefer
  to his.</p>

  <p>The fact, of course is that Professor Morris has gone with open eyes to
  sources that are available to all of us, but which most of us have been
  taught to overlook. Then, not caring greatly for the prejudices of the
  parish-pump spell-binders, he has written honestly of what he knows, and in
  exquisite English.</p>

  <p>The only fault I find with him is, that he does not write more, and
  oftener. Please persuade him to have his works published. It is a public
  duty.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully and friendly,</p>

  <p>Talbot Mundy</p>

  <h3>Published in The Theosophical Path, September 1923</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">THE THEME of Universal Brotherhood is one that seems
  to grow as we consider it; since, being universal, there is nowhere, no
  circumstance, in which its essence is not evident. As a teaspoonful of earth
  may be shown to contain forty millions of demonstrably living and intelligent
  organisms, every one of which suggests from the mere fact of its existence
  undiscoverable hordes of even smaller ones, so every human action is alive
  with countless and immeasurable causes and results. A finger's gesture throbs
  with undying, if forgotten, history; its movement is a consequence, again
  productive of results, however insignificant to us; and we may safely depend
  on it that nothing &mdash; not one thought or thing or action &mdash; can be
  without an absolutely infinite relation to the universe.</p>

  <p>But generalities, however accurate, are too vast for human comprehension.
  The imagination reels, or else the mind's inert unwillingness to think, fogs,
  as it were, the picture. As precept must be taught by parable, the
  measureless and omnipresent fact of Brotherhood can only be brought home to
  us by concrete illustration, and then only provided we remember that, in the
  words of Job, these are [but] parts of His ways.</p>

  <p>The smallest instances suffice. The rarest are least useful. It is from
  the point at which we are that we begin to grasp realities, and only as the
  theme grows real to us can we hope to understand it. <i>Experientia
  docet</i>* is a proverb that was old incalculable centuries before the Romans
  gave it currency and, being absolutely true, is just as true today as then.
  In day-by-day experience, and nohow else, we learn. Unless in day-by-day
  experience we practise that which we have learned, we have no part as yet in
  self-directed evolution, which, as Katherine Tingley&dagger; has told us, is
  the way.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Katherine Tingley</i> &mdash; Katherine Augusta
  Westcot Tingley (1847-1929), a social worker and prominent theosophist.
  Tingley was a social worker in New York when she met William Quan Judge
  (1851-1896), a prominent founding member of the original Theosophical Society
  ... After the Society split and after Judge's death she suceeded him as head
  of the faction of the Society that went with him. On February 13, 1900, she
  transferred the Society's international headquarters from New York City to
  Point Loma, California. Tingley founded the Raja-Yoga School and Theosophical
  University in Point Loma. <i><a href=

  <p>I remember a dying Chinaman, in the swamps of the Umbuluzi River near
  Louren&ccedil;o Marquez &mdash; an unlicensed dealer in illegal drink &mdash;
  who crawled from his sick-bed to help me because he had heard I had fever. We
  had never met until he staggered into my tent, and he died that evening
  without having accomplished anything &mdash; except to change one
  individual's whole concept of the Chinese race. Since that day it is
  impossible for me to think of Chinamen without remembering that one man's
  kindness; I remember it in spite of all the accusations of a hostile press,
  in spite of all-too-authentic fact, and in the face of frenzied prejudice. It
  is not in me to believe that the act of that unmoral, unrepentant 'Chink'
  (for he died quite proud of his disgraceful traffic) was, as Shakespeare
  hints, interred with his bones. I know the kindness multiplied and has more
  than once borne fruit.</p>

  <p>Another man comes to memory &mdash; a coal-black, fuzzy-headed Sudanese,
  who had been a slave under the Mahdi* and whose back was a mass of scars
  where his owners had flogged him. He understood Brotherhood better than most
  of us, although he was not a Christian and used to grow offended at the
  mention of the word. He found his way down to Uganda, where he was enlisted
  in the local troops. I remember his grin when he was patted on the back and
  told to be a credit to the company. He straightened himself, and went on
  straightening himself until he could hardly get his heels down on the floor;
  but it was weeks before he realized he was not dreaming. When it dawned on
  him at last that his white-skinned officer actually did regard him as a
  fellow human being he wakened to a new sense of responsibility. It happened
  quite suddenly; he fell lame on a long march, and his officer, dismounting
  from the only mule, ordered him gruffly and without a trace of sentiment to
  mount and ride. It was funny to watch the awakening consciousness of
  something he had never understood before.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Mahdi</i> &mdash; Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd
  Allah (1844-1885)(otherwise known as The Mahdi or Mohammed Ahmed)was a Muslim
  religious leader, a fakir, in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He declared a jihad
  and raised an army after declaring himself the Mahdi in 1881, and led a
  successful war of liberation from the Ottoman-Egyptian military occupation.
  He died soon after his liberation of Khartoum, and the state he founded fell
  victim to colonial maneuverings that doomed it to reconquest in 1899.

  <p>Within twelve months of that he was a sergeant. Very shortly after his
  promotion, during a crisis, he was left with twenty-five men, all as black as
  himself and with almost equally humble origins, in a dangerous post about six
  days' march from the nearest possible support. It was at a time of almost
  general uprising, when premonitory symptoms of the great war were beginning
  to be felt from end to end of Africa. He was without ammunition, and his
  orders were to keep the peace.</p>

  <p>There was naturally some anxiety among the handful of white officers,
  whose task it was to scatter themselves at strategic points over an enormous
  breadth of country, but it was three weeks before the chance came to visit
  his outpost, and in view of the fact that it was almost the first time he had
  been trusted out of sight, not too much was expected of him. Rumors spread in
  Africa like smoke in the wind, and there was a story that he and all his men
  had been massacred.</p>

  <p>But the flag was flying over the tree-tops when the relieving patrol
  arrived close on sunset. As the sun went down the flag descended with it to
  the music of a bugle, and the first the relief saw of the detachment they
  were standing at the salute with arms presented to the tree that did for
  flag-pole, all present and correct. He had done what few white men could have
  accomplished; not one man of all the twenty-five had any charge against him;
  without bloodshed, and with no more force than that prodigious one of strict
  example, he had 'held down' a district notorious for its savagery, and
  unquestionably saved the lives of hundreds.</p>

  <p>It was not thought wise to compliment him in the presence of his men; that
  might have led to the inference that they had done more than their duty. But
  he was led aside and complimented by an officer whom he had never seen
  before, and who expressed surprise that he should have behaved so splendidly.
  The man's answer told the whole story in ten words: Am I a dog? Nay, I am one
  of you!</p>

  <p>It is easy to say that he was no Theosophist, and I am quite sure he had
  never heard the word; but as a man who proved his claim to be part and parcel
  of a universal brotherhood he stands out as a landmark in my memory.</p>

  <p>Life is crowded with similar instances, and there is no need to wander far
  for them. We can even read of them in books. It is the thrill that counts
  &mdash; that warning from within that we have touched the sacred, splendid
  chord that unifies all being. If the heart is touched, the intellect responds
  not too long afterwards; and no one who has thrilled to an ideal, however
  vague, can ever quite relapse into unrecognition of it, nor can fail to pass
  the regenerating thrill along, in some way, even if he does not know it.</p>

  <p>How much unselfishness and willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of
  others has been poured into the world through the pages of what is called
  profane history? The very color of my school-days &mdash; the whole flavor of
  my later life &mdash; was brightened by the story of the Plataeans at
  Marathon. There must be thousands who have felt the same thrill, generation
  after generation. When the hosts of the King, the great King Xerxes, lay
  between Athens and the sea, the Plataeans repaid a debt. The Athenians had
  helped them once, and now that the Athenians faced what seemed inevitable
  ruin the Plataeans marched to their aid with all they had. They left their
  old men and the women to guard Plataea's walls and came eight hundred strong
  &mdash; a handful &mdash; hardly a battalion. But no quarrels of historians,
  nor all the sins of Athens, nor the mists of time, can drown the echo of the
  roar that went up on the heights of Marathon when dawn rose on the spears of
  those eight hundred marching down to die beside their friends. No matter
  whether Persians or Athenians had the right of it; the Higher Law takes care
  of that. The Plataeans let some light into the world by proving what they
  understood of brotherhood. If they had known more and done less, there are
  nations today that would be poorer for it &mdash; poorer, that is, in the
  elements that count. For in the long run nothing counts but Brotherhood. Its
  highest unselfish expression from day to day, by each individual in his
  degree, is the only Path by which we may ascend the ever-rising rounds of
  evolution. There are more degrees of brotherhood, more phases of it, than
  there are living organisms in that spoonful of earth under the
  magnifying-glass.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, October 1923</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">IN EARLIER days, when Canada was hardly yet
  beginning to be won from the wilderness, it was the custom when sending a man
  on a long journey to supply him with three fish-hooks and a rabbit-snare.
  Those represented rations. It was his business to convert them into meat.
  When he failed, he perished. A great deal has been said and sung about the
  resourcefulness of the type of man evolved by that system, and there is
  considerable silence concerning those who found the fish-hooks and the
  rabbit-snare inadequate, and died. But it is noteworthy that the system, at
  any rate, has not survived. It has been found wiser to supply men in advance
  with adequate provision of the right kind, before expecting from them results
  worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>The men who devised the fish-hook and rabbit-snare system were probably
  quite familiar with the New Testament parable that mentions men asking for
  bread and being given stones; but, if they reasoned about it at all, they may
  have argued that with stones men might go forth and kill meat, which, as far
  as it goes, is a sound enough material argument.</p>

  <p>But these material arguments, however superficially logical, look less
  alluring when followed to their conclusion, which is this: that, just as no
  stream can flow to a point higher than its source, and like begets like, so
  no material noumenon* can produce spiritual phenomena. That which is born of
  the flesh is flesh, to quote the New Testament again; and no amount of
  torturing, tampering with, or studying mere flesh will ever gain a spiritual
  end.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>noumenon</i> (Greek) &mdash; in the philosophical
  system of Immanuel Kant, a "thing-in-itself" (Ding-an-Sich); it is opposed to
  phenomenon, the thing that appears to us. Noumena are the basic realities
  behind all sensory experience. According to Kant, they are not knowable
  because they cannot be perceived, but they must be thinkable because moral
  decision making and scientific investigation cannot proceed without the
  assumption that they exist. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/65/no/noumenon.html">The Columbia
  Encyclopedia</a></i>, 6th edition. ]</p>

  <p>But matter is deceptive stuff and we, being plunged into it, are easily
  deceived. No sooner is one material basis found unsuitable on which to build
  a tower that shall reach the skies than another presents itself, often so
  subtly disguised as to make the most cautious of us think it is not material
  at all, but something spiritual, on which we may safely rear our monument of
  progress.</p>

  <p>Yet the world is strewn with proofs that nothing &mdash; absolutely
  nothing based on material cause and effect can endure, or can do anything but
  crumble. Consider the ancient temples. If beauty and purity of outline may be
  taken as criterion, then unquestionably the men who designed and built many
  of those ancient fanes were spiritual thinkers. Yet the ruins of their
  buildings strew the earth, and most of us are therefore willing to admit that
  neither their knowledge nor their art was in the stones they wrought, but in
  the minds of the men themselves.</p>

  <p>The spirit and the art endure. It is possible, by purity of purpose and
  sincere effort, for any of us to become the servants of that spirit and to
  learn that art; and it would be inevitable then that beauty would adorn our
  path; whatever we should touch would take on dignity and charm. But equally
  inevitably, those who should think the spirit and the art were in the thing
  wrought, gainers though they might be for a while by contemplation of mere
  consequences, would base their own efforts on false premises and would
  descend by gradual or rapid stages to unspiritual ugliness. That is why great
  leaders, great reformers, and great artists have so seldom left behind them
  others who could carry on their work and carry it to greater heights; the
  most enthusiastic sometimes are most dazzled by the effects of the leader's
  work and, worshiping effects, fall soonest by the way.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
  nothing..." &mdash; <i>John</i>, 6:63.</p>

  <p>We forever put the cart before the horse. In this age of machinery it is
  fashionable to assert that our progress, such as it is, has been due to
  machinery. We worship the machine &mdash; put faith in it, just as they who
  saw those marvelous ancient temples rise and change the whole face of their
  surroundings, came to worship the shrine instead of the Idea and the honesty
  that gave it birth. The truth is, that increasing intelligence has produced
  machinery, exactly as increasing spiritual vision would produce a higher
  art.</p>

  <p>I remember three instances that serve to illustrate. In Assam, years ago,
  when they were building the first railway through the country, thousands of
  Indian laborers were employed to dig embankments. The means employed was the
  ancient one of filling baskets with dirt, to be carried on men's heads,
  sometimes for the length of half a mile, and dumped &mdash; a tedious, slow
  process that got severely on the nerves of one contractor. He was a rather
  young man, used to the new efficiency, full of ambition for a useful career,
  and equally full of scorn for ancient ways. Progress, in his mind, and
  machinery, were one. He decided to import machinery and, rather accurately
  gaging the intelligence of the laborers he had to deal with, decided that
  wheelbarrows would be enough for a beginning.</p>

  <p>The wheelbarrows arrived &mdash; extremely up-to-date ones made of steel.
  The obedient laborers studied them with great distaste and worse
  bewilderment, filled them with rather less earth than they had formerly, put
  into the baskets in order to reduce the weight as nearly as possible to
  normal, and carried the wheelbarrows on their heads. Nor could they be
  persuaded to do otherwise. At the end of the second day they went on strike,
  arguing with perfect reason from their viewpoint that the contractor had made
  their work cruelly toilsome. What he had overlooked was that even so simple a
  sign of progress as a wheelbarrow and its proper use must be a result of
  progress in a man's mind, and can never be the cause of it.</p>

  <p>A somewhat similar incident occurred in a native state in another part of
  India. There was famine, and as the result of the distress a commission was
  appointed to inquire into the causes. The commission in all honesty decided
  that the ancient ways were at fault; that men whose plows were little better
  than a forked stick could hardly be expected to produce crops in sufficient
  abundance to tide them over lean years. It was decided to import good steel
  plows from the United States, and that was done; the plows were distributed
  about the countryside, and the peasantry were told that an era of prosperity
  had dawned &mdash; the plows would solve the problem of supply. But to this
  day the remains of those imported mysteries lie rusting in the fields, and
  the peasantry still use the ancient implements. The only result accomplished
  was to convince the peasantry that for inscrutable reasons their rulers had
  tried to burden them with foreign difficulties in addition to their own
  &mdash; which, they reasonably argued, already were enough.</p>

  <p>I was witness of another incident, yet better to the point, in Africa,
  away off in the wilderness, a good week's march from rail-head. Those were
  early days, when colonial government-machinery had been set up but was not
  yet fully functioning. Much of the local government of outlying districts was
  left to the tribes themselves, and their jealousies and rivalries led to a
  vast amount of bickering and murder. Serious cases of dispute were supposed
  to be submitted to the colonial official, fifty or a hundred miles away, but
  nothing could convince the natives that the official judgment was not
  prejudiced, and nearly every legal decision led to worse strife than it
  cured.</p>

  <p>But there was a British sergeant sent to an outlying post in the district
  I have in mind, whose sole official business was to teach a company of newly
  raised native police the elements of discipline. He was not exactly an
  illiterate man, but he had received no more education than he had managed to
  pick up in the army-school, and the best thing he had learned was how to mind
  his own business; and the business was, by example, precept and watchfulness,
  to teach new standards of self-respect to naked recruits. They were of
  several tribes, and as many prejudices, so he had his hands full.</p>

  <p>It dawned after a time on the recruits that there was something in his
  method, new to their experience, which was better than their own accustomed
  ways. He taught a new loyalty, to a brotherhood based on a high ideal, and
  the discipline grew, not because he punished them, for he was very sparing
  with penalties, but from imitation of his self-respect.</p>

  <p>The marvel took place within sight of a dozen villages, whose inhabitants
  watched the amazing patience and good-humored justice of a stranger who
  accepted no bribes, played no favorites, and cared for nothing but the
  welfare of his proteges. He was not like any other stranger they had ever
  seen; he used to tell his men stories at night over a camp-fire, used to
  dance for them, sing to them, and &mdash; most remarkable of all &mdash;
  although he seemed so fond of them, he took the part of villagers whom they
  molested in their dawning consciousness of the power that goes hand-in-hand
  with fraternity.</p>

  <p>It was not very long before the neighboring tribes began to bring their
  own disputes to him for settlement. He told them he had no authority, either
  to pass judgment or to enforce decisions. They liked that, and insisted all
  the more that he should act the part of judge. They offered him presents, if
  he would hold the scales of justice, and when he refused those they were all
  the more insistent. He told them he knew nothing about judicial procedure,
  and they answered that they were very glad to hear that, since they sought
  justice and merely what was right.</p>

  <p>At last he yielded, very much against his inclination, and the
  unprecedented spectacle was seen day after day, of villagers from fifty miles
  away, whom nothing less than force could have induced to take their quarrels
  to the constituted courts, arguing their cases before this unauthorized,
  uneducated sergeant, accepting his decisions without question, and returning
  to their homes in peace to abide by them. Murders and inter-village fighting
  almost ceased. Unpaid, unpurchasable, plain, disinterested honesty succeeded,
  where an empire's legal processes had failed.</p>

  <p>The sergeant returned in due course to the Birmingham slums and oblivion;
  but he had left behind him consequences that no official formulas or red tape
  could quite undo. The subsequent administration of the country took its tone,
  to some extent, from that one man's example, and for years to come his
  judgments (some of them hugely humorous) were cited as unofficial precedents
  for official guidance.</p>

  <p>Men will ever rebel against machinery. We have machines in politics, in
  trade and in religion; yet no machine ever contributed one straw to the
  world's progress, and every machine is a degrading factor from the moment it
  becomes anything more than a means to eliminate toil &mdash; anything more
  than a consequence of intelligent and honest thinking.</p>

  <p>It is so with Brotherhood. No man, no group of men or nations can create
  it by decree, or by new intricate machinery. The Brotherhood must come first,
  out of individual effort to attainment of its high ideal; the means of its
  expression afterwards. A League of Nations &mdash; all the nations &mdash; is
  inevitable when the nations recognize the Universal Law. A dozen men who
  recognize that Law, and live by it, accomplish more toward true peace than
  can all the machinery of law-courts and governments ever invented.
  Theosophists, by living their Theosophy, will sow the seed that can not fail
  to spring up and ripen into all-inclusive Brotherhood. If a League should be
  an accompaniment who shall complain? But shall we have the Brotherhood and
  Justice first, or the machinery?</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, November 1923</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">TRUTH is King, and is never in the least concerned
  about the passions of the moment. With all eternity ahead and to look back
  upon, serenely autocratic in an everlasting Now, Truth rules impartially all
  the universe including this temporary world of ours.</p>

  <p>And the world is quite full of a number of things, not least of them,
  proverbs. Proverbs are the oldest crystallizations of human thought, and some
  of them are diamond-hard, reflecting the fires of Truth in whatever light,
  from whichever angle they are studied. Such proverbs persist. Some fall by
  the way because men grow weary of them, seeing deeds so short of the ideal.
  Some lapse into disrespect because other proverbs, with meanings apparently
  exactly opposite, come into more general use. But all proverbs were
  originally efforts to express a glimpse of Truth and, however contradictory
  their meanings seem, all proverbs still are windows, as it were, through
  which some aspect of infinite Truth may be seen by discerning eyes.</p>

  <p>From the dawn of recorded history men have always sought to coin short
  phrases that should be imperishable guides of conduct &mdash; brief,
  indisputable interpretations of the Higher Law, by use built into the
  familiar speech. And one of those proverbs was, that familiarity breeds
  contempt. Popularization of a proverb brings it into eventual disrepute,
  exactly as the dogmatization of religion foretells its disintegration and
  collapse. For it is the habit of the human mind to seek to standardize, and
  to obstruct spiritual progress by legalizing the dead letter of the proverb
  or the creed.</p>

  <p>But nothing stands still; not even Truth. The more determined the effort
  of man's lower nature to produce inertia by literal enforcement of the dry
  husk of a truth, the swifter is the proof that evolution must prevail and
  that inertia is delusion.</p>

  <p>The proper study of mankind is man. In the last analysis there is nothing
  else that man can study. He must be conscious of himself; and, as
  consciousness grows, its horizons widen until the task of self-knowledge
  becomes all-absorbing and all-useful. Not the least interesting discovery to
  which that study leads is the constant effort of man's lower nature to
  smother those rare glimpses of the Higher Law from which it cannot escape,
  and to corrupt their meaning, by substituting the letter for the spirit and
  by decreeing Thus far shalt thou go and no farther.</p>

  <p>This method of the lower nature is that so anciently and frequently
  denounced, of setting up false gods, whose 'image and superscription'* differ
  hardly, if at all, from a superficial glimpse of Truth. The lower nature is
  nothing if not hypocritical. It will denounce most fervently those crimes it
  most loves to commit, and all the worst atrocities are perpetrated in the
  name of righteousness and progress, the secret of which is simple: evil being
  the reverse of Truth, as darkness is the opposite of light, it is impossible
  for evil to exist or to find expression without consciousness of Truth with
  which to contrast itself.</p>

  Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's" ( <a href=

  <p>Evil has no originality, it imitates; and all false gods are counterfeits
  of true ones. The invention of a lie is contingent on the existence of Truth
  to be lied about. It is possible to invent a lie about any of the infinite
  and glorious aspects of Truth; it is possible to believe that lie, and to
  legalize the belief in it. But the belief is a delusion of the lower nature,
  subject to the lower law that governs both. It moves as Truth moves, though
  the action is reversed. As Truth evolves in realms beyond the comprehension
  of such stuff as dreams are made of, ever ascending to higher and rarer
  being, the lie about Truth disperses and descends to irrecoverable chaos;
  until a new glimpse of Truth makes new lies possible and the habit of
  self-delusion re-begins a downward path.</p>

  <p>There was a King of England who proclaimed a truth, to his own undoing,
  seeking to use Truth for his own ends, instead of letting Truth use him.
  Whoever is used by Truth is in the everlasting arms of absolute
  infallibility. Truth being King, there is no error in the formula the King
  can do no wrong. But he who sets out to reduce the King to human blood and
  bones and to confine Truth within the limits of a proclamation, levying
  blackmail in the name of pure Truth, is a traitor whose head is forfeit.</p>

  <p>Charles the First, proclaiming that the King rules by divine right and
  that the King can do no wrong, quite likely believed his own words, but by
  applying them to his own person he nevertheless betrayed Omnipotence. Belief
  is quite another thing from knowledge, as the writers of the New Testament
  strove so diligently to make clear by the discriminating use of words that
  their translators subsequently bungled. Accident may cause belief to stumble
  on the right Path, but nothing less than Knowledge holds us there; it is
  belief &mdash; blind faith &mdash; that seizes on the letter of the law; the
  spirit of the law is only grasped by understanding, leading on to
  Knowledge.</p>

  <p>Even in ermine robes and panoply of state Charles the First was not so
  unlike the rest of us that he was King-less. Had he understood the truth he
  uttered; had he allowed that royal Higher Nature, that is ever ready to
  govern every one of us, to take control of him it is likely he would have
  been less worried about his personal importance and less inclined to make use
  of phrases that might be too easily misunderstood; instead, he would have
  found his true royalty appealing to the Higher Nature that exists in every
  man. His body and his stupid senses then might not have been a target for his
  outraged countrymen. They charged him with treason to the State; but the
  treason he committed was to his own King, by permitting his lower nature to
  usurp the title of the Higher.</p>

  <p>The old Priest-Kings, of whom dim records still remain, made no such
  error. They strode like Gods among men, and it may be that the crowd mistook
  their persons for the Truth they served, but the Priest-Kings had no ear for
  flattery. It was not until the lower nature swamped the Higher and usurped
  precedence &mdash; not until the letter of the Law was reckoned higher than
  its spirit &mdash; not until flesh and bones and the convenience of a moment
  grew to be considered more important than true Vision, and the pomp and
  circumstance of earthly power blinded them to the promptings of passionless
  Truth, that the Priest-Kings disappeared.</p>

  <p>Kings are not different from other men, and other men not different from
  kings, except that the law of Karma, adjusting balances, has cast us each
  into our proper temporary orbit. All are prone to make the same mistakes. The
  King's head fell, but the King's mistake remained. Men said he needed no
  successor, seeing they all were kings by a right as divine as that one he had
  claimed. They spoke the truth, believing and not knowing, many of them
  doubtless tossing the mockery of the truth from lip to lip in jest. Belief,
  so vague it hardly yet amounted to belief, was crystallized into a lie more
  swiftly than running water changes into ice; and on to the ice the snow of
  dogma fell. The stream still flowed beneath the ice, as beneath every creed
  flows everlasting Truth; but the surface, like the letter of the law, proved
  barren, comfortless, unprofitable, cold needing the sun of true Vision to
  penetrate and melt it.</p>

  <p>In very truth we all are Kings, if we remember who and what we really are;
  but in our lower nature we are nothing multiplied by all the ills that flesh
  is heir to. Times beyond number in human history the doctrine of the divine
  right of kings has changed into the formula <i>Vox populi vox dei</i>*
  &mdash; and back again by way of grim dictatorships &mdash; glimpses, both of
  them, of royal Truth immediately clouded over by the noxious fumes of
  ignorance. The clamor of bribed majorities, in place of one man's personal
  opinion, is labeled the accepted voice of God; and under such manipulated
  tyranny of ignorance men have even voted that the earth is flat &mdash; have
  insisted on the lie so vehemently that their priesthood dared not contradict
  them &mdash; even as today they vilify and loathe whoever dares to tell the
  truth in spite of massed opinion, and smother the voice of Truth with noise.
  Yet the world was never flat; twice two were never five; the truth, and
  nothing but the truth, is true. We are Kings &mdash; by divine right &mdash;
  and our Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom. But the pity of it is that we
  allow our lower nature to usurp the throne.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Vox populi vox dei</i> (Latin) &mdash; The voice of
  the people (is) the voice of God. See <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/81/17200.html">Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and
  Fable</a>.</i> ]</p>

  <p>The King can do no wrong. That is a positive statement of absolute fact
  that has been known since the beginning of the world. But it is equally true
  that whoever is governed by his lower nature can do no right. The lower
  nature has no vision, no far-sightedness, knows nothing of causes or of the
  ultimate; it seeks only to escape the consequences of its own wrong-doing and
  to perpetuate and justify itself. The lower nature is a vortex of ignorance
  into which we are plunged for our experience, and if we leave it as we find
  it we are not Kings, for we have not ruled, we have not conquered. If we
  increase the ignorance and add to the chaos of passions, as we surely will do
  if we serve the lower nature and let that make itself the King, we only pile
  up difficulties for ourselves to meet. The law of Karma, faithfully adjusting
  balances, is inescapable; for whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he
  shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken
  away even that he hath.</p>

  <p>The divine right of the real Man is to leave the world a little better
  than he found it, careless of his own advantage since he is the heir of all
  the ages; and therein lies the secret of the law laid down by Teachers of the
  Mysteries in the very dawn of time. As they revealed to chosen individuals
  the 'might, majesty, dominion, and power' of all who recognize their own
  divinity, they stipulated that never in any conceivable circumstances should
  the consciousness of power be used for personal advantage, whether for fame,
  reward, money, or mere contentment; for those are the means by which the
  lower nature seeks to usurp the throne &mdash; the means by which it blinds
  itself to the truth of being.</p>

  <p>Human opinion and the senses being the <i>fons et origo</i>* and the
  channel through which evil operates, to yield or to pander to either of them
  is to apply the old dishonored policy of setting thieves to catch thieves,
  seeking to destroy one evil with a greater, doing ill that good may come of
  it &mdash; a policy, as distinguished from a principle. So-called good
  policy, too often a convenient fraud in disguise and at best an expedient,
  bears no relation to true Principle, which, being Truth in one of its
  infinite aspects, can do no wrong, can lead to no wrong, and must infallibly
  produce results that impartially benefit everyone and in consequence, if only
  in minute degree, the Universe.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>fons et origo</i> (Latin) &mdash; the primary
  cause; literally: the source and the origin. <i><a href=
  "http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe?fons+origo">William
  Whitaker's Words</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>We are blinded by the temporary nature of this sense-delusion into which
  we are plunged. The 'three-score years and ten' that have been sung and
  standardized as the limit of a man's life have no real bearing on the problem
  that confronts us. Truth applied knows nothing of any limitations, least of
  all limits of time, and in no circumstances does Truth afford benefit to one,
  to the exclusion of any others. The King who can do no wrong, the immortal,
  real, spiritual, royal man is too far-sighted to suppose that temporary
  personal convenience can condition Truth. Knowing that the sense-delusion is
  as sure to be destroyed eventually as the fog is sure to be dispersed by wind
  and sun, he thinks on higher planes and acts without fear.</p>

  <p>All of the world's kings, rulers, statesmen &mdash; all of these whose
  names are held in honor long after they are dead, were men who abode by
  Principle; the good they did lived after them. There was a Roman once, named
  Regulus,* who was taken prisoner by his country's enemies. After long years
  of barbarous ill-treatment he was sent by his captors to Rome to mediate for
  a convenient peace, and, knowing he was an honorable man, they accepted his
  word that, if he should fail to negotiate peace, he would return to Carthage
  to be put to death. There was nothing new in that condition; the lower
  nature, recognizing the royal power of the Higher, forever seeks to take
  advantage of it for its own perpetuation.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Regulus</i> &mdash; Marcus Atilius Regulus (d. ca.
  250 BCE), a Roman general in the First Punic War. While consul (267 BCE) he
  conquered the Sallentini and captured Brundisium (now Brindisi). He became
  consul a second time (256), defeated the Carthaginians at sea, and waged war
  against them in Africa, at first with success. Soon afterward the
  Carthaginians won a complete victory and captured (255) Regulus. He was sent
  on parole to solicit peace from the Romans, but instead he advised the senate
  against accepting the Punic terms or exchanging prisoners. Resisting
  persuasions to break his parole, he returned to Carthage, where he was
  supposedly tortured to death. The story made Regulus famous as a Roman
  patriot-martyr. <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/re/Regulus1.html">The
  Columbia Emcyclopedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>But Regulus went to Rome and told the truth. He urged the Romans to make
  no peace with men, whose only object in negotiating temporary peace was to
  gain time for Rome's eventual destruction. Having persuaded his countrymen to
  take the course he knew was best, but that could only mean hideous death for
  himself, he kept his word and returned to Carthage, where the Carthaginians
  also kept their word and tortured him until he died.</p>

  <p>If Regulus had let his personal convenience or his personal advantage
  govern him, there were no doubt scores of specious arguments he might have
  used and scores of men high in the public esteem who would have condoned
  those arguments. He could have died, perhaps, in comfort, not dishonored by
  the countrymen whom he chose, instead, to serve by upholding his own highest
  standard of true honor. Unquestionably, at the moment, by the mob, he was
  regarded as an altruistic fool, and it is not likely that the Carthaginians
  thought any better of him until they reaped the consequences of their own
  attempt to misuse a true man's honesty.</p>

  <p>Regulus had served the whole world by ignoring his own personal safety. It
  may have made no difference in the long run whether Rome or Carthage won the
  war for control of the world's trade. What mattered was, that Regulus had
  raised a standard of good faith, true patriotism, and adherence to the
  highest glimpse of Principle. Of Carthage there is nothing left but legend,
  not too savory; and it is fashionable, too, to speak and to write of Rome as
  the Wolf of the Tiber, decadent and drenched in blood. None praises Rome for
  her debauchery.</p>

  <p>But Rome survives in law, incorporated into all the statute-books of all
  the nations. Rome's new standard, manfully upheld by Regulus, became a
  measure by which men judged their deeds &mdash; so much so, that when Rome
  fell short of that high ideal, those who had seen her at her best were
  scandalized. Rome's legionaries laid all the known world under tribute, and
  wrought evil that reacted on them in the end and ruined Rome; but who forgets
  the manliness of Regulus? What nation has not benefited by the force of his
  example and by the spirit of loyalty to a high ideal with which he imbued his
  countrymen? &mdash; a spirit that marched with the conquering legionaries,
  surviving them and all their sins. More than two thousand years after Regulus
  made his supreme self-sacrifice, school-children, on continents of whose
  existence Regulus was unaware, speaking languages whose synonyms &mdash;
  Honor, Fidelity, Devotion, Constancy &mdash; are rooted in the speech of
  Regulus, are thrilled, as no story of ill-faith nor any history of conquest
  can thrill them, by the record of how Regulus stood up alone and played the
  man.</p>

  <p>The good, that Shakespeare says is oft interred with our bones, survives
  in spite of death and all the ills that flesh is heir to. All good is rooted
  in unselfishness, and self-consideration is a thief that stalks by night to
  undo what can never be undone &mdash; the Truth of Being.</p>

  <p>Truth is King. The Way is to be loyal to the King. The time is now. The
  question is not, what does the world think? or what is convenient? or what
  will the consequences be to me personally? But what do I know? What is my own
  individual highest understanding of the Truth? And what do I, now, free heir
  of all the ages, mean to think and do? The King can do no wrong, and he who
  is obedient to the King can do no other than the highest right, injuring
  none, not even himself, although unselfishness may cause a husk of
  imitation-life to fall away.</p>

     name="ref09">THE TURNING TIDE</a><br>
  <small>TWO RECENT BOOKS &mdash; A REVIEW</small></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, December 1923</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">WE ARE the masters of our destiny, and our modern
  world appears to be waking to that fact, which the ancients knew well enough.
  They looked forward, whereas we for the most part waste time wishing for the
  might-have-been, blaming ourselves, our politicians, and our forebears for
  the dilemma with which we are faced, so psychologized by evil as to view the
  future only through the lens of hopelessness. Nevertheless, there are those
  who see that the past, so far as we can change it or its consequences, is a
  closed book; "nor all thy piety nor all thy wit can ... cancel half a line,
  nor all thy tears wash out a word of it." The past is sealed. Remains to scan
  the future, to relay its courses; and it can be done. There are more armed
  men in the world today than there were in 1914, and there is less apparent
  Brotherhood; but that is only on the surface, for the tide has turned &mdash;
  that "tide in the affairs of men" that sweeps whole nations forward, or
  drowns them. We have our choice to sink or swim.</p>

  <p>The clearest symptom of the turning tide is discontent, as often as not
  amounting to contempt for outworn theories. There is not one land remaining
  in the world in which the doctrine of righteousness of war is not dishonored
  and discredited. It is still possible to believe, and to make others believe,
  that war is inevitable, but the prospect is no longer viewed with zeal.
  Treaties to prevent war are regarded cynically, but only because it is known
  how lightly "scraps of paper" were regarded in the past. There are
  comparatively very few today, even among those who constantly proclaim the
  certainty of future war, who are not ready to mock the theory that war can
  possibly benefit even the conqueror. It is beginning to be understood at last
  that no good comes of evil. And although that understanding brews despair in
  the hearts of those who can see nothing but evil on every hand, there are
  those who dare to look a second and a third time, and to hope, and to shout
  their hope above the din of pessimism &mdash; a brave, increasing company,
  not least of whom are L.P. Jacks and H.G. Wells, authors to whom the world is
  lending an increasingly attentive ear. The time is ripe. Their doctrine may
  be wrong. But it will not be their fault if the world does not look for
  itself, and hope again, and through hope discover a way out of its
  predicament.</p>

  <p>It would be unfair to Wells, Jacks, and the world to pretend that either
  man has been doing more than splendid plow-work. They are breaking up barren
  fields in a dreary, horizontal wilderness, preceded in the task by G.B. Shaw,
  who smashed immovable rocks of self-contented stupidity, using a
  disrespectful hammer and the acid of merciless ridicule. The seed is being
  sown by another hand. The cultivation waits for the rest of us to do.</p>

  <p>All three men &mdash; Shaw, Jacks, Wells &mdash; are perfectly aware that
  what the world needs is spiritual thinking. It may be that they all three
  know what spiritual thinking is. But if so they have held their hand wisely
  because if they had sown that seed in the unploughed waste of materialism, it
  never could have sprung up. What little spiritual propaganda they emit
  suggests plowmen whistling at their work, not accomplishing much music (the
  tune is now and then off-key) but encouraging themselves, which is the main
  thing, for because of it the breaking of long furrows in the rock-ribbed
  thought of men is being well done. One does not plow a wilderness by arguing
  in terms of semiquavers; nor need one respect the plowman any less if a
  blackbird's song in the hedgerow fails to divert his attention from the
  excellence of bread and cheese. For after all, and in the last analysis, it
  is of bread and cheese that all three sing. The point is, they are honest
  plowmen.</p>

  <p>It is possible to imagine that Shaw, Jacks, and Wells may be dissatisfied
  with the seed that someone is planting in their tireless wake, for it is seed
  of a forgotten sort. All plowmen are conservatives. Cincinnatus, be it
  remembered, went back to his plowing after he had saved Rome; he broke up
  what was wrong, prepared the soil for something better, and, when progress
  came, took no delight in it. Nevertheless, he was a hero and his name
  survives, as those of Shaw, Jacks, and Wells surely should do long after the
  names of the abominations they assail shall have been forgotten.</p>

  <p>Shaw has been so praised and hated, and so gloriously misunderstood; so
  much of his sledge-hammer work has been done, and he has survived the
  hornet-stings of criticism so cheerfully, that he may be left chuckling while
  he considers some new satirical assault on the world's cruelty and
  self-esteem. Shaw is sure to be surprising when he swings his sledge again.
  Meanwhile, Wells, and Jacks are more in the public eye.</p>

  <p class="headline">"MEN LIKE GODS"</p>

  <p>H.G. Wells has come out openly and said: "I desire the confederation of
  mankind." In the first of a series of syndicated newspaper articles, which
  provide for him a more numerous and probably more attentive audience than any
  previous writer has ever had in his own lifetime, he prefaces his effort with
  a statement which assures us we are not wasting time listening to a mere
  experimenter with the world's emotions. "Since 1917," he writes, "I have
  given much more of my waking life to that vision of a confederated mankind
  than I have given to any other single interest or subject." Good. That means,
  we have a duty to ourselves to listen seriously, for whatever may be said in
  disparagement of Wells by his critics he is undeniably a thinker, whose mode
  of expressing his thought is clear, who habitually thinks before he writes,
  and who is not afraid to irritate those who do not agree with him. Men Like
  Gods (1923) preceded these newspaper articles. It is the most recent of
  forty-five books by the same author, and it seems to be his effort to depict
  a vision that he sees, toward which he would like to lead the world. He seeks
  to show us what the world might be, if we would only abandon all the idiotic
  suppositions and false standards that have led us to the present state of
  conflict; and he undoubtedly succeeds in describing a prodigiously more
  agreeable planet than that on which we live and move and have our being at
  the moment.</p>

  <p>His hero, Mr. Barnstaple, is a typical Wells hero, a kindly, obscure,
  rather bewildered father of a family, who loves his wife and grown-up sons
  with quiet devotion, but who finally rebels against the tyranny of a suburban
  household and starts out in a small motor-car on a vacation by himself. By a
  miracle that leaves the reader to imagine what he likes about Einstein's
  Relativity, but that does not preclude the probability that Wells has been
  studying The Secret Doctrine. Mr. Barnstaple suddenly finds himself on
  another planet, on another dimension. The miracle turns out to have been
  engineered by two scientific experimenters on this four-dimensional planet,
  and the same explosion (or whatever it was that happened) catches in its
  vortex and transfers along with Mr. Barnstaple another motor-car full of
  individuals whom the author adroitly uses to typify those elements of society
  that are holding our own world back from the fair development that would be
  possible if it were not for their political power, their stupidity, and their
  convictions.</p>

  <p>The limousine's occupants consist of Mr. Catskill, Secretary of State for
  War; Mr. Burleigh, a great conservative leader; Lady Stella, one of the upper
  ten; Mr. Freddy Mush, secretary to Mr. Catskill and incidentally an
  intellectual poseur; Father Amerton, A Roman Catholic priest very much 'in
  society,' whose reputation has been made by denouncing society's sins; and
  Robert, the chauffeur. To these, in yet another car that has been caught in
  the blast of the experiment, are presently added Lord Barralanga, a business
  man who has recently purchased a peerage; Miss Greta Grey, a rather notorious
  actress; an American named Hunder, the 'cinema king'; Emile Dupont, a
  Frenchman; and Ridley, a chauffeur. The party of 'earthlings' now includes
  sufficient pegs for the author to hang most of our world's stupidities to,
  with Mr. Barstaple charmingly and modestly acting the part of Magdalene. He
  is the only sympathetic character among the 'earthlings,' as the author
  manifestly intends, and Mr. Barnstaple is so well drawn that he succeeds in
  balancing the purposely exaggerated crudity of all the others. But it is
  perhaps a pity that Lady Stella was not used to illustrate the effect on a
  really spiritual-minded woman of being suddenly transferred to the author's
  fourth-dimension planet. In fact, the book's one weakness is that there is
  not a woman in it whom we can like and with whom we can sympathize, as we
  like and sympathize with Mr. Barnstaple.</p>

  <p>Even among the Utopian women whom we meet in the course of the story there
  is none whom we feel particularly sorry to leave behind us when the story is
  finished, although the author devotes considerable space to describing the
  condition of the women of this Utopia and several individuals have the stage
  to themselves for a while.</p>

  <p>Like the men of Utopia, the women go without clothes; they are modest; and
  they realize that these earthlings are in no fit mental state to follow their
  example; when Greta Gray makes bold to imitate them, they provide her with a
  garment. And it is interesting to observe that the only members of the
  'earthling' party who take offense at the Utopians' nudity are Father Amerton
  and the two chauffeurs.</p>

  <p>The story is too good to be told in a review, and its imaginative scope is
  too vast to be compressed into any sort of tabloid form. The author has
  described for us a world in which there are no churches, no parliaments, no
  poverty, no idleness, not much disease, and in which nevertheless, men and
  women feel themselves no more than on the threshold of evolution. They are
  conscious of a past, by them referred to as the "Age of Confusion," in which
  conditions were about the same as those on our own world today; a past in
  which wars, disease, and competition were considered necessary. The author
  contrives to show the patient steps by which the Utopians escaped from the
  "Age of Confusion" and emerged into a truer civilization, not omitting to
  point out how slow and painstaking, as well as how worth while, the process
  necessarily must be.</p>

  <p>But therein lies the principal weakness of the author's argument. It is
  beside the issue to suggest that other men and other women might imagine an
  Utopia more to their liking; Mr. Wells has a perfect right to paint his own
  picture, and he has produced one well worth studying. But he has also
  emphasized the fact that it will take time &mdash; long, faithfully,
  successively devoted lifetimes &mdash; years reckoned by the thousand before
  we can arrive at the Utopia of his vision. He has discarded commonplace
  religious dogmas &mdash; those alleged incentives toward altruism that have
  done their full share in bringing our world to its present sorry predicament.
  But what incentive has he substituted? The tawdry old retort "what did
  posterity ever do for me," swinish though it is and repugnant to every man or
  woman possessed of a spark of the Divine Fire, disarms him entirely unless he
  has the truth unanswerable in reserve. (And that may well be. Mr. Wells is
  plowing, not teaching; he is getting the ground ready for the seed.)</p>

  <p class="headline">THE HEART-SATISFYING LOGIC OF REINCARNATION</p>

  <p>He shows us, wittily and with a skill that compels admiration, how we
  mortals might react to an environment too good for our present mental and
  spiritual development. The humor of the situation is immense when the
  'earthlings' &mdash; quarantined in a castle because they have brought
  disease with them to which the Utopians have long since ceased to be immune,
  the disease having vanished from their economy &mdash; proceed to try to
  conquer Utopia, relying partly on the disease they brought with them to
  weaken the ranks of their opponents. The speciousness with which the would-be
  conquerors justify themselves; the attitude of Hunker the American, who
  refuses to enter into an entangling alliance but is willing to help do the
  fighting and more than willing to share in the prospective profits; the
  insistence by Dupont, the Frenchman, that there must be "some guarantee, some
  effective guarantee, that the immense sacrifices France has made and still
  makes in the cause of civilized life, will receive their proper recognition
  and their due reward in this adventure," are all to the point; they emphasize
  the selfishness of the minds that must be changed before Utopia could be
  anything more than an excuse for new cruelty and conquest. They remind us of
  Pizarro and his conquistadores; of Bl&uuml;cher surveying London from the
  dome of St. Paul's saying "Was f&uuml;r Plunder!"; of Clive and Hastings and
  their swarm of followers "shaking the pagoda-tree"; of the Forty-niners
  tearing down the forests, wresting out the gold, and squandering the
  proceeds; of all the argonauts who ever saw a good thing and devoured it. Mr.
  Barnstaple's refusal to take part in the proposed conquest constitutes him,
  in the eyes of the others (the women included), a traitor to mankind. And
  that is all very marvelously drawn; probably no other pen than that of Wells
  could do it. But, except that he makes the reader sympathize, makes out no
  case against the proposed iniquity. The 'earthlings' are defeated by Utopian
  methods as drastic in their own way as those that the 'earthlings' had in
  mind to use. The result is merely the defeat of a lower materialism by one
  that is more intelligent and therefor possessed of more resources.</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnstaple, responding to a truly spiritual impulse, offers himself at
  last for experiment. The Utopians are to try to return him to earth; and they
  succeed. Mr. Barnstaple rejoins his family in the London suburb, possessed by
  a vision of Utopia and a hope for the redemption of the world. But on what is
  his hope based? The reader is left wondering how Mr. Barnstaple shall
  persuade the world to mend its ways, without any prospect to offer them that
  he who shall truly labor for the advancement of mankind shall inevitably see
  the consequences of his labor. It is easy enough to enjoy Mr. Wells' vision
  of Utopia, and to realize how Mr. Barnstaple must have been thrilled by it.
  But Mr. Barnstaple is a more than middle-aged man, who must die before long.
  The author leaves him helpless without the heart-satisfying logic of
  reincarnation on which to base his program of reform.</p>

  <p>If we accept the fact of reincarnation, Mr. Wells' vision of Utopia
  becomes a reasonable prospect, within reach, worth striving for, to be
  amended and improved as our imagination grows and we learn by experience. But
  if, when we die, we are dead and don't come back again, why all this plowing?
  Why not eat and drink, cease hoping and be done with it? There is, there must
  be, a tremendous faith, a knowledge, that makes Mr. Wells plow (and whistle)
  so sturdily. He would have done well had he intimated why evolution should be
  interesting to us all, how we are all a part of it, and how we are all
  inevitable gainers if we strive for posterity's benefit, because posterity is
  we ourselves.</p>

  <p class="headline">"LEGENDS OF SMOKEOVER"</p>

  <p>L.P. Jacks is Principal of Manchester College, Oxford, and Editor of "The
  Hibbert Journal". One may safely look to him, as to Wells, for a book that
  compels thinking. In The Legends of Smokeover, the most recent of eleven
  books, he has striven mightily to lift the world a little on an upward course
  and, unlike Wells, he more than hints at ways and means. He has written a
  delightful story, in which he seems to overrate the power of money to
  accomplish spiritual purposes &mdash; even as Wells appears to overrate the
  power of material comfort to produce a zeal for spiritual living &mdash; but
  he has brought out from the half-respect, to which the creeds have all
  conspired to relegate it, one of the splendid elements of human character;
  and his story contains two women who are really spiritual beings, blessing
  everyone and everything they touch. Withal, they are human, credible,
  likeable. And in the mouth of one of them he puts a question whose correct
  answer solves the whole riddle of the world's course out of its present
  tragic condition.</p>

  <p>The quality that L.P. Jacks has stressed and seeks to build upon is
  sportsmanship. By frequent instance he shows what sturdy stuff that is, how
  it persists in all layers of society, and how the practice of it comforts
  even those who are dying in agony. To all intents and purposes the author
  invites the world to 'take a chance,' perhaps a very long chance, for the
  benefit of all mankind; and he has come extremely close to true prophecy or,
  to coin a word, true seersmanship.</p>

  <p>The story is divided into five legends, the first of which concerns the
  rise to fortune of Rumbelow, the betting man. His birth is obscure, but in
  early youth he is the reputed son of a drunken rascal of that name, who goes
  the round of the country fairs with a Coco-nut Shy. At the age of ten the
  youth began his studies of the Doctrine of Probability, as the result of
  which he finally evolved a formula. The disreputable Rumbelow senior is
  conveniently killed, the boy takes over the Coco-nut Shy, sticks to his
  formula and makes a fortune, and for a while disappears from view. He is
  known to be traveling abroad, and it is hinted that he is acquiring an
  education.</p>

  <p>Here at once is the Achilles' heel of Mr. Jacks' whole argument. His story
  is an appeal to the world to wake up and be educated; he shows wittily and
  well how that splendid quality of sportsmanship inherent in most human beings
  is the educators' opportunity; but he does not point out who shall teach the
  educators, or where they shall derive the knowledge which shall redeem
  mankind. He shows us Rumebelow, the man of zeal, who is afraid of nothing,
  not even the Pharisees; Mr Lady, Rumbelows's wife, with whom he returns from
  his mysterious journey in quest of an education and who thereafter is his
  wise confederate, adviser, guide, and friend. We are introduced to the "Mad
  Millionaire," Mr. Hooker, who has Quaker principles but who is foisted into a
  war-fortune in spite of himself and howled at as a profiteer. Mr. Hooker with
  his millions becomes one of the syndicate of five who conspire to teach the
  world; and a charming old conspirator he is, possessing tact and modesty. We
  have Miss Margaret Walfstone, a born educator, almost too wise and delightful
  to be true, whose successful school for girls is wrecked through the spite of
  the reactionary element in Smokeover. And that part of the story is amazingly
  well told. The fourth legend concerns Professor Ripplemark, "Regius Professor
  of Virtue in the University of Oxford," a V.C. man, possessed of humor, who
  ultimately resigns his "Chair of Virtue" to become the fifth member of the
  board of conspirators.</p>

  <p>It is all very cleverly done, with such good humor and such earnestness
  that it is difficult to lay the book down once the first page is turned. The
  author has assembled five characters who convince themselves, and thus the
  reader, that the world must be educated out of its materialism. There is not
  a dull page in the book, nor a hint of pessimism. All that is lacking is the
  key. The reader is left wondering what this new education shall be all about,
  and whether the deadweight of Rumbelow's and Hooker's millions will not in
  any event prove to be more than the magnificent ideal can carry. From owning
  Coco-nut Shies Rumbelow proceeds until he is the proprietor of a titanic
  betting establishment which will work out mathematically and declare the odds
  on anything from a horse's chance to win a selling-plate to a clergyman's
  prospect of promotion to a bishopric. The firm even takes up insurance on a
  downright betting basis, naming the scientifically calculated odds and
  accepting wagers as to whether or not a house will burn down, whether or not
  a man will die before he shall have saved enough for his dependents. One
  suspects Mr. L.P. Jacks of deliberately poking fun at pious humbug, rather
  than of pretending that Rumbelow's fortune is acquired by desirable
  means.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Rumbelow, a most appealing character, grows fabulously rich,
  and he worships that mysterious wife of his, whom he insists on everyone
  addressing as "My lady." It is she who directs his titanic energy along the
  altruistic course, and she who voices the question whose proper answer shall
  solve the riddle of the world's unrest.</p>

  <p class="headline">"WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR?"</p>

  <p>Rumbelow's experience as a gambler convinces him that the universe is not
  governed at all. The relation of Spirit to the world, according to him, is
  that of a lover to his beloved &mdash; anything but the relation of a
  power-loving potentate to his subjects. Professor Ripplemark, confirming that
  opinion, adds that "teaching" is primary, "ruling" is secondary. Rumbelow
  adds to that again: "Government should be a department of education instead
  of education a department of government." It is on that platform that the
  five conspirators agree, Rumbelow adding that sportsmanship is a "bridge
  between time and eternity." Says he: "the sporting instinct is the easiest
  transformed into its spiritual equivalents." But it is "My Lady" who
  transforms that platform from a mere experiment in phrasing into a spiritual
  possibility with her quiet question, "Who is my neighbor?" When the men and
  women of the world wake up and realize that all of us are neighbors there
  will be no more need to strive to pin down spiritual thinking into formulas;
  then there will be no more poverty and no more war between the nations
  &mdash; incidentally no need for Mr. Rumbelow and his gigantic betting
  firm.</p>

  <p>But the fact that two such books as these by H.G. Wells and L.P. Jacks can
  command an audience is proof enough that the tide has turned. The world is
  waking up. Neither Wells nor Jacks has given us a satisfying reason why we
  should take seriously in hand the task of leaving behind us a world more fit
  for posterity to live in. Both speak of evolution as a fact. Neither of them
  shows how evolution is the intimate concern of all of us. But both have
  succeeded in showing by contrast and illustration how hugely better the world
  might be, and Jacks has hinted &mdash; hardly more than hinted &mdash; at the
  process by which transformation is to be accomplished.</p>

  <p>Who is my neighbor? The word is hardly intimate enough. We all are
  brothers. Change Wells' word "confederacy" into "Brotherhood," add Jacks'
  "spiritual equivalent of the sporting instinct," and we are not far from the
  Path blazed by Theosophy. For sportsmanship is a will to meet the other
  fellow more than half-way and a determination never to accept unfair
  advantage.</p>

  <p>But the underlying reason for the hope that rises eternal in the human
  breast, despite all the piled up horrors of materialism and the failure of
  all dogmas to provide more than a temporary anaesthetic, is the fair,
  heart-satisfying fact of Reincarnation, and of all-compensating Karma &mdash;
  fact that men know intuitively, and that springs forth as the clods of
  material delusion are broken up. The plowing is being well done. The seed is
  sown in secret. Let Theosophists not neglect its cultivation; for the weeds
  turned under by the plow persist interminably, and the one hope for the seed
  is to keep it growing.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, January 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">THE WORD "international" has come on evil days,
  inevitably, since it was adopted as a panacea. In its very origin it
  presupposes the existence of a barrier between the nations. Every
  international theory hitherto invented has stirred more rancor than it
  healed, sometimes by denying the obvious, more often by asserting the
  absurdly untrue, always by raising material standards, which by their very
  nature invite conflict of opinions. <i>Quot homines tot sententiae</i>.</p>

  <p>The so-called international control, set up by jealous governments to
  check the scramble for political advantage, resembles as much as anything a
  bandage wrapped around all the fingers of a hand, to prevent any one finger
  from acting independently; and the result is what might be expected &mdash;
  numbness and exasperation. Even international sports, conceived in the spirit
  of friendliness, develop into international rivalry, as instanced when an
  English crowd applauds the bad strokes of an American golfer, or an American
  crowd hisses an alien contestant &mdash; extreme instances, but neither rare
  nor on the wane.</p>

  <p>Material standards, of whatever kind, inevitably lead to quarreling and
  chaos, because the standards in themselves are false. And nothing can be
  gained by calling black white, or by taking the result of false premises and
  trying to force it into more convenient shape. Dame Partington trying to
  sweep back the Atlantic with a broom, was acting no more illogically than the
  nations, the classes, the mobs and the dogmatists who seem disposed to strive
  forever to offstand Karma. In fact, she was wiser than they; for she made her
  experiment on a scale on which her finite human mind might grasp the
  absurdity of the attempt.</p>

  <p>Truth is universal. Consequently all its proofs, if apparent at all, are
  universally apparent &mdash; as apparent in a bowl of water as in one drop of
  the same fluid or in an ocean. And it is easier for us to take the middle
  way, that our senses can grasp with least effort. There is no need to study
  drops under a microscope, or to sweep the vast expanse of the Pacific, in
  order to learn the elementary lessons of the Law. Its proofs, its
  demonstrations, its examples are all about us, in every move we make, in
  every sight we see, in every sound we hear. They always were; they always
  are; they always will be. There is no stage in our development as
  individuals, at which sufficient illustration of the Law as it applies to
  each one of us is not immediately at hand and comprehensible. It is
  impossible to invent a condition or a state of mind, out of which observance
  of the working of Universal Law can not, and will not, show a spirally
  progressive way.</p>

  <p>A simple illustration is that one of the bandaged fingers. Loose them and
  the brain, which has no apparent connection with them, controls them
  separately; but each finger serves the hand, the hand the arm, the arm the
  man, the man his fellows, his fellows the world &mdash; and so on, up to
  heights beyond our present comprehension. The absurdity appears at once of
  any jealousy between the fingers or between the left hand and the right; yet
  it is no more absurd than international rivalry. The same law applies in
  either instance.</p>

  <p>The United States' Declaration of Independence declares that all men are
  born free and equal; and that is a sturdy and honest effort to express a
  profound interpretation of the Universal Law. But to misinterpret that into
  the assumption that all men have the same grade of intelligence, that the
  same food, the same work, or even the same creed must suit all of them, that
  they all have the same ability, must speak the same language; that their
  immediate interests are all identical &mdash; would be, and is, as absurd as
  to say that they all experience the same weather and that the sun shines on
  all of them at once.</p>

  <p>The fact is that, whatever their degree of present attainment, the same
  Universal Law applies to each, and that the possibilities for each and every
  one are absolutely limitless &mdash; beginning at the point at which he is,
  and progressing infinitely. The goal of us all is ineffable harmony. But to
  try to attain that harmony by preaching materialist theories of
  internationalism resembles the advice of the man on one side of a deep chasm
  to a stranger on the other side:</p>

  <p>"Jump. I think you will make it in two jumps!"</p>

  <p>We are confronted by conditions. We are governed by unalterable Law.
  Knowledge is the proof of Law; wisdom its application. Theories of
  internationalism, being based on local points of view, can accomplish no more
  than to reduce all nations to one dead-level of suppression, leading
  ultimately to explosion more terrific than the outbursts of Vesuvius &mdash;
  matter seeking to imprison force.</p>

  <p>It is Universal Law that makes possible the playing of Beethoven's magic
  compositions by orchestra of a hundred pieces. To compel the first and second
  violins to use their bows simultaneously, would accomplish a result as futile
  in degree, and in its way, as any effort to bind the nations in one man-
  governed league. It is enough, and difficult enough, that nations should
  govern themselves; and they will never attain harmony by all striving to be
  first violins. Order is attained by listening, self-government, and work; and
  not by listening to the next piece in the orchestra but to the universal
  symphony.</p>

  <p>An illustration comes to mind from memory. On a night in the Ituri Forest
  in the Congo Free State, many years before the recent world-war, there met
  more than a dozen men of different nations in one of those great clearings
  made by the Forest Administration, into which paths led from every direction,
  and in which travelers might pitch their tents. It was a bright oasis in a
  gloomy wilderness of trees so dense as to be impenetrable except along the
  paths, two meters wide, that threaded the forest like the filaments of a
  gigantic spider's web.</p>

  <p>The men met quite by accident. There was a German grand-duke with a
  Prussian friend and a Bavarian non-commissioned officer; a Swiss merchant;
  two Roman Catholic priests, one a Hollander, the other a Portuguese; two
  Belgians with a handcuffed Greek prisoner; an Englishman; an Italian; a man
  whose identity remained in doubt, but who might have been a Lithuanian or
  Russian; an American big-game hunter suffering badly from malaria; and one or
  two others, including an East-Indian trader, whose names and nationalities I
  have forgotten.</p>

  <p>We met on territory then being administered by Belgium, subject to an
  international treaty expressly devised for the protection of the natives and
  to prevent rival nations from coming to blows for possession of the rich,
  then hardly explored area. The only discoverable points of agreement between
  the various nationals assembled in that oasis were, that the natives were
  being cruelly exploited rather than protected; that war undoubtedly would
  come for the possession of the so-called Free State; and that, whatever local
  laws there might be, any man with brains and sufficient lack of scruple might
  break them with impunity.</p>

  <p>The latter subject of conversation was brought up by contemplation of the
  Greek prisoner, who boasted openly to his captors that he had sufficient
  influence of the right sort to procure his release, no matter what the
  evidence against him, and he more than hinted that the influence was
  international, to be brought to bear through more than one legation. However,
  for the time being, he was a helpless and a pitiable prisoner, with red sores
  where the handcuffs chafed his wrists.</p>

  <p>The whole company was at loggerheads. The German grand-duke and his friend
  were suspected of political intrigue and kept themselves as much aloof as
  possible. One of the Belgians was an atheist and took malicious satisfaction
  in offending the two priests. The East-Indian trader was regarded by all and
  sundry as an unfair competitor. The Belgians came in for pointed criticism as
  the uniformed representatives of misgovernment, and naturally replied in
  kind. Hardly any three were on speaking terms; and the Congo native, who had
  charge of the clearing, was thrashed by the Italian for giving the Germans'
  orders precedence. There were all the makings of an international "incident,"
  when the Greek prisoner produced his flute.</p>

  <p>For hours after that, the stars looked down through the circle of
  tree-tops in the midst of those leagues of forest on a scene that illustrated
  almost perfectly the difference between the working of Universal, as opposed
  to international Law.</p>

  <p>The Greek was a musician &mdash; so excellent a musician that his captors,
  who were afraid of him, removed his handcuffs, and he played, after the first
  five minutes, with two rifles pointed at him over the knees of guards who
  leaned their backs against trees to listen in comfort. At the end of ten
  minutes not a man was sulking in his tent; everyone came out into the open
  and lay, or sat, or sprawled, in a semi-circle around the Greek. The night
  became full of eyes, as the natives who had fled from the clearing to avoid
  contact with the terrifying white men crept back to swell the audience. And
  the Greek played Chopin, Mozart, Handel &mdash; until the very night seemed
  full of exquisite music, and he ceased, after hours of it, from physical
  exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Followed proof of what he had accomplished; laughter in place of snarling
  ill-humor. He had changed an international tragedy into a chapter of the
  Universal comedy &mdash; he, who stood charged with atrocious crimes and who
  needed to brag lest his own unlawful hope should perish in him. Men had
  forgotten their evening meal, and mutual dislike along with it; now they made
  common contributions to a bivouac-feast, although none could have told who
  proposed that. Conversation, once begun on that new basis, lasted until the
  stars grew pale in the morning sky; and when day dawned, all went their
  separate ways with at least the feeling that they had lost nothing by the ebb
  and flow of good-will with their fellow men.</p>

  <p>So works the Universal Law; and nothing less than that can ever overcome
  the international inharmonies. Whatever presupposes separateness leads to
  separation and to selfishness and all the strife inevitably consequent on
  that. The universal, presupposing nothing, since it includes all truth,
  unites all life in the limitless scope of evolution, playing no favorites,
  excluding none. The Path lies straight ahead. The guides, the illustrations,
  the examples, are so near that they can not possibly escape us, if we
  look.</p>

  <p>Therefore we, members of this Theosophical Peace Congress, may in
  confidence pursue our efforts to establish universal permanent Peace</p>

     name="ref11">"MOTHER NATURE"</a><br>
  <small>A REVIEW OF A BOOK BY WILLIAM J. LONG</small></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, February 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">WIDELY known though Mr. Long already is, his books
  deserve to be much more widely read and to be translated into other
  languages. He writes well. The truth is in him. And he is as sweetly
  reasonable as the processes of natural law, which he has observed, and which
  he justifies as against the "ferocious, red-with-ravin conception of a Nature
  that shrieks against human and divine love."</p>

  <p>He proves his case (and Emerson's), that as men go forth into the field
  each sees his own mood dressed in fur or feathers, constructing for himself a
  philosophy of nature, tender or savage, out of his own reflexion. There are
  faults that can be found with Mr. Long's book, from the standpoint of
  Theosophy, but they are faults of omission, in no sense due to his
  observation or to any lack of it, but solely to the absence of that
  underlying recognition of the law of cause and effect, which Theosophy alone
  supplies. Mr. Long, for many years past, has gone forth into the wilds at
  intervals as an observer, armed with neither gun nor stupid sentiment, but
  with appreciation, which is a key to apprehension; with curiosity restrained
  by that important quality, good manners; and with sportsmanship, which has
  nothing whatever to do with trophy-hunting, cruelty, or contempt. His book
  could, consequently, not be other than a notable achievement.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most outstanding thought in the mind of this reviewer after
  turning the last page of <i>Mother Nature</i> is, that manners maketh
  animals, as well as man. If ever a man in clear and thoughtful printed page
  described -and it may be without intending exactly that &mdash; the
  generosity and <i>courtesy</i> of nature, Mr. Long has done it. And it
  follows that of course &mdash; and this he set himself to do &mdash; he has
  left the 'red-with-ravin' school, the supporters of the insane and pitiless
  'competition' and 'survival of the fittest' theory, without a leg to stand on
  or an argument that is not proved ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Co-operation, not competition, is the secret of all nature, and the sooner
  man learns that the better. It is the answer to the very riddle of the
  Sphinx. Wherever and whenever man has co-operated with the trees, streams,
  rocks, and animals, he has lost nothing, but has gained immeasureably.</p>

  <p>It is man the destroyer, the upsetter, the unbalancer, the ravenous,
  hasty, inconsiderate, ill-mannered 'profiteer,' who sees cruelty wherever he
  looks; because cruelty is in his heart, and the cause and its effect are
  one.</p>

  <p class="headline">COOPERATION IS INSTINCTIVE</p>

  <p>The first of the unanswerable indictments that Mr. Long brings against the
  alleged observers of facts who uphold the orthodoxy of the
  competition-theory, is that they do not observe. They study beasts in cages;
  or, if they do go afield, it is in the firm conviction that all nature is
  "red in tooth and claw." They are determined beforehand to prove the
  comparatively recent (as Nature would reckon it), mainly occidental, wholly
  illogical theory that only the swiftest and strongest can survive. The
  weakest and most defenseless animals and birds are much the more numerous
  everywhere &mdash; so are the weakest and most defenseless men! &mdash; and
  the beasts of prey are as rare, but far more reasonable, than the two-gun
  ruffians, who murder wayfarers, but this self-evident fact is one that the
  'observers' of so-called scientific laws unaccountably, and yet almost
  unanimously, seem to have agreed to overlook.</p>

  <p>Co-operation is instinctive because instinct is the reflexion (on the
  lower plane) of intuition, which is the means of communication on the higher.
  Day and night, the planets in their courses, the myriad suns in the surge of
  the Milky Way, are not at war. Seasons follow seasons and relieve each other.
  Life and death are alternating phases in an endless evolution, whose first
  quality is mercy, whose first law is that all things shall co-operate, atom
  and earth and constellation, in one sublime, whole, interrelating Universe.
  Intuition knows this; instinct reflects the knowledge. It is easy to read
  reverence between the lines of Mr. Long's book. This is a man who has felt
  himself a part of one inseparable vastness, and has felt the urge of
  Brotherhood toward everything that lives. So he naturally has no use for the
  Malthusian theory of struggle, which, as he says, Darwin borrowed, while (to
  use his words) all "nature stands ready to produce abundance so soon as men
  cease from strife and follow her universal law." He speaks of human
  competition as "unholy doctrine," practising which, man is put to shame by
  the very "beasts that perish." For their ways are not our ways.</p>

  <p>It may be that Mr. Long had never heard of Katherine Tingley's
  R&acirc;ja-Yoga College when he wrote this book, and if so, one of his
  paragraphs is all the more worth quoting:</p>

  <p class="quote">"We send our little children to school, children who are
  natural comrades, and there set them to working for rewards, marks, honors,
  prizes &mdash; for every empty and worthless bubble that shall foster a
  spirit of rivalry. Even our games feel the artificial curse, for we no longer
  play to enjoy but play to win. The instinct of children still leads them to
  play, as birds and animals all play, for conscious pleasure and unconscious
  bodily training; but ... there is hardly a game left in our schools or
  colleges which has not been divorced from its true function of giving
  pleasure to the player and wedded to the lake ideal of winning over
  rivals."</p>

  <p>Which is one of the evils of modern education against which Katherine
  Tingley raised her standard and has kept it raised now for a quarter of a
  century. The more such men as Mr. Long go forth to observe, and the more
  fearlessly they write, the more clearly will appear the wisdom, genius, and
  inspiration with which Katherine Tingley laid the sane foundation of her
  system of education.</p>

  <p>Mr. Long (himself a Christian minister) points out how timidly the
  theologians "murmur something about the harshness of nature as a foil for the
  tenderness of divine grace, not perceiving that nature and grace are two
  words of the same revelation"; and he goes on to say that "it is as certain
  as anything can be that grace could have found no welcome or lodgment on
  earth had not nature prepared the way for the gentle guest." He quotes even
  Calvin, the creed-bound, the believer in eternal hell, who in a moment of
  illumination wrote: "With reverence may this be said, that God and nature are
  one." The remainder of the book is mainly an illuminating series of
  observations, set down with restraint and without tendency to dogmatize, in
  support of that statement of Calvin's, which no more gibes with his
  "predestined to damnation" theory than does the practise of vivisection
  comply with the teaching of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>The natural peace and trustfulness of animals is amply proved by the
  records of all explorers who have observed what is generally described as
  'game' in natural surroundings before man has had opportunity to terrorize.
  Left to themselves animals multiply and are almost fearless; and they will
  live alongside man, giving him all the room he needs, doing their necessary
  share in maintaining the 'balance of nature,' if man will only let them. Nor
  is it true that man needs the 'product' of wild animals, nor that he can use
  that product profitably, at all events in any such quantity as to justify the
  slaughter that continues yearly. Man-invented, unnatural demand for fur and
  feathers, kept up and increased by the unhealthy competition and feverish
  selfishness of cities, is not only causing whole species of animals and birds
  to become extinct but is breeding the spirit of war and annihilation. The
  theory that animals must disappear, mercilessly exterminated, as civilization
  advances is the same infernal doctrine that declares that weak nations must
  give waq7 before the stronger. And that is the whole theory of war.</p>

  <p>If man would observe the animals and learn from them, he would soon
  discover that practically all the accepted notions about them are totally
  wrong. Most of our books on natural history have been written by men who shot
  an animal before trying to become acquainted with it, and whose nearest
  approach to genuine study of a living beast was through the bars of a cage.
  It is true, there have been others, and today there is William Beebe, with
  his observation-post at the edge of the jungle in British Guiana, honestly
  observing and most delightfully writing what he knows; but for the most part,
  with the exception of the so-called scientific treatises turned out from
  laboratories in the name of biology, our information about wild life comes
  from men who have regarded animals as prey, and have hunted them either for
  profit or from a perverted sense of sport. It is from such sources that the
  economists have drawn their 'facts,' so that we find Mill deducing that
  nature is a chaos of struggling beasts, accepting the cruelty of the natural
  world as an axiom, and trying to teach us (too often, too successfully!) to
  pattern our own 'struggle for existence' on the same imagined lines.</p>

  <p>John Stuart Mill was not alone in that egregious error. Huxley and a host
  of others made the mistake of taking alleged facts on faith and picturing a
  universe at war against itself, rending and tearing in a fiendish struggle to
  survive. Nine-tenths of nineteenth-century philosophy is based on gross
  misstatements, due to the confusion of dead carcases with living nature in
  the minds of men who saw to what a pass the world was coming and sought to
  justify economic warfare by contending that nature sets the example. The only
  trouble with their teaching is, that nature does nothing of the kind.</p>

  <p>To quote Mr. Long again:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The incredible thing is that you may search the 11brary
  from top to bottom without finding anything to indicate that any preacher of
  this degrading superstition of a terror-governed natural world has ever taken
  a single summer or winter to live peaceably among wild birds and beasts, to
  see with his own eyes just how they live, and to judge for himself what
  spirit governs them as they work and play, win their mates, protect their
  offspring, and seek food for themselves and their little ones."</p>

  <p class="headline">ASK NOW THE BEASTS AND THEY WILL TEACH THEE</p>

  <p>The book is full of paragraphs that are almost irresistible to quote,
  because Mr. Long has done exactly what the 'naturalists' have so seldom done.
  He has gone, looked, listened, used intelligence, and he is able to hear a
  morning hymn in the music of the birds at dawn, that shows how glad they are
  to be alive; whereas the man with a gun or bird-lime can think of them only
  as potential dead specimens. Death, that comes to animals and birds as
  inevitably as to men, is kindly and not cruel, except where men have
  interfered with nature, bringing perverted dogs, guns and traps into the
  wilderness.</p>

  <p>One of Mr. Long's most illuminating experiences is that of taking a 'bad
  boy' into the wilds with him. By upsetting himself and the boy out of a canoe
  into the water he contrived to lose the boy's gun, with the result that the
  boy had to live next to nature without unnatural machinery for doing harm.
  Mr. Long turned him loose in the woods without a word of advice, trusting
  nature to do all needful preaching to the boy's own instincts. Several times
  that summer the boy (unarmed) met bears and other wild beasts face to face
  and it was not long, after his first fright or two were over, before he
  became silent and companionable, unconsciously copying the harmony around
  him.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Then we began to watch the wood-folk with desire to learn
  something of their ways the rabbit that tried to frighten us by thumping the
  ground at our heels, the bull moose that stared at our passing canoe, the
  tiny warbler that nested by our tent, and the big owl that we called from his
  cedar swamp to hoot around our camp-fire. There was no preaching, no
  moralizing, nothing but nature's unobtrusive lesson; pet before the summer
  was over there was no more regret for the lost guns, and no further
  disposition to interfere with our wild neighbors."</p>

  <p>And, as has been pointed out elsewhere on good authority, men do not
  gather figs from thistles. If nature were bloodthirsty, an incorrigible boy
  could hardly learn gentle manliness from living face to face with her. Who
  has not witnessed the improvement that takes place in boys who have a chance
  to learn from undomesticated animals?</p>

  <p class="headline">STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS UNNATURAL</p>

  <p>Nature is spontaneously joyous, and it is only man's attempt to justify
  his own unnatural habits and excitements by reading into nature what is not
  there that has produced the crass fiction on which so-called scientific
  theories have been built, and which nowadays it appears to be heresy not to
  believe. Mr. Long's remarks on animals at play could be enormously amplified
  by the present writer and hosts of others, from experience. All young
  creatures, from young elephants to young mice, are playful as soon as they
  have strength enough to carry their own weight; greed is the exception, not
  the rule in nature; few wild animals will gorge themselves, or eat one
  fragment more than is good for them, although in a state of captivity, having
  nothing else to do, some of them become gluttons. And even the big cats,
  lions, tigers, leopards and so on restrict their killing to what they
  actually need, often &mdash; very often &mdash; going several days in
  succession without hunting.</p>

  <p>All so-called big game is dangerous when attacked by man, but only very
  rarely meddlesome if left alone &mdash; curious, yes; interested in the human
  stranger, yes; but 'treacherous' or pugnacious, so seldom that if men would
  only take example from them the world might then be reckoned safe and
  peaceable! Here is a personal experience in confirmation: on one occasion
  five lions investigated my tent at about ten o'clock at night, in a wild
  district of what was then called German East Africa. The tent was so small
  that it was impossible to move without touching some portion of it, so it was
  impossible to bring a loaded rifle into play without betraying movement.
  There was nothing to do but lie still and 'sham dead.' The lions sniffed all
  around the tent, and could not possibly have been ignorant that a man was in
  there, for their sense of smell is remarkably keen; at the end of a few
  minutes one of them roared, which &mdash; contrary to usual belief -is not an
  indication of ill temper, but the reverse; thereafter, for ten or fifteen
  minutes, they engaged in rough horseplay, rolling over and biting one another
  like puppies, and the only danger to me was that they might have upset the
  tent, when my own state of panic would undoubtedly have caused serious
  trouble. In the end they scampered off and I was able to catch sight of them;
  one was a full-grown lion, and the others, judging by a glimpse and by their
  foot-prints, were almost fully grown. Nor was that a fundamentally
  exceptional experience.</p>

  <p>Mr. Long, in his book, confines himself to his own experiences on the
  North-American continent, and rightly so; but he deserves to be supported by
  actual evidence from Africa and Asia because, if his contentions are in the
  main correct, as this writer believes, they must apply everywhere and not to
  one continent only. His remarks on wolves are especially enlightening,
  although those, too, might be greatly amplified, and it does not seem to have
  occurred to him that the howl of wolves, so often spoken of with dread by
  'tenderfeet' and written about sensationally by authors who have never heard
  it, is nothing more or less than music. Lawrence Trimble, who probably knows
  wolves more intimately than any other man alive today, describes it as the
  wolves' 'evening hymn,' and I have seen him persuade a pack of wolves to
  howl, by sitting down near to them and rendering a wolf solo so perfectly
  that they could not resist the inclination to sing the chorus. They throw up
  their heads, throw their very souls into the music, and usually engage in
  rough-and-tumble play directly afterwards. Lions behave in the same way; when
  they are roaring, and particularly when they roar in chorus, they are never
  'up to mischief' but full of life, strength, and contentment.</p>

  <p>Lawrence Trimble recently was at great pains, when in Canada, to discover
  an authenticated instance of a man having been attacked by wolves. He heard
  plenty of blood-curdling tales in the cities, fewer in the smaller towns,
  none in the villages, and in the outlying cabins and places where men
  <i>know</i> wolves his questions were laughed at. The fact is that not even a
  starving timber-wolf will attack a man except in self-defense.</p>

  <p>A recent East-Indian census gives the number of human beings killed by
  wolves in one year as about 380. That is out of a human population of three
  hundred and twenty-five million people. The percentage is simply
  insignificant; a far greater percentage of people (to the total population)
  die on railroad crossings in the United States, or at the hands of
  'civilized' murderers; and it is noteworthy that nothing whatever is said in
  that census as to how the human beings came to be killed &mdash; whether or
  not, for instance, they were hunting the wolves.</p>

  <p>The same argument applies to snakes, which are among the very best friends
  of the agriculturists, but are regarded with horror by nearly all writers of
  fiction. In India, in any one year, the number of people killed by snake-bite
  averages about 35,000, which is so small in proportion to the number who die
  of plague, or cholera, or of knife-wounds o r in proportion to the number who
  die in the United States of diseases directly brought on by vice &mdash; that
  comparison becomes ridiculous. Most of those deaths by snake-bite are
  admitted to be due to carelessness, and another considerable proportion of
  them are due to cruelty attempted on the snakes. Beyond any doubt whatever,
  the snakes, on the other hand, preserve the lives of <i>millions</i> of
  people by reducing the number of rats, mice, and insects.</p>

  <p>I have traveled in India from Bombay to the Himalayas, and along the base
  of the Himalayas into Assam; all up the east coast of Australia; the whole
  length of Africa, and the whole breadth of that continent from Mombasa to
  Boma, in every instance living in a tent almost all the time, and penetrating
  into places where snakes and wild animals were practically the only
  population. I was only once attacked by a snake &mdash; a python; and I would
  not be willing to take oath that the python actually did attack. I could
  count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I have been attacked by
  any wild animal whatever, when the animal did not receive first provocation;
  one of those was a so-called 'rogue' elephant, mad with pain from disease at
  the base of his tusk; one was a rhinoceros, that bore the marks of previous
  bullet-wounds and consequently had the right to regard man with more than
  suspicion; one was a female buffalo, whose calf had strayed, so that I was
  between her and the calf; and the other was a man-eating lion, diseased and
  decrepit from old age, and about on a par, as to normality, with one of those
  dope-fed gangsters who make life in American cities dangerous.</p>

  <p>The number of times I have been close to 'dangerous' wild animals without
  really being in the slightest danger from them is beyond computation, for I
  made a practice for years of getting as close as I possibly could to every
  species I could find. Without qualification I endorse Mr. Long's affirmation
  that wild animals in natural conditions are less dangerous and less
  treacherous than the human inhabitants of cities &mdash; that is, head for
  head. There are, of course, exceptions, and wherever the balance of nature
  has been disturbed it is usually profitable not to take unnecessary
  risks.</p>

  <p>The whole question is closely related in its essence to the problem of
  disarmament. The supply of deadly weapons and the theory that the other
  fellow has nefarious intentions psychologize the situation. The false but
  persistently inculcated teaching that nature is cruel and that all existence
  is a struggle of the strong against the weak, produces in the human mind a
  savagery that has no legitimate excuse. When it is once understood that
  Nature is merciful and considerate of the weak, and that any exceptions to
  that law are due to unnatural and therefore remediable circumstances, a
  decidedly wholesome change in human conduct is bound to follow.</p>

  <p class="headline">IT IS MAN, NOT NATURE, WHO IS CRUEL</p>

  <p>It is true that a certain small percentage of animals live by killing.
  Their supply of natural food is in many instances so reduced by the
  unnecessary ravages of man that they have to become sheep-killers or else
  starve; and having once killed sheep they would be more than human if they
  did not continue to follow the line of least resistance and repeat the
  process indefinitely; but it is the wanton destruction by man of the herds of
  deer and smaller 'game' that diverts them in the first instance from their
  natural habits. And there ends the whole case against the predatory animals.
  For in no case are their methods cruel. Mr. Long's contention is amply
  supported by the evidence of such well-known explorers as Livingstone and
  Selous, and very many others, whose unanimous verdict is that some kind of
  hypnosis accompanies the attack of wild animals; and although its cause may
  be a question on which scientists and those who have experienced it differ,
  its result is invariably the same &mdash; stupor, in which neither pain nor
  distress are felt. My own experience in that respect is limited to a single
  instance, of having been knocked down and stunned by a charging elephant;
  there was no pain, and not even a headache afterwards. But I have talked with
  at least a dozen men who have been mauled by 'big game' -one of them was
  tossed by a 'rhino' and had nearly every bone in his body broken, but
  survived &mdash; and every one of them assured me that at the time of the
  attack there was no pain. One man, who was badly torn by a lion, felt no pain
  for several hours afterwards, and in no single instance did pain begin to be
  felt for several minutes; it was usually more than half-an-hour. . Bearing in
  mind that when a lion kills its prey the business is over in less than thirty
  seconds, it becomes evident that nature's methods are not unmerciful; and
  there is certainly no comparison between a swift and painless death in that
  form and the lingering torture of a steel trap, such as professional hunters
  set by the thousand, or the agony of wounds caused by badly aimed bullets.
  The number of men who can invariably kill their animal with one shot is very
  small indeed, and a great many animals escape, to perish miserably, hiding
  away in thickets until their wounds stiffen and mortification sets in.</p>

  <p class="headline">DO ANIMALS FEEL PAIN?</p>

  <p>There is only one chapter in Mr. Long's book to which exception can be
  taken. True, he leaves the answer to his question open, but he takes the
  attitude that it is impossible to prove whether or not animals feel pain in
  any circumstances, and he seems rather to incline to the opinion that they do
  not. However, if it were true that they do not feel pain, then practically
  the whole of the rest of his contention must go by the board; for what would
  be the objection to wounding an animal that was incapable of suffering?</p>

  <p>It is difficult to imagine how such an otherwise intelligent and careful
  observer should persuade himself even to temporize with any such conclusion -
  unless he adopts the formula of a certain latter-day sect, who maintain that
  pain has no real existence. But if all pain is imaginary, human beings
  nonetheless imagine it, and suffer. How exempt animals? What is the
  difference, except in terms of metaphysical abstraction, between pain and
  acute suffering endured in the imagination?</p>

  <p>None of Mr. Long's arguments in this chapter will bear analysis. He cites
  an instance of a pampered pet-dog that yelled, imagining itself hurt, and ran
  off perfectly satisfied after a few words of encouragement. But who has not
  seen a child, or even a grown man, behave in the same way? And is that proof
  that pain does not exist?</p>

  <p>He admits that animals feel pleasure. How can that be possible, unless
  they are equally capable of feeling pleasure's opposite? If they cannot feel
  pain, how do they learn to avoid things that would otherwise injure them?
  What is it, if not pain, that enrages them if struck? It is probably right to
  suppose that an animal's consciousness, of pain or pleasure, is far removed
  from that of a human being; but it is nonetheless consciousness, based on
  sensation and capable of two extremes.</p>

  <p>Animals undoubtedly do not feel pain when killed in the natural way by
  beasts of prey, because of that provision of nature which induces stupor in
  the moment of attack; but whoever has witnessed the behavior of an animal
  caught by the leg in a steel trap must either admit that the agony is
  atrocious, or else deny that sensation exists for himself or any other
  creature. it is mere equivocation to assert that what the animal feels is
  something different from what humans feel. That may be true. But pain by any
  other name would be as cruel; and the man who will willingly inflict it is a
  fiend there is no politer name for him.</p>

  <p>The vivisectionists will doubtless hail with glee this chapter of Mr.
  Long's. They will quote him as favoring their abominable practices, although
  he is careful to assure the reader that he holds no brief for them. It would
  be incredible, if it were not there in bold print, that such a warm-hearted
  and appreciative observer of Mother Nature should limp so lamely to a
  half-conclusion.</p>

  <p>Wherein lies nature's kindness, that he set out to establish and so amply
  seems to prove, if what is called unkindness should cause no suffering? It is
  this very blindness to the sufferings of others that leads to all cruelty and
  all war; and it would be just as logical to assert that because they talk a
  different language and we cannot feel what they feel, therefore the enemy's
  wounded feel no pain and their mothers experience no anguish, as it is to
  maintain that trapped animals, or vivisected animals, do not suffer.
  Fortunately, however, that identical argument would destroy the
  vivisectionist's case; because a very large percentage of the experiments on
  living animals are made for the express purpose of discovering what effect
  pain has on them, and therefore, if they feel no pain, those experiments are
  useless.</p>

  <p>The truth is that, left to herself, Mother Nature provides full and
  merciful means for the process of evolution that has been continuing for
  countless myriads of years. Death comes to us all naturally in due course,
  and the same Universal Law that governs the constellations takes care of men
  &mdash; and animals. It is only when man, with perverted imagination and a
  callousness born of lust, ignores the Law and tries to set up new rules for
  himself, that the balance of nature becomes disturbed and consequences
  (Karma) supervene that may take centuries on centuries to readjust
  themselves.</p>

  <p>The only remedy is Brotherhood, and Brotherhood is universal &mdash; or
  else make-believe. The only time to begin to apply the remedy is now. Harm
  done in the past, and injuries inflicted, cannot be undone. But the process
  of inflicting injury can cease, and must begin with individuals. It is
  obvious to anyone at all conversant with Theosophy, that even if it could be
  proved beyond dispute that vivisection of animals would lead to the total
  elimination of disease, the price would be too heavy to pay for the result.
  The cowardice of vivisection is its worst feature. Its effect on those who
  practise it and, indirectly, on those who profess to benefit from its
  practice is worse, because it is moral, than the actual physical cruelty
  inflicted on the helpless animals. And the consequences cannot be escaped;
  ultimately they will rebound on the human race, that must account sooner or
  later for all its actions. Justice is inevitable, and is not confined within
  the limits of one human lifetime.</p>

  <p>I once heard the whole argument for vivisection compressed into a sentence
  by a Cornish fisherman, who was skinning eels alive. They were squirming
  horribly, and I protested. The fisherman looked at me with honest blue eyes,
  shifted his pipe to the other corner of his mouth, went on with the skinning
  and answered:</p>

  <p>"Lor' bless ye, boy, they <i>like</i> it!"</p>

  <p>The whole argument against vivisection and all un-brotherhood was summed
  up centuries ago (and by no means for the first time then) in the advice to
  "do unto others as ye would they should do unto you." And the voice of
  Eternity, as clear as the cry of the birds and the music of wind in the trees
  and the laughing of water, says: "Both ways lie before you. Choose and take
  the consequences." Meanwhile, Mr. Long's book <i>Mother Nature</i> is a good
  one and a great advance on the usual method of writing so-called natural
  history.</p>

     name="ref12">MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, March 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">JUSTICE, according to Xenophon,* was defined by
  Socrates as "knowledge of what is due to man." There is no other recorded
  instance of Socrates having committed himself to definitions, his purpose
  having been to show what things are not, rather than to limit the boundaries
  of what they might turn out to be if men would only apply themselves to the
  discovery. However, as far as it goes, the definition will serve well enough
  as a guide toward correct conclusions, and injustice, accordingly, might
  better be defined as ignorance of what is due by man to every living
  creature.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Xenophon</i> (430?-355? BCE) &mdash; a Greek
  soldier and writer. A disciple of Socrates, he joined Cyrus the Younger in an
  attack on Persia. After the death of Cyrus, Xenophon led the Greek troops to
  the Black Sea, an ordeal he recounted in "Anabasis." <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/48/X0004800.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon</a>. ]</p>

  <p>There are a great many grades of ignorance, some wilful, some inherited,
  some due to sheer stupidity, and some that are the consequence of evil habits
  which have so corrupted thought that even temporary good intentions fail to
  disperse the mists of prejudice. The effect of ignorance is inevitably
  disastrous, unless knowledge can by some means be brought to the rescue.</p>

  <p>Mere sentimentalism fails; and mock heroics masquerading as reforming zeal
  serve only to increase with a cloud of hypocrisy the evils at which they
  profess to be aimed. Mere appetite for knowledge to be used for personal
  advancement, being itself only a form of ignorance, is worse than useless in
  the effort that must certainly be made to lift the world from the state of
  ignorance into which it has fallen.</p>

  <p>Injustice and ignorance go hand-in-hand invariably, and their result is a
  degenerating and self-propagating state of selfishness that descends from bad
  to worse, until it becomes so insupportable that nations wilt as from
  disease. As far back as we have any historical records, the invariable rule
  has been that nations which ignored the principle of justice have reaped
  want, revolution, and dishonor. No nation has ever become great, or sustained
  its greatness, except by adhering to the highest standards of justice of
  which it was capable. No armies and no fleets since history began have
  availed for long to enforce injustice; nor have all the votes of all the
  electors of any country succeeded in advancing the common prosperity one step
  when the majority opinion has been unjust.</p>

  <p>There are plenty of instances where ignorant majorities, with dust thrown
  in their eyes by those who believe they can profit by injustice, have agreed
  to enforce laws and penalties which favored this or that adroitly organized
  minority; but there is no instance where the process has succeeded
  permanently. Despoiled and despised crowds have a way of waking suddenly and
  transferring the spoils and the scorn to other recipients. Thus ignorance
  proceeds from bad to worse, injustice finding no remedy by merely making an
  exchange of victims.</p>

  <p>As great an effort as ever has been made on the material plane to relegate
  injustice to oblivion was heralded by the famous phrase "all men are born
  free and equal." Regarded as an effort, an expression of intention, it was
  admirable, but there are probably few who pretend that much proof of its
  truth has been forthcoming. There are many who can point to daily, hourly
  evidence that seems to prove the contrary.</p>

  <p>The phrase has been explained to mean equality of opportunity. But are
  there any who will venture to assert, as a result of actual observation, that
  equality of opportunity exists anywhere in the world today? Conceding that
  the United States stands alone in advance of all nations in the exercise of
  justice, is it true, for instance, that the poor man enjoys equal opportunity
  with the rich before the courts? Is it true that the sons of the poor enjoy
  the same opportunity to be educated as the sons of the rich? Is it true, to
  take another instance, that a teacher of Theosophy is as immune from
  persecution as, say, a politician who advocates international mistrust and
  rivalry?</p>

  <p>From what, then, are all men free? And to what are they equal? The great
  nations &mdash; great, that is, in wealth and armaments &mdash; exclude the
  weaker nations from an equal voice in international affairs; big business
  crowds smaller business out of existence; big political organizations
  suppress individual liberties; men with big brains and no squeamishness mock
  law by its manipulation for their private profit. Are men or women free from
  tyranny, robbery, blackmail, prejudice, oppression, violence, libel, slander?
  And if not, why?</p>

  <p>There are laws beyond count &mdash; so many laws that nobody pretends to
  exact knowledge of more than a small proportion of them. It is evident that
  the greater the number of laws, the greater the opportunity becomes for
  clever men to perpetrate injustice, and for rascals to enrich themselves. Yet
  there are few who will pretend that in the aggregate the intention of those
  who elect the law-makers is not to provide equality of opportunity for all.
  The intention fails; all over the world it has failed so dismally that more
  than one nation has repudiated democratic government and has submitted to a
  dictatorship. Nevertheless, not even those dictators will pretend there is no
  miscarriage of justice in the countries they control. They have contrived to
  organize intolerance and to make injustice function profitably for a while.
  They have made material efficiency a goal, without attaining it; but have
  they even attempted to provide all men with equal opportunity?</p>

  <p>To what are we all equal, or were born equal? Is a rich law-breaker, out
  on bail, the equal of a vagrant, held in the common lock-up awaiting trial?
  Is a man born with a genius for music the equal of another man born from a
  drug-soaked mother in the slums? Is a prize-fighter the equal of a poet; or a
  painter of landscapes the equal of a man born blind? Do any of those enjoy an
  equal opportunity? And if so, to do what? To live? Then has a man born with
  inherited disease an equal opportunity with another man born healthy, amid
  clean surroundings? It is true, there are many agencies, supported by
  compassionate and earnest people, who endeavor with all their energy to
  provide opportunity for those born in poverty and ill-health. But have they
  succeeded? Why not?</p>

  <p>It would seem &mdash; if we accept the surface-view &mdash; that
  miscarriage of justice is an ineradicable evil, due to ignorance, creating
  deeper ignorance in which to propagate itself. But due to ignorance of what?
  For twenty centuries the churches have thundered dogmas that, they say, would
  solve all human problems if accepted. But countless millions, generation
  after generation, have accepted them. The churches boast of their
  conversions, of the thousands of their congregations, of the increase year by
  year. And has injustice ceased? Has it seemed to begin to cease? Does justice
  dwell among the churches? Or do they rail at one another, split asunder in
  loud disagreement and tear up the tenets they have hitherto proclaimed as
  being statements of divine law?</p>

  <p>We are told, and we cannot be told too frequently, that education is the
  panacea that shall redeem the world from its distress. But who shall do the
  educating? With the proponents of a hundred creeds, and the protectors of a
  thousand policies insisting that their way, and only their way, can be right,
  who shall decide among them? Who shall trust the advocate of this or that
  theory of education, when so few among them are agreed, and so many admit
  that their method of teaching is devised expressly to prevent the evolution
  of individual thought but to establish fixed and arbitrary sets of
  principles, no two sets of which are alike?</p>

  <p>There are those who say the Bible should be rigidly excluded from the
  schools. There are others who insist that it should be the basis of all
  education. There are advocates of a purely 'business training'; others of a
  military system; others who insist that nothing matters except citizenship
  (forgetting, perhaps, that those who must be depended on to teach this
  elusive quality belong of necessity to the generation whose crass ignorance
  of the rudimentary elements of true citizenship produced the worst disaster
  in recorded history &mdash; the war of 1914).</p>

  <p>Insistence on the need of education presupposes ignorance, so there is no
  need to labor that point. The whole world is ignorant, although there never
  was a time when so much money was spent on education, nor when so many
  subjects were taught in schools. There were never, in all history, so many
  men, women, and children legally and illegally confined in prisons; never so
  many lunatics; never so many law-suits; never so much law-breaking; never so
  much propaganda in behalf of remedies for every ailment that the world is
  heir to. There was never less pretense at justice in the conduct of
  international affairs; there has been no period in recorded history when the
  truth about any aspect of life had less chance of unprejudiced consideration;
  never, since the stories of the nations first began to be written, have there
  been so many fads, recipes, and 'cure-alls' (some intentionally fraudulent,
  some honestly conceived and offered desperately for a world's salvation).</p>

  <p>One section of the world is 'rolling in money,' while another section
  lacks the mere necessities of life. Two thirds of the world is arming itself
  deliberately in preparation for 'the next war,' which all agree will destroy
  civilization if allowed to happen; and taxes are being laid on unborn
  children to defray the cost of a war which concluded in a treaty, whose
  clauses none of the signatory nations has observed, or ever intended to
  observe.</p>

  <p>Under a specious pretext that publicity is purifying, scandal has become
  an hourly entertainment, published in big-type editions as fast as the wires
  can collect it and enormous presses can be made to whirl. Injustice in the
  courts is ensured by incessant and untruthful propaganda, so adroitly handled
  that none can trace its origin, and yet no juryman can truthfully declare
  that his mind has not been prejudiced. Men of integrity and self-respect
  refuse to offer themselves for election to public office because of the
  certainty that their honor will be called in question and their past will be
  raked for incidents to which slander may be linked. And yet the very
  newspapers that hourly perpetrate all these injustices and by constant
  example increase the tendency toward unfairness in the public mind, preach
  justice, presumably believe in justice, and bemoan the miscarriage of justice
  when the all too frequent fact is called to their attention.</p>

  <p>Ignorance is the reason, obviously. No man, unless mad, and no body of
  men, unless victimized by what has recently been renamed crowd-psychology,
  would deliberately do what they knew would react disastrously upon
  themselves. Who takes a red-hot iron in his naked hand, or stands in the way
  of an express train? A madman now and then, perhaps; a suicide; a child
  &mdash; a very young child; never a grown man in full possession of his
  reason and possessed of enough intelligence to recognize cause and effect.
  And yet, it would be safer to do either of those things than to continue in
  the way the world is drifting.</p>

  <p>There is no escape from consequences. No deed can be separated from its
  ultimate effect, nor can it be dissociated from the doer, whether done in
  love or hate or ignorance (which is the mother of all crime). In the practice
  of law it is conceded that ignorance of the law is no excuse. It is so in
  nature; ignorance will not protect the man who touches a high-tension wire,
  or save the animal that walks into a trap. Mass-ignorance is no better (and
  perhaps worse, because self-multiplying) than that of individuals, and no
  number of ballots will avoid the ultimate conclusion; as for instance, if a
  million men should vote to have no earthquake, would the Law that governs
  Nature change itself to suit them? Ignorantly, men may build their city in an
  earthquake-zone, but it is they, not Nature, who must reap the
  consequences.</p>

  <p>Who, if he knew with utter certainty that he must undo and redress
  whatever wrong he does, would perpetrate a wrong? Yet such is the fact, and
  there is no escape from it. The fallacy, that the Psalmist's three score
  years and ten are the sum-total of a man's experience, is at the bottom of
  the ignorant delusion that a man may do wrong and not pay for it in full.
  There is no escape through death's door, because death is no more than a
  period between two lives, and we return to earth again to face in naked
  justice the effects of all we did or left undone.</p>

  <p>Precisely there is where the churches fail. They preach the Sermon on the
  Mount, but teach that men may not revisit scenes of earth-experience or meet
  again in justice those whom they have loved, neglected, wronged. They lull
  the conscience of the race to sleep with fables of vicarious salvation, and
  invent a death-bed remission of sins to disguise the sheer injustice of the
  doctrine.</p>

  <p>Truth, Justice, Silence, are the Keepers of the Law. No pompous rituals
  are needed; no observances of fasts; no censored prayers. In silence the
  whole ritual of Nature, sun and moon and stars, the seasons and the sea, the
  grass &mdash; the very insects &mdash; are the witnesses of Truth. And
  prayer, in its highest form conceivable, is no more than acknowledgment of
  Justice.</p>

  <p>For Justice is not mocked, although men mock themselves in ignorance of
  its unchanging Law. No pessimism can avoid the truth, that men reap mercy
  where they sowed good-will; no optimism can avert the consequence of wrong.
  Selfishness, whatever tyrannies it may invent, can find no enduring
  substitute for the Fact of Universal Brotherhood, which is, and was, and will
  be until the end of time, and must be recognized before the world can be
  redeemed.</p>

  <p>The Law is silent. Tumult of elections and the roar of massed artillery
  are as useless to modify or cancel it by one degree as psalms sung to a
  cathedral roof are impotent to delay the procession of day and night or alter
  the position of the North Star. The Law is silent, but not secret: as a man
  sows, so shall he reap. He who takes the sword shall perish by the sword. Do
  unto others as ye would they should do unto you.</p>

  <p>There is nothing in the Law imposing blame on others for disasters that
  befall ourselves. There is a line in one of Rudyard Kipling's poems
  (Tomlinson) that states the case exceeding clearly:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The sins that ye do by two and two<br>
  Ye shall pay for one by one."</p>&gt;

  <p>Therein is the conclusion of the matter. There is nothing there of dogma,
  no convenient side-exit to salvation through the medium of some other man's
  responsibility, or through repentance murmured on a deathbed when the
  consequence of wrong deeds seems to have no further personal significance and
  nothing can be gained by continued hypocrisy. The Justice of the Universe
  does not miscarry, and the Law cannot be bribed, deceived, or flattered.</p>

  <p>The grand responsibility has been imposed on us that we create our
  destiny. The dignity of true divinity, the right of Universal Brotherhood,
  the power to control and discipline ourselves, are ours. The Law adjusts all
  balances and measures the exact effect of every thought and deed, detecting
  each hidden motive, registering justly. Energy is not lost. One tear shed,
  one sigh, one effort made in behalf of Brotherhood is as sure of its effect
  as is the act of multiplying two by two, no matter what all the creeds
  proclaim or all the legislatures try to do about it.</p>

  <p>Neither man, nor cataclysm, nor the Hierarchies can undo one detail of the
  past or help one individual to avoid his full share of responsibility. The
  juryman who casts his vote on the score of prejudice, or for convenience, or
  because he seeks a personal reward, has no escape in the excuse that he was
  one of twelve; as he judged, so shall he be judged, his every secret motive
  taken into reckoning, for him or against him. The judge who misdirects a
  jury, the attorney who connives at falsehood, each, alone is answerable for
  his thought and act; each, for himself, has outlined one inevitable issue of
  his destiny.</p>

  <p>There is nothing haphazard or unjust in the Universe. Each man, each
  insect, each imponderable atom, is exactly placed in the conditions it
  deserves, in which it must meet the consequences of the past, may profit by
  the accumulated strength of past experience, and may evolve to higher
  consciousness by dint of self-directed effort. Duty is the keynote of the
  Universe &mdash; duty and responsibility: Duty so to discipline and control
  oneself that every thought and act may make life grander and more
  frictionless for others; Responsibility before the Higher Law.</p>

  <p>The fashion of the moment is to seize on personal advantage and to blame
  other men, other nations, other modes of thought for every failure to attain
  the momentary goal. And yet, each pauseless moment holds for every individual
  in all the Universe these three essentials &mdash; Duty, Responsibility, and
  Opportunity. As surely as a seed can spring to life in silence, burst asunder
  granite rocks and grow upward toward the invigorating light, each individual
  can, and each eventually must, allow the secret promptings of his heart to
  grow within him and expand until the very prison-walls go down and each steps
  forth with new and grander fields to conquer.</p>

  <p>For there is no calculable end &mdash; no limit to the depth to which the
  careless may consign themselves, nor any limit to the heights to which each
  one of us may climb. Responsibility begets responsibility. Each duty faced,
  accepted, done, begets a greater duty and the power to deal with it. None
  knows whose duty is the greatest, whose the least. A hand extended to a man
  in jail, a word dropped quietly in a bewildered ear, one step taken, or not
  taken, can have immeasurable consequences; and the unknown motive is the
  element that counts.</p>

  <p>The ignorance that halts us all and throws the world into confusion is the
  blind, insane belief that all life is material and limited within the
  actuary's law of average the three score years and ten that begin with
  nothing and end nowhere. Viewed within those limits, through the
  matter-legend lens, there is neither purpose nor motive in life and all, as
  the ancient preacher said, is vanity &mdash; with thirty thousand guesses at
  the nature of a hypothetical after-life to choose among, and no certainty but
  that woe is for the weak. Such thinking leads inevitably to the grossest
  forms of selfishness and to the vilest crimes; just as the belief that a man
  may save his soul by accepting the legend of another's sacrifice opens the
  door wide to cant, hypocrisy, and guile.</p>

  <p>It is not until we ponder and absorb the oldest teaching in the world,
  Theosophy, that there is evoked within us knowledge which makes the heart
  sing, and understanding of the purpose and the justice of the Universe begins
  to dawn. Duality and the divinity of man, once recognized, bring laughter
  with them and a sweeping view of endless Evolution, forever mounting through
  a grand Eternity, in which no stone is overturned, no sigh escapes, no deed
  is done, and no least thought expended without exact, proportioned
  recompense.</p>

  <p>For lo! &mdash; we are the brothers of the stars, and of the wind and rain
  and of the sunlight shimmering on azure seas.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, April 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">MOST of us pride ourselves on being sincere and
  reasonable. Modern systems of government are based on a theory that
  reasonable men and women shall elect their representatives, who, after
  reasoning out the issues of the day, shall reach decisions reasonably
  applicable for the common good. Nothing more annoys an individual than to be
  told he is unreasonable and insincere. International irritation is the
  invariable consequence whenever one nation's press and politicians charge the
  government of another nation with adopting an unreasonable attitude.
  Criticism that a creed or dogma is unreasonable induces frenzy and such rawly
  irreligious bickering as recently has broken out between the self-styled
  Fundamentalists and so-called Modernists. And we pride ourselves that our
  irritation is due to our sincerity.</p>

  <p>Just how sincere and reasonable really are we? Man, catalogued by the
  scientists as <i>homo sapiens,</i> concedes himself to be the crowning glory
  of creation because his reason is developed, whereas, it is asserted, animals
  have only instinct and &mdash; it is again asserted &mdash; flowers, sun,
  moon, stars, and the imponderable universe have no intelligence whatever. But
  can this egoistic claim by <i>homo sapiens</i> be supported by evidence, in
  the light of the very reasonableness, which he asserts is his own exclusive
  attribute?</p>

  <p>Will this vaunted reasonableness bear sincere scrutiny? How much of our
  thinking and our conduct of ourselves and our affairs is due to what in
  animals we arrogantly term 'blind instinct'; how much is due to what in
  nature we term 'blind forces'? And just how open-eyed and open-minded are we
  ourselves, as compared to the nations, sections of society, animals,
  vegetables, minerals, and unknown stars, which we regard as 'inferior'
  because devoid of that ability to reason of which we boast?</p>

  <p>Webster's dictionary defines reason as "the power or faculty of
  comprehending and inferring." What is it that we comprehend? What is it we
  infer? Where are we, as a consequence? And whither is the process leading us?
  The question requires to be faced.</p>

  <p>Do we reason from cause to effect? Do we comprehend causes at all? Or do
  we infer imaginary causes, and try to justify the inference by seeking, from
  a thousand different motives, to manipulate the effects of our wrong
  thinking? In the event that the latter should appear to be true, are we brave
  enough, and sufficiently reasonable, to reverse our mental processes and to
  face the issue? And if we refuse to face the issue, in what way are we
  superior to 'the beasts that perish' or to the vegetables, which we and the
  animals eat?</p>

  <p>It is true that we can kill the animals. But they can also kill us. It is
  true, we have invented methods for butchering hecatombs of beasts, which
  place the beasts at a considerable disadvantage and appear to make it
  improbable at the moment that the beasts will ever gain the ascendancy. But
  it is also true that organized hosts of creatures, so small individually as
  to be almost, if not quite invisible under the most powerful microscope, can
  kill us with much more deadly certainty than we can massacre, say, elephants
  or rabbits. Consider the microbe.</p>

  <p>We can, and we do kill one another; and we do it with more ingenuity, more
  cruelty, and more hypocrisy than can by any stretch of the imagination be
  charged against the animals to which we claim to be superior. We try to
  exterminate some animals on account of their alleged ferocity; but if their
  ferocity is bad, is not ours worse? Therefore, if they should be destroyed,
  should we not also be destroyed? It would appear, judging from the news in
  the sensational newspapers, that all humanity is surging forward to
  destruction; and although we do not like to believe that, but prefer to
  solace ourselves with the delusion that our particular nation, our particular
  political system, ourself and our circle of friends are immune from what we
  see, more or less clearly, to be impending on the 'inferior' peoples of the
  earth, it would likely do us no harm to consider wherein our alleged safety
  lies, and whether the causes that we are agreed endanger others are not also
  at the root of our own thinking.</p>

  <p>It is fashionable nowadays to denounce as a 'knocker' everyone who
  discerns and dares to mention faults in the conduct of private, local, or
  national affairs, and the imputation is that all such individuals belong to
  the undesirable class of selfishly carping critics who loathe to see
  prosperity in other people. Alternatively, whoever cheers noisily for
  conditions as they are is called a 'booster,' and is supposed to belong to
  that respectable class of honest citizens who always loyally fulfill their
  obligations and on whom prosperity depends.</p>

  <p>But that fashion is not new. The system of labeling oneself and one's
  opponents, with the absurd notion of monopolizing all the credit and assuming
  none of the responsibility, and with the criminal intention of masking one's
  own selfishness, while attributing ill-faith to one's opponents, is as old as
  savagery. The fact that these labels, religious as well as political, are as
  often as not chosen for the purpose of self-deception makes no important
  difference; it is just as criminal to deceive oneself as to deceive others,
  because self-deception is the underlying cause of all crime.</p>

  <p>No one would commit any crime whatever, unless he were first self-
  deceived; the inevitable outcome would be too obvious. Unless first self-
  deceived, we could never be deceived by others, nor could we ever be induced
  to practise deception. We all know this. The very children know it. The first
  principle of banking, and of every other successful business, is to be on
  guard ceaselessly against self-deception, and the great majority of failures
  are attributed to lack of judgment, which is only another name for the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>There are two outstanding peculiarities of human nature, which anyone can
  recognize who dares to examine his own thought processes; but although we
  like to pride ourselves on daring, we are seldom prone to it when we
  ourselves are to be the objects of experiment. The two peculiarities are
  these: that we always seek to transfer the blame for any sort of evil
  consequences, from ourselves to others; and that we will accept any
  makeshift, any harbor of refuge, rather than be radical, admit that our
  philosophy is wrong, and face the issue bravely reasonable. We pretend to,
  and to some extent we do hate insincerity (as for instance when we think we
  immeasurable it in the arguments and acts of others); but it remains the
  king-pin, so to speak, of our own and of all the world's calamities. Until we
  learn to be sincere, there is no hope whatever of relief from distress,
  whether individual or national. And the process must begin at home. We can
  never be sincere with others until we are first wholly sincere with
  ourselves.</p>

  <p>It is an indisputable axiom, discernible in every circumstance of nature,
  that like begets like. In Bible-phraseology, we cannot gather figs from
  thistles or obtain both sweet and bitter water from the same spring.
  Nevertheless, we pretend to try to abolish crime by hanging criminals; we
  seek to abolish pain by permitting vivisection; we pretend to aspire to
  peace, while openly boasting of our preparations for 'the next war'; we
  prohibit alcoholic drink and censor plays, books, motion pictures, but insist
  that our newspapers shall print sensational reports of every abominable
  crime. In law we hold each individual responsible for his own acts, unless it
  can be proved he is out of his mind, in which case we lock him up and make
  ourselves responsible for him; yet we seek 'salvation' through 'vicarious
  atonement,' and try to substitute a 'profession of faith' for downright
  honesty, as a solution of the mystery of life after death.</p>

  <p>These are only a few of our more obvious absurdities; anyone who cares to
  look about him frankly can discover countless others for himself. They are
  all due to our besetting sin of insincerity, which is the armor of
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>The process of insincerity is easily illustrated, and the arguments by
  which it propagates itself will occur to everyone the moment the illustration
  is given. Consider the question of international rivalry and what has
  happened recently in that connection. Weary of a sort of warfare that
  exhausted all the combatants and left none with a perceptible advantage, the
  rival governments sent representatives to a conference, at which it was
  agreed to limit the more costly and 'out-of-date' engines of destruction.
  There has been a great deal of mutual suspicion since then, as to whether the
  governments who agreed to the contract have loyally obeyed its terms; but
  there is absolutely no question that every government concerned is working
  day and night to supply itself with cheaper and much more deadly means of
  making war!</p>

  <p>That is no secret. It is openly discussed in the newspapers; and there are
  very few newspapers that do not urge their own government to assume the lead
  in deadly preparation. The excuse is, that unless this government is fully
  prepared to do wholesale murder on a scale never before dreamed of, that
  government will take the initiative and will seize the upper hand by means of
  ruthless butchery.</p>

  <p>A nice new label has been made for this comparatively ancient form of
  international mistrust. But Xenophobia is nothing but another mask for
  insincerity &mdash; another way of deceiving ourselves and imputing the blame
  either to others or to a psychology over which we are supposed to have no
  control. It would be amusing, if it were not so disastrous, stupid, and yet
  simple of solution. The apparent helplessness of individuals takes all the
  humor from the situation. The individual who feels inclined to sneer would do
  better to remember that the acts and methods of governments are no more than
  a large-scale illustration of the workings of the human mind, his own
  included.</p>

  <p>From the pulpits of a million churches the command is thundered: "Love ye
  one another!" There lies the solution certainly. But without sincerity it is
  impossible to love.</p>

  <p>We are all afraid. Our lower nature, which persists in every one of us (or
  we should be invisible to mortal eyes and functioning on vastly higher planes
  of being) dreads its own destruction and deceives us &mdash; even the best of
  us &mdash; with arguments of ever-increasing subtly, of which a favorite one
  is that we should be at the mercy of the lower nature of others unless ready
  at all times to use dishonest methods for our own defense. But the truth is
  that the only absolute protection against treachery is honesty. The slightest
  compromise with dishonesty provides an opening through which the darkest
  forces surge and gain control of us. It is not the other man's dishonesty,
  but our own that endangers us as individuals. In other words, if we admit one
  trace of insincerity into our reasoning the effect is similar to that of
  poison introduced into a well; it does not poison one part of the water, but
  all of it; and the more colorless and unnoticeable it is, the more deadly the
  results.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to exaggerate the inevitable consequences of continuing
  in insincerity; because the lower nature of every human being is capable of
  limitless evil and, if left to its own resources, is totally incapable of
  anything but evil. The lower nature of nations is a multiplication of the
  lower nature of individuals in the mass. It is what the churches call the
  devil. It possesses a sort of intelligence, which amounts to a keenly alert
  instinct of self-preservation combined with mercurial subtly. It knows no
  more of the higher nature than a stagnant pond knows of the sun that
  sterilizes it. And it is no more useful as a foundation on which to raise a
  spiritual edifice than a desert-mirage would be as a source of drinking
  water. Every concession to the lower nature is of the nature of a bargain
  with a heartless, conscienceless, 'blind force,' and is of the very essence
  of insincerity.</p>

  <p>The common mistake is to regard sincerity as an emotion. Glimpsed through
  the mist of that mistake, it would appear to be the consequence of action, a
  variable product subject to the judgment of opinion, possessing qualities
  that differ in degree with individuals. Accepting that fallacy, we find
  ourselves at a loss for a word with which to define that stark,
  uncompromising habit of watchful self-analysis, which alone insures right
  activity.</p>

  <p>It is customary (perhaps because we like to be respectful) to speak of the
  sincerity of politicians, churchmen, and (undoubtedly because of a desire for
  self-respect) particularly of ourselves. And yet, in whichever direction we
  look, we see in our own actions, and in the acts of others, the
  unquestionable effects of insincerity. A world-wide plebiscite for or against
  the Golden Rule would certainly produce an overwhelming, and possibly
  unanimous, vote in favor of it, but the vote would be perfectly insincere,
  and its only possible result would be a temporary smug self-righteousness and
  a delusion that the world was better than it is. Ignorance knows nothing of
  sincerity; and sincerity cannot be attained by protesting allegiance to a
  creed, whose tenets are obscure and incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>Sincerity is impossible without knowledge. We must understand what we
  profess before there can be the remotest chance of putting the profession
  into practise. And it is surely obvious that we must understand ourselves
  before we can hope to understand others or be qualified to criticize
  them.</p>

  <p>The occult, that is to say the concealed, inmost, meaning of sincerity is
  Self-knowledge. It is the only guide to right action. To wait for sincerity
  in others before striving to attain it in oneself would be as useless as to
  wait for the harvest without troubling to plant the seed. The Millennium will
  come when we have learned sincerity. We shall find it within ourselves
  &mdash; or nowhere.</p>

  <p>The world's problems appear intricate and overwhelming. The more they are
  studied, the more impossible it seems that any of the plans for their
  solution can provide relief. It is beginning to dawn on businessmen, and even
  on the legislatures, that no nation, and no individual can live unto himself
  alone but that a disaster to one section of humanity is sure to be felt
  eventually in the remotest corners of the earth. But the converse of that is
  equally true, and is immensely more important to consider, because on it
  depends the redemption of the human race.</p>

  <p>Improvement in any one individual must eventually benefit the whole world.
  Therein lies the solution of the whole difficulty, extremely simple, yet, in
  common with all simple things, prodigiously more difficult to do than may
  appear at first sight. Sincerity must be the watchword, or the effort is
  waste. Sincerity, which knows no thought of compromise, insists that the sole
  motive for self-improvement shall be that others may be the beneficiaries;
  and that is the exact opposite of all of the methods of self-improvement that
  the world endorses.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Wisdom, which is the mother of all religions, teaches that man
  is the microcosm of the macrocosm, and we can prove this for ourselves, if we
  only examine ourselves fearlessly. Within our own consciousness we may
  discern every one of the motives that govern and misgovern all mankind. As
  individuals we have no resources and no virtues that are denied to other men;
  we are immune from none of the temptations that waylay others; we have the
  same destiny, whether or not we immeasurable it, the same broad duty to our
  fellow-men, the same Law for our guidance. And the only way in which we can
  obey the Law is by applying it in every instance to ourselves.</p>

  <p>Our lower nature is incapable of comprehending, and consequently utterly
  incapable of obeying, the Higher Law. Our Higher Nature knows the Law. Which
  of the two is to govern us, which is to direct our thinking and the acts that
  are the outcome of our thinking, is the only real problem we are called on to
  decide.</p>

  <p>We are. Each one of us knows that, if nothing else. In phraseology that is
  epochs older than the Bible that is commonly supposed to be its origin, "it
  doth not yet appear what we shall be." Very few are in agreement, even for
  five minutes at a time, as to the extremely recent past; and human memory is
  silent as to what preceded our birth into this particular existence.</p>

  <p>We are; and we are now. Now, and our own consciousness, are the limits
  within which we function. Now, is the immeasurable point where past and
  future meet. Our consciousness is the immeasurable point at which the Higher
  and the lower nature meet. The only important difference between us and the
  animals is, that while the whole universe, ourselves and the animals
  included, is subject to the law of evolution, we, as human beings, have
  reached the stage of self-direction. We are no longer 'at the mercy' of what
  the scientists prefer to call 'blind forces,' but have the privilege of
  controlling our own individual destiny by the exercise of will. We may
  choose, that is, between the Higher and the lower. We may control and
  discipline our lower selves, or we may let our lower selves continue to
  deceive us. In either event we shall receive the full, logical, exactly just,
  inevitable consequences of our choice.</p>

  <p>In other words, our consciousness &mdash; that of which we are conscious
  &mdash; will continue to be better or to grow worse in exact proportion to
  our effort to be governed by the Higher Law, by recognizing it, or our
  submission to the dictates of the lower nature. The problem is individual in
  every instance.</p>

  <p>Our lower nature is dependable in one, and in only one respect: it is
  invariably a deceiver. Never, in any circumstances, does it tell the truth;
  because it does not, and cannot, know the truth. It presents expediency in
  the disguise of principle and, when that fails, it flatters us with the
  suggestion that we are making sacrifices when we forego personal advantage
  for the universal good. It is obvious at once to anyone who communes with his
  Higher nature even for a moment, that the universal good inevitably must
  include each individual, not excepting him who makes the 'sacrifice'; it
  becomes at once obvious that the only sacrifice that could entail the
  slightest, even momentary disadvantage would be to let go the Higher for the
  sake of the lower, foregoing the universal for the sake of the personal. But
  the ridiculous delusion of self-sacrifice persists and propagates the
  subtlest forms of vanity.</p>

  <p>Another favorite method of the lower nature is to frighten or to flatter
  us with the belief that we must struggle terribly in an incessant warfare
  before the Higher Nature can prevail. But the Higher Nature knows absolutely
  nothing of any struggle. The illustration is at hand, in nature. The moment
  the light appears, the darkness disappears; there is no struggle between
  them. In the bright light of the Higher Nature the darkness of the lower
  vanishes; but as long as one prefers the lower there will be a struggle to
  cling to it, and the dawning of the Light into the consciousness will
  hurt.</p>

  <p>The delusion of struggle is due to insincerity in the attempt at self-
  analysis. It means that one of the subtlest forms of personality is
  masquerading as a virtue. A sense of humor is the readiest solvent of that
  obscure condition, since whoever can laugh at himself is in a fair way to
  become impersonal. He is likely to discern that he has been struggling to
  benefit his personality by posing as a student of the Higher Law; whereas the
  first axiom of the Higher Law is that no degree of selfishness can possibly
  be beneficial, and that the only way in which we can really benefit ourselves
  is by first benefiting others.</p>

  <p>Sincerity insists that the sole purpose of self-directed evolution, its
  only motive, and its constant care shall be, so to discipline, govern, and
  improve ourselves as individuals that we may be, not only not a handicap to
  the rest of humanity, but an assistance to it by becoming fit to bear at
  least our full share of the load. That is the law of Universal Brotherhood.
  Recognition of the Law &mdash; confession to oneself that the law exists
  &mdash; is the first step. Sincerity soon follows; and the first stage of
  sincerity appears when we find ourselves, even while continuing a certain
  course, admitting to ourselves that the course is wrong, instead of deceiving
  ourselves that it is right. In the second stage we discontinue doing what we
  know is wrong, for the simple reason that by injuring our own character we
  are committing a sin against our fellow-man. In the third stage we see
  clearly what the right course is, and from that moment we become a positive
  force for good.</p>

  <p>We are our brother's keeper; but, like the sentinel on duty at the gate,
  we keep him by guarding ourselves against the enemy &mdash; our lower
  nature.</p>

  <p>All the great teachers of whom there is any record have laid down the law
  that we must purify ourselves before we may hope to help others. Jesus of
  Nazareth is quoted as saying: "Cast out first the beam out of thine own eye,
  and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's
  eye"; and that, with characteristic human insincerity, has come to be
  accepted as authentic doctrine by a civilization whose foremost
  characteristic is delight in condemnation of its neighbor while continuing
  its own self-indulgence in immorality.</p>

  <p>But the reason is not far to seek. The two essential facts &mdash; Duality
  and Reincarnation &mdash; have been overlooked. The 'three-score years and
  ten' that statisticians and a prophet have assured us is about the limit of a
  human life, have so circumscribed our view that the task of raising the
  general standard of morality appears hopeless, if not useless. The old Latin
  proverb <i>Cui Bono &mdash;</i> in colloquial modern English, 'What's the
  use?' &mdash; must occur in some form or another to every man who assumes
  that he was 'born in sin,' lives for something less than a hundred years,
  dies, and 'that's the end of it.'</p>

  <p>Reincarnation instantly changes the aspect of things and events. The
  moment we realize that no effort can possibly be lost, that no thought and no
  deed can remain uncompensated, that full and perfect justice is unavoidable,
  and that we return into the world again, and again, and again, to meet
  exactly the conditions that our former efforts have deserved, we begin to
  discern the purpose and the joy of evolution and to take our part in it with
  a sincerity that has no use for self-pity and laughs at adversity as an
  experience whose sublime and encouraging purpose is that we may learn from it
  self-mastery &mdash; the Key of Life eternal.</p>

  The mystery of morning and the music, and the hue<br>

  And So I know who Hope is and why she never sleeps,<br>
  And seven of the Secrets that are jewels on her breast;<br>
  I stood within the Silence of the Garden that she keeps,<br>
  Where flowers fill the footprints that her sandals pressed;<br>
  <br>
  And I know the springs of laughter, for I trod the Middle Way<br>
  Where sympathies are sign-posts and merry Gods the Guides;<br>
  I have been where Hope is Ruler and evolving realms obey;<br>
  I know the Secret Nearness where the Ancient Wisdom hides.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, May 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">THE ASPECTS of Theosophy are infinite, but Hope is
  foremost at our present stage of evolution. For without Hope there would be
  no aim in living, and that poet who wrote "Hope springs eternal" was an
  accurate observer of eternal truth. The difficulty is, that hope, as it is
  commonly accepted, is a chancy, vain, imaginary creature of the lower senses,
  based on appetite and doomed inevitably to be disappointed for the reason
  that although its objects may appear to be attained, they are illusory. The
  yearnings of the lower hope are selfish; they are rooted in doubt, which is
  ignorance, and in personality, which is a fraud; they presuppose that there
  can be effect without its cause or an effect not justly and exactly
  consequent upon its cause. But true Hope knows there is a Higher Law which
  guides the Universe, and that as surely as the sun shines there is a Higher
  Purpose, which includes all individuals within its scope and works
  infallibly, through evolution, toward an outcome too glorious for human
  brains to comprehend. The Higher Hope is an expression of the knowledge of
  the Soul.</p>

  <p>It appears to be a rule that every aspect of the Higher Nature must be
  counterfeited on the lower plane, and though that is ultimately only an
  illusion, it is none the less a practical condition now with which we must
  cope. We have accepted a physical world, and human birth that subjects us to
  physical circumstances; and it is with those that we must deal, although
  there is a popular philosophy which claims that, everything being illusion in
  this world, and illusion having no existence, all we have to do is to assert
  the truth of being and be prosperous.</p>

  <p>But that popular philosophy overlooks this all-important detail: those
  very senses with which we are invited to assert the truth of being are
  themselves illusory; those senses do not know the truth of being, are
  incapable of knowing it, and no amount of technical phrasing or
  mass-psychology can give them power to change the effect of cause or to avoid
  the results of ignorance. It is very easy to admit that physical conditions
  must be unreal, when discomfort forces us to yearn for comfort; it is not so
  easy to admit that, however, when fortune appears to favor us; and the
  admission becomes impossible, except as a mere obstinate reiteration of a
  formula, when we find ourselves obliged to take action of any kind. Action
  presupposes the reality of that on which we act and react. We find ourselves,
  to all practical intents and purposes, in the midst of conditions in which it
  is impossible to foresee, or even to guess the immediate, to say nothing of
  the ultimate outcome; and although, as for instance in war, we can sometimes
  force an issue, not the ablest human brain can calculate what the real effect
  of that force will be, to ourselves or to others.</p>

  <p>Recognition of this fact has led to fatalism. Rebellion against it leads
  to mediumship, fortune-telling, and innumerable doctrines that aim at
  establishing control of unseen forces by means of which the individual is
  supposed to be able to rise above necessity and justify his own immediate
  desires. A glimpse of the world through the pages of the daily newspapers is
  proof enough that very few of us are satisfied with circumstances as they
  are, and that very many of us are applying opposed and often violent
  remedies, the only outcome of which must be chaos. And yet, Hope springs
  eternal. The sun rises. The stars keep their appointed places in the sky. And
  here are we. What is this Hope that so inspires us, even in the face of
  superficial fatalism and continuous calamity? What is the Higher Impulse that
  impels us constantly?</p>

  <p>We see in crudest form the lower hope and its absurdities when a man hopes
  for rain, and his wife for fine weather; or when some individuals hope that
  prices of commodities will rise, while others hope with equal fervor that the
  same prices will fall. Criminals hope for a successful outcome of their
  crime. It used to be a practice in many coast settlements to hope, and even
  to pray to God, for a good shipwreck to enrich the community; and it is no
  rare thing in modern life to hope for the downfall of another nation or a
  rival mercantile concern, on the supposition that the disaster may benefit
  others. We have all heard the expression " I hope he may choke," and most of
  us have shared the sentiment at some time or another, even if we have not
  voiced it. Gamblers hope that someone else may lose in order that they may
  win. There are innumerable forms, some not so crude as others, in which this
  counterfeit of Hope has grown familiar to all of us; and, since its essence
  is that somebody must be disappointed in order that somebody else may profit,
  there are few who will deny that at its very best it is no more than an
  emotion, based on ignorance of what is really going to happen. The lower hope
  is speculative, at its best, not moral, and never in the long run satisfying.
  But the Higher Hope is born of knowledge of the Higher Law. It is the breath
  of that knowledge, its divine and satisfying presence. It is eternal,
  all-embracing, and it knows.</p>

  <p>The surest way to become hopeless is to hope for material reward for
  spiritual effort; that brings swift and dire dissatisfaction. A material goal
  precludes all knowledge of what spiritual values are, although the false hope
  may persuade us that we are striving spiritually, and the ultimate effect is
  consequently doubly disappointing. To seek spiritual knowledge in order to
  apply it to material ends is the rankest sacrilege and is more inevitably
  dangerous than to linger a while longer in frank materialism; because to be a
  self-confessed materialist infers sincerity, which is a virtue, whereas
  hypocrisy is the meanest, most cowardly and fatal shape that the lower hope
  assumes. There is no hypocrisy in the Higher Hope, no doubt, no self-
  deception.</p>

  <p>Optimism, in the ordinary meaning of the word, is hardly an advance on
  pessimism, being only the reverse of it; the one 'hopes for the best' without
  justification, the other 'looks for the worst' and very often fails to find
  it. The last degree of optimism is the hope that the observance of some
  stipulated forms of worship will pilot the faithful ritualist into heaven,
  where all traces of sin will vanish instantly and there will be no awkward
  consequences from the misdeeds of the past; and the last degree of pessimism
  is the mad belief in hell, where no good deeds can ever be rewarded and
  eternity is one long torture. Hope &mdash; true Hope, that is &mdash; knows
  neither of these lawless lower-plane inventions, but exists, triumphant,
  knowing that Justice, though tempered with mercy, is unfailing and is utterly
  inseparable from existence.</p>

  <p>Faith, Hope, and Love, that divine Triad so often named, so seldom
  understood, are One, and cannot be understood if the attempt is made to
  separate them or to limit them within the confines of materiality. They are
  spiritual &mdash; that is infinite and universal. Even momentary apprehension
  of them brings us into harmony with all the unseen, spiritual forces of the
  Universe, asserting in our consciousness the true divinity of man.</p>

  <p>Hope is the voice of the Soul that assures us all is well, and that
  experience, of any kind whatever, is a means by which we may learn how to
  live in our Higher Nature instead of yielding to the ignorant solicitations
  of the lower. Faith is conviction of the Higher Universal Purpose that
  includes all life in one grand scheme of evolution. Love is recognition of
  the Universal Brotherhood that would not, even if it could, exclude one
  individual from its all-comprehensive school of experience.</p>

  <p>We know, and mock the fecklessness of Charles Dickens's Micawber. who was
  always expecting "something to turn up"; and even on the mere material plane
  of day to day affairs, in which no law is recognized except the hour's
  necessity, we act on the assumption that we must do something before we can
  get anything. The lowest criminal and the vilest sensualist alike know that
  the satisfaction they seek can only be attained by action in some form or
  other; and their acts are the expression of the hope they entertain; the
  viler their desires, the worse the acts that they commit. Not hearing that
  Hope which is the Soul's voice singing of the Universal Purpose, they are
  deceived by the counterfeit voice that echoes in the empty caverns of the
  lower self, where envy and suspicion and all Truth's opposites hold sway, in
  darkness.</p>

  <p>All deeds &mdash; even the Micawber-like indignity of doing almost nothing
  &mdash; are expressions of some form of hope; and the effect of acts
  committed is related intimately to the hope that governs them. The lower hope
  is blind; it calculates in minutes, hours &mdash; at most in terms of one
  short lifetime limited by death, whose hour is unpredictable. The Higher
  Hope, triumphant in the knowledge of the Universal Law, assured that every
  deed produces justly and exactly measured consequences, inspires deeds that
  not only can do no harm, but that must contribute to the universal benefit.
  It finds its expression now, in deeds that are utterly unselfish, and it
  leaves their consequences to the Higher Law. Hope exists in beneficial
  action.</p>

  <p>Faith is the strength and the substance of Hope. It is the knowledge that
  the Higher Law exists and deals unerring justice. Faith is the begetter of
  sincerity, that staunchest of virtues, which, if a man has it, will redeem
  &mdash; inevitably must redeem &mdash; him, howsoever gross his sins. Few
  words are more abused than Faith in their everyday interpretation; like the
  lower hope, the lower faith is nothing but a counterfeit. It varies from a
  so-called faith in luck to a belief in a vicarious 'salvation' based on the
  acceptance of a stipulated doctrine. Men speak of keeping faith with one
  another, who have not the remotest notion of what real Faith is, and who have
  no intention of preserving even the appearance of honesty toward any but
  their own immediate acquaintances. Such faith is either a belief based on
  ignorance, a loosely applied synonym for policy, or unadulterated fraud. It
  is a label which hypocrisy too easily applies to selfish plans, and, like
  personal honor, it depends for its interpretation on the personal caprice of
  those who walk in ignorance or in defiance of the Higher Law.</p>

  <p>True Faith is more impregnable than iron. It is divine. Its strength
  increases in emergency. It governs deeds, ignoring the emotions of the moment
  and the threats of temporary storm. It knows no compromise. It is the
  consciousness of true divinity, the will to hope, the confident acceptance of
  the Higher Law, the essence of all right action. There is no fear in Faith,
  for fear cannot exist in contact with it. Faith and Hope together are the
  very spirit of the trees and flowers, of the stars and the clouds and the
  rolling rivers that bear the dust of mountains to the sea to make new earth
  for unborn continents.</p>

  <p>Faith, discerning 'now' to be the presence of eternity, postpones no
  proper duty to a more convenient time. As the sun makes its presence felt by
  light and heat, Faith finds its being in deeds. Its very breath is action. It
  knows neither haste nor weariness, but everlastingly supplies the energy of
  Hope and Love.</p>

  <p>Not even Faith is commonly more misinterpreted than Love. The whole dark
  fiber of sensuality, double-dyed with sentiment, is woven into a shroud with
  which to hide the glory of divine Love. The rankest, most destructive forms
  of selfishness are used to screen Love's rays. There is not one foul crime
  that has not been committed in Love's name. Men speak of Love, and store up
  deadly gas with which to poison men of other nations; they preach concerning
  Love, and hang convicted boys, whose crimes were mainly due to other men's
  neglect or other men's example. The doctrine "Love ye one another" is
  regarded as extremely good advice to other men to love us and our
  peculiarities, but is not allowed to influence us much in our initiative
  toward them.</p>

  <p>Yet Love is recognition of the fact of Universal Brotherhood and is
  inseparable from Faith and Hope. It is the opposite of selfishness. Its
  action is obedience to the Law that no good can be gained except by
  benefiting all, and injury to one is injury to all, the injurer included.
  Being totally unselfish in its motive, the first impulse of divine Love
  stirring in the consciousness is toward self-regeneration in order that the
  self may not harm or impede others; and the instant companions of that
  impulse are the voice of Hope, that foretells progress, and the thrill of
  Faith assuring us of what the Bible calls "the everlasting arms" &mdash; the
  Forces that support and guide the constellations, Mother Nature, and
  ourselves.</p>

  <p>Neither Hope nor Faith nor Love are in any way conditioned by the senses,
  which they purify and change until the lower nature yields under the
  invincible influence of the Higher and we see the grandest of all triumphs
  &mdash; one step upward in man's evolution. Hope, then, has a wider view, and
  understanding dawns that evolution is eternal and the spiritual progress of
  the individual is linked inseparably with the life of every living thing.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, Hope becomes a challenge. No retrogression then, no
  overwhelming flood of circumstance can drown the consciousness of individual
  responsibility. We know, for Hope has told us and the inspiration cannot die,
  that we direct our destiny and reap exactly as we sow. The Law, that as we do
  to others shall be done to us, becomes intelligible and so blended in our
  thought that every action is intuitively governed by it. Not a circumstance
  arises but we immeasurable the challenge to maintain our spiritual vision and
  to reject the suggestions of our lower nature in order that the Higher may
  prevail and benefit mankind.</p>

  <p>Illimitable fields lie fallow in the view of Hope, awaiting husbandry. No
  three-score years and ten outline the vision. Temporary barriers that name
  themselves impossible, and temporary needs that trumpet their importance,
  sink to insignificance in the perspective when the Higher Hope reveals the
  spiritual truth of rebirth and the endless scope of action. When it dawns on
  understanding that a deed done now must have its corresponding consequence
  and that, in after-lives forever, we <i>must</i> feel in our environment the
  unspent sum of every effort we have made unselfishly for others; when we
  realize that out of deeds done now power to do greater deeds is born, the
  least, unnoticed effort becomes glorious, and every waking minute then
  presents itself as golden opportunity.</p>

  <p>Time loses its hypnotic spell when Hope outcharms it. We become aware of a
  new reckoning of time, in spiritual terms, recording spiritual progress.
  Within the sanctuary of the Soul, where no material sense-clouds can dim or
  tumult penetrate, the secret knowledge of the Higher Law broods permanently
  and inspires to wise, unselfish action that contributes to the universal need
  instead of flattering the temporary mood of passing hours. So Hope engenders
  wisdom, of which ignorance knows nothing, and the ignorant attempts of those
  who lend themselves to malice fail because they cannot even see the goal or
  comprehend the purpose. In the Sanctuary of the Soul &mdash; "the Secret
  Place of the Most High," the Psalmist calls it &mdash; he who recognizes the
  inspiring challenge of the Higher Hope is safe.</p>

  <p>Hope, inseparably joined to Faith and Love, is no weak suppliant, no
  pleading seeker to escape responsibility. Hope urges no remission of the sins
  of selfishness but challenges experience to bring forth opportunity, so that
  the consequences of wrong action may be met and lessons mastered.
  Responsibility is Hope's proud Gonfalon.* No blame of others, no attempt to
  justify wrong-doing by the plea that others did the same, or worse, no self-
  pity and no self-righteousness can live within Hope's realm, where all the
  consequences of the past are bravely met and, moment after moment, thought on
  thought and deed on deed, the foundations of the future are deliberately
  laid.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gonfalon</i> (Italian "gonfalone") &mdash; a banner
  suspended from a crosspiece, especially as a standard in an ecclesiastical
  procession or as the ensign of a medieval Italian republic. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/G0189600.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Vain regrets and vain desires all vanish in the light of Hope. Mere
  personal ambitions, sloth, inertia, and jealousy all cease. The grander
  vision of the spirally ascending march of spiritual evolution so absorbs the
  thought that every word and deed assume new values and are governed by a
  higher motive. Health responds. The Law of Karma may impose conditions that
  may not be avoided, but Hope gives royal courage and supplies the strength
  with which to meet them &mdash; strength, and the assurance that a Universal
  Brotherhood will be the better for one Soul's experience well met and
  triumphed over.</p>

  <p>The only selfishness permitted in the realm of Hope is self-watchfulness,
  self-discipline, self-control, with one unselfish end in view: that we may
  not harm others or neglect one opportunity to serve the whole world wisely.
  Pride of achievement becomes as offensive in ourselves as false humility, or
  as a loathsome habit, as soon as Hope reveals to us the limitless eternity of
  spiritual evolution; for true achievement, though it satisfies, impels to
  further effort; though it thrills with proof of power and responsibility, it
  lays bare need for self-regeneration never previously dreamed of.</p>

  <p>Old-age, illness, and adversity are transient and not discouraging
  incidents when the Higher Law is recognized and Hope reveals how limitless
  and universal are our opportunities, how grand our destiny, and how each
  spiritual conquest of the self contributes to the evolution of the Universal
  Brotherhood. No thought is lost; no effort made to lessen the anguish of one
  individual is made in vain; each spiritual thought admitted into
  consciousness is added to the common store and helps in the regeneration of
  the world.</p>

  <p>The lower, sensual, blind hope is never satisfied and never can be, for it
  seeks contentment in a rearrangement of the evils that provide its impulse;
  it is ever looking to find happiness in some conclusion and to reach a state
  of 'thus far and no further' in which the lower nature may indulge itself
  unchallenged by the Soul. It presupposes a beginning and an end; it assumes
  that justice is not inevitable; it supposes that material comfort and
  material success are the purpose of life and the goal, not only of all
  energy, but of religion. When it accepts, to save itself from tiresome creed
  and ritual observance, the less restricting view of evolution, it excites
  itself with what it thinks is new-found freedom, casts all self-discipline
  aside, and gives rein to the self-indulgence that convention hitherto had
  held in check. There is no wisdom and no safety in the lower hope, nor any
  peace.</p>

  <p>But to the Higher Hope each new discovery of Universal Law is spiritual
  healing and a trumpet-call to rise to higher vision yet, uncluttered by the
  rubbish of the lower senses. Knowing there is no beginning and no end,
  discerning the ascending, ever-satisfying, ever-challenging, and infinitely
  various delight of self-directed evolution, true Hope springs eternal, brave
  and buoyant, Truth her watchword, Brotherhood her breath, the Ancient Wisdom
  her aspiring wings.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, June 1924</h3>

  <p class="quote">"He who knows, is unafraid and is therefore too wise to
  threaten; because a threat is an admission that the cause he has at heart is
  unjust. He who knows not, threatens; and accordingly the knowing are
  forewarned. Justice has a sharp sword, and its sheath is Silence."<br>
  &mdash; From <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p>

  <p style="text-indent:0">BLACKMAIL is a predominating evil of this age and
  generation. We are largely governed by it, in private and in public life,
  nationally and internationally. Our views of history are warped and obscured
  by a process of so-called education, of which blackmail is an intrinsic
  principle. Business is limited and hindered by it. Our law courts are in
  countless instances its unintentional agents. All altruism is restricted by
  the dread of what the blackmailers may say or do to discredit anyone who
  dares to act with true nobility.</p>

  <p>The blackmailer is one who fears that his own tricky interests cannot be
  served except by unjustly accusing another, and who threatens infamy, loss,
  or violence in order to compel compliance with his arbitrary will or
  concession to his plots.</p>

  <p>The system, which is practically universal in this generation, draws its
  strength and pertinacity from the fixed conviction that the life of a man is
  only three-score years and ten; in consequence of which, all calculations are
  based on an absurdly narrow supposition that immediate profit and loss are
  the only waymarks of success or failure.</p>

  <p>Extreme instances sometimes provide the simplest illustrations, and the
  broadest are the easiest to understand. A nation, for instance, more powerful
  than another threatens war unless the weaker shall comply with a peremptory
  demand. That is blackmail in a sense in one of its crudest and most cruel
  forms, although it is sometimes glorified under the deceptive name of
  patriotism.</p>

  <p>Or, a group of individuals, having what they believe to be interests in
  common, threaten their elected legislators with political oblivion unless
  they shall vote as instructed, whether or not the legislators think that
  course is right. The legislators, yielding to the threat in fear for their
  own pockets and careers, form a caucus and refuse to pass just laws proposed
  by the representatives of other interests unless their own requirements shall
  have precedence. In this way the evil multiplies itself and a small body of
  expert politicians frequently blackmails a whole nation; but the system is
  glorified under the misused title of Right.</p>

  <p>An institution or an individual receives a substantial bequest, from
  someone who, perhaps, made during his lifetime such provision for his
  immediate relatives as he considered just and who wished the balance of his
  fortune to be used for the general good of humanity. But the testator's body
  is hardly decently disposed of before lawsuits are begun to set aside the
  will on the trumped-up excuse of undue influence, the theory being that the
  legatee will rather settle out of court than be put to the expense and
  inconvenience of defending the lawsuit, or the indignity of having to
  disprove false accusations. This is legal blackmail, increasingly common, and
  glorified under the astonishingly misused name of justice.</p>

  <p>The simpler forms of blackmail are all outlawed, but are none the less
  effective in a host of instances. The commonest, and all too frequently
  successful method, is to discover some discreditable fact, or one that
  appears discreditable, in an individual's career, and to threaten him with
  exposure unless he pays a sum of money. There the process is unable to
  disguise itself but stands out raw and hideous; the victim who yields to it
  is reckoned cowardly; the blackmailers themselves, if caught, are punished
  drastically and regarded with loathing.</p>

  <p>But there is no essential difference between the blackguardly motive of
  the blackmailer who extorts money by threat of exposure, and that of the
  lawyer, for instance, who 'earns' a fat fee by using the courts to extort
  money from individuals or institutions who, by force of accident, may be
  unable at the moment to defend themselves against insinuation and false
  evidence. Nor is the self-styled 'reformer' or religionist, who threatens
  organized boycott of individuals unless he shall have his arbitrary way, one
  degree removed in lack of principle from the merchant who threatens to
  withdraw his advertising unless a newspaper shall color its news and
  editorials to comply with his opinions.</p>

  <p>As for the victims, who shall separate them? Who shall elevate them one
  above the other in the ranks of the unwise? Whether or not Helena Petrovna
  Blavatsky* coined the word 'flapdoodle' to apply to spineless folk who yield
  to the threats and to the stings of organized ill will, it is sure she used
  it freely; and the name fits. <i>She</i> never yielded. She earned by her
  courage and honesty the full right to unmask weaklings to themselves and to
  deny their claim to be respectable, however much she pitied them. She stood
  unfrightened, and defied such batteries of blackmail as in all recorded
  history have not been aimed more cruelly at any individual. And she died
  unconquered, her nerves and body racked by the persistent malice of those
  whom she strove to help, her heart triumphant, her mind clear and active to
  the last. The good she did lives after her; her tortures were cremated with
  her bones.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Blavatsky</i> Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-
  1891) &mdash; Russian theosophist and occultist. She was the daughter of a
  German named Hahn who had settled in Russia and who was distantly connected
  with the Russian aristocracy. At the age of 16 she married an elderly man,
  Nicephore Blavatsky, whom she soon left. She traveled extensively in Asia,
  the United States, and Europe. An imposing and persuasive woman, she claimed
  to have spent seven years in Tibet, where she was supposedly initiated into
  mysteries of the occult. In 1873 she went to New York City, and in
  collaboration with prominent persons interested in spiritism she founded
  (1875) the Theosophical Society. The society soon experienced serious
  schisms, and in 1878 Madame Blavatsky, as she was known, left for India,
  where she established headquarters at Adyar near Madras. There she devoted
  herself, with some success, to theosophical organization and propaganda. She
  demonstrated many supernormal phenomena, which were accepted as miracles by
  her followers, but published claims of fraud in the 1880s and 1890s seriously
  damaged her reputation. Her major works were "Isis Unveiled" (1877) and "The
  Secret Doctrine" (1888), which became the textbooks of her disciples.
  <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/bl/Blavatsk.html">The Columbia
  Encyclopedia</a></i>, 6th edition. For more information, see the <a href=
  "http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/">Blavatsky Study Center website</a>. ]</p>

  <p>But Helena Petrovna Blavatsky was not short-sighted, which accounts for
  some part of her courage. She was not obsessed by the absurd belief that
  cause and consequence, aim, effort, and attainment, all must be confined
  within the span of one short human life. Her whole ambition was to serve
  humanity by reviving in its consciousness the Wisdom that was in the world
  from the beginning, and she knew that the cause she served was mightier than
  that of all the hosts of selfishness.</p>

  <p>It needs no exploration into occultism, nor any somersaults of intellect
  to find that supreme selfishness is the only medium in which the principle of
  blackmail can exist. The victim is as selfish in degree as the criminal who
  makes threats in order to enforce his own will or advantage. Selfishness and
  short sight are inseparable, and the only remedy for either is the patient
  exercise of all the faculties in continuous effort to apply, in the thinking
  and acting of daily life, the purest philosophy we know. We can never prevent
  evil, in ourselves or others, except by deliberately and continuously doing
  right.</p>

  <p>The putting into practice of what small philosophy we do know, inevitably
  leads to our learning more and is, in fact, the only way in which we can
  learn; for it should not be overlooked that the mere study of philosophy as
  something abstract and impractical is only one of the subtler forms of
  selfishness, which leads to the slimy quagmires of hypocrisy and cant. An
  old, old proverb, familiar in the dawn of history, when latter-day
  perplexities, perhaps, were still discernible as simple problems uninvolved
  by the millions of mixed considerations that have crept in during the course
  of time, lays down the law &mdash; the true law &mdash; that <i>Experience
  makes wise.</i> There is no wisdom but is gained in actual experience. There
  is no reason for our being in the Universe, except that we may meet
  experience and learn from it, and so evolve forever upward in the endless
  cycles of eternity into the grandeur that is our destiny.</p>

  <p>It is well to consider blackmail from that viewpoint, and to govern
  ourselves accordingly. Deprived by moral blindness of the broader view that
  recognizes this earth-life as but an incident in an eternal chain of lives,
  we become hypnotized by the apparent dangers or advantages of any given
  moment, and so we succumb to the temptations of the lower nature. But the
  fact once recognized, and steadfastly retained in thought, that we are here
  to build the character on which an endless series of future lives inevitably
  will be based, then the absurdity of yielding to threat or immoral suggestion
  becomes evident, along with the equally clear understanding that to threaten
  others, in order to enforce our own will or to obtain an unjust 'profit,a is
  at least as harmful to ourselves as to them. The perspective changes when we
  take the broader view. The advantage of a moment assumes very small
  proportions as against the grand panorama of eternally progressing lives in
  which, with utterly unerring justice, each succeeding life is, in every
  detail, conditioned by the character we have evolved by our own effort in the
  lives lived previously.</p>

  <p>The apparent paradox that we can only help ourselves by continually
  serving others, and that therefore sheer unselfishness is the only form of
  selfishness we can afford to entertain, is an eternal truth. At first sight,
  we being what we are and face to face with effects whose causes lie hidden in
  the unremembered past, it may sometimes be difficult to grasp the fact that
  threats of momentary loss, or promises of momentary gain, are unimportant.
  But the only question of real importance at any moment is, whether our own
  action shall, or shall not, be based on our highest sense of justice and our
  highest concept of unselfishness. It is not easy to be unselfish, until the
  habit takes firm hold of us, and that habit never comes except from constant
  practice. It is absolutely impossible to act justly until we have first
  acquired the habit of considering each daily problem with the eternal law in
  mind, that we can only benefit ourselves by benefiting all the universe.</p>

  <p>We flatter ourselves when we suppose that this is an enlightened age. It
  is fashionable nowadays to sneer at the bygone era when
  ecclesiastically-minded tyrants used to impose their notions of what conduct
  should be, by threatening hell-fire to whoever dared to disagree. But that
  medieval attitude of mind was only simpler &mdash; is only easier to analyze
  at first glance, than our modern systems of politics, business, education,
  religion, and psychology. There were brave, broad-thinking men in those days,
  even as there are now; and the persecution to which brave men and women are
  subjected in this twentieth century, if now and then more subtle, is no less
  torturing, and no less cruel and illogical, than were the penalties imposed
  during what are so inaccurately named the 'middle ages.'</p>

  <p>The difference is this: that while we hunt through the pages of history
  for light on human nature we can easily discern the processes of blackmail
  striving to throttle honesty and all the grandeur of the higher nature; but
  the moment we turn to latter-day conditions those same processes, that
  blinded our 'medieval' ancestors, making victims of them, blind and victimize
  ourselves. We can laugh at or pity those who trembled when a bishop
  threatened them with hell unless they paid outrageously unrighteous tithes;
  but we permit our children to act like libertines, lest they accuse us of
  old-fogeyism or disturb our lethargy with irritating clamor &mdash; we submit
  to extortion in a thousand ways, from fear of slander and inconvenience
  &mdash; we condone (with our votes or our silence) the crimes of the
  ambitious men who intrigue in behalf of war, lest we be accused of lack of
  'patriotism' &mdash; we sometimes refrain from doing what is right, lest the
  advocates of what is wrong should hold us up to obloquy or ridicule; &mdash;
  and we fail to see that we are in no way better or more wise than were the
  pitiable victims of blackmail of whom we read with such unjustified
  sensations of superiority in the pages of comparatively ancient history.
  Morally, and in the main, we are a spineless generation. It will do us no
  harm if we immeasurable the fact instead of further poisoning ourselves with
  flattery.</p>

  <p>We can never learn to guard ourselves against the unsuspected blackmailer,
  whose subtly escapes detection in our present state of self-approving
  ignorance, until we first accustom ourselves to dealing bravely and in
  protest and at once with those immoral methods of oppression and suppression
  that a moment's thought makes obvious. Nor can we ever cease to be the
  unconscious agents of oppression and suppression until we first refuse, in
  hourly intercourse with others, to impose our will on them by means of
  threats in any form whatever.</p>

  <p>Katherine Tingley, Founder of the Raja-Yoga system of education, has set
  the true example in this, as in so many other ways; and as the Leader and
  Teacher of the Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society, in common with
  all true examples, hers is magnificently simple. The pupils at the Raja-Yoga
  College and Schools are never punished or discouraged. There is no threat
  hanging over them to dull their inspiration and deprive them of their divine
  privilege to grow and develop as the flowers grow, in sunlight and fresh air
  &mdash; to grow, that is, into awareness of their own divinity. They are
  given encouragement, not nagging and repression; example, not temptation;
  opportunity to learn for themselves the difference between unselfishness and
  selfishness, between the joy of being useful, moral, and constructive and the
  dreary discontent of being drones and disintegrators.</p>

  <p>There is an infinite gulf between the honor-system that confers intangible
  rewards which increase the individual's self-respect, for doing good, and the
  commoner method of threatening with punishments for failure. The first and
  almost instantly attained result of Katherine Tingley's educational system
  is, that the pupils themselves adopt it and no longer threaten misbehavior in
  order to force concessions from their teachers. The system evokes their
  self-respect; they neither look for nor would they appreciate material reward
  for spiritual progress, but, by putting all their enthusiasm into their
  studies and by exercising self-control they earn the right to study in a
  wider field.</p>

  <p>This system is the opposite of blackmail, which is why it is successful.
  Like begets like &mdash; a law no natural scientist would gainsay. The
  ancient proverb that the child is father to the man, is just as true today as
  centuries ago; and the child who has been threatened and coerced into
  obedience grows up into a man, or woman, who coerces &mdash; or else, who
  submits to coercion because the habit has become ingrained. The child who has
  never been threatened or bribed, grows up into a wholly different and grander
  type of citizen.</p>

  <p>Our lower nature is a blackmailer by instinct. It threatens inconvenience
  unless we yield to it. All other arguments failing, it proceeds to terrify us
  with the threat that we shall be ostracized as cranks by our immediate
  acquaintances and by society at large unless we submit to its impositions.
  But whoever yields to that threat has descended to the plane on which all
  other threats are powerful; one concession leads inevitably to another and
  all liberty of thought or action vanishes, obliterated by the tyranny of
  popular opinion and the clamor of the lower senses.</p>

  <p>Like begetting like, it follows that whoever seeks to enforce his will by
  threats, himself becomes amenable to threats. The story of the little fleas,
  with lesser fleas to bite 'em, and which in turn have lesser fleas, and so ad
  infinitum, has its universal application; the threatener is threatened; the
  coercer is in turn coerced; and so the vicious chain is forged that binds
  humanity in an intolerable grip, which chokes and hinders until spiritual
  death ensues and all society goes down in one of those catastrophes that mark
  the carnage-trail of history.</p>

  <p>The world agrees (with its tongue in its cheek undoubtedly, but it agrees)
  that reputation is the choicest gift at its disposal and that it is better
  for man or woman to lose life than an unsullied name. High, very high among
  its list of attributes on which a fair repute depends, the world ranks
  courage, honesty, clean living and magnanimity, at any rate pretending to
  regard those as the proofs of true manhood and true womanhood. What then
  shall be said in favor of the men and women who make use of utterly unproved
  allegations to destroy the reputation of an innocent person, either for the
  sake of greed, self-advertisement, or to strangle the life-work of the
  individual whom they accuse? What shall be said in favor of any liar who
  circulates false stories, simply to quiet his own consciousness of
  inferiority by slandering someone whose conduct, he intuitively knows, is
  nobler than his own? The pitiable criminal, who offers to abstain from
  libeling and slandering provided he is paid a sum of money, cowardly masking
  his threat under a pretense of give and take, is not much worse, and no more
  pitiable, than the slanderer who hides in anonymity, repeating hearsay
  allegations for the purpose of discrediting another's reputation and thereby
  ruining a cause, and for gain for his personal desires.</p>

  <p>If it is true, as the world agrees, whether hypocritically or not, that an
  unsullied reputation is superior to life itself, then slander is at least as
  bad as murder and those who blackmail others by attacking their reputations
  are committing a more cowardly crime.</p>

  <p>But the truth is, that the world is obsessed by a conviction that it has
  only one short life in which to experience the whole of its emotions and to
  grasp the temporary pleasures that it yearns for; consequently it does not
  hold reputation as superior to life, except as something that may be
  destroyed in order to pursue advantage. It does not value magnanimity, except
  as a peculiarity of certain rare individuals that makes them rather easier to
  rob. When it encounters moral courage, to which it renders so much
  hypocritical lip-praise, it is only to denounce it by whatever catchwords of
  opprobrium may be fashionable at the moment. Honesty, to escape the slander
  of the world, must appear to compromise and be conditioned by a thousand
  subterfuges that have crystallized into accepted custom. Clean living, which
  of all the essentials to spiritual progress the world hates most, is made the
  butt of ridicule, if not of cowardly attempts to ruin by means of slander
  those who practise it.</p>

  <p>The upshot of it all is this: that we cannot afford to yield even to
  attempts at blackmail if our purpose is to serve humanity and to make that
  gradual, well-balanced progress of the Soul to which our destiny entitles us;
  nor will we yield to it if we remember that the business of existence is the
  patient building up of character &mdash; our own first &mdash; the world's by
  our own example.</p>

  <p>There is sanity and calm assurance in the knowledge that we reap exactly
  as we sow. The Theosophical teaching of Karma is the friend of honesty
  &mdash; the enemy of crime. The law of retribution and reward is utterly
  infallible and absolutely just; it knows no haste, no hindrance, no
  exceptions; least of all is it confined within the limits of an earth-life,
  which is no more than a moment in an endless chain of objective existences
  interspaced with periods that we call death &mdash; existences each of which
  is in every way conditioned by the character evolved in previous lives.</p>

  <p>We are now the sum-total of what we have been. According to the doctrine
  of Reincarnation we shall be &mdash; this, conditioned by the exactly
  measured consequence of every deed we do in each life. Deeds being the result
  of character, it is inevitably only character that really counts; but
  character is weighed by deeds, whose quality depends entirely on the motive
  that provides their impulse. No hidden motive, even though so subtly hidden
  that it is totally unperceived, can escape detection by the unerring eye of
  Karma; each concession to the lower nature is against us; each
  self-identification with our Higher Nature, that inevitably leads to conquest
  of the lower, is placed to our credit and can never be forgotten or
  expunged.</p>

  <p>Alertness in detecting wrongs and weighing them, leads to a progressive
  habit, that in turn evokes a readier skill and firmer constancy, until the
  subtler forms of blackmail that have victimized us hitherto, become uncovered
  to our mental vision. Courage employed in withstanding the more obvious and
  superficial threats, or in refusing to be party to them, leads to the greater
  moral courage needed to withstand the more evasive and dangerous forms of
  mental blackmail that increasing spiritual vision lays bare. Thus, by deeds
  done through conscience, spiritual progress is achieved.</p>

  <p>And an attribute of spiritual progress is increasing magnanimity,
  associated with a decrease of the instinct for revenge. Enriched by our own
  experience, increasingly we understand the nature of the pitfalls into which
  those less experienced have blundered. Savagery, envy, and slander aimed at
  ourselves excite in us less resentment and more sympathy; and, as that change
  takes place in our own attitude, there gradually grows in us the wisdom
  necessary to the just determination of each problem in true, theosophical
  living as it actually comes up for decision.</p>

  <p>True solutions of a difficulty must be totally unselfish. Retaliation is
  no remedy, but only serves to increase the ultimate amount of evil by adding
  to the ill will already in circulation. To repay the blackmailer with
  threats, to silence slanderers with slander or money, to oppose ill will with
  self-stupefying anger, is to court the whole savagery of the animal in man.
  By admitting anger and the spirit of revenge into our own motive, we have
  lowered the only shield we have, and have dulled our only weapon.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, we may safely be assured of this: that any problem
  whatsoever, any threat, and any slander, is an opportunity to exercise such
  wisdom as we have, and to learn more wisdom by attaining nobler character.
  There is no other problem, and no other duty, in the last analysis. But
  wisdom is never selfish. The motive of revenge is no more vitiating than the
  equally unmanly subterfuge of cowardice, that offers peace under the pretense
  of piety.</p>

  <p>Theosophy and Courage are one. We have not to defend ourselves, but to
  uphold a Principle. Our persons and our profits are a very small
  consideration in the endless evolution of the Universe. The only real profit
  we can make is in the increase of our spiritual growth; the personalities, in
  which in future lives we are to make our new experience, will correspond
  exactly to that growth; we jettison that prospect, corrupt and undermine it,
  if we value temporary benefit and our momentary mask more highly than the
  duty to do service to humanity.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the theosophical reply to every threat, whatever motive may
  be ambushed under it, is fearless and is aimed at evil, not at individuals.
  The accuracy of its aim depends entirely on its truthfulness; its force is
  gaged by its unselfishness; its consequences will be measured by the quantity
  of contribution that it makes to the spiritual welfare of humanity.</p>

  <p>Infallibly, those consequences will provide grief &mdash; and they may
  bring ruin &mdash; to the unwise individuals who have preferred to take the
  side of slander and identify themselves with animal- and evil-nature. But the
  consequences are exactly measured by the Law of Karma, which will judge
  ourselves and others with impartiality. If we act justly, in the general
  interest, devoid of any sense of personal retaliation but equally
  unsubmissive to the claims of lethargy and cowardice, we need have no fear
  that the consequences will not serve the common welfare, whatever the
  immediate appearance may be.</p>

  <p>Patience is a Godlike attribute; but there is a lower patience: it
  degenerates into a sort of fatalistic lethargy and ceases then to be a
  virtue. It is hardly possible to set a limit to the amount of patience we may
  wisely use in keeping silence as to what we know, or think we know, that is
  discreditable to other individuals. Silence and strength are one, when no
  more is at stake than our own personal emotions; envy, hatred, malice, and
  all uncharitableness, both in ourselves and others, are easiest to smother
  and destroy by never lending them the dignity of speech. In silence, as to
  personal emotions and the merely personal aspects of temporary loss or gain,
  we gather strength and courage, as well as wisdom, to act downrightly and
  nobly, without fear or favor, at the measured moment, when the opportunity
  arrives to act in behalf of Principle and thereby benefit the human race.</p>

  <p>It is always unwise to support the claims of personality, by asserting or
  opposing them. But it is also unwise to submit to blackmail, because it is
  the enemy of Principle. Wisdom is the inseparable companion of Principle; and
  in Wisdom lie the very roots of strength.</p>

  AT THE WHITE-LOTUS DAY CELEBRATION,<br>
  MAY 8, 1924*</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, July 1924</h3>

  <p class="footnote">[ *The anniversary of death of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky,
  the Foundress of the modern Theosophical Movement, is celebrated as "White
  Lotus Day" on May 8 every year. ]</p>

  <p style="text-indent:0">COMRADES: Those of us who are of the present younger
  generation of Theosophists, and who have not had the advantage of a personal
  acquaintance with that grand Leader, H.P. Blavatsky, have none the less the
  privilege of being loyal to her teachings. And it may he, perhaps, that after
  all we have not lost so much, because we are forced to look within ourselves
  for that spiritual Faith which shall make firm our loyalty, without which
  &mdash; I mean without loyalty &mdash; there is no spiritual life.</p>

  <p>Of course the day will come when all the world will accept Theosophy as
  its spiritual guide and its law. We do not know how far ahead that wonderful
  development will be, but we can hope for it and work for it, and the more we
  hope and the harder we work, the sooner it will happen. Much depends on us,
  and on our watchfulness. The seed has been sown, and a grand beginning has
  been made; but most of the work lies ahead. However, a change is taking
  place. Its signs are obvious all over the world. There is an aspect of
  Theosophy that will be recognised by the world long before it accepts the
  spiritual teachings as a whole. In spite of war, and an armed peace in which
  the nations re-arm for further war, there is evident a change within the
  minds of men, in every nation, although there are not many yet who recognise
  that change, and there are fewer still who know the meaning of it. But the
  truth is this: Theosophy is occult, and works in unseen ways.</p>

  <p>H.P. Blavatsky founded a new nation, a universal nation, that knows no
  limits of geography, whose citizenship is not based on color, race, or creed,
  but it depends on character. The Capital of that new nation I take it to be
  here, and it is on us that that nation's future must depend, on us and on our
  loyalty to H.P. Blavatsky and to our present Leader. And I would like to add
  this: that there will ever come crises and emergencies which we must face;
  but we may well remember this: that whatever the difficulties we must face,
  whatever the crises, there will be none so dire as H.P. Blavatsky stood up
  against and faced alone; and the more and the nearer we appreciate the
  grandeur and the majesty of what she did, the nearer we shall be worthy of
  citizenship in that new nation which she founded.</p>

  <p class="quote">"OUR minds should be restless for noble and beautiful
  things."</p>

  <p class="quote">"TO exist the healthy mind must have beautiful things
  &mdash; the rapture of a song, the music of running water, the glory of the
  sunset and its dreams, and the deeper dreams of the dawn."</p>

  realized only in another generation."</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, July 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">DUTY and danger are words whose stark significance
  is nowadays obscured by misuse. Yes and no, however, are the only words in
  any language that are more exactly definite or which, if used with true
  intention, are the keys to more perplexing riddles. One of our many modern
  troubles, that should be one of the easiest to overcome, is that we use words
  much too vaguely and divorce them from their real meaning by admitting
  reservations and equivocations that lead off into endless byways of
  perplexity.</p>

  <p>Duty is that which is due, and there is no escape from it, although the
  ways are limitless by which we may deceive ourselves, and others, with a
  temporary, false sensation of escape. But that is because we are all too
  prone to overlook the fact that all life is eternal, and that death provides
  no 'alibi' or refuge from the inexorable law, that as we sow, we reap. The
  Higher Law, that actually governs us, is neither limited nor qualified by
  time; its range is the eternal Now, and though each succeeding minute may
  provide new opportunities for progress, neither minutes nor aeons affect the
  Law, which is, and was, and forever will be the sole arbiter of individual
  and of collective destiny.</p>

  <p>When a bill is due, we have to pay it; the alternatives are an appeal to
  the more or less elastic patience of the creditor, or bankruptcy. The first
  postpones the day of reckoning but is often costly in accruing interest; the
  other compels us to relinquish all our assets, and to begin again from the
  beginning, without credit and without the benefit of such momentum as a
  business-in-being normally provides. In either event, there is nothing gained
  beyond a breathing-spell; and the only sure way in which a bankrupt can
  regain his credit is by making use of opportunity to settle with his
  creditors to their satisfaction.</p>

  <p>That is no more than a simple illustration of the occult law, that what is
  due eventually must be paid; with interest, if we delay the payment; with
  increased difficulty and without the assistance of reserved resources, if we
  delay too long, or if we are caught deliberately trying to evade a
  settlement.</p>

  <p>A very common cause of bankruptcy is signing other people's notes: that
  is, guaranteeing that another individual shall pay his debts. That individual
  defaults &mdash; and does so the more readily because his sense of
  responsibility has been weakened by what may have been intended by the
  guarantor simply as an act of friendship &mdash; the guarantor is called on
  to fulfill his guarantee; he finds it impossible, fails, and the law takes
  its course. He then joins the host of hurt and disappointed
  good-intention-mongers, who chant the dirge the ages have all listened to (so
  often that the 'recording angel' must have more than plenty of that
  gramophonic bleat in store) &mdash; "Never, no never again!"</p>

  <p>But he will do it again. He will do it, in some form or other, the first
  moment that the risk looks profitable. Nothing less than wisdom, that has so
  grown from within that it has become identified with the individual, will
  save him from forever trying the impossible; and, in the end, he is better
  off should his attempts to avoid the law of individual responsibility meet
  disaster at the outset; because 'nothing succeeds like success' in convincing
  a man that his mistakes are wise, and the longer he seems able to avoid the
  law without distress to himself, the harder it will be for him to learn when
  the inevitable consequence begins to function, and the greater the distress
  will be. Failure in the early stages of an error is good fortune in
  disguise.</p>

  <p>That is only an example on the most objective plane, where it is easiest
  to understand it. The Law, that as we sow we reap, is universal; it is
  everywhere, and it applies to everything and to everybody. It governs all the
  consequences of the most elusive and abstract thinking, as well as the effect
  of a blow struck in anger and the mixing of selected chemicals. Cause and
  effect are one, and they cannot be separated, although time, which is the
  mother of delusions, frequently persuades us that they can be.</p>

  <p>Every individual is finally and unavoidably responsible for his own acts.
  Being causes, they set up consequences, that in turn become causes and bring
  endless chains of consequences in their wake; and for every one of those the
  originator must inevitably answer, at some time, in some place. It becomes
  easy to realize that the conditions we must meet in future lives depend
  entirely on performances in this life and the lives behind us, although no
  human brain can understand more than a fraction of the intricacies and
  adjustments of the Law of Karma.</p>

  <p>A little thinking &mdash; a little facing of the facts without seeking to
  force them to fit time-rooted prejudices &mdash; brings to the surface the
  delightfully contenting knowledge that our problems are our own; that we have
  nobody to blame except ourselves, and no acts but our own to answer for, in
  the ultimate analysis. Hundreds of thousands &mdash; millions &mdash; of
  people have dimly realized that fact, and have sought to apply it; but,
  because they have only dimly realized one aspect of it, they have fallen
  headlong into selfishness, assuring themselves that the Law reads 'I come
  first.'</p>

  <p>But whoever adopts that policy of selfishness will find himself degraded
  to a plane of consciousness on which, in self-defense, all others will be
  quite as selfish as himself; just as he who adopts a policy of unselfish
  usefulness will eventually find himself promoted to a plane on which his
  fellow-men will act unselfishly toward him. Nor are these far-away planes, to
  be reached in future incarnations or avoided by some superstitious
  supplications to an 'unknown God.' They are nearer than breathing; they are
  closer than hands and feet. They are here, immediately ready, and as easy to
  attain to, or to tumble down into, as a cold bath or the measles.</p>

  <p>So a selfish policy is not the remedy for any process of unwisdom. Like
  creating like, and action bringing its exactly measured consequences to the
  doer, it is clear, when we have once been bold enough to face facts, that we
  cannot help anyone by trying to help him to do the impossible: that is to
  say, by trying to help him to succeed in error or to avoid the consequences
  to himself of his own unwisdom. In that respect we have enough to do to keep
  our own course straight amid the massed perplexities our own unwisdom has
  produced. If we associate ourselves with his unwisdom we become identified
  with it and, however self-righteously contenting the emotion that impels us,
  all that we succeed in doing is to add to the amount of trouble in the world,
  of which there is already quite enough without our interference.</p>

  <p>Our business is to <i>reduce</i> the amount of trouble; and there is one
  royal way, but only one, in which that possibly may be accomplished. All
  other ways are vanity and a delusion.</p>

  <p>A simple illustration will suggest the real process and convey a hint of
  its infallibility: suppose a fleet of ships to be sailing toward one
  destination. Some of them are keeping a correct course; others are diverging
  toward rocks and shoals, with which the course is limited on both sides.
  There is an adverse current, but each ship has sufficient power, and a little
  over, to force itself against the wind and tide; each is supplied with charts
  and is in charge of a navigator, whose duty is to bring his ship to port.</p>

  <p>What would happen if the ships that are on the proper course should
  diverge from it in order to head the others in the right direction? Or if
  they should stop their engines and lose headway in order that their captains
  might argue the point with the other captains who were heading for the
  shoals? The probability of disaster, of course, would simply be increased,
  and nobody would be the gainer by it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, suppose that the captains who were on the proper
  course, and who <i>knew</i> they were, having taken all the seamanlike
  precautions, should call attention to the direction they were taking and
  should 'carry on,' they would be doing their full duty, by giving clear
  warning of the danger to the others, and by showing the course where safety
  lay.</p>

  <p>Life is not so different from that, that we cannot profit by the
  illustration. There are, of course, and for instance, schoolmasters whose
  duty is to go long ways, and drastically now and then, in interference with
  the navigation of the frail barks with which the young begin life's journey;
  but even they find that example is the most efficient remedy for error, and
  that constant fault-finding not only deadens the beginner's alertness but
  deprives him of capacity for self-direction. They do not find it profitable
  to do a pupil's duty for him.</p>

  <p>And there are extremes to which unselfishness may rightly go in rescuing
  those who have met disaster, provided that it truly is unselfishness and not
  self-righteousness, or a craving for self-advertisement, or the prospect of
  possible reward that gives the impulse. There are men and women whose very
  presence in the world uplifts it, so endowed by Nature with compassion for
  all suffering and all hopelessness that it becomes their duty to plunge into
  the stream of events and make other people's business theirs. Such was H. P.
  Blavatsky. But then that quality of true compassion that possessed her, had
  its natural corollary of wisdom, so that she could do the right thing, at the
  right time, in the right place. Wisdom provided foresight, and she knew full
  well what consequences her brave altruism would inevitably bring down on
  herself; and, aware in advance of the slander and the persecution that would
  be her lot, she took her course deliberately, gallantly, surrendering her own
  peace for a lifetime solely that the coming generations might be
  benefited.</p>

  <p>Privileges such as hers were must be earned; and they cannot be earned by
  talking, or by meddling with other people's duty. No man knows how many lives
  were spent by H. P. Blavatsky in mastering the measureless experience that
  made her fit to undertake the work she did. And no man knows the tenth of
  what she suffered in one lifetime, which she might have lived at ease, in
  enjoyment of wealth and an unchallenged reputation. Neither is it possible
  for anyone to measure her reward, because those who are incapable of doing
  what she did are equally incapable of guessing at the heights she climbed by
  the unsparing use of all her spiritual gifts. Those who work for reward are
  not those who receive it, because its nature is beyond their comprehension;
  all the higher spheres of influence are kept for those who do not seek them,
  but who strive to serve in order that they may learn to serve more
  usefully.</p>

  <p>Service does not consist in doing other people's duty for them, but in so
  well finishing one's own that there is nothing of it left to burden others;
  in such painstaking exercise of self-control that not a creature can be
  injured by our lapses; in such alert and patient progress on the narrow way
  that leads between ambition and neglect, that we may lead no fellow-pilgrim
  off the Path. For it is very much less harmful in the long run to ourselves,
  to bring disaster on ourselves, than to imperil others.</p>

  <p>Danger is a grim word, fraught with meaning. The danger in another's duty
  is as grim and sure as that which we know we run if we neglect our own. The
  fact is, that we cannot do another's duty and our own as well, and the
  attempt to prove the contrary entails neglect and oversight, which are the
  source of half our difficulties and of most of our delay along the Path of
  Evolution. The desire to do another's duty very often is a masked form of
  intolerance or pride; as often, it conceals a mean scorn for another's
  weakness; sometimes, it is tyranny, grimacing in the cloak of kindness. It is
  never quite unselfish for at best it robs another of an opportunity.</p>

  <p>The weird, illogical, and blind belief that one short life is all there is
  of us, is a delusion, under which in one form or another all the nations of
  the world succumb to hopelessness, or struggle onward in a false hope that
  some whim of an incomprehensible Destiny may show them a life better worth
  the living after death shall have imposed the final irony on this one.</p>

  <p>Stultified by this delusion and obsessed by the impossible ambition to
  compress Eternity's whole panorama into one short earth-life, men grow mad,
  ascribing all their own discomfort to their fellow-men's iniquity. They seek
  to make themselves more comfortable by controlling and compelling others.
  They quote what have been said to be the words of Jesus &mdash; "Do unto
  others as ye would that others should do unto you "; but they neglect to bear
  in mind that other equally profound and simple caution &mdash; "Let your
  light so shine that <i>they</i> may see your good works." Duty, in this age
  and generation, has become a synonym for making other men do what we
  ignorantly think is theirs, in order that we may feel self-righteous, or may
  live more lazily, or possibly that we may get to heaven on the wings of other
  men's behavior.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for anyone to understand another's duty, let alone to do
  it. Before we can qualify to sit in judgment of a fellow-man's neglect, or of
  his ignorance, or of his ill-will, we must first attain to the ability to see
  the whole of the procession of preceding lives that he has lived, and then so
  wisely weigh the interlacing causes and effects of myriads of years that not
  a single one escapes us.</p>

  <p>A sneer at that statement is about the only recourse left to those who
  cling to the delusion named above that has brought the world to its present
  pass. But the sneer will not answer the charge that whoever sits in judgment
  on a fellow-man, or dares to try to do another's duty, or who makes claim to
  be better than his fellow, mocks himself and makes himself ridiculous; for
  either he asserts impossible ability to see the whole procession of past
  lives, and boasts of sufficient wisdom to review and weigh them all, or else
  he impudently claims to judge without the facts which hardly the most
  arbitrary God invented by the stupidest of men would think of doing!</p>

  <p>Let him who knows exactly whence he came, and whither he is going, and can
  prove it, pass such judgments as he sees fit; let him do another's duty if he
  has the time. For the rest of us, who immeasurable this life as but an
  interlude between eternities, in which an endless chain of lives supplies us
  with the changing circumstance and the environment we need in which to work
  out our own spiritual progress, there is only just exactly time enough to
  attain our own self-mastery, and no time at all to spare for criticizing
  others.</p>

  <p>To attempt to do another's duty is an act of criticism. It implies an
  assertion of omniscience. It is an arrogant and ignorant concession to the
  self-esteem that flatters us that we are better than our neighbor, and more
  wise. Carried to its ultimate, it leads to a confusion of responsibility. The
  seeds of war are sown when any nation starts to interfere with the duty or
  the privileges of another; none will gainsay that. But we are prone to
  overlook the fact that nations are but congeries of individuals, and that the
  same eternal Laws apply to all of us.</p>

  <p>In one sense, and in only one, are we responsible for our neighbor's duty.
  He has his rights, and they are neither more nor less than ours. It follows
  that our duty toward him includes our giving him full room and opportunity to
  attend to his own affairs, while we attend to our own so thoroughly as not to
  interfere with him and not to leave neglected details for him to clean up
  after us.</p>

  <p>There is an everyday expression which betrays the common attitude toward
  life and its problems and lays bare the roots of the ridiculous philosophy
  with which the greater part of what we call the civilized world today
  endeavors to console itself. "Life is too short for that!" We have all heard
  it. Most of us have used the phrase at one time or another. But the truth is,
  Life is too long for anything but strict attention to our duty and a generous
  permission to the other man to do his.</p>

  <p>If all we had to live was one life &mdash; three score years and ten
  &mdash; there might be something in the theory that life is much too short
  for anything except enjoyment; and that if another does not do his duty, then
  we may do it for him in order to enjoy immediate comfort of mind or body. But
  even the Psalmist, who sang of three score years and ten, sang also that "a
  thousand years are but a moment." Life is so long &mdash; so eternally,
  incalculably long &mdash; that there is time for every act, however
  apparently insignificant, to reach its full fruition; and there is time for
  us to meet &mdash; to be compelled to meet and be compelled to deal with
  &mdash; all the consequences of the acts that we ourselves commit.</p>

  <p>We see around us all the evidence of rebirth, ceaselessly progressing.
  There are sermons in the stones, and running brooks, and trees. The very
  nestling, newly hatched, knows whence to expect its food. The tree knows how
  to grow as soon as it bursts forth in darkness from the seed. Who taught it?
  Where did it learn the trick of thrusting upward to the light, and how does
  it know the light is there? Ourselves, possessed of habits that were never
  taught us since we came adventuring into this short span of years between a
  cradle and the grave, live, move, and have our being amid circumstances and
  conditions that we know intuitively how to deal with. Is it possible, or by
  any thinking mind conceivable, that we could conduct ourselves as men and
  women without accumulated stores of past experience on which to base our
  judgment of events as they arise? It is insanity to base our estimate of life
  and its recurrent problems on the proofless, blind assumption that we have
  but one short earth-life in which to make our whole experience.</p>

  <p>What then is the danger in another's duty? This: that every injustice
  brings its retribution on the perpetrator. It is not just to deprive another
  of the opportunity to work out his experience. And it is unjust to ourselves
  to rob ourselves by interfering with another, thus misusing time and
  opportunity that might have been applied to our own problem. So to do
  another's duty entails two injustices, and we will have to meet the
  consequence of both, at some time or another, in this earth-life or another,
  and then we will have to devote both time and energy to the solution of a
  difficulty that would certainly have been avoided had we sooner learned the
  art and the necessity of minding our own business.</p>

  <p>Minding our own business is the all-important principle of living. We are
  what we are &mdash; a nuisance to our neighbors very often, and a danger and
  obstruction to ourselves. It is becoming what we can become that is our duty
  to our fellow-man; and by becoming better than we are, and better able, from
  constant practice, to mind our own business wisely, we can become of
  increasing benefit to ourselves, our neighbor, our nation, the world, and the
  universe. By trying to do others' duty, we can only go from bad to worse.</p>

  <p>Duty is that which is due &mdash; not that which we think, perhaps, may
  possibly be due before long. Duty, like ourselves, exists in the eternal Now.
  It is at hand, immediate, in front of us, invariably simple; and it sometimes
  takes the form of opportunity to learn a little self-control by refraining in
  thought or word or deed from interference with another.</p>

  <p>It must be clear to the most immature human intelligence that no man can
  be helpful, or anything except a burden to his fellows, until he has acquired
  the art of orderly self-government. It follows, that our first duty at all
  times and in any set of circumstances is to control ourselves and so make
  sure that, whatever else, at all events we do not add to the inharmony around
  us. It sometimes happens then, although not nearly so often as our vanity
  would like to persuade us, that after we have exercised our utmost
  self-control, so giving wisdom opportunity to function, there is just a
  little surplus left that we may safely offer to the other fellow; but even
  so, the wisdom born of self-control, will oblige us to make the offer very
  diffidently. Wisdom will remind us that we are ignorant of many of the facts,
  and possibly of nearly all of them.</p>

  <p>Briefly, our whole duty to our neighbor may be summed up in one sentence
  of four words: "Mind your own business." Business is that which ought to keep
  us busy, even if it does not. If it does not, then our duty is to find out
  why, and to remedy the failure by giving business more strict attention. That
  which ought to keep us busy is the instant and unceasing task of learning how
  to regulate and improve our own character, forever watchful of results as
  evidenced by deeds, and to the one end that we may become more useful by
  becoming more spiritual.</p>

  <p>The only influence that we should dare to exercise is that which comes
  from spiritual progress. And <i>that</i> is automatic. It requires no
  exercise of brain, and no self-assertion to exert the uplifting beneficence
  of spirituality. In fact, on the contrary, self-assertion is a gross
  impediment that not only makes us stumble in our effort but assumes far
  greater proportions, in the eyes of the beholder, than those spiritual
  qualities that we propose to advertise. There is nothing more insulting to
  one's neighbor or more stultifying to oneself than conduct based on a
  self-flattering claim of spiritual superiority. The moment that we feel
  ourselves superior to others is the time, of all others, when we most need
  self-control &mdash; and then self-criticism &mdash; and then drastic
  self-direction, bearing well in mind that there are countless future lives in
  which to meet in full the consequences of the positive and negative
  commissions and omissions made in this one.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of it all is this: that we are here to learn, not how to do
  our neighbor's duty, but to do our own &mdash; not for our own advantage, but
  for that of others. The only real blessing we can offer to our fellow-men is
  self-improvement, to the end that we may not increase inharmony but may
  exercise an honest, pure, uplifting influence. The basis of all spiritual
  progress is in self-examination and self-watchfulness. The proof of it
  consists in deeds that do no injury, depriving no man of his right to equal
  room and unhampered liberty along the Path of Progress.</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, August 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">A CERTAIN sort of modern scientist is fond of
  describing the human race as animals, and from his own point of view, which
  is as circumscribed by material limitations as a frog's at the bottom of a
  well, he may be right; but he might just as well, and just as logically,
  describe animals as men. In fact, the animals might be the better for it
  &mdash; might receive a more intelligent consideration and more mercy from
  <i>homo sapiens,</i> who is seldom as wise as the pundits of materialism
  flatter themselves that he is.</p>

  <p>From the viewpoint of the sheer materialist, who weighs a dying man to
  prove that life has no weight whatever and therefore that soul does not
  exist, there <i>is</i> no soul and evolution is a blind, mechanical
  procession of events that follows undiscoverable laws with no comprehensible
  purpose except to develop what must ultimately be destroyed. And if we accept
  that view there remains but one mystery: why should anyone trouble himself to
  continue living, or &mdash; if we cannot quite force ourselves to such flat
  depths of cynicism &mdash; why not eat, drink, and be immoral, since tomorrow
  or the next day we must disintegrate into unthinking atoms?</p>

  <p>There are strange inconsistencies in human nature, and particularly in
  scientific human nature, which are easy to immeasurable but very difficult to
  understand. For instance, one and the same intensely educated biologist will
  speak of the 'blind laws' of nature with as fanatical conviction as the
  out-of-date enthusiast's who used to speak of everlasting hellfire; but
  almost in the same breath he will boast of his own will that differentiates
  him from the common run of men and makes it possible for him to force his
  tired brain and his exhausted body in the search after new discoveries. He is
  willing to divide his neighbors into classes and to publish statistics, which
  are alleged to prove that about nine-tenths of the human race are his mental
  inferiors; but he denies that there is any spiritual basis for his theory,
  and he shuts his eyes deliberately to that very "will" and "will not," which
  in practice have made his life-work possible.</p>

  <p>The average nature-lover, much better than the most expert analytical
  naturalist, knows what an animal will or will not do in given circumstances.
  The differences between the species and genera are much more evident in their
  behavior than in conformation or in structural anatomy; they have evolved up
  to a certain point, and at that point they function, always in the same way,
  always in obedience to the law of their kind. Their will, which is their
  state of consciousness, obliges them to respond in certain ways to given
  circumstances; and when one animal &mdash; as a dog, for instance, or an
  elephant &mdash; evolves a disposition to act differently from the rest, that
  individual's state of consciousness is changing, usually to a slightly higher
  level. Then, there being no exception possible to law, it follows that
  exception must become law; the level to which one member of the species has
  attained becomes possible to all that species, and evolution takes one step
  forward. Thenceforward the "I will" and "I will not" of all that species has
  one less limitation. Example being more contagious than disease, it is only a
  matter of time before the ability of the one becomes the law &mdash; the will
  &mdash; the state of consciousness of the entire species.</p>

  <p>It is so with men, but with this difference: that men have reached the
  stage of evolution in which it is possible for them to become aware of it and
  consciously to direct its progress. Animals evolve unconsciously, the lower
  species hardly more aware of what compels them than the trees are, or the
  rocks and rivers. The higher mammals very often are aware of spiritual
  forces, although only for short periods, amid surroundings and in
  circumstances that provide the necessary stimulus; and although they give
  every evidence then to a discerning observer of being conscious of unseen
  powers whose presence thrills them, they rarely, if ever, appear to change in
  character in consequence.</p>

  <p>My own observation suggests, in fact, the contrary. A lion is never so
  much a lion as when he has stood for a few minutes staring into infinity,
  motionless, absorbed in contemplation of the unseen. At such moments his
  normally keen senses appear to be in a state of suspended function; he can
  neither hear the sounds that usually alarm him, smell the scents that
  normally enrage him, nor see what should make him suspicious, were his purely
  animal consciousness alert. He is alert to something else, and in another
  way. For a moment he seems aware of the divinity of everything that lives and
  breathes, and of his own place in the universe.</p>

  <p>On many such occasions I have had the opportunity to watch lions in the
  open, when the weather, his own vitality, and every other circumstance was in
  the lion's favor, giving him nothing to think about but the satisfaction of
  being alive. In such moments the very spirit of pantheism seems expressed,
  and that wonderful old psalm comes to mind in which the singer adjures: "O
  all ye beasts, praise ye the Lord; praise him and magnify him forever."</p>

  <p>The moment passes, and the lion always roars &mdash; roars as if a glimpse
  of the reality of things has thrilled him to the marrow &mdash; roars and
  roars &mdash; and then reasserts the animal. He is dangerous then. It is as
  if, in the words of the Bible, the flesh lusteth against the spirit. He
  reverts to blind laws and the lion's will, which is to go in search of what
  he may devour and to slay because he can.</p>

  <p>It is the same with wolves. Sometimes, particularly toward evening in fine
  weather, when they have eaten and slept and played, so that they feel in the
  pink of condition and their senses are in harmony, they seem to grow
  conscious of another element. Usually one wolf feels it first, and howls; but
  the howl is an entirely different note from the hunting-call. Each wolf in
  turn takes it up until they all howl in chorus, putting all their heart into
  the music. No observer then, unless afraid, or so prejudiced that he is
  incapable of recognizing anything except what he has been told he should
  expect, could mistake that chorus for the usual wolf-cry. It is more like an
  evening hymn. They throw up their throats and take extraordinary pains to
  pitch on exactly the right quarter-tone. They are doing something they enjoy,
  and for the sake of doing it &mdash; something that is neither play nor work
  &mdash; an ecstasy.</p>

  <p>They are not wolves while they are doing that, but a conscious part of
  Nature, one with all the rocks and trees and rivers, one with the wind and
  the twilight, one with Life itself. But it is only for short moments that
  they can hold to that realization; then they are wolves again, and dangerous,
  asserting their condition and the fang and claw with which they hold such
  sway in the forest as is theirs by right of evolution.</p>

  <p>It is only man who can explain to himself what such ecstatic moments mean
  and can direct himself in order consciously to profit by them. And that is
  why it is unfair and ignorant to label man an animal, and why, the less a man
  regards himself as animal, the swifter his advancement to the higher planes
  of consciousness. We all are spiritual &mdash; rocks and trees and rivers,
  wind and weather, stars &mdash; birds, reptiles, beasts; we all evolve; we
  all work out our destiny exactly from the point at which we stand; but the
  dividing chasm between man and animal is greater than that between animal and
  tree, because man alone is able to be conscious of the Soul that guides
  him.</p>

  <p>The animal's "I will" is an obedience to the law of his existence that he
  heeds but does not understand. He is a lion or a sheep, a wolf or a hyena;
  evolution is directed for him and he spends his life in being what he is,
  without a discernible trace of will to become something higher. Unless
  compelled, as a few rare individuals know how to compel, he shows no
  disposition to imitate anything higher than himself, or even to immeasurable
  that there is any higher condition than his own. His will is to be wolf or
  sheep or lion, and to make the most of that, adapting himself as best he can
  to changing conditions. His "I will not" is his unwillingness to change
  himself &mdash; his inability to do it.</p>

  <p>Man's "I will" is all too often no more than the animal's expression of
  desire. His "I will not" descends too often, and particularly when the
  individual surrenders to the mean massed instinct of the mob, to the plane on
  which all consciousness of self-direction ceases and, in common with the
  vegetables, he exists within his senses and self-rooted to the earth. In such
  moods men are not superior to animals, but worse, and for this reason: that
  whoever once has felt within himself and recognized the working of the Higher
  Law, thereafter is responsible; and he who lets that feeling of
  responsibility escape him or be crowded out by swinishness and greed commits
  sin. It is impossible to sin without a consciousness of what sin means.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, a man's "I will," if he shall have the right to call himself
  a man and to enjoy man's heritage, must entail some higher object than the
  mere expression of his appetite or his ambition to impose his own desires on
  others. As an animal, man is a weakling so inferior in strength and obstinacy
  to the ass, for instance, that no comparison is possible between them. Man's
  intelligence, if set to perform the asses' labor in the asses' way, still
  leaves him so inferior to the beast that mere economy would give the ass a
  higher market value. It is in a man's unwillingness to be an ass, to be
  described as one, to be made to work as one, that the hint of his way of
  salvation lies.</p>

  <p>The meanest man, at intervals at any rate, is conscious of his manhood and
  aware of a compelling force within himself (he calls it 'conscience' oftener
  than not) that drives him to remorse, and through remorse to self-
  improvement. Then his "I will" strikes a nobler key, no longer flatted by
  disgusting appetite but thrilling with authority. He has accepted man's
  responsibility &mdash; the privilege of self-direction. Self-control and
  self-improvement follow, and the "I will not" falls like a sword into his
  right hand &mdash; a sword that points every way.</p>

  <p>And "I will not" is equally important with "I will." The animal within a
  man is stirred by every evidence of strengthened will. The "I will not"
  restrains it, and converts the animal emotion into higher forms of energy. No
  latter-day condition is more noticeable and productive of bewilderment than
  that increasing education and intelligence bring with them an increasing
  animality and cleverness in crime; but that is because "thou shalt not" has
  been allowed to substitute for "I will not," paternalism (of a sad, short-
  sighted kind) stalking stupidly where individual responsibility should be the
  first law of the land and the first concern of educators.</p>

  <p>An man who has responded to the Soul-note in himself (his conscience, if
  you will) and has deliberately set his face toward the future and the light,
  has felt &mdash; perhaps instantly &mdash; in some degree increasing
  influence upon his fellow men. They begin to regard his word and to accord
  him the beginnings of authority, most often without knowing why they do it,
  because few men pause to analyze and to dissect their own reasons for this
  and that attitude. And if the truth could be set down in cold statistics (we
  are fortunate, perhaps, to be spared that mathematical indictment of a whole
  race!) we might be staggered by the revelation of what follows; our belief in
  human nature would need readjusting drastically before we could resume that
  buoyant optimism that we need in daily life.</p>

  <p>Let each man analyze himself. Let each discover for himself the need for
  constant watchfulness. Our memories are not for nothing. There are few of us
  who need to look back more than one day down the line of zigzag and sporadic
  evolution to discover that each time we have been conscious of a forward
  step, however short, our lower nature instantly has sought to take advantage
  of it, causing us, subtly perhaps, to use the opportunity for
  self-aggrandizement.</p>

  <p>I remember a black man who set himself deliberately to improve his moral
  status. The effort was easy to immeasurable, and the result was obvious,
  although only he knew what extremes of self-denial it had cost him. He had
  left his native village, as he told me. (He was born in a village of thieves,
  where murder was considered bravery, and it was a Sikh skin-trader who first
  suggested to him higher standards of morality.)</p>

  <p>In course of time he came to the attention of a high government official,
  who employed him and, finding him diligent, caused him to be enlisted in the
  police force, in which he began with such a splendid record in his favor that
  he was placed in positions of trust much sooner than was usual with recruits.
  His "I will" was as ready as the knife he used to wield in the old days in
  his native village; discipline seemed second nature to him, and his influence
  among the raw recruits enlisted later than himself was excellent. His "I will
  not," however, had not kept pace, and the feel of the new-found influence
  went like wine to his head. He became a bully, and from that went on to
  mutiny; and the last I knew of him he was a member of the chain-gang,
  cleaning township streets.</p>

  <p>Now human nature varies only in degree. As long as we are humans we are
  subject to the laws that govern human life and conduct. What is possible to
  one is possible to everyone, and the degree of our advancement can be
  measured solely by the strength or weakness of our individual self-control.
  Unlike the animals, we have the power of self-direction; we may exercise our
  will in the deliberate judgment of ourselves by spiritual standards,
  steadfastly aspiring to new levels of discretion, sturdily rejecting all
  inducements to descend again on to the lower plane on which the animal
  controls us.</p>

  <p>The secret of success is balance. We are all familiar with characters who
  shine with a resplendent genius and lack, nevertheless, that moral stamina
  that challenges respect. The jails are full of them. The most of them lack
  balance &mdash; lack the "I will not" to serve as counterweight and regulator
  to "I will." Without "I will" we never may attain to that self-government
  that is our goal, nor ever may evolve into such consciousness as can conceive
  self-government throughout a universe. Without the "I will not" we never can
  escape from the attraction of the lower nature, which provides us with an
  infinite variety of opportunities to resubmerge ourselves into its depths for
  every forward spiritual step we take.</p>

  <p>The Middle Way &mdash; Theosophy &mdash; lies midway between animal
  ambition and the subtler maze of spiritual pride. A man needs balance more
  than any other faculty, if he would keep the true course, and the surest aid
  to learning balance is a sense of humor that enables one to laugh at his own
  erratic judgment and, instead of pitying himself, to pity others whom his own
  mistakes may have misled. There is no more certain prelude to a fall than
  self-approval; self-condemnation and self-pity are such dead-weights as the
  strongest cannot bear upward; but a sense of humor is no burden. The ability
  to laugh at one's own flounderings, and above all to laugh at one's own
  claims to superiority above his fellow men, is a magic talisman that costs
  nothing, weighs nothing, and occupies no space. Unlike those patent medicines
  that they used to sell to travelers, it really cures all ills and is
  available in every accident.</p>

  <p>It is the lack of any sense of humor that has darkened all religion until
  men fight and go to law about past participles and the dull, dead letter of a
  printed creed. Paul the Apostle, who did more than any man to compose and
  formulate the religion since called Christianity, was no apostle of self-
  righteousness and gloom. One can imagine how he laughed and how he tapped his
  own breast when he voiced that famous phrase "the evil which I would not,
  that I do!" And doubtless he would laugh (and at himself) if he could hear
  the din of the debates over his phrases that have kept men quarreling among
  themselves for nineteen hundred years. Paul had sufficient sense of humor to
  preserve himself from bishoprics and too much praise; he earned his own
  living as a tent-maker; he laid no claim to be immune from limitations and
  obsessions that beset the rest of us, and he foresaw the evil that he might
  do while attempting the great benefit he would.</p>

  <p>So, whether we agree with the Apostle Paul in all his teachings, or agree
  to disagree with him, we may admire the manliness that made him immeasurable
  his own humanity and saved him from the mire of self-esteem, into which too
  many of the world's would-be reformers have slid headlong. Thus far we all
  may follow him, conceding our intention to do well by all the world but
  laying no claim to infallibility, our sense of humor coming to our aid to
  save us from self-praise &mdash; such heady stuff that, balance we like
  Blondin, we should nevertheless lose footing if the least whiff of it were
  allowed to poison the immediate air.</p>

  <p>"I will" and "I will not" are grand assertions. They include the whole of
  man's prerogatives; and neither is complete without the other. The infinite
  immensity of will, forever broadening as man ascends by purifying and
  controlling his own character, reveals such realms to revel in as blind and
  dazzle or bewilder at the first glimpse. Power not subject to restraint
  &mdash; power even over oneself, without the sanity that shall restrain and
  guide it &mdash; is madness, self-destroying and destructive of all else that
  meets it while its short-lived frenzy lasts.</p>

  <p>Power over oneself can be attained, and must be, before progress becomes
  possible. But it is power held in trust and the least abuse of it is treason
  to the Soul &mdash; rank sacrilege. "I will" is an expression of the
  consciousness of power. "I will not" is born of the determination never to
  betray the trust that power imposes.</p>

  <p>So the two go hand in hand, the will to become one with our Higher Nature
  and the Higher Law being balanced and restrained by will not to offend or
  injure. Therein lies the difference between man and animal-man, if he is
  worthy of the name of man, evolving character and race, and laying down his
  destiny, by serving others first, himself last &mdash; the animal
  unconsciously obeying laws that seem to him to legalize the theory of self
  first.</p>

  <p>Animals, in fact, are far from selfish, because their very instinct to
  protect themselves is based on laws beyond their comprehension that oblige
  them to protect their offspring and the herd and, consequently, all their
  ways are suitably conditioned to the state of consciousness at which they
  have arrived. Nature guides them.</p>

  <p>Man is his own guide. He has attained to spiritual consciousness and may,
  and can, if he sees fit, take cognizance of spiritual laws and by their aid
  advance to higher spiritual knowledge, benefiting all humanity and all life
  less advanced than he is, not by self-assertion but by vigilant
  self-government that requires each thought and act to be unselfish and
  constructive. Man, if he will be man, not a major animal, will &mdash; must
  &mdash; live, and alone may live, by spiritual service.</p>

     name="ref25">THE MAYA MYSTERY &mdash; YUCATAN</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, December 1924</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">ONE must search the pages of The Secret Doctrine for
  true light on the history of Yucatan. The Mayas &mdash; latter-day
  descendants of the ancient Itza civilization &mdash; themselves preserve a
  myth, much scoffed at by historians and referred to by the guide-book writers
  in the smallest print, to the effect that the hero-god Itzamna brought their
  ancestors through the ocean from the east. The thought of the tourist leaps
  at once to submarines; he laughs. To others, not so eager to class myth as
  mere absurdity, there occurs at once the story of lost Atlantis.</p>

  <p>The Yucatan Peninsula is one vast plain, with an area of nearly a hundred
  thousand square miles, largely covered with dense jungle and virgin forests,
  and it is nowhere more than five hundred feet above sea-level. With the
  exception of enormous plantations of henequen-fiber, laid out comparatively
  recently, there is very little cultivation, owing mainly to lack of surface-
  water, and the jungle might have continued unexplored for centuries to come
  were it not for manufacturers of chewing-gum, who send their agents into the
  forest in search of chicle, from which chewing-gum is made.</p>

  <p>These agents, mostly Mestizos, or half-castes (although some are pure
  Indian), occasionally bring news of great areas of ancient ruins, and it is
  to them in the first instance that almost every fresh discovery is due; but
  they are an uncommunicative breed, and very cautious in their dealings with
  the alien. From the purely Maya Indian one can learn almost absolutely
  nothing, his racial recollection of the conqueror's heel having closed his
  mind against inquisitors.</p>

  <p>That conqueror's heel, it may be added, was no imaginary infliction. La
  Casa del Conquistador Motejo still stands on the south side of the principal
  public square in Merida, the modern capital. It was the first house built by
  the Spanish conquerors and its facade bears the escutcheon of the Montejo
  family; on either side of the entrance, carved in stone and well preserved,
  are the figures of two Spanish knights, clad in the costume in vogue at the
  time of the conquest, each with his foot resting on the head of a conquered
  Maya India. That symbolizes well enough what Mayas have had to endure. There
  is not much room for doubt that they were suppressed, and by methods more
  drastic than we moderns fortunately can imagine. They have not yet re-arisen
  from the effects of it.</p>

  <p>The conqueror did not destroy the Maya buildings, as so often has been
  charged. There were extensive ruins all over Yucatan before the Spaniards
  came, and it seems probably that great areas had been abandoned to the jungle
  long before 1570, owing to lack of water, and possibly owing to a pestilence
  that may have followed in the wake of drought.</p>

  <p>There are practically no surface-streams, although there are considerable
  rivers that flow underground and find their way into the limestone caverns
  with which the whole country abounds. The principal water-supply is from rain
  preserved in natural cisterns, and it is easy to imagine how a prolonged
  period of drought may have forced the ancient inhabitants to abandon city
  after city.</p>

  <p>What the conquerors methodically did destroy was anything in writing or in
  sculpture that could help to connect the Mayas with their ancient culture and
  the storied past. So fanatically and so thoroughly did they obliterate
  whatever they regarded as unchristian, and therefore damnable, that though
  the Mayas possessed at that time (1527) an extensive literature, consisting
  mainly of historic records, in a script at a stage of development apparently
  about midway between pictograph and letter, not one document or carving now
  remains to provide a key for modern language-students. The agents of the
  church were 'thorough.' Scientists, comparatively easily, have worked out the
  system of numbers and dates, and they are continually searching for some
  carving &mdash; enthusiastically hoping for some document &mdash; that may
  explain the code in which the Maya narrative was written. But until now the
  history, myth, legend, and religion of the Mayas remains for the most part a
  forgotten mystery, in spite of square miles of monuments that have resisted
  time and weather &mdash; unless it is true, as some say, that among the
  Indians there are individuals who have preserved the record, handing it on
  from generation to generation, and who could tell the secret if they
  chose.</p>

  <p>It is certain that no area in the world possesses such a Wealth of
  archaeological antiquity as that part of Central America that includes the
  Yucatan Peninsula, Honduras, and Guatemala. There are expeditions from a
  number of scientific foundations and universities now studying the
  jungle-ruins at widely extended points, but those points are like proverbial
  drops of water in an ocean; there is such abundance of material that one
  point seems almost as good as any other at which to begin exploring, and
  there is no guessing where the most important secrets may be brought to
  light.</p>

  <p>It appears, from what already is uncovered, that the early Maya
  civilization &mdash; subsequent, that is, to the arrival of the Mayas from
  some continent that may have been Atlantis &mdash; had its beginnings in what
  is now called Guatemala, since it is there that are found carvings,
  photographs of which were long since published in The Theosophical Path, for
  November 1920, so ancient that few antiquarians have dared to assign a date
  to them.</p>

  <p>From Guatemala the Maya race seems gradually to have extended its
  civilization northward into Yucatan, the theme and nature of its monuments
  not changing much but rather evolving slowly toward greater elegance and less
  solidity, until, as far north as Chichen-Itza, about a hundred miles from
  Merida, we find well preserved buildings probably not more than three
  thousand years old, with beams of the time-resisting zapote-wood still
  supporting the stone arches.</p>

  <p>The Chichen-Itza ruins (the name is a Maya word meaning 'by the well of
  the Itzas') are on the site of the Maya or Itza capital. The well, or cenote,
  remains &mdash; a huge, natural pool in the limestone rock, fed by
  underground springs of extremely cold water that takes on a peculiar
  jade-green color. Ever since the arrival of the Spaniards that sacred well
  has been the center of romantic legends about maidens sacrificed to the
  rain-god, and prisoners of war permitted rather than obliged to sacrifice
  themselves by plunging in and drowning. (They say, though, that the principle
  of mercy was not wholly overlooked: whoever lived from dawn to sunset on the
  surface of the pool was rescued and allowed to live.) Unlike most legends,
  these have been checked up and in a large degree confirmed by M. E.H.
  Thompson, formerly U.S. Consul in Yucatan, who has spent the last thirty
  years in carefully exploring Chichen-Itza and its neighborhood.</p>

  <p>Mr. Thompson procured a diving apparatus and spent, in all, more than a
  month under-water, stirring deep layers of mud with a rake, uncovering
  treasures of gold and a peculiar jade found nowhere else on earth, besides
  the bones of young women and warriors. A peculiarity about the jade is, not
  only that its source is unknown (for nothing like it has been found in
  Central America or elsewhere) but that every piece of it is broken, as if the
  priests, who performed the sacrifice, went through the form of releasing its
  spirit before, as it were, consigning its material shell to oblivion.</p>

  <p>Whoever has studied Maya architecture and such fragments as are known of
  their ancient religion, is impressed by the marked resemblance to the ancient
  Egyptian culture. It is in the pages of The Secret Doctrine that one finds
  the key to this enigma, and, supposing it to be true that the originators of
  Maya and Egyptian culture came, before the period of any history we know,
  from one and the same continent, we might reasonably expect to find a
  parallel development.</p>

  <p>We know, for instance, that the culture of ancient Egypt passed through
  cycles of adolescence, splendor, and decay. In course of time pure doctrine
  became corrupted as men ceased to aspire to the higher mysteries. What once
  had been a hierarchy was replaced by an ambitious priesthood; and the
  sacrifices that had once been imagery of the opulence of life became degraded
  into superstitious rites.</p>

  <p>Why not the same in Yucatan? This key would fit the latter-day discoveries
  of bones and jewels thrown into the sacred pool &mdash; barbaric practices
  that otherwise it is impossible to correlate with the unquestionably esoteric
  nature of the ancient Maya art. It is incredible that men who rose to such
  artistic heights that they designed those carvings and the caste, high arches
  of those dim interiors should condescend to drowning human victims to appease
  a wrathful rain-god. But it might be that, as in Egypt, men forgot the
  ancient Key. The hierarchy may have died out from below, for lack of
  aspirants with moral strength to endure the higher ordeals of the Mystery.
  And so, while buildings by the thousand stood, that traced the dignity and
  grandeur of the past; while pictograph and symbol still remained in witness
  that the men who built those temples knew more than the mere surface-secrets
  of an ancient Wisdom, a degenerate, though still religious offspring of the
  builders, taking letter for the spirit of the law, grew morbid and disgraced
  themselves with human sacrifice. If so, that would not be the first, nor yet
  the last, great culture to decay in the gloom of superstitious cruelty. It is
  at such times of spiritual decadence that races become helpless to defend
  themselves against the conqueror. Then hundreds, in the vigor of material
  expansion overwhelm with ease the hundred-thousands, who have lost their
  spiritual vision yet affect still to despise materiality on which, in fact,
  they lean. No nation in the growth or the maturity of spiritual grandeur is
  in danger from the sword of the aggressor. Witness China, that kept peace a
  thousand years. But let the vision cease and, like a tree whose sap no longer
  answers to the challenge of the sun, that nation totters to its fall.</p>

  <p>These latter days the Mayas, as a whole, display the symptoms of a
  conquered people. There is no revolt in them. They are a quiet-loving people,
  hospitable, kind, habitually clean, addicted to no outlandish vices &mdash;
  hardly even to the vices of their conquerors &mdash; and noticeably honest.
  But they submit. There is no vigor in their protests against exploitation.
  They take no part in the recurring revolutions that have boiled across the
  face of Mexico these fifty years. They are not soldiers; and with very rare
  exceptions they hold no public office. Courteous, secretive, patient,
  indifferent to hardship, they resemble in feature the images carved on the
  ruins that testify to the ancient glory of their race.</p>

  <p>Uxmal and Chichen-Itza, where the principal uncovered ruins are, though
  ages of neglect, of wind and weather and the inroads of the jungle have
  combined to blot them from the memory of man, still mutely vouch for the
  enlightenment and taste of their forgotten builders. Civilization was there,
  and at a pinnacle, when Rome, it may be, was a scattering of hovels and the
  splendors of Nineveh and Babylon were not yet dreamed of.</p>

  <p>Strange, and hitherto incomprehensible designs, wrought with consummate
  artistry, cover the whole face of building after building, alternating with
  elephants, leopards, leaves, flowers, and conventionalized human faces. Where
  did the ancient Mayas find their elephants? Who taught them how to carve with
  such unerring skill? If there was never an Atlantis, as some historians still
  insist, and if the arts, philosophy, and science, as the same historians
  maintain, derive from what they call the Old World &mdash; Rome, Greece,
  Egypt&mdash;whence came the Maya arts and sciences?</p>

  <p>The predominant character of all the larger ancient Maya structures is
  that they are built on artificial elevations: a pyramid or truncate cone,
  approached by magnificent stone stairs, supports a building that thus crowns
  the view, suggesting elemental dignity and a conception of life's grandeur.
  The walls are usually of tremendous thickness, so that the silence which
  today reigns over that unpeopled wilderness was more than probably essential
  to existence when the thinkers lived who wrought that artistry.</p>

  <p>Interiors are quiet, oftener than not devoid of any other contribution to
  their beauty than the sheer simplicity of strong design, but sometimes
  carved, like the exteriors, with hieroglyphic cornices or adorned with
  paintings that permit no other comparison than with those of ancient
  Egypt.</p>

  <p>The finest workmanship is displayed in the broad and elevated cornices;
  and whether the artists excelled more in the skill with which they assembled
  prodigious numbers of small pieces with which to construct their effect, or
  in the accuracy to nature of the scenes they represented, is a matter solely
  of opinion. Certainly their craftsmanship has never been surpassed on the
  American continent.</p>

  <p>The Mexican authorities have wisely ruled that no more plunder shall be
  taken from the ruins, and no foreign collections shall be enriched by
  specimens from Yucatan. Facilities are given to qualified archaeologists and
  to expeditions from foreign universities, who are allowed to fence off areas
  and dig, uncover, reconstruct; but what antiquities they find must remain in
  their proper surroundings, so that some day it will be possible to study the
  whole scheme of ancient Maya life and culture where it had its being.</p>

  <p>But the study of it is unlikely to lead men far until they search <i>The
  Secret Doctrine's</i> pages and so reconstruct the past and read it with the
  Key that H.P. Blavatsky provided. The world, men say, is full of mysteries;
  but far the greatest of them all, most baffling and least suggestive of
  intelligence in homo sapiens is this: that after fifty years, with <i>The
  Secret Doctrine</i> and <i>Isis Unveiled</i> almost anywhere obtainable, men
  still search blindly for a key with which to solve the riddles of the past.
  Men still deny the 'fable' of Atlantis &mdash; still search for the source of
  light among the shadows &mdash; and, when H.P. Blavatsky's authoritative
  statements month after month become confirmed, still prefer to ignore her
  teaching instead of making use of what she taught for the uncovering of
  more.</p>

     name="ref26">AN ANSWER TO CORRESPONDENTS</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, January 1925</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">I ADMIT it was a greatly daring editor who first
  published <i>OM</i> as a serial in <i>Adventure</i><i>,</i> a magazine which,
  though it stands for manliness, omits religious subjects as a rule. It was a
  daring firm of publishers who brought the story out in book-form last
  November. <i>OM</i> treats of a mystery that to one half of the world, the
  whole of the eastern hemisphere, is concrete fact, however many explanations
  of it may be current; whereas to the western half it sounds not mystery so
  much as a mere fairy-tale. And it is the western half of the world that buys
  books in English.</p>

  <p>However, both the magazine and the book publishers now admit that their
  daring must have been a sort of inspiration; while I, the author of the
  story, have been swamped under a mass of correspondence, to the greater part
  of which I have not yet had time to reply (and to none of it adequately).</p>

  <p>The amazing part of it is this: that among all of the hundreds of letters
  I have received about the book, not one finds fault with it. I had expected
  to be deluged with abuse and ridicule!</p>

  <p>I wrote the book from knowledge; but I did not know there were so many
  people in the western hemisphere not only willing but apparently quite eager
  to accept an explanation of life's handicap based solely on what Asia calls
  the Ancient Wisdom. I am almost tempted to believe &mdash; perhaps to hope
  &mdash; that prejudice and dogma are not after all so firmly seated on the
  throne of Christianity as the professional religionists would have us
  think.</p>

  <p>Has the world gone mad, that it accepts my book? Or is it waking up? Or am
  I dreaming? All I know is, that the book is being widely read. The answer
  must be left to wiser heads than mine.</p>

  <p>The East has known, for no man knows how many centuries, that there exist
  (and always have existed) individuals &mdash; known variously as the Keepers
  of the Ancient Wisdom, Teachers, Masters, Gurus &mdash; who, from philosophic
  heights attained by heroism of self-mastery in former lives, keep watch over
  the world, inspiring it, whenever opportunity presents itself, with pure,
  uplifting thought. These men (and they are men, not spirits) have attained to
  greater heights of evolution than the rest of us have glimpsed. They live
  apart from the world, and so have always lived since long before such history
  as we find recorded in the western text-books; and this, less from dread of
  defilement by the world's dense thinking than because of the uselessness of
  mingling with a crowd that crucifies, idolizes or prevents all teachers whom
  it fails to understand. On one point all who know of these men are agreed:
  that they are practical, and faithful to the vast responsibility entailed by
  knowing more than others know.</p>

  <p>I am reliably informed that at this present time the home of the Masters
  is in Tibet, that country being difficult of access and affording them the
  opportunity they need to think and move and have their being in an
  undisturbed calm, beneath whose unruffled surface they persist in pauseless
  effort to induce into the world high thinking and its consequences, purity of
  living; since through purity alone comes true enlightenment.</p>

  <p>But this may give a false impression of them. They are manly men, not
  meditative fakirs. Except that they are human they resemble not at all the
  popularity pursuing 'swamis,' self-styled 'mahatmas' or 'yogis' who posture
  on rocks for the plaudits of ignorant people &mdash; or who cross the
  Atlantic to pocket the dollars of fools. They do not advertise. They shun the
  fawning adulation of the mob as sedulously as they keep aloof from its
  vindictiveness and passion. To them, I have been told, all forms of
  selfishness appear ridiculous, since selfishness contains its own destroying
  agent, and to them there is no profit under the sun except in benefiting
  others.</p>

  <p>Their religion, as I understand it, recognizing thought as the precursor
  of all deed, and regulating thought as the precursor, consequently in the
  last analysis is wholly one of deeds and of abstaining from such deeds as
  might, by their inherent selfishness, destroy the harmony of others. No life
  like that could possibly be lived without more wisdom than is given to the
  ordinary run of men. None, surely, will deny that wisdom is a stark necessity
  if one is to discriminate between what benefits humanity at large and what
  does not. Reforms, 'revivals,' social crusades and all familiar attempts to
  legislate or wheedle nations into righteousness are self-destroyed inevitably
  by the lack of wisdom in their frequently too energetic advocates. It was
  Solomon, I think, who is supposed to have advised us to seek wisdom
  first.</p>

  <p>I have been told &mdash; and I believe it &mdash; that these Masters have,
  by high unselfishness and self-control in former lives, attained to higher
  wisdom than the rest of us can understand. If so, then we show less wisdom
  than we might, if we should challenge or resent their privilege of keeping to
  themselves. If they are so wise that in spite of all our modern methods of
  inquisitive research they can retain aloofness and can pass among us, when
  they so please, utterly unrecognized, it serves no useful purpose to deny
  their right to do so, or, in the alternative, to argue they do not exist.</p>

  <p>I can imagine (who cannot?) that multitudes of higher forms of life exist
  of which nine-tenths of us at present have no cognizance. But ignorance
  proves nothing. I am sure, for instance, that in every realm of art and
  science there are men innumerable who know more than I do, but my ignorance
  of what they know does not disprove their knowledge. Rather they serve as an
  avenue through which I may attain their knowledge, if I will.</p>

  <p>When we behold art, do we stultify our own intelligence by arguing that
  the artist knew no more than we? Or, because we have never seen the artist,
  do we deny that art exists? Or, because we see fraudulent copies of art, do
  we deny that there are many artists whose integrity is above dispute?</p>

  <p>Admitting as, for one, I do admit that there is high philosophy abroad
  among us, that is freshening our thought and working like precipitating acid
  on our outworn, half-abandoned creeds; maintaining that philosophy
  necessitates philosophers to bring it into being, as it were; and so
  admitting as, for one, I do admit, that the existence of the Masters is no
  myth but an established certainty; conceding at the same time, as we must,
  that if they do exist they must be wiser than the rest of us in order to
  escape the searchlight of our pitiless publicity (the name preferred by
  persecution-mongers); what avails then to pit our ignorance against their
  wisdom and insist, with the world at large, that they are non-existent or
  that they are selfish not to satisfy our curiosity by coming out of their
  seclusion and, with magic, entertaining us. Doubtless they know better than
  to do it &mdash; or do it they would. Theirs is the prerogative of
  wisdom.</p>

  <p>What is magic? It is certainly not humbug, though we know too well how
  many humbugs pose among us as magicians, in the same way that too many
  cacophonists claim the title of musician and too many doctors mutilate our
  bodies in the name of healing. The exposure of a thousand tricksters never
  has disproved one truth, though many a magician has been branded as a fraud
  because, for lack of enough wisdom, and perhaps because of vanity, he has
  displayed more knowledge of the esoteric laws of nature than the prejudices
  of the human mind permit to any man. Knowledge and wisdom are not the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>A century ago would radio not have been magic? What of Newton and his
  laws? And what of Galileo? Would our fathers have believed it possible to
  transmit by a mechanism, through the ether without wires, the pictures of
  events within a half-hour of their happening? Can there be any object other
  than to glorify our ignorance, in stubbornly denying that there might be men
  who know how to project their thought without the intervening agency of a
  machine?</p>

  <p>The handicap of all humanity is fear. We are afraid to lift ourselves
  above the ruts in which we run, and glance into the storehouse of the
  Infinite. A century ago (and less) it was religion under which we covered up
  our eyes and hugged our totally illogical conservatism. Now with flattery we
  fool ourselves that science has uncovered all laws and the portals of all
  knowledge. What the licensed and accredited observers of the shadows of the
  real say is true, we must believe or else be damned. And being damned by
  fellow-men is much more comfortless (because more real) than the hell our
  ancestors believed in!</p>

  <p>We are still, like the fabled ostrich with its head stuck in the sand,
  absurd conservatives, for we conserve not much else than our own opinion of
  ourselves &mdash; no pleasant one, at that, maintaining as it generally does
  that we were born in sin.</p>

  <p>But of the Masters I am told on good authority that they conserve the
  Ancient Wisdom, which is something not so worthless as our theories of God-
  appointed and prenatally implanted vice.</p>

  <p>Presuming, as I think the preachers mostly do, that there was wisdom in
  the ordering of all this universe, and that the stars that keep their
  courses, and the flowers that obey the summons of the spring, have not
  entirely lost their contact (yet, in spite of jazz and boot-leg liquor!) with
  the First Cause, that obeyed the Wisdom, that impelled them forth; presuming
  that; admitting, as we must, that we ourselves are not wise, or our affairs
  were better ordered; yet admitting, too, that most of us would like to be
  wise and would cherish wisdom if it might be had without too much
  self-sacrifice &mdash; to me it does not seem too far-fetched to presuppose
  that Wisdom does exist.</p>

  <p>And since we rather dimly and sporadically long for it, particularly when
  the aftermath of unwise deeds propels us into gloom, I think it logical (and
  surely some agree with me) that contact with the Ancient Wisdom never has
  been absolutely broken. If it had been broken, we could hardly be aware of
  its suggestive thrills.</p>

  <p>We search, or rather, some of us still search among the animals in far-
  off lands for that weird figment of imagination called the missing link, to
  prove material evolution. Why not &mdash; in the name of manhood, why not
  search at least as far afield for proof of spiritual ancestry? The dignity
  would certainly be greater, and the shock less numbing to our morals, to
  discover ourselves linked in spiritual evolution to the Gods, instead of, as
  the scientists would have us, chained to a material progression with the
  apes.</p>

  <p>A spiritual link there must be. Otherwise, whence come the streams of
  spiritual thought that in our calmer moments of reflection raise us higher
  than the animals? Life, we nowadays agree, is a becoming. What of those who
  have become? If there is progress, where are those who have progressed?</p>

  <p>To a believer in the very modern, unauthenticated doctrine, totally
  impossible of proof and more illogical than any other phantasy invented by
  the mind of man, that we are doomed to one earth-life, and only one,
  whereafter we are dead and done with this world, it is manifestly difficult
  to think, and almost an impossibility to understand that in the order of the
  universe evolving hierarchies fill the realms of evolution, stage beyond
  stage.</p>

  <p>But whoever dares &mdash; and two-thirds of the world does dare &mdash; to
  open up his mind and think that possibly, perhaps, this earth-life that we
  now live is a short link in a chain of many lives, past and to come, lived
  and to be lived on this self-same earth, the purpose of them all the same,
  that by experience we may evolve into a higher spiritual type; whoever dares
  to let imagination wander in that realm of thought can see, at least the
  possibility, that higher types of men, who have preceded us along the path of
  evolution, may exist among us, though unrecognized, and through familiarity
  with purer wisdom than our own may make our own ascent less difficult.</p>

  <p>We may imagine that such men would no more mingle with us socially than
  would our own least prejudiced and most enthusiastic advocates of the
  equality of man permit themselves to live with cannibals. We may imagine,
  too, that they would much bestir themselves to raise us by the best means
  from the moral mud, wherein we cheat, recriminate and fight; and, being wise,
  that they would go about it with more wisdom than our own brass-band
  enthusiasts display when they set forth to educate the heathen in his
  blindness.</p>

  <p>I am told &mdash; and I believe it &mdash; that the password to
  association with the Masters is no spoken word at all, but stark integrity,
  that they can recognize as instantly as trainers see the good points of a
  horse.</p>

  <p>It is of such integrity, and of the Path that leads up to association with
  such men, that I wrote my story <i>OM</i>; and of all the things in life that
  have amazed me, first is this: that in this said-to-be-materially minded
  western hemisphere so many men and women have not only read the book, but
  have agreed to like it, and to ask for more of the same character.</p>

     name="ref27">AS TO WRITING AND READING</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, February 1925</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">ON ONE point there is very nearly a consensus
  throughout all the world. They are not many who deny that literacy is a
  symptom of the progress of the individual and of the race. Some nations have
  insisted on a test of literacy before they will admit an immigrant at all,
  and in civilized communities it is compulsory to learn to read and write. In
  fact, as much stress has been laid on literacy as on sanitation, with the
  consequence that what was patronizingly referred to as the 'Fourth Estate'
  has grown into a social element whose boundaries are no more easy to define
  than is its influence to measure.</p>

  <p>The accepted critics speak of modern literature as a flood, and they are
  right, for it is not less 'floodsome' than was Noah's fabled deluge. They
  refer particularly to the books that thunder off the presses of the world so
  fast that none can possibly keep track of them or read the tenth of one per
  cent. The books, though, are as one drop in the ocean in comparison with all
  the magazines, newspapers, bulletins and pamphlets that pour forth day by
  day. Nor do these complete the flood.</p>

  <p>Who reckons up the tons of correspondence that the postmen carry to and
  fro? Has anybody sought to measure up the influence for good and evil that
  the stamped and sealed hand-written letters wield, which pass in billions
  back and forth in what amounts to legally protected secrecy? The hand that
  writes the letter rules the world, these latter days.</p>

  <p>All superstition dies hard, and it lingers in the veins of men long
  generations after its pretensions have been expertly exposed and drenched
  with vitriolic ridicule. We do a thousand things from superstition that our
  reason would reject if we should pause to analyze them; and by no means least
  is the effect that we permit the written or the printed word to exercise upon
  our thought, and so upon ourselves and our reaction toward one another.</p>

  <p>What poet said he cared not who should write a nation's laws, provided he
  might write its songs? His was a modest preference. The harm he might do, or
  the good, though vast, would be as nothing to the influence of poisoned pens
  that scribble in the darkness and suggest, to minds all unsuspicious of the
  subtlety, solutions of life's handicap that lull into a lazy dream of self-
  absorbed indifference, or stir the lower lees of animality to madness.</p>

  <p>All of us attach too much significance to what is written. We forget that
  the essentials of life, intangible and tenuous, the inner spiritual meanings
  of the symbols that we see, are inexpressible in any form whatever. Ink and
  the best hand-woven paper are not mediums through which the spirit can
  emerge, and no man, pen he ever so adroitly, from a motive utterly unselfish,
  with an aim however high, can write one line that is not capable of
  misinterpretation.</p>

  <p>We are too prone to believe whatever we may see in print. We take less
  care to look into the source of what is fed to our imaginations from the
  printed page than to investigate the food we eat (though we are careless
  about that). Incorrigible superstition guiding, we assert or take for granted
  that no individual, or group, or organized association would attempt to drug
  our minds; and we forget that the drug-craving almost always is unconsciously
  acquired. From very small beginnings it becomes a tyranny that owns, eats,
  empties, and leaves nothing but the shell of manhood. Do we stop to think
  that drugging of the mind and its imagination is a subtler and a worse form
  of corruption than the peddled poison that can only wreck one human being at
  a time? With pen and ink we can be poisonous at wholesale and a million can
  fill their minds from the suggestions of one black filling of a
  fountain-pen.</p>

  <p>Time was, when literacy was the privilege of few and the majority were at
  the mercy of the masters of the art of writing; pens were mightier than
  swords in those days; he who took his pen in hand was conscious of
  responsibility. So well was that condition realized that censorship was
  rigidly enforced by church and state, both equally aware that superstition
  lent exaggerated value to whatever might be written and regardless of who
  wrote it. In the early days of printing censorship increased in rigor, aided
  and abetted by the fears of long-hand secretaries that their own profession
  of the pen might fall on evil days.</p>

  <p>In spite of censorship, it was as evident in those days as it is now, that
  a man equipped with fluency and malice might undo more governments, upset
  more nicely balanced calculations and leave greater ruin in his wake than all
  the culverins and powder in the arsenals of Europe. None denied, as few deny
  today, that printing, writing, correspondence have in them the germ of
  liberation for the minds of men; the benefit of literacy was conceded, but
  the dread prevailed of what might happen if the gift of literacy and the
  freedom of the press should actually pass into the keeping of the common
  people.</p>

  <p>Those who had inherited, or had assumed the custody of public morals were
  agreed on the necessity of rigidly reviewing in advance of publication
  anything the printers might intend to loose upon the public. But &mdash;
  "quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"* It was discovered, then as now, that what
  goes through a sieve is governed by the nature of the meshes of the sieve; it
  was impossible to keep a higher standard of morality than that of any
  individual entrusted with enforcing it. The leak began there flowed in
  rapidly increasing streams into the channels sanctioned by authority all
  manner of polluting filth to find its level in the lower swamps of public
  consciousness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i> (Latin) &mdash;
  Who will guard the guards themselves? Juvenal (55 CE-127 CE), <i><a href=

  <p>Stupidity increased the weakness of the censorship, since good intentions
  never were the gage of government. Excluded works of merit, whose plain
  writing or originality had shocked the appointed guardians of thought, found
  outlet to the public somehow and men mocked a censorship that tried to keep
  from them such mental stimulant &mdash; until, since ridicule is
  all-corrosive, censorship became discredited and, knowing its own weakness,
  vanished into nothing more than name and a few emoluments.</p>

  <p>Then license had its day, with now and then reactionary swings that but
  intensified the common will to read, or to be read to, from whatever was
  forbidden. Side by side with a perpetually gaining literary habit, that as
  generations came and went alchemically changed the medium of thought-
  communication from the sung and spoken to the written word, there flowed out
  of the stagnant lower levels of the human mind a habit of indecency unable to
  express itself except in the corruption of the noble, the artistic, the
  sublime.</p>

  <p>So, side by side, the literary bay-tree and the worm both flourished, the
  worm spoiling what the nature of the tree produced; until, unable any longer
  to restrain the human appetite for knowledge easily acquired, those in
  authority let down all barriers and, making virtue of necessity, decreed that
  literacy, if no more, should be the common heritage of all men.</p>

  <p>'If no more' was where the canker entered in. By law it was compulsory to
  learn to read and write, but not to learn to judge between the good and evil.
  Canons of good taste, artistic standards, literary judgment were omitted from
  the new curriculum, imposed on men, or else conceded to them by the keepers
  of the nations' weal. There came a generation, taught to read and write and
  stirred to mental hunger by the consciousness of an ability its ancestors did
  not possess, but utterly unable to discriminate and no less bound than
  formerly by superstitious reverence for anything in writing or in print.</p>

  <p>On them, in their simplicity as helpless as young birds about to leave the
  nest, the hawks of opportunity descended. There was born, within a
  generation, an enormous system, sprung Minerva-like from out the forehead of
  the century, equipped with thundering machinery, devised expressly to exploit
  the common people's craving for a mental anodyne. It praised itself. It
  flattered its eager victims. Flamboyantly it flourished fragments of the
  truth and drenched them in a stream of printer's ink. It cultivated in the
  public mind the theory that all men had the right to know their neighbors'
  business and, reckless of the consequence, excited to the limit the awakened
  craving for sensation.</p>

  <p>The printing-press became the governing machinery of nations. With the
  youth compelled to go to school, it was a simple thing to cultivate in coming
  generations markets for the ever-growing, ever more sensationally written
  flood of daily fiction masquerading as the truth.</p>

  <p>The proper field of fiction was invaded. To obtain an audience the story-
  writers yielded to the impulse to appeal to the sensation-appetite, soon
  learning the advantage of the indirect suggestion over downright
  loathsomeness. Deliberately books were written with the unconcealed intention
  of evading legal penalties while pandering suggestively to all the lowest
  human instincts &mdash; they themselves, the writers, in their own youth
  caught within the toils of the impersonal, intangible perverter of men's
  minds, whose modern engine of perversion is the press.</p>

  <p>Now this is clear: as much today as in its first beginnings literature has
  in it the seed, the possibility of liberation for men's minds. Men live
  today, as yesterday, whose destiny has charged them with possession of great
  'organs of opinion' &mdash; who are publishers of magazines, and books, and
  newspapers &mdash; and who are striving with all their might to purify the
  streams of print that flood the public mind. But they have learned in the
  expensive college of experiment that appetite, once whetted, is impossible to
  appease or to ignore, and they are faced with the fact that the public is
  glutting itself with trash and, on the whole, prefers it to the better wares
  that those aware of their responsibility persist in offering.</p>

  <p>The flood, in other words, has got beyond control. Discolored, foul,
  polluted with the reputations of its victims, it has burst the banks of
  dignity and flows over the whole wide realm of thought. Like Noah in his ark,
  some writers float on it, some publishers preserve their self-respect, some
  readers swim, selecting flotsam to support their interest and finding quiet
  counter-currents &mdash; now and then an island or a rock in mid-stream. But
  the most go down along the flood, and no man knows to what depravity it
  leads.</p>

  <p>The pessimist's persuasion then, is easy &mdash; lazy might define it more
  correctly. If we view what Kipling calls the "unforgiving minute" with the
  concentrated gaze of appetite that throws the wider views of time and cycles
  out of focus, it may be difficult to disbelieve that all humanity is
  drowning. Then &mdash; hope lost for the world, ourself the looker-on &mdash;
  there might be some good sense in resignation to the thought that all is
  vanity.</p>

  <p>They say that Solomon composed that epigram, in some despairing mood when
  he had tasted all the ashes of sensation. Yet the same man, in the same mood,
  wrote "there is nothing new under the sun." Nor is it new then, that the
  world should foul its own nest and pollute the stream of literature. Always
  it has done the same thing. It erects its cities and pollutes its rivers; it
  discerns art dimly and invents the chromograph; it hears the symphonies of
  Beethoven, and dances to the cacophonic barbarism of machine-made jazz.</p>

  <p>None knows the number of the wise men and the prophets who have brought
  into the world new torches lighted at the Ancient Fire of Wisdom. No
  historian can count the creeds, philosophies, fanaticisms, canons and
  dissensions that have leaped up from the darkness to distort that light, have
  flickered in it for a while, and vanished. When the rain drops on the thirsty
  earth, the mud forms. When the light shines in the darkness, shadows multiply
  themselves. When wind blows, there are waves that wreck ill-managed
  ships.</p>

  <p>No floods persist. They leave destruction in their wake and carcasses, the
  ruins of homes unwisely built and tumbled, littered acres where the land-
  marks stood; but from them, in the leisured course of time, men learn a
  little wisdom &mdash; as they learn from the polluted streams they labor to
  repurify at last and to protect. Men die from the pollution &mdash; die in
  droves, until at last survivors listen to the advocates of cleanliness.</p>

  <p>There is an endless store of Wisdom, and the acts of men can no more empty
  it than can the night blot out the sun. By night, how many of us think the
  day has gone forever and no dawn will gleam along the hills? Not even maniacs
  succumb to that delusion. All of us expect the coming dawn, and some of us
  prepare for it. We may await a new dawn of the Ancient Wisdom in the world
  with equal confidence. We may as well be ready for it when it comes.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the night of literature lingers; there are many who have bad
  dreams, some who sleep too deeply to be dreaming, and a horde who dance the
  night through to the tune of any instrument, who will be weary and will sleep
  late when the morning comes. But stars shine all the brighter for the
  darkness, and considering the stars is better for us, and more restful, than
  to woo sensation in the yellow light that seeks to dim them with its
  artificial glare.</p>

  <p>H. P. Blavatsky was the morning star. The literary dawn will not be far
  behind her. She retaught the ancient law of individual responsibility, and of
  the dignity and the divinity of man. Her theme was theme enough for all the
  writers of the world for centuries to come. With morning, when the world
  perceives there was no profit in the yellow glare of cheap sensation; when it
  sees the littered nastiness of what the lamps made to resemble virtue, it
  will turn toward the sun.</p>

  <p>But there is no need now, because the morning star is merged into the
  faint rays of the rising sun, to waste time waiting for the full dawn. There
  is still with us that "unforgiving minute," and the words we write are as
  reactive as the stuff we read. We are responsible. In these days, when the
  youngest of us is a letter-writer and the oldest makes his book of
  reminiscences, not one of us escapes responsibility for some share in the
  stream of written thought that goes forth influencing men's minds.
  Responsibility comes home to roost.</p>

  <p>We are in school, as all the universe was always &mdash; in the school
  that fits us for the ascending path of evolution. We are learning, or if not
  we will be forced to learn, to use the written and the printed word as medium
  for transference of thought, in preparation for the day &mdash; it may be
  centuries ahead of us &mdash; when thought-communication will be understood
  and used without mechanical assistance.</p>

  <p>It requires no deep investigation into logic, and it needs no pinnacles of
  purity from which to realize that just so long as we are willing to admit
  into our thought the written vapors of suggestiveness and all indignity, we
  never shall be fit to guard our minds against a more insidious, unwritten
  method of approach. It is what we read now &mdash; what we are willing to
  spend time on reading &mdash; that provides us with a part of the experience
  on which our evolution will be based.</p>

  <p>And so with writing. Whether it be letters to our friends, the daily news
  or books intended to be read by fellow-men whose personality and views are
  totally unknown to us, we must respect their dignity although we fail to
  recognize our own. We may not trespass in a man's house; laws are rigidly
  enforced against offenders who befoul the air with smoke or keep their
  premises in such condition as may spread disease. We keep all those who are
  likely to spread contagion isolated. But we must learn not to contaminate the
  thought of others, nor to obscure truth, nor to deny it with the written
  word, before we shall be fit for further progress.</p>

  <p>In our hands, available to all of us, there is a means of thought-
  communication. We have fouled it until all too few of us can recognize the
  foulness, and we have to purify it carefully, persistently and one by one,
  each individual attending to his own share of the whole. No one man, nor any
  group of men is rightfully to blame for the incredible debasement of our
  modern literary output, which is due to the inherent craving of the lower
  natures of us all for anything that will keep our eyes masked from the light.
  Indignity desires indignity, like craving like.</p>

  <p>The dawning of the dignity of man affords the remedy. When writers,
  whether of books or news or private letters, learn that they imbue the
  written matter with their own true character, revealing to the educated eye
  their meannesses as well as what of virtue they may have, there will be more
  attempt to cleanse and prune the thought that goes on to the page. When it is
  realized that every contribution to the mass of sordid thinking adds to the
  inevitable karma that contributor will have to meet, there will be caution,
  if for no more reason than a mere enlightened selfishness. When it is
  understood that the reception into consciousness of sordid views and
  misinterpretations of the facts of life unfits the thinker for true thinking
  on his own account, the market will diminish for the wares of the sensualist
  and for sheer self-preservation he will have to strive to turn out better
  reading-matter.</p>

  <p>The last phase of literary degradation has arrived, exactly as the deepest
  darkness usually precedes dawn. The so-called 'realistic' school of letters
  foists on us a presentation of the worst side of men's character, their worst
  indecencies and lowest aims, as the truth about human nature; and they
  scream, as they scream of the indignity of nature, that the truth and art are
  one.</p>

  <p>That wail exposes their own falsity. As surely as that truth and art are
  one, depiction and delineation and description of the dignity of manhood are
  the first pre-requisites of art. The rebirth of the art of writing, though
  the midwives of the so-called realism scream however loud that their
  brain-child is nature's favorite, was heralded when first H. P. Blavatsky
  dared to come among us and reteach that fundamental principle of all art
  &mdash; that life is spiritual evolution, aspiration, ever climbing upward,
  and the picture of degeneracy is not, never was and never can be worth a
  minute's spattering of pen and ink.</p>

  <p>With dignity (of which two attributes are tolerance and humor) let the
  spiritual aspect of humanity become the theme of art, and soon there will be
  greater men than Shakespeare in our midst, because we shall be plowing up a
  field of thought in which the seeds of renaissance can grow.</p>

     name="ref28">AS TO SUCCESS AND FAILURE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, April 1925</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">THERE was once a nobleman, or there is said to have
  been one (Las Casas* mentions him), who caused thirteen Indians to be burned
  alive in honor of Christ and the twelve Apostles. Applause perhaps appeased
  his morbid appetite for adulation, though there may have been concomitant
  emotions. He achieved success, precisely as he measured it. And though he may
  have passed out of the world less painfully than did the victims of his orgy
  of aspiration, the permanence and quality of his success are
  unconvincing.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Las Casas</i> &mdash; Bartolom&eacute; de Las Casas
  (1474-1566), a Spanish missionary and historian, called the apostle of the
  Indies. He went to Hispaniola with his father in 1502, and eight years later
  he was ordained a priest. In 1514 he began to work for the improvement of
  conditions among the indigenous population, especially for the abolition of
  their slavery and of the forced labor of the encomienda. He devoted the rest
  of his life to that cause ... <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/65/la/LasCasas.html">The Columbia
  Encyclopedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>And there was Caesar, who came, saw, conquered &mdash; his genius, brain,
  influence, and hardihood all concentrated on the one determination to assert
  himself and yoke the strength of conquered peoples to his chariot. He even
  deified himself and set his image in a Roman temple. There are more who envy
  Caesar than who crave to emulate the nobleman who burned the Indians to
  death; he has more apologists because he peacocked on a grander scale. And
  yet, if numbers are significant, and if attainment shall be measured by
  extent and aftermath, it needs not much discernment to observe that Caesar
  merely wrought more havoc, more titanically than did the immolator of the
  Indians.</p>

  <p>So much depends on how we measure failure and success; and, probably, each
  individual on earth possesses secret standards of his own, in many cases
  secret from himself for lack of self-examination, by which he measures both
  his own attainments and those of others.</p>

  <p>There was Hypatia,* who taught that happiness may be attained by searching
  for the truth, and living, reckless of the consequences, decently. The
  advocates of the accepted dogmas of that day not only slew her but in
  indignation at the purity she preached defiled her body, scraping every scrap
  of flesh from off her bones. Said they, 'that proves she failed.'</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Hypatia</i> &mdash; Hypatia of Alexandria (ca. 370-
  415 CE). A Greek philosopher. The daughter of another philosopher, Theon of
  Alexandria, who taught her mathematics. About 400 CE she became head of the
  Platonist school at Alexandria, where she lectured on the philosophy known as
  Neoplatonism. This combined Plato's ideas with a mix of Christian, Jewish,
  and East Asian influences and emphasized striving for an unreachable ultimate
  reality. Her edition of Euclid's Elements, prepared with her father, became
  the basis for all later versions. Christians deemed her philosophical views
  pagan and killed her during antipagan riots. She is considered to be the
  first woman of any importance in the history of mathematics. <i><a href=

  <p>And there was Socrates, whom the Athenians put to death. That obstinate
  old hero, sweetly reasonable and unreasonably (so said the Athenians)
  impulsive in his efforts to direct attention to contemporary evils, resisted
  all persuasion to desist from breaking up the molds of thought &mdash; until
  the rulers of the city made him toast the tired humanity he loved in a cup of
  hemlock. Did he fail? Or did the tyrants fail, whose very names have
  vanished?</p>

  <p>H. P. Blavatsky came into the West within the memory of men and women who
  have spoken with her and have heard from her own lips her message of the
  Ancient Wisdom. Measured by the standards that apply to commerce and the race
  for personal advantage, she could not be called a 'favorite of fortune.' She
  did not die rich. She left no legacies of carefully invested funds whose
  income should endow establishments for proving to the world how thrifty
  Wisdom is, and how materially buttressed are its children. She did not taste
  fame, but infamy. No legislatures voted her a tablet on their walls. The
  satirists and journalists aimed stinging jibes at her; religious dogmatists
  persecuted her; her very ill health, caused by her unselfish efforts for
  humanity, was made a butt for ridicule. She died. The evil her accusers
  coined still echoes faintly here and there. She died tired; she was doubtless
  glad enough to go; but did she fail? No. She succeeded amazingly. Her work
  lives after her as a world-wide movement, yearly growing in power and
  influence.</p>

  <p>The human mind is an amazing breeding-place of paradox. We hero-worship
  when the mood is on us, but the mood depends, too often, on the comforts we
  imagine that we need. Our military heroes are the men who died defending gaps
  in a material defense, providing safety for the rest of us. We can admire
  that sacrifice. We can admit that their failure to preserve themselves was
  glorious, and justly we inscribe their records in the rolls of fame.</p>

  <p>And we are willing &mdash; all the nations of the earth have done it in
  their years of decadence &mdash; to go a step or two beyond the totally
  material, when things material have somehow lost their taste and death seems
  more than formerly convincing &mdash; we are willing then to hero-worship at
  the shrines of saints and prophets who are said, however falsely said, to
  have performed self-immolation for remission of our sins.</p>

  <p>But he who dares to challenge all the hatred of reaction by suggesting to
  us that we should think and, thinking, make ourselves a battlefield of light
  against the darkness, higher against lower nature, inspiration against habit,
  that one becomes a nuisance, not a hero in our eyes, however selflessly he
  suffers in his fight for all humanity.</p>

  <p>What is success? We live this little life and leave behind us bones that
  crumble into dust; what else? It is a platitude to say that money never
  purchased happiness; all know it, he who wallows in his wealth as well as he
  who winces for the lack of half enough. Possessions, though we crave them,
  simply add their ball-and-chain to the encumbrances with which we litter up
  our lives; and though some seek their happiness in dying rich, that their
  survivors may enjoy the fruit of all their energy, it remains yet to be shown
  in any instance that wealth resolves life's handicap, though many of the rich
  have sought to buy contentment for the poor.</p>

  <p>And nations are as individuals. In all recorded history there is not one
  instance of a nation's happiness increasing as a result of material conquest,
  which, on the contrary, merely magnifies the problems to be met and leaves to
  generations yet unborn an aftermath of rancor and revenge.</p>

  <p>Analysis of motives that impel humanity along its turbulent and constantly
  repeated course, each generation deeming itself wiser than its forbears, yet
  adopting the same methods to escape the same old pitfalls and lamenting with
  the same cries when the same results ensue, reveals that competition holds a
  foremost place. Men, cities, nations, races, even continents of people, judge
  their progress by material advantage. Life has been accepted as a 'struggle
  for existence.' The profound experience of ages, out of which was minted the
  immortal warning "Give, and it shall be given unto you," when not forgotten
  is reduced to a refined, far-seeing selfishness. We give, that we may get. We
  sacrifice, in order that "bread cast upon the waters" may return to us. The
  wise words "unto him who hath shall more be given" have been tortured into a
  command to grab &mdash; get &mdash; keep &mdash; and get more, whether it be
  wealth, fame, authority, or (subtlest of sensual deceptions) self-
  esteem.</p>

  <p>Not many of us like to see conceit in others. We ignore it in ourselves.,
  or misinterpret it to mean the consciousness of goodness. Most of us have met
  at some time persons who inflict the pride of their humility on neighbors,
  and not many of us have refrained from the commission of that impudence at
  times, when the reaction from our positive conceit set in. The ebb and flow
  of ugly pride and uglier humility will never cease until we change the basis
  of our thought and judge ourselves by what we are, not by what we would like
  to seem to be.</p>

  <p>We presuppose, in theory, a universe that is exactly what it is; that is
  becoming what it is becoming; that has purpose, possibly inscrutable; whose
  government is Law, unvarying, admitting no exceptions. And in practice we
  proceed to try to break that Law, to be exceptions, to become something
  different from what is purposed for us, and to be what we are not. The result
  is failure, which persists in myriads of guises just as long as the delusion
  lasts that we can break eternal Law. Ignorance of the Law avails us nothing,
  nor does remedy consist in an attempt to change the Law, but in discovering
  what the Law is and in directing our own efforts in accordance with it, when
  discovered.</p>

  <p>Failure is at least unpleasant, and its sting lies in its inescapable
  conclusion: it obliges us to reconsider life &mdash; but that, too, is the
  reason why so many failures are precursors of success. Failure so convincing
  that the clamor of dissatisfaction dies and silence supervenes, is victory at
  last. No pig under a gate can yell more self-intently than a failed man's
  pride can clamor against luck or against other people's falseness; but in the
  stillness of what seems uttermost disaster other impulses can find their way
  into the consciousness, and new hope dawns.</p>

  <p>Success consists in being what we are, not in deceiving ourselves and
  others that we are something else than what we are. If we can recognize
  ourselves, and be, with all our might, that Man that we discern, if dimly, in
  our moments of true inspiration, no other purpose will remain, nor will any
  sense of competition cloud the issue. We shall see ourselves becoming, not by
  pretending to be, and not by theorizing, but by being something. In the death
  of our delusions, stung by discontent, eventually we are driven to discern
  that mere lip-service to ideals destroys the very vision of the goal we
  crave; and we must be the very spirit we aspire to, just as rain is wet and
  not a theory of wetness. Calendars, however beautifully printed, grow no
  crops; it is the spring that starts the seeds, the warmth that nurtures them
  in nature's breast. Ungoverned by the heart no intellect, no will, can find
  the upward way.</p>

  <p>When aspiration enters consciousness, we waste time if we worry over
  consequences. Is the aspiration true, or is it false? Shall we accept it, or
  reject? Is it a glimpse of real being, or a whiff out of the swamps of the
  delusion-breeding lower consciousness that tempts us?</p>

  <p>There, momentarily and forever, the dividing line between success and
  failure runs; but so intense is racial habit and inherited predisposition to
  adopting subterfuge, that we attempt all sorts of methods of evading exercise
  of judgment. There are those who go to 'advisers' for the decision; there are
  others who seek fortune-tellers; there are many who take whichever course at
  first appears the easiest, consulting none but their own surface-impulses.
  And there are not a few who steep themselves in what they have been told is
  occultism, hoping, as it were, to run before they have begun to learn to
  walk, aspiring to results before they have remotely made acquaintance with
  the causes.</p>

  <p>No man knows more, nor can know more, of occultism than his hourly
  exercise of judgment demonstrates. The child, who is spontaneously joyous, is
  a vastly deeper occultist than he who strains his intellect in order to
  acquire 'control of forces,' which, if rightly his, he would possess as
  naturally and apply with as much ease as he does the law of circulation of
  the blood. Success in occultism, as in all else, lies in doing with the whole
  heart eagerly the instant task at hand, if that be chopping wood or
  intricately managing finance.</p>

  <p>"That thou doest, do with all thy might," is counsel taken from the
  deepest wisdom of the ages; but &mdash; be it noted &mdash; it says nothing
  about watching for immediate results. Discouragement is always due to that
  peculiarly human vice of seeking instant, open recompense for effort. They
  who dabble in the dark of occultism, trespassing beyond the confines of the
  'now and this,' are no whit wiser than the men and women who forget that
  deeds done in the dawn of history are hedging us today with consequences. He
  who strives, by delving into mysteries, to find a short cut to a higher
  dignity is actually more materialistic in his aim than is his fellow who digs
  and plants potatoes. Both seek to satisfy a human craving, but the man who
  digs the dirt goes straight to nature, doing what he knows and leaving nature
  to produce the consequences. He who tries to soar into the unknown by a short
  cut, making intellectual experiments too subtle for his present stage of
  evolution, seeks material phenomena no less than the potato-digger, with the
  difference that he ignores his own unwisdom while he violates his soul in the
  pursuit of intellectual sensation.</p>

  <p>No issue can be taken with the man who fancies he has only one earth-life
  to live, whereafter night and nothing, or else the grim alternative of
  yelling hell or sentimental heaven. He can have no sense of ultimate
  responsibility nor see the value of the passing minute. If he can escape, or
  thinks he can escape, the outcome of his thinking and his doing, of his
  thoughtlessness and of his own neglect, by the accident of death or by the
  importunity of prayer, he will govern himself accordingly. He must be left to
  grow until, confronted by experience, he reaches for the deathless Spirit in
  himself, and learns.</p>

  <p>But there are those who have escaped from the delusion of the one
  earthlife; who have abandoned fear of hell or hope of heaven; who have seen a
  nobler vision of their destiny than everlasting idleness in a Semitic
  sanctuary; who have replaced fear with feeling of responsibility; who know
  that there are many lives, and that the <i>living of them is the means of
  evolution.</i></p>

  <p>Nobility of purpose is revealed, and new horizons reach into an infinite,
  that is appealing and assuring because Now is of the very essence of it and
  no swamps of an incalculable chance waylay the pilgrim's feet. No longer is
  there any question what we leave behind us except bones that crumble into
  dust. Our very dust becomes ennobled; it becomes the stuff of which ensuing
  molds are fashioned in which infinite varieties of life shall have
  experience.</p>

  <p>When the eternal vastness and the dignity of evolution has begun to dawn
  in consciousness, no thought, no deed, is insignificant. No minute lacks
  importance. The division between failure and success lies visible and
  comprehensible. Success is seen as new ennoblement, attained by effort and so
  fluxed into the character by Nature's alchemy that thought and act thereby
  forever more are governed. Failure becomes revelation of the next step to be
  taken in the ascending scale of Manhood; and the end of a material mistake
  becomes a challenge to dehypnotize the vision, to look for the ascending Path
  exactly at one's feet, to learn that lesson, and go forward wiser for the
  experience, more tolerant of others' blunders and more generous.</p>

  <p>For generosity is of the essence of success. We judge a lamp by the
  effulgence of its rays. That lamp that gives the brightest light, with least
  annoyance and expense, is a suggestive symbol of the alchemy of evolution.
  There is no improvidence in spiritual living; not an effort made at spiritual
  self-improvement that can fail of its proportionate effect on all the
  universe. Incessant self-control, so governing ourselves as to become more
  capable of spiritual vision and less capable of false enthusiasms, is our
  objective; its attainment is the greatest gift we can bestow on all
  mankind.</p>

  <p>Now a lamp that burns in daylight might be put to better uses. They who
  cavil at unequal distribution of the world's material rewards may well
  consider the suggestiveness of lamplight wasted while the sun shines. A no
  less authority than Jesus is reported to have remarked "the poor ye have
  always with you"; and a countless series of sermons has been preached, an
  utterly innumerable stream of books brought forth, in efforts to explain that
  saying or to twist it, either into an apparent compromise with human hopes or
  else into a brief for fatalistic resignation. Yet its paradox is easy to
  interpret if we bear in mind that evolution goes on simultaneously on the
  spiritual plane and the material.</p>

  <p>We being here to make experience, through which we may evolve into a
  higher state of consciousness and simultaneously change, by our employment of
  it, the particular material environment at which we have arrived, there is a
  dignity &mdash; and more than that, a glorious responsibility in being born
  into the stratum of society where quality of manhood obviously most is
  needed. The illogic of the situation vanishes when that viewpoint is
  realized; for who shall know the needs of poverty unless he learn them at
  first hand? Who otherwise shall learn compassion?</p>

  <p>Is it beyond the reach of human comprehension that a great soul, rich from
  the experience of aeons of earth-lives, as daring as the ray of light that
  plunges into gloom, and having reached that stage of self-directed evolution
  when it even can select its own next line of effort, should deliberately
  choose a birth into the very depths of poverty? Of what use else were all its
  well-earned alchemy? Shall it paint the lily white, or shall it plunge into
  a sea of misery and transmute that? Which effort is the nobler?</p>

  <p>Shall a soul learn all the intricate economy of Nature through a series of
  births into -a world of lethargy and ease? And may there not be souls whose
  turn has come to test themselves in that wide realm of opportunity that
  poverty presents?</p>

  <p>Too readily we all identify ourselves with matter &mdash; shapes with
  which time clothes us when we go forth into earth-experience. It would be as
  sensible to call ourselves the clothes we wear. Brain, body, intellect, the
  senses, are the aggregate of what we have deserved through previous exertion;
  our environment is the exactly measured scope of our ability to play the
  man.</p>

  <p>The paradox, so baffling to the men and women who believe they visit earth
  but once and then are done with it, grows clear as daylight if we keep man's
  true essential divinity in mind. The mystery of how, and why, "the poor are
  always with us" and no money can be made to buy more than a momentary
  anodyne, ceases to be a mystery at all. Materiality can no more change itself
  than darkness can. It is through spiritual consciousness that matter yields
  and men grow masters of their destiny; and disregard of mere material
  results, while aiming at the spiritual goal, lays matter in subjection.</p>

  <p>To try to place matter in subjection by manipulating matter is the snare
  that traps the would-be 'higher occultist,' who, if he should expend the half
  of the amount of energy in striving to identify himself, by wholesome living,
  with that true divinity that is his higher self, would earn more virtue in a
  minute than a life-time of ambitious conjuring can gain for him.</p>

  <p>The higher knowledge comes of higher living at the stage at which we are,
  not of trying to obtain it by manipulations of the intellect. All Nature is
  exactly balanced and the individual who leaves the royal road of duty,
  seeking to escape responsibility by stealing marches on his Karma, though he
  may attain a sort of misty half-acquaintance with another plane, will be
  unbalanced by it, having not the necessary wisdom. And the end of that is
  chaos, with the way out difficult to find.</p>

  <p>We forget that Wisdom seeks us; that its line of least resistance is a
  balanced character; that he who has attained to self-control and a delight in
  duty is inseparably one with Wisdom, which will find him out and feel its way
  into his consciousness exactly in proportion to his value to the human
  race.</p>

  <p>The survival of the fittest is undoubtedly a law of Nature; but the
  fittest are not necessarily the fattest, nor the richest, nor the most
  successful on the plane of mere material results. Viewed through the
  distorting lenses of materiality, Lao-Tse, the Buddha, Jesus, and Pythagoras,
  the Druids, and all truly spiritual teachers, have been failures; it is not
  recorded that they slew their tens of thousands, or excelled in sport, or
  left invested money to endow associations that should standardize religion
  and enforce its rule. With a convincing unanimity they all ignored the weight
  of popular opinion, the threat of violence, the said-to-be omnipotence of
  numbers and the lure of gold. Is there a financier on record, or a demagogue,
  or an elected ruler, or a conqueror by force of arms, whose efforts have
  achieved one fraction of the benefit that theirs did? How many men were
  happier or wiser as a consequence of Caesar's triumphs? Was it Croesus who
  expressed the Golden Rule? Did Roman arms, or Roman gladiators, pave the way
  for Vergil's poems, or was Shakespeare raised on the rapine of Drake? There
  have been great kings; which of them has wrought surviving changes on the
  earth remotely comparable to the bloodless revolution set in force by
  Lao-Tse, to cite one simple instance?</p>

  <p>What then is fittest to survive? that is the question &mdash; not whether
  to be or not to be, as Shakespeare makes the unhinged Hamlet ask. The dullest
  wit can answer, if the elementary and fundamental fact is not forgotten, that
  we shall return to earth &mdash; it may be a million times, or oftener
  &mdash; to meet the consequences of our action and neglect. What nature of
  conditions do we choose to meet when we revisit earth? And do we wish to be
  the victims, or to be the agents through whom the regenerative forces of the
  universe may find expression and prevail over materiality?</p>

  <p>Success reshapes itself in that perspective. Failure dons new hues. Time
  loses its significance in the importance of the everlasting Now. Desirable
  results appear less tangible and not so measurable in the scale with dollars
  and political control. Intolerance of other men's and other nations' vanity
  succumbs before alertness to our own imprisonment within a mold of prejudice
  that we begin to work to break. Self-discipline replaces the desire to govern
  others. True self-interest is seen to be attainment of such self-command as
  shall admit more wisdom into our own complex nature, driving out the dregs of
  ignorance in front of it, thus fitting us for manlier life now. So destiny is
  fashioned. So are laid the genuine foundations of success.</p>

  <p>The problem is one and the same, whether a man possesses millions, or owes
  them; whether he has been elected to a legislature as the representative of
  millions, or whether a community, for lack of wisdom, in itself and him, has
  thrown him into prison. Destiny appoints no favorites, anoints no specially
  favored sons, avoids no issues, and ignores no subtleties of surreptitious
  lapses from integrity. We carve our own careers; and he who wrings
  extravagant amounts of money from the sweated labor of men, women, and
  children driven to obey him by the pressure of necessity, will learn
  inevitably, in experience, the sharpness of that shape of selfishness. Death
  may afford a breathing-spell, but it avoids no consequences of the acts that
  we commit; and there is many a man in prison, brought up short by that
  predicament, and so provided with an opportunity to think and look for the
  solution of life's problem in himself, whose destiny will uplift and enrich
  the world.</p>

  <p>Success and failure are twin frauds until the mask is stripped from them
  and we discern that dread of one is as unjustified as craving for the other.
  Then, those frauds exposed, we see the true direction for expenditure of
  effort and thereafter we permit the Lords of Destiny to measure our success
  exactly, by providing us with opportunity to prove, now, in experience, how
  far we have identified ourselves with the divine in us. That is the only test
  worth taking, and the only evidence that counts.</p>

     name="ref29">A BEGINNER'S CONCEPT OF THEOSOPHY</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, May 1925</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">I REMEMBER the occasion when I first began to learn
  to swim. There was a deep end and a shallow end. The deeper looked more
  satisfying, so I jumped in while the teacher was not looking. The indignity
  of having to be fished out was humiliating, but the worst part was the
  distaste that it gave me for the whole business of swimming, with the result
  that younger boys, who had approached the problem reasonably, left me far
  behind and it was several years before I began to acquire much confidence in
  the water or any genuine liking for it.</p>

  <p>Then there was school. We studied Shakespeare in the English class; but
  not once, during four years of instruction, were we encouraged to enjoy the
  poet's plays or to appreciate their beauty. We were set to parsing and
  analysis, to definition of the obsolete and rare words, and to memorizing
  drily written footnotes &mdash; with the consequence that poetry,
  particularly Shakespeare's poetry, became a synonym for drudgery. I believe I
  was thirty years old before it ever really occurred to me that poetry was
  something that a man might blend into his life and breathe into his efforts,
  thus ennobling any task he touched.</p>

  <p>The simplest means opponents of Theosophy could use in order to delay and
  to obscure its message to humanity, would be to encourage all beginners to
  plunge into it heads foremost at the deeper end and swamp their intellects
  with Sanskrit definitions. If they could be kept thereafter struggling to
  possess Theosophy in a bewilderment of words, Theosophy would die out from
  beneath as certainly as poetry has vanished from the schools, since there
  would be no natural responsiveness in which the love of it could
  flourish.</p>

  <p>Love is the life of the Ancient Wisdom, and unless we love it ardently
  &mdash; unless it comforts and convinces by the flow of confidence outwelling
  from within &mdash; we may be sure we are but grasping at, or arguing
  against, the printed word; its spirit has escaped us. We cannot absorb
  Theosophy like patent medicine, and the attempt to masticate it all and crowd
  it into one gray brain is madness. It is infinite, with no beginning and no
  end. It would be easier to swallow all earth's air and drink up all the
  rivers than to possess Theosophy, in the sense that we possess degrees from
  universities or stock certificates.</p>

  <p>A hundred years before the birth of Christianity Shu Kuang wrote: "The
  genius of men who possess is stunted by possession. Wealth only aggravates
  the imbecility of fools." (From <i>Gems of Chinese Literature,</i> translated
  by H. A. Giles.) No wiser summary of the futility of all possession ever
  dripped from a satiric pen, and if the epigram were printed on the front page
  of all text-books and engraved on every dollar-bill in circulation there
  might be some hope of civilizing earth within a hundred years. It is an axiom
  for all beginners in Theosophy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, we struggle to possess, beginners just as keenly as the older
  hands who have accumulated what are euphemistically termed resources. Public
  education is designed to cultivate a memory for facts, as if a crowded brain
  were an essential to living. And a number of us, having been so educated, try
  to 'cram' Theosophy as if we had to pass examinations in it and be judged
  according to an arbitrary scale of marks.</p>

  <p>It is true indeed that we must pass examinations in it, but their
  incidence is hourly. We receive marks, and are judged. But the impersonal
  Judge, Karma, utterly ignores the feats of memory and all unproved claims,
  examining the progress of the heart's integrity as demonstrated by
  experience. Examination questions are the incidents of daily life. We act and
  react, do and leave undone, think and refuse to think, stand firm or are
  seduced, while Karma &mdash; incorruptible and inescapable &mdash; inscribes
  our spiritual progress on the rolls of destiny.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The moving finger writes and, having writ, moves on."</p>

  <p>I write as one who has but recently become a member of the Universal
  Brotherhood and Theosophical Society: that is, as a beginner, who had never
  seen a copy of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> until about three years ago, nor
  ever read a copy of <cite>The Theosophical Path</cite> or any of the
  <i>Theosophical Manuals</i> until the magic of Blavatsky's pen stirred in me
  something deeper and more challenging than I had known was there and capable
  of being stirred. And I remember the bewilderment of all the knowledge
  crowded into her immortal book; and what thoughts first occurred to me when I
  had laughed a while (for there is humor in all logic, and the logic of the
  Law of Karma is complete).</p>

  <p>For days on end I wrestled with the Sanskrit technicalities and tried to
  memorize them, caught in the enthusiasm of the universal theme but blinded by
  the habit of attributing all knowledge to the brain-mind. I would master this
  magnificent philosophy and make it mine! Then, failing to remember more than
  half-a-dozen Sanskrit words or to recall, for more than half-a-day, to which
  Root-race and Sub-race I belong, I scrambled out of that deep water and
  proposed to myself to try the shallow end. It looked, and was, much easier,
  but there was mystery enough.</p>

  <p>I studied the significance of Karma, as applied to me, and found it not so
  easy or amusing as the thought of its retributive effect on others. There was
  too much justice in it. I began to be aware that there were incidents which,
  had I known of Karma at the time, might not have happened; and it irked me to
  discover that a more or less meticulous observance of convention during forty
  years or so, a reasonably decent reputation, and a habit of avoiding what is
  known as lawlessness, were not masks that could affect the final outcome.
  Theoretically, having had parents who hired somebody to teach me morals, I
  had never quite forgotten the necessity to play safe with a watchful
  Providence; but there was something in the Catechism I remembered about the
  forgiveness of sins, and it came as something of a shock to realize that all
  that I had done, for good or evil, must produce inevitable consequences, for
  me or against me, as the case might be.</p>

  <p>I daresay all beginners, when they think a while, face that
  predicament.</p>

  <p>It seemed, to state it mildly, not quite just that a man should have to
  face the consequences of an act he did in ignorance of the Law of
  Retribution. Nevertheless, exactly like a landlord pocketing his rents, I
  felt the justice of receiving compensation for investments on the side of
  virtue, whether made in this life and in ignorance of Karma, or in past lives
  utterly forgotten. We enjoy our income. It is outgo that obliges us to
  think.</p>

  <p>Reincarnation, logical though it might be, began to lose that roseate,
  romantic lure that first appealed to my inquiring mind. I started there and
  then to reconsider it, and much more critically.</p>

  <p>But that was where a little understanding entered in. I had been looking
  forward to possess Theosophy &mdash; to make of it a tool with which to
  tickle self-esteem and cut a nice wide swath along contenting aeons of
  eternity. The first glimpse makes the brain reel! It was the humor of my own
  imagination that upset that view of things. Some spark of Theosophical
  illumination made me wonder just how long the universe would last if each of
  us might manage his own destiny unguided by experience and by Intelligences
  higher than our own?</p>

  <p>That thought began to lead me somewhere. Who, or what, is this that shall
  be guided by experience? Our bodies? Possibly, to some extent; but the
  experience of past lives hardly could be said to educate a body that
  developed from an embryo in this one; neither could a body destined to be
  burned to ashes be supposed to have much influence on future lives. Though
  atoms, or the subdivisions of which atoms are composed, are indestructible;
  and though our bodies are an aggregate of atoms, purposely assembled in
  accordance with a law beyond our comprehension; though the atoms so assembled
  undergo a change and are dispersed for other uses &mdash; so that you, or I,
  or anyone may have the dust of Alexander in our veins and Caesar's clay may
  stop a bung-hole; nevertheless, the education of those atoms comes a long way
  short of answering the riddle of the universe.</p>

  <p>The brain? Another congeries of atoms, grouped within a section of a skull
  and destined to disperse at death. The brain of Socrates, of Plato, and of
  Shakespeare was returned into the common storehouse of disintegrated matter
  when the change took place that we call death. And unimaginable though it may
  be that the particles of matter they employed to clothe their bones were not
  affected by the thinking that they did, and not enriched by the association,
  none the less those scattered particles are not, and never can have been, the
  man.</p>

  <p>Who is the man? What is he? We all identify ourselves with blood and
  bones, and we undoubtedly provide our blood and bones with mixed experience.
  The most conservative of scientists admit that evolution seems to be a fact
  in nature, and that all things are in process of becoming something else. The
  brain-chambers of skulls discovered in the prehistoric drifts are differently
  shaped from those we humans use today, which would suggest, at any rate, that
  men knew other limitations than our own when those skulls had employment.
  Yet, the owners of the skulls could think &mdash; if not exactly as we think,
  still thoughtfully and to a purpose.</p>

  <p>Has all the thinking that they did died with them? Were the atoms of their
  vanished flesh the only beneficiaries of the lives they lived? Who were they?
  Is this all of them, or even the important part of them, that lies in a
  museum-case or in the gravel of a prehistoric river-bed?</p>

  <p>Theosophy does not withhold the answer, though the brain-mind may reject
  it and keep on rejecting it, until it has exhausted all the arguments of
  habit, all its prejudices, and the stored-up miscellany of remembered
  speciocity acquired at second-hand.</p>

  <p>The brain-mind clings to what it thinks it knows, and dreads
  enlightenment. I know mine did, and does, and I believe myself not different,
  except in relatively unimportant details, from the rank and file of ordinary
  men. As we identify ourselves with flesh and blood, that flesh and blood in
  turn identifies itself with us and it grows very difficult, in consequence,
  at times to differentiate. But surely it is evident, that if we are that
  flesh and blood and bone and brain that, at our death, is buried and decays,
  then there is not much hope for us as individuals and such experiences as we
  suffer or enjoy can be, at best, a school for atoms.</p>

  <p>And we know, though we are clothed in atoms , that ourselves are something
  vastly more. The very atheist, who says he disbelieves in anything but what
  his senses indicate, himself is proof upstanding of Intelligence so subtle
  and pervading that the atoms he assures us are himself took shape and grew
  into the thing he thinks he is.</p>

  <p>Theosophy unfolds to us two natures, spiritual and material, the one
  immortal and the other governed by the alternating law of life and death.
  That stuff that we discard, and that they burn or bury (brain and all), when
  we have "shuffled off this mortal coil," has been subjected to the alchemy of
  use and we have changed its nature &mdash; possibly not much, but we have
  changed it for the better or the worse. Who then are <i>we?</i></p>

  <p>It dawns after a while; and all the words in all the bibles and the
  dictionaries ever written lack ability to tell the wonder of it when it wakes
  into the consciousness. That knowledge comes to us in silence, though the
  world may yell with passion, and there rises in us from within a dignity
  beyond all measure &mdash; hope that is whole and deathless &mdash; an
  illimitable patience &mdash; and, like gentle rain on dry earth, the
  assurance of our own essential divinity.</p>

  <p>Then, actually for the first time, we begin to understand the teachings of
  Blavatsky and appreciate why, with the alternative of wealth at her disposal,
  she preferred a life of hardship and the task of bringing the Masters'
  message of the Ancient Wisdom to humanity.</p>

  <p>To understand that message is impossible, unless we do as she did: that
  is, let the lures of selfish ambition go. The love of reputation and of easy
  short cuts to a brain-mind Utopia, just as surely as resentment of injustice,
  and as subtly as contempt for others' seemingly less spiritual efforts, lead
  astray.</p>

  <p>There must be thousands who have read <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> and have
  leaped to the conclusion that the simplest, surest way to follow in its
  author's footsteps is to make the desperately toilsome journey into Tibet and
  there learn the doctrines from the Great Teachers, just as she did. There are
  some who have rejected the whole teaching of Theosophy because, to them, that
  journey is impossible. And there are others who, for other reasons, have
  assailed the mountain-passes and by dint of almost superhuman energy have
  reached what maps declare to be the heart of the forbidden land and then,
  returning, have announced in lectures and on printed page that Tibet is the
  home of superstition, so engrossed in ritual and devil-worship as to harbor
  no conceivable philosophy worth study.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding which, there is no doubt even in the minds of her most
  prejudiced accusers, who, for the sake of organized opinions that are
  tottering, and for their own emoluments that must cease when the world wakes
  up and thinks, would leap at another chance to vilify her &mdash; there is no
  doubt, even in the minds of those men, who have done their utmost to destroy
  her and her work, that H. P. Blavatsky did receive her teaching in the land,
  so inaccessible, that lies beyond the Himalayan range.</p>

  <p>There lies exposed the inconsistency of human argument. The man who fights
  his way against the wind and snow across the passes into Tibet may be &mdash;
  we may say undoubtedly he is &mdash; a marvel of endurance. He may be a good
  geographer, a linguist, an intelligent observer of barometers, and an exact
  recorder of the things he sees. But he is no more likely to unearth Tibetan
  secrets, or to recognize a Master if he met one face to face, than is a
  memorizer of <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> likely to become a true Theosophist
  without, in every deed of daily life, expressing &mdash; living &mdash; what
  he learns.</p>

  <p>It will be time enough to meet the Great Teachers when we know enough to
  make it possible to understand them; and there is no way of attaining to that
  state except by putting into practice daily, hourly, and with vigilance, such
  rudiments of wisdom as we now know, taught to us in elementary Theosophy. It
  is not book-learning only, it is deed-doing, that establishes Theosophy in
  human hearts. And no deed may be measured by the clamor that it makes, or by
  the number of the men who see it done, or by the market-price of its
  immediate result. Dimensions, weight, and price all vanish in the scales of
  Karma, leaving nothing to be judged but quality.</p>

  <p>The consciousness of our essential divinity includes a sense of the
  indignity of work not nobly done, no matter what the work is. There are no
  ranks in Theosophy, and no soft sinecures; who works well finds more work to
  do; our Leader is the busiest of us all.</p>

  <p>Now, as I said before, I write as a beginner, with the first impressions
  of Theosophy still easily remembered. I am sure of this: that we are all
  beginners, always. If we vigilantly guard ourselves against the idiotic
  thought that we are separate from others, favored more than others, capable
  of being or becoming greater than others; if we keep in mind that any virtue,
  any knowledge that we have, however individual it may seem to ourselves, is
  something we receive in trust for others' use and cannot be of benefit to us
  until we use it in behalf of others; and if, above all, we refuse to be
  deluded by the dream of occult powers that shall make us privileged magicians
  with authority to govern others by expedients unknown to them: then I am
  confident that each advancing step of spiritual evolution will reveal to us
  horizons that expand precisely in proportion to our merit, and the more we
  know from having done, not talked, the more there will appear for us to
  learn. And there is only one school actual experience.</p>

  <p>Thus the apparent paradox resolves itself into a plain fact: personality
  &mdash; the flesh and bones and intellect in which we temporarily appear on
  life's stage is, of itself, the least important part of us, being hardly more
  than mask and buskins; yet, that personality is all important in the sense
  that we must govern it, and that by our use or misuse of it we are
  judged.</p>

  <p>New dignity is thrust on us the moment we begin to let Theosophy emerge
  into our minds. As we identify ourselves with what is spiritual in us &mdash;
  with the incarnating ego, rather than with that in which it clothes itself
  for one appearance on the stage of evolution &mdash; we assume responsibility
  and are ennobled. No more whining at the "slings and arrows of outrageous
  fortune"! No more crawling on our knees to an imagined God to beg for favors
  or implore forgiveness! The remission of our sins becomes our own affair! We
  wipe them out, henceforth, by standing up and facing consequences, proving,
  by the way we meet those consequences, that a portion of life's lesson has
  been learned.</p>

  <p>So, less and ever less resentment; less unwillingness to bear our own
  blame for our own shortcomings. More sympathy for others (since we know the
  sting of criticism); greater, and forever greater tolerance. No more regret
  than is enough to help us recognize our own remissness; courage then, and
  faith, and hope, with now and then a little laughter at our own mistakes
  (since humor is the music of enlightenment).</p>

  <p>The means of the pursuit of happiness is changed. Wealth, fame, amusement,
  appetite, by gradual, unnoticed stages lose their charm, and boredom ceases
  because minutes become laden with new interest, new views of life. Reviving
  energy attacks life's problems in a new direction. Poetry and music &mdash;
  all the arts &mdash; assume new values; and the knowledge that the quality of
  work done is the measure of its value elevates into an art the very sweeping
  of a work-room floor.</p>

  <p>The grandeur that Theosophy reveals is like the sunrise. Shadows fade, and
  change, and cease, until a golden light gleams on a world worth working in.
  And at our feet &mdash; exactly at our feet &mdash; the Path lies, leading
  straight ahead. There is no need to look too far ahead. Each step rich with
  opportunity to think thoughts and to do deeds that shall lessen the sum total
  of earth's agony and add to the increasing harmony of nature.</p>

  <p>Silence is the best way to learn courage of conviction. It is easy to
  bewilder the beginner with confusing argument. Debate is best avoided. But I
  know this: once Theosophy has dawned into the consciousness, although a man's
  own weakness may betray him into lapses from the Path, and though he wreck
  himself beyond recovery in one earth-life; though cowardice should cause him
  to deny his faith, and death should find him neither brave nor ready, nothing
  &mdash; "neither death nor life nor angels, nor principalities nor powers"
  can deprive him of the knowledge that he has another chance awaiting him, and
  that the sins of this life may be faced again, and overcome, and used as
  stepping-stones to progress in the lives that follow.</p>

  <p>There is nothing purposeless, nor any set of circumstances that cannot be
  turned into enlightening experience. And death, that most religions have
  regarded as an enemy to be endured with dread, to the Theosophist becomes the
  friend that draws the curtain after one act of life's royal drama, while we
  rest a while in preparation for the next.</p>

     name="ref30">AS TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, December 1925</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">SENTIMENTALISM is the source of probably nine-
  tenths of human cruelty. Dickens' Bill Sykes was a sentimentalist, and so was
  Torquemada; so were all those proud conquistadores who destroyed the pagan
  culture of the Mayas; so were the crusaders ("louts in iron suits," as
  someone perfectly described them) who invaded Palestine to impose their
  ignorance on gentler people than themselves. Most of what is miscalled
  patriotism is the trashiest and least humane disguise of sentimentalism, as
  is easily discovered when events destroy the mask and open war begins.</p>

  <p>And there is this to be observed: the pot invariably calls the kettle
  black, that being one rule that apparently has no exceptions. Bill Sykes
  would have branded as a sentimentalist, or whatever the equivalent of that
  word was in his vocabulary, anyone who pitied Nancy. It is the invariable
  taunt that vivisectionists employ, when they attempt to silence criticism;
  whereas vivisection, being sentimentalism carried to the nth, reveals it as
  the vilest phase of human nature, masquerading under a pretense of
  dignity.</p>

  <p>The rankest sentimentalists are always the most cruel. History relates how
  Romans wept over the death-agonies of elephants in the arena; but the miles
  of gibbets on the Via Appia, each gibbet ghastly with its writhing human
  burden, grieved them not at all; nor did the death of gladiators. Men who
  most delight in sentimental songs are by no means always the least cruel. I
  remember a case in point. At a smoking-concert in London I sat next to a
  fellow who grew maudlin over a song about 'my gray-haired mother'; but when
  his mother arrived at the door and sent in a message asking him to come home,
  he went outside and kicked her so ferociously that the police arrested him.
  Nero, as sentimental a man as ever disgraced a throne, kicked his own wife to
  death, under peculiarly atrocious circumstances. 'Lynch-law' executions of
  men who have not been legally convicted could never occur unless
  sentimentalism first blinded the perpetrators, causing them to lose all sense
  of dignity and justice.</p>

  <p>It is necessary, then, before considering the problem of capital
  punishment to take care to dismiss as many sentimental prejudices as we can,
  and to guard that none shall enter into the discussion, not forgetting that,
  since sentimentalism is an evil in itself, it is as dangerous on one side as
  the other. A part, at least, of the responsibility for the execution of
  criminals (actual and alleged) in our said-to-be civilized lands, may be laid
  to the door of those who oppose the uncivilized practise all too frequently
  with grossly sentimental arguments. They kill their own case. Untruth is no
  remedy for untruth. It requires the truth about a situation to uncover its
  false basis, after which the remedy is more often than not forthcoming and
  acceptable.</p>

  <p>Theosophists, of course, need no persuasion. They were long ago convinced,
  on Theosophical grounds, that capital punishment is contrary to science, in
  the highest meaning of that word. Theosophy, continually widening its orbit
  in the world's thought, will eventually make the execution of criminals
  unlawful and unthinkable.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, though Theosophy is spreading faster than it ever has done and
  its consequences are apparent all over the world (even in the motion-
  pictures!), the resistance to its teaching is not likely to be overcome for
  many generations; for Theosophists to sit down and await that eventual day,
  as sleepers await morning, would be tantamount to a repudiation of their
  principle of Universal Brotherhood. Capital punishment will persist until a
  change occurs in human thought. That change, Theosophists must strive to
  bring about. The abolition of capital punishment will be one of the effects
  of the change, and will itself make further progress easier along the line of
  spiritual evolution &mdash; somewhat in the way that exercise promotes a good
  digestion and the good digestion makes it easier to take the exercise.</p>

  <p>It is no use to accuse of inhumanity the men who are entrusted with the
  gruesome task of enforcing a country's laws. A judge who sentences a man to
  death, a governor who refuses to override a jury's verdict and a judge's
  sentence, or a pardon board that, after full investigation, does not
  recommend a commutation of the sentence, is no more inhumane (and possibly is
  less so) than society which tolerates such laws.</p>

  <p>I have heard the argument propounded, that if juries were obliged to be
  eye-witnesses of every legal death to which they had condemned a fellow
  human-being, death-sentences would cease. But that is nonsense. In the first
  place, juries as well as judges are placed under oath to observe the law, and
  anything that should tend to undermine their honesty of judgment would
  corrupt the processes of justice that already function all too doubtfully.
  Juries have hard enough work to arrive at verdicts without increasing the
  perplexities in which they struggle.</p>

  <p>In the second place, whoever is not blind to the peculiarities of human
  nature, knows that horror, of whatever kind, grows fascinating after the
  first shock. If it were true that to force juries to attend the executions
  would prevent death-sentences, then it would be equally true that to force
  the public to attend bull-fights would prevent bull-fights; whereas the
  reverse is the case. Executions used to be held publicly in London, on a
  scaffold erected outside Newgate prison; these public executions were
  abolished, not because of the indecency or the disgust of passersby, but
  because the fascinated crowd flocked in such numbers as to block the traffic.
  <i>Whatever is brutal is brutalizing, and invariably leads from bad to
  worse.</i></p>

  <p>In order to abolish legal sentences of death, it must be logically shown
  to a majority of voters, that their reasons for legally murdering convicted
  murderers are wrong and foolish. That is easy to say, but not easy to do,
  because majorities forever think illogically, although individuals, not
  rendered half-unconscious by the trumpetings of sentimental oratory or the
  sensuous hysteria that maddens crowds, can usually comprehend a fact when it
  is decently presented. One difficulty is, that facts are hardly ever decently
  presented; an appeal is usually made to the emotions that are most
  discreditable to the human race. I have heard men, and women, too, when
  speaking in behalf of abolition of capital punishment, make use of arguments
  such as any demagogue well knows can be depended on to stir the passions of
  an audience.</p>

  <p>It will be reasonable, wise, and more in line with truth than not, to
  begin by admitting that those who have hitherto favored the legal execution
  of persons convicted of certain crimes, have done so, not from conscious
  cowardice or in a spirit of revenge, but for reasons that seemed to them
  dignified, judicious and, on reflection, weightier than any reasons they have
  heard advanced against it. To insult society with suggested, or with all too
  definite insinuations of deliberate unfairness, is no way to arouse a public
  sense of justice.</p>

  <p>It is stupid to assert, as I have heard asserted, that the voters do not
  think at all about the subject. Legal executions are all mentioned in the
  daily press, in the United States at any rate. All murder trials are reported
  in such fashion as to stir the thought of anybody who can read. It would be
  nearer to the truth to say that people think too much about murder and are
  too impressed by its increasing prevalence, with the result that &mdash; more
  on the theory, perhaps, that 'like cures like' &mdash; they listen to the
  sentimentalists who sob for vengeance. If left to themselves as individuals
  it is likely they would think their own way through the problems that beset
  the human race. But demagogues have learned, what the lower nature of each
  one of us knows instinctively: that sentimentalism stirred becomes a cloud
  beneath which it is easy to commit whatever treachery; with the result that
  efforts never cease to stir the sentimentalism of the public, and the
  business of thinking, always difficult enough, is rendered very difficult
  indeed.</p>

  <p>Who profits, or imagines there is profit in the execution of a
  criminal?</p>

  <p>The executioner, of course, is no more than the agent of the law-
  enforcing branch of government. It is the government itself that sees, or
  thinks it sees the profit. There is, first, the suggestion that the public
  safety will be easier to maintain after the convicted man is killed; and
  second, the consideration that it costs less and is more convenient to kill a
  man than to confine him where he must be clothed, fed, guarded and
  (distressing possibility!) perhaps re-educated into something the community
  could 'view with pride.'</p>

  <p>But in parenthesis it should be emphasized that governments are not
  intended to be scapegoats. They are, theoretically, representative of the
  collective public will; and if a government is stupid, not too honest, and
  (when honest) frequently mistaken in its methods, that is the result of our
  stupidity, of our dishonesty and our false reasoning. A government presents a
  picture of the public mind, and as the public mind improves, so does the
  government. But &mdash; be this also noted: contemplation of deformity,
  unless with the intention of improving it, may lead to substitution of
  deformity for right ideals. The Greek legend of Narcissus who, indifferent to
  Echo (the idea of his higher, spiritual self), became enamored of his own
  reflection in a pool &mdash; and perished &mdash; is as full of wise
  instruction as the ancient pagan myths invariably are.</p>

  <p>So, if we criticize the government, we do well to remember that we
  criticize ourselves and too much of that may lead to despair or indifference;
  but if, as the result of criticizing, we improve ourselves, our government
  will take example from us, just as our reflection takes example from us in
  the mirror.</p>

  <p>A government (elected by ourselves) is held responsible for the conduct of
  all public affairs, including administration of our laws and the protection
  of life and property. It finds itself presented with accomplished fact
  &mdash; a murder: an infraction, that is, of the law. A citizen, entitled to
  exactly the protection that the rest of us enjoy, has been slain by another
  citizen, who is equally entitled to society's protection against all those
  dangers that are recognized as such and have been made the objects of
  legislation. The murderer is caught, tried, found guilty, and put to death.
  The government &mdash; the agent of society &mdash; considers it has said the
  last word and has taken the only course compatible with justice, dignity and
  wisdom. But is this so?</p>

  <p>Statistics are misleading, and it may be merely a coincidence that the
  infliction of the death-penalty appears to prevent murder to some extent in
  one country, but not in another. The disparity suggests that there are
  national peculiarities, for instance, to be carefully considered in relation
  to those figures. The United Kingdom, where a sentence to the gallows follows
  swiftly on commission of a crime, has recently had vastly fewer murders in
  proportion to its population than the United States, where sentiment against
  the penalty of death is stronger on the whole and there are more ways of
  voiding a jury's verdict. "<i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc,"</i>* announce the
  advocates of hanging. But they leave out of the reckoning the fact that
  sentimentalism and a certain sort of lawyer have not made of the United
  Kingdom a breeding-ground of murder. No more can logically be deduced from
  the comparison than this: that there are fewer hangings in the United Kingdom
  because there are fewer murders; and there are fewer murders because
  murderers are neither hero-worshiped, nor flattered. In most European
  countries a murderer is regarded as a coward, and it is the stigma of
  cowardice that acts as the deterrent exactly as the public contempt for a
  wife-beater has almost abolished that crime in the United States.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i> (Latin) &mdash;
  "after this, therefore because of this." It is often shortened to simply
  <i>post hoc</i>... <i>Post hoc</i>, also known as "coincidental correlation"
  or "false cause", is a logical fallacy which assumes or asserts that if one
  event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second.
  It is a particularly tempting error because temporal sequence is integral to
  causality &mdash; it is true that a cause always happens before its effect.
  The fallacy lies in coming to a conclusion based only on the order of events,
  which is not an accurate indicator. That is to say, it is not always true
  that the first event caused the second event. <a href=

  . ]</p>

  <p>Society orders a murderer killed, is obeyed and confesses itself beaten by
  one individual, whose lack of self-control should make it clear to anyone's
  perception that he was below the average, not necessarily of a certain kind
  of intelligence, but below the average of manhood.</p>

  <p>We do not like to confess ourselves beaten at games, in business, or even
  when an earthquake shatters a whole city. Such calamities as periodically
  visit nations &mdash; epidemics, tidal-waves, fire, storm &mdash; challenge
  our intelligence and energy, our generosity, and all our finer intuitions.
  Yet, when one man kills another, can we think of no more manly course than to
  confess ourselves defeated and repeat his crime by killing him?</p>

  <p>Few people are legally executed nowadays except for a premeditated murder.
  It is gradually coming to be understood that sudden impulses derived from the
  lower nature are uncontrollable by individuals untrained in self-control.
  But was the legal execution not premeditated? Could there be, by any stretch
  of the imagination, a more thoroughly considered, planned and prepared
  killing than that perpetrated by society when it executes a 'presumably
  guilty' individual?</p>

  <p>If premeditation adds to the enormity of crime (as is conceded
  universally) society is much more guilty than the man it executes! When we
  amend the constitution or elect a president, responsibility is ours. So are
  the electric chair, the gallows and the gas-room ours; and it is we who have
  done murder when our agent, the official executioner, turns on the current,
  pulls the trap, or lets the gas into the air-tight cell. Whoever, without
  protest, or without such lawful effort as he can make, tolerates a public
  execution, must accept a full share of responsibility. He is accessory,
  before and after the fact, to a killing; of which the final proof is, that he
  pays, in the form of taxes, his share of the expense.</p>

  <p>So there is no escape from the responsibility. The blood-guilt rests on
  every member of society who tolerates the execution without lawfully made
  protest. That blood-guilt might be borne, perhaps, without indignity if no
  alternative were available. But is there none?</p>

  <p>Three favorite excuses in behalf of the death-penalty are: that it costs
  too much to keep a man in prison; that the risk of the sentenced man's
  escaping from prison by means of influence or legal subterfuge is too great;
  and that infliction of the death-penalty discourages other criminals. Which
  of those excuses stands investigation?</p>

  <p>The expense, to the state and to the accused, of any modern murder trial,
  vastly exceeds what it would cost to keep the convicted man in a thoroughly
  up-to-date and well-policed establishment for the rest of his natural life
  (supposing that were necessary.) There is no doubt in the minds of judges, or
  of criminal lawyers, or of anyone familiar with our legal processes, that the
  legal safeguards we have erected to prevent the condemnation of a man on
  insufficient proof, have acted rather as a way of escape from, than as an aid
  to justice. They have bred a class of lawyers (totally abhorrent to the more
  humane, less sentimental and deliberately honest bulk of the profession) who
  enrich themselves by battening off criminals and by defeating justice. The
  expense of a criminal trial both to the public and to the man accused,
  increases steadily; and so does the number of unquestionably guilty men who
  are at liberty through the misuse of legal technicalities. Sentimentality
  lies at the root of this state of affairs &mdash; a sentimentality stirred
  and aroused by experts in psychology, who, diligent in making profit for
  themselves, becloud the genuine issue, which is this:</p>

  <p>Crime having been committed, what course can the public profitably take
  with a view to the ultimate benefit of all concerned, the criminal
  included?</p>

  <p>As to the risk of a sentenced man's escaping from prison: that, again, is
  illogical and sentimental claptrap, as can readily be demonstrated. There are
  laws in certain states, devised for the protection of society and individuals
  against the ravages of tuberculosis. It is recognized that individuals in
  certain stages of that dread disease are dangerous to others, and that if
  allowed their liberty they are likely to spread the disease and consequently
  cause the death, not only of one or two individuals, but perhaps of many.
  They are therefore arrested and confined to suitable locations where they may
  receive attention from properly qualified specialists; and we are informed
  that, as a result of this, not only is tuberculosis decreasing but the
  patients themselves are often benefited.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the risk that a tuberculous patient might escape from one of
  those institutions and spread a deadly disease, is quite as real as that
  other alleged risk, that murderers might escape, on legal technicalities,
  from institutions to which they might be committed for their own reeducation
  and for society's protection. Consequently, it would be just as logical and
  vastly more far-reaching as a theoretical preventive, to send all tuberculous
  people to the gallows on the ground that (1) it costs too much to keep them
  in confinement and (2) they might escape if deprived of their liberty until
  cured.</p>

  <p>And now as to the third excuse: exactly the same argument applies. It is
  admitted &mdash; custom, common-sense, the law, society at large, and all our
  theories of government admit, that murder is not normal; that is to say, that
  a murderer is not on a par with the average man. His character is lacking in
  those qualities that make him a good citizen. Society has long ago accepted
  the responsibility of shaping character as well as of improving and
  protecting public health &mdash; hence the public schools and compulsory
  education, night schools for the education of the immigrant, and so on. There
  are even classes (although far too few) in certain prisons; and the properly
  accredited representatives of societies devoted to reforming prisoners are
  admitted into all the prisons of the land.</p>

  <p>But that is not all. It requires but a moment's reflection to realize that
  society as a whole, through its own neglect, mismanagement and lack of
  discipline, has done its share (in many instances a very large one) in
  creating the environment and underlying causes of the murder that one
  individual commits. It would be difficult to find exceptions to that
  statement that will bear examination. Murder is the offspring of insanitary
  mental environment as certainly as physical contagions spring from unclean
  drains, insanitary cesspools and the like.</p>

  <p>So there is no escape for society as a whole from responsibility, at least
  in part, and sometimes for a very large part, for whatever crimes its weaker
  individuals commit. And this responsibility has been acknowledged,
  practically and for many years, by means of the efforts society makes, and
  pays for, to eliminate the obvious injustices and public evils that incite to
  crime.</p>

  <p>When murder is committed, then, society has failed. It is responsible, in
  part at least, for the conditions that produced the crime. Accepting that
  responsibility, it undertook to remedy conditions, to police its
  neighborhoods, to educate its citizenry, and to uphold standards of morality
  agreed to as wholesome and dignified &mdash; exactly as it has also
  undertaken to set up, constantly improve, and steadfastly enforce, sanitary
  standards that are wholesome and scientific.</p>

  <p>When enforcement of the sanitary regulations fails, with the result that
  tuberculosis, or smallpox, or typhus ravages a whole community, the
  underlying causes are at once sought out and remedied. As far as possible the
  chief contributors to the insanitary state of affairs are found and brought
  to book. A campaign of re-education in that neighborhood is started promptly.
  And last, but not least, the dangerous and possibly guilty victims of the
  foul conditions are rounded up, cared for, given expert treatment, protected
  against their own ignorance, and kept out of harm's way until they have
  recovered.</p>

  <p>But when a murder is committed (one mere murder as compared to, possibly,
  a thousand deaths from a preventable disease) the mind-sick murderer is
  hanged or otherwise deprived of life and opportunity to learn the error of
  his ways! If the affair has been at all sensational (and the most obviously
  mind-sick cases cause the greatest amount of comment) newspapers by hundreds
  will print editorials invoking vengeance, sentimentally appealing to the
  passions of society that actually are the source of all the crime committed
  in the world!</p>

  <p>Dignity obliges us to care for the tuberculous, it being evident that
  though they are a danger to society, society itself contributed to their
  condition. So we quarantine them and re-educate them, taking care to isolate
  them from the victims of less virulent disease, lest the isolation
  institutions should become mere hot-beds for the propagation and
  dissemination of the germs. Why not isolate and educate the murderer. Not
  only would it cost less than to make the trial-court a tilting ground for
  rival profiteers. It would be dignified. It would enhance the public
  self-respect. It would constitute at least an effort to counteract
  destructive evil with constructive good. It would eliminate that sentimental
  irritant of crime &mdash; bravado; there is no cheap heroism to be had from
  isolation, as a citizen whose character is sick; nor would the remedy, of
  discipline and schooling, tempt undisciplined and ignorant, immoral men and
  women to commit crime for the sake of posing in the limelight.</p>

  <p>There is a play called <i>Heliogabalus</i> written by Messrs. Mencken and
  Nathan, in which that peculiarity of human nature is adroitly used.
  Heliogabalus, the Roman emperor, sentences to an excruciating death some
  members of a new creed that is annoying him; but he discovers that these
  people simply yearn for martyrdom, so he cancels the sentence, thus depriving
  them of the reward for which they have so selfishly and sentimentally
  disturbed the public peace! Self-pity, self-advertisement, vanity and false
  ideals (too often mingled with a consciousness of grave injustice) tend to
  stir fanaticism in the minds of people of unbalanced character. Make death at
  the hands of an executioner the penalty for giving rein to their passionate
  impulse, and they begin to imagine that death heroic.</p>

  <p>But let it once be known that he who slays shall be regarded as an
  individual whose character is ailing; that he shall be taken from the
  limelight, quarantined, provided with a wholesome occupation, medically
  treated, and firmly disciplined by experts who are under no delusions about
  heroism &mdash; and he will hesitate before he gives his passions rein as
  juries will not hesitate to convict.</p>

  <p>The conscientious dread of sending a man to his death who may, after all,
  be innocent, too often impels juries to let individuals go free who obviously
  are a danger to society. The knowledge that a verdict of 'guilty of killing'
  would entail re-education for the convict, and his rehabilitation should he
  not be too degraded to recover in one lifetime, would remove not only one of
  the main difficulties in obtaining juries but also, by eliminating
  nine-tenths of the sentimentalism that confuses issues, would encourage
  reasonable verdicts.</p>

  <p>The advocates of capital punishment assert that the majority of murders
  are committed by young criminals addicted to the use of drugs and so
  conscienceless as to be beyond the reach of moral suasion; that the
  prevalence of murder is a product of the war; and that prison holds no
  terrors for the bandit who will 'shoot to kill.'</p>

  <p>But terror is no remedy. When prisons were insanitary hells, in which the
  sentenced men and women were deliberately starved and bullied, there was no
  resultant lessening of crime. The criminals, released after they had served a
  sentence, repeated their crime and returned into prison more frequently than
  they do nowadays, when prisons are less terrible.</p>

  <p>If drugs have anything to do with it, as seems to be admitted by most
  investigators, then society must accept the responsibility. By failing to
  control the distribution of the medically necessary drugs, and secure the
  suppression of the traffic in unnecessary ones, society is just as much at
  fault as if it had neglected to inspect the sewers. If the drugs made young
  men murderous, the isolation of those young men in a place where drugs were
  unobtainable, with scientific discipline unsentimentally enforced, would
  provide the reasonable remedy besides removing the attraction of a
  mock-heroic death. Many a youth educated among seasoned criminals and
  maddened by the recent war, as well as irritated by injustice and
  psychologized by public sentimentalism, feels the same way about death by
  execution as the prize-fighter feels about a possible defeat in the ring. He
  regards himself as a 'good sport' if he accepts the risk, and as a 'poor
  sport' if he does not. He imagines for himself a glamor in being hanged. He
  mocks society, and his intelligence assures him that the public proves itself
  contemptible by hanging him. He would feel very differently toward isolation
  and a scientific course of education calculated to expose his own degeneracy
  to his own awakened consciousness.</p>

  <p>It is no doubt true, the war aroused a murderous bravado in the minds of
  many of the weaker characters who had no voice whatever in declaring war, no
  share in its atrocities, and no remotest notion why the war was fought. Their
  characterless, utterly unmoral attitude toward life made them as susceptible
  to 'crime waves' as a slum environment would have made them susceptible to
  disease of the body. Society accepts responsibility for slums &mdash;
  eradicates them, cleans them, punishes the landlords, and endeavors to
  restore to health the victims of the slum conditions. Did society not cause
  the war? If the results of war include a murderous proclivity among the
  country's youth, does the penalty of death for young men who have yielded to
  the war-psychology approximate, or even vaguely suggest, justice?</p>

  <p>There was far more justice in the ancient 'pagan' rule that he who slew
  should recompense the slain man's family, and that if he had no property from
  which to make a reasonable tribute he must yield himself into their service.
  Crude, and capable of harsh interpretation though that system was, it did
  accept the principle that death is not a remedy for death and vengeance is
  not justice. It was an attempt, however rudimentary, to yield to any man,
  however criminal his character, the right to rehabilitate himself. It
  recognized the fact that breaking platters does not mend plates.</p>

  <p>I recall an execution I was forced to witness as the official
  representative of a colonial government. The man had been convicted of a
  triple murder, after fair trial, in the course of which all the evidence was
  carefully investigated although the man had already confessed his guilt.
  There was no doubt whatever about the facts of the murder, or about the law
  of the land; the jury and the judge had no alternative but to find the man
  guilty and sentence him to death. Efforts, after he was sentenced, to have
  him certified insane, were abortive; the doctors, who would have liked to
  save his life, found no insanity, and the law, being such as it was, had to
  be carried out.</p>

  <p>Knowing I would have to witness the man's death, and having done what
  could be done, in vain, toward obtaining a reprieve, I spent as much time in
  the man's cell as the regulations would permit, in part, in the beginning,
  out of curiosity to know what thoughts were passing in his mind. I have
  never, since, heard of a case that more completely covered the situation of
  the 'average' criminal condemned to death, although the details were
  superficially different from most.</p>

  <p>He was a half-breed. That is to say, from earliest infancy he had suffered
  social ostracism and, despite intelligence above the ordinary as well as a
  full share of energy and ambition, practically all the well-paid and
  dignified callings were closed against him. He had been obliged to seek
  companionship among other half-breeds, all of whom suffered from the same
  disadvantage and resented it with concentrated bitterness. He had a
  worm's-eye view of things. He had observed that his alleged superiors were
  better paid for doing less work; accorded dignity, although infrequently
  entitled to it on their merits; better housed and fed than he had ever been
  without, as far as he could see, contributing as much as he did to the public
  effort; privileged to misbehave, in ways for which he would have suffered
  punishment; apparently taxed less and favored, as he saw it, by the law, the
  church, society at large, and even by the miserable layers of humanity
  considered lower than his own.</p>

  <p>He had inherited a grievance. He had done his best, or what appeared to
  him to be his best, to remedy the situation. Coveting a 'cushion up in
  front,' as he expressed it, he was relegated to a 'place where you can sniff
  the gravy as it goes by.' And although, for the sake of his poorly paid job,
  he had behaved himself apparently respectfully toward his betters, he had
  suffered all his life long from resentment, that increased as he dwelt on it
  and discussed its irritating causes in the only intimate company that society
  permitted to him.</p>

  <p>That is the case of the average criminal. It is the case of nine murderers
  out of ten &mdash; an undeniable grievance, irritated by a consciousness of
  baffled energy and of superiority (whether physical, intellectual or along
  the line of mere brute courage) to many of those members of society who pass
  for his betters.</p>

  <p>Exactly the same form of resentment, widely enough spread, and given time,
  produces revolutions &mdash; always has produced them &mdash; always
  will.</p>

  <p>The man under consideration, nursing his grievance and thoroughly
  convinced, from observation, of the sheer futility of expecting any justice
  from the public, found himself presented with an outlet for his indignation.
  He proposed to himself to marry the daughter of a man, whose strain of white
  blood was reputedly not quite so much diluted as his own. The girl,
  apparently, was willing but the father heaped insults on him and, to add to
  the indignity, spread slanderous reports, which were believed by two of the
  man's friends, who turned on him. So he found himself without friends and the
  butt of ridicule; and when he sought for legal remedy he was informed that no
  criminal law had been broken and that his only recourse would be a civil suit
  for damages, for which he had not nearly enough money, even if he could have
  produced the necessary witnesses.</p>

  <p>So he began to brood over his wrongs and to drink, although he was not
  drunk on the day when he at last let passion have its way, and went and
  murdered the three men who had maligned him. On the day before his execution,
  this is what he said:</p>

  <p>"You're white and I'm not. You've never felt what I've been through, but
  I've heard you admit that you don't know what you would do if you had the
  half of my inducement. All right. Now I'll tell you this; and it's straight,
  from as deep inside me as a man can dig when he's to die tomorrow morning: I
  had to kill those three men. There was something crept into me, and took hold
  of me, that was stronger than reason, and stronger than fear, and stronger
  than me. But I would have been stronger than 'it,' if somebody had come along
  and been my friend <i>before</i> it took hold of me. But nobody did come, and
  they were all my enemies. If anyone had asked me a week ago 'would I do it
  again?' I would have answered 'yes'; and I tell you, I meant to die tomorrow
  morning cursing the mother who brought me into the world. But you've talked
  me into feeling different. You've made me feel friendly &mdash; honest
  friendly &mdash; for the first time since I can remember. You've made me feel
  &mdash; " (He hesitated and sat still for a long time, searching for words
  with which to express himself.) " &mdash; If I could have another chance, I'd
  lick that thing that &mdash; that came over me like a sickness and &mdash;
  but you can't understand. It was something that wasn't me, and I stood it off
  at first. But it felt good, and I didn't feel so lonely and downhearted when
  I let myself go. So I did. And it got me. And I went and killed."</p>

  <p>I had told him nothing about reincarnation, because, in those days,
  although I believed in it, I did not know anything definite or authoritative
  and did not care to urge what might be my mistaken views on a man in his
  desperate situation. I had merely expressed to him my conviction that we are
  all members of one purposeful universe, and had encouraged him to talk to me.
  But this is what he said:</p>

  <p>"Somehow or other you have made me feel that I can wipe out what I've
  done. I'll die tomorrow feeling pretty good, because that balances the score.
  The public that's going to hang me has done me more cruelty than ever I did
  to those three, and I suppose the public'll have to pay, the same as I'm
  paying for my outbreak. Come to think of it, I'm sorry for the public.
  They'll have to pay dear, and they won't know what they're paying for! Well:
  do you know what I believe?"</p>

  <p>He stood up, squared himself, and seemed to throw off the last dregs of
  the depression that had overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>"I've only thought of it this minute, but I'm going to stick to it and die
  thinking of it! I believe I've been in the world before, and I've been
  suffering this time for past offenses. And I believe I'm coming back."</p>

  <p>"Supposing that's true," said I, "what will you do when you come back?
  "</p>

  <p>He was rather slow with his answer and by the peculiar smile on his face I
  judged that he was thinking of revenge. However, he surprised me:</p>

  <p>"Next time," he said, "I won't be fooled by things. I'll take my medicine.
  I'll know more. Say: it seems like a pity doesn't it, that I can't stay on
  and get some practise this time!"</p>

  <p>I agreed with him, and I still agree with him. I saw him die, and he was
  unresentful &mdash; occupied, I thought, with the new glimpse of the meaning
  of life, that had dawned on him in his last hours. There was a dignity about
  him that impressed all those who saw him at the end.</p>

  <p>And it appears to me, that there would be more dignity about ourselves, if
  we should isolate our murderers and spend the necessary money, time and
  energy required to educate them to that point of view, instead of cheapening
  ourselves by wreaking a disgraceful vengeance. Actually, criminals present us
  with an opportunity to learn how to rehabilitate them. But do we try? I think
  not. We vacillate between a nauseating sentimentalism that permits the
  criminal to take advantage of us, and a brutal sentimentalism that induces us
  to act as criminally as the criminal we hang. Why not accept responsibility
  and face it, and begin to challenge crime by showing criminals how they can
  &mdash; nay, must &mdash; like all of us, offset the past by building for the
  countless lives to come?</p>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, January 1926</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">UNLESS one should be what the Australians so aptly
  describe as a 'wowser;'* or a propagandist for some crazy brand of politics;
  or a dyspeptic; or one of those unfortunates who crave for 'self-expression';
  I suppose the most difficult question to answer is: Why do you write? But the
  question is perfectly fair &mdash; particularly if the writer has not made
  the answer obvious in every single story he has written. The enormous cost of
  ham and eggs in the United States is no excuse for posing in the limelight;
  the 'ham' might all too justly appear in the form of a sobriquet &mdash; the
  eggs out of the cases invoiced to the trade as 'rots and spots.' Since Caesar
  wrote his 'Commentaries' and President Wilson penned his 'Fourteen Points'
  there has always been ample excuse for putting any writer through a third
  degree.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>wowser</i> (Australian slang) &mdash; straight-
  laced person, prude, puritan, spoilsport. <i><a href=

  Slang Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>He may be posing as our superior; in which case he should be made to prove
  it or be still. He may be, tongue in cheek, too skillfully and much too
  greedily outreaching for our pocket-book; if so, then <i>caveat emptor</i>.*
  But he is possibly a fellow human being, tolerant of others' weaknesses since
  he is conscious of his own; a rather happy man because he likes things,
  thoughts, and people; a man who finds life fabulously interesting and who
  makes up tales about what he has seen and heard (and thinks he has
  understood), for the excellent reason that no other course provides him such
  a satisfying outlet for his energy. That man is worth considering on his
  merits. If his books provide the reader with a hundredth part of the
  enjoyment he himself had, writing them, then fellow human beings may share
  his entertainment without grudging him a good seat at the show.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Caveat emptor</i> (Latin) &mdash; Let the buyer
  beware! The axiom or principle in commerce that the buyer alone is
  responsible for assessing the quality of a purchase before buying.
  <i><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/50/C0175000.html">The American
  Heritage Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Or so it seems to me. And life is entertaining. Also, it is splendidly
  worth while. Nor am I one of those unfortunates who never knew the seamy side
  of it, or felt the desperate emotions of the under-dog. Though I have written
  ten books and, I suppose, ten times as many stories for the magazines, I have
  never yet succeeded in inventing for the vilest villain situations more
  embarrassing than some that have occurred to me; although, except in <i>The
  Ivory Trail,</i> I have written nothing in the nature of autobiography.
  However, I must make that statement with a reservation.</p>

  <p>I suppose that, first and last, at least five hundred people have asked
  me: How is a story written? There are three unanswered letters on my desk
  now, in each of which that question is put; but I believe that whoever could
  answer it truthfully, could also tell what holds the stars in place.
  Repeatedly I have put that problem to myself and other writers, but I have
  never heard or read an explanation that explained.</p>

  <p>However, I am almost sure of this: as fishermen develop 'fish sense';
  horsemen achieve 'horse sense' (some, of course, are born with it); musicians
  develop ability to listen to the music of the spheres; and painters educate
  their eyes until they see what other men cannot distinguish until it has been
  selected for them, and interpreted in paint, and framed; so writers, who are
  not too densely wrapped in dogmatisms of their own or (worse yet!) dogmatisms
  learned at second-hand, inflicted on them by the pundits of mediocrity, learn
  how to use what I must call a sense for lack of any other word in English
  that suggests it.</p>

  <p>Oskar A. H. Schmitz, in a recent essay in the <i>K&ouml;lnische
  Zeitung,</i> asks: Does a writer need to know anything? But the answer is,
  that a writer does know. If he does not know, he cannot write. He knows as
  the musician hears, and as the painter sees; although I don't know how he
  knows, and I certainly can't explain it.</p>

  <p>But to know is not nearly the whole of the problem. There remains the
  technical, extremely difficult, accomplishment of differentiating, of
  selecting, of interpreting into literary form, and of convincing the reader.
  A man may know where fish are, but it is another thing to catch them, and
  still another thing to get them, fresh and pleasant to the eye, to market. It
  is possible to fish for mackerel and catch dog-fish. There are also
  jellyfish, and some sorts that are poisonous.</p>

  <p>One other thing seems obvious to me: we humans are as composite as any
  other thing in nature. We are capable of unplumbed depths of infamy, and of
  unreached heights of godliness. In each of us are all the elements, both
  spiritual and material, that go to make up what is human nature in the
  aggregate. We are microcosms of the macrocosm. Consequently, what a man
  writes in his books (though incidents and details may be all imaginary, and
  though nothing in the book is therefore true, in one sense of the word)
  essentially is a picture of his own mind, of his own life, of his own (latent
  though they may be) possibilities.</p>

  <p>Shakespeare was not Falstaff. He was capable of being Falstaff. He was
  capable of being Hamlet. He knew all about both those characters and all the
  others because their essences were in himself. What made him the greatest
  dramatist since Aeschylus was his (divine, I like to think) ability to read
  his own rich human nature, to select from it, and to write down what he knew
  in an appealing way.</p>

  <p>The intellect, I think, is a machine that can be constantly improved, and
  that only wears out when allowed to lie idle or bury itself into pits of its
  own digging. As the intellect improves with use a writer (or any other
  individual) should find new phases of humanity to wonder at, and ponder over,
  and admire; he should discern new aspects (new to him, at any rate), and by
  abandoning old views incur the obloquy of inconsistency. The obloquy is very
  good for him, because it will reveal to him a wealth of unexplored
  intolerances in himself.</p>

  <p>The only thoroughly consistent people are the dead ones. Let them bury
  their own dead. Our business is living, and life is a perpetual ascent from
  peak to higher peak of comprehension.</p>

  <p>So what is a tale, after all, but a picture of any man's mind? And does it
  make the slightest difference, when you have read the book, or before you
  have read it, that you should know its author stands seventy-three inches in
  his boots, weighs one hundred and eighty-five pounds, has a wife and an
  Airedale dog, and once walked all the length of Africa? The important
  question is, what thinking has he done? And is he a 'wowser' or a 'muckrake'?
  Are his villains human, and his heroes and his heroines not too immaculate?
  Can you read his book without wishing you had not? And does he make you feel
  that there are wide horizons, unfenced and not marked 'No Trespassers,'
  toward which any one may go adventuring without incurring self-contempt?</p>

  <p>The latest of my own books, <cite>OM</cite>, has brought such floods of
  correspondence that, although that makes me feel acquainted with all manner
  of agreeable folk in many lands, there is some difficulty in reserving time
  enough in which to write another book! How much of it is true? Is Tsiang
  Samdup a real Lama? Where is the Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup
  published? Who is Ommony in real life? How did I learn my Indian lore?</p>

  <p>To answer the last first, I don't know. That it is lore, is apparent to me
  from the sparks that fly wherever its flint strikes steel; I have no other
  means of determining. Ommony, in 'real' life, is myself or any other man who,
  if only for an hour or two, sees a vista of events from his particular point
  of view. So is the villain, Dawa Tsering, who is, after all, more villainous
  than vile (like most of us). The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup
  probably was published at the time when the Stars of the Morning danced and
  sang. As I was fortunate enough to glimpse a page of it, I have been generous
  enough to share it. What more can I do?</p>

  <p>If Tsiang Samdup is not real, how could it be possible to write a book
  about him? If I had known more about him, would I not have written it? And
  all of it is true, except the bad part, and the weak part, and the artless,
  dull, uninteresting part. It is as true as you are in your interesting
  moments.</p>

  <p>What next? I have filed away eight hundred letters asking for a sequel to
  <i>Om</i> &mdash; <i>The Secret of Ahbor Valley.</i> I am keeping them to
  remind me not to write it! I would rather try to put a pair of arms on the
  Venus of Milo, or invent an ending for Schubert's 'Unfinished Symphony.'</p>

  <p>There is a beach near San Diego where the gulls make music, to a swelling
  and descending obbligato of surf thundering on sand. It is a usually lonely
  beach, but there is something in its harmonies that stirs imagination and
  establishes remoteness from the jazz of 'realism' by lifting, now and then,
  the curtain that obscures reality. I go there, maybe as the ancients once
  went to Eleusis;* that is, not invariably with success because it is a
  difficult trick to leave opinions behind, and incredulity, and zeal, and all
  that other rubbish with which we stop our ears and clog our understandings.
  (The Gods are not exactly lazy, but they are self-respecting and refuse to
  waste good mystery on work that we should do ourselves.) But once in a while,
  as at Eleusis in the ancient days, the veil is lifted; so, if I can only
  overcome the bewildering difficulty, experienced by every musician, painter,
  and writer, of translating into definiteness the elusive visions seen (and
  almost understood), there will be a much better story than <i>OM</i> before
  long. Be good enough to wait, and I will do my utmost not to disappoint
  you.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Eleusis</i> &mdash; an allusion to the the
  Eleusinian Mysteries &mdash; the annual initiation ceremonies for the cult of
  Demeter and Persephone based at Eleusis in ancient Greece. Of all the
  mysteries celebrated in ancient times these were held to be the ones of
  greatest importance. These myths and mysteries later spread to Rome. The

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, April 1929</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">VOLUMES that are marvels of research and detailed
  facts concerning Easter have been published. Wonderful works are available in
  which the esoteric meaning of the Easter-celebrations is explained. Sermons,
  some of them so full of inspiration that they shake the battlements of
  sorrow, have been written, spoken, thundered &mdash; and remain, a few of
  them, as indestructible as THAT of which they vibrate in the hearts of men.
  The simpler are the better, and the Gospel-story, stripped of comment, stands
  as luminous and stirring as on the day when it was written. And yet no man
  needs another volume than his own, his inward heart, in which his own
  divinity responds to inspiration from the ONE, by whom, in whom, he lives,
  has lived, and is to live forever. "I have risen" is the thought &mdash; and
  then the murmur &mdash; then the song of triumph of the Soul that learns,
  within itself, what Easter means.</p>

  <p>There are as many Easters in the universe as there are conscious beings.
  Easter is not limited to time or place; it knows no season other than the
  mainspring of all seasons and the changeless change forever burgeoning all
  buds until the blossoms scatter pollen on the rain-wet face of Nature. Easter
  is within you, as the power is within that puts forth poems &mdash; as the
  harvest is within the seed, the end in the beginning. Easter's "I have Risen"
  is the answer to the challenge of the Lords of Life, on watch, who demand,
  through the dark of the Valley of Death: "Who comes?" That valley is the very
  Gates of Glory, and the password "I have Risen" rips the veil of misery and
  shows what none may see, save only those whose tested courage gave them title
  to the Word long lost, and only to be found where it was lost, within the
  heart of him who lost it.</p>

  <p>There is a dewy-wet, warm wonder of delight that only Easter morning
  knows. But it is always Easter morning when the heart remembers it is young.
  It is darkness that is old and dying. Youth lives on forever, though its face
  be hidden for a while by creeping shadow. As old as Truth is and as young as
  Love, is the Life that sings because the Light within can &mdash; does
  &mdash; and everlastingly will conquer, shadow and all dreams of darkness.
  Grief is no more than a shadow of the inward pilot-light that leads through
  Silence to the dimless Sun.</p>

  <p>And it is written, Fear not. That was uttered when the new-created shapes
  first loomed in Chaos, limiting idea within form and line, illusion gilding
  glory until glory seemed to vanish in the veil of finite cause and fearful
  consequence. The dawn of Easter is a reinterpretation, which is resurrection;
  and the gloaming that retreats before it and the darkness, is the death of
  fear. And there is neither sin nor sorrow where no fear is.</p>

  <p>But we are in fear; we exist in it. Then fear is like the feathers of the
  flame that hatch the Phoenix's egg. Its agony shall change into the alchemy
  of rebirth. That Phoenix who is hatched in flame knows better than to linger
  in the restless nest; he flies forth sunward and he needs no brooding; he is
  born full-pinioned, knowing that the flame which hatched him might, if he
  should linger, scorch his flying feathers. Jesus was not twice crucified. He
  let fear wreak its havoc on the only thing that fear could touch, which was
  illusion. When illusion left him, burned up in that agony, he went forth
  free. That was Easter morning. I is written that he gave thanks.</p>

  <p>Fear not! We become destroyers when we let fear fight out battles. We
  identify ourselves with fear and wear its livery, its coat of arms and crest.
  We emblazon its motto &mdash; "What is Truth?" &mdash; on helm and
  breastplate. We become not only front-rank fight-men against the very Truth
  we seek, but we are also foragers, recruiting agents, pick and-shovel men,
  and propagandists for the tyrant &mdash; Fear, the origin, the instigator and
  the owner of all anguish and its fruits. To be afraid of fear and of its
  phantoms is to be in bondage. It is Easter morning when we recognise the
  nothingness of fear.</p>

  <p>And when we see that void &mdash; that emptiness &mdash; and know that it
  is void, there fills it on the instant THAT which neither fear can find nor
  darkness dim. There floods in on the consciousness a rhythm such as no
  inharmony can silence and no limits touch. It is the balanced peace that
  passeth physics and all logic and the desires, and from the Tyranny of
  Things. And who shall speak of that, when that dawn breaks. Who needs? An
  empty nest &mdash; dark cells are visited &mdash; old gloom forgotten, and
  old foolishness unraveled and undone &mdash; dead ashes of desire,
  wind-scattered, fertilizing someone's birth &mdash; the tale has told
  itself.</p>

  <p>Is Easter then abandonment? Are things a sacrifice that should be thrown
  into a Moloch's jaws, that we may burn our way into a real and thingless
  bliss? It is not written that the Lords of Life require the waste or loss of
  one single[?] concept. Reinterpretation is not ruin. Made and unmade, known
  or unknown, everything has its use and has its place in the eternal plan; if
  we are guardians, not owners of the things we say that we possess. We build
  on blasphemy and limit life &mdash; we close against ourselves the real gates
  of affluence, by craving too much ourselves[?] and the selfish ownership of
  things. By desire[?] we undo all effort. It is Easter morning and we know all
  affluence is ours &mdash; all beauty and all goodness. It is Easter when the
  heart is bursting with the vibrance of the Spirit and owns all universes and
  denies no wanderer a home, no traveler a right of way.</p>

  <p>And shall we get, then, out of Easter more than we put into it? The very
  shadows of our own dreams mock such melancholy unwisdom. Unto him who hath
  the dawning knowledge of what Easter means, more knowledge shall be given,
  until Easter morning wakens him at last with music that the Silence sings
  above, beneath, without, within the chattering inharmony of matter. We get
  nothing out of Easter. What need? We put nothing into it! Why should we? What
  does the All-giving need? And what does the All-having lack? It is Easter
  morning when we know within our hearts that all's hear &mdash; all's well
  with the universe &mdash; and when the password rings within the inward
  consciousness &mdash; the answering, spontaneous, inevitable: "I have risen!
  I lack nothing! I have all endowments of all values; and forever all the
  gates of affluence, in all the spheres, are open wide! I give. Forever I
  forgive. For I have risen!"</p>

     name="ref33">SPIRITUAL MAN IS ETERNAL:<br>
  THERE ARE NO DEAD!</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, July 1929</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">THE APOSTLE Paul wrote: "I die daily"; and he meant
  exactly what he wrote, without reserve or equivocation. But Paul had the
  advantage over us moderns in that he wrote for people thoroughly familiar
  with theories of life and death that have become submerged since his day
  &mdash; submerged in part by the after-wave of Paul's own huge enthusiasm.
  Deathless and indestructible in essence, insofar as they were based on truth
  and rooted in absolute being, they were doomed as theories to die awhile, as
  men die too, and, like men, destined to be reborn in after time.</p>

  <p>Theories are, after all, not more nor less than bodies of ideas, even as
  our bodies are the temporary clothing of our souls. True ideas reincarnate
  into theories on the cyclic tides of time, as our bodies do also[?]; the
  temporary clothing of our souls. True ideas reincarnate into theories on the
  cyclic tides of time as certainly as do all other forms of the Eternal
  &mdash; forms so infinite that he who seeks to limit them or number their
  incalculable changes is as silly as the savage trying to put sunlight in a
  bottle. Every atom in the whole created universe 'dies daily,' if we mean
  what Paul meant by the words.</p>

  <p>But must we therefore so identify ourselves with death, by act of will or
  lack of spiritual energy, that we become death's servants? In an age so given
  to advertisement that neither creed nor politics nor tooth-paste can resist
  oblivion without such struggles for publicity as would have paid the whole
  expense of Caesar's armies, death is better advertised than are all the other
  old and new illusions that human flesh is heir to.</p>

  <p>Death is as importunate as cigarettes; daily we are asked to make a blind-
  fold test of it &mdash; to choose which death we would prefer to die &mdash;
  instead of testing life with open eyes and choosing which life we shall
  prefer to live, which half-a-second's thinking should suggest were much more
  profitable. Death and taxes, says the many-jawed-machine made myth, are
  inescapable. But are they? Death of what? Taxes to whom payable?</p>

  <p>If we must render unto Caesar what is Caesar's &mdash; and we must, as
  even stars must render overflow of glory to the night &mdash; are we thereby
  identified with Caesar's dim, inglorious beginning, with his vanity and
  vices, with his end at the mercy of any accident that stutters through the
  cogs of human prejudice? If we should render unto God the spirit that is
  God's and that we feel within us, who shall tax that? Can death reach that
  holy thing?</p>

  <p>Dying daily is the art of living. It is the art of letting go all
  prejudices &mdash; of refusing to be buried in the shrouds of dogma &mdash;
  of repudiating selfishness. It is the lower self that dies &mdash; that lower
  self which, caught between the prongs of Karma, can, if we permit, provide us
  with opportunity to learn and put in practice what we have been born into the
  world to learn and inwardly digest.</p>

  <p>That inward WE is not these bodies that we too much value or, in moments
  of discouragement, accuse like dogs who bite the stick that beats them.
  Bodies are the suits we wear, in which to strut out parts on life's amusing
  stage; and there is no greater mistake than to suppose that the actor should
  so emerge himself into the part he plays as to forget his own identity.</p>

  <p>"I and my Father are one" &mdash; not, be it noted, I and my body are one.
  If we forget that the Eternal Man is deathless, as long as we forget (no
  longer) we become death's victims, self-identified with the illusion which we
  came into the world to conquer; worse than victims, traitors; we submit
  ourselves to be the instruments of cruelty, deceit, and death, increasing
  others' difficulty, adding to the sorrow of the world instead of mastering
  our share of it, and squandering the overflow of vibrance for the benefit of
  others. We become bad actors, whimpering for praise, entitled to no better
  than the rotten eggs of a disgusted audience.</p>

  <p>For we forget, sometimes, there is an audience. Each man, as Shakespeare
  wrote, in urn plays many parts, and it appears to be a law that each of us,
  in course of time, must don dark buskins and a drab cloak, signifying
  loneliness. An empty stage, swept of its flowers that paid gay homage to some
  other actor &mdash; properties suggesting affluence and comfort all departed
  to the wings &mdash; dim light and the howling of lonely wind &mdash; no
  opportunity for bombast &mdash; silence that makes the house seem empty.
  Dread presents no opportunity for bombast &mdash; silence that makes the
  house seem empty. Dread presents itself. Sorrow is so encompassing that joy
  seems like a litter of decaying jetsam on the beach of grief. No support, no
  prompter &mdash; and an audience wholly unseen.</p>

  <p>Is that a despicable part to play? It is the greatest part of all, the
  richest in opportunity. It is a challenge to the actor who is cast for it to
  fill that stage so full of a divine unconquerable spirit that his victory
  over desolation charges life anew with faith and hope and sends his audience
  away refreshed &mdash; as earth is stirred to new endeavor by the assault of
  spring against the tyranny of winter storms. The actor may, if he chooses, so
  forget his own identity as to assume the very substance of the part and go
  down under it to earned oblivion. It is his privilege, however, to remember
  who he is, and who his audience &mdash; that unseen audience forever instant
  to detect good work, forever eager, when the curtain rings down, to applaud:
  "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."</p>

  <p>Death, to such an actor, is the open door to Life, not too soon to be
  entered, since he knows there is no hurry and no need for it. He meets all
  anguish and adversity as a front-rank fighter, rapier in hand &mdash; the
  rapier of faith; unwilling to betray one trust by grudging one last effort,
  knowing that every blow he strikes at the world's belief in purposeless
  calamity is struck for all eternity and all mankind. He knows, too, that the
  Lords of Life are cognizant and judging, not the noise he makes and not the
  fame men give him or withhold. They judge the quality of courage and of faith
  and good-will that he adds to the relief of tired humanity. Though death to
  him is Life Triumphant, since he knows that he and his immortal soul are one,
  and are one with Life Eternal, he refuses to accept release in death until
  the hour of victory when Life at last enfolds him in such Light that men no
  longer see him, and the shadow that they thought was he, disintegrates.</p>

  <p>For him, that is the curtain. He has played his part. His audience was not
  the men and women of the world; they, too, are players. For the Lords of Life
  and for the ever present Brotherhood he did his utmost. He has earned and
  retires to enjoy their comradeship in another phase of the eternal drama of
  the progress of the Soul of Man; his knowledge that the Eternal Man can never
  die, having raised him to the ranks of the Helpers from the undisciplined
  flocks of the helped.</p>

  <h3>Written upon the death of Katherine Tingley, leader<br>
  of the Point Loma, California, Theosophical Community<br>
  Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, September 1929</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">HAIL AND FAREWELL! You have led beyond that veil
  through which we follow presently; and you have left your light &mdash; no
  Jack-o'-lantern &mdash; golden glowing where it may be seen with the inward
  eye that measures neither height nor distance but judges values. Hail and
  farewell!</p>

  <p>What is leadership? We, who have trodden the dust and mud of stricken
  fields, where our friends died gallantly and we were left to wonder for whose
  profit and to what end they died; we, who have lent enthusiasm to the tumult
  of the war of words when politics pretended to be Providence and old illusion
  brayed new panaceas; we, who have prayed in the crowded pews of churches, and
  have gone forth hungry from a meal of moldy words, to try to understand
  life's irony; we, who have been misled too often into ambuscades and have
  beheld such virtue as we thought we had, yield all its vanity and leave us
  naked to the hail of discontent; we, who have tasted now and then the
  bitterness of false ideals sturdily pursued &mdash; and of true ideals lip-
  served, but betrayed; we, who have nevertheless, perceived, though dimly,
  something of Katherine Tingley's goal and something of the Spirit that
  inspired her to lead upward to it, can, it may be, answer better What is
  Leadership? than they can who have felt themselves too self-sure to be
  led.</p>

  <p>She was no empurpled Caesar, cadging votes and flattering opponents until
  opportunity revealed an opening into which to thrust the sudden violence of
  drilled troops craving plunder and the feel of pride. Nor was she a Diogenes,
  contemptuous of human practice and so proud of theory as to shrink from fact
  and to hunt by lantern-light for undiscoverable honesty; since she was
  honest. She had honesty to share, to give away, to pour forth from a hilltop
  and by day-light &mdash; honesty of motive, purpose, method, thought, speech,
  aim and &mdash; last, but not least, tolerance.</p>

  <p>Integrity devoid of tolerance is more unkind than tyranny that frankly
  names itself and forces means to a mistaken end. Hers was the integrity that
  strikes no bargain with inhumanity in any form. Fanaticism never touched her.
  Harmony, the essence of her teaching, was no goose-step drum-beat to which
  everyone must march in step or else be relegated to the pains of purgatory or
  the dump-heap of the damned. Her sense of harmony was cosmic and included
  good-will and encouragement for all those not in step with her, who, none the
  less, strove upward toward glimpsed ideals.</p>

  <p>And she knew &mdash; no woman in the world knew better &mdash; that the
  surface shows but seldom what goes on within the secret cauldron of the human
  heart, where spiritual alchemy transmutes a chaos of corrupted hopes and
  fallen aims into a fertile mold for the reception of the seed of re-birth.
  Having faith, in man's essential divinity as well as in the omnipresence of
  divine Life, she sowed that seed continually. And because the Truth was in
  her she was patient and not discouraged by the semblance of delay. Love,
  which was the secret of her courage and the substance of her efforts, let her
  not be misled by appearances or baffled by sour ingratitude. She knew, and no
  amount of ignorance could overwhelm her knowledge. No ingratitude could shake
  her faith, though it struck repeatedly with all its venom at the brave heart
  that preferred to suffer indignity and injustice rather than retaliate and
  injure someone else. So she was one whose meanest enemies if privileged to
  get to know her, became admirers &mdash; even friends.</p>

  <p>She led. Truly she led, and not in circles but in spirals. All her
  way-marks pointed upward. With the natural gifts that were hers, and with the
  strength of purpose and unflinching will that never failed her, Katherine
  Tingley might have reaped, had she so chosen, any prizes whatsoever that the
  world could offer. Personal wealth and what is known as power could have been
  hers for the merest fraction of the effort that she spent on leading tired
  humanity toward a nobler goal.</p>

  <p>But she was true to her charge. She never flinched from it. She never even
  wavered. In the face of bitter accusation, mistrust, misunderstanding,
  apparent defeat and confusing advice from those who loved her but who could
  not see the outcome that she saw, she steadfastly clung to her principles and
  trusted wholly in the Law of Universal Brotherhood, that she taught with all
  her skill, and that she served with all her might, not compromising with
  convenience, not seeking her own reward but leaving that to the Lords of Life
  who mete out Justice.</p>

  <p>Whatever rewards the world had showered on her, it is sure that Katherine
  Tingley would have shared them to the last atom with those in need. But the
  world was a little asleep and, for the most part, missed that opportunity;
  she was left to lead her loyal cohort ill supplied with funds, and far too
  much of her abundant energy was used on problems of material supply, whose
  utmost stringency, however, never made her yield or even think of yielding.
  She never begged; who gave to her, gave freely and his gift was multiplied to
  ten times ten by wisdom in the use to which she put it.</p>

  <p>This earth is crowded with memorials to men and women who have led in some
  direction or another, some of them with great zeal and high-flung purpose.
  Tower on tower, the piles commemorate great merchants; statesmen and soldiers
  stand in effigy; the great ships, racing to the world's ends bear the names
  of famous men, some few of whom led upward; though the great majority were
  pleased to let themselves be lifted by a tide of popular greed or
  indignation.</p>

  <p>Very few indeed have dared to stand against such tides or cared to lead
  their little cohort upward while the legions took the long descent in the din
  of emotion and glamor of prosperous guile. Yet some names stand unsullied,
  though contemporaries sought by all known means to blacken them, and each of
  us can number on the fingers of his two hands those who sought unselfishly to
  lead a people, or a group of peoples, to a higher sense of Brotherhood and
  Universal Law. And now, lest we dishonor judgement, let us add the name of
  Katherine Tingley to that list, and build for her a high memorial in our
  hearts.</p>

  <p>She led. Faithfully, truthfully, loyally; tolerantly, generously and with
  malice toward none, she led whither all may follow, up the middle of the Path
  of Justice where the effort of each pilgrim earns exactly its own recompense
  and each one wins his way by merit and no other means. Her appeal was to the
  heart of all humanity, and she has left her light within men's hearts that,
  if they let it not grow dim, it shall inevitably lead them to the view of
  visions such as she saw, and to victories over all the powers of darkness,
  such as she has won.</p>

  <p>A very great Leader has passed beyond the veil which hides from mortal
  eyes the secrets of the Life Beyond. Let those who hope to follow on the Path
  she trod look well to it that they lack not gratitude. No other oil will burn
  as brightly in the lamp she lit. No other key than gratitude can unlock
  secret after secret until we, too, following her footsteps, find that we can
  tread the Middle Way.</p>

     name="ref35">THREE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</a><br>
  <small>KENNETH MORRIS &mdash; FLINDERS PETRIE &mdash; SPENGLER</small></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Theosophical Path</i>, November 1929</h3>

  <p style="text-indent:0">ACCUSTOMED as it is to violence the mind of man
  enjoys the military metaphor; it likes its similes assembled from the
  ordnance-list. Such words as 'cannonade' and 'culverin' suggest a victory and
  their significance is all heroic, since imagination dims itself toward the
  other aspect. If I liken Kenneth Morris to a lonely culverin assailing
  Bigots' Castle the suggestion should not be extended to include the
  'villainous saltpeter' and the malice. Year in, year out, he has kept on
  cannonading the redoubts of ignorance, and now a breach begins to show,
  through which, it may be, even the 'authorities' will march with blaring
  bands &mdash; forgetful of the man who laid that lonely culverin and served
  it faithfully; ignoring the great general who gave him that fatiguing post;
  and thoughtful only of the plunder. For there will be plunder when the walls
  are down and men see history with unobstructed view. There will be riches
  beyond dream, of food for the intelligence and stimulus for the imagination;
  treasures from the fabled past that turn out to be beautiful and true;
  recovered provinces of knowledge in which educators will discern that
  evocation is a higher calling and the grandeur of the ever-present past is
  rediscoverable in the hearts of men.</p>

  <p>It was H.P. Blavatsky, of course, who fired the first arousing shot. She
  carried the first entrenchments. Men and women rallied to her, some of whom
  went down before the shafts of ridicule and slander, or lost the way amid the
  smoke; and some grew weary. But before H.P. Blavatsky died she had
  accomplished what she came to do, and had assembled an unconquerable nucleus
  of followers. The doctrine of the Ancient Wisdom had been re-established in
  the western world; and under William Q. Judge, and Katherine Tingley, it has
  been lived and proved and made to flourish.</p>

  <p>In the days when Katherine Tingley, demonstrating her ability to lead,
  appointed Kenneth Morris to a professorship of history at Point Loma, there
  was probably no other college principal on earth who would have dared to
  endorse such entirely unorthodox views as his were reckoned by the so-called
  educators who controlled the text-books and examinations. Those were the days
  when we had to suppose that the world was created in a week, six thousand
  years ago, or else be punished for impertinence and infidelity.</p>

  <p>But Kenneth Morris had answered H.P. Blavatsky's trumpet-call while his
  youthful intelligence was still in process of being cribbed, cabined, and
  confined within the said-to-be so safe and comfortable walls of orthodoxy
  -literary, racial, and religious. A preliminary necessary to a powerful
  explosion is compression. The rule applies throughout dynamics. So it may be
  that the iron-ribbed doctrines of the public schools of England deserve
  credit for the consequent effectiveness of the explosion when the spark lit
  by H.P. Blavatsky fired the youth's imagination and he wrote a school
  prize-essay that excluded him forever from the cage of dry-as-dust
  pol-parroted, polite belief in the incorrigible savagery of the ancients and
  the <i>ne plus ultra</i> culture of ourselves.</p>

  <p>At any rate, he broke forth &mdash; flew forth &mdash; sang his song
  &mdash; and has been singing ever since beside the sea, in Lomaland, whence
  his songs and his poems, his wholly unorthodox views and his brilliant survey
  of history as cyclic evolution, have been spread to all corners of the earth.
  Children of a quarter of a hundred nations have received from him the spark
  he caught and cherished from the anvil of the Founder of the Theosophic
  Movement.</p>

  <p>Kenneth Morris saw and wove into a rhythmical, broad-visioned series of
  lectures the long hidden facts of ebb and flow in history. Not once avoiding
  the authentic facts as given in <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> and the other
  writings of the modern Founder of the Theosophical Movement, nor trespassing
  beyond the pale of record into legend (lest the easily disgruntled critics
  should accuse him of constructing his own evidence) he took the commonly
  accepted facts and reinterpreted their meaning with a logic and a clarity of
  diction that permitted no misunderstanding. Criticasters might find any fault
  they pleased with his discovery and his elucidation of it, but they could not
  pretend to misinterpret it. He had defined the issue, marshaled the
  acknowledged facts, and thrown a concentrated light on evolution in the
  history of man.</p>

  <p>He accepted the Ancient-Wisdom teaching of the law of cycles;
  investigating history he applied it, recognising that the law is universal
  and that, consequently, no phase of existence can escape its government. As
  tides flow back and forth, the seasons follow one another in their order, and
  the night embosoms day, so there are days and nights of evolution in which
  nations feel the impulse of creative energy and rise &mdash; until the
  inescapable, imponderable law removes the energy and they decline, through
  twilight, into darkness &mdash; until energy returns and they again become a
  force to reckon with.</p>

  <p>By illustrations from the pages of recorded history Professor Morris
  showed, and proved, that the average length of the cycle &mdash; from the
  rise into the clash of world-importance to descent into comparative obscurity
  &mdash; is one hundred and thirty years, the span not varying by more than
  insignificant degrees accounted for by the discrepancies of records and a
  margin for opinion as to just exactly when a rise began or a descent was
  finished.</p>

  <p>It was caviare to the general doctrinarian. It stung the pride of the
  proponents of the Nordic theory of race-supremacy and the philosophers who
  judge intelligence by color of the epidermis or possession of a craving for
  machinery, to be invited to agree that Oriental races have attained to higher
  culture than our own and will again surpass us when the time shall come. And
  he offended them by speaking of pralaya and manvantara, two terms that
  suggest esoteric teaching. It was all very well, it might be and perhaps, to
  assert an unorthodox theory; but to use terms (comprehensible to two-thirds
  of the world) whose use implied that the ancient 'heathen' who invented them
  knew anything worth knowing, was an insult to men possessed of framed
  certificates from colleges. Some of those colleges could actually boast four
  centuries of repetition of the same poll-parrot cries! Great is Diana of the
  Ephesians! <i>Vox literati vox dei</i>! Was there ever a time in history when
  they, whose honor and emoluments depended on established theories, did not
  denounce the man with broader and less marketable views?</p>

  <p>It certainly was scandalous. Professor Morris boldly taught that we are
  not the last word in civilization, morality, intelligence, government,
  artistic enlightenment, philosophy, or in any other field; that, on the
  contrary, the storied past holds records of peoples who have far surpassed
  us, as the crest-wave of the Force that causes evolution lifted each in
  turn.</p>

  <p>We were parceling up China when he made his first explosive observations.
  Races, whose progenitors were savages when China reached her apogee of art
  and scientific government, were landing missionaries then, under the guns of
  warships, to teach the Golden Rule to 'yellow heathen' while their
  governments greedily watched for the first chance to avenge a murdered
  missionary and seize the richest slice of the defenseless country. From
  burned and rifled palaces of Peking, loot was being brought by stokers and
  their commanding officers &mdash; loot such as no modern hand could imitate
  nor any auctioneer appraise &mdash; to be sold in second-hand shops to the
  heirs of what has been politely called 'the white man's burden.'</p>

  <p>The future is likely to prove that burden to be heavier than the loot was
  that the sailors freighted home; but it was more unfashionable then than now
  to mention Karma. "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord," was a nice
  theoretical, incomprehensible, quotable, innocuous abstraction meant, if
  anything, to absolve men of responsibility for what they do.</p>

  <p>Men bent on proving to themselves that temporary might is final right were
  not in any mood to listen to the doctrine of the cycles. To have believed
  that all our boasted superiority is as evanescent as "the flowers that bloom
  in the spring, tra-la," and will have "nothing to do with the case" when
  Nature-Forces acting in obedience to Law withdraw the energy so many of us
  have abused, and concentrate it elsewhere, would have robbed supremacy of
  zest. It might have lessened zeal. The second-hand shops might have had to
  change the signs above their plateglass windows.</p>

  <p>I remember being warned against Professor Morris. I was told he was not
  'recognised' by the 'authorities' and that his 'iconoclasm' was only atheism
  in disguise. According to my informant, a college-principal who had charge of
  the education of several hundred youths, there would be anarchy in education
  as well as religion and 'disaster would undoubtedly ensue' if such 'red
  heresies' should be allowed to gain a footing. He argued that if children
  were allowed to question the infallibility of text-books; to consider the
  possibility that 'heathendom' has ever reached our heights of intellectual
  attainment; or to believe that 'heathen' ever shall be able to surpass us
  unless, or until, they adopt our standards of civilization and morals; then
  patriotism would cease to exist and within a generation 'culture' would
  vanish along with it.</p>

  <p>He admitted that he himself had not read the works of Professor Kenneth
  Morris, and he advised me for the future to confine my reading to the books
  of standard authors, of whom he very kindly made a penciled list on the back
  of an envelope. The name of one of them was Flinders Petrie.</p>

  <p>"You will find those writers safe and sane," he assured me. "If they
  differ here and there in detail, they agree as to essentials. Their
  interpretation of the meaning of the facts of history will give you plenty to
  think about and will help you to appreciate the glories of our present
  civilization."</p>

  <p>However, Kenneth Morris had given me 'plenty to think about,' so it was
  only very recently that there was time to study Flinders Petrie, whose
  historical works on ancient Egypt long ago won him recognition as one of the
  ablest of modern historians. Books that can be slipped into the pocket are
  attractive in this hurried age, so it was almost by Darwinian selection that
  the first of Petrie's books to be attempted was <i>Revolutions Of
  Civilization</i>, the first edition of which was published in April 1911.</p>

  <p>That date is important. There seem to have been only three editions of the
  book, so it is fair to presume it is much the least popular of Flinders
  Petrie's works &mdash; a circumstance that hardly causes wonder. He agrees
  with Kenneth Morris!</p>

  <p>It appears that at the time when Morris, the Point Loma 'heretic,' was
  formulating his 'dangerous iconoclasms,' Petrie had already ventured into
  print with arguments and illustrations &mdash; and the statement (page 5)
  that "civilization is an intermittent phenomenon." He outlines a theory of a
  law of cycles and crowds his short book with evidence in proof of it. He
  refers to the 'summer' and 'winter' of racial rise and decay as the recurrent
  phenomena produced by natural causes which should be "examined like any other
  action of nature."</p>

  <p>Instances in the realm of astronomy and other sciences are numberless in
  which individuals, working alone and in ignorance of each other's efforts,
  have made identical, or almost identical discoveries simultaneously. There is
  sufficient evidence of this to justify a theory (even if the law were not
  already known and understood by those who keep alive the teachings of the
  Ancient Wisdom), that Truth, being universal, and its manifestations being
  also obedient to the law of cycles, finds its way into human consciousness
  recurrently, availing itself of whichever individuals in any place are ready
  to receive it at that time. The spirit flows along the line of least
  resistance, like water, electricity, sound, currents in the air, or any other
  form of energy.</p>

  <p>A very careful reading of Professor Flinders Petrie's book discloses no
  evidence that he has read <i>The Secret Doctrine</i>, which is the source
  from which Professor Morris drew not only inspiration but his argument.
  Professor Flinders Petrie beyond question followed his own line of study,
  dared to let imagination raise him far above the level of the judgments of
  his day, and with the courage of conviction published what imagination
  glimpsed. The fact that <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> had been long in print
  detracts in no way from the merit of his book; he is entitled to full credit
  as an independent thinker; and is fortunate that the teachings of the Ancient
  Wisdom confirm him while repudiating the more commonly accepted notions of
  what history means.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Flinders Petrie's statement of his case is not as clear or
  comprehensive as that of Kenneth Morris; he did not consult <i>The Secret
  Doctrine</i> &mdash; it is possible he never heard of it and consequently had
  to grope his way amid the facts of history at the guidance of his own
  intuition, tracing the periodic rise and fall of nations mainly through
  observations of the renaissance and decadence of art, of which he gives
  profuse illustrations. His only reference to "the great and important
  elements of moral ideas and religion" is the remark that he has chosen to
  omit them altogether &mdash; probably a wise omission in the circumstances;
  had he ventured to include them in his outline he would surely have needed a
  thousand pages instead of one hundred and thirty-one, and would inevitably
  have aroused the indignation of those hierarchies of conservatism who
  belligerently loathe the dignified ideals which the plan of spiritual
  evolution indicates.</p>

  <p>There is enough in Professor Flinders Petrie's book to stir imagination
  and to compel thought, which is the principal requirement in this age of
  standardized ideas. It actually matters very little whether the historians
  and scientists, who day by day confirm through 'new' discoveries those
  statements of fact for which H.P. Blavatsky was mocked, do or do not credit
  her with having definitely and in no uncertain words forestalled them all
  some half a century ago. The point is that she did her work. She broke, as it
  were, the crust of human consciousness; since when, that inner wisdom that is
  the heritage of all humanity has been gradually working its way through.</p>

  <p>Professor Petrie's book is so condensed that it is no simple matter to
  make extracts from it that will fairly indicate the point of view from which
  he has approached his subject; he has knitted his whole theme together
  admirably and included nothing foreign to the issue; to remove one statement
  from its context and to quote it in support of him might have the opposite
  effect to that intended. Here and there, however, there are phrases
  indicative of a vastly wider vision than his book includes; hints though they
  are, they suggest that he has seen through more than one veil while he
  pondered his solution of the rise and decay of nations.</p>

  <p>One illuminating statement that he makes is that "the power of <i>vox
  populi</i> is a regular feature of a decaying civilization." It needs courage
  to adopt that viewpoint in an age when nearly all material accomplishment is
  made contingent on acknowledging the voice of <i>demos</i> as the arbiter of
  destiny. He also mentions parthenogenesis (as he calls it) affirming that in
  the birth of nations there is no such element &mdash; wherein he is stoutly
  supported by <i>The Secret Doctrine</i> and by Professor Kenneth Morris. He
  assures us "there is no new generation without a mixture of blood"; and his
  statement that, if generations average thirty years, each one of us must have
  had one hundred million ancestors in the course of the past eight centuries,
  should go far toward exploding the abominable theories of racial superiority
  that have made our vaunted civilization not much nobler than a cockpit.</p>

  <p>Mathematically it is evident that so-called 'purity of race' is a
  delusion. If it could exist, it would inevitably lead to racial extinction.
  And, as Flinders Petrie says: "When the full maximum number of different
  ancestors are blended, and every strain of one race has crossed with every
  strain of the other, this is the period of greatest ability."</p>

  <p>But it would not be fair to Professor Flinders Petrie to suggest by
  implication that he has confined his argument to racial admixture. Admirably,
  in the compass of his short book, he has indicated many other processes of
  Nature on the plane of objectivity; that these may be effects, not causes,
  hardly weakens the book's value. If he cites a famine, or a series of
  famines, as the cause of Arab restlessness or of Egyptian decay, he indicates
  by inference a subtiler cause again, behind the famine, and compels
  imagination to bestir itself, since he has raised already that suggestive
  theory of cycles.</p>

  <p>Professor Flinders Petrie's disadvantage is that he ignores the law of
  Karma and the hope-inspiring theme of the rebirth of individuals. There
  Kenneth Morris so far has the weather-gage of him that there is no
  conceivable comparison between their books. Morris explains convincingly and
  makes the heart sing with the knowledge of the cyclic progress, that always
  has been and forever shall be ours &mdash; where Flinders Petrie only gropes
  for a solution of the problem. He has observed, and he has reasoned shrewdly;
  he has given his imagination rein, and he has dared to set down what he sees
  &mdash; which is no mean performance and undoubtedly required the utmost
  courage. Imagination grows with exercise and there are more unlikely things
  than that Professor Flinders Petrie may discern such truths as shall
  illuminate the whole of his patiently acquired familiarity with ancient
  history and make him the outstanding historian of his age.</p>

  <p>And now Spengler, who has taken literary Germany by storm. He is the man
  who introduced philosophy to railway bookstalls. He philosophizes with a
  club, and his principal weakness seems to be his incandescent rage. He has no
  pity for the old school; he prefers to smash it and, like Flinders Petrie, he
  is not yet ready to replace the "incredibly meager and senseless scheme" with
  one that really solves the mystery of ages.</p>

  <p>In his book <i>Der Untergang des Abendlandes</i>, he boasts: "In this book
  for the first time an attempt is hazarded at determining history in advance.
  Its purpose is to pursue, through its still unrun stages, the destiny of a
  culture, and precisely the one culture on the earth at this time which is
  nearing completion: that of Western Europe."</p>

  <p>That expression, 'for the first time,' is amusing. Indubitably Spengler
  thinks he is the first to break into print in that field, and it may be that
  he needs the thunder of the boastful drums to call attention to the wares he
  has to offer. They are good wares; but they will be better when the quiet
  forward movement of Theosophy in Germany shall reach him and reveal to him
  that H.P. Blavatsky introduced immensely better ones some half a century ago.
  In his manner Spengler brings Nietzsche to mind. He is so vehement against
  the fallacies of education that he sees around him as to have no patience,
  and apparently not much hope. Like Flinders Petrie, though with less tact, he
  has drawn attention to the cyclic course of history and has ignored the laws
  of Karma and of Rebirth, without which there would be no logic in the law of
  cycles. He conceives of a logic of time as an organic necessity of fate, to
  complement his otherwise obviously incomplete conception of cause and effect
  as 'the logic of space'; and he seeks for a 'logic of history' but fails to
  find it &mdash; as any man must whose eyes are blind to the higher law of
  spiritual evolution, which includes the key to all the others.</p>

  <p>In common with Flinders Petrie, Spengler turns to the arts to illustrate
  his theory; but to Spengler 'culture' and 'civilization' have widely
  different meanings, which he stresses vehemently. A 'culture' according to
  Spengler precedes a 'civilization,' of which latter phase imperialism is the
  "typical symbol of conclusion." Our present phase is one of civilization, not
  of culture. "One may regret this, but one cannot alter it." It does not
  appear to have dawned on him that we are now creating our own future and that
  cycles, whether of decay or progress, do no more than to provide and to
  control the circumstances and conditions in which, and against which, we may
  struggle, if we will, toward a higher spiritual destiny.</p>

  <p>Spengler conceives of cultures as ('living organisms of the highest type,
  growing up in exalted aimlessness, like flowers of the field. They belong,
  like plants and animals, to the living nature of Goethe, not to the dead
  nature of Newton.... I see in universal history the vision of an eternal
  formation and transformation, a marvelous rising and passing of organic
  forms. The standard historian sees it as a tapeworm which is the
  'preliminary' to inexhaustible epochs." They are views magnificent that
  Spengler sees; he is a sure sign of the awakening of growth in human thought;
  but there is little he can do, except to break up into fragments the already
  damaged dogmas of the schools of thought he rails against, until the Ancient
  Wisdom shall include him in its orbit and reveal to him not only cultures
  that are living organisms, but cycles within cycles that know nothing of
  'exalted aimlessness.'</p>

  <p>It is a mystery, much more insoluble than any riddle that the Sphinx
  propounded, how Spengler reconciles exalted aimlessness with his equally
  stressed assertion that it is man's business to discover the particular stage
  at which history finds him and to govern his actions accordingly.
  Self-government implies a purpose, a conviction, and a goal. <i>Cui bono</i>,
  if exalted aimlessness is all that actuates the higher types of living
  organisms?</p>

  <p>Spengler is at his best in his destructiveness. He withers with his scorn
  the hobby-riding of the "highly intelligent connoisseur" concerned with "the
  mastery of absurd instrumental tone-masses and harmonic obstacles or with the
  'doing' of a problem in color." Everything, he says, is centralized, the
  metropolis dictating to the provinces what they shall think, and money is the
  standard of all measurement of value. This, he points out, parallels exactly
  the decay of Rome, where <i>panem et circenses</i> symbolized precisely the
  same causes that are undermining our latter-day civilization. He points out
  many other parallels &mdash; the many-storied tenements, for instance, of
  Byzantium and Rome and of our own great cities; Rome's financial magnates,
  whose burial monuments obscured the view along the Via Appia, and our own
  great capitalists, who, with similar immodesty, erect advertisements of their
  opulence. But Spengler misses the significance of all this. Though he can
  coin a flaming epigram in scorn of Guyau, Bergson, D&uuml;ring, Euchen, and a
  host of other thinkers, asserting that "they have dropped from the bird's-eye
  view to the frog's-eye view" and have become "mere theorists," he himself
  submits to us a theory that is only different from theirs and newer. He
  accepts quite cheerfully conditions that he holds up to our ridicule,
  asserting they are "part of an organic sequence, a type of historic act
  (biographically predetermined hundreds of years before.)"</p>

  <p>He recommends us to accept conditions also, his theory being that the only
  possible course left to the occidental intellect corresponds to Hellenic
  skepticism. "Everything," he says, "depends upon one's clarifying and
  grasping the situation; this destiny; one can deceive himself about it, but
  cannot disregard it. Whoever does not admit it to himself, does not count
  among the men of his generation. He remains a fool, a charlatan, or a
  pedant."</p>

  <p>Spengler possibly forgets that there were prophets of despair before his
  day, and that human hope perennially lives in spite of them. He has
  accomplished wonders of invective. But he seems so pleased with having
  pricked a few thin bladders and exposed the emptiness within, that he has
  neither capacity nor inclination left to discern what forces move the mere
  phenomena that he would sweep away as worthless. He prefers "the splendidly
  clear, highly intellectual lines of a fast steamer" to any of what he terms
  our present-day "stylistic trash"; and he prefers a Roman aqueduct to all
  Roman temples and statues. He seems to overlook the fact that even aqueducts
  and steamers are phenomena.</p>

  <p>But he is doing good. He is exploding bombs into the ranks of those who
  would like to pass laws to compel us to think as they dictate. He has none of
  Kenneth Morris's vision, none of Flinders Petrie's tact. It might improve his
  usefulness to learn that vehemence is very often merely waste of energy, and
  that scorn robs truth of its attractiveness. In ignorance of Spengler's age
  one hesitates to guess that he has yet reached forty. Time with its logic may
  suggest to him economy of invective, to the end that he may reach, through
  sympathy, a more distinct and hopeful view of that history which, he
  believes, he is the first lo seek to outline in advance.</p>

  <p>Flinders Petrie, diffidently, with authority and tact, has drawn aside a
  veil and rather hinted than asserted possibilities of new interpretation of
  the well-known facts of history. Spengler, a scornful bigot in revolt against
  the bigots, shakes the ranks of orthodoxy; he is likely to persuade few and
  to compel none to agree with him, although, like some 'revivalists,' he can
  create a nine-days' wonder and a stir intensely satisfying to his own esteem.
  Kenneth Morris, speaking with authority, because he had The Secret Doctrine
  to rely on, making use of the Key that H.P. Blavatsky brought westward, has
  unlocked the storehouse of antiquity. Whoever will, may enter, even though
  Spengler's diatribes suggest to them that there is no hope for the human
  race.</p>

  <p>These are signs of the times. There is a good time coming, when the
  western world will wake up and discern what history can teach about the
  proper use of energy. Then &mdash; hardly until then &mdash; we may expect a
  renaissance of art and government that truly shall surpass all former
  crest-waves of recorded history.</p>
