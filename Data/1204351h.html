<h2>FRATRI DILECTISSIMO</h2>
<h3>W. H. B.</h3>
<p class="poem">When we were little, wandering boys,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every hill was blue and high,<br>
On ballad ways and martial joys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fed our fancies, you and I.<br>
With Bruce we crouched in bracken shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Douglas charged the Paynim
foes;<br>
And oft in moorland noons I played<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colkitto to your grave Montrose.<br>
<br>
The obliterating seasons flow&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot kill our boyish game.<br>
Though creeds may change and kings may go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet burns undimmed the ancient
flame.<br>
While young men in their pride make haste<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong to right, the bond to
free,<br>
And plant a garden in the waste,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still rides our Scottish
chivalry.<br>
<br>
Another end had held your dream&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die fulfilled of hope and
might,<br>
To pass in one swift, rapturous gleam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mortal to immortal light.<br>
But through long hours of labouring breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You watched the world grow small and
far,<br>
And met the constant eyes of Death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haply knew how kind they are.<br>
<br>
One boon the Fates relenting gave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not where the scented hill-wind
blows<br>
From cedar thickets lies your grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor 'mid the steep Him&aacute;layan
snows.<br>
Night calls the stragglers to the nest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at long last 'tis home indeed<br>
For your far-wandering feet to rest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever by the crooks of Tweed.<br>
<br>
In perfect honour, perfect truth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gentleness to all mankind,<br>
You trod the golden paths of youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then left the world and youth
behind.<br>
Ah no! 'Tis we who fade and fail&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, from Time's slow torments
free,<br>
Shall pass from strength to strength, and scale<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steeps of immortality.<br>
<br>
Dear heart, in that serener air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If blessed souls may backward
gaze,<br>
Some slender nook of memory spare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our old happy moorland days.<br>
I sit alone, and musing fills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My breast with pain that shall not
die,<br>
Till once again o'er greener hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ride together, you and I.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In September 1913 I published a short sketch of Montrose*, which
dealt chiefly with his campaigns. The book went out of print very
soon, and it was not reissued, because I cherished the hope of
making it the basis of a larger work, in which the background of
seventeenth-century politics and religion should be more fully
portrayed. I also felt that many of the judgments in the sketch
were exaggerated and hasty. During the last fifteen years I have
been collecting material for the understanding of a career which
must rank among the marvels of our history, and of a mind and
character which seem to me in a high degree worthy of the attention
of the modern reader. The manuscript sources have already been
diligently explored by others, and I have been unable to glean from
them much that is new; but I have attempted to supplement them by a
study of the voluminous pamphlet literature of the time. My aim has
been to present a great figure in its appropriate setting. In a
domain, where the dust of controversy has not yet been laid, I
cannot hope to find for my views universal acceptance, but they
have not been reached without an earnest attempt to discover the
truth. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">J.

<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<h3>THE EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h3>
<p class="first">In a famous letter Keats has expounded life under
the similitude of Chambers. There is first the Thoughtless Chamber,
when man lives only for sensation; then comes the Chamber of Maiden
Thought, when he consciously rejoices in the world of sense, and
from this happy illumination acquires insight into the human heart;
thence open many doors&mdash;"but all dark, all leading to dark
passages." The simile applies not only to individual experience,
but to the corporate life of peoples. There come epochs when a
nation seems to move from the sun into the twilight, when the free
ardour of youth is crippled by hesitations, when the eyes turn
inward and instinct gives place to questioning.</p>
<p>Such a period commonly follows an age of confidence and
exuberant creation. We can see the shadows beginning to lengthen in
the early years of Elizabeth's successor, and they do not lift till
the garish dawn of the Restoration. It is dangerous to generalize
about an epoch, but the first half of the seventeenth century has a
character so distinct that it is permissible to separate certain
elements in its intellectual atmosphere, which affected the minds
of all who dwelt in it, whatever their creeds or parties. Whether
we study it in the record of its campaigns and parliaments, or in
the careers of its protagonists, or in the books of its great
writers, three facts are patent in contrast with its
predecessor.</p>
<p>"Is not this world a catholic kind of place?" Carlyle has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id=
"Page_16">[16]</a></span>written. "The Puritan gospel and
Shakespeare's plays: such a pair of facts I have rarely seen saved
out of one chimerical generation." The greatness of the Elizabethan
age was that it was catholic; that is, a number of potent, and
usually conflicting, forces were held for a brief season in
equilibrium. The Reformation had broken certain seals of thought,
but it had not destroyed the integrity of the Church. The Middle
Ages, in the monarchy and in much of the law and custom of the
people, co-existed with the new learning and the adventurous temper
of the Renaissance. England could conquer strange worlds and yet
maintain intact her ancient domestic life. The national mood was
one of confidence and ardour, so intent upon present duties and
enjoyments that it could permit the latent antagonisms to slumber.
But in the first decade of the seventeenth century the mutterings
in sleep became a restless awaking. The monarchy, when the great
figure of Elizabeth passed, was seen to be a medi&aelig;val anomaly, and
prerogatives hitherto unchallenged were soon a matter of hot
debate. The ecclesiastical compromise which created the Anglican
Church found many critics, and even those who accepted the fact
were at odds about the theory. Sanctions, which had seemed
imperishable, began to tilt and crack. The old world was crumbling,
and there was no unanimity about the new.</p>
<p>Following upon this loss of harmony in institutions came a
change in the national mood, which may be described, perhaps, as a
failure of nerve. The forthright enjoying temper of the
Elizabethans had gone; the world was no longer so simple and so
spacious; the stage had become full of questioning Hamlets. It is a
mood familiar to students of classical antiquity, and may be found
in high relief during the first centuries of our era. The weakening
of the social fabric, and consequently of the protective power of
society, increases the strain on the personality. The hopefulness
of youth is succeeded by a sad acquiescence, if not by despondency:
the eye looks inward; the soul is disillusioned with the world, and
seeks refuge elsewhere. It is the <i>preparatio evangelica</i>, for
it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17">[17]</a></span>turns the mind to God. In such a mood
religion comes to birth, for the worldliness of youth rejoicing to
run its course is exchanged for the spirituality of those who find
here no continuing city. Life seems no longer a thing to be shaped
by man's endeavour, and in every creed, from the predestination of
the Calvinist to the mystical Platonism of the scholar, it is
conceived as a puppet-play moved by the hand of Omnipotence.
Metaphysic has broken into a secure world, and with it have come a
sense of sin, a constant dwelling upon death, a haunting
consciousness of eternity.</p>
<p>Something of this temper soon became dominant in the land.
Robust spirits might reject it and recover the pagan standpoint;
wise men might struggle through it to certainty and peace; but the
shadow of it was universal, even in the defiance of the pagan.
There was everywhere a quickening and intensifying of certain
spiritual emotions, a sense of man's littleness and dependence upon
the unseen, a movement away from humanism towards mysticism, a
clouding of horizons which had once been so bright and clear. The
congregations which listened to Donne's analysis of sin and his
pictures of the "various and vagabond heart of the sinner" thronged
to St. Paul's because the preacher was in tune with their own
thoughts. Death was so much with them that they found comfort in
envisaging its terrors. There was satisfaction in the belittling of
life: "We have a winding-sheet in our mother's womb, which groweth
with us from our conception, and we come into the world wound up in
that winding-sheet, for we come to seek a grave."<a name=
"FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> The unthinkableness of eternity hag-rode their
imagination. "Methusalem with all his hundreds of years was but a
mushroom of a night's growth to this Day, and all the four
Monarchies with all their thousands of years, and all the powerful
Kings and all the beautiful Queens of this world, were but as a bed
of flowers, some gathered at six, some at seven, some at eight, all
in one morning, in respect of this Day."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=

"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id=
"Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<p>A consequence of such a mood was that men believed, as in the
days of St. Cyprian, that the youth of the world had gone, and that
they were living in its old age. The new science, the new
astronomy, assisted the mood by breaking down the old comfortable,
concentric universe. "There prevailed in his (Milton's) time an
opinion that the world was in its decay, and that we have had the
misfortune to be produced in the decrepitude of Nature. It was
suspected that the whole creation languished, that neither trees
nor animals had the height or bulk of their predecessors, and that
everything was daily sinking by gradual diminution."<a name=

mankind draweth fast towards an evening, and the world's tragedy

It is everywhere in the sermons of the divines. Man is "an aged
child, a grey-headed infant," and but a ghost of his own
youth.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "As the world is the whole
frame of the world, God hath put into it a reproof, a rebuke, lest
it should seem eternal, which is a sensible decay and age in the
whole frame of the world and every piece thereof. The seasons of
the year irregular and distempered; the sun fainter and
languishing; men less in stature and shorter lived. No addition,
but only every year new sorts, new species of worms and flies and
sicknesses, which argue more and more putrefaction of which they
are engendered."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=

"This is the world's old age; it is declining; albeit it seems a
fine and beautiful thing in the eyes of them that know no better,
and unto those who are of yesterday and know nothing it looks as if
it had been created yesterday, yet the truth is, and a believer
knows, it is near the grave."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id=

"The world's span-length of time is drawn now to less than half an
inch, and to the point of the evening of the day of th<span class=

grey-haired world."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=
"FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The result of such a belief was to cheapen the value of human
endeavour, to show human greatness as trivial against the vastness
of eternity. "Jezebel's dust is not amber, nor Goliah's dust
<i>terra sigillata</i>, medicinal; nor does the serpent, whose meat
they are both, find any better value in Dives dust than in
Lazarus."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> There was but one
paramount duty in life, to save the soul. "These are the two great
works which we are to do in this world: first to know that this
world is not our home, and then to provide us another home whilst
we are in this world."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
"FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a> "Build your nest upon no tree here," Samuel
Rutherford wrote to Lady Kenmure, "for ye see God hath sold the
forest to death." These are more than the commonplaces of theology;
they are the expression of a temper which, by the year 1630, had
become a background to thought, an atmosphere which insensibly
coloured every man's outlook.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
"FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p>In an age of uncertainty and change there is inevitably a
craving for definition and discipline. Even if this or that law is
dubious, Law itself is regarded as more than ever essential; in
Hooker's famous panegyric her seat is in the bosom of God, her
voice the harmony of the world, and she is the mother of all peace
and joy. To live at all, man must make rules and keep them, and in
the prevalent flux he hankers after rigidity. The more doubtful the
political outlook the fiercer will be the dogmas which men create
and contend for; the more the foundations of the Church are shaken
the more high-flying and arbitrary will be the conflicting creeds.
It is an old trait of human nature, when in the mist, to be very
sure about its road. In such an era a religious faith tends to
become a complete philosophy of life, governing also the minutest
details of the sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id=
"Page_20">[20]</a></span>ular world. Man cries for guidance and
authority, and if he rejects one sanction he will invent others
more compelling than the old. Having shaken himself loose from
history, he tends to an abstract idealism. The English polity had
been built up piecemeal by many compromises, but its
seventeenth-century critics were apt to forget this, and to devise,
like Milton, a brand-new symmetrical structure, unrelated to the
past.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But Milton had the
supreme merit that he always believed in the free and rational soul
of man. "He who wisely would restrain the reasonable soul of man
within due bounds, must first himself know perfectly how far the
territory and dominion extends of just and honest liberty. As
little must he offer to bind that which God hath loosened as to
loosen that which He hath bound. The ignorance and mistake of this
high point hath heaped up one huge half of all the misery that hath
been since Adam." The human reason was not commonly valued so high
by Milton's contemporaries, and they readily bent themselves before
authority&mdash;of king or parliament, of bishop, Bible or
congregation, or of personal revelation. Differences, which should
have been discretionary, were elevated into matters of essential
principle, and men were ready to stake body and soul on the finest
points of dogma in Church and State.</p>
<p>Happily these troubles of the spirit, so far as England was
concerned, befell in a society nicely integrated and fundamentally
stable. Men of quick conscience and fine intelligence, who are the
shaping spirits in any era, felt their impact, but there were in
the land strong stabilizing forces which were for long untouched by
them, and which made it certain that change would come by slow
degrees. There was not, as on the continent of Europe, a gulf fixed
between the nobility and the commonalty; the nobles were no more
than the topmost class of a great body of gentry which in the lower
ranges came very near to the yeomanry, and embraced what we know
to-day as the middle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id=
"Page_21">[21]</a></span> professional classes. Even at the summit,
the grandees of Plantagenet and Tudor origin found themselves
compelled to mix with the new creations of James I. A family of
Norman descent would apprentice a younger son to a trade, and marry
a daughter to some new City knight or young lawyer from the Temple.
Boys of ancient houses sat side by side on the grammar-school
benches with the sons of farmers and tradesmen. The land was
organized locally for defence and administration; an unpaid
magistracy enforced the king's mandates and administered the new
poor law; the ordinary citizen was the only soldier, the medi&aelig;val
levy had not yet disappeared, and on the Marches manorial tenants
armed with broadswords still met the judges of assize. There was
little rigidity among classes, but the intensity of provincial
feeling gave immense power to those local leaders who had a long
tradition of popularity, so that the Lancashire gentry were
accustomed to wear the Stanley livery. Shire, parish, and town were
living organisms, managing their affairs with little outside
interference, and to buttress their honest particularism there was
a mass of hoar-ancient custom and tradition which gave a man of
Gloucestershire a different outlook from a man of Devon or Kent.
England still stood in the old ways, and in her affection for them
lay a vast latent conservative power. But with this conservatism
was joined a high measure of independence. The progress of
enclosures was bringing the yeoman and the tenant-farmer into
greater importance, and if each locality had its special
patriotism, so had each class its own stubborn loyalties. So far as
we can judge, it was on the whole a comfortable society, full of
ancestral jollities, and secure, for in most parts of England a
century had elapsed since the tramp of armies had echoed in their
fields.</p>
<p>North of the Tweed the case was different. Scotland had for
centuries been emptied from vessel to vessel, and civil war was in
the memories of living men. In the Highlands the clan system still
held together a primitive society, but its Border variant
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id=
"Page_22">[22]</a></span> broken down, and elsewhere no settled
order of life had been developed. The Scottish nobles had not laid
aside their ancient turbulence; whereas in England the duel was
coming into fashion (a step towards civilization), they still held
by bravos and the "killing affray."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
"FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a> All classes were miserably poor; the gentry
lived squalidly in their little stone towers, the peasant was
half-starved and half-clad, and rural life had few of the English
amenities. The land was strewn with the relics of medi&aelig;valism, and
amid this lumber the spirit of the Knoxian Reformation burned
furiously, destroying much that was ill and not a little that was
good. In a later chapter we shall consider more closely the
condition of Scotland; here it is sufficient to note that the land
was far readier for violent change than its southern neighbour. Its
conservatism was a thing of private sentiment and passion rather
than of fidelity to proved institutions; its history had given it a
noble patriotism, but few things to cherish beyond a savage
independence, and the cataclysmic breach with the ancient Church
had predisposed it to other breaches. At the same time the Union of
the Crowns had brought it into close relations with England, its
nobility frequented the court, its civil and ecclesiastical
policies were affected by Westminster. No overt act, no spiritual
mood of England could be without its reactions in the north, and a
flame which burned slowly amid the lush meadows and green hedgerows
might run like wildfire among the dry heather.</p>
<p>An era of unrest produces a thousand types, but in the long run
they range themselves in two parties, for human
nature&mdash;especially English human nature&mdash;tends always to
a dualism. It is not easy to find a definition for either Cavalier
or Puritan which shall embrace on the one hand Suckling and
Traherne, Laud and Clarendon, Rupert and Falkland: on the other
Hampden and Barebone, Bunyan and Milton, Ireton and Lilburne. From
the one party we may exclude the mere roysterers&mdash;Milton's
"sons of Belial, flown with insolence and wine"&mdash;and from the
other th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id=
"Page_23">[23]</a></span>e hypocrites and the crack-brains; every
great cause has its unworthy camp-followers. The division was not a
social one, for the Puritans had many of the old nobility and some
of the best of the country gentry in their ranks; and the Cavaliers
had the bulk of the peasantry and a share of the trading and
professional classes. The two factors in the situation were the
crumbling of old things and the need of substitutes, the
questioning and the demand for certainty; the problem was how to
define the fundamentals, and where to find authority. Men of the
same party answered it in different and often inconsistent
ways.</p>
<p>The stream of the Cavalier temperament was fed by many distant
springs. There was the punctilio of honour, the devotion to a
master, which made royalists of simple and chivalrous souls: men
like Hopton and Capel, Sunderland and Sir Bevil Grenville; men like
Sir Edmund Verney, the knight marshal, from whose dying hand the
standard dropped at Edgehill, though his creed was not that of the
king. There were the lovers of Old England like Clarendon, its old
Church, its folk religion, "its old good manners, its old good
humour, and its old good nature"&mdash;things like to be destroyed
by rash hands which could only offer a drab alternative. There were
the believers in a central authority, and in the domain of law as
against anarchy&mdash;liberal thinkers for the most part, and
zealous reformers, who stood as firmly as Milton for the freedom of
the human spirit, but resisted an iconoclasm which they held to be
the path to servitude. Such were Falkland&mdash;who has given true
conservatism its motto: "When it is not necessary to change, it is
necessary not to change"&mdash;and Sidney Godolphin, who, like his
friend, fell early on the battlefield.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id=
"FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> There were the opportunists as against the
dogmatists, the men who held with Donne that truth is not found by
the straight road of an easy revelation, but must be sought by a
spiral course, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24">[24]</a></span> that, as Cosin put it, "faith is not on
this side knowledge, but beyond it." There were the scholars, full
of the classical Renaissance; and the Platonists, who were not
content to make the Bible the one source of truth or to condemn as
carnal what they held to be divine. And there were the poets, who
refused to narrow the world which God had made, and, like Herbert
and Vaughan and Traherne, found everywhere "bright shoots of
everlastingness"; in such men mysticism does not reject humanism,
but enfolds and transcends it.</p>
<p>In this medley of types there was infinite room for
difference&mdash;Laud's theory of church government, for example,
was antipathetic to most of the party&mdash;but under the pressure
of their opponents they found common ground, and a temperament was
hardened into a creed. That creed was, shortly, the need of
preserving a central authority in the kingship. Men who had hotly
criticized Charles's policy, who had no love for Laud and his ways,
who had sympathized with Hampden and Eliot, found themselves ranged
beside country squires who had few ideas beyond ale and foxes. Just
as Oxford's treasures of Renaissance plate were melted down to
provide current coin for the troops, so far-reaching doctrines were
given a partial and popular statement, and philosophies were
reduced to formulas and watchwords. In the Middle Ages treason was
held the rankest of crimes, because so little was needed to wreck
the brittle mechanism of the State. So now, with change and anarchy
in the air, lovers of order stood by the one well-sanctioned
existing authority&mdash;the king.</p>
<p>In the Puritan party we find less variety of type and a simpler
temperament, but here also is diversity. The basis was in the first
instance religion.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
"FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a> The original Puritan was one who desired to
purify the Church from all taint of Romanism, and to the end there
were Puritans who remained Churchmen. But<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> presently,
as the difficulties of the task became apparent, criticism of
liturgical forms and of the extravagances of episcopal power
hardened with many into an opposition to all hierarchical church
government, and the acceptance of the Presbyterian doctrine of the
"priesthood of all believers" and the polity of the reformed
churches in France, Switzerland, and Scotland. This ecclesiastical
preference was extended into secular affairs, and the Puritan added
to his creed a passion for civic freedom. There were also the
sectaries who had been persecuted since the early days of
Elizabeth, and who were distasteful alike to Anglican and
Presbyterian&mdash;men who were extreme individualists in church
matters, and regarded the congregation as the divinely appointed
organism.</p>
<p>Puritanism was neither an ecclesiastical system nor a
theological creed. Calvinism, with its doctrine of "exclusive
salvation," was, at first, the belief of Anglican and Presbyterian
alike, and it remained the prevailing creed of the Puritan party as
of the bulk of their opponents&mdash;rejected only by Laud's
Arminian school, and by sects like the Baptists and the Quakers.
The most powerful statement of Puritan theology will be found in
Anglican divines like Donne; no Scottish Covenanter ever dwelt more
terribly upon original sin, the torments of hell, and the awe of
eternity.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Nor was the Puritan
either a very learned and subtle theologian, or a profound
expositor of his own ecclesiastical tastes. When a man of Milton's
genius embarks upon doctrinal questions<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id=
"FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> he is "in wandering mazes lost," like the evil
spirits in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, who sat on a hill and debated
predestination. For wisdom, breadth of knowledge, and logical
acumen, no Puritan champion can vie with Hooker, Chillingworth,
John Hales, and Jeremy Taylor&mdash;few even reach the standard of
Laud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id=
"Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Puritanism was above all things the result of a profound
spiritual experience in the Puritan. It is to John Bunyan and
George Fox that we must go if we would learn the strength of the
faith. The questioning of the epoch resulted for such men in an
overwhelming sense of sin and an overpowering consciousness of God;
their knowledge, in Cromwell's famous words, was not "literal and
speculative, but inward and transforming the mind to it." Unless we
realize this primary fact we cannot explain why so many diverse
creeds were ultimately conjoined to form one conquering
temperament. Inevitably the faith and the practice narrowed and
hardened. Sunday, the day on which Calvin played bowls and John
Knox gave supper parties, became the Jewish Sabbath, and the Mosaic
law in many of its most irrelevant details was incorporated with
the Christian creed. Toleration was impossible for men who saw life
as a narrow path through a land shaken by the fires of hell; only
kindred communions were tolerated, save by those few sects who,
from hard experience, had learned a gentler rule. A limited number
inclined to a complete separation of Church and State, but the
majority desired a purified State, which would be the ally and the
servant of the Church. They rejected the world of sense, for there
could be no innocency in what had been corrupted by Adam's sin, and
their eyes were fixed austerely upon their own souls. The strength
of Puritanism lay in its view of the direct relation of God and
man; its weakness in the fact that this relation was narrowly and
often shallowly construed. The Puritan became, by his severe
abstraction, a dangerous element in society and the State, since
human institutions are built upon half-truths, opportunisms, and
compromises. He was pre-eminently a destructive force, for he was
without the historical sense,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
"FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a> and sought less to erect and unite than to pull
down and separate. Milton's words might be taken as his creed: "By
His divorcing command the world first rose out of chaos; nor can be
renewed again out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id=
"Page_27">[27]</a></span> confusion but by the separating of unmeet
consorts."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
<p>With the Puritans, as with the Cavaliers, many streams from
remote wells were in the end canalized into a single channel. The
mood of those who accepted the natural world as the gift of God was
set against that which saw that world as conceived in sin and
shapen in iniquity: the ancient institutions of the realm, which to
the mind of the Cavalier should be reformed, but in substance
retained, were opposed to a clean page on which men could write
what they pleased; the conception of the State as a thing of
balances and adjustments was met by a theory of government as an
abstract ideal to be determined mainly by the half-understood words
of an old book: the free exercise of men's conscience in religion
was confronted with a denial of freedom except to those of a
certain way of thinking. The truth is that the Puritan was hampered
both in civil and ecclesiastical statesmanship by that intense
individualism which was also his strength. His creed was not social
or readily communicable&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">". . . a dark lanthorn of the spirit,<br>
Which none see by but those who bear it."</p>
<br>
<p>To him, as to Newman in his youth, the world was narrowed to
"two, and two only, supreme and luminously self-evident
beings"&mdash;himself and his Creator.</p>
<p>If we put the contrast thus, it would seem that generosity and
enlightenment were predominantly on the side of the Cavaliers. But
it must not be forgotten that, owing to the spiritual atmosphere of
the age and the tendency in such a conflict to narrower and yet
narrower definition, the common creed of Puritanism did not fairly
represent the best men in its ranks. Had Hampden and Falkland ever
argued on fundamentals they might well have found themselves in
substantial agreement. The difference, as the struggle progressed,
came to lie far less in creeds than in the moods behind them, and
the Puritan mood, solemn under<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> the Almighty's eye, austere,
self-centred, unhumorous, unbending, was more formidable and more
valuable than their crude apologetics. Its spiritual profundity was
as rich a bequest to the future as the saner and sunnier temper of
the Cavalier. The difference between the best men of the two
parties was a fine one&mdash;the exact border-line between the
king's prerogative and popular liberties in Church and State; but
most great contests in the world's history have been fought on
narrow margins. And in practice the narrowness disappeared, and the
divergence was glaring. For the Cavalier, with his reasoned
doctrine of a central authority based on historical sanctions, had
to define that authority as the king, and that king not an ideal
monarch, but an actual person then living in Whitehall. The
Puritan, who might have dissented reluctantly from the abstract
argument, was very ready to differ about Charles.</p>
<p>The conflict which we call the Civil War took place under the
shadow which overhung the thought of the first half of the
seventeenth century. In that gloom, as we have seen, men were
predisposed to define arbitrarily and fly to rigid dogma as to a
refuge, for in such a constriction they found peace and strength.
Those who maintained the integrity of the spirit, and refused to
blindfold their minds, cloistered themselves, or, if they ventured
on a life of action, were as a rule Verneys or Falklands,
heartsick, distracted, "ingeminating Peace." The effective
protagonists were those Cavaliers whose loyalty knew no doubts, and
those Puritans who were strong in the confidence of their Lord.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<p>It is the purpose of this book to trace the career of one whose
campaigning ground was Scotland, where antagonisms were fiercer and
blinder than in the south; one who did not drug his soul with easy
loyalties, but faced the problem of his times unflinchingly, and
reached conclusions which had to wait for nearly two hundred years
till they could be restated with some hope of acceptance; one who,
nevertheless, had that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29">[29]</a></span> single-hearted gift for deeds which
usually belongs to the man whose vigour is not impaired by thought.
Montrose has been called by Carlyle the noblest of the Cavaliers,
yet clearly he was no ordinary Cavalier; for at the start he was a
Covenanter and in rebellion against the king&mdash;rebellion of
which he never saw reason to repent, and to his dying day he
remained a convinced Presbyterian.</p>

<br>
<p>The Highland Line in the Scottish mainland, though variously
determined at times by political needs, has been clearly fixed by
nature. The main battlement of the hills runs with a north-easterly
slant from Argyll through the Lennox, and then turns northward so
as to enclose the wide carselands of Tay. Beyond lie the tangled
wildernesses stretching with scarcely a break to Cape Wrath; east
and south are the Lowlands proper&mdash;on the east around Don and
Dee and the Forfarshire Esks: on the south around Forth and Clyde,
and embracing the hills of Tweed and Galloway. Scotland had thus
two Borderlands&mdash;the famous line of march with England, and
the line, historically less notable but geographically clearer,
which separated plain from hill, family from clan, and for
centuries some semblance of civilization from its stark opposite.
The northern Border may be defined in its more essential part as
the southern portion of Dumbarton and Lennox, the shire of
Stirling, and the haughs of the lower Tay. There for centuries the
Lowlander looked out from his towns and castles to the blue
mountains where lived his ancestral foes. Dwelling on a frontier
makes a hardy race, and from this northern Border came famous men
and sounding deeds. Drummonds, Murrays, Erskines, and
Grahams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">[34]</a></span> were its chief families, but most notably
the last. What the name of Scott was in the glens of Teviot, the
name of Graham was in the valleys of Forth and Earn. Since the
thirteenth century they had been the unofficial wardens of the
northern marches.</p>
<p>The ancient nobility of Scotland does not show well on the page
of history. The records of the great earldoms&mdash;Angus, Mar,
Moray, Buchan&mdash;tell too often an unedifying tale of blood and
treason, and, after the day of the Good Lord James, St. Bride of
Douglas might have wept for her children. But the family of Graham
kept tolerably clean hands, and played an honourable part in the
national history. Sir John the Graham was the trusted friend of
Wallace, and fell gloriously at Falkirk. His successors fought in
the later wars of independence, thrice intermarried with the royal
blood, and gave Scotland her first primate. In 1451 the family
attained the peerage. The third Lord Graham was made Earl of
Montrose, when the short-lived Lindsay dukedom lapsed, and the new
earl died with his king in the steel circle at Flodden. A successor
fell at Pinkie; another became Chancellor and then Viceroy of
Scotland when James the Sixth mounted the English throne. The
Viceroy's son, the fourth earl, apart from a famous brawl in the
High Street of Edinburgh, lived the quiet life of a county laird
till, shortly before his death he, too, was appointed Chancellor.
He was a noted sportsman, a great golfer, and a devotee of tobacco.
His wife was Lady Margaret Ruthven, a daughter of the
tragically-fated house of Gowrie, who bore him six children, and
died when her only son was in his sixth year. The family was
reasonably rich as the times went, for the home-keeping Earl John
had conserved his estate. They owned broad lands in Stirling,
Perth, and Angus, and wielded the influence which the chief of a
house possesses over its numerous cadets. They had three principal
dwellings&mdash;the tower of Mugdock in Strathblane; the fine
castle of Kincardine in Perthshire, where the Ochils slope to the
Earn; and the house of Old Montrose, which Robert<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> Bruce had
given to a Graham as the price of Cardross on Clyde.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1612-24</i></div>
<p>James Graham, the only son of the fourth earl and Margaret
Ruthven, was born in the year 1612, probably in the month of
October<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;according to
tradition, in the town of Montrose. The piety of opponents has
surrounded his birth with omens; his mother is said, with the
hereditary Ruthven love of necromancy, to have consulted witches,
and his father to have observed to a neighbour that this child
would trouble all Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id=
"FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class=
"fnanchor">[22]</a> Like Cromwell, he was the only boy in a family
of girls. Of his five sisters, the two eldest were married
young&mdash;Lilias to Sir John Colquhoun of Luss, and Margaret to a
wise man of forty, the first Lord Napier of Merchiston. Their
houses were open to him when he tired of catching trout in the
little water of Ruthven, or wearing out horseshoes on the Ochils,
an occupation to which the extant bills of the Aberuthven
blacksmith testify. There was much in the way of adventure to be
had at Rossdhu, Lady Lilias's new dwelling, and there the boy may
have learned, from practising on the roebuck and wild goats of
Lochlomondside, the skill which made him in after years a noted
marksman.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1624-26</i></div>
<p>At the age of twelve Lord Graham was entrusted to a certain
William Forrett, master of arts, to be prepared for the college of
Glasgow. Thither he journeyed with a valet, two pages in scarlet, a
quantity of linen and plate, a selection from his father's library,
and his favourite white pony. He lived in the house of Sir George
Elphinstone of Blythswood, the Lord Justice Clerk; it stood near
the Townhead, and may have been one of the old manses of the canons
of the Cathedral. The avenues to learning must have been gently
graded, for he retained a happy memory o<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>f those
Glasgow days and of Master Forrett, who in later years became the
tutor of his sons. He seems to have read in Xenophon and Seneca,
and an English translation of Tasso; but his favourite book, then
and long afterwards, was Raleigh's <i>History of the World</i>, the
splendid folio of the first edition.</p>
<p>In the second year of Glasgow study the old earl died, and Lord
Graham posted back to Kincardine, arriving two days before the end.
Thither came the whole race of Grahams for the funeral ceremonies,
which lasted the better part of three weeks. Prodigious quantities
of meat and drink were consumed, for each neighbour and kinsman
brought his contribution in kind&mdash;partridges and plovers from
Lord Stormont, moorfowl from Lawers, a great hind from
Glenorchy&mdash;the details are still extant, with the values of
woodcock and wild geese, capercailzie and ptarmigan, meticulously
set down. If such mourning had its drawbacks, at any rate it
introduced the new head of the family to those of his name and
race. He did not return to Glasgow (though five years later he
showed his affection for the place by making a donation to the
building of the new college library), and presently was entered at
St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews, of which one of his forbears
had been a founder. Master Forrett brought his possessions from
Glasgow, and the laird of Inchbrakie bestowed these valuable items,
the books, in a proper cabinet.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1626-28</i></div>
<p>We have ample documents to illustrate his St. Andrews'
days.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The university, the
oldest and then the most famous in Scotland, had among its alumni
in the first half of the seventeenth century men so diverse as
Montrose and Argyll and Rothes, Mr. Donald Cargill and Sir George
Mackenzie. His secretary was a Mr. John Lambie, and Mr. Lambie's
accounts reveal the academic life in those days of a
gentleman-commoner. In sport his tastes were catholic. He golfed,
like James Melville a century before, and paid five shillings Scots
for each golf ball. His rooms at St. Salvator's were<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> hung round
with bows, and in his second year he won the silver medal for
archery, which to the end of his college course he held against all
comers. Argyll, who was some years his senior, had carried off the
same trophy. He was an admirable horseman, and he seems to have
hunted regularly; it is recorded in the accounts that after a day
with hounds his horse was given a pint of ale. He was fond of
hawking, and he went regularly to Cupar races, handing over,
according to the excellent statute of 1621, his winnings beyond one
hundred marks to the local kirk session for the relief of the poor.
His chief friends of his own order seem to have been Wigton,
Lindsay of the Byres, Kinghorn, Sinclair, Sutherland, and Colville,
and he varied his residence at St. Andrews with visits to his
brother-in-law (the hills of Rossdhu, complains his steward, wore
the boots off his feet), the cadet gentry of his name, and
Cumbernauld, Glamis, Kinnaird, Balcarres, and the other
country-houses of his friends. In October 1628 he gave a great
house-warming at Kincardine, which lasted for three days. In the
March following he visited Edinburgh, where he appeared in gilt
spurs and a new sword, and was lent the Chancellor's carriage. The
picture which has come down to us of the undergraduate is that of a
boy happy and well-dowered, popular with all, eager to squeeze the
juice from the many fruits of life. Nor was he above youthful
disasters. When his sister Dorothea married Sir James Rollo, there
was huge feasting in Edinburgh and Fife, and the young earl
returned to college only to fall sick. Two doctors were summoned,
who charged enormous fees, and prescribed a rest cure&mdash;strict
diet, and no amusements but cards and chess. The barber shore away
his long brown curls, and "James Pett's dochter" attended to the
invalid's food. The r&eacute;gime seems high feeding for what was probably
an attack of indigestion&mdash;trout, pigeons, capons, "drapped
eggs," calf's-foot jelly, grouse (out of season), washed down by
"liquorice, whey, possets, aleberry, and claret."<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>From the accounts preserved we can trace something of his
progress in learning. He began to study Greek, and continued his
reading in the Latin classics, his favourites now being C&aelig;sar and
Lucan, in his copies of which he made notes. He can never have been
an exact scholar, and it is probable that the wide knowledge of
classical literature which he showed later was largely acquired
from translations. For it was the day of great translators, and at
St. Andrews he had at his service North's <i>Plutarch</i>, Philemon
Holland's <i>Livy</i> and <i>Suetonius</i>, Thomas Heywood's
<i>Sallust</i>, and the <i>Tacitus</i> of Sir Henry Savile and
Richard Grenewey. Nor did he neglect romances, and he made his
first essays in poetry. To this stage may belong the lines ascribed
to him by family tradition, in which the ambitious boy writes his
own version of a popular contemporary conceit; but he does not end,
like the other versions, on a note of pious quietism:</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"I would be high; but that the cedar tree<br>
&nbsp;Is blustered down whilst smaller shrubs go free.<br>
&nbsp;I would be low; but that the lowly grass<br>
&nbsp;Is trampled down by each unworthy ass.<br>
&nbsp;For to be high, my means they will not doe;<br>
&nbsp;And to be low my mind it will not bow.<br>
&nbsp;O Heavens! O Fate! when will you once agree<br>

"FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<br>
<p>He had a touch of the bibliophile, for he had his copies of
Buchanan and Barclay's <i>Argenis</i> specially bound. To poor
authors he was a modest M&aelig;cenas. The accounts show a payment of
fifty-eight shillings Scots to "ane Hungarian poet, who made some
verses to my lord." He subscribed for the travels of the
fantastical William Lithgow, and was good-humoured enough to read
and advise upon a poem in manuscript by the same hand which bore
the unsavoury title of "The Gushing Tears of Godly Sorrow."<a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1629</i></div>
<p>In those days the business of life crowded fast upon boyhood.
After the university came marriage as the next step in a
gentleman's education. Not far from Old Montrose stood the castle
of Kinnaird, where Lord Carnegie<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id=
"FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a> dwelt with six pretty daughters. There Montrose
had often visited, and there he fell in love with Magdalen, the
youngest girl. The match was too desirable for opposition either
from the Carnegies or from the young lord's guardians, and the
children&mdash;Montrose was only seventeen&mdash;were married in
the parish church of Kinnaird on November 10, 1629. In the marriage
contract Lord Carnegie bound himself "to entertain and sustain in
house with himself, the said noble earl and Mistress Magdalene
Carnegie, his promised spouse, during the space of three years next
after the said marriage."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id=
"FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a> Accordingly the young couple remained at
Kinnaird for a little over three years, until Montrose came of age,
and there two of their four sons were born.<a name="FNanchor_28_28"
id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> They were years of quiet study, the leisurely
preparation which is all too rare in youth for the necessities of
manhood; and they were the only season of peaceful domestic life
which Montrose was fated to enjoy. The famous Jameson portrait,
given by Graham of Morphie as a wedding gift to the young countess,
shows him in those years of meditation, when he was scribbling his
ambitions in his copy of Quintus Curtius. It is a charming head of
a boy, with its wide, curious, grey eyes, the arched, almost
fantastic, eyebrows, the delicate mobile lips. Life was to crush
out the daintiness and gaiety, armour was to take the place of lace
collar and silken doublet; but one thing the face of Montrose never
lost&mdash;it had always an air of hope, as of one seeking for a
far country.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1633-36</i><span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></div>
<p>In June 1633 Charles came to Scotland to be crowned. Such an
occasion was well suited for the introduction of a young nobleman
to the court, for in that year Montrose attained his majority, his
father-in-law was high in the royal favour, and his brother-in-law
Napier was one of the four peers chosen to hold the canopy over the
king's head. That the world expected his presence is shown by his
friend William Lithgow's recommendation of his merits in the
preposterous poem, "Scotland's Welcome to her Native Son and
Sovereign Lord, King Charles." But when midsummer came he was on a
foreign shore. The reason may be traced in the scandal connected
with his sister's husband, Sir John Colquhoun, which in the
beginning of that year was the talk of Scotland. The laird of Luss,
in company with a German necromancer of the name of Carlippis, had
fled from his lawful wife, carrying with him his sister-in-law, the
little Lady Katherine, who had for a time been Montrose's companion
in his Glasgow lodgings. The malefactor was outlawed and
excommunicated, returning fourteen years later to be received into
grace by Church and State; the unhappy girl disappears from
history. With such a family horror on his mind, Montrose sought the
anodyne of new scenes and fresh faces.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>We know little of his travels. He started probably in the
beginning of 1633, accompanied by his secretary of St. Andrews
days, John Lambie, and young Graham of Morphie. According to
Burnet, his travelling companion was Basil Fielding, Denbigh's son
and Hamilton's brother-in-law, who flung in his fortunes later with
the Puritan party. He financed his journey by drawing bills on
William Dick of Braid through the latter's "factors" in Paris. The
winter of 1633-34 was spent at Angers, where he no doubt was a
pupil of the famous school of arms. In the old library at
Innerpeffray there is still preserved a French Bible which he
bought on his travels, scribbled throughout with mottoes which had
caught his fancy, such as "Honor mihi vita potior" and "Non
crescunt sine spinis." In Rome he met Lord Angus, the future
Marquis of Douglas, and others of the Scots nobility, and dined
with them at the English College there. He studied all the
while&mdash;"as mu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id=
"Page_41">[41]</a></span>ch of the mathematics as is required of a
soldier," wrote his faithful adherent Thomas Saintserf, "but his
great study was to read men and the actions of great men." It is a
phrase which aptly describes the attitude of high dedication in
which the young man passed his youth. He went gravely about the
business of life, and already had made certain of renown, though
careless enough of happiness. Long afterwards, to foreign observers
like the Cardinal de Retz, he seemed like one of the heroes of
Plutarch, and there was something even in his boyish outlook of the
high Roman manner. It was at this time that his interests began to
move strongly towards the military art. Europe was in the throes of
the Thirty Years' War, half its gentry were in arms, the great
Gustavus was but two years dead, and in court and college the talk
was all of leaguers and campaigns.</p>
<p>The descriptions of his person and habits at this date are
familiar; of middle stature and gracefully built, chestnut hair, a
clear fresh colour, a high-bridged nose, keen grey eyes; an
accomplished horseman, and an adept at every sport which needed a
lithe body and a cool head.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id=
"FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class=
"fnanchor">[29]</a> On his manner all accounts are agreed, and most
accounts are critical. He was very stately and ceremonious, even as
a young man, in no way prepared to forget that he was a great
noble, except among his intimates. To servants and inferiors he was
kindly and thoughtful, to equals and superiors a little stiff and
hard. Burnet says of him that he was "a young man well learned, who
had travelled, but had taken upon him the port of a hero too
much."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> "He was exceedingly
constant and loving," a friend wrote, "to those who did adhere to
him, and very affable to such as he knew; though his carriage,
which indeed was not ordinary, made him seem proud." One is
reminded of Sir Walter Ralei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42"
id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>gh, whose "n&aelig;ve," says Aubrey, "was
that he was damnable proud." Adventurous and imaginative youth is
rarely free from the fault; its sensitive haughtiness is both
defensive armour and a defiance; it believes itself destined for
great deeds, and a boyish stateliness is its advertisement to the
world of the part it has set itself to play.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1636</i></div>
<p>Montrose returned home in 1636, in his twenty-fourth
year&mdash;a figure of intense interest to the Scottish
faction-leaders, and of some moment to the king's court. He was
altogether too remarkable to please the Marquis of Hamilton, who
was the interpreter of Scottish business to the royal ear, and for
the first time he came into conflict with one with whom he was to
fight many battles. James, third Marquis, and soon to be first
Duke, of Hamilton, was not the least futile of the many schemers of
his day. A vain, secret being, a diligent tramper of backstairs,
and a master of incompetent intrigue, he is throughout his career
the sheep in wolf's clothing. He looks at us from the canvas of
Vandyck, a martial figure, grasping a baton, but in his face we can
detect what Sir Philip Warwick noted&mdash;"such a cloud on his
countenance that Nature seems to have impressed <i>aliquid
insigne</i>"&mdash;something crack-brained, uncertain and tortuous,
a warning that this was no man to ride the ford with. The royal
blood in his veins gave him high ambitions, and his fierce old
mother, Ann Cunningham of Glencairn, strongly coloured these
ambitions, so that he was for ever halting between King and
Covenant, dreaming now of winning Scotland for his master, and now
of reigning himself in some theocratic millennium. His life was one
long pose, but the poses were many and contradictory, and the world
came to regard as a knave one who was principally a fool. Burnet,
the Hamilton champion, has done his best for his memory, but the
verdict of history has been written by Clarendon, who was no
ill-wisher to his house. "His natural darkness and reservation in
his discourse made him to be thought a wise man, and his having
been in command under the King of Sweden,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> as his
continual discourse of battles and fortifications, made him to be
thought a soldier. And both these mistakes were the cause that made
him to be looked upon as a worse and a more dangerous man than in
truth he deserved to be."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id=
"FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p>When Montrose reached London he appeared at court, and naturally
asked Hamilton to be his sponsor, announcing his wish "to put
himself into the king's service." Hamilton did his best to dissuade
him by representing Charles as the foe of Scottish rights, and then
promptly sought out the king to tell him that Montrose, by reason
of his royal descent, was a danger to the royal interests, and
should be discouraged. The upshot was that the traveller was
received by Charles with marked coldness. The king spoke a few
chilly words, gave him his hand to kiss, and turned away. It was
enough to discourage the most ardent loyalist, and the rebuff made
it certain that personal affection for his monarch would play no
part in determining the young man's conduct on his return to his
own country.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<p>The Reformation in Scotland has been often misconceived as a
sudden and universal turning from an old way of life, and as sudden
a birth of Presbytery fully matured in creed, discipline, and
constitution. In reality it was a slow and halting process, where
at the start only one thing was determined&mdash;the breach with
Rome; and the positive structure suffered long delays and
hesitations. The masculine genius of Knox was better fitted for
action than for constructive thought; he knew when to defy and when
to yield, for, in F. W. Maitland's phrase, a shrewd worldly wisdom
underlay his Hebraic frenzies; but he was nobly inconsistent, his
views passed through baffling permutations, and, in spite of the
acumen of his mind, the fabric he reared was neither well planned
nor soundly masoned. But on the negative side his work was final.
The old building had been razed to the ground, so that in Scotland
there was at no time the remotest chance of a cou<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>nter-
Reformation. The faults of the pre-Reformation Scottish Church have
doubtless been too darkly painted. In many ways its rule was
beneficent, and it was rarely oppressive, but it had little hold
upon the mind of a people which, in the Middle Ages, was notably
careless about Rome. When Scotland found religion, she found it in
a form which made her historic Church seem the flat opposite of the
commands of Omnipotence. Moreover, the Renaissance came to her
mainly through the Reformation, and, besides the religious impulse,
there were stirrings towards democracy and freedom of thought which
were satisfied by her new creed. Also there was her ancient dislike
of foreign meddling. Rome became a hissing and a reproach, though
men might differ hotly about what should take its place. When Knox
thundered against the "diabolical," "rotten," and "stinking" ritual
which had once been a familiar and comforting part of the people's
life, when he declared that the mass was more odious in God's sight
than murder, he had the assent of the bulk of the nation. "They
think it impossible to lose the way to Heaven," wrote Sir Anthony
Weldon of the Scots, "if they can but leave Rome behind them." On
the destructive side the work was complete.</p>
<p>We may date the Scottish Reformation from the first "Band" of
December 1557, which denounced the abuses of Rome and demanded the
introduction of the English Prayer-book; but it was not till the
Edinburgh Parliament of 1560 that we see the dawnings of
Presbytery. Presbyterianism, as we understand the word to-day, is
distinguished by its theory of church government, its ritual, and
its creed. In each domain its special principles were slow to
establish themselves.</p>
<p>Take the matter of church government. The cardinal doctrine of
the priesthood of all believers was no doubt there in germ from the
beginning, but at first there was little besides. The Presbyterian
belief in the equality of ministers came neither from Calvin nor
from Knox; Knox's "superintendents," as diocesan chiefs, were
strangely like bishops, and the first refor<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>med
Scottish Church was a limited episcopacy. It was Andrew Melville
who introduced the doctrine of ministerial parity, and made bishops
an offence not only against the Scriptural conception of the
Church, but against the new notion of democracy. "Ye may have
bishops here," the minister of Dunfermline told King James, "but ye
must remember to make us all equal; make us all bishops, else will
ye never content us."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id=
"FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a> The first Book of Discipline of 1561 accepted a
hierarchy; the second Book of Discipline twenty years later swept
it away. But the battle was not won; its fortunes seesawed during
the reign of James, according as the monarch felt his power, for he
had reached the firm conclusion that a hierarchy was a necessary
protection for the throne against the potential anarchy of
Presbytery. In 1584 came the Black Acts, and a short-lived royal
triumph; in 1592 the king was forced to accept a full Presbyterian
polity; by 1600 he had won again, and bishops sat in Parliament.
His accession to the English throne gave him a new authority, the
Melvilles were exiled, and, by means of packed ecclesiastical
conventions, which he called General Assemblies, he had the Act of
1592 repealed and episcopacy established by law. But it was no more
than a parliamentary episcopacy, scarcely affecting the life of the
people, since kirk sessions, presbyteries, and synods continued to
meet, and a staunch Presbyterian could write in 1616: "At that time
I observed little controversy in religion in the Kirk of Scotland,
for though there were bishops, yet they took little upon
them."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In the early years of
the reign of Charles I. the familiar Presbyterian r&eacute;gime was the
rule in Scotland, with bishops affixed to it as a meaningless
adminicle.</p>
<p>In the same way the General Assembly&mdash;that palladium of the
new Church&mdash;was slow to come to maturity. When it was
introduced in 1560, it was a copy of the national synod of the
French Church. It was not a gathering of ecclesiastics, but
repres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id=
"Page_47">[47]</a></span>entative of the whole religious life of
the people, containing both clergy and laity popularly elected.
From the start it possessed a representative authority which was
lacking in the Scottish Parliament, and it presently became its
rival. In the confused early years of James it wielded great powers
and interfered much in secular policy&mdash;not without reason, for
at the time every political problem had a religious connotation.
But after the king's victory in 1597 its influence declined, and
before the end of his life it became an instrument in his hands.
Andrew Melville had stated its claims so high that the civil
authority could not choose but oppose them. "Thair is twa Kings and
twa Kingdoms in Scotland," he had told his master. "Thair is Chryst
Jesus the King and his Kingdom the Kirk, whase subject King James
the Saxt is, and of whase Kingdom nocht a King nor a Lord nor a
heid but a member. And they whom Chryst has callit and commandit to
watch over the Kirk and govern his spirituall Kingdom has
sufficient power of him and authoritie sa to do." This might seem a
reasonable statement of spiritual independence, were it not that
the particular Assembly to which James objected had been called to
discuss a question of secular politics.</p>
<p>We see, indeed, through the whole period between 1560 and 1638
the hardening and the magnifying of the claims of the new Church in
other than legitimate matters of spiritual doctrine and discipline.
It was this arrogance that made James and Charles desire a system
which would bring the ecclesiastical leaders directly into the body
politic, and so make them responsible to their sovereign; the
trouble was that the real leaders saw that their power lay in being
detached from King and Parliament, the chiefs of an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>. There is no warrant for this separation to be found in
Calvin. A preacher at N&icirc;mes took to overthrowing images and altars,
declaring that it was a matter of conscience. "God," said Calvin,
"never commands any one to overthrow idols, except every man in his
own house, and, in public, those whom He has armed with
authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id=

<i>he</i> is lord of the land where he has been burning
things."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This was also the view
of Knox, though he spoke at different times with different voices.
He bade his Berwick congregation give due obedience to magistrates,
however ungodly, without tumult or sedition, and "not to pretend to
defend God's truth and religion, ye being subjects, by violence or
sword, but patiently suffering what God shall please be laid on you
for constant confession of your faith and belief"; seven years
later he was advising the faithful in England that "a prince who
erects idolatry . . . must be adjudged to death." But his
considered view seems to have been that in a Christian state the
last word, even in religion, lay with the civil authority. "The
ordering and reformation of religion doth especially appertain to
the Civil Magistrate. . . . The King taketh upon him to command the
Priests."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The true father of the
doctrine of the divine right of Presbytery was Andrew Melville, and
under his influence the new presbyter became, in the extravagance
of his claims, but too like the old priest. When ministers, called
to account before the Privy Council for preaching civil sedition,
declared that they could only appear before a Church court, they
were laying down a principle, ancient indeed, but none the less
destructive of civil society. Elizabeth in England saw what was
coming, and in 1590 counselled her brother of Scotland: "Let me
warn you that there is risen, both in your realm and mine, a sect
of perilous consequence, such as would have no kings but a
presbytery, and take our place while they enjoy our privileges,
with a shade of God's Word, which none is judged to follow right
without by their censure they be so deemed."<a name=

class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The comparative impotence of the Scottish
Kirk in the early years of Charles I. should not blind us to the
fact that in the minds of some of its ablest divines there was
developing a perilous doctrine of spiritual despotism<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The question of ritual was also unsettled. The first reformers
in Scotland had no objection to the use of settled forms in public
worship: none of them would have understood the objection of later
Covenanting extremists even to the Lord's Prayer. In 1557 the
Second Book of Edward VI. had been recommended, and was generally
used in churches, till Knox secured its supersession by the Genevan
Book of Common Order. The abhorrence of prescript prayer came into
Scotland from the English Puritans. Knox disliked many things in
the English Prayer-book, for it was his business to magnify
differences between the old worship and the new, so as to stimulate
Protestant fervour. He objected to kneeling at communion, because
he believed&mdash;without historical warrant&mdash;that the first
disciples sat, but he told his Berwick congregation that they might
kneel if the magistrates commanded it, and made it clear that it
was not retained for "maintenance of any superstition," like "the
adoration of the Lord's Supper." Later his attitude stiffened, and
he considered that kneeling at the Lord's table, responses, singing
of the litany, services on saints' days, and the use of the cross
in baptism were "diabolical inventions." But these were personal
opinions; he disliked equally the imposition of hands at the
ordination of ministers, which has long been a settled Presbyterian
usage. The Scottish Kirk was content to have a liturgy, but it
wanted its own Genevan version, and had the authorities been wise
they might have found a method of reuniting the worship of both
sides of the Tweed by some such eirenicon as John Hales dreamed
of&mdash;a public form of service embracing only those things upon
which all Christians were agreed.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id=
"FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class=
"fnanchor">[37]</a> Scotland was willing to accept a ritual, but it
must not be too suggestive of the Roman, and it must be her own and
not an imposition from England. The five Articles of Perth,
ratified by Parliament in 1621, enjoined kneeling at communion, the
private administration of the sacrament to the dying, baptism in
private houses, the confirmation of the young, and<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> the
keeping of certain church festivals&mdash;all English practices and
foreign to the Genevan code: Scotland disliked them, but when they
became law there was no further trouble, and, since they were not
strictly enforced, they might soon have perished from desuetude.
James, indeed, seems to have regarded the Perth Articles as the
most he was prepared to demand, and to have guaranteed no increase
of English innovations.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id=
"FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a> Scotland had, therefore, a legal ritual, which
was imperfectly observed<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id=
"FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> because it was out of tune with the spirit of
the Kirk, but not overtly opposed, because it had been established
by means of her own law. The real strife would begin if the monarch
should arbitrarily impose further Anglican forms upon her, for that
would call to arms not only the Genevan purism of the Kirk, but the
sleepless nationalism of the people.</p>
<p>At the time which we are now considering only one of the Kirk's
foundations had been securely built&mdash;her dogmatic creed, which
was the Calvinism of Knox's Confession of Faith, accepted by the
reforming Parliament of 1560. That stood without cavil, though in
the interpretation of its articles there was considerable
difference of emphasis. For the rest, the Kirk was a nominal
episcopacy, but the bishops were impotent, and the discipline was
in substance Presbyterian: her General Assembly was in abeyance
owing to royal encroachments, but it was an integral and
established part of her, so that at the right moment it could be
revived; she had moved far from the moderate Erastianism of Knox,
and had come to regard herself as a self-governing commonwealth,
wholly independent in all things which by any stretch of language
could be called spiritual, and entitled to interfere even in
secular politics; her worship was in the main according to the
Genevan form, but not universally regular owing to James's
ill-obeyed decrees. She was a living organism, the only institution
which commanded the loyalty of the majority of the people, and she
was a national thing&mdash;for she was<span class=

Genevan, Gallican, nor Anglican, but Scottish.<a name=

class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Among the medi&aelig;val lumber of Parliament,

throbbing power-house among tombs. Whether the land were ill or
wisely guided, the chief part of the guiding must be hers.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<p>The ecclesiastical structure is much, but we must look closer at
that more vital thing, the spirit which inspired it.</p>
<p>The essence of the Reformation was simplification. The great
organism of the Catholic Church, with all its intricate accretions
of fifteen centuries, was exchanged for a simple
revelation&mdash;God speaking through His Word to the individual
conscience. The Bible was its palladium, but the question presently
arose as to how the Bible was to be construed, once the authority
of the Church had been rejected. If the individual soul was the
basis of the new creed, so apparently must be the individual
judgment. That way lay anarchy and anabaptism, and it was
necessary, before the Reformed Church could come into being, to
establish some canon of interpretation, otherwise Protestantism
would go to pieces. The liberal theologians of the seventeenth
century held that the Bible was subject to the ultimate tests of
conscience and reason. "The authority of man," said Hooker, "is the
key which openeth the door of entrance into the knowledge of the
Scriptures." To him the Bible was not a cyclop&aelig;dia of all knowledge
and all truth. "Admit this and mark, I beseech you, what follows.
God, in delivering Scripture to His church, should claim to have
abrogated amongst them the law<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> of nature, which is an
infallible knowledge imprinted in the minds of all the children of
men, whereby both general principles for directing of human action
are comprehended, and conclusions derived from them; upon which
conclusions groweth in particular the choice of good and evil in
the daily affairs of this life. Admit this, and what shall the
Scriptures be but a snare and a torment to weak consciences,
filling them with infinite perplexities, scrupulosities, doubts
insoluble, and extreme despairs."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id=
"FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a> This was the creed of Laud and Chillingworth,
of John Hales and Jeremy Taylor, and from it followed the view
that, if human reason were the ultimate guide to interpretation,
diversity of opinion was inevitable and indeed essential. But such
a foundation was too insecure on which to found a militant church.
Calvin took a bolder course. We know that the Bible is God's Word,
not because of the authority of an historic church, but because of
the revelation of the Holy Spirit. This revelation must be
systematized and made explicit by God's servants, so that the
wayfaring man may understand. From this it is a short step to the
foundation of a church which is the direct medium of the Holy
Spirit, and a repository of inspired interpretation. The second
edition of Calvin's <i>Institutes</i>&mdash;he was only thirty when
it was published&mdash;definitely claims to be the canon of
Scripture teaching; from it alone the reader may learn what
Scripture means. Already the Bible is in a secondary place, and we
are not far from Tertullian's doctrine that the <i>regula fidei</i>
is not Scripture but the creed of a church.</p>
<p>Calvin was perhaps the most potent intellectual force in the
world between St. Thomas Aquinas and Voltaire. Though he rejected
in his system whatever the Bible did not warrant, and not, like
Luther, only what the Bible expressly forbade, he was in many ways
nearer to Catholicism than the German reformer. Like most great
men, he was greater than the thing he created. He was a profounder
statesman than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id=
"Page_53">[53]</a></span> followers, and far less of a formalist.
He could be so inconsistent as to be accused of heresy: he saw the
dangers into which his church might drift, and declared that he had
no desire to introduce "the tyranny that one should be bound, under
pain of being held a heretic, to repeat words dictated by some one
else"; a man to whom Plato was of all philosophers
<i>religiosissimus et maxime sobrius</i>, had more affinities with
humanism than is commonly believed. But a law-giver must be
dogmatic, and the founder of a church must narrow his sympathies.
He faced the eternal antinomies of thought&mdash;the reign of law
and the freedom of human spirit&mdash;and provided not a solution
but a practical compromise. He begins with the conceptions of an
omnipotent God of infinite purity and wisdom, of man cradled in
iniquity, and of salvation only through God's grace. The sinner is
foreordained&mdash;since God orders all things&mdash;alike to sin
and to destruction. It is the omnipotence of God that he stresses,
rather than the fatherhood, for he faces the problem from another
angle than Luther: the triviality of the created and the majesty of
the creator; the eternal damnation of man unless lifted out of the
pit by God's election.</p>
<p>These doctrines and this angle of vision were not new. Origen
and Gregory of Nyssa might preach a milder code, but they were the
orthodox creed of the Fathers of the Church. Men like Tertullian
exulted in contemplating the tortures of the damned. Unbaptized
infants, a span long, would burn for ever in hell, in spite of the
fact that their creation and death were the direct acts of their
Maker. It was the universal medi&aelig;val belief, in spite of the
questioning of a Socinus; it was the common doctrine of all the
Reformers except Zuinglius. "This is the acme of faith," said
Luther, "to believe that He is merciful who saves so few and who
condemns so many; that He is just who, at His own pleasure, has
made us necessarily doomed to damnation. . . . If by any effort of
reason I could conceive how God could be merciful and just who
shows so much anger and iniquity, there would be no n<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>eed for
faith."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> On such a view man's
reason and man's moral sense must alike be discarded as temptations
of the devil.</p>
<p>This was the creed of Augustine, stated by him more passionately
and harshly than by any Reformer; from him Calvin largely derived
his dogmas, but he took the doctrine and discarded Augustine's
church. Its central principle, the inexorableness of law, the
impossibility of free will, has been held by many secular thinkers
from Spinoza to Mill, who would have rejected its theological
implications. It was the creed of William the Silent and Coligny
and Cromwell, of Donne and Milton and Bunyan&mdash;men in whom both
conscience and intellect were quick. Only by a noble inconsistency
and a tacit forgetfulness could it be a worthy rule of life, and
this was in fact what happened. Calvin was greater than Calvinism,
and the Calvinist was a humaner and a wiser man than his creed. But
with all its perversities it put salt and iron into human life. It
taught man his frailty and his greatness, and brought him into
direct communion with Omnipotence. It preached uncompromisingly the
necessity of a choice between two paths; in Bunyan's words the
mountain gate "has room for body and soul, but not for body and
soul and sin." It taught a deep consciousness of guilt, and a
profound sense of the greatness of God, so that they who feared Him
were little troubled by earthly fears. Historically its importance
lay in its absoluteness, for a religion which becomes a "perhaps"
will not stand in the day of battle. It claimed to be truth, the
whole truth, when everything else was a conjecture or a lie. "In
God's matters," said Samuel Rutherford, "there be not, as in
grammar, the positive and comparative degrees; . . . there are not
here true, and more true, and most true. Truth is an indivisible
line which hath no latitude and cannot admit of splitting."<a name=
"FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It brigaded men into serried battalions;
the free-lance disappeared; Mr. Haughty, in the <i>Holy War</i>,
who declared "th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id=
"Page_55">[55]</a></span>at he had carried himself bravely, not
considering who were his foes, or what was the cause in which he
was engaged," was duly hanged by the men of Mansoul. A creed which
was fighting for its life could not afford to be liberal. "On such
subjects, and with common men, latitude of mind means weakness of
mind. There is but a certain quantity of spiritual force in any
man. Spread it over a broad surface, the stream is shallow and
languid."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
<p>Calvin's fame rests rather on the church which he created than
on the creed which he gave it, for he was a greater legislator than
a theologian. It was not in belief alone that safety was to be
found, but in belief within a church; in his own words, "Beyond the
bosom of the Church no remission of sins is to be hoped for nor any
salvation"&mdash;a strange return to the ecclesiasticism which he
had rejected. He might have said, in the words of a recent Vatican
decree, "La Chiesa non &egrave; un credo; la Chiesa &egrave; un impero, una
disciplina." John Knox considered the Genevan Church "the most
perfect School of Christ that ever was on earth since the days of
the Apostles," and this was the view taken by his successors of the
quasi-Genevan edifice which he erected in Scotland. It was divine,
guided and inspired by God, and not to be judged by human
standards. It could not err, though that fallible thing the human
conscience might regard certain of its actions as immoral.<a name=
"FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"
class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It was a complex legal machine, for it
was not for nothing that Calvin, like Knox and Donne, was bred to
the law, and legal phraseology became the fashion among the
divines.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Wielding the most awful
powers and penalties, acting under the most august sanctions,
inspired by a narrow and absolute creed, cunningly articulated so
that the whole nation was embodied under its dominion, the Kirk in
Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id=
"Page_56">[56]</a></span> was well able to speak with its
adversaries in the gate.</p>
<p>In principle it was a noble democracy. The Kirk made no
distinction of class; the ministry was not a hierarchy, but issued
from the ranks and could be reduced to them again; an educated
laity therefore became the pre-condition of an educated ministry.
In Scotland, with its decrepit Parliament, which was no better than
a machine for registering the edicts of other people, the pulpit
was the sole organ by which public opinion could be expressed. Only
by means of it could the masses scrutinize the conduct of their
rulers. It gave expression to the very ancient and stubborn sense
of liberty in the Scottish people, and to their jealous
nationalism. The doctrine of divine right had never come to birth
north of the Tweed; the Scots were ready to fight for their king,
unless they happened to be fighting against him; the monarchy was a
useful institution, and their own, but it was hedged about with no
divinity. The Reformation had come about through the strife of
sovereign and nobles, and the new clergy, already in opposition to
the throne, when they came to quarrel with the nobles were
compelled to throw themselves upon the people. Scotland had learned
from Knox and George Buchanan<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id=
"FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class=
"fnanchor">[47]</a> that the king derived his power from a contract
with the nation, and if that contract were broken might be deposed
and slain. The passive obedience which Jeremy Taylor preached in
his <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i>, and which captured many of the best
minds in contemporary England, was a plant which did not flourish
on Scottish soil. The claim of Presbytery to authority became
yearly more arrogant. There was justice in the complaint of Charles
I.: "The nature of presbyterian government is to strike or force
the crown from the king's head, for their chief maxim is (and I
know it to be true) that all kings must submit to Christ's kingdom,
<i>of which they are the sole governors</i>."<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>But by its very nature the Kirk could not remain a democracy.
The theocratic conception is inconsistent with the democratic
doctrine of majority rule, for, as Selden pointed out, it is
blasphemous to identify the odd man with the Holy Ghost.<a name=
"FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Buckle has declared that the paradox of
seventeenth-century Scotland was that the same people were liberal
in politics and illiberal in religion, but the theological
narrowness was soon to counteract the political liberalism. Holding
the creed they did, the ministers gradually came to rule the
nation, and, if it was largely a willing servitude, how could it be
otherwise when they possessed such crushing spiritual sanctions?
Calvinism, as interpreted by Knox and Andrew Melville, involves a
theocracy, and the plain man, out of fear of hell fire, will
surrender his conscience and his judgment as absolutely to his
minister as any Catholic to his priest. A Kirk so inspired will
find itself claiming powers which only supreme genius could wield
without disaster, and the atmosphere will not be favourable for the
presence of genius. Its leaders are more likely to be of the type
which Lord Morley has drawn in Lilburne&mdash;"the men whom all
revolutions are apt to engender: intractable, narrow, dogmatic,
pragmatic, clever hands at syllogism, liberal in uncharitable
imputation and malicious construction, honest in their rather
questionable way, animated by a rather pharisaic love of
self-applause which is in truth not any more meritorious nor less
unsafe than vain love of the world's applause; in a word, not
without sharp insight into theoretic principle, and thinking quite
as little of their own ease as of the ease of others, but without a
trace of the instinct for government or a grain of practical common
sense."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p>The prime defect of the Kirk was intolerance. It shared this
fault with many other communions, but then no communion, save the
Church of Rome, claimed its absolute powers. There was no "liberty
of cult" in Elizabeth's Prayer-book, which laid down the only
lawful form of worship; and Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's&mdash;Izaak
Walton's "good old man and honest<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> angler"&mdash;could clamour
for the death of the Marian bishops as savagely as any Scots
reformer. Laud was tolerant enough about creeds, but not about
church government. In England only the rare few, like Hales and
Falkland and Chillingworth, attained to that true toleration which
is based not on indifference but on spiritual humility;<a name=
"FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> only a few asserted with Milton the right
of private judgment&mdash;"if a man believe things only because his
pastor says so, . . . though his belief be true, yet the very truth
he holds becomes his heresy."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id=
"FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
<p>The question must be viewed in its due historical perspective.
The nursing-ground of intolerance is a complete dogmatic certainty
about the ordering of the world. To the modern mind, accustomed to
think of man as a clot of vivified dust, set on an inconsiderable
planet which revolves with an infinity of others in the immensity
of space, conscious, too, that human life has relations through
countless &aelig;ons with lower existences, and is kin alike to the
brutes and to the stars, it is hard to understand the habit of
thought which about everything can pronounce unhesitatingly that
here is final truth. Such cosmic assurance requires a simple
cosmogony, and this&mdash;save in the case of a few advanced
thinkers&mdash;the seventeenth century possessed. To it the earth
and all therein were made purposely by God for man, and man's
journey heaven-ward or hell-ward was the essential purpose of
creation. It held that a few thousand years earlier the universe
had been fabricated out of chaos in six calendar days, that all
history antecedent to our era had been a preparation for the coming
of Christ, and that, the supreme sacrifice having been
accomplished, at any moment the skies might open, and the trumpets
sound, and the short story of the earth be closed. There were
mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id=
"Page_59">[59]</a></span> indeed, stupendous mysteries, but, if
their content was unplumbed, their limits could be exactly defined.
Such a cosmos was both intimate and simple, made according to man's
scale and for his uses; it was without blurred lines or shadowy
corners, and the mind which accepted it was ready to pronounce upon
its problems as upon matters of ascertained fact.</p>
<p>If the nature of the popular cosmogony predisposed men to dogma,
so did the quality of the revelation that illumined it. That
revelation was absolute; its acceptance gave eternal life, its
neglect eternal torment. Toleration is a high virtue, when it
springs from humility and is regarded as in itself a religious act;
but it is important to remember that in certain mental states it
may be a vice, a synonym for spiritual apathy and moral sloth.
"What," St. Augustine asked, "can be more deadly to the soul than
the liberty of error?" The doctrine of exclusive salvation,
honestly held, involves intolerance, and finds its logical
consequence in persecution. If a man believes that his heart is
desperately wicked, that he is doomed to eternal fires but for the
interposition of God's grace, and that to walk in grace it is
necessary to observe literally the precepts of the Scriptures
without any attempt to rethink them in the light of new
conditions&mdash;nay, that such an attempt is in God's eye the
unpardonable sin&mdash;tolerance must be only another name for
lukewarmness, and reason only the temptation of the devil. If he is
right, all those who differ from him must be wrong, and it is his
duty to enforce his faith with fire and sword. What suffering that
man can inflict is comparable to the eternal misery of those who
embrace false doctrine? This was the creed alike of St. Augustine
and St. Thomas Aquinas; it was an integral part of
seventeenth-century Protestant theology: in a milder form it will
be found in more than one Papal bull of the nineteenth century.
Even a liberal thinker like Richard Baxter pronounced toleration to
be "soul murder," and in that era only Cromwell in practice, and
men like Harrington, Milton, Jeremy Taylor, and Chillingworth in
their writings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id=
"Page_60">[60]</a></span> propounded a gentler doctrine. It is
unhappily true that in such an age the best men, in whom religion
is a living fire, are apt to be the narrowest. "The only true
spirit of tolerance," Coleridge has written, "consists in
conscientious toleration of each other's intolerance. Whatever
pretends to be more than this, is either the unthinking cant of

indifference."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id=

"fnanchor">[52]</a> But before such a mood can be attained, there
must be a critical breaking-down of the adamantine bulwarks of
dogma. Charles James Fox was right when he said that "the only
foundation for toleration is a degree of scepticism."<a name=
"FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Only the rare few could conceive of a

duty.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p>The Scottish Kirk held the current doctrine in its extremest
form, and for a manual of practice had recourse to the Bible. She
interpreted it arbitrarily and literally, forgetting Donne's
pregnant saying that "sentences in Scripture, like hairs in horses'
tails, concur in one root of beauty and strength, but, being
plucked out one by one, serve only for springes and snares."
Finding little warrant for force in the New Testament, her divines
had recourse to the Old Testament, where they discovered
encouraging precedents in the doings of Elijah and Hezekiah and
Josiah. This constant resort to the Mosaic dispensation encouraged
a stiff and autocratic temper. Cromwell's famous appeal&mdash;"We
should be pitiful . . . and tender towards all though of different
judgments. . . . Love all, tender all, cherish and countenance all,
in all things that are good. . . . And if the poorest Christian,
the most mistaken Christian, shall desire to live peaceably and
quietly under you&mdash;I say, if any shall<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> desire but
to lead a life of godliness and honesty, let him be
protected"&mdash;would have sounded in their ears like a fearful
blasphemy. Their church was a theocracy, and that involves both a
claim to infallibility and a meticulous physical discipline applied
in the spiritual sphere. They held the keys of heaven and hell, and
had power to deliver the erring over to Satan and to anticipate by
exemplary punishment in this world the torments of the
next.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p>With such a creed there could be no real delimitation between
the spiritual and the secular, between Church and State. The right
of the Kirk to dominate personal and family life was soon extended
to the duty of interference with civil government. Indeed, the
rejection of toleration and the belief in uniformity led inevitably
to a usurpation of civil power. The Kirk believed, as Catholicism
believed, in a single church, a complete and exclusive system to
which a single separatist was anathema. In her zeal for uniformity
she in no way differed from Laud, though she preferred another
pattern. The secularization of politics did not fully come about
till the toleration of religious variety had first been
established. When the Kirk usurped powers which seem to us in no
way to belong to her province, she was following the prevailing
tendency of the age. She was true to the medi&aelig;val idea of one
church, one rule. Against the universal claim of Rome it was
necessary to establish a counter-universalism. Presbytery
professed, as Rome professed, to be based upon <i>jus divinum</i>,
and therefore there could be no limits to its sovereignty. With
Catholic and Anglican it waged truceless war, but it drew, like
them, from the Middle Ages, and accepted the same kind of dogmatic
sanction. High Cavalier and high Covenanter talked the same
language, though with different applications, and divine right was
the watchword of both. To each the man who looked upon the world
with a cool secular eye and talked sober reason was worse than
their avowed opponents; he was a heretic in the
fundament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id=
"Page_62">[62]</a></span>als, the ultimate blasphemer.</p>
<p>The Scottish ministers have fared ill with later historians,
except in the copious literature of their own communion. The wisest
and greatest, Robert Leighton, belongs to a later date, and soon
deserted the manse of Newbattle. They have been represented as
violent and illiterate peasants, mob-orators rather than divines.
As a matter of fact, they sprang either from the landed gentry and
the clergy, or from well-to-do burgher families. Robert Traill had
for his father a gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Prince Henry;
Robert Blair was the son of an Ayrshire laird, and his mother was a
Mure of Rowallan; James Durham was an Angus proprietor; Robert
Baillie was of the Baillies of Lamington; Robert Douglas was a son
of that George Douglas who helped Queen Mary to escape from
Lochleven; James Guthrie was a son of Guthrie of that ilk. Almost
all had received a sound education in the humanities as well as in
theology, and some, like Robert Boyd and Alexander Henderson, Hugh
Binning and Samuel Rutherford, were notable scholars. Among them,
too, were many types of mind and temperament, from the political
shrewdness of Robert Baillie and the quaint humanity of William
Guthrie of Fenwick to the fanatic hardness of Nevoy and the
oriental lusciousness of Samuel Rutherford.<a name="FNanchor_56_56"
id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p>They preached a creed which, in most of its details, is now
forgotten, and the language of which is fantastic or ridiculous to
our ears. They laid down as the necessary and universal progress
towards salvation a rigid curriculum of
experiences&mdash;"exercise," "law-work," "discovery of interest,"
"damps," "challenge," "outgate," "assurance." Well might a later
seventeenth-century Scotsman exclaim: "I doubt it hath occasioned
much unnecessary disquiet to some holy persons that they have not
found such a regular and orderly transaction in their souls as they
have seen described in the books. . . . God hath several ways of
dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id=
"Page_63">[63]</a></span> with the souls of men, and it sufficeth
if the work be accomplished whatever the methods have
been."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But behind their
narrowness and their legal jargon we can see in many the true
exaltation of the saint. Among the crudities and absurdities of
their sermons and biographies there are passages of apostolic
power, visions such as George Fox records in his journal, which led
them to an ecstasy of praise, moments of deep tenderness towards
the souls of their flocks. They must be judged by their work, and
beyond doubt they gave to the Scottish people a moral seriousness,
a conception of the deeper issues of life, and an intellectual
<i>ascesis</i>, gifts which may well atone for their many
infirmities.</p>
<p>Yet there is much to be atoned for, and the immediate result of
their predominance was not less disastrous than beneficent.
"Deliver me, O Lord," was the cry of Archbishop Leighton, "from the
errors of wise men, yea, and of good men."<a name="FNanchor_58_58"
id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class=
"fnanchor">[58]</a> They perverted the Gospel into a thing of
subtle legal conundrums; they made morality difficult by destroying
its rational basis; they took the colour out of life for their
people by condemning the innocencies of the world with a more than
monastic austerity; they inflamed the superstitions of the country
by peopling it with a fanciful pandemonium. If any one has the
patience to labour through a dozen volumes of their sermons, he
will be aghast at the childishness and irreverence of much of their
teaching. Like an African witch-doctor, they "smelled out"
offenders, and they were the principal upstay of witch-burning.
Miracles and portents adorned their path, and natural laws were
suspended to point their lessons. They magnified their office till
they hedged themselves round with a bastard divinity. The clouds of
their dogmatic terrors darkened the world for their hearers, and
condemned weak spirits to religious mania. Their neurotic
supernaturalism, which saw judgments and signs in the common
incidents of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id=
"Page_64">[64]</a></span> weakened in the people the power of
rational thought.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id=
"FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a> If they gave manhood and liberty to Scotland,
they did much to sap the first and shackle the second. Condemning
natural pleasures and affections, they drew a dark pall over the
old merry Scottish world, the world of the ballads and the songs,
of frolics and mummings and "blithesome bridals," and, since human
nature will not be denied, drove men and women to sinister and
perverted outlets. In a word, they established over the whole of
human life, alike in its public duties and in its most intimate
private affairs, a harsh and senseless tyranny, and against them,
as the delegates of heaven, there was no appeal. Tougher spirits
might emerge unscathed and even fortified, but the frail were
warped and demented. Yet it was the strongest thing in Scotland,
and presently in all the Lowlands it had made good its sway over
every class of the people; <i>ruere in servitium consules, patres,
eques</i>.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>To balance the claims of the Kirk there was no strong apparatus
of secular government. The so-called Parliament, with its three
estates of clergy, tenants-in-chief, and burgesses, delegated its
power in the Lords of the Articles, who had the sole right to
initiate business, and the selection of whom was controlled by the
king. It was neither representative nor free. "The Crown
manipulated elections, determined the composition of the committee
through which all business must pass before it reached the throne,
sternly limited the time allowed for the discussion of the
committee's report, forced a long series of measures through the
House at a single sitting, and cajoled or threatened
opponents."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id=
"FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class=
"fnanchor">[60]</a> The Privy Council, the equivalent of the
Cabinet, was almost identical with the Lords of the Articles. The
Convention of Royal Burghs was a kind of minor
parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id=
"Page_65">[65]</a></span> charged with burgh concerns, and its
existence did much to distract the interest of burgess members from
national affairs. In all this mechanism there was no authority
which could act as a makeweight to the growing popular authority of
the Kirk, guard the liberties of Scotland against royal
encroachment, or, on behalf of the nation at large, control the
traditional high-handedness of the nobility.</p>
<p>The Scottish nobles from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century
were probably the most turbulent, rapacious, and ignorant in
Europe. Resolute champions of indefensible privileges, they
resisted all the reforming efforts of their kings, and were the
death of more than one sovereign. They had not even the merit of
patriotism, for often they were in arms against their own land, and
Scottish history is stored with ugly tales of treason. Their prime
foes had been the king and the church, and they had always cast
longing eyes at the fat abbeys and the rich glebes of their
clerical rivals. The Reformation gave them their chance. Two-thirds
of the church plunder fell into their hands, and their
Protestantism was mainly determined by self-interest. Knox
complained, not without reason, that in all the Lords of the
Congregation there was not one righteous man. A few became dogmatic
enthusiasts, but the majority cared as little for the difference
between priest and minister as for the Ten Commandments. Nor were
they, like many of the great families of England&mdash;like
Pembroke in Wiltshire, or Stanley in Lancashire, or Beaufort on the
West Marches&mdash;magnates who performed useful duties of local
administration. Their medi&aelig;val satrapies were antagonistic to the
first principles of a modern state. Knox had struggled to win from
the old church property reasonable endowments for his new Kirk, but
the tithes and the lands went to the nobles and barons, who were
determined not to disgorge. Their opposition to the Anglicanism of
Charles was largely due to the fact that it involved sooner or
later a redivision of ecclesiastical plunder; they would vehemently
oppose any church except one which they could starve.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>At first sight it would seem that there could be little in
common between a proud Kirk, with a great popular following, laying
down the austerest rule of life, and a nobility which was
irreligious and oppressive, which clung to wealth which Knox had
destined for the Kirk, and of which the Kirk was sorely in need.
Indeed it was only the blundering of the king that prevented a
breach between the two, with the clergy for once on the royal side.
The tithe had become a crying scandal, for the feudal lords, to
whom it had passed, could levy it in kind much as they pleased and
when they pleased, so that the tenant could not get in his harvest
till the lord had taken his toll. In 1625 Charles undertook the
work of reform. He removed the judges from the Privy Council, that
they might have time for their proper business of the Court of
Session, and by the Act of Revocation of 1625 he attempted to
recover as much as he could of the old church property for national
uses. In the most modern way he appointed a royal commission to
work out the details; the teinds were to afford a living wage to
the ministers, and the holders of church lands were in future to
pay rent to the Crown. Mr. Gardiner calls the measure the "one
successful act of Charles's reign," and considers that it "weakened
the power of the nobility, and strengthened the prerogative in the
only way in which the prerogative deserved to be strengthened . . .
by the popularity it gained through carrying into effect a wise and
beneficent reform."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id=
"FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class=
"fnanchor">[61]</a> But no popularity followed. Perhaps the
money-getting motive was too clear in the reform, for it was
instituted after the English Parliament had refused to grant
adequate supplies; perhaps the royal interference with property
suggested further revolutionary designs. At any rate the king got
no gratitude from the Kirk, and he incurred the deadly displeasure
of the aristocracy. The way was prepared for an alliance between
the two contraries, who were agreed only in their stubborn
conservatism&mdash;nobles desperately intent on holding what their
fathers had won, and churchmen desperately in<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> earnest
about their spiritual prerogatives. It was a very pretty
powder-magazine for the inevitable spark.</p>
<p>The time was one of deep poverty for the common people. The
bonnet-lairds and the tacksmen, the labourers and shepherds, the
petty craftsmen in the villages, even the burghers in the little
towns, lived very near the edge of destitution. The rudimentary and
wasteful system of agriculture, with its sodden in-fields and its
rank out-fields, its wretched grain, its shallow ploughing, placed
the farmers at the mercy of an indifferent climate and a poor
soil&mdash;for the richer valley bottoms were uncultivable from
lack of drainage. Stock was in no better case, for the cattle were
stunted and perpetually lean, and the sheep were moving masses of
tar and vermin. At the close of each winter the spectre of
starvation came very near to man and beast. Idyllic pictures have
been drawn of the Covenanting peasant as a stalwart fellow in good
homespun clothes and blue bonnet, and of his house as a snug
dwelling like an illustration to <i>The Cotter's Saturday
Night</i>. The truth seems to be that the physique of most was
early ruined by poor feeding and incessant toil, that they had
small regard for bodily cleanliness, that their clothes were coarse
at the best and generally ragged, and that their dwellings
resembled a Connemara cabin. Recurrent plagues carried off their
thousands, and foul habits and a diet of thin brose and bannocks
weakened the survivors. Nasty, brutish, and short was the life of
the seventeenth-century Lowlander. Education did something to
counterbalance the economic defects, but it is easy to exaggerate
the extent of Scottish education at this era. Kirkton, indeed,
records that before 1660 "every village had a school, every family
almost had a Bible, yea, in most of the country all the children of
age could read the Scriptures"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id=
"FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a>; but Kirkton was <i>laudator temporis acti</i>,
and his testimony is not borne out by parish and burgh records.
Knox's great scheme remained largely an unrealized ideal; the
report of the commission of 1627 reveals very many<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> parishes
in the Lowlands and the Borders without school or schoolmaster; and
the remedial Acts of 1633 and 1643 were for the most part a dead
letter. The fact that the new religion was based on private
Bible-reading was indeed an inducement to literacy, but in the very
places where theological interest was keenest we find a surprising
proportion unable to write, while Wodrow was told by his father
that in his day "the generality by far in the country . . . could
not read."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p>There was no middle-class to act as a force of social
persistence and a sober nursery of new civic ideas, like the great
bourgeoisie which was the strength of English Puritanism. Scottish
commerce was a petty thing; her <i>noblesse de robe</i> were
reactionary manipulators of a reactionary law; her burghers and
bonnet-lairds were too near the peasant; she had no parallel class
to the yeomanry and merchantry of England. If strife came it would
be conducted between king, nobles, and Kirk, with the bulk of the
people obedient under the spiritual narcotics of the last. There
was little hope for that fruitful political dispute which is the
basis of a free polity, but for wild and barren explosions there
was an uncomfortable amount of powder.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1633-35</i></div>
<p>The spark came from a blundering king. Charles had been born and
educated in Scotland, and, according to Clarendon, was "always an
immoderate lover of the Scottish nation"; but he had not his
father's knowledge of the national temperament, and he had for his
advisers on Scottish affairs men altogether out of touch with the
people. When he came to Scotland in the summer of 1633 to be
crowned, he had already estranged the nobility by his perfectly
just and reasonable treatment of the tithes question. The visit
revealed the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id=
"Page_69">[69]</a></span>istence of an opposition even in the
packed Scots Parliament, and, since Laud was in his company, the
coronation ceremonies roused suspicion in Presbyterian breasts. In
August of that year Laud became Archbishop of Canterbury, and
entered upon the policy of reclaiming Scottish barbarism to his
ideal of ecclesiastical decency. A year later the Court of High
Commission was established by royal warrant, and the number of
bishops in the Privy Council was increased to seven. In January
1635 Archbishop Spottiswoode was made Chancellor in succession to
Kinnoull, the first time since the Reformation that the office had
been given to a churchman.</p>
<p>The Scottish hierarchy of the time has been portrayed, perhaps,
in darker colours than it deserves. Spottiswoode himself, and men
like Forbes and Maxwell, Sydserf and Wedderburn, were liberal in
doctrine and exemplary in private life, and saintliness was the
prerogative of neither party. But the bishops for good and ill were
out of tune with their countrymen; they represented a theological
creed which was in advance of their age, and an ecclesiastical
creed which lagged behind it, for they did not appreciate the
passion for spiritual autonomy which had become part of the
national mood.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id=
"FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class=
"fnanchor">[64]</a> They were impossible as mediators, since the
best of them talked a language unintelligible to that age, and the
worst of them shared in Laud's perilous hieratic dreams. They might
be intellectually tolerant like their leader, but they were
ecclesiastically dogmatic. Their sudden rise to political power
roused the extreme suspicion of the Kirk, it offended the pride of
the nobles, and it stirred the opposition of even the staunchest
moderates. "That Churchmen have competency," wrote Montrose's
guardian and brother-in-law, Lord Napier, "is agreeable to the law
of God and man; but to invest them into great estates and principal
offices of the State, is neither convenient for the Church, for the
King, nor for the State. . .<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70"
id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> . Histories witness what troubles have
been raised to kings, what tragedies amongst subjects, in all
places where Churchmen were great. Our reformed Churches, having
reduced religion to the ancient primitive truth and simplicity,
ought to beware that corruption enter not into their Church in the
same gate."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id=

<p>In the year 1635 the royal blunders multiplied. A temperate
protest by Lord Balmerino against certain recent acts came into
Spottiswoode's hand, and thence to the king's. It was construed as
high treason, and in March 1635 the writer was put on trial,
convicted by a majority of one, and condemned to death. He was
presently pardoned, but the affair deeply impressed his countrymen;
it was the bishops' doing, and it seemed as if the old liberty was
now dead in the land. A crisis had been reached when a man like
Drummond of Hawthornden, no lover of the Kirk, was forced into
vigorous remonstrance, and could advise his sovereign to study
Buchanan's <i>De Jure Regni apud Scotos</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In May a royal warrant authorized a new
book of canons to regulate the government of the Church of
Scotland, and the book was published in January 1636, prepared by a
committee of the Scottish bishops and revised by Laud and Juxon. It
re-enacted in substance the Articles of Perth, which had become a
dead letter, prohibited extempore prayer, allowed confession, and
claimed for the king supreme authority in ecclesiastical causes.
More ominous still, it promised a service book, or liturgy, and
threatened in advance excommunication against all those who should
not accept it. It would be hard to conceive of a more foolish
provocation. The book had no authority except the royal <i>ipse
dixit</i>, and yet many of the canons dealt with civil as well as
with ecclesiastical law.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id=
"FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a> It challenged not only religious but political
liberty.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1636-37</i><span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></div>
<p>The promised liturgy appeared in an atmosphere already
superheated. In November 1636 Charles wrote to the Privy Council,
ordering that the new "Book of Public Service" be used, and that
each parish provide itself with two copies before the following
Easter. But it was not till 1637 that the book was published. It is
probable that the Scottish bishops had little to do with it, for
even the most sacerdotal among them hesitated before this monstrous
innovation.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id=
"FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class=
"fnanchor">[68]</a> Laud and his English colleagues took the
English Prayer-book, made a few changes which the Scottish
hierarchy had suggested, and made many others in the direction of a
more exacting ritual. "The book, with the canons which preceded it,
had no ecclesiastical sanction, either of all the bishops, or of a
General Assembly. The imposition was an act of sheer royal
autocratic papacy; the book, being English, insulted Scottish
national sentiment; the changes from the English version were
deemed to imply a nearer approach to Rome. Protestantism was in
danger. The landowners suspected that Charles meant to recover some
of their old ecclesiastical estates for the rebuilding of
cathedrals and cleaning of churches; and thus, from the 'rascal
multitude' upwards, through every rank and condition of his
subjects, he gave intolerable offence, and caused extreme
apprehension. He lost three kingdoms and his head, not for a mass,
but for a surplice."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id=
"FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class=
"fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
<p>The tumult was instant and universal. The devout women of
Edinburgh rose in their wrath, and the first attempt to read the
new service-book in St. Giles's church was the signal for a
riot.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The flame ran fast over
Scotland, for the offence was grievous; to endure such interference
with private worship was to stultify the whole Reformation
principle, and to sit quiet under flagrant illegality was to
sacrifice the ancient liberties of the realm. Every post to England
carried a supplication or remonstrance to His Majesty.<a name=

class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The Privy Council, divided between the

which Charles would not receive, and meantime it was being flooded
with petitions from every part of the Lowlands. The king's
proclamations only made matters worse, and by October public
meetings were being held everywhere, bishops were being rabbled,
and the pacific Mr. Robert Baillie was writing: "No man may speak
anything in public for the king's part, except he could have
himself marked for a sacrifice to be killed one day. I think our
people possessed with a bloody devill."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1637</i></div>
<p>On 15th November an important step was taken. With the sanction
of the Lord Advocate, Sir Thomas Hope, the malcontents organized
themselves into a body of commissioners&mdash;four committees of
nobles, lairds, burgesses, and ministers, henceforth to be known as
the Tables. It was in substance a provisional government, and
behind it was all Scotland, except the remoter Highlands and
Aberdeen. In opposition to the king stood the solid phalanx of the
Kirk, led by Alexander Henderson of Leuchars, the ablest statesman
among the ministers; the burgesses were unanimous on the same side,
as were also the lawyers; the lairds were represented by such names
as Stirling of Keir, Hume of Wedderburn, Douglas of Cavers, Fraser
of Philorth, Mure of Rowallan, and Agnew of Lochnaw; among the
nobles were Sutherland, Cromartie, Ruthven, Eglinton, Wemyss,
Lothian, Home, Loudoun, Lindsay, and Yester. The peerage and the
lesser baronage of Scotland were united as they had never been
before and were never to be again. Even the Lords of the Council
were inclining to the malcontents, and the bishops had withdrawn
from that uneasy assembly.</p>
<p>At the meeting of petitioners on 15th November the young
Montrose was present. In September leading ministers had been
appointed to secure adherents for the opposition, and Mr. Robert
Murray of Methven was nominated for Perth and Stirling. Montrose
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73">[73]</a></span> a later date named Mr. Murray as "an
instrument of bringing me to their cause."<a name="FNanchor_73_73"
id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class=
"fnanchor">[73]</a> Along with Rothes, Loudoun, and Lindsay of the
Byres he was appointed to the Table of the nobility.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1638</i></div>
<p>The unrest could have only one consequence. Traquair, the
Treasurer, got no comfort at the royal court; indeed, in a
proclamation which he brought back in February 1638, Charles took
complete responsibility for the new liturgy, and required all
petitioners to disperse on pain of treason and not to reassemble
without the Council's consent. On February 22, 1638, when that
proclamation was made in Edinburgh, a public protestation was read
by Wariston, and one act of war was met by another. On that day
Montrose was among the protesting leaders, mounted in boyish
enthusiasm on a barrel, so that the prophetic soul of Rothes was
moved to observe: "James, you will never be at rest till you are
lifted up above the rest in three fathoms of a rope."<a name=
"FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The Tables decided to revive the Covenant
of 1581 against popery, and to add their own grievances, and
Alexander Henderson and Wariston drafted the new version. It was an
old device, for when the Scottish nobles chose to walk in the path
of rebellion it had been their fashion to enter into "ane band."
This was, however, to be a legal act, and to make the Almighty a
party; in Wariston's word it was "the glorious marriage day of the
Kingdom with God."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id=
"FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class=
"fnanchor">[75]</a> The first part repeated the Covenant of 1581
against Rome; the second part recited the acts of Parliament passed
since the Reformation in favour of the Kirk; the third part pledged
its signatories to defend their religion against all innovations
not sanctioned by Parliament and Assembly, and to "stand to the
defence of our dread sovereign the King's Majesty, his person and
authority, in the defence and preservation of the foresaid true
religion, liberties, and laws of this Kingdom." It was a candid and
straightforward document, temperately expressed and accurately
directed to the grievances which it was designed to remedy.
Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id=
"Page_74">[74]</a></span>e claim was to both spiritual and civil
freedom, and the formidable sanction behind it was at once
ecclesiastical, feudal, and democratic. On the last day of February
it was read in Greyfriars' church in Edinburgh, with its solemn
appeal that "religion and righteousness may flourish in the land,
to the glory of God, the honour of the King, and the peace and
comfort of us all." On that and succeeding days it was signed amid
scenes of deep popular emotion, and in subsequent months copies
were carried far and wide through the land, and even overseas to
Scots serving in foreign wars.</p>
<p>On the first day Montrose subscribed his name. According to
Baillie he was brought in "by the canniness of Rothes." John
Leslie, sixth Earl of Rothes, was an adroit diplomat, and had an
old grievance against the Act of Revocation. He was disliked by
Charles, and probably returned the dislike. He was little of a
precisian in character, for he is described by Clarendon as "very
free and amorous, and unrestrained in his discourse by any scruples
of religion, which he only put on when the parts he had to act
required it, and then no man could appear more conscientiously
transported"; nor was he extreme in politics, and Clarendon
believed that but for his early death he would have gone over to
the king's side.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id=
"FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class=
"fnanchor">[76]</a> Doubtless Rothes desired to strengthen the
movement by the adhesion of the representative of an historic
house, who was still an attractive mystery to his countrymen;
doubtless Montrose was not insensitive to the persuasive charm of
one who was much his elder and was the most generally popular man
in Scotland. Talks with Rothes and Mr. Robert Murray, and the fact
that the Fife nobles with whom he had spent much of his time during
his St. Andrews years were among the promoters of the new Covenant,
may have predisposed him to the popular side.</p>

<br>
<p>But indeed Montrose required no "canniness" of noble or cleric
to help him to a decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>. There were those among the
protagonists of the Covenant who may have been antipathetic to
him&mdash;Loudoun, his colleague on the Tables, who had been a
Campbell of Lawers and was trusted by no man; Wariston, that
strange youth of twenty-seven, a devotee in a lawyer's gown, who
would forget time in prayer and be on his knees for fourteen hours
at a stretch, and often, as his nephew Burnet tells us, slept but
three hours in the twenty-four. But all Scotland was in the bond,
except a few Catholic nobles and Aberdeen doctors, and in it were
the companions of his youth, and Napier, his most trusted
counsellor. The Covenant was legal, pronounced to be so by the Lord
Advocate and by the bulk of the judges, and Montrose from his youth
was a lover of legality.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id=
"FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> Further, the main issues were not yet confused.
There was no attack upon the king's authority; indeed, the royal
sovereignty was vehemently asserted. The bishops were unpopular,
but there was as yet little of that morbid hatred of the very name
of episcopacy which followed later, when dislike of the thing done
became detestation of the suspected means. In 1637 Baillie could
still write: "Bishops I love;"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id=
"FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class=
"fnanchor">[78]</a> and there must have been many in Edinburgh to
relish the dialectical triumph of the Episcopalian vintner over the
Presbyterian shoemaker, recorded by James Howell in his letter to
Lord Clifford.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id=
"FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a> The true point of conflict was far greater than
any squabble about niceties of church government. It was the right
of Scotland to her ancestral liberties, the confinement of
prerogative within its legal limits, the keeping of churchmen out
of civil offices. To a young man nourished on Plutarch and
Thucydides and familiar with the current political thought of
Europe, to one who at no time in his life could tolerate the
ecclesiastic in politics, to a Scotsman who had his full share of
the national pride, the cause of the Covenant was the cause of the
patriot, the philosopher, and the well-wisher to the
king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>That February noon in Greyfriars was one of the most momentous
in our history, for it was the first step in a conflict which did
not end till the December day, half a century later, when a king of
England became an exile. To Charles it may at first have seemed but
another spasm of recalcitrance which would be presently
forgotten&mdash;a matter less important than the impending judgment
of the Exchequer Chamber in the ship-money case. But when the news
out of Scotland came, after many days, to the ears of a certain
middle-aged Huntingdonshire grazier, who had lately removed to Ely,
it may have caused deeper reflections. For this grazier, in the
intervals of examining the work of God in his soul, had a quick eye
for public portents, and he had won so much prestige as the
defender of the rights of the fen commoners, that he might hope to
be sent to Westminster, should the king call another
Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1638</i></div>
<p>The National Covenant was based upon sound constitutional law,
but the form of the protest&mdash;the "band" borrowed from the
Middle Ages&mdash;and certain passages in the document were of
dubious legality. Especially ominous was the clause which bound the
signatories to mutual defence "against all sorts of persons
whatsoever," which might be interpreted as including the king.
There were many irregularities in the obtaining of signatures, for
in certain districts it was "obtruded upon people with
threatenings, tearing of clothes, drawing of blood."<a name=
"FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Moreover, to Charles in Whitehall it
might have seemed that there had been already overt acts of
revolution. The new Committee of Sixteen, the Tables, had set about
organizing a provisional Government. As early as February 1638
steps had been taken to raise a revenue. In March a "voluntary" tax
was levied in every shire of one dollar for every thousand merks of
free rent; the Covenanting lords subscribed largely, and
twenty-five dollars w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id=
"Page_78">[78]</a></span>as Montrose's contribution; there were
signs that presently the levy would cease to be optional, and that
non-Covenanters would be mulcted.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id=
"FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a> It all looked suspiciously like the creation of
a war-chest. It was certain, too, that the movement would not
remain within the four corners of the Covenant, but was capable of
indefinite extension. The country was on fire, and every Sunday the
ministers were fanning the flame. Wariston records a sermon in
Edinburgh on 1st April, when the preacher, Mr. Rollock, after
reading the Covenant, requested the nobles present&mdash;Montrose,
Boyd, Loudoun, and Balmerino&mdash;to hold up their hands and swear
by the name of the living God: "at the which instant of rising up,
and then of holding up their hands, there rose sic a yelloch, sic
abundance of tears, sic a heavenly harmony of sighs and sobs,
universally through all the corners of the church, as the like was
never seen nor heard of."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id=
"FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class=
"fnanchor">[82]</a> Scotland was in a high-strung and perilous
mood.</p>
<p>The wise course for Charles would have been to withdraw the
service book and to give assurance that he would meddle no more
with property and heritable jurisdictions; in that way he would
have driven a wedge between those unnatural allies, the nobles and
the Kirk. But from this course he was estopped by his passionate
desire, fostered by Laud, to establish a uniform standard of
worship throughout his realm, and the fear that such a concession
would weaken his cause in the quarrel now drawing to a head with
the English Parliament. He would fain have acted as he did in the
ship-money case, and have secured a condemnation of the Covenant in
the law courts, but the whole Scottish bench and bar believed in
its legality.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id=
"FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class=
"fnanchor">[83]</a> He had for a moment hopes of organizing a
royalist opposition in Scotland, with the help of the Highland
clans and possibly of Irish troops under Antrim, but he abandoned
the project when he realized that, except for Huntly and the
Gordons, and the doubtful cases of Hamilton,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> Lanark,
Traquair, and Roxburgh, he had at the moment no Scottish
supporters. Yet the king, who had at times no mean capacity for
judging a situation, arrived at a shrewder estimate of the Scottish
situation than his advisers. If he was to win his will force must
be used, and to collect that force he must have time. The Privy
Council had sent the Justice Clerk to court to expound the true
state of Scotland. The king was impressed, and summoned Traquair
and Roxburgh to advise him; Spottiswoode, too, and certain of the
Scots bishops; likewise Lord Lorn, who had not signed the Covenant,
and whom Baillie thought the most powerful subject in the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The outcome of this
consultation was that the Marquis of Hamilton was appointed a
special royal commissioner to Scotland, with authority to treat
with the malcontents.</p>
<p>It is clear that Charles was only playing for time, and his
unfortunate envoy knew well the futility of his errand. Scotland,
as he once told the king, he hated "next to hell," and he had no
liking for a task where success and failure would be alike without
profit to himself. He arrived in the north on 7th June, to find
sullen looks and little of the welcome due to a royal commissioner.
He brought with him two proclamations, which promised that the
canons and the service book would not be pressed "except in such a
fair and legal way as should satisfy all our loving subjects"; one
demanded that all copies of the Covenant should be surrendered,
which the other did not; he was to use one or other according to
his discretion. Traquair and Roxburgh had already warned him that a
demand to give up the Covenant would wreck his mission; and, since
the tenor of the first proclamation had become known, his diplomacy
was prejudiced from the start. He saw Rothes, and the Tables
appointed a committee of three ministers and three nobles to confer
with him, one of whom was Montrose. Things had moved fast during
the previous months. Henderson and Wariston had prepared "articles
of peace," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id=
"Page_80">[80]</a></span> went far beyond the mere matter of the
liturgy. The Committee of the Tables asked for the withdrawal of
the obnoxious canons and service book, but they also demanded the
summoning of a free General Assembly, and, finally, of a Parliament
to decide all the questions at issue. The Scottish Church was to
shape its own ecclesiastical policy, and a Scottish Parliament was
to give such policy the validity of the civil law. It was an honest
assertion of a justifiable nationalism.</p>
<p>Hamilton hummed and hawed, promised and withdrew, and finally
left Edinburgh in despair. While negotiating with the Covenanters,
he had been discussing secretly with his master the possibilities
for the use of arms in Scotland&mdash;the chance of help from the
Highland clans who hated Lorn; the best base to hold, since
Edinburgh castle was in Covenanting hands. Charles was adamant on
the question of giving up the Covenant; otherwise, he said, he "had
no more power than the Duke of Venice," and he intended "not to
yield to the demands of those traitors, the Covenanters."<a name=
"FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a> With such terms in his instructions no
emissary had a chance. The king was negotiating only to gain time,
and the duplicity of the monarch was matched by that of his
commissioner. For we know, on Montrose's evidence, that Hamilton
privately told the Covenanters, "as a kindly Scotsman," that if
they took a firm stand they were likely to win.<a name=
"FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Then ensued a war of king's proclamations
and Covenanting protests. Hamilton fluttered between London and
Scotland, carrying royal concessions&mdash;lavish concessions which
meant nothing, since Charles had already determined to appeal to
the arbitrament of war. In any case they came too late. The king
proposed a new covenant of his own, the chief point of which was
the abjuration of popery; but the Covenanting leaders, whose
detestation of Rome needed no advertisement, not unnaturally
described it as a "mockery of God." Their aim was now nothing less
than the complete suppression of episcopacy in Scotland. But the
General Assembly was granted,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> and Hamilton had succeeded
in some degree in sowing suspicion between the nobility and clergy
by warning each of the danger to be apprehended from the other.</p>
<p>During the absence of the royal commissioner from Scotland in
July, the Tables made a great effort to win Aberdeen and the Gordon
country to the Covenant's side. Huntly himself would have none of
it. His house might be perverse and uncertain, but it never lacked
a high spirit and a wild chivalry, and he went his own way
contemptuous of Lowland fashions. The Tables sent Colonel Robert
Monro, an old soldier of Gustavus, to ask him to subscribe the
Covenant, promising to give him first place in the command of their
forces; but Huntly replied nobly that his family had risen by the
kings of Scotland, and that if the king were to fall he was
resolved to bury his life, honour, and estate under the
rubbish.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But something might be
done in the city and its environs, though Knox's disputation in
1561 with the Aberdeen professors was not an encouraging precedent.
Montrose, with three ministers in his suite&mdash;Mr. Alexander
Henderson, Mr. David Dickson, and Mr. Andrew Cant&mdash;arrived on
20th July, bearing a letter from Rothes to his cousin the provost,
Patrick Leslie. "Do ye all the good ye can in that town and in the
country about&mdash;ye will not regret it&mdash;and attend my Lord
Montrose, who is a noble and true-hearted cavalier."<a name=
"FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Montrose had been made a burgess of
Aberdeen nine years before, and he and his retinue were hospitably
welcomed. But he seems to have been in an unbending humour. He
declined the proffered banquet until the authorities submitted to
the Covenant, whereupon the provost and the bailies distributed the
wine among the poor.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id=
"FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class=
"fnanchor">[89]</a> On the Sunday the three ministers proposed to
occupy the city pulpits, but the Aberdeen clergy were not to be
ousted. The missionaries were accommodated in a yard attached to
the Earl Marischal's town-house, where his sister, Lady Pitsligo,
was then dwelling. The three preached in turn from a wooden
gallery, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">[82]</a></span> Monday repeated the performance, amid the
ribaldry of certain scoffers in an adjoining building.</p>
<p>Thereafter the envoys proceeded into the neighbouring villages,
where they met with more success.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id=
"FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class=
"fnanchor">[90]</a> The Aberdeen ministers presented fourteen
"demands," and there followed a wordy warfare of "answers,"
"replies," and "duplies," in which the Covenant champions did not
get the best of the argument.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id=
"FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class=
"fnanchor">[91]</a> Aberdeen declared that it adhered to the
discipline of the reformed Kirk of Scotland, but refused to condemn
episcopacy or admit "the immutability of presbyterial
government."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id=
"FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a> It is to be noted that, in asking for
subscriptions to the Covenant, Montrose drew up and made his
colleagues sign an emphatic declaration "that we neither had nor
have any intention but of loyalty to his Majesty, as the Covenant
bears."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He was interpreting
what he then believed&mdash;and the bulk of Scotland with
him&mdash;to be its spirit. But the incident is piquant when we
remember who were his ministerial companions. Henderson, the wisest
head and the purest character in the Kirk, was five years later to
make the last attempt to hold him to the Covenant's side, and
Dickson and Cant were to be the central pillars of the theocracy
which he sought to overthrow. Perhaps on that northern journey he
may have found in their hearts that which gave his enthusiasm
pause, and developed those scruples which made Baillie complain
that he was "hard to be guided," and "capricious for his own
fancies."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> He returned to
Edinburgh at the end of July with but little to show for his
labours. His future visits to Aberdeen were to be to better
purpose.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1638</i></div>
<p>The Assembly which met in Glasgow in November was a legal
gathering, sanctioned by the king, and duly presided over by
Hamilton, the royal commissioner. The issues between sovereign and
people had been narrowed. Charles had surrendered all the earlier
objects of strife&mdash;the liturgy, the book of canons, and an
irresponsible episcopate. It appeared that he was prepared to
accept a moderate episcopacy responsible to a General Assembly, the
original constitution of the Reformed Kirk in Scotland. But with
the people at large the controversy had now gone far beyond the
articles of the National Covenant. Episcopacy in any form had
become suspect, because it had been made the instrument of an
assault upon both civil and religious freedom. To Charles, as to
Hamilton, some form of episcopate was an essential corollary of a
monarchy. To them it appeared that the control over the Kirk given
by bishops appointed by the king was the only safeguard against an
anarchical theocracy; to the Scottish people it seemed that so long
as this channel for arbitrary government was left unblocked there
was no security against further encroachments upon their liberties.
The historian may admit that there was reason in both views, but it
was certain that the Assembly, the first held for twenty years,
would demand the complete removal of the latter menace.</p>
<p>It met on the 21st day of November, in the old Cathedral of
Glasgow, one of the few ancient churches in Scotland which had
escaped the destroying zeal of the Reformers. Glasgow was then a
clean little city of some 12,000 inhabitants, clustered about its
college and cathedral above the shining links of the Molendinar
burn. The Assembly was a packed one, since the Tables, as appeared
during the proceedings, had exercised a rigorous veto over the
delegates. Of these there were some 240, 142 being ministers, and
98 laymen, ruling elders appointed by presbyteries. The Privy
Council attended, and there were numerous assessors. Hamilton had
striven to regulate the body by a proclamation&mdash;completely
disregarded&mdash;against the presence of retainers and the bearing
of arms. The nobles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id=
"Page_84">[84]</a></span> barons appeared each with his usual
"tail," and not a few of the clerical members had swords and
pistols, ostensibly to defend themselves on the journey against a
certain John Macgregor, a bandit who professed a distaste for the
Covenant and a liking for the king.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id=
"FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class=
"fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p>The crowd at the opening was so great that the town guard had
the utmost difficulty in opening a way for the members to their
seats. The Glasgow populace attended in great numbers, and their
behaviour in the kirk shocked the decorous soul of Mr. Robert
Baillie. "It is here alone where, I think, we might learn from
Canterbury, yea, from the Pope, from the Turks, or pagans, modesty
and manners. . . . Our rascals without shame, in great numbers,
made such dinn and clamour in the house of the true God, that if
they minted to use the like behaviour in my chamber, I could not be
content till they were down the stairs."<a name="FNanchor_96_96"
id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class=
"fnanchor">[96]</a> Hamilton sat uneasily on a high chair of state,
and below him the Lords of the Privy Council&mdash;conspicuous
among them the lean aquiline face and the red hair of Lorn, now, by
his father's death, Earl of Argyll, and a figure of interest to
every man, since he had not declared himself. In front of them was
a chair for the Moderator, and a table for the Clerk. Then came a
long bench at which were seated the nobles and barons elected by
the presbyteries, and at which sat Montrose as an elder,
representing his own presbytery of Auchterarder. At the end of the
church a platform had been erected for the eldest sons of peers,
and in tiers on both sides were the seats of the clerical and
burgess members. The "rascal multitude," including many women,
occupied the aisles and galleries. It was a strange form of
ecclesiastical assembly, for among the black gowns of the ministers
were the slashed and laced doublets of the laity, and the gleam of
many swords.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id=
"FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a></p>
<p>Alexander Henderson was unanimously elected Moderator, and
Wariston, Clerk. The firs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85"
id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>t step was to verify the commissions of
the members, and Hamilton found cause to question the legality of
many. His objection to the presence of laymen was without
substance, as their admission was in accordance with the letter and
spirit of Presbyterianism. With better reason he protested against
the method of electing these laymen, and the way in which the
Tables had supervised the appointments. A test case was that of
Lord Carnegie, Montrose's brother-in-law, who had been nominated by
the presbytery of Brechin, but disallowed by the Tables, and
Erskine of Dun named in his stead. Montrose had been the chief
mover in the matter, and, when Wariston inadvertently read the
letter of the Tables, Hamilton seized upon the irregularity.
Montrose hotly defended it, and thereby came into conflict not only
with Southesk, his father-in-law, but with Mr. David Dickson, who
questioned his action. The young man was in a high temper, and in
the cause he had chosen was prepared to respect neither kinsman nor
cleric.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p>The Assembly waved aside the royal commissioner's doubts as to
its competence and constitution, and proceeded to the business at
the back of every member's head&mdash;the abolition of episcopacy.
The bishops had refused to acknowledge the court or to appear
before it, and, when their formal declinature had been handed in,
Hamilton decided to dissolve the Assembly. On the morning of 28th
November, after recapitulating the king's concessions, he declared
the Assembly illegal owing to the method of its election, and
"discharged their further proceedings under pain of treason." He
was answered in moderate language by Rothes and Henderson, but the
latter refused to accept the dissolution. "All that are here know
the reasons of the meeting of this Assembly, and, albeit we have
acknowledged the power of Christian kings for convening of
Assemblies, yet that may not derogate from Christ's right; for He
has given divine warrants to convoke Assemblies whether magistrates
consent or not." Then arose Mr. David Dickson, who said, looking
towards Hamilton, "that that nobleman was very much to
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id=
"Page_86">[86]</a></span> commended for his zeal and faithfulness
to his master the king, and sticking close by what he thought for
his credit and interest; and he craved leave to propose his example
for the Assembly's imitation. They had a better master, Christ the
King of Kings, to serve, and his credit and honour to look after
according to their commission and trust; and therefore he moved
that, having this in their eye, they might sit still and do their
Master's work faithfully."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id=
"FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class=
"fnanchor">[99]</a> In this high mood the Assembly saw Hamilton
depart. It was a moment which von Ranke has compared to that scene
a century and a half later, when the new French National Assembly
for the first time withstood the commands of its king.<a name=
"FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p>Before leaving for the south, Hamilton summoned the members of
the Privy Council together and counselled them to do their duty by
the king. One or two withdrew, declaring that they were on the
popular side, and among them was Argyll, who, the day before, when
Hamilton dissolved the Assembly, had defended the legality of the
lay element and announced his adhesion to the Covenanting
cause.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Hamilton wrote to
Charles and to Laud announcing the failure of his mission, and
urging the necessity of speeding on the armed preparations. In his
letter to the king of 27th November he provided his master with
certain character-studies of the Scots nobility. Two of his
comments are worth noting: Argyll "will prove the dangerousest man
in this state"; of the Covenanting leaders there was "none more
vainly foolish than Montrose."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id=
"FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
<p>The Assembly resumed its sittings on the 29th, with Argyll as
the solitary Privy Councillor. It sat till 20th December, and, says
Burnet, "went on at a great rate, now that there were none to curb
them." It pronounced the last six General Assemblies invalid;
condemned the service book, the book of canons, and the Court of
High Commission; annulled the Articles of Perth; declared
episcopacy to be utterly abjured and cast out of the<span class=

established a press censorship, under the control of Wariston; and,
in a mood of startling enlightenment, prohibited salmon-fishing on

<p>The whole Scottish hierarchy was deposed, and most of its
members excommunicated as well. The bishops had declined to appear,
so there was no defence; the Aberdeen doctors were not there to
raise their voices, which Baillie thought might have induced a more
moderate temper. Undoubtedly there had been much laxness of conduct
on the part of the bishops, and certain scandals; but many of the
charges were absurd, and few were supported by evidence which would
have satisfied a court of law. The fact of holding episcopal office
was held sufficient to afford presumptive proof of moral
delinquencies. Episcopacy and its ministrants were abolished root
and branch, and certain dubious historical dogmas were affirmed,
against which Baillie, to his honour, protested.<a name=
"FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> He had been
impressed by Hamilton's conduct in the commissioner's chair, and
had wept at his withdrawal; he may be taken as the type of the
moderate Covenanter, who was against episcopacy as a system, but
did not think it necessarily forbidden by the reformed faith. But
the ministerial leaders, with the support of the lay members, would
be content with no half-hearted condemnation. On the day when the
prelates were sentenced, Henderson preached the sermon, long known
as "The Bishops' Doom"; but the passage of Scripture selected by
the reader may have had an ominous ring in other ears than Mr.
Robert Baillie's. "These things I have spoken to you that you
should not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogue;
yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he
doeth God service."</p>
<p>The Assembly had clearly gone beyond its legal powers. When the
king's commissioner dissolved it, under the Act of 1582, it ceased
to exist at law. Henderson's act had all the significance which von
Ranke has claimed for it; in the words of his most
recen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id=
"Page_88">[88]</a></span>t biographer, it "spelt
revolution."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id=
"FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a> The Assembly claimed to repeal the laws of the
land, and it proceeded to carry its edicts into action. The
treatment of the bishops was as harsh as it was irregular, but
revolutions are not considerate of individual rights. Our judgment
of its doings must be based upon the assumption that it was a
definite revolt against the king's authority. It sought, indeed, to
be a modified revolution. A treasonable sermon by Mr. George
Gillespie was condemned by implication by the Moderator; Argyll
warned them, and Henderson repeated his warning, against any
disrespect to "so good and gracious a prince"; and at the end an
address was drawn up to his Majesty, humbly asking him to confirm
their acts in the Parliament presently to be summoned. But a
revolution is a hard thing to delimit, and it has a fatal habit of
producing a reaction in kind. The doings of 1638 were exactly
paralleled by the Act Rescissory of 1661, which blotted out
twenty-three years of legislation and re-established episcopacy.
One form of violence was to be matched by another.</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"The Gods alone<br>

Remorselessly, and ever like for like.<br>

<br>
<p>Yet to judge the protagonists at Glasgow with the cold-blooded
retrospective reason of history is to do grave injustice. The
implications of their actions were not present to the minds of the
best of the clergy and laity. These revolutionaries were still
royalists almost to a man. They opposed, not the monarchy, but the
dogma of "no bishop, no king," which would impair the royal
authority by making it dependent upon a particular ecclesiastical
form. Their mark was Laud rather than Charles. Among them were many
fanatics of Presbytery, but there were also those who were lukewarm
enough towards Presbyterian claims, but enthusiastic for Scottish
liberties, and who consi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id=
"Page_89">[89]</a></span>dered that the people should have the
church they wanted. Such men had a well-founded distrust of an
episcopate as the gate by which autocracy had often entered the
sheepfold. It is to be remembered that few Scots believed in divine
right, that the nation had never known an unquestioned monarchy
like that of the Tudors in England, and that they had been in the
habit of frequently taking up arms to read their kings a lesson.
While professing in all honesty their love for Charles, they were
prepared to chasten him. They demanded that the nation's liberties
should be safeguarded, and the proof of that would be the grant of
the Kirk the nation preferred. On such a policy it was possible to
unite for the moment the gross and wary sagacity of Rothes, the
young enthusiasm of Montrose, and the profound and subtle ambition
of the latest convert, Argyll.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>To one who studies such portraits as exist of the chief figures
in the Scotland of that epoch, there must come a sense of
disappointment. Few convey the impression of power which is found
among the Puritans and Cavaliers of England. There is Hamilton,
self-conscious, arrogant, and puzzled; Lanark, his brother, dark,
sullen, and stupid; Huntly, a peacock head surmounting a splendid
body; Rothes, heavy-chinned, goggle-eyed, Pickwickian; Glencairn,
weak and rustical; old Leven, the eternal bourgeois; the Border
earls, but one remove from the Border prickers; Wariston, obstinate
and crack-brained; James Guthrie, lean and fanatical. But there are
three exceptions. One is the haunting face of Montrose, whose calm
eyes do not change from the Jameson portrait of his boyhood to the
great Honthorst of his prime. The second is the face of Alexander
Henderson, yellow from the fevers of the Leuchars marshes, lined
with thought, and burning with a steady fire. The third is that of
Archibald, eighth Earl of Argyll. We see him at nineteen, in his
marriage clothes, his reddish hair falling over his collar,
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id=
"Page_90">[90]</a></span> grey-blue eyes with ever so slight a cast
in them; we see him in his twenty-fourth year, with the air and
accoutrements of a soldier; in the Castle Campbell portrait,
unfortunately burned in the Inveraray castle fire of 1877, he is in
armour, but the face has a scholar's pallor and a curious
melancholy; in the familiar Newbattle picture, painted in his late
forties, he is in sober black with the skull-cap of a divine on his
head, the features are drawn with ill-health and care, the mouth is
compressed and secret, the nose is pendulous, and the cast in the
eyes has become almost a deformity. But at whatever period we take
it, it is a face of power, with intellect in the broad brow, and
resolution in the tight lips and heavy chin.<a name=

<br>
<p>In every national crisis there is some personal antagonism,
where the warring creeds seem to be summed up in the persons of two
protagonists&mdash;C&aelig;sar and Pompey, Pym and Strafford, Fox and
Pitt. So were to stand those present allies, Montrose and Argyll,
secular types of conflicting temperaments and irreconcilable views.
The head of the great house of Campbell was now some thirty-four or
thirty-five years of age, eight years the senior of Montrose. He
had the widest possessions of any Highland chief except Huntly, and
at his back by far the most powerful clan, for he lived close to
the Lowlands, and could put 5,000 men into the field. His father,
to whom the sobriquet of Gilleasbuig Gruamach&mdash;"Gillespie the
Sullen"&mdash;properly belonged,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id=
"FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> was an odd character and led an odd life. He
was defeated at Glenrinnes in 1594 by the Gordons, but later added
to his possessions by subduing the Macdonalds of Islay and Kintyre.
But his fortune was not commensurate with his lands, he fell deeply
into debt, married a Catholic second wife, joined the Church of
Rome, and had to flee the country. He was permitted to return, and
lived some ten years in England before his death. His first wife
was a daughter of the house of Morton, so his son had in his veins
the unaccoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id=
"Page_91">[91]</a></span>table Douglas blood. Like the father, the
son had an unhappy childhood, for he lost his mother in his
infancy, and during his youth was perpetually at variance with his
wandering sire. He had to fight hard during his minority for his
rights, and the experience must have made him wary and distrustful,
and taught him diplomacy and dissimulation. Charles is said to have
assisted him against his vindictive parent, and Clarendon reports
some dubious gossip about the old man warning the king against his
son, "for he is a man of craft, subtlety, and falsehood, and can
love no man, and if ever he finds it in his power to do you a
mischief, he will be sure to do it."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id=
"FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p>What is clear is that in his youth he was deeply in debt, and
found his great estates less of a boon than an incumbrance. He
determined to husband and increase his fortune, and there is record
of a curious venture to annex an imaginary island beyond the
Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id=
"FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class=
"fnanchor">[109]</a> He took his part in policing the Highlands,
and in 1636 brought to justice the outlaw Patrick Macgregor, who is
famous in balladry as Gilderoy. With high politics he did not
meddle. He defended the laird of Earlston against the Bishop of
Galloway, and befriended Samuel Rutherford when brought before the
Court of High Commission, but his motive may well have been only
friendship to his kinsfolk, the Kenmures. These incidents did not
predispose him to love the bishops, and in 1637 he convened a
meeting of Rothes, Traquair, and other noblemen, to protest against
the "pride and avarice of the prelates seeking to overrule the
haill kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id=
"FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a> But up to 1638 we may regard him as
principally occupied with family troubles and the care of his
estates, a little suspect by Presbytery as the son of a Catholic
and the brother-in-law of Huntly, well regarded by the king in
spite of his father's warnings, and with no special predilection
towards the Kirk. He was one of the few nobles who, in the summer
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">[92]</a></span> 1638, took the king's alternative
covenant at the request of Hamilton.</p>
<p>In this mood he attended the Glasgow Assembly. There it would
appear that he underwent a profound spiritual experience, and in
the theological sense was "converted." It was the habit of
Alexander Henderson during the sittings to hold meetings at night
for prayer and counsel. "I find," says Wodrow, who must have been
repeating a tradition handed down in the ministry, "that their
meetings were remarkably countenanced of God, and that the Marquis
of Argyll, and several others who sometimes joined in them, dated
their conversion, or a knowledge of it, from those times."<a name=
"FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It was this change
of heart, and not the discovery that the Covenant was the side of
the majority, that determined Argyll's course. He was an acute
judge of popular opinion, but it was something more than policy
that took him over to the Covenant side. For from that day this
man, who in the past had been wholly concerned with his worldly
possessions, and had held himself conspicuously aloof from the
Kirk, became a religious enthusiast, a fanatic; and no mortal,
however consummate an actor, could simulate such enthusiasm as
Argyll revealed during the remainder of his troubled life.<a name=
"FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
<p>In assessing his character we have therefore to start from the
fact that in religious matters he was most deeply in earnest, that
he had the same proselytizing zeal, and the same complete assurance
that the armies of Heaven were on his side, as Wariston and James
Guthrie. To this add his Campbell and Douglas ancestry. He had the
chief's love of power, and it is possible that, as in Hamilton's
case, visions of a crown may have haunted one who boasted that he
was the "eighth man from Robert Bruce." Such dreams were common
among the higher Scots nobility. His bitter youth had left him
suspicious and aloof, without<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> warmth, with few friends and
fewer intimates. He could not charm easily; he must win his way by
patience, assiduity, and talent; but he learned in time a grace of
manner to which even the hostile Clarendon bears witness. He was,
so far as can be judged, without any interest in humane letters;
his mind was medi&aelig;val in its cast, holding firm by law and
scholastic divinity. Hence it is vain to look to him for any
profound ideal of statecraft. He was essentially a politician, a
shrewd judge of character and opinion, able to use both the raw
material of fanaticism in the ministers and of gross self-interest
in the nobles to further his ends, because he shared the one and
wholly understood the other. There was no quicker brain in Britain
to probe the possibilities of a situation. Mr. Gardiner thinks him
as much superior to Montrose as a statesman as he was inferior in
the art of war;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id=
"FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a> and Clarendon, after remarking that Montrose
despised him, "as he was too apt to contemn those he did not love,"
adds that Argyll "wanted nothing but honesty and courage to be a
very extraordinary man, having all other good talents in a great
degree."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id=
"FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
<p>Honesty and courage are difficult matters upon which to
dogmatize. Argyll was a poor soldier, because he lacked the power
of grasping a tactical or strategical problem&mdash;a gift as
specialized as that for poetry or the higher mathematics&mdash;and
because he had not the kind of personality which can impress itself
upon large bodies of men under arms. But it is idle to deny
courage, even of the rude physical kind, to a man who time and
again risked his neck, who was prepared to meet an enemy in a duel,
and who went without a tremor to the scaffold. As for honesty,
there is little enough of the high and delicate kind at any time in
the political game, and, if we define it as scrupulous loyalty to
cause and colleague, it was a fruit which scarcely grew in
seventeenth-century Scotland. In that mad kaleidoscope Argyll had
as much of the rare commodity as most of his contemporaries. His
troubles came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id=
"Page_94">[94]</a></span> primarily from a divided soul&mdash;a
clear, practical intellect pulling against an obscurantist creed,
the Highland chief at variance with the Presbyterian statesman, a
brain, medi&aelig;val for all its powers, fumbling with the
half-understood problems of a new world. With such a one subtlety
will appear as irresolution, perplexity as cowardice, and a too
quick mind will seem to argue a dishonest heart.</p>
<p>Such a man will be a power among fanatics and self-seekers, for
he can read the souls of both. But there will be one chink in his
armour. He will not comprehend so readily other motives, and, in
failing to understand, he will miscalculate and undervalue.
Single-heartedness will not come within the scope of his capacious
understanding. Sooner or later Argyll was bound to find in Montrose
his stark opposite, by whom he was both puzzled and
repelled&mdash;one who, in the common sense of the word, had no
personal ambition, who was a civic enthusiast as Wariston and
Guthrie were religious enthusiasts, and who would force the appeal
to that which Argyll hated and feared&mdash;the sword.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1638-39</i></div>
<p>Charles had much ado to raise that army which for the past nine
months he had regarded as his ultimate argument. England was
apathetic, and a growing proportion of her people looked askance at
episcopacy. There had been no Parliament for ten years, so there
were scanty supplies. The train-bands were called out, and the
nobles were summoned to perform their feudal duties, but the first
were half-hearted and ill-equipped, and the second was at the best
a patchy volunteer service. On paper the king had some 21,000
men&mdash;14,000 foot and 2,000 horse, and about 5,000 under
Hamilton. The cavalry was under Lord Holland, and the infantry
under the Catholic Lord Arundel, neither of whom had much military
experience. The plan was an advance to the Border by the main
forces, while Hamilton should join hands with Huntly in the
north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id=
"Page_95">[95]</a></span> and threaten the Covenanters' rear.
Meantime it was hoped that Antrim, with his Irish, would land in
Argyll, and Strafford in the Firth of Clyde. Unless the mere threat
of an advance brought the Scots to terms, there was little hope in
the scheme, for the main army was too weak for an invasion of
Scotland, an Irish landing was improbable, and the exchequer was
too low to permit of a waiting campaign. With the king went many
distinguished figures: Sir Edmund Verney, already in two minds
about the merits of the cause; Falkland, whose departure was
attended by eulogistic poems from Cowley and Waller; Sir John
Suckling, who from his own purse equipped a troop of horse clad in
white and scarlet which, by the testimony of his own pasquil, had
no stomach for a fight.</p>
<p>The Scots were in a better case. The provident Tables had
already created a war-chest by voluntary assessments; their cause
was supported by a widespread popular enthusiasm; the troops they
could raise were of a more martial stamp than the unwilling English
levies, and they had commanders of far higher talent than Holland
and Arundel. For, in Spalding's words, "there came out of Germany
hame to Scotland ane gentleman of base birth born in Balveny, who
had served long and fortunately in the German wars, and called to
his name Felt Marshall Leslie, His Excellence."<a name=
"FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Alexander Leslie,
now a man of fifty-seven, had risen high in the service of
Gustavus, and at Stralsund had been a match for Wallenstein
himself. So great was his professional repute that he was given at
once the unquestioned control of the Covenant forces. "We were
feared," Baillie wrote, "that emulation among our nobles might have
done harm, . . . but such was the wisdom and authority of the old,
little, crooked soldier, that all, with ane incredible submission,
from the beginning to the end, gave over themselves to be guided by
him, as if he had been Great Solyman."<a name="FNanchor_116_116"
id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class=
"fnanchor">[116]</a> With Leslie had come over many Scottish
mercenaries of the Dugald Dalgetty type, who, finding their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id=
"Page_96">[96]</a></span>occupation gone on the Continent, welcomed
the chance of turning an honest penny in their native land. Such
men, as a rule, cared as little about prayer-books and General
Assemblies as they cared for the international quibbles of a German
princeling, but they were to provide the Covenant with that which
it sorely needed and which England as yet did not possess&mdash;a
body of experienced and cool-headed professional officers.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1639</i></div>
<p>The Tables were no laggards in war. Edinburgh castle, which
Hamilton had bought from Mar, was surprised and taken; Dumbarton
and Dalkeith followed, and soon in the south of Scotland only the
castle of Caerlaverock remained hostile. The three Lowland noblemen
who were still nominally on the king's side&mdash;Traquair,
Roxburgh, and Douglas&mdash;could do nothing in Clydesdale and
Tweeddale. Argyll was given the wardenship of the west, and
presently, by his seizure of Hamilton's castle of Brodick and his
garrisoning of Kintyre, closed the door by which Antrim and
Strafford might have entered, while, with the unexpected assistance
of the Camerons, he ravaged Huntly's Badenoch domains. The
immediate danger lay in Aberdeen, for Charles's march from the
south would be slow. Should Hamilton's 5,000 sail north and join
Huntly&mdash;now appointed royal lieutenant over all the country
between the North Esk and Caithness&mdash;the Covenant would have
to fight with a conflagration in its rear. Montrose was appointed
to deal with the situation, and Leslie, whose formal commission as
commander-in-chief was not issued till May 9, 1639,<a name=
"FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> was sent with him to
correct the inexperience of this general of twenty-seven.</p>
<p>In January 1639 and the beginning of February Montrose was busy
beating up recruits in his own braes of Angus, where he had high
words with Southesk, his father-in-law, who had not forgotten the
dispute at the Glasgow Assembly, and, in a sudden fit of royalism,
refused the warrant of the Tables.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id=
"FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a> He had summoned the northern
Covenanters&mdash;the Frasers, Keiths, Crichtons, and
Forbeses&mdash;to meet him at the little town of<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> Turriff in
Aberdeenshire. Huntly heard of the rendezvous, and, resolved to
prevent it, marched thither with 2,000 of his clansmen. But
Montrose was to give the first proof of his speed. Getting word of
Huntly's intention, he rode through the Grampian passes with 200
horsemen, and was joined at Turriff by 800 men. Huntly, when he
arrived, found the churchyard walls lined with muskets, and
Montrose and his friends ensconced in the church. He had much the
larger force, but he had been forbidden to fight without Hamilton's
instructions, so he could only "glare at" his enemies and withdraw
to Strathbogie.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id=
"FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> His orders were not to take the offensive till
the king had reached the Border.</p>
<p>But he could fortify Aberdeen, and this it was Montrose's
business to prevent. Presently Leslie arrived with the rest of the
army, and, with a force of from 3,000 to 4,000 men, Montrose
advanced on the city. Huntly, with instructions at all costs to win
time, tried to make an arrangement with Montrose, but the latter
had his clear instructions from the Tables, and on 30th March he
entered Aberdeen. Ever in love with the spectacular side of life,
he found a rival colour for the royal scarlet which the young
Gordons wore, and decorated his men with knots of blue ribbon. It
is curious to note that the Covenant received its famous blue badge
from the man who was to prove its chief opponent. The city,
deserted by Huntly, had no power of resistance. The Aberdeen
doctors fled by sea, and some of the more martial citizens departed
to join the king, while the Covenanting chaplains improved the
occasion by pointing out in their discourses that upon Aberdeen had
fallen the curse of Meroz. Montrose imposed on the city a fine for
recusancy, and appointed Kinghorn to the command, while he rode
west to look for Huntly.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id=
"FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id=
"Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<p>Now follows a curious tale on which it is hard to form an
opinion. Various intermediaries had been busy, and in the first
week of April Huntly met Montrose in the latter's camp at
Inverurie. Huntly signed a modified version of the Covenant,
binding himself "to maintain the King's authority, together with
the liberties both of Church and State, Religion and
Laws"&mdash;probably a version dictated by Montrose himself, whose
principles it exactly represented. The Gordons would be allowed to
sign the Covenant if they pleased, and the Catholic members of the
clan were to be protected so long as they stood by the laws and
liberties of Scotland. When Huntly came again to Inverurie, he
found the camp full of his hereditary enemies, Frasers, Forbeses,
and Crichtons, and sent his friend Gordon of Straloch to Montrose
to warn him that any attempt to carry him south as prisoner would
be hotly resented by the countryside. Montrose, in reply, declared
that he would stand by Huntly&mdash;"but there is this difficulty,
that business here is all transacted by vote and a committee, nor
can I get anything done of myself."</p>
<p>Montrose returned to Aberdeen, where he was joined by other of
the Covenanting nobles. A council was held, and the general was
severely chidden for his leniency towards Huntly. Apparently his
command in the field did not carry any superior authority at the
council board, for Huntly was promptly summoned to attend under a
safe conduct, for which Montrose made himself specially
responsible. The latter had promised more than he could perform,
and the chief of the Gordons found himself in a trap. He was asked
to pay certain expenses, bring in certain prisoners, become
reconciled to Crichton of Frendraught, and naturally refused. He
was then told that he must accompany the Covenanting lords to
Edinburgh. He asked if he was to go as a prisoner or as a free man.
Montrose bade him take his choice, and the marquis replied that he
would go as a volunteer. This is the account of Spalding, who makes

business; Gordon of Rothiemay, who had reason to know, since he was

"#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Huntly and his heir,
Lord Gordon, were carried to Edinburgh, and his suspicions proved
only too well founded. He refused to subscribe any other covenant
than that which he had taken at Inverurie, and he and his son were
consigned to Edinburgh castle. According to his fashion, he
signalized the event by a piece of noble declamation. "Whereas you
offer me liberty, I am not so bad a merchant as to buy it with the
loss of my conscience, fidelity, and honour. I have already given
my faith to my Prince, upon whom now this crown by all laws of
nature and nations is justly fallen. . . . I am in your power, and
resolved not to leave that foul title of traitor as an inheritance
upon my posterity. You may take my head from my shoulders, but not

<p>It is the judgment of Mr. Gardiner that in all this affair
Montrose "played but a mean and shabby part," that it was "the only
mean action of his life." But the thing is too intricate for such a
summary judgment. Montrose was clearly, in matters of policy, only
one vote among many, and, moreover, he was in all major matters
subordinate to Leslie.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id=
"FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a> Huntly's treatment was probably by Leslie's
order, whether or not he was present at the final meeting in
Aberdeen, and it is significant that in England it was attributed
to him.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id=
"FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a> Moreover, it is by no means clear that Huntly,
in spite of his rhetoric, was an unwilling captive. Why did he open
negotiations with Montrose? Why did he sign a covenant at
Inverurie? He did not want a Covenant army ravaging his lands,
while he waited for instruct<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>ions from Hamilton which
never came. What honour was there in being the royal lieutenant
when he was under a superior officer who sent neither troops nor
commands? He was in an impossible position, and may have welcomed a
simple way out of it; otherwise, knowing how many of the foes of
his house were assembled at Aberdeen, he would scarcely have put
his head into the lion's mouth. It is to be noted that he was no
sooner safe in Edinburgh castle than Charles wrote to Hamilton
describing him as "feeble and false."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id=
"FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class=
"fnanchor">[126]</a> It is only on some such supposition that we
can explain Montrose's conduct. Had the facts been as Spalding
relates them, one so scrupulous of the point of honour would
assuredly have laid down his commission. Lord Gordon shared
Huntly's captivity, and he was soon to be Montrose's closest
friend; it is hard to believe that a flagrant wrong done to the
father could so soon have been forgotten by the son. But it is
certain that Huntly himself was aggrieved, and never forgave
Montrose; it may be because Montrose was a witness of his weakness
and humiliation. "He could never be gained to join cordially with
him, nor to swallow that indignity, . . . whence it came to pass
that such as were equally enemies to both . . . in the end
prevailed so far as to ruinate and destroy both of them, and the
king by a consequent."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id=

<p>On the day that Montrose reached Aberdeen Charles entered York.
On 7th April he issued a proclamation to his rebellious subjects in
Scotland, inviting them to come in and be punished. It was a
blunder which he repaired by a later proclamation of 7th May, in
which he announced that he would give his people all just
satisfaction in Parliament as soon as the present troubles
subsided, that he would not permit the Scots to invade England, but
that he did not propose to invade Scotland, "if all civil and
temporal obedience was shown him." This last clause seemed to open
a way to negotiation. But Leslie, on whose head a p<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>rice of
&pound;500 had been set,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id=
"FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> took no risks; he mustered his army on the
links of Leith, and before the end of the month was encamped at
Dunglass, on his way to the Border. Meantime, on May Day, Hamilton
had arrived in the Forth with nineteen ships of war and 5,000 men,
to find the approaches to Edinburgh strongly fortified, and both
shores of the firth in arms. His mother, the terrible old
dowager-countess, arrived from the west with pistols in her
holsters and the resolve to shoot her son if he set foot on
Scottish soil. The king's commissioner proved as futile in war as
in diplomacy. He contented himself with landing his men on the
islands of the firth, paying secret visits to Covenanting lords,
and writing melancholy letters to his master.</p>
<p>But up in the north the Gordons and certain local
barons&mdash;Ogilvies, Urquharts, and Setons&mdash;had taken
matters into their own hands. In a one-sided engagement, called the
Trot of Turriff, they drove out a small Covenanting garrison under
the Master of Forbes, and marched on Aberdeen, which they occupied
on the 15th of May. Meantime Huntly's second son, Lord Aboyne, had
made his way to Charles at Newcastle, and had offered his sword to
the royal side. He was sent back to Hamilton for troops, but
Hamilton gave him nothing but a few field-pieces and the services
of a certain Colonel Gun, who had fought in the German wars. There
was a chance now for a real diversion, but Hamilton did not take
it; he sent two of his three regiments to the king, and himself
remained snugly in the Forth.</p>
<p>Montrose was in Edinburgh on 18th May when he got word of the
doings in the north. Hastily collecting a force of some 4,000, he
reached Aberdeen on the 25th, to find that the barons had marched
westward to get Highland support, and that the young Earl Marischal
had occupied the city. Some of his colleagues pressed him to make
an example of the place, but he summarily declined.<a name=
"FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The next day was
Sunday, and while the officers were in church the soldiers made
short work <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id=
"Page_102">[102]</a></span>of any dog that had been decked in scorn
with the blue ribbon of the Covenant. They also came to blows with
the fisher-folk over sundry essays in salmon-poaching, forgetful of
the sound resolution of the Glasgow Assembly.<a name=
"FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But beyond a fine of
10,000 merks levied by the visitors, Aberdeen suffered little.</p>
<p>On the 30th of May Montrose marched into the Gordon country and
laid siege to the castle of Gight. But two days later he had news
which changed his plans. He heard that Aboyne, with a large force,
was on the sea, and he assumed that Hamilton was with him. At all
costs he must keep his communications open, so after a day's rest
in Aberdeen he hastened south. On the 5th of June Aboyne arrived,
with Tullibardine and Glencairn, two field-pieces, and Colonel Gun.
His brother, Lord Lewis Gordon, who had attained the mature age of
thirteen,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id=
"FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a> rode into the city with 1,000 of his clan, and
so aroused the spirit of the burghers that by the 14th of June
Aboyne had 4,000 men at his back.</p>
<p>Montrose had joined Marischal,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id=
"FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class=
"fnanchor">[132]</a> the head of the house of Keith, at Stonehaven,
and when word came of Aboyne's landing, he went north to meet him.
Aboyne's following showed the inclination, common to all Highland
levies, to melt mysteriously away, but he had 600 Gordon cavalry,
and he had the citizen forces of the twice-captured Aberdeen, who
could expect little mercy if the war went against them. He had a
strong position, for the Dee was in flood, and the narrow bridge
might be held by resolute men against great odds. Had all the
officers been of the stamp of Colonel Johnston, the provost's son
and a professional soldier, it would have gone ill with Montrose.
The muskets at the bridge-head bit fiercely into the Covenant
ranks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103">[103]</a></span> the spirit of the townspeople was high,
and the fighting of the first day, 18th June, left the defences
intact. But in the night Montrose brought up his heavier cannon
from Dunnottar, and at daybreak feinted with his cavalry, sending
them upstream towards an impossible ford. Gun fell into the trap,
and drew off the Gordon horse to follow them, and in their absence
the Covenanters made a general attack. Gun, having made nothing of
his ride, fell into a panic, which communicated itself to the rest.
The Gordons fled, with the unwilling Aboyne, to their own country,
and the citizens, deprived of their allies, broke at last.</p>
<p>So ended Montrose's first serious essay at command in the field.
Marischal and others of his colleagues would have burned and
pillaged the city, but Montrose pled for a respite,<a name=
"FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and, fortunately for
Aberdeen, events had taken place in the south which made the truce
a peace. While Leslie was at Dunglass, the king sent scouting
parties across the Border, so the Scots moved to Duns Law, a strong
strategic position. That remarkable camp, where good provender was
abundant, and the sound of prayer and psalm rose morning and
evening, and at each captain's tent-door flew a banner with the
legend "For Christ's Crown and Covenant," and the Lowland peasants
stared, open-mouthed, at Argyll's plaided and kilted Highlanders,
may be read of in the vivid pages of Baillie.<a name=
"FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The spirit of the
troops, says that chronicler, was "sweet, meek, humble, yet strong
and vehement." The same could not have been said of the royal army,
which was ill-fed, ill-paid, ill-guided, and sorely troubled by a
species of vermin which they called "Covenanters." Both sides had
their doubts and troubles, and the time was ripe for negotiation,
since Charles could not defeat Leslie, and Leslie at the moment did
not desire to defeat Charles. A conference was arranged, and
ultimately Charles assented to the principle that General
Assemblies should deal with ecclesiastical questions and Parliament
with civi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id=
"Page_104">[104]</a></span>l, and that a free General Assembly and
a free Parliament should be convened for the coming August. The
king made a good impression upon the sensitive Baillie, who had
been impressed by Hamilton the previous November; he thought him
"one of the most just, reasonable, sweet persons they had ever
seen." On this understanding it was agreed to disband both armies,
and the Covenanters seem to have been so strangely confident that
they had found a lasting basis of peace, that they prepared to send
Leslie with a Scottish army to the help of the Elector Palatine.
Yet the main point was evaded. The Covenanters held by the findings
of the Glasgow Assembly, with its abolition of episcopacy and its
excommunication of the bishops; the king might consent to a free
General Assembly, but he would never consent to its decrees if, as
it was certain to do, it reaffirmed the doings at Glasgow.<a name=

"#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
<p>That hollow treaty, variously called the Pacification of Berwick
and the Pacification of Birks, was signed on the 18th of June.
Montrose, when the news of it arrived, imposed a further fine upon
Aberdeen, released his prisoners, and dismissed his men to their
homes. A few days later he himself left with Marischal&mdash;"to
post to Duns," says Baillie, "to have their part in the joy, as
well they did deserve, in the common peace; where they were made
most welcome both to their comrades and their king."<a name=

battle and proved his gift for war; but as he journeyed southward
he can have had little of the joy of victory in his heart. The
affair with Huntly, and his experience of the medi&aelig;val temper of
Huntly's enemies, must have taught him how remote was his point of
view from that of the colleagues whom fate had given him. He was no
professional soldier like Leslie, but a perplexed and patriotic
statesman, and by now he must have begun to realize how precarious
was the future of the loyalty and the liberty which were the twin
principles of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id=

and noble youth," whose discretion was too great. There were soon
to be harsher words used about that discretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1639</i></div>
<p>The hollowness of the settlement between king and Covenant was
soon to be revealed. On 1st July proclamation of the coming
Assembly was made in Edinburgh, and to the consternation of the
people the prelates were summoned to attend. Legally, Charles was
in the right; if the hierarchy was formally to be abolished, it had
the right to be present and to defend itself; but to the
Covenanters it seemed to prove that the king had not accepted the
policy of the Glasgow Assembly, and was determined to find some way
of perpetuating the episcopate. In this the popular instinct was
partly correct. Charles, with England in view, was not prepared to
assent to the wholesale condemnation of episcopal principles which
the majority in Scotland desired.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id=
"FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class=
"fnanchor">[137]</a> But if the king was unwilling to abide by the
understanding of the treaty which he must have known was in the
mind of the Covenant leaders, these leaders had already broken its
letter. They did not dissolve the Tables, or disband the army, or
dispense with Leslie, or return the stores a<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>nd
ordnance to Edinburgh castle, which was now in Ruthven's hands.
Riots broke out in the Edinburgh streets on 3rd July, and Traquair,
Kinnoull, and Aboyne were roughly handled by the mob. Loudoun was
sent to Berwick to apologize, but the king, not unnaturally,
demanded more&mdash;the presence of fourteen of the Covenant
leaders to discuss the situation. Some of them, like Argyll,
refused; others were forbidden by their colleagues to
attend;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id=
"FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class=
"fnanchor">[138]</a> five stalwarts only were permitted to
go&mdash;Montrose, Loudoun, Lothian, Rothes, and
Dunfermline&mdash;accompanied by Mr. Alexander Henderson, who had
not been bidden. The discussion was a fiasco. Rothes quarrelled
with the king, and warned him that, if bishops were not abolished
in Scotland, the Scots would join with the Puritans in attacking
them in England. Charles, deeply offended, gave up his intention of
attending the forthcoming Assembly in person, and on 3rd August
returned to London.</p>
<p>But this farcical conference had a profound effect on one man.
He who embarks on the tide of a popular revolution is carried
insensibly in a direction and at a speed which he has not foreseen,
and it demands a scrupulous moral and intellectual integrity to
keep true to his first purpose. Montrose had found himself in full
agreement with the National Covenant, but the boisterous flood
which now bore him along was very different from the even and
disciplined stream for which he had hoped. He had opposed churchmen
in politics, but the governance of Scotland was now slipping into
the hands of the Kirk; he had condemned the king's breaches of law
and constitution, but in this respect the Covenant looked as if it
would soon be as flagrant a sinner; on behalf of the commons of
Scotland he had fought the power of nobles like Hamilton and
Huntly, but there were others in his own faction with the same
ambitions. Above all, he had made a central and inviolable
sovereignty the foundation of his creed, and he saw this
sovereignty dissolving in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> confusion. To this period, when his
doubts first became insistent, we may perhaps assign these
verses:</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"Can little beasts with lions roar,<br>
&nbsp;And little birds with eagles soar?<br>
&nbsp;Can shallow streams command the seas,<br>
&nbsp;And little ants the humming bees?<br>
&nbsp;No, no&mdash;no, no&mdash;it is not meet<br>
&nbsp;The head should stoop unto the feet."</p>
<br>
<p>Already his path had begun to diverge ever so little from the
broad road of the Covenant. The divergence was slight, and to the
world he still seemed to be marching in its company, but the angle
must widen, for he was aiming at a different goal.</p>
<p>In those July days at Berwick Montrose had his first true
meeting with the king. Charles was no longer the formal and distant
monarch who, under Hamilton's influence, had received coldly his
boyish offer of service. He was a man in deep distress, who had
just been successfully defied by his subjects&mdash;a king without
an army or a war-chest, who had insults for his daily bread, and no
counsellor who was not a broken reed. That singular character is
one of the paradoxes, but not one of the enigmas, of history, for
its weakness and strength are abundantly plain. His mild but
immovable fanaticism, his lack of any quick sense of realities, his
love of wooden intrigues, his defect in candour, his inability to
read human nature, his incapacity to decide swiftly and act
boldly&mdash;they are as patent as his piety, his fortitude, and
his fidelity to what he held to be right. But he had in the highest
degree the charm of his race, and could cast a glamour over the
most diverse minds. It was those who knew him best who were most
under his spell, so that Clarendon could describe him as "the
worthiest gentleman, the best master, the best friend, the best
husband, the best father, and the best Christian," and Sir Philip
Warwick could write: "When I think of dying, it is one of my
comforts that, when I part from the dunghill of this world, I shall
meet King Charles."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id=
"FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class=
"fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<p>In Montrose, the sight of his king in straits which were not
kingly may have awakened a chivalrous loyalty to the person of his
sovereign. Moreover, since he was not cognizant of Charles's secret
dealings with Hamilton and Traquair, he must have considered that
the king had thus far kept his part of the bargain better than the
Covenanters, and had granted all that the National Covenant
demanded. Burnet will have it that he "was much wrought upon, and
gave His Majesty full assurance of his duty in time coming, and
upon that entered in a correspondence with the king,"<a name=
"FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> but this story of a
sudden conversion was probably Covenanting gossip of a later date,
when the breach had widened and it was necessary to find some easy
explanation.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id=
"FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> Montrose was still a Covenanter, and resolute
to complete the work which had been begun on that spring morning in
Greyfriars the year before; but he had come to think somewhat less
well of his colleagues, and, after the meeting at Berwick, somewhat
better of his sovereign.</p>
<p>The General Assembly met in Edinburgh in the east kirk of St.
Giles on 12th August, with Traquair as the royal commissioner and
Mr. David Dickson of Irvine as Moderator. The previous Assembly at
Glasgow was not officially mentioned, but all its work was
re-enacted "at a gallop."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id=
"FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class=
"fnanchor">[142]</a> Episcopacy was abolished in Scotland, and the
terms used, in spite of Traquair's advice, were made as offensive
as possible to the king; episcopal government and the power of
churchmen were held not only "unlawful to this Kirk," but "contrary
to the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id=
"FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class=
"fnanchor">[143]</a> The <i>Large Declaration</i>, the statement of
the king's case, written by Dr. Balcanquhal, the Dean of Durham,
was condemned in violent language, and the Privy Council was prayed
to order that the National Covenant should be signed by every
dweller in Scotland, "of what rank or quality soever in time
coming." This piece of intolerant coercion was presented by a
committee, which had Montrose and Alexander Henderson among its
members,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id=
"FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a> and duly<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> embodied in an Act of
Council. Traquair, as royal commissioner, assented to the various
proceedings, and the session closed in an atmosphere of unwonted
peace. To old and staunch Presbyterians, who had fought for the
Kirk as Andrew Melville conceived it, it seemed that the day of
miracles had come, and a certain Mr. John Wemyss, an aged minister,
speaking with difficulty, "for tears trickling down along his grey
hairs, like drops of rain or dew upon the top of the tender grass,"
spoke a moving <i>nunc dimittis</i>. "I do remember when the Kirk
of Scotland had a beautiful face. I remember since there was a
great power and life accompanying the ordinances of God, and a
wonderful work of operation upon the hearts of the people. This my
eyes did see&mdash;a fearful defection after procured by our sins.
And no more did I wish before my eyes were closed but to have seen
such a beautiful day, and that under the conduct and favour of our
King's Majesty."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id=
"FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class=
"fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
<p>The Parliament, which met on 31st August, was a very different
gathering. A more momentous Parliament had never sat in Scotland,
for until it ratified the acts of the Assembly these had no legal
validity, and the Kirk had no security. The first difficulty that
arose was constitutional. One of the estates, the clergy, had
dissolved itself, since the bishops had fled the country. In
choosing the Lords of the Articles, it had been the custom for the
nobles to elect the representatives of the church, and the bishops
to elect the representatives of the nobles, while both together
chose the representatives of the lairds and burgesses, while the
king added eight nominees of his own. By means of the bishops the
Crown could in this way ensure a majority. Charles desired to fill
the vacancy left by the bishops by fourteen ministers chosen by the
Crown, or, in the alternative, by fourteen laymen;<a name=
"FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> but the ministers
suspected a trap, and the nobility were jealous of the ministers,
so this scheme fell to the ground. Under protest from Argyll a
temporary arrangement was come to. Traquair<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> himself
chose the nobles,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id=
"FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class=
"fnanchor">[147]</a> who in turn chose the lesser barons and
burgesses. This provisional Committee of the Articles set to work,
and its reach was long. It ratified the acts of the recent
Assembly, and proceeded to remodel the constitution of Scotland. It
whittled away the royal prerogative, by transferring the control of
the Mint and the appointment of great officers of state to
Parliament, and, by one vote, passed Argyll's motion that each
estate, nobles, barons, and burgesses, should elect its own
lords.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
<p>To this sudden essay in parliamentary government Montrose was
opposed, and there were many other doubters in the Covenant ranks.
It must be clearly understood that Argyll's proposal, for all its
modern sound, was not an early stirring of democratic ideals. The
common people of Scotland had no say in the government of the
country, and were to have none for many a year, except through the
General Assembly. It was a provision aimed directly against the
royal prerogative, and, considering the recent use made of that
prerogative, it had its justification. But such a change was not a
reassertion of ancient liberties, but a wholly new departure, and
so violent an innovation roused suspicion. The new r&eacute;gime would
throw the government of Scotland into the hands of him who was the
most adroit electioneer, and in this connection all men's thoughts
turned to Argyll. It altered, but it did not seriously liberalize,
the basis of representation. Moreover, it was a demand which struck
at the whole conception of monarchy as then existing. At one stroke
it reduced the king to a cypher in matters in which hitherto he had
been all-powerful. To Montrose it seemed to weaken sovereignty, the
central sanction of law, without putting a reasonable equivalent in
its place, for, if the king had his faults, a legislature of
factious lairds and nobles was not without them. Further, it had no
finality. If the king assented, he would be pressed to greater
concessions, and the foundations of<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> order would crumble. This
was also the doubt of Mr. Robert Baillie. "Whatever the Prince
grants, I fear we press more than he can grant; and when we are
fully satisfied, it is likely England will begin where we have left
off."</p>
<p>It was the turning-point of Montrose's political career. His
enthusiasm for the National Covenant had made him an active member
of the late Assembly, as an elder from Auchterarder, and he had
supported the compulsory signature of that Covenant&mdash;an
extreme step for one of his beliefs. At the moment he had no
quarrel with the Kirk. He was prepared to accept every act of the
Assembly, even its wholesale condemnation of episcopacy as hostile
to God's Word. Two months later, when the king summoned him to
London, he asked to be excused, after consulting with the Covenant
leaders, on the ground that at such a time his going to court would
be misconstrued&mdash;conduct which Wariston lauded as
"noble."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id=
"FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a> To the clerical side of the movement he was
still profoundly sympathetic. But the proposed constitutional
revolution made him pause, and presently sent him into opposition,
for of the two sections in his party he distrusted the nobles more
than the ministers. Six years later he put his position before his
countrymen. "Members of the said Parliament, some of them having
far designs unknown to us, others of them having found the
sweetness of government, were pleased to refuse the ratification of
the acts of Assembly with the abjuration of episcopacy and the
Court of High Commission introduced by the prelates, unless they
had the whole alleged liberty due to the subject; which was in fact
intrenching upon authority, and the total abrogation of his

<p>Traquair, who had been severely censured by Charles for his
conduct as commissioner to the Assembly, refused, on the king's
instructions, to accept the decisions of Parliament. The ostensible
ground, in which Montrose ingenuously believed, was the attack on
the prerogative; the true reason was the ratification of the
Assembly's abolition of episcopacy. With England in view, Charles
could scarcely be expected to assent to the condemnation of
episcopacy as "unlawful," though he might admit it to be contrary
to the constitution of the Kirk; he clung to his intention to
restore the bishops at some later date, and therefore would not
assent to the act rescinding the old acts which had established
them.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href=

"#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> On the part of
Charles it was a grave blunder, for the people of Scotland were not
slow to grasp the true explanation. He could have found some
support for the defence of the prerogative; he could even have
mustered to his side tender consciences like that of Mr. Robert
Baillie, who was not prepared to condemn episcopacy as in itself
unlawful;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id=
"FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a> with these points, if honestly stated, he
might have driven a wedge into the Covenant party. As it was, a
conviction that the king was playing fast and loose with them on
the main question of the episcopate, and dislike of the egregious
Traquair, rallied the doubters for the moment. Napier, the typical
moderate, sat on the committee which represented the prorogued
Parliament. As for Montrose, we have seen his refusal to go to
court in December, and we find him a signatory, along with Loudoun
and Leslie, of a letter addressed to the King of France,
representing to Louis the "candour and ingenuity" of the
Covenanters towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id=

<h2>II</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1640</i></div>
<p>With the abortive Parliament of 1639 went one of the last
embankments of the old r&eacute;gime, and henceforth the tide of
revolution runs fast. Parliament had been prorogued that the king
might muster his forces, and the Covenanters did not let the grass
grow under their feet in a similar duty. It was clear that the
Covenant could only be defended on the field of battle. Through the
early months of 1640 levies were being raised and drilled
throughout the Lowlands, and on 17th April Leslie was given his
commission as commander-in-chief.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id=
"FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class=
"fnanchor">[156]</a> In the same month Charles in England, in
desperation for supplies, summoned the Short Parliament, but no
supplies were forthcoming, and in three weeks he dissolved it. The
Covenanters were much heartened thereby, for it was plain that
England in the coming war was not behind the king. By the end of
the summer Leslie had under him some 22,000 foot and 3,000 horse,
and by freewill offerings, and offerings not so free, a
considerable war-chest had been created. Charles could only scrape
together less than half these numbers of ill-disciplined and
reluctant recruits, and after trying every device, legal and
illegal, he was still lamentably short of money. Strafford had come
over from Ireland to advise his master, and on Strafford's counsel
the Short Parliament had been summoned. But Strafford misread the
temper of England no less than Charles, and his plan of using an
Irish army in Scotland (which, misunderstood by Vane, was to be
damning evidence against him at his trial) was not accepted. With a
starved and slender force, and lacking the goodwill of the
countr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id=
"Page_115">[115]</a></span>y which formed his base, the king went
out to war against what was virtually a united nation in arms.</p>
<p>The prorogued Parliament of Scotland was due to meet on 2nd
June. Charles, by a proclamation in May, prorogued it for a further
month, but the proclamation was disregarded. There was some
technical informality about it, which the acute Covenanting lawyers
were not slow to seize upon.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id=
"FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class=
"fnanchor">[157]</a> But the Parliament which met was clearly
unconstitutional, for there was no royal commissioner; it
constituted itself a Parliament by its own act, and appointed Lord
Burleigh its president; but it still maintained a show of loyalty,
declaring that it acted by his Majesty's "tacit consent" and
"presumed allowance," and that it was only "receiving and making
use of that benefit which his Majesty, in his justice and goodness,
had publicly granted to us and never recalled." It was the fiction
which the Long Parliament in England was presently to adopt and
maintain for seven feverish years. The true state of the case was
summed up in a phrase which was probably Argyll's, "to do the less
was more lawful than to do the greater";<a name="FNanchor_158_158"
id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class=
"fnanchor">[158]</a> the alternative to holding an unauthorized
Parliament was to depose the king. Having embarked upon this bold
course, the new Parliament did not lag. It ratified all the acts of
the previous Assembly, created free parliamentary committees in
place of the old Committee of the Articles, organized the military
preparations against the king, and passed a triennial act. In five
weeks it had accomplished a huge body of legislation, which must
have been carefully prepared beforehand, and thereafter it
prorogued itself till the following November.</p>
<p>Revolution had thus been openly declared, for by no ingenuity of
argument could these proceedings be defended as constitutional.
Montrose opposed them to the utmost of his power, but his was the
only voice;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id=
"FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class=
"fnanchor">[159]</a> since war was declared against the sovereign
there was less need to be scrupulous about minor
prerogatives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id=
"Page_116">[116]</a></span> But his opposition made him a marked
man. A Committee of the Estates was appointed with dictatorial
powers to act as a Government while Parliament was not sitting, and
to this body, which was virtually a Committee of Public Safety, and
consisted of "about forty members, from earls to tailors and
saddlers,"<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id=
"FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class=
"fnanchor">[160]</a> Montrose was appointed, no doubt with the
intention of paralyzing his opposition. There was no alternative
before him but to accept. He still held the greater part of the
Covenant creed; he was in favour of the coming war, believing that
it was necessary to open the king's eyes to the anti-episcopal
resolution of Scotland; had he resigned he would have been
impotent, and must either have fled to the king, like Airlie, or,
like Huntly, hidden himself in northern fastnesses. The moment had
not yet come for the final breach. Argyll was not a member of the
Committee; that lover of secret power was happier pulling the wires
behind the scenes. Besides, he had much business in the west, on
the watch for Strafford's army. His countrymen did not attribute
his abstention to modesty. "All saw he was <i>major potestas</i>,
and, though not formally a member, yet all knew that it was his
influence that gave being, life, and motion to these new-modelled
governors; and not a few thought that this <i>juncto</i> was his
invention."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id=
"FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p>The first care of the Covenanting lords, as in the former war,
was to prevent trouble in their rear. Angus, the Gordon country,
and the Atholl domains in Perthshire were something less than
lukewarm for the Covenant, and to Argyll was given the congenial
task of taking order not only with the enemies of true religion,
but with the ancestral foes of his house. For this commission of
the Committee of Estates Montrose must share the responsibility,
and his name was the first appended. He realized the need in war of
safeguarding the country behind an army, and he recognized that
gentler means than a commission of "fire and sword"<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> would
scarcely suffice. Argyll was authorized to pursue the clans "until
he should either bring them to their bounden duty, and give
assurance of the same by pledges or otherwise, or else to the utter
subduing and rooting them out of the country."<a name=
"FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
<p>He was not slack in the execution of his warrant. With 5,000 of
his clan he left Inveraray on 18th June, entrapped Atholl by a ruse
similar to that employed by Montrose's army with Huntly a year
before,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id=
"FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class=
"fnanchor">[163]</a> and presently arrived in the lowlands of
Angus, where the Campbells were regarded with the same detestation
and fear as was felt elsewhere for Antrim's Irishry. Airlie was in
England with the king, and his son, Lord Ogilvy, was persuaded by
Montrose to surrender Airlie castle for "the use of the
public."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id=
"FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class=
"fnanchor">[164]</a> Montrose accordingly wrote to Argyll saying
that his presence in Angus was needless, but Argyll was not minded
to take instructions from Montrose when an ancient enemy was at his
mercy. He burned the "bonnie house o' Airlie," and the other Ogilvy
dwelling of Forthar in Glenisla; and from the latter Lady Ogilvy
was driven, so the story goes, in circumstances of extreme
barbarity. He then carried fire and sword into Lochaber, and
completed his commission to the satisfaction of the
Estates.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id=
"FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class=
"fnanchor">[165]</a> In it all he had behaved like the ordinary
feudal baron with grievances to avenge. This zealot of the Kirk had
conducted a Highland campaign according to the most<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ruthless traditions of the past, and had thereby compiled against
himself a reckoning which Highland memories were not likely to
forget.</p>
<p>In July Montrose marched south with his contingent to join
Leslie's army, which now lay in camp near the town of Duns. He had
with him the Stirling and Strathearn levies&mdash;2,500 men, says
Napier, 1,600 the English spies reported. In the camp the breach
with Argyll widened. Argyll accused him of undue lenity in his
recent work in Angus, and of needless delay in moving his
regiments; but he was absolved from blame by Leslie and the other
members of the Committee. But his distrust of Argyll promptly
received a full justification. The Committee of Estates was too
large and heterogeneous to be an effective instrument in time of
war, and proposals were being privately made to narrow it. This was
common sense, but the actual scheme took an ominous form. There
were already stories abroad that in his recent northern foray
Argyll's soldiers had declared that they were not King Stewart's
but King Campbell's men, and a Gaelic song was made of which a
verse ran: "I gave Argyll the praise, because all men say it is
truth, for he will take gear from the Lowland men, and he will take
the Crown perforce, and he will cry king at Whitsunday."<a name=
"FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The throne, as we
have seen, was never far from the imagination of the great Scots
nobles who had the blood of Bruce in their veins. But that was for
the future; for the moment the proposals were more
modest&mdash;that one man, Argyll, should be made responsible for
the country north of Forth, and two men for the country south of
it. Montrose protested, and had the draft commission for the north
altered, so that beside Argyll's appeared his own name, with Mar,
Cassilis, and others.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id=
"FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
<p>But, alarmed by the incident, he posted back to Edinburgh, where
he met his old college friend, Lord Lindsay of the Byres, and heard
of a scheme to make "a particular man" dictator of all
Scotlan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id=
"Page_119">[119]</a></span>d, after the Roman fashion. The man, in
view of Lindsay's antecedents, could only be Argyll. To check this
intrigue, before returning to the army, Montrose summoned a meeting
of his friends at Lord Wigton's house of Cumbernauld, near Glasgow,
and signed an agreement to resist "the particular and indirect
practising of a few." The Cumbernauld Bond bound the signatories to
uphold the letter and spirit of the National Covenant "to the
hazard of our lives, fortunes, and estates," and concluded with
words not usually found in Scottish "bands," for they swore to
adhere to each other "so far as may consist with the good and weal
of the public."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id=
"FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class=
"fnanchor">[168]</a> Among others, Marischal, Wigton, Kinghorn,
Home, Boyd, Atholl, Mar, Seaforth, and Almond (Leslie's second in
command) appended their names. None, except Montrose, were men of
power; they were the moderates, the Girondins, of the revolution,
and of little moment compared to the "lawless resolutes" who
opposed them.</p>
<p>Though the Bond was kept secret, the general antagonism to
Argyll's project was known, and this was sufficient for the moment
to defeat it. Montrose returned to the army at Duns, and Leslie
prepared for the invasion of England&mdash;the ostensible purpose
being merely to present to the king a petition praying that the
recent acts of Assembly and Parliament be ratified. The armed
petitioners at once took the offensive. On 20th August, the day on
which Charles left London to assume the command of his army with
Strafford as his lieutenant-general, Leslie crossed the Tweed at
Coldstream, by the very ford which Scott makes Marmion ride on the
eve of Flodden. His Lowlanders were in hodden-grey with blue caps,
and each, in the ancient Scottish fashion, bore oatmeal in a
haversack. The Highland contingent were scantily clad, and carried
broadswords and bows and arrows.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id=

van fell by lot to Montrose. Tweed was in high flood, so he first
forded it alone on foot, and then returned to encourage his
men.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>
<p>The campaign was short and inglorious. Conway, at Newcastle, had
a force far inferior to Leslie's in both numbers and quality, and
he was an indifferent general. "I am teaching cart-horses to
manage," he wrote, "and making men that are fit for Bedlam and
Bridewell to keep the Ten Commandments, so that General Lesley and
I keep two schools: he has scholars that profess to serve God, and
he is instructing them how they may safely do injury and all
impiety; mine to the utmost of their power never kept any law of
God or the king, and they are to be made fit to make others keep
them."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> "I fear," he wrote
also, "unpaid soldiers more than I do the Scots, and the devil to
boot."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> He had cause for his
forebodings. Leslie marched without opposition to the ford of
Newburn, four miles above Newcastle, the crossing of which would
not only give him command of the Tyne, but enable him to attack
Newcastle on the unfortified side. There Conway attempted a stand,
but on 28th August he was blown out of his position by the Scottish
guns. His cavalry fled to Durham, while his foot fell back on
Newcastle, which next morning surrendered. It was, Clarendon wrote,
"the most shameful and confounding flight that was ever heard of."
A battle, which played a major part in our constitutional history,
and which was to Charles what Bouvines was to King John, was won in
an afternoon with a loss of a dozen to the victors and sixty to the
vanquished. Charles fell back on York; he could not do otherwise,
for he had no force which could have withstood Leslie for an
hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id=
"Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>The Covenanters' occupation of Newcastle, with the surrounding
district, gave them a powerful lever in subsequent negotiations,
for they controlled the supply of coal to London, and thereby
&pound;50,000 of the king's revenue.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id=
"FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class=
"fnanchor">[175]</a> They behaved discreetly, for they had no
desire to antagonize the English people. The first problem was that
of subsistence, and Charles consented to their raising a daily levy
from the four neighbouring counties. Negotiations began at Ripon,
and were presently transferred to London, but it was not till
August 7, 1641, that the dispute, mainly financial, was finally
settled. Meantime his difficulties forced Charles to call a
Parliament, and on November 3, 1640, as a direct result of the
Scottish invasion, the Long Parliament assembled. Already many
communications had passed between the English malcontents and the
Covenanters, beginning with Lord Savile's assurance, with its
forged signatures, in June 1640, when Leslie's army was mustering.
Now, with London as the venue of discussion, Covenanters like
Henderson and Wariston were brought into close touch with Pym and
the Puritan leaders, and we find the idea first mooted of the
forcible introduction of Presbytery into England. Wariston had
suggested something like it to Savile in June 1640, and Henderson,
in London, came to believe that the one hope of safeguarding
Presbytery in Scotland was by securing its establishment south of
the Tweed. The Scottish commissioners were instructed to table, as
one of their propositions, "a desire for unity in religion and
uniformity in Church government as a special means of conserving
the peace between the two countries," and they found much support
in Parliament. The London "root and branch" petition for the
abolition of episcopacy was presented to Parliament on 11th
December, and others flowed in from the shires. Parliament for the
moment rejected the Scottish plan, but the Scottish commissioners
continued to hope. The papers drafted at that time by Henderson on
the subject contain the policy which, two years later, bore fruit
in the Solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id=
"Page_122">[122]</a></span> League and Covenant. "Nothing so
powerful to divide the hearts of people as division in religion;
nothing so strong to unite the hearts of people as unity in
religion; and the greater zeal in different religions the greater
division, but the more zeal in one religion the more firm union. In
the paradise of Nature the diversity of flowers and herbs is
pleasant and useful, but in the paradise of the Church different
and contrary religions are unpleasant and hurtful."<a name=

"#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>
<p>That was one omen for those who had eyes to read it; the Scots,
who had at the moment the vantage, were suggesting a higher price
for peace than the bills of expenses which Leslie was patiently
presenting. Another was the swift movement in Parliament to exact
retribution from those who, like Strafford and Laud, were commonly
held to be the pillars of monarchical policy. There was a
third&mdash;most fateful of all; for the Huntingdonshire grazier,
who had been so active in defending the rights of the fen
commoners, was now at Westminster. On a certain November day, at
the opening of the session, a young courtier, Sir Philip Warwick,
very proud of his fine clothes, found a member speaking in the
House whom he did not know, a gentleman in a plain suit made by a
bad country tailor, his linen not very clean, and a speck of blood
on his little band." His stature was of a good size, his sword
stuck close to his side, his countenance swollen and reddish, his
voice sharp and untunable, and his eloquence full of
fervour."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id=

<h2>III</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1640</i></div>
<p>Montrose may have hoped to find a solution of his doubts in
swift action in the field, but the easy victory of Newburn brought
no comfort. Of his part in that campaign we know nothing, except
that in his opponents' eyes he was one of the Covenanting leaders,
and that Strafford hastened to report from Darlington to the king
the false rumour that he had been killed by Wilmot.<a name=
"FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> A man of active
temper and complete honesty, if he cannot see his way plain, is apt
to make a sorry business of waiting. Perplexities thickened about
the path of the undecided Montrose. He saw clearly the necessity of
asserting and safeguarding the central authority, the king's, if
Scotland was to be saved from anarchy, and he saw no less clearly
the direction of Argyll's thoughts; but he still believed that the
Covenanters as a whole were willing to listen to moderate counsels,
and that if he bided his time he might yet lead his countrymen into
reasonable ways. After the fiasco of Newburn and the ready
capitulation of Newcastle, he may have argued that Scotland had
sufficiently vindicated her rights against Charles, and that the
time was ripe for insisting that the royal rights in turn should be
safeguarded. He did not know how closely the interests of the
Covenant were linked with Pym and his followers in the English
Parliament, whose maxim it was rapidly becoming that the king could
do no right. Nor did he realize the direction of the thoughts of
the Scottish commissioners and their grandiose scheme for imposing
Presbytery on England. He looked about for like-minded associates,
and found few. He was not a simple-souled royalist like Airlie, who
saw the problem as a plain choice between honour and dishonour, or
a medi&aelig;val satrap like Huntly, who thought in terms of family pride
and ancestral enmities. He had a philosophy of politics, which we
shall presently consider, and he explored the nobility of Scotland
to see if he could find others, besides Napier, who subscribed to
it. So he became zealous in discussing public affairs, and thereby
played into Argyll's hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1640-41</i></div>
<p>Suspicion of him had grown among the Covenanting leaders, and he
was closely watched. From Newcastle he wrote to the king a simple
protestation of loyalty, and the letter came to the knowledge of
the Committee&mdash;picked up by accident, says Burnet; disclosed
by spies in the royal bedchamber, says Wishart. He was accused of
"having intelligence with the enemy," and made the unanswerable
reply that the king, against whose person and authority any
aspersion was made treason by the articles of war, could not be
"the enemy."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id=
"FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class=
"fnanchor">[179]</a> In Baillie's report of the incident he is
spoken of as one "whose pride long ago was intolerable and meaning
very doubtful." November found Montrose back in Scotland, summoned
to explain the Cumbernauld Bond, the contents of which had come to
Argyll's ear through hints dropped by Lord Boyd on his deathbed.
The Committee of Estates called before them the signatories, who
acknowledged and justified their action. Some of the ministers
demanded the death of the accused, but these were too powerful to
receive more than censure, since some of them commanded regiments,
and all were territorial magnates. "They consulted to patch up the
business after a declaration under their hands that they intended
nothing against the public, together with a surrendering of the
bond, which the Committee, having gotten, caused it to be
burned."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id=

allies had become very wide. He returned to the army, and his
indignation made his tongue run loose. In January 1641 he told
Colonel Cochrane, in the presence of old Leslie, that he could
prove that certain leaders in Scotland were scheming to depose the
king, and he left no doubt in the mind of his embarrassed hearers
that he referred to Argyll.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id=

<p>In the beginning of 1641 it would appear that Montrose and his

come to Scotland and satisfy every reasonable Covenanting demand;
that done, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id=

him, to resist the follies of fanatical preachers, to check the
aggression of selfish nobles, and above all to curb the ambition of
Argyll, whose treason they would be in a position to prove. In a
letter to Charles, written in the early months of the year,
Montrose offered wise advice to his sovereign.</p>

<p>"Your ancient and native kingdom of Scotland is in a mighty
distemper. It is incumbent on your Majesty to find out the disease,
remove the cause, and apply convenient remedies. The disease in my
opinion is contagious, and may infect the rest of your Majesty's
dominions. It is a falling sickness, for they are like to fall from
you, and from the obedience due to you, if, by removing the cause,
and application of wholesome remedies, it be not speedily
prevented. The cause is a fear and apprehension, not without some
reason, of changes in religion, and that superstitious worship
shall be brought in upon it, and therewith all their laws infringed
and their liberties invaded. Free them, sir, from this fear, as you
are free from any such thoughts; and undoubtedly you shall thereby
settle the State in a firm obedience to your Majesty in all time
coming. They have no other end but to preserve their religion in
purity, and their liberties entire. That they intend the overthrow
of monarchial government is a calumny. They are capable of no
other, for many and great reasons; and ere they will admit another
than your Majesty, and after you your son and nearest of your
posterity, to sit upon your throne, many thousands of them will
spend their dearest blood. You are not like a tree lately planted,
which oweth a fall to the first wind. Your ancestors have governed
theirs, without interruption of race, two thousand years or
thereabouts, and taken such root as it can never be plucked up by
any but yourselves. If any others shall entertain such treasonable
thoughts, which I do not believe, certainly they will prove as vain
as they are wicked.</p>
<p>"The remedy of this dangerous disease consisteth only in your
Majesty's presence for a space in that kingdom. It is easy to you
in person to settle their troubles, and to disperse these mists of
apprehension and mistaking&mdash;impossible to any other. If you
send down a commissioner, whatever he be, he shall neither give nor
get contentment, but shall render the disease incurable. The
success of your Majesty's affairs, the security of your authority,
the peace and happiness of your subjects, depend upon your personal
presence. The disease is of that kind which is much helped by
conceit<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id=
"FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class=
"fnanchor">[182]</a> and the presence of the physician. Now is the
proper time and the critical days. For the people love change, and
expect from it much good&mdash;a new heaven and a new earth; but,
being disappointed, are as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126"
id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> desirous of a re-change to the
former estate.</p>
<p>"Satisfy them, sir, in point of religion and liberties, when you
come here, in a loving and free manner; that they may see your
Majesty had never any other purpose, and doth not intend the least
prejudice to either. For religious subjects, and such as enjoy
their lawful liberties, obey better and love more than the godless
and the servile, who do all out of base fear, which begets hate.
Any difference that may arise upon the Acts passed in the last
Parliament, your Majesty's presence, and the advice and endeavour
of your faithful servants will easily accommodate. Let your Majesty
be pleased to express your favour and care of your subjects' weal
by giving way to any just notion of theirs for relief of the
burdens these late troubles have laid on them, and by granting what
else may tend to their good; which your Majesty may do with
assurance that therein is included your own.</p>
<p>"Suffer them not to meddle or dispute of your power. It is an
instrument never subjects yet handled well. Let not your authority
receive any diminution of that which the law of God and Nature and
the fundamental laws of the country alloweth; for then it shall
grow contemptible; and weak and miserable is the people whose
prince hath not power sufficient to punish oppression and to
maintain peace and justice.</p>
<p>"On the other side, aim not at absoluteness. It endangers your
estate and stirs up trouble. The people of the western parts of the
world could never endure it any long time, and they of Scotland
less than any. Hearken not to Rehoboam's counsellors. They are
flatterers, and therefore cannot be friends; they will follow your
fortune, and love not your person. Pretend what they will, their
hasty ambition and avarice make them persuade an absolute
government that the exercise of the same (may be put) on them, and
then they know how to get wealth . . .<a name="FNanchor_183_183"
id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class=
"fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
<p>"Practise, sir, the temperate government. It fitteth the humour
and disposition of the nation best. It is most strong, most
powerful, most desirable of any. It gladdeth the heart of your
subjects, and then they erect a throne there for you to reign.
<i>Firmissimum imperium quo obedientes gaudent.</i> Let your last
act there be the settling the offices of State upon men of known
integrity and sufficiency. Take them not upon credit and other
men's recommendation; they prefer men for their own ends and with
respect to themselves. Neither yet take them at a hazard, but upon
your own knowledge, which fully reacheth to a great many more than
will fill those few places. Let them not be such as are obliged to
others than yourself for their preferment; not factious nor
popular; neither such as are much hated; for these are not able to
serve you well, and the others are not willing if it be prejudice
to those upon whom they depend. They who are preferred and obliged
to your Majesty will study to behave them well and dutifully in
their places, if it were for no other reason yet for this, that
they make not your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127">[127]</a></span> Majesty ashamed of your choice.</p>
<p>"So shall your Majesty secure your authority for the present,
and settle it for the future time. Your journey shall be
prosperous, your return glorious. You shall be followed with the
blessings of your people, and with that contentment which a
virtuous deed reflecteth upon the mind of the doer. And more true
and solid shall your glory be than if you had conquered nations and
subdued a people.</p>

<br>
<p>This sagacious letter might be elaborately annotated from
contemporary history. There was no sentence in it which future
events were not to justify abundantly, save that optimism about
Scottish opinion which was to prove to Montrose a deceptive light.
What could Argyll offer on the other side? It would be a mistake to
take too seriously the gossip about his monarchical ambitions. The
chief of the Campbells was far too shrewd a man to let a glittering
dream divert him from a practicable purpose. His aim was to be
dictator of Scotland, and his abilities were adequate to the task.
Had he had military genius, he might well have played in Scotland
the part of Cromwell, and wholly upturned the old foundations of
sovereignty. But what had he to put in its place? Another autocracy
without the sanctions of the old. He had made the cumbrous medi&aelig;val
Parliament a more efficient and representative thing, but this
reform merely strengthened the hands of the new oligarchy. He was
sworn to the creed of intolerant Presbyterian domination in its
extremest form. Above all, he was the clan chief, who supported his
friends and did not forgive his enemies. To Montrose the
alternative was unthinkable, for it would bring to Scotland not
peace but a naked sword. He himself, in his young enthusiasm for
the national religion and liberties, had been led into courses
which were alien to his beliefs. He had assented to the constraint
of private consciences, when he approved of the compulsory
signature of the Covenant; he had given his approval to feudal
barbarities when he signed Argyll's commis<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>sion for
the subjection of the North. But his eyes were now opened, and he
hastened to draw aside from that perilous road.</p>
<p>Montrose was an ingenuous conspirator, for in his eagerness to
discover like-mindedness and make converts he talked freely to the
wrong people. At Scone, during a visit to Lord Stormont, he heard
from Atholl, Stewart of Grandtully, and John Stewart of Ladywell,
the commissary of Dunkeld, reports of treasonable speeches made by
Argyll during the Perthshire expedition of the previous year. He
spoke of them to his friend, Mr. Robert Murray, the minister of
Methven, who mentioned them to Mr. John Graham, the minister of
Auchterarder, who repeated the story to the Auchterarder
presbytery, whence it came to the ear of Argyll. Graham and Murray
were asked for their authority, and they named Montrose, who
accepted responsibility and in turn cited his evidence. His
witnesses, he said, were Lindsay of the Byres, Cassilis, Mar, and
Stewart of Ladywell. The witnesses were summoned before the
Committee of Estates, and proved unsatisfactory. Lindsay remembered
the conversation, but said that he had not named Argyll. Ladywell
stood by his words, signed a written statement, and was thereupon,
on 31st May, sent to Edinburgh castle.</p>
<p>There something happened. Either Ladywell's nerve broke down, or
he was worked on by friends of Argyll, like Balmerino; for next day
he saw Argyll, recanted the charges against him, and declared that
he had forged them out of malice. He did more, for he confessed
that he had been privy to discussions between Montrose, Napier, his
nephew Sir George Stirling of Keir, and Keir's brother-in-law,
Archibald Stewart of Blackhall, and that, acting on their
instructions, he had sent a report of Argyll's treason to the king.
The messenger who carried it was a certain Walter Stewart of the
Traquair family, and on the return journey he was captured by the
Committee. Among the papers found on him was a short note from the
king to Montrose about his coming to Scotland, to which
no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id=
"Page_129">[129]</a></span> exception could be taken, and certain
papers written in a strange jargon, which was in all likelihood the
product of Stewart's own half-witted fancy, but which to the
Committee had an ugly look of a secret cypher. Stewart was ready
with a confused but dark-sounding interpretation, and on this
document Montrose, Napier, Stirling, and Stewart of Blackhall were
arrested and confined in separate rooms in the castle.<a name=
"FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p>It is not likely that Ladywell's first story was true. Argyll
was too cautious a man to speak rashly on such matters in uncertain
company; if he talked of the deposition of kings, it is probable
that it was as an abstract proposition of kings in general. Nor did
he show the desire of the rest of the Committee for the summary
punishment of Ladywell&mdash;which would have been natural if
Ladywell had been an inconvenient witness whom it was politic to
silence. We know from Guthry, a hostile witness, that he consulted
the Lord Advocate to see if a more lenient sentence could not be
imposed.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id=
"FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class=
"fnanchor">[186]</a> The wretched man was duly convicted under the
old Scottish statute of "leasing-making,"<a name="FNanchor_187_187"
id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class=
"fnanchor">[187]</a> and publicly beheaded in Edinburgh on 28th
July.</p>
<p>Meantime there was the far graver business of Montrose. Argyll
could afford to neglect the wild gossip of the commissary of
Dunkeld, but it was another matter to have responsible Scottish
nobles, with influence in the army, negotiating behind his back
with the king. Napier was offered release as a favour, but declined
to accept it; he declared that if any one was guilty he was, and he
would not be separated from his companions. Montrose refused to
answer any question before the Committee, and demanded a public
trial by his peers. Traquair angrily denied any complicity with his
preposterous kinsman, Walter Stewart. The king wrote on 12th June
to Argyll to clear himsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>f; his letter to Montrose was "fit
for me to write, both for the matter, and the person to whom it is
written;"<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id=
"FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class=
"fnanchor">[188]</a> he had made no promise to any one as to the
distribution of offices; he was coming to Scotland for no other
purpose than to settle the affairs of the kingdom "according to the
articles of the treaty." This might seem sufficient to clear
Montrose, but his opponents, having got him under duress, did not
intend to let him readily go. His house was broken into and his
papers ransacked, but nothing more dangerous to the peace of the
realm could be found than a paper justifying the Cumbernauld Bond,
and "some letters from ladies to him in his younger years, flowered
with Arcadian compliments."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id=
"FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class=
"fnanchor">[189]</a> On 27th July he was brought before Parliament,
and declared that he had nothing to confess or to defend. "Truth
doth not seek corners, it needeth no favour." He awaited their
lordships' questions or commands. "My resolution is to carry along
with me fidelity and honour to the grave."<a name=
"FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> They could make
nothing of such a man, and sent him back to prison. He was brought
again before Parliament on 6th August, and a third time on 14th
August.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id=
"FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class=
"fnanchor">[191]</a> On the evening of the latter day the king
arrived in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Charles's determination to come to Scotland, so puzzling to
Clarendon, was due to the belief that he had still a powerful
following in that kingdom, which needed only to be heartened by his
presence. But a few days in Edinburgh were sufficient to
disillusion him. With Lennox and Hamilton as his companions he
recovered neither popularity nor authority. He had come north
largely in the hope of securing part of Leslie's army for use in
the struggle which he saw to be imminent in England, and for this
he was prepared to pay a high price. He paid the price, but he did
not secure his end, for Leslie's army was disbanded.
Non-Covenanting nobles like Lennox, Hamilton, Morton, and Roxburgh
were compelled to take the Covenant. Hamilton, always, as Charles
said, "very active in his own preservation<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>," made
his peace with Argyll. Henderson became the royal chaplain, and the
king was obliged to listen to many sermons and attend endless
services conducted under the austerest Presbyterian forms. He was
prepared to ratify the Acts of the unconstitutional Parliament of
1640, but he was not permitted. These Acts, he was curtly informed,
were already valid, and he was instructed merely to sanction their
proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id=
"FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class=
"fnanchor">[192]</a> Parliament demanded, and he granted, a control
over the executive and judiciary far more complete than anything
claimed by the English Parliament at Westminster.<a name=
"FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Its triennial
meeting was guaranteed, independent of the royal assent. Loudoun
was nominated Chancellor; for Treasurer, the king's suggestions
first of Morton and then of Almond were vetoed, and the office was
put into commission. There was no proposal of the Covenanters,
however drastic, to which the king did not assent. In return he
received much lip loyalty and many fine speeches, but no general
popularity or confidence. As was his fatal habit, he had been too
late in his concessions, and what, if voluntarily given, might once
have re-established his power, now, taken by force, left only
distrust and contempt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what of Montrose, now fast in prison? Was he to go
the way of Strafford? There was an ominous sentence used by Argyll
at the opening of Parliament in his reply to the speech from the
Throne, when he spoke of the State as a ship in distress and the
need of casting out "some of the naughtiest baggage to lighten
her."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The old statute
against "leasing-making" might be used as a weapon against nobler
game than the humble commissary of Dunkeld. On 15th September Sir
Patrick Wemyss wrote to Ormonde that the king had promised Montrose
not to leave Scotland till he was brought to trial, "for, if he
leave him, all the world will not save his life."<a name=
"FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> On 28th August the
four prisoners were called before Par<span class="pagenum"><a name=

nodded friendlily to Napier,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id=
"FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class=
"fnanchor">[196]</a> but their case was postponed. It would have
been highly inconvenient to Argyll and Hamilton to have Montrose at
this juncture pleading his cause before his peers.</p>
<p>Back again in the castle, Montrose was in a state of miserable
anxiety and impotence. He heard of the new Act making the choice of
Ministers dependent upon the will of Parliament&mdash;a piece of
constitutionalism which, lacking the machinery and safeguards of
modern government, was simply a premium set upon faction and
sectarian tyranny. He heard of the decision that no one who had
shown himself active on the king's side should be eligible for
office. He must have exclaimed with Perth: "If this be what you
call liberty, God give me the old slavery again."<a name=
"FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He heard that among
the nobles there were many who, whatever their past attitude, now
saw with alarm the road which Argyll was taking. His one hope was
Charles. He alone, if he clearly understood the situation, had the
power of making it clear to Parliament and checking this drift
towards oligarchy. Twice he wrote from prison praying for an
interview with the king, that he might reveal matters "which not
only concerned his honour in a high degree, but also the standing
or falling of his crown."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id=
"FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class=
"fnanchor">[198]</a> These matters could only have been Hamilton's
previous duplicity and Argyll's present ambitions. The third time
he put his cards on the table, and on 11th October offered to prove
that Hamilton was a traitor to the commonwealth. Charles was
impressed, and prepared to lay the business before the Chancellor
and others of the Privy Council.</p>
<p>But in the meantime there had begun the curious performance
known to history as the "Incident"&mdash;a thing as obscure in its
origins as the Popish Plot. For some weeks there had been a
mysterious influx of armed men into the capital, against which
Loudoun, on 5th October, had warned Parliament.<a name=
"FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We know that
Hamilton and Argyll had 5,000 of their friends, and in<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> the
other faction Lord Ker, Roxburgh's son, had 600 Borderers. On the
evening of 11th October, the day on which Montrose's third letter
was received, Hamilton went to the king in the garden of Holyrood,
complained of being traduced, and asked permission to leave the
court.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Next day Charles
told this story to Parliament, but on that morning Hamilton,
Argyll, and Lanark had retired to the Hamilton house of Kinneil,
near Bo'ness. Their story was that they had learned through Leslie
that there was a plot against their lives.<a name=
"FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> For a day or two
king and Parliament faced each other in a strange mood, the former
protesting with tears against the insult done to his honour, the
latter in complete bewilderment. A Committee of the Estates
investigated the business, and Montrose's correspondence with the
king was laid before them; but no definite conclusion was reached,
and the truth must remain one of the secrets of history.</p>
<p>Charles was clearly innocent; so was Montrose, who at the time
was close in prison. No doubt there were nobles, such as Ker and
Crawford, with bands of retainers at their heels, who would gladly
have taken the old Scots way of settling matters with their
enemies. There were others, such as Carnwath, who made no secret of
their view that there were now three kings in Scotland, and that
two of them could be dispensed with. But the study of the confused
evidence leaves a strong impression that the whole affair was a
trick, a device of Hamilton's and Argyll's to escape from the
difficulties in which Montrose's third letter might have placed
them. Argyll was a master of electioneering ingenuities, and he
knew that the suspicion of being in peril is a supreme asset to a
leader. The impression abides, too, that there was an <i>agent
provocateur</i> at work behind the scenes, and this may well have
been William Murray, a gentleman of the king's bedchamber, the son
of the minister of Dysart and the nephew of Montrose's<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> friend,
the minister of Methven. Beginning as the king's whipping-boy, he
was to finish his career as Earl of Dysart, and the father-in-law
of Lauderdale. By general consent he was one of the most degraded
characters of the age, and he was already suspect of meddling with
the king's letters; it is at least possible that the Incident was
mainly his work, a bogus conspiracy staged to give Hamilton the
chance of discrediting his opponents.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id=

"fnanchor">[202]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1641-42</i></div>
<p>On 28th October, while the Incident was at its height, the king
was playing golf at Leith, when a letter was put into his hands. It
contained the news of the outbreak of the Irish rebellion. In a
week the atmosphere in both England and Scotland had become tense
and ominous, fear of popery spread like a flame, and the king's
enemies had no need to create suspicion, for suspicion rose like a
mist from every corner of the land. Charles could not linger in the
north. On 18th November, at eight o'clock in the morning, he rode
south, leaving for ever the country which he had so loved and
misgoverned. He departed with a lavish shower of honours. Henderson
was made dean of the Chapel Royal at Holyrood, Wariston was
knighted, Loudoun and Leslie<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id=
"FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class=
"fnanchor">[203]</a> became earls, and Argyll was made a
marquis.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id=
"FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class=

friends were released on probation, and in March 1642 the case
against them was finally closed.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> The four gentlemen, who
had been five months in prison without trial, were informed that
they owed their escape only to the clemency of Argyll. Montrose had
engaged, ingenuously and amateurishly, in the difficult game of
subterranean Scottish politics, and had taken a heavy fall. The new
marquis could afford to be generous to an antagonist whom, in the
business of plots and counterplots, he had so signally
outplayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1640-41</i></div>
<p>During these years of ineffectual politics, Montrose, in his
long journeys and in quiet hours of retreat at Kincardine, was
steadfastly endeavouring to clarify his own mind. Some time between
the autumn of 1640 and the summer of 1641 he set down his views on
the principles of government in a letter to a "noble sir," who may
have been Lord Napier or Drummond of Hawthornden. The paper was
found by Mark Napier in a small quarto in the handwriting of Robert
Wodrow, and is among the manuscripts in the National Library of
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id=
"FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class=
"fnanchor">[205]</a> It is one of those confessions of faith by
which, at all periods in history, sorely perplexed men have striven
to ease their souls. The seventeenth century saw no more searching
political treatise, for it reveals a capacity for abstract thought
rare at any time in a man of action, and especially rare in an era
when, as soon as the lists were set, half-truths were vested with
the authority of Sinai.</p>
<p>He begins by laying down a doctrine of Sovereign Power. If a
land is to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id=
"Page_137">[137]</a></span>be stably governed there must be some
unquestioned centre of authority which he calls Sovereignty, "a
power over the people, above which power there is none on earth."
It is limited indeed&mdash;by the laws of God and nature, the laws
of nations, and the fundamental laws of the country; but these
limitations are moral, religious, and constitutional, and inherent
in its very being; it cannot be limited by division among competing
authorities. Springing ultimately from a free people, it may in
practice be delegated to a king, as in Britain; a council of
nobles, as in Venice; or the estates of the people, as in ancient
Rome. It "cannot subsist in a body composed of individuities"; if
it is "divided amongst several bodies there is no government, as if
there were many kings in one kingdom there should be none at
all."</p>
<p>Montrose holds no brief for monarchy, except in so far as it is
the form of sovereignty which has been accepted by the British
people. He proceeds to analyse the nature of kingship. It is strong
when it is temperate and recognizes its moral and constitutional
limitations. "It is weak . . . when it is extended beyond the laws
whereby it is bounded; which could never be at any time endured by
the people of the western part of the world, and by those of
Scotland as little as any." But the ills flowing from undue
restraint are not less than the ills which spring from undue
extension. No section of the people can seize a part of
sovereignty, for, if sovereignty be divided, there follows anarchy,
"the oppression and tyranny of subjects, the most fierce,
insatiable, and insufferable tyranny in the world." He desires free
and frequent parliaments and stern dealing with any law-breaking
king; but he insists that, when sovereignty has been granted on
conditions, it must be inviolable so long as these conditions are
observed. Parliaments are guardians of the subjects' liberties, but
not less of the delegated rights of the sovereign king.</p>
<p>He passes to the menaces to sovereignty&mdash;and therefore the
causes of anarchy&mdash;and he finds them in "the ambitious designs
of rule in great men, veiled under the specious pretext of religion
and the subjects' liberti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>es, seconded with the arguments and
false positions of seditious precedence: first, that the king is
ordained for the people, and the end is more noble than the means;
second, that the constituter is superior to the constituent; third,
that the king and people are two contraries, like the two scales of
a balance&mdash;when the one goes up the other goes down; fourth,
that the prince's prerogative and the people's privilege are
incompatible; fifth, that what power is taken from the king is
added to the Estates of the people." On this text he preaches an
acute sermon. The two first points, as he explains them, do not
mean that he holds that there is any absolutism in a free monarchy,
but that, the choice of monarchy having been made by the people,
such monarchy, which is their own creation, must be reasonably
exalted, since in its exaltation lies their security. With the fear
of the encroachments of the nobility and the Kirk in his mind, he
appeals to the commons of Scotland:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"And you, ye meaner people of Scotland&mdash;who are not capable
of a Republic, for many grave reasons&mdash;why are you induced by
specious pretexts, to your own heavy prejudice and detriment, to be
the instruments of others' ambition? Do you not hear, when the
monarchial government is shaken, the great ones strive for the
garland with <i>your</i> blood and <i>your</i> fortune? Whereby you
gain nothing; but, instead of a race of kings who have governed you
for two thousand years with peace and justice, and have preserved
your liberties against all domineering nations, shall purchase to
yourselves vultures and tigers to reign over your posterity; and
yourselves shall endure all these miseries, massacres, and
proscriptions of the Triumvirate of Rome&mdash;(till) the kingdom
fall again into the hands of One, who of necessity must, and for
reasons of State will, tyrannize over you. For kingdoms acquired by
blood and violence are by the same means retained."<a name=

<p>It is the old profound lesson of history, eternally taught and
eternally forgotten. After anarchy comes the dictator; the
successors of the Gracchi are the C&aelig;sars; the fury of the French
Revolution is stamped out by Napoleon; the confusion of a Russia
emancipa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id=
"Page_139">[139]</a></span>ted from her old masters is imperfectly
disciplined by a harsher tyranny. In the England of that moment the
"One" of whom he prophesied was already walking about in his sober
country clothes and great buff boots. Montrose, it is to be noted,
preaches the organic nature of the State to the common people, but
to the Kirk and the nobility he addresses a different argument. He
only warns them that their ambition will fail&mdash;the preachers,
that the nobles will use them for their own interest, "as a cunning
tennis-player lets a ball go to the wall where it cannot stay, that
he may take it at the bound with more ease"; the nobles, that, like
Aesop's dog, they will lose the substance for the shadow in the
well. It would seem that he had made up his mind that the Kirk and
the aristocracy were no longer amenable to reason.</p>
<p>We must be on our guard against reading into this philosophy of
politics more than Montrose intended. If he saw beyond his age, he
was also the child of that age. Much in his creed is not new.
Fortescue in the fifteenth century had laid down the doctrine of
constitutional monarchy. "The King of England cannot alter nor
change the Lawes of the Realme at his pleasure; for why, he
governeth his people by power, not only royall but politique." The
Tudor monarchs had established the principle of an indivisible
sovereignty by suppressing local immunities and crushing all rival
authorities. But Montrose shows in many respects a startling
originality, especially as contrasted with the writers of his own
political party. He does not, like James I., identify sovereignty
with monarchy;<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id=
"FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class=
"fnanchor">[207]</a> he is willing to accept any form of
government, provided it fulfils the requirements which are
indispensable in all governments. Unlike his friend Drummond of
Hawthornden, he has none of the contemporary belief in Divine
Right, and he is no advocate of passive obedience.<a name=
"FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> He is primarily a
realist, and he is curiously free from medi&aelig;val ideas on monarchy
or on religion. His central principle may<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> deduce
from Bodin, but its application was based upon his personal
observation of Scots affairs.</p>
<p>To orientate his political creed in relation to his age would
require a treatise. Many philosophers of diverse schools, like
Hobbes and Milton, accepted his doctrine of sovereignty. Montrose
did not go into the metaphysics of political origins, the question
which has agitated thinkers from Aristotle to Rousseau, whether the
title to rule be natural or conventional. He would have accepted
Hooker's view that sovereignty should be founded on consent, and
while agreeing with Milton that sovereignty is from the people, he
would have shrunk from Milton's addendum that the popular liberty
of decision is only to be respected so long as the people accept a
particular creed.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id=
"FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class=
"fnanchor">[209]</a> In the realism of his method of thought he has
affinities with Hobbes, but not in his conclusion: he has much in
common with Samuel Rutherford, whose <i>Lex Rex</i>, published in
1644, lays down the thesis that sovereignty comes from the people,
who may, in time of extreme necessity, resume this power, and
nothing in common with Sir George Mackenzie, whose reply to
Buchanan's <i>De Jure Regni</i><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id=
"FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class=
"fnanchor">[210]</a> is a proof of the extravagant lengths to which
a Scot could go in defending the alien dogma of Divine Right. His
doctrine of sovereignty is at the opposite pole from that of
Strafford, who believed that the security of a nation depended in
emergencies upon an executive authority above and outside the
ordinary law, an inalienable and overriding prerogative&mdash;a
view which in one form is a truism to-day, but which in the
seventeenth century, if generally accepted, would have put an end
to popular liberties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id=
"Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>But Montrose is not a metaphysician. He is a student of history
and an observer of facts. His inquiry is a practical one&mdash;how
to stave off anarchy, and the maxims which he offers have their
direct contemporary applications. He is modern in his doctrine of
the organic unity of the State, but in two matters he is very
clearly of his age.</p>
<p>The first is his attitude towards parliamentary government. "It
is curious to observe," says Coleridge of the early seventeenth
century, "that the thinner the realm was (the less both in wealth
and influence, and the less they were diffused) the greater was the
division of power."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id=
"FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class=
"fnanchor">[211]</a> In the constitution of that age there was no
clear determination of function between the executive, the
judiciary, and the legislature. "The 'rule of law,' which the power
of the state existed to enforce, worked through no specialized
machinery, the organization was still fluid, only here and there
hardening into conventions. . . . The conception of an exclusive
sovereignty, inherent in any one branch of the Constitution, was
still far distant."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id=
"FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class=
"fnanchor">[212]</a> In strict theory, the true sovereign was the
law fundamental, the "law of the land," which was regarded as
beyond the reach of legislative change. Magna Charta had been a
solemn embodiment of one portion of that law. In 1604 the Speaker
of the House of Commons divided the laws into (1) the Common law,
not mutable; (2) the Positive law, to be altered by the occasion of
the times; (3) customs and usages which have time's approbation.
The distinction appears in Sir Walter Raleigh's <i>Prerogative of
Parliaments</i>; Sir Edward Coke maintained that the function of
king and parliament was not <i>jus dare</i> but <i>jus
dicere</i>&mdash;to declare the law; in 1659 Nicholas Bacon told
Richard Cromwell's Parliament that, as regarded bicameral
government, "long usage hath so settled it, as Acts of Parliament
cannot alter it." The doctrine of the legislative supremacy of
Parliament was still in the womb of time.<a name="FNanchor_213_213"
id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class=
"fnanchor">[213]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id=
"Page_142">[142]</a></span>
<p>Montrose held firmly to this conception of a law immutable and
fundamental; it was the code to which both he and Charles appealed
at their trials, and it moulded his view of sovereignty. With this
adamantine sanction in the background, which no other power could
change, he was compelled to think of a constitution as a thing of
delicate balances, of authority as a commodity scrupulously weighed
out and studiously limited, and of a central delegated sovereignty
as inhering in a monarch rather than in any Parliament. National
health, he maintained, depended, like bodily health, upon each
member playing its own part without encroachment. The monarchy
seemed to him the most vital part of a nicely adjusted mechanism,
since upon its proper functioning the working of all other parts
specially depended. He places the emphasis on the Crown, though he
gives it no autocracy. He could not foresee that this delicate
adjustment would end in stagnation, and that in a later age it
would be necessary to aggrandize the power of one part in order to
make the wheels revolve. It was difficult for any thinker of his
time to accept the legislative sovereignty of Parliament, to which
the Long Parliament tried to feel its way&mdash;the notion of the
"law fundamental" forbade it; but it was doubly difficult for
Montrose. For the Parliament which he knew was the Scots
Parliament, with its bad traditions of incompetence and servility.
It may be that Argyll had a vision of parliamentary government
denied to his contemporaries, but it was a vision, for a sober
survey of the facts seemed to render it impossible. A wise and
impartial king might hold the balance between conflicting
interests, but the Scots Parliament, swung alternately between Kirk
and nobles, would, if unfettered, produce only despotism or
anarchy.</p>
<p>The second matter in which Montrose is a man of his time, is his
attitude towards what we call democracy. He believed that from the
whole nation came the sanction of sovereignty, but he was not a
democrat <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id=
"Page_143">[143]</a></span>in the modern sense, for the common
people in his day were scarcely conscious of political rights, and
asked rather to be wisely protected than to be endowed with
ill-understood duties. But, both in his theory and in his practice,
he was more democratic than most of his generation. He held that
the laws were the only safeguard of the plain man, the true monarch
of which the king was but the creature. He saw that any disturbance
of the equipoise in the distribution of public duties would not add
to popular liberties, but, by increasing confusion, would augment
the power of this or that oligarchical faction. He held&mdash;and
what student of the period will dissent?&mdash;that the
contemporary commons of Scotland were "more incapable of
sovereignty than any other known." The people, as a political
force, did not come within the imagination of seventeenth-century
Britain. "They care not what Government they live under," said
Haselrig, "so as they may plough and go to market."<a name=
"FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The proletariat was
as meaningless a thing to Cromwell and Vane as it was to Strafford
and Clarendon, and the creed of the Leveller was as hateful to the
Puritan as to the Cavalier. Indeed it may be said that the silent
masses had more to gain from king than from Parliament, for it was
the Crown which, in Star Chamber and Council, did its best to check
enclosure, protect tenant right, and maintain wages. Montrose, with
his doctrine of the organic unity of the State, and his constant
appeal to the "mean people," came nearer democracy, it may be
argued, than most of his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_215_215"
id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class=
"fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
<p>The purpose of human government is to give to the citizen a
free, a secure, and an ordered life. The means of effecting this
purpose will vary from age to age and from nation to nation, but
one essential will always remain&mdash;an effective central power
"to unite and incorporate the members into one body politic that,
with joint endeavour and abilities, they may the better<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> advance
the common good," and this central power must spring from the
goodwill of the people at large. Montrose found it in a
constitutional monarchy such as he conceived it. "He who keeps
watch and ward for freedom," Coleridge has written, "has to guard
against two enemies, the despotism of the few and the despotism of
the many."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id=
"FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class=
"fnanchor">[216]</a> The second peril in Montrose's day had not
arisen, but the first was an ever-present menace, whether it took
the form of an aristocratic or an ecclesiastical junta. The truth
of his doctrine is not affected by the fact that Britain found a
solution by other methods than those which he foreshadowed. The
hope of a popular monarchy shipwrecked on the character of Charles,
and a religious quarrel in which civil politics were fatally
compromised. If Montrose did not foresee either modern
parliamentaryism or modern democracy, he foresaw the principle
which alone gives them value. They are but means to an end, and
to-day, when parliamentary government has lost much of its glamour,
and criticism is revealing as mere expedients certain democratic
dogmas which once seemed eternal truths, we are being driven back
again to the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Open Burke anywhere. "I see no other way for the preservation of
a decent attention to public interest in the representatives, but
the interposition of the body of the people itself, whenever it
shall appear, by some flagrant and notorious act, by some capital
innovation, that the representatives are going to overleap the
fences of the law, and to introduce an arbitrary power."<a name=
"FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> It is Montrose's
defence, first for signing the National Covenant, and then for
taking up arms against the Covenanters. "Here it says to an
encroaching prerogative, 'Your sceptre has its length, you cannot
add a hair to your head or a gem to your crown but what an eternal
law has given to it!' Here it says to an overweening peerage, 'Your
pride finds banks that it cannot overflow.' Here to a tumultuous
and giddy people, 'There is a bed to the raging sea.'"<a name=
"FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> I<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>t is
Montrose's conception of constitutional law. Or again, "If civil
society be the offspring of convention, that convention must be its
law. That convention must limit and modify all the descriptions of
constitutions which are formed under it. Every sort of legislative,
judicial, or executive power are its creatures. They can have no
being in any other state of things; and how can any man claim,
under the convention of civil society, rights which do not so much
as suppose its existence&mdash;rights which are absolutely
repugnant to it."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id=
"FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class=
"fnanchor">[219]</a> It is Montrose's case against the
encroachments of the Kirk. He saw that in a stable government the
supreme power, while it must be delegated, cannot be made
divisible. The Kirk was willing enough to accept the doctrine of
popular sovereignty, but it did not grasp the inevitable
conclusion&mdash;that the people cannot entrust this power to two
conflicting authorities which may both claim to represent them.
Church and State cannot rule conjointly over the same sphere and
under the same sanctions. Montrose took the historical as opposed
to the metaphysical view of human institutions, and, moreover, in
his practical interpretation he curiously anticipated the modern
attitude. He could have little part in an age when most men
believed that kings and churches and aristocracies were mystically
ordained of God.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1640-42</i></div>
<p>From his first entry into public life Montrose was at variance
with the bulk of the Scottish nobility, but it seems certain that
he began with a real enthusiasm for the Kirk, of which he was a
ruling elder. So long as it stood for spiritual freedom he was its
fervent champion, and this championship, as we have seen, led him
occasionally into courses which were contrary to his political
creed. He had a reverence for godliness, and from such a man as
Alexander Henderson he differed with profound reluctance. His
personal religion was the Calvinism of his age, but he had reached
it, not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id=
"Page_146">[146]</a></span>by the rigid schedule of grim
"experiences" laid down by the Scottish divines, but by the gentler
Platonic method, whereby God reveals Himself insensibly through the
riches of His world, and piety crowns like a flower the natural
growth of mind and soul.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id=
"FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class=
"fnanchor">[220]</a> He had the latitude of Hales or Chillingworth
about inessentials, and his creed was that of the great saying of
Symmachus: "Uno itinere non potest pervenire ad tam grande
secretum." His condemnation was reserved for those who forgot the
spirit in the letter and made religion a thing of scholastic
subtleties. His affinities were with men like the Cambridge
Platonists, whose Calvinism was mellowed and warmed by the love of
humanity and of all things true and beautiful. He would have agreed
with Whichcote that Christ is <i>magister vit&aelig; non schol&aelig;</i>, and
that he is "the best Christian whose heart beats with the truest
pulse towards heaven, not he whose head spinneth out the finest
cobwebs." He had Whichcote's stalwart respect for the freedom of
the mind. When later he criticized the teaching of the Scottish
divines, it was on the ground of their narrow legalism and their
spiritual pride.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id=
"FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class=
"fnanchor">[221]</a></p>
<p>The event which compelled his final breach with the Kirk was its
growing alliance, under Henderson's leadership, with the
Parliamentary party in England, of which the price was to be the
establishment of Pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id=
"Page_147">[147]</a></span>bytery south of the Tweed. The policy,
which culminated in the Solemn League and Covenant, is capable of
defence from the point of view of the perplexed Scottish divines.
The Kirk held that Presbytery was a <i>jus divinum</i>, and it had
the medi&aelig;val belief in religious uniformity as the foundation of
political unity. It had suffered grievously from prelatical
encroachments, and the impetus for such encroachments had come from
England; its liberties could only be safeguarded if England were
brought to its own way of thinking. Moreover, the
Counter-Reformation was making huge strides on the continent of
Europe, and it could be resisted only if there were the closest
unity among all the reformed Churches; and this seemed to involve
the abolition of Anglican anomalies and the reshaping of English
Protestantism according to the universal Protestant pattern.</p>
<p>A man like Henderson was too wise to believe that he could force
Presbytery upon an unwilling England. "We do not presume," he
wrote, "to propose the government of the Church of Scotland as a
pattern for the Church of England, we do only represent in all
modesty these few considerations according to the trust committed
to us." The change must come willingly from within, and he believed
that the greater part of the Anglican Church desired it.<a name=
"FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He was misled by his
English correspondents; he did not&mdash;he could not&mdash;realize
that the great bulk of the English people disliked Laud and the
Anglican extremists, but were attached to a moderate episcopacy,
that the Presbyterian majority in Parliament was not the English
nation, that English Presbyterianism was very different from
Scottish, and that even among the declared opponents of the king
and the bishops there were many stalwart Erastians of the Selden
type, who would not suffer an ecclesiastical discipline
uncontrolled by the civil law. Had Henderson had this knowledge, it
is certain that one who sought above all things the unity and peace
of the two peoples would have refrained from a policy<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> which
was to be the fruitful mother of strife. But there were few
ministers with Henderson's sagacity. To most, the bringing of
England into conformity with their own communion was a direct
command of God, and they devoted themselves to the task with a
fanatic missionary zeal. The new Covenant became a mystical compact
with the Almighty, its acceptance the test of holiness, its
rejection or breach a certain proof of damnation. It was to be
attended by "the voice of harpers harping with their harps, which
shall fill the whole island with melody and mirth." Civil
statesmanship disappears in such a mood, and all that remains is a
frantic theocracy.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id=
"FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class=
"fnanchor">[223]</a> The Kirk, whose spiritual rights had been
threatened by Charles, was now, in the enthusiasm of a regained
independence, proposing to encroach upon the sphere of secular
government.</p>
<p>To Montrose, with his modern conception of the State, both Kirk
and nobles seemed to be marching the straight road to anarchy. The
National Covenant had been an assertion of unquestioned civil and
religious liberties, a united nation, with a reverent
acknowledgment of their Maker, recalling their king to the true
doctrine of kingship. But, in the Solemn League now preparing, the
Kirk had gone far beyond her lawful sphere. He knew the people of
England, and realized that the acceptance by the English Parliament
of Henderson's scheme could only be a price paid for alliance in
rebellion. His way and the Kirk's had come to a sharp parting. The
king, in spite of former blunders, was now constitutionally in the
right, and if war came it was for Montrose, and for all lovers of
law and liberty, to support the central power agains<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>t
anarchic usurpation. If he erred in his view of Charles's character
and aims, the error was justifiable, for in the past three years
the king had appeared to yield all that the National Covenant had
demanded, and to have assented to that historic constitutionalism
which Argyll and the Kirk were now denying by word and deed.</p>
<p>The alternative, as Montrose saw it, was a theocracy on a feudal
basis, an omnipotent Kirk and a free license to a corrupt and
turbulent aristocracy, provided that aristocracy remained orthodox.
How would the "mean people" of Scotland fare under such a r&eacute;gime?
<i>Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi.</i> He looked
around, and saw the wretchedness of their condition. Throughout all
his writings and declarations there rings a note of pity for the
common folk, who had to bear the brunt of their rulers' folly. "Ye
have oppressed the poor, and violently perverted judgment and
justice"&mdash;so ran his last tremendous indictment. Public morals
were at a low ebb;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id=
"FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class=
"fnanchor">[224]</a> nor was there any revival of true spiritual
life, such as had at other times attended a season of religious
wars. The hungry sheep were fed with windy politics. Let us take
one witness, the celebrated Mr. Robert Law, a stout Covenanter who
was ejected from his church in 1662 after the Restoration. "From
the year 1652," he writes, "to the year 1660, there was great good
done by the preaching of the Gospel in the west of Scotland, more
than was observed to have been for twenty or thirty years before; a
great many brought in to Christ Jesus by the saving work of
conversion, which was occasioned through ministers preaching
nothing all that time but the Gospel, and had left off to preach up
parliaments, armies, leagues, resolutions, and
remonstrances."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id=

spirit, and of becoming a <i>hortus siccus</i> of withered
pedantries. Of the Kirk now dominant in Scotland, Cromwell, after
Dunbar, had certain truths to proclaim. "By your hard and subtle
words," he told the ministers, "you have begotten prejudice in
those who do too much in matters of conscience&mdash;wherein every
soul has to answer for itself to God&mdash;depend upon you. Your
own guilt is too much for you to bear.... Is it therefore
infallibly agreeable to the Word of God, all that you say? I

<p>As his path became clearer before him, Montrose, after his
fashion at a crisis in his life, was moved to one of his rare
exercises in verse. He had much leisure during these months, and
spent it at his house of Kincardine with his wife and his sons, of
whom the eldest was now a boy of twelve. Thither came a pleasant
company of neighbours and kinsfolk, Napiers, Erskines, and
Stirlings, and the old hall by the Ruthven Water heard for the last
time the sound of young voices and children's play. At this period
he must have written the lyric by which his name is best known in
our literature. It is a love song, but it is addressed to the
eyebrows of no mortal Sylvia. In his youth ladies had written him
verses, but his marriage was the one romance of his life, and, in
spite of the jealous inquisition of the Kirk, no affair of
gallantry was ever linked with his name. In his ballad the ardour
of the patriot is joined to the passion of the lover in singing of
his mistress, Scotland, and what he will do for her if she trusts
him. It breathes the same spirit as his "Discourse of Sovereignty,"
a hatred of sectarian war, a plea for the unity which had long fled
from his distracted land. Almost every metaphor is drawn from the
language of contemporary politics, but<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> that
language is warmed and coloured by a passion of loyalty&mdash;to an
ideal rather than to a person, for with Montrose, in Plato's words,
the quest of truth did not lack the warmth of desire.</p>

<p>This is the song of a man who has at last found assurance, the
confession of a soul which has a vision of a noble purpose, and

<h2>II</h2>
<p>Montrose was soon to be called to witness to his faith. Charles
returned to London from Scotland in November 1641, to be confronted
with the Grand Remonstrance, which demanded a government
responsible to Parliament, and the summoning of an assembly of
divines to settle the religious problem. On January 4, 1642, he was
guilty of a supreme blunder when, on his queen's advice, he
attempted to enter the Commons and arrest the Five Members. Six
days later he left London, to which he was not destined to return
till he returned to die. The last hope of a peaceful settlement had
gone, and both sides began the raising of armies&mdash;the
Parliament by ordinances, and the king by commissions of array. On
23rd April Sir John Hotham shut the gates of Hull in Charles's
face, and civil war began. On 22nd August the royal standard was
set up at Nottingham, and in that month and from that place the
king wrote to Montrose:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I send Will Murray to Scotland to inform my friends of the
state of my affairs, and to require both their advice and
assistance. You are one whom I have found most faithful, and in
whom I repose greatest trust. Therefore I address him chiefly to
you. You may credit him in what he shall say, both in relation to
my business and to your own; and you must be content with words
until I be able to act. I will say no more but that I am your
loving friend . . ."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id=

</div>
<p>It would have been well for Charles had he trusted
Mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id=
"Page_153">[153]</a></span>ntrose in Scots affairs. But Hamilton,
as we know from Clarendon, had given him assurances that "he would
at least keep that people from doing anything that might seem to
countenance the carriage of the Parliament," and it was to Hamilton
that Murray went. In the previous November the king had appealed to
the Scottish Privy Council for help in dealing with the Irish
rebellion. The Council responded by an energetic levy of troops,
the first batch of which went to Ulster in February 1642, and sent
Lothian and Lindsay to London to attempt to mediate between king
and Parliament. Scotland found herself courted diligently by both
sides, and returned evasive answers. A special meeting of the
Council was held in May 1642, when Montrose and his friends
endeavoured to induce it to stand to its many pledges and refrain
from assisting the Parliament with arms. The presence of the
royalist nobles in Edinburgh raised the usual cry of a design
against the lives of the Covenanting leaders, the gentry and clergy
of Fife flocked to the capital as a bodyguard for the menaced
statesmen, and the Privy Council was confirmed in its cautious
detachment.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id=
"FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class=
"fnanchor">[230]</a></p>
<p>But this detachment could not be kept up for ever. In July the
General Assembly met in St. Andrews, when king and Parliament
renewed their solicitations to the body which especially
represented the opinion of Scotland. The English Puritans did not
ask for a definite alliance, but they declared their detestation of
the English episcopacy, and their earnest desire for "an
advancement of the true religion and such a reformation of the
Church as should be made agreeable to God's Word." This gave the
Assembly its cue; "agreeable to God's Word" must mean
Presbyterianism; so it petitioned the king to labour for "blessed
unity in religion, and uniformity of Church government"&mdash;in
other words, the establishment of Presbytery in England. Argyll was
in command at St. Andrews, and ruled the Assembly as he ruled the
Scottish Parliament. When Murray arrived in the early autumn, he
found Hamilton living in Argyll's company, and negotiating a
marriage between his eldest daughter and Lord Lorn.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> The
Assembly's appeal brought a reply in September, for the English
Parliament voted unanimously that the present government of the
Church of England must be abolished, and that the national Church
must be reconstructed with the aid of an assembly of divines. This
seemed to grant to the Kirk what it had been seeking&mdash;the end
of the hated episcopacy, and Presbytery established from Devon to
Caithness. Small wonder that it leaned to the Parliament's side,
and that the Scottish people, whom it controlled, had the same
bias.</p>
<p>Meantime Edgehill had been fought, and in November the
Parliament applied to Scotland for aid. Charles replied with a
defence of his policy, and Hamilton, roused out of his dreams by
the sudden crisis, and anxious at least to save his country from
naked rebellion, persuaded the Privy Council to publish the royal
declaration. But Argyll insisted that the English Parliament's
appeal should also be published, and there was the usual game of
petition and counter-petition, in which Argyll won. That of
Traquair and Hamilton asked no more than that Scotland should do
nothing to commit itself to the path of disloyalty and civil
war.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> That such a policy
should have been vehemently opposed both by the Assembly and the
Estates shows how Scottish opinion had hardened against the
king.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1642-43</i></div>
<p>It was high time that Charles should know the facts&mdash;that
from Scotland would come no aid for his cause, but only
augmentation to his enemies&mdash;for he could learn nothing from
the vain and obtuse Hamilton. An effort had been made to draw
Montrose again into the Covenant camp. He had no following among
either nobles or people, but his opponents appreciated the strength
of his character and his talents for war, and he was offered, if he
would join them, the lieutenant-generalship of the army, and, says
Wishart, "qu&aelig;cunque alia qu&aelig; su&aelig; forent potestatis."<a name=
"FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The offer must have
come from Argyll, who had the wits to recognize ability, who
desired to have on his side a military<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> genius
which he did not himself possess and which he may well have
believed to be superior to old Leven's, and who must have noted
Montrose's sincere attachment to Presbytery and the reluctance with
which he differed from the Kirk. If Hamilton was privy to it, it
can only have been because he desired to compromise one whom he
hated, for his shallow mind still held to the belief that he could
keep Scotland out of the war. The incident forced Montrose to be up
and doing. The royal cause at the moment was not unprosperous in
the field. In spite of the check at Turnham Green, Charles had
consolidated his position in the Oxford district, Newcastle was
firm in Yorkshire, and Hopton had cleared the south-west. The way
to London might soon be open unless the Scots army took the
royalists in flank from the north. The peril from Scotland must at
once be made known to the king.</p>
<p>In February 1643 Montrose, with Ogilvy and Aboyne, crossed the
Border. The Court was at Oxford, whither Ogilvy and Aboyne
repaired, but Montrose, hearing at Newcastle that the queen was
arriving from Holland, went to meet her at Bridlington Bay. A year
before she had gone to the Hague to sell the crown jewels for
munitions of war, and had now returned with stores and money, to be
greeted in her bedroom by the round shot of the Parliament fleet.
Montrose urged an immediate grant of a royal warrant to authorize a
loyal rising in Scotland. He believed that if Charles struck the
first blow the opposition might be overawed, or at any rate
crippled. Henrietta was too sea-sick and flustered to listen, and
told him that she would discuss the matter at York. But to York had
posted Hamilton and Traquair with their smooth words, and the
distracted lady followed the path of least resistance. Montrose was
dismissed as an alarmist, and Hamilton's optimism
prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id=
"FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class=
"fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1643</i></div>
<p>He had not long to wait for his vindication. Loudoun, Henderson,
and Wariston had gone as a commission to the king at Oxford, to
mediate for peace on the basis of Presbyterian uniformity in
England, and there Henders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>on argued the question of episcopacy
with no less a person than Jeremy Taylor.<a name="FNanchor_234_234"
id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class=
"fnanchor">[234]</a> The commission asked for a Parliament that
summer, though under the grant of triennial parliaments the next
did not fall due till June 1644, and this request Charles refused.
But Argyll had business on hand which could not wait, and on his
own account he arranged for the summoning of a Convention of
Estates on June 22, 1643. Here was an act of rebellion as final as
Sir John Hotham's, but Hamilton persuaded the king to ignore the
breach of prerogative and sanction the meeting, which he himself
attended, to watch, as he said, the royal interests.<a name=
"FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> He had just been
made a duke, to encourage his slack-lipped loyalty.</p>
<p>Montrose did not attend the Convention. For him and his friends
the final parting had come. During the spring of 1643 Argyll's
offer had been renewed. He would be given high military command,
and his debts, mainly incurred in legal expenses, would be paid if
he would join the dominant party. The story reached the ears of the
queen, and in a letter of 31st May she offered him arms from
Denmark and assured him of her confidence, though she had heard
that he had "struck up an alliance with certain persons that might
well create apprehension in my mind."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id=
"FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class=
"fnanchor">[236]</a> In the early days of June Montrose was in the
north with Airlie, Huntly, and Marischal, attempting to form a
coalition&mdash;an attempt frustrated by the lightheadedness of the
latter two. This visit seems to have alarmed Argyll, for he made
one last desperate bid for Montrose's support. If others were blind
to the powers of this young man of thirty, the dictator of Scotland
knew capacity when he met it. He was aware that Montrose had been
snubbed by the queen, and he hoped to catch him on the rebound.
Montrose had not bluntly refused his overtures, but had hinted that
certain scruples stood in his way. To solve them, the Moderator of
the Kirk, Alexander Henderson, was dispatched to interview the
doubter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id=
"Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p>One day in the middle of June he met Montrose in a meadow on the
banks of the Forth near Stirling. It was a curious meeting, the
embarrassed Sir James Rollo,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id=
"FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class=
"fnanchor">[237]</a> brother-in-law of both Montrose and Argyll,
acting as Henderson's second, and Lord Napier, Lord Ogilvy, and
Stirling of Keir being present as witnesses. The Moderator frankly
avowed that the Covenanters were about to send an army to England
in support of the Parliament, and repeated the old offer. "Nothing
was more earnestly desired than that he should join with his peers
and the other estates of the realm; it would bring joy to all, and
not only profit, but also honour to himself. His example would at
once bring over the few, if there were any, who respected the empty
shadow of royalty. As for himself, his most hearty thanks would be
due to God if He would deign to make him the minister and mediator
of so great a work."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id=
"FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class=
"fnanchor">[238]</a> Montrose asked Rollo if Henderson had
authority to make the offer. Rollo said he had, but Henderson said
no, but believed that the Convention would substantiate his
promises. This gave Montrose the chance to avoid a direct refusal.
He replied that in these circumstances he must ask for time to
consider, and took a friendly leave of the man in all Scotland from
whom he was most loth to differ. They never met again. Three years
later, after he had seen Montrose's splendour and decline, as well
as the failure of his own hopes, Henderson died. His last words
were: "I am near the end of my race, hasting home, and there was
never a schoolboy more desirous to have the play than I am to have
leave of this world."</p>
<p>Before the Convention in June, Charles, in a declaration to the
peopl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id=
"Page_158">[158]</a></span>e of Scotland, had stated his case
against the English Parliament, and had solemnly protested his
loyalty to the rights recently assured to the Scottish nation. He
was not believed. The war in Ireland had ceased, and the Kirk
dreaded that an army might thereby be freed for the defence or
restoration of episcopacy. Moreover, Lord Antrim, whose
incompetence rivalled Hamilton's in every field of action, had got
himself captured in Ulster, along with a budget of letters from
Nithsdale, Aboyne, and others. There seemed a risk of a popish
invasion. Scotland was to be overrun by Irish kerns, Charles was to
join hands with Nithsdale on the Solway, Macdonalds and Macleans
were to harass the Campbells, and Huntly and Montrose were to fire
the north. Montrose's recent visit to Aberdeen seemed to give
authority to the tale.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id=
"FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class=
"fnanchor">[239]</a> Moreover, things were going ill with the
English Parliament. In June John Hampden had fallen on Chalgrove
Field, and Fairfax had been defeated in Yorkshire at Adwalton Moor;
in the south-west Hopton had cleared Devon, and in July scattered
Waller's forces at Landsdown and Round way Down, while Bristol, the
second port of the kingdom, was about to fall to Prince Rupert. To
Baillie it seemed that "for the present the Parliament side is
running down the brae." But the Covenanters had gone too far to
draw back: the triumph of the king meant in their eyes summary
vengeance on those who had intrigue with his enemies.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>Formerly the English Parliament had asked chiefly for a
deputation of divines, but in August commissioners from the English
House, among them the younger Vane,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id=
"FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class=
"fnanchor">[240]</a> arrived to ask for an army. The General
Assembly met on 2nd August in a small room in the east kirk of St.
Giles, and to Convention and Assembly was presented the English
demand. The request for 11,000 troops was complied with, Lanark
using the royal seal for a warrant which levied war<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> against
its owner, and the price of this support, a new bond to bind still
closer the two countries, was drafted by Wariston and Henderson.
This document, the Solemn League and Covenant, was accepted by the
Estates, and ratified at Westminster by what was left of the
English House, being thereafter solemnly subscribed in St.
Margaret's Church on September 25, 1643. On 13th October it was
sworn by the Estates and the Assembly, and later by the Scottish
people in the parish kirks. It was signed by English
Parliamentarians, because it was the price of the sorely needed
Scottish help. It was extensively signed in Scotland, because the
authorities saw to it that those who did not sign should suffer in
person and estate.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id=
"FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class=
"fnanchor">[241]</a></p>
<p>The Kirk had seized the chance to realize its dream of
uniformity, but the dream came through the gates of horn, and was
to vanish ere morning. In return Kirk and nobility had involved
their land in a course of hypocrisy and dishonour. They wished both
to have their cake and eat it; in the Solemn League and Covenant,
of which the price was armed rebellion, they vowed also to
"preserve and defend the king's majesty's person and authority."
They had broken a plain contract with the king; was it any defence
to say that they feared lest Charles at some future date might
break his contract with them? Montrose, the day before his death,
put the point to his inquisitors. "When the king had granted you
all your desires, and you were every one sitting under his vine and
under his fig-tree, that then you should have taken a party in
England by the hand, and entered into a league and covenant with
them against the king, was the thing I judged it my duty to oppose
to the yondmost."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id=
"FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class=
"fnanchor">[242]</a> It was not as if the Scots were republicans or
shared the advanced constitutional views of certain of the
Parliamentarians. They were almost to a man confused and
sentimental royalists, and they had been granted every liberty
which they had asked for. The verdict of history must<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> be that
for the sake of an ecclesiastical whimsy the bulk of the nation
chose the path of civic dishonour. The question was not of the
relative wisdom of monarchist or Parliamentarian doctrines, but of
Scotland forswearing a creed, which she avowedly and sincerely
held, for the bribe of a futile dream.</p>
<p>To Montrose the way was clear. To him it seemed that towards
Scotland the king had behaved, though tardily, with justice and
generosity, and had been rewarded by flagrant bad faith. Apart from
the matter of personal honour, he believed that the path which the
Covenant had chosen led only to anarchy and an ultimate tyranny.
Every article of his political philosophy was at stake. The one
hope seemed to lie in Charles's success. He set off at once for the
south, and reached Oxford some time in August. The king had gone to
the siege of Gloucester, and Montrose found that he could do
nothing with the queen. Her trust in Hamilton was unshaken, and on
28th August she wrote to him reaffirming her confidence.<a name=
"FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> He then sought the
king at Gloucester, but the courtiers persuaded Charles that the
young man was an alarmist, and that the scheme he proposed was
moonshine. Meantime the Solemn League and Covenant had been
ratified, Leven was mustering his men, and every day the chance of
forestalling him grew more slender. In an agony of anxiety Montrose
pled and expostulated.</p>
<p>But as the autumn passed and the king returned to Oxford to
winter, the letters of Hamilton and Lanark took a new tone. They
confessed that the game was up, that they had been deceived, that
Leven was on the eve of marching. Charles sent for Montrose at last
and listened to his plan, and Antrim, who had escaped from
captivity, was at hand to promise support. In December the
Hamiltons came to Oxford to brazen it out, and found their conduct
the subject of a commission of inquiry. There could be no question
of the verdict. Montrose and Aboyne, Nithsdale, Kinnoull,<a name=
"FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and Ogilvy were
there to testify to a long course of double-dealing,
supine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id=
"Page_161">[161]</a></span>ness, and folly, which was only saved
from being flat treason by the mental confusion of those who
pursued it. Hamilton was arrested and sent a prisoner to Pendennis
castle in Cornwall; Lanark escaped&mdash;first to London, where he
shared the bed and board of Mr. Robert Baillie, and then to the
Covenant army. At long last the king turned to the only man who
could give him hope.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i></div>
<p>Montrose abode with the court at Oxford during the bitter early
months of 1644,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id=
"FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class=
"fnanchor">[245]</a> and elaborated his plans. It seemed a
desperate remedy. The only project he could offer was to "raise
Scotland for the king"; but it seemed as if Scotland had
effectively risen for the king's opponents. Leven's blue-bonnets
were over the Border, and the whole line of the Marches was
controlled by the Covenanters. They held every city and town in
Scotland; Parliament and General Assembly alike were their
creatures; the revenue of the country was in their hands; the
greater part of the nobles had joined their standard. A year ago
there had been a chance; now it seemed the wildest of wild
ventures. If the Scottish people were tired of their taskmasters
they had given no sign of it, and the supposed loyalists, with a
few shining exceptions, had proved the most brittle of reeds.
Except for Kinnoull, Ogilvy, and Aboyne, Montrose seemed to have no
following even among the royalists of his own class. Huntly
disliked him, Crawford was jealous of him, Traquair feared him; the
nondescripts, like Carnwath, Morton, Southesk, Nithsdale, Roxburgh,
and Home, were disinclined to obey a youth.</p>

<p>But in that strange Oxford, where the colleges had become courts

"FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class=
"fnanchor">[246]</a> there were men like Endymion Porter and Digby,
men in the inner circle of the royal councils, in whom the grave
purpose of the young Scottish earl commanded respect. Among so much
that was self-seeking and half-hearted, his ardour was like a
sea-wind in a stifling room. They had the wit to recognize that a
certain kind of spirit may win against any odds. Hyde, too, was
probably his friend. The future Lord Clarendon detested Scotland
and all things connected with her, but he loved an honest man and a
stout heart; and we know from a letter of Evelyn to Pepys that "the
brave Montrosse" was one of the portraits in his private cabinet at
Cornbury.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id=
"FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class=
"fnanchor">[247]</a> In any case it was no season for prudence, for
Newcastle was in desperate straits in the north. "I will not," said
Montrose, "distrust God's assistance in a righteous cause, and if
it shall please your Majesty to lay your commands upon me for this
purpose, your affairs will at any rate be in no worse case than
they are at present, even if I should not succeed."</p>
<p>He asked for little help. Antrim was to raise troops in Ireland
and the Isles, and land them in the west of Scotland to keep Argyll
occupied in his own country. A body of horse from Newcastle's army
would assist him to cut his way through the Lowlands to the
Highland line. The King of Denmark might lend some German cavalry,
and by hook or by crook a sufficient store of arms and ammunition
must be transported to the north.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id=

king's nephew, Prince Maurice, and Montrose was content to be known
as his lieutenant-general. He knew something of the jealous temper

expedition on an empty name.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id=

<p>The six years of waiting were ended. The fates had cleared the
stage, and the waverer had an issue of his perplexities. Words were
to give place to deeds; the narrow streets of Edinburgh and the
heavy air of conventions and assemblies to the clean winds and the
wide spaces of the hills. He had before him a straight path of
duty, and little it troubled him that it ran into dark shadows.
Once more he had recaptured his boyish ardour, and there was no
happier man in the world than Montrose when, on that March morning,
with the ash buds black in St. John's gardens, he rode north out of
Oxford to win a kingdom.</p>

"FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class=
"fnanchor">[251]</a> but he could give him little more. Montrose
was to raise Scotland for the king, but where was he to find an
army? The best of the semi-professional levies were with Leven in
the north of England. The soldiers of fortune from the German wars
were already for the most part under Leven's banner. He could get
nothing from the towns and villages of the Lowlands, for, whatever
the feeling of the people, the Kirk and the Estates had a firm
control of the machinery of enlistment. As for the nobles, the most
powerful were Covenanters, and even if it had been otherwise, were
far too jealous and self-centred to follow a young man of no higher
rank than their own in a cau<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>se which was, at the best,
forlorn. Did he hope that his words of wisdom, his far-sighted
political doctrines, would carry conviction to a backward
peasantry, harassed by temporal want on the one side and the fear
of eternal punishment on the other? Besides, he proposed to bring
Antrim's Irishry to his aid, and Antrim's Irishry, though most of
them were Scots, seemed to the Lowlands so many emissaries of the
Pope and the devil. With such allies he would not attract a single
doubting Presbyterian to his standard.</p>
<p>As in most great adventures, there was no solid hope save in the
soul of the adventurer. In a desperate case the man who risks most
is usually the wisest, and Montrose staked everything on the speed
and gallantry of his spirit. It seems impossible that at this
period he can have intended to raise the Highlands. He relied on
his kinsmen in Perth and Angus, and he had some hope of the
Gordons. It was the gentry of the northern lowlands&mdash;Grahams,
Drummonds, Erskines, Stirlings, and Ogilvies&mdash;in whom he
trusted, if he trusted in any one besides himself, and not in the
clans of the hills. Probably at the time he knew very little about
the Highlands, and his experience in the Bishops' War cannot have
prepossessed him in favour of the desultory bands who accompanied
Huntly's lowland levies to battle. Had he known more he would not
have been greatly encouraged. Argyll, poor soldier as he was, had
worked his will with Morvern and Badenoch, Atholl and Lochaber. Nor
were there any of the ordinary politics in the hills. The chiefs
were royalists only in as much as they were not Covenanters. He
might indeed count on the assistance, could he reach them, of all
those who hated the name of Campbell&mdash;Clan Chattan, Clan
Donald, the Macleans, the Stuarts, and the Camerons. But Seaforth
and his Mackenzies would never fight on the same side as a
Macdonald, and, if he enlisted the Gordons, he might look to find
the Grants in the other camp.</p>
<p>If Montrose's venture was desperate in purpose, it was no less
desperate in the lack of a base. He <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>was to fling himself into
the midst of a hostile country to improvise an army. Nothing could
be looked for from the king except the royal commission. Even had
Charles been that ideal monarch which certain royalists created out
of their fancy, he could have done little to help his champion. As
it was, he passed from blunder to blunder, enraging by his
obtuseness and duplicity both friend and foe. The man who fought
for a Stuart must be content to wage war without reserves. His life
and his reputation alike must be in his own keeping.</p>
<p>Crawford, Reay, Nithsdale, Ogilvy, and Aboyne accompanied
Montrose as he rode out from Oxford, on his way to Newcastle's
camp. The two first presently turned off with a squadron of horse
towards Shrewsbury. Arrived at York, Montrose found that Newcastle
was at Durham, so he sent on Colonel Cochrane to acquaint him with
the king's commission and his need of men and money. The reply came
that at Durham there was little of either, and the king's
lieutenant-general, on March 15th, proceeded thither to reason with
the royalist commander. Already the news of his coming north had
sent Argyll post-haste into Scotland, whither, Montrose wrote to
Sir Robert Spottiswoode at Oxford, "we intend to make all possible
dispatch to follow him at his heels, in whatever posture we
can."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Newcastle, the great
potentate of the north-east, now a marquis and after the
Restoration to be a duke, was a man of sumptuous and scholarly
tastes, a devout loyalist, and brave and scrupulous in all the
relations of life. He was the idol of his second wife, but in her
praise of his gentility, "which hath something in it of
grandeur,"<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id=
"FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class=
"fnanchor">[253]</a> we can detect the source of his failure. He
was too fine for the rough task before him&mdash;the complete
dilettante, who, in Clarendon's words, "the articles of action no
sooner over, returned to his delightful company, music, and the
softer pleasures."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id=
"FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class=
"fnanchor">[254]</a> As a soldier he was neither fortunate nor
skilful, for he had no experience of war.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>On 19th January Leven, with 18,000 foot and more than 3,000
horse, had crossed Tweed. He halted for three weeks before the town
of Newcastle, and then on 28th February the bulk of his army,
assisted by the prayers of Mr. Robert Baillie in far-away London,
forded Tyne. By 2nd March he was across the Wear, and two days
later entered Sunderland. Newcastle, who had only 5,000 foot and
3,000 horse, was opportunely strengthened by the arrival of Sir
Charles Lucas, made a feeble demonstration against him, and then
fell back on Durham. Leven followed, but finding his commissariat
difficult in that devastated country, remained in the district
between Tyne and Wear, and decided to lay siege to the positions
which guarded the mouth of the former river. The marquis, when
Montrose arrived, was in the worst of spirits. The town of
Newcastle still held out, but Leven was at its gates, and
Manchester and Fairfax were closing up on him from the south. Even
as against the Scots he was outnumbered, and he might soon be
caught between two formidable fires. He was in no condition to
spare a silver piece or a man.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as a great nobleman, he honoured the king's
commission and did his best. A hundred ill-mounted troopers and two
small brass cannon were the most the perplexed commander could
spare Montrose for the conquest of Scotland. He called out for him,
however, the militia of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and sundry
local gentlemen were willing to join his standard. Another
disappointment was in store, for Carnwath, who happened to be in
Newcastle's camp, refused to accept from Montrose's hand the royal
commission as lieutenant of Clydesdale. It was a foretaste of the
spirit of even the loyal among the Scots nobles. There was a
curious wildness in the Carnwath family, conspicuous even in a wild
age. At the head of a troop of horse rode a certain Mrs. Pierson,
who passed as Carnwath's daughter, and whose commission was made
out in the name of Captain Francis Dalziel. Her cornet carried a
black banner, which displayed on a sable field a naked man hanging
from a gibbet, under the motto<span class="pagenum"><a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> March-April</div>
<p>Montrose's coming stirred the Marquis of Newcastle to action.
Leven, at the mouth of the Tyne, was cut off from his base and his
heavy guns at Sunderland. Here was a chance for a bold stroke, so
on 23rd March he advanced to Chester-le-street, and next day took
up position at Hilton north of the Wear, a few miles from
Sunderland, with Leven on a hill to the east. But even Montrose's
influence could not put speed into Newcastle's languid soul. There
was an artillery duel and some fighting between advanced troops,
but on the 25th Newcastle suddenly drew off towards Durham, and
Leven was enabled to inflict considerable damage on his rear.
Presently the news of Fairfax's approach caused the marquis to
hasten south to York.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> April</div>
<p>With Newcastle's campaign Montrose had no concern, for his
business lay north of the Border. He marched towards Carlisle with
200 horse, mostly gentlemen who had served in the foreign wars;
Crawford of the fierce counsels, Nithsdale, Ogilvy, and Aboyne were
with him, and Captain Francis Dalziel with her grisly
banner.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id=
"FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class=
"fnanchor">[256]</a> The Cumberland and Westmoreland men, 800 foot
and three troops of horse, joined him on the road, and on 13th
April he led a force of some 1,300 men across the Border. But he
had not forded Annan before trouble began. Most of the English
militia, worked upon by the emissaries of Sir Richard
Graham,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id=
"FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class=
"fnanchor">[257]</a> deserted, and the loss was not atoned for by
the accession of Lord Herries with a small following. With his
little force of a few hundreds Montrose reached Dumfries, and
occupied the town without opposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> The provost, one John
Corsane,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id=

five years' trouble with the Estates and the Kirk.</p>
<p>It was at once apparent that nothing could be done in the
southern Lowlands. The Maxwell and Johnstones of the Dumfries
neighbourhood were in no mood to rise, and their
heads&mdash;Nithsdale and Hartfell&mdash;were jealous of the new
commander. Annandale, Morton, Roxburgh, and Traquair, though
nominally royalists, refused, like Carnwath, the king's commissions
of lieutenancy, by means of which Montrose had hoped to organize a
formidable opposition.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id=
"FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class=
"fnanchor">[259]</a> Farther east Lothian was hot for the
Parliament, and the "bauld Buccleuch," a young man of eighteen, was
commanding&mdash;with no particular credit to himself&mdash;a
regiment under Leven. The peasantry of Dumfries were under the
thumb of the ministers and of fickle noblemen like Glencairn.
Montrose issued a declaration, headed by the device which appears
on the cover of this volume, explaining that he was now in arms for
the king on the same principle as he had once been in arms for the
Covenant&mdash;"for the defence and maintenance of the true
Protestant religion, his Majesty's just and sacred authority, the
fundamental laws and privileges of Parliament, the peace and
freedom of the oppressed and enthralled subject." "Knew I not
perfectly," he added, "his Majesty's intentions to be such, and so
real as is already expressed, I should never have embarked myself
at all in his service. Nor, did I but see the least appearance of
his Majesty's change from these resolutions or any of them, I
should never continue longer my faithful endeavour in it."<a name=

"#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> His case was
unanswerable; he stood in the direct tradition of the National
Covenan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id=
"Page_173">[173]</a></span>t and of the spirit of the Glasgow
Assembly. But he was speaking a tongue which the burghers of
Dumfries, and for that matter the Scottish people, did not
understand. "It was not," in Mr. Gardiner's words, "for the
restoration of a dead past that he drew the sword. He stood up for
that which was, in some sort, the hope of the future."<a name=
"FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> And the language of
the future is always strange to contemporary ears.</p>
<p>Montrose lingered on, waiting for news of Antrim's men, from
which it would appear that Galloway, as well as Argyll, was their
objective. But no news came and his hopes sank, for Antrim had
always been uncertain as the wind. He received, however, a message
of another kind&mdash;from his niece, Lady Stirling of
Keir&mdash;inviting him, on behalf of the commander, Lord Sinclair,
to take possession of the castle of Stirling and the town of Perth.
Sinclair and his second in command, Sir James Turner,<a name=
"FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> were probably
sincere in their offer, but it was fortunate for Montrose that he
did not attempt to accept it. For the Covenant had got wind of the
intention of the pair, and, while Montrose was reading his niece's
letter, Callander, with Sinclair and Turner in tow, was marching
south. Callander, who had once been Almond and a party to the
Cumbernauld Bond, presently occupied Dumfries, while Montrose and
his handful recrossed the Esk. They barely escaped, and had to
leave some of their guns in Annandale.<a name="FNanchor_263_263"
id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class=
"fnanchor">[263]</a> Meanwhile two events had befallen the royalist
leader. He had received his patent of marquis from the king, and
had been excommunicated by the Kirk in Edinburgh. The latter honour
was also conferred at the same time upon Huntly, who had just been
conducting an aimless and confused rising in the north, and was now
hiding from Argyll in Strathnaver.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> May-June</div>
<p>There was no course open to Montrose except to wait for Scottish
news on English soil, while he kept Callander and his 7,000 levies
busy on the western Marches, and to strike a blow, if occasion
offered, on behalf of the hard-pressed Marquis of Newcastle. He had
no illusions about either that general or the royalist troops in
the north of England. He had seen the quality of the Cumberland and
Westmoreland militia, most of the gentry were watching the omens,
and the Percy's spur was cold in Northumbria. The centre of the war
was shifting into Yorkshire, but Montrose's duty was to keep close
to Scotland, and his task was only desultory Border fighting. It
was sufficient, however, to inspire acute anxiety in the breast of
Mr. Robert Baillie and the Covenant leaders.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> June-July</div>
<p>If Newcastle was to be retained and the position of its marquis
improved at York, a blow must be struck forthwith in the north. The
town of Morpeth was strongly held by a Covenanting garrison under
Somerville of Drum (afterwards the tenth Lord Somerville), and on
10th May Montrose marched against it, assisted by Colonel
Clavering, and with Crawford as his intractable colleague. He
attempted to carry the place by assault, was repulsed, and then,
after bringing up six guns from Newcastle, breached its defence and
entered it on 29th May. The air was full of wild rumours, and to a
certain Captain John MacCulloch, who parleyed with him, Montrose
gave a romantic account of a great disaster to Leven at York, and
of the success of the royalists in Scotland.<a name=
"FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The garrison was
disarmed and dismissed, and after the surrender Montrose
entertained the governor to dinner. He then recaptured the fort at
South Shields which Leven had taken on 20th March, and attacked
Sunderland, where he was checked by the energy of its seamen and
the cavalry sent by Leven from York.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id=

for so long as he had the Marquis of Newcastle to deal with he
could do little against Montrose. His only hope was<span class=

Callander, who was making his leisurely way from the western
Border.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id=

"fnanchor">[267]</a> Montrose was collecting provisions from the
Alnwick neighbourhood and succeeding in getting them into the
beleaguered Newcastle, when at the end of June he received a
peremptory summons to join Prince Rupert, who was marching through
Lancashire to the relief of York.</p>
<p>Rupert did not wait for Montrose. He relieved York indeed, but
before he and Montrose met the king's arms had suffered their first
crushing disaster. On 2nd July, about five in the afternoon, he
engaged the Parliament forces at Marston Moor, and discovered that
new thing in England&mdash;the shock of Cromwell's horse. The
Huntingdonshire grazier, turned parliamentarian, had made himself
also a great soldier, and had hammered into being an army to suit
his purpose. On that fierce day David Leslie also wrought famously,
and disputes as to the true architect of victory did not improve
relations between Scots and English.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id=
"FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class=

overseas, and Rupert, lamenting the loss in action of his white dog
which Puritans believed to be his familiar spirit,<a name=
"FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> rode with some 6,000
troops into the western hills. Two days after the battle Montrose
found him in an inn at Richmond. "Give me a thousand of your
horse," he said, "and I will cut my way into the heart of
Scotland." But Rupert had nothing to give; on the contrary, he
stood much in need of Montrose's scanty recruits. So with a sad
heart the new marquis rode by Brough and Appleby to Carlisle to
indite his report to the king. The western Marches were now safer
for him, since Callander had gone east to Newcastle.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> July-Aug.</div>
<p>Four months had passed and nothing had been done. Ogilvy and Sir
William Rollo had journeyed secretly into Scotland, and had
returned with ill news. The land lay quiet under the Covenant, and
Antrim's levies seemed to have vanished into the mist. The nobles,
headed by Traquair, were tumbling over each other <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>in their
anxiety to swear fealty to Argyll. There seemed nothing to be done
except to surrender the royal commission, and to wait abroad for a
happier time. So his friends advised, and Montrose made a pretence
of acquiescing. He set out for Oxford with the rest, having taken
Ogilvy (and later Aboyne) into his confidence. A little way from
Carlisle he slipped behind, but as his servants and baggage went on
it was presumed that he was following. Had he continued, he would
have shared in the capture of the whole party by Fairfax at Ribble
bridge.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id=
"FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class=
"fnanchor">[270]</a></p>
<p>He had resolved on the craziest of ventures. He would break
through the Covenant cordon in the Lowlands, and win to his own
country. There, at any rate, were loyal hearts, and something might
be devised to turn the tide. He chose as his companions the lame
Sir William Rollo and an officer, Colonel Sibbald, who had fought
under him in the Bishops' War. They wore the dress of Leven's
troopers, while Montrose followed behind as their groom, riding one
ill-conditioned beast and leading another.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> August</div>
<p>It was a dangerous road to travel. The country was strewn with
broken men and patrolled by Covenant horse, and a gentleman in
those days was not easily disguised. At first all went smoothly.
Passing through the woods of Netherby, they learned that Sir
Richard Graham had joined the Covenant, and in its interests had
constituted himself Warden of the Marches. His servant, from whom
they had the news, spoke freely, as if to Leven's troopers. A
little farther on they fell in with a Scot, one of Newcastle's
soldiers, who disregarded the troopers but paid great attention to
their groom, hailing him by his proper title. Montrose tried to
deny it, but the man exclaimed, "What, do I not know my Lord
Marquis of Montrose well enough? But go your way, and God be with
you!" A gold piece rewarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> the untimely well-wisher.</p>
<p>The journey must have grown hourly more anxious till the Forth
was passed. "It may be thought," wrote Patrick Gordon, "that God
Almighty sent His good angel to lead the way, for he went, as if a
cloud environed him, through all his enemies."<a name=
"FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> We do not know the
road they travelled&mdash;whether by Annandale and the springs of
Tweed and Clyde, or up Eskdale and thence over the Tweedside range
to the Lothians. The safest route was probably by the belt of bleak
moorland which runs north by Carnwath almost to the Highland hills.
Riding chiefly by night, the party made good progress. On the
fourth day they came to the Montrose lands in Stirling and
Strathearn, but they did not draw rein till they reached the house
of Tullibelton, between Perth and Dunkeld. Here lived Patrick
Graham of Inchbrakie, he who had seen to the ordering of Montrose's
little library at St. Andrews, and here was safe shelter for the
traveller while he spied out the land and looked about for a
following.</p>
<p>It was the hour of portents. Airy armies were seen to contend on
a hill in Banff; in Buchan the sun shone clear at midnight, and a
kirk was filled with a choir of unearthly music; a cannon shot
echoed over the whole kingdom to warn men that an invader was
landing in the west.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id=

curtain rises, and the first act of the great drama reveals a
forlorn little party late on an August evening knocking at the door
of a woodland tower above the shining reaches of Tay. The king's
lieutenant-general makes a very modest entrance on the scene. Two
followers, four sorry horses, little money and no baggage seem a
slender outfit for the conquest of a kingdom; but in six months he
had Scotland at his feet.</p>

<br>
<h2>I</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> August</div>
<p>For six days the king's lieutenant lay close in hiding while his
comrades scoured the country for news. Tullibelton was too near the
lowland town of Perth, and its laird too noted a loyalist for his
guest to run needless risks, and Montrose spent most of his time
among the woods and hills, sleeping at night in hunters' bothies,
and soothing his soul with the lights and colours of a Scottish
autumn. The scouts returned with a melancholy tale. Huntly had
failed ruinously in the north, and the Gordons were leaderless and
divided, while the influence of their uncle, Argyll, was driving
Huntly's sons to the Covenant camp. Some of the Graham and Drummond
kinsmen even, with the alternative of prison and fines before them,
were in arms for the Estates. There were rumours of Covenant levies
in Aberdeenshire, and in the west Argyll had his clan in arms.
Montrose in his despondency may well have wondered at this strange
activity. The tide of war had rolled over the Border, and with
Scotland in so iron a grip such precautions must have seemed odd to
one who knew the economical spirit of his opponents.</p>
<p>He was soon to learn the reason, and at the same time to
recognize his opportunity. The incident is b<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>est told
in the words of Patrick Gordon, who had the story from Montrose's
own lips:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"As he was one day in Methven Wood, staying for the night,
because there was no safe travelling by day, he became transported
with sadness, grief, and pity to see his native country thus
brought into miserable bondage and slavery through the turbulent
and blind zeal of some preachers, and now persecuted by the
unlawful and ambitious ends of some of the nobility; and so far had
they already prevailed that the event was much to be feared, and
for good patriots ever to be lamented. And, therefore, in a deep
grief and unwonted ravishment, he besought the Divine Majesty, with
watery eyes and a sorrowful heart, that His justly kindled
indignation might be appeased and His mercy extended, the curse
removed, and that it might please Him to make him a humble
instrument therein, to His Holy and Divine Majesty's greater glory.
. . . While he was in this thought, lifting up his eyes he beheld a
man coming the way to St. Johnstoune (Perth), with a fiery cross in
his hand, and, hastily stepping towards him, he inquired what the
matter meant. The messenger told him that Coll Mac
Gillespick&mdash;for so was Alexander Macdonald called by the
Highlanders&mdash;was entered in Atholl with a great army of
Irishes, and threatened to burn the whole country if they did not
arise with him against the Covenant, and he was sent to advertise
St. Johnstoune, that all the country might be raised to resist
him."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Antrim's levies had come out of the mist at last.</p>
<p>Presently Montrose received a letter from Alasdair Macdonald
himself, directed to the king's lieutenant-general at Carlisle. The
messenger who carried it asked directions from Inchbrakie, who took
the dispatch and promised to deliver it. In the letter Macdonald
announced his arrival and begged for instructions. If Montrose
needed help, no less did the Irish commander.</p>
<p>Alasdair Macdonald was of the ancient stock of Dunyveg in Islay,
the son of Macdonald of Colonsay, commonly called Coll Keitach, or
"Coll who can fight with either hand." The name, corrupted into
Colkitto, was transferred by the Lowlanders (like the Gruamach
appellation in the case of Argyll) from the father to the son.
Sorley Boy Macdonald, the father of the first Earl of Antrim, had
been his father's great-uncle. The Macdonnells of Antrim were near
blood-relations of Alasdair's own people of Islay and Kintyre, and
th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id=

had left bitter memories on both sides of the North Channel.
Alasdair was a man of herculean strength and proven courage;
self-indulgent and somewhat inclined to drunkenness; obtuse and
incapable of framing or understanding any complex strategy: "no
sojer," wrote Sir James Turner, "though stout enough."<a name=

"#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> But he was a born
leader of men, and so impressed Leven in Ireland that he did his
best to reconcile him to Argyll, and sent him to Scotland for the
purpose. But the chief of the Campbells treated the Irish commander
with contempt, and Alasdair returned to Ulster with all his
hereditary grievances inflamed, and burning for revenge.<a name=

"#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>
<p>Antrim, whom Clarendon thought a man "of excessive pride and
vanity, and of a marvellously weak and narrow understanding," had
been conspicuous for his large promise and meagre performance. The
clan of Macdonnell had a hard life under the fruitless escapades of
their chief; "we are worn spectre-thin," sang their bard, "by the
earl's oft frequenting of the wave."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id=
"FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class=
"fnanchor">[276]</a> But now at last he was to influence the course
of history. After many difficulties he raised, by the end of June
1644, 1,600 recruits among the exiled Macdonalds and Macleans, and
he invited Alasdair to lead them against the ancestral foe. Early
in July the invaders landed in Ardnamurchan, an old territory of
the Macdonalds, and proceeded to exact vengeance on the unfortunate
Campbell settlers. The king's quarrel was forgotten in a more
intimate and personal strife. Alasdair ravaged the peninsula with
fire and sword, and seized as a base the castle of Mingary on Loch
Sunart, and the keep of Lochaline, which still stands where the
little river Aline enters its sea-loch. He sent messengers
throughout the West Highlands to summon the clans to help him in
his task. But there was no response; Macdonalds and Macleans,
Macleods and Macneils, were alike silent; the hand of Clan Diarmaid
lay too heavy on the mainland and the isles.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon his position became desperate, for Argyll was raising an
army of pursuit; so he swept back to his base, only to find that
all his ships had been destroyed. Alasdair, whatever his defects as
a general, was a bold fighting man; his only hope was the Gordons,
and he resolved to bid for their support though it meant marching
across the breadth of Scotland. Accordingly he led his forces
through Morvern and round by the head of Loch Eil to the Lochaber
glens, the western fringe of Huntly's country. Here he had his
second piece of ill tidings. Huntly's revolt was over, and the
Gordons had made their peace with the Covenant. There was nothing
for it but to try the more northern clans, and his next venture was
Kintail. But the Mackenzies, little though they loved the
Campbells, had a long memory of Macdonald misdeeds, and their
chief, Seaforth, warned off the intruders.</p>
<p>Headed back on all sides, Alasdair decided that the boldest
course was the safest. He marched south again to Badenoch and the
head waters of Spey, and himself issued a summons, calling upon the
clans to rise in the name of the king and Huntly. This brought him
some 500 recruits, most of them Gordons; but he could get no nearer
to the heart of that powerful clan, for the Grants, Forbeses, and
Frasers blocked the road down Spey, and a thousand of Seaforth's
Mackenzies lent their aid. Alasdair now seemed in a fair way for
destruction. The Campbells intercepted his retreat to the sea, and
Argyll was hot-foot on his track. Seaforth cut him off from the
north and east, the new Badenoch levies were mutinous and
distrustful, and south lay the unfriendly Lowlands, and clans like
the Stewarts of Atholl, who would never serve under an alien
tartan. He had proved that whoever might band the Highlands into an
army, it would not be a man of Highland blood. Hence his despairing
letter to the king's lieutenant-general asking for help and
instructions. He can scarcely have hoped for much from his appeal,
for Carlisle was far from Badenoch and he had the enemy on every
side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id=
"Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>Montrose sent back an answer, bidding Alasdair be of good heart
and meet him at Blair. It must have seemed a hard saying to a man
who believed that his correspondent was still at Carlisle, but he
obeyed, and, guided by a Clanranald man,<a name="FNanchor_277_277"
id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class=
"fnanchor">[277]</a> one Donald the Fair, who had seen service in
the German wars, he marched into the braes of Atholl. The local
clans resented his intrusion, the fiery cross was sent round, and
there was every likelihood of a desperate conflict between two
forces who alike detested the Covenant and followed the king. The
Irish were stout fellows in hard condition, but they were uncouthly
dressed, wild-eyed from long travel, and, after their custom,
attended by a mob of half-starved women and children. The Atholl
clans, living on the edge of the Lowlands, may well have looked
askance at such outlandish warriors. Moreover, Alasdair's men were
Catholics, and the Reformation in some sort had come to Atholl, as
had tales of Irish barbarities in the recent rebellion. The Earl of
Atholl was a minor, and the pressure of Argyll kept the leaderless
clan quiet, in spite of long memories of Campbell reivings and
burnings. Donald Robertson, the Tutor of Struan, seems to have
joined Alasdair at once,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id=
"FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class=
"fnanchor">[278]</a> but the Robertsons as a clan held aloof; and
when the Irish had taken the castle of Blair, they were faced by
angry and watchful levies, waiting for the word to make an end of
them.</p>
<p>The situation was saved by a hairbreadth. Montrose, accompanied
by Patrick Graham, the younger, of Inchbrakie&mdash;Black Pate, the
countryside called him&mdash;set out to walk the twenty miles of
hill between Blair and Tullibelton to keep the tryst. He had
acquired from Inchbrakie a Highland dress&mdash;the trews, a short
coat, and a plaid for the shoulders; he wore a blue bonnet with a
bunch of oats as a badge, and he carried a broadsword and a
Highland buckler. Thus accoutred, he entered suddenly upon the
scene in the true manner of romance. Alasdair and his ragged troops
were waiting hourly upon battle, when across the moor, between the
hostile camps, they saw two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183"
id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> figures advancing. Black Pate was
known to every Atholl man, and there were many who had seen
Montrose. Loud shouts of welcome apprised the Ulsterman that here
was no bonnet-laird, but when he heard that it was indeed the
king's lieutenant he could scarcely credit the news. He believed
him to be still on the road from Carlisle, and he had looked for
cavalry, an imposing bodyguard, and a figure more like his own
swashbuckling self than this slim young man with the quiet face and
the searching grey eyes.</p>
<p>In a moment all quarrels were forgotten. Montrose revealed his
commission, and Alasdair gladly took service under him, thankful to
be out of a plight which for weeks had looked hopeless. The Atholl
clans were carried off their feet by the grace and confidence of
their new leader, and the Stewarts and Robertsons brought to his
side those broadswords which an hour before had been dedicated to
cutting Ulster throats. Montrose slept the night at the house of
Lude, and next morning unfurled the royal standard on a green knoll
above the Tilt. The king's lieutenant had got him an army.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>We pause, on the eve of Montrose's campaign, to consider the
conditions under which, in that era, battles were fought. Some
knowledge of the methods of war in the fifth decade of the
seventeenth century is necessary if we are to understand the
magnitude of Montrose's achievement and the causes of his
success.</p>
<p>It was an age when, in both Scotland and England, relatively to
the population, surprisingly large numbers of men were called to
arms, but only a small proportion was brought into action.<a name=
"FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Difficulties of
transport, when roads were few and bad; an imperfect intelligence
system; the necessity of masking fortresses and protecting
communications; pay chronically in arrears; the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> absence
of a strong central authority on either side, and the dissipation
of effort in divergent operations; the lack of any adequate
provision for recruiting losses&mdash;such were the main reasons
why the opposing strengths were so slow in forcing a decisive
issue. Success must fall to the man who could best overcome or
disregard these handicaps, who could move his troops fast and far,
who had early news of his enemy's plans, who had no civil problems
to perplex him, whose levies had an inducement to fight other than
their pay, and who could concentrate all his powers on a single
purpose.</p>
<p>Infantry were still held in less esteem than cavalry. A foot
regiment consisted of musketeers and pikemen in the proportion of
two of the former to one of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_280_280"
id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class=
"fnanchor">[280]</a> The pikemen wore iron corselets and
headpieces, and carried pike and sword, and their chief business
was, as at Marston Moor, to repel a cavalry charge. They were heavy
troops, and for rapid work the musketeer, who had no body armour,
was coming into favour. The musket of the period was still, for the
most part, the old matchlock, which required an elaborate rest. It
fired a bullet which weighed about an ounce and a quarter, took a
long time to load and discharge, and had a range not exceeding 400
yards. It demanded a great deal of match, and in the enemy's
neighbourhood it was necessary to keep the match lighted, so that
the troops were at the mercy of the weather.<a name=
"FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The defects of the
matchlock were bringing the flintlock into fashion, and in the
Parliament armies the latter was employed for cavalry carbines and
pistols and for special companies detailed to guard the artillery.
The flintlock was primarily a sportsman's weapon, and must have
been used by many private citizens when the regular army weapon was
the matchlock. There were certainly flintlocks in the Scottish
cavalry in 1644.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id=
"FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class=
"fnanchor">[282]</a> An infantry regiment being composed of
musketeers interspersed with pikemen, its effic<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>iency
depended upon an exact discipline which could combine the movements
of both arms. Only then could it hope, like the regiments of
Maitland and Lindsay at Marston Moor, to beat back a charge of
horse.</p>
<p>The infantry formation was conditioned by the time which a
musketeer required to load and fire, for it was the custom for the
first rank to discharge their pieces and then fall to the rear to
reload. The ordinary formation at this time was six deep, but in an
emergency the files might be reduced to three, to prevent
outflanking or to obtain a broader front of fire. At first only one
rank fired at a time, till Gustavus Adolphus introduced the fashion
of three ranks firing simultaneously, the first kneeling, the
second stooping, and the third standing upright. But armies are
conservative things, and, in spite of the lesson of Leipsic, it was
not till Cromwell's New Model that the method became the accepted
practice in Britain. Montrose used it, being in this, as in other
things, a reformer.</p>
<p>Infantry tactics were elaborate. Since distinctive uniforms were
unknown, it was necessary to have badges,<a name="FNanchor_283_283"
id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class=
"fnanchor">[283]</a> and watchwords or "field signs." These being
settled, an action usually began by sending out a body of
musketeers, called a "forlorn hope," who fired and fell back. When
the main bodies came into touch the musketeers delivered a couple
of volleys, and then the pikemen charged. This was for a pitched
battle; in lesser engagements there might be something like open
order, the troops taking shelter in ditches and behind hedges, as
at Worcester.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id=
"FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class=
"fnanchor">[284]</a> Such cover was eagerly sought by the foot, for
it was the best preventive of a cavalry charge. The ordinary
soldier marched slowly, for he carried a monstrous weight&mdash;at
least double the forty pounds of to-day, and in the case of the
pikemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186">[186]</a></span> far more. The longest day's march of
the New Model during 1645-46 seems to have been thirteen
miles.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>
<p>The mounted arm was then at the height of its fame, and the
current view was that in a well-equipped army the horse should in
numbers be not less than half the foot. In England the old heavy
cavalry were becoming obsolete, and their place taken by
harquebusiers, who carried sword, pistols, and carbine, and by
lightly armed dragoons, who were to all intents mounted infantry.
They wore a light steel casque, a light cuirass, or often only a
padded buff coat. Scotland stood to the old ways, and still armed
her horse with four pistols, a carbine, and a lance.<a name=
"FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The light horse did
the outpost work of the army, reconnoitred, seized bridges and
passes in an advance, and covered a retirement. In action a cavalry
charge was at first made slowly, at a trot rather than a gallop,
and trusted largely to the volley from the saddle. The old
formation was five deep; this Gustavus reduced to three, and his
example was beginning to be followed in England, as also his
instructions to cavalry to reserve their fire, to charge at top
speed, and to charge home. Rupert owed much of his early success to
adopting the Swedish plan, and Montrose followed suit.<a name=
"FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Rupert also insisted
upon cavalry taking the offensive, and both he and Cromwell
anticipated the later shock tactics.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id=
"FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class=
"fnanchor">[288]</a> The charge was always made in close order,
knee to knee. The Scottish cavalry had no Rupert to make tactical
experiments, and had to wait for reform till David Leslie copied
the methods of the New Model.</p>
<p>The field gun employed varied from the culverin, which fired a
ball of nearly twenty pounds, had an extreme range of about 2,000
paces, and needed eight horses to move it, down to the little
three-pounder.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id=
"FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class=
"fnanchor">[289]</a> Loading a heavy piece was a cumbrous and
perilous business, since the powder was usually carried
loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id=
"Page_187">[187]</a></span>ly in a barrel. Scotland began by having
a powerful artillery train, for Leven had learned from Gustavus the
scientific use of that arm. His master of ordnance, Sir Alexander
Hamilton ("dear Sandy" to his countrymen), had an ingenious turn,
and in 1644 had invented a new kind of light twelve-pounder, which
a single horse could carry.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id=
"FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class=
"fnanchor">[290]</a> Though the New Model siege train was one of
the chief factors in bringing the Civil War in England to an end,
it cannot be said that cannon played a decisive part in the field,
except at Langport in 1645. In Scotland, after her great effort in
equipping Leven, it would seem that the zest for artillery was
relaxed, and at Preston the Scots had not a single gun of any
kind&mdash;"dear Sandy being grown old and doated, and giving no
fitting orders for these things."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id=
"FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class=
"fnanchor">[291]</a> Yet the mere possession of field-guns, however
antiquated and badly handled, was a conspicuous asset against a
Highland force. The Highlander detested the "musket's mother" as
something outside the decent order of things, and needed much
persuasion before he would face cannon.<a name="FNanchor_292_292"
id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class=
"fnanchor">[292]</a></p>
<p>The army's intelligence was in the hands of the
scoutmaster-general, but whatever the energy of this officer, he
had in Lowland and English scouts material not comparable to that
afforded by the Highland clans, to whom the most daring espionage
was the breath of life. . . . Every regiment dressed as its
commander ordained, but red was coming in fast; in Scotland the
usual wear was probably hodden-grey, except for the officers and
the cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id=
"FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class=
"fnanchor">[293]</a> . . . The common soldier's food was bread and
cheese, except in garrison; the articles of war enjoined payment
for all supplies commandeered, but the pay-chest was often empty. .
. .<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id=
"Page_188">[188]</a></span> Discipline was provided for by
elaborate military codes, such as the one which Leven promulgated
in 1644, which, in addition to much that was sensible and humane,
enjoined the formation of a kirk-session in every regiment.<a name=
"FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Religion was amply
provided for in the armies of both king and Parliament, but Baillie
laments that in 1644 it was hard to get enough ministers.<a name=

"#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The army chaplain of

"#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
<p>Such is a rough sketch of the constitution of the regular armies
of Scotland and England in the year 1644. The pick of the Scottish
regulars were with Leven, who in January had taken across the
Border twenty-one regiments of foot, nine troops of horse, a
regiment of dragoons, and an artillery train.<a name=
"FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> What Montrose had to
meet was the Scottish second-line army, the home-defence force,
raised and equipped like the first line, but a little ruder,
clumsier, less disciplined. His own command was meagre and shabby
in the extreme. Alasdair had about 1,100 men divided into three
regiments&mdash;men who might be called regular soldiers, inured to
discipline, and seasoned by hard campaigns. They had firearms, for
the most part ancient matchlocks, an occasional claymore, and a
variety of pikes and cudgels. The Badenoch men, mainly Gordons and
Keppoch Macdonalds,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id=
"FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class=
"fnanchor">[298]</a> numbered perhaps 300, and the Atholl clans
provided another 800; both, at their own request, were commanded by
young Inchbrakie. Of this total of 2,200, nearly half&mdash;the
Highland contingent&mdash;were most inadequately armed. Some of the
gentry may have carried flintlocks, there were a good many
claymores, but the weapons of most were clubs and bows and arrows.
These Highland warriors presented the same picture as the Highland
contingent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id=
"Page_189">[189]</a></span> Leven's army of 1641&mdash;lean,
red-shanked mountaineers, plaided, armed with sword and bow, such
deadly marksmen that with the latter they could kill a running
deer.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Nor was the lack of
firearms all; ammunition was so scarce that only one round could be
provided for such weapons as they possessed. There was no artillery
of any kind, and not a plack in the treasury. The cavalry was
limited to three horses, perhaps the unfortunate beasts which had
carried Montrose and his friends from Carlisle&mdash;skin and bone,
says Wishart, "omnino strigosos et emaciatos."</p>
<p>Yet, in the then condition of Scotland, there was in that ragged
levy the makings of a most formidable force. If it could find a
leader and loyally follow him, it might gravely perplex the
home-defence army, for it had none of its faults. The Highlander,
accustomed to full meals of meat from the chase, was physically far
superior to the bannock-fed Lowland peasant or the apprentice from
the foul vennels of the little cities. He was swift where they were
slow, cunning where they were simple, adroit where they were
blundering, daring when they were supine. A Highland army could
pursue a strict military purpose, for it had no civil
preoccupations to compel the holding of town or fortress.<a name=
"FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Living on the
country, it could do without pay-chests and transport wagons. It
had no communications to be cut; its base could not be taken, for
its base was the inviolable hills. Under a general who understood
its peculiar virtues, it might be to the second line of the
Covenant as a rapier to a ploughshare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> August</div>
<p>It was the true opening of Montrose's military career, and he
seems to have undergone a change of spirit. He was now thirty-two
years of age, and, as men went in his era, might be held to have
left his youth behind him. Hitherto we have seen him perplexed and
tormented, walking delicately and a little sadly in the difficult
ways of conscience. He goes steadfastly on the path of duty, but
with head bowed. To his contemporaries he must have seemed
something of a dreamer and a doctrinaire, with nothing of that
large impulsive power which carries men perforce to do its will. He
had a good repute as a soldier, but that repute was largely
academic. In the Bishops' War he had shown no special gift except
speed, and in the Border campaigning, earlier in the year 1644, he
had fought with weapons which snapped in his hand. But now some
seal is broken in him. Conscious of high talents for command, he
sees an army spring up miraculously at his call, and he has the wit
to perceive in that motley force the germ of a new kind of war. His
spirit is suddenly enlarged, and he recaptures his youth and his
humanity. Something goes out from him which kindles the ardour of
Ulsterman and Highlander alike, and which makes Alasdair follow
obediently a man the processes of whose mind are utterly beyond his
ken. He discovers a boyish zest for adventure and the desperate
chance. He indulges in a boy's whimsies&mdash;the dress which
captures the fancy, the proud word that stirs the heart. He strides
at the head of his men, daring the wildest cateran to outvie in
hardihood this intimate of scholars, this familiar of courts and
senates, the king's lieutenant-general.</p>

<p>Apparently he sent formal warning to Argyll, as befitted the
holder of the royal commission to the king's principal
antagonist.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id=
"FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class=
"fnanchor">[301]</a> If a blow was to be struck it must be prompt,
for the Council was arming fast against Alasdair, though as yet
Edinburgh had no news of Montrose. Lord Elcho was at Perth with a
large force drawn from the burghers of the second city of Scotland,
men from Fife and the Perthshire lowlands, and the mounted gentry
o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id=
"Page_191">[191]</a></span>f the neighbourhood. Lord Burleigh had
another army at Aberdeen, with the young Gordons serving under him;
while from the west Argyll was leading his formidable clan to
avenge the smoking homesteads of Morvern and Ardnamurchan. To wait
in Atholl was to starve, to retreat farther into the hills was to
court disaster. Montrose had no supplies, no ammunition, no means
of increasing his force except by victory.</p>
<p>On the 30th day of August he left Blair and marched west up the
Tummel <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id=
"Page_192">[192]</a></span>valley in blue autumn weather. He did
not take the shortest road to Perth, for Argyll was coming from the
west, and it would be well by fetching a circuit to get news of him
before engaging Elcho. Also he had hopes of collecting allies in
Strathearn. Rounding Loch Tummel, the army crossed the hills by the
eastern side of Schiehallion to Aberfeldy. At Castle Menzies, whose
laird was an ally of Argyll, they encountered a slight opposition,
and burned a hut or two and some corn in sheaf. Late that night
they crossed Tay, and put the river between them and the hostile
Menzieses. Next morning at dawn Black Pate led the Atholl men
forward as an advance guard, and the army marched with Highland
speed across Strathbran, and by the Sma' Glen to the Almond. There
at the Hill of Buchanty they fell in with an unexpected
reinforcement. Lord Kilpont, the eldest son of the seventh Earl of
Menteith; David Drummond, the Master of Maderty; and Sir John
Drummond, a younger son of the second Earl of Perth, had raised 500
bowmen at the order of the Estates to oppose Alasdair's invasion.
The leaders were kin to Montrose&mdash;young Maderty was his
brother-in-law&mdash;and when they learned who was advancing their
purpose changed. They gladly joined the royal general, and brought
him a welcome accession of stalwart peasants, who, living on the
border-line between Highlands and Lowlands, had some of the virtues
of both. The force crossed the ridge to Strathearn, and spent the
night on the moor of Fowlis.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> September</div>
<p>It was now Sunday, the 1st of September. Elcho had something
under 7,000 infantry, the levies of Fife and the Scottish midlands;
700 horse, composed of the local lairds and their following; and
nine pieces of artillery, light pieces firing at the most a
five-pound ball.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id=

"fnanchor">[302]</a> He had ample munitions of war, and his troops
were fortified by the Sabbath morning exhortations of an array of
ministers. "To give them their due," says Wishart, "they performed
their part stoutly at the expense of their lungs, promising them in
the name of God Almighty an easy and bloodless victory. Nay, one of
them, Frederick Carmichael<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id=
"FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class=

discourse, 'If ever God spoke certain truth out of my mouth, in His

"FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> With Elcho were many
of the neighbouring Covenanting gentry, including Lord Murray of
Gask,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and some who were
not Covenanters, like Lord Drummond, Perth's eldest son; and he had
the assistance of at least one experienced professional soldier,
Sir James Scott of Rossie, who had just come from serving under the
flag of Venice. Small wonder that the Covenant forces were in good
heart. They had seen something of the Highlander in the Bishops'
War, and thought little of his prowess. They knew that Alasdair's
troops were in rags&mdash;as one of the ministers described them,
"naked, weaponless, ammunitionless, cannonless men." The view of
the leaders was that of Elspeth's ballad in <i>The
Antiquary</i>:</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"My horse shall ride through ranks sae rude<br>
As through the moorland fern;<br>
&nbsp;Then ne'er let the gentle Norman blude<br>
Grow cauld for Highland kerne."</p>
<br>
<p>Besides, they outnumbered the enemy by nearly three to one. So,
very early in the day, Elcho with his army marched three miles
westward to Tippermuir, accompanied by a host of Perth citizens who
were not unwilling to see a surprising judgment fall upon their
ancient foes. He took up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193"
id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> good position in open ground, where
his cavalry, his most formidable arm, had room to manoeuvre. His
battle-cry was "Jesus and no quarter!"<a name="FNanchor_306_306"
id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class=
"fnanchor">[306]</a></p>
<p>Montrose had at the most 2,700 men, all of them foot-soldiers,
for his cavalry, as we have seen, was confined to the three lean
horses from Carlisle. His artillery consisted of Kilpont's bowmen.
The most grievous lack was ammunition, for the Irish, who alone had
guns, had but one round apiece. On Tippermuir, however, there were
plenty of stones, and with these as missile weapons he bade the
rest arm themselves. He put the three regiments of Irish under
Alasdair in the centre of his little force, and Kilpont with his
bowmen on the left, while he himself, carrying targe and pike, took
command of the Atholl men on the right flank. Elcho's dispositions
were not unskilful. He commanded the right wing, Murray of Gask the
centre, and Sir James Scott the left, opposite Montrose. The 700
horse, equally divided between the two wings, were under Lord
Drummond.</p>
<p>Montrose, faced with so great a numerical superiority, had at
all costs to avoid outflanking. So he abandoned the ordinary
six-rank formation, and drew up his men in a long line only three
deep. He saw further the danger from Drummond's cavalry unless he
scattered the enemy foot out of hand by striking at its heart. He
knew something of the temper of the unwilling Lowland
levies&mdash;men drawn from the counter and the plough-tail to a
work for which they had no stomach. To such the wild charge of the
clans would be a new experience. Then, true to his duty as a
constitutional commander, he sent the Master of Maderty with a flag
of truce to inform Elcho that he was acting under the royal
commission, that he wished above all things to avoid shedding
Scottish blood, and to summon him to remember his due and lawful
allegiance; in any case, let there be a truce so that the Sabbath
should not be profaned. Elcho replied that he had "made choice of
the Lo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id=
"Page_194">[194]</a></span>rd's day for doing the Lord's will"; he
had no mind for a truce which would give the doomed royalists a
chance to slip away. Moreover, he made the envoy prisoner and
dispatched him to Perth in the custody of two Forfar lairds, who
told him genially that he would be hanged when the fight was over.
The Covenanters were to show throughout their struggle with
Montrose a strange reluctance to accept the etiquette of civilized
warfare.</p>
<p>The battle began with a skirmish. As the two forces approached
within cannon shot, Drummond sent forward a mounted squadron, in
order to entice Montrose into one of those frontal attacks to which
an undisciplined army is prone. It was Elcho's one glimmer of
tactical wisdom. But Montrose was ready. He had adopted the method
used by Gustavus at Leipsic by which all three ranks fired at once,
though the weapons of the third rank were only stones; and the
first volley sent Drummond's troopers flying and halted Elcho's
advance. Then he gave the order for a general charge. From behind
the smoke came the fierce kerns of Ulster and Badenoch, with pike
and claymore and Lochaber axe. The nine guns were submerged by the
torrent. Elcho's centre crumpled like paper, and in a few minutes
was racing back on the road to Perth. The cavalry could do nothing
in the face of such fury and speed. On the Covenant left alone was
there any serious resistance, where on rising ground stood Scott,
the wary professional soldier, with the best of the Fife levies.
But Montrose presently won the ridge, and Scott fled with the rest.
The plain was strewn with lathered horses and panting foot.<a name=
"FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>
<p>Then followed a grim business. Scarcely a dozen men fell in the
battle, but nearly 2,000, according to Wishart, died in the rout,
and the Iris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id=
"Page_195">[195]</a></span>h officer, whose story has come down to
us, declares that a man might have walked to Perth on the
dead.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Some perished from
the swords of Montrose, some from sheer fatigue&mdash;for the
pursuit lasted till nine in the evening of a hot autumn
day&mdash;and we are told that ten of the Perth burgesses succumbed
unwounded to their unusual exertions. Presently the enemy was at
the gates of Perth, and the city surrendered without a word.
Cannon, arms, supplies, tents, colours, drums, baggage, all became
the spoil of the victors. Montrose held his wild forces in a stiff
discipline. He refused to allow the captured guns to be turned on
the fugitives, and he permitted no violence of any kind within the
walls. He contented himself with fining the burghers &pound;50 sterling,
which went to Alasdair, who was in desperate straits for money,
with compelling the Covenanting sheriff-clerk to copy out a summons
to the local lairds, and with levying a large contribution of cloth
to amend the "looped and windowed" raggedness of his army.</p>
<p>For three days Montrose tarried in Perth. He took up his
quarters in the town, in the house of one Margaret Donaldson, and
sent to Kinnaird for his old tutor, William Forrett, to act as his
secretary, and for his two elder sons, Lord Graham and Lord James.
Like Cromwell, he had the ministers to dinner, and one of them, Mr.
George Haliburton, was afterwards taken to task by the Presbytery
for saying grace at his table.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id=
"FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class=
"fnanchor">[309]</a> The news of the victory carried consternation
to the Covenant leaders in London, who had written off Montrose for
good, and caused them heart-searching as to whether the judgment
was due to the sins of Assembly, Parliament, army, or

Newcastle,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id=
"FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class=
"fnanchor">[311]</a> but it did not give Montrose the recruits he
had hoped for, Lord Dupplin being the only man of note who arrived
at his camp.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id=
"FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class=
"fnanchor">[312]</a> The Atholl and Badenoch men, according to
their custom, made off to their homes to secrete their booty, and
his force was soon reduced to little more than Alasdair's Irishry.
There were other armies waiting to be met, and one of them,
Argyll's, was approaching rapidly from the west. Montrose decided
that his force was not sufficient to oppose Argyll, and at that
time he was probably not aware of the existence of Burleigh at
Aberdeen. His immediate aim was to collect recruits in his own
county of Angus, and, if possible, capture Dundee.<a name=
"FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> On the 4th of
September he left Perth and, crossing the Tay, reached the
neighbourhood of Coupar-Angus. On the 10th Lothian, with Argyll's
vanguard of horse, entered the city, and the following day at long
last came Argyll himself.</p>
<p>On the night of the 6th the camp was stirred by a tragedy. Young
Lord Kilpont shared a tent with one of his lieutenants, James
Stewart of Ardvoirlich, whose castle still stands among the birch
woods on the south shore of Loch Earn. A quarrel arose in the small
hours, and Stewart stabbed Kilpont to the heart, killed two
sentries, and with his son and some friends escaped to the
Covenanters. Argyll three months later procured him a pardon from
the Estates,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id=
"FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class=
"fnanchor">[314]</a> who, on 12th September, to give further proof
of their partiality for assassination, offered a reward of some
&pound;1,600 sterling to any one who would slay Montrose and exhibit his
head to them in Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id=
"FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class=
"fnanchor">[315]</a> The murderer was also to have a free pardon
for any crimes he might have been unfortunate enough to commit in
the past. Mr. Gardiner dryly points out the inconsistency of this
course. "The favourable reception giv<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>en by Argyll to the
supposed murderer was a sign that all who joined in a Highland
rising might be assassinated with impunity as far as the
Covenanting authorities were concerned. It is seldom indeed that a
civilized community metes out to a less civilized one the measure
by which it judges itself. When Argyll desolated the Highland glens
with fire and sword, he was but inflicting due punishment upon
barbarians. When Montrose gathered the Highlanders to the slaughter
of the burghers and the farmers of the Lowlands, he placed himself
outside the pale of civilized warfare."<a name="FNanchor_316_316"
id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class=
"fnanchor">[316]</a> The natural presumption from Argyll's
reception of Stewart is that Stewart had been endeavouring to
anticipate the wishes of the Estates, and had tried to persuade
Kilpont, who had refused. For such a view there is no evidence, and
it is intrinsically unlikely. Kilpont would have offered barren
soil for any such proposal, and this Stewart must be assumed to
have known. It is more probable that the account given in Stewart's
official pardon is the true one. He had proposed to desert, and
Kilpont, divining his intention, tried to prevent him and was
slain. Or, if we like, we can take the family tradition referred to
by Scott in his <i>Legend of Montrose</i>, that Stewart had
challenged Alasdair, and that afterwards, in their cups, Kilpont
and Stewart had words which ended in the fatal blow. The Estates
have so many deeds of violence on their shoulders that the
historian is glad to relieve them of one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> September</div>
<p>Dundee proved beyond Montrose's powers. It was too well
garrisoned for 1,500 men to take, and the guns captured at
Tippermuir were no siege pieces. He moved accordingly to the upper
waters of the Esks in the hope of enlisting some of the loyal
gentlemen of Angus. Here he had definite word of Burleigh's army at
Aberdeen, which determined his next step. The Angus recruits came
in slowly. Lord Airlie indeed appeared, the father of Lord Ogilvy
who had been captured at Ribble Bridge. No Ogilvy was ever anything
but a king's man, and two of his sons, Sir Thomas and Sir David,
accompanied their father. With the Gordons Montrose fared no better
than had Alasdair Macdonald. Huntly was still lurking among the
bogs of Strathnaver; Aboyne, the second son, was fighting for the
king in the garrison at Carlisle; and Lord Gordon, the heir, and
his younger brother, Lord Lewis, were with Burleigh at Aberdeen.
The clan, however, was not wholly unrepresented in the royal army.
Nathaniel Gordon had been with Huntly in his rising, and now rode
joyfully to join the king's lieutenant. He was an intrepid and
seasoned soldier, but as rash as any<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> subaltern of Alasdair's.
It is a pity that no romancer has made him the subject of a tale,
for his career, both early and late, offers rich material. Before
he took part in politics, brigandage, kidnapping, piracy, and the
baiting of Mr. Andrew Cant had been among the simple diversions of
his life.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id=
"FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class=
"fnanchor">[317]</a> He brought thirty horsemen with him, and
Airlie had forty-five, so the little army was no longer without
cavalry.</p>
<p>Montrose left his second son, Lord James, in his house of Old
Montrose to continue his schooling, and then, keeping to the skirts
of the hills, reached the Dee valley by the pass known as the
Cryne's Cross Mounth.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id=
"FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class=
"fnanchor">[318]</a> The river was crossed about midway between
Banchory and the Mills of Drum, and Crathes&mdash;the stately
castle of the Burnets of Leys, which lay on the north
bank&mdash;was peacefully occupied. Sir Thomas Burnet was that rare
combination, a friend of Huntly's and a staunch Covenanter; he
hospitably entertained the royal lieutenant and his staff, and
offered him a sum of money, which was refused. The following day,
the 12th of September, the army advanced down the river to within
two miles of the town of Aberdeen, where they found Burleigh
awaiting them. Montrose had chosen his route to avoid the strongly
fortified bridge of Dee, and in the hope of effecting a surprise;
but the Covenanters had had ample warning, and had taken up a good
position on the slopes of a hill. A lane, the present Hardgate, ran
downwards from their centre, and around the foot of it were houses
and gardens, which were strongly held. Burleigh had in all some
2,000 foot and 500 cavalry,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id=
"FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class=
"fnanchor">[319]</a> and he possessed heavier artillery than the
little pieces captured at Tippermuir. His cavalry seem to have been
chiefly the Forbes, Fraser, and Crichton gentry, and eighteen horse
under the separate command of Lord Lewis Gordon. His infantry were
the usual Covenant levies, including a proportion of Aberdeen
townspeople, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id=
"Page_200">[200]</a></span>nd the remnants of Elcho's Fife
regiment.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id=
"FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class=
"fnanchor">[320]</a> Montrose had 1,500 foot and some 70 horsemen.
It was his business to beat his opponent as soon as possible, for
Argyll, with a formidable army, was lumbering in his wake, and
Fabian tactics would land him between two fires.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, according to his custom, he sent an
envoy to the magistrates of the city summoning them to surrender,
advising them at any rate to send the women and children to a place
of safety, and warning them that those who stayed could expect no
quarter. The magistrates returned an embarrassed answer,
summarizing his words as "no quarter except to old persons, women,
and children" (which was not what he had written), and subscribing
themselves first "your lordship's faithful friends to serve you,"
and then altering this to "your lordship's as ye love us."<a name=
"FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Why did Montrose
preface this engagement with a threat so foreign to his character
and practice? It would seem that he was in a mood of anger and
strain. Kilpont's murder had outraged his feelings; his force was
heavily outnumbered and needed encouragement; he realized that his
affairs stood on a razor edge, and that his failure now would mean
destruction. His mood was to be further embittered. The magistrates
courteously entertained his messenger and made a drummer-boy who
accompanied him the present of a silver piece, but as the two
returned under a flag of truce the child was treacherously shot by
one of the Fife soldiers. A breach of the laws of war always
revolted Montrose, and this breach was especially cruel and wanton.
In a sudden fury he vowed to make the enemy pay dearly for the
misdeed, and promised Alasdair the sack of the city if the day was
won. Such a promise was as unjust as it was barbarous and unwise.
It was not the city which had offended, but levies from the south
that were little loved by the townsmen of Aberdeen.</p>

<p class="caption">The Battle of Aberdeen</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Without further delay he deployed his forces for battle. He bade
his men plunder the adjacent cornfields, and, in order to
distinguish themselves from the enemy, stick each a bunch of oats
in his bonnet. The Irish as before held the centre, and on the
right wing Sir William Rollo and Colonel James Hay commanded, while
Nathaniel Gordon had the left. He divided his scanty cavalry into
equal portions, and placed one on each wing, following an old
custom of the Thirty Years' War by stiffening the score or two of
horsemen with musketeers and bowmen interspersed among them&mdash;a
thing only made possible by the discipline and skill of Alasdair's
men. The little force thus marshalled was the nearest approach to a
regular army that Montrose had yet commanded, for most were
adequately armed, and almost all had some experience of war.
Burleigh, who was nothing of a general, was content with his strong
position, superior numbers, especially in cavalry, and heavier
guns. He had little authority and no plan of battle, and his
lieutenants followed their own devices.</p>
<p>The action began with an attack on the houses and gardens which
protected the Covenant centre. Alasdair had little difficulty in
driving the enemy out of these and advancing up the slope. Lord
Lewis Gordon charged with his eighteen horsemen on Montrose's right
wing&mdash;a mad boy's escapade in the old cavalry style,
discharging their pistols and retiring at the caracole. He made no
impression, and Lord Fraser and Crichton of Frendraught<a name=
"FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> followed vainly in
the same manner; they knew nothing of the meaning of shock tactics,
and sporadic and half-hearted assaults of this kind were easy to
repulse. The rest of the cavalry on the Covenant's left wing had
apparently no orders, but sat staring at the battle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id=
"Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>Presently, however, the meaning of this manoeuvre was plain. It
was a diversion against Montrose's right to cover a dangerous
attack upon his left. Following a mill road which was out of sight
of the combatants, 100 Covenant horse and 400 foot worked their way
to a position a little in the rear of Montrose's left flank. A bold
attack there might have decided the battle, but the assault was
delivered half-heartedly, and Nathaniel Gordon, with his little
body of horse and musketeers, was able to hold it until Sir William
Rollo's detachment was brought up from the right wing. With this
accession of strength Gordon delivered a counter-attack, drove off
the Covenant cavalry, and cut to pieces the Covenant foot.</p>
<p>But the denudation of the royalist right did not escape the eye
of Sir William Forbes of Craigievar, who commanded on Burleigh's
left. There were now no horsemen there to stiffen the defence, and
with his cavalry he charged forthwith on that weakened
wing&mdash;no futile demonstration like Lord Lewis Gordon's, but a
charge to be pushed home in the manner of Rupert or Cromwell.
Ordinary foot soldiers would have broken, but not Alasdair's Irish.
With perfect coolness they opened their ranks and let Forbes's
troopers thunder through; then, facing round, they pursued them
with volleys. Saddles emptied fast, and the cavalry became a flying
rout. Rollo returned from the now secure left wing, and completed
Forbes's destruction.</p>
<p>It was the turning-point of the fight, which had now lasted for
several hours. Montrose, who had darted from place to place,
reinforcing and heartening his men, called for a general advance.
The Irish responded with enthusiasm, the whole army swept forward,
and the Covenant centre broke and fled. The ground between the
battlefield and the city walls became a shambles, and Alasdair's
men, mindful of Montrose's promise before the fight, broke into the
streets in pursuit. Patrick Gordon says that the victors lost but
seven men and the vanquished a thousand, which is manifestly
absurd; but beyond doubt the flying Covenanters were cut down
without quarter, and stripped before the fatal blow, that
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id=
"Page_203">[203]</a></span>ir clothes might not be soiled with
their blood. In the streets unarmed citizens were butchered, women
were violated and slain or carried into captivity, and death did
not spare the very old and the very young. For three terrible days
the orgy lasted. Montrose had returned to his camp, and the
miserable business continued unchecked, though Donald Farquharson,
true to his character for gentleness and mercy, endeavoured to
plead for the unhappy city.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id=
"FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class=

had received its darkest stain.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id=

<p>What is the truth about the sack of Aberdeen? On the nature and
magnitude of the atrocities it is hard to dogmatize. The damning
evidence is that of the royalist Spalding,<a name=
"FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and it is explicit
not only as to the giving of no quarter to men, but as to the
slaughter of women. Alexander Jaffray, who served with the Covenant
cavalry and fled as fast as his horse would carry him, says that
"about seven or eight score men, besides women and children, were
killed."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id=
"FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class=
"fnanchor">[326]</a> He may have spoken from hearsay, but the burgh
records of Aberdeen record the slaughter of all found on the
streets, "old and young," and it is fair to assume that both sexes
are included. There can be no ground for disbelief in the
melancholy fact. As to the extent of the killing, one may be more
sceptical; looting there was on a colossal scale, and no quarter
was given to Covenanters in arms, but the slaughter of citizens was
probably less than 200. Spalding, though his list does not profess
to be exhaustive, enumerates only 118. Baillie, not likely to
minimize the misdeeds of his opponents, puts the number of slain at
seven score,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id=
"FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class=
"fnanchor">[327]</a> and in another passage his words are: "A great
many Aberdeen men were killed, and the town ill plundered."<a name=
"FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This evidence
scarcely suggests a general massacre. Moreover, the Cromwellian
Richard Franck, visiting Aberdeen in 1657, had heard of a great
battle there, but clearly of no atr<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>ocities, for he seizes the
occasion for a panegyric on Montrose's "incomparable
conduct."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id=
"FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class=
"fnanchor">[329]</a></p>
<p>But on Spalding's evidence we must regard the main charge as
proven: Montrose, faithlessly faithful to his rash promise to
Alasdair, permitted the plunder of the city, the killing of men in
cold blood to the number of over a hundred, and of some women, and
the carrying off of other women as spoil by the Ulstermen. Among
the female prisoners in Selkirk gaol after Philiphaugh are found
names like Dunbar, Anderson, Forbes, Lamond, Young, Simson, Tait,
Watson, Walker, Park, and Stuart<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id=
"FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class=
"fnanchor">[330]</a>&mdash;it may be, some of the unfortunates who
were now compelled to follow Alasdair's drum. On Saturday the 14th
Montrose entered the city with Airlie, Dupplin, and others, and
slept the night there, busied with trying to call his troops to
order. But they had got out of hand, and when the march sounded on
Monday morning many of the Irish were still at their evil work.
When he saw the wretched townsfolk fruitlessly mounting his own
whimsy of oats in their bonnets to save their lives, his heart may
well have misgiven him.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id=
"FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class=

remainder of his campaigns he held his men in a grip of iron.
Henceforth when he captured a town there might be looting, but
there was no murder or outrage.</p>
<p>The sack of Aberdeen was not only a crime, it was a fatal error.
This was no Covenanting city, and the majority of those who
perished inside its walls had been forced into the fight&mdash;as
Spalding says, "harllit out sore against their wills to fight
against the king's lieutenant." Montrose had spoiled his chance of
getting recruits for the king among the burghers of Deeside. All
over Scotland, too, the tale, zealously disseminated by the
Covenanters, and no doubt wildly embroidered, must have deterred
moderate men from casting in their lot with one whose methods
seemed more like a Tilly or a Wallenstein than a kindly Scot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id=

<h2>II</h2>
<p>On Monday, the 16th of September, Montrose left the city and
marched to Kintore on the Don. From there he sent a
dispatch<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id=
"FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class=
"fnanchor">[332]</a> to the king by the hand of Sir William Rollo.
On the 19th the heavy-footed Argyll entered Aberdeen and proceeded
to exact contributions from the surviving citizens. Soon the news
of the battle reached Edinburgh, and the Estates were gravely
disquieted. Argyll might be a pillar of the Kirk, but he was very
slow in bringing malefactors to book; he complained that his army
was too small, so requisitions were promptly sent to Leven. Yet
Argyll had at least 2,500 foot from the western levies, and
Lothian, his master of horse, had 1,500 cavalry.<a name=
"FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Montrose continued
up Strathdon to Kildrummie, whence he sent Nathaniel Gordon to
Strathbogie (Huntly castle) and the Bog of Gight (Gordon castle) in
a desperate appeal to the Gordons. But the clan was dumb. It would
not stir without Huntly's word, and Huntly, jealous of a royal
commission which interfered with his own lieutenancy of the north,
and not forgetful of his treatment by Montrose in the first
Bishops' War, refused to give it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> Sept.-Oct.</div>
<p>The place was growing unhealthy for a loyalist with Argyll a
day's march off, so Montrose withdrew by way of Strathavon and
Tomintoul to the vicinity of Rothiemurchus, that ancient pile on
Loch-an-Eilean, of which Shaws and Mackintoshes and Grants have
been successive masters. Somewhere on the road he buried the cannon
which he had captured at Aberdeen.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id=
"FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class=
"fnanchor">[334]</a> The Grant<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>s and the other Speyside
families showed some inclination to dispute the way, so Montrose
turned down the river to Abernethy, which brought him within twenty
miles of Argyll, now at the Bog of Gight, and his 4,000 men.
Presently he turned south again and made for the head of Spey and
the Badenoch country, for he had been compelled to change his
plans. Alasdair insisted on departing for the west on an expedition
of his own, to raise recruits among the Clan Donald and to see to
the security of his castles of Mingary and Lochaline. This left
Montrose with no more than 500 men, and compelled a revision of his
strategy. For the present he must content himself with troubling
the soul of his enemies.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> October</div>
<p>In Badenoch he fell seriously ill; it was rumoured in the south
that he was dead, and from a hundred pulpits the Almighty was
publicly thanked for espousing the Covenanters' quarrel. The
illness lasted for several days, and seems to have been a fever
caused by excessive fatigue.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id=
"FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class=
"fnanchor">[335]</a> By the 4th of October he was on the move again
and heading for Atholl. Now began what Baillie calls a "strange
coursing," Montrose leading the dance, and Argyll, some seven or
eight days behind, footing it heavily from Spey to Tay and from Tay
to Don. Alasdair with his female following had left him, and the
king's lieutenant travelled light. He passed into Angus, and,
clinging as before to the flanks of the hills, crossed the Dee at
his old ford on the 17th of October. Now he sanctioned for the
first time the burning of the lands of Covenanting lairds, like the
Frasers and the Crichtons, in retaliation for the fire and sword
which Argyll had carried to every one suspected of loyalism. By the
21st he was in Strathbogie, busy once more with fruitless appeals
to the Gordons. Here he had word of Argyll's approach,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
reinforced by fourteen troops of horse under Marischal, the result
of the appeal of the Estates to Leven. Accordingly he turned east
into the bleak uplands of Buchan, and on the 24th was at Fyvie on
the Ythan. He thought that Argyll was scarcely yet across the
Grampians, when in reality he was almost within musket-shot. For
once his intelligence failed him, and the king's lieutenant was
caught napping.</p>
<p>Fyvie, an old seat of the Earls of Dunfermline, had by this date
become more of a seventeenth-century dwelling-house than a baronial
keep. On three sides lay bogs with a few strips of hard ground too
narrow for the approach of an army. On the eastern side was a low
ridge of hills, which&mdash;a rare thing in that
countryside&mdash;was thickly wooded on one flank. Montrose cannot
have had more than 800 foot,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id=
"FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class=
"fnanchor">[336]</a> and at the moment of the surprise 150 mounted
Gordons whom he had recruited in Strathbogie deserted his standard,
leaving him with only 50 horse. Argyll outnumbered him by at least
five to one, and he dared not meet him on the level; to defend
Fyvie was to be caught in a trap; his only hope lay in the strong
defensive position afforded by the hill-face broken with ditches
and dry-stone walls, and the good cover in the adjacent scrub. He
was desperately short of ammunition, and melted down the pewter
vessels of the castle to make bullets; for powder he could only
look to the pouches of the enemy.</p>
<p>Argyll, believing that at last he had driven his nimble foe into
a blind alley, and strong in the consciousness of a force many
times as large, attacked the position with&mdash;for
him&mdash;considerable spirit. At last the omens were propitious,
for he had heard of the Gordon desertions. A regiment of foot
advanced up the little hill and carried some of the dykes and
trenches, difficult places from which to eject well-armed men.
Montrose saw that the only hope lay in cold steel. He called to a
yo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id=
"Page_208">[208]</a></span>ung Ulsterman, Magnus O'Cahan,<a name=
"FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> whom Alasdair had
left behind him, and bade him drive the enemy from the slopes. A
gallant handful of Irish charged with pikes and broadswords, drove
back the Covenanters and made prize of many bags of powder for
their famished muskets. It is recorded that one of them, looking at
the booty, cried: "We must have at them again; these stingy
hucksters have left us no bullets." Then came a charge of Lothian's
horse on the flank. Montrose had his men well in cover, and, had
the enemy been drawn in sufficiently deep, there might have been an
end of Lothian's 500. But the excitement of the Atholl men brought
about a premature volley, the battle was joined too soon, and the
Covenant cavalry were easily routed by the charge of Montrose's 50
mounted men supported by his musketeers. After that followed some
half-hearted skirmishing, in which Lord Marischal's brother was
slain on the Covenant side, and then Argyll withdrew and put the
Ythan between himself and his enemy.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id=
"FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class=
"fnanchor">[338]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> November</div>
<p>But Fyvie was no place to tarry in, since 800 men cannot for
ever defy an army. Under cover of darkness Montrose slipped away,
and was presently heard of in Strathbogie. Here he hoped for news
of Alasdair and his western men, but no news came. His aim is
clear; he had still expectations from the Gordons, and was loth to
leave their country. This Argyll knew well, and he, too, followed
to Strathbogie, keeping up a show of attacks which were easily
repulsed. But the Campbell chief was engaged on work more suited to
his genius than fighting, and busied himself with making overtures
to Montrose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id=
"Page_209">[209]</a></span>'s Lowland officers.<a name=
"FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Since Alasdair went,
Montrose had more officers than rank and file, and these Angus and
Perthshire and Aberdeen gentry, half-hearted about the campaign and
timid about their estates, appeared to be fruitful soil. He did not
ask them to betray their cause; he only offered, of his generosity,
free passes to any who wished to go home, asking no payment in
return. It was a subtle plan, and it largely succeeded. Sibbald, a
companion on the ride from Carlisle, left, and the seeds were sown
of further discontent.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id=
"FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class=
"fnanchor">[340]</a> A council of war was called, and it was
resolved to retreat into the hills. The royalists marched by
moorland roads to Speyside, and at Balveny, on the west bank of the
Fiddich, out of reach of Argyll's horse, took stock of their
position. Argyll, avoiding the mountains, went south by an easier
road, and lay with his army in the neighbourhood of Dunkeld.</p>
<p>At Balveny matters came to a crisis. The Lowland gentlemen had
no love for a campaign in midwinter, conducted at Montrose's
incredible speed, and offering little hope of finality. They feared
for their lands and families, now at the mercy of the Covenant.
Moreover, Highland and Lowland are ill to mix, and they may well
have disliked their associates. Montrose accordingly proposed a
descent on the Lowlands, the plan which he had always had in view,
for his aim was to relieve the king by drawing back Leven's army
from England. So far his victories had availed nothing to that
purpose, for Newcastle had fallen on 19th October, and Tynemouth on
the 27th. Leven was now in Scotland, his army was in winter
quarters, and a descent upon the Border would gravely embarrass the
Parliament plan of campaign. But the scheme found little favour.
The Lowlanders argued that success in hill warfare was no warrant
for victory against regulars in a settled and hosti<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>le
country, and the Highlanders had grievances of their own to avenge,
which they thought of far greater moment than any royal
necessities. Men like Dupplin (now Earl of Kinnoull), Colonel Hay,
and Sir James Drummond, slipped away to make a temporary peace with
the Covenant. Almost alone of the gentry old Airlie and his gallant
sons refused to leave. They, like Montrose, fought not for safety
or revenge, but for an ideal of statesmanship.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> Nov.-Dec.</div>
<p>It was now far on in November. In the levels the heavy rains
told of the beginning of winter, the high tops were whitening with
snow, the bogs were morasses, the streams were red with flood, and
the days were short and dark. Argyll was at Dunkeld, busy with
attempts on the loyalty of Atholl, and he must have believed that
no general in his senses would continue the war in such inclement
weather. Indeed he had already sent his cavalry, his chief arm,
into winter quarters. Montrose resolved to disappoint his
expectations, and led his handful of troops through the Badenoch
passes for a descent on Dunkeld. His route was by Dalnaspidal and
Dalwhinnie to Blair, and in a single night he covered twenty-four
miles. But long ere he could reach the Tay Argyll had news of him,
and wisely decided that he could not face him with foot alone, even
though the odds were four to one, and that he at any rate would end
the campaign. He fell back on Perth, dismissed his Campbells to
their homes, and himself posted with Lothian to Edinburgh, where he
surrendered his commission as general-in-chief into the hands of
the Estates. He complained that he had not been
supported&mdash;"whether through envy or emulation, or negligence
or inability";<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id=
"FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class=
"fnanchor">[341]</a> but it is hard to see what more he could have
needed in the way of foot, horse, or guns; neither Kirk nor Council
could give him a genius for war. His reception was a little
chilly;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id=
"FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class=
"fnanchor">[342]</a> his services were<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
formally approved, but it was dryly observed that the approbation
was the greater because he had shed so little blood. The question
was who should succeed him. Lothian and Callander brusquely
declined the thankless post, and the Estates fell back upon a
professional soldier, William Baillie of Letham, one of the best of
Leven's generals in England.</p>
<p>At Blair Montrose met Alasdair returning out of the western
mists. The meeting changed his plans. He may have thought of winter
quarters, like his opponents, but that would be a difficult
business, since they must be in the desert and hungry hills, and at
the best a fruitless one, since precious months would be lost. But
now he had the Ulstermen again under his command, and with them a
formidable levy of the western clans. Alasdair had been no laggard.
Clan Donald had not forgotten Argyll's commission of fire and sword
in 1640, and Clan Gillian had long scores to settle with the
secular enemy of their name. Five hundred Macdonalds&mdash;of
Glengarry, Keppoch, Clanranald, and the Isles&mdash;had flocked to
his standard. None of the resounding names which, forty-five years
later, were to muster under another Graham, were lacking. There
were Macleans from Morvern and Mull, Stewarts from Appin,
Farquharsons from Braemar, and the eastern Camerons of Lochaber.
John of Moidart, the Captain of Clanranald, brought his fierce
spirit and devoted following to Montrose's side. There was young
Aeneas of Glengarry, with his three uncles, and Donald Glas of
Keppoch, and the chiefs of the fierce septs of Glen Nevis and
Glencoe.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id=
"FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class=
"fnanchor">[343]</a> The middle Highlands, for the first time since
Harlaw, were united, but it was not in the king's cause. The hatred
of every clansman was directed not at the Covenant, but at the
house of Diarmaid. Now was the time to avenge ancient wrongs, and
to break the pride of a chief who had boasted that no mortal foe
could enter his borders. The hour had come when the fray must be
carried to Lorn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id=
"Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>Montrose had that supreme virtue in a commander which recognizes
facts. He could not maintain his army without war, and to Lowland
war they would not listen. If he looked for their help in the
future he must steel their valour and rivet their loyalty by fresh
successes. In return for their assistance in the king's quarrel
they must have the help of the king's lieutenant in their own.
Again, a blow at the Campbells in their own country would put fear
into the heart of the Covenant, and shatter Argyll's not too robust
nerve. It was a wild venture, an unheard-of thing to scour the
hills when decent soldiers were warm in camp, and even the
shepherds and the hunters lay snug in their bothies; but in its
audacity lay its merit, for wild ventures have their psychological
value in war. In a sense, too, it had always been Montrose's second
line of strategy, for we have seen him writing to Sir Robert
Spottiswoode from York: "We intend to make all possible dispatch to
follow him (Argyll) at his heels in whatever posture we
can."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> He had the wit to
see that a deadly thrust might be delivered in a region far from
the main front of the campaign. There may have been a further
reason. The Estates had confiscated his lands and taken captive his
friends. Wishart, his chaplain to be, and Lord Ogilvy, his dearest
comrade, were in the Edinburgh Tolbooth; his kinsfolk, when hands
could be laid on them, had been consigned to squalid prisons. A
blow at the arch-enemy would be some little solace to a heart which
was only too prone to the human affections.</p>

<br>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1644</i> December</div>
<p>In seventeenth-century Scotland Clan Campbell stood by itself as
a separate race, almost a separate state, whose politics were
determined by the whim of its ruling prince. Built upon the ruins
of many little septs, it excelled in numbers and wealth every other
Highland clan; indeed, if we except the Gordons, it surpassed in
importance all the rest put together. It was near enough to the
Lowlands to have shared in such civilization as was going,
including the new theology. Craftsmen had been brought to Inveraray
from the Ayr and Renfrew burghs, schools had been established, and
of a Sunday the townsfolk could listen to notable preachers of the
Word. On the other hand, its territory was a compact block, well
guarded on all sides from its neighbours, so that it enjoyed the
peace and confidence of a separate people. With its immense
sea-coast its doors were open to the wider world, and the Campbell
gentry acquired at foreign universities and in foreign wars a
training which few landward gentlemen could boast; while Flemish
velvets and the silks and wines of France came more readily and
cheaply to its little towns than to the burghers of Perth or
Edinburgh. The country, though less fertile than the Lowlands, was
a champaign compared to Locha<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>ber or Kintail. Thousands
of black cattle flourished on its juicy hill pastures, and farms
and shielings were thick along the pleasant glens that sloped to
Loch Fyne and Loch Awe. In the town of Inveraray the clan had its
natural capital, and from Inveraray ran the Lowland road through
Cowal and Dumbarton for such as preferred a land journey. Compared
with other clans, the Campbells were prosperous and civilized; they
did not live from hand to mouth like the rest, nor did each winter
find them at the brink of starvation; yet they still retained the
martial spirit of the Gael, and could put into the field the most
formidable of Highland levies. Accordingly, by their neighbours
they were both detested and feared. They had eaten up the little
peoples of Benderloch and Morvern, and their long arm was
stretching north and east into Lochaber and Strathtay. Every
Maclean and Stewart who could see the hills of Lorn from his
doorstep had uneasy thoughts about his own barren acres. The
Campbells had a knack of winning by bow and spear, and then holding
for all time by seal and parchment.</p>
<p>Not without reason Argyll boasted that his land was impregnable,
for strategically it had every advantage. On the eastern side,
where it looked to the Lowlands, there were the castles of
Roseneath and Dunoon to keep ward, and deep sea-lochs to check the
invader. Besides, the Lowlands and Argyll were always at peace.
South and west lay the sea, and the Campbells had what little navy
existed at the time in Scotland. The Macleans in Mull were too
small and broken to take the offensive, and in any case it was a
long way from the coast at Knapdale to the heart at Inveraray.
North and east lay a land of high mountains and difficult passes,
where no man could travel save by permission of the sovereign lord.
Moreover, the Campbells of Lochow and Glenorchy had flung their
tentacles over Breadalbane, and held the marches around the
headwaters of Tay. There might be a raid of Macgregors or Maclarens
on the east, or a foray from Appin on Loch Etive side, but not even
the king and his army could get much beyond the gates. "It
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id=
"Page_215">[215]</a></span> a far cry to Lochow," so ran the
Campbell owercome, and it was a farther cry to Inveraray.</p>
<p>Montrose, when he assented to Alasdair's wishes, resolved to
strike straight at the enemy's heart. He would wage war not in the
outskirts, but in the citadel. From Blair there was little choice
of roads. To go due west by Rannoch and the springs of Etive would
mean a march among friendly clans, but a few score Campbells could
hold the narrows of Loch Etive or the Pass of Brander against the
strongest army. The Lowland road by Dumbarton and Loch Lomond was
out of the question, for it meant a dangerous proximity to the
Covenanting westlands and the difficult pass of Glencroe. But
midway through Breadalbane ran a possible route, among wild glens
and trackless bogs, which at this winter season would be deep in
snow. This was the old raiding road out of Lorn, and Argyll
flattered himself that his clan alone had the keys of it.<a name=
"FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> But with Montrose
were men who had made many a midnight foray into the Campbell
domain, and who knew every corrie and moss as well as any son of
Diarmaid. A Glencoe man, Angus MacAlain Dubh, was the chief guide,
and he promised Montrose that his army should live well on the
country, "if tight houses, fat cattle, and clear water will
suffice."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id=
"FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class=
"fnanchor">[346]</a> Accordingly, with Airlie and the Ogilvys and
his eldest boy, Lord Graham, as his Lowland staff, the king's
lieutenant ordered the march to the west. The army travelled in
three divisions: the Ulstermen under Alasdair in three regiments,
commanded respectively by James Macdonnell, Ranald Og Macdonnell,
and Magnus O'Cahan; the western clans, Macdonalds, Camerons,
Stewarts, and Macleans, under John of Moidart, Captain of
Clanranald; the Atholl, Badenoch, and Aberdeenshire contingents,
and the small Lowland force under the king's lieutenant himself.
Montrose had now some 3,000 troops,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id=
"FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class=
"fnanchor">[347]</a> drawn from every corner of Scotland. There
were men from Orkney, from Uist, and from Skye; f<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>rom the
whole Highland mainland between Knoydart and Braemar; from Kintyre;
from Angus and Moray and Buchan; from the villages of Forth, Earn,
and Tay; even from Lothian, Galloway, and the distant Borders.</p>
<p>Montrose left Blair on or about the 11th day of December. The
road was at first the same as that taken in the march to
Tippermuir. The lands of the small and uncertain clan of Menzies
were traversed, and the laird of Weem taken prisoner. Then westward
by both shores of Loch Tay swept the advance, where the Macdougal
settlers from Lorn suffered, till the confines of Breadalbane were
reached and a country that owned Campbell sway.<a name=
"FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Up Glen
Dochart<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id=
"FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class=
"fnanchor">[349]</a> they went, following much the same road as the
present railway line to Oban, past Crianlarich and Tyndrum, and
into the glens of Orchy. John of Moidart, with the western men, was
sent on in advance, and did not rejoin the army till Kilmartin
Glassary, far down in Argyll; his business was to collect food, and
he brought in a thousand head of cattle. In Glen Dochart Montrose
was joined by the local septs, the Macnabs and the Macgregors, and
it was by a ruse of the former wily and resourceful clan that the
difficult narrows of Loch Dochart were passed, and the island
castle was surrendered.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id=
"FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class=
"fnanchor">[350]</a> A Catholic priest was the meteorologist of the
army, and he had promised them that the weather would hold, since

<p>It was partly a raid of vengeance, and behind them rose the
flames of burning roof-trees. Presently Loch Awe lay before them
under the leaden winter sky, and soon t<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>he
little fortalices of the lochside lairds smoked to heaven. All
fighting men who resisted were slain or driven to the high hills,
every cot and clachan was set alight, and droves of maddened cattle
attested the richness of the land and the profit of the invaders.
It was Highland warfare of the old barbarous type, no worse and no
better than that which Argyll had already carried to Lochaber and
Badenoch and the braes of Angus.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id=
"FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class=
"fnanchor">[352]</a></p>
<p>Argyll was well served by his scouts, and to him at Edinburgh
word was soon brought of Montrose's march to Breadalbane. He must
have thought it a crazy venture. Now at last was his enemy
delivered into his hands. No mortal army could cross the winter
passes, even if it had the key, and the men of Glenorchy would wipe
out the starving remnants at their leisure. Full of confidence he
posted across Scotland to Inveraray. There he found that all was
quiet. Rumours of a foray in Lorn were indeed rife, but the
burghers of Inveraray, strong in their generations of peace, had no
fear for themselves. Argyll saw to the defences of his castle, and
called a great gathering of his clansmen to provide reinforcements,
if such should be needed, for the Glenorchy and Breadalbane men,
who by that time had assuredly made an end of Montrose.</p>
<p>Suddenly came the thunderbolt. Wild-eyed shepherds rushed into
the streets with the cry that the Macdonalds were upon them.
Quickly the tale grew. Montrose was not in Breadalbane or on the
fringes of Lorn; he was at Loch Awe&mdash;nay, he was in the heart
of Argyll itself. The chief waited no longer. He found a
fishing-boat and, the wind being right, fled down Loch Fyne to the
shelter of his castle of Roseneath. The same breeze that filled his
sails brought the sound of Alasdair's pipes, and<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> he was
scarcely under way ere the van of the invaders came down Glen
Shira. The miracle had happened, and the impregnable fortress had
fallen. "We see," commented Mr. Robert Baillie piously, but
obscurely, "there is no strength or refuge on earth against the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>
<p>Then began the harrying of Clan Campbell. Leaderless and
unprepared, they made small resistance to Montrose's lean and
battle-worn warriors. Macleans and Macdonalds, Stewarts and
Camerons, satiated their ancient grudges with the plunder of
Inveraray. The kerns thawed their frozen limbs at the warmth of
blazing steadings, and appeased their hunger at the expense of the
bakers and vintners and fleshers of the burgh. Never had the broken
men of Lochaber and the Isles fared so nobly. For some happy weeks
they ran riot in what for them was a land of milk and honey; while
the townsmen, crouching in cellars and thickets, or safe behind the
castle gates, wondered how long it would be before their chief
returned to avenge them. There seems to have been no special
barbarity about the treatment of Inveraray. Here and there a
refractory Campbell may have been dirked, but Alasdair's men sought
victuals and cattle rather than blood.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>Meantime word had gone from the exile at Roseneath to the
Estates in Edinburgh. William Baillie of Letham, the new
commander-in-chief, was a natural son of Sir William Baillie of
Lamington; an old soldier of Gustavus, he had done good service at
Marston Moor and at the siege of Newcastle, and he brought to
Scotland some of the best of Leven's infantry, which he increased
by local levies. He took up the task unwillingly, and his distaste
was not lessened by the behaviour of Argyll, who required that he
should take instructions from him. Baillie refused, and, says he in
his "Vindication," "My lord seemed to be displeased, and expressed
himself so unto some, that if he lived he should remember it,
wherein his lordship indeed hath superabundantly been as good as
his word."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id=
"FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class=
"fnanchor">[354]</a> He was instructed by<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> the
Estates to repair to Roseneath and consult with Argyll on the best
way of crushing Montrose. But at Roseneath he found the exile in a
difficult humour. There must be no stranger general in the Campbell
fastness. It was for the chief, and for the chief alone, to avenge
the wrongs of his clan. Accordingly, the Estates ordered Baillie to
transfer to Argyll sixteen companies of foot, representing the
flower of the Scottish militia. Baillie himself was sent to Perth,
and was presently given Sir John Hurry (who had been a royalist a
year before and was to be a royalist again) as his second in
command and master of horse.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id=
"FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class=
"fnanchor">[355]</a> He was bidden keep in touch with the
Covenanting garrison that had been left in Aberdeen and with
Seaforth's northern army in Inverness. Argyll, at Roseneath, had
had a fall from his horse which incapacitated him from leading his
troops in person, so he sent hastily to the army in Ireland to
summon back his kinsman, Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck, the
best soldier that the clan could boast.<a name="FNanchor_356_356"
id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class=
"fnanchor">[356]</a> It looked as if the king's lieutenant had
walked into a final trap. He would be caught between Argyll and
Seaforth, and if he tried to escape to the right Baillie and Hurry
would await him. It seemed the certainty on which Argyll loved to
stake. His view was that of the general's ministerial cousin, Mr.
Robert Baillie: "If we get not the life of these worms chirted out
of them, the reproach will stick on us for ever."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> January</div>
<p>Midwinter that year was open and mild; the sun shone brightly on
Christmas Day. Had it been otherwise, Clan Campbell, driven out of
house and home, must have been all but annihilated, and Montrose
would never have led his men safely out of Argyll. About the middle
of January he gave the order for the march.<a name=
"FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> He had as yet no
news of Argyll's preparations, but he must have realized that the
avenger would not be slow on his track. His immediate intention was
to come to an account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id=
"Page_220">[220]</a></span> with Seaforth, who not only barred him
from the Gordon country, but was chiefly responsible for the
opposition of the Moray and Speyside gentry, and the powerful clan
of Mackenzie. He had guides who promised to show him an easy way
out of Lorn into Lochaber, whence the road ran straight by the
Great Glen to Inverness. Laden with miscellaneous plunder, and
cumbered no doubt with <i>spreaghs</i> of cattle, the army passed
the north end of Loch Awe, where Alasdair is said to have rescued
certain kinsmen from the dungeons of "a strong castle."<a name=
"FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> In the Pass of
Brander legend says that an old woman with a scythe opposed the
advance and killed a soldier, and that Montrose intervened to save
her life.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id=
"FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class=
"fnanchor">[359]</a> Arrived at the shore of Loch Etive, the bulk
of the army turned west towards the narrows at Connel. The shorter
road by Glen Etive, King's House, and the Moor of Rannoch, was no
route for a heavily-laden force in midwinter, but a detachment may,
as tradition avers, have followed the steep brink of the loch to
Glen Etive, and there crossed the <i>beallach</i> by the old drove
road to Appin.</p>
<p>The march from Loch Awe had been in the teeth of a violent
south-west gale, but at Connel a windless calm fell upon the sea.
It was the weather for crossing, but there were no boats, the land
behind them was a provisionless desert, and the great Campbell keep
of Dunstaffnage lay menacingly on their flank. The situation was
saved by Campbell of Ardchattan&mdash;a Macdonald on his mother's
side&mdash;who undertook to supply ferry-boats on condition that
his lands were unmolested. By means of these, in two days of bright
sunshine, the army crossed Loch Etive, the horses swimming
alongside. The first camp in Be<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>nderloch was made
memorable by the shipwreck of an armed sloop sent by Argyll to
harass the flank of the march; it and its brass guns became the
prize of the royalists. Also 150 young men of the Appin Stewarts
arrived as recruits. Montrose hurried north through Appin, and was
welcomed by the MacIans of Glencoe. Once again the weather broke,
this time in a thunderstorm and a deluge of rain, and the roaring
Cona seemed to offer an impassable barrier. But boats were somehow
found, the river was crossed at its mouth, the sky cleared, and the
advance continued&mdash;either by Glencoe, Loch Treig and Glen
Spean, or by Loch Leven and Mamore. The king's lieutenant was safe
in Lochaber.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id=
"FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class=
"fnanchor">[360]</a></p>
<p>Montrose halted one night at Inverlochy, but no more. He had
Seaforth in front of him, and Argyll behind, and dared not tarry.
By the evening of Wednesday the 29th of January, he was at
Kilcumin, at the head of Loch Ness, in a none too friendly country.
The weather continued to be mild and dry for the season of the
year. Most of the Atholl men and the bulk of Clanranald had left
him, after their custom, to deposit their booty. No more than 1,500
remained&mdash;Alasdair's Irish, a few hundred Macdonalds,
Stewarts, Macleans, and Camerons, and sufficient horse to mount the
Lowland gentry and provide an escort for the standard.</p>
<p>At Kilcumin Montrose had definite news of Seaforth. He was
thirty miles off at Inverness with 5,000 men&mdash;Frasers,
Mackenzies, and regulars from the Inverness garrison; a disorderly
multitude, says Wishart, for, apart from the old soldiers of the
garrison, it was "a mere rabble of new levies, peasants, drovers,
shopmen, servants, and camp-followers."<a name="FNanchor_361_361"
id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class=
"fnanchor">[361]</a> Montrose was preparing to make short work of
Seaforth, when he received graver tidings. Ian Lom
Macdonald,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id=
"FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class=
"fnanchor">[362]</a> the bard of Keppoch, arrived by the hill-road
from Glen Roy to tell of Argyll at his heels. The Campbells were
less than thirty mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id=
"Page_222">[222]</a></span>es behind at Inverlochy, 3,000
men-at-arms eager to avenge the shame of Lorn. They were burning
and harrying Glen Spean and Glen Roy and the Lochaber braes, and
their object was to take Montrose in rear what time Seaforth should
hold him in front.</p>
<p>At Kilcumin Montrose had prepared a bond to which all the chiefs
set their names. Such bonds and manifestos were favourite devices
of the king's lieutenant. They were his Covenants, the only means
by which he could advertise to the world the principles for which
he fought. The signatories swore to fight to the death for their
sovereign and his legitimate authority against the "present
perverse and infamous faction of desperate rebels now in fury
against him," and never to swerve from their oath as they "would be
reputed famous men."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id=
"FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class=
"fnanchor">[363]</a> The little army had need of all the heartening
it could get, for its plight seemed hopeless. Fifteen hundred very
weary men were caught between two forces of 5,000 and 3,000. There
was no way of escape to west or east, for the one would lead them
to a bare sea-coast, and the other into the arms of Baillie's foot.
Of the two hostile forces Seaforth's burghers were the less
formidable. Montrose knew well that the fighting spirit of Clan
Diarmaid was equal to any in the Highlands, and, now that they were
commanded by a skilled soldier and infuriated by the burning of
their homes, he could not hope to fight them at long odds. But it
is the duty of a good general, when he is confronted by two urgent
perils, to meet the greater first. Montrose resolved to fight the
Campbells, but to fight them in his own way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> Jan.-Feb.</div>
<p>Early on the morning of Friday, the 31st of January, began that
flank march which is one of the great exploits in the history of
British arms.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id=
"FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class=
"fnanchor">[364]</a> The little river Tarff flows north from the
Monadliath mountains to Loch Ness. Up its rocky course went
Montrose, and the royal army disappeared into the hills. Scouts of
Argyll or Seaforth who traversed the Great Glen on that day must
have reported no enemy. From Tarff Montrose crossed the pass to
Glen Turritt, and following it downward reached Glen Roy. Pushing
on through the night, he came to the bridge of Roy, where that
stream enters the Spean, on the morning of Saturday the 1st of
February.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> February</div>
<p>The weather on the high hills was deathly cold, and the march
had been through a hyperborean hell. The upper glens were choked
with snowdrifts, ravines had to be threaded where avalanches and
cornices of ice overhung the adventurers, the rocks were glazed,
and impassable save for Highland brogues. Passes were crossed so
narrow and steep that a dozen men could have held an army at bay.
But there were no patrols of Argyll among those inhospitable
wastes; the only enemies were cold and hunger and the uttermost
fatigue. The army had neither food nor fire. Now and then in a
patch of wood a hind or roedeer may have been found, and its blood
lapped and its uncooked flesh devoured by the fortunate
discoverers. The rations for gentle and simple alike were oatmeal
and water. As they struggled along at the pace of a deerstalker,
Montrose walked by his men, shaming them to endurance by the
spectacle of his own courage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id=
"Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>From Roy Bridge to Inverlochy is some thirteen miles. But to
take Argyll by surprise a circuit was necessary, and Montrose
followed the northern slopes of the wild tangle of mountains, the
highest in Britain, that surround Ben Nevis.<a name=
"FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> He crossed the Spean
at a ford below the present house of Corriechoille, and seems to
have met a foraying party of Argyll's and stopped their mouths for
ever.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Hugging the skirts
of the hills, he went by Kilchonate and Leanachan, and before
darkness fell was at the base of Meall-an-t'suidhe. In the ruddy
gloaming of the February day the vanguard saw beneath and before
them the tower of Inverlochy scowling by the sea waves, and not a
mile off the men of Clan Diarmaid making ready their evening meal.
They had been within sight during the day of that spot, Mucomir, on
the north bank of the Spean, where another Graham was to review the
assembled clans on the eve of Killiecrankie.<a name=
"FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>
<p>Shots were exchanged with the enemy pickets, but no effort was
made to advance. The surprise had been achieved; it need not be
prematurely disclosed. Montrose waited quietly in the gathering
dusk till, by eight o'clock, the rest of his famished column had
arrived. There, supperless and cold, they passed the night,
lighting no fires, and keeping up a desultory skirmishing with the
Campbell outposts. The moon was full, and the dark masses of both
armies were visible to each other. Argyll thought the force he saw
only a contingent of Highland raiders under Keppoch or some petty
chief. As Montrose watched the strip of moonlit loch between him
and the dark hills of Loch Eil, he saw lights moving towards a
little vessel which swung at anchor. Argyll had been persuaded by
the Campbell c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id=
"Page_225">[225]</a></span>hiefs to retire to his lymphad and take
no part in the coming battle. There was little reason why he
should, and charges of cowardice are foolish. Auchinbreck, not he,
was in command; he was not by physique a useful fighting man, and
he was still suffering from a damaged shoulder; he was the chief
pillar of the Covenant in Scotland, and the head of a great clan;
for him to risk his life, sword in hand, against desperate men was
against every counsel of prudence and common sense. Alan
McIldowie's prophecy, too, may have influenced his clan in their
determination to keep him out of action. His companions on the
galley were Sir James Rollo, Wauchope of Niddrie, an Edinburgh
bailie, and a minister, Mr. Mungo Law, whom we may take to have
been the travelling committee which the Estates were accustomed to
send out to fortify their generals.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id=
"FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class=
"fnanchor">[368]</a></p>
<p>At dawn on Candlemas Day, the 2nd of February, his ears were
greeted by an unwelcome note. It was no bagpipes such as Keppoch
might use, but trumpets of war, and the salute they sounded was
that reserved for the royal standard. Then came the fierce Cameron
pibroch, "Sons of dogs, come and I will give you flesh." The king's
lieutenant, who two days before was for certain at Loch Ness, had
by some craft of darkness taken wings and flown his army over the
winter hills. There was no alternative but to fight. Till Montrose
was beaten the Campbells could neither march forward to join
Seaforth nor backward to their own land.</p>
<p>Auchinbreck drew up his forces with the fighting men of Clan
Campbell in the centre, and the Lowland regiments borrowed from
Baillie on each wing. A stiffening of Highlanders was added to the
flanks, and behind the main battle was a strong Highland reserve
with two field-pieces. Montrose placed the Irish on his
wings&mdash;the right under Alasdair, and the left under O'Cahan;
he himself led the centre, which was composed of the Atholl, Appin,
and Glencoe men and the Camerons; Clanranald and Glengarry had the
second line, and there was a mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> Highland and Ulster
reserve. Sir Thomas Ogilvy commanded the little troop of horse
which had managed to make its way with the infantry over the
terrible hills. This was the one advantage Montrose possessed;
otherwise he had an army inferior in numbers by at least a
thousand, weary with travel and on the brink of starvation, having
had scarcely a mouthful for forty-eight hours. He himself and Lord
Airlie had no breakfast except a little raw oatmeal mixed with cold
water, which they ate with their dirks.<a name="FNanchor_369_369"
id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class=
"fnanchor">[369]</a></p>
<p>Before battle the Catholics in his ranks knelt in prayer, while
their priests signed their arms with the cross.<a name=
"FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The action began
with the charge of Alasdair and O'Cahan against the enemy wings;
they reserved their fire till, in Patrick Gordon's words, "they
gave it in their breath." The firing of famished men with ancient
muskets may have been wild, but in a second they were come, as
Montrose wrote, "to push of pike and dint of sword." The Lowlanders
made no stand; in spite of the experience of many of them with
Leven, a Highland charge was a new and awful thing to them, and
they speedily broke and fled. This left the centre with naked
flanks, and down upon it came Montrose. It was forced back on its
second line, which, instead of opening ranks to receive it and so
constituting a new battle-front, itself wavered and cracked.
Inverlochy was won by strategy. Of tactics there was little, and
that little was as rudimentary as at Tippermuir. The Campbell
clansmen, outflanked and unsupported, did indeed make a valiant
stand; "stout and gallant men," says Wishart, "worthy of a better
chief and a juster cause." They knew that they could expect no
mercy from their hereditary foes, to whom they had shown none, and
they were not forgetful of the honourable traditions of their
name.</p>
<p>But in time they also broke. Some rushed into the loch and tried
in vain to reach the galley of their chief, now fleeing to safety;
some fled to the tower of Inverlochy, where they presently
surrendered. Most scattered along the shore, and on that blue
February noon there was a fierce sl<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>aughter from the mouth of
Nevis down to the narrows of Loch Leven. The Lowlanders were given
quarter, but, in spite of all his efforts, Montrose could win no
mercy for the luckless Campbells. The green Diarmaid tartan was a
badge of death that day. The western Camerons, hitherto dubious
allies of Argyll, now came over to the royal cause and joined in
the pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id=
"FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class=

"fnanchor">[372]</a> but one of them was Sir Thomas Ogilvy, who
died shortly after the battle. On the Covenant side the slain
almost equalled the whole of Montrose's army. At least fifteen
hundred fell in the flight, and among them were the veteran
Auchinbreck, and forty of the Campbell barons.<a name=

<br>
<p>Inverlochy was in one respect a decisive victory, for it
destroyed the clan power of Argyll. From its terrible toll the
Campbells as a fighting force never recovered. Alasdair's policy
was justified, and the Macdonalds were amply avenged; the heather,
as the phrase went, was above the gale at last.<a name=

"#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> To Montrose at the
moment it seemed even more. He thought that with the galley of Lorn
fell also the blue flag of the Covenant. He wrote straightway to
the king, giving him a full account of the fight, and ending on a
high note of confidence:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> February</div>
<p>It was not till March that Charles received tidings of
Inverlochy. By that time he had already rejected the proposals of
the Treaty of Uxbridge, one of which was that Montrose should be
exempted from the act of oblivion, and the news of Argyll's
disaster gave him hopes of a diversion in the north. He wrote to
Montrose telling him that he was sending him 500 horse under Sir
Philip Musgrave, and announcing that he himself with his army would
make his way to Scotland with all possible dispatch. It was a
scheme of Digby's which Cromwell was soon to frustrate. Steadily
since Marston Moor antagonism had been growing between the new
great English soldier and the older generals of the Parliament. In
especial Cromwell hated the Scots and the Presbyterians, and all
who had art or part in the Solemn League and Covenant. "Against
these" (the Scots), wrote Manchester in November 1644, "his
animosity was such, as he told me, in the way they now carried
themselves, pressing for their discipline, he could as soon draw
his sword against them as against any in the king's army."<a name=

<p>Inverlochy had an important effect on Leven at Carlisle, since
it increased his reluctance to move south, as Parliament demanded,
while Montrose was at large north of the Border. To the Estates in
Edinburgh it brought disappointment and panic. Argyll arrived ten
days after the battle, with his arm in a sling, to be publicly
thanked for his services. Baillie and Hurry were exhorted to fresh
efforts, and further calls were made upon Leven. On the 11th of
February James Graham, sometime Earl of Montrose, was declared a
traitor and his life and estates forfeited.<a name=

Mr. David Dickson, Mr. Robert Blair, Mr. Andrew Cant, Mr. James
Guthrie, and Mr. Patrick Gillespie attended as a deputation from
the General Assembly to urge their immediate execution. Parliament
commended the "zeal and piety" of the clergy, but hinted that, with
Montrose victorious in the field, it would be as well to wait a
little before making an end of his hostages. It contented itself
with, for no apparent reason, outlawing Carnwath, and declaring
"whosoever shall kill him to have done good service to his
country."<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id=

<p>After resting a few days at Inverlochy, Montrose marched
northward again. The right course, had it been possible, would have
been an immediate descent upon the capital. But for Lowland warfare
he needed cavalry, and cavalry could not be manufactured in
Lochaber. To get them he must go where alone in the north they
could be had&mdash;among the Gordon gentry. He found that the
opposition had melted away. Having no war-chest, he was compelled
to provide for his forces by fines and requisitions from the
Covenanting lairds, and when these were not forthcoming there was
burning and pi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id=

"FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class=
"fnanchor">[381]</a> Inverness was too strongly garrisoned to take,
so Montrose passed it by, having no nervousness about fortresses in
his rear. On Friday, the 19th, he entered Elgin without sign of
Seaforth or any other opponent. The Mackenzies had disappeared into
the fastnesses of Kintail. At Elgin, to his joy, he found that
recruits began to come in. The first was the laird of Grant with
300 men, and at a plundering of the houses of certain Covenanting
absentees the new convert showed himself highly assiduous.<a name=
"FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>
<p>Presently came a far more welcome ally. Nathaniel Gordon's
politic desertion had been fruitful; he rode over from the Bog of
Gight, bringing with him no less a person than Huntly's heir, now
weary of the ways of his uncle Argyll.<a name="FNanchor_383_383"
id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class=
"fnanchor">[383]</a> Lord Gordon was accompanied by his brother,
Lord Lewis, whom we have already seen twice arrayed against
Montrose at Aberdeen, first with Aboyne and then with Burleigh. He
was still in his teens, a fiery and perverse young man, of
undoubted gallantry, but of an excitable and fantastic mind. With
the Gordons, as an earnest of Gordon support, came 200 well-mounted
troopers, a sight to gladden Montrose's eyes, for cavalry could
alone make possible that Lowland campaign on which he had set his
heart. Lord Gordon was more than a comrade in arms; he was to
prove, for the short span of life that remained to him, Montrose's
tenderest and truest friend. Last of all came Seaforth to make his
peace; he had never been much of a Covenanter, but Mackenzie and
Macdonald could not easily mix. Montrose received him joyfully, and
dispatched him to hold his own countryside for the king. At Elgin,
and at the Bog of Gight, which was the next halting-place of the
royal army, the bond prepared at Kilcumin received further
signat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id=
"Page_232">[232]</a></span>ures. It is odd to read in the document,
which is still preserved in the Montrose charter-chest, the names
of Grant and Seaforth beside the scrawls of Alasdair and
Clanranald, and to remember that, when the latter signed, the
former were the foes against whom the bond was aimed.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> March</div>
<p>Montrose had now a compact force of 2,000 foot and about 200
horse. The backbone of his infantry was still Alasdair's Irish, who
may have numbered a thousand men. The Lochaber and Badenoch clans
had gone home with their booty after Inverlochy, and the rest were
Stewarts and Robertsons, the remnant of the Atholl levies, the 300
Grants, and small contingents from Moray, Nairn, and the Gordons.
The cavalry, with the exception of the few who had been with
Ogilvy, were wholly Gordon. Montrose may well have believed himself
strong enough, what with the hope of further Gordon aid and the
certainty of more recruits from Atholl, to meet Baillie on equal
terms south of the Tay.</p>
<p>At Gight he suffered a sore bereavement. His eldest boy, Lord
Graham, now in his fifteenth year, had been his father's companion
ever since William Forrett had brought him to Perth after
Tippermuir. The swift marches over the winter hills had worn him
out, and his life was part of the price paid for that miraculous
descent on Inverlochy. He died in the early days of March, and was
buried in the neighbouring kirk of Bellie. Shortly after, old Lord
Airlie fell dangerously sick, and was sent to Huntly's castle of
Strathbogie, with a guard of several hundred men, which the royal
army could ill afford. Montrose had to lock up his grief in his
heart, for there was no time to spare for sorrowing. He marched
east, and by the 9th of March was close upon Aberdeen. There had
been much plundering of the little towns and the lands of
Covenanting lairds, but no shedding of blood. Aberdeen had been
evacuated by Covenant troops; a deputation of its burgesses met him
at Turriff, and, remembering with regret his last visit, he
undertook that his Irish should not come within eight miles of the
city.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id=
"Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>There, however, grave misfortune befell the royal army.
Nathaniel Gordon, with eighty cavaliers, rode into Aberdeen from
the camp at Kintore on a friendly errand of amusement. Word was
sent by certain local Covenanters to Sir John Hurry, who was in the
Mearns with his Covenant cavalry. This soldier of fortune, who at
Oxford had given Rupert that warning of the Parliamentary convoy at
Thame, which led to the battle of Chalgrove Field and John
Hampden's death, had the military virtue of speed. With a
detachment of Balcarres's horse, Hurry made a dash on the city in
the evening. Such royalists as he found in the street were promptly
cut down, most of the horses were driven off, and among the dead
was Donald Farquharson, the bailie of Strathavon and the chief
member of the great family of Braemar. It was an irreparable loss,
for he had been one of the best of Montrose's lieutenants. "One of
the noblest captains among all the Highland-men of Scotland," wrote
Spalding,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id=
"FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class=
"fnanchor">[384]</a> and Patrick Gordon is eloquent on his virtues.
"He was beloved of all sorts of people, and could not be otherwise,
for he was of such a harmless and innocent carriage that there was
none alive whom he could hate; he was never seen to be angry, nor
knew he what that unruly passion meant, and yet he gave proof of as
much true courage as any man could have; he was so far from pride
and vain-glory that he was all men's companion, not out of silly
simplicity, but out of a gentle and mild freedom, in a nature which
did always dispose him to a joyful alacrity, for his conversation,
even in the saddest and most desperate times, was ever jocund and
cheerful."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id=
"FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class=
"fnanchor">[385]</a> Hurry made off as fast as he had come, and on
his way back took prisoner the new Lord Graham, who was with his
tutor at Montrose, and sent him to Edinburgh. The king's lieutenant
waited in Aberdeen to bury the dead Farquharson, at whose funeral
Alasdair behaved with almost complete propriety;<a name=
"FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and then on Monday,
the 18th of March, began his southward journey.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id=
"Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>There was burning in the Mearns and the braes of Angus, now a
laird's house, now a manse, and, as the parish records show, there
was a general upsetting of life and a fleeing of Covenanters to
strong places. It was done under strict discipline, and
unauthorized practitioners were hanged.<a name="FNanchor_387_387"
id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class=
"fnanchor">[387]</a> On 21st March the town of Stonehaven was
burned, and the outbuildings of Dunnottar castle. Marischal, who,
like so many Scots nobles, blew hot and cold in turn, was for the
present by way of being a Covenanter, and in the company of sixteen
ministers watched from its impregnable keep the destruction of his
lands, finding what comfort he could in the consolation of Mr.
Andrew Cant that the smoke of his barns was "a sweet-smelling
incense in the nostrils of the Lord." By the end of March Montrose
was at Fettercairn, with Hurry and his 600 horse only six miles
off. There he all but made an end of Hurry. That general, confident
in his cavalry, came out to battle near Halkerton castle, and,
believing from his scouts' reports that only 200 horse were opposed
to him, charged them gaily. But behind the horse Montrose had
concealed his best musketeers in a glen of a burn, and Hurry was
received with a fire which emptied his saddles and put his cavalry
in confusion. Then the royalist horse turned and charged, and Hurry
fled in-continent across the South Esk, never drawing rein till he
had covered the twenty-four miles between him and Dundee. Next day
the royalists occupied Brechin, which was plundered, and the town
of Montrose, which was spared by the general for the sake of old
times.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> April</div>
<p>Here he heard of the advance of a more considerable opponent
than Hurry. Baillie, with 3,000 seasoned infantry, was blocking the
road to the south. Veteran troops had been recalled from Ireland,
and Leven had given up some of his best regulars.<a name=
"FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Montrose hastened to
meet him, and found him in the neighbourhood of Coupar-Angus. But
Baillie was a cautious commander, and he respected his enemy. He
was determined to fight only on the m<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>ost favourable ground, and
he knew that Fabian tactics were the likeliest to wear out an army
which had no base, no reserves, and no coherence save in the
personal influence of its leader. The river Isla ran between the
two forces, and Montrose dared not try to wrest the passage in the
face of superior strength. So in the true cavalier fashion he sent
Baillie a challenge, offering to cross and fight him, if the
passage were permitted, or to let him cross unhindered if he
preferred the other bank. Baillie wisely replied that he would
fight at his own pleasure, and not to suit his adversary's
convenience.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was hopeless to wait longer, Montrose devised a
new plan. He struck camp and marched west to Dunkeld, with the
intention of descending on the Lowlands by another road. At Dunkeld
he could cross the Tay in safety, and after that he had a straight
path to the Forth. Baillie could not keep up with him, and retired
south&mdash;on his way to Fife, it was reported. Now was the chance
for that avalanche from the hills which would sweep the Covenanting
Lowlands, and gather up with it all the disaffected and
anti-Covenant elements which Montrose believed to be plentiful in
the south of Scotland. Baillie had obviously gone off to hold the
bridges and fords of Forth, and it would be strange if Highlanders,
with less ground to cover, could not get there before him.</p>
<p>But at Dunkeld Montrose was to be reminded of the nature of the
Highland army which he led. Once more his forces began to melt
away. The Atholl men slipped back to their homes, and so did the
recent levies from the north of the Grampians. The Gordon cavalry,
led by Lord Lewis, began to grumble, and, though they did not
desert yet awhile, he knew that he could not long count on their
assistance.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id=
"FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class=
"fnanchor">[389]</a> Presently his strength had shrunk so gravely
that any attempt on the Lowlands was out of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>the
question.</p>
<p>Something must be done if only to keep his remnant together.
Twenty-four miles off lay the town of Dundee, the chief base of the
Covenant in Angus. To read Dundee a lesson might be a profitable
employment, till he saw his way more clearly. Moreover, his
soldiers were short of every kind of supply. Their clothes scarcely
held together, and they were shod for the most part with sandals
made of the raw hides of looted cattle.<a name="FNanchor_390_390"
id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class=
"fnanchor">[390]</a> He had now no infantry but Alasdair's Irish.
Of them he sent the weaker half on to Brechin with the baggage, and
with 600 foot and 150 horse left Dunkeld at midnight on the 3rd of
April. By ten o'clock next morning he was under the walls of
Dundee.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id=
"FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class=
"fnanchor">[391]</a></p>
<p>Dundee in the year 1645 was a little town with a big kirk and a
market-place in the centre, from which radiated the four main
streets. It had a volunteer garrison and substantial walls, and
inside the walled area at the north-west corner was a mound called
the Corbie Hill, long since levelled, on which guns had been
mounted. Montrose sent a trumpeter, one John Gordon, a servant of
the laird of Rothiemay, to summon the magistrates to surrender, but
the reply tarried, and the assault was begun before it could be
written, so the envoy was committed to the Tolbooth.<a name=
"FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Dundee was a strong
place, but the walls were being mended in the north-west angle, and
there the royalists soon made a breach. The guns on the Corbie Hill
were captured and turned against the town, the defenders of the
West Port and the Nethergait Port were taken in the rear, and
presently the ch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id=
"Page_237">[237]</a></span>urch and the market-place were in the
invaders' hands. Several houses were set on fire, but pillage
rather than burning was the order of the day. The booths of the
merchants were turned inside out, and the plenishing of many a
well-doing citizen took to the streets on Highland backs.<a name=
"FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Stores of ale and
wine were discovered, and soon many of the assailants, who had
marched all night without a halt, were in that state of bodily and
mental ease which Wishart describes as "vino paululum
incalescentes."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id=
"FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class=
"fnanchor">[394]</a></p>
<p>It was now late afternoon, and, as Montrose stood on the Corbie
Hill watching the ongoings in the town, his scouts brought him
startling news. Baillie and Hurry had not crossed the Tay on their
way to Fife. With 3,000 foot and 800 horse they were now within a
mile of the West Port of Dundee. It was as parlous a position as
any commander ever stood in, and his colonels gave counsels of
despair. Some urged him to leave his half-drunken troops to their
fate and save himself, on the plea that another army could be
found, but not a second Montrose. Others, of a more heroic temper,
cried out that all was lost but honour, and were for dying in a
desperate charge. Only Montrose kept his head. He was resolved to
escape, not alone, but with his army&mdash;a decision which shows
the flawless courage of the man. Somehow or other&mdash;how, Heaven
only knows&mdash;he beat off his men from their plunder: a feat,
says Mr. Gardiner, "beyond the power of any other commander in
Europe." Four hundred of his foot he sent on in front, and behind
them he kept 200 of his best musketeers, as a support to the horse
in case of a stand. Last, as rearguard, went his 150 cavalry. As
the royalists rode out of the Seagait and the East Port, Baillie
entered at the West Port, and Hurry's van was within a gunshot of
Montrose's rear.</p>
<p>Night had now fallen, the clear night of a northern April, but
the Covenanters were confident of their prey. Hurry followed hard
on Montrose as he marched ea<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>st along the sea-coast. A
few miles from Dundee he tried to charge, but the picked musketeers
among the royalist horse were too much for him, and their fire beat
off his 800 troopers. He fell back, while the king's lieutenant
pushed on in the direction of Arbroath. The shock of peril had
sobered the Irish, and they marched like heroes. Meanwhile Baillie
had conceived a better plan. He knew that Montrose must break
westward for the hills as soon as possible, not only for safety,
but to pick up the men he had sent on to await him at Brechin. He
observed, too, that his enemy was marching along the arc of a
circle, and he resolved himself to take the chord. He had made
arrangements for guarding the nearest hill passes, and he hurried
north-east towards Arbroath to hem his enemy between his troops and
the sea.</p>
<p>It was precisely the strategy that Montrose had anticipated. At
midnight he turned sharp in his tracks, marched south-west to
Panbride, and then north by Carmyllie, Guthrie, and Melgund, and so
quietly slipped round Baillie in the dark. By daybreak he was at
Careston castle, a Carnegie house on the South Esk, with the
friendly hills in sight and at hand. Here he had news from Brechin
that the men who were to meet him there had already been given the
alarm, and had betaken themselves to the mountains. He halted for a
little to give his weary troops a breathing-space. In the past
thirty-six hours they had marched fifty or sixty miles, fought
several engagements, drunk quantities of liquor, and sacked a town.
When the halt was sounded nearly every man dropped to the ground
and slept like the dead.</p>

<p class="caption">The Campaign of Dundee and Auldearn</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Meanwhile Baillie at the first light of dawn had discovered his
mistake. Hurry had rejoined him, and Hurry's cavalry were soon hot
on the trail of the man who had so befooled them. Montrose got the
alarm in time, but his sleepy soldiers would not stir. It looked as
if the three miles which still intervened before the hills were won
might be three miles too many, and the labours of that marvellous
night rendered vain. But the officers, at the point of the sword,
managed to beat up sufficien<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>t troops to make some sort
of stand, and Hurry's horse were checked.<a name="FNanchor_395_395"
id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class=
"fnanchor">[395]</a> Then, with a last desperate effort, the
exhausted royalists managed to struggle the last miles into a
country of heath and bog, where cavalry could not follow them.
Hurry fell back, and by midday Montrose was safe among the wilds of
the North Esk.</p>
<p>The retreat from Dundee, however we look at it, remains an
astonishing feat of arms. Hurry's cavalry were the troops which had
done brilliant service under Leven, and Baillie's foot contained
some of the best first-line regiments that Scotland could show. Man
for man the Gordon horse, sulky and mutinous as they already were,
could not compare with them. The Irish were, of course, tried
veterans, and superior to any of the Covenant infantry. But
Montrose's men were at the best bone-weary, and at the worst
half-drunk and laden with their precious plunder. The general who
could stop the sack of a town in a few minutes was a superb leader
of men, and he who could execute such a flight was a consummate
strategist. "Which," wrote Wishart, "whether foreign nations or
after times will believe I cannot tell, but I am sure I deliver
nothing but what is most certain of my own knowledge. And truly,
among expert soldiers and those of eminent note, both in England,
Germany, and France, I have not seldom heard this expedition of his
preferred before Montrose's greatest victories."<a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> April</div>
<p>The letter written by the king in March, promising a body of
horse and holding out hope of his own coming to Scotland, was
carried by a gentleman of the name of Small, and found Montrose
somewhere among the Grampians. On his way back to the royal
headquarters the messenger, disguised as a common beggar, was
seized by the Covenanters on the south shore of the Firth of Forth,
taken to Edinburgh on 28th April, tried and condemned, and hanged
on 1st May. Small had been captured by the Estates the year before,
and banished the kingdom under pain of death, so his fate was
strictly in accordance with law.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id=
"FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class=
"fnanchor">[397]</a> From the documents in his possession his
captors had their first news of the king's intention, and it deeply
disquieted them. They disseminated wild reports of the flight from
Dundee, declaring, in order to allay popular fears, that only a few
royalists had escaped to the mountains. But Argyll could not
deceive himself, and he knew that the coming north of the king,
with Montrose unbeaten in the field, meant that he and his
ambitions would be caught between two fires. He communicated his
anxiety to the generals, and Covenanting strategy acquired a new
vigour. The credit probably belongs to Hurry, for Baillie, though a
competent soldier, never displayed any strategic ability. The
Covenant army was divided. Instead of pursuing the elusive enemy in
one cumbrous wh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id=
"Page_241">[241]</a></span>ole, it was resolved to try to hold him
between two separate forces operating from different bases. The
Estates ordered a levy of 8,800 infantry and 485 cavalry from the
counties south of the Tay, and many cadets of Lothian and Border
houses joined the Covenant standard. It was believed that north of
the Grampians large forces could be raised, so Hurry, borrowing
from Baillie 1,200 foot&mdash;the regiments of Loudoun and
Lothian<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id=
"FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class=
"fnanchor">[398]</a>&mdash;and keeping 160 of his horse, hastened
north to pick up these levies and to form the upper millstone for
the projected grinding of Montrose. Baillie, with 2,000 foot and
500 horse, settled himself in the neighbourhood of Perth.</p>
<p>For Montrose there was once more the weary task of finding an
army. Lord Gordon was dispatched to Strathbogie to try to raise
Gordon troopers in place of those who had gone off with his
petulant brother. Alasdair went west into the Macdonald country to
whip up those of his clan who had departed after
Inverlochy.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id=
"FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class=
"fnanchor">[399]</a> Black Pate of Inchbrakie went into Atholl to
organize the Robertsons and Stewarts. Montrose himself had to await
the result of these missions before he could again take the field.
But for him waiting was never inaction. He resolved to investigate
the state of affairs on the Highland Line, and to keep Baillie out
of mischief. He also wished to gather to his standard one or two
gentlemen of his kin who had been hiding in Menteith, and he may
have had hopes of pushing south to get some news from the royalists
across the Border. He wrote to the king from Doune on 20th
April;<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> in that letter he
spoke no longer of leading an army into England, for he had no army
to lead. The most he could do was to keep the Covenant busy in
Scotland.</p>
<p>Already with 500 foot and 50 horse he had swept down upon the
Perthshire lowlands, halting for the night at the village of
Crieff, twelve miles from Baill<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>ie's camp. The Covenant
general, as soon as he got the news, set off in the night to
surprise him, and at dawn on the 17th found the little army drawn
up for battle. A glance convinced Montrose that the odds were too
great even for him, so, with his horse fighting a rearguard action,
he retreated up the Earn past Comrie, and by the evening was safe
from pursuit at the head of Loch Earn. Next day he turned south by
Balquhidder, into the heart of the Trossachs. Here he fell in with
a welcome ally&mdash;no less than Aboyne, Huntly's second son, who
had escaped with sixteen horsemen from beleaguered Carlisle, and
had a dislocated shoulder, which did not affect him as did Argyll's
at Inverlochy. He found other friends, too, for by Loch Katrine
side he met his nephew the Master of Napier, and a son of the Earl
of Stirling, who had eluded the Covenant's vigilance.<a name=
"FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Montrose had more
than his share of family affection, and the kinsmen, says Spalding,
"were all joyful of each other."</p>
<p>Here he had news which put an end to his southern wanderings.
Baillie was busy burning in Atholl, and Hurry, now north of the
Grampians, was bidding fair to destroy Lord Gordon and his slender
forces. Hurry had failed to raise dragoons on Deeside, had had
trouble with a mutiny in Lothian's regiment, and the day before had
marched out of Aberdeen for the west. Montrose retraced his steps
by one of those lightning marches which were the despair of his
opponents and a confusion to the chroniclers of his day. He could
not fight Baillie as he was, and to meet Hurry he must first find
his Gordons. Some time on the 20th he was at Doune; by Strathyre he
reached Lochearnhead, and thence sped by Glen Ogle to Loch Tay, and
across the shoulder of Schiehallion into Atholl. Then by one of the
Angus glens he reached Glen Muick, forded Dee, and by the last day
of April was at Skene on lower Deeside.<a name="FNanchor_402_402"
id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class=

badly off for ammunition, so Aboyne undertook an expedition to
Aberdeen for the purpose of supplies. With eighty troopers the
young soldier seized the town, found twenty barrels of gunpowder in
two vessels lying in the harbour, and brought back the loot to
headquarters the same evening. Whatever the faults of the Gordon
blood, it had no lack of fire and speed.</p>
<p>Montrose's force was now a little over 2,000 foot and some 250
horse. Hurry meantime had not been idle. The Covenanters of Moray
and Elgin had risen at his call. Seaforth had recanted his lately
professed loyalty and brought the Mackenzies to his side.
Sutherland was hastening to his support with his clansmen, Lovat
rallied the glens of Beauly, and Findlater was bringing the men of
Easter Ross. The local gentry, who hated the Gordon
name&mdash;Frasers, Forbeses, Roses, Inneses,
Crichtons&mdash;carried their swords to his standard. He had under
him four regular regiments, all first-line, and two of them among
the best in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id=
"FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class=
"fnanchor">[404]</a> Altogether he had in being and in immediate
expectation a force of perhaps 4,000 foot and not less than 400
horse.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> While Montrose lay
on the Dee, Hurry was on Speyside with the road to Strathbogie open
before him. It was a vital matter for Montrose to keep the Gordons
in good humour, and for this purpose their lands must be protected.
So he hastened from Skene, by way of the upper Don, the Avon, and
the Spey, to give battle with all speed to the enemy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> May</div>
<p>Hurry was something of a strategist, and retired for two
reasons. First, he wanted to draw Montrose out of the friendly
hills and the Gordon country; and secondly, he had still to receive
some of the promised forces of Seaforth and Sutherland. From Elgin
to Forres he drew the royalists on, keeping only a little way
ahead, but far enough to prevent Montrose doing him harm. The ruse
succeeded. By the evening of the 8th of May Montrose had reached
the little village of Auldearn, on the ridge of high treeless
ground between the valleys of the Findhorn and the Nairn. He
believed Hurry to be retreating on Inverness, and meant to follow
him thither the next day. It was a drizzling evening, and the
neighbourhood was Covenanting to a man, loving not the Gordons nor
the Highlanders, and least of all Alasdair's Irish, whom it
remembered after Inverlochy. No news of the enemy was likely to be
got from the country-folk. Montrose pitched his camp, posted his
pickets carefully, as was his custom, and settled down for the
night.</p>
<p>The position needs exact understanding if we are to appreciate
the events that followed. The hamlet of straggling cottages ran
south from the parish kirk of St. Colm on the line of the present
Boath road. East of the village curved a low ridge of upland. Below
the houses to the west were the gardens and pig-styes of the
villagers, and beyond them lay a flattish piece of ground covered
with wildwood and sloping gently to the bog of a sluggish burn.
North of this bog was the eminence of the Castle Hill, and beyond
the burn the ground was hard. South of it, and nearly west of the
hamlet of Auldearn, stood a bare hillock, now called Deadman's Wood
and planted with trees. The burn, which caused the bog, bent round
to the south in a ravine, and so protected the south part of the
ridge which curved behind the village. The position was therefore
in the shape of a horse-shoe, if we take the firmer and higher
ground to the east as the rim. In the middle lay the village, and
enclosed between the points were the bog and the rough land which
sloped from the gardens and pig-styes. The wet weather had swollen
the stream an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id=
"Page_245">[245]</a></span>d filled the marshes, and made even the
higher ground heavy going.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id=
"FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class=

<h2>II</h2>
<p>Some time before midnight on the 8th Hurry turned to strike. It
was a moonless night with drenching rain, and the royalist patrols
were not inclined to go too far into the darkness. But Hurry gave
notice of his approach, for his men, finding the powder in their
muskets damp, fired them off to clear them. They were then five or
six miles distant, but the quick ear of Alasdair's sentinels caught
the sound, and Montrose guessed at once what was afoot. A wet,
misty dawn was breaking when he drew up his line of battle. He
placed Alasdair with a portion of the Irish and some of the Gordon
foot at the north end of the ridge, between the village and the
Castle Hill, and into his keeping he gave the royal standard, in
order that Hurry might believe the king's lieutenant to be there in
person and deliver there his chief attack. He boldly denied himself
a centre, and instead scattered a few men in front of the cottages,
with instructions to keep up a continuous firing so that the enemy
might think the village strongly held. This&mdash;and the Castle
Hill&mdash;was the place for his cannon if he had had any, but
during the rapid marches of the past eight months he had not had
time to recover the guns which he had buried after Aberdeen. The
rest of his infantry he kept to the south of the village, concealed
behind the crown of the ridge, with the cavalry under Lord Gordon
in a hollow on his left wing. It was a brilliant disposition, made
at the shortest notice in the half-light of morning. If Hurry
attacked Alasdair under the impression that he was Montrose, he
would have difficulty with his cavalry among the village gardens,
while Montrose, at the right moment, would be free to swing round
his horse from their cover and take him unprepared on his right
flank.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id=
"Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>Three-quarters of a mile off, at Kinnudie, Hurry put his column
into line of battle. The front of advance, between the Castle Hill
and the bog, was narrow, so a single regiment, that of Lawers,
formed the van, with the three other regular regiments in support.
On his left wing, a little withdrawn, were the northern levies,
while his right wing was composed of a detachment of Moray horse
under Major Drummond. The main body of cavalry, under his personal
command, he held in reserve. His problem was more difficult than he
realized. On that narrow front he could not properly deploy his men
and reap the advantage of his superior strength. Montrose had
calculated right.</p>
<p>But there was one mistake in his calculations. Alasdair was
undermanned. He had no more than 500 men, all infantry, to oppose
the attack of at least six times their number, aided by a strong
cavalry contingent. If we remember that the musketeer of those days
was held to be unable to face cavalry unless drawn up behind hedges
or palisades, we get some notion of the desperate odds. They were
increased by Alasdair's own impetuous conduct. He was never the man
to await an onset, and while Hurry's army was struggling through
the marshy burn he sacrificed the advantages of his higher and
drier ground and rushed to meet them. Eight to one is odds reserved
to the champions of fairy tales. "Why, how the devil," asks Major
Bellenden in <i>Old Mortality</i>, "can you believe that Artamines,
or what d'ye call him, fought single-handed with a whole battalion?
One to three is as great odds as ever fought and won, and I never
knew any one who cared to take that, except old Corporal
Raddlebanes." But Alasdair's deeds were worthy of the Fianna, and
it is not hard to understand how in Gaelic legend his fame is made
to outshine Montrose's. He and his Irish conducted themselves like
the fierce warriors of the sagas. They were forced back, fighting
desperately, into the nest of enclosures in front of the village.
Like Ajax by the ships, he himself was the last to retreat. His
targe was full of pikes, but he swung his great broadsword round
and cut off their heads like cabbage-stalks. He broke his blade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id=
"Page_247">[247]</a></span>but got another from a dying comrade.
Again and again he rushed out to help the stragglers to enter. One
of his men, Ranald Mackinnon of Mull, fought swordless against a
dozen pikemen, with an arrow through both cheeks and no weapon but
his shield. So raged the Thermopyl&aelig; among the pig-styes, and every
moment Alasdair's case grew more desperate.<a name=

<p class="caption">The Battle of Auldearny</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Montrose, on the crest of the hill, learned from a galloper what
was happening, and decided that the moment had come for that stroke
on which the success of his tactics depended. The Gordon horse, in
the hollow on his left flank, could see nothing of the fight in the
village. They were not seasoned troops, and it was essential that
they should go into action in high heart. So Montrose cried to Lord
Gordon, their leader: "Macdonald drives all before him. Is his clan
to have all the honours this day? Are there to be no laurels for
the house of Huntly?" It was the word to fire their spirit.
Moreover, they had a grim wrong to avenge. They had not forgotten
the death of Donald Farquharson in Aberdeen at Hurry's hands; and a
few days before, young Gordon of Rynie, a mere boy, who had been
wounded and left behind in a cottage, had been brutally murdered by
two of Hurry's lieutenants. With the cry on their lips, "Remember
Donald Farquharson and James of Rynie!" the chivalry of Strathbogie
wheeled to the charge.</p>
<p>It was the first time that Montrose had used shock tactics.
Hitherto his horse had been so few that he had been compelled to
employ them after the old fashion of the Thirty Years' War, more
like mounted infantry, trusting largely to their pistol fire. But
he had not forgotten the new tactics which Rupert had introduced at
Edgehill, and which in Cromwell's hands had given the Ironsides the
victory at Marston Moor.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id=
"FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class=
"fnanchor">[408]</a> Now was the time for the <i>arme
blanche</i>&mdash;for cold steel and the weight of thundering
horses. Montrose had that high gift in war<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> which
can adapt its methods not only to its ends but to its material. He
could make his cavalry play a defensive part, with musketeers
interspersed, when he was too weak to do otherwise; but when the
chance came he could use it as cavalry should be used, with all the
dash and fury of a Murat; and he could inspire bonnet-lairds on
cart-horses with the spirit of the Maison du Roi.</p>
<p>Hurry, happy in his belief that he was driving Montrose to his
death in the village, was suddenly assailed by the cry of
"Strathbogie!" as the Gordons, skirting Deadman's Wood, came down
on his right flank. His flank guard, Drummond's horse, having had a
difficult time crossing the bog, were in no case to withstand that
assault of fresh cavalry with the impetus of the slope in their
favour. Moreover, in this crisis Drummond gave the wrong word of
command, and wheeled his horse to the left instead of to the right,
so that he overrode some of his own infantry, and offered a naked
rear to the Gordon assault.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id=
"FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class=
"fnanchor">[409]</a> Presently his troopers were flying, and many a
saddle was empty. Lord Gordon, with half his force, followed in
pursuit, and Aboyne, with the rest, attacked the now defenceless
flank of Hurry's regular infantry. At the same time Montrose
unleashed his reserves, hitherto concealed behind the eastern
ridge, and the whole line swept down upon the doomed four
regiments. Meanwhile, among the pig-styes, Alasdair collected his
men for a last effort. He had lost seventeen of his best officers,
but the royal standard was safe, and with his bloodstained remnant
he charged Hurry's reeling centre. It was the last straw needed to
turn the balance. The Covenant army became a mob, and the mob a
shambles. The four regiments died gallantly, but the northern
levies on their left rear, and the cavalry in reserve, fled without
striking a blow. The blood of Ulster and the Is<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>les that
day had recovered its ancient berserk fury, and the Gordons were in
no mood to spare their foes. Donald Farquharson and James of Rynie
did not go unattended to the shades.</p>
<p>For fourteen miles the pursuit continued. Of the Ulstermen who
had held the village many must have fallen, and almost all the rest
were wounded, but otherwise the royalists had suffered little. It
was very different with the Covenanters. The estimates of their
dead vary, but the number cannot have been less than 2,000. Sir
Mungo Campbell of Lawers, who fought in the centre against
Alasdair, perished with most of his fine regiment.<a name=
"FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> There fell, too, the

"fnanchor">[412]</a> It was on the four regular regiments and a
portion of the cavalry that the brunt fell. The northern earls,
with their dishonoured levies, fled to Inverness, and Seaforth, in
the wilds of Kintail, had leisure to reflect on the rewards of the
forsworn. Hurry himself, with a remnant of 100 horse, escaped to
Baillie. He was no coward, and was one of the last to quit the
field.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>
<p>Auldearn is the most interesting, as it is tactically the most
brilliant, of Montrose's battles. It was the first time that he had
commanded a reasonable force of cavalry, and the first time that he
had been the attacked instead of the attacker. Hurry had shown
considerable strategic ability, and had attempted with no little
art to meet him with his own methods of surprise. It is rare in the
history of war that a man who can devise lightning
raids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id=
"Page_250">[250]</a></span> shows an equal coolness and skill when
he stands on the defence. But the dispositions made within a few
minutes on that wet May morning could not have been bettered though
they had been the result of days of preparation. Genius for war,
working as it does within certain inexorable limits, repeats with
variations the same methods in every age. The reserving of fire
till close quarters was followed by Dundee at
Killiecrankie,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id=
"FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class=
"fnanchor">[414]</a> and became a famous usage in the British army,
as witness Fontenoy. The device of a weak right, dedicated to a
desperate holding battle, and forming the hinge on which the rest
of the army swings to break the enemy's centre, was used on a
majestic scale amid the snow of Austerlitz.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>The news of Auldearn had its influence on the war in England.
Leven, already aware of the king's plan of coming north to join
Montrose, was summoned by Fairfax to support Brereton at
Manchester, who had been driven out of Cheshire by Charles's
advance from Droitwich. He announced his coming, but added that he
meant to travel by way of Westmoreland, as that route was easiest
for his guns. His reasons for this circuit are plain. He wished his
army to cover the road to Scotland, for he feared that at any
moment the king might come north and Montrose come south, and he
knew that their meeting in the Lowlands would mean the end of his
Covenanting masters. The same fear kept him long in Westmoreland
when he was urgently needed in Yorkshire. He was beginning, like
most of the Scots, to be very weary of his Parliamentary
colleagues, and had already told an English colonel that, if he did
not do his will about a certain fort at Carlisle, he "desired no
better occasion to cut them all in pieces."<a name=
"FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The Estates in
Edinburgh were no less concerned, and their first step was revenge.
Lord Napier, now a man of seventy, whose only <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>offence
was that he was Montrose's brother-in- law, was heavily fined and
kept in close confinement. The young Master had escaped and was
with his uncle; but his wife, his sisters, and his brother-in-law,
Stirling of Keir, shared the old lord's fate. Montrose succeeded in
making an exchange of certain lesser prisoners with Argyll, and he
used the fact that he held a Campbell of Crinan at Blair to prevent
further reprisals upon the Napier family. But Lord Graham was also
imprisoned, and his younger brother, Lord Robert, a boy of seven,
by an order of the Estates, was committed to the charge of
Montrose's wife. It is one of the few glimpses we get of this lady.
Apparently she had made her peace with the Covenant through her own
family, for Southesk and his son Carnegie were of the type that
value property and a quiet life above scruples of honour and a
barren renown.</p>
<p>Montrose had now won four notable battles, but it was still as
difficult <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id=
"Page_252">[252]</a></span>as ever, in Bishop Burnet's phrase, to
"fix his conquests." Hurry's army was gone, but Baillie's remained,
and Baillie blocked the way to the Lowlands. He had 2,000 foot and
several hundred horse, and, burning his way through Atholl, had by
the beginning of May crossed the Dee and entered Strathbogie. As a
reserve to this force, Montrose's college friend, Lord Lindsay of
the Byres, who had been granted by the Parliament the forfeited
earldom of Crawford, was commanding a newly raised army on the
borders of Perth and Angus. Lindsay fancied himself a military
genius, and, having trenchantly criticized the performances of
Argyll and Baillie, had persuaded the Committee to try him in high
command. He seems to have had the ear of Parliament, for on their
order Baillie, as we shall see, was soon compelled to lend him more
than a thousand of his veterans, and accept in exchange 400 of
Lindsay's raw Lowland levies.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id=
"FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class=
"fnanchor">[416]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> May-June</div>
<p>After Auldearn Montrose went first to Elgin, where he halted for
a time to rest his weary troops and look after his wounded. As
usual, many of the Highlanders went home, and Aboyne departed on
sick leave, but he still kept his Irish and the Gordon horse. He
marched into Strathbogie to draw Baillie, and proceeded to
outmanoeuvre him up and down the valley of the Spey. He had no
desire to fight until he had recruited his strength, for after such
a battle as Auldearn there was need of a breathing-space. From
Strathbogie he moved to Balveny and thence to Glenlivat, where
Baillie lost all trace of his quarry. He found him again at
Abernethy-on-Spey, and presently Montrose was on the outskirts of
Badenoch&mdash;"a very strait county," says Baillie, and one by no
means pleasant to campaign in. Here the two opponents halted and
looked at each other. Montrose with his Highlanders could draw
supplies from the countryside, but Baillie could only starve. The
thing was soon past bearing, so the Covenanters withdrew to
Inverness to lay in provisions.</p>

alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">The Campaign of Alford</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The road was now open to deal with Lindsay, who was waiting in
Atholl to prove his boasted generalship. The news of Montrose's
coming sent him back in hot haste to Newtyle, in Angus, to be
nearer his base. Montrose sped down the upper glens of Dee, through
Glen Muick, and down the headwaters of the South Esk. But when he
was on the Isla, within seven miles of Lindsay, and that general
was already repenting his bold words, a message arrived from the
north to spoil all his plans. Huntly had summoned his clan back to
Strathbogie. The reason of his conduct we do not know. The natural
explanation is that the chief of the Gordons took this opportunity
of showing his jealousy of Montrose and of paying back old scores.
So Lord Gordon interpreted it, and was with difficulty restrained
from dealing summarily with those of his clan who proposed to obey
his father's commands. But it is at least as probable that Huntly,
with Baillie in the neighbourhood, was merely anxious <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>for the
safety of his own possessions. Montrose had no other course but to
turn back and begin recruiting again. He might have fought Lindsay
without cavalry and with a much inferior force&mdash;he had taken
risks as great before; but on this occasion there was a strong
reason for retiring. To defeat Lindsay would not advance by one
step the main strategy of his campaign. He would still have to go
back and settle with Baillie, and he would still have to collect an
army for the Lowland war. It seemed wiser to do these necessary
things first, and to leave Lindsay to be dealt with later&mdash;or,
more likely, to fall a victim to the endless Covenanting
bickerings.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> June</div>
<p>Montrose went back the road he had come, by the Spital of
Glenshee, crossed the Dee, and settled himself at Corgarff castle,
at the head of Strathdon. Here he was in a strong position, whether
to retreat, if necessary, to the high hills, or to sweep down upon
the Aberdeenshire lowlands. Once more he sent off Alasdair to
collect the Clan Donald, while Lord Gordon and Nathaniel Gordon
departed to recruit the men of their name. In this way the time
passed till the last days of June. Baillie was thoroughly sick of
the business, and begged in vain to be allowed to resign his
command. Some of his veteran regiments showed ugly symptoms of
mutiny.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id=
"FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class=
"fnanchor">[417]</a> He was in receipt of the daily and most
vexatious instructions of the warlike Committee of Estates, which,
with tried warriors like Argyll, Elcho, and Burleigh among its
members, was resolved to confide nothing to Baillie's unaided
judgment. They were represented at the front by a branch committee,
who interpreted their resolutions, and must have driven the
unfortunate commander to the verge of madness. One of their
performances, as we have seen, was the transfer of the flower of
Baillie's foot, first to Argyll, who refused the command, and then
to Lindsay, who employed them in futile raidings in Atholl.<a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> June-July</div>
<p>In the last days of June, Baillie, having ravaged the Gordon
lands, prepared to lay siege to Huntly's castle of Bog of Gight.
The great keep, well defended by Gordon of Buckie, was in no real
danger, but the position seemed to call for Montrose's
intervention, especially as Lord Gordon had now returned with some
250 troopers. As he advanced he heard of the transfer which Baillie
had been compelled to make to Lindsay, and he may have guessed at
the tyranny of the peripatetic committee. He found the Covenanters
at Keith, on the Deveron, drawn up on high ground, with a gap in
front of them strongly held by horse and commanded by artillery.
The royalists skirmished before the gap, and endeavoured to draw
the enemy, but Baillie was too wise to move. Next morning Montrose
sent him a challenge by a trumpeter, inviting the honour of an
encounter in the levels, but Baillie replied that he was not in the
habit of taking his marching orders from the enemy. Montrose
accordingly broke up his camp and retired southward to Strathdon.
He argued that Baillie might be induced to follow if he saw his
enemy marching away from the Gordon country in the direction of the
Lowlands.</p>
<p>He was right in his guess, for Baillie had heard further news
which cheered his spirit. Alasdair and most of the Irish were
absent from the royal standard. Auldearn had put the fear of Ulster
into the hearts of the Lowland foot, and, as the word sped through
the ranks that the terrible Alasdair had gone, the courage of the
Covenanters rose. With all speed they hastened south after the
enemy, and early on the morning of the 2nd of July came up with him
at Alford on the Don.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> July</div>
<p>Montrose had marched from Deveronside by the ancient Suie Road,
which forded the Don at the village of Forbes, and was continued to
Deeside by a path which, after the "Forty-five," became one of the
specially constructed military highways. It was the straight route
to Angus and the Lowlands, and Baillie believed that his enemy was
in full retreat. South-west of the ford lay the Muir of Alford,
with the kirk and smithy and ale-house which then constituted the
hamlet of that name, two miles west of the present village.<a name=
"FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Directly south of
the ford stood an eminence called the Gallows Hill, sloping gently
towards the north. On this hill Montrose stationed his army,
concealing, as at Auldearn, the greater number behind the crest, so
that to an enemy beyond the river it seemed an inconsiderable
force. It was a strong position, for it was protected on the left
rear by the marshy ravine of the Leochel burn. The upper Don, which
in these days of surface draining is a shallow and easily crossed
stream in the month of July, was then a far more formidable river,
with long stretches of bog along its banks. The only good ford was
the Boat of Forbes, and it was Montrose's intention that Baillie
should cross there. His own position on Gallows Hill was a little
to the south-west, and he calculated that Baillie, believing him to
be weak in numbers, but not caring to face the direct ascent of the
hill, would try to outflank him on the right. If he did, he had
some marshy levels to traverse before he reached the <i>glacis</i>
of Montrose's position, and a defeat would put his army in grave
jeopardy, with a bog and a river behind it.</p>
<p>Baillie walked into the trap. But as soon as he crossed the Don
he observed that his adversary had altered his alignment, and was
now facing not north but north-east, which would prevent the
turning movement he had designed. It is not easy to be certain of
the numbers on both sides. Lindsay's drafts had reduced Baillie to
1,200 foot, but that number must have been increased by levies

"fnanchor">[420]</a> Montrose's infantry after Alasdair's departure
must have fallen well below 2,000, so it is probable that in foot
the two forces were nearly equal. The Gordon cavalry numbered about
250, and Baillie cannot have had less than from 400 to 500. One
advantage Montrose possessed; he had early notice of the enemy's
coming, and was able to make his dispositions at his leisure. They
were very different from Auldearn. The horse were placed on each
wing and strengthened by Irish musketeers. On the right Lord Gordon
commanded, with Nathaniel Gordon in charge of the foot. Aboyne had
the cavalry on the left, with a small Irish contingent under
O'Cahan. The centre, drawn up in files of six deep, was composed of
Badenoch Highlanders, the Farquharsons, and some of Huntly's
lowland tenants, and was under the charge of Drummond of Balloch
and Angus Macdonald of Glengarry. The reserve of foot, concealed
behind the ridge of the Gallows Hill, was commanded by the Master
of Napier.</p>
<p>When Baillie saw Montrose's change of front he halted
irresolutely in the bog. He would probably have declined battle had
he not been overruled by his precious committee, and by Balcarres,
his master of horse, who trusted to the superiority of his cavalry.
The latter was about to charge under the committee's instructions,
when Montrose anticipated him. Baillie had brought along with him
herds of cattle looted from Huntly's lands, and the sight of his
father's beasts penned up in an enclosure behind the Covenanters'
camp infuriated the young Lord Gordon. He swore to drag Baillie by
the throat from the midst of his bodyguard. Accordingly he led his
horse to the charge on the royalist right with the same fury that
at Auldearn had avenged James of Rynie. The Covenant left broke
under the onset, but Balcarres was a stout soldier who did not
easily yield. He managed to rally his three squadrons of horse, and
for a little a fierce and well-matched cavalry battle raged on the
edge of the bog. It would appear that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>during
this struggle the remainder of both armies stood still and
watched.</p>

<p class="caption">The Battle of Alford</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>It was Nathaniel Gordon who turned the tide. He led the foot on
the right wing to the support of the horse, and he conceived a
better way of support than by firing into the mass, where they were
in great danger of wounding their own side. He cried to his men to
fling down their muskets, draw their swords, and stab and hough
Balcarres's horses. The cruel device succeeded. The Covenant
troopers broke and fled, and the Gordons turned their swords, as at
Auldearn, against the unprotected left flank of Baillie's infantry.
Meanwhile Aboyne, with his horse, had at length charged on
Montrose's left, and O'Cahan's Irish followed. The two royalist
wings closed in on the Covenant centre, and against it also
Glengarry led the Gordon foot. The turn of the battle had arrived.
Baillie's veteran regiments, having reduced their files to three to
prevent outflanking, were utterly overborne. It needed only the
advance of the Master of Napier with his reserve to turn the defeat
of the Covenant into a rout. The very camp-boys in the royalist
army mounted the baggage ponies and took their share in the
confusion. Baillie and Balcarres, with their surviving cavalry,
escaped by the skin of their teeth. Argyll, on his third horse,
just evaded Glengarry's sword.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id=

"fnanchor">[422]</a></p>
<p>On the Covenant side the slaughter fell little short of
Auldearn. The royalists, considering how desperate was the cavalry
battle, lost curiously few officers and men, but they sustained one
loss which made the victory little better than a defeat. Lord
Gordon, determined to ave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258"
id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>nge the theft of his father's cattle,
charged the retreating horse once too often. His aim was to capture
Baillie, and he was actually seizing that general by the sword-belt
when he was shot dead from behind&mdash;whether by accident or
design will never be known. His death threw the royalist army, more
especially Montrose and the Gordons, into the uttermost grief. He
had been the young Marcellus of the cause, the one hope of the
North. Aboyne stopped his pursuit of Balcarres, and&mdash;in
Wishart's words&mdash;"forgetting their victory and the spoil, they
fixed their eyes upon the lifeless body, kissed his face and hands,
commended the singular beauty of the corpse, compared the nobility
of his descent and the plentifulness of his fortune with the
hopefulness of his parts, and counted that an unfortunate victory
that had stood them in so much." It was a sorrowful band that, led
by Montrose, took its way slowly to Aberdeen, where the young lord
was laid in the Gordon aisle of the old church of St. Machar. He
was only twenty-eight years of age, and had spent his short span of
life cleanly and chivalrously in the service of his country. To
Montrose the loss was irreparable, for Lord Gordon was the one man
who in temper and attainments was fitted to be his companion.
Patrick of Ruthven, a clansman, has described that noble friendship
in arms:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Never two of so slight acquaintance did ever love more dearly.
There seemed to be a harmonious sympathy in their natural
dispositions, so much were they delighted in a mutual conversation.
And in this the Lord Gordon seemed to go beyond the limits which
Nature had allowed for his carriage in civil conversation. So real
was his affection, and so great the estimation he had of the other
that, when they fell into any familiar discourse, it was often
remarked that the ordinary air of his countenance was changed from
a serious listening to a certain ravishment or admiration of the
other's witty expressions. And he was often heard in public to
speak sincerely, and confirm it with oaths, that if the fortune of
the present war should prove at any time so dismal that Montrose,
for safety, should be forced to fly into the mountains without any
army or any one to assist him, he would live with him as an outlaw,
and would prove as faithful a consort to drive away his malour, as
he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id=

<p>The armies of Baillie and Hurry had ceased to exist. To be sure
there was still Lindsay, but he was hardly to be taken seriously.
The news of Alford, when it reached the south-west of England,
roused the drooping spirits of Charles. "It is certain," Digby
wrote, "that the king's enemies have not any man in the field now
in Scotland."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id=
"FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class=
"fnanchor">[424]</a> Charles had need of heartening, for his cause,
whether he realized it or not, had received its deathblow. Shortly
after Alford, Montrose had news&mdash;perhaps from his friend
Thomas Saintserf, who, disguised as a packman, travelled between
his camp and the Border<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id=
"FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class=
"fnanchor">[425]</a>&mdash;of a cataclysmic disaster in the English
midlands. On the 14th of June, at Naseby, Cromwell's "company of
poor ignorant men"<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id=
"FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class=
"fnanchor">[426]</a> had scattered Rupert's chivalry and
annihilated the royal foot. The battle had two vital consequences
for Scotland. It was Cromwell's first clear personal triumph, and
it enabled him to press on with his policy of religious toleration
which must sooner or later destroy the tyranny of the
Covenant.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id=
"FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class=
"fnanchor">[427]</a> On the other hand, it put an end to the danger
of Charles's advance to the north, and Leven was able to withdraw
his army from Westmoreland and march south in his leisurely way to
the siege of Hereford, very anxious lest the slaughter of the Irish
women after Naseby should be made a precedent by malignants for
reprisals on the immense female concourse which accompanied the
Scots.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href=

<p>The Covenant made one last effort to ride the storm. The plague
had broken out in Edinburgh, so Parliament was compelled to move to
Stirling on the 8th of July. Stirling, however, proved no refuge,
and the seat of government was transferred to Perth.<a name=

"#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Fresh orders were
sent to the nobles and gentry of the Lowlands, and an Act was
passed to levy a new army of 10,000 foot and 500 horse, a
considerable part of which was appointed to assemble at Perth on
the 24th of July. Baillie had brought back no infantry from his
last campaign, but he had saved a respectable cavalry contingent,
probably at least 400 strong. He had returned in a sullen temper,
and had resigned his office; but Parliament passed a vote of thanks
to him for his services, and insisted on his taking command of the
new levies. For his comfort it appointed the usual committee "to
advise," a phrase which, as Baillie well knew, meant to dictate.
Among the sixteen members were Argyll, Tullibardine, and
Burleigh&mdash;experts in their way, for all had already suffered
at Montrose's hands.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id=

<p>Alford was fought on the royalist side lacking Alasdair and most
of his Irish, the western clans, and the Atholl men. For the final
assault on the Lowlands it was necessary to collect all available
forces. This meant some weeks of waiting at the shortest, and
Aboyne was dispatched to Strathbogie to enlist troopers. He made
little speed, either because the Gordons were disinclined to fight
south of the Highland Line, or because he was a poor recruiting
sergeant, and Montrose had to send him back to try again. Aboyne is
a difficult figure to decipher on the page of history. He was
devoutly loyal to the king's service; his gallantry was beyond
question; but he had much of the intractable and suspicious temper
of his brother Lewis and his father Huntly. The fine flower of the
Gordon race had gone with the young lord. Montrose waited for a few
days at Craigton,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id=
"FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class=
"fnanchor">[431]</a> on the south side of the Hill of Fare (where
is a spot still called Montrose's Trench), till the news of the
muster and the session at Perth decided him to go south. It was a
sovran chance to strike at the heart of the opposition.</p>

<br>
<p>He forded Dee, and marched through the hills to Fordoun in the
Mearns, where he waited to receive his expected allies. They
arrived in good force. Alasdair brought the rest of his Irish, and
a body of Highlanders some 1,500 strong. Among them came the
ever-faithful Macdonalds of Clanranald and Glengarry, and not less
than 700 Macleans from Mull, under their chiefs Lachlan of Duart
and Murdoch of Lochbuie. This warrior clan as a fighting force was
second only to the Ulstermen.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id=
"FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class=
"fnanchor">[432]</a> There were Macphersons from Badenoch, Camerons
from Lochaber, Stewarts from Appin, Farquharsons from Braemar, and
Macnabs and Macgregors from the southern Highlands. Young
Inchbrakie arrived later with a contingent o<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>f the
Atholl men. Save for his lack of cavalry, Montrose had now the
strongest force he had yet commanded. He marched by his old route
down the Isla to Dunkeld, to watch the movements of the Covenanters
in Perth, and to wait for Aboyne and the Gordons.</p>
<p>Parliament met on the 24th of July under the guard of a large
body of infantry and 400 horse. If Montrose was to upset their
peace of mind and have leisure for his own business, it was
necessary to make a show of cavalry to keep the 400 at home.
Accordingly he mounted some of his foot on baggage horses, and as
the Perth citizens cast their eyes to the north they were amazed to
see a cloud of royalist cavalry on the horizon. It was sufficient
to make them shut their gates and keep close within their walls.
For a few days, from their camp at Methven eight miles off, the
royalists held the ancient city in terror. At any moment the
assault might come, and Parliament debated with the fear of sudden
death in each debater's heart.</p>
<p>But the bluff could not be long sustained. Presently it was
discovered that the cavalry were a sham, being no more than eighty
troopers and some amateurs on pack-horses. The courage of the
Covenant horse revived, and a sally was ordered. Montrose had no
wish to fight a battle till the time was ripe, so he fell back on
his camp at Methven. But Methven was too near the plains to be any
permanent refuge, and as the Covenanters advanced he was compelled
to retire, till he had reached the skirts of the hills. The
Covenant horse harried his rear, but his Highland sharpshooters lay
in wait for them, and, stalking them through the undergrowth,
emptied a saddle with every shot. The retreat, however, had been
too hurried to be without disaster. Some of the Irish women among
Alasdair's camp-followers had straggled too far behind in Methven
wood, and were seized and butchered by the Covenanters.<a name=

"#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> "As at Naseby," says
Mr. Gardiner, "the notion of avenging injured morality probably

their act."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id=

painted madams of the court, but the womenfolk of humble soldiers,
who followed their fathers, husbands, and lovers for the same
motive that had attracted Scotswomen in hundreds to the tail of
Leven's army in England.</p>
<p>For a week Montrose waited at Dunkeld till Aboyne arrived with
200 Gordon cavalry and 120 musketeers mounted on baggage ponies.
These latter were the equivalent of the dragoons of the New Model
Army, and acted both as light cavalry and as mounted
infantry.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id=
"FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class=
"fnanchor">[435]</a> Not the least welcome was old Lord Airlie, now
recovered from his sickness, who rode in with 80 of his Ogilvys,
including his son, Sir David Ogilvy of Baldovie, and young
Alexander of Inverquharity. Montrose now commanded a force of at
least 4,400 foot and 500 cavalry,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id=
"FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class=
"fnanchor">[436]</a> a seasoned force, for all were tough fighting
men, and the thousand Irish were probably the best infantry at the
time in Britain. Most of the troops had, under his leadership, been
present at more than one victory, and all had wrongs to avenge on
some section or another of the Covenanters. It was the first time,
with the exception of Alford, that he had commanded an army
comparable in the strength of all arms to its opponents.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> August</div>
<p>Meanwhile Baillie at Perth was in a sombre and distrustful mood.
He thought little of his new levies, and he was distracted by his
committee of advice. He considered that he could have cut off
Montrose from the hills in his sally from Perth but for the
negligence of Hurry and his cavalry. Once again he resigned, and
once again he was induced to withdraw his resignation. Montrose
m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id=
"Page_265">[265]</a></span>arched by way of Logiealmond to have a
look at the enemy, and the Covenanters promptly retired to their
fortified camp of Kilgraston on the Earn. As Montrose followed at
his leisure by way of the field of Tippermuir, he had news which
determined his strategy. The Covenant was making a desperate bid
for success. Cassilis, nicknamed the "Solemn," a zealot of the old
rock; Eglinton, called "Grey Steel," one of the chief promoters of
the Solemn League; Glencairn, the eternal Laodicean whose actions
no man could forecast&mdash;were raising the Covenanting westlands.
Lanark had collected the Hamilton tenantry, and with 1,000 foot and
500 horse was hastening from Clydesdale. Baillie's army was already
superior in numbers to his own, and Montrose did not wish the odds
to be too great, for he realized as well as did the Covenant that
on the coming fight must depend the future of the king's cause in
Scotland. He resolved, therefore, to fling himself between Baillie
and Lanark. Baillie was lying at Kilgraston waiting on the Fife
regiments. If he fought him now, he would still have the men of
Fife to deal with, not to speak of Lanark. If he cut off the Fife
men, he would still have Baillie, and during these manoeuvres
Lanark would have arrived. The wiser plan was to let Baillie get
his Fife recruits, and then cut him off from the west. Besides, the
farther he could draw the Fife levies from their own country, the
less stomach would those home-keeping souls have for
fighting.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id=
"FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class=
"fnanchor">[437]</a> Lanark he knew of old, and he may well have
argued that, if he routed Baillie, he could have little to fear
from the Hamiltons.</p>
<p>On or about the 10th of August Montrose, having crossed the Earn
between Dupplin and Forteviot, swept down Glenfarg to the
neighbourhood of Kinross. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266"
id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>Baillie must have guessed that he had
gone to cut off the Fife recruits, but the arrival of these levies
presently in his camp convinced him that this was not Montrose's
aim. Then came the news that the grim tower of Castle Campbell,
above Dollar, an Argyll possession, had been sacked and
burned.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id=
"FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class=
"fnanchor">[438]</a> While the Covenanters lay at the north-east
end of the Ochils, Montrose was turning the southern flank. He
could only have one object&mdash;to get to the west of Baillie and
frustrate his junction with Lanark. Further tidings of him came
from the lands of Lord Mar, who was the father-in-law of the Master
of Napier. In so large a force Montrose could not exercise the
personal supervision which is possible in a small army, and the
Irish seem to have got out of hand, for they plundered the little
town of Alloa and some of the Mar holdings. Mar, however, bore no
grudge, for, while Alasdair led on the foot in advance, he invited
Montrose and his staff to dine with him at Alloa House.</p>
<p>By this time Baillie had made up his mind. As Montrose was at
dinner he received the intelligence that the Covenanters were
marching with all speed along the north side of the Ochils to cut
him off. It was vital to his strategy that he should keep ahead of
them, so, hastily catching up his foot, he led his army that night
across the Forth by the Fords of Frew, a few miles above Stirling.
Next day he continued his march in the direction of Glasgow,
passing over the field of Bannockburn, and by the evening of the
14th of August was encamped in an upland meadow on the Colzium
burn, one of the affluents of the river Kelvin, about a mile
north-east of the town of Kilsyth. He argued that it was now
Baillie's business to find him and fight him, for the Covenanters
must pass beneath him before they could join Lanark, who was
marching from Glasgow.</p>
<p>Baillie, making the best possible speed past Dunblane and down
the Allan Water, was compelled by Argyll to waste time in burning
Lord <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id=
"Page_267">[267]</a></span>Stirling's castle of Menstrie, and the
Graham house of Airth.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id=
"FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class=
"fnanchor">[439]</a> He found, as he expected, that the presence of
the committee made discipline almost impossible. That band of
heroes was now enlarged, and included Argyll, Lindsay, Burleigh,
Tullibardine, Balcarres, and Elcho; Montrose had beaten them all
except Lindsay, whom as yet he had only scared. The Fife levies,
too, grew more out of humour and spirit with every mile that
increased the distance from their homes. On the evening of the 14th
he was encamped at Hollinbush, on the road from Stirling, only two
and a half miles from where Montrose lay. His scouts&mdash;for he
was in a friendly country&mdash;had kept him well informed of the
enemy's whereabouts, and a great dispute arose in the committee.
Baillie, realizing the gravity of the coming engagement, was for
taking no risks, and waiting till Lanark, now only twelve miles
distant, brought up his reinforcements. But Argyll and his
colleagues would brook no delay. They had 6,000 foot and 800 horse.
They were in the Lowlands at last; Lanark, at the latest, would be
with them in a few hours; Montrose had the Forth behind him to cut
off his retreat to the Highlands; he lay in a hollow, and had left
the higher ground unoccupied. Let them strike home at once, and
Lanark, when he arrived, would help to take order with the
fugitives.</p>
<p>It had been a hot summer, the weather that breeds pestilence,
and the bent on the hills was as yellow as grain. The dawn of the
15th was windless and cloudless, giving promise of a scorching
August day. With the first light the Covenanters were on the move.
They left the road and made straight across country in the
direction of Montrose's camp, wading through fields of ripening
bear and oats, and scrambling up the slopes of the Campsie Hills.
Soon they reached the rim of the basin where the royalists lay, and
Baillie, believing his men to be tired by the rough journey, would
have preferred to halt in wh<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>at seemed an impregnable
position. He held the high ground, and below him the hill fell
steeply to the little burn, beyond which lay Montrose. But the
military genius of the committee conceived a plan. A quarter of a
mile to the right the glen closed in, and the burn descended
through a narrow ravine. They believed that Montrose was doomed to
defeat, and their only fear was lest he should escape to the north,
for there was still a way open to the Highlands through Menteith.
If they could outflank him and take up a position on the ridge due
north from his left, he would be pinned inexorably between them and
the Lowlands.</p>
<p>As Montrose watched the enemy's doings he was content with the
ground he had chosen. He had left the higher ridge unoccupied as a
bait to draw his opponents into action. He did not believe that
Baillie would charge down the steep; if he did, the use of horse on
such ground was impossible, and he could guess the condition in
which the heavily accoutred Lowland infantry would arrive at the
bottom. He believed that the Covenanters would simply wait for
Lanark, and he had made up his mind to charge their position, since
the slopes of the Campsies were nothing to men who knew Glencoe and
the Rough Bounds. He asked his army whether they were for retreat
or fight, and the fierce cry for battle assured him of their
spirit. Foreseeing the heat of the day, he bade his Highlanders
cast their plaids and fight in their coarse saffron shirts,
knotting up the long tails of the latter between their legs to give
them freedom of action.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id=
"FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class=
"fnanchor">[440]</a> His horse he ordered to wear their shirts
above their buff jerkins in order that they might be easily
distinguishable from the enemy. It was a necessary precaution in an
army of many different levies, where the separate parts were
scarcely known to each other. Alasdair's men in the heat of battle
must have some clear mark to distinguish friend from foe, or
regrettable incidents might occur. Near the head of the glen, and
on the hill where the Covenanters stood, were several
cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id=
"Page_269">[269]</a></span>s and little gardens walled with
dry-stone dykes.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id=
"FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class=
"fnanchor">[441]</a> It was a sort of Hougoumont, a place which any
prudent commander must seize, so he ordered its occupation by an
advance guard of Alasdair's centre, which happened to be a body of
a hundred Macleans, under Ewen of Treshnish.</p>
<p>But as Montrose watched the crest of the hill he observed the
Covenanters in motion. He could scarcely believe his eyes when he
perceived that they were about to attempt a flank march across his
front. It is never a safe or an easy manoeuvre, more especially
when the foe is almost within musket shot, and in mobility and
speed is the superior of the side attempting it. Baillie bitterly
protested, and he was supported by Balcarres, but the committee
would have their way, and for the rest of the day he was carrying
out orders not his own. To reach the hill directly above Montrose's
left it was necessary to make the circuit of the glen and cross the
ravine of the burn. The movement was led by Balcarres and the
horse, and Baillie, accompanied by Lindsay and Burleigh, followed
close behind with the foot. His three field-pieces, which might
have been of incalculable value in covering the movement, were
apparently forgotten.</p>
<p>On one condition alone might such a course have succeeded. If
the Covenanters had kept behind the ridge in their march, leaving a
small force to occupy their old position on the crest of the hill,
they might have safely reached their goal; and once there, with a
gradual slope before them on which horse could be used, they would
have seriously embarrassed Montrose. But such tactics needed a
speed and a precision which the Covenanters did not possess. Almost
at once they were visible to the royalists below, owing to a grave
breach of discipline. A certain Major Haldane, observing the
cottages which Treshnish had occupied, decided, on his own
authority, that he must attack the position. Accordingly, with a
handful of musketeers, he broke off from the main march and started
down the hill. He was soon driven bac<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>k, but it was never the
Highland way to repel without a counterstroke. Alasdair launched
the whole body of Macleans against the assailants, and they were at
once followed by their old rivals, the Macdonalds of Clanranald,
who vied with them in the race for the ridge. Young Donald of
Moidart won, but Lachlan of Duart was little behind. On surged the
billow of Celtic war till it struck the Covenant line in the
middle. Colonel Hume, who commanded there, drew four foot
regiments&mdash;his own, Argyll's, Cassilis', and
Glencairn's&mdash;behind some dykes on the hill-top, and attempted
a stand. But the Highlanders leapt the walls with their targes high
and their heads down, and in a few minutes the Covenant centre was
in flight. Alasdair's breach of orders had succeeded beyond its
deserts, and Baillie's army was cut in two.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>Meanwhile the Covenant van had crossed the burn and rounded the
head of the glen. Montrose, who at first can only have guessed at
the aim of the flank movement, now saw clearly its motive. It was
impossible to let the enemy occupy the height on his left, so he
dispatched a body of Gordon foot, under their adjutant, to
forestall them. The bulk of Balcarres's horse must have been still
behind the ridge, for if Montrose had seen their full force he
would have attempted to hold the hill in greater strength. The
Gordons found the task beyond their power. They were driven back,
and to the eyes of Aboyne&mdash;whom Montrose, remembering Lord
Gordon's fate at Alford, had kept at the rear with a strong
bodyguard&mdash;seemed to be caught in a death-trap. He broke away
with the Gordon horse to the assistance of his kinsmen.<a name=
"FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> But he, too, was
surrounded, so Montrose called upon Airlie and his Ogilvys to
redeem the day. The gallant old man, for all his sixty years, led
his troopers to the charge, and the tide of battle on the hill
began to turn. Then Montrose dispatched Nathaniel Gordon with the
remainder of the cavalry, seeing that Alasdair was having his own
wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id=
"Page_271">[271]</a></span>y in the rest of the field. Balcarres's
cuirassiers were driven off the ridge, the advance foot were
routed, and the Covenant van shared the fate of the Covenant
centre.</p>
<p>Baillie was soon aware that the day was lost. Haldane's escapade
brought him racing back from Balcarres's side, but the mischief had
been done. He endeavoured in vain to rally the foot at the ravine
of the burn, and then in despair galloped to the rear for the Fife
reserves. But the men of Fife had early despaired of the issue, and
were in full flight for their homes. About the same time Montrose's
trumpets sounded the general advance. The whole royalist army swept
up the hill, but no foe awaited them on the crest. The semicircle
of the little amphitheatre was empty, and the outside rim was
strewn with fleeing horse and foot. Of the 6,000 men who had set
out that morning to fight under the Covenant's banner only a few
hundreds escaped. The murder of their women in Methven wood had not
disposed Ulsterman or Highlander to a mercy which they knew would
never be extended to themselves. Many of the horse, too, perished,
caught in the mires of Dullatur. The leaders escaped, as commonly
happened in the Covenant's battles. The lairds and nobles had
better horses, and they had no scruple of honour in saving their
own necks and leaving the plain folk, who had trusted them, to die
on the field. Well for themselves that the western Covenanters were
too late for the fight and had ample time to escape. Lanark fled to
Berwick, Glencairn and Cassilis to Ireland. Baillie and Holbourn
sought sanctuary in Stirling castle, where they were joined by
Balcarres, Burleigh, and Tullibardine. Loudoun and Lindsay posted
to England. Argyll galloped twenty miles to Queensferry on the
Forth, where he found a boat which landed him in Berwick in the
safe keeping of the Scots garrison. As at Inveraray and at
Inverlochy, he escaped by water from Montrose's swords.<a name=

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id=
"Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>The decisive battle had at last been fought. So far as Scotland
was concerned, the forces of the Covenant were annihilated, and its
leaders were in exile. Scarcely a year had passed since that August
evening when, with two companions, Montrose had alighted at the
door of Tullibelton&mdash;without men, money, or prospects, and
with no resources for his wild mission save the gallantry of his
heart. Since then he had scourged the Covenant from Lorn to Buchan,
and from Lochaber to Angus. With halting allies and few troops,
with poor weapons and scanty ammunition, amid broken promises and
private sorrows and endless disappointments, he had sought out his
enemies and had beaten them wherever he found them. He had excelled
them in strategy and in tactics, in cavalry and in infantry
movements, in the offensive and the defensive. He had shown himself
able to adapt his slender resources to any emergency, and to rise
superior to any misfortune. His reward had come. For the moment he
was the undisputed master of all Scotland.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> August</div>
<p>"I profess to you," wrote Digby to Jermyn on the 21st of
September, a month after Kilsyth, "I never did look upon our
business with that assurance that I do now, of God's carrying us
through with His own immediate hand, for all this work of Montrose
is above what can be attributed to mankind."<a name=
"FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> To Charles, uneasily
moving about the Welsh marches, the star that had arisen in the
north seemed to herald a better dawn. Even at that late hour it is
clear that, if there had been any other royalist leader with a
tithe of Montrose's genius, the king's crown need not have fallen.
But from England he received only empty praise. What had become of
Sir Philip Musgrave's 500 horse, what of the 1,500 men whom Digby
had promised? Montrose had been true to his word; he had scattered
the Covenant in Scotland, and deprived Leven and Leslie of a base.
But to "fix his conquests" was beyond the power of mortal man
unless help came from the south. He himself thought otherwise. He
hoped still to lead a great army across the Border, and redress the
sinking balance in Charles's favour. He had no fear of his
antagonists; "though God should rain Leslies from Heaven, he would
fight them."<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id=
"FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class=
"fnanchor">[445]</a> But his courage outran the possibilities.
Scotland was subdued, not converted, and, unless the king came
north as a conqueror, Montrose would have to wrestle daily and
desperately to hol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id=
"Page_274">[274]</a></span>d her to her unwilling allegiance. Never
in history have Highlands dominated Lowlands for long.</p>
<p>But at first the prospect had a delusive brightness. After
waiting two days at Kilsyth, during which he sent a message of
assurance to the city of Glasgow, the victorious general entered
the capital of the west. Here, seven years before, had been held
the General Assembly at which episcopacy in Scotland had been
abolished, and Montrose, in his Presbyterian zeal, had shown
himself the foremost in the baiting of Hamilton. The place had
never evinced the fanatic virulence of Edinburgh. Pride in their
great church, happily saved from the iconoclasts, had kept its
citizens on the side of decency and temperance in religious
affairs. A deputation from the town council met the king's
lieutenant outside the walls, offering the value of &pound;500 in English
money as a largesse to the soldiers, and praying that the city
might be left unmolested. To this request Montrose readily agreed.
He issued stringent orders against theft and violence, and his
entry was welcomed with a popular enthusiasm hardly to be looked
for in the Lowlands. Zachary Boyd, that erratic singer of Israel,
wrote Latin verses in his honour. Unfortunately the sight of the
well-stocked booths and the prosperous dwellings of the Saltmarket
and the Gallowgate was too much for some of his followers, who had
not believed that so much wealth existed in the world, and could
not readily forget their Highland creed that spoil should follow
victory. Looting began, and Montrose, true to his word, promptly
hanged several of the malefactors. But he saw that Glasgow would
prove too severe a trial to his army, so two days after his
arrival, about the 20th of August, he marched six miles up the
river to Bothwell.</p>
<p>Here he took measures for the government of Scotland, which the
fortunes of war had entrusted to his hands. The first b<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>usiness
was to stamp out the embers of disaffection. Some of Eglinton's
levies were still threatening in the west, and Alasdair was
dispatched to bring them to reason. He met with no opposition, and
to his surprise was welcomed cordially at Loudoun castle by the
wife of the Covenanting chancellor. The shires and burghs of
Renfrew and Ayr sent in their submission and petitioned for
favour.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id=
"FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class=
"fnanchor">[446]</a> Other towns and counties followed suit, and
presently arrived the nobles and gentry to greet the rising sun.
The midlands of Scotland were naturally foremost. Loyalists like
Seton<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> and Fleming and
Erskine, cautious men like Linlithgow and Carnegie and Maderty,
declared opponents like Drummond, who had commanded the Covenant
horse at Tippermuir, hastened to Bothwell. More important were the
recruits from the south, the nobles whom Montrose had solicited in
vain at Dumfries the year before. Annandale and Hartfell swore
allegiance, as did powerful lairds like Charteris of Amisfield, and
those Border earls, Roxburgh and Home, who for the past four years
had coquetted with both king and Covenant. Traquair, another
waverer, sent his son, Lord Linton, with the promise of a troop of
horse. Carnwath's brother, Sir John Dalziel, brought the wildest
blood in the Lowlands to the standard. And to crown all came the
Marquis of Douglas, who, as Lord Angus, had been the travelling
companion of Montrose's youth. The prestige of the Bloody Heart had
not wholly died even in an age which had tried to bolt the door on
the past, and the vast Douglas lands in Clydesdale and Dumfries
promised a rich recruiting ground.</p>
<p>There were other allies to be gathered. At the earliest
opportunity the Master of Napier and Nathaniel Gordon were
dispatched Edinburghwards on a gaol delivery. From the prison of
Linlithgow they released Lord Napier and Stirling of Keir, and the
ladies of the Napier and Stirling families. Arrived within four
miles of Edinburgh, they summoned the city in the king's name, and
received the humble submission of a deputation from the town
council. A money fine was offered, and it was explained<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> that
the city had been driven into rebellion against its will by the
craft of a few seditious men. The plague, which was still raging,
had sapped all civic valour, and Edinburgh was ready to promise
anything for peace. The Tolbooth was full of royalists, and during
the year death and sickness had raged in that noisome place.
Crawford, Ogilvy, Reay, Irvine of Drum, Ogilvy of Powrie, and
Wishart the chaplain were among those set free, and the released
captives, white and gaunt as a bone, stumbled out into the
sunlight. Wishart never forgot the experience. It made him, as he
said, "a friend of prisoners for ever"; in later years he could not
enjoy a good meal at his episcopal table till he had sent part of
it to the Tolbooth; and he bore the marks of the rats' teeth to his
grave. One captive they did not recover. The young Lord Graham was
in the castle, and the castle was still in Covenant hands. The
gallant boy refused an exchange, declaring that it would ill become
one so young and useless to deprive his father of a single
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id=
"FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class=
"fnanchor">[448]</a></p>
<p>Napier and Gordon had another mission to execute in the east.
They carried a letter from Montrose to Drummond of Hawthornden,
begging for a copy of his <i>Irene</i>, the pamphlet written in
1638 during Montrose's Covenanting days, that it might be printed
and published "to the contentment of all His Majesty's good
subjects."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id=
"FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class=
"fnanchor">[449]</a> He had already granted him a special
protection for his house and property. The old poet promised to
transcribe and send the paper, "since, by the mercy of God on your
Excellency's victorious arms, the Golden Age is returned"; but
before it arrived Scotland was back in the age of iron.<a name=

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id=

<p>By the 1st of September Napier and Gordon, with their released
prisoners, were in the camp at Bothwell. On that day Sir Robert
Spottiswoode, the king's secretary for Scotland, arrived with
letters from Charles. He brought with him a patent, dated at
Hereford on the 25th of June, creating Montrose lieutenant-governor
and captain-general of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id=
"FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class=
"fnanchor">[451]</a> The royal instructions were to join the Border
earls and march with all haste to Tweed. As these had been issued
before Alford and Kilsyth, they seemed to Montrose to have
redoubled force, now that he was master of all Scotland. Besides,
Home and Roxburgh had written pleading with him to come to
Tweedside and add their spears to his standard. Every prospect
seemed rosy, and Montrose dispatched a post to the king, announcing
that he hoped speedily to cross the Border with 20,000 men. On the
3rd of September he held a great review of his troops in Bothwell
haugh, when the royal commission was presented to the viceroy and
handed for proclamation to Sir Archibald Primrose, the founder of
the family of Rosebery. Montrose's first act under his new patent
was to confer upon Alasdair the honour of knighthood. He had nobly
earned it. The next four months of blundering in Argyll were to
show how little of a general the Ulsterman was on his own account.
Two years later he was to disappear from history, stabbed in the
back in an obscure Irish fray. But as Montrose's chief brigadier he
was worth an army, and his stand at Auldearn will live as long as
feats of valour can stir the hearts of men.</p>
<p>As soon as the king's commission was received, Montrose, as
viceroy of Scotland, took steps for the administration of the
government. He had already in the king's name assured loyalists in
the possession of lands which Argyll or the Estates had
threatened.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id=
"FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class=
"fnanchor">[452]</a> He now issued proclamation to the chief towns,
summoning a Parliament to be held in Glasgow on the 20th of October
following, "for settling religion and peace, and freeing the
oppressed subjects of those insupportable burdens they have groaned
under this time bygone." He prepared also a statement which he
probably intended to present to Parliament when it
assembled.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id=
"FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class=
"fnanchor">[453]</a> It is on t<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>he lines of his Dumfries
manifesto, but a fuller and clearer confession of faith. He repeats
the justification of the National Covenant&mdash;the evils of an
unnatural and enforced prelacy, under which ecclesiastics
intermeddled with civil government, and "the life of the Gospel was
stolen away by enforcing on the Kirk a dead service book." To every
line of that Covenant he still adhered, but long ago its mission
was accomplished. First at Berwick and then at Ripon the king had
granted all their demands. Further no true Covenanter could go, for
the cause of the Covenant was also the cause of king and country.
All that had been done since had been alien to the true Covenant
spirit, and every honest man must needs part company with its
perverters. "We were constrained to suffer them to deviate without
us, with the multitude misled by them, whose eyes they seal in what
concerns religion, and whose hearts they steal away in what
concerns loyalty." He expounds his own
difficulties&mdash;"wrestling betwixt extremities"&mdash;till facts
decided for him. The nobles had tasted the "sweetness of
government," and they would not be content till they had destroyed
"lawful authority and the liberty of the subject." The Kirk had
coerced men into a blind obedience, a tyranny worse than papacy. He
took up arms, he says, first, for national religion, "the
restoration of that which our first reformers had"; second, for the
maintenance of the central authority, the king's; and, third, for
the "vindication of our nation from the base servitude of subjects
who, like the Israelites, have their burdens doubled, but are not
sensible of them." He answers his critics, especially those
timorous souls who are "so stuffed with infidelity that they can
believe nothing but what they see, and can commit nothing to God."
If he had used the services of Alasdair Macdonald, a "professed
Papist," had not his opponents employed in Ireland, under Monro,
the selfsame people? He repudiated the charge of blood-guiltiness.
He had never "shed the bloo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279"
id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>d of any but of such as were sent
forth by them to shed our blood and take our lives," adding with a
touch of the Covenanters' own idiom, "and what is done in the land
it may sensibly seem to be the Lord's doing, in making a handful to
overthrow multitudes." Freedom and toleration in religion, a strong
central government, and a lighter taxation for the burdened people
of Scotland&mdash;for these he had drawn the sword.</p>
<p>It was the appeal to his countrymen on which he hoped to build a
civil authority to correspond to that which he had won in war. As
an ideal of statescraft it was profound; as tactics, as a step in
the political game, it was bound to fail. The appeal was
unintelligible to all save a few, and the defence did not convince.
The people of the Lowlands had lost friends and kinsmen in the
Highland wars, their ears had been horrified with endless tales of
pillage and violence, and at the back of every Lowland heart lay a
jealousy and dislike of the Celt, whether Ulster or Scottish, as of
a race they did not understand. To say that Monro had used similar
troops in Ireland was no more convincing to most people than to
urge that the clans had once fought bravely at Bannockburn for
Scottish independence. To point to Argyll's barbarities in the
Highlands as worse than any of Alasdair's doings was to miss the
point of the grievance. To a Lowlander the victims in the first
case were savages and aliens, and in the latter they were "kindly
Scots." As for the king, there was still some loyal sentiment for
him in Scotland, a clannish feeling, for had she not given to
England the royal house? But the feeling was only sentimental,
while Montrose's royalism was a reasoned appeal for a central
authority, whatever name it might be given&mdash;an appeal which
nobody, except perhaps Napier, understood. As for the Kirk, no
doubt its encroachments were becoming a burden, but it had the
terrible mastery over its people which is given by the possession
of the keys of heaven and hell. Before that tyranny could be broken
there were to be long years of struggle and much shedding of
innocent blood. Besides, the Lowlands had no other voice or ear
than the ministers. They wer<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>e the sole interpreters,
teachers, and guides. No mere proclamation could break through that
plate-armour of defence to the starved and puzzled souls behind it.
The one argument of practical value was the promise to reduce the
grievous weight of taxation. But a Lowland burgher or peasant might
well have been pardoned for doubting whether Montrose, with an army
of hungry kerns to keep, would prove an easier tax-collector. The
remonstrance, while of the highest value as a clue to Montrose's
philosophy, shows that he wholly misread the immediate political
situation. He could look for recruits only to those who were tired
of the domineering Kirk and jealous of the Covenant leaders. Such
were to be found among the nobles and gentry alone,<a name=
"FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and these, and the
tenantry they could command, were all that appeared in his camp at
Bothwell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile that army which had fought under him in so many
battles was beginning to melt away. The Highlanders wanted to get
back to their homes. It was their duty, for the families left
behind had rarely food for more than a week or two, and would
starve if the husbands and fathers did not return often to
replenish the pot. Miserably poor, war was a business to them, and
they had to deposit their winnings. They had stayed on after
Kilsyth, in the hope of the plunder of Glasgow, but Glasgow was
inviolate, and one or two of them, who had tried to use the rich
town as they considered it should be used, were now swinging from
Glasgow gibbets for their pains. Further, the &pound;500 which the
citizens had offered was not to be paid. The town council, fearing
lest the meeting of Parliament would cost the city large sums, had
begged to be let off the contribution, and Montrose had consented.
The clans were disgusted, and began to trickle away. There were
other reasons. The Macleans must look after their homes in
M<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id=
"Page_281">[281]</a></span>ull, or the Campbells would be avenging
Kilsyth. Clan Donald had still grudges to avenge on Clan Diarmaid,
which not even Inverlochy had satisfied. There is no reason to
blame the Highlanders unduly. Organized Lowland warfare, such as
Montrose now proposed, was a thing which they did not understand,
and which upset the whole system and tradition of their lives.
Alasdair alone deserves censure. He was an experienced soldier, and
knew something of the difficulties that lay before his chief. But
his knighthood and his new post of captain-general of the clans
under Montrose seem to have turned his head. He proposed to himself
a campaign in Argyll which should root the Campbells out of the
peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id=
"FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class=
"fnanchor">[455]</a> He promised to return, and no doubt honestly
meant it, but from the moment when he marched off with half his
Irishry and all the Highlanders, Montrose never saw his old
lieutenant again. Five hundred Ulstermen, under the gallant
O'Cahan, refused, to their eternal honour, to leave the royal
standard.</p>
<p>Douglas and Ogilvy had been already dispatched to the Border to
recruit, and on the 4th of September Montrose broke up his camp at
Bothwell and began his advance towards Tweed. His plan was to march
through the Lothians, and then descend by one of the passes of the
Lammermoors to the country of Home and Roxburgh. But at the end of
the first day he had to face a defection more serious than
Alasdair's. Aboyne had been rapidly getting out of humour, and his
ill-temper was zealously fomented by Huntly, his father. He was
insulted because Crawford, instead of himself, had been given the
command of the cavalry. The return of Lord Ogilvy had restored to
Montrose his oldest comrade, and to the Gordon it seemed that an
Ogilvy was preferred before him. A narrative of the campaign by Sir
William Rollo, which he had seen, was, in his view, insufficiently
laudatory of his own doings, and Montrose refused to suppress it.
Last and most important there was old Huntly, whose every letter
upbraided his heir for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282"
id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>lliance with an enemy of his house.
The untamable perverseness of the Gordon blood triumphed over his
loyalty to his king and his duty to his general. In spite of
Ogilvy's appeals he marched off with all the Gordon horse and foot.
Nathaniel Gordon alone remained; for him the comradeship in arms
begun after Tippermuir was to end only with death.</p>

<br>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Montrose traversed the moorland country of the Lothians,
avoiding plague-stricken Edinburgh, to Cranstoun, south-east of
Dalkeith. It was now Saturday, the 6th of September, and on the
following day it was intended that Wishart should preach to the
army. But news was received from Lord Erskine which changed the
situation. David Leslie,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id=
"FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class=
"fnanchor">[456]</a> the future Lord Newark, and a soldier far
abler than either Leven or Baillie, had, after the fall of
Carlisle, taken his horse to the assistance of Leven at Hereford.
He was then sent into the midlands in pursuit of the king, but the
news of Kilsyth altered his plans. His men refused to continue the
war in England while Scotland was defenceless, and, though his
first intention was to take only half his force, he was soon
compelled to take the whole 4,000. On 1st September the siege of
Hereford was raised&mdash;it was the one direct result of Kilsyth
in the king's favour&mdash;while Leslie was hastening with all
speed to the north. Had the king's army been better handled he
would never have reached the Border. There was one moment at
Rotherham, as he himself admitted, when, if the adjacent royal
forces had struck, he would have been destroyed.<a name=
"FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href=

unchallenged, and, collecting reinforcements of foot from the
garrisons of Newcastle and Berwick, he crossed Tweed on the 6th of
September. John Middleton of Caldhame commanded his advance guard;
he had served <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id=
"Page_283">[283]</a></span>under Montrose at Aberdeen in the
Bishops' War, and was to live to receive an earldom and misgovern
Scotland after the Restoration. Leslie followed the coast road to
the Lothians, his aim being to cut off Montrose from the Highlands,
and his plan to take up position somewhere on the neck of land
between Forth and Clyde.</p>

<p>He had under him not less than 6,000 men. Of these more than
5,000 were mounted troops&mdash;his own regiment, the regiments of
Dalhousie, Eglinton, Middleton, and Leven, Fraser's
Dragoons,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id=
"FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class=

Barclay's independent troop of horse. He had picked up 800 foot on
the way from the regiments of Clydesdale, Tweeddale, Galloway,
Montgomery, Strathearn, and Kenmure.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id=
"FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class=
"fnanchor">[459]</a> He had also acquired at Berwick a more
doubtful increment, no less than ten members of the Committee of
Estates, most of them fugitives after Kilsyth, like Argyll,
Lindsay, and Lanark.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id=
"FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class=
"fnanchor">[460]</a> But he did not suffer the committee to
interfere with the conduct of his operations as it had done at
Kilsyth and was to do later at Dunbar. The crisis was too sharp for
a peripatetic debating society.</p>
<p>Lord Erskine advised a retreat beyond the Highland Line while
yet there was time, but Montrose refused. He was bound by his duty
to the king to carry relief to England, and that at once. His
problem was the old one of how to raise an army, but to go north
among the clans again would mean an intolerable delay, and he
believed that he could achieve the same result on the Border.
Cavalry was his first need, for Aboyne's defection had left him
with scarcely a hundred troopers, most of them Lord Airlie's
Ogilvys. He hoped for large levies as a consequence of Douglas's
recruiting, and still more from Home and Roxburgh. His further
plans we do not k<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id=
"Page_284">[284]</a></span>now&mdash;whether he intended to seek
out and test the quality of David Leslie or to march boldly
southward to the king. His immediate business was to get an army,
so on the Saturday afternoon the royalists turned to their right
and marched down Gala Water towards Tweedside. Next day, at
Torwoodlee, Douglas and Ogilvy joined them with a large body of
horse from Nithsdale and upper Clydesdale. The recruits were all
lairds or lairds' sons, and their immediate retainers&mdash;a
half-hearted and unstable crew, who had none of the old
moss-trooping fire. Somewhere, too, on Gala Water, Linton arrived
with his Peeblesshire troop, and his father, Traquair, rode over to
visit the viceroy. He came in all likelihood to spy out the
nakedness of the land, with results which we shall see.</p>
<p>Marching slowly down Tweed, Montrose reached Kelso on the 8th or
9th. It was the appointed rendezvous, but he found no sign of Home
or Roxburgh. He waited for a day, and then he heard ominous news.
The Border earls were with Leslie&mdash;prisoners, so ran their own
story, captured by Middleton and his advance guard. It was a tale
which common opinion scouted, and indeed it is inconceivable that
two powerful nobles, in their own countryside, twenty miles from
Leslie's line of march, and with complete knowledge of his coming,
should not have been able to escape if they had wished it. It is
far more probable that, knowing Leslie's strength and Montrose's
predicament, they sought security by putting themselves in the
enemy's power.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id=
"FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class=
"fnanchor">[461]</a></p>
<p>To tarry at Kelso was mere folly, so Montrose turned wearily up
Tweed. The spring he had most counted on was dry. Douglas held out
hopes of raising the westlands&mdash;vain hopes, for in no quarter
of Scotland was the power of the ministers so great; he rated the
prestige of the Douglas name higher than was warranted by facts.
Montrose accepted the plan, for in any case it would lead him back
to the hills to which he had always turned his eyes for help. He
marched to Jedburgh, but there was nothin<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>g to be
looked for from the Kerrs, whose chief, Lothian, was a Covenanting
general. Then he entered the Scott country, but Buccleuch was with
Leslie, and the old raiding spirit was dying in the glens. The
successors of Wat of Harden and Dickie of Dryhope were a peaceable
folk, and brawls at a fair or a clipping were their only form of
war. He would have fared better among the Armstrongs and Elliots
farther south, who, as Cromwell was to discover, were still good
men of their hands.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id=
"FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class=
"fnanchor">[462]</a> There was another reason for his failure in
the presence of his Irish contingent, for Border memories are long,
and a hundred years before Hertford, in his invasion of Scotland,
had used Irish in his work of destruction, and these Irish had
taken no prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id=
"FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class=
"fnanchor">[463]</a></p>
<p>During the march Sir Robert Spottiswoode wrote a letter<a name=
"FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>&mdash;never
posted&mdash;to Digby, who was still nursing his vain dreams. He
told him of Montrose's desperate plight, and upbraided him for not
detaining Leslie in England. He asked what had become of the
promised cavalry. "You little imagine the difficulties my lord
marquis hath here to wrestle with. The overcoming of the enemy is
the least of them; he hath more to do with his seeming friends. . .
. All these were great disheartenings to any other but to him, whom
nothing of this kind can amaze. With the small forces he hath
presently with him he is resolved to pursue David Leslie, and not
suffer him to grow stronger." Digby at the moment, and for a
fortnight later, was full of hope and confidence, which even the
disaster of Rowton Heath could not shake. Stories were reaching him
of a mysterious fight in Westmoreland, in which Crawford and Ogilvy
were said to have annihilated Leslie. Soon he was to hear from
Byron that the soldiers in Poyntz's army were celebrating a great
victory which had shattered Montrose's power.<a name=
"FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The first tale was
false, the second only too true.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id=
"Page_286">[286]</a></span>
<p>On the afternoon of the 12th of September Montrose arrived at
the gate of the hill country, the flat of Philiphaugh, under the
little burgh of Selkirk, where the two glens of Yarrow and Ettrick
meet. Just below the junction of the streams, on the left bank of
Ettrick, is a level meadow a quarter of a mile wide, with the water
on one side and a rugged hill on the other. Here he fixed his camp,
and placed the few guns which had been part of the booty of
Kilsyth. It was protected on the south and east by the Ettrick, on
the north by the hills, and on the west by Yarrow and the steep
wood called the Hareheadshaw. The position was a strong one, but as
the army did not expect a battle it was very loosely held. There
was no premonition of immediate danger. Leslie was believed to be
far away on the Forth, and, in Sir Robert Spottiswoode's letter to
Digby, Montrose was said to be resolute to chase him. He did not
know that the pursued had become the pursuer.</p>
<p>At Gladsmuir, in East Lothian, late on the 11th of September,
Leslie had received a letter revealing the whereabouts and the
weakness of the royalist force. Popular tradition made Traquair the
sender, and there is no reason to disbelieve a tale so consistent
with the character of a family which, during the Covenant, as
during the later Jacobite wars, was uniformly treacherous. Traquair
had also shown his hand by sending a message to his son, Lord
Linton, to withdraw him and his troops from Montrose's
camp.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Leslie, when he got
the news, at once changed his plans. He marched straight down Gala
Water, crossed the ridge at Rink by the old Edinburgh-Selkirk road,
and forded Tweed below the Rae Weil.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id=
"FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class=
"fnanchor">[467]</a> Late on the night of the 12th he reached the
hamlet of Sunderland, which stood on the peninsula formed by the
junction of Tweed and Ettrick. There to h<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>is
relief he had news of the enemy. Some pickets, under Charteris of
Amisfield, were in the village, and these were driven out with a
few casualties. Leslie was now less than three miles from the
royalist camp. He had caught his quarry, but only by the skin of
his teeth, for another day would have seen Montrose safe in the
hills.</p>
<p>A little trenching was done on the eastern and western flanks
before Montrose's small army settled down for the night. A mounted
patrol was sent out under Ogilvy of Powrie, and returned to report
that all was quiet; they were probably impressed local men, maybe
Traquair's tenants, and they may have taken their commander where
nothing could be seen or heard. The king's captain-general left the
posting of the pickets to his officers, and retired himself with
his cavalry leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id=
"Page_288">[288]</a></span>s to a lodging in the West Port of
Selkirk.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id=
"FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class=
"fnanchor">[468]</a> Here for most of the night he busied himself
with dispatches to the king. He had many heavy matters on his mind,
and was suffering from one of those fits of bodily and mental
languor which come at times upon the greatest commanders. No doubt
he had given instructions that, except for the most urgent
business, he was not to be disturbed. The night had fallen moonless
and dark as pitch. Some time before midnight Charteris of Amisfield
arrived with his story of having been driven out of Sunderland
village. His account must have been confused, and the incident was
apparently regarded by the headquarters staff as a drunken brawl
among Charteris' troopers or a brush with hostile
country-folk<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id=
"FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class=
"fnanchor">[469]</a>&mdash;at any rate not of sufficient moment to
break in upon the privacy of the captain-general.</p>
<p>The morning of the 13th dawned with one of those thick autumnal
fogs, which in the valley bottoms in the early hours prevent a man
seeing three yards before him. Scouts were sent out again at the
first light, and reported that the country was clear. So it was to
north, south, and west, on all sides except the east, the direction
of Sunderland, and Amisfield's report from that quarter had already
been discounted. The army in the haugh cooked a leisurely meal, and
Montrose, in his Selkirk lodging, with only an hour or two of sleep
behind him, sat down to breakfast.</p>
<p>Meantime Leslie had launched his thunderbolt. He had divided his
forces into two parts, and with one marched swiftly up the left
bank of Ettrick. The other, 2,000 strong, which included
Kirkcudbright's Dragoons, under the command of James Agnew of
Lochnaw,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id=
"FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class=
"fnanchor">[470]</a> had crossed that water, and by way of Will's
Nick had reached the Selkirk road. The royalists, having finished
their meal, were assembling for parade, when through the thinning
mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id=
"Page_289">[289]</a></span>t came the rush of Leslie's horse.</p>
<p>To Montrose in the West Port arrived his scoutmaster, Captain
Blackadder, with the shattering news. He flung himself on his
horse, and with Airlie, Crawford, and Napier, galloped to his army.
He found the field in confusion. Douglas's bonnet-lairds, in spite
of their gallant leader, had fled at the first shot. The 500
Ulstermen, however, were fighting a desperate fight in their
shallow trenches. Montrose collected a hundred troopers, and
charged Leslie so madly that for a moment he drove back the whole
Covenant horse. But 600 men taken by surprise, and with no
advantage of position, cannot for long do battle with 6,000.
Leslie's other division harassed the royalist right flank with
musketry fire from beyond the stream, and presently had forded
Ettrick and were attacking it from behind. The Irish were beaten
out of their trenches into a second position, the folds of
Philiphaugh farm.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id=
"FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class=
"fnanchor">[471]</a> Again and again the Covenant troopers charged,
only to be driven back by the heroic Ulstermen; again and again
Montrose's hundred cut their way deep into the enemy's ranks.
Philiphaugh was less a battle than a surprise and a massacre. Soon
only fifty horse were left, and of the Irish more than 400 were
dead. The remnant under their adjutant, Stewart, were induced to
surrender on a promise of quarter.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id=

<br>
<p>Montrose fought with a gallantry and a desperation worthy of
Alasdair, and but for his friends would have died on the field.
Lord Douglas and Sir John Dalziel pled <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>with him
to take the chance of flight, urging that so long as he lived the
king's cause need not go down. He allowed himself to be
constrained. With about thirty others, including the two Napiers,
Lord Erskine, and Lord Fleming, as well as Dalziel and Douglas, he
cut a road to the west and repulsed a feeble attempt at pursuit.
The little party galloped up Yarrow vale, and at Broadmeadows took
the drove-road across Minchmoor to Tweeddale. As they disappeared
into the green hills, with them disappeared the dream of a new and
happier Scotland. Montrose's cycle of victories had proved like the
fairy gold which vanishes in a man's hand. The year of miracles was
ended.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> September</div>
<p>Montrose did not draw rein till he reached the old house of
Traquair, whose grey and haunted walls still stand among the
meadows where the Quair burn flows to Tweed. Its lord shut his door
on the fugitive; his welcome was reserved for the conquering
Leslie, when, with Argyll and Lothian, he arrived later in pursuit.
He did not cross Tweed at the bridge of Peebles, but rode up the
right bank by the Sware to Manor, and thus to Stobo by the
Glack.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Thence the company
pushed on to Biggar in Clydesdale, where they spent the night, and
long before the next daybreak were in the saddle and heading for
the north, guided by Dalziel, who was now in his own countryside.
Fugitives were picked up by the way, including an Ulsterman, who
had wrapped the colours of the foot round his breast, and, having
found a horse, caught up Montrose and restored <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>to him
one of the standards. The other, the cavalry colours, was carried
by Kinnoull's brother, William Hay, into England, and months
afterwards was brought to Montrose in the north. At a ford of Clyde
they met, to their joy, old Airlie and Crawford, who had probably
taken the route by Megget and upper Tweed, and had collected on the
road some of Douglas's fleeing troopers. Somehow the party made
their way through the midlands, and by the 19th were safe in the
Perthshire hills.</p>
<p>The Scots troops in Newcastle entertained the mayor and aldermen
to a dinner to celebrate the victory of Philiphaugh.<a name=
"FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Elsewhere the
celebrations were of a grimmer kind, for now came the harvest of
the triumphant Covenant. It began on the day of the battle, when
300 Irishwomen, with their children, were butchered on the field.
Those who wish to sup deep on horrors can find the details in
Patrick Gordon. The cooks and horse-boys also perished to the
number of some 200. The remnant of the Irish under Stewart had
surrendered on terms, but the ministers who accompanied Leslie
remonstrated against the Lord's work being hindered by a foolish
clemency. They argued that quarter had been granted to Stewart
alone, and not to his men; Leslie professed being himself convinced
by this shameless quibble, and the unarmed Irish were cut down as
they stood, or shot next morning in the courtyard of Newark
castle.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id=
"FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class=
"fnanchor">[475]</a> O'Cahan and another officer, Lachlan, were
spared for the moment, only to be hanged later in Edinburgh without
a trial. Stewart was also destined for death, but was fortunate
enough to escape to Montrose.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>The zeal of the Covenant against the daughters of Heth was not
satiated by the butchery of Philiphaugh. Many had escaped, and were
slaughtered singly as they wandered among the moors of Tweed and
Clyde. In most county histories the slaying is ascribed to the
infuriated country people, but for this there is no evidence. The
Lowland peasantry have never had a taste for such brutalities, and
the murders were probably the work of the soldiers of the Covenant,
who beat the hills for royalists, as Lag's dragoons were to beat
them forty years later for Covenanters.<a name="FNanchor_476_476"
id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class=
"fnanchor">[476]</a> One large party of the poor creatures was
brought to Leslie's camp at Linlithgow. They were flung over the
bridge of Avon, and were either drowned in the river or stabbed
with the pikes of the soldiers who lined the banks.<a name=
"FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The records of the
Irish rebellion hold no more horrid cruelties. The inspiration was
not Leslie's; it came from the fierce bigots who accompanied him.
Sometimes the soldiers sickened of the work, and asked their
clerical advisers, as Leslie asked Nevoy at Dunavertie, "Mr. John,
have you not once gotten your fill of blood?"<a name=
"FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>
<p>For these barbarities, sanctioned and inspired by the Kirk,
there can be no defence. It is hard to understand the view taken by
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id=
"Page_294">[294]</a></span> apologists that the Irish were nameless
savages, who by their crimes had forfeited all consideration from
mankind. It is a royalist historian who has left the most hostile
account of them. "The Irish in particular were too cruel; for it
was everywhere observed they did ordinarily kill all they could be
master of, without any motion of pity, or any consideration of
humanity. Nay, it seemed to them there were no distinctions between
a man and a beast, for they killed men ordinarily with no more
feeling of compassion, and with the same careless neglect that they
kill a hare or capon for their supper. And they were also without
all shame, most brutally given to uncleanness and filthy lust; as
for excessive drinking, when they came where it might be had there
were no limits to their beastly appetites, as for godless avarice
and merciless oppression and plundering of the poor labourer. Of
these two crying sins the Scots were as guilty as they."<a name=
"FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> It is a grave
indictment, but it could be written of most armies of the time, and
Patrick Gordon, who, as a decent Aberdonian, disliked the rude
western clans, was a stern critic. No doubt it was brutal warfare,
and in an army of volunteers discipline must have been hard to
enforce. The Irish, who were mainly Scottish Macdonalds, slew
fiercely in battle, but so did the Covenant troops at Philiphaugh
and Carbisdale, so did the Campbells when Argyll carried fire and
sword through the north, and so would have the Covenanters in the
first Bishops' War if Montrose had not restrained them. On at least
two occasions, Aberdeen and Inverlochy, they gave little or no
quarter, but there is no evidence that they murdered in cold blood
prisoners who surrendered after an action. Nor is there any record,
except for the sack of Aberdeen, of the slaughter of women which
stains the fair fame of their opponents, both Covenanters and
Cromwellians. Our evidence shows that they were cheerful ruffians,
who loved fighting for fighting's sake, and cracked jokes in the
thick of a battle. As for the women, no doubt they were often
concubines rather than wives, and no doubt they stole; but marriage
lines were not universal in the Covenant's armies, and Leven's
female followers thieved like<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> daws.<a name=
"FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Nor can we place the
two sets of outrages in different moral categories, because the
Covenanters were inspired by a religious creed. It makes small
difference in the guilt of murder whether the murderer slays
because his blood is hot in battle and he likes it, or whether he
massacres at leisure because he is playing at being an early
Israelite. The motive of both clergy and laity&mdash;and their only
defence&mdash;was naked fear, and there is no such begetter of
cruelty. Legends, born partly of the Irish rebellion and partly of
rumours from the north, had magnified the Irish into monsters of
terror; the same rumours were to be rife later about Cromwell's
English soldiers<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id=
"FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class=
"fnanchor">[481]</a>&mdash;with more reason, perhaps, for some of
them had been at Wexford and Drogheda. Also the theocracy knew that
it was fighting for its life.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645-46</i> Oct.-Jan.</div>
<p>The roll of captives was long. Some of Montrose's closest
friends, like Lord Ogilvy, Sir Robert Spottiswoode, Sir William
Rollo, and Nathaniel Gordon, were in enemy hands, having
surrendered on promise of quarter. Leslie marched slowly through
the Lothians towards Glasgow, where a provisional committee dealt
with the prisoners. Meantime the two Irish officers, O'Cahan and
Lachlan, had been hanged on the castle hill of Edinburgh&mdash;the
last we shall hear of two very gallant gentlemen. The royalist
leaders were all reserved for death, though the lay members of the
court were disposed to be merciful. On the 20th of October, on the
date and in the place which Montrose had appointed for the
Parliament, the Committee of the Estates sat in judgment. The first
to be dealt with was Sir William Rollo, whose brother had married
Argyll's sister. For all his lameness he had never left Montrose's
side, and he had been one of his most trusted brigadiers. He was
beheaded at the Mercat Cross on the 28th. On the following day
there died Sir Philip Nisbet, who had fought with Rupert and with
Montrose on the English Borders, and you<span class=

these executions, and Mr. Robert Baillie remembered with disquiet
that "to this day no man in England has been executed for bearing

<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> January</div>
<p>Owing to a raid threatened by Montrose the rest of the
executions were postponed. They began again in St. Andrews after
Christmas. The Kirk was in terror lest Parliament should be too
merciful, and appeals flowed in from synods and presbyteries.
Galloway prayed that the "sword of justice may be impartially drawn
against those persons now in bonds who have lifted up their hands
against the Lord, the sworn Covenant, and this afflicted Kirk." "We
need not lay before your honours," said the voice of Dumfries,
"what the Lord calls for at your hands in the point of justice, nor
what you owe unto the many thousands of His people." "We are
confident," wrote the gentle ministers of the Merse, "that your
hearts will not faint nor your hands fail until you have cut off
the horns of the wicked." Wariston excelled himself, for he proved

<p>The Lord's people were soon to be comforted, for the Estates set
to work in earnest. But meantime one of their chief victims
escaped. Lord Ogilvy could look for no mercy, for his family were
the pet aversion of Argyll, and during his short three weeks of
liberty he had been the right hand of the king's captain-general.
But he was a cousin of Lindsay and akin, on the maternal side, to
the Hamiltons, so he was permitted the last consolation of a visit
from his mother, his wife, and his sister. He was sick in bed when
the ladies were admitted in the dusk of a December evening.
Adopting Lady Nithsdale's device of a later day, his sister put on
his nightcap and got into his bed, while he dressed himself in her
clothes. When the guards entered, they found three tearful women
taking farewell of the doomed prisoner, and conducted them to the
prison gate. Horses were waiting close at hand, and Ogilvy galloped
across Fife to join Inchbrakie in Menteith. Argyll would have
visited his wrath on the heroic lady, but the Hamilton influence
was strong enough to save her from punishment.</p>
<p>There was no hope for the others. They were tried, not as the
law enjoined by their peers or by the whole Parliament, but by a
self-appointed committee. Some of the judges voted with
qualifications, but the verdict was certain. Hartfell indeed was
pardoned. He was disliked by the Hamiltons, and Argyll owed them a
tit-for-tat for their clemency towards the Ogilvys. On January 20,
1646, the "Maiden," which had been brought from Dundee, was set up
at the cross of St. Andrews, and the ancient city saw again "the
auld rusty lass linking at a bluidy hairst."<a name=

Gordon, Andrew Guthrie&mdash;a son of the Bishop of Moray&mdash;and
Sir Robert Spottiswoode paid the last penalty. Three days later
died William Murray, a boy of nineteen, whom the half-hearted pleas
of his Covenanting brother, Tullibardine, could not save.<a name=

Mr. Robert Blair attended the prisoners in their last hours, and
found a penitent in Nathaniel Gordon, who was accordingly

sentence of excommunication; for that stout adventurer had a good

"FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class=
"fnanchor">[488]</a> But with the others the ministers did not
succeed. Andrew Guthrie declared that he could not conceive a
greater honour than to meet an honourable death in so just a cause.
The boy, William Murray, confessed his private sins, but denied
that he was a traitor; his death, he said, was a new distinction
for the house of Tullibardine.</p>
<p>The case of Sir Robert Spottiswoode had given qualms to many of
his judges. He was an old man; he was a learned lawyer and a ripe
scholar; he had been Lord President of the Court of Session; he was
a non-combatant, and had surrendered on a promise of quarter to
Lanark, whom he had succeeded as the king's secretary for Scotland.
There was nothing in his life which his enemies could cavil at.
While the Covenant still kept up a pretence of royalism and
legality, his execution was plain murder. He was not permitted to
read an address from the scaffold,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id=
"FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class=
"fnanchor">[489]</a> and replied to the importunities of Mr. Robert
Blair that his blasphemous outpourings were abominable to God. His
last words were: "Merciful Jesus, gather my soul unto Thy saints
and martyrs, who have run before me in this race."</p>
<p>The night before his death Sir Robert wrote a letter of farewell
to Montrose,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id=
"FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class=
"fnanchor">[490]</a> which breathes a spirit of Christian
forbearance unhappily lacking in those who had the name of religion
always on their lips. He commends to the viceroy's care his orphan
children and nephews, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299"
id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>d hopes to do more for the king's
cause by his death than by his life. "One thing I most humbly
recommend to your Excellence that, as you have always done
hitherto, so you will continue by fair and gentle carriage to win
the people's affection for their prince, rather than to imitate the
barbarous inhumanity of your adversaries." The advice was nobly
followed. There were no reprisals on the Covenant prisoners
confined in the castle of Blair. "Never," ran Montrose's address to
his troops, "shall they induce us to rival their crimes, or seek to
outdo them except in valour and renown." In a great civil struggle
neither side has a monopoly of the virtues. There were many in the
Covenant ranks in whom the fire of religious faith had burned up
all human fears, and who were to give honourable proof of the
manhood which was in them. It was a time of darkness and suffering,
when men's minds were turning from the bleak world of sense to the
dream of a better world beyond the grave, and in such seasons the
homely virtues on which depends the conduct of our mortal life are
apt to be forgotten. This forgetfulness was most marked in those
who lived most constantly in the contemplation of a promised
immortality; and in the matter of human charity and mercy there can
be little comparison for the unbiased historian between the two
parties. Montrose's army was guilty of acts of cruelty in hot
blood, but never at its worst did it approach the consistent,
deadly barbarity of the Kirk and the Estates. Twenty years later,
when the Covenant was the losing side, and the fanatics who now
ruled in Scotland had been driven to the mosses, there must have
been many quiet, old-fashioned folk in the land, who, casting back
their memories to the days after Philiphaugh, saw in the change the
slow grinding of the mills of God. In one respect the later
persecution, bad and indefensible as it was, fell short in
grossness of the earlier, for its perpetrators in their evil work
did not profane the name of the mee<span class="pagenum"><a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> October</div>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>For Montrose defeat was only a spur to fresh effort. The
flexible steel of his courage could not be bent or broken. From his
refuge in Atholl he sent Erskine to recruit in Mar, and Douglas and
Airlie to raise the royalists of Angus. He made a further effort to
get into touch with Alasdair, and wrote again to Digby, begging for
horse. In Atholl the country-folk were busy with the late harvest,
but the name of the viceroy was a spell, and 400 followed him. But
his principal aim, as ever, was the Gordon cavalry. He hastened
over the Grampians, and early in October was at Drumminor castle,
near Strathbogie, where Aboyne, his late grievances apparently
forgotten, joined him with 1,500 foot and 300 horse. A less welcome
recruit appeared in the person of the mischievous Lord Lewis. There
followed news of the father. After Kilsyth Huntly had removed
himself from the Strathnaver bogs, and was now at his castle of
Gight. He sent Montrose a tepid message of good wishes, and spoke
nobly of what he and his clan would still do for the king. For the
moment it looked as if the chief of the Gordons had learned wisdom
in exile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Middleton, with 800 of Leslie's horse, had marched
north to the Aberdeenshire lowlands, and was now lying at Turriff.
Montrose had two alternatives before him. He could attack Middleton
with his new army and settle with him before turning to Leslie.
Such a course would protect the Gordon lands, and might keep Huntly
in good humour. On the other hand, his friends were prisoners in
Glasgow, and unless he rescued them forthwith they would perish.
Leslie, too, was the more formidable foe, and it was always
Montrose's habit to take the greater danger first. Besides, Leslie
lay between him and the Border, and on the Border he still
cherished vain dreams of meeting the king. Accordingly he gave
marching orders for the south.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>Lewis Gordon, with such of his clan as he could induce to follow
him, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id=
"Page_302">[302]</a></span>deserted on the second morning. Aboyne
remained for another day's march, but peremptory letters arrived
from his father to recall him. Huntly's insane jealousy had
revived, and he would neither fight himself nor permit his men to
fight under another leader. Montrose sent Lord Reay and young
Irvine of Drum to reason with him, but they were unable to shake
his purpose. The precious days were slipping past in this barren
diplomacy, and on the 22nd of October Montrose, then at the
Castleton of Braemar, decided to advance without the Gordons. That
night he lay in Glenshee, and on the 23rd was on Lochearnside,
where he may have heard that the first executions of his friends
had taken place. He was momentarily cheered by a message from
Aboyne that he hoped soon to join him, and, as he waited for the
Gordons, Ogilvy of Powrie appeared with other news. The king had at
last made a desperate effort to fulfil his promise, and on the 14th
of October Digby and Langdale had set out from Welbeck with 1,500
horse. Montrose was summoned to join hands with them on the Border,
and he at once sent off word to Huntly and Aboyne. But, as he
waited, there presently arrived melancholy tidings. On the 15th
Digby and Langdale had scattered Poyntz's infantry at Sherburn, but
were in turn surprised and driven north in confusion to Skipton.
Digby himself, with Nithsdale and Carnwath, resolved to make a wild
dash for the Border, and, in spite of a defeat at Carlisle, pushed
on across Esk with a small party of horse. On the 22nd or 23rd he
was as far north as Dumfries, but he could not stay. He had no news
of Montrose, and far too much news of Leslie; he began his retreat,
his men deserted into the Cumberland hills, and he himself was
compelled to flee to the Isle of Man. On the day that Montrose left
Braemar, Digby's raid had come to an inglorious end.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> Oct.-Nov.</div>
<p>Montrose's one object was now to prevent further executions, so
he marched south into the Lennox, where lay his own lands of
Mugdock, now transferred by Parliament to Argyll. He had a force of
some 1,500, mostly Atholl men and Farquharsons, including 300 horse
raised by Erskine and Ogilvy, and his appearance so near Glasgow
did indeed procure a postponement of the bloody work at the Mercat
Cross. He took up his quarters at Buchanan on
Lochlomondside&mdash;then the seat of the Covenanting Sir George
Buchanan,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id=
"FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class=
"fnanchor">[491]</a> but now the home of Montrose's
descendants&mdash;and for a week or so threatened Glasgow. Leslie
had 3,000 troops in or about the city, and Montrose, with his raw
levies, did not dare to meet that veteran horse in open battle. It
was a hopeless form of war, as he soon realized, and early in
November he passed into Menteith. Presently he made a journey into
Angus, from which he was hunted back by Middleton's dragoons.
Historians have assumed that he went to attend his wife's funeral,
but, since Lady Montrose lived till 1648, that explanation must be
abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id=
"FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class=
"fnanchor">[492]</a></p>
<p>He returned to Atholl to find that his brother-in-law and most
trusted adviser, the old Lord Napier, had died at Fincastle in his
absence. Napier was over seventy years of age, and had spent his
long and blameless life in the pursuit of the liberal arts and the
service of his fellow-men. He was the wisest head in the Scotland
of his day, a staunch Presbyterian, an upholder of popular
liberties, an exponent of the unpopular doctrine of
toleration&mdash;the type of what the Covenanters might have been
in happier circumstances. About the same time Montrose received a
letter from Charles, written from Newark on 3rd November, which may
have done something to sweeten his memory of Digby's failure. "As
it hath been none of my least afflictions and misfortunes," the
king wrote, "that you have had hitherto no assistance from me, so I
conjure you to belie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id=
"Page_303">[303]</a></span>ve that nothing but impossibility hath
been the cause of it. . . . Be assured that your less prosperous
fortune is so far from lowering my estimation of you, that it will
rather cause my affection to kythe (show) the clearlier to you. . .

your most assured, faithful, constant friend."<a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1645</i> December</div>
<p>From his old friend's grave Montrose turned again to the weary
business of chaffering with Huntly. He sent Sir John Dalziel to him
to ask for a conference; but Huntly, as shy as he was vain, seemed
to fear to meet his rival and declined. Montrose resolved to see
him at all costs, and early in December set off again from Atholl
across the hills. It was now midwinter&mdash;a worse cold, says
Wishart, than his generation had ever known.<a name=
"FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> A bitter frost
coated everything with ice, but did not make the streams the easier
to cross, and that December passage of the barrier mountains of Esk
and Dee lived in the memory of men who were no strangers to
hardships. The feet of the infantry were clogged with snow, the
horses floundered in half-frozen bogs, or crashed through the ice
of mountain pools. Christmas that year, which saw the death
sentences of his friends at St. Andrews, found Montrose pursuing
the evasive Huntly from one refuge to another. He looked for him in
Strathbogie, but Huntly fled to the Bog of Gight. Thither Montrose
followed, and the Gordon, at bay, was obliged to receive him. Under
the spell of the viceroy's grace and courtesy the cloud of
suspicion seemed to lift. Huntly was roused to interest. He had
1,400 foot and 600 horse. These, combined with Montrose's 800 foot
and 200 horse, would make a formidable army. He promised his
support in the northern war, and offered to lead his men through
the lowlands of Moray to the siege of Inverness, while Montrose
marched down Strathspey. The capture of that town might fix
Seaforth's loyalty, which once more was up for auction. Aboyne and
Lord Lewis wished, in Wishart's phrase, "damnation to t<span class=

the future. They were to do their best to earn it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> Jan.-Mar.</div>
<p>The operations of the year 1646 began, therefore, with good
promise of success. The promise was not fulfilled. The next few
months must have been among the most wretched in Montrose's life.
With a heart aching from the loss of his comrades, with a drenched
and starving following, and with no news save the gloomiest from
the south, he conducted an ineffective guerilla war up and down
Speyside. Huntly had nearly twice his number of foot and thrice his
number of horse, but he refused to co-operate. The splendid
fighting force of the Gordons was frittered away, and their chief
declined to undertake any operation of war except the siege of some
little castles in Moray to gratify private animosities. Montrose's
patient letters to him are the only clues we have as to the
movements of the royal army.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id=

"fnanchor">[495]</a> It was at Advie and Castle Grant in the end of
December 1645, moving about Strathspey in January 1646, at Kylochy
on the Findhorn in February, and at Petty on the coast in
March.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> March-April</div>
<p>Elsewhere there were bold deeds to record. Twelve hundred of
Argyll's clan, under Campbell of Ardkinglass, finding commons short
in Lorn, had come raiding to the Menteith lands of Napier and other
royalists, where they were joined by oddments of various clans,
like the Menzieses and the Stewarts of Balquhidder. Inchbrakie and
young Drummond of Balloch, having been sent to recruit in Atholl,
heard of these doings, and, with some 700 of the Atholl men, came
up with the raiders on the 13th of February, near Callander, and
thoroughly routed them. The remnant was found by Argyll huddling
under the walls of Stirling; he dispatched them into Renfrewshire,
where the local Covenanters would have none of these strange allies
of the Covenant, and finally&mdash;Inchbrakie a<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>nd his
men having gone north&mdash;sent them back into the Lennox to live
on the country.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id=
"FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class=
"fnanchor">[497]</a> Another fine performance was the defence of
Kincardine castle by the young Lord Napier. With fifty men he held
the place against Middleton for fourteen days, and then, when
capitulation was imminent, escaped by night with Drummond of
Balloch to Montrose. Middleton, on the 16th of March, burned the
house where Montrose had spent his youth, and left the viceroy
landless and homeless.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id=
"FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class=
"fnanchor">[498]</a></p>
<p>There were no such exploits to redeem the futile campaign in the
north. The vital objective was Inverness, the capture of which
would not only give control of a large piece of territory and
important communications, but would recruit trimmers like Seaforth
and the Mackenzies, the Grants, Macleod of Skye, and Macdonald of
Sleat. Accordingly, early in April Montrose sat down before
Inverness, and on the 29th of that month drew his lines close and
fixed his guns on the top of the old Castle Hill. The Ness was
unusually low, and the invading army lived largely on the Fraser
country to the west of it.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id=
"FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class=
"fnanchor">[499]</a> The garrison was strong and well-supplied, and
it ruthlessly destroyed all outlying buildings of the town which
might give shelter to the enemy; but Montrose, strengthened by some
of Seaforth's Mackenzies and by Macdonalds from the west, would
beyond doubt have captured it had it not been for Huntly. Middleton
had come north again, Leslie having departed for England to look
after arrears of pay, and the 1,400 men he brought with him, joined
to the Aberdeen garrison he had left behind, made a formidable army
on the royalist flank. The Gordons lay between Middleton and
Montrose, and it was their business to watch the former and prevent
him from crossing the Spey. But Huntly was busy with private
vendettas, and sent only insulting replies to his colleague's
appeals. Montrose was, therefore, compelled<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> to
detach three troops of horse, which he could ill spare, to watch
the Spey crossings. Lord Lewis, who held the castle of Rothes,
whether out of treachery or a misplaced sense of humour, sent a
false message to the troops, decoyed them to Rothes, and detained
them there till Middleton was across the river.<a name=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> May</div>
<p>The first news Montrose had of Middleton was the sounding of his
trumpets on the 5th of May, two miles from Inverness. He had
nothing to withstand so strong a cavalry force, so he was compelled
to raise the siege. With Crawford commanding his rearguard, he
crossed the Ness above the town, marched north-west by way of the
Caiplich, and put the Beauly between him and his pursuer. In the
hurry of his retreat he was compelled to leave behind him all his
stores and ammunition and his two brass field-pieces. Middleton
followed at his leisure, but on 8th May Montrose gave him the slip,
doubled back by Strathglass and Stratherrick, and presently was
again on Speyside.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id=
"FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class=
"fnanchor">[501]</a></p>
<p>Matters had now reached a crisis. Huntly was not only no friend,
but was becoming an active enemy, and Montrose resolved to treat
him as such. He had just, with considerable losses, taken and
plundered Aberdeen, and was clearly determined to play for his own
hand. But first Montrose made one final effort to see him and bring
him to reason. On the 27th of May he rode twenty miles to the Bog
of Gight, but Huntly saw him coming and fled. It was the last
straw. The viceroy decided to write off the Gordons from the royal
strength in Scotland, and to let Middleton make of them what he
pleased. He would form a light flying squadron and ride through the
northern Highlands to beat up recruits for the king. If Alasdair
was gone beyond reach, he had some ho<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>pes of Seaforth and Sleat,
he had Reay on his side, and he was certain of the Macleans, of
Clanranald, and of Glengarry. It was a course which his wisest
counsellors advised, and, with such allies, it would be strange if
he could not bring to the field as stout a force as that which had
scattered the Covenant in a year of battles.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>But on the 31st of May a fateful message arrived from the king.
This is not the place to describe the alternations of hope and
despondency through which Charles passed, between Digby's fiasco in
the north and that day in April when he slipped out of beleaguered
Oxford to cast himself upon the mercy of the Scots. Negotiations
had been for long in progress with Montreuil, the French
ambassador, as intermediary, but Leven and his friends, while
hinting at much, would commit nothing to writing. The Scots had
lost all love for their English allies. The ministers had begun to
realize that their conception of Presbytery was very different from
that held by the English Parliament and the City of London. "The
Pope and the King," wrote Baillie, "were never more earnest for the
headship of the Church than the plurality of this Parliament;" and
again, "The leaders of the people seemed to be inclined to have no
shadow of a king; to have liberty for all religions; to have but a
lame Erastian Presbytery; to be so injurious to us as to chase us
home by the sword."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id=
"FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class=
"fnanchor">[502]</a> The Scottish laity were now less high-flying
in their demands. They wished to see Presbyterianism entrenched in
England as a protection to their own liberties, for they realized
the growing military power of Independency; they wished the
neighbouring government to be in the hands of their friends; and
they could not mistake the meaning of the clause in the
capitulation of Exeter which exempted the besieged from taking the
Covenant.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id=
"FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class=
"fnanchor">[503]</a> The Independents were rapidly
becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id=
"Page_308">[308]</a></span> the national English party, hostile
alike to the French, the Irish, and the Scots. Argyll saw this
clearly, and his speech in the House of Lords on 25th June is
perhaps his chief claim to statesmanship, for he proposed an
elastic and tolerant form of Presbytery and combined it with some
admirable good sense on the subject of a constitutional
kingship.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id=
"FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class=
"fnanchor">[504]</a></p>
<p>But the time was past for such moderation. Antagonisms and
suspicions had been created which must battle together till they
destroyed each other. The mood of the nation was too feverish to
permit of compromise. The future lay with Hyde and men like him,
who would make no concession to what they regarded as sectional
tyrannies. "He represented . . . the only living force with which
Cromwell had seriously to count. The English Presbyterian members
of Parliament, the Scottish Presbyterian lords&mdash;nay, even the
king himself&mdash;were but the weavers of one vast intrigue with
many faces. Hyde stood firmly upon the ground of a sentiment which
would one day, through the errors of his antagonists, gain a hold
upon the nation, and he knew how to bide his time till the nation
had declared in his favour. It was not Puritanism, but the very
opposite of Puritanism&mdash;the expansion of the reasoning
intelligence&mdash;which held the main current of the thought of
the seventeenth century. Cromwell, mighty as he was, could but dam
back the current for a time, and when he had done his utmost he
would have toiled only that Hyde might step into his
place."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id=

"fnanchor">[505]</a></p>
<p>Even had there been a chance of agreement, it would have been
wrecked on the personality of the king. He could not realize that
the establishment of Presbytery in England was a bed-rock claim for
the Scots; they could not realize that their sovereign could be
blind to this constant article of their faith. Hence all talk about
the king being secured in conscience and honour if he entrusted
himself to them was idle; by these words the two parties did not
mean the same thing. Charles did not reali<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>ze that,
though the breach between the Scots and the Independents was
widening, there remained between him and them an impassable gulf.
No doubt there was on the Scottish side a grave lack of candour and
honesty, but there was an equal disingenuousness on the part of the
man who could write, as Charles did from Oxford in March, that he
was "not without hope that I shall be able so to draw either the
Presbyterians or the Independents to side with me for extirpating
one another, that I shall really be a king again."<a name=

<p>On 25th April Charles, disguised as a servant, rode out of
Oxford over Magdalen bridge, and about seven in the morning of 5th

"fnanchor">[507]</a> Before the king had eaten or drunk, Lothian
hurried to his presence and formulated his demands. The royalist
garrison must surrender Newark, the king must sign the Covenant,
and establish Presbytery in England and Wales, and must order
"James Graham" to lay down his arms. To this imperious speech
Charles replied with the dignity that never failed him: "He that
made thee an earl made James Graham a marquis."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> May-June</div>
<p>Then began a pathetic correspondence between the king who had
done so little and his captain-general who had done so much. The
esteem of Charles for his great servant had ripened into a warm
affection. "From henceforth," he had said a few months earlier, "I
place Montrose among my children, and mean to live with him as a
friend, and not as a king."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id=
"FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class=
"fnanchor">[508]</a> On 18th April he wrote to him from Oxford,
telling him of his intention to go to the Scots army, and
suggesting that Montrose, if he found that Leven had declared for
the king, should join forces with him; the letter was sent in
cypher through Nicholas t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310"

latter's discretion, and naturally was not forwarded.<a name=
"FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> On the 19th of May
he wrote to Montrose from Newcastle:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I am in such a condition as is much fitter for relation than
for writing. Wherefore, I refer you to this trusty bearer, Robin
Ker, for the reasons and manner of my coming to this army; as also,
what my treatment hath been since I came, and my resolutions upon
my whole business. This shall therefore only give you positive
commands, and tell you real truths, leaving the why of all to this
bearer. You must disband your forces and go into France, where you
shall receive my further direction. This at first may justly
startle you; but I assure you that, if for the present I should
offer to do more for you, I could not do so much."</p>
</div>
<p>Montrose received this letter on Speyside on the last day of
May. He called a council of his officers and laid it before them;
he invited Huntly, who replied haughtily that he knew all about the
matter, having himself had letters from the king. In his reply on
2nd June Montrose declared himself at his Majesty's commands, but
asked that some protection should be secured for those who had
risked all in the royal cause.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"For, when all is done that we can, I am much afraid that it
shall trouble both those with your Majesty, and all your servants
here, to quit these parts. And as for my own leaving this kingdom,
I shall in all humility and obedience endeavour to perform your
Majesty's command, wishing (rather nor any one should make pretext
of me) never to see it again with mine eyes; willing, as well by
passion as action, to witness myself your Majesty's most humble and
most faithful subject and servant."</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> June-July</div>
<p>He also wrote privately to the king, asking if his surrender to
the Scots had been by his own will or by compulsion; if the latter,
he would keep his army in being.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id=
"FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class=

Glenshee to await the king's answer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id=
"Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<p>Charles replied on the 15th of June, repeating his commands, and
promising protection for Montrose's followers.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I assure you that I no less esteem your willingness to lay down
arms at my command for a gallant and real expression of your zeal
and affection to my service than any of your former actions. But I
hope that you cannot have so mean an opinion of me that, for any
particular or worldly respects, I could suffer you to be ruined.
No. I avow that it is one of the greatest and truest marks of my
present miseries that I cannot recompense you according to your
deserts, but, on the contrary, must yet suffer a cloud of the
misfortunes of the times to hang over you. . . . For there is no
man, who ever heard me speak of you, that is ignorant that the
reason that makes me at this time send you out of the country is
that you may return home with the greater glory; and in the
meantime to have as honourable employment as I can put upon you.
This trusty bearer, Robin Ker, will tell you the care I have had of
all your friends and mine; to whom, albeit I cannot furnish such
conditions as I would, yet they will be such as, all things
considered, are most fit for them to accept. Wherefore, I renew my
former directions of laying down arms unto you, desiring you to let
Huntly, Crawford, Airlie, Seaforth, and Ogilvy know that want of
time hath made me now omit to reiterate my former command to them,
intending that this shall serve for all, assuring them and all the
rest of my friends that, whensoever God shall enable me, they shall
reap the fruits of their loyalty and affection to my service."</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> July</div>
<p>On the 16th of July the king wrote again:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The most sensible part of my many misfortunes is to see my
friends in distress and not to be able to help them, and of this
kind you are the chief. Wherefore, according to that real freedom
and friendship which is between us, as I cannot absolutely command
you to accept of unhandsome conditions, so I must tell you that I
believe your refusal will put you in a far worse estate than your
compliance will. This is the reason that I have told this bearer,
Robin Ker, and the Commissioners here, that I have commanded you to
accept of Middleton's conditions, which really I judge to be your
best course according to this present time; for, if this
opportunity be let slip, you must not expect any more treaties; in
which case you must either conquer all Scotland or be inevitably
ruined. . . . Wherefore if you find it fit to accept, you may
justly say I have commanded you, and if you take another course you
cannot expect that I can publicly avow you in it until I shall be
able (which God knows how soon that will be) to stand upon my own
feet; but, on the contrary, seem to be not well satisfied with your
refu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id=

this army upon you&mdash;and then I shall be in a very sad
condition, such as I shall rather leave to your judgment than seek
to express."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id=

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> Aug.-Sept.</div>
<p>The command admitted of no refusal. Seaforth and Huntly were
making their own terms; moreover, the futile Antrim had arrived in
Scotland to assist Alasdair in a private war in Argyll, and was
summoning the Highlanders to follow his own standard.<a name=
"FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Accordingly, towards
the end of July Montrose met Middleton on the banks of the Isla to
arrange terms. Middleton was to stain his later record with many
crimes, but he had some of the instincts of a soldier. He granted
better conditions than might have been looked for. A free pardon
was given to all the royalists except the viceroy, Crawford, and
Sir John Hurry, who, since Kilsyth, had been with Montrose. These
three were to leave the country before the first day of September,
the Estates providing a vessel. All forfeited lands were to be
restored, except in the case of the three excepted, and of Graham
of Gorthie, whose estate was already in the hands of Balcarres.
Montrose accepted the conditions, and, assembling his army on 30th
July at Rattray, near Blairgowrie, bade his men farewell. He told
them that what he did was for the king's sake and by the king's
command. It was a melancholy parting with those Highlanders of
Atholl who had never failed him, and with comrades such as Airlie
and Ogilvy and the young Napier, who, in good and evil report, had
been true to their salt. For such men "passion" was a harder
service than "action."<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id=
"FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class=
"fnanchor">[513]</a></p>
<p>The Committee of Estates did not accept with any graciousness
the terms which Middleton had agreed. They dared not repudiate
their general, for Midd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id=
"Page_313">[313]</a></span>leton was not a man to brook insults,
and his forces, added to Montrose's, might soon be hammering at the
Edinburgh gates. But they did their best to defeat the bargain by
delay. Montrose had received a private letter from the king at
Newcastle, dated the 21st of August, of which the postscript bade
him defer his going beyond seas "as long as you may, without
breaking your word."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id=
"FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class=
"fnanchor">[514]</a> It was a dangerous instruction, but Montrose
accepted it. As the last days of the month approached he grew
suspicious of the Covenant's good faith. There was no sign of the
promised vessel till, on the 31st, a ship put into Montrose harbour
with a sullen master and a more sullen crew. English men-of-war,
too, had appeared off the coast. When Montrose proposed to embark
at once, the skipper declared that he must have time to caulk his
vessel and attend to the rigging.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id=
"FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class=
"fnanchor">[515]</a> This meant that the days of grace would be
exceeded, and the viceroy left stranded, an outlaw at the mercy of
his enemies.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646</i> September</div>
<p>Happily a small Norwegian sloop was in the harbour of
Stonehaven, and its master, one Jens Gunnersen, agreed to sail with
the exiles. Hurry, Wishart, and Drummond of Balloch; Harry Graham,
Montrose's half-brother; John Spottiswoode, one of the nephews whom
old Sir Robert had entrusted to the viceroy's charge; three
soldiers, John Lisle or Lillie, whom we shall meet later at
Carbisdale, Patrick Melvin, and David Guthrie; a Frenchman Lasound,
who had been Lord Gordon's valet; and a young German called Rudolf
made up the little party. The sloop sailed down to <span class=

and his servant put off in a wherry from the shore, and were taken
aboard. The servant was Montrose. "This," says Wishart, "was in the
year of our Lord, 1646, and the thirty-fourth of his age."</p>

<p>For over two years Montrose had been living the life of the
camp, his mind concentrated upon the immediate purpose of winning
battles.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id=

"fnanchor">[517]</a> His main strategical plan of joining hands
with the king on the Border and severing the alliance of the Scots
and the English Parliament had failed through no fault of his, and
the lack of this larger co-operation had nullified his local
victories. But he had not given up hope, even though Charles was a
prisoner. Before he left Scotland he had sent Crawford to the queen
in Paris with a proposal to raise the clans and rescue the king
from his captors.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id=
"FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class=
"fnanchor">[518]</a> He regarded himself as still a serving
soldier, and his survey was narrowed to the field of arms. No more
for him those speculations on the theory of the State, which had
been his earlier interest. The time had gone by for reason and
philosophy; unreason, armed and mailed, had seized the reins of
power, and the philosopher must now be the warrior and appeal to a
harsher arbitrament than dialectic. Some such narrowing of vision
was inevitable. The king was no longer the<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> king of
his discourse on "Sovereign Power," but the master who commanded
his sword, and the kaleidoscopic changes of events and parties in
England he regarded with an eye only to their military reaction.
His life and thought were restricted to a single purpose.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1646-47</i> Sept.-Feb.</div>
<p>After a week's tossing in the North Sea Montrose reached the
Norwegian port of Bergen, where he found a Scot, one Thomas Gray,
in command of the castle. His immediate purpose was to visit
Denmark to meet Christian IV., with whom, as the uncle of Charles,
he might confer on the next step. He had talked for months with
none but rough-handed Scots nobles, and he needed some one with a
wider survey to advise him on the complications of his task. He had
sheathed his sword at his master's bidding, but his life was
dedicated to the cause, and from that devotion there could be no
release but death. So on 15th September the exiles started on the
overland route to Christiania, probably sailing up the Sognefiord
to Leardals&ouml;ren, and then traversing the backbone of mountains by
the Leardal valley and Valders. From the little port of Marstrand
they crossed into Denmark, only to find that King Christian was in
Germany. Montrose passed on to Hamburg, where he spent the winter
waiting for instructions.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1647</i></div>
<p>But no instructions came&mdash;not even his credentials as
ambassador&mdash;extraordinary to France which Charles had promised
him. One letter he had from the king, dated from Newcastle on
January 21, 1647, in which he was referred for orders to the queen;
and one from Henrietta Maria, written from Paris on 5th February,
promising further dispatches, and subscribing herself his "very
good and affectionate cousin and friend."<a name="FNanchor_519_519"
id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class=
"fnanchor">[519]</a> The parasites and adventurers who surrounded
the queen were resolute that Montrose should not break in upon
their follies with his untimely zeal. When, tired of waiting on
orders that did not arrive, he left Hamburg in March, he was met in
Flanders by John Ashburnham with a second letter from Henrietta,
and a suggestion fr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id=
"Page_319">[319]</a></span>om Jermyn that he should return to
Scotland and renew the war. As no reference was made to his own
proposals sent through Crawford, Montrose naturally refused to
engage in an enterprise for which he had no resources and no
warrant from his master. Ashburnham then hinted that he might make
his peace with the Covenanters, following the royal precedent. The
proposal was indignantly rejected. "Not even the king," he said,
"should command his obedience in what was dishonourable, unjust,
and destructive to his Majesty himself."<a name="FNanchor_520_520"

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Queen Henrietta

</div>
<br>
<p>In Paris the queen received him graciously, but, when he
preached the immediate necessity of armed intervention in her
husband's behalf, she made it very clear that his counsels were not
those most grateful to the royal ears. Jermyn and the rest gave him
tepid smiles and the cold shoulder. To one of his temper the
mingled silliness and vice of Henrietta's court must have been in
the extreme repulsive. The king was a captive, the flower of
English and Scottish chivalry had died for his sake, and these
mountebanks were turning life into a thing of backstairs gossip and
idle laughter. There appears to have been a suggestion that his
niece, Lilias Napier, a spirited girl in her teens, should become a
maid of honour, but Montrose sternly forbade it. "There is neither
Scots man nor Scots woman welcome that way; neither would any of
honour and virtue, chiefly a woman, suffer themselves to live in so
lewd and worthless a place."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id=
"FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class=
"fnanchor">[521]</a></p>
<p>But if the tawdry court-in-exile had little to say to him, Paris
made amends. His fame had gone abroad throughout Europe, and the
most distinguished men in France came to pay him their respects. He
was given precedence before the regular ambassadors. De Retz, who
had followed his campaigns with admiration, welcomed him as a Roman
hero reborn in a degenerate world. The great Mazarin offered him
the command of the Scots in F<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>rance, and a
lieutenant-generalship in the French army; then the captaincy of
the Gens d'Armes, with a large pension; and, last, the captaincy of
the king's own guard and the rank of Marshal of France. The young
Napier, who had now joined him, was eager that he should accept. A
dazzling career opened before him, for with his talents in the
field he might look to be a second Cond&eacute;, rich, idolized, the head
of a great army, and not the impoverished captain of a few ragged
exiles. But to enter the French service meant, in common decency,
to give up thoughts of any other, and his sword had been dedicated
and was not his own to sell.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id=
"FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class=
"fnanchor">[522]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile strange things were happening in the country which he
had left. On January 30, 1647, the Scots army, as Montrose had
always anticipated, had handed over the king to the English
Parliament. The carts, laden with the deferred pay of Leven's
soldiers, were soon rumbling over the Border, while the women of
Newcastle were with difficulty prevented from stoning the retiring
troops, and ribald songs were beginning to be sung everywhere in
England and France.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id=
"FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class=
"fnanchor">[523]</a> It is difficult to read the dispatches of
Montreuil and Belli&egrave;vre, and not believe that the Scots had
guaranteed to Charles personal security; their very Covenants bound
them to this, and beyond doubt, when Charles committed himself to
their charge, he believed that with them, even if he did not find
support for his doctrine of government, he would at any rate be
assured of safety. He believed it, and they knew that he believed
it; they seem to have believed it themselves, for there is on
record a declaration of a Commission of the General Assembly that
the Scots did not deliver up the king "until sufficient surety was
given by both Houses of Parliament ensuring the safety and the
preservation of his Majesty's person." Such a guarante<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>e,
implied and explicit, was broken by his transference to other
hands. But it is no less certain that the consideration for the
bargain was not the money. Had Charles complied with their
conditions about Presbytery, they would gladly have forfeited the
arrears of the English payments and defied English Parliament and
English army. They sold their king indeed, but it was for a
different price, and one which was never paid&mdash;the
enforcement, urged by some on prudential and by others on mystical
grounds, of an alien church polity which was rapidly becoming
anathema to the English nation.</p>
<p>The transference of the king was the defeat of Presbyterianism
south of the Border; thenceforth the struggle was of Royalist and
Independent. The division between Scotland and England became
sharper; monarchy and intolerance were arrayed against
republicanism and toleration. In June Charles passed from the
Parliament into the charge of Cromwell's army, and on his way south
he wrote to Montrose from Newmarket, bidding him again take
instructions from Henrietta, and thanking him for the present of a
sword.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> It was a strange
gift to one whose career in the field was closed for ever. But the
doings of Cornet Joyce had alarmed the more moderate of the
Covenanters, and that party began to reveal the characteristic of
all factions, and split in two. There had been much divided opinion
about the transactions of the preceding January; there was now no
dominant party in England to which the Covenanters as a body could
adhere; English dislike of them was returned with interest; they
regarded the sectaries and their gospel of toleration with scarcely
more love than they regarded episcopacy and royalism. Hamilton was
back in Scotland, and was busy making a party of those who favoured
the Covenant but did not favour Cromwell, and professed devotion to
the principle of monarchy. In November Charles escaped to
Carisbrooke castle, in the Isle of Wight&mdash;a mere change of
prison; and there, on 27th December, he entered into a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>secret
engagement, with Lanark, Loudoun, and Lauderdale as signatories.
The scheme was doomed from the start, both by its terms and the
character of its promoters. They combined these incompatibles, the
king and the Solemn League; their royalism offended the
Independents, their Covenant alienated the royalists, and they had
nothing wherewith to attract any substantial English following.
They had not even a creed to unite Scotland. They strove for
nothing which had any real meaning. There was no half-way house
between Montrose and Argyll.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Estates, when they assembled in March 1648,
gave the Engagers a large majority, and sanctioned the raising of
an army to rescue the king from that captivity into which a year
before they had sold him. Argyll went into opposition, as well he
might. Apart from his dislike of the Hamiltons, who sponsored the
Engagement, a man of his acumen realized that out of such a medley
of half-hearted blunderers there could only come disaster. Robert
Baillie, who was against the Engagement, yet deplored the
intransigence of the leaders of the Kirk and his own party, was
moved to write almost in Montrose's words: "I am more and more in
the mind that it were for the good of the world that churchmen did
meddle with ecclesiastical affairs only; that, were they never so
able otherwise, they are unhappy statesmen; that, as Erastian
C&aelig;saro-Papism is hurtful to the Church, so an Episcopal
Papa-C&aelig;sarism is unfortunate for the State. If no man were wiser
than I am, we should not make so many scruples to settle the throne
and pull down the sectaries."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id=
"FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class=
"fnanchor">[525]</a></p>
<p>One of the first steps which the Engagers took was to
communicate with Henrietta and the Prince of Wales in Paris. The
queen did not inform Montrose of their proposals till she had made
up her mind to accept them and had already committed herself. He
knew too much of Hamilton to look for great things in that quarter,
but he offered to do all in his power to save the situation
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id=
"Page_323">[323]</a></span> enlisting under his own banner those
royalists who would enlist under no other, and by supporting the
Engagers in the field. Hamilton's envoys, however, had warned the
queen that Montrose must have no share in the business, and his
offer was coldly declined. In despair he looked elsewhere for a
sphere of action where he could further his master's interests and
raise troops for his service. Mazarin and his colleagues were
half-hearted in Charles's cause, and too cordial in their treatment
of the English Parliament. So at the end of March 1648 he slipped
away from Paris with some of his friends, and travelled by Genoa
and Tyrol to the Emperor's court at Vienna.<a name=

<p>Wishart's account in Latin of the <i>annus mirabilis</i> of
1644-45 had been published in Holland towards the close of 1647,
and had leaped at once into a wide popularity.<a name=
"FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> The doings of the
Scottish soldier were the talk of every camp and city in Europe,
and at the imperial court Montrose found himself welcomed as a
hero. The Emperor Ferdinand IV., whom he found at Prague, gave him
the crimson baton of a Marshal of the Empire, and empo<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>wered
him to raise troops in any quarter of his dominions. The Emperor's
brother and successor, the Archduke Leopold, was Governor of the
Spanish Netherlands, and Montrose was advised that the western
border of the empire was the place for his purpose. It had the
further merit of being nearer Britain in case of a summons from
home. Germany was too much harassed by war to make easy travelling,
so Montrose returned by Cracow and Dantzig to Denmark, and thence
by way of Groningen to Brussels. He found the archduke at Tournai,
but it was his fate to look for help from those who at the moment
had none to give. As he had met Rupert on the morrow of Marston
Moor, so he found Leopold on the morrow of Lens, where, on the 20th
of August, the genius of Cond&eacute; had scattered the imperial
troops.</p>
<p>He accordingly returned to Brussels, where he received startling
news from Scotland. To the bulk of the English royalists the
Engagement made no appeal, since it contained "so many monstrous
concessions that, except the whole Kingdom of England had been
likewise imprisoned in Carisbrooke Castle with the king, it could
not be imagined that it was possible to be performed."<a name=
"FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Scotland was wildly
divided. The great bulk of the ministers were opposed to it, for
though they liked the English sectaries little they liked the king
less; the pulpits rang with denunciations, and in May there was an
armed rising at Mauchline, in Ayrshire, which was with difficulty
suppressed by Middleton and Callander. Argyll, Eglinton, Balmerino,
Elcho, Cassilis, and Balcarres, the leaders of the opposition, were
joined by Loudoun the Chancellor, who suddenly turned his coat. The
Engagers were in desperate straits for money, and in still more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id=
"Page_325">[325]</a></span>desperate straits for leaders, for David
Leslie belonged to the other faction. Hamilton, who had not a
vestige of military talent, was their commander-in-chief, with
Callander, who was no more than a disciplinarian, as his
second-in-command; Middleton, his master of horse, was the only
able soldier.</p>
<p>Leaving their enemies mustering behind them, the Engagers
crossed the Border on 8th July, with Sir Marmaduke Langdale as
their solitary English ally, and their only appeal to the English
people their proposals to free the king, disband the Parliament
army, and restore the Covenant. Lanark would have liked to take
order with Argyll and the ministers before leaving Scotland<a name=
"FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>&mdash;the wiser
plan; but indeed the wisdom of any plan signified little under such
generalship as Hamilton's. He had 10,500 men, Langdale had nearly
3,000, and Sir George Monro joined him at Kendal with part of the
Scots army from Ireland. The history of the disastrous march may be
read in Clarendon and Burnet and the memoirs of Sir James Turner.
The Scottish forces were under no central command, and their
division was their undoing. Lambert was waiting for them in
Yorkshire, and Cromwell joined him on 13th August. On the 17th
Callander and Middleton, with the cavalry, were as far south as
Wigan; Hamilton was at Preston, about to cross the Ribble, with
Langdale behind him, while Monro was far behind with Musgrave in
the north. Cromwell, having made, in Montrose's fashion, a swift
flank march over the Lancashire hills, fell upon the centre at
Preston&mdash;it was "St. Covenant's Day," the anniversary of the
signing of the Solemn League&mdash;routed it and cut the army in
two. The dismembered van dribbled south, Baillie with 4,000 foot
surrendering at Warrington bridge, and Hamilton with the cavalry at
Uttoxeter.</p>
<p>During the next weeks Scotland was in dire confusion. Eglinton
and Loudoun organized the Whigamore Raid of west-country peasants,
which occupied Edinburgh. Monro almost captured Argyll at Stirling,
and Lanark, with Monro's aid, could no doubt have destroyed the
W<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id=
"Page_326">[326]</a></span>higamores, had not his colleagues
overruled him. The Estates capitulated on shameful terms to the
Kirk. On 21st September Cromwell crossed the Tweed and met Argyll,
and on 4th October was in Edinburgh. He stayed in Lord Moray's
house in the Canongate, dined with Argyll and Wariston, and met the
leading ministers like Blair, Dickson, and Guthrie. Of the nobles
he wrote that "he found nothing in them other than what became
Christians and men of honour."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id=
"FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class=
"fnanchor">[530]</a> Mr. Blair thought him "an egregious
dissembler, a great liar . . . and a greeting deevil."<a name=
"FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Argyll, as usual,
was right in his diagnosis. With his keen eye for political values
he had attached himself to the strongest force of the day. But he
cannot have thought hopefully of the future, for the extremists of
the Kirk, to whom both by conviction and policy he was bound, held
no single article of Cromwell's creed except his distrust of the
king, and they had rejected the only help which could enable them
to stand against him. He must have felt the foundations cracking
under his feet. He had begun that half-hearted alliance with Oliver
which was to bring him to the scaffold.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1648-49</i></div>
<p>The news from home revived in Montrose the old eagerness to
strike another blow for the king. He had appealed in vain to the
queen and her circle; he was excluded from the dreary and futile
schemes of the Engagers; he had failed with middle age, and during
the winter of 1648, in Brussels, he tried an appeal to youth. He
wrote to the Prince of Wales, to the Duke of York, and to Prince
Rupert&mdash;repeatedly to the last, whose temper resembled his own
in so far as its besetting sin was not supineness. Rupert was now
at Helvoetsluys in charge of the small royalist fleet, much beset
by the Parliamentary ships of war under Lord Warwick, and in
constant difficulty from mutinous crews and short supplies.<a name=
"FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> On 7th September
Montrose wrote to him:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id=
"Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"When your Highness shall be pleased to know that I was ever a
silent admirer of you, and a passionate affecter of your person and
all your ways, you will be pleased to allow me recourse to your
goodness and generosity. And the rather that your Highness sees I
am for the present at such distance with all interests, as no end
but naked respect can now prompt me to it; which, if your Highness
shall do me the honour to take in good part, and command me to
continue, I shall hope it will not wrong the king your uncle's
service, nor what may touch your Highness both in relation to those
and these parts, in either of which I should presume to be able to
do you some small services."</p>
</div>
<p>Rupert replied affectionately, and the stately and involved
correspondence continued till January 1649. A meeting was
constantly discussed, but Rupert could not leave the fleet and come
to Brussels, and Montrose could hardly venture to that nest of
spies, the Hague. The latter's purpose is clear. He wanted Rupert
to take the fleet to Scotland, and he did not want him to involve
himself in Lauderdale's toils.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Since there be so handsome and probable grounds for a clear and
gallant design if the measures be rightly taken, I should be
infinitely sorry that your Highness should be induced to hazard
your own person, or these little rests (remnants) upon any
desperate thrust."</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> January</div>
<p>It does not appear that a meeting ever took place, and in
January 1649, after refitting by the sale of his sister's jewels,
Rupert took the fleet to join Ormonde in Ireland.<a name=
"FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>
<p>Hitherto there had been no word from the Prince of Wales; he and
his mother had still hopes of the Engagers, and feared to offend
them by any intercourse with their deadly enemy. Presently,
however, the young Charles emancipated himself from the queen and
her set, and took up his residence with Hyde at the Hague. Montrose
had friends who had the prince's ear, and in January 1649 he
received a message from him, bidding him arrange with Hyde for a
secret interview. The prince <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>had entered upon the
policy of keeping two strings to his bow. While holding the
Engagers in play, he wished to have Montrose as a last resort; but,
as the insistence upon secrecy shows, he was anxious to make the
former believe that he looked only to them. Montrose replied that
he would joyfully obey the summons, but implored the prince to
distinguish true loyalty from false. "If your Highness shall but
vouchsafe a little faith unto your loyal servants, and stand at
guard with others, your affairs can soon be whole."<a name=
"FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>
<p>He wrote also: "I never had passion upon earth so strong as to
do the king, your father, service." This was on the 28th of
January. Two days later, on a snowy afternoon, on a scaffold in
Whitehall, that king "not cowardly" put off his armour.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> February</div>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>From the day when he heard from Hyde the news of the tragedy,
almost to the close of his life, a strange oppression settled upon
Montrose. A sense of dark and menacing fate hung like a cloud about
him. He had been no sentimental cavalier; he did not believe in
Divine Right; to him the Lord's Anointed had never had the sanctity
which he possessed for many royalists. But out of his inner soul he
had created the image of an ideal monarch, wise with a wisdom to
which no earthly king has attained, a personification of the dreams
which had always haunted him. He had, too, the devotion of a loyal
soldier to the master for whom he had risked so much. But, more
than all, he saw in the tragedy the darkening of the skies over his
own unhappy land. The savage and stupid barbarism of the Covenant,
which had revelled in blood in the Lord's name, now seemed at last
to have reached omnipotence, for it had destroyed the centre of all
civil order. Henceforth there could be no compromise. He knew
nothing of the folly and duplicity which preceded Charles's
ultimate her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id=
"Page_329">[329]</a></span>oism; his rejection of compromises which
would have secured to him all that was worthy in his cause; his
futile search for allies who were alike perjured and impotent, and
his double-dealing towards those who had on their side both honesty
and power. He saw only the shedding of innocent blood, which must
make a breach for all time between those who loved righteousness
and those who pursued iniquity. When he heard the news he fainted
among his friends. For two days he kept his chamber, and when
Wishart entered he found on the table these lines:</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"Great, good, and just, could I but rate<br>
&nbsp;My grief, and thy too rigid fate,<br>
&nbsp;I'd weep the world in such a strain<br>
&nbsp;As it should deluge once again.<br>
&nbsp;But since thy loud-tongued blood demands supplies<br>
&nbsp;More from Briareus' hands than Argus' eyes,<br>
&nbsp;I'll sing thine obsequies with trumpet sounds,<br>
&nbsp;And write thine epitaph in blood and wounds."</p>
<br>
<p>From this moment there is an uncanniness about him, as of one
who lives half his time in another world. He has himself painted in
coal-black armour; his eyes have a fire which changes their cool
greyness into something wilder and fiercer; all youthful weaknesses
seem purged away&mdash;his pride, his intolerance, his
condescension&mdash;for his patience becomes unearthly, and his
gentleness unhuman. He has the air of a "fey" man, for whom the
barriers between the seen and the unseen are breaking down.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> March</div>
<p>In the middle of February he met Hyde at Sevenbergen. Hyde never
liked him as Nicholas and Hopton and Digby did, and in the writings
of the future Lord Clarendon admiration is always tinged with acid.
But he was a loyal servant of the new king, and he recognized
capacity when he saw it; to him Montrose was the man of the
"clearest spirit and honour" among the king's advisers, and to be
preferred "before any other of that nation."<a name=
"FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Montrose proposed an
immediate expedition to Scotland, but Hyde urged delay, and begged
him not to show himself as yet publicly at the king's court.
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id=
"Page_330">[330]</a></span> when the former heard that the
commissioners from Scotland were at the Hague, he insisted on
presenting himself at once to the king.<a name="FNanchor_536_536"
id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class=
"fnanchor">[536]</a> He found the young Charles already in the
thick of Scottish intrigues, for the immediate result of the king's
death had been to send a wave of loyalty over that distracted land.
On the 4th of February Charles the Second was proclaimed at the
market-cross of Edinburgh by Loudoun the Chancellor. As we have
seen, there had always been an odd royalism flickering through the
nation, often in the most unlikely places; the king was a poor
thing, but their own, like the misguided Covenant; it might be well
for his own people, the Scots, to take order with him, but it was
high treason in those who hated Scotland as much as they hated
Charles. The feeling was of a piece with the later Jacobitism, an
assertion of nationality on the part of a small, proud, bitterly
poor country, jealous of her rich neighbour, not yet confident in
herself. It was sentimental, not reasoned, and was found even among
the extreme Covenanters. Mr. Robert Blair of St. Andrews was
anxious to attend Charles on the scaffold. "He made his account to
die with the king, and would as willingly have laid down his head
to the hatchet as ever he laid his head to a pillow."<a name=
"FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> In November 1650 we
find Mr. Robert Baillie writing to Mr. David Dickson: "If my lord
Argyll at this strait should desert the king . . . I think, and
many more with me of the best I speak with, that it would be a
fearful sin in him, which God will revenge."<a name=
"FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> No doubt in
ministerial breasts loyalty was intertwined with the Covenant, but
it was loyalty of a kind. Hamilton's death on the scaffold in
March<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> intensified the
feeling of national resentment which Preston had kindled. The
luckless duke was not a brilliant figure. His epitaph has been
spoken by Alison Wilson in <i>Old Mortality</i>: "That was him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id=
"Page_331">[331]</a></span>that lost his head at London. Folks said
that it wasna a very guid ane, but it was aye a sair loss to him,
puir gentleman." It had been prophesied&mdash;and the prophecy had
hag-ridden his mind&mdash;that he would succeed the king; but he
fell heir not to a throne, but to a scaffold.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> March-June</div>
<p>Montrose, watching Scotland from a distance, may well have
believed that the aspect of affairs was more promising than ever
before. There were, indeed, no Gordons to appeal to. Huntly had at
last fallen into his enemy's hands, and his "bustling in the
north," as Sir James Turner called his vagrant activity, was over
for ever. On 23rd March he was beheaded in Edinburgh, lamenting
pathetically that he had done so little for the cause he died for,
and stoutly refusing to be released from the excommunication of the
Kirk, which could not affect him where he was going.<a name=
"FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Aboyne was in exile,
dying of a broken heart, and the Gordon lands were in the power of
Lord Lewis, who was soon to make his peace with his uncle. But the
great northern clan of Mackenzie was hopeful. Its chief, Seaforth,
had arrived at the exiled court, and his brother, Mackenzie of
Pluscardine, had raised his clan in March, and along with Reay and
Ogilvy had taken Inverness and given much trouble to David Leslie.
They were soon to be scattered, but the hope of the Mackenzies
remained. Moreover, the Covenanters could not long maintain peace
with the English Parliament, or Argyll continue his pact with
Cromwell, since they stood for monarchy and the Covenant, while
Cromwell would have none of either. In such a quarrel honesty might
come by its own. During the next few months the Hague was the
battlefield of contending factions. There were three parties in
Scottish politics: the rigid Covenanters with Argyll at their head,
who were prepared to accept Charles if he woul<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>d accept
the Solemn League and Covenant and agree to the imposition of
Presbytery on England; the Engagers, whose emissaries in Holland
were Lanark and Lauderdale, and who had similar principles, but
proposed to apply them more laxly;<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id=
"FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class=
"fnanchor">[541]</a> and the royalists <i>sans phrase</i>, like
Montrose, Kinnoull, Sinclair, and Napier, who were wholly against a
Covenant which would make co-operation with the English loyalists
impossible. In March the envoys of the Estates arrived, among them
Cassilis and Mr. Robert Baillie, who, with many protestations of
loyalty, demanded as the price of kingship the Covenant in all its
rigidity and the repudiation of all excommunicated persons,
"especially James Graham, a man most justly . . . cast out of the
Church of God . . . upon whose head lies more innocent blood than
for many years hath done on the head of any one, the most bloody
murtherer in our nation."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id=
"FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class=
"fnanchor">[542]</a></p>
<p>It is not easy to see exactly what Argyll would have been at. He
was a realist in politics, and not a dreamer, but it would appear
that he was losing his sense of reality. The king's execution had
broken his alliance with Cromwell; his desire was for the
establishment of Presbytery in both nations, but his speech in the
House of Lords on June 25, 1646,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id=
"FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class=
"fnanchor">[543]</a> showed that he was prepared to advocate an
elastic Presbytery with toleration for other sects; on such a
programme he might have secured most of the Engagers, and
considerable English support. But to return to the extreme
Presbyterian claims, to demand a subscription from the king which
must involve the sin of perjury, to refuse all alliance except with
those of the same narrow creed, was to make Cromwell's triumph as
certain as the rising of the sun. He was opposed to a great soldier
with a powerful army, and he began by depriving himself of the best
natural fighting material in Scotland&mdash;the clans&mdash;and the
only generalship of the first order&mdash;Montrose's. Moreover, a
united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id=
"Page_333">[333]</a></span> England and Scotland had always been
one of his worthiest policies, and this intransigence was to make
the fissure a gulf. The conditions which he would impose on the
king brought on him the hostility of most loyalists; his fidelity
to monarchy set him in opposition to Cromwell and the Independents;
his insistence upon the most intolerant Scots type of Presbytery
marshalled against him the whole of England. It is impossible to
resist the conclusion that from henceforth this adroit politician
is losing his grip. He ceased to be a realist, and fell back upon
the deepest strain in his nature&mdash;the religious enthusiasm
which he had acquired long before at the Glasgow Assembly; and
this, shot with flickering lights of irrelevant worldly wisdom,
remained his mood till his death. "My thought," he wrote of this
period to his son, "became distracted, and myself encountered so
many difficulties in the way, that all remedies that were applied
had the quite contrary operation. Whatever, therefore, hath been
said by me or others in this matter, you must refute and accept
them as from a distracted man of a distracted subject in the
distracted time wherein I lived."<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id=
"FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class=
"fnanchor">[544]</a></p>
<p>The Engagers were more politic, and pressed their demands more
modestly, but in substance they asked for the same thing. Lanark,
indeed, in his first zeal after Preston, was prepared to "join with
the lord Marquis of Montrose and all the king's party," and was "so
far from contesting about command, that he would be a serjeant
under Montrose."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id=
"FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class=
"fnanchor">[545]</a> But as Duke of Hamilton in his brother's
stead, he fell into timider courses; if Charles was to become king
it was necessary to unite Scotland, and Montrose was a perilous
bone of contention. As for Lauderdale, his pure soul had been
shocked (so he said) by Montrose's barbarities, though, on
cross-examination by Hyde, he was unable to give an instance of any
slaughter "but what was done in the field." The man whose foul
table-talk was the byword of the Restoration court, and sickened
even the kin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id=
"Page_334">[334]</a></span>g, was an odd censor of morals. There is
a picture by Cornelius Janssen in which Hamilton and Lauderdale are
portrayed side by side, a scroll passing between them, and in the
dark, uncertain features of the one and the gross, gobbling mouth
and cunning eyes of the other may be read all the weakness of the
Engagement.</p>
<p>It was Montrose who was now the realist. He desired a policy
which would attract the maximum support in the two
kingdoms&mdash;the restoration of monarchy on constitutional lines,
with freedom secured to each country for the kind of church it
favoured. Charles demanded an opinion from both the royalists and
the Engagers as to the conditions of the Estates. Montrose's reply
is still extant, and differs from the other remonstrances and
declarations through which he had already published his faith to
the world only in that it is directed to a narrower issue.<a name=
"FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> It traced the
history of the Covenant movement from its justifiable beginnings to
its impossible end; it pointed out that the Covenanters required
from the king a renunciation of his own private form of worship,
"and yet they made it a ground of rebellion against your royal
father that they but imagined he intended to meddle with them after
the like kind." The document was read in Charles's council on the
21st of May, the terms of the Estates were refused, and Montrose
was confirmed in his vice-royalty and appointed admiral of the
Scottish seas.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> June</div>
<p>Apparently the king had made up his mind. He had rejected Argyll
and, having accepted Montrose, had also rejected the Engagers. He
stood committed now to some such bold attempt as his
captain-general had always urged. He wrote to Montrose from Breda
on 22nd June that he would come to no decision touching the affairs
of Scotland without consulting him, and the Duke of York a month
later wrote to congratulate him on his new "occasion of
employment."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id=
"FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class=
"fnanchor">[547]</a> At that time the plan was for the king to go
to Ireland and establish there his principal base, but Cromwell's
expedition in August caused its relinquishment.<a name=

during the whole of the winter 1649-50 there lay a sovran chance of
organizing the former country for the king. Montrose had wished the
king to join him there, but he had acquiesced in the Irish
alternative, for his one fear was that Charles should go to
Scotland in bond to the Covenant. But already Charles had begun to
regard the Scottish expedition with uncertain eyes. He favoured it
chiefly that he might have another asset in bargaining with the
Estates. In the wars of the Middle Ages both sides on the eve of
peace endeavoured to take as many fortresses as possible in order
to have something to give up when the day of renunciation came; and
so it was with Charles now. The intrigues with Covenanters and
Engagers still went on, though the scene was moved to Paris and the
court of Henrietta. Jermyn seems to have patched up a friendship
with the new Hamilton, and attempted to get Montrose's commission
as viceroy annulled in his favour. "They are all mad, or worse,"
was the judgment of Elizabeth of Bohemia on that nest of futile and
selfish schemers.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<p>Montrose, at the Hague, made a new friend, and while following
Charles that summer to Breda and Brussels, and when, later in the
autumn, he was recruiting among the countries of northern Europe,
he had a correspondent who kept a jealous eye on his interests. In
his youth sentimental girls had written him love-letters; his
marriage had been a love-match; but since he had been compelled to
serve a new mistress, "the first foe in the field," no woman had
played a part in his life. The lady who now entered it was the most
celebrated in Europe. Elizabeth of the Palatine, for some brief
winter months Queen of Bohemia, had the strange compelling power of
her grandmother, Mary of Scots, over the hearts of men. As a girl
she had bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id=
"Page_336">[336]</a></span>n the idol of her country, for she had
the fire and brilliance and endearing simplicity of her brother
Henry. Her wedding to the Prince Palatine had set all England
junketing for weeks. Then came the disastrous episode of the
Bohemian throne, the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, the loss
of both Bohemia and the Palatine, her husband's death, and the
squalor of a court in exile, dependent upon foreign bounty. But
misfortune, no more than age, could dim her charm. When Montrose
first met her she was in her early fifties, as we see her in the
portraits by Honthorst and Miereveldt&mdash;a woman who had left
youth behind her, one who had known the whole range of mortal joys
and sorrows, with a mouth a little narrowed by pain and
disappointment, but with great brown eyes still full of the hunger
of life. Few crossed her path but were beguiled, and either became
her devotees and the sharers in her broken fortunes, or to their
dying day cherished the memory of her as if in a shrine. Zachary
Boyd, in far-off Glasgow, came under a spell which is patent even
in his halting verses. Donne sent her his sermons and his prayers.
To the staid Sir Henry Wotton she was "the eclipse and glory of her
kind," and he wrote in anguish, "Shall I die without seeing again
my royal mistress?"</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"You meaner beauties of the night,<br>
That poorly satisfy our eyes<br>
&nbsp;More by your number than your light,<br>
You common people of the skies,<br>
What are you when the moon shall rise?"</p>
<br>
<p>Was ever woman praised more nobly? But the glamour fell on
others than the poets. "I see it is not good to be my friend," she
once wrote, and indeed a following so loyal could not but suffer in
a cause so calamitous. But for Elizabeth's sake men forgot worldly
wisdom, and were back in the high days of chivalry. There were the
young gentlemen of the Middle Temple, who kissed a sword and swore
a solemn oath to live and die in her service. There was Sir Ralph
Hopton, who, fresh from Oxford, accompanied her in the flight from
Pr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id=
"Page_337">[337]</a></span>ague; and Conway, and Lord Carlisle, and
Sir Dudley Carleton, and Lord Cromwell, and Sir Thomas Roe, and
Christian of Brunswick. Soldiers, courtiers, ambassadors, bravos,
each subscribed himself, like Christian, "your most humblest, most
constant, most faithful, most affectionate, and most obedient
slave, who loves you and will love you, infinitely and incessantly
to death." And there was Lord Craven, who laid his great fortune at
her feet, and lived only to serve her.</p>
<p>What was there in Elizabeth to draw forth this wealth of love?
Reckless, extravagant, exacting, perhaps a little heartless, there
was about her a kind of stellar greatness, a spirit that could not
be soiled or subdued by fate. Like Constance, she had "instructed
her sorrows to be proud," but it was a laughing pride which
endeared as well as awed. "Though I have cause enough to be sad,"
she wrote to Sir Thomas Roe, "yet I am still of my wild humour to
be as merry as I can in spite of fortune." She was a better friend
than a mother, for her daughter Sophia declared that her monkeys
and her dogs came before her children. The buffets of the world had
a little calloused her. But her flawless courage remained, her
winning humour, her subtlety, her abounding zest for life.</p>
<p>Montrose was a soldier after her own heart, and to him the
mother of Rupert and Maurice was a joy in that rabble of
half-hearted casuists. Her little sheaf of letters to him during
these months shows how gracious an interlude their friendship was.
She rallies the grave cavalier, and gives him the news of the court
from the point of view of an ardent well-wisher. The Prince of
Orange is against him, the Princess for him. "For God's sake leave
not the king so long as he is at Breda, for without question there
is nothing that will be omitted to ruin you and your friends." It
was at her request that he sat for the splendid Honthorst portrait,
which she hung in her cabinet that it might "frighten away the
Brethren." She is full of nicknames: Seaforth is "my Highlander,"
Montrose himself, "Jamie Graham." She commends recruits for his
service, she invites h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id=
"Page_338">[338]</a></span>im to Rhenen, her country house, to
shoot at the butts with Kinnoull and exhibit his old undergraduate
prowess; she sends him gossip to amuse him, and wild rumours from
England. She tells him that "old Brainford" (Lord Brentford, who
had once been Patrick Ruthven) was constant to him&mdash;"he says
he is now too old to be a knave, having been honest ever"; no doubt
he was honest, but he was rarely sober. And in every letter she
sends fervent prayers for his success, and in the last for his
"safety in Scotland."<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id=

<p>The bankrupt Palatines, men and women, were for a little the
most dazzling things in Europe. Of the four daughters, Elizabeth,
the handsome bluestocking and friend of Leibniz, died a spinster;
the pink and white Henrietta married the Prince of Transylvania;
Sophia espoused the Elector of Hanover, and became the ancestress
of the royal house of Britain; Louise, charming, kind, ill-dressed,
artistic, turned Catholic and died in extreme old age as abbess of
Maubuisson. In the lively pages of Sophia's memoirs there is a
story of a projected marriage between Montrose and the last
princess, but it may be dismissed as an idle tale.<a name=
"FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> Aug.-Sept.</div>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>The preparations for the Scottish campaign began in June.
Charles had promised that he would do nothing in any of his
negotiations to prejudice Montrose's commission as viceroy, and he
had further nominated him his ambassador to the northern courts.
Recruits there were in plenty, so far as officers were
concerned&mdash;Scots mercenaries who had fought in the German wars
and were only too anxious to find new employment; Scots patriots,
such as Gustavus's old colonel, John Gordon, who were eager to
strike a blow for their country.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id=
"FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class=

allies, and the murder of the Commonwealth envoy,<span class=

Dorislaus, at the Hague on 3rd May, did not lessen the difficulties

"FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class=
"fnanchor">[552]</a> But foreign troops and foreign money were also
necessary, and to secure these Montrose sent his emissaries far and
wide. His half-brother, Harry Graham, was dispatched to the Elector
of Brandenburg, and got the promise of a large sum, which was never
paid. In August Kinnoull, with 80 officers and 100 Danish recruits,
set sail for the Orkneys in an ancient patched-up vessel, and after
much trouble with tempests and Parliamentary frigates, arrived at
Kirkwall in September.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id=
"FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class=
"fnanchor">[553]</a> The reason for the choice of such a base is
clear. The islanders were strangers to the religious strife of the
mainland, and Lord Morton, their feudal superior, was Kinnoull's
uncle, and well disposed to the royalist cause. The Commonwealth
navy, occupied with preventing Rupert's escape from Ireland, was
less likely to interfere with the transports if their route lay so
far to the north. Further, the parts of Scotland adjoining were
close to the Mackay and Mackenzie country, and Montrose looked for
support from both clans. If he could command the northern apex of
Scotland, then Leslie, to meet him, would have to march through the
hostile hill country, and in the event of a royalist victory the
central Highlands would rise to a man.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> Sept.-Nov.</div>
<p>Montrose himself arrived at Hamburg early in September. Here he
negotiated for supplies with the Duke of Courland, and presently
set off to Schleswig to meet Frederick, the new King of Denmark. He
lingered for some time at Copenhagen, for this diplomacy was a slow
business, and thence he dispatched letters to Rupert and Ormonde in
Ireland, and to his friends in Scotland, which latter epistles were
captured by the Estates. There, too, he had news of Kinnoull's
successful lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id=
"Page_340">[340]</a></span>ding. Morton had welcomed him with open
arms, and all was going well for the cause. The common people of
Scotland, so Kinnoull reported, were on the eve of revolt against
their masters. "Your lordship is gaped after with that expectation
that the Jews had for their Messiah, and certainly your presence
will restore your groaning country to its liberties and the king to
his rights."<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id=
"FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class=
"fnanchor">[554]</a> But he had other news less pleasing. Charles
wrote from St. Germains on 19th September:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I entreat you to go on vigorously, and with your wonted courage
and care, in the preservation of those trusts I have committed to
you, and not to be startled with any reports you may hear, as if I
were otherwise inclined to the Presbyterians than when I left you.
I assure you I am upon the same principles I was, and depend as
much as ever upon your undertakings and endeavours for my service,
being fully resolved to assist and support you therein to the
uttermost of my power."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id=
"FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class=
"fnanchor">[555]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This was ominous. Henrietta was at St. Germains, and Montrose
knew too well her notion of policy.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> November</div>
<p>Early in November, finding it impossible to do much with
Frederick, he passed over to Gothenburg in Sweden. The port was
full of long-settled Scots merchants, and one, John Maclear, put
his house and his wealth at his disposal. Montrose's chief fear was
that the reports of a treaty with the Covenant, at which Charles
had hinted in his letter, would utterly dishearten the Scottish
loyalists, and to counteract such a danger he issued what he had
prepared some months before, the last and most famous of his
declarations.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id=
"FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class=
"fnanchor">[556]</a> The document is inspired by his old
unhesitating courage. Montrose is as confident of the sacredness of
his mission as any Covenant minister. He begins with a pertinent
quotati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id=
"Page_341">[341]</a></span>on from Tacitus; he indicts the
Covenanters alike on their past and present policy; he offers in
the king's name pardon to all except proven regicides, and in a
noble ending he summons all true Scottish hearts to make a last
effort for freedom:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Resolving, with Joab, to play the man for their people and the
cities of their God, and let the Lord do whatever seemeth Him good;
wherein, whatsomever shall behappen, they may at least be assured
of Crastinus's recompense that, dead or alive, the world will give
them thanks."</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1649</i> Nov.-Dec.</div>
<p>The declaration was circulated in Edinburgh in December, and, on
the second day of the new year, Wariston issued the reply of the
Estates, in which it was ordered to be burned by the hangman and
its author denounced as "that viperous brood of Satan, whom the
Estates of Parliament have long since declared traitor, the Church
hath delivered into the hands of the devil, and the nation doth
generally abhor."</p>
<p>Christina of Sweden, Gustavus's daughter and Descartes's erratic
disciple, was no more inclined than her neighbour of Denmark to
support publicly the royalist cause. She could not afford to
risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id=
"Page_342">[342]</a></span> the displeasure of a great sea-power
like England. It was from northern Europe that the Commonwealth
looked for the expected invasion, and every port was full of its
spies.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> The most she could
do was to wink at his presence in Gothenburg and permit him to buy
war stores. This was his chief task during December, and it is one
of history's ironies that certain supplies of powder and shot,
which he did not take with him to Scotland, were afterwards used by
the Covenanters against Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id=
"FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class=
"fnanchor">[558]</a> Early in that month a ship arrived from the
Orkneys with melancholy news. David Leslie had marched north to
Caithness in the end of October, and had written to Kinnoull
advising him to depart while there was yet time. The letter was
ordered to be burned by the hangman, and Leslie went south without
crossing the Pentland Firth.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id=
"FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class=
"fnanchor">[559]</a> But on the 12th of November the loyal Morton
died, and a few days later Kinnoull fell sick of pleurisy and
followed him to the grave. The loss of his friend and "passionate
servant" was a heavy blow to Montrose. But Sir James Douglas,
Morton's brother, who arrived in the Orkney sloop, brought good
news of the general feeling in Scotland. He implored the viceroy to
sail at once, for "his own presence was able to do the business,
and would undoubtedly bring 20,000 men together for the king's
service, all men being weary and impatient to live any longer under
that bondage, pressing down their estates, their persons, and their
consciences."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id=
"FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class=
"fnanchor">[560]</a> Montrose may well have believed a report so
consonant with his desires. His ardour was always prone to make
light of difficulties, and he had no wise old Napier to remind him
that the feelings of Sir James Douglas and his friends were
scarcely an index to the temper of burgesses and peasants, wearied
out with poverty and the terrors of an Old Testament
God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1649-50</i> Dec.-March</div>
<p>In December he made an effort to leave. Transports were indeed
dispatched with Danish troops and Scottish officers, as well as
ammunition and stands of arms, and the wild weather they
encountered gave rise to tales of shipwreck which gladdened the
heart of the Estates. He wrote to Seaforth on the 15th of December
saying that he meant to sail for Scotland next day. But the winds
were contrary, and floating ice blocked the harbour, and it was not
till January 10, 1650, that he actually embarked in the
<i>Herderinnen</i> ("Shepherdess"), a frigate which Maclear had
bought for him from the Swedish Admiralty. Still he did not start,
and on the 18th we find him living in Maclear's house on shore. We
know now the reason of that delay which so puzzled the Swedish
statesmen and the spies of the Commonwealth. He had received word
that a dispatch was coming to him from the king in Jersey. For such
a message he could not choose but wait.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1650</i> March</div>
<p>But at that season of the year, in those northern waters,
communications were uncertain, and Montrose had to leave Gothenburg
without the royal letter. The <i>Herderinnen</i>, with stores and
guns, sailed at the beginning of March, and he crossed the snowy
backbone of mountain that separates Sweden from Norway, and joined
her at Bergen. The Commonwealth agents reported him there on 14th
March, waiting to collect various officers, who were immobilized by
lack of passage money at Hamburg or Bremen.<a name=
"FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Harry May, the
king's messenger, had to follow the viceroy to Kirkwall in the
Orkneys, where he delivered the king's letter on the 23rd of March.
It was dated from Jersey on 12th January, and with it came the
George and the blue riband of the Garter. There were two letters,
one to be shown to his friends, and the other a private note for
Montrose's own eye, and enclosed in the packet were copies of the
recent correspondence with the commissioners of the Estates. In the
first letter the king informed his viceroy of the negotiations with
the Scots Parliament and the chance of a treaty.
Montrose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id=
"Page_344">[344]</a></span> however, is assured that "we will not,
before or during the treaty, do anything contrary to that power and
authority which we have given you by our commission, nor consent to
anything that may bring the least degree of diminution to it; and
if the said treaty should produce an agreement, we will, with our
uttermost care, so provide for the honour and interest of yourself,
and of all that shall engage with you, as shall let the whole world
see the high esteem we have for you." It ends with an exhortation
to "proceed vigorously and effectively in your undertaking"; and
then, with an excess of candour, makes clear the reason. "We doubt
not but all our loyal and well-affected subjects of Scotland will
cordially and effectually join with you, and by that addition of
strength either dispose those who are otherwise minded to make
reasonable demands to us in a treaty, or be able to force them to
it by arms, in case of their obstinate refusal." He desires an
asset to bargain with, a second string to his bow. The private note
merely assured the recipient that Charles would never consent to
anything to his prejudice, and bade him "not to take alarm at any
reports or messages from others."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id=
"FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class=
"fnanchor">[562]</a></p>
<p>It was a clear instruction to proceed with the invasion of
Scotland, but it had an ugly air of double-dealing. The warning
against reports argued that something had been done or said to give
good cause for reports. Montrose, regardless of self, thought only
of the danger to the king&mdash;the risk that by trusting his
enemies he might walk into the same trap as his father. In his
reply, on the 26th of March, he repeats that "it is not your
fortune in you, but your Majesty in whatsomever fortune, that I
make sacred to serve"; but he beseeches his master "to have a
serious eye (now at last) upon the too open crafts are used against
you, chiefly in this conjunction, and that it would please your
Majesty to be so just to yourself as, ere you make a resolve upon
your affairs or your person, your Majesty may be wisely pleased to
hear the zealous opinions of your faithful servants,<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span> who
have nothing in their hearts, nor before their eyes, but the joy of
your Majesty's prosperity and greatness, which shall be ever the
only passion and study of your most sacred Majesty's most humble,
faithful, and most passionate subject and servant!"<a name=

"#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>
<p>There can be no doubt that when he wrote the letters of January
Charles was loyal to Montrose, and that he counted more on
Montrose's success in the field than on the prospect of a treaty.
This was the opinion of the shrewd Commonwealth agent, with an
admirable gift of phrase, who contributed to the official gazette
of the Council of State, <i>A Brief Relation</i>. It was proved by
the royal warrants, dated as late as 29th March, appointing the
veteran Lord Eythin to be Montrose's second-in-command. The king
was no doubt determined to secure honourable terms for his
captain-general in any treaty. But he hankered after a union of all
Scotland on his side, which would be linked to a royalist rising in
England, and he believed that incompatibles might be harmonized by
an adroit negotiator, the more if there were a triumphant army in
the background. The plan was an idle dream; Montrose was the true
realist when he held that Charles's only chance lay in a policy of
Scottish ways for Scotland, English ways for England, and the king
for both&mdash;a policy which meant good-bye to Argyll and the
theocrats of the Solemn League. Charles had no intention of
bringing Montrose to catastrophe, but he made it certain by the
treaty which he pursued, nay, by the very fact of negotiating at
all at such a juncture. Moreover, when Montrose received the king's
message that had happened which, had he known it, might have added
another protest to his reply. As early as 19th January the first
letter had been published in Paris, and a pr&eacute;cis was in the hands
of the Commonwealth Government. It may have got out by a clerical
blunder, for the royal secretariat was not over-competent.<a name=
"FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> It may have been
published by the Montrose faction in Paris to de<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>feat the
projected treaty, or the issue may have been authorized by Charles
to help the treaty's fortunes. There is evidence for each of the
three explanations.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id=
"FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class=
"fnanchor">[565]</a> But, whether we account for the publicity
given to it by accident, maladroit diplomacy, or blundering
psychology, the result was disastrous. Already the letter had been
broadcast over Scotland. Had Montrose been accompanied by a large
and well-equipped foreign army no harm would have been done, but he
had still his army to find, and it was in Scotland that he sought
it. It is one thing to fight in a crusade; it is another to share
in a campaign whose avowed purpose is no more than to create an
object to bargain with. On such mercantile terms you cannot conjure
the spirit that wins battles. The half-hearted would wait upon the
result of the chaffering. Well might Mr. Secretary Nicholas write
to Ormonde: "Some (not without reason) apprehend that the report of
the now approaching treaty will make those of a better sort forbear
to appear for him, until they shall see the issue of this
treaty."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id=

<h3>THE LAST CAMPAIGN<br>
(March-May, 1650)</h3>
<p class="quote">When my affaires goe wrong, I remember that saying

&mdash; <i>Claverhouse to Menteith</i>, July 1680.</p>
<br>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1650</i> March</div>
<p>It has been the fashion among historians to describe the last
campaign as doomed from the start. So in a sense it was, but its
hopelessness did not lie in the actual military and political
situation in Scotland at the moment. That had never been more
favourable. Montrose was, indeed, as far off as ever from
commending himself and his faith to that Covenanting
<i>bourgeoisie</i> which he never lost the hope of converting. But
the arm of the Covenant was shortened. The disaster at Preston had
depleted the fighting strength of the Lowlands, and had driven a
wedge into the Estates. Many of the nobles who had once obeyed
Argyll were now prepared to follow him only in so far as he allied
himself with the king. A real bitterness against England had surged
up in the nation, and this meant popularity for Charles, and a fall
in esteem for those who had dallied with Charles's enemies. The
Estates had no war-chest; every burgh had been bled white by
taxation, and all sections of the people were out of humour with
the Edinburgh junta. The government of the Covenanters, now an
undisguised theocracy, was as incompetent as it was oppressive. In
January of the preceding year the famous Act of Classes had been
passed,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id=
"FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class=
"fnanchor">[567]</a> which excluded from every office&mdash;from a
ministry of state to a burgh deaconate of crafts&mdash;all who were
not of one narrow type in political and religious opinions and
conduct, and which gave the Kirk an absolute veto on all public
appointments. It was as if the theocracy ha<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>d set
out to caricature itself, and it was fast disillusioning every
sympathizer who had the smallest share of practical wisdom.</p>
<p>The military situation was not less promising. Of the former
Covenant generals, Leven was too old, Baillie had been an Engager,
and Hurry was now one of Montrose's companions. Middleton was
waiting to be persuaded.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id=
"FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class=
"fnanchor">[568]</a> Only David Leslie remained, with his
lieutenants Holbourn and Strachan; of these, Holbourn had been
handsomely beaten at Kilsyth, and Strachan, an extreme sectary, was
not trusted by his commanding officers. At the most they had 3,000
foot and 1,500 horse, strung out over a wide front in the northern
Highlands. The estimate of what forces might be raised for the king
in Scotland, which Montrose had sent to Henrietta by Crawford in
the autumn of 1646, had exceeded 20,000.<a name="FNanchor_569_569"
id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class=
"fnanchor">[569]</a> There were uncertain items, like the 1,000 who
had been credited to Lord Nithsdale, the 2,000 to Macdonald of
Sleat, the 1,500 to Huntly, and the 2,000 to Seaforth; but, putting
all doubtful elements aside, it looked as if in the Highlands alone
he could count on 10,000 men. Things had improved since the date of
that estimate. The clan of Mackenzie had risen with Pluscardine,
and might rise again, for their chief, the Queen of Bohemia's
"Highlander," was apparently at last on the royalist side. There is
no equivocal figure of that time but has found its
defender&mdash;Huntly in Patrick Gordon, Hamilton in
Burnet&mdash;and we have Seaforth's defence in the simple pages of
his clansman, Mackenzie of Applecross; but the best that the author
can say is that Seaforth "in the beginning of the king's troubles
had not the light that was afterwards given him."<a name=
"FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> It might reasonably
be assumed that now that light had been vouchsafed. The Engagers,
at least the fighting element in them, were losing some of their
hostility to Montrose. The new Hamilton was again declaring his
willingness "to trail a pike o<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>r ride a private trooper
under him."<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id=
"FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class=
"fnanchor">[571]</a> The new Huntly, too, whom we have known as
Lord Lewis Gordon, was reported to be waiting obediently on the
king's commands,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id=
"FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class=
"fnanchor">[572]</a> though a little annoyed at not receiving the
Garter. Again, if Montrose got one-half of the levies and supplies
promised from the Continent, if he got one-quarter of the help
hinted at from Ireland, he would be able to put into the field from
4,000 to 5,000 regular troops as well.</p>
<p>Leslie was in a poor position both for attack and defence, and
defeat to him would mean annihilation. For Montrose to succeed, all
that seemed essential was that he should have sufficient troops in
the far north to win the first round. If that happened, he might
count on the Macleods and the Mackenzies; probably, too, on the
Gordons; and then the safety of his route to the south would be
assured. Once in Badenoch, he had all the loyal levies of the west
and of Atholl to draw upon, and with the Lowlands divided it was
hard to see what could prevent him from dominating Scotland. Then
he could cross the Border and appeal to the royalists and the
English moderates, not like the luckless Hamilton with an insolent
dogma of Presbyterian ascendancy, but with a wise recognition of
national rights, a generous policy of toleration, and that
constitutional creed of his which John Hampden would not have
scrupled to subscribe. We know to-day how little hold the army of
the Commonwealth had upon the affection of the English people. Of
the two leaders, Montrose was not the inferior in military genius,
and if, with 20,000 Highland and foreign foot and Lowland horse,
and with England's goodwill, he had met Cromwell on his return from
Ireland somewhere south of Trent, the odds are that the Restoration
would have been antedated by ten years.</p>
<p><i>Dis aliter visum</i>; rightly, perhaps, for Cromwell had
still much to give to the wo<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>rld. As it chanced, every
condition of success was to fail. Montrose had far too few foreign
troops. The local clans did not rise in his support, and there was
no sign of movement in the Lowlands. The king's letter, and the
news that negotiations were on foot between him and the Estates,
had done their work. Men were weary of fighting, and half-hearted
in any cause. The satiety which attended the Restoration was
beginning. Let them be shown a way of peace and they would acclaim
it, but meantime it was the duty of wise folk to stay at home. The
Covenanting r&eacute;gime was becoming so intolerable to every class that,
had there been no alternative, many might have grasped at
Montrose's way of deliverance; but, since an alternative was openly
held before the nation by the king his master, the cautious man let
his sword sleep in the thatch and hoped for a quiet life.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>The king might handicap him and stultify his mission, but
Montrose was true to himself. For him there could be no turning
back on this side the grave, for he had been to the edge of the
world and looked over the other side. The "waft of death" had gone
out against him, and all his doings have a touch of the unearthly.
He devised strange standards, like those which, in Bunyan's <i>Holy
War</i>, Emmanuel and Diabolus used in their battle for Mansoul.
His foot bore on a black ground the bleeding head of the dead king,
with the words <i>Deo et Victricibus Armis</i>. The cavalry
colours, too, were black, with three pairs of clasped hands holding
three drawn swords, and the legend <i>Quos Pietas Virtus et Honor
fecit Amicos</i>. His own flag was of white damask, with two steep
rocks and a river between, and a lion about to leap from one to the
other. His motto was <i>Nil Medium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_573_573"
id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class=
"fnanchor">[573]</a> He was putting it to the touch, as he had
sung, "to win or lose it all." There is an air of doom and
desperation in everything, as of some dark saga of the
north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1650</i> April</div>
<p>The early days of April were spent at Kirkwall in marshalling
his little forces. There were four or five hundred Danish troops
already there.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id=
"FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class=
"fnanchor">[574]</a> The Orcadians, then very far from being a
warlike people, were strong on the king's side, and raised 1,000
men. With Montrose were a number of cavaliers and soldiers of
fortune: Lord Frendraught, Sutherland's nephew and his old opponent
at Aberdeen; veterans of the German wars like Sir William Johnston
and Colonel Thomas Gray;<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id=
"FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class=
"fnanchor">[575]</a> his half-brother, Harry Graham; Sir John
Hurry, now twice a turncoat; Sir James Douglas, a brother of
Morton; William Hay, the new Kinnoull; Sir Francis Hay of Dalgetty,
Drummond of Balloch, Ogilvy of Powrie, and Menzies of Pitfoddels;
and one or two English royalists, like that Major Lisle who had
left Scotland with him in September 1646. These gentlemen were
mounted and made up the whole cavalry of the force, probably some
40 or 50 in all. Hurry was dispatched in advance with a picked band
of 500 men, to look into the chances of a landing on the mainland.
He found no difficulty, and, hastening on past Wick and Dunbeath,
secured the Ord of Caithness&mdash;the narrow pass on the shore
through which ran the road to the south.</p>
<p>Montrose, with the rest of his army, crossed the Pentland Firth
in fishing-boats about the 12th of April. There was little chance
of recruiting in Caithness, but some of the gentry, who were
partisans of the Reay interest, joined his standard. It was his
business, seeing that his forces were so inadequate, to push on
with the greatest possible speed, so as to pass the low coastlands
and reach the shelter of the hills, where the Covenant horse could
do him no harm and reinforcements could be awaited. Leslie held the
castles of Brahan, Chanonry, Eilandonan, and Cromarty; and the Earl
of Sutherland, who was hot for the Covenant, garrisoned Dunrobin,
Skibo, and Dornoch&mdash;all key-points on the coast
road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id=
"Page_352">[352]</a></span> But Montrose had not hitherto been wont
to trouble about fortresses in his rear. If he marched with his old
speed, another week should find him in Badenoch.</p>
<p>At first his movements were swift enough. Landing near John o'
Groats, he dashed upon Thurso, and the local lairds, except the
Sinclairs, took the oath of allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_576_576"
id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class=
"fnanchor">[576]</a> Leaving Harry Graham with 200 men to keep them
to their word, he marched south over the Caithness moors to Sir
John Sinclair's castle of Dunbeath, took it after a few days'
siege, and left a garrison. He had something less than 800 men when
he joined Hurry at the Ord of Caithness. Two days later he reached
Sutherland's castle of Dunrobin, which he summoned; admission was
denied, and the place was too strong to take, but another day was
wasted, and some of his men, who had incautiously ventured between
the castle and the sea, were made prisoners.<a name=

<p class="caption">The Campaign of Carbisdale</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Now began the fatal delay. There was no need to diminish his
tiny army by leaving garrisons behind him. Orkney was not a base
the communications with which it was necessary to guard; he had
still to reach his true base, which was the central Highlands. His
business was not to waste an hour in getting to Badenoch. But he
may have felt himself too weak to face the garrisons of the Dornoch
lowlands, and he was in strong hopes of reinforcements from the
north-west. So he turned inland up the glen of the Fleet&mdash;the
route taken to-day by the railway&mdash;and moved past Rhaoine to
Lairg, at the foot of Loch Shin. It was now the 23rd of April. To
reach the south he must cross or turn the long inlet known as the
Kyle of Sutherland; the shortest way was down the Shin, but the
winter had been severe and the fords were bad, so he preferred to
cross the hills to Rosehall in Strath Oykell. Thence he moved
down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id=
"Page_353">[353]</a></span> the right bank of the Oykell, reaching
the Kyle early on the 25th.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id=
"FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class=
"fnanchor">[578]</a> He was expecting hourly a great accession of
Mackenzies from the west, and he hoped for recruits from the
Monroes and Rosses<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id=
"FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class=
"fnanchor">[579]</a> south of the Dornoch Firth. He believed that
he need fear no immediate opposition, and that there was in all
Ross but one troop of enemy horse.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id=
"FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class=
"fnanchor">[580]</a></p>
<p>Meantime Leslie was hurrying north to a rendezvous at Brechin,
which he had appointed for the 25th of April. He had instructed
Strachan and Halket, who commanded the Covenant troops in Moray, to
do their best to delay Montrose's advance; so Strachan, with the
garrisons of Brahan and Chanonry, went north to Tain, where he was
joined by other Covenant posts. He had five troops of
horse&mdash;220 men in all;<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id=
"FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class=
"fnanchor">[581]</a> 36 musketeers of Lawers's regiment, and a
reserve of 400 Monroes and Rosses whom Montrose had vainly hoped to
attach to his standard. Lord Sutherland was sent north of the Kyle
to oppose Harry Graham, and cut off the way of retreat in that
direction.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 27th of April, Strachan marched west from Tain
to a place called Wester Fearn, on the southern shore of the Kyle,
a few miles south-east of Bonar Bridge and the mouth of the river
Carron. Leslie only left Brechin the same day. Montrose had
meantime encamped at a spot about five miles off near the head of
the Kyle, under the lee of the steep hill of Craigcoinichean. It
was covered with a light undergrowth, and in front was a piece of
more or less level ground, with the tarn of Carbisdale at the north
end, and to the south-east the deep-cut channel of the Culvain
burn. He had the hill to guard his rear, the Culvain burn on one
flank and the Kyle on the other, and to defend his front towards
the Carron mouth a line of trenches and breastworks had been
erected. Already Montrose had occupied the position for two
days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id=
"Page_354">[354]</a></span> waiting for the local clans, notably
the Mackenzies. Had he pushed on, he might have crossed by the hill
road to Alness, and have easily given Strachan the slip. After
that, in another two days he could have passed Beauly and been on
his old secret road to the Spey. As it was, he had found a strong
position, if he chose to stay by it, for no cavalry could force the
pass of Craigcoinichean, and he commanded the shore road down the
Kyle by which his own scouts could bring him early intelligence of
any enemy advance. He had found that, but nothing more, and
meantime the precious hours were flying.</p>
<p>Strachan reached Wester Fearn about three in the afternoon of
the 27th. He knew from his scouts where the royalists lay, and he
knew their weakness in numbers. It was his business to draw them
down from the hill to the flat ground, where his cavalry could act.
Accordingly he concealed most of his horse among the long broom
which covered the slopes about Wester Fearn. The contingent of
Monroes and Rosses made a circuit up Strath Carron to a point on
the heights above Carbisdale, where they awaited the issue. Like
Rob Roy at Sheriffmuir, their heart was not in the fight, and they
waited to see how the day went before sharing in it. Strachan then
advanced a single troop up the coast till he had passed the
Carron.</p>
<p>Major Lisle, who commanded Montrose's 40 horse, was sent to
reconnoitre, and returned with information of the single troop. One
of the gentleman volunteers, Monro of Achnes, repeated the
assurance which Montrose had already received&mdash;that there was
but one troop of horse in all the shire, and that he saw it before
him. Montrose ordered Lisle to halt, and gave the word to the foot
to advance. Meantime Strachan was bringing up the rest of his force
from Wester Fearn. As soon as the royalists were on the low ground
they could see nothing of his movements, and in the cover of the
broom and the wildwood the whole Covenant cavalry crossed the
Carron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id=
"Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly upon Lisle's 40 horse Strachan dashed with 100 of his
dragoons. Instantly there appeared a second troop under Halket, and
then the reserves and the musketeers. Lisle was driven backward
upon the foot, who were not deployed for battle and were easily
cast into confusion. They cannot have been more than 1,200 in
all&mdash;400 Danes and Germans, and the rest the raw Orkney
levies. The foreigners were not accustomed to receive a cavalry
charge unsupported, and the Orcadians had probably never seen a
dragoon in their lives. They fell back in disorder, and Montrose
saw that his one chance was to regain the safety of the
Craigcoinichean entrenchments. At Dundee, once before, he had done
the same thing under greater difficulties; but then his force had
been of a different quality. Had he had his 500 gallant Irish the
day would have been saved, but they had long been below the turf of
Slain-Man's-Lee. The mercenaries retreated in some order, but the
hapless islanders, farm-boys and fisher-folk unused to war, fled
without a blow. Upon the fugitives came Strachan's reserves, and
Lisle's handful of cavalry, in attempting to cover their retreat,
was cut to pieces. There fell Lisle himself, Menzies of Pitfoddels,
who bore the royal standard, Douglas and Guthrie and Ogilvy of
Powrie. Soon the broken remnant of the royalists, a few hundreds at
the most, was making its last stand on the wooded slopes of
Craigcoinichean.</p>
<p>Down from the hills came the Monroes and the Rosses, convinced
at last, to take their share of the victory. The Orkney men were
drowned in hundreds trying to cross the Kyle, or were cut down in
the haugh. Not a family in the islands but lost a son or a brother.
Presently the fire from the woods slackened, and the royalists,
making for the higher slopes across the open, were shot or stabbed
by the horse. Hurry was captured, and with him 58 officers and
nearly 400 men. Montrose had his horse shot under him. It was
Philiphaugh repeated, and once more he was prevented from finding
the death which he desired in battle. Frendraught, himself spent
with wounds, force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id=
"Page_356">[356]</a></span>d him upon his own horse, and bade him
remember his duty to the king's cause. In the late spring gloaming
the viceroy of Scotland, accompanied by two of the Sinclair gentry,
turned his face from the lost field toward the trackless
wildernesses of the west.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id=
"FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class=
"fnanchor">[582]</a></p>
<p>He flung away his sword-belt and coat with the star of the
Garter that he might escape recognition, and on Frendraught's horse
swam the tidal waters of the Oykell. Then he discarded the horse
and managed to buy or borrow some rough Highland clothes. Strath
Oykell was no place for a mounted man. There were two courses
before him: to get into Strathnaver, and so reach Harry Graham at
Thurso, and finally pass into Orkney; or to make for the friendly
Reay country in the north-west. For the first he must reach Loch
Shin and travel by Glen Tirry; for the second his route lay by Loch
Shin or by Glen Cassley, and then by Loch More and the Laxford. But
he had no knowledge of the country, nor had either of the
Sinclairs, one of whom was an Orcadian and the other of Brims in
Caithness; and they missed their way among the darkening hills.
Instead of going north they wandered due west up the Oykell.</p>
<p>For two days and two nights they were without food and shelter.
There were few houses in that land, and no roads; it had been a
backward year, and the snow was still far down on the slopes, the
bogs were full, and every stream was an icy torrent. With starving
and hunted men the sense of direction soon disappears, one stretch
of sodden bent is like another, and presently the hills lose their
features and become a mere blur to the wearied eye. Somehow the
three struggled over the watershed, where the streams began to flow
to the Atlantic. It is possible that they believed that they were
twenty miles farther north and beginning the descent towards
Scourie. But they were now in desperate case for food, and they
resolved to separate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357"
id="Page_357">[357]</a></span> take different roads on the chance
of stumbling on help. Sir Edward Sinclair, the Orcadian, was never
heard of again; somewhere in the wilderness he died of famine, and
only the foxes and the eagles could tell of his end.<a name=
"FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> On the third day
Montrose was given bread and milk at the shieling of Glaschyle. His
enemies were already beating the glens, and a party reached the hut
while Montrose was indoors, but he was hidden by the shepherd under
a trough. On departing, he regretted that he had put his host in
danger, and "determined never to do the like again to avoid death,
of which, he thanked God, he was not afraid."<a name=
"FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> He was now some
thirty miles from the scene of the battle.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1650</i> May</div>
<p>But the hue-and-cry was out against him. The laird of Assynt was
a certain Neil Macleod, a young man of twenty-two and a member of a
sept, the "seed of John the Grizzled," with a dark record for deeds
of blood. He had married a daughter of Monro of Lemlair, whom
Montrose had hitherto looked upon as an ally, and he had himself
been protected by Seaforth, and seems to have passed for something
of a royalist. His brother-in-law sent him a letter bidding him
search his country for fugitives, and "chiefly James
Graham,"<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id=
"FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class=
"fnanchor">[585]</a> and Neil was no laggard in the business. One
of his men found the famished wanderer on the confines of Assynt,
and Montrose, when he heard his master's name, probably asked to be
taken to him. He thought that he had much to hope for from a
Macleod and a son-in-law of Lemlair. On the evening of the 30th of
April he was brought to the castle of Ardvreck, which still stands
on the northern shore of Loch Assynt. There he found Neil, and
there he met, too, the survi<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>ving Sinclair, who had
been brought in by Neil's gillies. But from Assynt he got no
kindness. The head of the viceroy was worth sufficient gold to set
up for good his impoverished family. Montrose asked to be sent to
Orkney, and offered him money, but Neil was resolute, knowing well
that the Estates would outbid the fugitive. He dispatched an
express with the happy news to Leslie, who had now arrived at Tain,
and confined the prisoners in the cellars of his castle. A few days
later, on the 4th of May, Holbourn arrived at Ardvreck, and
Montrose was committed to his hands.</p>
<h3>* * * * *</h3>
<p>Carbisdale, like Philiphaugh, was a surprise and a rout rather
than a battle. It was the first action which Montrose ever fought
with a superiority in numbers, for he had 1,200 men as against
Strachan's 660; but the only contest was between the 220 Covenant
troopers and Montrose's 40 horse and 400 foreigners. Further,
infantry in those days, unless of exceptional quality or
magnificently posted, had little chance against even a weak body of
cavalry; so for the purpose of the battle we may rule out all the
foot who were struggling in the flats, and say that the contest lay
between Lisle's 40 gentlemen volunteers and Strachan's horse. There
could never have been any doubt as to the issue, and, though
Strachan deserves all credit for a bold feat of arms, yet his task
was easy. Montrose was doomed when he left the heights of
Craigcoinichean, and he left them, as we have seen, because of the
defective information of his local scoutmaster. But indeed he was
lost long before, during the days when he waited for the Mackenzies
who never came. He failed because, instead of pushing on with all
speed to Badenoch, he wasted time on a half-hearted clan. If Neil
Macleod was the immediate cause of Montrose's fate, his patron,
Seaforth, was the ruin of the campaign; and Seaforth's indecision
was due beyond doubt to the two-faced tactics of Charles. On the
2nd of May, the day on which Montrose's doom was sealed, the king
signed with the Covenanters the draft of the Treaty of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id=
"Page_359">[359]</a></span>Breda.</p>
<p>The name of the laird of Assynt lives in Scottish history with
that of Sir John Menteith, who sold Wallace. It is remembered as
the solitary case of a Gael who betrayed a suppliant for gold. Ian
Lom, the bard of Keppoch, has left bitter verses on the "stripped
tree of the false apples, Neil's son of woeful Assynt." He made
little of his infamy. His lands were raided by Glengarry, the
Macleods, and the penitent Mackenzies. After the Restoration he was
a good deal in gaol, and was twice tried for his life. His castle
was burned, and his family, as if under a curse, soon withered out
of existence. He was awarded 25,000 pounds Scots for his services,
of which 20,000 were to be paid in coin and the rest in oatmeal. It
does not appear that he ever got the money, but the receipts for
the meal were long extant, and Highland tradition is positive that
two-thirds of it were sour.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id=

<div class="sidenote"><i>1650</i> May</div>
<p>Now that the last blow had been struck, and only death remained,
the oppression was lifted from Montrose's soul. The "fey" mood had
passed, and his spirit was enlarged. The touch of haughtiness,
which his contemporaries remarked in him, the self-assurance
necessary for one whose daily bread was peril, had gone from him;
gentleness he had never lost, but he recovered the modest
simplicity which Clarendon had approved long ago in Oxford. Once
more he is the clear-sighted and constant patriot, the great
gentleman who, in the hour of deepest degradation, can meet the
taunts of his enemies with a smiling face, the Christian who has
compassion upon the frailty of mankind. For six years his name had
terrified his opponents, and as their hold upon the nation had
declined, so had their nerve and courage. The news of his landing
in the north had shaken the Estates to their foundation. The
crowning mercy of Carbisdale was at first scarcely believed, and
when Strachan himself arrived post-haste to claim his reward, their
exultation of relief knew no bounds. Mixed with it was the zest of
coming revenge. Their tormentor had been marvellously delivered
into their hands, and we can judge of their past trepidation by the
punishment they devised. The measure of their vengeance
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id=
"Page_362">[362]</a></span> the measure of their fear.</p>
<p>It is not easy to judge Charles with either patience or
fairness, the master was so immeasurably smaller than the servant.
In the compost of graces and infirmities which made up his
character, a fine sense of honour had no part, since for that some
spiritual discipline is required. He was an engaging creature of
impulse, with a tolerant humour which could laugh at himself as
well as at others, with the courage which comes from a good
constitution and a high vitality, and which could face misfortunes
with equanimity&mdash;both his own and his friends'. But it is
almost certain that, before signing the Treaty of Breda, this
"gentle, innocent, well-inclined prince" (so he seemed to
Baillie)<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id=
"FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class=
"fnanchor">[587]</a> had convinced himself, with his ready
optimism, that he had made provision for the safety of his
captain-general. On the 5th of May he wrote to Montrose, bidding
him lay down his arms and disband his men. He seems to have
received assurances from the Scottish commissioners of an indemnity
for the royalist army. On the 8th of May he wrote to the Estates
asking that Montrose and his forces should be allowed to leave the
country in safety. A private letter was also written to the
viceroy, telling him that 12,000 rix-dollars were at his call in
Sir Patrick Drummond's hands. Sir William Fleming, a cousin of
Montrose's, had further orders, dated the 12th of May, written
apparently after some rumour of Carbisdale had reached the king.
These latest instructions were not to deliver the letter of the 8th
of May to Parliament unless Montrose was still unbeaten and at the
head of a reasonable force; if he had been defeated, the letter was
to be concealed. Apparently Charles did not want to ask for grace
for his captain-general from the Estates if he was a fugitive; he
trusted to his private arrangement with the Scottish commissioners.
It is a tangled story, but it is inconceivable that the king hoped
to conceal or disavow his complicity in the invasion. This was
already clear from the published letter of the 12th of January,
which every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id=
"Page_363">[363]</a></span> one in Scotland knew of, and from his
personal letter of the 5th of May to Montrose, which was delivered
and read to the Estates. Still another letter, dated the 12th of
May, was also read to Parliament, in which Charles disclaimed all
responsibility for Montrose's doings.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id=
"FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class=
"fnanchor">[588]</a> But it is impossible to believe that the king,
who was no fool, and had the rest of the correspondence in his
memory, could have been guilty of so futile and purposeless a piece
of treachery by which no one could be deceived. It is more likely
that this was a fabrication of Will Murray, Argyll's emissary, with
the view of alienating from the now Covenanted king the last
remnants of royalist respect in Scotland and Cavalier support in
England. Base and heartless as was Charles's conduct, it is
incredible that it reached the height of perfidy which Argyll and
Loudoun would have had the world believe.<a name="FNanchor_589_589"

<p>To Montrose royal duplicity and Covenanting intrigues had become
matters of little moment. For him the long day's task was nearly
done, and the hour of unarming had struck. He was led in triumphant
progress by his captors through the length of Scotland, but the
triumph was not theirs. On the 5th of May Holbourn hurried him from
Ardvreck by way of Invershin to Skibo, on the north side of the
Kyle. A night was spent there, and the lady of the castle, finding
that the rank of the prisoner was not sufficiently recognized, is
said to have beaten Holbourn about the head with a leg of mutton
and had Montrose given the seat of honour.<a name=
"FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> He was ferried over
the Kyle, and on the 8th delivered to David Leslie at Tain. Thence
next morning he was carried by way of Dingwall to Brahan castle. On
the following day he was at Beauly, and we have the record of Mr.
James Fraser, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364"
id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> Lovat's chaplain, and then a boy of
sixteen, who now joined the march. The viceroy sat "upon a little
shelty horse, without a saddle, but a quilt of rags and straw, and
pieces of rope for stirrups, his feet fastened under the horse's
belly, with a tether and a bit halter for a bridle."<a name=
"FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> It was a mode of
progress which was later endured by many saints of the Covenant,
notably Mr. Donald Cargill. He still wore peasant's clothes, on his
head was a montero cap, and around his shoulders a ragged, old,
reddish plaid. The fatigue and privations of the past week had
induced a high fever. At Muirtown, near Inverness, he begged for
water, and there the crowd from the town came out to gaze on him.
The two ministers of Inverness also appeared, and showed in their
behaviour a decency unusual in their profession; one of them, Mr.
John Annand, had been a former acquaintance of the prisoner. At the
bridge-end an old woman railed at him and reminded him of the
houses which had been burned when he besieged the town. "Yet he
never altered his countenance, but with a majesty and state
beseeming him kept his countenance high."<a name="FNanchor_592_592"
id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class=
"fnanchor">[592]</a></p>
<p>The magistrates met him at the cross, where they had set up a
table of refreshments. He was offered wine, and mixed it with
water. Fraser saw the other prisoners drinking heartily under a
forestair, and remarked among them Sir John Hurry, "a robust, tall,
stately fellow, with a long cut in his cheek." Hurry was the true
soldier of fortune, own brother to Dugald Dalgetty, and throughout
his varied career and many changes of side he preserved a certain
disarming audacity and humour. As was said of a more famous Sir
John, the world could have better spared a better man. The provost,
Duncan Forbes of Culloden, a courteous member of an honourable
house, said on taking leave: "My lord, I am sorry for your
circumstances." That night the company were lodged at Castle
Stewart, on the road to Nairn.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>
<p>On the way through Moray many friends came to greet him, college
companions at St. Andrews, and loyalists such as Pluscardine, whose
clan had so grievously failed him. At Elgin he was greatly cheered
by the sight of an old college friend, Mr. Alexander Somers, the
minister of Duffus. His well-wishers conveyed him over Spey, and on
the 11th he halted at Keith, where he lay on straw in a tent set up
in the fields. The next day was the Sabbath, and he attended the
ministrations of Mr. William Kinanmond, who preached from the
favourite Covenanting text of the hewing of Agag and the
Amalekites. He violently abused the prisoner, till he disgusted
even his Covenanting hearers. "Rail on, Rabshakeh," was his
victim's only reply. "All honest men," says Fraser, "hated
Kinanmond for this ever after."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id=

<p>On the 13th the prisoner reached Pitcaple castle, the home of an
Engager, John Leslie, whose wife was a kinswoman of
Montrose.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id=
"FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class=
"fnanchor">[594]</a> The quicker road to the south through Mar was
not taken, probably through fear of a rescue by the Farquharsons,
and the route chosen was one by which Montrose had often led his
swift armies. Now he traversed the scene of his victories with a
herald pacing before him, proclaiming: "Here comes James Graham, a
traitor to his country." He was probably at Fordoun on the 14th,
and on the 15th he reached Southesk's castle of Kinnaird. There he
saw his two younger children, Robert and Jean. When he left them he
left the last slender ties which still bound him to earth. His wife
and his eldest son were gone; his best friends had perished on the
scaffold; the great comradeship was broken, and its members dead or
on their way to death; his cause, the clean and sane ideals he had
championed, was undone; death had no terrors for one who had
nothing to live for, and who had faced it so often with a lover's
gaiety. His words might have been those of Kent in
<i>Lear</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id=

<br>
<p class="poem">"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;<br>
My master calls me, I must not say no."</p>
<br>
<p>On the night of the 15th he halted at the house of Grange, a
property of the Durhams, five miles from Dundee. Here there seems
to have been an attempt as at Pitcaple, to assist him to escape.
The lady of the house plied the guards with strong ale and brandy,
and they, being Highlanders of Lawers's regiment, willingly
succumbed. But the outer guards had not been tampered with, and the
fugitive was discovered by a trooper of Strachan's horse.<a name=
"FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Next day he entered
Dundee, and to the eternal credit of that staunchly Covenanting
town, which, moreover, had suffered more than most at Montrose's
hands, he was received with sympathy and respect. "The whole town
expressed a great deal of sorrow for his condition, and presented
him with clothes and all other things suited to his place, birth,
and person."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id=
"FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class=
"fnanchor">[596]</a> We have no record of the two days' march
across Fife. No doubt the ministers flocked to upbraid him, and the
heroes who had returned from Tippermuir and Kilsyth came to stare
at one who had given them little cause to love him. From Dysart or
Kirkcaldy the company took ship for Leith, and reached it about
four o'clock on the afternoon of Saturday the 18th. On the same day
and at the same port arrived Sir William Fleming, with the king's
letter of disbandment.</p>
<p>The Covenanters had made ample preparation to receive the
prisoner. They knew that what they had to do must be done quickly.
The viceroy must be dead before the king's coming to Scotland, or
trouble would follow; a party, now royalist in policy, could not
put to death one who carried the royal commission. Further, the
Commonwealth had never shown any bitterness against the great
captain, and might interdict those of the Estates who favoured
Cromwell from the kind of vengeance which Cromwell as a rule
preferred to leave to his Maker. There were magnanimous men, too,
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id=
"Page_367">[367]</a></span> all parties in Scotland, who resented
the unsoldierly treatment of a soldier, and there were his many
friends in foreign courts, especially in the court of France, who
would be certain to plead for him if time were allowed. Such an
appeal was actually sent at the instigation of Cardinal de Retz,
signed by the young king, Louis the Fourteenth,<a name=
"FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> in which it was
eloquently urged that Montrose had always acted within the terms of
his royal commission, and therefore could not be condemned by those
who now acknowledged the royal authority. But the appeal arrived
after the deed had been done. Argyll and Loudoun were not the men
to tarry when it was a matter of getting rid of a rival so
formidable and so feared.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the news of Carbisdale, the Estates had met to
consider the question of punishment. In a time of civil confusion
nice questions of legality are out of place, and the condemnation
of Montrose was as legal as any other act of the Parliament then
sitting in Scotland. He had been attainted and outlawed in 1644,
and there had been no reversal of the sentence.<a name=
"FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> A commission was
appointed to decide on the details of the penalty, and on the 17th
of May it made its report.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id=
"FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class=
"fnanchor">[599]</a> The captive was to be met at the gates by the
officers of justice and the hangman, and conducted with every
circumstance of ignominy to the Tolbooth. Thereafter he was to be
hanged on a gibbet&mdash;not beheaded, as was the custom with State
prisoners&mdash;with Wishart's book and a copy of his own last
declaration tied around his neck. Thus would be fulfilled the words
of the prophet Rothes, and he would be "lifted up above the rest in
three fathoms of a rope." After death the head was to be struck off
and placed on a spike on the Tolbooth; the body dismembered, and
the limbs fixed in public places in Stirling, Glasgow, Perth, and
Aberdeen. If he repented of his misdeeds, the ban of
excommunication would be removed, and the body buried in
Greyfriars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id=
"Page_368">[368]</a></span> churchyard; if not, it would go to the
felons' pit on the Boroughmuir. It was piously hoped that the
common folk of Edinburgh, who had lost kith and kin in his wars,
would await his entrance and show their hatred with filth and
stones. For this purpose his hands were to be pinioned behind his
back.</p>
<p>The afternoon was clear and chilly, such as is common on the
shores of the Firth in late May. The magistrates of Edinburgh met
him at Leith, and the procession was formed, the other prisoners on
foot, and Montrose himself mounted on a cart-horse. His face was
drawn and wasted with fever, and his grey eyes burned with an
unnatural brilliance. The good folk of Dundee had given him clothes
more suited to his condition than those he had worn when captured,
and he bore himself among the hostile crowd with a gentle dignity.
A smile, it is said, flickered about his mouth, not of scorn but of
peace. When he passed the Netherbow, where the <i>faubourg</i> of
the Canongate began, in which stood the houses of the nobility, he
found awaiting him the officers of justice, the hangman, and a
hangman's cart drawn by four horses. He was shown the sentence of
the Estates and read it carefully, saying that he was sorry that
the king, whose commission he bore, should be so dishonoured. Then
he entered the cart, and was tied to a high seat with cords across
his breast and arms. The hangman wore his red bonnet, but Montrose,
according to his sentence, must ride uncovered.</p>
<p>Slowly, in the bright evening, the procession moved up the
ancient Via Dolorosa of Scottish history.<a name="FNanchor_600_600"
id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class=
"fnanchor">[600]</a> The street was lined by a great
crowd&mdash;the dregs of the Edinburgh slums, the retainers of the
Covenanting lords, ministers from far and near&mdash;all the
elements most bitterly hostile to the prisoner. But to the
amazement of the organizers of the spectacle there was no sign of
popular wrath. Rather there was silence, a tense air of sympathy
and pity and startled admiration. The<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> high pale countenance set
up in that place of public scorn awed the mob into stillness. "In
all the way, there appeared in him such majesty, courage, modesty,
and even somewhat more than natural, that these common women who
had lost their husbands and children in his wars, and who were
hired to stone him, were, upon the sight of him, so astonished and
moved that their intended curses turned into tears and
prayers."<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id=
"FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class=
"fnanchor">[601]</a> In the strained quiet, broken only by excited
sobs, there was one jarring note. Lady Jean Gordon, Lord
Haddington's widow, Argyll's niece and Huntly's daughter, is said
to have laughed shrilly and shouted a word of insult from the
balcony where she sat. A voice cried out of the crowd that the
right place for her was in the hangman's cart to expiate her
sins.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>
<p>In the lodgings along the Canongate the Covenant chiefs were
assembled to witness the degradation of their enemy. In the balcony
of Lord Moray's house Lord Lorn sat with his young bride, Lady Mary
Stewart, the same man who, thirty-five years later, was himself to
go to a not inglorious scaffold. Inside the house, with the
shutters half-closed, stood Argyll with Loudoun and Wariston.
Montrose, as he passed, caught a glimpse of the anxious, unhappy
face which he knew so well, and for the first time for long the two
men looked into each other's eyes. . . . The shutters were closed
and the faces disappeared. There was an English soldier in the
crowd who observed the incident and cried: "It was no wonder they
started aside at his look, for they durst not look him in the face
these seven years bygone."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id=
"FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class=
"fnanchor">[603]</a></p>
<p>It is the last we shall see of Argyll. What he thought in that
moment we can only guess. In his letter to Lothian, written on the
day of the execution, he reflects that Montrose had "got some
resolution how to go out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370"
id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> of this world, but nothing at all
how to enter into another."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id=
"FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class=
"fnanchor">[604]</a> But there must have been more in that subtle
mind than this pious platitude, for in Montrose he looked upon his
stark opposite, and in his enemy's downfall he could read the
presage of his own. If Montrose had failed, so had he, and with a
far more complete failure. Of all that he had built nothing had any
hope of permanence. The theocracy on which his power was founded
was crumbling beneath him. A mind of his calibre cannot have been
bemused by the ministerial dreams of Presbyterian dominance in
Britain; he had fleeting visions of political moderation and
religious tolerance which were denied to his colleagues. But,
playing with the skill of the adroit politician for immediate
gains, he had been too successful; he had won in the short game
only to find that his victory made the larger purpose for ever
impossible. The Solemn League hung round his neck like a millstone.
He had summoned spirits from the deep which he could not control.
He had allied himself with the English Parliament, and discovered
too late that he was being ground between rival fanaticisms. That
very year he was to call his associates "madmen,"<a name=
"FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and for the rest of
his life, in his intrigues with Charles and his intrigues with
Cromwell, he was to be no more than a distracted politician,
without creed or comfort. Nothing remained to him but the sombre
religion which he had acquired long before at the Glasgow Assembly,
and which at any rate taught him how to die.</p>
<p>As Montrose passed the cross he saw the new gallows standing
ready to receive him&mdash;that gallows which was to earn the name
of the "Ministers' Altar." About seven o'clock he reached the
Tolbooth. His bonds were cut, and as he descended from the cart he
gave the hangman the customary drink-money. Scarcely was he inside
the prison when a deputation from the Estates, with its retinue of
ministers, arrived to interrogate him. He refused to answer, for
indeed he was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id=
"Page_371">[371]</a></span> weary with travel and sickness, and at
last his tormentors withdrew. His parting words to them were a
jest. "The compliments they had put upon him that day," he said,
"had proved something tedious." He was still young&mdash;not yet
thirty-eight.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id=
"FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class=
"fnanchor">[606]</a></p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Next day, being the Sabbath, there was a great preaching. From
every pulpit in the city the clergy thundered against the
excommunicate, James Graham, and no less against the mob which had
refused to stone him. The prisoner was visited by a deputation of
ministers and members of Parliament, among them Sir James Stewart
of Coltness, the Provost of Edinburgh, who was responsible for the
details of the execution, and who, though a staunch Covenanter, had
protested against its barbarity&mdash;"so much butchery and
dismembering."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id=
"FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class=
"fnanchor">[607]</a> They got no satisfaction. He told them, in the
words of the <i>Wigton Papers</i>, that "if they thought they had
affronted him the day before by carrying him in a cart they were
much mistaken, for he thought it the most honourable and joyful
journey ever he made; God having all the while most comfortably
manifested Himself to him, and furnished him with resolution to
overlook the reproaches of men, and to behold Him for whose cause
he suffered."</p>
<p>He was given no peace. At eight o'clock on the Monday morning
his persecutors returned to the attack. Mr. James Guthrie, Mr.
Mungo Law, Mr. Robert Traill, and others were no doubt bound in
duty to visit an erring member of their own communion, and they
hoped to extract some confession from him which could be used to
efface the profound impression that his appearance had made on the
people of Edinburgh. They charged him at a venture with imaginary
personal v<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id=
"Page_372">[372]</a></span>ices, of which he had none. Then they
accused him of taking up arms against his country, of using Irish
troops, and of shedding Scottish blood. He replied, as Wodrow's
informant told him, in a manner "too airy and <i>volage</i>, not so
much suiting the gravity of a nobleman."<a name="FNanchor_608_608"
id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class=
"fnanchor">[608]</a> Using their own armoury, he reminded them that
David, in the cave of Adullam, had gathered together an odd
fighting force; and as for bloodshed, he declared "if it could have
been thereby prevented, he would rather it had all come out of his
own veins." Lastly, they charged him with a breach of the Covenant,
and his answer was ready. "The Covenant which I took I own it and
adhere to it. Bishops, I care not for them. I never intended to
advance their interests. But when the king had granted you all your
desires, and you were every one sitting under his vine and his fig
tree&mdash;that then you should have taken a party in England by
the hand, and entered into a League and Covenant with them against
the king, was the thing I judged my duty to oppose to the
yondmost." Mr. James Guthrie then touched on the excommunication,
and said that since the prisoner showed himself obdurate it must
remain. With the strange arrogance of his kind, he had the "fearful
apprehension that what is bound on earth God will bind in heaven."
Montrose replied gently that he would gladly be reconciled to the
Church of Scotland, but that he could not call that his sin which
he accounted to have been his duty.</p>
<p>When the ministers left him he was given a little bread dipped
in ale for his breakfast, but he was not allowed a barber to shave
him. At ten o'clock he was taken before the bar of Parliament to
hear his sentence. It was common knowledge that he had acted under
the king's credentials, and therefore nothing in the nature of a
trial could be allowed on the question of the Carbisdale campaign,
since it was difficult for Loudoun and<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span> Argyll
to deny a mandate for which they had the royal evidence. The
Chancellor seems to have harped on the incidents of the Highland
wars, mingled with violent denunciations of the viceroy's person.
Since his arrival in Edinburgh Montrose had been provided, probably
by the Napier ladies, with clothes worthy of his rank. When he
stood up before his accusers in Parliament, he wore a suit of fine
black cloth, with a richly laced scarlet cloak to his knee; on his
head was a black beaver hat with a silver band; and on his legs
stockings of carnation silk.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id=
"FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class=
"fnanchor">[609]</a> His bearing was modest but "unmoved and
undaunted"; his face was haggard, unshaven, and very pale,<a name=
"FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and he often sighed.
He replied to his accusers in a speech, happily preserved,<a name=
"FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> in which he repeated
the substance of his many declarations&mdash;his loyalty to the
true Covenant, his abhorrence of the Solemn League. "How far
religion has been advanced by it this poor distressed kingdom can
witness." War could not be waged without the shedding of blood, but
he had repressed all disorders as soon as they were discovered.
"Never was any man's blood spilt but in battle; and even then, many
thousand lives have I preserved. And I dare here avow, in the
presence of God, that never a hair of Scotsman's head that I could
save fell to the ground." His last campaign had been "by his
Majesty's just commands, in order to accelerate the treaty betwixt
him and you: his Majesty knowing that, whenever he had ended with
you, I was ready to retire upon his call." He asked to be judged
"by the laws of God, the laws of Nature and nations, and the laws
of this land." But he knew that the plea was vain, so he appealed
to a higher tribunal&mdash;"to the righteous Judge of the world,
who one day must be your Judge and mine, and who always gives out
rig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id=
"Page_374">[374]</a></span>hteous judgments." He had said his say;
he had fulfilled the proud boast which he had made to Parliament
nine years before: "My resolution is to carry along fidelity and
honour to the grave." His judges had no answer. Loudoun replied
with abuse, and Wariston read the sentence, which Montrose heard on
his knees. We are told that he lifted up his head as the grim words
were uttered, and looked Wariston calmly in the face.</p>
<p>He was taken back to the Tolbooth, where all day he was
tormented by ministers. According to one account, he had a talk
apart with Mr. Robert Baillie;<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id=
"FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class=
"fnanchor">[612]</a> if so, that honest and perplexed soul can
scarcely have been happy about the business, and it is remarkable
that in his voluminous writings he never mentions this final scene.
To the magistrates who visited him he said: "I think it a greater
honour to have my head standing on the ports of this town for this
quarrel, than to have my picture in the king's bedchamber. I am
beholden to you that, lest my loyalty should be forgotten, you have
appointed five of the most eminent towns to bear witness of it to
posterity."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id=
"FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class=
"fnanchor">[613]</a> The captain of the town guard was the famous
Major Weir,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id=
"FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class=
"fnanchor">[614]</a> the warlock of Edinburgh legend, who
afterwards expiated his many crimes at the stake. By his orders the
guard were always in the prisoner's room, and filled it with
tobacco smoke, which Montrose, unlike his father, could not abide.
None of his friends were allowed to come near him. Nevertheless, we
are told, in spite of fever and wounds and the imminence of death,
he continued his devotions unperturbed, and slept as peacefully as
a child. That last night, like Sir Walter Raleigh, and much in the
same strain, he, who had so long forsaken the Muse, returned to his
old love. These lines were written amid the smoke and wrangling of
the guards:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id=

<br>
<p>On Tuesday morning, the 21st of May, he rose for the last time.
Like the Spartans before Thermopyl&aelig;, he combed his long locks for
death. The usual concourse of ministers and politicians was in his
cell, and Wariston reproved him for his care of the body. "My head
is still my own," was his answer. "To-night, when it will be yours,
treat it as you please." Presently he heard the drums beating to
arms, and was told that the troops were assembling to prevent any
attempt at a rescue. He laughed and cried: "What, am I still a
terror to them? Let them look to themselves; my ghost will haunt
them."</p>
<p>He was taken about two in the afternoon by the bailies down the
High Street to the Mercat Cross, which stood between the Tolbooth
and the Tron Kirk&mdash;that dolorous road which Argyll and
Wariston and James Guthrie were themselves to travel. He still wore
the brave clothes in which he had confronted Parliament; nay, more,
he had ribbons on his shoes and fine white gloves on his hands.
James Fraser, who saw him, wrote: "He stept along the streets with
so great state, and there appeared in his countenance so much
beauty, majesty, and gravity as amazed the beholder, and many of
his enemies did acknowledge him to be the bravest subject in the
world, and in him a gallantry that braced all that crowd." Another
eyewitness, John Nicoll, the notary public, thought him more like a
bridegroom than a criminal.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id=

<p>The scaffold was a great four-square platform, breast-high, and
on it a 30-foot gallows had been erected. On the platform stood the
ministers, Mr. Robert Traill and Mr. Mungo Law, still bent on
getting a word of confession or penitence. They were disappointed,
for Montrose did not look at them. He was not allowed to address
the mob, which surged up against the edge of the scaffold&mdash;a
privilege hitherto granted to the meanest criminals; but he spoke
apart to the magistrates and to a few of the nearer spectators. A
boy called Robert Gordon<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id=
"FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class=
"fnanchor">[618]</a> sat by and took down his words in some kind of
shorthand, and the crowd, with that decency which belongs to all
simple folk, kept a reverent silence. The Estates were afraid lest
he should attack the king and spoil their game, but he spoke no
word of bitterness or reproach; rather&mdash;<i>splendide
mendax</i>&mdash;he praised Charles's justice. It was the testament
of a man conscious of his mortal frailty, but confident in the
purity of his purpose and the mercy of his God.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I am sorry if this manner of my end be scandalous to any good
Christian here. Doth it not often happen to the righteous according
to the way of the unrighteous? Doth not sometimes a just man perish
in his righteousness, and a wicked man prosper in his wickedness
and malice? They who know me should not disesteem me for this. Many
greater than I have been dealt with in this kind. But I must not
say but that all God's judgments are just, and this measure, for my
private sins, I acknowledge to be just with God, and wholly submit
myself to Him.</p>
<p>"But, in regard of man, I may say they are but instruments. God
forgive them, and I forgive them. They have oppressed the poor and

than they will reward them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377"

<p>"What I did in this kingdom was in obedience to the most just

distress, against those who rose up against him. I acknowledge
nothing, but fear God and honour the king, according to the
commandments of God and the just laws of Nature and nations. I have
not sinned against man, but against God; and with Him there is
mercy, which is the ground of my drawing near unto Him.</p>
<p>"It is objected against me by many, even good people, that I am
under the censure of the Church. This is not my fault, seeing it is
only for doing my duty, by obeying my prince's most just commands,
for religion, his sacred person, and authority. Yet I am sorry they
did excommunicate me; and in that which is according to God's laws,
without wronging my conscience or allegiance, I desire to be
relaxed. If they will not do it, I appeal to God, who is the
righteous Judge of the world, and will, I hope, be my Judge and
Saviour.</p>
<p>"It is spoken of me that I should blame the king. God forbid!
For the late king, he lived a saint and died a martyr. I pray God I
may end as he did. If ever I would wish my soul in another man's
stead, it should be in his. For his Majesty now living, never any
people, I believe, might be more happy in a king. His commandments
to me were most just, and I obeyed them. He deals justly with all
men. I pray God he be so dealt withal that he be not betrayed under
trust, as his father was.</p>
<p>"I desire not to be mistaken, as if my carriage at this time, in
relation to your ways, were stubborn. I do but follow the light of
my conscience, my rule; which is seconded by the working of the
Spirit of God that is within me. I thank Him I go to heaven with
joy the way He paved for me. If He enable me against the fear of
death, and furnish me with courage and confidence to embrace it
even in its most ugly shape, let God be glorified in my end, though
it were in my damnation. Yet I say not this out of any fear or
mistrust, but out of my duty to God, and love to His people.</p>
<p>"I have no more to say, but that I desire your charity and
prayers. I shall pray for you all. I leave my soul to God, my
service to my prince, my goodwill to my friends, my love and
charity to you all. And thus briefly I have exonerated my
conscience."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id=

<p>There is a tradition that during the morning there had been
lowering thunder-clouds and flashes of lightning, but that as
Montrose stood on the scaffold a burst of sunlight flooded the
street. When he had finished speaking, he gave money to his
executioner, and prayed silently for a little. His arms were
pinioned, and he ascended the ladder with that stately carriage
which had always marked him. His last words were: "God<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> have
mercy on this afflicted land!" Tears ran down the hangman's face as
he pushed him off, and we are told that a great sob broke from the
crowd. They had cause to sob, for that day there was done to death
such a man as his country has not seen again.</p>
<p>According to the sentence, the body was cut down after three
hours and the limbs distributed among the chief towns. The remains
in Aberdeen must have caught the eye of Charles when he arrived a
few weeks later. The trunk was buried beside the public gallows on
the Boroughmuir.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id=
"FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class=

room for the head of Argyll.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id=

<p>There was to be another funeral besides that melancholy scene by
lantern light among the marshes of the Boroughmuir. After the
Restoration, one of Charles's first acts was to give public burial
to the remains of his great captain. On January 4, 1661, the Scots
Parliament resolved on "an honourable reparation for that horrid
and monstrous barbarity in the person of the great Marquis of
Montrose."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id=
"FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class=

Boroughmuir,<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id=
"FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class=
"fnanchor">[623]</a> and the limbs gathered from the several towns,
a ceremony attended by "the honest people's loud and joyful
acclamations." The remains, wrapped in fine linen in a noble
coffin, lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id=
"Page_379">[379]</a></span> in state in the Abbey Kirk of Holyrood
from the 7th of January to the 11th of May. On the latter date took
place the great procession to St. Giles's.<a name=
"FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> First rode Sir Harry
Graham, Montrose's half-brother, carrying the arms of his house.
Then followed the Graham kinsmen with their different
standards&mdash;Duntroon, Morphie, Cairnie, Monzie, Balgowan,
Drums, Gorthie; and Black Pate of Inchbrakie, who had been with
Montrose on the August afternoon in Atholl when the curtain rose
upon his campaign, bore his insignia of the Garter. The body was
carried by fourteen earls, including the men, or the sons of the
men, who had betrayed him&mdash;such as Seaforth, and Home, and
Roxburgh, as well as old opponents like Eglinton and Callander.
Twelve viscounts and barons bore the pall, among them Strathnaver,
the son of the Sutherland who had locked the gates of the north
after Carbisdale. The young Montrose and his brother, Lord Robert,
followed the coffin, and in the procession were representatives of
almost every Scottish house. Argyll's friend and Montrose's
brother-in-law, Rollo, was there, and Marischal, who had held
Dunnottar against him, and Tweeddale, who had voted for his death.
There, too, were the faithful friends who had not failed
him&mdash;Maderty and Frendraught and the Marquis of Douglas, and
old Napier's grandson. The morning had been stormy, but as the
procession moved from Holyrood the sun shone out brightly, as it
had done at his end. The streets were lined with the trainbands,
who fired their volleys, while the cannon thundered in reply from
the castle, wherein lay Argyll under sentence of death. The nobles
of Scotland, according to their wont, had moved over to the winning
side. The pageant was an act of tardy justice, and it pleases by
its dramatic contrasts, but it had small relevance to Montrose's
true achievement. He was as little kin to the rabble of the
Restoration as to the rabble of the Covenant. The noble monument
which now marks his grave in the ancient High Kirk of Scotland is a
more fitting testimony, for it has been<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> left to
modern days to recognize the greatness of one who had no place in
his generation.</p>
<p>The fate of his heart is a curious romance, like the tale of
that ring which Marie Antoinette gave to Axel Fersen. Shortly after
the execution young Lady Napier sent her servants by night to the
grave on the Boroughmuir, and had the heart taken from the body. It
was skilfully embalmed, and placed in a little egg-shaped case of
steel made from the blade of his sword.<a name="FNanchor_625_625"
id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class=
"fnanchor">[625]</a> This in turn was enclosed in a gold filagree
box, which had been given to her husband's grandfather by a Doge of
Venice. She sent the box to the young Marquis of Montrose on the
Continent, who duly restored the heart to the body in 1661 at the
second funeral.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id=
"FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class=
"fnanchor">[626]</a> The casket after a time passed out of the
possession of the family. It was recognized in a Dutch collection
by a friend of the fifth Lord Napier, who procured it for him.
Napier bequeathed it on his death to his daughter, who had married
a Johnston of Cairnsalloch, an officer of the East India Company.
It was carried to India, and on the way out was struck by a shot in
a battle with a French squadron off Cape Verd Islands, and the gold
filagree box was shattered. But the adventures of the case were not
ended. It remained for some time in the Johnstons' house at Madura,
where the natives came to reverence it as a talisman. It was
stolen, and was purchased by the Nabob of Arcot, in whose treasury
it long lay. The young Johnston in a hunting expedition happened to
save his life, and the Nabob in gratitude restored the relic to his
family. It was brought home to Europe by the elder Johnstons in
1792, and, as they travelled overland through France, they heard of
the edict of the Revolution Government requiring the surrender of
all gold and silver trinkets. Mrs. Johnston entrusted it to an
Englishwoman at Boulogne till it<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> could be sent to England,
but the lady died soon afterwards, and in the troubled days that
followed the relic disappeared. Since then it has been lost to the
world. Some day, perhaps, an antiquary, rummaging in some back
street in a French town, may come on a casket of Indian work, and
opening it find the little egg-shaped case. It would be a precious
discovery, for it once held the dust of the bravest of Scottish
hearts.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<p>Montrose founded no school and left no successor. He was a
lonely figure in his day, and for almost two centuries his bequest
remained unnoted and unshared. Cromwell, indeed, came north into
Scotland the same year, and enforced one part of his message.
Dunbar was the avenging of Philiphaugh and Carbisdale, and the
heavy hand of the greatest of Englishmen was laid on the strange
edifice which had been built out of the rubble of the Middle Ages.
The nine years of the English occupation saw the plain man raising
his head once more. Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum was moved to tell
the Moderator of the Assembly that his wild charges were "but
undigested rhapsodies of confused nonsense,"<a name=
"FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> and none could
gainsay him. Monk bade the ministers of Perth leave politics alone
and "preach the gospel of Jesus Christ," which, the chronicler
adds, "it seems is not their business."<a name="FNanchor_629_629"
id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class=
"fnanchor">[629]</a> Wariston had the "strange thought" that, like
Hamilton and Montrose, Cromwell would ere long be brought to public
justice in Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id=
"FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class=
"fnanchor">[630]</a> but no such fate befell the great iconoclast.
He enforced his views on religious toleration, and did his best to
curb the appetite of the Kirk for witch-finding. He made an attempt
at uniting Scotland and England, reduced taxation, established free
trade with the south, took the sting out of ex-comm<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id=
"Page_383">[383]</a></span>unication by preventing any civil
penalties attending it, and finally, to the infinite comfort of the
lieges, suppressed the General Assembly. For the first time for
generations even-handed justice was done between all classes. And,
as we know from Mr. Robert Law, the spiritual life of the country,
long bound under the desolate frosts of faction, began to put forth
hopeful shoots.</p>
<p>Cromwell passed, and the king who had so cheerfully betrayed his
servant came to his own again. The old strife was renewed of nobles
and king and Kirk, and again the commons of Scotland were the
victims. One thing had indeed been gained&mdash;the impossible
theocracy had perished. The Kirk, as always happens, having asked
too much, was to get less than her due, and the spiritual liberty
which she had denied to others in her heyday was now to be denied
to herself. The later Covenanters, whose sufferings have left so
dark a memory among their countrymen, fought for a cause similar
only in name to that of their predecessors before 1660. They
resisted a despotic "bond" imposed on them by the Government to the
outraging of their consciences, as Montrose had resisted the "bond"
of Guthrie and Wariston. The men who suffered on the western
moorlands, though his name was anathema to them and they revered
his executioners, yet stood confusedly on the principles for which
he died. The best of them asked for that spiritual liberty he had
pled for, and resisted that constraining of men's consciences he
had warred against. But the evil had been wrought. Fanaticism had
raised a counter-fanaticism, and the struggle had to continue till
both were dead of their wounds. The way was prepared for the long
lack-lustre r&eacute;gime of eighteenth-century Scotland, when the Kirk
was ossified into a thing of forms and dogmas, and civil government
sank to a dull and corrupt servitude to the powers of the moment.
The spiritual fires of the Covenant had burned too murkily to be
allowed to last, and the clear flame of Montrose had gone from a
world that was not worthy of it. We can look back upon<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> that
tangled era and judge both parties without bitterness. Argyll's
monument stands close to Montrose's in St. Giles's, and the most
fervent admirer of the latter can admit the value of the tradition
bequeathed by the founders of the Kirk. But it must not be
forgotten that that tradition, which has at once educated and
ennobled their countrymen, was a by-product, and was never the
chief aim of the pre-1660 Covenanters. For that enduring work, the
liberty of the Church and the elevation of the lowliest citizen to
the dignity of an immortal soul, Montrose laboured as zealously as
they. In their declared and paramount objects, which were the
establishment of a theocracy above any civil power and an
inquisition over every man's conscience, they failed utterly, and
in their failure brought their land to the last misery and
degradation.</p>
<p>The history of Scotland was written first by the divines and
then by the Whigs, so it is small wonder that Montrose has fared
badly. A kind of literary convention arose, according to which the
most pagan of Edinburgh lawyers, when he took pen in hand, thought
it his duty to pay tribute to the Solemn League and its abettors.
It is only within recent generations that the balance has been
redressed.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id=
"FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class=
"fnanchor">[631]</a> Hagiology is not an exact science, and that of
the Covenant, born in frenzy and confusion, and nurtured in
bitterness, has not withstood the slow sapping of a fuller
knowledge and a more critical temper; yet it was able for the
better part of two centuries to hide from his countrymen the rarity
and majesty of Montrose's character. But popular tradition was more
just. The fame of the great marquis in the Lowlands seems always to
have been attended by a kind of re<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>spect. Stories of his
humanity, his beauty, and his tragic fate were handed down&mdash;a
curious interlude in a memory of blood and suffering. Lowland
legend never gave him the name of "persecutor," and he never sat at
that grim tavern-board in hell with the "fierce Middleton, and the
dissolute Rothes, and the crafty Lauderdale."<a name=
"FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> It would be strange
if he had, for these were the men who brought him to his death. To
royalist and Jacobite Scotland he became an almost mythical figure,
little understood, and valued chiefly, perhaps, as the legendary
victor over the Campbells. "The banes of a loyal and a gallant
Grahame hae long rattled in their coffin for vengeance on thae
Dukes of Guile and Lords for Lorn."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id=
"FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class=
"fnanchor">[633]</a> As for Celtic Scotland, she has taken him to
her heart. Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel "had Montrose always in his
mouth." In the account of the proceedings of the Estates on
December 3, 1689, it is recorded: "That which gave the late
Viscount of Dundee so much credit with, and authority over them,
though he understood not their language nor was of their country,
was his name and relation to the great Marquis of Montrose, for
whose memory these Highlanders have all imaginable respect and
veneration, and believe that fortune and success was entailed on
that name of Graham."<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id=
"FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class=
"fnanchor">[634]</a> To the Highlands he was their chosen knight,
the only Lowlander who has ever entered the sacred circle of Gaelic
folk-tale and song. Under him the Celt reached his apotheosis, and
for one short year held the Saxon in the hollow of his hand. Clan
rivalries have been forgotten in the homage to a racial hero. Said
an old gillie on the Beauly: "My name is Campbell, but my heart is
with the great Montrose."<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id=
"FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class=
"fnanchor">[635]</a></p>
<p>On the political side Montrose was a modern man, as modern as
Burke and Canning, and speaking a language far more intelligible to
our ears than that of the Butes and Dundases of a later Scotland.
The seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id=
"Page_386">[386]</a></span> century produced two curiously
premature characters in the great Marquis and Sir George
Mackenzie;<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id=
"FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class=
"fnanchor">[636]</a> but Mackenzie, lawyer-like, made a sharp
distinction between theory and practice, and while his theory was
modern his practice was of the Dark Ages; whereas Montrose knew no
cleavage between thoughts and deeds. Most great men have been in
advance of their day. Some have had the insight to see several
stages ahead and have tried to expedite the wheel of change; some
have thrown out ideas which were to fructify afterwards in a form
of which they did not dream. Montrose was before his time, not from
paradox or from hurry, but because almost alone in his age he
looked clearly at the conditions of all government, and, having
formed his conclusions, was not deterred by prudence or
self-interest from acting upon them. As we have seen, he was
notably free from contemporary prejudices. He had none of the
current belief in Divine Right; he had no excessive reverence for a
king as such, and very little for a nobility; he would not have
shrunk from the views of Cromwell's Ironsides as to the historical
origin of the peerage, which so scandalized the decorous soul of
Richard Baxter.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id=
"FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class=
"fnanchor">[637]</a> He was willing to accept any form of
government, provided it fulfilled the requirements which are
indispensable in all governments; and these he defined with an
acumen and a precision which cannot be challenged.</p>
<p>Statesmanship demands two gifts&mdash;the conception of wise
ends and the perception of adequate means. The first Montrose
possessed in the highest degree, the second scarcely at all. He was
a most fallible politician, and he was without skill in the game of
parliamentary intrigue. He did not read the temper of the people
with the accuracy of Argyll, or the possibilities of the moment
with the profound sagacity of Cromwell. He was an optimist about
his dreams; he saw the Lowland peasantry looking for a deliverer,
when they regarded him as a destroyer; he did not understand the
dep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id=
"Page_387">[387]</a></span>ths of the antipathy of Saxon to Celt,
or how fatally the use of Alasdair's men prejudiced his cause; he
looked for loyalty in quarters which knew only self-interest, and
courage among those who had it not. Practical statesmanship works
essentially by compromises, accepting the second or third best as
an instalment, and by slow degrees leading the people to acquiesce
in an ideal which they have come to regard as their own creation.
It must judge shrewdly the situation of the moment, and know
precisely what elements therein are capable of providing the first
stage in the great advance. It must have infinite patience, and
infinite confidence in the slow processes of time.</p>
<p>Such a gift Montrose did not possess&mdash;indeed it may be
questioned whether the problem before his age permitted of such
evolutionary methods. There was no material to his hand in the
shape of a nation at least partially instructed or a group of
like-minded colleagues. But he was a statesman, if it be the part
of statesmanship to see far ahead and to stand for the hope of the
future. He stood for the Scottish democracy against those who would
have crushed it and those who betrayed it with a kiss. In views and
temperament it is not easy to find his parallel. He had
Marlborough's contemptuous superiority to parties, but he lacked
his passionless Olympian calm. With his kinsman
Claverhouse&mdash;<i>Montrosio novus exoritur de pulvere
phoenix</i><a name="FNanchor_638_638" id=
"FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class=
"fnanchor">[638]</a>&mdash;he had little in common except the power
of leadership. There is some resemblance to Ireton in political
creed, in his scorn of abstractions, and his belief in the need of
a strong central government, monarchical, parliamentary, or
both;<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> he shared the same
view with Strafford, but, unlike him, he did not come to regard
monarchical and parliamentary authority as mutually exclusive. He
never relinquished his doctrine of a just balance, and if in his
last years he was compelled to put the emphasis on the royal power,
it was for the same reason as Sir Thomas More was forced into
opposition to Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id=
"Page_388">[388]</a></span> VIII&mdash;because the balance had been
unduly depressed.</p>
<p>The truest kinship is perhaps with the troubled humanity of
Cromwell. The Lord Protector fought for "the poor godly people";
Montrose for the plain folk without any qualification. Both were
tolerant, both were idealists, striving for something which their
age could not give them. Montrose had one obstacle in his way above
all others, and that was Scotland. Her jealous nationalism was not
ripe, even had the century been ripe, for his far-sighted good
sense. She was still hugging to her breast her own fantastic
creations, her covenants, her barren survivals, her peculiar
royalism, still prepared to sacrifice peace and fortune to her
pride. If Cromwell shipwrecked upon the genial materialism of
England, Montrose split upon the rock of the sterile conservatism
of his own land. Scotland was not ready for civic ideals or
luminous reason. She had not found the self-confidence which was to
give her a far truer and deeper national pride. She had still to
tread for long years the path of coarse and earthy compromises, lit
by flashes of crazy quixotry, till through suffering and poverty
she came at last to find her own soul. Montrose was in advance of
his age, he was in advance of England at her best, but he was
utterly and eternally beyond the ken of seventeenth-century
Scotland. Yet of the two great idealists he has had the happier
destiny. Cromwell, brilliantly successful for the moment, built
nothing which lasted. Except for his doctrine of toleration, he
left no heritage of political thought which the world has used. The
ideals of Montrose, on the other hand, are in the warp and woof of
the constitutional fabric of to-day.</p>
<p>The moderate man is slow to appeal to arms. He sees too clearly
the values on both sides to commit himself readily to that
desperate hazard. But in a revolution it may be the only way. If
men's passions are deeply stirred there must be recourse to the
last and sternest arbitrament. In such a crisis it is the soldier
who turns the scale, whether it be C&aelig;sar's army of Gaul, or the
Puritan New Model, or Washington's militia, or<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Napoleon's Grande Arm&eacute;e, or Garibaldi's Thousand, or Lincoln's
citizen levies. A Holles or a Vane may dream his dreams, but it is
Cromwell who brings his into being. Montrose both courted and
warred against revolution. He desired to preserve the monarchy as
against its anarchical assailants, but he was as ardent a
revolutionary as Lilburne in his crusade against the existing
r&eacute;gime in Scotland, with its dull tyranny of kirk and nobles. For
there is a moderation which is in itself a fire, where enthusiasm
burns as fiercely for the whole truth as it commonly does for
half-truths, where toleration becomes not a policy but an act of
religion. Such inspired moderation is usually found in an age of
violent contraries. Henri IV. of France possessed it, as did
William the Silent. Montrose, like Henri, was the supreme moderate
of his age; and, like Henri, he realized that it needs a fiery soul
to enforce moderation in a rabble of fanatics and debauchees. In
such a strife, the ultimate word can only be spoken by one who is
willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. To enter into the kingdom
of the spirit a man must take his life in his hands, as martyr or
as soldier.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>As a soldier Montrose ranks by common consent with the greatest
of his age, with Cromwell and Cond&eacute;. The historian of the British
army has described him as "perhaps the most brilliant natural
military genius disclosed by the Civil War."<a name=
"FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Like Cromwell, he
seems to have learned his art rather by intuition than by
experience, for, till his great campaign, his only training was the
inglorious Bishops' War. He had never, like Leven or David Leslie,
served under eminent foreign generals; he was as unprofessional as
Rupert, and, like him, he had that natural eye for country and
dispositions, that power of quick resolution and that
magnetism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id=
"Page_390">[390]</a></span> of leadership, which discomfited the
more prosaic commanders who found themselves his opponents. He had
learned the lesson of which his friend, the Cardinal de Retz, has
given a famous epitome: "Il n'y a rien dans le monde qui n'ait son
moment d&eacute;cisif; et le chef-d'oeuvre de la bonne conduite est de
conna&icirc;tre et de prendre ce moment."</p>
<p>It has been sometimes urged that it is easy to overpraise
Montrose's military capacity, since he usually fought against
inferior troops and incompetent generals, and that on the only
occasion on which he met a commander of ability and a seasoned army
he was defeated. But the argument does not bear examination. The
men he scattered at Tippermuir and Aberdeen were, it is true, raw
levies, though present in great numerical superiority; but they
were precisely the men with whom he had been victorious in his
first campaign, and his conquering Highlanders were of the race
which he had routed in 1639, when they fought under Aboyne. At
Inverlochy he had against him the best disciplined of the Highland
clans, and Auchinbreck had ten times his own experience of war. At
Dundee and Auldearn and Alford he faced regular cavalry and foot,
the pick of the men who had won renown under Leven in England; and
Hurry and Baillie had a high repute among the commanders of the
day. Philiphaugh and Carbisdale are too much unlike normal battles
to be made the basis for any judgment of one side or the other. No
doubt Montrose's Highland and Irish troops, nourished on beef and
game, were of a more stalwart physical type than the Lowland second
line. But the regular Covenant foot were stout fellows, and they
had the priceless advantage of a strict discipline and freedom from
the endless clan jealousies. So far as equipment went, Montrose won
his victories in the face of crushing odds. His army was always a
fluid thing; after every success a large part of it departed with
their booty to their homes; more than half his time was spent in
the work of shepherding back to his standard the volatile
clans.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Under such
conditions it is hard to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span> plan of campaign, and
harder still to execute it.</p>
<p>As a strategist he showed an extraordinary eye for country. The
tangled passes of the Grampians, little known except in patches to
the different clans, were grasped by him as a geographical whole,
and he arranged his marches accordingly. He had a boldness, too,
which staggered even those inured to mountain warfare, and his
flank march before Inverlochy seemed both to friends and foes
outside the limits of human power. His incredible speed was a
further strategical advantage, for he could march over twenty miles
in a single night among snowy mountains, as in his pursuit of
Argyll in December 1644; or in thirty-six hours cover sixty miles,
with fighting between, as at Dundee. This swiftness, indeed, was
apt to be a snare to him. He despised his slower antagonists, and
was twice almost caught&mdash;at Fyvie and Dundee&mdash;before the
final surprise came at Philiphaugh. For strategy in the widest
sense he was given no scope. He could not plan a campaign to
correspond with the king's in England, for his hands were tied by
the composition of his army; his Highlanders would not fight south
of the Highland Line, and deserted in droves after each victory. In
such circumstances there could be no continuity of purpose, and the
marvel is that Kilsyth was ever fought. But it is clear that
Montrose was fully alive to the need of the larger strategical
intention, and that it was only the lack of response from the
English side that confined him to mountain warfare. With a force
such as Charles repeatedly frittered away, he would have swept
these islands from Sutherland to Devon.</p>
<p>In tactics he had in a supreme degree the gift of suiting his
scheme of battle to his material, using his horse now as mounted
infantry and now as cavalry, and getting full value from the
impetuous Highland charge. His power of rapid decision never failed
him, and in the stress of fight he could keep his head<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> and
alter his arrangements at the shortest notice. As proofs, we have
the sudden strengthening of the left wing at Aberdeen, and his
rapid dispositions in the hurry of the surprise before Auldearn, as
well as the marvellous retreat from Dundee. At leisure he could
dispose a battle with great skill, as at Alford, and could defy the
ordinary rules of war with success, as at Kilsyth. Kilsyth is,
indeed, an interesting case, for there is every reason to believe
that Montrose deliberately chose what seemed to be the worse
position. He was probably convinced that the Covenanters, finding
themselves with the hill in their favour, would take some foolish
risk and so play into his hands, and he counted on the power of his
Highlanders to charge up a slope and arrive unwearied at the top.
He knew, too, the value of the sudden word in the strain of battle
to turn the tide, and his insight into the hearts of fighting men
was at least as great a factor in his success as his tactical
skill.</p>
<p>More notable than even his gifts for strategy and tactics was
his unique power of leadership. He discerned the fighting value of
the clans, and welded into an army the most heterogeneous materials
on earth. Hitherto it had seemed impossible to band two minor septs
together for one purpose for more than a week; Montrose united the
whole central Highlands in a campaign of a year's duration. Nor did
he win this strange authority by any pandering to the vices of
savage warfare. Except for the sack of Aberdeen, there is no stain
on his record. He refused to turn the captured cannon on the
fugitives at Tippermuir; he tried to check the slaughter after
Inverlochy; he punished looting severely, as at Glasgow; he
observed scrupulously the etiquette of war; he never put a prisoner
to death, not even when his dearest friends were being murdered by
the Estates. He did not stoop, as his opponents did, to the methods
of the dirk and the ambuscade. It should be remembered that he was
no fire-eating giant like Alasdair, but a slim young man of middle
height, somewhat grave and courtly in his manner, and fonder of a
book than a drinking-bout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393"
id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>. Yet no iron-fisted Hercules ever
kept a wilder force in a sterner discipline. The man who, at
Dundee, could draw off half-tipsy troops in the middle of a sack in
the face of a superior enemy, and lead them, weary as they were,
for thirty miles in the thick of night to the safety of the hills,
had miraculous gifts as a leader. We may search for long in the
annals of war to find an equal achievement.</p>
<p>Cromwell also had that moral authority which fused the forces
under him into a single weapon for his hand to direct. But
Cromwell, except at Dunbar, fought with numbers on his side, and he
had the supreme advantage that his men were largely bound already
by the tie of a strong religious faith. For Montrose there was no
such aid to discipline. It was personal authority, and personal
authority alone, that kept Gordon and Macdonald in the same firing
line. The two great captains were fated never to meet, and their
relative prowess must remain in the realm of hypothesis. The chief
historian of the epoch rates Montrose the higher. "On the
battlefield Montrose had all Cromwell's promptness of seizing the
chances of the strife, together with a versatility in varying his
tactics according to the varying resources of the enemy, to which
Cromwell could lay no claim, while his skill as a strategist was
certainly superior to that of his English contemporary."<a name=
"FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Probably the
judgment is just. At any rate, we can say that Montrose performed
feats not inferior to Cromwell's best, with weaker resources and
against greater odds.</p>
<p>Scale must not be confused with kind. Since Montrose's day the
technical equipment of the soldier has been inconceivably enlarged,
armies have grown into armed nations, the advance in the variety
and precision of weapons has made every problem more intricate. But
modern inventions, which make levies of millions possible, have
provided in an equal ratio the facilities for leading them.
Military genius remains in its essentials the same, and it is still
possible in this respect to compare the soldiers of all ages, and
to ra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id=
"Page_394">[394]</a></span>nk one who commanded a few thousands in
a moorland war among the masters of the art. In virtue of his
achievement, Montrose must stand as the foremost Scottish man of
action&mdash;perhaps the only Scot who approaches the confines of
that small inner circle of the profession of arms, which, among men
of our own blood, contains no other names than Marlborough,
Wellington, and Lee.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>Few careers have such romantic unity. In one aspect he is the
complete paladin, full of courtesy and grace, a Volcker of Alsace
with his sword-fiddlebow, whose every stroke is a note of music. He
wins fights against odds, and scribbles immortal songs in his
leisure, and dies in the end like some antique hero, with the
lights burning low in the skies and the stage darkened. In another
he is the thinker, who read, as no one else did, the riddle of his
times, and preached a doctrine of government which had to wait for
nearly two hundred years till it found an audience. In that fierce
seventeenth century, when men died for half-truths or less, when
the great forces of the State were apt to be selfish competitors
for material gain, and the idealists were driven into the wilds or
overseas&mdash;in that gross and turbid age he lit the lamp of pure
duty and pure reason. There were those who followed duty, but it
was too often blindly. There were those who loved reason, but they
either retired from the struggle or, like Falkland, fought with the
air of martyrs rather than of soldiers. Montrose was armed and
mailed Reason, Philosophy with its sword unsheathed. He is a far
rarer type than the quietist who has fascinated historians, or than
the grim Ironside, "the most formidable of combinations, the
practical mystic." He had all the grave lucidity of a Falkland, but
he had none of his sad despair, for he went out joyfully to do
battle for his faith. He was as stubborn and passionate in his
cause as any Ironside, but he was no fanatic; he was not even any
kind of mystic. He saw life clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span> and calmly, and his
spiritual force did not come, as it often comes, from a hectic
imagination or a fevered brain. The springs of his being were a
pellucid reasonableness of soul, joined to a power of absorption in
duty which is commonly found only in the ranks of fanaticism.</p>
<p>It is a figure which must always haunt those who travel the
rough roads of Scottish history. We see him in the brave clothes
which still dazzle us in his portraits, the long, north-country
face, the broad brow, the inscrutable grey eyes. He is thinking,
wondering, brooding on the needs of his land, while others are
preying on them. Then he reaches his conclusions, and, with
something between the certainty of the thinker and the enthusiasm
of the boy, he sets out on his desperate errand. We see him in
battle, a flush on his cheek, a youthful ardour in his eye, but his
mouth set like iron. We see him among his friends, conquering all
hearts with his wit and grace. We see him in triumph and in
failure, careless of self, his course set unfalteringly towards his
dreams, carrying, in Keats's words, "an awful warmth about his
heart like a load of immortality." He is always very human, very
much the man, for Alasdair and his kerns would never have followed
the ordinary dreamer. And then, when the last blow has been struck,
he has neither fears nor reproaches. Clearly and reasonably he
states his defence, and when it is flouted and he is condemned to a
shameful death, he takes it meekly, knowing something of the
fallibility of mankind. The Edinburgh mob is awed into a hush by
his appearance; his enemies declared that it was his fine clothes
and noble looks; more truly we may read it as that inward vision
which is the beatitude of the pure in heart.</p>
<p>No great cause is ever lost or ever won. The battle must always
be renewed and the creed restated, and the old formulas, once so
potent a revelation, become only dim antiquarian echoes. But some
things are universal, catholic, and undying&mdash;the souls of
which such formulas are the broken gleams. These do not
age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id=
"Page_396">[396]</a></span> or pass out of fashion, for they
symbolize eternal things. They are the guardians of the freedom of
the human spirit, the proof of what our mortal frailty can achieve.
Of this happy company Montrose is one. His qualities in the
retrospect seem to be drawn to a fine edge of burning light. But,
as we wonder and revere, there comes a voice from behind the flame,
and awe is changed to wistfulness; for it is a voice of comradeship
and joy and youth which "sweetly torments us with invitations to
his own inaccessible homes."</p>

"fnanchor">[643]</a></h3>
<p class="first">"<span class="smcap">Noble Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the letter you did me the honour to send me, you move a
question in two words, to give a satisfactory answer to which
requires works and volumes, not letters. Besides, the matter is of
so sublime and transcendant a nature as is above my reach, and not
fit for subjects to meddle with&mdash;if it were not to do right to
sovereign power in a time when so much is said and done to the
disgrace and derogation of it. Nevertheless, to obey your desire, I
will deliver my opinion: First, concerning the nature, essential
parts, and practice of the supreme power in government of all
sorts. Secondly, I will shew wherein the strength and weakness
thereof consists, and the effects of both. Thirdly, I will answer
some arguments and false positions maintained by the impugners of
royal power; and that without partiality, and as briefly as I
can:</p>
<p>"1. Civil societies, so pleasing to Almighty God, cannot subsist
without government, nor government without a sovereign power, to
force obedience to laws and just commands, to dispose and direct
private endeavours to public ends, and to unite and incorporate the
several members into one body politic, that with joint endeavours
and abilities they may the better advance the public good. This
sovereignty is a power over the people; above which power there is
none upon earth; whose acts cannot be rescinded by any other;
instituted by God, for His glory and the temporal and eternal
happiness of men. This is it that is recorded so oft, by the wisdom
of ancient times, to be sac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398"
id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>red and inviolable; the truest image
and representation of the power of Almighty God upon earth; not to
be bounded, disputed, meddled with at all by subjects; who can
never handle it, though never so warily, but it is thereby wounded,
and the public peace disturbed. Yet it is limited by the laws of
God and Nature; and some laws of nations; and by the fundamental
laws of the country; which are those upon which sovereign power
itself resteth, in prejudice of which a king can do nothing; and
those also which secure to the good subject his honour, his life,
and the property of his goods.</p>
<p>This power&mdash;not speaking of those who are kings in name
only, and in effect but <i>Principes Nobilitatis</i> or <i>Duces
Belli</i>, nor of the arbitrary and despotic power, where one is
head and all the rest slaves, but of that which is sovereign over
all free subjects&mdash;is still one and the same, in points
essential, wherever it be, whether in the person of a monarch, or
in a few principal men, or in the Estates of the people. The
essential points of sovereignty are these: To make laws; to create
principal officers; to make peace and war; to give grace to men
condemned by law; and to be the last to whom appellation is made.
There be others, too, which are comprehended in those set down; but
because majesty doeth not so clearly shine in them they are here
omitted. These set down are inalienable, indivisible,
incommunicable, and belong to the sovereign power primitively in
all sorts of governments. They cannot subsist in a body composed of
individuities; and if they be divided amongst several bodies, there
is no government; as if there were many kings in one kingdom, there
should be none at all; for whosoever should have one of these, were
able to erase their proceedings who have all the rest; for the
having them negative and prohibitive in that part to him belonging,
might render the acts of all the others invalid, and there would be
a superiority to the supreme, and an equality to the sovereign
power, which cannot fall in any man's conceit that hath common
sense; in speech it is incongruity, and to attempt it in act is
pernicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id=
"Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>
<p>"Having in some measure expressed the nature of supreme power,
it shall be better known by the actual practice of all nations, in
all the several sorts of government, as well Republics and
Monarchies.</p>
<p>"The people of Rome&mdash;who were masters of policy, and war
too, and to this day are made patterns of both&mdash;being an
Estate popular, did exercise, without controlment or opposition,
all the forenamed points essential to supreme power. No law was
made but by the people; and though the Senate did propone and
advise a law to be made, it was the people that gave it sanction;
and it received the force of law from their command and authority,
as may appear by the respective phrases of the
propounder&mdash;<i>Quod faustum felixque sit, vobis populoque
Romano velitis jubeatis</i>. The people used these imperative
words, <i>Esto sunto</i>; and if it were refused, the Tribune of
the people expressed it with a <i>veto</i>. The propounder or
adviser of the law was said <i>rogare legem</i>, and the people
<i>jubere legem</i>. The election of officers was only made by the
people, as appears by the ambitious buying and begging of
suffrages, so frequent among them upon the occasions. War and peace
was ever concluded by them, and never denounced but by their
<i>Feciales</i> and with commission from them. They only gave grace
and pardon; and for the last refuge, delinquents, and they who were
wronged by the sentence of judges and officers, <i>provocabant ad
populum</i>.</p>
<p>"So it was in Athens, and to this day among the Switzers and
Grissons, the Estate of Holland, and all Estates popular. In
Venice, which is a pure aristocracy, laws, war, peace, election of
officers, pardon and appellation, are all concluded and done in
<i>Conciglio maggiore</i>, which consists of principal men who have
the sovereignty. As for the <i>Pregadi</i>, and the <i>Conciglio di
dieci</i>, they were but officers and executors of their power; and
the duke is nothing but the idol to whom ceremonies and compliments
are addressed, without the least part of sovereignty. So it was in
Sparta; so it is in Lucca, Genoa, and Ragusa, and all other
Aristocracies; and, indeed, cannot be otherwise without the
subversion of the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id=
"Page_400">[400]</a></span>sent government.</p>
<p>"If, then, the lords in Republics have that power essential to
sovereignty, by what reason can it be denied to a prince in whose
person only, and primitively, resteth the sovereign power, and from
whom all lawful subaltern power, as from the fountain, is
derived?</p>
<p>"2. This power is strong and durable when it is temperate; and
it is temperate when it is possessed (with the essential parts
aforesaid) with moderation, and limitation by the laws of God, of
Nature, and the fundamental laws of the country. It is weak when it
is restrained of these essential parts; and it is weak also when it
is extended beyond the laws whereby it is bounded; which could
never be any time endured by the people of the western part of the
world, and by those of Scotland as little as any. For that which
Galba said of his Romans is the humour of them all&mdash;<i>nec
totam libertatem nec totam servitutem pati possunt</i>&mdash;but a
temper of both. Unwise princes endeavour the extension of
it&mdash;rebellious and turbulent subjects the restraint. Wise
princes use it moderately; but most desire to extend it, and that
humour is fomented by advice of courtiers and bad counsellors, who
are of a hasty ambition, and cannot abide the slow progress of
riches and preferments in a temperate government. They persuade the
arbitrary with reflexion on their own ends; knowing that the
exercise thereof shall be put upon them, whereby they shall be able
quickly to compass their ends; robbing thereby the people of their
wealth, the king of the people's love due to him, and of the honour
and reputation of wisdom. The effects of a moderate government are
religion, justice, and peace; flourishing love of the subjects
towards their prince, in whose hearts he reigns; durableness and
strength against foreign invasions and intestine sedition;
happiness and security to king and people. The effect of a prince's
power too far extended is tyranny&mdash;from the king, if he be
ill; if he be good, tyranny or a fear of it from them to whom he
hath entrusted the managing of public affairs. The effect of the
royal power restra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id=
"Page_401">[401]</a></span>ined is the oppression and tyranny of
subjects; the most fierce, insatiable, and insupportable tyranny in
the world; where every man of power oppresseth his neighbour,
without any hope of redress from a prince despoiled of his power to
punish oppressors.</p>
<p>The people under an extended power are miserable, but most
miserable under the restrained power. The effects of the former may
be cured by good advice; satiety in the prince; or fear of infamy;
or the pains of writers; or by some event which may bring a prince
to the sense of his errors; and when nothing else can do it, seeing
the prince is mortal, patience is a sovereign and dangerless remedy
in the subject; who in wisdom and duty is obliged to tolerate the
vices of his prince as they do storms and tempests, and other
natural evils which are compensated with better times succeeding.
It had been better for Germany to have endured the encroachments of
Ferdinand, and after his death rectified them before they had made
a new election, than to have brought it to desolation, and shed so
much Christian blood by unseasonable remedies and opposition. But
when a king's lawful power is restrained, the politic body is in
such desperate estate that it can neither endure the disease, nor
the remedy, which is force only. For princes' lawful power is only
restrained by violence, and never repaired but by violence on the
other side; which can produce nothing but ruin to prince or people,
or rather to both. Patience in the subject is the best remedy
against the effects of a prince's power too far extended; but when
it is too far restrained, patience in the prince is so far from
being a remedy, that it formeth and increaseth the disease; for
patience, tract of time, and possession, makes that which was at
first robbery, by a body that never dies, at last a good title, and
the government comes at last to be changed.</p>
<p>"To procure a temperate and moderate government, there is much
in the king and not a little in the people. For let a prince
command never so well, if there be not a correspondent obedience
there is no temper. It is not the people's part, towards that end,
to take upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id=
"Page_402">[402]</a></span> them to limit and circumscribe royal
power; it is Jupiter's thunder which never subject handled well
yet; not the people's part to determine what is due to a prince,
what to his people. It requires more than human sufficiency to go
so even a way betwixt the prince's prerogative, and the subject's
privilege, as to content both, or be just in itself. For they can
never agree upon the matter; and where it hath been attempted, as
in some places it hath, the sword did ever determine the question,
which is to be avoided by all possible means. But there is a fair
and justifiable way for subjects to procure a moderate government,
incumbent to them in duty; which is, to endeavour the security of
Religion and just Liberties, the matter on which the exorbitancy of
a prince's power doth work; which being secured, his power must
needs be temperate, and run in the even channel.</p>
<p>"'But,' it may be demanded, 'how shall the people's just
liberties be preserved if they be not known, and how known if they
be not determined to be such?' It is answered, the laws contain
them; and the Parliaments, which ever have been the bulwarks of
subjects' liberties in monarchies, may advise new laws against
emergent occasions which prejudge their liberties; and so leave it
to occasion, and not prevent it by foolish haste in Parliaments,
which breeds contention, and disturbance to the quiet of the State.
And if Parliaments be frequent, and rightly constituted, what
favourite counsellor or statesman dare misinform or mislead a king
to the prejudice of a subject's liberty, knowing he must answer it
upon the peril of his head and estate at the next ensuing
Parliament, and that he shall put the king to an hard choice for
him, either to abandon him to justice, or, by protecting him,
displease the estates of his kingdom? And if the king should be so
ill advised as to protect him, yet he doth not escape punishment
that is branded with a mark of public infamy, declared enemy to the
State, and incapable of any good amongst them.<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>
<p>3. "The perpetual cause of the controversies, between the prince
and his subjects, is the ambitious designs of rule in great men,
veiled under the specious pretext of Religion and the subject's
Liberties, seconded with the arguments and false positions of
seditious preachers: 1st, that the king is ordained for the people,
and the end is more noble than the mean; 2nd, that the constituter
is superior to the constituent; 3rd, that the king and people are
two contraries, like the two scales of a balance&mdash;when the one
goes up the other goes down; 4th, that the prince's prerogative and
the people's privilege are incompatible; 5th, what power is taken
from the king is added to the Estates of the people. This is the
language of the spirits of division that walk betwixt the king and
his people, to separate them whom God hath conjoined; which must
not pass without some answer; to slide upon which sandy ground
these giants, who war against the gods, have builded their
Babel.</p>
<p>"To the 1st: It is true that the true and utmost ends of men's
actions, which is the glory of God and felicity of men, are to be
preferred to all means directed thereunto. But there is not that
order of dignity among the means themselves, or mid instruments
compounded together. If it were so, and a man appointed to keep
sheep, or a nobleman to be tutor-in-law to a pupil of meaner
quality, the sheep should be preferred to the man, and the pupil to
his tutor. To the 2nd: He that constituteth so as he still
retaineth the power to reverse his constitution, is superior to the
constituted in that respect; but if his donation and constitution
is absolute and without condition, devolving all his power in the
person constituted, and his successors, what before was voluntary
becomes necessary. It is voluntary to a woman to chuse such an one
for her husband, and to a people what king they will at first; both
being once done, neither can the woman nor the people free
themselves, from obedience and subjection to the husband and the
prince, when they please. To the 3rd: In a politic consideration,
the king and his people are not two, but one body politic, whereof
the king is the head. And so far are they from contrariety, and
opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id=
"Page_404">[404]</a></span> motions, that there is nothing good or
ill for the one which is not just so for the other. If their ends
and endeavours be divers, and never so little eccentric, either
that king inclineth to tyranny, or that people to
disloyalty&mdash;if they be contrary, it is mere tyranny or mere
disloyalty. To the 4th: The king's prerogative and the subject's
privilege are so far from incompatibility, that the one can never
stand unless supported by the other. For the sovereign being
strong, and in full possession of his lawful power and prerogative,
is able to protect his subjects from oppression, and maintain their
liberties entire; otherwise, not. On the other side, a people,
enjoying freely their just liberties and privileges, maintaineth
the prince's honour and prerogative out of the great affection they
carry towards him; which is the greatest strength against foreign
invasion, or intestine insurrection, that a prince can possibly be
possessed with. To the 5th: It is a mere fallacy; for what is
essential to one thing cannot be given to another. The eye may lose
its sight, the ear its hearing, but can never be given to the hand,
or foot, or any other member; and, as the head of the natural body
may be deprived of invention, judgment, or memory, and the rest of
the members receive no part thereof, so subjects, not being capable
of the essential parts of government properly and primitively
belonging to the prince, those being taken from him, they can never
be imparted to them, without change of the government and the
essence and being of the same. When a king is restrained from the
lawful use of his power, and subjects can make no use of
it&mdash;as under a king they cannot&mdash;what can follow but a
subversion of government&mdash;anarchy and confusion?</p>
<p>"Now, to any man that understands these things only, the
proceedings of these times may seem strange, and he may expostulate
with us thus:</p>
<p>"Noblemen and gentlemen of good quality, what do you mean? Will
you teach the peop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id=
"Page_405">[405]</a></span>le to put down the Lord's anointed, and
lay violent hands on his authority to whom both you and they owe
subjection, and assistance with your goods, lives, and fortunes, by
all the laws of God and man? Do ye think to stand and domineer over
the people, in an aristocratic way&mdash;the people who owe you
small or no obligation? It is you, under your natural prince, that
get all employment pregnant of honour or profit, in peace or war.
You are the subjects of his liberality; your houses decayed, either
by merit or his grace and favour are repaired, without which you
fall in contempt; the people, jealous of their liberty, when you
deserve best, to shelter themselves will make you shorter by the
head, or serve you with an ostracism. If their first act be against
kingly power, their next act will be against you. For if the people
be of a fierce nature, they will cut your throats; as the Switzers
did of old; you shall be contemptible; as some of ancient houses
are in Holland, their very burgomaster is the better man; your
honours&mdash;life&mdash;fortunes stand at the discretion of a
seditious preacher!</p>
<p>"And you, ye meaner people of Scotland&mdash;who are not capable
of a Republic, for many grave reasons&mdash;why are you induced by
specious pretexts, to your own heavy prejudice and detriment, to be
instruments of others' ambition? Do ye not know, when the
monarchical government is shaken, the great ones strive for the
garland with <i>your</i> blood and <i>your</i> fortunes? Whereby
you gain nothing; but, instead of a race of kings who have governed
you two thousand years with peace and justice, and have preserved
your liberties against all domineering nations, shall purchase to
yourselves vultures and tigers to reign over your posterity; and
yourselves shall endure all those miseries, massacres, and
proscriptions of the Triumvirate of Rome, (till) the kingdom fall
again into the hands of One, who of necessity must, and for reason
of State will, tyrannize over you. For kingdoms acquired by blood
and violence are by the same means retained.</p>
<p>"And you great men&mdash;if any such be among you so blinded
with ambition&mdash;who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406"
id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>aim so high as the crown, do you
think we are so far degenerate from the virtue, valour, and
fidelity to our true and lawful sovereign, so constantly
entertained by our ancestors, as to suffer you, with all your
policy, to reign over us? Take heed you be not Aesop's dog, and
lose the cheese for the shadow in the well.</p>
<p>"And thou, seditious preacher, who studies to put the
sovereignty in the people's hands for thy own ambitious
ends&mdash;as being able, by thy wicked eloquence and hypocrisy, to
infuse into them what thou pleasest&mdash;know this, that this
people is more incapable of sovereignty than any other known. Thou
art abused like a pedant by the nimble-witted nobleman. Go, go
along with them to shake the present government; not for thy ends
to possess the people with it, but, as a cunning tennis-player lets
the ball go to the wall, where it cannot stay, that he may take it
at the bound with more ease.</p>
<p>"And whereas a durable peace with England&mdash;which is the
wish and desire of all honest men&mdash;is pretended, surely it is
a great solecism in us to aim at an end of peace with them, and
overthrow the only means for that end. It is the King's Majesty's
sovereignty over both that unites us in affection, and is only able
to reconcile questions among us when they fall. To endeavour the
dissolution of that bond of our union is nowise to establish a
durable peace; but rather to procure enmity and war betwixt
bordering nations, where occasions of quarrel are never wanting,
nor men ever ready to take hold of them.</p>
<p>"Now, sir, you have my opinion concerning your desire, and that
which I esteem truth set down nakedly for your use, not adorned for
public view. And if zeal for my Sovereign and Country have
transported me a little too far, I hope you will excuse the errors
proceeding from so good a cause of</p>

wrote of him: "I have known clearness of judgment and largeness of
fancy; strength of reason and graceful elocution; a courage for the
war and fear for the laws: and all eminently in one man." This
"fear for the laws" was a Cavalier characteristic too often

was also, of course, an economic basis, but I think that Mr. R. H.
Tawney (<i>Religion and the Rise of Capitalism</i>, 235)
overestimates it, at least so far as concerns the first forty years
of the seventeenth century, though what he says is true of
post-Restoration nonconformity. The clash was far more one of
theories than of "contradicting economic interests and incompatible
conceptions of social expediency."</p>

too often assumed that Scottish Presbytery was a wholesale
borrowing from Geneva. As a matter of fact, while professing to
follow only the Scriptures, it was highly composite in origin.
"There is evidence of the formative influences of Lambert's Hessian
constitution, of the Swiss, and especially of the Genevan
reformation, of the foreign churches of a'Lasco and Pullain in
England, with some slight influence of the Edwardian Church of
England itself, and of close study of the new French ecclesiastical
polity." See Miss J. G. Macgregor, <i>The Scottish Presbyterian
Polity: a Study of its Origins</i>, Edinburgh, 1926; and F. W.

king was present (<i>A. P. S.</i>, V., 399). The comprehensive list
of offences indemnified, which included "all manner of burnings and
the putting of persons to torture and death," sheds some light upon
his doings. At his trial in 1661 he denied ordering the burning of
Forthar, but his instructions to his lieutenant are extant
(Gardiner, IX., 167, <i>n.</i> 3. <i>Hist. MSS. Comm.</i>, 6th
Report, 616). Sir James Balfour (II., 380-381) says that the
expedition was conducted with an exact discipline, but there may be
disciplined barbarism. For the treatment of Lady Ogilvy, the chief
authority is Gordon of Rothiemay (III., 165), who, however, gets
his dates into confusion. In this kind of war many atrocities must
occur, and many more will be invented. The popular mind, as shown
in the ballad of The <i>Bonnie House o' Airlie</i>, had no doubts
on the subject. For Montrose's behaviour, see Lord Ogilvy's answer
to interrogatories, and the libel against Montrose in 1641. <i>Mem.

is Mr. Lang's view, III., 99. The depositions taken at the inquiry
may be read in <i>Hist. MSS. Comm.</i>, 4th Report, 163-170. See
also Balfour, III., 94-137. In the first edition of Clarendon's
<i>History</i> (Oxford, 1702-4), Montrose is accused of offering to
the king, at a private interview, to make away with Hamilton and
Argyll (see Macray's ed., IV., c. 20). This story was repeated by
most historians, though discredited by Hume on general grounds. The
passage, so inconsistent with Clarendon's general view of Montrose,
seems to have been some rough notes for his <i>Life</i>, which
somehow became mixed up with the <i>History</i>, based perhaps, as
Mr. Gardiner suggests, on the confusion of Montrose and Crawford.
In an appendix to the new edition of Clarendon, collated with the
original MSS. in the Bodleian, and published in 1826, a revised
version of the story is given which exonerates Montrose. This
Clarendon perhaps intended to replace the faulty passage. See
Napier, I., 359-363. Gardiner, X., 26. For William Murray, see

"I doubt sometimes some of our dogmata and notions about
Justification may puff us up in far higher and goodlier conceits of
ourselves than God hath of us; and that we profanely make the
unspotted righteousness of Christ to serve only as a covering
wherein to wrap up our foul deformities and filthy vices; and when
we have done, think ourselves in as good credit and repute with God
as we are with ourselves; and that we are become heaven's darlings
as much as we are our own. . . . God respects not a bold,
confident, and audacious faith that is big with nothing but its own
presumptions. . . . It is not all our strong dreams of being in
favour with heaven, it is not a pertinacious imagination of our
name being enrolled in the book of life, or of the debt-books of
heaven being crossed, or of Christ being ours, or of the washing
away of our sins in His blood . . . it is not, I say, a
pertinacious imagination of any of these that can make us the
better."&mdash;<i>Discourse of Legal and Evangelical

misunderstanding of England's attitude led to an extreme bitterness
between the two peoples, the very result which Henderson hoped that
the Solemn League would prevent. Compare, for example, Mr. John
McClelland: "Englishmen shall be made spectacles to all nations for
a broken covenant. . . . If all England were as one man united in
judgment and assertion, and if it had a wall round about reaching
to the sun, and if it had as many armies as it has men, and every
soldier had the strength of Goliah, and if their navies could cover
the ocean, and if there were none to peep out or move the tongue
against them, yet I dare not doubt their destruction when the Lord
hath sworn by His life that He will avenge the breach of covenant."

M.</i>, II., 467). Its authenticity has never been questioned, and
indeed some of the phrases are to be found in Montrose's
correspondence with Prince Rupert (<i>Mem. of M.</i>, II., 465). I
agree with Mark Napier that the piece is a political and not a love
poem, though Lord Stanhope thought otherwise (<i>Historical
Essays</i>, 172). Lord Stanhope puts the date of its composition as
1648, and Lady Violet Greville as after his wife's death
(<i>Montrose</i>, 82), but internal evidence seems to suggest 1642,
the last season of quiet before the storm broke. A large number of
verses, many of them indifferent, are printed by Napier, I. App.
<i>Mem. of M.</i>, II., 470-475. Montrose's full poetical works
will be found in the appendix to the second volume of Napier's
<i>Montrose and the Covenanters</i>, Lady Violet Greville's
<i>Montrose</i>, c. 4, Eyre-Todd's <i>Scottish Poetry of the
Seventeenth Century</i> (Glasgow, 1895), and Professor Rait's
edition of <i>Montrose and Marvell</i> (London, 1901).</p>

James Rollo, or Rollock, was the eldest son of the laird of
Duncrub, who was made a peer by Charles II. in 1651. He married
first Montrose's sister Dorothea, and secondly Argyll's half-sister
Lady Mary Campbell. He was present at Inverlochy, and fled in

troops was natural at a time when half the fighting in Europe was
done by mercenaries. A far more flagrant case was the employment of
Dutch and Hessian troops against the Highlanders in 1745. The use
of Catholic Irish was a more doubtful affair, in view of the recent
Irish rebellion, but the troops actually used were chiefly
expatriated Macdonalds.</p>

the Dumfries Presbytery. See <i>Mercurius Aulicus</i>, May 4, 1644,

name is also spelt O'Kean, O'Cathan, O'Kyan, and MacGahan. The

MacCathan." He was Antrim's foster-brother, and commanded one of
Alasdair's three Irish regiments. The O'Cahans were one of the
native Irish septs who became attached to the Macdonnells. He was
captured at Philiphaugh, and hanged in Edinburgh without a trial.
See p. 295. I have followed Wishart's account, but Gordon of
Ruthven (91) gives the exploit to Donald Farquharson, who was

have followed Gordon of Ruthven's story rather than Wishart's:

only one day to the fighting; more likely than Wishart's "plures

is no record of any violence done to women and children. Gordon of
Ruthven (98) says that "although, out of a generous and merciful
disposition he (Montrose) would have spared the people, yet the
Clan Donald, wheresoever they found any that was able to carry
arms, did without mercy dispatch them." But, as there was little
resistance, I doubt if there was much slaying (see Forbes Leith,
I., 309), and I do not believe in the story that John of Moidart in
his fury killed 895 men "without battle or skirmish." The only
witness for this is the <i>Clanranald MSS.</i>, and the Clanranald
chronicler tells his tale in the high heroic manner of an Irish
saga, and is always carpeting the ground with dead. Father Macbreck
says that the business was chiefly house burning "in just reprisals
of war," and that even in this the humbler folk were spared.</p>

Montrose left Lorn on the 28th or 29th of January. But he was at
Kilcumin, on Loch Ness, on 31st January; and, as a bond was signed
there, he must have arrived by at least the 30th. From Lorn to
Kilcumin was four or five days' march even for Montrose. Further,
we know from Balfour (<i>Annales</i>, III., 256) that the Estates
heard by 18th January that Montrose had left Lorn and was in Glen
Urquhart. This may have been a false report, but it is probable
that the royalists began to leave about the middle of the month,
and that the rearguard had gone by the 26th at latest.</p>

the name of the messenger as Alan Macildowie of Lochaber, as does
the MS. history of Gordon of Buthlaw. Alan Macildowie is also the
second-sighted man ("ane old fox") who warned Argyll before
Inverlochy that "there would be a battle lost there by them that
came first to such battle." (Gordon of Ruthven, 100.) To Father
Macbreck he is the aged "Lord of Lochaber," who brought in the
western Camerons to Montrose after Inverlochy. Forbes Leith, I.,
323. The sixteenth chief of Lochiel, Alein MacDhonh'uill Dubh
(whose grandson Ewen was then in Argyll's charge), was a very old
man who had been protected by Argyll, and his politics were
undecided. He may have sent Ian Lom to Montrose. He is called Alan
MacCoilduy in the <i>Memoirs of Locheill</i>.</p>

ordinary route, given by Napier and others, is by the pass of
Corrieyairack, down the sources of the Spey, and thence into Glen
Roy. But such a route would have taken Montrose too far to the east
and over unnecessarily high ground. Dr. Morland Simpson, basing his
view on the <i>Clanranald MSS.</i>, has suggested a much more
probable way&mdash;namely, up the Tarff, crossing above Cullachy;
then parallel to the canal till the Calder burn was reached above
Aberchalder Lodge; then ascending the burn and turning due south up
the Alt-nan-Larach till the headwaters of the Turritt were reached;
then south-west into Glen Roy along the "Parallel Roads." Pryce,

"#FNanchor_365_365"><span class=

Montrose with descending on Argyll by way of Glen Nevis. To do this
it would be necessary to march to the head of Loch Treig, and then
up Glen Treig and so into Glen Nevis, or, alternately, by way of
the Learg-nan-Leacan. This would mean a very long journey for very
tired men, accompanied by horses; an unnecessary toil, for Argyll
would expect Montrose by the main road which descended the Lochy,
and would be equally taken by surprise by a flank march along the
northern skirts of Ben Nevis. Montrose had excellent guides in the
Camerons and Macdonalds. This would seem to be also the view of
Gardiner, Lang, and Morland Simpson. See also Dr. Cameron Miller's
paper, "Montrose in Lochaber, 1645" (Fort William, 1910).</p>

200 horse and 120 mounted musketeers. Gordon of Ruthven, who
generally overstates the Gordon strength, gives them 400 horse.
Montrose had nearly 100 horse before they joined (Wishart), and
Ogilvy brought 80. Gordon probably included the musketeers among
the Gordon cavalry. Five hundred seems a reasonable estimate for
the total mounted strength of the royalists. Hope, the Lord
Advocate, gives them 3,500 foot and 600 horse. <i>Miscellany</i>

"#FNanchor_467_467"><span class="label">[467]</span></a>&nbsp;Sir
Walter Scott, in his <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> (II.,
21), apparently following local tradition, makes Leslie encamp on
the night of the 12th at Melrose, and he is followed by Mr. Mowbray
Morris (<i>Montrose</i>, 1892). For several reasons I find it
difficult to accept this view. (1) Leslie was at Gladsmuir when he
received the news from Traquair, or whoever sent it. He knew his
enemy, and his object was to cut off his retreat into the hills;
therefore he must have chosen the shortest route to the opening of
the hills at Selkirk. He left Gladsmuir the day that Montrose left
Jedburgh, so he had no time to lose. If he had crossed by Soutra,
and marched down Leader Water, he would have passed Melrose; but we
know that he came by Gala (Wishart, ch. xvi.). To follow Gala to
its foot below Galashiels, and then ford Tweed and encamp at
Melrose, would have been a perfectly aimless detour. Further, it
seems certain that Montrose arrived at Selkirk early on the
afternoon of the 12th, and his presence there would be known in
Galashiels, and communicated to Leslie on his arrival. The easiest
way from Galashiels was over the Rink hill to Sunderland. (2)
Gordon of Ruthven says definitely that Leslie was at Sunderland on
the night of the 12th, and if so he could not have been at Melrose
unless he had left Melrose early in the afternoon and forded
Ettrick. But in that case Montrose would have got word of him.
Wishart does not mention Sunderland; he says that the Covenanters
spent the night five miles from Selkirk, which is not decisive.
But, in describing the turning movement executed by Leslie's 2,000,
he writes "quos adversa amnis ripa hostes transmiserant." Now they
would not have crossed Ettrick, if they had been coming from
Melrose, till just at the battlefield, and Wishart's words indicate
a crossing at the beginning of the morning's march. One Covenant
account (<i>A More Perfect and Particular Relation</i>, etc.,
Haddington, Sept. 16, 1645, cited by Lang) says that Leslie
encamped within three miles of the enemy. (3) Local tradition seems
also to point to the Galashiels-Sunderland route. In the
preposterous ballad of the "Battle of Philiphaugh" (Scott's
<i>Minstrelsy</i>, II., 26-30), Leslie is said to have sent his
right wing round Linglie Hill, the height between Ettrick and Yair
on Tweed. Such a movement, absurd as it is, would have been
impossible to a force coming from Melrose, and shows the popular
notion of the Covenant march. The subject has been fully discussed
by Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. Fitzwilliam Elliot in his <i>The
Trustworthiness of Border Ballads</i> (1906), where the conclusion
arrived at is that of my text.</p>

Brown, <i>Hist. of Selkirkshire</i>, I., 185, etc. As a proof of
the attitude of the local peasantry towards Montrose, it is said
that the woman of the house was busy putting a sheep's head into a
pot when the general passed the kitchen door, and was heard to
exclaim that she wished it was Montrose's head, for in that case
she would be careful to hold down the lid.</p>

authorities for Philiphaugh are Wishart (ch. xvi.), who was
probably an eyewitness, Gordon of Ruthven (156, etc.), and Guthry
(201, etc.). The various Covenanting newsletters (<i>A More Perfect
and Particular Relation</i>, etc., <i>Montrose Routed in
Tividale</i>, <i>The Great Victories</i>, etc.), exaggerate the
numbers on the royalist side; these were probably as stated in the
text, except that it is difficult to believe that Douglas had the
1,200 with which Gordon of Ruthven credits him. Leslie's own
account to Leven puts the royalist force at 2,000, and adds: "I
never fought with better horsemen and against more resolute foot."
He referred, after Dunbar, to Philiphaugh as an easy victory
(<i>Ancrum and Lothian Correspondence</i>, II., 297). For some of
the country stories about it see Russell, <i>Reminiscences of
Yarrow</i>, and Craig Brown, <i>History of Selkirkshire</i>. The
ballad on the subject is probably an eighteenth-century production,
and of no use as evidence. The ancient father who guided Leslie
must have been at least 116 at the time, for he boasted of having
been at Solway Moss, which was fought a century before. He was a
prophet as well as an ancient, for he added that he had been at
"curst Dunbar," which was not fought till five years later. The
ballad was written to glorify Buccleuch's regiment&mdash;"The
Scotts out o'er the Graemes they ran"&mdash;which they certainly
did not, for very few of Leslie's foot can have come into
action.</p>

at Peebles, but as that ancient burgh is only sixteen miles from
the battlefield, and as the fighting was over by twelve o'clock, it
is difficult to believe that the fugitives stayed more than a short
space to rest. They probably rode on fifteen miles to Biggar before
halting for the night. <i>Cf.</i> J. W. Buchan, <i>History of
Peeblesshire</i>, III., 472. Tweeddale as a shire was far more
royalist than Selkirk. Peebles had some of its burgesses serving
with Montrose, and many of the gentry, like Tait of the Pirn,
Porteous of Hawkshaw, Veitch of Dawyck, and Murray of Elibank were
on his side. The county furnished the prototype of Sir William
Worthy in Allan Ramsay's <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>. Pennecuik,
<i>Tweeddale</i>, 99.</p>

authorities for the slaughter of the Irish are Wishart (ch. xvi.),
Gordon of Ruthven (160), and Guthry (203). These are, of course,
hostile sources, but Leslie in his letter to Leven says that "all
Montrose's forces that were Irish or Highlanders (were) killed upon
the place (<i>The Great Victories</i>, etc., 1645)". The reader
will find the little that can be said in extenuation in Dr.
Mitchell's introduction to the <i>Commission of the General
Assembly Records</i> (S.H.S.), I. Leslie does not appear to have
been a man of scrupulous honour. A similar case at the surrender of
Dunavertie, in Kintyre (Guthry, 243), is denied by Sir James
Turner, who was present (<i>Memoirs</i>, 238). Turner was naturally
anxious to defend his general, but on the other side there is the
evidence in the action raised after the Restoration against Argyll
by the Macdougals of Dunolly (<i>A. P. S.</i>, VII., 337), and
Turner himself records an instance of Leslie's bad faith towards
Alasdair's father at the siege of Dunyveg in Islay (<i>Memoirs</i>,
48). <i>Cf.</i> also Montereul (Montreuil), <i>Correspondence</i>
(S.H.S.), II., 103. The dishonouring of paroles and promises of
quarter seems to have been the official creed of the Covenant. In
the "Interloquitur of Parliament" of January 10, 1646, occurs this
startling sentence: "If this defence of quarter be sustained, then
the whole nation, especially the Estates of Parliament, does
violate the oath of the Covenant, and the oath of the Parliament
anent the prosecuting and censuring of malignants, opposers of the
Covenant." (<i>A. P. S.</i>, VI., i., 249).</p>

that, in signing his confession, he declared that "if there was
anything in that document derogatory to the king and his authority,
he utterly disowned it." On a matter like this Wishart could

Latin text of Part I., <i>De Rebus Auspiciis Serenissimi et
Potentissimi Caroli, etc., sub imperio illustrissimi Jacobi
Montisrosarum marchionis, etc., Commentarius interprete, A. S.</i>
(Agricola Sophocardius, <i>i.e.</i> George Wishart), was issued in
1647 at the Hague or Amsterdam. A second edition, superbly printed,
appeared in Paris in 1648, a third at Amsterdam in the same year,
and (if we are to believe the preface to the 1756 translation) a
fourth in 1649. The first English translation was published by
Samuel Browne at the Hague, probably in 1647 (I have in my
collection the copy of this edition specially bound for
presentation to Prince Charles). It was reprinted in 1648 in a
beautiful small quarto, and in 1649 in a barbarous duodecimo, with
various passages differently rendered. In 1652 the same
translation, with additions consisting of a continuation of
Wishart's Part I. by a different hand, and an account of Montrose's
trial and death, was issued in London under the title of
<i>Montrose Redivivus</i>. Another edition, with additional matter,
appeared in 1660. A new translation, with various letters and
additional notes, was published in 1720 and reprinted in 1724, and
a revised version was issued by Ruddiman in Edinburgh in 1756. This
was reprinted, with some further notes, by Constable in 1819.
Meantime there had appeared in Paris in 1767 a French translation
in two volumes. In 1893 Canon Murdoch and Dr. Morland Simpson
issued, under the title <i>Deeds of Montrose</i>, a complete
edition of both parts of Wishart's Latin narrative, with a new
English version, and three chapters on Montrose's last expedition,
largely based on the Danish and Swedish archives. This must rank as
the definitive edition, and the editors' learned and ample notes
cannot be overpraised. For the bibliography of Wishart see their
Critical Introduction. Wishart prefaces his text with a long
dedication to the Prince of Wales. This was printed in the Latin
edition, and in the first English translation of 1647, but omitted
in the subsequent translations. The reason appears in Burnet,
<i>Mem. of the Hamiltons</i>, 344: "To oblige the Duke (of
Hamilton) the more, a book being dedicated to his Highness
containing some passages much to the Duke's dishonour, he refused
to accept of it, and ordered it to be called in." The letter on the
subject from the prince to Montrose is in Bodleian MSS., 895. This
may account for the rarity of the first English edition.</p>

copy in "Civil War Tracts" in the British Museum is dated
Copenhagen, July 9, 1649, but the copy in my collection has the
imprint of "Gothenberge." I possess another declaration, also dated
July 9, 1649, from "Hassuia in the Kingdom of Denmark," and
apparently published in London, to which I can find no reference
elsewhere. In it Montrose defends himself against "that harsh and
uncharitable censure which the Parliament and Kirk of Scotland are
pleased to pass against me," and undertakes to do nothing
prejudicial to "the well-being and present government of that Kirk
and kingdom." He undertakes also to "leave the continuance or
alteration of government either in Church or State in his Majesty's
other dominions to the judgment and discretion of his Majesty and
the Parliaments thereof." He then enumerates the crimes of his
opponents, culminating in Charles's death. All this is in
Montrose's authentic manner. But the declaration concludes with the
astonishing announcement that he is coming presently to Scotland,
an invitation to loyalists to meet him at Inverness, and a summons
to all rebels to lay down their arms before 1st November, otherwise
they will receive no mercy. "I will with all violence and fury
pursue and kill them as vagabond rogues and regicides, not sparing
one that had any hand in that horrible and barbarous murder,
committed upon the sacred person of our late dread sovereign, but
utterly extirpate and eradicate them, their wives, children, and
families, and leaving none of their cursed race (if possible)
breathing upon the face of the earth." This peroration is such
manifest folly as a preliminary to the kind of campaign which
Montrose projected, and so out of keeping with his general
attitude, that one must consider the declaration an unauthorized
publication by some hot-headed royalist who perhaps had got hold of
one of Montrose's drafts. Though it bears a London imprint the
style of printing is not English. Montrose is referred to as
captain-general of his Majesty's forces in "Great Britain," not in
Scotland only.</p>
<p>The Gothenburg declaration was printed in London in 1650 by
Matthew Simmons, together with the reply of the General Assembly
and extracts from the reply of the Estates, and a cynical
postscript by some Englishman who did not love the Scots. The
replies of the Estates and the Assembly were printed at Edinburgh
by Evan Tyler in 1650 in English and Latin. They will be found also
in an appendix to the 1819 edition of Wishart.</p>

Napier in his <i>Graham of Claverhouse</i>, I., 98-102. Gordon of

recalcitrant Mr. Smith, but merely says that "he was sent to the

accompany Montrose and perish with Sinclair. Now George, the third
earl, had died in Orkney three months before, and William, the
fourth earl, did not die, but lived to escape from Edinburgh castle
in 1654 and for more than twenty years after. So, unless we
interpolate a fourth earl of whom nothing else is known, we must
reject Sallagh's story. It is probable that he did not know about
the death of the third earl in Orkney, and, observing that after
Carbisdale William received the title, assumed that his predecessor
had died in the flight to Assynt. For the other view, see S. R.
Gardiner, <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, Nov. 11, 1893.</p>

question of Assynt's guilt is exhaustively examined by Murdoch and
Simpson (App. XIII.) who decide against him on every count. There
can be no question about his surrender of the fugitives, but I
cannot find it proved that he had ever served under Montrose,
though Montrose probably assumed him to be friendly from his
knowledge of his connection with Seaforth and Lemlair. For his
later fate see M. and S. <i>loc. cit.</i>, and for a defence see
<i>Trans. of the Gaelic Society of Inverness</i>, xxiv., 374, etc.
Ian Lom's verses are worth quoting (<i>Cumha Mhontroise</i>) in
Mackenzie's <i>Beauties of Gaelic Poetry</i> (1841), 50; the
translation is by Sheriff Nicolson:<br>
<br>
"I'll not go to Dunedin<br>
&nbsp;Since the Graham's blood was shed,<br>
&nbsp;The manly, mighty lion<br>
&nbsp;Tortured on the gallows.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;That was the true gentleman,<br>
&nbsp;Who came of line not humble.<br>
&nbsp;Good was the flushing of his cheek<br>
&nbsp;When drawing up to combat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;His chalk-white teeth well closing,<br>
&nbsp;His slender brow not gloomy!&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;Though oft my love awakes me,<br>
&nbsp;This night I will not bear it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Neil's son of woeful Assynt,<br>
&nbsp;If I in net could take thee,<br>
&nbsp;My sentence would condemn thee,<br>
&nbsp;Nor would I spare the gibbet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;If you and I encountered<br>
&nbsp;On the marshes of Ben Etive,<br>
&nbsp;The black waters and the clods<br>
&nbsp;Would there be mixed together.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;If thou and thy wife's father,<br>
&nbsp;The householder of Leime (Lemlair?)<br>
&nbsp;Were hanged both together,<br>
&nbsp;'Twould not atone my loss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Stript tree of the false apples,<br>
&nbsp;Without esteem, or fame, or grace,<br>
&nbsp;Ever murdering each other<br>
&nbsp;'Mid dregs of wounds and knives!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Death-wrapping to thee, base one!<br>

account of rumours that the head was to be stolen by Montrose's
friends, "a new cross prick of iron to cross the former prick" was
added six days after the execution (Nicoll, <i>Diary</i>). Cromwell
had the limbs taken down in Glasgow, Stirling, Perth, and Aberdeen.
The Aberdeen "member" was laid in Huntly's vault till 1661, when it
was moved to Edinburgh for the second funeral (M. and S., App.
XIV.). There was a story recorded by Sir Edward Walker that after
Dunbar Cromwell caused the head to be removed from the Tolbooth
(Douglas, <i>Cromwell's Scotch Campaigns</i>, 121 <i>n.</i>), but
it remained till 1661, when James Fraser saw it taken down. One
Thomas Binning, mariner, serving as a gunner at the Castle, who had
a regard for Montrose's memory, tried to have it shot down, but the
ball only knocked off part of the stone support of the spike, which
in its fall "killed a drummer and a soldier or two." "Providence,"
Captain Binning piously reflected, "had ordered that head to be
taken down with more honour." See Binning, <i>A Light to the Art of
Gunnery</i>, 1675.</p>

of course hostile (cf. <i>Hist. of his Own Time</i> (1724), I.,
38). Later writers, like Laing, Brodie, and Hill Burton, have been
uniformly unfavourable, and Hallam repeats baseless charges without
examination. Even Hume Brown, for so just a writer, is curiously
carping in his references. To Charles Knight, Montrose was only a
skilful actor "playing his heroic r&ocirc;le to perfection"; Godwin
considered that "he possessed the temper of the commander of a gang
of pirates"; to Mackenzie he was a "vain-glorious butcher"; to Dr.
Burns, the editor of Wodrow, he is "that infamous ruffian but
eminent loyalist." The reaction began with Lingard and Lord
Stanhope, and the most recent historians, such as Gardiner and Lang
and Mathieson, have done ample justice to "the most sympathetic
figure in Scottish history."</p>
