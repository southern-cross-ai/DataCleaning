<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The second voyage of Captain Bligh to the South Sea, so far as I
know, has never been published. A short description of the passage
of his ships, the "Providence" and the "Assistant," through Torres
Strait, was included in his work <i>Terra Australis</i>, by Matthew
Flinders, who served as a midshipman in the "Providence". These
particulars, however, were taken from Flinders' own log. Written in
1791-93 Bligh's log-books, after being for some time at the
Admiralty, were lent to the Great Exhibition of 1851. They were not
afterwards returned to Whitehall, but remained at South Kensington
undisturbed and unsought for, until Mr. Perrin, the present
Admiralty Librarian, to whom my cordial thanks are due for
permission to transcribe them, recovered the forgotten volumes and
replaced them in the Admiralty Library.</p>
<p>Interest in this second voyage of Bligh may possibly have been
over-shadowed by the popularity of the story of his first voyage,
which included the "Mutiny of the Bounty'". Dampier, Anson, and
Cook on returning to England had given glowing accounts of the
virtues of the breadfruit, and in 1787, when King George III.
complied with a request from the merchants of the West Indies to
introduce the tree into those islands, Bligh was placed in command
of the ship chosen to carry out this object. William Bligh was a
Cornishman, although at least one biographer<sup>*</sup> tells us
that he was born in Kent. According to his own account,
however,<sup>**</sup> he was born in 1753 in the parish of St.
Tudy. Another biographer<sup>***</sup> says that an entry appears
in the register of St. Andrew's, Plymouth, to the effect that
William, son of Francis and Jane Bligh, was baptised in that church
on October 4th, 1754, Francis being the son of Richard Bligh, of
Tintern, a duchy estate in St. Tudy, a few miles from Bodmin.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cates.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Polwhele's <i>Biographical Sketches in
Cornwall</i>.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Waller.]</p>
<p>William Bligh joined the Royal Navy at an early age. He was only
twenty-three when he set sail with Cook on June 15th, 1776, on his
third and last voyage. Returning home after an absence of four
years, Bligh became a Lieutenant, and carried out some important
surveys for the Admiralty. He fought in the battle off the Dogger
Bank in 1781 and again under Lord Howe in the following year at
Gibraltar. In 1787 he proceeded in the "Bounty" to Tahiti in order
to collect the breadfruit.</p>
<p>The history of the mutiny which brought the voyage of that ship
to a disastrous conclusion, and nearly cost Bligh and his loyal
comrades their lives, has been told many times. A brief account of
it has been included here, but primarily for comparison of the
course taken by the ship's launch in which Bligh was turned adrift
by the mutineers with that of the "Providence" and "Assistant". The
second voyage contained no such thrilling incidents, yet it also
deserves a place in the history of exploration; not only because
Bligh succeeded in carrying out the mission entrusted to him, but
also because of the new and valuable information that he was able
to give concerning the different places visited by the ships, and
the various islands which lay in their track. On Bligh's return to
England after his boat voyage in March, 1790, he had been warmly
welcomed by the nation and praised for his courage and skill, being
promoted first to the rank of Commander, and soon afterwards to
that of Post Captain. King George was particularly enthusiastic,
and directed that Captain Bligh should be assigned two ships, and
that he should go a second time to Tahiti and carry out the
instructions which had been previously given to him. He was also
ordered to make a complete examination of Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The first ship to be secured was the "Providence," which was
launched at Blackwall with that name on April 23rd, 1791. She was
purchased from Mr. Perry, and is described as being a superior ship
of 420 tons burthen with three decks, while her length of keel was
over 98 feet. Her complement numbered 134 men. A smaller ship, a
brig of 110 tons burthen, called the "Assistant," was chosen to
accompany the "Providence". Her length of keel was 51 feet, and the
command of her was given to Lieutenant Nathaniel Portlock; she
carried a complement of 27 men. On the recommendation of Sir Joseph
Banks, two skilled botanists, Mr. James Wiles and Mr. Christopher
Smith were appointed to accompany the expedition. The management of
the plants was placed in their charge, and, as well as taking care
of the breadfruit intended for Jamaica, they had orders to bring
home a collection of rare plants for the King's Garden at Kew.</p>
<p>The ships began to fit out at Deptford, and on June 22 dropped
down to Galleons. Here the "Providence" took on board 12 carriage
guns and 14 swivels, while the "Assistant" received as her share
four 4-pounders and 8 swivels. The vessels then sailed to the
Little Nore where they were joined by Lieutenant Pearce, 1
sergeant, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 15 privates of marines from
the Chatham division. After a short stay at Sheerness in order to
take in more ballast, the "Providence" and the "Assistant" sailed
on July 12th, and passing through the Downs anchored four days
later at Spithead.</p>
<p>From Spithead they voyaged to the Cape of Good Hope, touching on
their way first at Teneriffe, and afterwards at Porto Praya. Late
in the afternoon of November 6th they arrived in Table Bay. During
his sojourn at the Cape, Captain Bligh wrote an account of the
country in those early times, which should prove interesting
reading for South Africans to-day. From Table Bay the ships sailed
to Tasmania, following very closely the track that the "Bounty" had
previously taken, and coming to an anchorage in Adventure Bay where
she also had lain.</p>
<p>Here Captain Bligh saw natives, and gained new knowledge of
Bruni Island and of the harbours within D'Entrecasteaux Strait as
yet undiscovered. His charts arc important testimony as to what he
there learned, and form a connecting-link in the chain of early
Tasmanian discovery, helping to show how the coast-line of the
country first made its appearance on the old world maps.</p>
<p>Leaving Tasmania, Bligh steered far southward of New Zealand, to
enable him to be in a new track, and the ships kept in these
latitudes until they had gained the longitude of Tahiti, whence
they worked northwards, and discovered the low-lying Tematangi or
Bligh's Lagoon Island, which in one of his letters he describes as
a "half-drowned island".</p>
<p>At Tahiti, Captain Bligh met many of his old friends among the
natives, who received him with every mark of joy, and "literally
thanked God" that he had survived the perils of the boat voyage.
The natives related the story of the arrival at Tahiti of the
mutineers and of their final departure. Captain Bligh also learned
of the visits of Captain Edwards and Captain Vancouver to the
island, and of the capture of some of the mutineers by the
former.</p>
<p>Bligh stayed over three months in Matavai Bay collecting
breadfruit plants, and, after leaving, touched at Aitutaki on his
way to the Tonga Islands. He then made his way to Fiji in order to
survey his former discoveries.</p>
<p>In his second voyage through Fiji Captain Bligh entered the
group to the northward of where he had brought the "Bounty's"
launch in May, 1789. His ships passed between Mothe and Oneata, or
rather between Mothe and the reef Thakau Lekeleka, which forms the
south side of the Oneata channel. The vessels were kept plying off
and on Mothe Island, and in the middle of the night the
"Providence" was visited by some Fijians. With the exception of
Cook's mention of a Fijian seen at Tonyataboo, Bligh's description
of these men appears to be the earliest account of the natives of
Fiji in existence. From Mothe he bore away on a north-westerly
course, passing between Naiau and Vanua Vatu Islands, and catching
a glimpse of a considerable island (Lakemba) whereon several fires
were burning.</p>
<p>The ships lay to for the night, and at daylight, Moala, which
had been seen by the launch in 1789, was identified, later Vatu
Vara was seen and was christened Gibraltar Rock. Bligh spent some
days completing his explorations in Fiji. He steered northwards
towards Taviuni, which he thought must be two islands, and came as
far north as the Nukutolo Islets. Here he spent another night, and
then turning abruptly, sailed down to the south-west, crossing his
old track in the launch, and passed between Nairai and Ngau
Islands.</p>
<p>The ships continued to steer southward in order to get more sea
room until they came to Kandavu, the south-westernmost island of
the group, after weathering which Bligh got out to sea again.</p>
<p>From Fiji the ships sailed to the northernmost of the New
Hebrides as Bligh wished to revisit the islands of the Banks Group
seen by him in the "Bounty's" launch. They consist of Vanua Lava,
Mota, Valua and Ureparapara, and it seems rather a pity that he did
not try to open communications with the inhabitants who at one
place were seen in strong numbers upon the beaches.</p>
<p>Bligh next took the ships through the dangerous Louisiades and
into Torres Strait by an entrance which ever since bears his name,
Bligh Entrance, and is the best approach to the Great North-East
Channel. After some perilous navigation in threading his way
through the strait, he left it by a channel which is also called
Bligh Channel after him.</p>
<p>What is rather remarkable about Bligh's tracks is that the
courses he took in Torres Strait through two different channels,
firstly in the "Bounty's" launch through Prince of Wales Channel on
the west side of the strait, and secondly with the "Providence" and
"Assistant" on the eastern side through Bligh Entrance, are both
to-day recommended by the authorities as the safest and best.</p>
<p>Having passed through Torres Strait, Bligh sailed to Timor, and
spent some time refreshing his ships at Coupang. From Coupang he
went round the Cape of Good Hope without touching at any port until
he reached St. Helena on December 17th, 1792. He left there some of
the breadfruit plants and others of rare species with the Governor,
Colonel Broke, and then took his departure for St. Vincent, where
he arrived on January 23rd, 1793.</p>
<p>A week was spent there landing plants and receiving those
intended for Kew Gardens, and when the work was finished the voyage
was resumed. Jamaica was sighted on February 4th, but the ships did
not reach Port Royal until the following day, when Bligh's task was
successfully accomplished and the breadfruit brought to
Jamaica.</p>
<p>Unhappily there was only a small practical result of the voyage
as far as the plants were concerned, as we are told that the West
Indians disliked the flavour of the breadfruit, and preferred the
plantain.</p>
<p>The "Providence" and the "Assistant" had an uneventful voyage
back to England; France and England were at war, and although they
must have run danger of being captured, they reached the Downs
safely on August 2nd, and anchored at Deptford on the 7th.</p>
<p>In May, 1801, Captain Bligh was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society in consideration of his distinguished services in
navigation and in botany. The most lasting benefits of Bligh's
voyage, however, were those gained by the seamen who followed him
into southern waters, from their knowledge of his explorations.
Such discoverers as Flinders and King profited by his
investigations and experiences.</p>
<p>In both voyages Bligh had extraordinary opportunities of proving
his skill in navigation; in both voyages he was singularly
fortunate; and in both voyages he made fresh discoveries where
Tasman and Torres had preceded him. It is not too much to say that
his countrymen are indebted to him for their first knowledge of
Fiji and of the islands in Torres Strait.</p>
<p>Over and over again men have gone forth as Bligh did in the
service of their country, and yet there is barely a vestige of
evidence to show what they have done. Bligh's work remains. Many
times he is seen as a prominent figure in maritime exploration and
in naval enterprise--as sailing master with Cook in the
"Resolution," until the great navigator's death at Hawaii on
February 13th, 1779; as commander of the "Bounty" in 1789; and
later as victim of the mutiny when he was cast adrift. Then
followed his wonderful voyage when his boat ploughed Fijian seas,
which no Englishman had ever traversed. Once more he appears as
Captain of the "Providence" in 1791-93, threading his way through
Torres Strait--a pioneer in the charting of those unknown
waters.</p>
<p>We find him back in Europe in 1797 when, on the breaking out of
the mutiny at the Nore, the Admiralty employed him to go among the
men and do what he could to restore order. On that occasion he
behaved with great bravery. In the same year he was in command of
the "Director" at the battle of Camperdown, when Admiral Duncan
defeated the Dutch under De Winter.</p>
<p>In 1801 he "led the 'Glatton'"<sup>*</sup> (54) at the battle of
Copenhagen, under Lord Nelson, who having sent for him after the
action, said in the presence of several officers: "Bligh, I sent
for you to thank you. You have supported me nobly." In 1811 he was
promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral, and to that of Vice-Admiral
in 1814. He died on December 7th, 1817, aged sixty-four years, and
was buried in the Church of St. Mary, Lambeth, where a monument was
erected to his memory.</p>
<p>At sea he was always capable, persevering, and courageous, and
his name distinguishes many places in the Southern Hemisphere, the
first to be called after him being a black rock off Kerguelen Land,
in 48&deg; 29' S., christened Bligh's Cap by Cook. On shore his work
seems to have been on a lower level, and as Governor of New South
Wales (1806-10) he was not a success.</p>
<p class="note">[* Waller]</p>
<p>With regard to the mutiny it is of course well known that many
of Bligh's contemporaries set an example which has been freely
followed, of blaming him for its occurrence. Among those who have
censured him, Marshall (1824) is conspicuous, as is also Lady
Belcher (1870), wife of the Admiral of that name, the former being
influenced by Heywood's statements at the trial of the mutineers,
and also by those contained in Morrison's journal. The author does
not in this volume make any comment upon the mutiny, or discuss
Bligh's merits or his failings in connection with it. It is her aim
to show the part played by Captain Bligh as a seaman and a
discoverer.</p>
<p>IDA LEE.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the beginning of his Journal Captain Bligh gives us the
following information concerning his observations:--</p>
<p>"To assist me in my astronomical observations I have three
chronometers, two made by Earnshaw and one by Arnold. The longitude
of each time-keeper will be set down at noon.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The nautical reckoning of the log-books
commenced at noon, twelve hours earlier than the civil account,
excepting while in port, when civil time was observed.]</p>
<p>"The variation of the compass will be always observed on the
binnacle taking the shadow each way fore and aft, so that two
observations are performed by each compass, the mean of which is
considered the truth.</p>
<p>"The compasses are by G. Adams.</p>
<p>"The log will be always marked in proportion of 50 feet to
thirty seconds of time. The mean height of the eye, about the level
of the sea, is equal to 3' 49" altitude."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I. THE SHIPS LEAVE
ENGLAND.</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, August 3rd, 1791, Captain Bligh left England for
the second time in search of the breadfruit.</p>
<p>The "Providence" and the "Assistant" sailed from Spithead in
fine weather, the wind being fair and the sea calm. As they passed
down the Channel the Portland Lights were visible on the 4th, and
on the following day the land about the Start. Here an English
frigate standing after them proved to be H.M.S. "Winchelsea" bound
for Plymouth, and those on board the "Providence" and "Assistant"
sent off their last shore letters by the King's ship. A strange
sail was sighted on the 9th which soon afterwards hoisted Dutch
colours, and on the loth a Swedish brig passed them on her way from
Alicante to Gothenburg.</p>
<p>Black clouds hung above the horizon throughout the next day
threatening a storm which burst over the ships on the 12th, with
thunder and very vivid lightning. When it had abated a spell of
fine weather set in and good progress was made by both vessels.
Another ship was seen on the 15th, and after the "Providence" had
fired a gun to bring her to, was found to be a Portuguese schooner
making for Cork. On this day "to encourage the people to be alert
in executing their duty and to keep them in good health," Captain
Bligh ordered them "to keep three watches, but the master himself
to keep none so as to be ready for all calls".</p>
<p>Four strange sail were in sight on the morning of the 18th,
although none came within hail, and land birds were following
Bligh's ships; one like a woodcock tried to reach the "Assistant,"
but fell into the water only a few yards from the brig.</p>
<p>The wind on the 19th freshened into a strong gale with heavy
rain which drenched the "Providence" so much that fires were kept
alight at night fore and aft, and an officer and seaman of each
watch told off to attend to and dry the saturated clothes. This
practice was continued throughout the voyage, in wet and damp
weather, and helped to keep the men in good health.</p>
<p>On Monday, August 22nd, amid a little excitement, the effects of
Mr. William Day, midshipman, who had failed to join his ship before
she left Spithead, were sold at the mast, his non-appearance having
caused the captain much annoyance. At this time the distance
between the two ships had greatly increased, and Captain Bligh
tells us that he "bore down to the 'Assistant'" in order to prevent
a separation. Thick heavy weather set in on the 23rd, and the sea
ran high until the 26th, when the "Providence" spoke the
"Redbridge," whaler, bound to the Southern Fishery. She had left
Southampton on the loth, and her master, John Kelly, being very
ill, Captain Bligh sent Mr. Harwood, surgeon of the "Providence,"
on board his ship to prescribe for him.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of August 27th the Island of Teneriffe was
sighted. The land appeared "high in the clouds above our heads. It
was only at times we could see the Pic which was covered as well as
all the country round with a prodigious thick haze. At noon by my
bearings I found I was on a meridian with St. Francis' Church."</p>
<p>A fair wind towards evening induced Captain Bligh to try and
gain his anchorage, but he had no sooner got within reach of it
than the breeze dropped and the high land becalmed the ships. At
the same moment a blast of hot wind blew towards them from the
shore which "seemed as though it had passed through a furnace and
caused those on board great discomfort". The ships were compelled
to put out to sea for the night, but they steered in-shore in the
morning and were towed by the boats safely to an anchorage. A
Spanish packet and several merchantmen were lying there.</p>
<p>As soon as he had anchored, Captain Bligh sent an officer to
call upon the Governor and to obtain supplies of wine, water, and
fresh beef from the Agent. The Governor was absent among the
islands, and the commandant "neither received nor returned any
salute". During the stay of the vessels in the port Captain Bligh
was seized with a severe attack of fever, which so weakened him
that he was obliged to place Mr. Portlock in charge of the
"Providence," while Mr. Bond replaced the latter in command of the
"Assistant". On September 2nd the two ships made sail from
Teneriffe, Bligh continuing very ill. At 6 p.m. on the 10th the
west end of Bonavista was just in sight, and Luton rock an hour
later: on September 11th they entered Porto Praya, St. Iago, where
they anchored. Here an American schooner from Boston, and the
"Industry," whaler, were lying in port.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Mr. Portlock was warned by Mr. England, gunner
of the "Providence," who had served here in the sloop "Fairy," that
"a prodigious sea sets into the bay two months in the year. It is
called the Rollers, and it is absolutely necessary for ships to put
to sea or they may founder at their anchors. The 'Fairy' once only
just escaped them. She was then protecting Mr. Braithwaite and his
companions who were recovering with a diving machine the treasure
of the E.I. Co. ship 'Hartwell' which had run ashore at
Bonavista."]</p>
<p>Captain Bligh writes of Porto Praya in his journal: "My illness
seemed to increase on our anchoring at Porto Praya; a more
miserable and burnt up and inhospitable place I never beheld; the
shore is low and barren: the interior part mountainous, without a
single spot of verdure to delight the eye or invite the stranger to
land. The wind came in hot blasts from the shore, and I saw so
little advantage to be gained by my stay here that I should have
weighed instantly if the surgeon had not recommended me to send on
shore to procure fruit...This was done...only a few oranges were
obtained, and Mr. Tobin found the place very sickly."</p>
<p>Mr. Tobin and Mr. Pearce, Lieutenants of Marines, while on shore
tried to find a house where Captain Bligh could spend a few days
comfortably to enable him to combat the severity of the fever, but
the reports were so unfavourable, and the complaint was also raging
so violently in the place, where "six or seven people die daily,"
that the ships, after spending only one night there, put to sea
again on Monday, September 12th. As they were leaving the harbour
the bower anchor of the "Providence" was unfortunately lost.</p>
<p>Not until the 15th, "when the air was remarkably cool for our
situation," did Captain Bligh feel somewhat better. The log
records, however, that he was often "distracted with headache" and
suffered occasionally from a return of the fever for a much longer
period.</p>
<p>Two strange sail were seen to the southward on the 21st, and
next day the "Providence" spoke one of them. She hoisted her
colours, and was seen to be a French brig thirty days out from
Havre and bound for the River Gambia. She remained in sight of
Bligh's ships for two days, and dispatches from Captain Bligh to
the Admiralty were sent home by her.</p>
<p>On the 23rd "a prodigious number of porpoises were seen
darkening from the S.E. They were two miles ahead when we first saw
them and extended from two points on the lee bow to two points on
the weather." Shortly afterwards one of the quartermasters, an old
southern whaler, harpooned two of them, but to the disappointment
of the sailors both broke their hold and got away.</p>
<p>On October 3rd the ships crossed the line. Captain Bligh had by
then greatly improved in health, and we read that on Sunday,
October 9th, he was once more able to perform Divine Service on
board the "Providence".</p>
<p>At this time a flight of "curious birds resembling seagulls"
were following the course of the ships, and towards the end of
October frigate birds, storm petrels, albatrosses, and white and
brown boobies were frequently seen, and the appearance of each
species is separately noted in Bligh's log-book. A little earlier
in the month two large albatrosses had hovered for some time around
the ship, when suddenly one of them flew on board, and seizing a
large hook, broke it, a surprising feat even for an albatross.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred to disturb the harmony of the ships' passage to
the Cape until October 30th, when John Letby, quartermaster,
refused to carry out the orders of Mr. Impey (mate of the hold),
and then knocked down F. Barber, the boatswain's mate, who had been
told to send him to duty. For this bad conduct Letby was punished
with thirty lashes.</p>
<p>November came in with frequent squalls, and for some days the
ships encountered rough weather. On the 5th, being then on the
parallel of Cape Town, the course was altered and they steered a
point to the southward. On the following day the Sugar Loaf Hill
was sighted in the south-east, and at noon the Lion's Rump was 7
leagues distant. Late in the afternoon of November 6th the
"Providence" and the "Assistant" entered Table Bay and anchored 1
mile off-shore. Six Dutch Indiamen, two English whalers, and a
French brigantine were found riding there.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE CAPE OF GOOD
HOPE.</h2>
<p>An officer was sent to wait on the Governor, and shortly
afterwards a message came from the Lieutenant-Governor requesting
that salutes should be exchanged in the morning, and next day,
accordingly, the two ships saluted the Fort with thirteen guns,
which courtesy was returned with the same number. Captain Bligh
then went to call upon Mr. Rhenius, the Lieutenant-Governor, who,
in the absence of the Governor, Mr. Van De Graaf, in Europe, was
invested with the command. These formalities over, the captain made
arrangements for a tent to be pitched on shore while the ships were
being thoroughly overhauled, and gave orders for the sick men "who
required the advantage of the land air to be sent to sick
quarters". Then, he tells us, he endeavoured to restore his own
impaired health.</p>
<p>While the "Providence" and the "Assistant" were lying at anchor,
a number of ships came into and sailed out of Table Bay, among the
latter being the "Chaser" of London, commanded by Captain Lloyd,
from Delaware Bay, and the "Loyalist" of London, Clark master, both
English whalers, and two French brigs (one from Marseilles), both
of which were carrying slaves to Martinique.</p>
<p>On November 27th the "Pitt," transport, Captain Manning, for
Port Jackson, arrived from Rio, and the "Duke of
Clarence"<sup>*</sup> from Saint Helena.</p>
<p class="note">[* Probably the ship in which Captain John Hayes
explored Tasmanian waters in 1793.]</p>
<p>On December 16th an English ship was seen to arrive at the
entrance of the harbour flying signals of distress. The
"Providence" fired twenty-two guns at intervals, and boats from
various ships were sent to tow the stranger into the bay. She
proved to be the "Waaksamheyd," Captain John Hunter, from Batavia.
There were on board with Captain Hunter many officers and part of
the crew of H.M.S. "Sirius" which had been wrecked at Norfolk
Island. The "Sirius" had sailed from Port Jackson on March 6th,
1790, and after she was wrecked Governor Philip hired the Dutch
snow, which had brought provisions to New South Wales, to take the
officers and crew to England. She left Sydney on March 27th, 1791,
and proved a very bad sailer. It was blowing so hard on her arrival
at the Cape that she was unable to reach a place of safety, and
having lost two anchors and cables in the attempt she had to put to
sea again. At length, with the assistance sent by Captain Bligh,
she was safely moored in Table Bay on December 22nd.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh writes: "During my stay here nothing of a material
nature intervened scarce worth relating. The ships were got ready
and my disease began to wear away. I might have established my
health had I kept away from Cape Town, but it was necessary for me
to remain near the ship. I received only a partial relief by a
short excursion into the country to Stellinbosch, a pretty village
about 25 miles eastward of Cape Town, so called after a Captain
Stellin who first planted a tree there.<sup>*</sup> It is situated
on a small plain watered by a charming river and shaded by
luxuriant oaks in the neighbourhood of wild and inaccessible
mountains. The adjacent hills give eligible situations for farms,
and produce corn, grapes, peaches, apricots, almonds, and abundance
of vegetables."</p>
<p class="note">[* It was called after a Governor named Van der
Stell who planted an orchard there.]</p>
<p>"The town consists of 40 or 50 houses and a church neatly built;
the houses are so detached that the town occupies a large space and
has the benefit of gardens. The church had the year 1722 carved on
the upper part of the doorway, but some of the houses are of a much
more ancient date. If stature or robust looks are proofs of a fine
climate they are observable among the Dutch here.</p>
<p>"The soil in some places is a kind of clay which produces corn
and charming vineyards, and the droves of horned cattle, sheep,
goats, horses, and poultry denote opulence. The roads in general
are so sandy as to render travelling bearable only in covered
wagons...their oxen are the most swift in labour of any in the
world. It is common to see eight of them driven full gallop with a
wagon and managed only by a lash of the whip.</p>
<p>"Partridge, snipe, and wild duck are the common game; about the
hills are a number of deer and ostriches--the deer is dry food and
lean--parties go after these in open wagons with eight horses. They
drive these two abreast without a leader, and it is common for them
to run full 50 miles. They fire from the wagon, and in their full
tilt will take the shortest turnings without accident. I had one
day's sport, but our prowess gave us but one ostrich, some
partridges, and moor game. We saw several deer, but could not get a
shot at them.</p>
<p>"The Madeira wine of this country is equal to any in the world,
but it is only at some of the opulent farmers' houses that it is to
be got of the best. This quality is as superior to Constantia as
Constantia is to common Malmsey. The different kinds of grape
produce many sorts of wine, so that little can be known of them
under the common term Cape Wine. From the last of January to the
last of August, the wine season, the farmer is permitted to drive
his wine or brandy to town, but at other parts of the year he may
ship it off by paying three Spanish dollars to the Company and five
to the Pachter for every leaguer.</p>
<p>"The superior part for vineyards is an extensive flat called the
Paarl. It has a considerable rock on a hill which resembles the
longitudinal of a pear more than a pearl from which it is said to
derive its name. An immense rock of the same stone lies adjoining
it with a narrow pass between the two. This pass leads into a deep
valley and on the opposite side of it is another mass of stone, one
side of which is buried in the steps of the hill. Its base lying
far below the other renders it not so remarkable. I saw a hundred
large baboons on the side of it basking in the sun.</p>
<p>"The height of Paarl Hill is nothing compared to those around
it, and it cannot be called a mountain. I rode to the top of it and
it is not difficult of access. The Paarl Rock only is accessible;
the one adjoining it having perpendicular sides; they are nearly of
a height, and Dr. Anderson's comparison of the size of the Paarl to
that of St. Paul's Church, is too great by the whole cupola. The
wood about these hills is in general small and some of it grows out
of solid rock. The stone, however, being friable, it is not so much
a phenomenon as at Timor where trees grow out of rocks as hard as
flint.</p>
<p>"In a note in Cook's 'Last Voyage,' vol. i., p. 45, he points
out the difference of observation of Holben and De la Caille. I
attribute this to Dr. Anderson's having called the Paarl the Tower
of Babel, which it is not. The Tower of Babel is a few miles from
it, and as De la Caille says, 'est un tr&egrave;s bas monticule'. Mr.
Sonnerat's description of the Paarl is less accurate; instead of it
being one of the highest mountains in the neighbourhood of the Cape
he would have been nearer the truth had he said it was among the
smallest...The Tower of Babel is a small round hill lying near the
road between Stellinbosch and the Paarl...A neat church is built in
a proper situation for the parish.</p>
<p>"The police, like those of Stellinbosch, are governed by a chief
magistrate<sup>*</sup>--referring to Cape Town in all cases of life
and death. I remained a week only at Stellinbosch, where I lived at
Mr. Borchaud's, a sensible, worthy man, minister of the Parish...A
distracted headache returned to me at Cape Town."</p>
<p class="note">[* Landrost.]</p>
<p>"I was obliged to Mr. Breddau, who lives near Table Hill, for
the plants he gave to us. I took about 240 from him that we might
not only have some for propagation where we were likely to touch
at, but others to give the gardeners information of the treatment
necessary on board ship. In this gentleman's garden is the thing
best worth seeing of any at Cape Town. It is a beautiful spring of
fine water. I left with Mr. Brandt three nectarine trees, which I
was told were the only ones ever in that country.</p>
<p>"As I considered it necessary for the good of the service I sent
Lieutenant Portlock a copy of my general orders with my directions
how to proceed.</p>
<blockquote>"'PROVIDENCE,'<br>
CAPE OF GOOD HOPE,<br>
Dec. 20th, 1791.<br>
<br>
SIR,<br>
<br>
I have enclosed a copy of my general orders which you will take
care of and be guided by in case you are separated from me. I shall
not go to the southward of 40&deg; South on our way to Adventure Bay
(which you are to consider as the first place of rendezvous) until
I get a meridian with the west side of New Holland, unless the wind
obliges me to do so. I will wait for you in Adventure Bay ten days.
Should a separation he the cause of my being there before you I
will leave a bottle with a letter in it on Penguin Island covered
with stones on the part nearest the main, and cut some memorandum
on a tree near the River's mouth towards the sea. Should you get
there before me stay the same time and do the like. From Van
Diemen's Land I shall proceed to Otaheite (by the South of New
Zealand) where our rendezvous is to beat Matavai Bay on the north
side of the island. Should my misfortune prevent my joining you
there you are to do the best for His Majesty's Service, and as you
think yourself capable to comply with the orders from my Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty.<br>
<br>
I am, etc.,<br>
Wm. BLIGH."</blockquote>
<p>The "Providence" and "Assistant" left Table Bay on December
23rd, T 791; as they sailed out they saluted the Fort with fifteen
guns which were returned. "We cheered Captain Hunter and the 'Swan'
cheered us," writes Bligh, "H.M.S. 'Swan,' Captain Jno.
Elphinstone, being then in the port."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III. TASMANIA.</h2>
<p>On leaving Table Bay, as they steered eastward Bligh's ships had
fair weather with light breezes for several days. Early on
Christmas Day a storm had threatened but the sea moderated later
and became calm again. Supplies of fresh mutton, flour, pork, and
onions were served to the men "to make a sea pie for each person,"
and this seems to have been the only attempt made to celebrate
Christmas. On December 29th Captain Bligh hove a bottle overboard
to Mr. Portlock, with the rate of his time-keeper, which was safely
picked up by the "Assistant". On January 6th, 1792, Bligh records
that "when going above six knots, we sail faster than the
'Assistant,' but when the wind will not carry us, she sails better
than we do."</p>
<p>Two days later a heavy sea broke in on the larboard gallery, and
strong gales continued until January 15th. On this day the
time-keepers were found to err, giving 2' 11" less longitude than
that given by observation. Mr. Portlock says that in the afternoon
he heard a most extraordinary sound in the water close to the
"Assistant". "It was like a voice, not like the voice of a bird,
but like that of some animal, and so much like a moaning that had
we been in the wake of the 'Providence,' I should have concluded
they had dropt a man overboard."</p>
<p>The ships came abreast of the Island of St. Paul on the 18th;
Captain Bligh had intended to land at this high inaccessible
island, but he felt sure that the foggy weather he encountered
there would cause him risk and delay. It was a disappointment to
him not to be able to ascertain whether the island was inhabited
and if any fresh water was to be found. Dutch captains had assured
him that there was plenty. He gave their account of the place as
follows: "The east port of St. Paul bearing S.W. by S. (by the
compass, for they never use the magnetic bearings, their compasses
being daily rectified by a movable center card) there is a good
anchorage in 23 fms. on a bank of fine black sand. It is a good
road, and fine fresh water is to be got and there is also a hot
spring in which fish can be dressed as if boiled on the fire."</p>
<p>Bligh continues: "There appears some confusion in calling St.
Paul and Amsterdam twin islands, although they lie in such an
immense space without any known land near them, but I have seen no
old maps of them where the southernmost was not called St. Paul and
the northernmost Amsterdam,<sup>*</sup> and I see no reason to
alter this."</p>
<p class="note">[* An old geographer writes, not without reason:
"These islands have been objects of singular confusion". Both
before and after Bligh's voyage their names were reversed by
navigators. Vlamingh, the Dutchman, who first examined them in 1696
called the northernmost Amsterdam or Isle of St. Peter. The
southern island was given the name of St. Paul. Barrow and
Beautemps-Beaupr&eacute; (who accompanied D'Entrecasteaux) were both
misled as to their proper situation, the former describing St. Paul
by the name of Amsterdam, while Beaupr&eacute; has given six views of the
supposed isle of Amsterdam which is really that of St. Paul. In
1873 the late Commodore Goodenough was ordered to call at Amsterdam
on his way southwards to see if anyone was living there as the
island was known to have been inhabited by sealers and castaways.
Goodenough saw no one, but he inspected the house (near which stood
a flagstaff) that had the appearance of age. French people had
recently left it, and a notice of their departure was found written
on the fly-leaf of a book. From its appearance, the Commodore says,
the house might have been built in 1795 when M. Perron and his
companions had lived there. The story of Perron's coming to Sydney
in January, 1796, is told by Colonel Collins in his account of New
South Wales. The ship "Ceres" brought four people to the colony,
two English and two French, one of the latter being M. Perron: they
had spent three years on Amsterdam and had existed chiefly on
seal's flesh. Perron had kept a journal and made sketches of the
island. In relating this Commodore Goodenough adds in his journal:
"As, however, at that time the names of the islands had somehow
been reversed, M. Perron may have been on St. Paul".]</p>
<p>Captain Bligh obtained some accurate information with regard to
the situation of the anchorage at St. Paul, which he says he had
sought for in vain in Mortimer's publication describing the voyage
of Captain Cox. When the "Bounty" had passed this island in 1788,
he had been prevented himself from finding its exact longitude
owing to the winter's passage. He was now able to make a chart of
it, and writes:--</p>
<p>"...I consider the latitude of the east end of the island to be
38&deg; 48' S. by longitude 77&deg; 42' E."</p>
<p>In its neighbourhood were many different kinds of birds, and
flocks of tern with silver-coloured feathers and red bills were
seen fishing off this end of the island.</p>
<p>Bearing away from St. Paul the ships continued to sail on an
easterly course until they were on a parallel with the southern
shores of Western Australia when they steered southwards to
Tasmania, or, as it was then called, Van Diemen's Land. On the
voyage thither little of importance occurred. Great care was taken
to keep the men in health, and sweet wort or sour krout was served
out to them with great regularity on board both ships. At this time
Mr. Portlock remarks of the "Assistant's" crew, "Thank God all
perfectly well except the boatswain".</p>

<p class="caption">A Sketch of the Island of St. Paul</p>
<p>On Wednesday, February 1st, the wind freshened into a strong
gale and the water became rough--much sea coming from the W.S.W.
Three days later the ships met a heavy cross sea which almost
enveloped the "Assistant," while the "Providence" also shipped much
water.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh was now rounding the southern shores of
Tasmania.</p>
<p>Bunches of rock weed called Tangle, "as it is like the lashes of
coach whips," were seen on the water, and there also appeared
numbers of a species of grampus known to South Sea Whalers as Black
Fish.<sup>*</sup> At sunrise, on the morning of February 8th, land
was sighted.</p>
<p class="note">[* <i>Globiscephalus melas</i>.]</p>
<p>This was the third time that Bligh had seen this then
little-known land, and there was with him on board the
"Providence," as midshipman, Matthew Flinders, who was destined to
explore the country thoroughly, and who six years later, in company
with Dr. Bass, first circumnavigated the island.</p>
<p>The ships first made the land slightly westward of South West
Cape. The morning was thick and foggy, but through the mist the
coast appeared in the form of huge masses of rock set one upon
another with scarcely a vestige of wood anywhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The "Providence" and "Assistant" steered towards the Mewstone,
and from here the country had a better appearance, being well
covered with wood, especially on the sides of the hills. The
vessels stood without the Mewstone, and as they drew near the land
a thick smoke from native fires was rising among the trees.
Baffling winds prevented the ships getting into Adventure Bay until
next morning at daybreak, when they were brought to at a quarter of
a mile from the west end of the beach.</p>
<p>As soon as the anchors were let go Captain Bligh went on shore
with a party of officers to fix a spot where the ships could obtain
water, and also to find a place for the wooding parties. He thought
the west end of the beach, where the "Bounty" had wooded in 1788,
most suitable for the wooders, and the best water was found at the
old watering place of the "Resolution". Having been master in that
ship when Cook visited Tasmania in 1777, Bligh knew exactly its
situation and that it was a plentiful stream.</p>
<p>While a party from the ships were tracing the stream to its
source, they came across an old native hut round which lay the
remains of a repast of shell-fish, showing that the natives had
lately been there. The hut was 8 feet wide and about 4 feet high.
Its form resembled a beehive--the open part facing north-east. It
was constructed, as were many others afterwards seen, with small
branches of trees, the large ends fixed in the ground, and
"crossing each other they are here tied together with a kind of
tough grass". Over these rafters were laid sheets of bark "in the
manner of tiles".</p>
<p>Inside the hut were little heaps of sea-snails and other shells
with the remains of a kind of lobster or cray-fish. Later on the
bones of an animal, most likely the kangaroo, were found in some of
these huts, and some woven baskets made from a species of
sea-rush,<sup>*</sup> in which were small pieces of white stone
with rolls of soft bark wrapped up carefully in dry grass, showing
that the natives obtained their fire by striking two pieces of
stone together. Lieutenant Tobin says the stone was white and hard
and very different from any that had been seen in Adventure Bay.
Fine shavings of wood were also picked up, and near them a bundle
of dried bark about 2 feet long, tied tightly together, which was
evidently intended for a flambeau.</p>
<p class="note">[* <i>Junctus maritimus</i>.]</p>
<p>Captain Bligh thought the native huts neither wind nor
water-proof. He saw an old saw pit near the anchorage, which he had
made during the "Bounty's" stay, partly filled in, but the cross
logs remained the same as did a post which he had set up. A piece
of red baize was found lying on the ground perfectly fresh in
colour and not in the least decayed.</p>
<p>He saw no signs of any ship having called there, and indeed none
had been, unless it was some storm-bound vessel on her way to
Sydney. But Admiral Bruni D'Entrecasteaux's ships were now heading
towards Tasmania, where they arrived in April, just two months
after Bligh had left. The French Admiral made the discovery that a
strait ran between the island that Bligh was now examining and the
mainland. D'Entrecasteaux named both the strait and island after
himself. On his first arrival he anchored in Recherche Bay, an
indentation in the mainland to the south of the strait; he then
sailed northward and carried out the explorations which have won
him so much fame as a Tasmanian discoverer.</p>
<p>The afternoon of Bligh's arrival had been given up to the
crews--by way of rest--and on the following day the weather
prevented any work being done until after 10 o'clock. From this
time onward, however, different parties were arranged to go on
shore, and every one, was kept busily employed during their stay.
The giant forest trees growing around Adventure Bay, from the time
of their first coming, had greatly impressed the visitors. They
were called by Dr. White of H.M.S. "Sirius," <i>Eucalyptus
resinifera</i>, and were a species of the eucalyptus commonly known
as the Tasmanian blue gum tree. In writing of these tall trees
Bligh calls them by the name <i>Metrocedera</i>.<sup>*</sup>
Lieutenant Tobin has also written of them: "From the head of the
bay (Adventure Bay) to the low neck of land which separates it from
one to the northward (Isthmus Bay in D'Entrecasteaux Strait) is
only four miles...the country...is covered with trees of great
height and magnitude. I measured one that was twenty-nine feet in
girth, and I saw some that were even larger. In general, the trunks
grow to a great height before they branch out; the leaf is not long
and not unlike a peach, and the bark is light-coloured and has the
appearance of having been peeled."</p>
<p class="note">[* Evidently <i>Metrosideros</i>, now restricted to
a closely allied genus. The genus <i>Eucalyptus</i> was first
established by L'H&eacute;ritier.]</p>
<p>Among the wood found in East Cove was a kind called Snake Wood,
being remarkable for the way in which the grain ran in a wave
through it. Captain Bligh says that "it is used in veneering, and
one of our people at home heard of it and desired me to look for
it. It is of light colour." The wooders had cut it down and burned
the branches so that the leaf could not be found, "but," adds the
commander, "it is certainly one of the metrocedera kind".</p>
<p>From Adventure Bay Mr. Wiles and Mr. Smith, the botanists, made
excursions into different parts of Bruni Island in search of
plants. One day they went to Nelson's Hill, so named by Bligh in
honour of the botanist of the "Bounty" "the first white man ever on
it"; another day going northward towards Cape Frederick Henry,
where they saw native huts but no recent marks of the Tasmanians.
They got some valuable specimens here, and when looking westward
upon the waters of D'Entrecasteaux Strait, they supposed the
narrowest part of a bay (Bligh's Frederick Henry Bay) to be not
more than 300 yards wide.</p>

<p class="caption">A Survey of Van Diemen's Land</p>
<p>Captain Bligh had fruit trees, strawberries, pomegranates, and a
rosemary planted near the lake at the east end of the beach. He
examined this lake himself in a small boat belonging to the
"Assistant," and writes "It winds through a flat surrounded by
hills and bears nothing but wire grass reeds and a few shrubs--the
water is everywhere brackish". Penguin Island, so named by Captain
Furneaux, because he had caught a curious penguin there, was often
visited; the ship's goats were sent there to feed, and when the
commander went over the island "they followed him about everywhere
and made much bleating when he left them".</p>
<p>Kangaroos were often seen by different parties, but not often
shot, as they were wild and crouched down out of sight in the long
wire grass which formed good cover for them. Wild duck frequented
Adventure Bay; many were brought down and were good eating. There
were also black swans swimming on the lake and in the rivers. The
brown quail were mistaken for partridges by the Englishmen, and a
little later the French made the same mistake, christening an
island in D'Entrecasteaux Channel, where they found them, L'Ile aux
Perdrix.</p>
<p>Bligh mentions the dark-coloured lizards, the bright-plumaged
parrots, a rat with a head like a mole,<sup>*</sup> and a black
cockatoo<sup>*</sup> which was shot; it had six long black feathers
in its tail, speckled with yellow, so that when the bird flew they
formed a circular yellow mark; "its body was larger than the
largest parrots, and its head disproportionately formed and rough".
This bird measured 3 feet S inches from tip to tip of the wings
when spread out. The carpenter also knocked down a reptile called
by seamen a galley wasp. It resembled an overgrown lizard, and
crawled like one. It was black in colour, spotted with yellow, and
the commander says, "it is well known on the coast of America".</p>
<p class="note">[* Tobin also describes an animal "the size of a
large roasting pig, with short legs and long claws," which
evidently was a wombat.]</p>
<p class="note">[** A variety of the Banksian cockatoo.]</p>
<p>The platypus, however, was quite new to the discoverers, and we
are told that Lieutenant Guthrie killed "an animal of a very odd
form". Bligh thus describes it: "It was seventeen inches long, and
has a small flat head connected so close to the shoulders that it
can scarce be said to have a neck. It has no mouth like any other
animal, but a kind of a duck bill, two inches long, which opens at
the extremity and will not admit anything above the size of a
pistol ball. It has four legs, and on each foot are very sharp
claws; it has no tail but a rump not unlike a penguin's, on which
are quills of rusty brown." As he ends his account of the birds he
saw, Bligh adds: "Near our fires we had little birds like robins,
except the want of a red breast, that visited us as domestically as
in England".</p>
<p>On February 18th the smoke of native fires was seen in the
direction of Cape Frederick Henry, and on this day it was much
nearer to the anchorage than ever before. Many tall trees in the
surrounding country had been hollowed out by fire, and the French
thought when they came to Bruni Island later on that the natives
made their homes in these hollow trunks, for the burnt-out recesses
like the openings in their huts invariably faced the north-east.
Lieutenant Tobin had heard a similar report, but after examining
them he wrote, "I imagine no such custom exists".</p>
<p>On February 19th some of Bligh's men met twenty-two men and
women at Gully Head, near the low land surrounding Frederick Henry
Bay. There was much surprise not unmixed with fear at the sight of
the white men. The Tasmanians were coming towards the ships, and
probably because of the hills between had not seen their visitors
until they were a short distance from them. There were sixteen men
and six women, one of the latter carrying a child on her back.
Neither sex was quite naked, although their coverings, the skins of
some animal--most likely the wallaby--were loosely worn over their
shoulders. All the men had beards.</p>
<p>The interview was very short, and we are told that the natives
were anxious to have a hat, but the weather was too wet for their
visitors to spare one: Bligh had heard that the inhabitants of
Oyster Bay, during the "Mercury's" stay there, had also wished for
hats. After this interview only a young man remained behind for a
few minutes, and took some bread that was presented to him by the
Englishmen. It is curious that when the French officers were
afterwards surveying Bruni Island they disturbed a party of natives
at a meal, and a young native who had left his basket behind him
turned again to seek it and passed Lieutenant Cretin with an air of
absolute fearlessness. One wonders whether this fearless young
aboriginal was the same man who had staved behind to receive bread
from Bligh's people.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* One of the natives made the French understand
that he had seen a ship or ships in Adventure Bay.]</p>
<p>The natives seen by the English were of middle-size and well
formed. They left four spears at the place where the two parties
met, and a short stick like one which had been seen by Captain
Cook. Bligh describes the spears as straight and tapering, being
about 10 feet 6 inches long, and he remarks: "They are fit for
trout fishing rods".</p>
<p>Close to this spot there was a skeleton of a new hut which the
natives were constructing but had not finished, and inside it two
kangaroo skins were found.</p>
<p>While he was in Adventure Bay Bligh saw the memorandum which had
been cut on the trees in 1777 during Cook's visit, and he cut one
there himself stating that he had called in February, 1792, and
this was seen by the French<sup>*</sup> on their second visit to
Tasmania during their search for La P&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p class="note">[* The inscription ran thus: "Near this tree
Captain William Bligh planted seven fruit trees 1792:--Messrs. S.
and W., botanists." Of these trees all but one were alive.
Labillardi&egrave;re, the French naturalist, was scandalised by "the
despotism which condemned men of science to initials and gave a sea
captain a monopoly of fame".]</p>
<p>On February 20th, the wooding and watering operations being
finished, the "Providence" and "Assistant" were ready for sea, and
the commander says that he would have sailed on that day had not a
member of the "Assistant's" crew absented himself and could not be
found. A search was made and guns were fired, but still the man did
not return. Captain Bligh, greatly concerned at his absence,
ordered a light to be left all night at the ships' mastheads to
show him the way back to the bay.</p>
<p>Next morning parties were sent out to search for him. He was
eventually discovered near the beach by Lieutenant Pearce and one
of the botanists. This man, it was afterwards proved, had wished to
desert from the "Assistant" and did not want to be brought back.
His name was Bennet.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 23rd, at daybreak, the ships got
under sail and went to examine the land to the northward, as before
he finally left Tasmania the Captain wished to see more of the
coast.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="ill-04" id="ill-04"></a><img alt=""
src="1204361h-images/ill-04.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">A Plan of Adventure Bay in Van Diemen's Land</p>
<p>He steered to the head of Storm Bay and got a good view of the
mainland which in all parts looked pleasant and was covered with
wood. There were numerous native fires in different places and
particularly "about the shores of Table Mountain, which," says
Bligh prophetically, "is certainly the finest part of the country
and the most likely place to find rivers".</p>
<p>While the ships were off the coast of Cape Frederick Henry the
"Assistant" had the misfortune to carry away her foreyard. Bligh
then put back into Adventure Bay coming in after dark, and he
remarks, "this is the third time I have worked into this bay on a
very dark night. I give it as proof of its being easy of
access."</p>
<p>After the "Assistant" had refitted, the vessels, on February
24th, resumed their voyage.</p>
<p>REMARKS AT ADVENTURE BAY, VAN DIEMEN'S LAND. FROM CAPTAIN
BLIGH'S JOURNAL.</p>
<p>"My third visit to the country has been attended with scarce any
new occurrence. I had hoped that my last voyage might have been
productive of some good. But of all the plants I planted only one
apple tree remained. It has not produced any fruit nor shows
luxuriance of growth, not having made a shoot exceeding 12 inches;
it, however, remains in a healthy state and may, if it escapes more
accidents of wind and weather, produce fruit. Those that were
planted with it have certainly been destroyed by fire or the fall
of trees. I can't help reflecting on my inattention in not
searching for the potatoes I had planted. I saw no vestige above
ground, and never thought of digging till I came away. It is not
impossible they have increased. I have seen no reason to hope that
the hogs left here by Captain Cook or any breed of them were alive.
I am, however, sanguine that the cock and two hens I have left will
breed and get wild.</p>
<p>"Perhaps the most valuable of articles I have planted this time
are nine fine young oak plants about eight inches high. They were
planted at East Cove on the slope of the hill on the left side of
the flat as you land about 200 yards from the water side. On
Penguin Island and Grass Point I sowed fir seed, apricot, and peach
stones. I expect the oaks and the fir will thrive, and some water
cresses that were placed in the rivulet on the east side which
connects with the brackish water. During my stay here the weather
has been as unsettled and boisterous as any of our unseasonable
summer or autumn months in England. We have had both hail and snow;
the latter lay on Table Mountain for days.</p>
<p>"The thermometer varied from 54&deg; to 61&deg;. In January, 1777, when
I was here in the 'Resolution' one month earlier, we had the
thermometer 63&deg; and 75&deg;, and in August, 1787 (equal to our
February), when I was here in the 'Bounty,' I had it from 41&deg; to
53&deg;.</p>
<p>"The unseasonableness of this season kept the fish out of the
Bay. A mosquito was scarce to be seen even in the swamps, and the
flies were not troublesome as in hot weather. Our fish supply was
chiefly reddish-coloured cod that weighs up to 3 lb. At other times
we caught elephant fish, flounders, a flat-headed slimy fish called
by some fisherman's foxes, bream, sting-ray, skeet, and small fish,
amounting to 28 sorts. The finest fish are the bream caught in the
marsh, and they afford very excellent diversion when fishing with a
float and baited with worms and mussels.</p>
<p>"In the winter season I saw many spider crabs; this time, not
one, nor any whales. In August, 1788, we had many in the Bay; they
were the Bone or Right Whale as they are called, having two
blow-holes, whereas the Spermaceti Whale has but one. It appears
the whales have fixed times of coming into bays. Probably August
may be the time in Van Diemen's Land, as we have not seen them in
the summer months. The huts have large heaps of mussel shells and
some oysters and crayfish in them but we never saw any fish
bones...the few oysters we got were very large, but the superior
shellfish is the Ear, so called because it adheres to the rocks
like a limpet; when properly stewed it is delicious.</p>
<p>"In Frederick Henry Bay there is a large oyster bank which our
officers met with when on an excursion to that place. I shall give
an account of it in Lieutenant Bond's own words at the end of my
remarks.</p>
<p>"It appears to me that the natives avoid being wet with the sea.
Our party saw them gathering mussels when it was remarkable to see
men fly away from every surge of the water which would not have
reached their knees. I have remarked in a former voyage that the
natives retire in the boisterous weather to places not exposed to
the sea winds. Frederick Henry Bay is a most eligible situation in
the northern part of it for them; from the smokes we observed there
the natives are more numerous than is generally supposed. They have
there a range of high continental land sheltered by large islands
from the sea where both water and food are probably more plentiful
than we have found it to be. Their food is not confined to fish. I
have seen several wood spits with which they support larger masses
of food against the fire than either fish or birds.</p>
<p>"The kangaroos are numerous: several escaped being killed by the
close under-wood; a good dog would give a good deal of sport. I
suspect the great fires which the natives make about the coast are
the cause of many animals keeping away from it. As I am convinced
the neighbouring isles are inhabited I see no reason to doubt of
their having canoes, however ill-constructed; mere logs may be only
required to transport them such short distances.</p>
<p>"It has been remarked from small baskets being found containing
flints that they get fire by them. I have not heard of any fungus
discovered that will contain sparks made by collision, but I have
found rolls of peculiar bark of trees of the smallest species of
Metrocedera that would effect this purpose, but with the fairest
trials I could not accomplish it, although a small spark put to it
will generate such a body as to secure the end in the wettest
weather. They also use shavings of some dry wood which looks as if
taken off by a plane iron an 1/8 of an inch wide.</p>
<p>"These shavings lay about most of their wigwams I saw, and I
apprehend they are formed by the sharp end of the mussel shell.</p>
<p>"These people cautiously avoid any intercourse with us. Before
they were observed our party came to a wigwam and saw marks of fire
and traces of natives, and it proved to be a small distance from
the place at which they found them. Our people left two tin
tumblers and a linen bag at this hut with the intention of taking
them up on their return, when to their surprise the natives in
their absence had taken them all away; but either their curiosity
is easily satisfied or else fears of the consequences were so great
that next day these poor creatures left each article in a
conspicuous place on the trunk of a fallen tree.</p>
<p>"We found no native products fit for food excepting a little
wild parsley at Penguin Island and Grass Point, but the hills and
country in general have a better soil than about the Cape of Good
Hope. The face of the shore is of a peculiar sandy stone. Great
slabs of it lie on Hewn Stone Head squared with such a thickness as
if done by art. I saw no marks of fusion or subterraneous fire, nor
any stones that would affect a magnet. The country is not destitute
of fresh water although no river has been found. Adventure Bay is
furnished with several runs. Resolution Brook is a fine plentiful
stream. At the east end of the beach at Water Cress Valley a small
brook has its source near Nelson's Hill: it may be made a good
watering place. East Cove Valley produces good water, but at the
place where it is at all times pure we baled it dry as fast as it
ran, and the rolling way is troublesome. The 'Bounty's' watering
place is most convenient. At all these places we found trout.</p>
<p>"I have said in the accounts of my former voyage that the trees
shed their bark every year, and said it principally on the
authority of Mr. Nelson, the botanist, but it appears to me at this
time not to be the case.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Bond and other of our gentlemen walked along the
west shore as far as the south part of Frederick Henry Bay."</p>
<p>Of that expedition Bligh gives Bond's account:--</p>
<p>"The Bay of Frederick Henry is separated on the south and east
from Adventure Bay by a narrow neck of land which in some parts is
250 or 300 yards across. The north-east of it forms a high
peninsula extending to the entrance of these two bays. To the north
and west is the mainland.<sup>*</sup> The greatest extent is about
eight miles from north to south, and about half the distance
across. It has a small island in the middle and is perfectly
land-locked. From the shore of the isthmus is a bank on which are
numerous oysters and mussels, the latter larger but not so good as
those in Adventure Bay. The harbour is fine and capacious,
perfectly free of surf, while on the east side of the isthmus the
sea broke with great fury.</p>
<p class="note">[* Bond saw the waters of D'Entrecasteaux Strait
from Isthmus Bay, while Bligh saw them farther to the
northward.]</p>
<p>"The country is the same as about Adventure Bay, and at the
beginning of the low land is a morass about three-quarters of a
mile long where we met with brackish water but saw no springs. We
saw none of the natives; they had, however, taken away some
trinkets left in a wigwam the clay before by some of our
gentlemen."</p>
<p>A glance at the charts will show that Captain Bligh called the
largest bay he saw in D'Entrecasteaux Strait, Frederick Henry Bay
(of Tasman), which of course it was not. He had first bestowed the
name of the Dutch Prince upon it in 1788 when he came to Tasmania
in the "Bounty" and on September 2nd, 1788, he wrote in the log of
that ship: "I set out in the cutter accompanied by Mr. Nelson. I
rowed over to take a view of the country when I discovered <i>The
Bay of Frederick Henry</i>. The entrance is round Cape Frederick
Henry which I consider to make the east part of it. To the
north-west it has a considerable extent, perhaps four or five
leagues. I could easily observe a small island<sup>*</sup> was
situated about the middle of the bay. Frederick Henry Bay is a most
capacious and excellent harbour." On September 4th he writes: "Cape
Frederick Henry inclines north-west, and continues in that
direction until it forms the entrance into Frederick Henry
Bay".</p>
<p class="note">[* Probably Green Island.]</p>

<p class="caption">The "Providence" and "Assistant" at Anchor in
Adventure Bay<br>
[<i>Drawn by Lieut. G. Tobin, 1792.</i>]</p>
<p>The fact that Bligh called the bay Frederick Henry Bay does not
detract from the discovery he has recorded, for the seamen who
first visited these waters after Tasman, were quite uncertain as to
the situation of Frederick Henry Bay. Furneaux and Marion gave the
title to other bays, both failing to identify it, and as a result
the name of the Dutch Prince distinguishes a harbour unseen by
Tasman, and the rightful bay of Tasman is known by the name of
Blackman's Bay.</p>
<p>Both the "Bounty" and the "Providence" therefore preceded the
ships of Admiral D'Entrecasteaux in Tasmania, and it seems strange
that Captain Bligh's discoveries are so little known. He certainly
saw a greater extent of coast-line than he has been credited with,
and he has received even less recognition than Captain John Hayes
who came after both Bligh and the French Admiral. However
imperfectly he depicts them on his chart the points of land traced
by Bligh in D'Entrecasteaux Strait can easily be identified, so
that it is a mistake to suppose, as is often done, that
D'Entrecasteaux was the first to see the interior waters of the
strait when he began his work in this region.</p>
<p>Bligh's discoveries may be thus enumerated:--</p>
<p>He and his officers were the first to explore Bruni Island
beyond the limits of Adventure Bay, which Furneaux had
discovered.</p>
<p>Bligh and not D'Entrecasteaux first learned that Isthmus Bay is
divided from Adventure Bay by a narrow neck of land, although Peter
Fannin, who came with Captain Furneaux, had remarked on his chart
of the western shores: "There is a large lagoon close aback of this
low land which appears to run a great way up into the country".</p>
<p>Bligh and not D'Entrecasteaux was the first to see the northern
half of the strait which the French Admiral named after
himself.</p>
<p>Bligh's charts are the first to show Table Mountain (Mount
Wellington) or any part of the strait, the outlet and entrance of
which were afterwards found by D'Entrecasteaux.</p>
<p>Bligh describes as islands what really were points of the
mainland. He followed Furneaux in erroneously calling Tasman
Peninsula by the name of Maria Isles, and he mistook the situation
of Storm Bay. Like Furneaux he was wrong when he thought he had
reached Tasman's Frederick Henry Bay, and he erroneously gave the
name Frederick Henry to a portion of D'Entrecasteaux Strait without
knowing that he had himself made a new discovery.</p>
<p>Although Captain Bligh did not find the entrance to the bay
called by him Frederick Henry Bay he took the "Providence" and
"Assistant" northward on the morning of his departure to look for
it, and while they were beating between Bruni Island and Tasman's
Peninsula he despatched Lieutenant Bond in the cutter on
exploration. Bond did not find the entrance, but he entered another
bay which Captain Bligh named Providence Sound in honour of his
ship.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* To-day Bligh's Providence Sound is called
Frederick Henry Bay, having been so named by Furneaux in 1773.]</p>
<p>Bond records in his log: "At &frac34; past nine in cutter having looked
into a large bay formed by Maria Islands (Tasman's Peninsula) and
the main from which no outlet could be seen to the northward yet
strongly believed to exist". Bligh called Cape Raoul by the name of
Cape Pillar, and to Cape Pillar he gave the name of The Lookers
Out.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. FROM TASMANIA TO
TAHITI.</h2>
<p>When the "Providence" and the "Assistant" again put to sea they
left Adventure Bay at half-past six in the evening. Early next
morning the land near Fluted Cape was seen disappearing in the
north-west; upon it through the night large native fires were seen
burning brightly.</p>
<p>The ships had no sooner left Tasmania than they were surprised
by a heavy gale of wind and rain during which the "Providence"
split her jib, and with difficulty saved her other sails. In
addition to being tempestuous, the weather was cold, the
thermometer on deck registering 53&deg;. This thermometer was broken by
one of the midshipmen immediately afterwards. "It is the second I
have lost," remarks Bligh, "and having but one other I am not so
regular in registering its height."</p>
<p>For some days the ships steered to the east-southeast across the
Tasman Sea which is one of the deepest seas in the South Pacific.
Desolate as it is of islands and swept by polar gales, long rolling
waves with a heavy swell traverse it in all weathers.</p>
<p>Bunches of rock weed, seals, and whales were seen in the voyage
across, and many ocean birds, including divers and Port Egmont
hens, one of which alighted one day on a mast of the ship. There
were also some large birds "as black as a crow excepting their
beaks which were yellow," and these appeared to settle a great deal
on the water. Others of a shining lead colour with a flight like
that of an albatross were sometimes skimming above the heads of the
waves, at others almost hidden by them.</p>
<p>As the ships drew near to the southern shores of New Zealand, on
March 1st, Captain Bligh gave orders to steer a course farther to
the southward so as "to give New Zealand a wider berth and to
enable me to be in a new track". The weather grew misty and was now
exceedingly cold.</p>
<p>At seven on the morning of the following day there was observed
from the deck of the "Assistant" what appeared to be a small island
or quay, but the mist was too dense to see it distinctly and it was
afterwards thought to be only a fog-bank. Mr. Portlock gives the
position as 49&deg; 03' S. and 168&deg; 04' E., so that if due allowances
are made for the difference in situation, this fog-bank may have
been The Snares<sup>*</sup> which lie in the track taken by the
ships. The log records that "The Traps off New Zealand were
north-west at noon, distant 47 leagues".</p>
<p class="note">[* Discovered by Vancouver as he voyaged to Tahiti
in 11791.]</p>
<p>In the forenoon on the 5th Captain Bligh sailed to the
north-east hoping to catch a glimpse of the Bounty Islands,
discovered by him in the "Bounty's" voyage, but the fog did not
lift, and he writes, "I steered past them in 48&deg; 08' S."</p>
<p>On March 6th it blew very hard, but fortunately the wind soon
moderated, and telling of his ship's progress, Captain Bligh says:
"In these strange winds I am always obliged to spare the sail. I am
now under top sails and fore top mast steering sail and could carry
topgallant steering sails and increase her going by two or three
miles an hour." Evidently pleased with the way in which the
"Assistant" had kept up with the "Providence," he writes later,
"The 'Assistant' sails as well as we do," and then he adds, "We are
all well and hearty except myself. I am never free from headaches
all day long." He sent the cutter to fetch Lieutenant Portlock on
March loth to dine on board, when he informed him of his intention
to "keep south of the latitude of 48&deg; until the ships reached the
longitude of Otaheite".</p>
<p>While the ships were sailing in this new track through the
darkness on the night of the 16th, the sea became illuminated by a
wonderful display of phosphorescence which spread in the wake of
the ships for at least half a mile; "the water had the appearance
as if thousands of small lamps were lighted thereon, and it looked
beautiful beyond description". On the 19th, "the sea was again full
of them".<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Pyrosoma.]</p>
<p>Captain Bligh writes next day: "A great haze over the horizon,
the wind hangs like a trade that I dare not steer more to the
north; many birds about, and a great number were seen flying after
a school of porpoises and skip-jacks".</p>
<p>By the 21st the ships had made the longitude of Tahiti, and were
beginning to work northward towards the Society Islands. On their
way they sailed within a short distance of Pitcairn Island. Bligh
little knew that there his old ship, the "Bounty" had been broken
up and that some of the men who had cast him and his loyal comrades
adrift in an open boat were living on that island, Christian having
made his way there when he left Tahiti for the last time.</p>
<p>The 25th being a Sunday, Captain Bligh performed Divine Service
on board the "Providence". On this day the water after being rough
suddenly became smooth, and as usual the great guns and the small
arms were exercised and the marines fired.</p>
<p>At this time a good account of the health of the "Assistant's"
people was received from Lieutenant Portlock. While in Adventure
Bay her commander had obtained some soil there in which he had
planted some potatoes. He tells us that he now had ten plants and
two melon or pumpkin plants, and growing in the same cask
horse-radish in English earth. He had also obtained some figs at
the Cape which he brought away in two iron pots, and in the cask
and the iron pots and a bucket he had sown cress which enabled him
now and then to furnish all hands with a little salading. "This and
other means," writes Portlock, "but above all the protection of
God, will, I hope, carry us on to port in perfect health."</p>
<p>On April 5th, to the joy of all on board, land was sighted.
Captain Bligh's entry runs: "Saw a low lagoon island from S.W. to
W. &frac12; N., by the W. distant four or five miles. We made the signal
and hauled up for it; there was a tremendous surf on the shore; we
saw some brown noddies with a white spot on the beach, and a few
cocoa-nut trees on the south-west point, but no inhabitants. We saw
the break of the surf as soon as the island was discovered. The
extent of coast is about 22 miles; from the east to the west point
is 8 miles, and it is nearly 9 miles from south-west to north-east
across a lagoon which takes up most of the isle.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="ill-06" id="ill-06"></a><img alt=""
src="1204361h-images/ill-06.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Bligh's Lagoon Island (Tematangi) (Low
Archipelago)</p>
<p>"In some parts it is covered with bushes and trees common to the
islands in this sea--in others a bare sandy beach over which in
places the sea broke in a most tremendous manner. At the end of it
there are several very large rocks, but in every other place it has
a white sandy shore; we saw only cocoa-nut trees, and near the
point was a cluster of seven very tall ones remarkable for their
situation. I do not believe the island is inhabited.<sup>*</sup>
Its nearest situation to any known land is N. 68 E. distant 59
miles from Osnaburg Island, discovered by Captain Carteret, which
is in latitude 22&deg; S. and longitude 218&deg; 26' E. I am doubtful if it
was possible for a boat to land, so high was the surf on the lee
side of the island.</p>
<p class="note">[* This island is now known as Bligh's Lagoon
Island--its native name is Tematangi. It is inhabited. The native's
were seen by Captain Beechey who called there in 1826, and they
were darker than the Lagoon islanders of Cook. They were provided
with stones, clubs, and spears. Its north end is in latitude 21&deg;
37' S., longitude 140&deg; 40' 15" W.--Findlay.]</p>

TAHITI.</h2>
<p>On their way to Matavai Bay the "Providence" and "Assistant"
made a short call at Maitea, a high round island, remarkably steep
on the north side, which lies in the track of ships proceeding to
Tahiti from the eastwards.</p>
<p>The following entries made by Captain Bligh in his log-book
describe his coming to Tahiti and his stay there:--</p>
<p>"Sunday, April 8th, 1792. Saw the island of Maitea bearing
west.</p>
<p>"Read orders to establish friendly intercourse with the
Otaheitans.</p>
<p>"I also gave out orders for establishing an amicable intercourse
with the natives of any island we might go to, and promised
disgrace and punishment to those who disobeyed them.<sup>*</sup> In
my last voyage I found the island Maitea to be in 17&deg; 53' S. 211&ordm;
58' W. I therefore steered for it to ascertain its situation a
second time.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Orders of which the following are an extract
were issued to all on board by Captain Bligh at the Society and
Friendly Islands:--<br>
<br>
1. No officer or seaman is to speak of the loss of the "Bounty," or
tell that Captain Cook was killed by Indians.<br>
<br>
2. No officer or seaman is to mention that we have come on purpose
for the breadfruit plant.<br>
<br>
3. Every one is to study the goodwill of the natives and not to

<p class="note">[** Maitea, discovered by Wallis, who gave it the
name of Osnaburg in 1767. It is the easternmost of the Society
Islands, all of which are high. It is now spelt Mehetia or Matia,
and is in 17&deg; 53', longitude 148&deg; 5'. Bligh writes in the
"Bounty's" log that as Wallis and Cook passed to the south of
Maitea, he determined to go to the north of it, and he followed his
old track in this voyage.]</p>
<p>"Monday, 9th April. I steered to the north of the island, and
hauled round under the lee of it where I brought to about two miles
distant from the shore. Four small canoes came off to us with whom
I traded for a few cocoanuts, two baked breadfruit and a small
bunch of plantains. The men were all but one of the lowest class of
natives (tow tows). Some of them recognised me. The superior man
said he was Erree-ra--high or chief of the island, but I have found
he was deceiving me.</p>
<p>"This misrepresentation is not at all uncommon among these
people. He had on a European shirt which he said was given him by
one Pateenee (a seaman called Martin belonging to the 'Bounty,' but
I could not then make out who Pateenee was). He was desirous to go
to Otaheite in the ship and on my refusing he told me he would
follow to-morrow. He said two ships had passed about three months
since, but he knew not from what country they came.</p>
<p>"The lee side of this island has no plantation on it, being so
steep to the summit of the mountain that scarce any soil will lie
on it; the weather side appeared clothed with cocoanut trees. Made
sail towards Otaheite.</p>
<p>"The night came on boisterous and the morning so much so that I
was obliged to lie by for some time for I was not able to see the
land distinctly. Towards noon the weather came fair, and we hauled
round the Dolphin Bank and anchored in Matavai Bay, Otaheite, in
nine fathoms of water, without accident. Point Venus<sup>*</sup> N.
30 E. two-thirds of a mile. West head of Tarrah S. 25&deg; W.</p>
<p class="note">[* So named by Cook. It forms the east side of
Matavai Bay, the south-west limit is Tahara or Tarrah. Captain
Bligh anchored close to Point Venus which has been described as the
most important geographical site in the Pacific Ocean on account of
the extensive observations and surveys which were made there in the
voyages of Cook, Beechey, and Fitzroy.]</p>
<p>"I was immediately visited by my old acquaintances, and to my
surprise by a whale-boat of a ship that was lost, called the
'Matilda,' Matthew Weatherhead, Master. I found that Captain
Vancouver had been here and Captain Edwards in the 'Pandora,' and
we heard many various accounts respecting them. Every person I saw
gave me joy of my safe return to Otaheite.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Otaheite or Tahiti was discovered by Captain
Samuel Wallis, who came there in H.M.S. "Dolphin" on June 19th,
1767. Wallis called it King George's Island; Cook spelt its native
name Otaheiti. It is now known as Tahiti and was made a French
Protectorate in 1842. Matavai Bay on the north side of it was
called Port Royal Harbour by Wallis.]</p>
<p>"I had only a few canoes off to the ships, for the people of
Oparre and Matavai were at war on account of the Matavai people
refusing to share the things which they had stolen from the seamen
of the 'Matilda'. I heard this news with some concern as it
militated much against my plans of immediately beginning to get the
breadfruit. The people who came off to me were Iddeah the Queen,
whose husband, Tynah,<sup>*</sup> was absent from home, Tootaha, an
old priest, and Oreepyah and Whydoah, the brothers of Tynah."</p>
<p class="note">[* Called formerly Otoo, but after being succeeded
in his lifetime by his son (who took the name Otoo), he used the
name of Tynah and afterwards of Pomare. Captain Bligh writes of
Otoo in 1789 in the "Bounty's" journal: "I was surprised to find
that instead of Otoo he was now called Tynah, and the name of Otoo
with the title of Earee-rahi had devolved upon his eldest son who
was yet a minor, this being a custom of the country".]</p>
<p>"Tuesday, April loth, 1792. Very fine weather. Got on board a
launch load of water.</p>
<p>"I had only a few Oparre canoes off, but they brought a
sufficiency of hogs, breadfruit, and cocoanuts to feed every person
sumptuously: my visitors were the same as yesterday, and Iddeah
assured me that a canoe was sent to Morea 2 for Tynah, her husband,
and his father and mother. These people are necessary to my
well-doing, though Iddeah and Oreepyah seem sufficient to effect my
plans assisted by Otoo, the Erreera-high,<sup>**</sup> who though
yet a boy continues to be instructed by them. To-morrow I intend to
pay him a visit and establish a peace which I have some hopes will
be lasting...nothing could exceed the joy of these people at seeing
me.</p>

<p>"I received a letter to-day, directed to any of His Majesty's
Ships that might touch here, from Matthew Weatherhead, commander of
a ship called the 'Matilda'. It relates that in lat. 22&deg; S. and
long. 139&deg; 45' W. from London the ship was lost on a shoal, and so
he begs my assistance as follows:</p>
<blockquote><i>Parry (Pare?)</i>,<br>
<p>OTAHEITE<br>
<i>March 29th</i>, 1792.<br>
<br>
I beg you will rectify the wrongs I have received on this island by
one Tabyroo...after the misfortune of losing the "Matilda" we were
six days in the boat. We landed at Matavai and put ourselves under
the protection of this man. I had with me one box containing most
of my papers, 407 dollars, 17&frac12; guineas, between 3 and 4 lbs. of
English silver, and a bag containing a few necessary clothes. After
being in the house six days I was turned out without anything, to
shift for myself with only one shirt.<br>
<br>
Your obed. servant,<br>
MATTHEW WEATHERHEAD.<br>
<br>
P.S.--Sir, the chief mate and carpenter will explain more clearly
if required.--M.W.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"On inquiry I found that the 'Matilda,' Captain Weatherhead, and
'Mary Ann,' Captain Munro, were two ships that had been at Port
Jackson.<sup>*</sup> They left England March 27th, 1791, arrived at
Port Jackson August 1st, 1791, and sailed on December 28th, bound
to the coast of Peru.</p>
<p class="note">[* While in New South Wales Captain Weatherhead had
charted Jervis Bay.]</p>
<p>"On February 14th, 1792, both ships anchored in Oaitepeha Bay,
where having got a plentiful supply of hogs and fruit, they sailed
on the 17th, after a stay of two days. A few days after they
sailed, the masters of the ships agreed to part company and to meet
again in Lat. 10&deg; S. when they should arrive on the coast to fish
for whales. On February 25th, the 'Matilda' went aground on a dark
night upon a shoal of some extent, perhaps eight or ten
miles.<sup>*</sup> With a few necessaries, having with them
muskets, three pistols, ammunition, and two or three cutlasses,
they cut away their masts, lowered their boats, and left the ship
at ten in the morning.</p>
<p class="note">[* The shoal was Mururoa or Vairaatea Island (the
Osnaburg of Carteret who discovered it). In February, 1826, Captain
Beechey when exploring found there signs of a shipwreck consisting
of two anchors, a cannon, metal boiler, and a leaden pump. These
were on the back part of the reef, and the spot was identified as
being the scene of the "Matilda's" wreck.]</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="ill-07" id="ill-07"></a><img alt=""
src="1204361h-images/ill-07.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption">Matavi Bay, Oparre and Taowne Harbours</p>
<p>"The ship's company consisted of twenty-eight men and boys, but
a convict having secreted himself at Port Jackson, the number was
twenty-nine. They divided into four boats, and they left the shoal
without examining it, and knew of no island or land near it. They
proceeded fortunately to Maitea, and after a night's rest and
refreshment sailed to Otaheite on March 5th. On the next night the
boats were separated by bad weather, two arrived at Matavai, one at
Oaitepeha,<sup>*</sup> the other round by Attahooroo. The people of
Oaitepeha were so hostile that the third boat proceeded to Matavai
and joined the parties there, and in the course of eight days the
men from Attahooroo also came to join their countrymen. In the
opinion of the Captain it was best for them to separate. Some
resided at Matavai, some at Oparre, and some at Attahooroo. They
were all dispossessed of the articles and clothes they had with
them, but the greatest prize fell into the hands of the Matavai
people under command of Poeno, their chief, and one Tabyroo, a
person of some power.</p>
<p class="note">[* Oheitepeha is a province on the north of
Tiarrabu, and Attehuru is a province on the west side of
Tahiti.]</p>
<p>"The circumstances became known, and Otoo demanded the surrender
of the articles consisting of money and arms, on behalf, he
asserts, of his friends the English, but no restitution was made.
Some deliberations took place immediately, the result of which was
that war was declared on March 19th. The Oparre people came to
Matavai destroying houses and all they could lay their hands on.
The Matavians made considerable resistance and still retain their
booty, and at this time the parties are violently at war.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding our countrymen were robbed of their clothes
they were afterwards treated with kindness. It would have been
better if all had stayed at Oparre under Otoo's protection. The
first step I took was to order three of the men who were absent
with the Matavians to join their shipmates.</p>
<p>"The war was interrupted by the arrival of a schooner called the
'Jenny' from Bristol. She arrived March 25th, 1792; had sailed from
England six weeks after me, and came round by Cape Horn. This
vessel remained here until March 31st, when she sailed for the
north-west coast of America, and by her Captain Weatherhead and two
boys and one man had the opportunity to return home.<sup>*</sup> He
had one passenger more than he expected, for it is supposed a
seaman secreted himself on board who has not been heard of since.
While the 'Jenny' remained here the second mate, Campbell,
undertook to go away in one of the whale boats to Port Jackson. It
was fitted up in a miserable manner with mat sails, and himself and
two men, Phillip Christall, and John Bagster (or Baster), sailed
the same day.</p>
<p class="note">[* In December, 1792, Captain Vancouver relates the
"Matilda's" story, and adds the information that Captain
Weatherhead with two men and two boys arrived safely on board the
"Jenny" at Nootka where Senor Quadra had not only provided
Weatherhead with a passage to England through New Spain, but
generously furnished him with money to defray his expenses
home.]</p>
<p>"The number of men now remaining on the island are twenty-one
(including the convict who has absented himself). Among them are
the chief mate, surgeon, boatswain, and carpenter. The whole of
them I directed to stay at Oparre where they are well taken care
of.</p>
<p>"I find that two months after I left Otaheite in the 'Bounty,'
Christian returned in her to the great astonishment of the natives.
Doubting that things had gone well with me the first questions they
asked were: 'Where is Bry?' 'He is gone,' he replied, 'to England'.
'In what ship?' asked the natives.</p>
<p>"'In Toote's ship.'<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* I.e. Cook's ship.]</p>
<p>"'How came you to meet Toote, and where is he?'</p>
<p>"'We met him at Wytootackee where he is going to live, and he,
Toote, has sent me for all those who will come and live with him,
and he wants the bull and cow and as many hogs as you will send
him.'</p>
<p>"'What has become of the breadfruit?'</p>
<p>"'He has sent it home to England with Bligh.'</p>
<p>"Everything was given him, and in eight or ten days he left
Matavai and with several men and women.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Note in log: ten men, two boys, nine women and
one girl.]</p>
<p>"In one month after Captain Cox had left this place, Christian
again arrived, and having landed sixteen of his villains, he sailed
in the course of a day, but I cannot find that any person was
acquainted with the route he intended to take. It may readily be
believed that I found great satisfaction to hear of these men all
being taken by Captain Edwards except two who were killed by the
Indians.</p>
<p>"From the best accounts those taken in the 'Pandora' were as
follows: George Stewart, acting master's mate; Peter Heywood,
midshipman; Jas. Morrison, boatswain's mate; Thos. Burkitt, A.B.;
John Millward, A.B.; Hen. Hilbrant, cooper; Wm. Musprat, tailor;
Thos. Ellison, A. B.; Richard Skinner, barber; Michael Byrne, A.B.;
Joseph Coleman, armourer; Chas. Norman, carpenter's mate; Thos.
McIntosh, Do. Crew; Chas. Churchill, master-at-arms; and Mathew
Thompson, A.B.; Jno. Sumner, A.B.</p>
<p>"Thompson killed Churchill who was made Erree or chief of
Tiarraboo,<sup>*</sup> and the Tiarraboo people killed
Thompson.</p>
<p class="note">[* Churchill went to live with a chief named
Whaeatuah at Tiarrabu.]</p>
<p>"George Stewart, Thos. McIntosh, and Richard Skinner each left a
daughter by women here. Thos. Burkitt and John Millward each had a
son. I have seen none of them and some are said to be dead. The man
whom Captain Cox left here called Brown had a son.<sup>*</sup> He
sailed with Captain Edwards four months before Vancouver arrived.
The anchor which Christian left behind the natives got and
delivered to Captain Edwards. Captain Vancouver with Lieutenant
Broughton arrived here after the 'Pandora' and stayed five weeks.
After he sailed on January 12th, 1792, a disease afflicted the
natives and they declare it was caught on board."</p>
<p class="note">[* Brown had wounded a messmate on board the
"Mercury," and on being punished desired that he might remain at
Tahiti: "We were glad to get rid of the troublesome
fellow".--Mortimer.]</p>
<p>With reference to the above it will be of interest to recall at
this point some of the principal incidents which attended the
mutiny of the "Bounty" both with regard to the mutineers and their
captain. We are less concerned, however, with the fate of the
former than with Bligh's feat in navigating the launch in which he
was turned adrift from Tofua to Timor. Not only does it remain
unsurpassed as a feat of seamanship and perseverance, but it is
constantly referred to in the log-book of the "Providence". In
succeeding chapters Bligh shows how closely he followed his former
track in order to verify his observations and to complete and
amplify his discoveries.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE MUTINY OF THE
"BOUNTY"</h2>
<p>The "Bounty" left Spithead on December 23rd, 1787, with a crew
of forty-four men all told. Lieutenant Bligh was instructed to sail
to Tahiti round Cape Horn, but at the same time he was told that
if, on his arrival off the South American coast, he found the
season too late to allow him to proceed by that route, he was to
turn back and make his way to the Cape of Good Hope and thence sail
to Tahiti.</p>
<p>The ship touched at Teneriffe and again set forth on her voyage
to South America, sighting the coast of Tierra del Fuego on March
23rd, 1788. She struggled against contrary winds for four weeks in
trying to round Cape Horn, until seeing it was hopeless to contend
with the westerly gales, Bligh bore away to the Cape of Good Hope
where he came to an anchorage in False Bay on May 22nd.</p>
<p>After a stay of thirty-eight days in False Bay, the "Bounty"
steered to Tasmania, passing St. Paul Island on July 28th. From
this time until she arrived in Tasmania, the ship experienced rough
weather, and frequently encountered snow-storms.</p>
<p>Eventually she reached Adventure Bay, discovered fifteen years
before by Captain Furneaux who had named it after his ship, but
neither he nor Bligh knew that it was an indentation of an island
now known to us as Bruni Island. Here some natives were
interviewed. Bligh compares the noise of their chattering to the
cackling of geese. He gave them presents wrapped in paper; they
took out the articles and placed them on their heads in token of
thanks, just as Witsen records that the natives in the Gulf of
Carpentaria did with some presented them by Dutch seamen many years
before. While the "Bounty" was in Tasmania, Bligh learnt much about
the coast and found a bay north-west of Adventure Bay, which to-day
ranks as a discovery of D'Entrecasteaux whose name is borne by the
strait.</p>
<p>Leaving Tasmania on September 4th, Bligh stood to the
south-east, rounded New Zealand, and discovered the Bounty Isles,
so named by him in honour of his ship. From these southern
latitudes he worked northward to Tahiti where he arrived on October
26th. Here he remained for twenty-three weeks, and during his
lengthy stay his sailors became intimate with the daily life of the
Tahitians. The charm of native life, the loveliness of the island,
and particularly the attractions of the native women, seem to have
fascinated them, and the glimpse of liberty after long restraint on
board ship had such an effect upon them that before they left
Tahiti some of the men were ready to cut every tie that bound them
either to the service of their country or to the ship.</p>
<p>On January 5th, while Bligh was visiting Toahroah Harbour in his
search for breadfruit plants, Charles Churchill (the ship's
corporal) and two seamen, Musprat and Millward, made off with the
cutter intending to desert. The chiefs were asked by Bligh to help
to bring back the men, and they soon discovered the boat, but it
was found that the three men had fled in a sailing canoe to
Teturoah, some islets north-west of Tahiti. On the 23rd
intelligence was brought to Bligh that the deserters had gone past
the harbour of Toahroah and had put in to Tettaha 5 miles away.
Here, with the aid of a chief named Teppahoo, the men were captured
or rather delivered themselves up at the last possible moment. This
incident will show that before ever the "Bounty" had put to sea
from Tahiti the idea of getting their freedom had entered the minds
of at least some of the men.</p>
<p>The "Bounty" left Tahiti on April 5th, 1789, and steered to
Huaheine which Cook had visited in 1777. Upon leaving there Bligh
followed almost the same course as Cook had taken, and sighted land
in the southwest on April 11th, which proved to be an island,
hitherto unknown, called by its inhabitants Wytootackee or
Aitutacki. Continuing her course westward, the "Bounty" proceeded
past Savage Island (Niue) which Cook had discovered, and three days
later made Kao, a vast rock of conic figure, which is the
north-westernmost of the Tonga or Friendly Islands.</p>
<p>On the 23rd she anchored in the roads of Annamooka, called
Rotterdam by Tasman, where a native chief of Mango Island, another
of the Tongas, was entertained on board. The situation being
unsuitable for watering, Bligh weighed and anchored again slightly
further to the eastward, where several chiefs who had seen Cook's
ship in 1777 came to visit him. On the 26th, however, the grapnel
was stolen, and Bligh detained some of them on board, hoping that
it would be restored; but they appeared so distressed at their
situation that he, being uncertain whether they were guilty of the
theft, released them.</p>
<p>On April 27th the ship made sail, the voyage until this time
having been in Bligh's words one of "uninterrupted prosperity". He
at all events had no suspicion of what was about to occur.</p>
<p>The "Bounty" was passing south of Tofua, one of the Tonga
Islands lying westward of the Haapai Group in 19&deg; 45' S., when,
just before sunrise, Bligh was awakened by the presence of a number
of men in his cabin. In a letter written later to Sir Joseph Banks,
Bligh describes what happened:--</p>
<p>"On April 28th at break of day, Fletcher Christian, officer of
the watch: Charles Churchill, ship's corporal: Thomas Burkitt,
seaman, and several others, came into my cabin, and while I was
asleep seized and tied my hands behind my back with a strong cord,
and with cutlasses and a bayonet fixed at my breast threatened
instant death if I spoke or made the least noise. I was hauled on
deck in my shirt, held by Fletcher Christian and Charles Churchill,
with two men, Alexander Smith and Thomas Burkitt, behind me with
loaded musquets cocked...under this guard I was kept abaft the
mizen mast.</p>
<p>"Mr. Samuel, my clerk, secured to me a quadrant and compass,
some clothes, my journals, and a few ship's papers, but all my
valuable instruments, a timepiece...a valuable collection of books,
maps, and drawings with my remarks and observations for fifteen
years past, were kept from me. The officers and men being now drove
into the boat, I was told by Christian, 'Sir, your officers are now
in the boat and you must go with them'. I was then taken hold of
and forced over the gangway into the boat which waited only for
me...a few pounds of pork were thrown to us, and each began to
solicit some valuables. I desired some fire-arms, but was told I
should have none. Four cutlasses, however, were thrown into the
boat and we were cast adrift."</p>
<p>With frequent shouts of "Huzza for Otaheite" from the mutineers,
the ship steered away to the W.N.W., while the launch rowed towards
Tofua, 10 leagues to the north-east. There were with Bligh the
following men: John Fryer, master; Thos. Ledward, acting surgeon;
David Nelson, botanist; Wm. Peckover, gunner; Wm. Cole, boatswain;
Wm. Purcell, carpenter; Wm. Elphinstone, master's mate; Thos.
Hayward and John Hallet, midshipmen; John Norton and Peter
Linkletter, quartermasters; Laurence Lebogue, sailmaker; Jno. Smith
and Thos. Hall, cooks; Geo. Simpson, quartermaster's mate; Robert
Tinkler, boy; R. Lamb, butcher, and Mr. Samuel, clerk, making with
the commander nineteen men in all.</p>
<p>The boat in which they were cast adrift was only 23 feet from
stem to stern and rowed six oars; their provisions consisted of 150
lbs. of bread; 28 gallons of water; 16 pieces of pork (weighing
each 2 lbs.); and there were also in the boat 6 quarts of rum and 6
bottles of wine.</p>
<p>Bligh estimated that these provisions would only last his people
for one week, and determined first to seek breadfruit and water at
Tofua. He intended afterwards to sail to Tongataboo, and there
solicit from Poulaho, the king, sufficient supplies to enable him
to reach Timor.</p>
<p>The weather fortunately was calm and they arrived at Tofua after
dark, paddling with two oars so as to keep the boat all night under
the lee of the island. At dawn a cove was discovered on the
north-west part where the grapnel was let go. Here a small party
landed to look for food, and a little water was obtained. Bligh
issued very meagre rations as he was anxious to reserve a store for
their future needs. A few of the men, however, climbed the cliffs
and found cocoanuts, and these afforded every one a meal. As the
sea was too stormy the launch did not proceed further for several
days. During their stay, while some of their company were seeking
supplies on May 1st, they met with natives who, although curious to
know what had become of the ship, were peaceful and brought
breadfruit and plantains in exchange for buttons which the men cut
off their clothes.</p>
<p>On this day the stock of water and provisions greatly increased;
but on the following day the natives were restless. Three canoes
came in, bringing chiefs who held consultations; then the natives
began to gather round the white men in increasing numbers, and as
the hours went by they lit fires and took up their positions round
them for the night. Judging that these were symptoms of hostility,
Bligh gave orders on the return of the watering party for every one
to be ready to embark. When it became known that the white men were
going to leave, a chief said to Bligh: "You will not sleep on
shore? Then we will kill you," and at the same time the natives,
who were lining the beach, began to knock stones together in their
hands in a threatening way.</p>
<p>The sun was setting as Bligh, taking a native by one hand and
holding his cutlass in the other, walked with his people towards
the boat and watched them embark. All were filled with horror at
their situation. No sooner were they in the boat (with the
exception of Norton, one of the quartermasters who ran to cast off
the sternfast rope) than the attack began. The stones flew round
them like a shower of shot. Poor Norton was immediately knocked
down, and some of the natives were seen to run forward and beat him
about the head with stones, while others rushed into the water and
tried to haul the launch on shore. They would have succeeded if
Bligh had not cut the rope with his knife. Even then they were
followed by twelve men in canoes who kept up a terrific fusillade
of stones. In order to divert their attention some clothes were
thrown overboard, and at last, principally by aid of the darkness,
the launch got away, but with all on board more or less bruised and
wounded. They then set sail and steered alongshore on the west side
of Tofua. Bligh's companions now entreated him to take them to a
place of safety. In reply he told them that the only hope of their
being able to save their lives was to reach Timor, fully 1200
leagues away, and that unless they could find food in New Holland,
this would mean that each man must live upon one ounce of bread and
a quarter of a pint of water a day.</p>
<p>They promised him not to exceed that allowance, and he begged
them solemnly to adhere to this promise. He divided them into
watches and "putting the boat in order" bore away from Tofua at
eight o'clock in the evening of May 2nd. Then all thanked God for
having spared their lives.</p>
<p><a name="mothe" id="mothe"></a>Next day they weathered a furious
gale which carried the launch before it, and at noon she was 86
miles W.N.W. of Tofua. The commander set his course in order that
he might sight Fiji, for the natives had pointed out to him the
direction in which the group was to be found. On May 4th he entered
the group between the islands of Mothe and Namuka and then steered
north-west, passing between Vanua Vatu and Moala. The latter island
has been called one of the discoveries made in his second
voyage.<sup>*</sup> Continuing in the sane direction, he took the
launch to the northward of Nairai Island, and went between two
other islands, Koro and Makongai. He then turned and proceeded
through the Makongai Passage which lies to the north-east of
Ovalau, after which he sailed due westward for a short distance
across a shoal in the Vatu-i-Thake Passage which had only 4 feet of
water on it. Turning again to the north-west he passed through the
Vitu-ira Channel and across the waters which separate the Yasawa
Group from Viti Levu, and got clear out to sea by way of Round
Island Passage--a magnificent piece of seamanship.</p>
<p class="note">[* The details of this part of Bligh's voyage are
to be found in the chart at p. 146.<br>

(The chart referred to was of such poor quality in the copy of the

Voyage to the South Sea</i>, has been included instead of the chart

<i>Ed</i>.)]</p>
<p>In Bligh's chart the Yasawa Group appears as one island, and
possibly Bligh thought that it was connected with Viti Levu, for
the long straggling barrier reef stretches from it for 90 miles
towards the centre of Viti Levu's north coast. Matthew Flinders
remarks somewhat curiously when writing about Z Island (the
letter-name Bligh gave to Viti Levu), that off the north coast of
this land the commander was chased by a canoe, but the entry in the
"Bounty's" log-book,<sup>*</sup> May 7th, 1789, runs:--</p>
<p>"At 10 two small rocky islets now made the northern extreme of
the land we had to weather against a lee current, setting us on the
shore. We now saw two large sailing canoes coming after us
alongshore, within the islets, which now bore W.N.W. 2 miles, and
the Round Hill Island N.E. by E."</p>
<p class="note">[* In the MS. log as written up by Bligh, now at
the Admiralty.]</p>
<p>A reef enclosed these two rocky islets from which the sailing
canoes came, and Bligh says the current set him near the shore and
he could only get clear of it by rowing and passing over the reef
surrounding the islets. Only one of the canoes gained on the
launch, and at three o'clock, when 2 miles off, it gave up the
chase.</p>
<p>After leaving Fiji a thunder-storm drenched the boat with heavy
rain, but 6 gallons of water were saved, and on the 8th, the
weather being fine, the people were able to dry their wet clothes.
Scanty meals were weighed out to each man with a pair of scales,
made by Bligh for this purpose out of two cocoanut shells, so that
every man was sure of getting an equal portion of
food.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The Rev. T. B. Murray, Prebendary of St. Paul's,
writing in 1857 says: "The very gourd out of which he (Bligh) ate
his miserable allowance; the little horn cup for serving a quarter
of a pint of water to each person; the bullet which weighed the
rations of bread, and though last, not least, the MS. book which
contains his notes and a prayer which he composed for their joint
devotion are all in existence".]</p>
<p>The boat's course was set to the north-west towards the New
Hebrides. The northern group of these islands (Banks Islands) were
seen on May 14th, after a week's sailing from Fiji, during which
time very great trials tested the endurance of the unfortunate men.
Their limbs grew so cramped that they could scarcely move them.
Frequently the sea ran right over their boat, and only constant
baling with all their might kept her afloat. Their food was the
smallest possible allowance of mouldy biscuit and pork with an
occasional cocoanut.</p>
<p>During this time Bligh needed all his courage and it did not
desert him. He did his best to interest his comrades in their
voyage by describing the situation of the places for which they
were steering,'that is to say, the northern shores of Australia and
Torres Strait. Of these he drew a sketch. He also endeavoured to
make the boat more comfortable. A pair of shrouds were fitted for
each mast and a weather cloth placed round the boat while the
quarters were raised, all of which proved of considerable
benefit.</p>
<p>The Banks Group seen on May 14th consists of the islands of
Vanua Lava, Valua, Ureparapara, and Mota. They were thought by
Bligh to be a new discovery, but Quiros had already seen them in
1606.</p>
<p>"The sight of these islands served only to increase the misery
of our situation," says Bligh. He did not dare seek relief there in
his weakened state, and "prolonging life even in the midst of so
much privation seemed preferable while there remained hopes of
being able to surmount our hardships". At noon on the 16th, the
launch was over 1200 miles distant from Tofua.</p>
<p>Next day saw every one complaining. They were very wretched for
the night had been extremely cold, and all were growing very weak.
Some begged for more food which the commander was forced to refuse
them. On the 10th he remarks: "Our appearances were horrible, and I
could look nowhere without seeing distress". The extreme hunger
which now assailed the men was perhaps the hardest fight of all
they had to endure. Fortunately the wet weather prevented great
thirst and most likely saved their lives. After each rainstorm
Bligh told the men to wring out their clothes and then dip them in
sea water, and this proved beneficial; but the discomfort of having
to sit so long in their wet things caused cramp and severe pains in
their bones.</p>
<p>Towards noon on May 21st the sun shone and greatly cheered every
one, and on this day Bligh believed himself to be on a meridian
with the easternmost part of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Another miserable night followed. The sea came over the boat
with tremendous force and kept its crew constantly baling. Bligh
writes: "Our situation to-day is highly perilous. If ever men
experienced the power of Divine Providence we do at this instant".
This gale continued until the evening of the 23rd, when the wind
moderated and a fine Sunday morning dawned and cheered them a
little. The threadbare clothes were dried, but they would keep out
neither rain nor cold. Boobies and noddies now flew about the
launch.</p>
<p>While the weather was fair Bligh determined to examine the food,
when it was found that there was sufficient remaining to last
twenty-nine days. To the joy of all on the 25th a noddy was caught.
It was equally divided, and bones and all were eaten with salt
water "as a sauce". A baited line was always left trailing over the
end of the boat in hopes that a fish would bite, and a sharp
look-out was kept for birds venturing near. A booby, a bird as
large as a duck, was caught on the 25th, which provided a good
meal, and two were caught again on the 26th. On this day the
branches of trees came floating by which looked as if they had not
been long in the water, then a gannet was seen, and Bligh knew that
land, which he believed would be the Barrier Reef of Australia, was
not far off.</p>
<p>At midnight on the 28th he heard the sound of breakers and next
day fell in with reefs on which the sea was breaking furiously;
soon afterwards, at nine in the morning, in the latitude of 12&deg; 51'
S. a break in them about a quarter of a mile broad was discovered,
through which the launch passed into smooth water and hardships for
the time were forgotten.</p>
<p>An island within the reef which at this time bore due west was
called Direction Island. The break in the Great Barrier Reef, ever
since called Bligh Boat Entrance, through which Bligh passed, is 12
miles north of the Second Three Mile opening in the reef, and it
lies to the south of Providential Channel where Cook entered and
which is in 12&deg; 34' S.</p>
<p>As the launch steered to the north-west, the mainland, now known
as Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, was visible, as well as two
other islands 4 miles distant west by north. These lie close to the
mainland. The nearest was found to be a mere heap of stones, so the
launch sought shelter at the larger lying next the mainland (off
Cape Weymouth). There a fine bay and a sandy point afforded an easy
landing place.</p>
<p>Oysters, a welcome feast for starving men, were discovered on
the rocks, and for the first time since they had left their ship,
all enjoyed a night of rest and sleep. Next day a well was dug
(S.E. of Restoration Point) which produced good water. A fire was
lighted by the help of a magnifying glass, and as there was
fortunately a copper pot on board the launch, a stew was made with
the oysters and with the pork they had with them.</p>
<p>They soon found traces of native fires; two ill-constructed huts
showed that the natives had lived on this island, and a pointed
stick was picked up resembling those they had noticed in Tasmania.
The track of an animal was also seen, conjectured to be that of a
kangaroo which possibly had swum over from the mainland.</p>
<p>This island was named Restoration Island by Bligh, not only
because the health of his men became somewhat restored, but also on
account of the day being the Anniversary of the Restoration of King
Charles II.</p>
<p>On the 30th, having collected everything edible that the island
would afford, Bligh got ready to put to sea. Thanksgivings for
their preservation thus far had been offered, and the men were
preparing to embark when twenty natives appeared on the mainland
opposite running with shouts of surprise towards the white men.
They were armed with spears and made signs to the visitors to come
to them, but Bligh thought it more prudent to leave at once. He
steered away passing between two islands and the mainland towards a
cape which he called Fair Cape. At night he found himself embayed
near the low land (south of Cape Grenville) and had to stand back
to the southward in order to get clear of the land.</p>
<p>Proceeding northward again at daybreak he was surprised at the
change in the nature of the Queensland coast, for low sandhills,
which he describes as milk-white, ran down to the water's edge and
there was little or no verdure. He now saw inhabited islands and
many covered with wood lying close to the mainland. These were the
Home Islands. The land then bore N. 4 miles and Fair Cape S.S.E. 5
or 6 leagues.</p>
<p>He took the launch through the channel between the nearest
island and the coast, naming an indentation Indian Bay because
there another party of black fellows, seven in number, were seen on
the shore who, like the others, shouted and made signs for the boat
to come to land. Some of them waved green branches and seemed
peaceable, others looked less friendly, and farther off there was a
much larger party whose presence determined Bligh not to go ashore
although his boat lay close to the rocks. He beckoned instead to
the nearest natives to approach the launch, but none would come
nearer than 200 yards. They were stark naked, jet black in colour,
with short bushy hair, and closely resembled those seen from
Restoration Island.</p>
<p>At this time an island, which was afterwards called Sunday
Island by Bligh, was seen, bearing N. W. 4 miles, and he resolved
to land and examine it. He arrived there at eight o'clock in the
morning of Sunday, May 31st.</p>
<p>The shore was rocky, but the water was smooth and the landing
took place without difficulty. Two parties were sent out; one went
northward, the other took a southerly route to look for food and
water. A third party remained with the boat. This made some of the
sailors who had been ordered to seek supplies discontented, and the
carpenter declined to go, saying that he would rather do without
dinner than go in search of it. He showed himself so mutinous that
Bligh, recognising the danger that might result from his bad
example and determined to maintain discipline, seized a cutlass and
called on him to take another and defend himself, at which he
became submissive and gave no further trouble.</p>
<p>On looking from the highest point of Sunday Island Bligh could
still see no coast excepting the low white sandhills on the
northern part of the nearest mainland. The small islands now lay
E.S.E. and a small key, or cay as they are more often called in
these days, bore north-west, this being considerably farther away
from the shores of Queensland than the island on which Bligh was
standing.</p>
<p>Sunday Island was very barren and produced only a few poor
bushes, but oysters, shell-fish, and some rainwater were found
among the rocks. On the north side of it in a sandy bay Bligh found
an old native canoe lying bottom upwards on the beach, and half
buried in the sand. It had a sharp projecting prow rudely carved to
resemble the head of a fish, and it was made in three pieces, being
capable of carrying twenty men.</p>
<p>When he saw this, Bligh decided to seek another anchorage and
left Sunday Island. It lay N. by W. &frac34; W. from Restoration Island,
and both places to-day bear the names he bestowed on them. On the
following day he steered to the key seen in the north-west,
reaching it before dark on June 1st. It was surrounded by a reef of
rocks which made landing dangerous. The launch worked round to the
north side of it and was there brought to a grapnel. Bligh called
it Lagoon Island; it was one of the Bird Islands. Bligh expected to
find turtle here but was disappointed. Clams and
dolichos<sup>*</sup> were discovered. After eating these Mr. Nelson
and several others felt very ill, but a little wine seems to have
restored them.</p>
<p class="note">[* The genus of kidney bean to which the Indian
gram belongs.]</p>
<p>The launch was not destined to stay here long, however much
those on board needed rest. Samuel the clerk and Peckover the
gunner had been told to light a fire, and Bligh cautioned them not
to make a large one for fear the natives might see it. While he was
walking along the beach to his dismay he suddenly saw what seemed
to him the whole island in a blaze. This had been caused by the
carelessness of the master who, wanting a fire to himself, had
neglected to prevent it spreading to the dry grass which was soon
in flames. Later, Samuel and Peckover were sent to look for birds
for the sea store and returned at midnight with only twelve
noddies, a bird about the size of a pigeon. They might have caught
many more had not one of their party separated from the others and
frightened the birds. The commander, who was anxious to lay in a
store of food for the voyage, was so angry with the offender, whose
name was Robert Lamb, that he gave him a good beating.</p>
<p>On June 2nd at dawn of day all embarked in the launch and ran to
the north-west. When they had gone 2 leagues the sea became very
rough, as if they were passing a channel open to the sea. Soon
afterwards they made a large shoal with two keys between which and
two others Bligh passed to the northward. Towards noon six small
keys appeared, most of them covered with small trees and brushwood
or mallee. They formed a pleasing contrast with the mainland which
now seemed nothing but low sandhills, while the country farther
northward appeared like downs sloping to the sea.</p>
<p>Continuing to voyage along the Queensland coast the launch came
abreast of a flat-topped hill which Bligh named Pudding Pan Hill,
and it is still so called. Two other hills near it were named the
Paps.</p>
<p>A cape whence the coast inclined to the north-west (Shadwell
Point) was passed, then "a large and fair inlet" in 11&deg; S. which is
known to us as Newcastle Bay. Three leagues to the northward of
this is an island in a wild situation where Bligh took shelter for
the night, and where turtle bones and shells, the remains of a
native feast, were seen, and for this reason he named the island,
which is in 10&deg; 52' S., Turtle Island.</p>
<p>The coast of Queensland abreast of Turtle Island looked sandy,
and 3 leagues to the northward terminated in a point (Cape York),
near to which were several islands. At daylight on June 3rd the
launch left Australia and steered between these islands; a high
mountainous island with a flat top (Mount Adolphus) lay on the
starboard side. Three rocks to the southeast of it Bligh named the
Brothers. To-day they are called North Brother, Mid Brother, and
South Brother. Bligh then passed what he thought was an indentation
in the mainland to which he gave the name Bay of Islands. This
opening was really Endeavour Strait, and even then Bligh must have
had some idea where he was for he afterwards wrote in his journal:
"I have little doubt that the opening which I have named Bay of
Islands is Endeavour Strait, and that our track was to the
northward of Prince of Wales Islands".</p>
<p>He continued to steer through Torres Strait where he saw several
islands; the northernmost was a mountainous island (Banks Island on
which is Mount Augustus) and a smaller one "was remarkable for a
single peaked hill" (Mount Ernest Island). Bligh passed round
Wednesday Island which he named, fell in with a reef to the
north-west of it (North-West Reef), and passing between it and
Wednesday Island went through Prince of Wales Channel out of Torres
Strait. By passing north of Prince of Wales Island, while Cook had
passed south of it, Bligh opened up a new channel and added to his
discoveries.</p>
<p>On Thursday, June 4th, he gave the name of Shoal Cape to a point
of Prince of Wales Island, and called a small island covered with
boobies which bore west of it Booby Key. By a curious coincidence
Cook had already given it the same name.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock at night the launch was once more in the open
sea. She steered westward, and on the 6th the course was altered to
W.N.W. The sea ran high, and frequent showers of rain caused great
discomfort to the men who now seemed less able than before to
withstand their privations.</p>
<p>Ledward the surgeon and Lebogue,<sup>*</sup> a hardy old seaman,
appeared to be giving way. Wine was served out to them occasionally
by Bligh. On the 8th a dolphin was caught and divided as usual, and
Bligh, to encourage the sick men, told them that at the present
rate he was sailing he would be in Timor in a few days. On the 10th
all the men seemed to have greatly altered for the worse. Their
legs 'swelled and their countenances are described as "ghastly".
The boatswain remarked that the commander looked worse than anybody
in the boat. Bligh says that the simplicity with which he said this
amused him and he returned him a better compliment. Patches of
rockweed and the birds showed that land was near, and early in the
morning of the 12th, to the great relief and joy of all, Timor was
sighted. It scarcely seemed possible for them, in an open boat and
so poorly provided with food, to have reached their goal, a
distance of 3618 miles in forty-one days. They first touched the
coast S.W. of Coupang where natives brought them dried turtle and
Indian corn, and on the 14th they anchored at Coupang where they
landed, looking, as Bligh says, like so many spectres, their bodies
skin and bone, all covered with sores, and their clothes in
tatters.</p>
<p class="note">[* Lawrence Lebogue not only survived but shipped
again under Bligh in the "Providence".]</p>
<p>The Governor, Mr. Van Este, although very ill, Mr.
Wanjon,<sup>*</sup> and Captain Spikerman received them with great
kindness, and every kind of relief was afforded them. To Bligh's
sorrow Mr. Nelson, the botanist, died of fever on July 10th. He was
buried with many signs of respect from the inhabitants of Coupang,
and the commander himself read the burial service.</p>
<p class="note">[* or Vanion.]</p>
<p>A schooner, the "Resource," was purchased here, and Bligh and
his men left in her on August 10th for Batavia, where they arrived
on October 1st. Here Thomas Hall, one of the cooks, died. The
"Resource" was sold, and passages for the men were obtained in
various ships sailing to Europe. Lieutenant Bligh, with Samuel, his
clerk, and John Smith, went home in the "Vlydte" bound for Holland.
On March 14th, off the Isle of Wight, Bligh and his men left the
ship and a boat landed them at Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Four others besides those mentioned did not survive to reach
home. Elphinstone, master's mate, and Linkletter, quartermaster,
died at Batavia; Robert Lamb on the passage home, and Mr. Ledward
also succumbed. Thus only twelve out of the nineteen who had been
cast adrift lived to reach their native land.</p>
<p>When Bligh and his companions were turned adrift in their boat,
there were left on board the "Bounty" with Fletcher Christian
twenty-four of the ablest men of the ship's company: they were as

<p>Christian had assumed command. He did not steer at once to
Tahiti but took the vessel to Tubuai, one of the Austral Group, in
20&deg; 23' S. and longitude 149&deg; 28' W., where he anchored on May
25th, 1789.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the breadfruit trees which had taken so long to
collect were thrown overboard, the ship was ransacked, and the
property of Bligh and his companions was divided among the
mutineers. Their leader took possession of Bligh's cabin and
ordered the rest to call him Mr. Christian. As there was a scarcity
of provisions at Tubuai, Christian decided to visit Tahiti, where
the "Bounty" arrived on June 6th, much to the surprise of the
natives. They immediately asked where Bligh was, and were told that
he had gone to England and that Cook was at Wytootackee. Christian
returned to Tubuai in the "Bounty" on June 23rd, taking with
him--according to Bligh's account--ten men, two boys, nine women,
and one girl, and the live stock given to him by the islanders.</p>
<p>On the voyage bad weather was encountered and most of the live
stock died. When he arrived at Tubuai Christian started to build a
fort which he meant to defend with the "Bounty's" guns. These
proceedings so alarmed the natives that they made an attack on
their visitors, and Christian and another man were wounded, while
many natives lost their lives.</p>
<p>In addition to defending himself against the natives, Christian
had to listen to murmurings of discontent among his own people.
Morrison, Heywood, and Stewart formed a plan to escape to Tahiti in
the cutter, but owing to its unsound condition the design was
abandoned. At length, finding it impossible for them to agree
together, Christian decided to abandon Tubuai and return to Tahiti,
and land there all those who chose to quit the ship. Before sailing
he received on board a Tubuaian chief who was friendly to him, and
three of his servants: three other Tubuaians and twelve women were
also passengers. The "Bounty" then put to sea and arrived at
Matavai Bay on September 22nd.</p>
<p>Here sixteen men, among them Stewart, Heywood, and Morrison,
left the "Bounty," while eight men elected to remain with
Christian, who, during the ship's short stay in Tahiti, divided the
small arms and powder belonging to the ship equally among the men.
After spending a few hours on shore with Stewart and Heywood at the
house of a chief, Christian bade his comrades farewell and returned
to the "Bounty". They weighed anchor at daylight on the 23rd and
carried away, according to Bligh's account, nine Tubuaian men, one
Tahitian man, two boys, and six women (probably in addition to the
women brought from Tubuai).<sup>*</sup> The Tahitians were not told
where Christian intended to go, but he had been heard to say that
he meant to seek an uninhabited island where he would run the ship
ashore and break her up.</p>
<p class="note">[* In the Appendix to the History of the Mutiny,
Universal Lib., vol i., the numbers are 7 men and 12 women of
Tahiti.]</p>
<p>The natives treated the men who remained at Tahiti very
hospitably. Several of them took Tahitian women for their wives.
Mr. Stewart married the young daughter of a chief named Tippaoo or
Teppahoo, who owned a large tract of country.</p>
<p>After the "Bounty's" departure Morrison undertook to build a
schooner by means of which he hoped to reach Batavia with his
companions and to get back to Europe in a Dutch ship. With the
assistance of the carpenter and the cooper the schooner was
finished: she was named the "Resolution," and is described as being
a very fast little ship. Morrison and his companions embarked in
her and had actually set sail on their voyage when, finding their
stores insufficient, they were obliged to return to Tahiti.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Churchill who, with Thompson, had gone to live with
Whaeatuah at Tiarrabu or the lesser peninsula of Tahiti, became so
popular with the chiefs that they raised him to the rank of a
chief. Thompson and he, it is said, were not always on friendly
terms. Churchill tried to persuade the natives to steal Thompson's
pistol. On finding out what he had done Thompson shot Churchill at
sight, and soon afterwards the natives (out of revenge) killed
Thompson. By this time Mr. Stewart was a man of some property, and
Mr. Heywood also possessed a pretty home not far from Matavai
Bay.</p>
<p>In 1791 Captain Edwards, who had been sent to search for the
mutineers, arrived at Tahiti in the "Pandora". He captured the
remaining fourteen men and the schooner "Resolution" which Morrison
had built. The men were put in irons, and Stewart was parted from
his Tahitian wife, whom he had named Peggy. It is recorded that the
first meeting of the two after his capture, on board the "Pandora,"
was heartrending, and the poor girl died two months after his
departure from a broken heart, leaving a little child who later on
was educated by the missionaries.<sup>*</sup> Captain Edwards
manned the schooner with some of the "Pandora's" men, and took her
away as tender to his ship when he left Tahiti. The two vessels
parted company off Tutuila, but Edwards met the schooner again in
Java after he had lost the "Pandora". The schooner's crew had
suffered great privations and had been imprisoned by the Dutch, but
they were released and returned home with Edwards. The schooner was
sold at Batavia, and it is recorded that she afterwards made a
record voyage between China and the Sandwich Islands, and was the
means of preserving the lives of the crew of the "Providence" in
1797 when that ship was wrecked off Formosa.</p>
<p class="note">[* In Chapter VII Bligh records:<br>
<br>
"A fine child about twelve months old was brought me to-day--the
daughter of George Stewart, midshipman of the 'Bounty'; it was a
very pretty creature, but had been so exposed to the sun as to be
little fairer than an Otaheitan."]</p>
<p>The "Pandora" left Tahiti on May 8th. She made an unsuccessful
search for the "Bounty" among various islands in the Pacific and at
length sailed for home. On August 29th, while running along the
Great Barrier Reef off the north-east coast of Australia, the ship
struck what is now known as the Pandora's Shoal, and her people
were forced to take to the boats. The unfortunate prisoners at the
time were still in confinement in the "'Pandora's' Box," as their
horrible prison was called, excepting three who had been liberated
to work at the pumps. Probably none of the others would have been
saved if Moulter, the boatswain's mate of the "Pandora," had not
risked his life to set them free. In spite of his heroism, four
prisoners went down with the ship, Stewart and Sumner being struck
down by the gangway and Skinner and Hillbrant being drowned while
still in their handcuffs.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Lady Belcher's account.]</p>
<p>Captain Edwards, with those who were saved, managed to reach
Coupang in the ship's boats, and from there they went to Batavia.
The shipwrecked crew obtained passages in Dutch ships as far as the
Cape of Good Hope, where on their arrival they were transferred to
H.M.S. "Gorgon" for a passage to England, and arrived at Spithead
on June 19th, 1792.</p>
<p><a name="heywood" id="heywood"></a>Thus ten of the mutineers
regained their native land where a court martial was held on
September 12th, under the presidency of Lord Hood, to investigate
the charges laid against them. The proceedings lasted six days, and
as a result of the evidence which was then produced, the charges
against Heywood, Morrison, Ellison, Burkitt, Millward, and Musprat
were declared proved, but Heywood and Morrison were recommended to
mercy. Norman, Coleman, McIntosh, and Byrne, who had all wished to
accompany Bligh into the launch, were acquitted. Millward, Burkitt,
and Ellison were hanged on board the "Brunswick" on October 29th,
1792. Shortly afterwards His Majesty sent a free pardon to Heywood,
Morrison, and Musprat. Heywood, who had not completed his sixteenth
year at the time of the mutiny, rejoined the Navy (as did
Morrison), and his subsequent career was most distinguished. He saw
much hard service, attained the rank of captain, and died in 1825.
Morrison perished in the "Blenheim" in 1807.</p>
<p>In the meantime Fletcher Christian had sought for and found the
remote island where he wished to live undisturbed with his people.
He fell in with Pitcairn Island,<sup>*</sup> discovered by Captain
Carteret in 25&deg; 4' S. and 130&deg; 25' W., which was well out of the
track of any ship. Here the "Bounty" after being dismantled, was
set on fire and run on the rocks. The English divided the island up
among themselves: they built houses for their families and
cultivated the ground, but it is said they gave nothing to the
Tahitians. For two years all went well until Williams lost his
wife. He then took one belonging to a Tahitian. For this injury
done to one of their countrymen, the black men were determined to
have their revenge. The women, however, revealed their plot to the
white men, and in consequence two Tahitians were put to death.</p>
<p class="note">[* Pitcairn Island was named by Carteret after the
midshipman who first saw it from the masthead.]</p>
<p>For a little while the settlers lived together peaceably, then
again violence was used by the English towards the Tahitians who
rose up and attacked them. In this quarrel Fletcher Christian,
Williams, and Mills were killed. Quintal and McKoy sought refuge in
the mountains and escaped. Young was saved by the aid of the women,
and Alexander Smith or John Adams, as he was now called, was able
to make his peace with the natives. The Tahitians now chose wives
for themselves, and for a short time they lived quietly until
violent disputes again broke out; one of the Tahitian men was shot
by Young, and the rest were killed by the Tahitian women, who were
more attached to the white men than to their own countrymen.</p>
<p>After this the men who had fled to the mountains returned to the
settlement, which brought the number of the white men there up to
four, Young, Adams, McKoy, and Quintal. There was another quiet
interval until McKoy, who was a Scotsman with a love of whisky, and
who was always trying to manufacture spirit out of various plants,
succeeded in making some from the root of the tee tree. Through
drinking this spirit he and Quintal constantly became intoxicated,
and, in a fit of delirium caused by it, McKoy one day committed
suicide by throwing himself over a cliff. Later on Quintal became
violent in his actions, and at last attempted to murder Young and
Adams, so that, for their own preservation, they were forced to put
him to death.</p>
<p>The two men who were left seem to have become changed
characters, and set to work to rule the settlement wisely and
methodically. They read the Bible to the children, instructing them
in its teachings and instituting regular services on Sunday for
them. Young died a year after Quintal, but Adams continued to live
steadily, and ended by being beloved and looked up to by the whole
of the settlement. Its members lived tranquilly, entirely isolated
from the outside world until February, 1808, when Captain Mayhew
Tolger, in the American ship "Topaz," touched at Pitcairn Island to
procure seals, supposing the island to be uninhabited. He saw
thirty-five persons there, speaking English and Tahitian fluently.
He also discovered an azimuth compass and a timepiece which had
belonged to the "Bounty," so that he soon knew who they were. The
compass he returned to the Admiralty in 1813. When the intelligence
of the existence of these settlers reached London, H.M.S. "Briton"
was told to call there, and she reached the island on September
17th, 1814. Her commander, Sir Thomas Staines, found everything
regulated in the most exact order; every family possessing its
separate property, and John Adams leading the men and the women to
work every day. In 1819 Captain Arthur of the American Whaler
"Russell" touched at Pitcairn Island. It had then fifty
inhabitants, Adams and six Tahitian women being the only survivors
of those who had originally landed from the "Bounty". Adams assured
Captain Arthur that there were signs that the island had been
inhabited before they arrived there, but by whom and at what period
it was difficult to conjecture. A party from the "Russell" found
several clearings where houses had once stood, as well as burying
places and images representing a human figure. Adams or Smith, the
last of the mutineers, died in 1829.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* <i>Evangelical Magazine</i>, vol. xxx., p.
459.]</p>
<p>As the community soon grew too numerous for the island to
support the people, the British Government offered them Norfolk
Island, as a gift, in 1856. The whole of the settlers, numbering
192, were conveyed thither in the "Morayshire". They, however, were
not happy there, and, longing for their old home, most of them
gradually returned to Pitcairn Island, where in 1906 their
population numbered 146 persons.</p>
<p>While the author has been actually writing this account of the
mutineers, a piece of cloth, the handiwork of the wives of two of
them, has been shown to her. It is made after the pattern of the
Tahitian cloth, and a slip of paper attached to it bears the
following inscription "Tapa or cloth made from the paper mulberry.
This piece of Tapa was made at Pitcairn Island by Mrs. Christian
and Mrs. Young, the only survivors of the original settlers from
the 'Bounty'". Unfortunately no date is given, but the cloth is
well preserved under glass in a small frame, and is a most
interesting memento of the first settlers at Pitcairn Island.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. IN MATAVAI
BAY.</h2>
<p>We now return to the story of Bligh's second voyage. He had
received a warm welcome from many old friends on his arrival at
Matavai Bay, and he and his officers soon began to carry out
energetically the objects of their visit. He took up a position on
shore on some rising ground a quarter of a mile from Point Venus,
and, while he was personally superintending the collecting of the
breadfruit, availed himself of every opportunity of cultivating the
friendship of the Tahitians.</p>
<p>He writes:--</p>
<p>"Wednesday, April 11th, 1792. Employed getting fresh water off
and trading with the natives for hogs, breadfruit, tarro,
cocoanuts, and some fowls.</p>
<p>"Early in the morning I went to Oparre to see Otoo.<sup>*</sup>
He was overjoyed to see me. When I was here in the 'Bounty' he was
rather an ill-looking boy, but he is now grown a fine youth. None
of the ceremony took place between us that did then, although he
was very familiar and kept hold of my hand. He was carried astride
on a man's shoulders where he rode as on a horse and carried a
switch with which to beat back the crowd. He received presents of
clothes and iron tools with great thankfulness, and pressed me to
bring the ships down to Oparre. He had only a few bodyguards with
him, the whole district being employed against Matavai...Among my
old friends I saw Terrano, the wife of Teppahoo, a great chief of
Tettaha. This old woman, with her sister, clung about me, and
literally thanked God for saving me after I had lost the 'Bounty,'
for they were informed of the whole transaction. Teppahoo she told
me was dead...I found also that Moworoah, the uncle of Tynah, was
dead and lying-in-state on a teappopow at Oparre, and that Tynah's
eldest daughter had died of a decline. They told me that Odidee was
gone with Captain Edwards<sup>**</sup> in the 'Pandora' to Ulitea
and the rest of the Society Islands.</p>
<p class="note">[* "The Otaheitan regal name is Otoo as was Pharaoh
for the Egyptians."--Flinders.]</p>
<p class="note">[** He left Captain Edwards at Huaheine.]</p>
<p>"On our return to the ship I saw a multitude of men on the low
land of Matavai, all armed, prepared to attack the Matavians, whom
they had already driven from the spot and burnt their houses. In
the afternoon the Oparre people drove the others to the mountains,
killed one man, and returned victorious. I have been solicited to
join Otoo's army, but I only promised to interfere if the Matavians
attempt to go near Oparre, in which case I would land a party of
men and drive them back, which promise gave great pleasure to our
Oparre friends. I also sent the surgeon of the 'Matilda' in company
with a chief to Poeno and Tabyroo, to order them to return the
Captain's (Weatherhead) effects, if they wished to be on good terms
with me, and he brought me back word that everything would be
returned. The surgeon informs me that he was conducted through an
immense number of men armed with spears, clubs, and slings, who
appeared extremely anxious to know the terms of the message, and if
I intended to act against them. They behaved with much decorum, and
showed some attention to the chief who went with the party.
Hostilities ceased during the parley...these men when heaped
together in such numbers, armed with spears 12 or 14 feet long,
have a tremendous appearance though they do very little mischief to
each other. They seldom come to a serious charge, but content
themselves with the execution they are able to effect with slinging
stones, by which men are sometimes killed.</p>
<p>"It is of the utmost concern to me to land here, yet I dare not
send any party on shore. I have not yet seen any chief of
consequence but Oreepyah, and his brother, and Tynah still remains
at Morea.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "Where he had a newly acquired
possession."--Vancouver.]</p>
<p>"When the 'Matilda,' Captain Weatherhead, passed Matavai, the
natives swam off to him with notes that some of the 'Discovery'
people had given them to recommend them as Tayos.<sup>*</sup> These
were dated January 12th, 1792, which I suspect was the time they
sailed.</p>
<p class="note">[* Tayo or friend.]</p>
<p>"I find that the villains Christian landed were permitted to
have sails and various implements; they built a vessel 25 or 30
feet long, with two masts, and the natives tell me that Captain
Edwards took this vessel with him, and this gave me much pleasure,
as I think he may derive a great advantage from her when going
between New Holland and New Guinea. Our friends here have benefited
little from their intercourse with Europeans. Our countrymen have
taught them such vile expressions as are in the mouth of every
Otaheitan, and I declare that I would rather forfeit anything than
to have been in the list of ships that have touched here since
April, 1789.</p>
<p>"Thursday, April 12th. Fair wind and regular trade wind in the
bay. A few canoes trading with sufficient supplies.</p>
<p>"This morning word was brought me that the Matavians were drove
to the mountains and they would leave when Tynah came from Morea.
They assured me he was sent for. Oreepyah appears desirous for me
to remain on the boat till Tynah comes, and it appears to me his
presence here is necessary.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon an Indian was caught thieving on board the
'Assistant'. He was confined until Oreepyah returned, when I
released him. At eight in the evening the same person was again
found swimming about the cable. The night was dark, therefore it
was with difficulty he was taken. I put him in irons. Several
inferior chiefs were on board to-day; they were remarkably glad to
see me and thanked their God for protecting me from the hands of
Christian; their manner of expressing themselves was literally to
that effect.</p>
<p>"Friday, April 13th. Fine weather, wind at E.N.E., and much
swell in the Bay. Not many canoes about.</p>
<p>"In the morning I ordered the small bower anchor to be shifted
nearer the shore in 12 fms. Point Venus N. 22&deg; E. distant
two-thirds of a mile. Point of reef N. 13&deg; W., and West Head of
Tarrah S. 29&deg; W. Throughout the day I have some of the natives
welcoming me here, and it is a great fatigue to me to show them
proper attention and to assort the presents I give them.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon Iddeah and her friends begged me to send my
boat for Tynah, and said if I did not send for him he would not
come. I saw this was a plan of her own, and insisted on her sending
for him herself if she meant to be on a friendly footing with me.
The way I did it gave her some alarm, and she ordered a boat to be
ready and sailed, promising me to be back in two days, if the
weather would permit, and I told Oreepyah I should wait no longer
for Tynah's arrival from Morea, and that in the morning I should go
on shore to prepare a place for my plants in which it was to his
interest to assist me, for I would have no more fighting. This
brought him about, and he engaged to assist me to-morrow as soon as
I had determined on the spot where I intended to have my post.</p>
<p>"Saturday, April 14th, 1792. At day dawn I sent Mr. Norris,
Surgeon of the 'Matilda,' with a message from me to Poena and
Tabyroo to give up Mr. Weatherhead's money and some other articles
in their possession, particularly the musquets. After a troublesome
walk of six miles he found Poena and Tabyroo at Wapyhanoo, a
district next to Matavai. They received him in a friendly manner
and promised that the money should be returned as soon as it could
be got from Teturoah (a small island N. of Point Venus) where they
had sent it for security. They refused to give up the musquets
unless by mutual consent all those that were on the island were
given to me. In that case they had no objection to comply, but in
their present situation they could not think of it, as it was
necessary for them to retain some means to preserve their property.
They would do anything to serve me, they said, and hoped I would
not be angry with them. 'It was the mob who had taken away the
people's clothes and hauled the boats on shore.' If I came after
them they said that 'all that could be done was to fly farther
away'. They called Matavai my country, and said that the people of
Oparre had destroyed all their houses and barked their trees,
killing what I had left among them, and done the country
irreparable injury. I am sorry to say I found it too much the
case.</p>
<p>"According to my promise I landed with Oreepyah and Tootaha, and
fixed on a rising ground for my post about a quarter of a mile from
Point Venus along the beach. Matavai River runs close to the back
of it, which makes the situation advantageous for the plants. With
Oreepyah's assistance I got the lines marked out, and by night got
a fence and a shade about 30 yards long, and six wide, two-thirds
completed, to receive the plants. I also got everything ready for
erecting the houses to-morrow as they are preferable to erecting my
own tents. A party of twenty-five men under the command of
Lieutenants Guthrie and Pearce were also got ready, twenty being
marines.</p>
<p>"Sunday, April 15th. Thermometer 82&deg;. Washed ship. Mustered the
people. Performed Divine Service. Put the people on short allowance
of liquor. This enables me to assist Weatherhead's people, and it
acts against necessity from any delay that I may meet with in my
sailing to Timor.</p>
<p>"Monday, April 16th. Moderate and cloudy weather which towards
midday became squally, and at night smart rain.</p>
<p>"In the morning I sent the 2nd Lieutenant of the ship, Mr.
Guthrie, Lieutenant Pearce of the Marines, with his party, and
those of the 'Assistant' to guard our 'breadfruit walk'. I also
ordered the surgeon of the 'Matilda' to be sent, who, with the two
botanists, made twenty-seven men capable of using arms. Not many
canoes about the ship. The favourable wind yesterday brought me my
friend Tynah. He came on board about two o'clock in a covered canoe
with his two wives Iddeah and Whyerreddee. His father, old Otow,
came in another canoe.<sup>*</sup> There appeared a degree of
natural affection between Tynah and his father that gave me much
pleasure. 'We all thank God,' he said to me, 'that you are safe. We
were told that you were put into a little boat and sent adrift
without anything to eat or drink, and that you must perish. You
have a fine ship now. Have you good men? Is there a bad man among
them? Have you seen King George? What did he say to you?' and many
other questions he asked, respecting every person he knew.</p>
<p class="note">[* Otow, Tynah's father, Bligh tells us, was called
Whappai in 1769. His name is usually spelt Tu or Teu, which was the
dynastic title of the reigning head of the chiefs of Tevaitai or
Tevvyty.]</p>
<p>"I asked him how he came to be so friendly to Christian, for
that proved to me that he was not sincere in what he said. He
replied: 'I really thought you were living, and had gone to England
until Christian came back the second time. I was therefore from
home, but all my friends, who heard you were lost from the men who
came on shore, from that time did not profess any friendship to
him, and Christian knew it so well that he only remained a few
hours and went away in such a hurry that he left a second anchor
behind. One of the anchors we got I gave to the "Pandora," Captain
Edwards.' Thus Tynah freed himself from suspicion, and, with his
usual good-nature and cheerfulness, regained my esteem.</p>
<p>"Peona and the Matavai people seem to be objects of great
dislike to Tynah and his father, and they requested me to go to war
against them and destroy those people who, as well as the
inhabitants of Paparra and Oaitepeha,<sup>*</sup> had many
musquets. They had the good sense not to be seriously offended at
my refusal, when I told them it would interfere with the business I
was sent on. I, however, still threatened the adverse party unless
they brought in the arms and the money.</p>
<p class="note">[* Papara and Oaitepeha, provinces of Tahiti.]</p>
<p>"Tynah brought me a large hog, some cloth, breadfruit,
plantains, and cocoanuts. His wife also put a few pieces of cloth
about me, but little of the ancient customs of the Otaheitans
remain--all that was laid aside. It is difficult to get them to
speak their own language without mixing a jargon of English with
it, and they are so altered that I believe in future no Europeans
will ever know what their ancient customs of receiving strangers
were.</p>
<p>"It surprised me to find Tynah had another wife while Iddeah was
living. She is a younger sister of Iddeah and of her stature, but
has a more handsome countenance. She was the wife of Whaeahtuah, a
Chief of Tiarraboo, who is dead. They all slept on board, and the
women were on the best of terms.</p>
<p>"Tynah brought with him Captain Cook's picture,<sup>*</sup> and
on the back of it, underneath my memorandum, is as follows:--</p>
<p>"'His Britannic Majesty's ship "Pandora" sailed from Matavai
Bay, Otahaite, May 9th, 1791.</p>
<p>"'His Britannic Majesty's ship "Discovery" and armed tender
"Chatham" sailed from Matavai, Bay, January 24th, 1792.'</p>
<p class="note">[* During the visit of the "Resolution" to Tahiti
in 1777, Tynah, or Otoo, as he was then called, by the desire of
Captain Cook, sat to Mr. Webber, who required a sketch of his
features for the purpose of a full-length picture to be completed
on the return of the ship to England. When the sketch was finished
and Otoo was informed that no more sittings would be necessary, he
anxiously inquired the meaning and purpose of the painting. He was
informed that it would be kept by Captain Cook as a memorial of his
person, his friendship, and the many favours received from him.
Pleased with the idea he instantly replied that for the same
reasons he would like a portrait of Captain Cook. Captain Clerke
and Mr. Webber also pressed Captain Cook to comply with his
request. The portrait when finished was framed, and with a box,
lock, and key was delivered to Otoo. He promised faithfully to
preserve it. Lieutenant Watts in July, 1788, visited Tahiti, and
from his voyage the above account of Cook's picture has been taken.
On going on shore to meet Otoo, Watts was surprised to see a man
carrying about the portrait of Cook, and he was told that Otoo took
it with him wherever he went. Notwithstanding the length of time
that had elapsed since the picture had been drawn, it had received
no injury. Bligh saw it when he came in the same year, and was told
that Cook had desired Otoo whenever any English ship came to show
this picture, and that it would be acknowledged as a token of
friendship. Bligh inscribed it thus: "Lieutenant Bligh of His
Britannic Majesty's ship 'Bounty' anchored in Matavai Bay, October
25th, 1788, but owing to bad weather was obliged to sail to Oparre,
December 25th, where he remained until March 30th, 1789. Was then
ready for sea with 1015 breadfruit plants besides many other
fruits, and only waiting an opportunity to get to sea, at which
time the picture was given up. Sailed April 14th, 1789."<br>
<br>
Mortimer, in the same year, records in his story of the "Mercury's"
voyage, "He (Poenow) dispatched two servants for the picture, and
it was brought to us wrapped in cloth, and carried back in the same
manner". Captain Edwards, as recorded by Bligh, inscribed his
ship's name upon the back of the picture in 1791, and was followed
by Captain Vancouver in 1792, who writes in his journal: "Poeno,
Chief of Matavai, brought with him a portrait of Captain Cook drawn
by Mr. Webber in 1777. The picture is always deposited at his house
and is become the public register."]</p>
<p>"I should have been happy to have received a letter from Captain
Edwards to say how he had proceeded: it would have been delivered
to me as safe as the picture, and I might have assisted in
finishing the object of his voyage.</p>
<p>"The presents I made to Tynah and his friends gave them much
pleasure, particularly a suit of crimson cloth with gold lace about
the cape and sleeves, and a printed calico gown given to the women;
to these I added iron and trinkets. I forgot to mention that I had
saluted Tynah on his arrival with ten guns.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, April 17th. All the morning light variable winds
easterly. Employed caulking and drying sails and salting pork.</p>
<p>"This was the first day that I began to collect my plants; we
had thirty-two in the pots at sunset. I had a visit to-day from the
young king. He was brought to the post on a man's shoulders in the
usual way, but would not come off to the ship. After receiving
presents he returned to Oparre. When they had eaten a great deal
Tynah and his wives and Oreepyah and Tootaha went to Oparre in the
cutter. Nothing pleases them more than this mark of attention, and
my saluting Tynah on his arrival delights him. He says it will show
his enemies that we are good friends. He has none but friends about
him, for the Matavai people are fled; their houses destroyed, and
the whole plain desolate which I have seen replete with
cheerfulness and wealth.</p>

<p>"By the Matavai people being away I have lost an intercourse
with full 2000 people, so that I have not half the bustle I had in
my last voyage, which is fortunate, my nerves and headache being at
times scarce bearable.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, April 18th. Westerly winds--at night calms and smart
rain favourable to my plants. About thirty canoes around the ship
to-day trading, but I have only seen three goats which I bought for
my sea store. Otoo sent me a handsome present of hogs and fruit,
and gave others to the officers at the post. This day we completed
eighty-three pots with plants. I have got the duty now going on
with regularity; coming among Indians it is always some time before
this can be effected. Mr. Smith and Mr. Wiles, the gardeners, have
every assistance, some of the men were employed by me in my last
voyage which is of considerable advantage to them.</p>
<p>"A fine child about twelve months old was brought me to-day--the
daughter of George Stewart, midshipman of the 'Bounty'; it was a
very pretty creature, but had been so exposed to the sun as to be
little fairer than an Otaheitan.</p>
<p>"From the most authentic account I can get I find the Otaheitans
have got musquets from different ships.</p>

</pre>
<p>"Thursday, April 19th, 1792. Air cool and pleasant, they. 76 to
77 degrees. This day we filled 140 pots with plants, the weather
being favourable. In the evening Tynah and his wives returned from
Oparre; they brought a quantity of dressed breadfruit to me as a
present. As they remained on board I was obliged to give up the
cabin to them, where three men-servants, the King, and his wives,
after eating a heavy supper, slept upon the floor.</p>
<p>"It surprised me to find that both Iddeah and Tynah were now
called 'Pomarre,'<sup>*</sup> and on inquiring the cause of it I
find it is owing to their having lost their eldest daughter
Terranaoroa of an illness of that name which they describe to me by
coughing. Pomarre is compounded from 'Po,' night, and 'Marre 'or
'Morre,' the name of the disease.<sup>**</sup> Whenever a child
dies, the parents take the name of the disease; if a dozen children
die of different diseases the parents have as many different names,
or give them to their relations, and may be called either by the
new name or their own. It is a custom common to all ranks of people
here.</p>
<p class="note">[* Bligh continues to call him by the name of
Tynah.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Ellis, in <i>Polynesian Researches</i>, gives a
different reason for the change of name. He writes: "He (Tynah) was
travelling in a mountainous part of Tahiti where it was necessary
to spend the night...He took cold and was affected with a cough:
this led some of his companions to designate the preceding night by
the appellation pomare--night of cough from 'Po' night, and 'Mare'
cough. The chief was pleased with the sound of the words, adopted
them as his name, and was ever afterwards called Pomare." As Bligh
was told of the change of name by Tynah himself, his account seems
more likely to be the true one. Tynah was known as Pomare I, and
his son Otu as Pomare II.]</p>
<p>"Among a number of plants which I brought here from England, the
Cape of Good Hope, and New Holland, consisting of pines, guavas,
pomegranates, quinces, figs, vines, firs, metrocedera, and aloes,
the natives only desire the last three--the firs and metrocedera,
because I assured them they would grow into very large trees and
fit for building ships, and the aloes on account of its fine
flower. No value is set on our garden productions. It is really to
no purpose to bring them anything that requires care. I saw
yesterday a fine shaddock very nearly destroyed by fire, and the
fruit of it they told me 'was good for nothing'.</p>
<p>"Friday, April 20th. Calms with light airs. Easterly breezes.
Ther. 78 to 81. Everything is now well at our post, and the natives
behave in a very orderly manner. I have my shed for the plants
completed, and the botanists accustomed to the work.</p>
<p>"To-day I had another visit from the young king Otoo. I could do
nothing to induce him to come on board or get off his man's
shoulders, where he rides as easy as any of us would do upon a
horse. About twenty or thirty young men attend him, and he shifts
from one to the other without the least inconvenience as they
become tired. I cannot get Tynah or anyone to tell me the exact
time when he will be permitted to walk, other than by saying, 'when
he is a man'. At home he runs about like other boys. About the same
time Tynah will perform the ceremony of Oamo to all his children,
and he will then become free to feed himself. I have described this
ceremony in my last voyage.</p>
<p>"Whatever men are taken in wars are killed, and share the same
fate as those who fall in battle; their eyes arc taken out, one is
presented to their God Oro, the other to the Erree-ra-high; then
the body is buried.</p>
<p>"The men belonging to the 'Matilda' who have lived at Oparre
brought the word that they at times have seen a white man who will
not speak English to them, but had spoken at one time to a boy of
theirs, and they suspect he might be one of the 'Bounty' people;
they asserted also that he had attempted to disfigure himself by
tying a string around his head and across his nose to flatten it.
They told me the story clear and distinct. The Oparre people deny
the fact, and I was beginning to suspect their fidelity when Iddeah
said 'perhaps they mean Taow'. The story was then unravelled and
there was no truth in it, for the person was obviously an
Otaheitan, but it was one of those lapses of nature for which it is
not possible to account--his skin and hair being white, and it is
the same person of whom I have spoken in my last voyage.</p>
<p>"Saturday, April 21st. Strong sea breezes in the day, and much
swell on the Dolphin Bank.<sup>*</sup> Number of plants potted 196,
I mean so many pots were filled each with two plants in them. Very
few canoes off to us. Tynah is as usual on board with me. No
strangers have yet been to see us, and we are quiet both here and
at the post.</p>
<p class="note">[* The Dolphin Bank was so called because Wallis's
ship the "Dolphin" struck it as she entered the bay.]</p>
<p>"Sunday, April 22nd. Sea breezes at E.S.E., in the night. Calm.
In the morning completed 166 pots with plants. Very few natives
about us. Cleaned ship. Performed Divine Service. To-clay some
shaddocks<sup>**</sup> were sent to me; they were very large and of
a fine sort, but not sufficiently ripe. They were brought about
four miles out of the country near Peahroah, where Mr. Nelson in
1789 had planted three trees, that are now loaded with fruit: the
natives do not value them. Mr. Portlock picked up a lump of lava
to-day near the post, which had every mark of having been thrown up
from a volcano. I made inquiries among the chiefs about it, one
assured me that it came out of one of their ovens where by the heat
of the fire the stones frequently are changed...but Sir William
Hamilton says the hottest furnace would not be able to bring the
materials of lava into any degree of fusion...I found it would
attract the magnetic needle.</p>
<p class="note">[* Portlock writes: "Messrs. Tobin, Harwood,
Franklin, and Norris in an excursion up the valley of Matavai saw a
number of shaddocks and as they thought some orange trees. I think
they are mistaken. I do not think there are any in the island
except the young ones we have landed." Wallis, however, planted
limes, lemons, and oranges in Tahiti, but he does not tell us if
they were seeds or plants.]</p>
<p>"Monday, April 23rd. Employed trading with the natives.</p>
<p>"I took a walk to-day over the greatest part of our
neighbourhood. I found it altered very much for the worse; this is
occasioned by the late war. Few houses remained, and all the places
that once swarmed with inhabitants now had scarce an individual to
account for the calamity.</p>
<p>"At this time peace is said to be established, but the Matavai
chiefs do not wish to send to me the money or arms, and therefore
keep away in the mountains: although they send promises that they
will return the money.</p>
<p>"Otoo again paid us a visit at the post where a Heiva was
performed by one woman and four men in their common interlude
style. In the cool of the evening the Marines exercised, and the
natives were exceedingly delighted, particularly with the sergeant
who played so many tricks with his musquet that they said he was
mad.</p>
<p>"Tynah with his wives, father, and brother dine with me every
day: a canoe with a party came over from Morea to see the
ship--they were some friends of Whyerredee, for whom Tynah had
recourse to my lockers to satisfy with presents. Tynah is a perfect
fool to this woman; she rules him as she pleases, while Iddeah
quietly submits, and is contented with a moderate share of
influence. Since I sailed in the 'Bounty,' Tynah has had another
child, a boy called Oroho, by Iddeah, by Whyerredee he has
none.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Note in log: "Tynah's children now are Otoo,
Erree-ra-high; Teritapanovai, his brother, and Tahamydooa, his
sister, and Oroho, another brother".]</p>
<p>"Huheine Moyere, the wife of Oreepyah, arrived today from the
district of Itteah where she had been at the burial of her father's
brother. To my surprise she would touch no victuals but what was
put to her mouth by the hands of another person. I have accounted
for this in my last voyage in one case, and I now find from Tynah
that the loss of relations is another cause of their not feeding
themselves; it is a degree of mourning that lasts three months.</p>
<p>"It is extraordinary to see how fond these people are of liquor.
I have done all in my power to prevent it. With me they are
contented with their wine, but when they can get spirits about the
ship they are sure to get drunk. We completed 80 pots to-day with
plants.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, April 24th. Ther. 81 to 83&frac12; degrees.</p>
<p>"Got the spare anchor out of the main hold and put the
'Guardian's'<sup>*</sup> anchor down in its place. The
Erree-ra-high Otoo, changed his residence to-day from Oparre to
this place. This is a pleasant circumstance, and I have now all the
chief people about us. Otow lives on Point Venus, Tynah and Otoo
five hundred yards within the point, and Oreepyah on the beach
towards Tarrah. In this manner they prevent worthless fellows
lurking about the post. The quantity of old clothes left among
these people is considerable; they wear such rags as truly disgust
us. It is rare to see a person dressed in a neat piece of cloth
which formerly they had in abundance and wore with much elegance.
Their general habiliments are now a dirty shirt and an old coat and
waistcoat; they are no longer clean Otaheitans, but in appearance a
set of ragamuffins with whom it is necessary to observe great
caution.</p>
<p class="note">[* 2 The "Guardian" struck an iceberg off the Cape
of Good Hope on December 23rd, 1789, on her way to Sydney. The ship
was past recovery when she was brought into port. Captain Parker of
the "Gorgon" afterwards took away her stores but left her anchors,
"which may be of use to the King's ships coming this way," and
Captain Bligh evidently took one on board at the Cape to supply the
place of one that he lost at Porto Praya.]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, April 25th. Fair weather during the morning, the
latter part cloudy with rain in the mountains, and a sprinkling
below.</p>
<p>"Our friends have some weighty deliberations on their hands
which I cannot account for. The cause of Otoo having removed to
Matavai is some business respecting the late war; some concessions
have been made by the Matavai party. The temple of Oro, their God,
which is always kept near the residence of the Erree-ra-high, was
brought up in a canoe with him. It is to remain until to-morrow,
when after a meeting of the parties Otoo returns with it to Oparre.
All the other chiefs remain here. To-morrow morning I am to have a
sight of it, and hear the prayers performed by Tootaha the priest.
This man is a great orator among them, and is highly respected for
his abilities as well as being a chief of consequence. He has
always been the prime minister of Tynah, and is the oracle and
historian of this country, and possesses a great fund of humour. He
is called Hammene-manne, but in my last voyage was called by the
name of Tootaha.<sup>*</sup> He speaks English well, and, if he
could write, is capable of forming a vocabulary of near 1000
English words. I have mentioned the death of Teppahoo, the chief of
Tettaha. His mother was Terrennoo, the sister of Oberreeroah, and I
find he is succeeded by Tynah's youngest brother, his nephew by
marriage. We filled 71 pots to-day, and the whole are doing
well.</p>
<p class="note">[* Called by Bligh sometimes by one name and
sometimes by the other and, by Wilson, Manne-manne. He was formerly
a principal chief of Raiatea, the principal island of the leeward
section of the Society Islands.]</p>
<p>"Thursday, April 26th. At daylight this morning I walked with
Tynah and Tootaha to see the great temple. I found it on a double
canoe about a mile from Point Venus in the harbour of Taipippee
near the small island of Modoow. It was hauled up on the beach--on
the prow of the canoe was a baked hog, the head of a dog, a fowl,
and a piece of sugar cane. After being seated in the canoe, Tootaha
began a prayer in favour of King George and of myself, and Mr.
Portlock, the purport of which was that we might never want or be
overcome by our enemies. His chanting was accompanied by two drums:
one was beat by a native, the other by one of my people who came
with me, so that it cannot be supposed that there was much harmony
in it. There was an interval in prayer when the priest took off all
his clothes and lifted a bundle like an Egyptian mummy covered with
red cloth from out of its vault into a kind of trough on top of it.
It contained, he said, the Etuah, the Marro Oorah, and other sacred
things. I requested to have it opened, but he assured me that I
should see it to-morrow at Oparre at a ceremony to which I was
going--this senseless lump and the canoe have been spoken of with
much wonder and respect...they call the temple the Ephare Tuah or
the House of God. It is about 6 feet 4 inches long and 5&frac12; feet
high.</p>
<p>"Otoo slept in a small shed near the Morai. This place is sacred
to the chief, and no person ventures near it. He always sleeps here
when it is too late to go to Oparre. He had most of the things we
had given him and a St. George's Ensign which had been left here by
Captain Cook...this Ensign is always carried with the Morai, and
was displayed in company with a small red flag in sailing past the
ships on the way to Oparre.</p>
<p>"The harbour of Taipippee is but small. A shark seven feet long
was caught alongside and many porpoises are in the bay. The native
name for a high-forked mountain which I have called Otoo's Horns is
Oroena.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The loftiest mountain in the northern peninsula,
Orohena, according to the French, is 7339 feet high.]</p>
<p>" Peace is established. Poena and Pynah have had a meeting, and
it is agreed that Poena shall live again at Matavai. They have
promised to return Captain Weatherhead's money. I am in doubt about
their sincerity, but I dare not involve myself in trouble with
these people although I will do my utmost to regain it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. AMONG THE
TAHITIANS.</h2>
<p>As well as visiting Pare and other places, Captain Bligh
investigated the customs and religious ceremonies of the Tahitians,
descriptions of which are given below in his log. He was naturally
interested in the activities of the mutineers of the "Bounty" and
in the part that they had taken in the civil feuds of the natives.
His knowledge of the Tahitian language enabled him to ask questions
and to record details which would have been beyond the reach of
anyone less well equipped.</p>
<p>The log proceeds:--</p>
<p>"Friday, April 27th, 1792. On my inquiring the cause of the
Marro Oorah being moved from Attahooroo,<sup>*</sup> where it was
kept in Captain Cook's time, they told me that after Christian had
left his villains at Otaheite, Otoo made war against the Attahooroo
people, and by aid of the 'Bounty's' men overcame them. The Marro
Oorah, the Etuah, and Tebbootaboo were then seized and brought to
Oparre.</p>
<p class="note">[* Atehuru, formerly a province of Tahiti,
comprised the area known to-day as Punaaui and Paea and bordered
Papara.]</p>
<p>"Saturday, April 28th. Fine weather with land and sea breezes.
At sunrise I set out in my boat with Tynah for Oparre where Tootaha
was waiting our arrival at the Morai.</p>
<p>"The Morai or temple where the ceremony was held was an oblong
pile of stones about ten yards long and fourteen feet high--on the
top of which were about fourteen rude ornaments, some resembling a
man and some a bird. The whole range of them was called the
Tebbootaboo-ataiah.<sup>*</sup> I interpret this as meaning Great
Temple or the principal place of worship.</p>
<p class="note">[* Captain Bligh says this word is given to the
Morai or Temple wherever the Etuah is brought.]</p>
<p>"Tootaha was at prayers and the Etuah laying before him wrapt in
red cloth. To the right of it lay the dead body of a man wrapt in
the plaited branch of a cocoanut tree, and tied to a pole by which
means the body was carried about. To the right of the priest were
two drums, and at a distance of twenty yards off was the Evatah or
altar, on which there were lying twenty-nine dead hogs and a
turtle. On nine stout posts was erected the Ephare Tuah. Two
priests assisted Tootaha at the ceremony as well as two inferior
people of that order. After the first prayer upon our arrival the
bundle called the Etuah was untied and exposed. The Marro Oorah or
feather belt was taken out of another bundle and spread out, so I
could see every sacred thing they had.</p>
<p>The Marro Oorah<sup>*</sup> or feather belt is put on the
Erree-ra-high when the sacrifice is made and the eye presented. It
was twelve feet long. One half was made with yellow feathers,
traced with red feathers, the other half was simply of red English
bunting--it was not neatly made or in any way elegant.</p>
<p class="note">[* Vancouver calls it the "Girdle of Royalty".
There can be but one Arii Maro Eoora which means chief of the
red-feathered Maro, and under this title Otoo's authority is
acknowledged in Otaheite and elsewhere.]</p>
<p>"The red bundle or Etuah, which they call Oro, was nothing more
than a number of yellow and red feathers, and four rolls eighteen
inches long plaited over cocoanut fibres, and to these they give
the name of some inferior Deities. I had scarce been seated a
quarter of an hour when the sun having risen above the trees, I was
overcome by the atmosphere, and forced to quit the place, and take
a seat out of the direction of the wind, where our friend Tynah had
placed himself under a spreading tree.</p>
<p>"Tootaha now began a prayer, it was very long and had many
repetitions, so that the retentiveness of this man's memory is not
so extraordinary. Taking up his prayer in all its various changes
and repetitions, the whole amounted to this: 'We have sacrificed a
man. We have presented one of his eyes to thee as a token of thy
power and one to our King, because it is by thy will he reigneth
over us. We display our feathers! We present our hogs to thee! We
do this O Oro,<sup>*</sup> because we know thou delightest in it!
Our wish is to do as thou desirest: prosper therefore our
undertakings. Let us conquer our enemies and live in plenty.' After
this one of the hogs was burnt and cut up, and the remains brought
to the Morai. This appeared to me to be particularly the offering
of my friend Tynah. Another prayer was pronounced in favour of King
George, myself, and the people who were with me in the ships. Drums
were beat at intervals, and the hog laid on the Evatah or altar and
the body buried by the side of the Morai.</p>
<p class="note">[* Writing of their traditions, Cook says: "Their
remotest account extends to Tatooma and Tapuppa, who are male and
female rocks, and support our globe...These begat Totorro...then
Otaia and Oro were produced, who first begat land and then a race
of Gods."--<i>Cook's Last Voyage</i>, vol. ii., p. 107. Ellis
writes: "Taaroa was the father of the Gods, and Oro was his first
son. Oro was their principal war God who is described by some as
both God and man."--<i>Polynesian Researches</i>.]</p>
<p>"The Marro was tied up in one bundle, the Etuah in another, and
carefully covered over with a piece of red English cloth, and the
ceremony ended. There were not many people present, and, among
those that were, I saw no grave or serious attention. Otoo was
carried about on a man's shoulders, talking to us and playing his
tricks, during the whole time of the devotion. The priest himself,
the moment he had done prayers, began to joke in an obscene
manner.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "As a priest," Ellis says, "Hamanemane (or
Tootaha) practised every species of extortion and cruelty." In 1798
he formed a league with Otoo to deprive Tynah of his authority. He
was murdered on his way to Pare by one of Idia's men at Tynah's
instigation on December 3rd, 1798.]</p>
<p>"In war time the sacrifices are common. On being defeated a man
is sacrificed to their God, and on a victory it is the most sacred
way of returning thanks.</p>
<p>"Tynah requested I would not return immediately to the ship, as
he had ordered a turtle to be killed for us; it was baked as they
do their hogs. While it was dressing we went to the Morai, called
Woworoa, on the point of the harbour. The turtle being ready, our
repast was taken on the ground, which was covered with fresh
leaves.</p>
<p>"When we were all seated Tynah desired the priest to perform a
ceremony as a token of friendship to us...the priest then collected
a number of leaves, and standing up called upon us each by name as
Tynah directed; each name he numbered with a leaf...these were
given to Otoo who was still sitting on his man's shoulders, and he
held them till all the friends were called over, among whom were
ourselves and the ship. Mr. Bond, Mr. Harwood the surgeon, and
myself, assisted in part of the ceremony, by help of Tynah who told
us alternatively what we had to say. We took our repast heartily,
and with the most kind welcome ever men had. They spoke of
Christian. They had showed me in one of their houses a large drum
that he had given to them which he had brought from
Tobooi;<sup>*</sup> they now said that they were happy that Captain
Edwards had carried so many of Christian's men away. Coleman the
armourer they said had not concurred in the mutiny: he had declared
so to myself when I was drove away from the ship. They were glad to
hear I had forgiven him. Churchill and Thompson lived at Tiarraboo,
where, being jealous of each other, Churchill induced the chiefs to
endeavour to steal Thompson's musket and pistol. The friends of
Thompson informed him of it; he therefore shot Churchill through
the body at first sight. This produced an utter aversion in the
chiefs to Thompson, and they laid hold of him in return and beat
his brains out.</p>
<p class="note">[* Tubuai.]</p>
<p>"I was particular to know how it was that the Marro which we had
known to be kept at Attahooroo together with the God Oro, the
Etuah, and Temple Tebbootabooataiah, should be now at Oparre. The
general answer was that they had been at war with the Attahooroo
people, and had seized their God and brought him to Oparre. This I
find is really the case, and in the war the 'Bounty's' people
assisted them with their musketry.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Bligh writes: "Before the present Otow's
(Tynah's father) time Attahooroo was the principal residence of the
Erree-ra-high. In my last voyage I have given an account which I
find perfect as far back as Otow's father, and from this
information Tootaha, who was a great chief and Otow's uncle, was
the cause of the Marro and Tebbootaboo-ataiah remaining at
Attahooroo, but as he had been a long time dead and these people
had injured them, they went to war and conquered the whole
district."]</p>
<p>"The moon was now nine days old. I asked the name of the month
and Tootaha told me as he did in 1788 that it was
Ahoonoonu--April.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Aununu--April and part of May.--Ellis,
<i>Polynesian Researches</i>.]</p>
<p>"Monday, April 30th. Our post is now little incommoded by the
natives. In the evenings they collect to see the marines go through
their manoeuvres, but retire at sundown and all is quiet. The
plants are doing well; I have to this day 1194 pots filled and 4
tubs. There are 1090 breadfruit, 25 vees (a sort of apple), 25
rattahs (a kind of chestnut), 25 ayeyahs (Jambo of the East), 12
orayahs (fine plantains), 9 peeahs (sago root), 6 mattees and 2
ettows (the two last both produce a fine red dye).</p>
<p>"I have forgotten to give you a description of the Great Evatah
where the hogs were lying. This famous altar is formed by three
rows of stout posts eight feet high, thirty-six in number, so that
the whole space of ground taken up is forty feet by ten feet. From
the top of one post to the other, poles are secured to form a
platform which is covered with small branches and leaves to receive
the offerings. The Evatah was prettily ornamented all round with a
curtain of cocoanut leaves.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, May 1st. Fine weather. Poeno has come in and is now
friendly with Oparre people. As usual I have forbid him to see me
until he returns the lost property stolen from Weatherbead; they
say it is at Teturoah,<sup>*</sup> and will be brought in...this
will be more than I expect, for to-day Mr. Bond bought two dollars
with a few trifles he had, and it is probable that now no one
person possesses the money.</p>
<p class="note">[* Some low flat coral islets within a reef 25
miles N.W. of Tahiti, now called Tetiaroa. According to Erskine,
"in former times it was the watering place of the Areois for
recovery of their diseases".]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, May 2nd. Light winds and calms. The people began to
collect early at Matavai, mostly women and children. A woman with a
child in her arms eighteen months old, calling herself wife of
McIntosh, late of the 'Bounty,' and gone home in the 'Pandora,'
came to see me to-day. This woman with several others had been with
Christian to Tobooi: she related that they had stayed there two
months with the 'Bounty'. Christian's intentions were to settle in
that island, and he had begun to build houses and a battery there
to defend himself--with the ship's guns. Two principal chiefs on
the island on seeing these proceedings objected to his staying
longer. Altercations ensued and war was declared. Many of the
islanders lost their lives. Christian did not find it safe to
remain among them and embarked with all his party and arrived two
days later at Otaheite...the principal chiefs here treated
Christian with so much coolness that he determined to part with
those of his men who were discontented, and immediately to set
sail: it took place in the course of sixteen hours. The 'Bounty'
then left Matavai with some natives on board,<sup>*</sup> never to
return again. The only knowledge of his future proceedings was that
he openly declared his intentions to look for some land where he
could make a settlement and then to haul the ship on shore and
break her up. The woman calls herself Mary and her child Elizabeth,
and says all wives of the men had English names. She constantly
remarked that McIntosh, Coleman, Hillbrant, Newman, Byrne, and
Ellison scarce ever spoke of me without crying. Stewart and Heywood
were perfectly satisfied with their situation, and so were the rest
of them. "They deserved to be killed," she said, but she "hoped
those who cried for me would not be hurt." She agreed with
Tabyroo's account that Coleman had to swim from the ship by stealth
when the 'Bounty' left, as he was detained, being a blacksmith and
a useful man. So perfectly had this woman learned the whole story
that she told me names of all the men who came into my cabin at the
time of the mutiny, and assisted to tie my hands, and said that no
person beside myself was tied. The ship lay in an open road at
Tobooi and rode out some gales of wind.</p>
<p class="note">[* Note in log: Nine Tubuaian men, one Otaheitan

<p>"Thursday, May 3rd. Land and sea breezes. Ther. 81&deg; to 82&deg;.
Tynah, Otow, Oreepyah, and their wives are always with me at
dinner. We continue on the best footing with the natives, and our
plants thrive so fast as to give me satisfaction.</p>
<p>"It is not clear to me that good fellowship is yet established
among the Matavai people, although they are erecting sheds and
Poeno is here and on good terms with our Oparre friends. No chiefs
of consequence have yet come to see us except the Otoo family. Some
of our gentlemen made an excursion to-day which terminated with
their being outwitted by an Indian, and resulted in the loss of
their jackets and a brace of pistols. Weary of wearing their own
jackets, the gentlemen pulled them off with their arms in the
pockets and gave them to a worthless fellow to carry. He led them
to a blind and intricate path, and left them to find their way
home, which they did not accomplish until eight o'clock. I have
taken the greatest pains to explain to my officers and people how
little they can rely on the fidelity of the Indians.</p>
<p>"Friday, May 4th. Light winds and calms. In the morning our old
friend the Queen Dowager Oberreeroah arrived from Morea, and her
daughter, Wowwo.<sup>*</sup> Nothing could exceed their joy and
kind congratulations to myself in the midst of which they disavowed
friendly intercourse with Christian. It is remarkable the pains the
chiefs have taken to prevent stigma lying on them on that account.
Wowwo is the woman who in my last voyage was cured of a skin
disease by Mr. Ledward. She inquired particularly after him.
Oberreeroah has grown more corpulent; she finds difficulty in
walking. I gave them great pleasure by hoisting her into the ship
in a chair. Wowwo's husband, the Erree-ra-high of Morea, is dead.
The present chief is Mahow, nephew of Oberreeroah, a pleasant
creature; he informs me that there are only six horned cattle at
Morea.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Note in log: "The family of Oberreeroah and Otow

<p class="note">[** Note in log: "Mr. Norris saw six cows and one

<p>"Saturday, May 5th. Fine weather and east winds. In my walk
to-day I found a few Matavai people in their dwellings...Tynah took
me to a Opeowpah,<sup>*</sup> or concert; there were three flutes
and two drums; the performance did not lack harmony, but there is a
sameness in the airs, and dull heavy sounds that delight the
natives, but we soon became tired of the performance.</p>
<p class="note">[* Opeowpah or Heiva. Bligh says: "These
performances were formerly called Heivas, but the word being given
to Tomaree Erree of Paparra as a name they are now called
Opeowpah".]</p>
<p>"Sunday, May 6th. Land and sea breezes. Mustered the ship's
company. Performed Divine Service. Oreepyah brought back the things
to-day that had been taken away from Mr. Tobin and Mr. Franklin...I
thanked him and promised him not to forget it. I saw a dwarf here
to-day about thirty-one inches high. The natives agree that he will
never be taller. His name was Tommah.<sup>*</sup> Since my account
on the 30th we have completed with breadfruit plants, 26 boxes and
13 tubs.</p>
<p class="note">[* Turnbull in 1802 also saw a dwarf there.]</p>
<p>"Monday, May 7th. Fair weather. An account was brought me to-day
from Tabyroo that the money was to come from Teturoah...Tabyroo
said he only wanted some person to come for it. In consequence I
directed Mr. Norris to go with the 'Matilda's' people to-morrow and
fetch it.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, May 8th. Land and sea breezes. Fair weather.</p>
<p>"Early in the morning I had a visit from Toepoee, wife of
Pohaitaia Otee, the Chief of Itteah, who was a fine active man and
highly respected. I have mentioned him in my last voyage as a
person who was fed in the same manner as Tynah...nothing can exceed
the vehemence with which his wife expressed herself against Captain
Vancouver's ship. It was there he caught his illness, as did many
others...she described the disease to be a flux. Tynah was called
suddenly to Oparre; on his return he told me he had been to pray,
for he had ordered a man at Tiarraboo to be sacrificed to the
Etuah. About twelve o'clock Iddeah who was on board showed me a
canoe going past the ship with a human sacrifice from Wannah, a
chief of Happyano--this was offered to Otoo. The cause of the
sacrifice was owing to his not having assisted Whydoah, his brother
chief, to get the arms from Tabyroo. This displeased Tynah and
Otoo. Wannah solicited forgiveness, but they refused until after
many concessions they agreed to take him into favour on his
presenting a sacrifice to the King. Upon such occasions it is
sufficient for the dead body to be sent wrapped up in a plaited
cocoanut branch and fastened to a pole. The body to-day was in a
canoe with only one man to conduct it...These sacrifices are truly
shocking and savage...I find that Otoo is betrothed to his cousin
Tarro-aheine, a little girl of twelve months old, a child of his
Aunt Wowwo, born since 1789-90 that first cousins marry. Her father
Moduarro, chief of Morea (when I was here in the 'Bounty') is dead,
and his son Tettoanovee elected in his stead.<sup>*</sup> I imagine
he is about four years old. Mahow whom I have mentioned has only an
honorary title.</p>
<p class="note">[* Note in log: "In my last voyage I have given
particulars of the principal families of this island. From a
connection in the female line, the present Otow's grandmother,
being sister to a King of Tiarraboo, his grandchild, becomes Erree
of that place, the male line being extinct, as the late Whaeahtuah
(whose wife Tynah is now connected with), died without children,
and on his death Teritapanovai, Tynah's second son, was sent to
Tiarraboo to be elected Erree of that part of the island. 'The
Tiarraboo people always insisted that Whaeahtuah was Erree-ra-high
of that country, and Otoo, Erree-ra-high of the western part, but
all the Otoo family say there is only one Erree-ra-high of the
whole. The present one, Teritapanovai, has taken the name of
Whaeahtuah."]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, May 9th. Fine weather with calms. Fine weather with
land and sea breezes.</p>
<p>"About noon Mr. Norris returned from his visit to Tabyroo, who
was now retreated far back in the mountains, and complained of the
treachery of his people. He kept possession of all the musquets!
The money delivered to Mr. Norris and Mr. Marshall, the chief mate,
was 172 dollars, and three half-crown pieces; ten dollars were also
received at the Post, making 182 dollars in all: and a watch
belonging to the 'Matilda's late chief mate was given up. The name
Jan Henkels, maker, Amsterdam, was engraved on the back. Therefore,
thus ends our negotiations for the money. It is not half of what
the Captain left behind him.</p>
<p>"Thursday, May 10th. Employed building places for the plants:
Mr. Ridgeway, surgeon's mate, brought me a guinea, which was
offered him to-day by one of the natives for a knife. It is part of
the missing money.</p>
<p>"Friday, May 11th. Very cloudy weather.</p>
<p>"Employed as yesterday. In addition to my constant guests, Tynah
and his wives and brother, I had my old friend Monah,<sup>*</sup>
spoken of in my last voyage, on board.</p>
<p class="note">[* Spelt Moannah in the "Bounty's" log.]</p>
<p>"Saturday, May 12th. While I was at Van Diemen's Land I procured
a quantity of plank of the metrocedra to make boxes for my plants:
the wood which strangers would imagine valuable for building is not
fit for any purpose but fuel, it is so inclinable to warp and
split. Oreepyah with his nephew Otoo the king came to take leave of
me on going to Paparra to see their relation, Tomaree, the chief of
that place, who lies very ill. But their chief object is to see
what can be done to take some musquets away from the people of that
district which had belonged to the 'Matilda's' boat. Before they
set out it was necessary to consult me. Tynah came and asked for
them to be equipped with presents. I indulged him to the utmost,
and they left us with light hearts, dressed in European clothes,
and with a large quantity of trinkets in their bundles. A few
canoes are passing and repassing, and these supply us with all we
are in need of.</p>
<p>"Matavai still remains a deserted village. Towards Tarrah, which
hill divides Matavai from Oparre, a great deal of injury has been
done to the finest of the trees, in this war: numbers of them are
barked round and are in a dying state. The natives have endeavoured
to save them by laying a bandage of a clayish kind of soil round
the wound and wrapping it carefully over with leaves. Here we find
among uncultured people what has been lately entitled in our own
country as an ingenious device of Dr. Fothergill.</p>
<p>"Not far from this spot was the residence of Peter Heywood, the
villain<sup>*</sup> who assisted in taking the Bounty' from me--the
house was on the foot of a hill, the top of which gave him a fine
lookout. He had regulated the garden and avenue to his house with
some taste. The latter was made conspicuous by a row of fine
shaddock trees, which, like other things, have suffered in the late
war.</p>
<p class="note">[* Heywood was not sixteen years of age at the time
of the mutiny, see <a href="#heywood">earlier</a>.]</p>
<p>"Sunday, May 13th. Cloudy weather, a few showers of rain in the
night.</p>
<p>"Saw every person clean, and as usual on this day I performed
Divine Service. This being the 'Po no t Etuah' as the natives call
it, we have fewer of them about us as they see we observe it
without doing any work.</p>
<p>"Monday, May 14th. Light variable winds and a sultry heat.</p>
<p>"Employed building extra places for the plants and repairing the
launch: examined our plants and arranged all the doubtful ones for
another week's trial and putting them by themselves.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, May 15th. Light winds; the clouds hung heavy about the
hills.</p>
<p>"I now happily found my nervous complaint much removed. I got my
observatory up and my astronomical quadrant ready to make some
observations for the rate of my time-keepers.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, May 16th. We had mostly calms today.</p>
<p>"Only Tynah and Whyerredee remain with us. In the morning had
the seine hauled near the East head of Farrah, and caught 190 lbs.
of fine fish--cavallys two to ten lbs. in weight, fine mullet,
horse mackerel, a kind of herring, a number of small fish something
like a gurnet, and some others not known.</p>
<p>"Thursday, May 17th. Until four o'clock this afternoon it was
calm. Cloudy weather. Very few natives about our Post.</p>
<p>"Friday, May 18th. Calms and cloudy weather.</p>
<p>"Some of our people who have been sent to the river for water
have lately been insulted by worthless fellows who threw stones and
dirt at them...I thought proper to punish such unfriendly
behaviour, and one of them appearing at the Post, I ordered him to
be seized and put in irons. I had little difficulty to explain to
the natives the cause of it, when they all exclaimed, You would
have done right to kill him '; they told me he was a person
belonging to Oreepyah.</p>
<p>"Saturday, May 19th. Light winds.</p>
<p>"At two o'clock this morning a native, under cover of a thick
squall of rain, opened the port of the first lieutenant's cabin,
and took from him the sheet that covered his bed, which was not
discovered until the last inch of it was pulled from him. Boats
were sent after the native but to no effect. The night was so dark
and favoured his escape. Whether this man had hid himself at sunset
when all the natives had left the ship, or had swam off we cannot
determine. He made an attempt first about midnight, but Mr. Bond
not suspecting what the twitches were that he had felt--but which
had awakened him--went to sleep again. What is remarkable I found
that the sentries on deck and at my cabin door, whose walk is also
before Mr. Bond's, and guards each equally, and the mate and
midshipmen all equally attentive to duty. Tynah as usual dined with
me; after dinner I told him that I had put a man in irons whom I
intended to punish for insulting my officers. He agreed that the
man deserved it, and I gave orders that he was to receive
thirty-six lashes...He received the punishment without wincing...it
must be owing to the bodies of these people being constantly
exposed that they are not susceptible...I ordered the prisoner
again in irons.</p>
<p>"Sunday, May 10th. Strong winds and fair weather.</p>
<p>"Performed Divine Service. Another complaint was made to me of a
native beating one of the seamen and giving him a black eye. The
parties happened to be on board, so I could hear both sides of the
story, which went so against the native that I told the seaman to
take his own satisfaction. A few strong blows made his antagonist
jump into the sea. In general I forbid officer or man to strike a
native on any pretence whatever.</p>
<p>"Monday, May 21st. Strong breezes at E.S. East.</p>
<p>"Sufficient supplies; few natives about the ship. After dinner
Tynah solicited me to forgive the man I had in irons. He promised
not to offend again. I forgave him and he was dismissed.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, May 22nd. Moderate breezes and fair weather.</p>
<p>"I have now got most of my plants that I brought from England
and the Cape of Good Hope planted here, where they will be taken
care of; the principal dependence I have is in an old man, already
spoken of as Mr. Nelson's friend, he having taken care of some
shaddock trees that he had planted.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, May 23rd. Winds at east.</p>
<p>"So little is brought to the ship that I am obliged to send the
boat to Oparre for supplies. Carpenters fitting a new trussell tree
to the mainmast.</p>
<p>"Thursday, May 24th. This morning I was informed that an Indian
had got in by stealth and stolen several articles of clothing. In
the night a fellow was seen about the 'Assistant with the design of
doing mischief: the boats were sent after him, but the night was
dark and he escaped.</p>
<p>"I have frequent conversations with Tynah respecting the want of
power or order in his Government to prevent thieving. He has told
me that only good people could be governed so as to prevent
thieving. 'Townahs or rogues, he said, would at all times, when it
was in their power, do mischief, and thieve, and could only be
guarded against by a strict watch; and he desired me (whenever we
had it in our power) to put them to death as an example to deter
others.</p>
<p>"I cannot discover that they have any custom or law to inflict
punishment for particular crimes by trial. The strongest man or
most powerful chief decides in his own cause, but there is an
appeal from the inferior people of every district to their superior
chief who judges fairly of the matters in dispute.</p>
<p>"Friday, May 25th. Light breezes and calms.</p>
<p>"At daylight I had the ship unmoored to examine the cables which
we found not at all injured. By two o'clock shifted our berth a
little more to the N.N.E. After dinner Tynah arid his wives
requested I would accompany them to a Heiva. They are remarkably
fond of these amusements...the number of persons collected on shore
were about two hundred. The performers were two men who did the
interlude, and a woman and a little girl the dancing part. The
Airarahyree or plaited cocoanut leaf was as usual brought to me,
but there was nothing new in the performance. In the evening we
gave great entertainment to the natives by setting off a dozen
sky-rockets. We have ever found them delighted with our
fireworks.</p>
<p>"Saturday, May 26th. Fresh breezes and fair weather.</p>
<p>"I received a parcel of five breadfruit plants to-day from
Tiarraboo, which are vastly superior to any at this place; I had
heard of this kind, and had such reports confirmed by the chief,
that I employed two men to go for mine. Our number is now increased
by seven tubs, containing three to five plants, seven small pots
containing one and two, and seven extra pots of ayeyahs (the Jambo
of Java). I have taken some small breadfruit trees seven feet high
in very large tubs, and I expect they will stand the sea...all the
plants are now in charming order, and spreading their leaves
delightfully. I have completed nice airy spaces for them on the
quarter deck and galleries, and shall sail with every inch of space
filled up.</p>
<p>"Sunday, May 27th. This day terminated with heavy rain.</p>
<p>"Mustered the ship's company, performed Divine Service. I went
on board the 'Assistant'; everything to my satisfaction. Tynah and
his wives dined with me to-day; he had, however, taken such a dose
of Ava before he came on board, that his common allowance of wine
made him drunk. It required several people to hold him...Iddeah
took more pains to assist him than Whyerredee...At daybreak he rose
as well as ever he had been in his life.</p>
<p>"In the beginning of the night Tarrah Hill was beautifully
illuminated with flambeaux to light Tynah over it, he having stayed
late at Oparre. A prettier sight was perhaps never seen than the
effects of the lights upon the smooth water about the shore, for
they were brilliant and numerous. When any of the Royal Family pass
over the hill, they have it lighted, as the road is bad.
Notwithstanding the rags the Otaheitans have for clothes, we find
some of them so honest that our people in general have given them
their linen to wash, and no losses have been yet experienced.</p>
<p>"I have endeavoured by every means in my power to get a
knowledge whether marriage has any common or general ceremony
attending it, to give legality to it, and I find from the best
collected accounts among those capable of giving me information,
that a ceremony is not general.</p>
<p>"The women are asked for their consent, and until they give it,
the man dare not take the woman away. When the parents approve of
the match, there is a ceremony of prayer at a Morai.</p>
<p>"Monday, May 28th. During the morning hard rain, other parts
westerly winds.</p>
<p>"Accounts were brought to Iddeah and Tynah that their
daughter<sup>*</sup> was dead. They cared very little about it,
particularly Tynah...Iddeah at last shed a few tears. The people
who had care of the child had been with it to see some Heivas at
Paparra: it had caught a violent cold and died on the way back to
its parents.</p>
<p class="note">[* Tahamydoa.]</p>
<p>"Tuesday, May 29th. Land and sea breezes.</p>
<p>"This morning I went to Oparre to look after some plants I had
ordered to be planted in the hills at Tynah's country seat. I have
now planted fifty-nine orange and citron plants, and twelve
pineapples there, besides many seeds, and eight young firs, which
the natives value most. Upon any part of the hills the situation is
delightful, and this place of Tynah's is charmingly shaded with
cocoanut trees and breadfruit. He has a few old people to look
after it whose only stock are a few fowls and half-starved hogs.
Whenever Tynah goes there he takes food with him--our repast to-day
was a baked fowl.</p>
<p>"On my return I found Iddeah attending her dead child at a
distance...The child was laid in a neat shed with her hands crossed
over her breast. Some scarlet European cloth as well as some native
cloth covered her body, and a man attended cleanly dressed and
stood there to show the child to their friends. A remarkable
silence gave a solemn cast to the scene rendered effective by
servants preparing the teappapow...This is a stage elevated six
feet above the ground, fenced round with reeds, and neatly
ornamented with coloured cloth, leaves, and flowers. The body
remains till all that is perishable is gone, and then the bones are
put in the earth. They told me the mourning would be over in two
days.</p>
<p>"It is only when an Erree lies in state that the body remains so
long on the teappapow. With the lower orders of the people, the
body is put in the earth after the short time allowed for mourning.
Our good friend Tynah was not at all concerned at the loss of his
child. He would not, however, return with me to the ship, for he
seemed to consider it decent to remain with Iddeah.</p>
<p>"In my last voyage I have spoken of natives embalming their
chiefs, and now I find that there are particular people for this
office called Meeree<sup>*</sup> teappapow. They are similar to
undertakers.</p>
<p class="note">[* Ellis spells this word Miri.]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, May 30th. Land and sea breezes and fair weather.</p>
<p>"We have still sufficient supplies to allow every person &frac12; lb.
of pork a day, but no breadfruit can be got for common use.</p>
<p>"Thursday, May 31st. Ther. 75&deg; to 79&deg;.</p>
<p>"Unhappily, to-day I had a severe nervous head ache."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. THE BREADFRUIT
PLANTS COLLECTED.</h2>
<p>Busy as he was in completing his cargo of breadfruit trees
intended for Jamaica, Captain Bligh still found time to record in
considerable detail his impressions of the Tahitians. Unfortunately
his main object, the spreading of the cultivation of the
breadfruit, was destined to have little or no result. But the
particulars he gives concerning the natives themselves, and also
with regard to the divisions and partitions of the island at that
time, form perhaps the most valuable of his observations.</p>
<p>In the following pages Captain Bligh also relates how after
bidding the natives farewell, he sailed from Tahiti.</p>
<p>"Friday, June 1st, 1792. Moderate breezes in the east.</p>
<p>"Nothing new! A few natives about us bringing a scanty supply of
plantains, cocoanuts, vees, and a few tarro.</p>
<p>"Saturday, June 2nd. During the day strong breezes from
W.S.W.</p>
<p>"I find my nervous complaint better which I attribute to bathing
in Matavai River at sunrise; the water is remarkably cold and may
have a better effect than seawater.</p>
<p>"Sunday, June 3rd. Light winds at night but strong wind during
the day.</p>
<p>"Performed Divine Service. Tynah and his wives dined with me
to-day as usual. His youngest child is ill and he solicited the
attendance of the surgeon. We found it in the care of an old man:
and it was in a deplorable state. I told Iddeah to take better care
of her child, but she insisted that Whyerredee's attention should
be engaged and not hers. It is not extraordinary that Tynah is not
remarkably fond of his children, for he is in some degree weaned
from them by the accursed custom of their becoming superior in
rank. On that account no one approaches them except the mother to
give them suck, and the man who is nurse. When the father speaks to
the child it is at a distance of ten yards. Thus until the children
become men and women they do not mix together like other people.
Happily it is different with the lower orders. The fathers and
mothers have mostly their little flock of children about them. They
nurse them with great care and tenderness and receive returns of
affection and respect. Few more engaging children are to be met
with could we divest ourselves of the dislike to the colour.</p>
<p>"Monday, June 4th. In commemoration of our most gracious and
good King, we held this day a Festival. At eight in the morning
both ships were dressed to the delight of the natives. At noon the
marines were drawn up under arms and fired three vollies, and the
Indians joined their cheers with ours. At one the ships fired
twenty-one guns each. To every person was served an allowance of
liquor. At night I had a dozen sky rockets sent off, and Mr. Tobin
having made two small balloons the whole were successfully
displayed to the great pleasure of Goo persons. 'Mahannah no Erree
Britanee! King George.' (The King of England's birthday! King
George!) was repeated every minute by men, women, and children. All
the chiefs were collected around us, and drank to His Majesty's
good health and afterwards dined with me.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, June 5th. The indolence of the people is so great,
that now the breadfruit is not to be had...they have little to
eat,...no country in the world would produce more provisions, yet
these lazy wretches cultivate scarce a yam or potato: their late
broils joined to natural indolence has most likely been the cause
of the present scarcity.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, June 6th. I sent Tynah in the boat at dawn with
sufficient presents to purchase a large quantity of provisions; he
returned about three o'clock with only a few plantains and
cocoanuts. I never saw a regular plantain walk in Otaheite: a few
trees are struck in here and there about their houses, and around
the hills in the same manner. This is all the trouble taken, or
with anything that requires planting; cleaning and keeping their
grounds free from weeds is beneath the care of an Otaheitan. They
have as little neatness about their dwellings; an Otaheitan
village--if their mixed dwellings may be so called--is the dirtiest
place imaginable. Everything is thrown down before and around the
house...yet no person in the world is cleaner in his person. So
much sloth is attributed to the vast support that Nature has given
them in providing them with the most valuable fruits of the earth,
the breadfruit and the cocoanut.</p>
<p>"I asked Iddeah to-day if her name was to be changed on account
of her child dying. She said 'No!' as the name was given to the
child's aunt Wattawow (who in my last voyage was called Towry). It
is a very common custom to shift names in this country. A chief may
take any name he likes, and if it happens to be the name of a
thing, or of day, or night, another is thought of for it to be
called by, and he retains the name. Heiva, the common name for all
the dances, is now known by the term of Opeowpah.</p>
<p>"Pomorre, the name of Tynah and Iddeah, is from Po--night, and
Morre--the name of the disease the child died of. To make up for
the loss of 'Po' in the language Ooarrooee is substituted. Oreepyah
has fancifully taken the name of Abobo; in the language it means
'to-morrow,' but it is very odd that in supplying the want of this
word, they have substituted 'Ahnonnahigh,' which before, and now,
means 'yesterday'. Since my last voyage, Heiva, the common name for
all the dances, has been taken by Terrederree, Chief of Paparra,
and son of Oamo. The latter was his first name, next he took the
name of Tomaree, and now Heiva. Tynah also took the name Mattee,
which signifies 'to kill,' and Poee was ordered to be used instead
of it, which was strictly attended to. I remember Iddeah scolding
at the people when they inadvertently made use of the word mattee'.
I should imagine this mode of changing names must possess many
disadvantages to the language: the alterations in the course of a
century will be very great, and they will make it difficult to be
understood.</p>
<p>"Thursday, June 7th. Fresh breezes.</p>
<p>"Found a few plants attacked by a kind of weasel...therefore
directed them to be shifted lest the other plants be injured.</p>
<p>"Friday, June 8th. Fresh W. breezes. At night cloudy.</p>
<p>"Sufficient supplies of hogs, plantains, and tarro have been
brought on board. A party are on shore cutting up a tree that Tynah
gave us.</p>
<p>"Saturday, June 9th. Light breezes.</p>
<p>"Hauled the seine: the young breadfruit are in abundance on the
trees, and I get a head or two brought me almost every day.</p>
<p>"Monday, June 11th. Calms with winds at west.</p>
<p>"Mr. Guthrie informed me an Indian was discovered thieving at
the Post, at half-past ten at night, and the sentinel had fired at
him. These people have become so troublesome on dark nights that it
requires all our exertions to prevent them taking all we have. I
fear some one will be shot for I have been under the necessity to
give orders to deter them. One vicious fellow may destroy our
plants and cut our ship adrift! Every one knows they must not come
near the Post after dark.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, June 12th. Light westerly winds.</p>
<p>"We have few natives about us. Tynah has been so bad lately that
I have had to forbid anyone giving him liquor. I passed in my walk
to-day a Morai which was called Rooahadoo, and on it was the piece
of cocoanut leaves which is called Tepaou when presented at a
Chief's feet. The Morai consisted of a few stones a few feet square
with pieces of plaited cocoanut leaves and tarro placed before it.
The altar of offering was a palm stump with a small stage on which
was a cocoanut grater (a piece of coral), some cocoanuts and an
empty basket. I found it was erected to ensure success to a ware or
dam Tynah has made with stones without Point Venus, in order to
catch fish, and I am told that prayers have been performed there by
persons of the priesthood. I heard that the thief who was fired at
in the night was wounded, being shot through shoulder, and has set
off to Tettaha.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, June 13th. Much swell in the bay.</p>
<p>"Our plants are still doing well.</p>
<p>"Thursday, June 14th. Light westerly winds. Completing the
rigging.</p>
<p>"Tynah, Oreepyah, and their brother, Whydooah, stupify
themselves with ava every day. They have, however, promised me to
drink less of it in future.</p>
<p>"Friday, June 15th. The natives seem indifferent to any
intercourse of trade with us, for we have scarce twenty persons on
board a day, and not more now come to the Post at sundown to see
the marines exercised.</p>
<p>"Saturday, June 16th. To-day we have more supplies than we can
use of everything but breadfruit, canoes having brought off
plantains, tarro, and several hogs to the ships.</p>
<p>"Sunday, June 17th. Variable winds and calms. Mustered the
ship's company. Performed Divine Service.</p>
<p>"Tynah had a visit to-day from some of the Tiarraboo people, so
a Maownah or wrestling match gave a change to the dull scene which
we experience every day, but as the Tiarraboo people had only a few
champions, a number of fine active boys gave us more amusement than
the men. The strangers were more uneasy at every victory they
gained for fear it would displease me, and I could not convince
them I was disinterested. There were several knock-down blows
between some of the parties before they grappled.</p>
<p>"Monday, June 18th. Our friend Tootaha returned from his tour
round the island. Otoo, the young king, with his grandfather Otow,
will be absent for some time. It appears the old man's journey is
for the purpose of collecting cloth and hogs, etc., to sell to the
people of the ships and to make friends of all his chiefs before I
sail.</p>
<p>"The plants are doing exceedingly well, which is a peculiar
happiness to me, and as my time of sailing draws near it makes
their well-doing anxiously interesting to me.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, June 19th. Light easterly winds.</p>
<p>"A tolerable sized chest was shown to me to-day in our manner by
an Otaheitan. It was really a curiosity: the hinges were made of
wood, both sides being dovetailed, and put together perfectly
square, and the lock with a bolt all of wood was made like ours
with a piece of iron for a key. The whole showed such ingenuity
that I rewarded the man, and he bartered the chest away for an
English one to one of the gardeners. I was sorry to hear again of a
sacrifice taking place.<sup>*</sup> I am now satisfied they are
very frequent.</p>
<p class="note">[* Note in log: "Iddeah informed me that the chiefs
of Waennah (called Ohainne (Huaheine) in Captain Cook's map) had
sent one to Otoo. I found it was wrapt up in a plaited cocoanut
branch, and slung to a pole...the late war between Oparre and
Matavai was the cause of this sacrifice. The people of Waennah took
part with Matavai, and the offence was not to be forgiven but by
this melancholy claim. The absence of Otoo prevents anything being
done until his return when the eye will be presented, and the Etuah
supplicated to continue the friendship between the two
districts."]</p>
<p>"If a chief or powerful man seriously offends the Erree-ra-high,
he is obliged to obtain forgiveness by this means; it is not to be
refused, so sacred it is as a pledge of good faith, and it is
evidently not confined to making peace or declaring war, or
supplicating the Etuah or on an emergency or general calamity.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, June 20th. I went out to-day to sound about the bay,
and towards Oparre we found many coral banks and some dangerous
places for a large ship coming into the bay: 3, 7, 4 fms. were
obtained in several places off Tarrah towards the Dolphin. On my
landing at the second station to take some bearings, I was seized
with burning heat that I could no longer support myself. I got into
the shade of the trees and by help of some kind natives, who
brought me cocoanuts and apples, I recovered. I left the rest to be
done by Lieutenant Portlock, whose alertness and attention to duty
makes me at all times think of him with regard and esteem.</p>
<p>"Thursday, June 21st. I happily recovered from my fever but
remain oppressed with headache. I dare not expose myself to the
sun, the shining of it affects me so that I cannot bear it.</p>
<p>"Friday, June 22nd. I found myself better to-day. I was able to
protract my survey, and examine the soundings about this place. I
continue to bathe in the river which is cold and refreshing. At
intervals of ten days and a fortnight we have fleets of ten and
fifteen sail of canoes passing and repassing to and from Teturoah.
In the course of the night a thief found an opportunity of passing
the sentinels at the Post, and to take out of the house a bag of
clothes belonging to Lieutenant Guthrie.</p>
<p>"The guard has hitherto been three sentinels, one corporal to
visit them and see they do their duty and with a midshipman to
superintend the relief every two hours. I ordered another sentinel,
so we now have four sentinels.</p>
<p>"Saturday, June 23rd. Very sufficient supplies and breadfruit
coming in season again. I suffered vastly in my head. To-day I
cannot bear the sight of the sun.</p>
<p>"Sunday, June 24th. Mustered the ship's company. Performed
Divine Service. My friends Tynah and Oreepyah appear much concerned
at the theft committed on Friday night, and have promised to
discover the thief. I have determined to send Lieutenant Portlock
to Attahooroo to bring away the 'Matilda's' boat which Monah has
promised to see after for me. My motive in taking this boat if
worth repairs is to assist me in case of accident in my voyage.</p>
<p>"Monday, June 25th. At dawn of day Lieutenant Portlock set
out.</p>
<p>"I sent Tynah to Tettaha with Lieutenant Tobin to try to get Mr.
Guthrie's clothes; they returned and were not able to get a single
stolen article.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, June 26th. Moderate Trade Wind, E. by S.</p>

[<i>Drawn by Lieut. G Tobin, 1792</i>]</p>
<p>"A little before noon I had the pleasure to see Lieutenant
Portlock arrive from Attahooroo, and with him the whaleboat, which
after some deliberation was given up to him, but not by the general
voice of the people. Attahooroo is divided into two districts, and
is the largest country in the island. The northernmost, called
Taaigh, was governed by Pohaitaia, and Paterre, the southernmost
portion, was governed by Tettowah, men of much consequence when I
was here in 1788, and in Captain Cook's time<sup>*</sup>, but these
men are now dead, and children are elected in their stead. Tettowah
left a wife and a son who naturally succeeds to his power and
influence, but Pohaitaia left no child, and I believe in
consequence the present minor chief, his successor and some
relation, is not firmly fixed in his government.</p>
<p class="note">[* Bligh says: "Oporreeonoo or the Great Peninsula
of Otaheite is divided into 12 counties under these names, Matavai,
Oparre, Tettaha, Taaigh, Paterre, Pappara, Whyoreddee, Whyerree,
Ideeah, Whaennah, Tierrai, Happyano. These counties have different
districts or chiefdoms, and it is a mistake to call the whole
Oporreeonoo. They sometimes place Atteemono between Pappara and
Whyoreddee. Under the head of Attahooroo lie Tettaha, Taaigh, and
Paterre. Under the head of Oporreeonoo lie Oparre, Matavai,
Happyano, Tierrai, Whaennah, and Ideeah. Under the head of
Otaiwyotah or Tevvyootah lie Pappara, Atteemono, Whyoreddee, and
Whyerree.<br>
<br>
"Tiarraboo makes a fourth grand division under the head of Tevvyty
and the whole land is called Taheite (Otaheite improperly) from no
Taheite, i.e. of Taheite--the sign of the genitive case. Tevvyty is
also divided into twelve counties.<br>
<br>
"When the island was divided into 4 general divisions it was
governed by one king. Since I have known it the divisions have a
power which govern independent of the rest. The division of
Tevvyootah is governed by a person who certainly has had equal
power to Otoo. This is Tomaree. He had the eye of the human
sacrifice presented to him, wore the marro, and every person
uncovered to him. Every person agrees that no chief had such power
as Otoo and Pomarre, but this was before the present boy Otoo was
born. All the superior marks of distinction are now shown to him.
Tomaree is the son of the famous Obereah. He married Tynah's sister
and is Otoo's uncle.<br>
<br>
"The division of Tevvyty has been since our time governed by one
Whaeahtuah. This has always been the name of the person who reigns
there, and as Tynah's second son has become heir, he has taken the
name.<br>
<br>
"The division of Oporreeonoo is governed by Otoo so that here are 3
distinct princedoms, and I believe Attahooroo is the fourth.<br>
<br>
"To know the exact state of the Government a person would require
to spend some time in each part. I conclude that Otaheite is a
Kingdom divided into four grand divisions or Princedoms, each of
these is divided into Governments, and these are subdivided into
districts.<br>
<br>
"There are two words they attach to the different subdivisions of
the island, one is 'Manno' and the other 'Matynah'. Fortunately
Oparre and Attahooroo have each two mannos, but all the others and
even Tiarraboo they say are 'not mannos' but 'matynah's'. The
people of Oporreeonoo are 'Matynahs no Tynah'. Those of Tiarraboo
are the people (manno) of Whaeahtuah and those of Attahooroo of
Tettowah arid Pohaitaia. Yet they say the whole of them are
'Matynahs no Otoo '. This certainly implies that he is their King.
Matynah signifies a set of people belonging to and governed by a
chief, but I am at a loss to know what manno means unless it is a
place of resort or palace of the King."]</p>
<p>"It was at Paterre the whaleboat was found; the mob were for
keeping it, but Tettowah's wife ordered it to be given up, which
after a few hours was effected upon Mr. Portlock's declaration that
if he did not return with it I would come round in a day or two and
set fire to the country.</p>
<p>"The endeavours of Tettowah's wife were seconded by a clever
young fellow called Terraighteerree; his official capacity is that
of a priest, and his word has great weight among the people. On the
boat being launched, Mr. Portlock made a present to the chief which
I had given him for that purpose. He states that they received it
with great eagerness, as if they knew the value of iron without
ever having had the use of it, and they expressed a thankfulness
which gave him great pleasure. They gave him cause to think that
the Matavai and Oparre people had prevented them having intercourse
with us, and on his assuring them of my friendship it spread
general satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Tettowah's wife with Terraighteerree and Towryighno, the second
husband, asked to see the ship where they arrived in time for
dinner. Tettowah's wife they called Owehee Vaheine, a common name
for women. She is a stout, good-looking woman. I found a shyness
about our friend Tynah and his wives to this woman and her party.
He had bantered me the night before about my getting back the boat,
and I now in turn laughed at him. I also made a very large present
of valuable things to the strangers, and made a great deal of them,
so they were truly delighted. The men ate cheese and drank porter:
all strangers ask what the cheese is, and it is a standing joke
with our friends to call it teappapow (part of a dead body).</p>
<p>"In the evening they all went on shore with Tynah, who provided
them with all they wanted. Owehee Vaheine ate nothing while with
us, for no women save Iddeah and Whyerredee will ever eat before
us, and on shore it is their custom to eat apart from the men.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, June 27th. Sufficient supplies: washed ship and kept
fires in all night; repairing the whaleboat.</p>
<p>"Monday, July 2nd. Hot weather; their breadfruit still continues
scarce, but the trees have a fine show on them about half and
two-thirds grown, and some we got perfectly fit for use. Plantains
and tarro are the principal fruit kind. Yarns have been neglected
by these idle people of Matavai and Oparre.</p>
<p>"We had a few inferior chiefs from the East of Oporeeonoo to
visit us to-day. After dinner they began to enumerate the healthy
ships. They describe the 'Jenny' of Bristol as a miserable vessel,
and the commander a great rascal.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The "Jenny" was a three-masted schooner, and her
captain's name was Baker. She met Vancouver's ships at Nootka in
1792. On her way there she had called at the Sandwich Islands, and
had carried away two native girls both belonging to Onehow. As a
rumour was spread abroad at Nootka that Baker intended to sell
these girls as slaves, he begged Captain Vancouver to receive them
on board the "Discovery". Vancouver returned them to Attowai, one
of the Sandwich Islands, in order that they might be restored to
their friends.]</p>
<p>"My friend Tynah undertook to go after the thief who had stolen
the goods from the Post. I find it was done by an inferior chief of
Tiarraboo, a friend of Oreepyah's, to whom we had shown
attention.</p>
<p>"It is astonishing with what indifference these people speak of
death. They have no idea of a future state, but say they fall into
a state of nothingness without reward or punishment after life.</p>
<p>"Thursday, July 5th. Tynah returned to-day with part of the
stolen goods. Some of the 'Matilda's' men were round at Oaitipeha
and brought an account that a plank and part of a yard of the
'Matilda' were drifted there. I do not think this is likely, as
from the Captain's account of the shoal it is distant two hundred
and seven leagues from this place in the direction of E. 64&deg; W.</p>
<p>"Friday, July 6th. Very cloudy weather and heavy rain all day.
The rain to-day swelled the river to a great degree, only one turn
of water could be got on board.</p>
<p>"Saturday, July 7th. Some of our officers this day were
successful in duck-shooting as they have been frequently in their
excursions to Oparre. They brought me an account that the chief of
Paparra, Tomaree, was in possession of many of my books, and one
volume of <i>Damapier's Voyage</i> which he had given them: some
remarks I had written on it with a pencil in the blank pages at the
end of the book were perfectly distinct. I have sent Tomaree a
message that I shall be glad to see him.</p>
<p>"Sunday, July 8th. Performed Divine Service. Otow and Oberreeoah
came to see me. These old people are now infirm. They are happy in
their children whose filial attention to their parents is such a
blessing to the old pair, and delights me on every occasion.</p>
<p>"Monday, July 9th. My plants are now in such charming
forwardness that the botanists have determined I need not be
detained here any longer than a week or two.</p>
<p>"Our most laborious work is watering. In this particular I had
two things to attend to. One to start all my old water, the other
to take up the new water at such a distance from the seaside as to
be sure no salt particles were mixed with it.</p>
<p>"I find our friends disconsolate at our preparations. Tynah
considers himself slighted in my not permitting him to proceed to
England with me, and our friendship hinged on my complying to take
one of his men, who, he said, would be of great service to him,
when I sent him out again after he had seen all he could see and
learn in England. He was sure King George, had he been here, would
not refuse him, and he enumerated the many ways he had served us,
particularising his conduct to the 'Pandora'...so I complied with
his request. The man's name is Mydiddee. He is a servant and
therefore more eligible person for the purpose of learning than a
chief. Such a towtow is more likely to benefit his country than a
chief who might be led into idleness and dissipation as soon as he
arrived in Europe, as was the case with Ornai. He is a fine active
person of about twenty-two years of age.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, July 11th. Employed watering. In the afternoon Otoo
arrived from his tour which was shortened by the news he had of the
ships sailing. A few Paparra people came round. Tomaree refused to
accompany him for fear of not being cordially received by me. I am
informed by the 'Matilda's' people that Tomaree has many of my
books and papers: he had the impudence to send me a message
yesterday that if I would send him cartridge paper he would deliver
up a portion of my books. It appears that he is in possession of
all the powder that the 'Matilda's' people brought, as well as the
arms, and he intends to make cartridges out of the books. As Otoo
came to the Post I saluted him with seven guns, which gave much
satisfaction. On my going on shore a wrestling match took place
amid 500 people. I diverted the strangers with a few fireworks at
night.</p>
<p>"Thursday, July 12th. Fresh breezes at east during the day.</p>
<p>"At daybreak the sacrifice that I have spoken of on the 19th was
removed to a double canoe which was part of the offering of the
chief Ohodoo of Waennah. He was himself in the canoe with eighteen
men. The dead body was laid across the fore part of the canoe, and
by it were lying--tied up--five live hogs. Near the body were eight
or ten long rods, each rod had short pieces about eight inches
long, neatly tied to it in the form of a cross. About these and the
tops of the rods a few red feathers were fastened...the whole is
called Mannooteah. The canoe was hung round with coarse white
cloth, and proceeded to Oparre with drums beating. At eight o'clock
I set off from the ship accompanied by Otoo, Tynah, and his wives;
Otoo received us on landing. The progress of the canoe was so slow
that we got to Oparre first. As soon as the canoe arrived Tootaha
conducted us to the Morai and began a prayer, and they all joined
invoking different deities...the bundle like the Egyptian Mummy
called the Etuah was brought on a man's shoulders, and the canoe
hauled on the beach a few yards from the Morai. The priest now
quitted the Morai and seated himself at the sacrifice...two drums
beating while he pronounced a prayer. This ceremony lasted a
quarter of an hour. Then the sacrifice was laid on the ground
before Otoo, who was all the time sitting on his man's
shoulders--the basket was taken off and the body and the head
exposed...one eye was laid on the steps of the Morai and the other
was offered to Otoo...while the Etuah was held up on a man's
shoulders. They then retired to a pavement called Teppah, where
Otoo dismounted and the Etuah was placed on the ground. The King
was invested with the marro or feather belt, and had it put round
him in the common manner in which the marros are worn--round the
hips. During this ceremony there was a pretty chant from the
priests. I had agreed to fire three vollies on the occasion, and I
accordingly ordered a volley to be fired from the boat as soon as
the boy was invested. This was repeated three times amid shouts of
'Mairah Erree'--Long live the King. I noticed that the marro since
I last saw it was ornamented with hair. It was some hair belonging
to one of the people of the 'Bounty,' an ostentatious mark of their
connection with the English...it was of a pretty auburn colour, and
they told me that it was the hair of Skinner, who was barber to the
ship's company.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Richard Skinner, barber on board the "Bounty,"
who joined the mutineers.]</p>
<p>"The boy was now placed again on his man's shoulders, the other
man took up the Etuah, and they went back to the Great Temple. Here
Otoo was disrobed and the Marro and the Etuah were taken away by
the priests...The hogs were given to us. In the interval the body
was left unprotected, and I found this was owing to the offering
being an atonement to the Erree, and not a sacrifice to the Etuah.
All the men sacrificed to the Etuah are put in the earth adjoining
the Great Temple, but those sacrificed as an atonement to the King
are buried under the coral rocks. The water burying ground lies at
the entrance to the harbour.</p>
<p>"Friday, July 13th. Employed completing for sea.</p>
<p>"An apparent regret at our departure is only visible in Tynah
and his wife Iddeah. With them it is very sincere...the
indifference with which the general run of the people treat us is
remarkable to me. The great proof of their indifference is that few
people came about us...hitherto I have been accustomed to see them
show great concern at parting...I can only compare them to some of
our English folk who ask their friends to remain in their house
when they wish them out of it. There are many, however, here who
are interested in our well-doing.</p>
<p>"Saturday, July 14th. Light westerly airs and calms. Many of the
natives are desirous of going with us, and have asked their friends
to shut them up in their chests and in casks.</p>
<p>"The distress of Tynah and Iddeah at my leaving them is very
great, but Whyerredee cares little about us. I have promised to ask
permission of King George for Tynah to be brought home by the first
ship sent out.</p>
<p>"Sunday, July 15th. Very squally weather, and little rain. In
the morning I struck observatory and finished my astronomical
observations.</p>
<p>"A large double canoe arrived from Ulitea. About fifteen men
came in her--Errees or chiefs. They had a shed or hut in the middle
of it which sheltered six or seven persons. I am sure from the
rough sea they had that these vessels made better weather of it
than we suppose.</p>
<p>"Monday, July 16th. Employed in various duties completing for
sea. No strangers about us but the Ulitea people: to the principal
man I made a handsome present. To old Otow likewise I paid my last
gift, and made it so truly valuable that the poor man could not
refrain from shedding tears of gratitude. By night the ship was
truly well fitted; besides the cabin I appropriated the quarter
deck and other places for the plants. Pots, tubs, etc., total
yesterday 937, to-day, 1281.</p>
<p>"Before sundown I embarked my party amid a concourse of people
who regretted our leaving, particularly Otoo, poor boy, who cried a
great deal. We saluted him with three cheers and they returned the
compliment. Brought on board the whaleboat.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, July 17th. By daylight we had a number of canoes round
us and at noon a hundred of them. The light winds we had and those
from the sea prevented us getting out. I therefore steadied the
ship with a stream anchor.</p>
<p>"I thought I had nearly done making presents, but I had a
greater throng to-day than yesterday, and most of the lower order
of people begging for something to remember me by. I rewarded them
for their good behaviour. At night Tynah with his wives slept on
board.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, July 18th. The weather came clear to-day, but we had
such west winds and north until 3 p.m. that we could not sail. I
had the west end of the Dolphin Bank buoyed, and at four we got
under way and towed out into a fresh sea breeze, 'Assistant' in
company.</p>
<p>"In the morning I went to old Oberreeroah and Otow to take my
leave of them. About nine o'clock Otoo came off to the ship in a
double canoe. He would not come on board; I therefore gave him my
presents from my boat. They consisted of shirts, printed linen,
large axes, knives, hatchets, scissors, nails, saw, and beads; they
were very gratefully received. We parted, shaking hands, and a
promise exacted from me to come again to Otaheite.<sup>*</sup>
Tynah, Iddeah, and Oreepyah and their servants requested to be last
out of the ships. At day dawn I made up my presents for them, and
having stored them with an assortment of every article, I had the
whole of them embarked and ordered them to be landed at Oparre.
During the absence of the boat we kept plying off and on. About
eleven she returned and was hoisted in.</p>
<p class="note">[* The natives built for Bligh "a large oval-shaped
native house" which was finished in 1797 and evidently they
expected him to return. "It was pleasantly situated on the western
side of the river near Point Venus."--Ellis.]</p>
<p>"It continuing to blow hard we made sail under double reefs, and
at noon<sup>*</sup> Point Venus was S.E. distant six miles, and the
N. part of Morea N.W.</p>
<p class="note">[* July 19th where the log account begins. Twelve
hours earlier than civil account.]</p>
<p>"We had marks both of regret and indifference in leaving this
hospitable place. This is the second time I have experienced their
friendship and regard, and I have done everything in my power to
reward them. I can venture to say that they are sensible of it.</p>
<p>"After earnest solicitations I gave our friend Tynah a musquet
and five hundred rounds of powder and shot, as he had served us
well.</p>
<p>"To my astonishment I found a man who had always been collecting
with the botanists secreted between decks and I had not the heart
to make him jump overboard. I conceived he might be useful in
Jamaica...therefore directed he should be under the care of the
botanists. His name is Bobbo.<sup>*</sup> Mydiddee parted
affectionately with the chiefs. He left them and his country
without shedding a tear although much attached to them all.</p>
<p class="note">[* He was nicknamed Jackets by the English. His
name is written Pappo by Mr. Tobin.]</p>

<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER CHAPTER X. WYTOOTACKEE
AND THE TONGA ISLANDS.</h2>
<p>ON Friday, July 10th, in hazy weather and with a cross-running
sea, the ships left Tahiti, first passing Morea and afterwards the
southern shores of Huahine<sup>*</sup> and Ulitea. Matthew Flinders
writes of them: "These are high mountainous islands and contain
good harbours: the land to the north of Ulitea is Bola
Bola.<sup>**</sup> They acknowledge the Aree-ra-i of Otaheite which
place their canoes often visit, and where many of their people
live." When he had left these islands behind Captain Bligh steered
in a south-westerly direction for five days until the 25th. On this
day the "Assistant," then leading, made the signal to the
"Providence" that land was in sight bearing S.W., distant 4 or 5
leagues.</p>
<p class="note">[* Huahine, otherwise Huaheine, is the easternmost
of the Society Group discovered by Cook in 1769. Raiatea, or
Ulitea, lies 7 leagues westward of Huahine.]</p>

<p class="caption">Wytootackee (Aitutaki)</p>
<p>Bligh's log continues: "Wednesday, July 25th. I determined to
take a look at Wytootackee<sup>*</sup> not only to endeavour to
gain information respecting the 'Pandora' and of the 'Bounty' but
also to ascertain its exact situation and examine the west side of
it for anchorage. I went round the east and south-west part of it
when I first discovered the island in the 'Bounty'.</p>
<p class="note">[* Aitutaki or Wytootackee is the northernmost of
the Cook Group, and was discovered on April 11th, 1789, by Captain
Bligh in the "Bounty" about a fortnight before his men mutinied. He
spells the name Wytootackee in his charts, and Whytootackee in his
log.]</p>
<p>"The land is remarkable by a round hill which lies near the
northernmost extremity and it is of very conspicuous height. After
a very boisterous night I bore away, and having passed the N.E.
side we hauled round the north end and kept working under the lee
of the land trying for an anchorage which we did not find after
having sounded in 140 fms. of line without striking the bottom.</p>
<p>"What I have to remark new on the geography of this island is
that for an extent of 3 miles on the west side there is a perfectly
good shelter for a ship under sail. Like a border round the shore
runs a steep reef. It lies at a small distance from the beach
where, I believe, in moderate weather our boats may land in
safety.</p>
<p>"My sketch of the island will give a just idea of it. It is
remarkable that I made the longitude of the round hill in my last
voyage to be 200&deg; 19' E. by time-keepers, and this time from a mean
of my three time-keepers 200&deg; 17' E., from whence I conclude that
200&deg; 18' is very near the truth after so short a run from
Otaheite.</p>
<p>"This island which the natives call Whytootackee is 10 miles in
circuit. Its north part lies in 18&deg; 50' S. and its south end in 18&deg;
54' S. Eight small keys lie off the S.S. East of it and one to the
W.S. West. The southernmost lies from Round Hill S. 30 E. by
compass 7 miles; the island itself is not above 2&frac12; miles from E. to
W., but the limits of the reef that surround it are 9 miles N. to
S. and 7 miles from E. to W.</p>
<p>"It is beautifully clothed with wood and exceeds any place I
ever saw in cocoanut trees. A great number on the east side are
without branches, and even to the leeward many of them were in the
same state. I therefore apprehend the island is subject to severe
wind storms.</p>
<p>"We had no sooner got round the north end of the island than we
observed several huts on the shore and the natives about their
canoes. As soon as we were well under the lee of the shore, they
launched through the surf and came off to us. As the 'Assistant'
was able to keep nearest the shore most of the canoes went to her.
Three came alongside of us, and I made them presents of beads and
iron work for which they gave us a few worthless spears and
breastplates. They had not a cocoanut or any article of food with
them. Some cocoanuts were, however, carried on board the
'Assistant'. They were confident of our good intentions towards
them, and instead of any look of surprise and astonishment it was
rather of complacency and admiration. They asked for Togee Nooee
which is the New Zealand word for a large hatchet--a great part of
their language was Otaheitan, yet the two Otaheitans I have with me
did not understand them so readily as did myself. On the whole I
was satisfied with my inquiries.</p>
<p>"They said that no white person had been or was on the island.
They had seen three ships or vessels. They named Britainee and
Otaheite very distinctly and spoke of a person they called
Oheedidee. They called the island Whytootackee and named
particularly 'Cornackkaiah' and 'Tongawarre' as Errees or chiefs of
the island. They have all our plants, and called the breadfruit
'cooroo' and 'pork boackah' (the latter is a Friendly Island
word).</p>
<p>"It was understood they had no hogs on shore, but I suspect they
meant to say that they were scarce and fowls were in abundance. The
scraps of cloth they brought off with them were the same sort as
the cloth of the Friendly Islands.</p>
<p>"The men were above the middle size, had very good regular
features and were fleshy--their heads were covered with strung
black hair which was very bushy, and I observed that some had their
faces smutted, the remains of it being evident about the eyebrows
and under the throat. Their dress was only a marro and the pearl
shell pendent from the neck by plaited human hair; their colour is
darker than that of an Otaheitan.</p>
<p>"They spoke of their women unbecomingly, some of them were in
the canoes that went alongside the 'Assistant'. They were tattooed
on the legs, thighs, and arms, and the legs and thighs of the men
were fully tinctured so as to lose the natural colour of the
skin.</p>
<p>"In all I observed 15 canoes, some of them might have had 20
men. I distinctly counted 15, 9, and 11 in three others. Some of
the canoes had high black feather ornaments at the stern. Within
the reef they were managed by setting poles, those that were
alongside of us were hollowed out of the trunk of the breadfruit
trees, without any scarf or piece except in the length, to increase
which they injudiciously join the ends of one piece of hollow trunk
to the end of another by sewing as it may be called without forming
a scarf to strengthen it. To make up for this weakness perhaps they
support the gunwales by long poles lashed along the edge. The
outriggers are common and like all I have seen on the larboard
side. I saw not any with sails.</p>
<p>"The dwellings or huts on the beach were only shelter for
fishermen. They were made like the common sheds at Otaheite, but I
saw some lofty houses under and among the cocoanut trees, that had
the exact form of those of the Sandwich Islands. They looked like
haystacks. I do not think we saw above 400 persons, including every
one we could discover with our glasses.</p>
<p>"It blew so violently that the natives showed some apprehension
of being drifted off the land. Notwithstanding this two men wished
to stay with us, and others gave our Otaheitan men an invitation to
go on shore for which with much incivility they laughed at them. On
my looking at a scrap of cloth that one of them had in his hand he
conceived I wanted it, and with an apology he gave it in a manner
which delighted me. 'Terah airaddee no te tye.' 'Take it, you are
welcome, but it is wet with the sea.'</p>
<p>"There was no sign of any wreck about the coast. It is clear
that the 'Pandora' was here, as I am confident of their description
of Oheedidee the Otaheitan who sailed with Captain
Edwards,<sup>*</sup> as his shallop probably made the second vessel
the native spoke of, and as to the third I fear that they allude to
my touching there in the 'Bounty,' but for this I should flatter
myself that Captain Edwards had taken her. One of the natives who
came on board had a sore throat and neck, evidently the same
disease as the Otaheitans are subject to. At 5 o'clock in the
evening I bore away in a hard gale of wind regretting very much
that I could have no further intercourse with them.</p>
<p class="note">[* Oheedidee left the "Pandora" at Huaheine and did
not come here with Captain Edwards.]</p>
<p>"Besides the breastplates and spears I got some fish hooks made
of turtle shell--the line was made of cocoa husk, also a stone edge
or Ettoey, the edge of which was circular like a gouge."</p>
<p>The following account of Wytootackee is taken from Mr. Tobin's
log:--</p>
<p>"We were off this island near a whole day. In the course of it
we were visited by three canoes containing in all about a dozen
persons. We saw numbers more within the reef that contained above
that number singly.</p>
<p>"The natives were rather cautious, in the first canoe, of
visiting us, but were soon satisfied that our intentions were
friendly.</p>
<p>"Nails and toeys were received with great satisfaction by them,
for which they exchanged their only ornament, a pearl oyster shell
hung to a collar of human hair plaited and worn about the neck.
Besides this article they disposed of some spears, the end part
jagged and formed of a hard, dark-coloured wood. Their spears, I am
inclined to think, are only used as an implement for fishing. There
was besides in one of the canoes a club not unlike (though shorter)
some we had procured at Otaheite which had been brought from
Toubouai, an island to the southward.<sup>*</sup></p>

<p class="caption">Natives of Wytootackee (Aitutaki)<br>
[<i>Drawn by Lieut. G Tobin, 1792</i>]</p>
<p>"The people were of the common height or rather above it; one
man was remarkably robust and strongly formed, in colour the same
as the Otaheitans. The hair in most of them black and worn
differently, some cropped short around the head and in others
flowing over the shoulders. All of them were tattooed, particularly
about the arms and legs, but the custom so prevalent in the Society
Islands for particularising the breech as a field for operating
does not exist at this island.</p>
<p>"There was one among the visitors whose whole body was marked
with scars which, from appearance, did not seem accidental. The
custom of raising wounds on the flesh is well known to prevail on
the east coast of New Holland. Probably it may exist at
Whytootackee. Certain it is that this man's wounds struck several
of us as being intentionally raised. Another of them had his face
daubed with red pigment.</p>
<p>"Their dress consisted of a piece of cloth fastened round the
waist and brought between the thighs, but one of them had a cloth
over his shoulders hanging down below the waist through which his
head passed exactly in the Otaheitan manner. Others wore sandals of
some kind of matting fastened about the ankles.</p>
<p>None of their beards were long; teeth very indifferent, and the
whole well supplied with vermin and dirt. All their ears were
perforated with two holes. Their language was little understood by
our Otaheitans although there was an affinity in some of their
words.</p>
<p>"As we drifted from the shore they were anxious to get away, and
on our nearing the three canoes put off, leaving two of their
countrymen on board, nor could our patroon or hand-waving bring
them back, so that we were under the necessity of making them take
the water. We were at this time 2 or 3 miles from the shore. One of
them swam lustily and gained his canoe, the other was nearly spent
when the 'Assistant' picked him up and put him on board a canoe
nearer in shore."</p>
<p>Leaving the island in hard squalls of rain on July 26th, the
ships sailed to the westward, and on August 1st, at a little after
six in the evening, the "Assistant" made the signal for seeing
land, when Savage Island was descried from the masthead W. by S. &frac12;
S., but no part of it could be seen from the deck.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh writes on Thursday, July 26th: "Just at dusk I
could see it from the fore yard, and suppose myself about seven
leagues from it. It appeared a flat surface without one rising
hill: steered to the north of it." In thick weather the "Assistant"
was sent ahead and Bligh remarks: "In 1777 I made the longitude of
the centre of Savage Island in 190' 23' E., in the 'Bounty' 190&deg;
18' E. The latitude is 19&deg; 20' S."</p>
<p>Leaving Savage Island the two ships continued to sail westward
towards the Friendly or Tonga Islands. They steered round the Vavau
Group, but unfortunately the log-books contain no chart of their
track. Bligh continues:--</p>
<p>"Thursday, August 2nd. Before I left England I was informed by
my friend, Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, that Captain Francisco Antonio
Maurelle, in a ship called 'The Princessa,' in 1781, had discovered
numerous islands between the latitude 17&deg; S. and 21&deg; S., and
between the longitudes of 182&deg; and 184&deg; E. He favoured me with a
sketch of them and some views of the land, and an extract from the
journal of the ship's track. The northernmost island, Maurelle,
lies down in a parallel with those I discovered by 2&deg; to the
eastward of them and 1&deg; to the westward of the Friendly Islands. He
called them Don Martyn Mayorga Isles.<sup>*</sup> The southern
islands he lays down south of the Mayorga, and calls them Don Jon
de Galveys Islands.<sup>**</sup> He placed them on a parallel with
the Friendly Islands but 1&deg; west of them. It is evident that their
relative position is sufficiently exact. I think, therefore, as one
group cannot be removed out of the position he has laid them in
without the other that Captain Cook's track from Tofoa to Turtle
Island, and my track in my boat prove that Maurelle's Southern
Islands and the Friendly Islands are the same, and his grand
Montagne and St. Christoval are Caow and Tofoa.<sup>***</sup> As
Mayorga according to my supposition lies on a meridian with the
northern part of the Friendly Islands, if I prove it to be so, I
shall evidently determine the rest. I therefore gave up all thought
of revisiting Annamooka in order to determine this point which is
of greater consequence, and otherwise may remain unknown for
ever.</p>

<p>"At four o'clock in the afternoon, lat. 18&deg; 42' S. and long.
187&deg; 37' E., hailed Lieutenant Portlock, the weather being very
dark and gloomy, and ordered him to lead during the night, and
steer W. &frac12; S. At midnight land<sup>*</sup> was discovered from S.W.
to W. by N., 4 leagues distant.</p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders says at daybreak this island had the
appearance of a beautiful champaign country.]</p>
<p>"Friday, August 3rd. A fine moonlight which shone through the
clouds gave us a better chance of seeing danger than if the sky had
been perfectly clear, and I therefore determined to stand on all
night.</p>
<p>"I took my track to the south of Maurelle's latitude (of the
north part of Mayorga) that I might be sure to fall in with it, and
I informed Lieutenant Portlock of my intention. We, however, saw
the land first at a tolerable distance, and having made the signal
to haul the wind and tack, we spent the night under low sail. The
day turned out very tempestuous with much rain, and except severe
cold it was as bad as any winter's day in England. In consequence I
had not as good a view of the land as I could wish.</p>
<p>"The northern part made a fair cape with a very lofty shore and
the east part had some projecting heads that looked like islands:
the southern parts were much lower. They nevertheless formed double
lands, and for that reason I believe are islands. There are two
very remarkable hills, which lie on the N.W. part of the island,
and one is a table mountain,<sup>*</sup> and the other is nearly as
high, the top of which formed like a ducal crown or rather a Scotch
bonnet. We could observe the country was abundantly clothed with
wood, and to the southward of the east cape, many cocoanut
trees.</p>
<p class="note">[* Moungalafa (Vavau Group).]</p>
<p>"The north point of the land was higher than any other, and
formed a very steep cliff although with some inclination: it was
something like Beachy Head. The verdure which clothed the cliffs
was broken in many places as if the face of the shore was sandy,
but this I attribute to the torrents of rain that fall into the
sea, for the general outline rather marked some wonderful
convulsion which has placed these islands in this immense sea.</p>
<p>"The east side of the land lies in the direction of S. 15&deg; W. by
compass. From the North Cape it inclines S. 62&deg; W. and then to
S.S.W. Round the N.W. part I could observe a small island, and an
opening in the land, and from this the land is much lower and
broken, and is the same to the southward of the east part of the
land, so that if the high land forms one island it is only about
twenty miles in circuit, whereas the whole is more than forty
miles. Nothing but extreme bad weather would have prevented me from
knowing more of it as well as two other islands which we discovered
at noon. The northernmost from the masthead appeared as two very
inconsiderable lumps of land which I believe are
connected.<sup>*</sup> The southernmost a remarkably high peaked
mountain,<sup>**</sup> the summit hid in the clouds.</p>

regularly formed. N. 29 W. 11 leagues."]</p>
<p class="note">[* Late or Lette Island, the peak is 1790 feet
high.]</p>
<p>"The distance we saw the islands proves their height must be
considerable. At noon I unexpectedly got a good latitude. As I saw
no good consequence attending my delay I directed my course to the
westward.</p>
<p>"Saturday, August 4th. Nothing could exceed the unfavourable
weather after noon. It came on thick and squally and was like a
fog. I therefore informed Lieutenant Portlock by hailing him that
after the close of the day I should keep on a wind for the night. I
had the good luck, however, to get a sight of the two islands last
discovered, which enabled me to determine their situation tolerably
exact, and the new day bringing us better weather, I had a good
sight of the south island again and excellent altitudes of the sun
to determine my longitude.</p>
<p>"How far my description of these islands will agree with the
Journal of Mr. Maurelle I cannot say, but I see no reason to doubt
of their being the same. The relative positions and latitudes agree
very nearly, and the longitude is out of the question. He has been
exact in which it is unpardonable in a navigator to neglect. I mean
his latitude. I shall not, therefore (though he seems to have been
a poor unhappy wanderer about this sea, and not unlike many of our
modern English navigators about this part of the globe), take away
the names he has given to these islands by supplanting them with
others which a new discovery would have led me to have done. The
Island of Mayorga is the first land I saw. The Mountainous Island
is the Island Late and the northernmost is Amargura.</p>
<p>"Close under Table Hill is certainly Maurelle's Port Refuge. The
north part of Mayorga is in 186&deg; 09' E. and it by me lies in 18&deg;
34&frac12;' S., by Maurelle in 18" 33' S. 183&deg; 53' E. Port
Refuge<sup>*</sup> by me is in 18&deg; 38&frac12; S. 186&deg; 14' E., by Maurelle

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER CHAPTER XI. DISCOVERY OF
FIJI OR BLIGH'S ISLANDS.</h2>
<p>Bligh, on leaving the "Tonga Islands (Vavau Group), proceeded to
Fiji, a group which had been first seen by him in his boat voyage,
and which from that time had appeared in the maps under the name of
Bligh's Islands and is so called in the log-books of Bligh and his
officers. At this point of his voyage he adopts a rather tiresome
method of naming the islands and reefs of the different groups
through which he passed by successive letters of the alphabet. The
letter names, however, were convenient for distinguishing the
different localities, and required less ingenuity than the
inventing of a number of new names. On Sunday, August 5th, to use
his own phrase, after sighting Fiji he took bearings of the land
and wrote in his diary: "My object was now to determine that
Maurelle's lands were <i>not</i> the islands that I discovered in
my last voyage to the W.N.W. of the Friendly Islands and to
determine more accurately their situation; at that time I could
only determine their boundary to enable a navigator to discover
them again, and I now steered such a course as would put it beyond
a doubt.</p>
<p>"At 11 a.m. we saw an island from the masthead S.W. by W. which
I called A. At noon I made the land, but it all at this moment
appeared new to me as may readily be conceived by those who have
read my account of 1789 with proper attention. From the
recollection I had of it, however, the Island A<sup>*</sup>
appeared to me to be the land I had passed to the southward of in
1789, although it did not agree with my latitude by a few miles, an
error that may be easily accounted for, Lat. 18&deg; 25' 52" S. 181&deg;
57' E.</p>
<p class="note">[* A is Mothe Island, and it is called Sunday
Island in Tobin's log-book. Five years afterwards, in 1797, while
voyaging to China in the ship "Duff," Wilson saw Mothe which is
surrounded by a barrier reef that encloses Karoni (the Skerries of
Wilson). He also saw Namuka (the Neat's Tongue of Wilson), Oneata,
and several other islands seen by Bligh in 1789 and 1792. Mothe,
like most, if not all, of the Fijis is known by its native name.
Wilson is often called its discoverer, yet he saw less of it than
Bligh had done.]</p>
<p>"Monday, August 6th, 1792. At 12.5 p.m. saw other land W. by S.
and W. S. W. and called it B.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* B, now Oneata, seen afterwards by Wilson.]</p>
<p>"The breakers which we saw at 1 o'clock rendered a passage
doubtful to the northward of Island B and made me steer to the S.W.
Island B is a low island with a number of hillocks. The easternmost
island is the highest and very remarkable by being detached
although connected with a reef.<sup>*</sup> Island A is a fairly
lofty island and diversified by a moderate uneven surface.</p>
<p class="note">[* 3 Loa Islet, 6 cables eastward of Oneata and
connected with it by a sunken reef. It has a sharp summit 140 feet
high, and is the Observation Islet of Wilkes.]</p>
<p>"At a quarter past 5 we were close in under Island A, and kept
on and off it all night. At sunrise bore away.</p>
<p>"At 5 o'clock, when we first came close to A, I found a
dangerous range of breakers midway between A and B where I intended
to pass.<sup>*</sup> I therefore hauled in for A and found its
north shore bold without any anchorage and its west side apparently
shut up by a reef extending to the Islands F, G, and H<sup>**</sup>
where shoals were so numerous that standing on in the night became
highly dangerous: for that reason I preferred my present
situation.</p>
<p class="note">[* Thakau Lekaleka. Bligh passed between Mothe
Island and the reef which forms the south side of Oneata
channel.]</p>
<p class="note">[** There are three well-defined reefs north-east
of Mothe: Thakau Lekaleka which is in the middle of the passage,
Thakau Vau, and Thakau Motu. F = Komo. G = Olorua. H = Thakau
Viute.]</p>
<p>"I hailed Lieutenant Portlock and told him to keep in with the
island all night (with the west end of the island bearing from S.
to S.S.E.) and we preserved this station without trouble. A canoe
came off to us with two men in her who bartered without reserve a
few cocoanuts for toweys and nails. I paid them well, and as I
expected they were off in the morning and came back with two other
men and sold us many more nuts and some spears and clubs. Two of
the men came on board and looked about them with some surprise, and
one of them had his hair plaited about four inches long on his
neck--hanging in a number of tails loaded with black grease--the
other wore it short and lime burnt. Some of them had lost both
little fingers as far as the second joint and the others only of
one hand. They had very few marks of tattooing; one of their ears
was remarkably long and had a hole in it that would have taken a
large knife for an ornament. The others were bored in the common
way: their beards were rough and untrimmed and they were dirty in
person.</p>
<p>"We could not understand them except in a few words of the
Friendly Islands language: I happened to mention Tongataboo, and
when they got hold of it I saw that they were perfectly acquainted
with that land.</p>
<p>"The canoe was the common outrigger, but it was on the starboard
side. It differed too in its form from any I have seen. It was open
about two feet wide in the middle, sharp at both ends with a prow
that curved a little. Their paddles were like those of the Friendly
Islands. As I could not delay I made sail, and they quitted us well
satisfied with what they got. The spears were those common for
striking fish, and the clubs were identically the same as those of
the Friendly Islanders one of the men wore a pretty pearl oyster
shell at his breast. I have no very favourable opinion of the
country. Around the shores were a great many cocoanut trees, and on
the hills the trees marked the strong winds from the E. and
S.E.</p>
<p>"There can be no doubt of the natives being desirous of
intercourse with us. It was remarkable their coming off in the
night. The sea appeared closed to the W. N.W. but we soon began to
discover more islands, and at noon we had them on each side. A
sailing canoe followed us for some time, but at last seeing that I
would not wait for them returned. The sail was like the Friendly
Islands sails and there was a small shed on the canoe and about
twenty men in it.</p>
<p>"The Island C<sup>*</sup> appeared the most considerable of any
we have yet seen. It may be about 4 leagues in circuit, and it is
high and diversified with hills and dales sufficiently dotted with
wood. A smaller island<sup>**</sup> lies between it and B
Island.</p>
<p class="note">[* Lakemba Island, or Laguemba, the largest island
of the Eastern Fiji Group, un which are Mount Goodenough and Kendi
Kendi.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Aiwa.]</p>
<p>"In the 'Bounty's' Launch I passed to the southward of Island
A.<sup>*</sup> then fixed its latitude to be 18&deg; 27' S. whereas I
now fix it as 18&deg; 39' S.: and my charts will give a more exact idea
of the land. Its longitude is 181&deg; 32' E. A few words I was able to
understand in the Friendly Islands language were: Heeoh, yes;
Maltow, afraid; Fockotou, to trade or barter."</p>
<p class="note">[* Bligh passed between Mothe and Namuka in the
"Bounty's" launch, see <a href="#mothe">earlier</a>.]</p>
<p>Lieutenant George Tobin describes Mothe, and he tells much the
same story as Captain Bligh, but as these descriptions of the
Fijians are the earliest in existence we quote them. "Between this
island and some breakers to the northward we kept plying the whole
night of Sunday, August 5th. We had seen a few natives on the beach
before dark and they continued making fires there as well as on the
hills all night. At 2 o'clock in the morning we were surprised with
a visit from two of them. They brought a few cocoanuts but would
not venture on board the ship. At daylight on Monday the 6th, four
more came in a canoe alongside.</p>
<p>"These people readily came on board, but exhibited great signs
of timidity and wonder at everything that caught their attention.
They brought with them cocoanuts and a few weapons which our
shipmaster, who had been in the Friendly Islands, seemed to think
were of the same kind. We soon afterwards bore up, and our visitors
paddled for the shore. In exchange for their articles we had given
them iron of different sorts, and from the avidity with which they
took it it would appear that they were not ignorant of the use of
it, which can only be accounted for by their having communication
with the Friendly Islanders or from the visit of a. European
ship.</p>
<p>"Some large sailing canoes among these islands leave no doubt
that their navigation is rather extensive.</p>
<p>"The people were about middle size, some of our gentlemen
thought them above, but we have all been led into this error from
seeing them naked. In colour they are not so red and brown as the
Otaheitans, but being a more filthy people the real cast is not to
be distinguished.</p>
<p>"Their hair is more woolly and worn different by each other, but
in none was it suffered to acquire any degree of length. One man in
the canoe was stained with a kind of pigment, nor did the custom of
shaving the hair beneath the arms prevail at the island. This
circumstance gave great offence to Mydiddee and Bobbo, and our
present visitors, as well as the Whytootakeyans, appeared inferior
to these two gentlemen.</p>
<p>"There appeared no affinity whatever in the language of Sunday
Island and Otaheite, as neither ourselves nor the Otaheitans could
glean a word from them but the word 'Tatow,' which they readily
pronounced and pointed to a few of these marks one man had on his
left heel. These were the only marks of tattooing I discovered
among them. Each man had either two joints of the right or left
little finger taken off; one man had both. The ears of all were
perforated, and in one man the lobe was slit and distended so as to
hang down as far as his chin, and was big enough to introduce an
egg through. Excepting a wrapper round the middle they were naked;
one indeed was ornamented with a breastplate of pearl oyster shell
something like but inferior to those of Whytootakee. Another had a
cowry shell hanging to his neck, and a string fastened tight round
the right arm a little above the elbow.</p>
<p>"The canoe was formed by a single piece of wood, dark coloured
and not unlike the Toa tree of Otaheite, sharp at both ends and
rising towards the head. Its length about 18 feet--its breadth one
foot and three-quarter and greatest amidships. To the outrigger
which was on the starboard side there were three projecting pieces;
it had no seats, but the people sat on the cross pieces of the
outrigger. The paddles were remarkably neat and high polished and
appeared of the same wood as the canoe; about 4 feet long. The
island is not above a league in circumference, of a moderate
height, and in all places surrounded by a reef half a mile from the
land. Could a passage be found the landing no doubt would be good,
as there are several sandy beaches. The upper grounds are bare and
boast no appearance of fertility, but near the sea we observed
cocoanuts in plenty and a great deal of the Toa tree. No huts were
observed, yet from their manufactures they cannot be destitute of
dwellings."</p>

<p>In his diary Matthew Flinders also gives us his impression of
the inhabitants of Mothe Island. "The inhabitants of A Island, who
were the only Indians (of the Fiji Group) to come to the ship, were
stout and of middling size. They were remarkable in having the
first joints of the little finger cut off, and one had lost the
second joint of one of his fingers and another the first joint on
one hand...They expressed some curiosity when they 'were shown the
breadfruit plants and some other things, and said 'Illeeboo'
signifying, I suppose, that they had such trees on shore."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. FIJI EXPLORED.</h2>
<p>Captain Bligh had now determined to explore Fiji very
thoroughly, and his log at this point becomes more than a carefully
compiled record of his observations. It enables us at a late date
to award the honour of first discovery where it is due, for
hitherto Wilson and Dumont D'Urville have both been credited with
having been the first navigators to visit islands where Bligh in
fact had preceded them.</p>
<p>The log continues: "Tuesday, August 7th. Lat. 18&deg; 16' S., Long.
180&deg; 57' 46" E. I directed my course to W.N.W. between two lofty
islands which we saw from the masthead called M and L.<sup>*</sup>
In passing island C<sup>**</sup> we saw numerous smokes and a
well-cultivated country. A sailing canoe made the utmost exertions
to overtake us, but as they were far astern and the night coming on
I could not wait for it, as I had to take a small range to be
certain of a clear space for the ships during the night. Saw
another island called N.<sup>***</sup> At 8 in the evening I was 4

N.N.W. of Island L. Here we lay to for the night.</p>

<p>"At daylight we saw other islands called P and O,<sup>*</sup>
the latter became very remarkable being like Gibraltar
Rock.<sup>**</sup> As we stood on we saw a very high island in the
north, called it R<sup>***</sup> and land to the north of it T
Island, and to the S.E. of these a small high island which was
called Q.<sup>****</sup> The land in the S.W. by W. I considered to
be the south-easternmost of the islands I discovered in the
'Bounty's' Launch, and that in the N.W. by W. to be part of the
northernmost. <i>To the eastward of our station at noon was new to
us</i>. I therefore determined to stand to the northward to see
what lands were connected with those I had passed in my boat in
1789.</p>

<p>"All the islands are high. We saw smokes on the smallest of
them, and I am confident they are well inhabited. The Island N lies
in Lat. 17&deg; 45' W.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, August 8th. As we got to the northward we saw a
shoal of keys<sup>*</sup> lying about 2 leagues to the West S.W. of
Island Q, it is probable they join with it. Q lies on a meridian
with O Island, or Gibraltar Rock, and about 9 miles from it. It is
also high and about the same size, but neither is above two miles
in circuit.</p>
<p class="note">[* Nukutolo Islets.]</p>
<p>"The land in E.N.E. at 5&deg; 20' was seen the preceding noon
bearing N.E. by N. As the wind was scant I determined not to pass
northward of Island R, as I had first intended, but to keep the
wind to the southward. R is a very high land.<sup>*</sup> I have
placed it in 17&deg; 10' S., but it was from supposed distance. The
Island S<sup>**</sup> is of good height, it is the easternmost of
the islands I passed between on May 6th, 1789; I now place it in
17&deg; 22' S. At daylight I sent for Lieutenant Portlock to give him a
few necessary directions, and having hoisted in the boat I steered
for islands in the S.W. called U<sup>***</sup> and
V.<sup>****</sup> At noon we had sight of P Island<sup>*****</sup>
seen on the morning of the 7th. V had a very fruitful appearance.
The Island U was like it, but smaller, and had a remarkable

<p>"Thursday, August 9th. Until we advanced towards the islands and
opened the channel fairly it appeared full of breakers. Besides
what were round the shores there were broken patches off the west
part of V, everywhere else the passage was fair and about 5 miles
wide. The reefs were steep too, for we could not find any bottom,
and from the extreme parts of the island they extend a long
way--about two miles.</p>
<p>"We ranged along the shore of V Island and on its west side,
open to a valley, appeared an excellent harbour or bay for
ships.<sup>*</sup> Another likely place was seen on the south side.
It was at this time nearly dark, I was therefore obliged to give up
the idea of examining these places and to get a little sea room for
the night, the land extending from W.S.W. round by North to Island
U. The most southernly land was very high and extensive, it was
called Z.<sup>**</sup> At daylight made sail to the southward, a
very high mountain to be seen on Island Z and, from its likeness to
one, was called the Cockscomb;<sup>***</sup> the whole of this
island is very mountainous, and its S.W. part terminated in a very
high cape sloping to south, an island lies to the south of it
called No. 1.<sup>****</sup> The Island Z joins or forms a part of
the largest islands of this Archipelago through which I passed in
1789.</p>

<p class="note">[**** Mbengha Island.]</p>
<p>"As land continued to present itself to the southward I
determined to sail round its southern extreme although it might
cost me a day to accomplish it.</p>
<p>"The nearer we came to the shore of Island V the more we became
delighted with the country. We sailed within a mile of the reef
which surrounds the shore. Inside the reef the water is perfectly
smooth and shoal and has some fine sandy beaches; there are some
openings in the reefs fit for boats. About the reefs we saw many
natives striking the fish and tracking the canoes about with poles.
On the shore the natives were numerous. As we sailed along they
followed us, waving pieces of white cloth. Nothing could exceed the
beauty of the country at this time. It was cultivated far up into
the mountains in a regular and pretty manner. Fine plantain walks
and shades of cocoanut and other trees near were rendered more
picturesque by the dwellings that were among them.</p>
<p>"It is an uncommon sight in this sea to see well-built villages
on an eminence, but here was a considerable one delightfully
situated on the brow of a hill amidst a charming grove of trees.
The houses were thatched all round the sides and tops with one
opening or doorway. Some of them resembled those of the Friendly
Islands with the roofs exceedingly overhanging the base, and the
sides inclined outwards so that the floor is considerably less than
the bounds of the roof. Others were like the Sandwich Island
houses. Everything seemed to show that they were an industrious and
social people.</p>
<p>"They are evidently accustomed to war, for their signals were
numerous to collect their whole forces. On an elevated hill (on the
north part of the island) where we saw a number of the natives, two
signals were made by flags hoisted to two detached cocoanut trees,
no doubt to alarm the whole island. On this hill we could observe a
well-beaten road and a single hut which I thought was for the
purpose of a watch house. They appeared very desirous to
communicate with us, and I regretted very much that the night
prevented this. Three canoes came after us, but as they were too
late in leaving the shore they failed to come up with the ships. In
the first were seven men, they were of a very dark colour, almost
black. Their heads bound round with white cloth, they had pearl
oyster shells pendent from their necks. One man stood in the bow of
the canoe holding up a club such as I got at the last island and
made signs for us to stop and trade with them. Their clothing was
the common marro--a strip of cloth round their hips.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a name="ill-13" id="ill-13"></a><img alt=""

<p class="caption">Natives of Bligh's Islands (Fiji)<br>
[<i>Drawn by Lieut. G Tobin, 1792</i>]</p>
<p>"The colour of these men must certainly have been artificial,
for in the other canoes the people were rather lighter coloured
than the Otaheitans. Their hair was bushy. These men also showed
much desire to trade with us, and held up cloth to induce us to
stop. In one of the canoes they used a large paddle to scull with,
as at Friendly Islands, and I believe we may consider them to be
the same kind of people. It appeared indifferent to them on which
side the outriggers were--as at the last island; the form of the
canoe was the same and the double canoes secured by cross pieces in
the common way. At Whytootackee I observed the natives blackened
their skins with grease and smut. Here they do the same. It is an
undoubted mark of ferocity. This Island V has about 7 leagues of
sea coast. Its north point is in 17&deg; 58' S. and Long. 179&deg; 40' E.
It was first seen on the 7th at noon S.W. by W., distant 15
leagues.</p>
<p>"The Island U is very like V, but not above half its size
although prettily diversified with high grounds and
cultivation."</p>
<p>Mr. Tobin wrote of Ngau Island in much the same strain:--</p>
<p>"In passing Island V the natives were collected on the shore
about a reef that surrounds it and on the hills in great numbers,
and seemed anxious by waving and other motions for us to land, and
most of them carried a long spear in their hands.</p>
<p>"Towards sunset their canoes put off from the shore and paddled
strenuously to overtake us, but the ship sailing at a greater rate,
we had the mortification to see them put back. The canoes appeared
the same as those at Sunday Island, but we observed that besides
the common paddling they had a method of sculling like the Chinese,
one man stands up and is constantly at work with a long narrow
paddle for the purpose. Several of them were ornamented with the
pearl oyster shell or gorget, and others wore something white on
the head like a turban. Except their other wrapper round the middle
they were quite naked. It was remarked that the natives in the one
canoe were of a much lighter colour than the others. Those on the
beach were of the same colour as the natives of Sunday Island.</p>
<p>"The island exhibits a delightful appearance, and is most
plentifully supplied with cocoanuts and plantains. It is hilly,
and, towards the summit, covered with wood. The middle hills, which
are all well cultivated, seem to be the favourite spot for the
natives to fix their habitations. We saw few single ones, but
generally seven or eight together; round the villages the ground
was cleared and regularly planted."</p>
<p>Flinders was even more enthusiastic in his praise of Ngau, and
he wrote: "This is the most beautiful island we have yet seen. We
saw a village half way up the hill surrounded with cocoanut trees
under whose shade the houses were built...We saw pieces of cloth
fixed to the trees, but whether to give alarm to the island or as a
signal I cannot tell. The people in the canoes laboured very much
to come up with us, relieving each other at the paddles and one of
them standing up to stop us, but the situation of the ship
surrounded by rocks and island was too dangerous to admit of
it...We saw them put back with the greatest regret. They had a
quantity of white cloth round their heads and some round their
waist, but otherwise were entirely naked. We saw a small bay on the
S. W. side...This island was thought worthy to be called Paradise
Island."</p>
<p>Captain Bligh continues. "Friday, August 10th. As we advanced
towards the south land<sup>*</sup> we fell in with several rocky
islets and dangerous breakers. They lie north from it about 6
leagues. As I could not weather the one or the other I tacked to
the northward and spent the night plying to windward. We saw smokes
and marks of cultivation about these small isles, and a very high
mountain<sup>**</sup> with a flat top on the western part of the
land that I had determined to go round. In the course of this day
we advanced but little, for at noon we had only made a direct
course of 7 miles so that the objects were the same but the weather
unfavourable to discern them.</p>
<p class="note">[* Kandavu.]</p>
<p class="note">[* Mt. Washington, of which the native name is
Mbuke Levu.]</p>
<p>"Saturday, August 11th. At 4 o'clock we were abreast of the
rocky islets. On the largest were several smokes and it was
prettily covered with trees. There is no passage among these isles
for vessels of any size. The ground appears very broken and perhaps
forms a ridge of breakers to the shoal to the northward of
them.</p>
<p>"Night closed upon us before we could be within a proper
distance to observe much of the land or main of these rocky keys
which we called No. 2.<sup>*</sup> It was very high and diversified
with hill and dale interspersed with trees and cultivated no doubt
equal to the other islands.</p>
<p class="note">[* 2 No. 2 is Kandavu Island and the Astrolabe
Reefs. Kandavu has two isthmuses; at Tavuku the island is nearly
divided and at Ndaku Isthmus it is only three-quarters of a mile
broad.]</p>
<p>"At daylight I no longer found any land to the southward of us,
the high flat top mountain seen yesterday was now also the west
part of the land and I steered for it. We passed the south side of
No. 2 (<i>which I suspect is three islands</i>), about 10 leagues
in extent from E.N.E. to W.S.W. The whole country was like
continental land doubling hill over hill. Moderately woody and
cultivated. Saw many smokes and cocoanut trees, but the weather was
so unfavourable that we could not observe anything with certainty.
A small high island, laying S.E. to the mountain, was well
cultivated.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Matanutu Island.]</p>
<p>I could get no observation at noon. However by the assistance of
my map I am inclined to think we were not above a mile or two wrong
in our situation.</p>
<p>"In connecting these islands I now discovered that with those
which I discovered in the 'Bounty's' Launch, they have an extent of
fully 90 leagues from E. to W. and full 53 leagues N. to S. The
N.W. and western islands are much the largest, some of them I
daresay have 20 or 30 leagues of coast. I have now opened a way to
their being regularly surveyed. If I had had a month to spare I
would have completed it myself. The difficulties I expect to meet
with in exploring my way between New Holland and New Guinea, with a
contrary monsoon advancing, call for my utmost exertions to avoid
delay."</p>
<p>Before taking his departure from Fiji, while the ships were
rounding Kandavu, Mr. Portlock wrote in the "Assistant's" log on
August 10th: "There can remain but little doubt of these islands
being the Feejee Islands that the Friendly Islanders speak so much
about, whose inhabitants they seem to fear and speak of as great
warriors who make use of poisoned arrows in battle. Tasman, it
appears (in 1643), fell in with the eastern or small cluster of
this group and gave to them the name of Prince William's Islands,
but certainly Captain Bligh is the discoverer of the Western or
large group.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Turtle Island, the southernmost of the group,
was discovered by Cook in 1773. The following is a list of islands
named by Captain Bligh: A, Mothe Island; B, Oneata; C, Lakemba; F,
Komo; G, Olorua; H, Thakau Viute (reef); L, Vanua Vatu; M, Naiau
Island; N, Thithia; O, Vatu Vara; P, Moala; Q, Yathata; R and T,
Parts of Taviuni; S, Koro; U, Nairai; V, Ngau; W, Mbatiki; X,
Wakaya; Y, Ovalau; Z, Viti Levu; No. 1, Mbengha; No. 2, Kandavu and
the Astrolabe Reefs.]</p>
<p>"They are altogether, and are a prodigious fine group of
islands, and their inhabitants very much resemble the Friendly
Islanders in person and manners. Those that were off to the
'Providence' had joints out from the little finger and their hair
stained with clay or lime exactly as those islanders do."</p>
<p>These words of Portlock, written while he was on board the
"Assistant" in Fiji, having just led the "Providence" through the
very centre of the group, assume a curious importance to-day, when
historians are endeavouring to decide to whom belongs the honour of
their discovery. Bligh's track and his chart of his second voyage
are little known in connection with the early exploration of Fiji,
and it is strange that the chart has received so little notice.</p>
<p>It is true that twenty-two years after Bligh's return Arrowsmith
included the course of the "Providence" in a combined chart of Fiji
"constructed from original documents," in 1814 which is now at the
Admiralty,<sup>*</sup> but the track is very incorrectly laid down,
and it must have been drawn without reference to Bligh's original
chart. On Arrowsmith's chart the ships are not shown to have come
to Mothe Island at all, yet as has been told above Captain Bligh
kept in touch with the island all night and was visited by the
natives. Again the course as drawn by Arrowsmith, instead of
showing that the vessels passed between Ngau and Nairai Islands,
runs away to the southward of both these islands. There are also
some small islands placed S.W. of Kandavu on Arrowsmith's chart
where none exist on Bligh's. On Arrowsmith's chart, too, Kandavu
(part of Bligh's No. 2) bears the name of Mywolla, and as a result
Admiral Erskine in his <i>Western Pacific Directory</i> writes:
"D'Urville sought Kandavu as being Mywolla discovered by Bligh in
his second voyage in 1792, but it would certainly seem that Mywolla
is the same as Mouala to the E.N.E., and that Bligh passed between
Totowa and Matougou (Totoya and Matuku) <i>because there are no
islands to the S.W. of Kandavu as marked on Bligh's
Chart</i>,<sup>**</sup> and the distance, bearings, and drawings
are so bad in Bligh's track that the discrepancies are not too
great for such an assumption".<sup>***</sup> Admiral Erskine is
right in thinking that Mywolla is the same as Moala (P island twice
seen by Bligh), but he is mistaken in surmising that Bligh passed
between Totoya and Matuku, for we know that the ships steered
between Ngau and Nairai (U and V Islands).</p>
<p class="note">[* A chart of Fiji was made in 1808, which does not
differ from that made in 1814. There is not, however, a copy of the
earlier one at the Admiralty.]</p>
<p class="note">[** On Bligh's original chart there are no islands
S.W. of Kandavu.]</p>

<p class="caption">Part of the Fiji Islands to show Captain Bligh's
Track in 1792</p>
<p>The Cockscomb Mountain on Viti Levu and some of Bligh's Islands
may not be quite correctly in position in his chart, but his track
can be easily followed and his islands identified without
difficulty, the chart being quite as accurate as those recording
new discoveries usually are. In passing between U and V Islands
Captain Bligh gives us the latitude and longitude of U or Nairai
Island as being in 17&deg; 53' S. and 179&deg; 49' E. Its true latitude and
longitude are 17&deg; 48' S. and 179&deg; 23' E. It is evident that Admiral
Erskine was writing about the combined chart by Arrowsmith on which
islands are placed in that situation, and that he had not seen the
original chart drawn and signed by Captain Bligh, on which no
islands appear. On Arrowsmith's chart, too, the name Mywolla is
given to Kandavu and no doubt this chart misled Admiral Erskine,
but there is no reason to attribute the error to Captain Bligh. He
has placed the islands where he saw them, named only by letters of
the alphabet, and unless the natives of Mothe pointed out to him
the direction of Moala and named it to him he could not have known
it by that name. If they did so, he has made no mention of it in
his log.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. THE NEW
HEBRIDES.</h2>
<p>On Saturday, August 11th, the two ships left Fiji and made all
sail towards the New Hebrides. For seven days they kept on their
course to the north-west in variable weather with alternate days of
sunshine to temper days of intense gloom, of tropical haze and of
showers of rain. At 2 p.m. on the 14th, Captain Bligh sent a boat
to the "Assistant" with an invitation to Lieutenant Portlock to
dine, which he accepted, returning on board his ship again at 7
p.m. Bligh often summoned the "Assistant's" commander in order to
discuss the route the vessels were taking and other details
concerning the voyage, throughout which the "Assistant" (as it will
have been noticed) almost invariably led the "Providence". In
Lieutenant Portlock's log he tells us that it was his custom on
first coining on board the "Providence" to take a survey of the
ship's situation from her masthead.</p>
<p>On August 19th the "Assistant" made the signal for seeing land.
It lay to the south-west and proved to be one of the Banks Group,
which had been seen by the "Bounty's" launch on May 14th, 1789,
when on the way from Tofua to Timor.</p>
<p>The Banks Group is included in the New Hebrides, which consist
of about forty islands in all. Ouiros in 1606 discovered Tierra del
Espiritu Santo, south of Banks Islands, which he supposed to be
part of the continent. Bougainville in 1768 found that it was not
so when he passed to the southward of any land seen at that date,
discovering Aragh, Marwo, and Aoba Islands. He thus satisfied
himself that the continent of Quiros was a group of islands, upon
which he bestowed the name of Cyclades. Cook in 1774 discovered and
charted other islands to the south and named them the New Hebrides,
a title since applied to the whole group.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh thought that he had made a new discovery. Quiros
and Torres, however, had not only seen the Banks Group, but had
called Vanua-Lava Island "Portales de Belen," Mota Island "Las
Lagrimas da San Pedro," Gaua "La Virgen Maria," and Ureparapara
"Pilar de Zaragoza". Little was really known of the Banks Group for
many years afterwards, and even in 1838, when D'Urville came there,
he found navigation difficult owing to the lack of knowledge
concerning it.</p>
<p>The Torres Group, also part of the New Hebrides, lies slightly
to the north-west, and Captain Bligh, after passing round the
northernmost islands of the Banks Group, took the "Providence" and
"Assistant" past the southern extreme of the Torres Group, which
again, as its name denotes, forms part of Torres' discoveries in
1606. It is composed of Hiu or North Island, Tegua or Middle
Island, Lo or Saddle Island, and Tog or South Island.</p>
<p>On Sunday, August 19th, Bligh writes of the Banks Group in his
log: "In pursuance of my plan to verify my observations made during
my distressing voyage in the 'Bounty's' Launch, I directed my
course to make the islands<sup>*</sup> I had then discovered to the
northward of the New Hebrides.</p>
<p class="note">[* Banks Islands.]</p>
<p>"We saw them soon after 1 o'clock, but our situation was farther
to the northward than I had intended, and being out of the point of
view I saw them before, they had not the same appearance. The
sugar-loaf peaked island, as I then called it, was very different.
It had only a peaked hill on its eastern part joined by land which
scarcely made it remarkable but for its situation and small size
although high. It was now called Island A.<sup>*</sup> Island
B<sup>**</sup> is higher, and forms with three hills a mountainous
body of land with a low border of land round it which has a cliff
shore. They bear S. &frac12; E. and N. W. by compass from each other, and
lie off the coast of the largest island of this group.</p>
<p class="note">[* A, Mota Island.]</p>
<p class="note">[** B is Valua Island, situated S miles N. of Mota
Island.]</p>
<p>"I was certain of my situation by the North Rocks, and I spent
the night plying to windward that I might get a better view of the
land in the morning as well as to prevent accident to the
ships.</p>
<p>"At daylight I stood round Island B, to the S.V. of which we saw
the largest Island called C<sup>*</sup> towering in the clouds, the
summits of its high mountains hid or at times but partially seen.
My views of it will give a just idea of it, and its size
sufficiently marks it out from all the rest. Between B, C, and D we
observed two low isles or keys, and some broken ground which was
thought to join to C<sup>**</sup> and make that pass dangerous--it
therefore induced me to pursue my old track round the Island
D.<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* C, or Vanua Lava, is the largest island of the
Banks Group. A volcanic mountain range attaining a height of
upwards of 3000 feet runs nearly throughout its whole length.]</p>
<p class="note">[** They in fact form a separate reef.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** D, Ureparapara or Bligh Island.]</p>
<p>"We passed near to Island B. It has a rocky shore, and I believe
steep too, for we could get no bottom. It is covered with wood
without any cleared ground: cocoanut trees grow luxuriantly, and
raise their heads conspicuously above the rest. I saw only one
smoke and not a single habitation. Some trees looked like
breadfruit, but I saw no plantain trees. It has a remarkable hill
on its west side that opened with other high land at S. 34&deg; W. This
island is about 6 or 7 leagues round.</p>
<p>"Upon the north rocks<sup>*</sup> which I now called the
Bounty's Launch' we saw through our glasses some trees, and the
land is of tolerable height for we saw it at 7 leagues distant. It
lies N.N.W. nearly by compass 22 miles from B Island, and is in the
latitude of 13&deg; 17' S., longitude by time-keepers 167&deg; 42' E.</p>
<p class="note">[* The North Rocks are now known as Vatganai. They
consist of two rocks about 250 feet high.]</p>
<p>"I steered close in with Island D to take a look at the bay I
had described in my last voyage.<sup>*</sup> It is a remarkable
island from the formation of this bay which occupies a large
circular space in the middle of it, surrounded by a continuous
ridge of mountains that incline rapidly to the waterside. I could
get no ground off this place, and think the water is extremely deep
close to the shore: the points of the bay lie S. 20&deg; E. and N. 20&deg;
W. from each other, about one mile apart, but whatever anchorage a
ship may find in it, I am afraid she cannot get shelter from the
wind at the N.E., in other respects it may answer. At the bottom of
the bay there appeared some sandy beaches, and we saw the same
round the north part of the island, but as they were bounded by a
rocky shore it is probably a deep anchorage.</p>
<p class="note">[* The name of this bay is Dives Bay; it is 2 miles
in length by two-thirds of a mile in breadth.]</p>
<p>"The whole country has an entire covering of wood without a
single cultivated spot. Clumps of cocoanut trees were uncommonly
numerous about the hills. Around the sea-shore we saw only a few
natives, but as we passed the bay we saw a large body collected in
the inner part of it drawn up in some order as if with a design to
prevent our landing. We observed some natives on the sea-shore who
had cloth over their shoulders like the Otaheitans. We saw no
habitations.</p>
<p>"Island D may be about a dozen miles round or more. Its latitude
is 13&deg; 34' S. and longitude 167&deg; 25' E. and lies S. 32&deg; W. by
compass, 7 leagues from the 'Bounty's Launch' Island.</p>
<p>"I have forgotten to say that in passing the low keys we saw a
few natives with a canoe.<sup>*</sup> The sail was similar to those
of the Friendly Islands. At noon I directed my course towards the
westernmost of the islands<sup>**</sup> of this group which I
discovered in my last voyage.</p>
<p class="note">[* This would be off Vanua Lava.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Torres Group.]</p>
<p>"Monday, August 20th. As I expected, we saw the land about 2
o'clock: this was the same island I had discovered in the
'Bounty's' Launch, and what was new to me two other islands lying
to the W.N.W. of it. They were called E, F, and G;<sup>*</sup> are
of good height, woody, and similar to the islands we had passed.
The Island E, I believe, is the largest of the three and about 3
leagues in circuit.</p>
<p class="note">[* E, Tog or South Island; F, Lo or Saddle Island;

covered with wood. We thought we saw cocoanuts at the summit of the
mountains which were very high. Island C is by far the largest; we
saw no signs of inhabitants on it, but on its northernmost key,
which we suspect is joined to the island by a reef, we saw a canoe
with a triangular sail like those of Bligh's Islands,<sup>*</sup>
with several Indians in her. Island D, we saw no reef round this
island and no doubt the bay is accessible. We saw a great body of
natives at the bottom of the bay, and several smokes in different
parts of the island which is covered with wood. There is very
little low land, the mountain descending to the water's edge. We
saw no inhabitants on E and F."</p>

<p class="caption">A Chart of the Islands North of the New Hebrides
(Banks Islands)</p>
<p>Captain Bligh left the New Hebrides on August 20th, and sailed
towards the southern shores of New Guinea having fine weather with
"a prodigious thick haze" for several days; there were fortunately
bright intervals which enabled him to get some good observation by
which he found "the mean of the time-keepers to differ only 7
miles".</p>
<p>The ships were now approaching the dangerous labyrinth of coral
reefs which surround the entrance to Torres Strait, and upon one of
which Captain Edwards had lately been wrecked. By August 25th they
were nearly on a meridian with Cape Deliverance, the easternmost
extreme of the Louisiade Archipelago.</p>
<p>On August 28th, as they were advancing toward the southern coast
of New Guinea, and keeping a sharp watch for land, Lieutenant
Portlock tells us that the midshipman who had the lookout at the
"Assistant's" masthead cried out that land was in sight. He
immediately went up, and found out what the midshipman had supposed
to be land was a very large and most beautiful waterspout which
proceeded from a small black cloud some 15&deg; from the horizon. It
ran in a zig-zag manner frequently altering in size and shape until
within 5&deg; of the horizon, and there it was joined by a large column
of water the size of a church tower. This was much agitated and
frequently moved its position, being surrounded with a dense mist
"from the force with which it was either ascending or
descending".</p>
<p>From the ships the waterspout was clearly seen for the space of
half an hour. This was in 11&deg; 36' S. On the same day the ships came
on a meridian with Culde-Sac of Bougainville. Two days later early
in the morning New Guinea was sighted. A haze concealed its shores
although a bluff point could be discerned in the N.E., and a little
later some mountains were visible. Evidently one of these was Mount
Clarence as the ships made the land in the neighbourhood of Cape
Rodney. From the bluff point the coast-line appeared to fall back
to the northward, and as the ships steered to the W.N.W. they soon
lost sight of the mountains. The land looked moderately high and
well wooded, but Captain Bligh says that "its form was too
indistinct" for him to give a sketch of it. We are indebted to
Matthew Flinders for a drawing of the coast-line seen. In his work
<i>Terra Australis</i><sup>*</sup> he incorporates Bligh's chart of
Torres Strait with other authorities, and in addition to giving
Cape Rodney and the position of the land he also shows the trend of
the mountain range which was seen by the "Providence".</p>
<p class="note">[* Atlas, Plate XIII.]</p>
<p>On the following day--the 29th--during the forenoon, a white
studding-sail boom, or something that exactly resembled it, floated
past the "Assistant". The master saw it and said nothing about it
until later in the day when Mr. Portlock, who seems to have been
vexed at hearing the news so late writes: "It was great neglect of
duty his not mentioning the matter as I had given orders that when
leaves or rockweed or anything drifting was seen, I might be
acquainted of it. If I had known that it really was a studding-sail
boom, or any ship's spar, I most certainly would have hoist a boat
out and picked it up," and he adds, "my alarm would have certainly
been for Mr. P&eacute;rouse who is missing and who I understand had orders
to visit these seas and explore the coasts of these islands".</p>
<p>M. de la P&eacute;rouse, although Portlock did not know it, had been
lost with his ships close to the islands Bligh had last examined.
Portlock's conjecture that the spar belonged to his ships was not
an impossible one, and at the time that he wrote of P&eacute;rouse there
were actually survivors of the French expedition still living and
hoping to be rescued. Jean Francois de Galaup, Comte de la P&eacute;rouse,
the ill-fated French commander, had left New South Wales four years
before, in March, 1788, with his frigates "La Boussole" and
"L'Astrolabe". Both ships were wrecked a few months later off
Vanikoro, one of the Santa Cruz Group, which lies to the north of
the Torres Group. For years nothing was heard of them.
D'Entrecasteaux searched in vain for traces of the expedition
although he also passed close to Vanikoro.</p>
<p>In 1826 Peter Dillon, captain of a trader, called at Tucopia to
ascertain the fate of some persons he had left there in 1813. He
found them living, and in the possession of one of them was a sword
hilt of French manufacture which the natives said had come from
Vanikoro where, long since, two large ships had been lost. During
the night they were overtaken by a hurricane; one ship had
foundered, the other was swept high upon the reef surrounding the
island. Unfortunately Dillon found it impossible to call there
then, but on his return to Calcutta he successfully petitioned the
East India Company to equip an expedition and allow him to go in
search of La P&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p>A ship named the "Research" was fitted out and he left India in
January, 1827. Calling first at Tucopia he proceeded to Vanikoro,
where he heard from the natives, as he had already been told by the
Tucopians, that one of the ships had gone down at some distance
from the reef at a place called Wanau. The Tucopians had said that
the unfortunate survivors on reaching the shore had been
immediately killed by the natives who believed that the white men
were "ship spirits" and had since placed their skulls in their
spirit house. Dillon was unable to find out whether this story was
true, and the natives of Vanikoro denied that they had killed the
men.</p>
<p>The second ship had remained fast on the reef opposite Payau,
and those who were saved being able to conciliate the natives were
permitted to remain there. Later they built a two-masted vessel,
and in it sailed from the island but were never heard of again. Two
men only stayed behind, one of whom was dead,<sup>*</sup> while the
other had left Vanikoro with a native chief some time before
Dillon's arrival. One of Dillon's officers visited the clearing on
the west bank of a river that the Frenchmen had made, and where
they had entrenched themselves with wooden palisades. A number of
articles were brought away by him including parts of anchors, brass
guns, and ringbolts, a silver spoon with the letter P. and the
fleur-de-lys engraved plainly upon it, and a bell with the maker's
name, "Bazin m'a fait". These articles on being sent to France were
identified as belonging to La P&eacute;rouse's expedition, and were
deposited in the naval museum at the Louvre.</p>
<p class="note">[* This man is said to have died only three years
before Dillon's visit.]</p>
<p>In 1829 Captain Dillon was presented to the French king, Charles
X, who conferred on him the Order of the Legion of Honour. Dumont
D'Urville in 1828 made a thorough examination of Vanikoro and set
up a monument there in memory of his unfortunate countrymen; and
the younger Bougainville, in 1825, when visiting Australia, had
erected one in New South Wales where a beautiful suburb of Sydney
is to-day known by the name of La P&eacute;rouse.</p>
<p>Captain Bligh continues: "Saturday, August 25th, I am now on a
meridian nearly with Cape Deliverance<sup>*</sup> allowing it 154'
37' E., and as it is in 11&deg; 45' S. our distance from it is 94
miles.</p>
<p class="note">[* So called by Bougainville, the French navigator,
who, on his return to Europe in 1769, first told of the existence
of land in these waters, and is generally known as the discoverer
of the Louisiade Archipelago.]</p>
<p>"Tuesday, August 28th. I am nearly on a meridian with the
Cul-de-Sac. 'Assistant' ahead on the lookout.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, August 29th. Fair weather, extremely hazy. Got the
large cutter out and stowed her on skids on the gunwales, so I now
had four boats ready for an emergency.</p>
<p>"Thursday, August 30th. Fine night, with lightning on the N.E.
At half past 5 I saw the coast of New Guinea from the deck, from
N.N.E. &frac12; E. to N.E. &frac12;, 12 leagues distant from the masthead.</p>
<p>"Remarks on this day. As I intended, we fell in the most western
parts of Mr. Bougainville's discovery. My longitude shows it to be
westward of any part he saw, but we may readily attribute the
difference to an error on his side owing to the unfavourable
weather he had. It was at a distance of at least 12 leagues, for
with my best glasses before the sun rose and a clear horizon I
could discover nothing but its form which was too indistinct to
give a sketch of. Notwithstanding, to give an idea of the height it
was 15 feet above the horizon and formed in hills and dales and may
be therefore considered to be a highland.</p>
<p>"Fixing the land at 12 leagues bearing N.E. by true compass, its
situation will be 9&deg; 38' S., Long. 147&deg; 16' E. by time-keepers
which, 14 being added for their error, becomes 147&deg; 30' E. The west
part that Mr. Bougainville saw is computed by a late publication to
be in Lat. 10&deg; 00' S. and 148&deg; 40' E.</p>
<p>"Friday, August 31st. My being so late in the season and a great
probability of my meeting with delays in passing between New
Holland and New Guinea is the cause of my running on in the night.
Since the 23rd, the boobies and noddies that we have seen daily are
indubitable proof of our passing dangers. This track should be
taken with great caution, and I recommend whoever may follow me,
not to run in the night but to keep the ship on a wind under such
sail as will render her manageable. I am in good time to save the
monsoon to Timor provided my route is clear. The weather is fine. I
depend on clearing any danger, and Lieutenant Portlock has his
orders to keep ahead. This is a double security, as his vessel is
as manageable as a boat. Fine weather but extremely hazy, so that 5
or 6 leagues is the utmost we can see. My last Lat. observed 9&deg; 25'
S. 145&deg; 23' E.</p>
<p>"Saturday, September 1st. The 'Assistant' being on the lookout
made a signal for danger and tacked towards us. I found it to be a
dangerous shoal 3 miles from us.<sup>*</sup> Happily we saw it
before night. No land could be seen near those dreadful breakers,
but boobies and noddies in abundance.</p>
<p class="note">[* This shoal was named Portlock's Reef, in honour
of Mr. Portlock.]</p>
<p>"I hailed Lieutenant Portlock to keep the wind for the night,
which we passed without any trouble. At sunrise, for until then the
weather was so hazy we could not distinguish the colour of the
water, we bore away and I ordered the 'Assistant' to lead. A 7
o'clock we saw the shoal bearing west and west-north-west and,
supposing it to be a small spot, we steered to go southwards of it,
but to my surprise, as we advanced, found the breakers inclined
more and more to the south and we were obliged to keep our wind. At
a quarter past ten tacked as a stream set us fast to the breakers,
and there was no possibility to weather them provided the end
terminated where we saw it. What I shall prove this shoal to be, I
hope will soon be determined. It gives a horrible picture of the
navigation of this unknown strait.</p>
<p>"Sunday, September 2nd. Towards evening we saw the termination
of the breakers to the northward, but as we had reason to suppose
the sea full of dangers from the many noddies and boobies about us,
I ordered Lieutenant Portlock to keep on the wind for the
night.</p>
<p>"At 4 in the morning we supposed ourselves 6 miles from the
shoal. We were only too apparently set to the southward by a stream
of the tide.</p>
<p>"As soon as we could see about us we bore away with, to all
appearances, a clear sea, but at noon we were obliged to haul the
wind. Boobies and noddies and a large trunk of a tree near us, the
latter covered with barnacles. The breakers were tremendous and the
wind increased to a gale. The 'Assistant,' on the lookout,
signalled to steer to the southward; under double reef we kept
close to the wind for I conceived we could be but a few leagues
from the south part of New Guinea. The horizon is hazy, and if the
coast is low that will account for our not seeing it, but at noon I
do not think we could have seen land above 5 leagues distant.
Perhaps the south part of the coast may extend as far south as we
are...and the shoals may be a barrier of reefs round the coast
which we must break through as well as we can. Had I a month to
spare it would be of no consequence to the plants.</p>
<p>"The north part of the shoals<sup>*</sup> lie nearly E. and W.,
40 miles in Lat. 9&deg; 26' S. and the north part is in 144&deg; 54'
east."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. TORRES
STRAIT--BLIGH'S ENTRANCE.</h2>
<p>Captain Bligh, proceeding with great caution among the sunken
reefs and clusters of rocks lying off the Barrier Reef, now brought
his ships to the entrance into Torres Strait which ever since his
day has been known by the name of Bligh Entrance.<sup>*</sup> It is
a clear space 18 miles broad with regular soundings between Anchor
and Bramble Cays, and it is the best approach to the Great
North-east Channel from the Coral Sea. Anchor Cay, which bears the
name Bligh gave it, is the northern extreme of the Great Barrier
Reef.</p>
<p class="note">[* It was so named by Bligh.]</p>
<p>The log continues:--</p>
<p>"Monday, September 3rd. As we advanced southward we saw a sandy
key in the S.W. 2 leagues distant; this I conceived to be connected
with what we saw the preceding noon; it was therefore extremely
hazardous to move before dark...I stood to the north and spent the
night in short tacks. In the morning I directed the 'Assistant' to
lead to the north-west in hopes of determining something about the
land. Towards noon we were again retarded by breakers about 10
miles in extent lying from W.N.W. to north in 9&deg; S. and long. 144&deg;
I o' E. A dangerous reef was seen from the lower yard: towards this
shoal we had very bad soundings of coral bottom.<sup>*</sup> I
could see no land. The 'Assistant' was on the lookout with boats
ahead sounding.</p>
<p class="note">[* This reef was called Bond's Reef by Bligh in
honour of Lieutenant Bond.]</p>
<p>"Tuesday, September 4th. The shoal we met with lay to the
northward, and soon after noon seeing a lump of highland in the
S.W. called Island A<sup>*</sup> made it doubtful to me whether I
was far enough south to go round the land. I thought best,
therefore, to stand to the southward. In doing this I found better
bottom and discovered a sandy key with reefs about. The night
coming on made it necessary for me to anchor. I called this place
Anchor Key, and came to near it with small bower in 37 fms. in 9&deg;
19' S. 144&deg; 11' E. Island A, S.W. by W., 10 leagues.</p>
<p class="note">[* Captain Bligh afterwards named it Darnley Island
(Errub). Excepting Murray Islands, the islands identified in the
footnotes were named by Bligh.]</p>
<p>"In the morning we got under sail, and with caution proceeded to
the S.S. West; about ten o'clock we saw more land, high like the
first in the south, called it B.<sup>*</sup> Soon after found a
sandy key upon the whole tolerably good ground. It appeared to me
most eligible to go to the southward of Island A. Island A may be 4
or 6 miles round, it rises from each end to the centre to a good
height. It is interspersed with trees, but is not a very fertile
looking island, and in some places it seemed scorched up. We,
however, saw some cocoanut trees, and canoes were seen from the
masthead.</p>
<p class="note">[* This was one of Murray Islands which were
discovered and named by Captain Edwards in 1991.]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, September 5th. Soon after noon shoal'd the water
along the shoal lying to the eastward of Island A, and the boats
sounding to leeward had only 12 fms. About 1 o'clock we found we
were standing towards a sandy key that extends towards the Islands
B and C<sup>*</sup> in the south-east; and we saw white water
southward of Island A. At 4 o'clock I came to an anchor and sent
the third lieutenant in a boat and Mr. Nichols, master, in another
to examine the passage to the leeward. Night only permitted them to
go as far as the key where they found sufficient depth of water. I
ordered everything to be ready for them to proceed in the morning.
At daylight they were down at the key (called it Canoe
Key<sup>*</sup>) and were on their return towards noon where the
master, by having the best rowing boat, got first on board. We
observed Lieutenant Tobin make signals for assistance. I judged his
people were fatigued and sent fresh hands to him in the
pinnace.</p>
<p class="note">[* C is also one of Murray Islands.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Canoe Cay, still called by this name, is a
sand-bank 7 miles from Darnley Island.]</p>
<p>"We have seen several large canoes with oblong sails fishing
about the shoals. All this day the haze was great, but Island B
appeared as large as A. Its western part forms a hill.<sup>*</sup>
C island lies 2 miles westward of it, a small high round lump of
land, and between the two a small low island or key.' The whole are
wooded like A. During the forenoon we observed Canoe Key to cover
with the tide.</p>
<p class="note">[* B Island is Maer Island, the largest of the
Murray Islands. The hill seen is 750 feet in height.]</p>
<p class="note">[* C Island is Dowar Island, and the small low
island seen was Wyer Island, also of the Murray Group.]</p>
<p>"Thursday, September 6th. At 1, Mr. Tobin returned, both his and
the Master's report was they had found a deep water channel but
narrow. It was too late to risk going down lest we should not have
time to get into good anchoring ground for the night. I was
therefore obliged to remain there. Mr. Tobin informed me he was
overtaken by a canoe 50 feet long with 15 men in her. When about 15
yards from him they offered him a cocoanut which he refused, making
signals to them to proceed to the ship. Upon this they immediately
got their bows ready and he saw that it was their intention to send
some arrows at him. In self defence, therefore, he was obliged to
fire at them, and no doubt did some mischief as the poor wretches
immediately quitted them. This was the most melancholy account I
have received.</p>
<p>"All my hopes to have a friendly intercourse with the natives
were now lost."</p>
<p>Flinders the midshipman was also watching Tobin's signals, and
he gives a more detailed narrative of what took place:--</p>
<p>"When the cutter returned, Mr. Tobin informed us that he had had
a skirmish with the Indians. At first on seeing four large canoes
coming towards him he made a signal to the whale-boat to come to
assist him but she either did, or would, not see it and returned on
board. When Mr. Tobin saw himself thus situated he loaded all the
musquets, which amounted to seven besides his own, and made the
signal to the 'Providence' for assistance. One of the canoes
presently came up very fast, in which were about nine Indians,
quite black and stark naked, who at first made apparently peaceable
signs and held out a green cocoanut to him. The signs he imitated
as well as he could, but did not think it prudent to take the
cocoanut and continued to pull for the ship, whereupon a man who
was sitting upon the top of a house in the centre of the canoe, and
who appeared to be the chief, said something to his fellows and
immediately they were handed up a great number of bows and arrows
which they began to string with great expedition; two of them had
drawn out their arrows ready to let fly when Mr. Tobin conceived it
his duty to fire in his own defence and discharged six pieces among
them. They all fell flat in the bottom of the canoe in the greatest
consternation except the chief who was still sitting upon the
house. This man the cockswain, immediately the smoke had a little
dispersed, fired at, and brought him down thinking he had done a
meritorious action. During this time the canoe dropped astern and,
the three others having joined her, presently they were seen coming
together very fast, no doubt still determined to cut the cutter
off, when fortunately the pinnace came to her assistance and they
set their sails and made sail to Island A.</p>
<p>"No boat could have been manoeuvred better in working to
windward than were these long canoes by the naked savages. The
lieutenant did not fire before it was absolutely necessary, and
notwithstanding his superiority of arms he would have been able to
make only a poor defence against 15 men, for the canoe contained
that number, six of them being below in the house when they first
came up."</p>
<p>Captain Bligh continues: "Thursday, September 6th. At sunrise we
weighed and sailed under 3 reefs. The 'Assistant' and boats ahead
and hands at the masthead conning the ship, we ran between Canoe
Key and the reef off A Island where it was &frac12; a mile wide with 21
fms. and steered to N.W., and anchored in 13 fms., a fine sand and
clay bottom. I was afraid to go in farther lest the anchoring
ground might be lost before I could explore with the 'Assistant'
and my boats. In the afternoon the sun's rays do not refract the
shoals and show them as in the morning. At &frac12; past 11 the
'Assistant' weighed to explore.</p>
<p>"Island A is prettily interspersed with trees, among which are
the cocoanut and plantain, and has clear patches; but they are
burnt up, and the most luxuriant trees have a poor verdure. We saw
several canoes and about too natives on the sandy beaches. I could
observe some of their dwellings which appeared neatly thatched and
fenced round; the canoes looked long and low and about 12 were
seen. By my map Island A lies in 9&deg; 34' S. and 143&deg; 45'
E.<sup>*</sup> No wind could send any sea into this anchorage
except from the north and it could not endanger a ship riding here.
If Island A produces water, and a good footing with the natives
could be gained, it would be an eligible place to refresh at.</p>
<p class="note">[* Its highest part, a peak, is in 9&deg; 35' 20" S.
and long. 143&deg; 45' E.]</p>
<p>"The passage in from Canoe Key is perfectly safe...when abreast
of A's sandy key<sup>*</sup> the passage is about 3 miles wide and
fine anchoring ground. How far the reefs extend to the N.N.E. of
Island A is uncertain. If they do not connect with the North Reef
the passage over them is likely to be dangerous for in that part we
saw no land. Some sandy keys lie in the north-west so I determined
to proceed to the northward around two woody keys or isles called E
and F.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Clifton's Cay.]</p>
<p class="note">[** E is Nepean Island (Attagoy). F is Stephen
Island (Hogar). Nepean Island was named by Bligh, and a key to the
south of it called Tobin's Key.]</p>
<p>"As our anchoring depended on our caution I sent Lieutenant
Portlock to weigh again with the boats and explore the passage
between Islands A and E.<sup>*</sup> While the 'Assistant' was at
anchor several canoes went alongside of her and traded with their
bows and arrows for iron of any kind.<sup>**</sup> They took care
to make good bargains, but we were honest and readily gave what was
agreed upon. On account of these canoes being about us I could not
send my boats away without the 'Assistant,' otherwise I might have
accomplished a sufficient survey of the passage with them
alone.</p>

<p class="caption">A Survey of the Straits between New Holland and
New Guinea (Torres Strait)</p>
<p>"These people expressed a great deal of surprise at seeing the
ships...were perfectly acquainted with the use and value of iron
and called it touree or tourick. Their war implements were all they
had to trade except a few plantains and a yarn or two. There were
15 in each canoe and Lieutenant Portlock made signs to them to come
to me, but only one showed inclination to separate from the rest
and come towards the ship. The readiness with which these people go
on board the 'Assistant' makes me hope no injury was done them
yesterday.</p>
<p>"Friday, September 7th. At noon the 'Assistant' and boats were
under sail about 5 miles from us exploring the passage between A
and E. It is impossible to foresee what delays may attend me in
this strait, want of water may not be the least of our
difficulties. At 1 o'clock a canoe came alongside with 10 men in
her, but as the 'Assistant' made the signal for us to follow her,
they had not time to come on board. The men in her expressed much
surprise at our getting under way and appeared much mortified, for
they had been in the 'Assistant' and traded there with fairness.
Mr. Tobin's battle seems to have been of no consequence. We found
difficulty in weighing anchor, the ground was so good. At &frac12; past 3
anchored for the night under F Island.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "The ships were sheltered by two western islands
named Stephen's and Campbell's Islands."--Flinders.]</p>
<p>"We saw some natives on Island F, one being a woman who had some
covering round her hips and had a dog with her; the houses on this
island were noticed to be well thatched within the fences. It is a
small woody spot about 1&frac12; or 2 miles round. 9&deg; 32' S. 143&deg; 39'
E.</p>
<p>Saw another island called G<sup>*</sup> S. 5&deg; W. 2 or 3 miles,
and here the canoes which we had left behind came to the ship again
and traded with their bows and arrows, clubs and spears very fairly
for large nails and hatchets which they also called toorick. Three
came on board who showed great surprise, but they could not be
enticed below. They are of middle size, quite black and woolly
headed, with beards. Some of them had lost their teeth and some had
their foreheads daubed with red: some had a few feathers stuck in
their wool, and others had the skin on their shoulders raised in
circular rims that together formed a kind of badge about the size
of a waterman's. Their noses were very full at the point, and the
septum had been pierced in which they wore a ring of shell or bone
to distend it. Their ears were also pierced, being sometimes cut
through and sometimes full of small holes into which were thrust
ornaments of plaited grass or shell. Some of the natives appeared
aged and their rough beards were tinged with grey.</p>
<p class="note">[* Campbell Island (Tappoear).]</p>
<p>"On the whole the countenances of these men were not bad. The
chief sign they made us Was patting the top of their heads with the
palms of their hands. Their expression of surprise sounded wow wow
wow wow wah. They made use of the words attahgooroo for sleep, and
teeteerec when they wanted to haul up their canoe. One of the men
wore a conch-shell over the lower part of his body, the others were
quite naked. Their bows were made of bamboos and their strings were
of the outer skin of this plant, and no one man in the ship could
string them. Their arrows were variously pointed with bones and
with bamboo; their clubs rudely carved and their spears about 14
feet long.</p>
<p>"Their canoes were 58 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 2 feet deep,
and in one piece, except a kind of gunwale to form a straight
sheer. They had a stage across the gunwale and an outrigger on each
side, and the stem was a little carved and ornamented in the head
with shells. They paddled standing, the paddles being long and
having narrow blades. A looking-glass did not surprise them, but
they cared for nothing but iron. I bought but one yam and that they
wanted to cut in half to make a better bargain. They had a strange
way of showing their astonishment by whistling and making a noise
like a ball whizzing through the air. At 8 o'clock the canoe left
us and they went to Island E to sleep, as we understood by their
signs. A boar's tusk was seen.</p>
<p>"Saturday, September 8th. The afternoon sun being like a blind
when observing danger, I waited until the morning before I set
sail. To the south we were shut in with a number of low woody
isles, but in the west and north all appeared clear. One hour's
sail westward, however, showed us shoals in the direction we had
hoped to steer and the water shoaled. Many banks lay in the north
and I therefore determined to steer for Island H.<sup>*</sup> As we
came near it we saw a sandy key<sup>**</sup> to the north of it,
and an extensive bank in the west and others N.E. of the Sandy Key.
Lat. 9&deg; 31' 143&deg; 28' E. Midway between the Sandy Key and H Island
we had 12 fms., when I hauled to the southward of it and anchored
in a charming little road under Island H,<sup>*</sup> the bottom
sand and clay 9&deg; 32' S., 143&deg; 31' E., an island lying S. 8&deg; W.
which called Island M<sup>***</sup> and 4 others to the east of it
in sight.<sup>****</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Dalrymple Island (Damuth).]</p>
<p class="note">[** Pearce's Cay (Mallicamas).]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Rennel Island (Mauar).]</p>
<p class="note">[**** These were Marsden Island, Keats Island, and
the Yorke Islands.]</p>
<p>"Abreast of us was a small village consisting of a dozen or 15
huts with flat roofs. Each had a doorway but no door, and several
of the huts were joined together and formed one front. They were
slightly built and covered with mattings or palm thatch. Their
canoes were hauled up on the beach and we saw a dog there but no
natives, and I concluded they were either a-fishing or had retired
into the woods at our approach.</p>
<p>"This isle is not above a mile or a mile and a half round and
its surface not 20 feet above the level of the sea, yet this little
spot is covered with wood and trees of a very large size branching
like forest oaks. Except A, B, and C, all we have seen are of this
kind.</p>
<p>"The winds are now very strong, and our safety depended on the
greatest caution. I therefore prepared the boats to explore to the
S.W., the only open pass for us to proceed. I have no doubt about
the space to the north of F Island to North Reef being full of
shoals.</p>
<p>"Sunday, September 9th. As soon as the people had dinner I sent
the boat away with Mr. Nichols to sound in the S. and S.W. The tide
was now to the W.S.W., which, I believe, is owing to banks in the
west. In the evening the boats returned and Mr. Nichols reported he
had found good soundings towards Island M and 13 to 15 fms. S.W. On
their return to the ships they were observed by the natives, who
followed them making signs for them to land. When all arrived at
the village the number was 42, 7 of whom were children. One was
carried on the shoulders of a woman, and not on the back as is
common. It was noticed that the women had a covering round the
hips, while the men were naked.</p>
<p>"There proved to be 15 men who had bows and arrows which they
laid at the back of one of their sheds. Then they made signs for us
to come to them. I therefore dispatched two boats to make some
presents of iron to them which I conceived was most valuable. Like
the rest they call it toorick. They were frantic when they heard it
jingle, and in return they gave us some fruit like a red plum and
some shell ornaments. This fruit is what I have described under the
Malay name Sou or Sour. They had only one dog with them, and I
suspect no other quadruped on the island. A little water was got;
it is most likely to be brackish.</p>
<p>"They offered us no kind of provisions. Not a single cocoanut
tree was seen, but the boats when sounding observed a few
plantains. They made use of the word Hobbo signifying to eat. Their
general signs were waving a green branch and patting the top of
their heads; they waded into the water to the boats and wanted the
men to come on shore: their women were very ugly except one whose
youth was the only advantage over the others. The dog was like the
Otaheitans. On the S.E. part of the island they have fences behind
which, I believe, they retire to fight: these fences are formed of
straight poles breast high, and are secured to one another by
cross-pieces. Fish, turtle, shell-fish are their chief
support."</p>
<p>In Flinders' log we find another description of Dalrymple
Island. All the accounts written by Bligh and his officers are
interesting, as they were the first to describe the inhabitants of
many islands in Torres Strait.</p>
<p>Flinders writes: "The huts we saw distinctly under the trees
like so many cowsheds, but not a soul near them; however, when the
boats were standing alongshore...the natives came out and ran along
the beach waving green branches and clapping their hands...When the
boats returned they were sent to them well armed and provided with
some trifles for trade. They found the natives very amicable,
running into the water to meet them and some of them getting into
the boat. They exchanged some trifles of small shells like we had
seen before, and some dates or plums something like the Jambo of
the East Indies which was the only eatable they had. One of the
Indians had a moderate sized dog with him of a brown chestnut
colour. When the boats came away the natives followed them into the
water to detain them, but offered no violence."</p>
<p>Bligh's log continues: "On seeing us get under way they launched
a canoe but I could not wait for them. They resembled in every
respect the people we had already seen here. As we sailed to the
S.W. we saw a great shoal westward of us, in every other quarter
shoals seem to threaten us. All the forenoon we continued to see
woody keys or isles round by the south as far as W.S.W., and a
continuation of the reef seen from our last anchoring place seemed
to join a low woody island called P, next to which was a larger
island called O. At noon N Island S.E., distance 3
miles.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* P is Warrior Island (Tutte); O is Dungeness
Island (Jeaka); N is Arden's Island (Garboy).]</p>
<p>"Monday, September 10th. At &frac12; past one in our course to Island
O, we fell in with a very dangerous and extensive reef that made it
doubtful how to proceed. I made signals to the 'Assistant' to be
ready to anchor and to explore with the boats, while I could keep
on a wind. We soon discovered that the reef was detached from
Island O, and we came to an anchor off the point of the reef and
bank, having passed along the east side of it in 15 fms. 9&deg; 50';
142&deg; 55'. The tide was 3 knots and the bottom being bad we rode
with great risk. The weather tide could only now get us out of this
situation, as running to the southward of O Island was hazardous.
It was noon, therefore, when we were under sail with the first of
the ebb setting strong to the eastward.</p>
<p>"A greater part of this bank covers at high water. It is made up
of coral, and the surface is spotted with a number of small rocks.
I call it Point Dungeness, and the Island O Dungeness Island,
between which and Island P appeared the best passage for the ships
to proceed. Island P is a small woody spot and is inhabited, but
Island O seems to be made of rock about 4 miles round, is low and
covered with an impenetrable forest.</p>

<p class="caption">Canoe of the Islands--South Coast of New Guinea
[<i>Drawn by Lieut. G Tobin, 1792</i>]</p>
<p>"Although I did not approve of going to the southward of it, I
now apprehend there is a safe channel towards some higher islands,
one of which from its appearance I have called Turtle Backed
Island.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Turtle Backed Island is so called to-day; its
native name is Yamma.]</p>
<p>"A canoe came off in the evening and would have come alongside
us but for the boat quitting the ships, and the canoe followed it
under sail to Island P where they parted company without any
communications.</p>
<p>"The sails of their canoes are made of matting in an oblong form
rudely stitched together. The mast to which it is hoisted consists
of 2 bamboo poles, the lower ends fixed close together in the
bottom of the canoe and the upper ends extended the width of the
sail, from whence it is hoisted travelling upon two guys. Some
canoes have two sails. They are always fixed close together in the
fore-part of the canoe. We observe them always row well to the
windward before they set their sail, and I think they have a piece
of plank which they sometimes use as a lee-board.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Tobin who had great opportunities of observing the
natives of Torres Strait while he was in charge of the boat, says
of them:--</p>
<p>"'The natives of the islands are rather under the middle size
and by no means well formed, some of them were marked on different
parts of the body and all were daubed with grease. In colour they
were generally black, and woolly headed, but the hair not so
slothed as in an African. Their beards were not shaved and their
legs not more than ordinarily thick. Eyes small and deep-sunk in
the head, nose not flat but the septum was perforated, on which
part they wear a ring either of shell or fish bone big enough to go
on a man's finger. This ring is quite hid nor could we account for
the distension of the nose till one of the natives took the ring
out. All their ears were slit and the lobe hung down sometimes as
low as the chin, the other part perforated and stuck round with
small bits of stick. Both men and women had their shoulders
scarified, particularly the left, and none were tattooed. The whole
save one or two wore a piece of shell over the lower part of the
body. The men were perfectly naked, the women wore an apron of
rushes that fastened above the hips and fell down below knees.
Their ornaments were not very numerous. From a woman on Island H, I
got a large ear ornament as big as a child's foot, made of wood,
and they wore necklaces of the panama and other shells; and
bracelets of cocoanut plaiting were worn by both sexes as well as
round the ankles and below and above the knee. Most of the men wore
a strong case of matting that extended the whole length of each
joint of the arm. From a canoe some masks were procured which we
thought were used as a protection for the face in battle. Their
weapons were mostly bows and arrows, but a sling, some clubs and
spears were observed amongst them. The bows are the most powerful I
have yet seen in any Indians, none of our people, nor the two
Otaheitans, were able to string them. They are of split bamboo,
some are 7 feet; the arrows are equally destructive and pointed
with bone and barbed several inches from the point.'"</p>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. IN TORRES
STRAIT.</h2>
<p>Bligh had now passed through the eastern side of Torres Strait
and was steering towards what are now known as the "Western
Approaches".</p>
<p>His journal continues: "Tuesday, September 11th. We were not
long under sail before we saw the canoes that were about Dungeness
and Island P. These were nine in number with from 8 to 20 men in
each paddling towards the ships. Some went towards the 'Assistant,'
but the strongest party came to us and made signs that water and
food were to be had at Island P. A word they generally use for
water is 'Wabbah-Wabbah,' at the same time holding up a bamboo and
pointing to their throats. They expressed great astonishment at the
ship, and at the men at the mast heads, and although we offered
them ropes they would not come alongside but showed signs of
distrust and design.</p>
<p>"I was considering what these symptoms were, when I saw the
'Assistant' suddenly fire at some canoes, as did our cutter, and
she alarmed us by the signal she made for 'assistance'. It was now
seen that the canoes had made an attack, and that those around us
were intending to do the same. I knew that mischief was done to our
poor little companion by these wretches, and arrows were fired at
us. It was not a time to trifle. My ship might be on shore in a few
minutes without being carefully handled, and it was a serious point
who were to be masters of the situation. I settled it by
discharging two of the quarter-deck guns with round and grape. The
contents of one carried destruction and brought horrible
consternation to them, and they fled from their canoes into the sea
and swam to windward like porpoises.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders writes: "In passing a deserted canoe
one native was observed still sitting in it. The other canoes
returned to him and through our glasses signals were perceived to
be made by the Indians to their friends on Dungeness Island
expressive of grief and consternation."]</p>
<p>"Three men on the 'Assistant' were wounded by their arrows.
Great fires were now made on the Island P, where we saw about too
persons. We passed between islands O and P through a good channel
of two or three miles, and leaving a small reef to the northward of
us anchored under Island O for the night. Island O, or Dungeness
Island, is a rocky spot on which the natives do not reside,
preferring the sandy islands for fishing. It has a narrow border of
rock that surrounds this side within which is a kind of lagoon.
About the shore are mangroves, and within shore the wood is
prodigiously thick. We saw curlews and white birds with their wings
tipped black and as large as a pelican.</p>
<p>"Situation of anchorage 9&deg; 48' S. and 142&deg; 51' E. Dungeness
Island S. 64&deg; E. to S. 10' E. off shore 1 mile; the long flat
island on the south extreme.<sup>*</sup> Turtle Backed Island S.

Cap<sup>**</sup> S. 86&deg; W. 4 leagues, and an island<sup>***</sup>
with 2 hills called The Brothers S. 50&deg; W. 5 leagues; at tip saw a
high lump of an island like Maitea N. 43&deg; W. 6 leagues, called it
Q.<sup>****</sup> It appeared to me that as the stream of tide had
run to northward of west that our course should be directed that
way. Therefore weighed and steered to go round The Brothers, the
'Assistant' with boats ahead leading.</p>
<p class="note">[* Long Island or Sassic.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Cap Islet or Dluquar.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Now called The Brothers Hills Island or Gabba,
one of the principal pearl shell stations in Torres Strait. It lies
about 60 miles N. of Cape York and 20 miles from the coast of New
Guinea.]</p>
<p class="note">[**** Mount Cornwallis or Tauan Island.]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, September 12th. Soon after noon our progress
westward was unhappily retarded by shoal water which lay to the
north of The Brothers. Uncertainty of our situation made me anchor
for the night in 7 fathoms sandy ground, and I sent the master and
2nd lieutenant at once to sound between The Brothers and the Sandy
Key.<sup>*</sup> Lat. 9&deg; 43' S., Long. 142&deg; 39' 19" E.</p>
<p class="note">[* Called Nichols Key by Captain Bligh in honour of
the master of the "Providence".]</p>
<p>"There proved to be a good passage. It was not till nearly
sunset that the haze was sufficiently off the horizon to see the
distant lands. To the northward of Island Q this lowland only
extended two points of the compass, but some of us thought they saw
a great deal more, if so it may be the main land of New Guinea.</p>
<p>"Island R was a very high island with a rather peaked
mountain.<sup>*</sup> Q was a high island<sup>**</sup> in the N.
West, 6 leagues dist., with an even surface rising to the centre;
and S. Island lying S. West, dist. 8 leagues, was a lofty lump of
land.<sup>***</sup> My situation by my map at this time was 9&deg; 43'
S. and 142&deg; 40' E. In the morning with the brig and boats leading I
followed on a course to the northward of west between The Brothers
and the Sandy Key, but our sounding shoaling to 6 fathoms we were
once again obliged to come to an anchor. A signal from the boat
told us that they were in 3 fathoms. We saw a range of banks from
south to west and we were not above 2 or 3 miles from them.</p>
<p class="note">[* R, Banks Island and Mount Augustus.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Q, Mount Cornwallis.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** S, Burke's Island. ]</p>
<p>"I immediately called the boats on board and prepared them to
set off with the master and 3rd lieutenant to examine what passage
there was to the northward of this shoal between it and an island
(rather low like the woody keys) which I called T.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* T is Turn-again Island (of Captain Bligh), on it
are two high hills which bear a resemblance to each other.
(Mourilyan Reef lies off it.)]</p>
<p>"The island R, I considered lay near to the northernmost I had
seen in the 'Bounty's' launch. This anchoring place is in 9&deg; 41' S.
and 142&deg; 28' E. We saw many flocks of both land and sea birds,
among which were some yellow-feathered ones and 2 pretty feathers
in the tail and a hooked bill like a humming bird. Five curlews,
some turtle and flying fish were also seen.</p>
<p>"The Brothers is a miserable mass of rocks and stones with a few
trees on the lee side of it. We saw a few inhabitants. Cap and
Turtle Islands lie south-east of it; they are of tolerable height
but equally barren. I have no favourable opinion of the channels
between them and I suspect they are bad.</p>
<p>"Thursday, September 13th. A little after noon I sent the boats
to examine the passage to the west and north-west. Instead of
keeping round the bank in that direction they fell to the northward
and eastward of it, so that after an absence of seven hours from
the ship they at last arrived without any information to induce me
to take the passage.</p>
<p>"They had four fathoms near to a shoal that bore N.N.W. from the
ship, with the rather low island called T in the W.N. West, and
this made me determine to try round the south end of the bank of
higher islands lying to south-west. To accomplish this I sent off
Lieutenant Guthrie with two boats at 4 o'clock in the morning with
the weather tide to carry out my design. At half past ten he
returned and reported that 5 and 6 fathoms with a good bottom were
his general soundings, and that he had 4 fathoms near the east end
of the shoal from whence it seemed to trend to the south-west. In
consequence I determined to go by that channel; but to enable me to
do it I must get to windward if possible with the next ebb. At noon
the weather became squally and it blew strong.</p>
<p>"It is remarkable the shoaling of the soundings as I have
proceeded eastward, and I hope they will not continue to decrease:
I know that it was so in the case of Captain Cook when in passing
to the southward of Prince of Wales Island. I therefore trust I
shall find nothing worse here.</p>
<p>"In my present situation without shelter and subject to much
sea, and with a ship drawing 16&frac12; feet of water, four fathoms is not
a pleasant depth, and now the haze is like a fog and it is seldom
we can see the high land. The month of October is advancing upon us
and everything urges me to get on.</p>
<p>"When the boats were away towards the reefs, Mr. Portlock
informed me he had seen some animals in the water 20 feet long. He
could not say what they were like. Should we be near the main of
New Guinea it is not improbable that they were alligators. The
situation of this place by my map which differs 3 miles from the
time-keepers is 9&deg; 41 S. 142&deg; 27 E.</p>
<p>"Friday, September 14th. Very strong winds and rain this
afternoon. I thought it prudent to weigh with the weather tide, not
only to keep farther from the bank which lay under our lee, but to
see if my cable was hurt. I gave Lieutenant Portlock instructions
to that intent, and after a few boards we anchored 3 miles to
windward of our first station.</p>
<p>"The evening looked wild and stormy. The gale increased and the
ships pitched very much. We had now to ride out or be driven upon
banks of coral sand. I therefore struck the lower yards and came to
with a new cable. The day brought little abatement of wind and we
were obliged to lie fast. In the morning I sent for Lieutenant
Portlock to know how he rode out the night as the little vessel
pitched tremendously; no accident had happened, and the three
wounded men were doing well.</p>
<p>"Saturday, September 15th. Nothing but hail and snow are wanting
to make this a hard gale! We lay pitching and tossing in a very
distressing way without means to help ourselves. To my concern I
found the new cable had laid over a bank and was rubbed a great
deal. I had no remedy but to shift our bank; therefore got under
weigh and came to anchor further northward--in a better situation.
It continued to blow all night moderating a little in the morning.
I therefore gave orders to Lieutenant Portlock to get under way and
explore the sea to the southward. At 6 he was under sail, and at It
we saw him return and anchor 3 miles to the west of us. By signal
he reported all was well."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. TORRES
STRAIT--BLIGH'S FAREWELL.</h2>
<p>In this chapter Captain Bligh tells how he got safely out of
Torres Strait, leaving it by the channel which bears his name. As
he came through the Strait he was frequently reminded of his trying
experiences in his boat voyage, and occasionally recognised islands
and landmarks that he had seen in 1789.</p>
<p>"Sunday, September 16th, 1792. At half past 3 the Assistant got
under way, and at half past 5 anchored near us. Lieutenant Portlock
reported that he had not been able to weather the reef, but had
seen the eastern part from whence it trended to the south-west. I
began to doubt if there was sufficient water in the channel to the
W.N. West south of Island T for the land was low: a large space was
open to the S. West towards Island R, which made me determine to
weigh with both vessels and explore that way. We were under sail at
sunrise; nothing could exceed the regularity of the soundings. At
noon we found Island R to be of more extent than any we had yet
seen. Its high mountain lies on the north-east part of it. To the
west and south of Island U<sup>*</sup> lay an island we called
V<sup>**</sup> of nearly equal extent with R, and between it and V
appeared an open passage.</p>
<p class="note">[* U, Jervis Island.]</p>
<p class="note">[** V, Mulgrave Island (Badu).]</p>
<p>"In the south-east lay three lofty islands, one of them called
S<sup>*</sup> was seen from our anchoring ground to the eastward of
The Brothers at 10 leagues distant. The southermost I knew to be
the island I have called the Peaked Hill<sup>**</sup> in my last
voyage, and now it confirmed to me that Island R is the mountainous
island with a very high round hill that I saw also. All the islands
are lofty, and different from the sandy keys we have passed to the
eastward, being without verdure although not destitute of wood.</p>
<p class="note">[* S, Burke's Island (Suar&agrave;ji).]</p>
<p class="note">[** Now Mount Ernest and the island Mt. Ernest
Island. Bligh called the whole group "Clarence's Archipelago".]</p>
<p>"Monday, September 17th. At half past noon made a signal to the
'Assistant,' and came to 1&frac12; miles from the most northern of these
small isles about 5 or 6 miles from Island R. Since we left
Dungeness no canoes have been seen and only a few natives on The
Brothers.</p>
<p>"The small Isles<sup>*</sup> next to us were without
inhabitants. I therefore sent Lieutenant Guthrie with two boats to
land on the northermost to hoist our colours and to take possession
of it. We named it Possession Island.<sup>**</sup> I also sent our
botanists to see what they could pick up. I now found the high
mountain<sup>***</sup> on Island R to lie in Lat, 10&deg; 12 S., Long.
142&deg; 14 E. Deducing its longitude from Cape York (by Captain Cook's
situation of it) it lies in 141&deg; 32 E. (My map places it in 10&deg; 15
S.)</p>
<p class="note">[* North Possession Isles, Tobin's Islet, and
Portlock's Islet were the names given to these small isles. Bond's
islet and Providence Shoal also received their names at this
time.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Now North Possession Islet.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Mount Augustus.]</p>
<p>"I have no doubt of its being the mountainous island with a very
high round hill which I have described in 1789. The difference in
my own latitude of 3 miles and 42 miles in longitude between
Captain Cook and myself is admissible. In this case the north part
of New Holland is placed 42 miles too far west.</p>
<p>"To the northwards of Island R in the account of my last voyage
in the 'Bounty's' Launch, I allowed a navigator to hope for a clear
passage. I have found it a very intricate one, isles and shoals
being scattered in every direction. The most eligible pass now
seemed to be to the westward between Islands U and V. Island U is
not one-third so large as Island V: about it lie several lofty
small isles--the largest to the east-southeast of it I called
Passage Island<sup>*</sup>--for with a remarkable black rock that
lies south of it, it formed the passage I was to go through.</p>
<p class="note">[* Black Rock and Passage Island are so called
to-day.]</p>
<p>"The sandy key,<sup>*</sup> E.N.E. of Possession Island,
indicated shoals all the way to Long Island.</p>
<p class="note">[* Watson's Cay.]</p>
<p>"Possession Island is an inconsiderable lump of rock and stones
bearing a few shrubs and small trees. Here, to these islands, the
Indians come for turtle. Our party saw a number of shells lying on
the beach (a sandy point where they landed), near this were twenty
or thirty small cocoanut trees bearing fruit. They gathered a few
and found them very delicious. Trees which bore the fruit that had
been brought us by the natives at Island H and called Sour by them
were also here, but had no fruit on them. The botanists saw many
curious and new plants and collected about a score of good
specimens. They found the Peeah and Nonah of Otaheite. The British
flag was hoisted by Lieutenant Guthrie who was accompanied by
Lieutenant Tobin. After the ceremony the party drank the King's
health and then made a tour of the island. Mr. Tobin writes of it:
'The island I was sent to with Mr. Guthrie to look for a passage to
westward (which I called Lookout Island), like the highest parts of
this inhospitable country, is a group of rocks tumbled on one
another to the summits. In some parts a sandy track surrounds it.
For such a barren spot it boasts some trees of tolerable growth and
some flowers and plants of lively appearance. Among the trees was
the wharra of Otaheite, and two kinds of what in the West Indies
are called Jumbee Beads.'"</p>
<p>Flinders tells us more about Possession Island:--</p>
<p>"The gentlemen landed on a fine sandy beach on its S.W. side;
they found no inhabitants, but by the turtle shell scattered about
it seems to be often visited, and not long since, for they found
where a fire had been recently kindled. Except a small spot near
the beach the island is a mass of rocks. In going among the shrubs
they got covered with a large species of ant of a light green
colour which was very troublesome. It is of a long slender make and
very delicate. They found the nest of another species which was
black, as large as and much thicker than the other; the nest was a
number of twigs glued together in round form as large as a quartern
loaf: and two new plants the size of the common mulberry. One of
the class Polyadelphia bears a scarlet, bell-shaped flower large as
a china rose, the other a species of Erythrina bearing clusters of
butterfly-shaped flowers of a light yellow tinged with purple; both
were entirely destitute of leaves, and their woods remarkably
brittle."</p>
<p>Bligh continues:--</p>
<p>"No marks of any quadruped were observed. A beautiful little
lizard was seen among some loose stones, and the webbed nests of
the ants the same as I have seen on the coast of New Holland. A few
oysters adhered to the rocks, clams and a kind of whelk were
likewise seen, but not a drop of fresh water was obtained. In all
other respects it appeared to me like the Island of Restoration
which lies in Lat. 12&deg; 38' S. discovered in my last voyage. Doves
and some pretty birds were seen but too shy to come within reach of
our shot. We lay all night here.</p>
<p>"At dawn having informed Lieutenant Portlock how to proceed I
sent the boats on ahead of him with orders to weigh, and lead out
between Islands U and V. In weighing our anchor came up with only
one arm. A serious loss.</p>
<p>"As we advanced to westward passing between the Black Rock and
Passage Island we saw several lofty islands to the south of the
opening between U and V. Soon afterwards we discovered reefs
overlapping one another. The 'Assistant' advanced and was obliged
to anchor, as the flood tide was running so strong. I furled all
sails and also came to anchor. To my horror when the half cable
came out it had the dogstopper on, which although I cut it
immediately and let go a second anchor I only had it just in my
power to save the ship from the rocks. The men who had done this
were no more faulty than the officer who was in command so I did
not punish them.</p>
<p>"We were now anchored on the north part of Island V. It has a
barrier of rocky keys around it, forming narrow passages to Island
U. I ordered Lieutenants Tobin and Guthrie in two boats to examine
the passage I thought most eligible, and directed them to land on
one of the isles. Island V appeared a miserable burnt-up country;
it had wood in some places, and the rocky keys resemble those off
the coast of Norway.</p>
<p>"Between these keys and U is a space of 3 miles that promises a
passage but (from the masthead) it appears full of shoals, and I
did not attempt to explore it minutely. We saw canoes lurking
alongshore towards the 'Assistant'.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, September 18th. About 3 o'clock the boats made the
signal for a good anchorage. At 4 had both up with the loss of an
arm of one. (I had now 2 anchors disabled.) The 'Assistant' weighed
without accident. I made her the signal to lead. Lieutenant Guthrie
met me as I was passing the first narrows, and I now found we had
neither good anchorage nor a convenient passage for the ships.</p>
<p>"Our situation was worse than before. Rocks all around us and a
dreadful tide running. Night obliged me to anchor with little
certainty of keeping off the rocks. After a miserable night
daylight threatened a storm, but sunrise brought more favourable
weather. Giving Lieutenant Portlock orders to lead through such a
passage as may appear and sending the boats ahead of him, I made
the signal to weigh at slack tide...and after ranging along the
keys off the N.W. of Island V in a channel<sup>*</sup>
three-quarters of a cable wide, and that winding, I passed into an
open sea. No land was to be seen from the south round by west to
north.</p>
<p class="note">[* Called by Captain Bligh "Bligh's Farewell".
'This channel is still called Bligh's Channel, and is "the
northernmost of all the known channels through Torres Strait, being
hounded on the north by Jervis reef, North Patch, North Islet, and
the shoals extending from Farewell Islets".--Adm. Sailing
Directions.]</p>
<p>"At 9 o'clock, an hour after we were clear of the rocks, we
again fell into shoal water. After anchoring here the boats
reported favourably and I intend sending them with the 'Assistant'
to examine at greater distance. There were twenty-seven men in
canoes here: these were all we saw. They had their bows with them
and I imagine the country is thinly inhabited.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, September 19th. I ordered Lieutenant Portlock to try
soundings on the west and west-south-west with boats ahead for a
passage. He did so, and at 20 past seven made the signal for me to
follow. It was now necessary to push on. I had no port to go to. My
water was getting short. My ground tackling crippled and only two
anchors fit to anchor with. The sea appeared open in the west, and
by noon we found the water deepen--our last anchorage is in 141&deg;
56' E. and 10&deg; 05' S. It is 6<sup>*</sup> leagues west of the reefs
I first met with. The open space to the westward and the views of
the high mountain on Island R convince me that it is the same place
I saw in the 'Bounty's' Launch. If it is, Captain Cook is 40 miles
wrong in its position, and I apprehend the coast of New Holland
will also be in error.</p>
<p class="note">[* This entry is indistinct; the numeral is 6 or
10.]</p>
<p>"Thursday, September 20th. I ordered the 'Assistant' to stretch
to the northward. The night passed without accident and at morning
sent the boats away to lead ahead. I could not discover land or
shoals. At noon we were 4 leagues to the westernmost shoal that
Captain Cook had anchored at (N.W. of Booby Key in my last voyage):
the sea much covered with spawn and scum of brown colour.</p>
<p>"Friday, September 21st. My soundings fully confirm my belief
that we are passing through the strait and are in Captain Cook's
track where he stood to the northward towards the island of St.
Bartholomew, At sunset hoisted the boats in, and hailed Lieutenant
Portlock to lead to the north-west till dusk and to keep on a wind
during the night. At daylight sent the boats ahead.</p>
<p>"Saturday, September 22nd. I considered it proper to spend the
night under sail. At half past ten I made the signal to steer
west-north-west; the water had shoaled and I determined to get into
latitude of 9&deg; S. so as to steer clear of the Wessel Islands.</p>
<p>"Sunday, September 23rd. In the morning the ship's company spent
the day without work and happy to a degree that they had passed the
reefs of New Guinea...Lat. 9&deg; 7' 50" S., Long. 136&deg; 48' East.</p>
<p>"Monday, September 24th. In the morning we fell in with a bank
on which there was no dry ground either rocks or sand. The
'Assistant' was close to it when she made the signal. It gave me
much concern to hear of the death of the poor man William Terry,
Quartermaster, who was wounded with an arrow some time
since<sup>*</sup> on board the 'Assistant'. The day before he died
he was thought to be recovering...he was buried yesterday morning.
The other two wounded at the same time are happily doing well. 8&deg;
46' S., 135&deg; 23' E.</p>
<p class="note">[* September 11th.]</p>
<p>"Tuesday, September 25th. At 7 o'clock shortened sail.
Lieutenant Portlock informed me that what he supposed was shoal
water had 44 fathoms: at 6 o'clock we had 84 fathoms. I now find a
current setting to the northward. In the beginning of this month
Captain Cook found a current setting to southward. My plants are in
a charming condition, up to this day our loss of breadfruit has
been 126 large pots and 94 small pots.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, September 26th. I sent for Lieutenant Portlock to
give him an idea of my intention to touch at the south side of
Timor, and of the situation of Coupang. Water is now our only
want.</p>
<p>"Thursday, September 27th. In 1789, when I quitted the coast of
New Holland in the 'Bounty's' Launch, I then laid down the
mountainous island with a high round hill in 10&deg; 15' S. and 143&deg;
45' E.<sup>*</sup> These were found from a fair account of the
ship's run. I found Coupang to be in 10&deg; 12' S. and 127&deg; 42' E.</p>
<p class="note">[* Banks Island or Island R.]</p>
<p>"I made the long. of the same mountain by my account at this
time 145&deg; 41' E., as my account is carried on with the same
fairness my long. from Coupang to-day is 4&deg; 31' East.</p>
<p>"Friday, September 28th. Hailed the 'Assistant' to steer N.W. to
clear a bank which must lie off the coast of New Holland. It
appears likely that this bank lies off the north part of New
Holland, the situation of it being farther north and west than any
information has led us to believe. I steered N.W. to deepen our
water which took place an hour and a half after, we had 64 fathoms.
The bank must be very steep. At noon I steered W.S.W. for the south
side of Timor to make the land below the lat. of 10&deg; S.</p>
<p>"Saturday, September 29th. I did not think we should make the
land to-day, but altered the course at night and steered direct for
it at daylight. At noon the curlews indicated land being near, and
I am confident we could have seen Timor had it not been for a
prodigious thick haze.</p>
<p>"Sunday, September 30th. I expected to have made Timor this
evening, but the haze prevented it. At daybreak we saw land...and
at noon we could see the low land which terminates the west part of
Timor. I considered it advisable to keep on a wind for the
night.</p>
<p>"Monday, October 1st. At daylight I sent the boats to lead ahead
of the 'Assistant,' and bore away towards a long low shore forming
the south-west point of Timor. Samow Strait now shows itself
distinctly.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, October 2nd. At 1 o'clock we were nearly through the
Straits of Samow when the southeast wind left us. I stood in under
the point and fired several guns, but no notice was taken of them
except by some Malay prows who came no nearer than to see what we
were. As soon as my people were a little refreshed I sent
Lieutenant Guthrie to acquaint the Governor of my arrival. I also
desired a pilot if any person was sufficiently acquainted with the
roads.</p>
<p>"At 10 at night Mr. Guthrie returned. He had met with a friendly
re-option from Mr. Wanjon<sup>*</sup> who was now Governor, and was
told I should have every assistance. The captain of the 'Snow
Verwagting' came to show us the way into the Road. He was called
Tytrand Jacobus Bouberg and, having known me before, was kindly
solicitous to give us assistance. With light winds in the morning
to the northward, in a couple of hours we got into Coupang Roads
when the Fort saluted us with 15 guns, and the same on my
landing.</p>
<p class="note">[* Or Vanion.]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, October 3rd. It was a pleasant circumstance to me to
find Mr. Timotheus Wanjon, the gentleman who had assisted me so
kindly when here in the 'Bounty's' Launch, to be now Governor. Out
of the little society then living, four were now dead, among whom
was the surgeon, Mr. Max, who had attended our sick and dressed our
sores."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. COU PANG.</h2>
<p>At Coupang Bligh was welcomed by many old friends, and he
doubtless would have had a pleasant visit had he not been seized
with an attack of fever. While the ships were in port, however, he
made many interesting entries in his log on various matters
connected with the locality.</p>
<p>From Captain Bligh's Journal: "I found our friend Mr. Wangon was
very glad to see us. He was now Governor, and had it in his power
to oblige me by expediting our business.</p>
<p>"The first news I heard was that Captain Edwards had lost the
'Pandora' on August 28th, 1791, between New Holland and New Guinea:
the crew, except thirty men (four of whom were the 'Bounty's' men),
who were lost with the ships, took to the boats. Captain Edwards
arrived at Coupang with two boats on September 17th, and the day
following two other boats arrived making ninety-nine in all. Before
the ship was lost they had parted company with their shallop, and
never heard of her until on their way to Batavia, when they found
her in possession of the Dutch at Sourabaja, and the men confined
in prison. They were released, and with the Pandora's' company all
sailed from Batavia for Europe in different vessels towards the end
of November.</p>
<p>"The Governor unfortunately had lost the written account of the
loss of the ship given him by Captain Edwards. A letter I had given
the latter for Mr. Wangon was delivered, and was an introduction
independent of their misfortune.</p>
<p>"The next interesting news was the arrival of a six-oared cutter
from Port Jackson with eight men, one woman, and two children. They
had deserted from the settlement on March 28th, 1791, and arrived
at Timor on June 5th. The principal represented himself as mate of
the lost whalefisher, and said all except themselves had perished,
and he had written a very ingenious account of their misfortunes,
which had gained them protection until one of the party informed
through pique (at not being taken so much notice of as the rest),
and they were all sent to Batavia with Captain Edwards. The day
before I sailed, after being disappointed at having no written
account to judge Captain Edwards' misfortune, and teasing the
Governor to find that which he had left, he presented me with a
correct journal of their boat's voyage. This journal was very
distinctly kept and entitled 'Remarks on a Voyage from Sydney Cove,
New South Wales, to Timor'. It gave the account of everything as it
really happened, and from this the fictitious one was formed.</p>
<p>"It appears the men had taken a fishing boat that Captain
Phillip had entrusted them with. They had provided themselves with
the immediate necessaries both for themselves and for the safety of
the boat, and they had a seine which they frequently hauled with
success. Two musquets were all the arms they had, and with these
they kept the natives in awe as they coasted along the shore from
Port Jackson round the northern part of New Holland. Fish and
cabbages were the general supplies spoken of. I suppose they mean
mountain cabbage. They had flour and pork in the boat, but the
quantity is not mentioned, besides a grapnel, nails, beeswax, and
rosin. To the southward they found the natives armed with spears
and shields, but to the northward among the islands in Endeavour
Strait they had bows and arrows. In Lat. 32 degrees S. 2 leagues
from the shore these people discovered a shoal with only 5 ft. of
water on it.</p>
<p>"On March 28th at 11 p.m. the journalist says they sailed from
Sydney Cove and stood to N.N.E. On March 30th, after variable winds
and weather, they bore away for a small creek; having the wind
contrary they caught mullet and repaired the boat. 'Walking along
shore towards the entrance of the creek we found several large
pieces of coal; seeing so many pieces we thought it was not
unlikely to find a mine, and searching about a little we found a
place where we picked up with an axe as good coals as any in
Englanci, took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly
well.'</p>
<p>"On March 31st at 6 a.m. they left this place, and on April 1st
he says they were in Lat. 33&deg; 20' S. On the afternoon of the 2nd
they saw a fine harbour which they entered and described it to be
'superior to Sydney'. Hence they ranged along the coast, frequently
getting supplies of fish and undergoing many difficulties until
they arrived at Timor. The woman and children bore the fatigue
wonderfully well and not one person died. The latitude and
distances were not regularly kept up, so it is impossible to
ascertain the different places stopped at, but the journal is clear
and distinct, and shows the writer must have been a determined and
enterprising man.</p>
<p>"I was too ill at this time to copy the journal. I however
employed a person about it, but he did not get a fourth part
through it. The circumstances of the coals being found may make the
account valuable, but I am sorry I could not ascertain its exact
situation. Captain Edwards, I hope, has done all this. The
journalist remarks that it was with difficulty he got the boat into
the creek, there being shoal water across it,<sup>*</sup> but he
backed the boat in without receiving damage.</p>
<p class="note">[* It is to be regretted that Captain Bligh did not
succeed in obtaining a copy of this journal. The statement as to
the discovery of coal is important, because the first finding of
coal in New South Wales is usually ascribed to some fishermen who
saw it in 1796 at what is now known as Newcastle. This may be
because neither Edwards nor Bligh informed anyone in the colony,
but the story that Bryant, the leader of the runaways, and his
companions discovered coal had already been published in England.
In an article in a London paper (July 3rd, 1792) the writer stated
that "large veins of remarkably fine coal" were discovered by the
runaways 3&deg; north of Sydney. This is a good deal farther north than
33&deg; 20' S., the latitude reached by their boat (according to their
journal) on the day after it had left the creek where they found
coal. It is therefore difficult to fix the actual spot where coal
was discovered. If the journal from which Bligh quotes is to be
relied on, it was somewhere between Sydney and Newcastle.<br>
<br>
The identification of the harbour which was thought "superior" to
Sydney, is also somewhat difficult. Captain Tench, in his Account
of the Settlement at Port Jackson, gives a full description of the
escape, and without mentioning coal refers to a harbour of superior
excellence and capacity which was seen by the deserters in 30&deg;
S.<br>
<br>
It will be observed that Tench and Bligh both write of a "superior"
harbour which has generally been conjectured (from Tench's account
of it) to have been Shoal Bay in 29&deg; 43' S., or Port Macquarie in
31&deg; 24' 45" S.<br>
<br>
But if four days after leaving Port Jackson the boat was still in
33&deg; 20' S. (the latitude quoted by Bligh), through having been
unable to proceed farther owing to contrary winds, it seems more
likely that the harbour seen on April 2nd was Port Stephens, in
latitude 32&deg; 45' S.]</p>
<p>"During my stay here I had not a moment's intermission from a
violent headache and touches of fever at times; from 8 in the
morning till 5 in the afternoon I dare not expose myself to the
heat of the sun. The houses, too, from the red tiling were heated
like ovens, so that morning and evening were the only parts of the
day at all bearable. Our Otaheitan friends were delighted with the
houses and sight of the Europeans, as it conveyed to them some idea
of what they would see in England. They dislike the Malays because
they have dirty mouths and black teeth; seeing a few of them in
chains created surprise, but when we told them the reason they
thought it right and proper.</p>
<p>"There is great severity used in this country to preserve power.
The brother of a king who considered it his right to reign after
his brother's death (although there was a son to inherit approved
by the Dutch) made some opposition which caused him to be declared
rebel. In hopes of forgiveness he gave himself up to the Dutch
authorities, but contrary to expectation he was sent away in a snow
to Batavia whence he will be banished for life...it was an
affecting picture of fallen royalty to see the distress of his
friends who attended him to the water side.</p>
<p>"I can assign no reason, but the loss of our breadfruit at this
time amounted to 224 pots. The botanists have been diligently
employed to make up with what can be got here and with natives to
assist have collected 92 pots of the best plants of this place. The
plants taken up here are Mangoes, Jambelang Jambos, Balumbeng,
Chermailah, Karambola, Lemon More-sang, Cosambee, Cattahpas,
Bread-fruit, Seereeboah, Penang or Beetle Nut, Dangreedah trees
with which they perfume, Bughnah, and Kanangah. The Nanka or jack
they could not get. My sketch of Samow (Semao) is not so complete
as I could wish.</p>
<p>"On October 10th we filled up our water and brought two
buffaloes on board.</p>
<p>"A person offering to pilot us out to sea, I agreed with him in
hopes of getting information. I was disappointed in him as there
appeared a want of nautical knowledge in him which prevented my
relying on what he said. On the whole there is reason to believe
there are several good reef harbours about Timor. Dailey, where the
Portuguese Settlement is, he says is one where the 'Providence'
might anchor safely during the East Monsoon, and there were more
supplies to be had there than at Coupang. The Governor and two men
are the only European inhabitants, but a ship annually calls there
from Macow.</p>
<p>"It appears I have got away from this place just in time as six
men are ill in the ship.</p>
<p>"Hove short and half past five a.m. got under way, with the
boats towing. Saluted with thirteen guns which was returned with
the same number. A fine little breeze in the morning carried us
clear out of the road, and having parted with the pilot made sail,
and at noon were two miles west of Samow.</p>
<p>"Soon after noon on October 11th we saw a small island off the
S.W. part of Samow...S.E. distant four leagues I steered to go to
the northward of Savu when I saw it. We saw also a smaller island
called Bengoar (in Robertson's late publications) which is nearly
as lofty as Savu: to the southward of this the Dutch informed me
lies a smaller isle. A current setting to the westward has been
considerable since we came out of Coupang. Our sick list to-day was
increased to nine."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. TIMOR TO JAMAICA
AND HOME.</h2>
<p>When Bengoar had been left behind, the "Providence" and the
"Assistant" steered a south-westerly course towards Madagascar, as
Captain Bligh had been instructed, if it were necessary to put into
any port on his way to St. Helena, to choose St. Augustine's rather
than Table Bay. The climate of the latter place, it was thought,
would be too cold for the plants; and the botanists had also been
ordered to take every possible precaution to cover up the
breadfruit while the weather was rough.</p>
<p>In their voyage across the Indian Ocean the ships passed close
to the Cocos Islands, but did not see them as a dense mist hid them
from view. A spell of wet weather now set in until the end of
October. On November 4th the captain says he saw an albatross among
the birds flying round the ships "whose presence with a great swell
from the southwards indicates a strong wind from that quarter". The
great swell and a very high wind that blew hard retarded the
progress, of the vessels towards the Cape, and at this time Bligh
also experienced anxiety with regard to the health of his crew.
Several men were suffering severely from illness contracted from
the unhealthy climate of Timor, and on November 6th it is recorded
in the logbook that "Thomas Lickman, Marine, a poor, worn-out
creature "died" through catching cold and from an improper use of
arrack before he embarked". His body was committed to the sea at
ten o'clock on November 7th.</p>
<p>On the 10th, in lat. 27&deg; 33' S. and long. 51&deg; 15' E. Captain
Bligh informed the botanists that he now had it in his power to put
in to St. Augustine's Bay, Madagascar, if they thought it would be
advantageous to the plants. Messrs. Wiles and Smith, however,
thought that such a proceeding would be attended with great risk;
and they wrote a letter to that effect to Captain Bligh who, having
sufficient water for his needs and being short of anchors, was, no
doubt, pleased at their decision, as he writes: "At this time of
year the northwest winds begin to blow and send in a heavy sea to
St. Augustine's Bay, so that at any rate touching at that place is
not proper, my ground tackling not being sufficient".</p>
<p>On Sunday, November 11th, a "large body of dark clouds" passed
over the ship whence, according to Bligh, issued what appeared to
be a small meteor. He thus describes it: "An extraordinary
whistling and a rippling in the water about five yards in diameter
passed alongside of us without our feeling any effect from it; a
light coloured spot the size of a hat was in the centre of it--the
other part appeared like a smart shower of rain falling with it--a
few drops were barely discernible to fall on the ship. Its motion
was with the wind which was easterly."</p>
<p>A strange sail was sighted next morning, the first since the
vessels had left Timor. She proved to be "an American hull down in
the S.W. and steered to the E.S.E.". No other ship was seen until
they arrived at St. Helena.</p>
<p>In fair and cloudy weather Bligh's vessels weathered the Cape of
Good Hope, and, as they stood farther southward, flocks of oceanic
birds appeared on the 19th, and succeeding days. A westerly wind on
the 21st blew into a strong gale and brought a heavy head sea, and
Bligh remarks: "My plants have been shut up close these few days
past: they are nevertheless doing well, but these adverse winds are
much against them".</p>
<p>On December 1st, many on board the ship "felt a strong smell of
rock weed, which our people who have been on the whale fishery said
was from whales near us," and next day two whales actually were
seen. At noon on the 4th, Captain Bligh was able to take an
observation, the sun being visible for the first time for many
days, and he records that he found himself in lat. 37&deg; 37&frac12;' S. and
long. 17&deg; 20' E., this being nearly his highest latitude. The ships
at this time were well round the Cape, and were steering in a
north-westerly direction towards St. Helena, the situation of the
Cape of Good Hope being on December 6th S.E., distant 94 leagues.
On December 11th he observes: "I have again crossed the tropic,"
and later under the same date heading gives a list of the plants he
had lost on the voyage from Tahiti:--</p>
<pre>
From Otaheite to Timor lost    224 pots.
From Timor to 7th Nov. lost    192 pots.
From 7th. Nov. to this day lost 80 pots.
                               ---------
                         Total 496 pots.
                               ---------
</pre>
<p>"The numbers now stand 655 vessels containing 830 plants."</p>
<p>St. Helena was seen from the masthead at daylight on December
17th, 9 leagues distant. Early in the morning while the ships were
on their way to the anchorage the second lieutenant was sent off in
the launch to wait on the Governor. At 9.30 the vessels came
abreast of the 4th Battery, where they were saluted from Ladder
Hill with fifteen guns to which they replied with an equal number.
An hour later after having spent ten weeks at sea, they anchored
half a mile from the shore, St. James Church Tower and the Flag
Staff both South by West. An English whaler called the "British
Tar," bound for the southern fishery, and a French merchantman were
found lying in the harbour.</p>
<p>Bligh tells of his coming:--</p>
<p>"At noon after I anchored an officer was sent from the Governor,
Lt.-Colonel Broke, to welcome us. I landed at 1 o'clock when I was
saluted with 13 guns, and the Governor received me. In my interview
with him I informed him of my orders to give into his care to
breadfruit plants, and one of every kind (of which I had five), as
would secure to the island a lasting supply of this valuable fruit
which our most gracious King had ordered to be planted there.
Colonel Broke expressed great gratitude, and the principal plants
were taken to a valley near his residence called Plantation House,
and the rest to James's Valley. On the 23rd I saw the whole landed
and planted; one plant was given to Major Robson, Lt.-Governor, and
one to Mr. Rangham, the first in Council. I also left a quantity of
mountain rice seed here. The Peeah<sup>*</sup> was the only plant
that required a particular description. I therefore took our
Otaheitan friends to the Governor's House where they made a pudding
of the prepared part of its root, some of which I had brought from
Otaheite."</p>
<p class="note">[* Sago.]</p>
<p>Writing of St. Helena, Captain Bligh says: "Few places look more
unhealthy when sailing along its burnt-up cliffs--huge masses of
rock fit only to resist the sea, yet few places are more healthy.
The inhabitants are not like other Europeans who live in the Torrid
Zone, but have good constitutions--the women being fair and pretty.
James Town, the capital, lies in a deep and narrow valley, and it
is little more than one long street of houses; these are built
after our English fashion, most of them having thatched roofs.
Lodgings are scarce, so I was fortunate in finding rooms with
Captain Statham in a well-regulated house at the common rate of
twelve shillings a day. The Otaheitans were delighted with what
they saw here, as Colonel Broke showed them kind attention, had
them to stay at his house, and gave them each a suit of red
clothes."</p>
<p>A letter from the Governor and Council of St. Helena was sent to
Captain Bligh before he left--conveying thanks for the gifts which
the recipients declared "had impressed their minds with the warmest
gratitude towards His Majesty for his goodness and attention for
the welfare of his subjects"; while the sight of the ships "had
raised in them an inexpressible degree of wonder and delight to
contemplate a floating garden transported in luxuriance from one
extremity of the world to the other".</p>
<p>"All needful refreshment "was taken on board, and the ships left
St. Helena on December 27th, receiving the salute from the battery
on Ladder H ill as they sailed out of the harbour. The Island of
Ascension was made on New Year's Day in fine weather, the
"Assistant" passing so near the island that Mr. Portlock was able
to make a sketch of it which is preserved in his journal. On
January 7th, 1793, Thomas Galloway died on board the "Providence"
from dysentery contracted at Timor. His body was buried at sea the
following day. During the remaining part of the passage to St.
Vincent the ships encountered rough and squally weather, and on the
loth the "Providence" carried away her main topgallant mast. At
sunset on the 22nd Barbados was seen to the north-west, and next
morning St. Vincent where, on the same evening, the ships anchored
safely in Kingstown Bay.</p>
<p>"As twenty years have elapsed," writes Captain Bligh, "since I
was at this island, and as I was not certain of knowing Kingstown
Bay in the night, I was induced to bring to near a French sloop for
a pilot. I got a negro who was perfectly acquainted with the
harbour, and I anchored at half past ten without accident: the
winds were light, but fortunately the merchant ships knew who we
were and sent assistance to tow us in.</p>
<p>"I sent Lieutenant Guthrie to inform the Governor of my arrival,
and to request that everything should be forwarded to receive the
plants I had been ordered to leave on the island. In the morning
Dr. Anderson, the superintendent, came on board and with him I
waited on General Seton, and it was agreed to have the plants
brought up to the Garden by negroes.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 24th we began to land the plants. A
number of negroes carried the pots on their heads to the Botanic
Garden which is about 2 miles distant from the beach; and on
returning they brought back in the same manner the plants that Dr.
Anderson had got ready for His Majesty's Garden at Kew.</p>
<p>"A deputation from the Hon. Council and Assembly waited on me
the day after my arrival, and presented me with a resolution and
request to accept a piece of plate valued at 100 guineas as a mark
of their approbation and esteem. They likewise did me the honour to
give a public dinner to all my officers, and during our stay were
unremitting in their kindness and attention. Two bullocks were
given us on behalf of the ships' companies so that every one
benefited by their hospitality. I left in all 544 plants at this
place, and I received, for His Majesty's Garden at Kew, 465 pots
and 2 tubs containing botanic plants."</p>
<p>While the ships were in port at St. Vincent, Captain Bligh lost
two men, Jno. Thompson (one of the "Matilda's" men), who deserted,
and Henry Smith who fell overboard and was drowned.</p>
<p>On January 30th the ships once again put to sea, and proceeded
towards Jamaica. Three days later their courses were altered to
make Altavella and Beata, islands off the southern shore of San
Domingo, which were visible at noon. The "Providence" sighted Cape
Tiburon, the most westerly point of Haiti, on February 4th, and at
the same time Jamaica was visible but indistinctly. Next day both
ships were brought to their moorings in Port Royal harbour, when
Bligh's long voyage was safely accomplished, and at last the
breadfruit tree was brought to Jamaica.</p>
<p>On the 6th Captain Bligh went on shore to call on Commodore Ford
and to place himself under his command, while Lieutenant Guthrie
waited on Governor-General Adam Williamson to whom a letter had
been dispatched asking that the plants might be taken out of the
ship as soon as possible. The commodore and many gentlemen from the
shore came on the following day to see the breadfruit trees which
we are told were then "in the highest perfection".</p>
<p>Captain Bligh also informs us that he attended a meeting of the
Committee on the 9th to discuss the destination of the breadfruit.
It was then determined to divide the plants among the different
counties, but to reserve two general houses or nurseries for them,
one of which was to be at East Garden and the other at Bath. Mr.
Wiles, one of the botanists, was engaged in the capacity of
gardener to remain at Bath, and Bobbo or Pappo, the Otaheitan, was
selected to remain with him.</p>
<p>"I was solicited to take the plants allotted to Bath round in
the ship to Port Morant when I had delivered those intended for
this place, and requested to order the 'Assistant' to carry the
Cornwall plants round to Savannah la Mar."</p>
<p>A pilot arrived on the 13th to take the "Providence" to Port
Morant where the remainder of the plants on board that ship, 268 in
number, were landed; and on February 14th the "Assistant" sailed
with her cargo of plants for Savannah. Those delivered to Jamaica
were thus distributed: The county of Middlesex received 110:
Greenwich (for the county of Surrey), 136: Port Morant (for the
county of Surrey), 268: Savannah (for the county of Cornwall),
109.</p>
<p>In gratitude for his valuable services the Committee ordered a
letter to be sent to Captain Bligh, of which the following is an
extract:--</p>
<p>"KINGSTON,</p>
<p>"March 20th, 1793.</p>
<p>"Sir,</p>
<p>"I am authorised in the name of the Committee appointed to act
in the reception of the Bread Fruit and other valuable plants
lately received, to assure you in their name of the high sense they
entertain of your exertions and great merit in bringing to so happy
a conclusion the beneficent object of our most gracious Sovereign
in this most arduous task committed to your charge.</p>
<p>"I am, etc.,</p>
<p>"HENRY SHIRLEY."</p>
<p>The young trees were delivered at Port Morant in the usual way,
being landed from the ship and carried to their destination on the
heads of the negroes. When they had all been put on shore, Bligh
weighed anchor and made sail again for Port Royal where he found
the "Assistant" lying already. Important news was received shortly
afterwards from Europe on the arrival of the "Duke of Cumberland"
packet at Jamaica. She reported that the National Convention of
France had declared war on England. This naturally caused great
excitement, and it also delayed the departure of the "Providence"
and "Assistant," as Commodore Ford detained them "until more force
had arrived at Port Royal".</p>
<p>The commodore made great use of the ships. He sent the
"Assistant" often to sea to convoy ships to ports near at hand, and
on April ist hoisted his pennant on board the "Providence" and his
staff was embarked in her. A little later many King's ships came
there, among them being the "Persephone," "Penelope," "Spitfire,"
"Hyaena," "Europa," "Serpent," and "Fly". They were very energetic
in giving chase to French vessels, in taking prisoners, and
bringing prizes into the harbour, being often aided by the
"Assistant". Monsieur Borrell, Commandant at Port au Prince, was
one of those thus made a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>During April Mr. Norris, who had been surgeon in the "Matilda,"
was taken ill, and sent on shore to the hospital. Not until June
loth did Captain Bligh receive his orders from Commodore Ford to
sail for England. The "Assistant" was then absent at Bluefields,
and as Bligh's instructions were "to sail to Cape San Antonio (off
the coast of Cuba), with the 'Assistant,' and there to take such
ships of the Honduras Fleet as might be assembled and proceed with
them home," he determined to put to sea without his consort. Having
taken on board the whole of the plants for Kew, and the
"Providence" being ready for sea, he left Port Royal on June 15th
for Bluefields, where he hoped he might meet the "Assistant".
There, however, a letter was delivered to him from Lieutenant
Portlock, informing him that he was standing by a distressed ship
called the "Rosehampton," off the west end of the island, and
would, if permitted, meet the "Providence" off the Island of Grand
Cayman.</p>
<p>The two ships met there on June 17th, reaching Cape San Antonio
on the loth, "where," writes Captain Bligh, "with eight sail in
company including ourselves, and with the Honduras Fleet not in
sight, I conceived the spirit of my orders to mean that I should
not wait longer, otherwise the delay would cause the loss of my
plants: accordingly made sail".</p>
<p>The convoy left Cape San Antonio next day, and there were with
the "Providence" and the "Assistant," the "Antelope" packet, the
"Roehampton," the "Clemenson," and "Thomas" of Bristol, "the last
two being Guinea-men". They rounded Cuba, and entered the Bay of
Matanzas, on the northern coast of that island, on the 24th, from
which port Captain Bligh took a new departure. On the 25th "The Pan
of Matanzas appeared a round lump of an island about a handspike
length above the horizon."<sup>*</sup> On the 26th the coast of
Florida came in sight, and the vessels proceeded on a course
through the Florida Channel and the Gulf Stream.</p>
<p class="note">[* It is 1280 feet in height.]</p>
<p>Captain Bligh continues: "I found that I was on the Florida
shore, and not, as I first thought, on the Bahama Side. This
circumstance enabled me to determine an essential point. The coast
of Florida is in latitude 26&deg; 36', and lies 1&deg; 29' 23" E. of the
Bay of Matanzas, whereas the map has it only 35 miles. This very
serious error is the cause of the loss of many ships."</p>
<p>After leaving Florida, the "Providence" and the "Assistant,"
with the other vessels, steered a northeasterly course across the
Atlantic to Cape Clear on the Irish coast.</p>
<p>In describing his last voyage to the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, Bligh says: "I only met a few small American vessels
bound to Oporto and the Windward Islands coming across the
Atlantic. H. M. Packet 'Antelope' with one Liverpool and one
Bristol ship have kept under our convoy, and by the former, who now
leaves us, I transmit this to your Lordships. I am sorry to inform
your Lordships that H.M.S. 'Hyaena' was. taken by a line-of-battle
ship and a 44 off Cape Tiberoon".</p>
<p>The "Providence" and "Assistant" arrived off Ireland on July
27th in thick and foggy weather. Finding no vessels awaiting them
as Captain Bligh's orders had led him to expect, the ships bore
away to the southward, and on the 29th, when 14 leagues westward of
Scilly, fell in with the Windward Islands Convoy consisting of
H.M.S. "Charon" flying the broad pennant of Commodore Dodds, H.M.S.
"Centurion," and H.M.S. "Scorpion". Captain Bligh went on board the
commodore's ship and obtained permission to proceed to port. After
passing the Needles, the "Providence" and "Assistant" first
anchored off Dungeness on August 2nd, then worked up to the Downs,
where at 11 a.m. they saluted the Flag of Admiral Peyton with
fifteen guns, which "was returned with cheers," and came to, when
Captain Bligh called upon the Admiral.</p>
<p>On August 7th the ships anchored at Deptford.</p>
<p>The last entries in the log are as follows:--</p>
<p>"Friday, August 9th, our Otaheitan friend<sup>*</sup> became so
ill that I was obliged to send him to lodgings and sick quarters at
Deptford.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mydiddee.]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, September 4th, our Otaheitan friend died.</p>
<p>"Friday, September 6th, our Otaheitan friend was buried at
Deptford New Church Yard in the parish of St. Paul's. I shall ever
remember him with esteem.</p>
<p>"This voyage has terminated with success, without accident or a
moment's separation of the two ships. It gives the first and only
satisfactory accounts of the pass between New Guinea and New
Holland, if I except some vague accounts of Torres in 1606; other
interesting discoveries will be found in it.</p>

LIEUTENANT PORTLOCK.</h2>
<p>The muster-roll of the "Assistant," if it survives, is not at
the Record Office, but the following is a list of the
officers<sup>*</sup> and crew recommended for promotion by Mr.
Portlock:--</p>
<p class="note">[* Wm. Terry, quartermaster, deceased, was also on
board the "Assistant".]</p>
<p>George Watson -- Master.</p>

<p>Richard Wallace -- Sailmaker.</p>
<p>Francis Wilson -- Boatswain's mate.</p>
<p>(Signed) Nathaniel Portlock, Lieutenant and Commander.</p>
<p>Many of Bligh's officers afterwards distinguished themselves.
The later exploits of Francis Godolphin Bond, to give him his full
title, are related in the <i>Naval Chronicle</i> of 1799-1801,
when, in command of the schooner "Netley," he was actively engaged
in capturing French and Spanish privateers, and in retaking English
ships from the enemy.</p>
<p>George Tobin on his return to England heard that Captain Nelson,
afterwards Lord Nelson, had kept a third lieutenancy on board his
ship the "Agamemnon" open for him for some time. This may not have
been entirely on account of his record, as Nelson through his wife
was connected with Tobin's family. In writing to his wife, however,
in 1796, Nelson asked, "What is to become of George Tobin? He is a
fine young man. It is a pity he has not got more forward." Tobin
was then in the "Thetis" frigate with Captain Alexander Cochrane.
In the following year, Nelson again wrote, "The time is past for
doing anything for George Tobin: had he been with me he would long
since have been a Captain, and I should have liked it, being
exceedingly pleased with him". Tobin was made commander in 1798,
and captain in 1802. One of his most brilliant successes was when
the "Princess Charlotte," disguised by him as a merchantman,
captured the French vessel "Cyane" off Tobago. This was not
achieved without a hard-fought action.</p>
<p>Matthew Flinders' work is so well known that it need not be
dwelt upon here. His accurate survey of the greater part of the
Australian coast has been the basis of our modern charts, and has
placed him in the front rank of Australian navigators. It is to be
noted by the way, that in his story of the passage of Bligh's ships
between New Guinea and Australia, he gives every credit to his
commander, and to Mr. Portlock. Flinders says, "Perhaps no space of
3&frac12;&deg; in length presents more dangers than Torres Strait, but with
caution and perseverance, Captains Bligh and Portlock proved them
to be surmountable".</p>
<p>A portion of Nathaniel Portlock's journal is given in the
following pages--from the time of the "Assistant's" arrival at
Wytootackee until she had passed through "Bligh's Farewell". He was
a well-known navigator, having entered the Navy in 1772, and in
1776 was rated as master's mate on board the "Discovery" by Captain
Charles Clerke. He continued in her during Cook's celebrated
voyage, and in 1779, as his log-book relates, served in the
"Resolution". In 1780 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant,
and joined the "Firebrand," one of the Channel Fleet. In 1785 he
started on his voyage to the north-west coast of America in command
of the "King George," a vessel of 320 tons, He held this
appointment under the King George's Sound Company, an undertaking
designed to promote the fur trade which seems to have had the
support of the British Government. His voyage was successful, and
the story of his explorations was published by him on his
return.</p>
<p>The extracts from his journal written on board the "Assistant"
are added to this narrative of Bligh's voyage, not only because he
was second in command of the expedition, but also because, as has
been stated elsewhere, the "Assistant" invariably led the
"Providence" when exploring difficult waters, and when there was
not sufficient depth to afford a safe passage for the "Providence,"
it was Captain Bligh's custom to dispatch the brig to find a way
alone. Portlock writes very interestingly, and gives details not
found in the commander's diary.</p>
<p>Bligh's journal, it may be mentioned, is for the most part in
the handwriting of his clerk, Mr. Hatfull, although it is corrected
and added to by Bligh himself. Portlock's writings, particularly
where he tells of how he led through Fiji, and weathered Kandavu,
constitute very valuable early records of the colony. Only a
portion of his journal is at the Record Office, and Flinders'
log-book is not all there either. Tobin's is complete, and
contains, moreover, very skilfully executed drawings in water
colour of Adventure Bay, and of the natives of Tahiti, Fiji, and
various other places. Reproductions of these are included in the
present volume. The illustration of Adventure Bay was reproduced
with an article in the <i>Geograplalcal Journal</i> and is believed
to be the only drawing by Tobin published hitherto. On Portlock's
return to England he was raised to the rank of commander. In 1799
he commanded the "Arrow" sloop, and on September 9th captured the
Dutch ship "Draack". His health in later years was not good, and in
1816 he was admitted to Greenwich Hospital, where he died on
September 12th, 1817, after a short but severe illness.</p>
<p>Mr. Portlock describes the natives of Wytootackee<sup>*</sup>
and gives an account of his ship's passage through the Vavau Group,
Fiji, the New Hebrides, and Torres Strait in the following
pages:--</p>
<p>"July 25th, 1792. At 10 rounded the north part of the
island,<sup>*</sup> the natives thick upon the beaches and several
canoes paddling along shore within the reef, and soon afterwards
came alongside. In one of the canoes there appeared to be three men
of note, and one of them I took to be a priest, as he had in each
hand a piece of white cloth, made up like the Otaheitan bonnets,
and a branch of the cocoanut tree, which he handed to me. I
considered them as a token of peace and friendship, and the man
repeated a number of words which I suppose to be a prayer. I made a
suitable return, and several of them came into the ship, and made
the common South Sea mode of saluting by joining noses.</p>
<p class="note">[* Wytootackee (now Aitutaki).]</p>
<p>"A friendly trade commenced, and for nails, beads, and rings,
they parted with anything they had in their canoes, and some of
them stript themselves of their cloth and threw it into the ship. I
made a point of rewarding their liberality by giving them large
towes and spike nails which delight them. They brought plantains
and cocoanuts, and I saw pieces of drest breadfruit in one
canoe.</p>
<p>"I procured from them some small pieces of cloth, two small
mats, four paddles, five spears, and three gorgets. Their cloth is
much like that of the Friendly Islands, being stout, and some of it
prettily glazed, and printed in a very regular manner, red, black,
and white in small squares.</p>
<p>"Their mats were small and coarsely made, and wrought with more
taste than the Otaheitans' mat, being made with different coloured
rushes, which has a pretty effect. Their paddles are five feet
seven inches long and nine inches broad, neatly made, and pains
taken to ornament them. One side of the blade nearly at the grasp
is cut out like Cornish work, and on the other side just above the
point of the paddle is a ridge of about half an inch above the
surface of the blade. Besides ornamenting they take pains in
staining them with a black dye in variety as their fancy directs.
Their spears are about twelve feet and thick in proportion, some of
them of the hard toa, very much barbed near the point, others of
bamboo pointed with toa wood, and one I got pointed with pieces of
the sun-ray's tail, and must be a very dangerous weapon. I also got
one weapon about eight feet long, made of toa tree and shaped like
an officer's spontoon.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* A kind of halberd formerly serving as the
distinguishing arm for certain officers of the British
Infantry.]</p>
<p>"Their gorgets are suspended from the neck with a wreath of
human hair down below the chin, and whether for ornament or service
I cannot say, but I incline to think for both. It looks very well,
and may in battle fend off a blow from a spear. It is of a single
large pearl shell six inches in diameter, worked by some means so
as to look very smooth and beautiful. I also got another ornament
which they wear about the neck or head. This was of the palm nut
strung upon a beautiful pink-coloured rush. I am inclined to think
the rush is stained, others think not.</p>
<p>"The people in general are above the common height, and
remarkably well-made, and have something of the wild look of the
New Zealander; their language is, I think, more like that of New
Zealand than the Otaheitan, and the manner of speaking quicker than
the Otaheitan, and by no means so soft and pleasant. They asked for
a hatchet by the same name as the New Zealanders, that is 'togey '.
These people are tattooed about the legs, arms, and bodies. Mr.
Franklin observed to me that he saw a man cut upon the arm like a
native of Africa, but I could not see these myself, and think it is
not general, but made by an accident.</p>
<p>"In one canoe were three women of, I should judge, upwards of
thirty years of age, stout, poorly clad, and not at all desirable.
One of them had lost an eye, and had scarcely cloth enough to cover
her waist. However, they were very cheerful and delighted at the
sight of the ships. One of the officers says he observed the women
were as much tattooed as the men.</p>
<p>"The canoes of this little spot are double and single kind, and
more numerous than might be supposed from its size. We saw upwards
of a dozen--none carrying less than five men, the long single ones
carrying some eight and some ten, and the double ones of which we
saw four had at least sixteen men; the single canoes have
outriggers. All the men in these were armed with spears and the
weapon like the spontoon.</p>
<p>"The canoes are made from a single tree hollowed out, and kept
exceedingly white and clean, and ornamented all round with a kind
of little red pea with a black eye stuck on the outside of the
canoe, and strengthened by a piece of wood one and a half inches
thick, that is securely lashed within and just below the gunwale.
The largest was forty feet, and between the gunwale one foot four
inches wide, minosing to about two feet in the middle, and round at
the bottom. They are, too, very handsomely finished, tapering away
gradually towards each end, and terminating in a blunt point. Some
of the large canoes had a kind of gallows erected in the stern,
about six feet high and decorated with many man-of-war birds'
feathers.</p>
<p>"The men have good manly countenances, and are in general stout
and strongly made, their hair in some worn short, in others very
long. In general it was black, some few had light or
reddish-coloured hair; these I supposed to be stained by a kind of
clay. Some of the older men had long beards, some appeared to be
closely shaved by shell or other means, and several had their faces
painted entirely black, I think with soot. I made them several
presents with which they were much pleased, and they were fair in
their dealings with us. One poor fellow was struck very much with
the forelock of the ship's pump, and desired to take it away with
him. He looked at it very often, but the chain that it hung by was
too strong for him. He viewed it as a monkey would, and left it
quite in a pet and disappointed. At noon we made sail, and the
natives quitted the ship, and the canoe left us and paddled in
shore.</p>
<p>"This island is about eight miles in circuit; on the east side
which had not such a good appearance as the west, I observed many
cocoanut trees with their tops blown off as if from the violence of
the wind. Soon afterwards the Commodore hailed and desired me to
pick up two Indians that had jumped overboard from his ship when
the canoes paddled off to the shore, and would not pick them up. I
made sail to the leeward-most of them, and drifting down we took
one in abreast of the main chains: he was so far spent that he
could not approach the vessel. Two men were obliged to help him
into the ship...a canoe picked up the other. The one I had taken
got round. I gave him two large towes, and put him in the same
canoe, and he left us highly pleased.</p>
<p>"July 30th. I found the plants flourishing; some few in the
starboard quarter gallery have been wet with salt water, but do not
show any bad effect from it.</p>
<p>"July 31st. Hazy weather, constant rain, so much so that we
cannot see Savage Island, although we are not eighteen miles from
it.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, August 1st. Dark heavy clouds and rain. Saw bonetos
and some tropic birds, different in plumage to most others I have
seen, having the edges of the wing feathers tipped with black. They
dart into the water after fish as do the gannets of the Cape of
Good Hope and Adventure Bay from a considerable height. At 5 p.m.
saw Savage Island from the foretop masthead, the body bearing W. by
S., distant six miles. This island is small, low, and remarkably
flat. Made the signal for seeing land, which the Commodore
answered, and acquainted me that I should steer northward of the
island: at midnight, no land in sight, having passed it in the
night.</p>
<p>"August 2nd. At half past five the Commodore signalled to come
within hail, brought to, and spoke. He acquainted me that he
intended to steer W.S.W. to-night. At daylight brisk gales.</p>
<p>"August 3rd. Dark cloudy weather. The Commodore acquainted me
that he should steer W. &frac12; S. for the night, and apprehended passing
in with islands here laid down by Spanish Navigators. Recommended a
good lookout to be kept. At eight it cleared up well. At half past
eleven saw the land, the extremities in sight, islands from W.N.W.
to N.W. &frac12; N., the distance two leagues. Lat. 18&deg; 29' 09" S., 185&deg;
59'. Maurelle's first discovered isle from S. 19 to S. 75, distant
from body three leagues. It was singularly fortunate it was so fair
as to give us a sight of the land. Had it remained such weather as
we have experienced for some nights and days past, we should most
likely have struck the shore before we saw it, as we were just
steering for the low land to the southward, therefore we have a
very recent instance of the care and protection of Divine
Providence over us, and for which I am sure we cannot be thankful
enough. About 6 o'clock saw the land again. Wore ship and stood off
for good daylight. At half past six, wore ships again, and stood in
shore.</p>
<p>"Daylight gave us a good sight of an island extending from S.
73&deg; W. to about 86&deg; W., distant from the body of the island about
three leagues. This island<sup>*</sup> towards the northern
extremity is of a very moderate height, and the N.E. and N. points
made very much like the Forelands but something higher. This
moderate height of land extends from the north part to about the
middle of the island, and then is terminated by a remarkable Table
Hill.<sup>**</sup> From this to the southern extreme is low land,
and in some places bore the appearance of islands. (I am inclined
to think that the land is all connected except a little isle on the
eastern side.) The lower lands are well wooded, the summit of the
higher lands thinly clad with trees. I saw few on the sides of the
hills. At eight fresh breezes and squally weather. The extremes of
the island from W. to S.W. &frac12; S. are distant from N.E. point about
two leagues. The north point of the island bore S. 81&deg; 00' W., the
variation 9 E., consequently we were exactly in its latitude (it
lays in a S.S.W. and N.N.E. direction). We cannot say much about
the anchorage, and the most likely place, for so it appeared to me,
was at the termination of the higher land to the southward (where
there appeared some bend in the shore) with the Table Hill bearing
S. 60&deg; 00' East.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mayorga of Maurelle.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Moungalafa (Vavau Group).]</p>
<p>"About half past eleven the man at the masthead discovered a
high round island to the S.W., and very soon after discovered
another island from the masthead. This island lay to the N.W. At
noon the extremes of the first discovered island S. 19&deg; 00' E. and
S. 95&deg; 00' E., judge our distance offshore nine miles. The second
discovered island S. 42&deg; W. and S. 45&deg; W., distant eight or nine
leagues, and the third discovered island N.N.W. &frac12; W., distant about
ten leagues.<sup>*</sup> Lat. 18&deg; 20' 46", long. 184&deg; 41' E., by
obs. 185&deg; 28'. Captain Bligh 184&deg; 35'.</p>
<p class="note">[* The first island seen was Mayorga, Late next,
and then the northernmost Amagura.]</p>
<p>"August 4th. At 1.40 the extremes of the first discovered island
bore S. 76&deg; 00' S. and S. 58' 00' E., distant six leagues.
Immediately afterwards it became thick and rainy, and we lost sight
of the land at five.</p>
<p>"The Commodore informed me if the weather continued thick that
he would not run during the night, but keep our present situation
until daylight. I thought it a proper and prudent measure...At
eight the second discovered island in sight.</p>
<p>"August 5th. At half past five the Commodore acquainted me of
his intention of running at night as the weather is fine. At half
past ten a.m. the Commodore made the signal for seeing land. Saw
the easternmost of Bligh Islands<sup>*</sup> bearing S. W. &frac12; W.,
distant eight leagues.<sup>**</sup> At noon the same island S.
44.&deg;W., distant seven leagues, and what appear at this distance a
cluster of Hummock Isles bearing N. 70&deg; W. distant seven leagues;
the land in sight appears of a moderate height and tolerably well
wooded. Smokes on several parts of the island.</p>

<p>"August 6th. Moderate breezes and pleasant weather. At 1 p.m.
saw an island bearing W.N.W., and saw some breakers extending from
the east point of the northernmost island first seen. Hauled more
to the southward. Soon afterwards saw extensive rocks and breakers
extending from the east end of the southernmost rocks first
seen.</p>
<p>"The breakers are composed of sandy shoals nearly even with the
surface of the sea, and appear to lay off in an E.N.E. direction
five or six miles. There is a break in them, and the outer reef
appears 1&frac12; miles in extent. The inner reef appears to connect with
a small island laying to S. 25&deg; W. The reef from the north island
runs off in an easterly direction for about four miles from the
shore, and appears composed of black rock. About three p.m. saw
another shoal<sup>*</sup> laying between the southernmost and
northernmost island and detached from both. We shaped a course to
go between it and the south island, reefed top sails, and made snug
for standing on and off under the lee of the island<sup>**</sup>
for the night.</p>
<p class="note">[* Thakau Lekaleka, between Oneata and Mothe.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Mothe.]</p>
<p>"In running along shore saw some natives on the beaches, and two
canoes. Within the reef the islands were tolerably well wooded. I
could see cocoanut trees. Employed during the night making short
tacks under the lee of the island, in course of which a canoe with
two Indians came off to the 'Providence'. They brought cocoanuts
with them which they readily handed into the ships, and were highly
pleased with the towes and trinkets they received.</p>
<p>"At half past seven a.m. they bore away, and another canoe with
four natives in her had by this time got on board the 'Providence'.
They also brought some cocoanuts which they handed into the ship,
and parted with a few spears and clubs, much like those of the
Friendly Islands. They left the ship on her making sail. At noon
pleasant breeze with fine weather. Islands in sight all round,
fourteen in number, I think mostly small, of moderate height and
well wooded.</p>
<p>"August 7th. Moderate breezes and fair pleasant weather. At four
p.m. passing between two islands<sup>*</sup> of moderate height
(three or four leagues distance from each other). At five,
shortened sail. At half past five the Commodore made the signal to
come within hail; hove to; the Commodore acquainted me that he
intended to lay to for the night.</p>
<p class="note">[* Naiau and Vanua Vatu Islands.]</p>
<p>"At seven, extreme of an island N. 20&deg; E. and N. 30&deg; E.,
distance thirteen leagues, the body of an island S.E. &frac12; S., another
N. 76&deg; 00' W. This forenoon cleared an island bearing N. 81&deg; E. and
N. 89&deg; E. Lump Island N. 31&deg; E., small island N. 18&deg; E., and a
large island bearing N. 19&deg; W. and N. 31&deg; W., distance eight
leagues. We observed smokes on most of the islands, and three
sailing canoes attempted to join us but could not come up.</p>
<p>"August 8th. Moderate breezes. A large island bearing N. 13&deg; W.
and N. 27&deg; W., and some small hummocks laying off the W. point of
the large island N. 32&deg; W. I am inclined to think the hummocks to
be a part of large islands;<sup>*</sup> at half past five the body
of the large island N. 47&deg; W. and N. 22&deg; W., distance seven
leagues. An island S. 83&deg; W. and S. 87&deg; W., distance nine leagues.
An island bearing N., distance eight leagues.</p>
<p class="note">[* Taviuni.]</p>
<p>"We counted thirteen large and small islands.</p>
<p>"At midnight the Commodore acquainted me of his determination of
giving up the idea of making a passage through the northern parts
of this great cluster, and to steer instead for a passage between
two islands<sup>*</sup> that lay to the westward, lat. 18&deg; 01' S.
and 180&deg; 01' E.</p>
<p class="note">[* Nairai and Ngau Island.]</p>
<p>"August 9th. About half past one we were close into the reef of
a most beautiful island,<sup>*</sup> and coy'd away to S.W., and
ran along the reef at a distance of four miles. The reef extends
from the beach about one mile, and about three miles to the
eastward of the north point is a break in the reef of about a
quarter of a mile wide and promises for a good
harbour.<sup>**</sup> One mile from the north to the eastward is
another break in the reef of about a quarter of a mile which
promises well for a good little harbour. It first takes a turn to
the S.W. and there appears a fine harbour perfectly sheltered by
the reefs.</p>
<p class="note">[* Ngau.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Probably Herald Bay.]</p>
<p>"On our way down alongshore I saw numbers of natives on the
beach, I suppose amounting to many hundreds and some canoes within
the reef.<sup>*</sup> About four I led round the north point of the
reef and hauled to southward bordering another two miles of reef.
Three canoes attempted to join us but could not. An appearance of a
spacious harbour was formed by the north-west and west point of the
island trending in an east direction, and the distance from the
point about two miles. There was also an appearance of a harbour to
the northward of the north-west point.</p>
<p class="note">[* Encircling Ngau.]</p>
<p>"From the quantity of leaves, rushes, and other stuff that were
opposite these openings in a kind of tide line I should suppose
there was a river. There was an abundance of cocoanut and other
trees and the island had a most delightful appearance and stretched
to the southward. At five, tacked ships and made sail to south and
stood to south-south-west. An island in sight northwest by north.
Another south by west to south-west &frac12; west. Another west by north
and west &frac14; north, lat. 18&deg; 30' S., 178&deg; 53' E.</p>
<p>"August 10th. Commodore made signal to come within hail. At the
time were about four or five miles from a reef<sup>*</sup> that
lies a considerable way off an island that Commodore Bligh intended
to pass down on its north side on our route to westward. There were
a number of small straggling islands that lay off the coast which
made the passage between this island and one to the northward of us
uncertain and dangerous. I had just edged away to lead round the
west point of the reef (which reef I judge to be detached) when the
Commodore made his signal, on my coming within hail. The Commodore
informed me he was not quite satisfied about the safety of the
passage we were standing for, and that he determined to weather the
island<sup>**</sup> and pass down on its south side, the surest
passage, particularly as he conceived this island to be the
southernmost of the cluster.</p>
<p class="note">[* North Astrolabe Reef.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Kandavu.]</p>
<p>"Just as we tacked I saw two sailing canoes, one large and one
small, standing out from between two of the small islands, and saw
several smokes about the country. These two small islands lay off
from about the north-east point of the island, and to the westward
of them the land of the main island appears to take a deep bend as
if in the formation of a deep bay. This island has the highest land
on it of any of the cluster, particularly a high Table Hill, near
the western extreme of it, or rather a high mountain, round at the
sides, and flattish on the top.<sup>*</sup> The country appears
well wooded, and there is little doubt but that all of them are
well inhabited. On our standing out to the north-east, we lost
sight of the canoes. I think they put for the shore again.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mbuke Levu or Mt. Washington.]</p>
<p>"Captain Bligh in his launch when he left Tofoa stood a course
for these islands west-north-west, which was the direction the
Friendly Islanders described the Feejee Islands to lie in, and by
pursuing that course fell in with these islands. There can,
therefore, remain but little doubt of their being the Feejee
Islands that the Friendly Islanders speak so much about, whose
inhabitants they seem to fear, and speak of as great warriors who
make use of poisoned arrows in battle.</p>
<p>"Tasman it appears in 1643 fell in with the eastern or small
cluster of this group, and gave to it the name of Prince Williams
Isles, but certainly Captain Bligh is the discoverer of the western
or large group. They are all together, and are a prodigious fine
group of islands, and their inhabitants very much resemble the
Friendly Islanders in person and manners. Those that were off to
the 'Providence' had joints cut from the little finger, and their
hair stained with clay or lime, exactly the same as those islanders
do.</p>
<p>"We are rather unfortunate in not getting observations the last
two days either for latitude or longitude to determine the exact
situation of this southernmost island of the cluster, but as it is
laid down here it cannot be mistaken, or in but a very few miles if
any. At eight a.m. the island that we are attempting to weather
bore from south-south-west &frac14; west to west by south distant five
leagues. At noon the island we are attempting to weather bore S.
22&deg; W. and S. 30&deg; W. distant seven leagues. Observation an
indifferent one, gave latitude 18&deg; 39' 11" S.</p>
<p>"August 11th. At 4 p.m. the extremes of the south
island<sup>*</sup> in sight 172&deg; 00' W. and S. 54&deg; 00' W., distant
five leagues, and the body of the small islands west distant six
leagues. At six the south-east point of the South Island bearing S.
50&deg; 00' W., distant five leagues. A high mountain in the same
island S. 69&deg; 00' W. At midnight made and shortened sail to keep
our station. At four a.m. a good lookout is absolutely necessary as
should we fall in with anything the weather is so thick and the
night so dark that we should see breakers before we could properly
see land. Half past four, cleared up a little. At eight, South
Island in sight bearing N. 56&deg; 30' W. to N. 48&deg; 30' W., the flat or
Table Mount N. 55&deg; 20' W., distant 10 leagues. No other Island but
South Island in sight, therefore I conclude we are clear of this
large group of islands.</p>
<p class="note">[* Kandavu.]</p>
<p>"August 12th. At eight, fresh breezes and thick weather, hauled
the wind on the starboard tack and continued to sail. I am
unfortunately situated at present; the master and two master's
mates being laid up. Lat. 19&deg; 03" 02' S., and long. 178&deg; 02' E.,
Captain Bligh 177&deg; 13' E.</p>
<p>"August 13th. Answered in the affirmative signal of the
Commodore to dine on board the 'Providence'.</p>
<p>"August 14th. At half past one the Commodore sent his whaleboat
for me. At two tacked ship and stood to the north-west. At half
past five returned from the 'Providence' and soon afterwards made
sail with a fine breeze from south-south-east.</p>
<p>"August 15th. At midnight moderate with dark cloudy weather.</p>
<p>"August 16th. Saw several tropic birds and some sheerwaters.</p>
<p>"August 17th. Saw several tropic birds and passed a piece of
stick and substance in the water that looked like the fruit of the
Otaheitans. At half past seven bore away under easy sail to keep
company with the Commodore. About nine passed through a remarkable
rippling of a current and observed small luminous appearance in the
sea. At midnight a multitude of porpoises about the ships. The
weather at daylight remarkably heavy owing to our drawing near
land, as we judge ourselves within 100 miles of the Hebrides. Lat.
13&deg; 36' S., 170&deg; 49' E. by reckoning.</p>
<p>"August 18th. At eight a.m. moderate breezes and close cloudy
weather. The sea remarkably smooth because I judge of our having
part of the Hebrides to windward of us.</p>
<p>"Sunday, August 19th. At half past two p.m., saw a high island
bearing south-west, distant eight leagues. Made the signal to the
Commodore for seeing land in the south-west quarter which he
answered. Saw another small island bearing south-south-west,
distant eight leagues. This island makes very like the hill at the
Cape of Good Hope called the Lion's Rump. These are a part of the
islands discovered by Captain Bligh in his launch
(1789).<sup>*</sup> They lay to the northward of the Hebrides. At
four saw another high island bearing from south-west by south to
south-west &frac12; west, distant nine leagues. At half past five saw some
small isles and rocks bearing N. 55&deg; W., distant five leagues.
About this time the Commodore signalled that he intended standing
off and on for the night. Made and shortened sail to keep our
station. Lat. 13&deg; 27' S., 169&deg; 20' E. Island A,<sup>**</sup> S. 45&deg;
30' W. and S. 25&deg; 00' W. Island B,<sup>***</sup> S. 12&deg; 00' W. and
S. 3&deg; 31' W. Island C,<sup>****</sup> 23&deg; 30' W. and S. 52&deg; 00' W.
At 8 stood to W.S.W. and edged away more to the westward as we
approached the land, and during the forenoon passed Island A at the
distance of about 8 miles and steered to the westward. These
islands are all of them well wooded, and I could perceive cocoanut
trees in abundance, but could not distinguish the others. Some
appeared like the breadfruit tree and others like the Towa tree.
Many of them appeared very much blighted. Towards noon we were
abreast of Island E which is a high woody island. On the north
side<sup>*****</sup> appears a well-sheltered and tolerable deep
bay.</p>

<p>"To the westward of this bay I saw people who appeared to be as
light coloured as the Otaheitans. In several places I saw smoke.
This is the only island of the cluster where we saw signs of
inhabitants, but most likely they are all peopled. At the bottom of
the bay the country had a pleasant appearance of verdure, but in
many other places it was much parched with the sun, in particular
the cocoanut trees which made a small border at the foot of the
hills. I could see no plantain trees nor yet any houses. No canoes
or boats made their appearance and we stood on to the westward. 13&deg;
27' S. and 69&deg; 20' E.</p>
<p>"August 20th. At half past noon saw other islands bearing about
W.S.W., distance 7 leagues. These islands from the view we had of
them were of very moderate height and in some parts appeared wood.
We saw no signs of inhabitants. At three hauled in the studding
sails in order to pass down the south side of these
islands.<sup>*</sup> One of the islands last seen now bore S. 66&deg;
W. and S. 75&deg; W., distant 5 leagues. Another S. 84.&deg; W. and S. 87&deg;
W., distant 6 leagues. Another N. 83&deg; W. and N. 69&deg; W., 7 leagues.
About six the Commodore hailed me, and told me of his intention of
standing off and on all night. At daylight no land in sight, bore
away to the W. by South; a brisk breeze and showery weather. Made
all sail. Saw multitudes of flying fish and a few large petrel. 13&deg;
51' S., 168&deg; 14' E.</p>
<p class="note">[* The Torres Group.]</p>
<p>"August 21st. Saw a booby and a large flock of noddies. At ten
wore ship. The Commodore hailed and acquainted me of his intention
of tacking every 2 hours. Passed by a piece of sugar cane and a
small piece of wood.</p>
<p>"August 22nd. At noon a fine breeze with pleasant weather.</p>
<p>"August 23rd. Saw boobies, sheerwaters, and tropic birds.
Multitudes of flying fish, some large, and numbers not above an
inch long. At half past six spoke to the Commodore who acquainted
me of his intention of running all night and asked me to lead as
usual. During the night several flying fish caught on deck; the
cats watch for them narrowly all night and get a good meal. The
fish is scarcely on deck before they have it. 13&deg; 41' S., 159&deg; 31'
E.</p>
<p>"August 24th. Saw white boobies and tropic birds. Half past 6
the Commodore acquainted me of his intention of running all night
providing the weather continued fine. Passed a large part of a tree
and two branches this day. 13&deg; 31' S., 157&deg; 13' E.</p>
<p>"August 25th. Moderate breezes and cloudy. At 8 p.m. very fine
weather. Ran all night and shortened sail to keep the 'Providence'
up with us.</p>
<p>"August 26th. At half past six spoke to the Commodore, and he
acquainted me of his intention of standing on all night and of
altering the course W. by N. 12&deg; 33' S., 152&deg; 24' E.</p>
<p>"August 27th. Just now coming into Mr. Bougainville's traverse
near the coast of the Louisiade, therefore the Commodore thought we
might run with more safety than we have done for some nights past.
He directed me to lead as usual.</p>
<p>"August 28th. About 4 p.m. the midshipman that had the lookout
at the masthead called out that he saw an appearance of land.</p>
<p>"I immediately went up and found that what he supposed to be
land to be a very large, awful, and beautiful water spout bearing
W. &frac12; S. The spout proceeded from a small black cloud about 15&deg; from
the horizon running in a zig-zag in the most beautiful manner, and
frequently altering its size and shape until within about 5&deg; or 6&deg;
of the horizon, and there it joined a large column of water in size
to our sight of that of a large Church tower, which frequently
altered its position and appeared exceedingly agitated being, as it
were, all in a smoke from the force that it was either ascending or
descending. The water spout, where it joined the cloud, appeared
about the size of a man's body growing smaller towards the end. It
continued plainly for half-an-hour and then it disappeared. It
never approached nearer to us than three or four miles, therefore
we were not under apprehension of danger from it. Some seamen
assert, I daresay with truth, that they are destructive to ships or
anything else that cornes under their influence. 11&deg; 34' S., 149
56' 30' E. Captain Bligh 149&deg; 00' E.</p>
<p>"At nine caught a noddy in the sweep, beautiful in its shape, it
is about the size of a pigeon, glossy dark brown, except the crown
of the head which is tinged with a light colour. It allowed itself
to be taken when awake and was not shy of the hand that caught it,
therefore, I conclude, it cornes from some uninhabited island. At 5
a.m., when it was good daylight, I left the deck, there was then a
heavy dew for the first time (excepting once) since we left
Otaheite. This forenoon saw a large flock of egg-birds and tropic
birds and passed some drift-wood and rock-weed.</p>
<p>"August 29th. The Commodore acquainted me of his intention of
standing on all night and steering W.N.W. and directed me to lead
with a light as usual.</p>
<p>"About this time the master reported to me that during the
forenoon he had seen pass a stick that appeared very much like a
white studding-sail boom. It was great neglect of his duty his not
mentioning the matter to me as I had given orders than when leaves,
rock-weed, or anything drifting was seen I might be acquainted of
it. If I had known or had any idea that it really was a
studding-sail boom or any other ship's spar I most certainly would
have hoist a boat out, and picked it up, judging it must have
belonged to a ship lost at sea hereabouts or cast on shore or some
coast not far distant. My alarm would have certainly been for Mr.
P&eacute;rouse who is missing, and I understand had orders to visit these
seas and explore the coasts of these islands.</p>
<p>"August 30th. At 6 the Commodore made my signal to come within
hail, answered it and hauled our wind to the southward. The
Commodore acquainted me of his intention to run all night. Birds
about all night.</p>
<p>"At 6 made the coast of New Guinea, appearing of a very moderate
height, and bearing thus the easternmost extreme N. 53&deg; E., distant
TO leagues. The highest hill N. 43L E., distant 10 leagues. A bluff
point N. 42&frac12; E., distant 9 leagues. The westernmost extreme in
sight N. 31&frac12; E., distant 9 leagues.</p>
<p>"This part of the coast appears to fall back something to the
northwards, and I think there is little doubt that it is either the
westernmost land seen by Mr. Bougainville or a continuation of it.
We lost sight of the land in steering a W.N.W. course, and by noon
could scarce perceive it from the masthead. Some faint appearance
of very distant high land bore N.W. and N.N.W. About 10 passed a
turtle. No drift-wood or rock-weed seen this 24 hours. Lat. 10&deg; 02'
S., 146&deg; 48' E.</p>
<p>"August 31st. At half past noon saw land making in two
moderately high-peaked mountains. The easternmost bearing N. 26&deg; E.
and the westernmost bearing N. 23&deg; E. Our distance I judge from
them to be 14 leagues. They appear to have a connection with the
land seen this morning.</p>
<p>"We continued to steer W. N. W., and by four o'clock lost sight
of the mountains. At 6 when it was sunset, could see no certain
appearance of the land except to the N.N.W., and that was very
faint, and if land could not be less than 15 leagues distance as it
was clear enough to see that distance at this time. The Commodore
acquainted me of his intention to run all night, or a west by north
course. During the night we had several noddies about the ship;
several settled on our yards. At noon a gentle breeze, not an
appearance of land in sight.</p>
<p>"September 1st. Pleasant weather. Saw noddies and tropic birds.
At 5 saw breakers on the starboard bow 1&frac12; to 2&frac12; miles away. Made
the signal to the 'Providence' and hauled to the north-east. This
reef<sup>*</sup> appeared about half a mile broad and 2&frac14; long,
trending in a S.E. and N.W. direction. The north point laying in
Lat. 9&deg; 27' 29" S. and longitude 144 53' 4" E. At half past 5 a.m.
bore away. At 7 saw breakers on the starboard bearing S.E. by W.,
distant 8 miles. At half past 7 the Commodore told me of his
intention of steering some distance to the southward in hopes of
seeing the termination of the reef and directed me to lead. We
stood to south until 10&frac14; at which time breakers were seen
distinctly bearing as far south as S. 25&deg; W ., distance 2
miles.</p>
<p class="note">[* Named by Bligh Portlock's Reef.]</p>
<p>"This reef appears to join the first discovered reef, and the
extreme point that we could distinctly see formed a bay bending
into the westward. We could now only lay south with a current
setting us down on the reef. The Commodore therefore determined
upon trying the north part. We accordingly tacked and stood to
N.E.</p>
<p>"At noon the southernmost breakers out of sight, and the
extremes of the breakers in sight bore N.W. and W. by S., distance
8 miles. I make the south point of the breakers in Lat. 9&deg; 43' 22"
S. and 144&deg; 53' 16" E.</p>
<p>"September 2nd. Until 2 p.m. we steered N.E. &frac12; N. to get to
windward of the first discovered reef, then edged away N. &frac12; W.
until 4 p.m., then judging that we were far enough north of the
reef bore away to westward. At sunset the Commodore acquainted me
of his intention of spending the night on a wind making short
tacks.</p>
<p>"The first discovered reef was seen from the 'Providence's'
masthead bearing south, distance 8 or 9 miles. At 6 a.m. bore away
and made sail to the westward; towards ten the water appeared
coloured as if we were in sounding, and was also affected by a tide
or current for in several places there were strong ripples. At half
past eleven saw breakers bearing N. 70&deg; W. to N. 83&deg; W., distance 7
miles. Made the signal, hauled in our studding-sail, and 4 before
noon hauled our wind to southward. At noon the breakers distance 6
miles and the sea broke very high on them. Broached a second cask
of Otaheite pork. Thank God all hands in perfect health and
spirits.</p>
<p>"September 3rd. At &frac34; past noon made a small sandy key, distance
8 miles. We stood to the southward in hopes of finding a
termination to the reef, and made the signal to the Commodore for
seeing land.</p>
<p>"At half past one we gained good sounding in 40 fathoms over a
red coral bottom, and immediately afterwards saw a shoal bearing S.
East by E. 2 cables. Tacked ship and made the signals to the
Commodore. At the time we saw the sandy key there was a reef
extending from it S.S.W. &frac12; W., distant from us 8 miles, which was
as far as the eye could discern the breakers, but I have little
doubt they extended still farther southward and eastward and
perhaps connect with the Eastern Reefs. Saw a whale, boobies, and
noddies, and flocks of white birds the size of a pigeon which I
suppose to be egg-birds. As appearances were rather against our
safety, we made stretches during the afternoon and stood on short
tacks during the night. Coral rock and broken shells: I led during
the night with a light. A good lookout and all hands on deck to act
as circumstances might make it necessary. We sounded every half
hour and carried from 41-46 fathoms over coral rock bottom.</p>
<p>"At 6 the Commodore sent his whale-boat to sound, and directed
me to lead on to the westward. The whaleboat proving leaky, I made
the signal and sent her on board. The cutter was sent to take her
place, and during the forenoon until about II steered from N.W. to
W. &frac12; over a coral rock. At 11 shoaled our water to 36 fathoms,
rocky bottom, several discoloured spots on the water as if shoal
water.</p>
<p>"I hoist out the cutter and sent her to sound; one of them found
28 fathoms, and immediately afterwards saw a reef bearing N.N.W. &frac12;
W. 5 miles to N. by E. &frac12; E. 7 miles, and another bearing W. by N. 6
miles; made the signal for danger. Hauled to the southward. How far
this reef extended to the N. and E. I cannot say, but most likely
farther than we could see. The other reef bore W. by N. 5
miles.</p>
<p>"September 4th. At &frac34; past one I went on board the Commodore, and
we stood to the N.E. by E. until 2, then tacked and stood to the S.
by W. Half past 3 made a sandy key bearing about S. 6 W., distance
9 miles, and at 4 saw a high island bearing S.W. by S., distance 7
leagues.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Bligh afterwards named it Darnley Island.]</p>
<p>"The reefs to the north and west are out of sight. We continued
to steer to the southward and westward towards the Sandy Key and
carried from 28 to 42 fathoms over a rocky bottom, dark grey sand
and mud until 7 p.m., when we anchored<sup>*</sup> in 38 fathoms
dark grey sand and muddy bottom, smooth water. Found the current to
set to the W. &frac12; N. one mile an hour. I think this tide had been
running for about one hour, for at midnight turned and set to the
east, and although we had a moderate breeze from the S.E. the tide
turned our stern to the wind. Whether the tide setting to the east
is ebb or flow I am not able to determine. The moon's age at this
time is 17 days, 12 hours, 19 seconds.</p>
<p class="note">[* At Anchor Cay.]</p>
<p>"Long streams of fish-spawn on the water which has the
appearance of shoal water. Boobies and noddies about the ship;
caught several. In standing in for Sandy Key I sounded on one of
the streams of fish-spawn, it had the same depth of water as other
places. At this anchoring place the Sandy Key No. 1 bore S. 6&deg; E.,
distance 5 miles. One high island I shall call by the letter
A<sup>*</sup> bore S. 38&deg; W., distance 7 leagues. During the night
fine pleasant weather. At half past six a.m. weighed and came to
sail, and stood to S.S.W. in order to pass to the southward of
Island A in hopes of finding clear navigation. At 10 saw 3 small
rather high islands to the S. &frac12; E., distance 9
leagues.<sup>**</sup> Made the signal to the Commodore to follow
without danger. Soon after he signalled 'Breakers in the S.E.'</p>
<p class="note">[* A, Darnley Island.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Murray Islands.]</p>
<p>"In stretching to the south of Island A we discovered a sandy
key<sup>*</sup> to the east of it, and from Island A there
stretched a long bank or reef that appears nearly to join the Sandy
Key. Passing this bank we shoaled on water to 15 fathoms, and had
irregular soundings till we passed it. Deeper water at noon. Island
A west, distance 6 leagues. The extremes of the three islands which
I called B, C, D,<sup>**</sup> S. 23&deg; E. and S. 36&deg; E. and the
Sandy Key N.W. by N., 7 miles.</p>

<p>"September 5th. Soon after noon we discovered several
appearances to S.W. and S.S.W. that bore the appearance of boats,
or canoes under sail and soon afterwards saw they were really
canoes fishing about a long and extensive reef<sup>*</sup> that our
situation appeared to connect to Islands A, B, C, and D, and to
forbid us a passage through this way. We knew a long reef lay to
the eastward of B, C, and D, and we had too much reason to
conjecture that north of A there were reefs and sandy keys in
abundance. It was therefore judged right to anchor for the night
while we had a moderate depth of water and good bottom, and to send
two boats to sound and try for a passage between a number of banks
that lay to the westward of us. This plan was adopted and at half
past three p.m. we anchored over a bottom of grey sand and broken
shells. Island A now bore N. 52&deg; W. and N. 63&deg; W., distance 9
miles. Islands B, C, and D, S. 30&deg; E. to S. 40&deg; E., distant (from
B) 7 leagues.</p>
<p class="note">[* Canoe Cay.]</p>
<p>"The sandy key on the north point of the reef where the natives
were fishing bore S. 51&deg; W., distance 3&frac12; miles. From this Sandy Key
there stretched an immense reef as far as the eye could reach to
the W.S.W. around by the south and appeared to join to Islands B,
C, and D.</p>
<p>"The only place there was any prospect of our getting through to
the westward was between Island A and the Sandy Key, and there
seemed a very faint prospect even in that direction. We counted
seven large canoes that were fishing on the reef, and as we
appeared they paddled southwards. There were seven or eight men in
each canoe, and many long poles and spears perhaps for striking
fish. When we anchored the tide set to the E.S.E. about one knot an
hour, and made to W.N.W. about 7 p.m. The ebb of the tide comes
from the westward.</p>
<p>"We gained our knowledge of the ebb and flood by a sandy key. At
half past 3 p.m. when we anchored the key was nearly covered, and
at sunset, which was an hour before the tide made to the westward,
it was some feet above the water. At 5 p.m. two boats went from the
'Providence' to sound towards the Sandy Key No. 2, and to try for
an anchorage.</p>
<p>"About six, after consulting with the Commodore on board the
'Providence' in order to gain his instructions for future
proceedings, I returned to go on board the 'Assistant,' and found
she had drifted near half a mile to the northward. I went
immediately on board and meant to have hove up to the bower,
apprehending some danger had happened to it, but I found the anchor
had good hold of the ground, therefore weighed the small anchor and
veered to a whole cable.</p>
<p>"The ship had drove through; the officer in command not giving
the ship the cable when the weather tide slacked.</p>
<p>"At four a.m. the two boats were again sent from the
'Providence' to sound, and at nine a.m. the master returned giving
a tolerably favourable report of an anchorage some little distance
to the westward and northward of Sandy Key; he had not time to
explore far. A little time previous to his return we saw five
canoes under sail stretching to the northward; some of them passed
very near the cutter in which was Mr. Tobin, and some muskets were
observed to be fired from her and a signal made for assistance. The
Commodore immediately dispatched the pinnace under Mr. Guthrie to
the caller's assistance. Soon after the firing the canoes were all
observed to make sail, and stand for the north point of Island
A.</p>
<p>"At four p.m. on Thursday 6th the cutter and pinnace returned,
and Mr. Tobin reported that one of the canoes in which were twelve
or fourteen men came very near them at first holding up cocoanuts;
they beckoned to the people in the boat to come near them. Mr.
Tobin who was then at his oars continued to pull for the ship, for
he was at least four or five miles from her with a breeze against
him and an unfavourable tide, when he fortunately saw them
stringing their bows, and three other canoes were paddling fast
towards him just as he had got his boat's crew under arms. Two of
the blacks (for they were as black as the natives of Africa) had
got their bows up, and were in the act of discharging their arrows
into the boat when he gave orders to fire, which threw them into
consternation and stopped their proceedings. They immediately hoist
their sail and joined the other canoes, and they all stretched for
and landed at Island A.</p>
<p>"In my opinion Lieutenant Tobin acted with much prudence, for
had the seven canoes come up before he drove the first one off I
have little doubt that he and many others in the boat would have
fallen. Mr. Tobin was of the opinion that some of the Indians were
killed or wounded. Islands A, B, C, and D appear much parched,
little cultivated, and not well wooded. On Island A we saw some
cocoanut trees. A small woody key or island which I distinguish by
the letter E,<sup>*</sup> which bore from our present anchoring
place W. by N., distance 16 miles, appeared well wooded. Lat. 9&deg;
41' 09" S., 143&deg; 56' 24" E.</p>
<p class="note">[* E, Nepean Island.]</p>
<p>"September 6th. Messrs. Tobin and Nicholls having given a
favourable report of the anchorage as far as they had been, it was
determined by the Commodore to push for a passage in the morning at
daylight, it now being too late to encounter the reefs and sand
banks, and accordingly he gave me directions to lead as usual and
to take such steps as might appear to me most likely to facilitate
our passage. At daylight I weighed and made a small stretch to the
S.S.E., until the 'Providence' was under way. I then bore for the
north part of the Sandy Key No. 3, and from the main topgallant
mast conducted the ship through a narrow intricate navigation,
carrying mostly from 15 to 25 fathoms of water. Sometimes rocky and
sometimes a coral bottom. Our distance from the reefs on either
side sometimes &frac14; mile, sometimes a little more, sometimes less.</p>
<p>"Ships might anchor in these passages, but it will be necessary
for them to have trusty buoy ropes for fear of the anchors hooking
the rocks. We found the water perfectly smooth. The navigation so
far is not very dangerous in fine weather, for from the masthead
with a good lookout you may see and avoid danger from the colour of
the water. The bottom can be seen in 6 or 7 fathoms of water, many
more I am confident. But people must not depend too much on this,
for from 6 or 7 fathoms you step on the reef where there is not
above two feet.</p>
<p>"About nine we had got through from among this cluster of
shoals, and stood to the westward for a passage that offered
between Island E and a sandy key that lay to the southward of it.
We carried regular soundings from 20 to 17 fathoms over a good
bottom. At half past eight this passage appeared too narrow and
doubtful to take, I therefore led more to the southward, and
meaning to try and get between Island E and Island A. About nine we
shoaled our water suddenly to 12 fathoms over fine black muddy
sand, and I saw several appearances of shoal water in the direction
we wanted to go.</p>
<p>"I made the signal to anchor, and immediately anchored in 12
fathoms smooth water, well sheltered by islands, reefs, and sand
banks from prevailing winds. The Commodore anchored immediately
afterwards. I went on board and it was immediately determined that
I should proceed with the 'Assistant' and two boats to sound the
passage between Islands E and A. Island A was now N.E., distance &frac12;
mile. Island E bore N.W., distance 3 miles. The sandy key next to
E, N. 83&deg; W., 3 miles.</p>
<p>"Soon after anchoring we saw five canoes coming towards us from
Island A, and from what had happened had little expectation of
their venturing near us. But we were mistaken, for they came
cautiously to receive some little presents that were thrown to them
from the 'Providence,' but would not venture alongside.</p>
<p>"After remaining by the 'Providence' half an hour four of them
dropped down towards the 'Assistant' and ventured close to her and
laid hold of the ropes that were thrown them. My people were all
under arms. I at this time left the 'Providence' and got on board
in time to establish a friendly intercourse. I made them presents
of a few hatchets and towes which they received with great
eagerness and called Tureeke and were aware of the use of them,
making signs to me how they were to be used. They made me presents
in return of bows, arrows, and several ornaments for the neck,
head, and arms.</p>
<p>"The ornament for the arm was in general about five inches long,
made to draw on the arm above the elbow, worked neatly like basket
work, and on one side had worked into it a row of cowries. This
appeared a badge of distinction, for I could observe none to wear
it but those who appeared to be of more consequence than the rest.
I have reason to think the arm ornament is to protect the arm from
the bow string.</p>
<p>"The head ornament, hat or mask, for I cannot say for which
purpose it is used, or perhaps for each, is neatly enough worked in
the manner of mat work with different designs and fancies, and
painted red and white with a kind of clay or lime. The neck
ornament, or neck laces, are made of rows of shells, and others are
of plaited grass and a kind of oval formed red mat, hanging to the
ends of this plaited grass.</p>
<p>"Their bows are made of large strong bamboo with about half the
diameter split off, neatly tapering towards each end. They are 6
feet 2 inches long and so very strong it was with much difficulty a
strong man could string them.</p>
<p>"Their bow string is also made of split bamboo. Their arrows and
darts also are 4 feet 9 inches long; they are headed with very hard
wood or bone, and are sharp and must be dangerous weapons. They
have spears of different lengths.</p>
<p>"According to the best judgment we could form of their canoes,
they were from 60 to 70 feet long; about 2 feet 6 inches wide, and
about the same depth, made apparently from one tree hollowed out.
They had an outrigger on each side, and over the body of the canoe
was a stage projecting 3 or 4 feet past each gunwale and about 8 or
10 feet long. There was a kind of barricade on each side of this
stage, about 2 feet high, and here they carried their spears and
long bamboo poles for setting their canoes along the reefs.</p>
<p>"Their sail was made of matting--an ill-contrived thing, and
appeared to be hoist or shored up on two poles that projected from
the fore part of the canoe. It was about 5 feet wide, 6 or 8 feet
deep, yet with this untoward contrivance for a sail they made great
way when going, but, of course, could do but little on a wind. I do
not remember seeing wash boards, and the only contrivance for
keeping water out of the canoe was a mat tied taut around the fore
part of it.</p>
<p>"The canoes were ornamented in different parts with shell, and
towards the stern there was a small kind of gallows with some nude
figures carved on it. They made use of a very large conch shell for
bailing out their canoes, and certainly understand and make use of
signals to each other when at a distance, for this day as well as
the day the cutter fired at the canoe, I saw them frequently
display a small flag on a long pole, and whenever this was done by
a canoe one or more of the other canoes at a distance also
displayed a small flag, as if in answer to the signal.</p>
<p>"The colour of these people is black, as the natives of Africa,
and, like them, woolly headed. The eyes in general very heavy,
having a redness about the whites. Their teeth were white and even.
I could not tell the natural shape of the nose, as they have the
cartilage taken out except a very thin bit of the fore part, and in
its place a ring made of bone or ivory as large as they find
convenient to prop up the point of the nose, which gives to them
the appearance of having what we call bottle noses.</p>
<p>"Captain Bligh procured one of their nose-rings and wore it on
his third finger as a ring. Some of them have large holes in the
lobes of the ear, others have theirs cut entirely through nearly
half the length of the ear up, and no doubt suspend weights to the
separated parts, for some hang down several inches.</p>
<p>"The persons of these people are below common stature. Their
legs rather small and neatly made, but they are certainly very
active, and to judge from the strength required to string their
bows, must be strong.</p>
<p>"They are also very quick in the water, indeed as much as any
South Sea Islanders I have seen. They use paddles about 5 feet long
and stand up when they paddle, exactly as do the natives of Africa
about the River Gabun, Bristol River, and other parts that I have
seen.</p>
<p>"After our friendly intercourse I prevailed upon several to come
into the ship. They did not seem remarkably struck with what they
saw there. Their whole attention was taken up with Tureeke, iron,
which they incessantly asked for. Beads, trinkets, and
looking-glasses they set little value on. The people I appointed to
purchase some little curiosities found them to trade fairly, and
the article bargained for was sure to be handed into the ship. I
gave one of them a straw hat and silk handkerchief that I had on
for which he was very much pleased.</p>
<p>"Our anchor being now away made signs for them to go to their
canoes which they did, and I proceeded on to the northward to
sound, leaving the 'Providence' at anchor. At 11 Island A, the body
of it bore east; we had then 12 fathoms. At noon Island A, S. 83&deg;
E., Island E, S. 86&deg; W., and a small woody Island N. 72&deg; W. At this
time perfectly smooth water. Under the west side of Island A were
good sandy beaches, and the water appeared smooth. I think it
probable a ship might anchor within a mile or less of the
shore.</p>
<p>"Island A is of tolerable height, and most likely good water can
be got here and yams and plantains, for the Indians had some of
each which was purchased, and previous to our weighing, when I made
signs to the Indians for water, they pointed to Island A and I
understood them there was plenty there.</p>
<p>"Besides the ornaments already noticed, they also some of them
wear a boar's tusk stuck in the hole of the ear. They go naked,
except for these ornaments and a shell to cover the lower part of
the body. They use the same customs that the Africans practise of
having burnt scars, some of them on one shoulder and some of them
on the other. But I think the left is most prevalent.</p>
<p>"September 7th. Stood by N. by W. and W.N.W. until half past
noon, then being in good anchorage in 17 fathoms 6 miles from the
'Providence' I hauled the wind and made the signal to follow
without danger. The Commodore saw the signal and got under way and
stood towards us. I sent the whale-boat and cutter to sound and
lead, while I kept plying on the place of anchorage. At half past
one the Commodore drawing near, we anchored over a bottom of fine
sand and shells. It was now determined by the Commodore to send the
boats to the N.N.W. and N.W. at daylight in the morning, and if
they fell in with no shoals, to signal to follow them, as we could
see nothing in that direction to impede us getting to westward from
our present situation. There were appearances of shoal water north
of the island.</p>
<p>"Soon after I had anchored, a canoe came from Island E and came
alongside. The natives came on board and were much surprised. They
would not go below, and the Commodore would not urge them for fear
of alarming them. I suppose the magnitude of the ship, her height
above water, and the number of people on board surprised them, for
they were more struck there than on board the small 'Assistant' and
frequently made use of the word 'Whywool,' 'Whywool,' and it
appeared to me it expressed wonder and surprise.</p>
<p>"A number of bows, arrows, necklaces, and other things were
purchased from them and they traded with the greatest honesty. They
remained with us until near dark and then went to Island E, and
made signs they were going there to sleep. During the night we rode
perfectly smoothly.</p>
<p>"In the morning the boats were sent to the N. W., and at half
past nine having got a good distance without signalling danger I
weighed and stood to the N.W. &frac12; W., and after steering a few miles
in that direction then steered W. by N., W.S.W., and west towards
another small woody island which I distinguish by the letter
F.<sup>*</sup> About half past eleven hauled and stood in under the
lee of Island F to try the anchorage. I found coral, sandy bottom,
our distance from the reef 2&frac12; miles.</p>
<p class="note">[* Stephen Island.]</p>
<p>"The Commodore stretched in after me and I went on board. He
judged it the most eligible place to anchor for the night, and in
the morning to proceed to the westward.<sup>*</sup> At noon cloudy,
pleasant weather, several small woody islands and keys in sight to
the E., S., and W. Lat. of anchorage 9&deg; 31' 28" S., 143&deg; 31' 51"
E.</p>
<p class="note">[* "The ships were sheltered by two western islands

<p>"Saturday, September 8th, 1792. When at anchor, Island A, S. 79&deg;
E., distance 7 miles. Island E, S. 75&deg; E., distance 10&frac12; miles.
Island F, N. 81&deg; E., distance 4 miles. Island G, S. 5&deg; W., 4 miles.
Island H, S. 17&deg; W., distance 1&frac12; miles. Island I, S. 57&deg; W.,
distance 11 miles, and a sandy key S.E., distance 3 miles.</p>
<p>"All these islands, excepting Island A, are small, woody
islands, and in general each has a reef extending from it which
surrounds the island a distance of one and a half miles in some
places, a little more in others or less, but under the lee of the
island it is perfectly smooth on the reef and boats may land on
them safely. During the afternoon we saw several canoes passing
among the islands, and towards sunset two passed from Island F to
Island G,<sup>*</sup> where they made two large fires and kept them
up during the night.</p>
<p class="note">[* G, Campbell Island.]</p>
<p>"At daylight prepared to get under weigh, but did not break
loose until quarter past seven as it is very unsafe to run in this
navigation before the sun has been up a little to show the banks
and shoals. At half past seven we bore away to the westwards. At
8.35 we got ground with 14 fathoms line. We continued to steer W.
and W.S.W. in fair pleasant weather. At half past nine I saw a
sandy key<sup>*</sup> bearing W. by S. The Commodore at the same
time made the signal for seeing land. We continued towards the key,
and I led the ships past a spot of coloured water about 1&frac12; cable
from it; I suppose this spot might be 5 fathoms.</p>
<p class="note">[* Pearce's Cay.]</p>
<p>"A very extensive reef now made its appearance extending as far
as the eye could reach from the M.T.G. Mast. It stretched towards
the north, the east, the west, and the S.S.W. and discovered to us
under but a dreary prospect. We stood on to within 2&frac12; or 3 miles of
the key to discover any opening in the reef, but could not. Every
direction except the one we had just come appeared shut up against
us. We now hauled towards a small woody island that lay to the
southward of us. This I called L,<sup>*</sup> and as we stood
southward our western prospect improved a little, the reef
appearing to fall back a little to the westward. This gave us hope,
and we still continued to steer in for the lee of Island L, and
deepened our water to 13&frac12; fathoms over coarse sand intermixed with
broken shells.</p>
<p class="note">[* L, Dalrymple Island. Portlock sometimes calls
the islands by different letter-names from those which Bligh has
given them. Portlock's Island L is Island H of Bligh.]</p>
<p>"The Commodore signalled: Prepare to anchor, and at noon we both
anchored under Island L., happy enough to find a good anchorage in
a situation where we were surrounded by a reef. At anchor the
following bearings were taken. Island L, S. 11&deg; E. and S. 75&deg; E.,
distance &frac34; of a mile. The southern part of the reef in sight about
W., distance 2&frac12; miles, and extending to the W. and N. as far as eye
could see.</p>
<p>"A small woody isle which I distinguish as M<sup>*</sup> bore S.
by W., distant 8 miles, and opposite the ship we could see several
low houses, some in tolerably good order and others apparently gone
to ruin. They appeared large enough to contain each eight or ten
people and were very low, closed on all sides excepting that facing
the sea and appeared to have no roofs. I think they are composed
chiefly of the branches of the palm or cocoanut trees, neither of
which tree I could perceive on the island except a very low one
which I took for a palm.</p>
<p class="note">[* Rennel Island.]</p>
<p>"There were also two or three canoes lying up among the houses
that appeared to be damaged. This island is remarkably well wooded,
many of the trees tall and thick. We could not make out what kind
they were. 9&deg; 51' 18" S., 143&deg; 10' 15" E.</p>
<p>"September 9th. Two boats the Commodore had dispatched to the
southward to sound, returned about 3 p.m. and gave a favourable
report of the surroundings to the S.S.W. About two I saw a dog come
down from among the woods; he walked into the water a few paces,
looked at the ships, and returned to the woods again. I concluded
that there were people in the island who concealed themselves. One
of the boats on her return stated they had discovered on the south
part of the island a number of inhabitants, and saw there one canoe
and a kind of breast-work of matts built up. The officer, agreeable
to orders, did not land, but bore away round the west end of the
islands for the ship, several of the natives following alongshore,
and making signs of friendship by holding up green boughs and
beckoning them to come on shore.</p>
<p>"Soon after the boat appeared we saw the natives to the number
of 35, men, women, and young children, for some of the women
carried very young ones on their backs. Out of this number there
might be 18 or 20 men; the men were not armed, but we could see the
boys loaded with bows and arrows and spears attending the men. The
boat came on board, and the natives walked into the huts seen from
the ship where they deposited their weapons and immediately made
some fires along the beach. We were near enough to see them walk
down some distance into the water holding out green branches and
begging us to come on shore.</p>
<p>"About an hour before sunset the Commodore sent two boats on
shore with directions to the officers not to land, but if possible
to bring about a friendly intercourse by giving presents to the
natives which he sent in the boat for that purpose. The boats rowed
close to the beach, and as they rowed we could plainly see the
natives carry their weapons and lodge them behind the huts. Men,
women, boys, and girls came down to the boats and were very
friendly. They were delighted beyond measure with the nails and
towes that were presented to them, and called them Tureeke as the
people of Island A do. They gave several of their ornaments in
return and a quantity of fruit about the size of our plums, which
is pleasant enough to the taste, but is not highly flavoured. This
fruit abounds in Java.</p>
<p>"The boats remained until sunset, when they were called on board
by signal. The officer's mate on inquiring for water fancied the
natives made signs that there was water on the island; this may be,
for I remember the only water that we got in the 'Resolution' and
'Discovery' at Tongataboo was procured from an island smaller than
this. The natives kept fires upon shore all night, and we were in
hopes they would venture in the morning before we got away, but I
believe the wind was too much for them. At quarter past eight a.m.
we weighed, and according to orders I led as usual. I stood to the
southwarder under Island L to get a good berth from the shoals to
the westward and northward, and edged away to W.S.W. We were not
able to follow this course long, for we made a sand bank (perfectly
dry) extending S. and W. as far as eye could reach.</p>
<p>"To the north of it were several canoes under sail, and
stretching under its lee and shelter to the S.W. We were obliged to
haul up S.W. and S.S.W. to coast along this bank, and soon made two
low woody islands to the S. and westward.' The bank appeared to
join to the northernmost of these, but there appeared still a
passage between the two islands. As we continued to stand on to the
S.S.W., several more small woody isles made their appearance
southward and eastward and in their neighbourhood some sandy
keys--and by this time we made an extensive reef to the southward,
which appeared to join the southernmost of the two first seen
islands (since weighing from L).</p>
<p>"The northernmost of these I distinguished by the letter
N,<sup>*</sup> the southernmost O; there still was an appearance of
a pass between O<sup>**</sup> and N which we determined to try, and
accordingly as we approached the southern reef we edged away to the
S.W. and then to the west.</p>
<p class="note">[* N, Warrior or P Island of Bligh.]</p>
<p class="note">[** O, Dungeness Island.]</p>
<p>"September 10th. At half-past one one of the boats that was
sounding to the southward signalled danger. We immediately hauled
to the N.E. and stood under easy sail to give the boat an
opportunity to come within hail. On her coming near found they had
signalled in consequence of seeing the reef we were edging
down.</p>
<p>"I bore away and sent the whale-boat to lead ahead of the
Commodore. I edged down within one cable's length of the reefs in
11 fathoms until I brought the north point of the reef to bear S.
75&deg; E. The sun being to the westward of the meridian and shining
bright, threw such a prodigious glaze on the water as to make it
very unsafe to run to westward--for the glare so perfectly blinded
us that it would be impossible to see a reef or sand bank a ship's
length ahead. I thought it best to anchor and made the necessary
signal, and anchored in 13 fathoms coarse coral sand.</p>
<p>"The Commodore stretched in and anchored half a cable away, to
the northward. Just as we had hauled up to anchor I saw what at the
sight appeared a large bed of rocks, but I was agreeably surprised
to find they were a multitude of large fish. I was in hopes that to
the west of this reef, in between it and Island O, we should have
found good anchorage, but I was mistaken, and found the space
between Island O and the reef nearly filled up by numberless beds
of rock.</p>
<p>"The canoes we saw stretching to the S.W. under the extensive
sand bank to the N. and W. landed at Island N and kept up fires
during the night. Bearings from our anchorage: Island N, N. 8&deg; W.,
distant 3&frac12; miles; Island O, W. to N. 72&deg;, distant 2&frac12; miles. A
moderate island which I call P<sup>*</sup> lies S. 75&deg; W., and S.
78&deg; W., distant 14 miles; the body of the reef that we lay under
which I call by the name of Dungeness, S.E., distant 4 miles.
Island Q, S.W. &frac12; W., 3&frac12; miles; several patches of water distant 2
cables' length. Sent our boats to sound, found good depth around
the ship except to the south, where 1&frac12; cable distant was a rocky
bank in 3&frac12; fathoms.</p>
<p class="note">[* P, Turtle Backed Island. Bligh so calls it, and
does not describe it by a letter.]</p>
<p>"After the 'Assistant' was secured I hauled on the Commodore,
and from the masthead of the 'Providence' took a good lookout, and
saw a tolerable appearance of a passage between Dungeness reef and
Island O and also between O and N.<sup>*</sup> This gave us great
hopes, and about eight p.m. I returned on board the 'Assistant'.
About 10.20 the flood tide was slack, and the ebb made strong, and
we were afraid the ships would get on board each other. I verred
away on the small bower and shot the ship on shore and let go the
bower, and we lay snug for the night.</p>
<p class="note">[* Between Dungeness and Warrior Island.]</p>
<p>"In the morning we began to heave up our best bower by the
stream cable, and after getting short and heaving, the Buoy rope
parted, and our hopes of recovering the anchor were gone. During
the morning several large canoes came over from Island N, passed
us, and rendezvoused under Dungeness reef. At eleven the canoes,
six or seven in number, began to move and approach the ships.</p>
<p>"September 11th. In steering between Dungeness reef and Island O
for a passage it appeared narrow and doubtful, and we hauled out
for the passage between Islands O and N. I was at the masthead for
the purpose of hauling out, and at that instant saw some of the
Indians in one of the canoes (that had separated from the rest)
seize their bows, and without the smallest provocation on our part,
discharge several arrows at the people in our cutter which was
alongside preparing to put off for the purpose of sounding, and at
those most exposed on deck.</p>
<p>"I called out the men to arm and fire on them, which order was
complied with, but their first arrows had wounded two men in the
boat and one on deck. The wounds, though painful, the surgeon did
not think dangerous.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* One man, William Terry, quartermaster, died on
September 24th. Portlock was greatly grieved at his death. He says
that he "had got him out of the 'Royal William' from Admiral
Roddam".]</p>
<p>"I came down at once from the masthead, made the signal to call
the 'Providence's' whale-boat and cutter that were at some distance
away on board for fear of their being attacked by other canoes that
were drawing near, and kept up a smart fire of small arms on the
canoes which attacked us, which made them all jump overboard, and
at once shelter under their canoes. I made the signal for
assistance to the Commodore (for at this time we had not signalled
to denote being attacked by an enemy), and he understood my
meaning. Just at that instant the savages in a large canoe under
his starboard bow were observed firing a number of arrows at his
ship.</p>
<p>"A smart fire of small arms and now and then from a four-pounder
began from the 'Providence,' which very soon drove them all off
except one large canoe near the 'Providence' and the one which had
attacked us, these two being disabled, having many shot holes
through them, the people belonging to them being killed or wounded
or had taken to the water. On the 'Providence' boats coming on
board, they told me that they had seen the natives firing at us
some time before we fired, and by the height they were aiming,
apprehended that they were firing at me when at the masthead.</p>
<p>"I could not examine the canoes as it became necessary that we
should make sail and stand N. and W. to clear the reef that runs
some little distance from the east end of Island O. Accordingly
made sail, and the Commodore followed after me. When we had got
some distance from the disabled canoes the remainder of the fleet
came to their assistance, and through our glasses we could perceive
that they were struck with horror on looking into them. By this, I
conclude, some must have been killed or wounded so much as not to
be able to get up.</p>
<p>"They took the disabled canoes in tow, and went over to N, or
the Traitor's Isle we may call it. Just about the time they began
the attacks a very large smoke was made on N or Traitor's Isle. I
am extremely sorry to have occasion to alter my opinion of these
people, for I had conceived a very favourable one, and from the
friendly intercourse we had had with the natives of Island A and
their fairness in dealing, I had great hopes that our visit to
these parts might have established a friendship and made it safe
and pleasant for any navigator that might come after us. In the
late instance we have proof that they are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>"Their weapons are extremely dangerous and they are good
marksmen, therefore any vessel that comes should be well prepared.
If a small vessel it will be absolutely necessary to have a
breast-work half an inch or an inch broad to shelter the people
with loop holes for small arms. It would also be highly necessary
in small tonnage vessels which are very easily boarded by these
active savages to be provided with close quarters, by having loop
holes in the deck bulk-head of the cabin and connings of the
hatches, and a few stands of good arms with musquetoons should be
kept constantly in proper parts of the ship. The savages throw the
arrows with great force, and the wound made by them is extremely
painful.</p>
<p>"Several arrows were found about the deck and in the boats,
mostly with their points off. The point of one about an inch long
remains in the loem of an Ash oar and has gone in with such force
as to split the oar 2 inches on each side. I have by me the point
of another with a small bit broke off that has on it a white
substance something like rosin, of a balsamic smell. This, perhaps,
may be poison, and is the only one we have seen with this substance
on it.</p>
<p>"About one p.m. we drew clear of the east point of the Island O.
We edged away to W.N.W. and W. by W. to look for an anchorage. Soon
after passing the north point of Island O we made a sand bank with
the sea just breaking on the surface, bearing from the said north
point N. 35&deg; W., distance 2&frac12; miles. This is a dangerous shoal, and
it does not well show itself, but may be arrived at by keeping the
coast of Island O on board. At 3.10 p.m. we stretched in and
anchored near Island O over coral sands. Island N, or Traitor's
Isle, N. 66&deg; E. and N. 62&deg; E., 4 miles. Island O, S. 14&deg;, distant
1&frac12; miles. P or Turtle Back Island S. 57&deg; W., distant 8&frac12; miles.
Island Q, S. 14&deg; W., distant 4 miles. The Cap or Round Island, S.
86&deg; W., distant 11&frac12; miles. The Brothers or Island S, N. 76&deg; W., and
N. 79&deg; W., 14&frac12; miles. The sand bank distant 1&frac14; miles. Islands P, R,
and S are moderately high islands with very little wood, and appear
dry and parched. Islands N and O, and particularly O, are well
wooded, and this side of it appears large trees. Those that grew in
a kind of lagoon which ran nearly the length of the island were
mangroves I think. We saw no signs of inhabitants in the island. We
saw a flock of seven or eight birds stalking along the beach at one
place, which some thought were pelicans.</p>
<p>"I waited on the Commodore and took at sunset a good look round
from the 'Providence's masthead, and could see nothing to impede us
to the westward, so the Commodore determined to push on in the
morning as soon as it would be safe to run. At daylight began to
prepare to get under weigh. At 9 a.m. weighed and led on to the
N.N.W. with fine pleasant weather.</p>
<p>"As we approached The Brothers shoaled to 6&frac12; fathoms, and at
half past eleven made a shoal with the sea just washing on its
surface, and here and there could see the heads of rocks. This
shoal bears from The Brothers N. 10&deg; E., distant 2&frac14; miles. At noon
a highish island like the Island of Meatea<sup>*</sup> made its
appearance to the northwards and westward, and some long low flat
land lay to the eastward of it. Lat. 9&deg; 45' 07" S. and Long. 142&deg;
43' 125" E.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mount Cornwallis or Tauan Island.]</p>
<p>"September 12th. Pleasant weather and perfectly smooth water. As
we approached the bank we continued to shoal our water, and did not
deepen by steering either way. It was therefore judged necessary to
anchor and send the boats to sound round the banks and The
Brothers. Accordingly at ten past noon anchored both vessels near
each other, and two boats were sent to sound. P, or Turtle Back
Island, S.W., distant 10 miles. R or the Cap South, distant 6&frac12;
miles. S or The Brothers, S.W. 5 miles. T or Meatea Island N.W.,
distant 21 miles. Low flat land seen from the 'Providence's'
masthead, distant 15 miles. A high round topped mountain S.S.W.,
distant 13 leagues. O, or Dungeness Island, distant E.S.E. 14
miles. The boats returned, they had sounded and found four and five
fathoms within a cable's length of the bank over a good bottom, and
around it for half a mile six or seven fathoms, and had carried the
same depth over towards The Brothers.</p>
<p>"We were now assured of a passage on either side of the bank,
and the Commodore decided on the passage between it and The
Brothers. We lay perfectly smooth and serene during the night.</p>
<p>"At 7.10 weighed, and when the Commodore was under way steered
with the boats ahead to the S.W. to clear the south point of the
bank then edging away to the W. by S. West. At three-quarters past
nine the Commodore signalled for seeing land to W. by N. and saw
the land. Immediately afterwards made a reef on which the sea broke
N.W. by N. which appeared of small extent, and a dry sand bank
south of the land bearing from S.W. to W.N. At 11 the cutter made
the signal to anchor. She was S.W. by W., distant 1&frac12; miles. The
ship immediately anchored, and called the boats on board. The
cutter had shoaled to three fathoms over a coral rocky bottom, and
very near her the water broke on the rock. The Commodore sent two
boats immediately to sound down towards the low land to the W. by
N. in hopes of finding deeper water. Our bearings Meatea or Island
T, distant N. 12&deg; E. and N. 9&deg; E., distant 16 miles. Low Island
N.W., distant about 15 miles. Some high land, distant 8 leagues.
The extremes of the long bank or reef W. by N., 8 miles and S.W., 6
miles. The sea broke with much violence on this reef. There were
two other shoals, one S.S.W. two miles distant, the other N.W. by
N., distant 3 miles.</p>
<p>"At noon pleasant weather, numbers of ringed snakes, turtles,
scuttle fish, rock-weed, rushes, etc., floating past with the tide.
The turtle make so shy we cannot procure a single one. No doubt
they are harassed by the savages of these islands. Since we have
been among these islands and reefs we have not seen any fish common
to the sea, but we have seen a number of large porpoise, many of
them white and others piebald, and a large brownish kind of animal
whose make and colour lead me to believe they are the sea cow. I
found the tide of flood to set W. by N., about two miles per
hour.</p>
<p>"September 13th. The tide of flood slacked. At six fresh breezes
which caused the ships to ride with some motion. At seven the
master of the 'Providence' returned in the whale-boat from
sounding, and about eight the cutter with Mr. Tobin, third
Lieutenant, returned. Their report was that in sounding to the west
and towards the low island they found 5 fathoms frequently over a
rocky coral bottom. This being bad anchorage induced the Commodore
to send the boats away in the morning to sound to the southwards
towards the round-topped mountain and past the reef to the
westward. At night it blew a fresh breeze, and we had some sea and
the 'Assistant' considerable motion, she having a hollow low
counter struck the sea very heavy, so much so that the master came
aft and reported that she had struck the ground. The boats not
returning from sounding yet, I went on board the Commodore.</p>
<p>"Every day now becomes more critical on account of the plants; a
number of them have dropped off, and our prospect of getting
through becomes very uncertain. Therefore the whole of them are in
a critical situation. It is absolutely necessary to shorten their
allowance of water so that in case we are foiled in finding a
passage there may be enough left to save the ship's company during
the time of beating back. The want of water is all we have to
dread.</p>
<p>"About 10 a.m. the boats returned. They could give us little
information with respect to a passage, although they had gone six
or eight miles to S.S.W., 6 fathoms of water over a tolerable
bottom. However, it was pleasant to find they had better water if
only half a fathom.</p>
<p>"September 14th. Weighed at quarter past three p.m. in company
with the Commodore meaning to stretch to the southward clearer of
the banks and reefs. At quarter past 5 p.m. answered the
Commodore's signal to anchor, and anchored in 8 fathoms for the
night. At 6 a.m. fresh gales, squally with rain. Waited on the
Commodore. He was of the opinion it was not safe to proceed further
while the present weather continued. The situation becoming every
day more critical on account of the unsettled weather we may expect
to find on the sun's crossing the line and the shifting of the
monsoon. Lat. 9&deg; 42' 8" S. and 142&deg; 23' 22" E.</p>
<p>"September 15th. At 5 a.m. received an order from the Commodore
desiring me to stand on to the southward alone, and try to find a
passage and take soundings. He also sent Mr. Tobin with the
whaleboat to accompany me. At half past 6 I stood to the southward
and directed Mr. Tobin to keep between us and the reef. We had not
gone half a mile before we shoaled to less than 5 fathoms, but soon
deepened our water to 6, 7, and 8 fathoms. When we shoaled to the 5
fathoms we were passing the west end of The Brothers.</p>
<p>"We soon passed the whale-boat and she fell to leeward and soon
became useless, being unable to weather the reef, and came to a
grapnel where she appeared to ride safe. I stood on a mile past the
eastern extreme of the reef, and found this part to run on N. and
S. 2&frac12; miles, then to bend N.W. and run towards the low island
bearing W. by N. and S.W. and towards the high island bearing S.W.
The reef bending to the S.W. gave me reason to believe we might
find a passage between the island in the S.W. and the island with
the round-topped mountain on it. There was none between the high
island and the reef. I stood till past 9 and then tacked and stood
back to the 'Providence'. After getting clear of the reef edged
down to take the whale-boat in tow and at a quarter past 11 got
hold of her. As we were losing ground I anchored in 7 fathoms.
Lieutenant Tobin carried 6 fathoms over a sandy bottom. The
Brothers bearing S. 63&deg; E. and the 'Providence' E., 5 miles from
here.</p>
<p>"September 16th. At half past 3 p.m. weighed and joined the
Commodore; waited on him and made my report, in consequence of
which he determined to get under way early in the morning and try
for a passage to the southward and westwards. At quarter past 4 got
under way; the 'Providence' towed the cutter and the 'Assistant'
the whale-boat as there was too much sea for them to keep ahead;
ran the same course and carried the same depth as yesterday till we
approached the island with the high, round-topped mountain, then
got 8 fathoms.</p>
<p>"As we stood to the southward we made a number of small but
moderately high islands; some lying between the high island and the
island with the high, round-topped mountain<sup>*</sup> and several
eastward of the latter island. At noon standing in for the island
with the round high top. Answered signal: Prepare to anchor.</p>
<p class="note">[* Banks Island.]</p>
<p>"September 17th. At half past noon we anchored in 7 fathoms, the
extremes of high, round-topped mountain which I distinguish by the
letter X, distant S. 5 miles. High hummock land which I find is
three islands which I call U, V, and W,<sup>*</sup> S.E., 6
leagues; three small islands off east part of X, S.E., distant from
nearest 2 miles. On the south end of the nearest of these little
isles were a cluster of cocoanut trees. All were well wooded.
Island E E,<sup>**</sup> a small rocky isle from the E. and W. end
of which is seen a reef (that on the western being extensive), is
S.W., distant 2&frac12; miles. Island DD, between which and X we thought
was a passage, distant S.W. 8 miles. Island Z,<sup>*</sup> N.W.,
distant 6&frac12; miles. High island I call Y, N.W., distant 12&frac12; miles.
The islands hereabouts are of moderate height and well wooded,
particularly X and DD. The wood on them grows high and in very
thick groves, much resembling the woods of Van Diemen's Land. They
have fine sandy beach on which the sea appears smooth and promises
safe landing, and where we might procure water.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mt. Ernest, Pole, and Burke Islands.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Bond Island.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Passage Island.]</p>
<p>"We saw no signs of inhabitants, houses, or canoes. At sunset I
went on board the 'Providence,' and took a good look round from the
masthead and saw to the north a patch of broken water. We must have
passed very near it. Between islands DD<sup>*</sup> and Y, there
were a few small rocky islands, but nothing to prevent us getting
to the westward. The Commodore determined to try for a passage
through in the morning. In the meantime sent two boats to one of
the small islands lying off Island X, which small island I will
call BB,<sup>**</sup> to look for fresh water and take possession
of the islands in the name of the King of Great Britain, and land
and display the British flag on the shore. At half past six the
boats returned. They could not find fresh water or see inhabitants,
but there were signs of their having been there recently. They
found one or two small low huts like those of Adventure Bay, Van
Diemen's Land, and brought on board a few cocoanuts and some
prodigious large bamboo poles which they found growing on the
island. They found very good landing, and by the number of bones
and shell of turtle there is little doubt that the island is the
resort of the animal.</p>
<p class="note">[* DD and Y, Mulgrave and Jervis Islands.]</p>
<p class="note">[** North Possession Island.]</p>
<p>"In the evening it blew fresh. We lay tolerably easy, the
'Providence' perfectly smooth. At ten past six a.m. weighed and
bore away to the westward, whaleboat and cutter sounding. We
steered W. by N. for the passage between Islands DD and Y, but as
we approached it some sunken rocks appeared and almost forbid us a
passage. At 8.55 the cutter fired some muskets as a signal for
sudden shoal water, immediately signalled the 'Providence' and
hauled to southward and tacked and bore away to westward, and ran
in between two patches of broken water. The tide carried us through
this dangerous passage at a great rate and was carrying us towards
the reefs, therefore hauled under the shelter of the rocky lump
that lay off the north of Island DD and anchored.</p>
<p>"The tide was hurrying the 'Providence' towards the reefs, and I
signalled: Good anchorage, but did not like to signal: Follow
without danger. I kept signal flags out ready to direct her course,
but they steered very well between the reefs and patches of broken
water, and about II anchored a cable and a half north of us.</p>
<p>"We now lay surrounded in every direction with reefs, rocks, and
sandbanks. However we still had great hopes of finding a
way--although narrow and extremely dangerous to the westward. I
went over to the 'Providence' and found the ship would not take the
cable properly. The Commodore ordered the sheet anchor to be let go
and eventually she was brought up. Bearings, Island Y, N.E.,
distant 5&frac12; miles. A small lump of an island east of Y, which I call
GG,<sup>*</sup> N.E., distant 9 miles, a small rocky island I call
FF,<sup>**</sup> S.E., distant half a mile, extremes of DD, S.W.,
distant 2 and three-quarter miles. Besides these bearings there are
a number of small rocky islands, banks, and reefs which are
described in the sketch I have been able to make (which owing to my
being constantly at the masthead, and prevented from taking all
bearings necessary for making a most complete chart) will be useful
to future Navigators who will come this way.</p>
<p class="note">[* Florence Island.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Castle Island.]</p>
<p>"The west side of island DD that we lay off now was so very low
and full of large trees growing along the shore, I was led to
believe that there was a river or lagoon running into the land just
opposite Island FF. For between the trees I could see a piece of
water, of what extent it is impossible to say. The small islands of
which there are many in sight are barren and rocky; a little low
wood on some of them. Having at X lost the palm of one anchor, and
having reason to believe that another was disabled here, the
Commodore set to work all hands to get the remaining anchor and
cables in the best possible state. Lat. 10&deg; 10' S. and Long. 144&deg;
43' 11" E.</p>
<p>"September 18th. About 1 p.m. observed three canoes passing and
paddling along Island DD. They continued their course until they
reached a small rocky island to the S.E. of the 'Assistant' where
they landed, the tide I suppose being too strong for them to
venture off. They lay on shore till 2 o'clock and then pushed off,
and directed their course towards the 'Assistant,' and nearer to
them than the 'Providence'. When they had got to within too yards
of her they brought to anchor with a stone or something else
fastened to a rope that rode them very well considering the
strength of the tide. They made many signs for us to go on shore,
and remained at anchor until a musket shot was fired over their
heads, they then hauled up their anchor and paddled to the
shore.</p>
<p>"The' Providence's' boats which had been dispatched after we had
anchored now hove in sight from behind a small island to the
westward, and the canoes seemed to be edging that way. The
Commodore ordered a swivel to be fired across their fore part. They
immediately hauled to the southward and stood in for the west shore
of DD. There were seven or eight men in each canoe.</p>
<p>"At 3 p.m. we observed the cutter had the signal up for safe
anchorage, and as the Commodore was anxious to remove to a better
place, as it was found that on heaving up the west bower it had
lost one of its flues, the ship was now reduced to two bower
anchor. Accordingly at 4 weighed and made sail. We shoaled our
water on running to the westward before we could reach the spot
where the boats had sounded. Therefore at quarter past six we
anchored in a narrow passage in 6 fathoms. The 'Providence' close
to us. Our bearings an Island N.W., distant half a mile, the
nearest part of another Island in N..W., distant three-quarters of
a mile, another S.W. 3 miles, and another W. by S., 3 miles. I am
in hopes there is a passage between the last two islands. These
were rocky islands and reefs and broken water to the southward.</p>
<p>"At 6 a. m. weighed and made sail, the 'Providence' in company,
the boats ahead. We at first steered for the situation where the
boats had found good soundings which lay between N.W. Island, and
the island that bore W. by S. from our last anchorage. But soon saw
from the masthead that there was no passage in that direction, and
as the channel between the islands to the W. by S. and the one to
S.W. appeared better although narrow, I led for it until we passed
through it<sup>*</sup> between the W. by S. and S.W. islands. We
stood on westward carrying up 6 or 7 fathoms until half past 8.</p>
<p class="note">[* Bligh's Channel, locally known as Alligator
Passage.]</p>
<p>"I was still ahead. The boats had long dropped abreast of us.
When I saw something black in the water from the masthead I
supposed it to be a rock; made the signal and hauled to southward,
but soon shoaled, and the cutter 2 cables to the southward had cut
3&frac12; fathoms of water. I consequently slacked and joined the
Commodore who thought it best to anchor, therefore stood back and
anchored. An island I call LL,<sup>*</sup> N.E., distant 5 miles.
Island N.E., distant 5 leagues. HH,<sup>**</sup> N.E., 5 leagues.
The W. by S. Island, N.E., 3 miles; the S.W. Island, N.E., 4 miles;
the extremes of DD, S.E., distant 3 miles. A white rock bearing
S.E., distant 3 miles.</p>
<p class="note">[* Farewell Island.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Belle Vue Island.]</p>
<p>"I went on board the 'Providence,' and the Commodore immediately
dispatched boats to sound to the northward and southward for 2 or 3
miles. The black appearance in the N.W. that I took for a rock we
have reason to believe is the 'Providence' Buoy that broke adrift
when the flue of the best bower was broken.</p>
<p>"September 19th. About 3 p.m. the boats returned, the one from
the southward had found 3&frac12; fathoms, the one to the northward not
less than 5 fathoms. We saw no appearance of land or shoals to the
westward, but the shallowness of the water was alarming, and the
Commodore entertained doubt if there was sufficient for the
'Providence'. He determined to send me away at daylight to take the
'Assistant' westward to sound.</p>
<p>"At half past five weighed and made sail to W. by S. At seven
being 6 miles from the 'Providence,' signalled to follow without
danger. The 'Providence' being well up bore away again to the W. by
S. and found the bottom good and sounding regular. A much better
prospect than we have had since we entered the Straits. We
continued to carry 6; at noon, 8 fathoms, the most regular flat I
ever passed over, and at this time no land or shore in sight in any
direction. Lat. 9&deg; 55' 54", 140&deg; 29' 11"."</p>
<p>It is fitting that with Mr. Portlock's description of the track
of the "Providence" and "Assistant" through Bligh's Farewell we
should close the story of Captain Bligh's second voyage to the
South Sea, for at no time during that voyage did Bligh guide his
ships more skilfully or display greater ability as a navigator than
when passing through the dangerous channels of Torres Strait he
"accomplished in 19 days the passage from the Pacific to the Indian
Ocean".<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders' <i>Terra Australis</i>.]</p>
<p>In transcribing the story of the log-books it has not always
been possible to include all the entries which they contain, but
perhaps in course of time the whole of Bligh's journal, as well as
those written by his officers, may be published. In the meantime
the present volume must serve as a brief relation of what he
accomplished as an explorer in 1792 during the voyage of the
"Providence" and the "Assistant".</p>
