<p><u>Production Notes:</u><br></p>
<p>In this format, it has not been feasible to preserve the
individual page titles, marginal paragraph headlines or dates,
which form valuable markers in the printed text. However, where
judged useful, dates and other comments have been interpolated in
[square brackets; also used by the author].</p>
<p><u>Modified Version</u>: In this version, all chapters and
plates have been numbered sequentially.</p>
<p>In the book, the author's words appear in normal font size,
whereas quoted documents are generally shown in a smaller font.
In order that these two be more easily distinguished, the author
has been accorded a <i>serif</i> font, while sources quoted are
shown in <i>sans serif</i>. The numerous footnotes, many of them
quite long, can be readily dealt with at the bottom of a page in
a book. In this format however, to promote continuity, the notes
have been numbered sequentially and placed at the end of each
chapter. Here also, source documents (where quoted at reasonable
length), are shown <i>sans serif</i>.</p>
<p>Emphasis has been on legibility and hence minimal or no
reduction in font size.</p>
<p>Click the number in {curly brackets} to go to the note;
afterwards click or touch {<u>return</u>} to resume reading.</p>
<p>The Analytical Index has also been included. To assist in
finding an internal reference given by page number, including
those styled "Ante, p. x" or "Post, p. y", a table has been
added at the end, after the Index.</p>

<h3>1. PHILLIP AND ROSS.</h3>
<p><small>FROM</small> August, 1789, to February, 1790, the
Records are silent concerning the relations which existed between
Governor Phillip and Major Ross. This very silence may, however,
be an indication that the terms upon which they were well known
to stand with each other had not improved. It is evident from the
correspondence of August, 1789, <a href="#note-001" name=
"noteref-001" id="noteref-001">{1}</a> that the Governor and
Lieutenant-Governor had each taken steps to represent his case to
the authorities in England. Phillip, in the meantime, displayed
the greatest forbearance and self-control. He was, apparently,
content to let matters rest; and if he did not forget the
disagreeable subject, he kept it out of view as much as possible.
Ross, on the other hand, seems to have nursed his wrath to keep
it warm. At length the resentment that had been smouldering for
six months showed itself openly in February, 1790, when Phillip
was given to understand&mdash;the intimation seems to have come
from Ross&mdash;that he had not paid proper attention to certain
complaints which the Lieutenant-Governor had made regarding the
conduct of the Judge-Advocate, Captain Collins. The matter is
dealt with at some length in Phillip's letter to Nepean, 12th
February, 1790. <a href="#note-002" name="noteref-002" id=
"noteref-002">{2}</a></p>
<p>The complaints made by Ross were trivial in the extreme;
and&mdash;such as they were&mdash;had been explained, at the
time, in a manner that would have satisfied anyone whose judgment
was not warped by jealousy and pride. The circumstances out of
which they arose were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Phillip, on the morning of Saturday, 22nd August, 1789,
directed Captain Collins, who acted as his secretary as well as
Judge-Advocate, to communicate certain instructions to an officer
who was superintending some works at Sydney Cove. Collins forgot
all about the order until the following Monday, when he carried
it into effect. In the interval, Phillip had gone to Rose Hill,
and Ross was in charge at Sydney, by virtue of his Commission as
Lieutenant-Governor. According to official etiquette,
instructions intended to be executed during the Governor's
absence should have been given through the Lieutenant-Governor;
and because this rule was not observed, Ross made a formal
complaint to the Governor, declaring that an insult had been
offered to him, "in my character of Lieutenant-Governor". The
matter was fully explained by both Phillip and Collins; and the
incident, which was not worth a moment's attention, might well
have been allowed to drop. Ross having revived it, Phillip was
induced to give an explanation to Nepean, and at the same time to
take notice of other points which he had passed over in his
correspondence with Ross. In his letters to the Major, he kept as
nearly as possible to the subject in hand, refraining from
allusions of a personal nature. Ross, on the contrary, was
nothing if not personal. He prefaced his complaint about the
Judge-Advocate with an ill-concealed sneer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It would be presumption in the extreme in me to
suppose your Excellency not to know that when either duty,
business, or pleasure may at any time induce your Excellency to
absent yourself from this Cove, there cannot then remain in it
any authority superior to that of the Lieutenant-Governor."
<a href="#note-003" name="noteref-003" id=
"noteref-003">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>This might have been intended as an insinuation that Phillip
had gone to Rose Hill on a pleasure excursion, leaving the work
and responsibility of the command on the shoulders of his
lieutenant. Having thus formulated his complaint, Major Ross
aired another grievance, of which Phillip, up to that time, was
in complete ignorance. He was Lieutenant-Governor of the
settlement; he had been honoured with a Commission from the King,
appointing him to that position; but the Governor had not
respected his office&mdash;instead of confiding in his
lieutenant, he had ignored him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Should your Excellency say&mdash;and I cannot
possibly bring myself to think you will&mdash;that you, on going
away from here, left your orders relative to the employing
convicts with the Judge-Advocate, in place of leaving them with
the Lieutenant-Governor, I have in such case to request that you
will please to explain to me the line of conduct which, as
Lieutenant-Governor of this settlement, you wish me either to
preserve or follow, assuring yourself that I shall endeavour to
pursue that line, at least till such time as a power superior to
either of us shall determine the bounds of both, and redress our
grievances. At present I acknowledge myself as much in the dark
with respect to the line of conduct you expect me to pursue as
Lieutenant-Governor, or what you expect from me, or what I shall
do, as I was the first day of our meeting in London." <a href=
"#note-004" name="noteref-004" id=
"noteref-004">{4}</a></blockquote>
<p>Phillip took no notice of these reproaches. In his reply to
Ross, he contented himself with expressing a wish that the peace
of the settlement might not be disturbed, and requested the Major
to be a little more guarded in his language when speaking to the
convicts. <a href="#note-005" name="noteref-005" id=
"noteref-005">{5}</a> But when, six months after the event, Ross
complained that proper attention had not been paid to his
representations, he deemed it advisable to explain matters to the
authorities in England. This step he probably considered the more
necessary as he knew that Ross was in communication with Nepean
of the Home Office and Stephens of the Admiralty. <a href=
"#note-006" name="noteref-006" id="noteref-006">{6}</a> He
accordingly wrote a letter to Nepean, 12th February, 1790,
<a href="#note-007" name="noteref-007" id="noteref-007">{7}</a>
&mdash;in which he dealt at some length with a subject that he
thought had been buried half a year before. Ross's insinuation
that the Governor left Sydney for Rose Hill on pleasure bent was
met by Phillip with some warmth, and with more than a hint of
<i>suggestio falsi</i> on the part of his adversary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As to parties of pleasure, he [Major Ross] knew
likewise that I had never been a day, and very seldom an hour, on
that account; and he might have known that my absence which gave
room for his complaint against the Judge-Advocate was at a time
when my state of health was such that I should have been better
pleased to remain in my bed than to have gone to Rose Hill to
sleep on the boards in a hut belonging to the man who has the
direction of the convicts. A journey I made soon after we landed
fixed a complaint in my side which has rendered the fatigues of
examining the country round us, not parties of pleasure, but
parties in which nothing but a sense of duty and necessity would
make me engage."</blockquote>
<p>The active part taken by Phillip in these exploring
expeditions, and the character of the work he did, may be seen
from the chapter "Phillip and Exploration". <a href="#note-008"
name="noteref-008" id="noteref-008">{8}</a> It is evident that he
regarded Ross's innuendo, at the time it was made, as quite
unworthy of serious notice, and in all probability he would have
said nothing about it to Nepean, or to any other English
official, but for the suspicion he appears to have entertained
that an incorrect version might reach the authorities.</p>
<p>The assertion that Phillip had withheld from the
Lieutenant-Governor the confidence he should have reposed in
him&mdash;that he had kept him "in the dark"&mdash;invited a
further rejoinder. From Phillip's own account <a href="#note-009"
name="noteref-009" id="noteref-009">{9}</a> it is apparent that
Ross from the first regarded himself as slighted. He was
entitled, he considered, to share in the counsels of the
Governor, but he was not asked for assistance or advice&mdash;he
was passed over. One matter in connection with which Ross thought
himself "entitled to more confidence than had been placed in him"
was the selection of the site of the settlement. We have not his
complaint in his own words; but the purport of it can be gathered
from Phillip's account of the circumstances. It appears that some
months after the landing at Sydney Cove, Ross, in conversation
with Phillip, professed his ignorance, real or pretended, of
Phillip's intentions in regard to continuing at Sydney Cove or
abandoning it for a more eligible site, remarking at the same
time that, before leaving England, he had been given to
understand by Lord Howe&mdash;then first Lord of the
Admiralty&mdash;that the exact part of the coast on which the
settlement was to be made had not been finally determined
upon.</p>
<p>This, however, was not a special piece of information confided
to Major Ross alone. It was generally known that the commander of
the expedition had authority to abandon Botany Bay and plant the
settlement elsewhere if he considered it advisable to do so; and
Lord Howe, doubtless, meant no more than this. But after the
selection of Sydney Cove no one but the Major seems to have had a
thought of change. Not the faintest idea of such a thing is to be
found in the writings of Collins, Tench, White, or Hunter, and no
trace of it can be discovered either in Phillip's official
despatches or in his private letters to his friend Nepean. Ross's
grievance, therefore, if put forth in good faith, was purely
imaginary. It is true that Phillip had reason to think afterwards
that Parramatta would have been a better site, but at the time he
was not aware that such a place existed. One would think from the
nature of Ross's complaint that he was under the apprehension
that the little colony was liable to be uprooted and packed off
to some other part of the coast at a week's notice, to suit the
caprice of the Governor.</p>
<p>Finding the Lieutenant-Governor in this frame of mind, Phillip
did what he could to "remove so groundless a cause of
discontent". Ross, at his request, came to him the next day, when
"I read to him", wrote Phillip, "every part of my Instructions
relating to the settlement, and he left me, I thought, fully
satisfied and contented." But he was anything but satisfied, as
his subsequent actions show, and Phillip could only obtain peace
and quietness by sending him to Norfolk Island as
Lieutenant-Governor. After the interview at which the
Instructions were read over, Phillip discussed at some length
with Ross matters affecting the welfare and management of the
settlement, and it was agreed that he should take charge of the
convicts on the west side of the Cove, while Phillip kept control
of those on the east side. "The Lieutenant-Governor", added
Phillip, "then very well understood what I expected and wished,
and on every occasion I readily acknowledged the assistance I
received; but a warmth of temper, which has been the source of
many discontents, has obliged me for some time past to avoid, so
far as the service permits, calling on the Lieutenant-Governor
otherwise than as the Commandant of the detachment."</p>
<p>One of Ross's complaints was directed against that part of
Phillip's letter of 27th August, 1789, <a href="#note-010" name=
"noteref-010" id="noteref-010">{10}</a> in which he asked that
the peace of the settlement might not be disturbed, and that the
Lieutenant-Governor would be a little more guarded when speaking
to the convicts. In dealing with this matter, Phillip is more
animated than usual:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Lieutenant-Governor has complained of that part
of my letter in which I request that the peace of the settlement
may not be disturbed, but have I not had sufficient cause to make
that request? Has not representation or complaint been too
frequent? Was not the answer given by him to a convict followed
by a behaviour on the part of that wretch which drew on him a
severe sentence from the Criminal Court? Did not the
Lieutenant-Governor, when that convict was under examination,
behave in such a manner to Captain Hunter and the Judge-Advocate
that the former wished to be excused attending one day in the
week as a Justice of the Peace, that he might not subject himself
in future to such treatment when acting as a Magistrate; and the
latter wished to resign his office of Judge-Advocate, in
consequence of the treatment he had received from the
Lieutenant-Governor and Captain Campbell, in the presence of
convicts and others? I quote the words those officers made use of
when they represented that matter to me. And did not the
Lieutenant-Governor's conduct, as it appears from the evidence of
several of his officers, when Captain Campbell refused the duty
of the Criminal Court, bring this settlement to touch on the
moment of a general confusion? <a href="#note-011" name=
"noteref-011" id="noteref-011">{11}</a></blockquote>
<p>Ross's incessant complaints had a result which he probably did
not anticipate. Phillip, who for so long a time had been as
forbearing as Ross had been irascible, was at length thoroughly
aroused, and in his semi-private letter to Nepean, quoted above,
he spoke his mind in a way which gave the Under Secretary a
clearer view of Ross's conduct than he had been able to gain from
the formal despatches, which were guardedly written, and confined
strictly to matters that had been brought officially under the
notice of the Governor. The conduct attributed to Ross by Phillip
might have formed the basis of a charge which would have been
difficult to answer; but Phillip's object was to keep peace, not
to assert his authority; and he had very good grounds for telling
Nepean <a href="#note-012" name="noteref-012" id=
"noteref-012">{12}</a> that, if his forbearance did not lay him
open to censure, he had no reason to apprehend blame. His
consideration for Major Ross, who deserved so little, is shown by
the manner in which he vindicated himself. Had he written direct
to the Secretary of State, the authorities could scarcely have
avoided taking action; and the consequences to Ross might have
been very serious indeed. Instead of doing that, he sent a
semi-private letter to the Under Secretary, who was a personal
friend, and added this sentence as a postscript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"After reading this letter, which I have written in
haste, and with a desire of explaining how little reason there
has been for complaint, I think it appears so like a letter to
justify my own conduct that I wish you only to lay the enclosed
letters <a href="#note-013" name="noteref-013" id=
"noteref-013">{13}</a> before L'd Sydney, and explain to his
L'dship that the preamble in the Lieut.-Gov's letters was not
noticed in my answer, <a href="#note-014" name="noteref-014" id=
"noteref-014">{14}</a> as I did not think it merited any
attention."</blockquote>
<p>This was a judicious step on the part of Phillip. He knew that
the letter was not one that Nepean could keep to himself, but
that it must, in the regular order of things, be laid before the
Secretary of State, and be brought under the notice of the Lords
of the Admiralty, to whom Ross was immediately responsible; and
he also knew that coming in the way it did it would not
necessarily lead to action on the part of either the Home Office
or the naval authorities. In this way he justified his own
conduct without making a case against the officer who had
thwarted and embarrassed him so sorely.</p>
<p>So far as can be ascertained, Nepean did not reply to
Phillip's letter&mdash;no answer, in fact, was required. To
Ross's complaints, which were addressed to the Secretary of the
Admiralty, a short reply was sent that "their Lordships are much
concerned that any disagreement should have arisen between the
Governor and yourself"; <a href="#note-015" name="noteref-015"
id="noteref-015">{15}</a> and as Ross was to return to England by
the vessel which carried this letter, he was informed that it was
not deemed necessary to answer his communications minutely. It
does not appear that anything was done in the matter after Ross
arrived in England.</p>
<p>In a letter of 19th February, 1791, <a href="#note-016" name=
"noteref-016" id="noteref-016">{16}</a> Lord Grenville, replying
to Phillip's despatches of the 1st and 12th February, 1790,
<a href="#note-017" name="noteref-017" id="noteref-017">{17}</a>
expressed disapprobation of Ross's conduct, but he qualified his
remarks by intimating that his judgment was formed solely on
Phillip's account of the transaction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The proceedings of Major Ross and Captain Campbell,
according to your representation, appear to have been in many
instances but ill-calculated to promote that good understanding
so essentially necessary for securing the prosperity of the
colony."</blockquote>
<p>But, assuming Phillip's account to be correct, he had no
hesitation in expressing his opinion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On all services, but particularly of this nature, it
is of great importance that persons of all descriptions should
accommodate themselves to the circumstances and situation, and
that they should most carefully avoid any nice distinctions in
point of duty which might tend to occasion embarrassment in the
execution of the public service. His Majesty has always in view
the proceedings of his officers when placed in those situations,
and will judge of their merits by the conduct they observe on
such occasions."</blockquote>
<p>The reservation in the first sentence was an injustice to
Phillip. He had been scrupulously accurate in his
"representations", as Grenville might have ascertained; and the
accounts he gave of Ross's proceedings were substantiated by
trustworthy evidence. If he made any error, it was in
understating his case. The point was taken up by Phillip with a
warmth that is not often seen in his communications to the
Secretary of State. In his reply of the 15th December, 1791, he
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I beg that your Lordship will permit me to say that
the representations I have made of the conduct of those officers
[Ross and Campbell] are just and impartial, and which do not
admit of a doubt. I believe Major Ross's or Captain Campbell's
friends could not have represented their conduct in a more
favourable point of view without having deviated from truth; and
the representations I made appeared to me to be necessary for the
good of his Majesty's service." <a href="#note-018" name=
"noteref-018" id="noteref-018">{18}</a></blockquote>
<p>Phillip wrote respectfully, but his words were nevertheless a
protest against Grenville's reluctance to accept his statements.
If the Minister, when he wrote his despatch, entertained the
slightest doubt as to the accuracy or justness of Phillip's
version of the conduct of Ross and Campbell, it must have been
dissipated by the light that was thrown on the subject when the
detachment returned to England. If anyone was distrusted after
this, it was not Phillip. He continued to enjoy the entire
confidence of the British Government, and when at last he was
compelled to retire from his post his resignation was accepted
with unfeigned regret. <a href="#note-019" name="noteref-019" id=
"noteref-019">{19}</a></p>
<p>Ross's career in New South Wales closed in a very different
manner. The reports which reached England early in 1789 of
"discontents" among the marine officers led to the recall of the
detachment, which was replaced by the New South Wales Corps,
raised in England by Major Grose. Ross, after eighteen months'
service in Norfolk Island as Lieutenant-Governor, left for
England with the greater part of the force in the Gorgon, on the
18th December, 1791. It does not appear that he obtained, on his
return, promotion or any other mark of confidence on the part of
the Government. On the other hand, there is evidence that his
conduct towards Captain Meredith was highly disapproved of.</p>
<p>One of the earliest troubles connected with the military arose
out of the extraordinary step taken by Ross in March, 1788, in
placing under arrest the members of a Court-martial <a href=
"#note-020" name="noteref-020" id="noteref-020">{20}</a> for
refusing to alter a sentence which it had passed on Joseph Hunt,
a private of marines, accused of striking a comrade. The Court
found that the charge was proved, and sentenced the prisoner
"either to ask public pardon before the battalion of William
Dempsey, the soldier whom he struck and injured, or to receive
one hundred lashes on his bare back, by the drummers of the
detachment, and where the commanding officer shall appoint." Ross
regarded this sentence as contrary to martial law, because it
gave the prisoner an alternative; and he called upon the Court to
review its decision. The Court declined to alter the sentence,
whereupon the Major sent the President (Captain Tench) a written
order, by the Adjutant, to convene the Court a third time. The
reply, signed by all the members of the Court, was that according
to the 10th Article of the Act of Parliament for the regulation
of the marine forces while on shore, no sentence passed by any
Court-martial and signed by the President could be revised more
than once. Ross was not satisfied with this reply. The
Court-martial, he declared in a letter to Phillip, "seemed
determined to wrest all power from the commanding officer", and
he accordingly put the President and members under arrest for
"disobedience of orders". When Phillip was informed of what had
occurred, he endeavoured to reconcile the parties, but failed.
The officers considered themselves injured by the arrest, and
demanded to be tried by General Court-martial, but as there was
not a sufficient number of officers in the colony to form a
Court, the inquiry could not be held. They were ordered by
Phillip to return to their duty until a General Court-martial
could be assembled, and did so. Technically, they were under
arrest, but they were under no actual restraint whatever. They
complained bitterly, however, of the indignity they suffered, and
of losing their chances of promotion; for, so long as they were
under arrest, although the "arrest" was a mere form, they might,
if changes were made in the service, "have been passed over as
prisoners who had forfeited the common claim of service".</p>
<p>On 25th March, 1791, three years after the arrest, they
appealed to Phillip. <a href="#note-021" name="noteref-021" id=
"noteref-021">{21}</a> According to the Act of Parliament
<a href="#note-022" name="noteref-022" id="noteref-022">{22}</a>
"for the regulation of his Majesty's Marine Forces while on
shore", no person could be tried for any offence, desertion
excepted, committed more than three years before the issue of the
warrant. That time having expired. Captain Tench and the other
officers who had constituted the Court asked that the arrest
might be removed. They made the application:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Not as culprits, conscious of having committed a
crime which we shrink to have investigated, or hesitate to meet,
but as soldiers indignant at the novelty and disgrace of a
situation unexampled in the British military annals&mdash;the
members of a Court-martial under arrest on a charge which, if
proved against them, extends not only to the deprivation of their
most gracious Sovereign's favour and dismission from the service,
but to the forfeiture of their lives and honours, doing duty as
prisoners, from the necessity, of service, for three years . . .
While a hope of relief from our situation by the decision of a
General Court-martial existed we were silent&mdash;we were
patient. That hope is now at an end, and, therefore, to remain
without representation longer in our present degraded situation
would argue that we are become insensible of ignominy and
familiar with humiliation."</blockquote>
<p>The situation was, no doubt, galling to the officers
concerned, but the language employed in describing it was
unnecessarily strong. Captain Tench and his companions in
misfortune were not in a "degraded situation", nor were they
exposed to "ignominy". Their status in the community was no lower
than it was before they were placed under arrest. They were not
regarded as men in disgrace, but rather as the victims of an
extraordinary and unwarranted assertion of authority on the part
of their commanding officer. If they suffered at all, it was in
the loss of promotion; beyond that they could not complain of any
material injury. But they had been brooding over their wrongs for
three years in a place where there was little to divert their
attention from their personal grievances, and the circumstances
may, perhaps, excuse the extravagance of language which led them
to ask for release from the "confinement under which we have so
long laboured".</p>
<p>However, this over-statement of the case does not excuse Major
Ross. He was entirely in the wrong. The refusal of a
Court-martial to alter its finding was not a valid ground for
placing its members under arrest. If the Court had submitted to
the Commandant's dictation, trial by Court-martial would have
been reduced to a farce.</p>
<p>Ross certainly was not responsible for the delay which kept
these officers in suspense for three years, and in the end
prevented any inquiry from being made into either his conduct or
their own: but the step he took was an unwarrantable exercise of
authority; and if an investigation had been held he would
probably have been severely censured.</p>
<p>After their return to England the officers concerned moved the
Admiralty with the object of having their own conduct cleared up
and that of Major Ross reviewed, but they were unsuccessful. On
the 22nd September, 1792, Captain Tench sent to the Lords of the
Admiralty, through General Collins, the officer in command of the
division of marines at Plymouth, a memorial requesting that a
General Court-martial might be held to investigate his conduct,
"not only with respect to a transaction mentioned in a letter
from Major Boas, publicly read at the Court-martial lately held
on Captain Meredith, but also as President of a Detachment
Court-martial, notwithstanding the lapse of three years specified
in the Marine Act of Parliament." But if he was denied a General
Court-martial on himself, "he steps forward to charge Major Ross,
as Commandant of the battalion of marines in New South Wales,
with tyranny and oppression", requesting at the same time that
the Major might be tried by General Court-martial, with this
condition, that the charges should, include among other instances
of Ross's misconduct that of his putting the Court-martial under
arrest. If this request had been granted, Major Ross would have
found it difficult to justify his conduct. But the Lords of the
Admiralty did not consider it necessary to appoint a General
Court-martial to inquire into the statements contained in Ross's
letter; <a href="#note-023" name="noteref-023" id=
"noteref-023">{23}</a> and Tench was informed that neither his
conduct as the President of the Court-martial at Sydney, nor that
of Major Ross in putting the members of it in arrest, could now,
from lapse of time, be investigated. So that Tench and his
fellow-sufferers were unable to obtain any satisfaction.</p>
<p>The case of Captain Meredith <a href="#note-024" name=
"noteref-024" id="noteref-024">{24}</a> had nothing to do with
the complaint of Tench and his brother-officers, but if a General
Court-martial had been granted, Ross's treatment of Meredith
would doubtless have been used by Tench as an evidence of the
"tyranny and oppression" with which he charged the Major. Captain
Meredith had been suspended by Ross two years before, as stated
in a letter from Phillip to Stephens, 10th April,
1790:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The officer mentioned in the return as unfit for
duty is Captain Meredith; he was suspended by Major Ross, who
thought his conduct such as made a General Court-martial
necessary; and that officer has requested that such Court-martial
may be ordered, as he deems his conduct to have been such as he
can justify."</blockquote>
<p>What Meredith did to incur Ross's displeasure is not expressly
stated, either in the charge or in the finding of the
Court-martial; but the general accusation against him was
"behaving highly improper as an officer, and in his (Ross's)
opinion tendening to the subversion of all subordination and
injurious to military discipline." A more serious charge could
scarcely be brought against an officer, but it was without
foundation. For committing at the most a trifling fault this
officer was placed in strict arrest, which lasted for two years
and a half. During the whole of that time Captain Meredith was
under the stigma which attaches to officers in such a position,
and lost any chance of promotion which might have occurred in the
interval.</p>
<p>The hearing of the case, which was tried at Plymouth, before
Adjutant Martin, as Judge-Advocate, lasted from the 3rd to the
18th September, 1792, and resulted in the honourable acquittal of
the "prisoner". The sentence of the Court, which was approved by
the Lords of the Admiralty, was at once a vindication of Captain
Meredith, and a censure upon his accuser. It read as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Court is of opinion that the charge is
groundless and malicious&mdash;groundless because the charge is
not proved in either of its parts, and if it had been was of a
venial nature, and for which ample atonement was made in the
apology offered; and malicious from the long duration of the
arrest and the unusual and unnecessary severity of it; and the
Court doth therefore honourably acquit the
prisoner."</blockquote>
<p>This is not all. Taking notice of the fact that the prosecutor
had made an unjustifiable assertion against the prisoner, which
might injure him in public opinion, the Court thought it just and
due to Captain Meredith to declare that it could see "no
circumstance whatever to deprive him of the public good opinion
or the respect of his corps." With the consent of the Lords of
the Admiralty, the sentence and declaration were read in open
Court. Only an outline of the case can be gathered from the
materials at hand, but the facts set forth in the finding of the
Court-martial throw a strong light on Major Ross's character. It
is hardly too much to say that the proceedings in this case
exhibit him as ill-tempered, tyrannical, and vindictive. No one
who considers his treatment of Captain Meredith can feel surprise
that he quarrelled with his officers in New South Wales and came
into collision with the Governor. It does not appear that any
action was taken with regard to him, upon the finding of the
Court-martial, but the publication of the sentence and
declaration was a most severe reflection upon his character as a
military commander.</p>

<h3>2. THE FAMINE OF 1789-90.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> summer of 1789-90 was a time of dreary
monotony, aggravated by the keenest anxiety. No tidings had been
received of the ships that were expected from England as early as
September, 1788, <a href="#note-025" name="noteref-025" id=
"noteref-025">{1}</a> with supplies of provisions and clothing;
and nothing of importance at the settlement occurred to divert
attention from the miseries of the moment and the fears of
impending famine. Even the discord among the military had
subsided. The pressure of the circumstances must have been keenly
felt by Phillip, but it was characteristic of the man that he
never allowed a despondent word to creep into his despatches, nor
did he sit down waiting for something to happen. With unceasing
activity he devoted the resources at his command to the
cultivation of the soil. He put the convicts to work at Rose
Hill, and did his best to obtain good returns from their labour.
But the results were not encouraging. Foremost amongst the
obstacles that stood in his way was the scarcity of food, which
so reduced the strength of the men that they were only able to
work a few hours a day. They were, altogether unequal to the
heavy labour involved in clearing the land and tilling the virgin
soil.</p>
<p>In 1790 the question of supplies had become urgent. The First
Fleet sailed from England in May, 1787, with provisions for two
years, but no allowance had been made for accidents or
contingencies. Fortunately, the storeships, with the exception of
the Guardian, arrived at Sydney Cove in safety, but a portion of
the provisions was damaged during the voyage, and a large
quantity was destroyed by rats after the stores had been landed.
Towards the close of 1789 no further supplies had been received
from England, and the stock in hand had fallen so low that it
became necessary to materially reduce the ration. Foreseeing some
such difficulty, Phillip, soon after he had established the
settlement at Sydney Cove, despatched the Sirius to the Cape of
Good Hope for provisions, but the quantity she was able to
bring&mdash;she returned in May, 1789&mdash;was less than was
anticipated, being but four months' supply of flour for the
settlement and one year's supply of provisions for her own
company. <a href="#note-026" name="noteref-026" id=
"noteref-026">{2}</a> As the ships which were expected from
England did not arrive, Phillip assumed that some disaster had
overtaken one or more of them, and he decided that the time had
come for economising the food in store. His fears as to the
safety of the ships were soon afterwards justified by the
intelligence that reached Sydney of the accident to the Guardian,
and the loss of the greater part of the provisions she was
bringing for the settlement.</p>
<p>A reduction of one-third was accordingly made, on the 1st
November, 1789, in the ration which had been served every
Saturday to soldiers and male convicts, and which had originally
been as follows:&mdash; <a href="#note-027" name="noteref-027"
id="noteref-027">{3}</a></p>
<p class="poem">7 lb. of bread or 7 lb. of flour.<br>
7 lb. of beef or 4 lb. of pork.<br>
3 pints of pease.<br>
6 oz. of butter.<br>
&frac12; lb. of rice or 1 lb. of flour.</p>
<p>The reduction of one-third therefore left:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">4 lb. 10&sup2;/&sup3; oz. of bread or flour.<br>
4 lb. 10&sup2;/&sup3; oz. of beef or 2 lb. 10&sup2;/&sup3; oz. of
pork.<br>
2 pints of pease.<br>
5&sup1;/&sup3; oz. of rice or 10&sup2;/&sup3; oz. of
flour.<br></p>
<p>The butter had been exhausted two months before.</p>
<p>When reporting this reduction to the Home Secretary in his
despatch of the 12th February, 1790, <a href="#note-028" name=
"noteref-028" id="noteref-028">{4}</a> Phillip explained that it
was done "to guard against accidents". He estimated that the
provisions by this means would last until the following June. The
reduction applied to every person in the settlement (women
excepted), and at the same time the companies of the Sirius and
Supply were placed on three-fourths allowance. <a href=
"#note-029" name="noteref-029" id="noteref-029">{5}</a></p>
<p>In connection with this reduction of the allowance of food,
Collins reports a fact which aptly illustrates the improvidence
of the convicts. With a larger quantity of food at their
disposal, men who possessed even the smallest particle of
prudence would have been careful in its consumption, but with the
majority of the people the contrary was the case. "It was soon
observed", wrote Collins, "that of the provisions issued at this
ration [two-thirds of the ordinary allowance] on the Saturday,
the major part of the convicts had none left on the Tuesday
night; it was therefore ordered that the provisions should be
served in future on the Saturdays and Wednesdays. By these means
the days that would otherwise pass in hunger, or in thieving from
the few who were more provident, would be divided, and the people
themselves be more able to perform the labour which was required
from them. Overseers and married men were not included in this
order." <a href="#note-030" name="noteref-030" id=
"noteref-030">{6}</a> The plan of issuing the provisions weekly
had been adopted, no doubt, to avoid unnecessary loss of time;
but it is evident that if a change had not been made the state of
the settlement would have been deplorable. Phillip makes no
reference in his despatches to this reckless conduct on the part
of the convicts, which would have caused a less sanguine man to
despair of ever doing any good work with such wretched material,
nor does Collins say that the Governor exhibited the anger and
mortification which he might have been expected to feel. But
Phillip, no doubt, had the circumstance in his mind when he
assured Nepean, writing to him soon after the reduction of the
ration, that although the people would not starve, "seven-eighths
of the colony deserves nothing better". <a href="#note-031" name=
"noteref-031" id="noteref-031">{7}</a></p>
<p>Improvidence even less excusable was displayed not long
afterwards by the convicts in killing the greater part of the
live stock with which they had been entrusted. <a href=
"#note-032" name="noteref-032" id="noteref-032">{8}</a></p>
<p>Up to this time (1st November, 1789) the men employed in
cultivating the land had not suffered from short allowance of
food, but there were other circumstances which militated against
the success of Phillip's plans. The convicts were not only unused
to field labour, they were also incorrigibly idle. The
possibility of famine was regarded by them as too remote a
contingency to necessitate a voluntary performance of their
tasks; and Phillip, when the military refused to "interfere with
the convicts", had only one man <a href="#note-033" name=
"noteref-033" id="noteref-033">{9}</a> he could trust with the
duty of superintending those employed in clearing and cultivating
the land. Recognising how hopeless it was to expect to make much
headway against the natural indolence of the convicts, unless
proper people were sent out as superintendents, Phillip
repeatedly urged upon the authorities in England the necessity of
sending out free men for this purpose, and warned the Secretary
of State that unless this was done the convicts "would remain for
years a burden to the Government". "Numbers of them", be added,
"had been brought up from their infancy in such indolence that
they would starve if left to themselves". <a href="#note-034"
name="noteref-034" id="noteref-034">{10}</a> If a staff of
overseers accustomed to agricultural work could have been placed
in charge, these disadvantages would have been reduced to a
minimum. Under the circumstances it is not surprising that the
"harvest" of 1789, the first recorded, was anything but a
plentiful one. Phillip makes this report of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In December the corn at Rose Hill was got in; the
corn was exceeding good. About two hundred bushels of wheat and
sixty of barley, with a small quantity of flax, Indian corn, and
oats, all which is preserved for seed. . . . . The officers have
not raised sufficient to support the little stock they have. Some
ground I have had in cultivation will return about forty bushels
of wheat into store, so that the produce of the labour of the
convicts employed in cultivation has been very short of what
might have been expected." <a href="#note-035" name="noteref-035"
id="noteref-035">{11}</a></blockquote>
<p>Phillip does not give the area of land in cultivation, nor the
number of men employed, but information on the latter point is
supplied by Collins:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Upon a calculation of the different people employed
for the public in cultivation it appeared that of all the members
in the colony there were only two hundred and fifty so
employed&mdash;a very small number indeed to procure the means of
rendering the colony independent of the mother country for the
necessaries of life." <a href="#note-036" name="noteref-036" id=
"noteref-036">{12}</a></blockquote>
<p>It will not escape attention that Phillip did not regard the
product of the land he had in cultivation as his private
property. A still more striking instance of disinterestedness on
his part in sending into the Government store his private stock
of flour has already been alluded to. <a href="#note-037" name=
"noteref-037" id="noteref-037">{13}</a></p>
<p>Phillip, it will be seen, made a point of the failure by the
officers to raise even enough corn to feed the few head of stock
which they possessed, notwithstanding the advantage they enjoyed
in having convict labour at their disposal. Possibly the officers
were too much concerned about matters of domestic convenience to
turn their attention to the cultivation of the ground, but
however that may be, Phillip seems to have thought that convicts
were wasted in being turned over to the military to be employed
for private purposes. <a href="#note-038" name="noteref-038" id=
"noteref-038">{14}</a> His policy was to keep as many convicts as
he could employed in the field, so that as large a return as
possible might be made from the soil. He was desirous of giving
convicts to settlers, who would see that their labour was not
thrown away, but he did not care to waste them upon those who
were unable or unwilling to turn them to good account. "The
giving convicts to the officers", he wrote on the 12th February,
1790, "has been hitherto necessary, but it is attended with many
inconveniences, for which the advantages arising to the officers
do not make amends. It will not, therefore, be continued after
the detachment is relieved, unless particularly directed."
<a href="#note-039" name="noteref-039" id="noteref-039">{15}</a>
In another despatch of about the same date he
remarked:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It may be necessary to grant land to officers and
soldiers who, becoming settlers, will, of course, be entitled to
every indulgence; but few of the officers now here have reaped
any great advantage from being allowed convicts; and it is
attended with unavoidable inconveniences, from the convicts being
left so much to themselves, and from their mixing with the
soldiers. It may be found more to the advantage of the Crown, and
the officers likewise, if officers on duty in this settlement
were allowed a certain quantity of grain to support their live
stock until they have a market to go to." <a href="#note-040"
name="noteref-040" id="noteref-040">{16}</a></blockquote>
<p>But Phillip's views did not commend themselves to the British
Government, and the practice of allowing convict labour to
officers for agricultural purposes was continued for many years
afterwards.</p>
<p>With the advent of the year 1790 the crisis became acute.
<a href="#note-041" name="noteref-041" id="noteref-041">{17}</a>
The long-expected ships from England were watched for with
feverish anxiety, and with the view of discovering their
appearance on the coast at the earliest possible moment, a
lookout station was established at South Head, where a flagstaff
was erected from which the arrival of vessels might be signalled
to Sydney Cove. <a href="#note-042" name="noteref-042" id=
"noteref-042">{18}</a> The officer first placed in charge of the
station was Mr. Daniel Southwell, one of the mates of H.M.S.
Sirius, who had a small party of the ship's company under his
command. <a href="#note-043" name="noteref-043" id=
"noteref-043">{19}</a></p>
<p>The main purpose of the Lookout was to signal the arrival of
ships, and a flagstaff was erected near the spot where the
signal-house now stands. At a later stage it was decided to erect
a column as a "mark for shipping"; and in the Southwell
correspondence there is a sketch in outline showing the
"Projection of a column raised as a mark for shipping on the
South Head of Port Jackson, by his Excellency Governor Phillip,
1790." The sketch <a href="#note-044" name="noteref-044" id=
"noteref-044">{20}</a> bears the endorsement, in Southwell's
handwriting, "This projection, by the hand of his Excellency
G.P., done at the Lookout Post, Pt. Jackson." <a href="#note-045"
name="noteref-045" id="noteref-045">{21}</a></p>
<p>The structure served as a lookout, as well as a mark for
shipping, for Southwell, writing on the 27th July, 1790,
says:&mdash;"Here where I reside the stone is now shaping for a
lookout to be built on the high land by the flagstaff, and to
command a good view of the offing." <a href="#note-046" name=
"noteref-046" id="noteref-046">{22}</a></p>
<p>No column such as that shown in the "projection" can now be
seen at South Head, but on the spot which it probably occupied
stands the signal-house, erected forty or fifty years ago. It is
built of stone, and it may possibly rest upon the foundations
that were laid for Phillip's column.</p>
<p>At the foot of the rocky declivity, near the Watson's Bay
pier, on a level grassy spot, which looked like "a pleasant
lawn", there had been erected a few modest dwellings, which
Southwell sometimes calls "cottages", and at other times "huts".
These were occupied by the Lookout party, which consisted of less
than a dozen men. There was also a little garden, at one time in
a flourishing condition. In July, 1790, it exhibited "a pleasing
prospect of vegetation", containing, as it did, seven or eight
thousand young plants. <a href="#note-047" name="noteref-047" id=
"noteref-047">{23}</a> Southwell writes 27th July,
1790:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Our numbers lately were eleven; my companion,
<a href="#note-048" name="noteref-048" id="noteref-048">{24}</a>
self, and seven men are all upon this little settlement; one man
looks out for the expected Gorgon, and is relieved in turn at
every four hours between the dawn and setting of the day. The
Lookout is up a craggy eminence, about a mile from this spot,
where are the houses, or rather white-wash'd cottages, in a
valley adjoining to the garden, and near the beach. The ground
for a good space about here is unusually clear, with here and
there a shrub, and at a distance in passing looks like a pleasant
lawn. We have a rill of fresh water at a stone's throw on each
hand."</blockquote>
<p>The "white-washed cottages" and the garden are no longer to be
seen, but the position they occupied can be made out without much
difficulty. The means of identification are the two rills of
water mentioned by Southwell. One of these little streams runs
through the recreation-ground, and until a few years ago found
its way to the sea through the late Sir John Robertson's garden,
but for convenience' sake it has been diverted from its course.
The other enters the bay on the north side of Bay-street, Between
these two points there is a stretch of level ground occupied by
dwelling-houses. The rills or creeks which were insignificant a
hundred years ago, when the hills from which they flowed were
clothed with scrub and trees, are now almost dry, except in rainy
weather, but their course can be distinctly traced. <a href=
"#note-049" name="noteref-049" id="noteref-049">{25}</a> Of the
garden, which exhibited a hundred years ago such a "pleasing
prospect of vegitation", not a trace remains.</p>
<p>In the month of February, 1790, no ships from England having
arrived, Phillip resolved to send a number of the people to
Norfolk Island, with the object of relieving the principal
settlement. That place was no better provisioned than the parent
colony, and the people who were sent there would, of course, have
to receive from the store at Sydney their proportion of the
provisions, but the soil at Norfolk Island was so productive that
the change was expected to be of much benefit. <a href=
"#note-050" name="noteref-050" id="noteref-050">{26}</a> The
necessary orders were given, and on the 6th March the Sirius and
Supply sailed for Norfolk Island, having on board 65 officers and
men, with 5 women and children from the marine detachment and the
civil department, 116 male and 67 female convicts, with 27
children, in all 280. Major Ross, who received a Commission from
Phillip as Commandant, and went in that capacity to relieve
Lieutenant King, was in charge of the marines; Captain Hunter
commanded the Sirius, and Lieutenant Ball the Supply. These
vessels took away from Sydney nearly one-third of the population.
The numbers of the people in the respective settlements, after
this change was made, were as follows:&mdash;"Norfolk Island,
418; Sydney (including Rose Hill), 591". <a href="#note-051"
name="noteref-051" id="noteref-051">{27}</a> Phillip's reasons
for taking this decisive step are given in his despatch of 11th
April, 1790:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The advantages I expected by sending away such a
number of people was from the little garden-ground they would
leave, and which would assist those who remained, and the fish
which might be caught in the winter would go the further. At the
same time those sent to Norfolk Island would have resources in
the great abundance of vegetables raised there, and in fish and
birds, which this settlement could not afford them." <a href=
"#note-052" name="noteref-052" id=
"noteref-052">{28}</a></blockquote>
<p>The idea was undoubtedly a good one. The settlement, if not in
danger of immediate starvation, was yet in a precarious
condition, and it was important not only to conserve the salt
provisions, but to make the products of the soil, moderate enough
in quantity, go as far as possible.</p>
<p>Clearing fresh ground was a laborious and tedious process,
while the necessities of the people were immediate and pressing.
At Norfolk Island less clearing had to be done. and the returns
from the soil were both larger and quicker than at Sydney,
<a href="#note-053" name="noteref-053" id="noteref-053">{29}</a>
Phillip felt no anxiety regarding the people he had sent away by
the Sirius and Supply, and their absence placed at the disposal
of those who were left a quantity of ground already in
cultivation, together with a few head of live stock. No sooner
had the vessels left than Phillip set about distributing the
plots of garden-ground amongst those convicts who had been, up to
that time, without gardens, some of them without huts. The
results of this considerate and well-judged action will be seen
later on. In one direction the convicts did their best to
neutralise the good which Phillip was trying to do them. With
reckless selfishness they killed most of the live stock in their
possession, heedless of the fact that they were destroying the
means upon which their support in the future largely depended.
They were, apparently, impelled to this suicidal course by the
fear that, when the salt meat was exhausted, their stock would be
seized by Government.</p>
<p>In the despatches which he wrote in April, 1790, Phillip made
no reference to the circumstance. Possibly he thought that,
considering the difficulty of finding food for the stock, it
would be better, as the evil had been done, to let them go. That
there was some cause for the belief that the stock would be taken
over by Government is evident from the following passage in
Phillip's letter to Nepean of 16th April:&mdash;"Although the
live stock in the settlement is very inconsiderable, I was
desirous of what there is being given up for the publick, but the
general opinion was that the hogs (which are the principal part
of our live stock) were, most of them, so poor that those which
would be found fit to kill would not be an object; the Commissary
has purchased some, which have been served to the people."
<a href="#note-054" name="noteref-054" id=
"noteref-054">{30}</a></p>
<p>Whatever relief was ultimately gained by sending off so large
a swarm from the hive, the advantage was not immediately felt,
except by those convicts who exchanged "wretched hovels" or "no
shelter at all" for comfortable huts in garden-grounds. The
gardens, indeed, were of little use to anyone for a time, for the
convicts, whose food was reduced stage by stage until it was less
than half the usual ration, were too weak to do much work. Indeed
labour was scarcely expected from them. <a href="#note-055" name=
"noteref-055" id="noteref-055">{31}</a></p>
<p>Upon the officers and civilians who were left behind the
departure of so many people produced a depressing effect. "The
military quarters", says Collins, "had a deserted aspect, and the
whole settlement appeared as if famine had already thinned it of
half its numbers. The little society that was in the place was
broken up, and every man seemed left to brood in solitary silence
over the dreary prospect before him." <a href="#note-056" name=
"noteref-056" id="noteref-056">{32}</a> The long-expected ships
appeared to be as far off as ever, and the only thing that could
be anticipated with anything like confidence was the posting of a
General Order making a further reduction in the scanty allowance
of food.</p>
<p>The convicts at Sydney, under the pressure of hunger, robbed
the private gardens. When a thief was caught he was severely
punished, but the dread of the lash did not have much effect. The
depredations were continued in spite of the rigorous measures
adopted by the authorities. Even the Governors's garden was
frequently robbed. This was ingratitude of the basest kind, for
Phillip did not keep the produce of his ground for himself or his
friends, but caused a considerable portion of it to be
distributed among the convicts. <a href="#note-057" name=
"noteref-057" id="noteref-057">{33}</a> Under the circumstances,
however, it is not surprising that robberies were common. It was
noticed that the convicts at Rose Hill "conducted themselves with
much greater propriety, not a theft nor any act of ill-behaviour
having been for some time past heard of among them. <a href=
"#note-058" name="noteref-058" id="noteref-058">{34}</a> How it
came about that the convicts in one of the settlements were
behaving so well, while in the other they were pillaging the
gardens right and left, would probably have remained an insoluble
mystery to the readers of Collins's book, but for the statement
made in a footnote that the convicts at Rose Hill had "vegetables
in great abundance". Those at Sydney had scarcely any.</p>
<p>Shortly after the departure of convicts and marines for
Norfolk Island, Phillip directed a further reduction to be made
in the ration. On November 1st, 1789, the whole of the
settlement, as stated on a previous page, <a href="#note-059"
name="noteref-059" id="noteref-059">{35}</a> was placed on
two-thirds allowance. On the 27th March, 1790, the Governor
directed that on and after the 1st of the following month the
weekly ration "to be issued to every person in the settlement
without distinction" was to be:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Four pounds of flour,<br>
Two pounds and a half of pork, and<br>
One pound and a half of rice.</p>
<p>It was also directed that the hours of labour for the convicts
should cease at 1 p.m., and that provisions should be served from
the store daily instead of semi-weekly.</p>
<p>Five days after this order came into force, the Supply
returned to Sydney with tidings of the wreck of the Sirius on
Norfolk Island. No lives had been lost; but at the time when the
Supply sailed from the island it was uncertain whether the
provisions on board the Sirius would be saved. So serious was the
situation that Phillip called together the whole of the officers,
civil and military. The result of their deliberations was that
the ration was still further reduced to:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Two pounds and a half of flour,<br>
Two pounds of pork, and<br>
Two pounds of rice,</p>
<p>for seven people for one day.</p>
<p>All were to be treated alike, with the exception of children
under eighteen months of age, whose ration of pork was to be one
pound only.</p>
<p>Both at Sydney and Botany Bay, fishing-boats were employed on
the public account; more stringent efforts were made to prevent
the gardens of the industrious being looted at night; <a href=
"#note-060" name="noteref-060" id="noteref-060">{36}</a> parties
were told off to range the woods for game, and every effort was
made to save a pound of salt provisions. Even with so severe a
reduction in the allowance, <a href="#note-061" name=
"noteref-061" id="noteref-061">{37}</a> the provisions in store
would not hold out more than three or four months; and if relief
had not arrived when it did&mdash;in June&mdash;a still further
reduction would have become necessary.</p>
<p>Phillip's efforts to add to the stock of food by fishing and
shooting were but moderately successful. The seines were
constantly in use; but, whether it was that fish were unusually
scarce, or that the season of the year was unfavourable for
netting, or that the fishermen were wanting in skill, certain it
is that the food obtained in this way was generally small and
always precarious. Occasionally a good haul was made, and fish
was served out in lieu of beef or pork; but, at best, the food
obtained in this way was unimportant in quantity. <a href=
"#note-062" name="noteref-062" id="noteref-062">{38}</a> It
scarcely made up for the "loss on every cask" of salt meat,
which, according to Phillip, amounted to "some pounds". Still it
was a help, and Phillip was thankful for it. The quest for game
was so unsuccessful that the parties were disbanded and the men
sent back to their ordinary employments. <a href="#note-063"
name="noteref-063" id="noteref-063">{39}</a> The real dependence
of the settlement was upon the storeships from England.</p>
<p>The official despatches and private letters written at this
time are almost entirely confined to the one topic&mdash;the
scarcity of provisions. The question of how to feed the people
was so urgent and so difficult that matters of less moment,
though important in themselves, were lost sight of. But if the
people were ill-fed, they were equally ill-clad, and were in need
of many other necessaries, particularly tools and implements.
Even if the storeships had arrived before it became necessary to
reduce the ration, great inconvenience would have been caused by
the insufficient supplies of clothing, boots and shoes, and
agricultural and other implements sent out by the First Fleet. In
his earliest despatches, Phillip strongly urged that more should
be sent without delay. But at the time now referred to (April,
1790) nothing had been received for nearly three years, and most
of the people were half-naked as well as half-starved. The
officers brought out private stocks of wearing apparel, but those
who depended upon the Government stores&mdash;and they
constituted well-nigh the entire population&mdash;were reduced to
sore straits. The distress of the lower classes was aggravated by
the approach of winter. The convicts&mdash;male and
female&mdash;with difficulty pieced together rags to cover their
nakedness. The soldiers were not much better off. The majority of
them were forced to appear on guard barefooted, and many both
amongst the soldiers and convicts were so emaciated that they
were physically incapable of performing their accustomed
tasks.</p>
<p>At such a time of want the rites of hospitality were
necessarily curtailed. The man who by a happy chance increased
his stock of food by aid of fowling-piece or rod could offer his
guests no bread; and invitations to dine, even at Government
House, contained the stereotyped request, "Please bring your own
bread." <a href="#note-064" name="noteref-064" id=
"noteref-064">{40}</a> As to the want of other necessaries of the
commonest kind, we could not have a more telling instance than
the naive remark made by Phillip in one of his despatches
<a href="#note-065" name="noteref-065" id="noteref-065">{41}</a>
:&mdash;"Two or three hundred iron fryingpans will be a saving of
spades." When the people were obliged to use spades instead of
fryingpans, hardly any better proof could be furnished of the low
condition to which the commissariat had been reduced. In fact, so
great was the dearth of cooking-utensils, and even of spades,
that some of the convicts, rather than wait until their turn came
for the use of a make-shift fryingpan, ate their food raw, and
died in consequence.</p>
<p>One of the noteworthy incidents that occurred during this
trying time was the escape of Bennilong, the native, who had been
captured in November, 1789, and had been living under friendly
restraint at Government House. He was a great favourite with
Phillip, and afterwards became quite domesticated. He had been
carefully watched, as his determination to get away, if he could,
was well known; but one night he eluded the vigilance of his
custodians and made off into the bush. Love of liberty alone
would doubtless have impelled him to make his escape, but his
desire for freedom was sharpened by the impoverished state of the
public larder. The natives are great eaters, and Bennilong was no
exception to the rule. Southwell, in one of his letters, wrote
<a href="#note-066" name="noteref-066" id="noteref-066">{42}</a>
:&mdash;"'Tis certain he can manage the share of six men with
great ease at one meal." The half-ration which he received at
this time in common with every other person at the settlement
must have seemed to the voracious savage nothing better than a
hollow mockery. A week's allowance. Tench says, was insufficient
to have kept him for a day. "The deficiency was supplied by fish,
whenever it could be procured, and a little Indian corn which had
been reserved, was ground and appropriated to his use. In spite
of all these aids, want of food has been known to make him
furious, and often melancholy." <a href="#note-067" name=
"noteref-067" id="noteref-067">{43}</a> Bennilong made his escape
on the 3rd May, and was not seen, again for some months.
Eventually he was induced to return to the settlement
voluntarily, and became greatly attached to Phillip, with whom he
went to England, in December, 1792.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the critical position of affairs, Phillip did
not lose courage. He was confident that relief from England must
come very soon, and he never allowed himself to utter a word of
doubt on the subject. But while looking with hourly anxiety for a
signal at the South Head announcing the arrival of a ship from
England, he ordered the Supply, immediately after her return from
Norfolk Island with the unwelcome news of the loss of the Sirius,
to be got ready for Batavia. Her commander. Lieutenant Ban, was
directed to call at Norfolk Island, and take on board Lieutenant
Bradley, of H.M.S. Sirius. On arriving at Batavia, he was to
ship, at once, eight months' supplies for the ship's company;
make immediate arrangements for the purchase of the following
provisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>charter a suitable vessel for the conveyance of the same to

possible speed to Sydney Cove.</p>
<p>The stock of provisions in the public store on the 13th April,
1790 (four days before the departure of the Supply), was as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<table align="center">
<tr>

<p>The meat, at the rate then issued, would last until 26th
August; the rice and pease, until the 13th September; and the
flour and biscuit, until the 19th December.</p>
<p>There was another resource, but of so slight a character that
Phillip would hardly have deemed it worthy of notice under
different circumstances. The grain obtained from the harvest in
December, 1789, had been set apart for seed, but as it was found
impossible, owing to the debility of the workers, to prepare
enough ground for all that had been gathered, there was a surplus
of about one hundred and fifty bushels, which was to be served to
the people when the rice had been expended. A hundred and fifty
bushels would not have gone far among five hundred people, but
Phillip attached importance to this little stock of grain, and he
was encouraged by the possession of it to tell Nepean that he
should be able to "make the provisions last until the Supply
returns, although no ship from England should arrive." <a href=
"#note-068" name="noteref-068" id="noteref-068">{44}</a> The
Supply did not return from Batavia until the 18th October, and
then she brought only eight months' provisions for her own
people; the Waaksamheyd, the Dutch snow hired at Batavia, and
freighted with stores for the settlement, did not enter Sydney
Cove until the 17th December, more than five months after the
arrival of the Lady Juliana had been hailed by the starving
people with raptures of joy and gratitude.</p>
<p>Phillip seems to have been aware that his hopeful view of the
position was not shared by many at Sydney Cove, for he remarked
at the close of his letter to Nepean:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have thought it necessary to be thus particular as
to the real state of the provisions in the settlement, as I think
it probable that report may make our situation more unpleasant
than it really is."</blockquote>
<p>The actual situation was certainly "unpleasant" enough; and
Phillip was right in supposing that report would represent it as
more serious than it was described in his optimistic
despatches.</p>
<p>He could not fail to notice, both in his intercourse with his
staff and at every step he took abroad, the despondency that had
settled upon the community; and he knew full well that it would
find expression in the letters of both soldiers and convicts.
Unfavourable accounts did reach England, and were published in
the London papers. The names of the writers, with one exception,
<a href="#note-069" name="noteref-069" id="noteref-069">{45}</a>
were not given, but their identity must have been an open
secret&mdash;in the colony at any rate. The majority of the
letters were published as from "officers" stationed at "Botany
Bay". <a href="#note-070" name="noteref-070" id=
"noteref-070">{46}</a></p>
<p>They all tell the one story: The country "will never answer
the intentions of Government", it was "the outcast of God's
works". <a href="#note-071" name="noteref-071" id=
"noteref-071">{47}</a> Surgeon White described it as "so
forbidding and so hateful, as only to merit execrations and
curses. . . . The wood is bad, the soil light, poor and sandy,
nor has it anything to recommend it." <a href="#note-072" name=
"noteref-072" id="noteref-072">{48}</a> Another letter, in which
it is not difficult to trace the hand of Captain Tench,
represented the country as "very wretched, and totally incapable
of yielding to Great Britain a return for colonizing it. . . .
The dread of perishing by famine stares us in the face." <a href=
"#note-073" name="noteref-073" id="noteref-073">{49}</a> The
country contained "less resources than any in the known world".
<a href="#note-074" name="noteref-074" id="noteref-074">{50}</a>
One officer remarked that he could not, without "neglect of my
duty to my country", refrain from declaring, that if a
"favourable picture" had been drawn, it was a "gross falsehood
and base deception" <a href="#note-075" name="noteref-075" id=
"noteref-075">{51}</a> &mdash;the country "had no one thing to
recommend it". Foremost in the ranks of the malcontents stood
Ross. In July, 1788, he assured Nepean, "in confidence", that
although corn might grow, yet the country would not support
itself for a "hundred years". His own solution of the
transportation question was&mdash;that it would be "cheaper to
feed the convicts on turtle and venison at the London Tavern than
be at the expence of sending them here." <a href="#note-076"
name="noteref-076" id="noteref-076">{52}</a> Writing to Nepean
some months later, he informed him, "as this letter is only for
your private perusal," that "in the whole world there is not a
worse country than what we have yet seen of this. All that is
contiguous to us is so very barren and forbidding, that it may
with truth be said, here nature is reversed; and, if not so, she
is nearly worn out; for almost all the seed we have put into the
ground has rotted, and I have no doubt but will, like the wood of
this vile country, when burned or rotten, turn to sand." <a href=
"#note-077" name="noteref-077" id="noteref-077">{53}</a></p>
<p>The <i>Public Advertiser</i> of 28th December, 1790, summed up
the news from "Botany Bay" in a few words:&mdash;"The flourishing
state of the colony at Botany Bay has certainly been contradicted
by all private letters."</p>
<p>Phillip's suspicion&mdash;or it would be better, perhaps, to
say his knowledge&mdash;that accounts less favourable than his
own would find their way to England was, therefore, justified by
the event. It would have been wrong for him to write as an
alarmist; but it may be questioned whether, under the
circumstances, he did the best for the little community under his
care in speaking so confidently of a position which, short of
absolute starvation, was about as bad as it could be.</p>
<p>That the condition of the settlement was more critical than
Philip was willing to admit in his official despatches, is
evident from the narratives published by officers after their
return to England; and, therefore, at a time when they could
write dispassionately, and without the feeling engendered by the
events of the hour. <a href="#note-078" name="noteref-078" id=
"noteref-078">{54}</a></p>
<p>The Home Department was lamentably ignorant of the true
condition of the settlement, which was expected to be
self-supporting almost from the first. Accident had something to
do with the wretched plight in which the people found themselves
in 1789-90, but on many occasions during the next ten years the
colony was on the brink of starvation, because of the eagerness
of the Government to send out convicts, and its remissness in
forwarding the necessary supplies. <a href="#note-079" name=
"noteref-079" id="noteref-079">{55}</a> If Phillip, and those who
immediately succeeded him, had represented the case more
forcibly, the British Government might possibly have realised
sooner than it did its duties and responsibilities in connection
with a colony so far distant from regular food supplies.</p>

Collins is slightly at variance with Phillip on this point. He
says the ships' companies were placed upon two-thirds allowance.
He pays a tribute to Phillip's humanity&mdash;a quality some
critics have denied him&mdash;by the following allusion to a
circumstance upon which Phillip, in his despatch, was
silent:&mdash;"The Governor, whose humanity was at all times
conspicuous, directed that no alteration should be made in the
ration to be issued to the women. They were already upon
two-thirds of the men's allowance, and many of them either had
children who could very well have eaten their own and part of the
mother's ration, or they had children at the breast, and although
they did not labour, yet their appetites were never so delicate
as to have found the full ration too much had it been issued to
them."</p>

It must be borne in mind that at this time the military officers
had no land of their own. They were allowed to cultivate the soil
and enjoy the produce that was raised, but they had no property
in the land, which belonged to the Crown. This was a standing
grievance with them.&mdash;Post, pp. 119, 252. When the officers
of the New South Wales Corps, two years later, obtained grants of
land and the free use of convict labour, they set to work upon

Some idea of the state of feeling in the community, as the months
rolled on and no relief came, may be gathered from the remarks of
Collins when the ration was reduced in November,
1789:&mdash;"Thus opened the month of November in this
settlement, where, though we had not the accompanying gloom and
vapour of our own climate to render it terrific to our minds, yet
we had that before us, in the midst of all our sunshine, which
gave it the complexion of the true November so inimical to our
countrymen."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 84.</p>

Since vol. i was published, copies of Southwell's Journal and of
a number of letters written by him to his mother, who lived in
Canon-street, London, and to his uncle, the Rev. W. Butler, of
Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, have been received. These papers have been
printed as an Appendix to vol. ii of the Historical Records. The
transcriptions were made at the British Museum, from the original
MSS. and copies in the handwriting of Mr. Butler. This gentleman,
who appears to have taken a lively interest in the fortunes of
the infant colony, showed the letters to Sir Joseph Banks, with
whom he frequently conversed about affairs at Sydney Cove. Sir
Joseph returned the correspondence with a note in which he
offered "many thanks for the perusal of it". He added:&mdash;"The
letters are written with intelligence, but, as is naturally to be
expected, contain little of information not to be met with in the
Governor's despatches. It is indeed surprising that he who lives
at an outpost and makes few visits to the camp should have gained
so much." Banks's comment is accurate enough in one sense. So far
as principal events are concerned, the letters contain no
information that the official despatches do not supply; but
Southwell, whose attention was concentrated on a few subjects,
gives particulars of incidents which were only briefly reported
in Phillip's letters, and he furnishes information concerning the
Lookout Station which is not procurable from any other source.
The allusion to the "Governor's despatches" is worthy of
attention. It has been stated elsewhere (Vol. i, pp. lii, 78
<i>et seq</i>.) that Sir Joseph Banks, who, as regards the
colony, may almost be said to have stood <i>in loco parentis</i>,
had access to the official despatches from Sydney. We have in
this note to Mr. Butler an additional proof that this was so.</p>

"Immediately after the departure of these ships [the Sirius and
the Supply], the Governor directed his attention to the
regulation of the people who were left at Sydney, and to the
preservation of the stock in the colony. For these purposes, he
himself visited the different huts and gardens whose tenants had
just quitted them, distributing them to such convicts as were
either in miserable hovels or without any shelter at all. It was
true that by this arrangement the idle found themselves provided
for by the labour of many who had been industrious; but they were
at the same time assured that unless they kept in good
cultivation the gardens which they were allowed to possess they
would be turned out from the comforts of a good hut, to live
under a rock or a tree. That they might have time for this
purpose, the afternoon of Wednesday and the whole of Saturday in

As several articles had to be dropped out of the dietary scale,
the allowance, according to the view taken by the people, was not
more than one-third of the ordinary ration. Collins puts the
matter thus:&mdash;"On the 20th of the month [April] the
following was the ration issued from the public store to each man
for seven days, or to seven people for one day&mdash;flour, two
and a half pounds; rice, two pounds; pork, two pounds. The pease
were all expended. Was this a ration for a labouring man? The two
pounds of pork, when boiled, shrank away to nothing, and when
divided among seven people for their day's allowance barely
afforded three or four morsels to each."&mdash;Collins, vol. i,
p. 109. On this point Tench has the following:&mdash;"When the
age of this provision is recollected, its inadequacy will more
strikingly appear. The pork and rice were brought with us from
England; the pork has been salted between three and four years,
and every grain of rice was a moving body, from the inhabitants
lodged within it. We soon left off boiling the pork, as it had
become so old and dry, that it shrunk one-half of its dimensions
when so dressed. Our usual method of cooking it was to cut off
the daily morsel, and toast it on a fork before the fire,
catching the drops which fell on a slice of bread, or in a saucer
of rice. Our flour was the remnant of what was brought from the
Cape, by the Sirius, and was good. Instead of baking it, the
soldiers and convicts used to boil it up with
greens."&mdash;Tench, Complete Account, p. 40 (note). According
to the same authority, a woman died from eating too freely of a
"mess of flour and greens".</p>

"The few convicts who had been employed to shoot for individuals
were given up for the public benefit; and a fishery was
established at Botany Bay, under the inspection of one of the
midshipmen of the Sirius. But this plan, not being found to
answer, was soon relinquished. The quantity of fish that was from
time to time taken was very inconsiderable, and the labour of
transporting it by land from thence was greater than the
advantage which was expected to be derived from it. The boats
were therefore recalled, and employed with rather more success at
Sydney."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 106.</p>

"Neither was much advantage obtained by employing people to shoot
for the public. At the end of the month only three small
kangaroos had been brought in."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 106.
Writing a month later (May, 1790), Collins stated:&mdash;"The
expedient of shooting for the public not being found to answer
the expectations which had been formed of it, sixty pounds of
pork only having been saved, the game-killers were called in, and
the general exertion was directed to the business of fishing. The
seine and the hook and lines were employed, and with various
success, the best of which afforded but a very trifling
relief."&mdash;Ib., p. 110. "The greatest quantity of fish caught
at any one time in this month [May] was two hundred pounds. Once
the seine was full, but, through either the wilfulness or the
ignorance of the people employed to land it, the greatest part of
its contents escaped. Upwards of two thousand pounds were taken
in the course of the month, which produced a saving of five
hundred pounds of pork at the store, the allowance of thirty-one
men for four weeks."&mdash;Ib., pp. 113-114.</p>

Captain Tench wrote:&mdash;"Our impatience of news from Europe
strongly marked the commencement of the year [1790]. We had now
been two years in the country, and thirty-two months from
England, in which long period no supplies, except what had been
procured at the Cape of Good Hope by the Sirius, had reached us.
From intelligence of our fiends and connections we had been
entirely cut off, no communication whatever having passed with
our native country since the 13th of May, 1787, the day of our
departure from Portsmouth. Famine besides was approaching with
gigantic strides, and gloom and dejection overspread every
countenance. Men abandoned themselves to the most desponding
reflections, and adopted the most extravagant
conjectures."&mdash;Tench, Complete Account, p. 37. That the
position was one of actual famine is shown by Tench in another
passage:&mdash;"Three or four instances of persons who perished
from want have been related to me. One only, however, fell within
my own observation&mdash;I was passing the provision store, when
a man, with a wild haggard countenance, who had just received his
daily pittance to carry home, came out. His faltering gait, and
eager devouring eye, led me to watch him: and he had not
proceeded ten steps before he fell. I ordered him to be carried
to the hospital, where, when he arrived, he was found dead. On
opening the body, the cause of death was pronounced to be
<i>inanition</i>."&mdash;Ib., p. 43 (note). The late Dr. Lang
wrote:&mdash;"A wealthy and respectable inhabitant of Sydney, who
arrived in the colony as a free person during the government of
Governor Phillip, has told me that his ration for a long period
was merely a cob or single head of Indian corn a day, and that
for three years he had lived in the colony in the constant belief
that he should one day perish of hunger."&mdash;Historical and
Statistical Account of New South Wales, 1884 edition, vol. i, p.
53. This statement lacks authority. A "ration" consisting of a
cob of Indian corn per day was certainly never issued during
Phillip's Governorship, nor probably at any other time.</p>

In March, 1792, Phillip wrote to Nepean, stating that he was
anxiously awaiting supplies; that the settlement had been on a
reduced ration since 1789; and that the people were suffering
from hunger, and were becoming alarmed.&mdash;Historical Records,
vol. i, part 2, pp. 610-612. In April, 1794, when the William
arrived, all the provisions, according to Lieutenant-Governor
Grose, had been issued from the store six hours before she
appeared in sight. The flour sent from England had been expended
some months before.&mdash;Historical Records, vol. ii, pp. 207,
208. On 21st December, 1795, Governor Hunter wrote to the Duke of
Portland on behalf of "a people nearly naked" (Ib., p. 346), and,
two months later, the Governor received a memorial from the free
settlers stating that as "the late reduced ration" had compelled
them to kill the greater part of their live stock, they could not
support their men with animal food, nor find them clothing, and
asking to be allowed to draw animal food and clothing from the
store. The despatches of Governor King in the years 1800, 1801,
and 1802 show that the ration was frequently reduced because of
the shortness of supplies.</p>

<h3>3. THE WRECK OF THE GUARDIAN. [December,
<small>1789]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>WHILE</small> the settlement was struggling against
internal troubles which taxed all its own resources and all the
ingenuity and good guidance of its Governor, the Guardian, a
44-gun frigate, <a href="#note-080" name="noteref-080" id=
"noteref-080">{1}</a> which was on its way to Sydney with a large
stock of provisions and clothing, met with a disastrous accident
some 500 leagues from the Cape of Good Hope. On the 23rd
December, 1789, <a href="#note-081" name="noteref-081" id=
"noteref-081">{2}</a> in thick and stormy weather, she struck an
"island of ice", and after being deserted by most of her officers
and crew, was taken to Table Bay in a sinking state. She was only
saved from foundering by the strenuous and heroic exertions of
her commander. Lieutenant Riou, and a handful of men. Their
voyage of eight weeks in a water-logged vessel is one of the most
remarkable on record. It exhibits the bravery and devotion of
"the gallant and good Captain Riou". <a href="#note-082" name=
"noteref-082" id="noteref-082">{3}</a> in a conspicuous light.
But the vessel, though brought safely into port, had been injured
so seriously that the cost of repairing her would have exceeded
that of a new ship: she was accordingly beached at Table Bay, and
there abandoned. Some of her stores were saved, and a small
portion was sent on by the Lady Juliana, which arrived at Sydney
on the 3rd June, 1790, bringing at the same time the first news
of the disaster. Before meeting with the accident, the Guardian
had taken on board at the Cape a quantity of live stock for the
use of the settlement, all of which had to be sacrificed to save
the ship. She carried also, at the instance of Sir Joseph Banks,
a "plant-cabin" or "coach"; in other words, a temporary
compartment constructed on deck "for the purpose of conveying to
Port Jackson, in pots of earth, such trees and plants as will be
useful in food or physic, and cannot conveniently be propagated
by seed, and for bringing from thence any useful productions."
<a href="#note-083" name="noteref-083" id="noteref-083">{4}</a>
The trees and plants never reached the colony, but the experiment
was renewed with success some years afterwards.</p>
<p>The Guardian was one of the first ships equipped for the
relief of the settlement. Nepean wrote to Phillip on the 20th
June, 1789, stating that she would "sail in about a fortnight",
and, although she did not actually leave England until September,
her sailing qualities were so good that she would have arrived at
Sydney long before the Lady Juliana, which sailed from England
two months earlier. <a href="#note-084" name="noteref-084" id=
"noteref-084">{5}</a> The Guardian arrived at the Cape on her
passage from England in November, and put back to Table Bay after
her accident on the 21st February, about a week before the Lady
Juliana reached that port. It will thus be seen that the frigate
made the passage from England to the Cape in two months, while
the storeship took at least seven months to cover the same
distance.</p>
<p>When on Christmas Day, 1789, the "boats left what everyone
regarded as a sinking ship, Riou went into his cabin and wrote a
short but pathetic letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty. It
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blok" align="right">"H.M. Guardian, 25 Dec.,
1789,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"Lat 44&deg; S., Long. 40&deg; E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>"Sir,<br>
<br>
"If any part of the officers or crew of the Guardian should ever
survive to get home, I have only to say their conduct after the
fatal stroke against an island of ice was admirable and wonderful
in everything that related to their duties, considered either as
private men or on his Majesty's service.<br>
<br>
"As there seems to be no possibility of my remaining many hours
in this world, I beg leave to recommend to the consideration of
the Admiralty a sister, who, if my conduct or services should be
found deserving any memory, their favours might be shown to her,
together with a widowed mother. <a href="#note-085" name=
"noteref-085" id="noteref-085">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p class="blok" align="right">I am, &amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"E. RIOU."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Riou was without hope, or, if he entertained any, it was of
the faintest kind, but he conceived it to be his duty to remain
by the vessel. <a href="#note-086" name="noteref-086" id=
"noteref-086">{7}</a> He had only time to write a few lines, and
he took advantage of the opportunity to praise the conduct of the
officers and crew, and to commend his mother and sister to the
consideration of the naval authorities. He had no thought for
himself but to express the hope that his memory might be
honoured. This little note, written when death seemed to be close
at hand, bears testimony to Riou's generosity and
self-abnegation. But the brave officer was not to die then. After
an heroic struggle, he brought the Guardian into Table Bay, from
which place, on the 22nd February, 1790, he wrote to the
Secretary of the Admiralty announcing his arrival, and stating
that on the 25th December, "all hope of her safety being
banished, I consented to as many of the officers and people to
take to the boats as thought proper. But it pleased Almighty God
to assist my endeavours with the remaining part of the crew to
arrive with his Majesty's ship in this bay yesterday." He was
anxious that this note should reach the Admiralty before the loss
of his ship could be reported, but he was disappointed. The news
of the condition in which the Guardian was when the boats put off
from her had been carried to England, where it created a profound
impression.</p>
<p>No wonder that the report was received with dismay. The
Guardian had been fitted out at great expense, and she carried,
besides nearly two years' provisions for the colony, Sir Joseph
Banks's "plant-cabin", upon which much care had been bestowed.
<a href="#note-087" name="noteref-087" id="noteref-087">{8}</a>
It also happened that one of the midshipmen who remained with
Riou in the water-logged ship was the Hon. Thomas Pitt, the only
son of Lord Camelford, a near relative of Lord Chatham, First
Lord of the Admiralty. <a href="#note-088" name="noteref-088" id=
"noteref-088">{9}</a></p>
<p>Riou's second letter <a href="#note-089" name="noteref-089"
id="noteref-089">{10}</a> to the Admiralty was scarcely longer
than the first. He excused himself for its brevity because a
Dutch packet was about to sail for Europe, and because "I find it
more necessary than ever to exert myself in order to prevent the
ship from sinking at her anchors." But Riou was not in a
condition to write long despatches. He had suffered greatly from
fatigue, exposure, and anxiety, and, according to his own
statement, had been unable since the accident to hold a pen or
keep a journal. <a href="#note-090" name="noteref-090" id=
"noteref-090">{11}</a> He had sustained painful
injuries&mdash;his hand had been crushed and his leg
hurt&mdash;but he said nothing of these things to Mr. Secretary
Stephens.</p>
<p>It was part of Riou's duty as captain to furnish a detailed
account of the accident to the Admiralty, but no such report has
been found among the Records. Many accounts, however, found their
way to London, and were published in the newspapers of the time.
<a href="#note-091" name="noteref-091" id=
"noteref-091">{12}</a></p>
<p>The boatswain of the Guardian, John Williams, writing from
Table Bay, on the 27th March, gave a blunt but interesting
account of the accident and the perilous passage of the
water-logged vessel to the Cape. According to his version,
<a href="#note-092" name="noteref-092" id="noteref-092">{13}</a>
the Guardian came into collision with an "island of ice", which
knocked away the rudder, broke the tiller in three pieces, broke
one of the after-beams in two, knocked the sternpost from the
keel, and "damaged the ship in a shocking manner". The handful of
men left on board had little hope of saving their lives, for the
vessel was almost unmanageable, and sixteen feet of water in the
hold was "the common run".</p>
<p>An interesting account of the appearance of the vessel and her
crew when she put back into the Cape of Good Hope was published
in the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i> of 31st July, 1790. She had nine
feet of water in her hold when she anchored. The lower gun-deck
is described as serving as a second bottom. Riou was clad in the
"rags of the meanest sailor". The crew "looked like men from
another world&mdash;long beards, dirt, and rags covered them".
The captain declared that his principal care had been to keep up
the spirits of his crew, and "watch over their health". <a href=
"#note-093" name="noteref-093" id="noteref-093">{14}</a></p>
<p>The shattered condition of the Guardian and the fruitless
efforts that were made to repair her are described in the
commander's letters to the Admiralty. <a href="#note-094" name=
"noteref-094" id="noteref-094">{15}</a> Riou exerted himself to
the utmost, but he had to give up the attempt. He wrote on the
7th March that the cost of repairing and refitting the ship would
probably exceed that of a new one, and intimated his intention of
having her towed to Saldhana Bay, where she could be hove
down.</p>
<p>Finding, however, that he could not get the vessel under weigh
with any prospect of safety, he ordered a survey to be made of
the hull, employing for the purpose the officers under his
command, and asking also assistance from the Governor of the
Cape. <a href="#note-095" name="noteref-095" id=
"noteref-095">{16}</a> The master, boatswain, and carpenter of
the Guardian reported that it would be impossible to put the ship
in repair; and two captains of the Dutch East India Company's
ships and three carpenters, who surveyed the vessel at the
request of the Governor of the Cape, made a similar report.
<a href="#note-096" name="noteref-096" id="noteref-096">{17}</a>
Thereupon, Lieutenant Riou, to save the useless expense of
keeping the vessel afloat in Table Bay, gave up the idea of
taking her to Saldhana Bay, and had her hauled on shore, where
she served for a time as a habitation for the crew. Her complete
destruction by wind and weather was only a question of time. In
the <i>Naval Chronicle</i> it is stated that the Guardian almost
immediately after her return to the Cape was driven on shore in a
hurricane and destroyed, and the statement is repeated by writers
of Australian history, apparently on this authority. But Riou's
report to the Admiralty shows that nothing of the sort occurred.
The vessel was deliberately laid on shore, and had not broken up
when her commander left the Cape.</p>
<p>The behaviour of the convicts on board the Guardian won Riou's
admiration and gratitude. Writing from the Cape, on the 20th May,
1790, <a href="#note-097" name="noteref-097" id=
"noteref-097">{18}</a> he spoke of the twenty convicts which his
duty compelled him to send to Port Jackson, and stated that but
for their assistance and support the Guardian would never have
got back to Table Bay. He added:&mdash;"Their conduct prior to
the melancholy accident that happened on the 23rd of December
last was always such as may be commended, and from their first
entrance into the ship at Spithead they ever assisted and did
their duty in like manner as the crew." With the object of
encouraging the men in the hour of peril, Riou told them that so
far as depended upon him "not one of them should ever be
convicts", and he asked the Lords of the Admiralty, through
Secretary Stephens, to give effect to his promise. Riou's
confidence in the justice of the Admiralty was not misplaced. His
suggestion was adopted, and on the 16th November, 1790, Grenville
wrote a letter to Governor Phillip directing him to issue his
warrant for the pardon of the convicts in question, on condition,
however, "of their continuing abroad in such parts or places as
may be hereafter directed by you for the terms specified in their
several sentences of transportation." <a href="#note-098" name=
"noteref-098" id="noteref-098">{19}</a> Phillip carried out his
instructions, which he interpreted to mean that the convicts were
to remain in the colony until their sentences had expired.
<a href="#note-099" name="noteref-099" id=
"noteref-099">{20}</a></p>
<p>It is also satisfactory to know that Riou's conduct all
through met with the approval of the authorities in England.
Writing to him, on the 9th October, 1790, on behalf of the Lords
of the Admiralty, Mr. Secretary Stephens wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have their Lordships' commands to acquaint you
that their concern on the receipt of the melancholy contents of
the first-mentioned letter [the letter of the 25th December,
1789] could only be exceeded by the satisfaction they received
from the account of your miraculous escape, which they attribute
to your skilful and judicious exertions under the favour of
Divine Providence. And I am further to acquaint you that their
Lordships entirely approve of your having sent on to the
settlement of Hew South Wales, by the transports which touched at
the Cape on their way thither, such of the convicts and
superintendents of convicts as had survived, and of all your
other proceedings so far as the same have come to their
knowledge." <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100" id=
"noteref-100">{21}</a></blockquote>
<p>This will hardly be considered extravagant praise under the
circumstances, but it was not usual in those days for official
approval to be expressed in anything but the coldest and briefest
language. Phillip's services in New South Wales during his five
years' tenure of office were of incalculable value, but the words
of mild approval which he received in the official despatches
were very meagre.</p>
<p>The valuable cargo with which the Guardian was freighted,
though greatly damaged, was not entirely lost. The salt
provisions, with the exception of a few casks, were perfectly
sound. About two hundred casks of flour, which had been stowed on
the lower deck, were saved; but all the clothing, naval stores,
medicines, &amp;c., had either been thrown overboard to lighten
the vessel, or were more or less damaged. There was,
unfortunately, no opportunity of sending more than a small part
of the undamaged cargo to Sydney; and after being kept in
store-houses, specially hired for the purpose, for a considerable
time, the bulk of it was divided among the men-of-war which
happened to put in at the Cape. Captain Blankett, who was in
command of two men-of-war, the Leopard and the Thames, completed
his provisions from the Guardian (October, 1790), thus avoiding
the purchase of stores at the Cape, where everything was "raised
to an extravagant price". <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"
id="noteref-101">{22}</a> As the Gorgon, from England to Port
Jackson, was expected to arrive soon at the Cape, a portion of
the stores was reserved for her use, and the rest left in the
hands of agents for sale. The Gorgon did not arrive until the
22nd June, 1791, and in the interval the Government had been
paying at the rate of 30 rix dollars each per month for the hire
of two store-houses. The Chatham, Discovery, and Minerva, at
different times, took portions of the stores, and the Gorgon
having been supplied with what she wanted, the remainder, which
was of little value, was sold by auction. What the Gorgon took on
board was of some advantage, but on the whole the settlement
profited very little from the valuable cargo sent by the
Guardian; the vessel, so far as the material wants of the colony
were concerned, might as well have gone down at sea with
everything on board.</p>
<p>The loss of the Guardian was not a public misfortune only, it
told severely on individuals in the community. Friends of the
officers in England, knowing that they would be in want of many
necessaries, sent out supplies by this vessel. Thinking that the
gun-room was a safer place than the hold, these precious goods
were stored in that part of the ship, but, as it happened, the
choice was the very worst that could have been made. When the
Guardian, after striking the iceberg, got clear off, she was
found to be making water rapidly, and the first object of her
commander was to lighten the ship. The live stock and Sir Joseph
Banks's "plant-cabin" went overboard to begin with, and then the
gun-room was swept. Some of the officers, Collins says, were
"great losers". All sorts and conditions of people at the
settlement, therefore, had good reason to remember the loss of
the Guardian. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102" id=
"noteref-102">{23}</a></p>
<p>The moral as well as the material welfare of the colony
suffered. Among the persons on board the Guardian was the Rev.
John Crowther, who had been appointed at "a salary of eight
shillings per diem" to be assistant chaplain of the settlement.
<a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103" id="noteref-103">{24}</a>
He was one of those who left the vessel in the long-boat, and was
rescued with the master, Mr. Clements, and others by a French
vessel, which took them to the Cape. Instead of waiting for an
opportunity to continue the voyage to Port Jackson, Mr. Crowther
made the best of his way back to England. The circumstances
attending his appointment and his return to England are told by
the Rev. John Newton, of Olney (the friend and confidant of the
poet Cowper), in a series of letters written by him to the Rev.
R. Johnson, chaplain at Sydney. The correspondence forms part of
a collection recently presented to the Religions Tract Society,
London, by the daughter of Mr. George Stokes, founder of the
Parker Society. <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104" id=
"noteref-104">{25}</a> Writing to Mr. Johnson in November, 1789,
Mr. Newton congratulated his friend on being about to receive a
valuable co-worker. "I judge", he said, "both from what Mr.
Milner told me of him, and from what I had an opportunity of
knowing of him myself, that he will prove a true helpmeet, a
counsellor, and a friend." Afterwards, it will be seen, his tone
changed materially. Letters from Mr. Crowther reporting the
accident to the Guardian and his arrival at the Cape were
received on the afternoon of the 23rd April, "and the very next
morning," wrote Mr. Newton, "he knocked at my door himself, so
that he had nearly startled us by his arrival before we had the
least intimation of what had happened." After saying that Mr.
Crowther, although in good health, had given up the thought of
going out to New South Wales, Mr. Newton remarked:&mdash;"He is
an upright good man, but does not seem to possess that firmness
of spirit which, in my view, is essential to a missionary, and
without which no man in his senses and with his eyes open would
venture upon a voyage to Botany Bay." Returning to the subject a
few months later (March, 1791), Mr. Newton lamented the
difficulty that was experienced in obtaining a second chaplain,
and described Mr. Crowther's attitude towards missionary work at
"Botany Bay" in plain if not complimentary words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The door seems open, but you live in such an
awkward, unpromising comer of the Lord's great house that it is
not easy to find a competent person willing to go to you. It is
not a service for mere flesh and blood to undertake. A man
without that apostolic Spirit and peculiar call which the Lord
alone can give would hardly be able to maintain his ground. Mr.
Crowther, though a sincere, humble, good man^ seems not to have
had those qualifications, and therefore he has been partly
intimidated by what he met with abroad, and partly influenced by
nearer personal considerations at home, to stay with us and sleep
in a whole skin."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Newton is somewhat hard on his brother-worker. The
sufferings and perils that Mr. Crowther went through in the
voyage that ended so unfortunately were enough to discourage any
ordinary man, even though he possessed something of the
missionary spirit; and, as time showed, the object of Mr.
Newton's scorn was not alone in his desire to stop at home and
"sleep in a whole skin", rather than brave the dangers and
difficulties that were supposed to belong to service in the
"awkward, unpromising corner of the Lord's great house" known in
England as "Botany Bay". Writing to Mr. Johnson nearly a year
later (21st January, 1792), Mr. Newton said:&mdash;"Nor have we
yet been able to find a person in the ministry of faith and zeal
sufficient to go over to your assistance." <a href="#note-105"
name="noteref-105" id="noteref-105">{26}</a> The statement was
repeated in a letter dated the 19th July, 1792. <a href=
"#note-106" name="noteref-106" id="noteref-106">{27}</a></p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Newton and his associates were not the only
persons in England who were concerning themselves with the
difficult task of finding another chaplain for New South Wales.
Writing to Mr. Dundas on the 7th of August, 1792, Mr. William
Wilberforce, the philanthropist, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Ever since I spoke to you in the chaise, as we were
coming from Wimbledon, I have been looking out for some fit
clergyman to go out as a chaplain to N. S. Wales, and the
Archbishop of Canterbury, to whom I mentioned the matter
immediately after, has been doing the same." <a href="#note-107"
name="noteref-107" id="noteref-107">{28}</a></blockquote>
<p>He went on to say that, after almost despairing of success, he
had found a clergyman named Porter, who, though reluctantly, had
consented to accept the "situation", and he asked for authority
to tell Mr. Porter that he might have the appointment. What
answer was returned to this letter does not appear, but Mr.
Porter did not go to New South Wales. The reason is not disclosed
in the Records, but there is no ground for supposing that any
obstacle was thrown in the way by Dundas. The probability is that
when it came to the point the reluctance of Mr. Wilberforce's
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> had deepened into a resolution to
decline the responsibility of missionary work in New South
Wales.</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. Johnson had to labour on by himself, under
very great disadvantages. He found enough to do when the country
was first occupied, but the rapid increase in the convict
population, and the establishment of settlements at Parramatta
and Toongabbie, placed the work beyond the power of one man. He
was left in this predicament until March, 1794, when the Rev.
Samuel Marsden, who had accepted the position of assistant
chaplain, arrived by the ship William.</p>
<p>Altogether, the loss of the Guardian was a severe blow to the
colony. She contained a large quantity of stores which it would
have been more prudent to distribute among several vessels. The
mistake was pointed out by Phillip, and it was not repeated, but
when the Guardian struck the iceberg the mischief had been done.
She left England before the settlement was in actual want, and if
no disaster had happened she would have arrived before the worst
pinch was felt. In January, 1790, when she should have arrived at
Port Jackson, the ration had only been slightly reduced,
operations in the fields had not been seriously interfered with,
the live stock had not been sacrificed, and the Governor had not
even considered the propriety of sending a large portion of the
people to Norfolk Island. But by the time the Lady Juliana
arrived with news of the accident to the Guardian the ration had
been brought down almost to starvation point, the people were so
reduced in strength that they were unable to carry on the
cultivation of the soil except in a desultory and ineffective
way, and the Sirius had been sent on her disastrous voyage to
Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>A single accident is rarely followed by such grievous
consequences. If the Guardian had come into port in January or
February, as she might reasonably have been expected to do, the
people would not have been put on starvation allowance, the live
stock would not have been destroyed, the cultivation of the land
would not have been checked, and the Sirius would not have been
cast away at Norfolk Island. The loss of the Guardian is
therefore a memorable incident in Australian history, not only on
account of the heroism displayed by Riou and the handful of men
who assisted him, but by reason of the untoward influence which
the calamity exerted on the fortunes of the colony.</p>

The vessel struck late in the afternoon of 23rd December civil

Riou, who was promoted after his return to England, was killed at
the battle of Copenhagen, on the 2nd April, 1801. He was in
command of the frigate Amazon, and was entrusted by Nelson with
the charge of a division of the fleet, consisting of his own
vessel and the Blanche, Alcmene, Dart, Zephyr, and Otter, some of
them frigates, others sloops. Owing to the intricate nature of
the navigation, the Agamemnon, Bellona, and Russel, ships of the
line, were unable to take the stations that had been assigned to
them. This derangement of the Admiral's plan, in the words of
Nelson's despatch, "unhappily threw the gallant and good Captain
Riou. . . . under a very heavy fire; the consequence has been the
death of Captain Riou and many brave officers and men in the
frigates and sloops."</p>

It is related in contemporary history that this young gentleman
had shown a taste for the naval profession which had excited the
highest disapproval on the part of his family. He was sent out
with the Guardian in the hope that he might be cured of his
passion for the sea. So at least asserts the <i>Public
Advertiser</i>, which published, on the 30th April, 1790, a long
account of the accident to the Guardian and her safe arrival at
the Cape:&mdash;"Mr. Pitt had adopted the naval profession in
positive opposition to the wishes of his noble parent, Lord
Camelford. The voyage was ordered, by an injunction, to make the
young gentleman suffer all the hardships of a seaman, to deter
and disgust him from the pursuit." His unpleasant experiences on
board the Guardian do not appear to have had the desired effect,
for he afterwards joined Captain Vancouver in his expedition with
the Discovery and Chatham. In April, 1794, he arrived at Sydney,
where he learned that his father was dead. He sailed for England
in the Indispensable, in July. When the news of the accident to
the Guardian reached England, Lord Camelford's heir was supposed
to be lost with the others who had remained on board, and the
moment the unexpected intelligence of Riou's arrival at the Cape
was received at the Admiralty, Lord Chatham, we are told, set off
in a chaise and four to convey the joyful intelligence to "his
noble relation".</p>

Historical Records, vol. i, part 2, p. 542. Then was another
condition, viz., that only those who had behaved well in the
colony should receive the pardon. Since, according to Collins
(vol. i, p. 193), only thirteen were emancipated (the warrants
were signed in December, 1791), it follows that six out of the
nineteen who arrived at Sydney (one having died on the voyage)
forfeited the reward they had earned. One of them came to a bad
end shortly after his arrival in the colony. Saving stolen a
sheep from the Commissary, Mr. Palmer, he was tried in the
Criminal Court, convicted, sentenced to death, and executed.
Phillip might have felt disposed, considering the services that
had been rendered by this man on board the Guardian, to show
mercy, but the preservation of the live stock was a matter of
vital importance to the settlement at the time, and the law was
allowed to take its course. Collins finds it necessary to account
for the Governor's refusal to pardon in this case:&mdash;"The
preservation of our stock was an object of so much consequence to
the colony, that it became indispensably necessary to protect it
by every means in our power. Had any lenity been extended to this
offender on account of his good conduct in a particular
situation, it might have been the cause of many depredations
being made upon the stock, which it was hoped his punishment
would prevent."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 132.</p>

<h3>4. THE SECOND FLEET.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> Second Fleet, that is to say the ships
which were sent out from England in the year 1789, consisted of
six vessels&mdash;the Guardian, man-of-war, converted into a
storeship, the Justinian, which brought supplies but no convicts,
and the Lady Juliana, the Surprize, the Neptune, and the
Scarborough, which carried altogether nearly 1,300 prisoners. The
Guardian, as we have seen, was injured by an iceberg, and beached
at Table Bay; the other vessels arrived safely, but under
circumstances as discreditable as they were distressing. The Lady
Juliana, which had sailed from England on the 29th July, 1789,
entered the Heads on the afternoon of the 3rd of June, 1790, and
on the 6th, after a delay of three days, caused by bad weather,
she was towed up to Sydney Cove. As she brought the first direct
news from England that had been received since the Sirius and her
convoy left the Motherbank in May, 1787, more than three years
before, her arrival excited the liveliest joy among the
half-starved and almost despairing people. But the feeling cooled
considerably when it was found that the Lady Juliana carried over
two hundred female convicts, and had on board only a small
quantity of provisions, a portion of which consisted of stores
saved from the wreck of the Guardian. It was better than nothing,
but it was not sufficient to justify any material alteration in
the meagre ration which had been the rule for many months.
<a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108" id="noteref-108">{1}</a>
The disappointment of Phillip can be easily imagined. He had
impressed upon Lord Sydney <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"
id="noteref-109">{2}</a> and Evan Nepean <a href="#note-110"
name="noteref-110" id="noteref-110">{3}</a> the necessity of
restricting the transportation of convicts for a year or so, to
carpenters, masons, bricklayers, and farmers, who could support
themselves and help to support others. His request was answered
by a shipload of helpless women, many of them "loaded with the
infirmities incident to old age". <a href="#note-111" name=
"noteref-111" id="noteref-111">{4}</a></p>
<p>But although the Lady Juliana was a sore disappointment. the
intelligence she brought of the illness and recovery of King
George III, and the outbreak of the French Revolution, excited
the keenest interest, and caused some of the community at all
events to forget for a time their hardships and their fears. And
while the loss of the Guardian, which the Lady Juliana reported,
was a great calamity, it was some consolation to find that an
attempt had been made to provide for the wants of the colony, and
that but for an unfortunate accident relief would have arrived
early in the year. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112" id=
"noteref-112">{5}</a></p>
<p>If want had not ceased to knock at the door, the hungry people
could yet rejoice at the King's restoration to health. The
officers drew up an address to his Majesty, which was handed to
Phillip for transmission to England, and a day of thanksgiving
was appointed, on which occasion the convicts were excused from
work, and a full ration was issued to everyone in the settlement.
<a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113" id=
"noteref-113">{6}</a></p>
<p>The inordinately long passage of the Lady Juliana was
unfortunate. She brought, it is true, only a small quantity of
provisions, but if she had arrived a few months earlier it would
have been known in the colony that arrangements had been made to
send out relief, and the knowledge would have encouraged and
supported the people in the trials they were undergoing. Why this
ship was delayed so long is not explained in the official
reports, which do little more than record her arrival and
departure. Collins and Tench both note the extraordinary length
of the voyage, but neither gives any reason for it. Collins
certainly tells us that the rapid voyage of the Justinian, which
was made in half the time, was owing to the fact that she
"touched only at St. Jago, avoiding, as she had not any convicts
on board, the circuitous passage by the Rio de Janeiro and the
Cape of Good Hope". This latter route had been taken by the First
Fleet, so that supplies of water, fresh provisions, and live
stock might be obtained on the way. Some of the fleet sailed
badly, and time was lost in keeping the ships together. Yet the
voyage was completed by Phillip in less than eight months. The
Lady Juliana, unembarrassed by a convoy, and not required to
obtain supplies for the colony, was ten months on the voyage. How
time was wasted may be seen from the fact that she remained seven
weeks at Rio and a month at the Cape. It is hardly possible to
avoid the conclusion that the voyage was purposely prolonged. The
loss of time at both places is the more noticeable from the fact,
stated by Collins, that the Government had placed a naval
officer. Lieutenant Thomas Edgar, on board, to see that justice
was done to the convicts, "and to guard against any delays on the
voyage". <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114" id=
"noteref-114">{7}</a></p>
<p>A few weeks after the arrival of the Lady Juliana the
Justinian entered the harbour, with a large cargo of provisions,
and for a time there was plenty in the land. <a href="#note-115"
name="noteref-115" id="noteref-115">{8}</a> She left England in
January, 1790, and had been only five months on the passage.
Tench contrasts the voyage of the Lady Juliana with that of the
Justinian, and shows that the latter went from England to Jamaica
and back, and from England to Australia, in less time than was
occupied by the former in performing the single voyage. <a href=
"#note-116" name="noteref-116" id="noteref-116">{9}</a> He does
not accuse the commander of the Lady Juliana, but, inferentially,
his praise of the management of one ship is a censure upon that
of the other.</p>
<p>In reporting the arrival of the Royal Admiral more than two
years afterwards, Collins makes a pointed allusion to the voyage
of the Lady Juliana. He mentions in his record of events for
October, 1792, that the superintendent of convicts on board that
vessel was "Mr. Richard Alley, who formerly belonged to the Lady
Juliana, transport, in quality of surgeon, in the memorable
voyage of that ship to this colony; a voyage that could never be
thought on by any inhabitant of it without exciting a most
painful sensation." <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117" id=
"noteref-117">{10}</a> Why a remark of this kind should have been
made so long after the arrival of the vessel, instead of at the
time, may be accounted for on the supposition that the "painful"
circumstances of the voyage were not at first known. <a href=
"#note-118" name="noteref-118" id="noteref-118">{11}</a></p>
<p>The nature of the facts which created such a profound
impression upon society at Sydney Cove is left to conjecture; but
a remarkable correspondence between the movements of the Lady
Juliana and those of another transport (the Kitty), which arrived
two years later, suggests a possible solution of the mystery. The
Lady Juliana carried female convicts, and so did the Kitty. The
former vessel was ten months on the passage; the latter eight.
Intentional delay in the case of the Lady Juliana may be
suspected; that the Kitty, which followed the same route, was
purposely delayed is officially stated by the naval agent on
board. Lieutenant Woodriff, <a href="#note-119" name=
"noteref-119" id="noteref-119">{12}</a> who made a formal
complaint on the subject to Governor Phillip. The Kitty called at
Rio de Janeiro, and although the repairs she required might have
been made in a week or ten days, she remained in that port for
five weeks. It was necessary to put into False Bay for the
purpose of stopping a leak, and after leaving that port,
Lieutenant Woodriff, who was instructed to "expedite as much as
possible her then intended voyage", urged the master to make more
sail. For doing this he was "grossly insulted and abused".
Lieutenant Woodriff also reported that the vessel on the voyage
from the Cape to Sydney was brought to in a fair wind, when she
might have been kept on her course. These delays, in his opinion,
were "intended", and accounted for the length of the voyage. He
had done all he could to prevent them, but had been set at
defiance. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120" id=
"noteref-120">{13}</a> The naval agent on board the Lady Juliana,
Lieutenant Edgar, does not appear to have made any complaint
against the master of the Lady Juliana. If he did, it finds no
place in the Records.</p>
<p>A few days after the arrival of the Justinian, three other
transports, the Surprize, the Scarborough, and the Neptune, came
into port. <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121" id=
"noteref-121">{14}</a> The shameful sacrifice of human life that
took place on board these ships during the voyage excited the
greatest indignation both in the colony and in England. The
treatment of the convicts on board these vessels appears to have
been marked by the most callous indifference to suffering and
disregard of human life. The episode forms the blackest chapter
in the history of Australian transportation. The three vessels
(the Neptune, Surprize, and Scarborough) sailed from England with
1,006 male and eighty-nine female convicts. <a href="#note-122"
name="noteref-122" id="noteref-122">{15}</a> By the time they had
arrived at Port Jackson, 267 persons, including eleven women,
had. perished; a large number of those brought into port were in
a dying condition, and of the remainder at least one-half had to
go into the hospitals and tents on shore, where many of them
died, some a few hours, others a few days, after their reception.
On the 17th July, 1790 (about three weeks after the vessels
arrived), Phillip reported to the Home Secretary that fifty had
died since landing. Four hundred and fifty more were on the
sick-list, and of the remainder many had "barely strength to
attend to themselves". <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123" id=
"noteref-123">{16}</a></p>
<p>The cause of the sickness and death on board these vessels is
only too apparent. Not only was there overcrowding, but those in
charge aggravated the evil by keeping the convicts below, where
they were constantly breathing foul air. Only a few were allowed
on deck at a time, and even when this privilege was extended to
them they were so heavily ironed that they could scarcely move.
The fetters with which the limbs of these hapless people were
confined were alleged to have been previously employed in the
African slave trade; <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124" id=
"noteref-124">{17}</a> they were veritable instruments of
torture. These terrible shackles were placed upon the convicts
indiscriminately, and once having been put on they do not appear
to have been removed until the end of the voyage or death
relieved the unhappy wearers from their sufferings. The irons
were kept on even when the prisoners were fainting from illness
and exhaustion; many of them, indeed, died in their fetters. This
was not all. Although the ships were well provisioned, the ration
supplied to the convicts was cut down, so that starvation was
added to the sufferings which these miserable men had to endure.
It was stated that when one of a gang died in his chains his
fellow-prisoners, under the pressure of hunger, concealed the
fact until putrefaction made concealment no longer possible, so
that they might share among them the dead man's allowance. Under
such circumstances it is not surprising that scurvy, dysentery,
and fever raged among the convicts, and that the unfortunate
people died wholesale. Phillip, who would have been justified in
writing more strongly on the point, advised the Secretary of
State, on the 13th July, 1790, to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I will not, sir, dwell on the scene of misery which
the hospitals and sick-tents exhibited when those people were
landed, but it would be a want of duty not to say that it was
occasioned by the contractors having crowded too many on board
those ships, and from their being too much confined during the
passage. . . . I believe, sir, while the masters of the
transports think their own safety depends on admitting few
convicts on deck at a time, and most of them with irons on, which
prevent any kind of exercise, numbers must always perish on so
long a voyage; and many of those now received are in such a
situation from old complaints, and so emaciated from what they
have suffered on the voyage, that they never will be capable of
any labour. . . . By the surgeon's returns of this day there are
488 under medical treatment; when the ships arrived we had not
fifty people sick in the colony." <a href="#note-125" name=
"noteref-125" id="noteref-125">{18}</a></blockquote>
<p>Phillip spoke in general terms from information that had been
supplied to him, but it happens that with regard to the
transactions on board of one of the transports, at least, we have
a trustworthy eye-witness. The ships brought out detachments of
the New South Wales Corps. That on board the Surprize was
commanded by Captain William Hill, who has written a graphic and
touching account of the horrors that came under his observation.
His narrative was sent to the philanthropist, William
Wilberforce. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126" id=
"noteref-126">{19}</a></p>
<p>So deep an impression did the horrors of the voyage make upon
Captain Hill that he declared that he should never recover his
accustomed vivacity and spirits. What made these dreadful scenes
the harder to witness was his inability to interfere. He was in
command of a detachment of troops, but he had no control over the
management of the convicts. They were entirely at the mercy of
the masters of the transports. "Had I been empowered", he wrote,
"it would have been the most grateful task of my life to have
prevented so many of my fellow-creatures so much misery and
death."</p>
<p>The Rev. Richard Johnson, chaplain of the settlement, visited
the Surprize soon after her arrival, and saw for himself the
state of affairs on board. His version <a href="#note-127" name=
"noteref-127" id="noteref-127">{20}</a> of the condition of the
convicts on this vessel bears out all that Captain Hill had
written.</p>
<p>After visiting the Surprize, Mr. Johnson went on board the
Scarborough, but the condition of the convicts was so revolting
that the captain dissuaded him from going below. The Neptune was
so much "more wretched and intolerable" that he did not require
dissuading. After the survivors had been landed, Mr. Johnson
obtained information from the convicts as to the treatment they
had received on board the different vessels. They allege that
"for a considerable time together they had been to the middle in
water, chained together hand and leg, even the sick not
excepted&mdash;nay, many died with their chains upon them."
<a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128" id=
"noteref-128">{21}</a></p>
<p>When the transports returned to England public attention was
directed to this shameful sacrifice of human life. Information
was laid on oath by several of the crew and marines, charging the
master (Donald Trail) and chief mate (William Ellington) of the
Neptune with causing the death of a number of convicts by
curtailing their allowance of food and water. It was also alleged
that when the ship arrived at Sydney they opened a warehouse on
shore, and sold the provisions which the convicts ought to have
had. The substance of the affidavits was published in the
<i>Dublin Chronicle</i> of 1st December, 1791. <a href=
"#note-129" name="noteref-129" id="noteref-129">{22}</a> Trail
and Ellington were subsequently charged with the wilful murder of
two of the crew of the Neptune and one convict, <a href=
"#note-130" name="noteref-130" id="noteref-130">{23}</a> but they
both fled the country before either of the charges came on for
trial, and no farther trace of their movements can now be
found.</p>
<p>Apparently no attempt was made to refute the charges until
some months afterwards. In <i>Woodfall's Register</i> of the 4th
August, 1792, <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131" id=
"noteref-131">{24}</a> the contractors (Messrs. Camden, Calvert,
and King) published a copy of their instructions to the captain
of the Neptune, accompanied by a "Statement of the proceedings of
Donald Trail, master of the Neptune, during his passage to Port
Jackson". <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132" id=
"noteref-132">{25}</a> This statement bears no signature, but
contains internal evidence of having been written by an
eye-witness. It was stated therein that the convicts had been
ironed with the cognisance and under the inspection of the
Government Agent (Lieutenant Shapcote), and that those who were
of good character or sick were exempt. Abundant opportunities, it
was alleged, had been afforded for the convicts to get fresh air
and exercise. In regard to the provisions, the whole
responsibility was cast upon the Government Agent, who attended
in person to the serving of provisions. Three pints of fresh
water, in addition to that required for cooking their food, were
allowed each convict daily. No neglect in serving out the
provisions and water, regularly and to the full amount, had
occurred, except on the passage from the Cape to Sydney, when it
was admitted that it was occasionally prevented by excessively
rough weather. The statement that convicts concealed the deaths
of their comrades to share the dead men's rations was denied: and
it was claimed that had this been the case "convicts in the
adjoining cabins, not receiving any advantage from the dead men's
rations, would certainly have discovered and complained of dead
bodies being kept amongst them." <a href="#note-133" name=
"noteref-133" id="noteref-133">{26}</a></p>
<p>This attempt to defend the captain is somewhat weakened by the
fact that he had not sufficient confidence in it to remain in
England and make it himself. Nor is this all. The Government
Agent, on whose shoulders the entire blame was laid, had, at the
time this defence was published, been dead nearly two years.
<a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134" id="noteref-134">{27}</a>
No attempt whatever was made to account for the enormous loss of
human life. The statement in defence, it must be remembered, was
purely an <i>ex parte</i> one, made by the most interested
parties&mdash;the contractors. It is probable that some of the
assertions of the surviving convicts were exaggerated; but, on
the whole, there is every reason to believe that the statements
of independent parties, particularly Captain Hill and the Rev.
Richard Johnson, are true in the main, and that the treatment of
the convicts, on these vessels&mdash;especially the
Neptune&mdash;was inhuman in the extreme.</p>
<p>As soon as the transports had come to anchor, the work of
disembarkation was hurried forward. Many of the convicts were
unfit to be moved at all; numbers of them expired when they were
brought up on deck, or in the boats which conveyed them to the
shore. No attempt was made to strengthen or restore them. Common
humanity required that they should be given a chance of life, now
that the long and painful voyage was over; but, instead of being
carefully treated and tenderly handled, they were "slung over the
ship's side in the same manner as they would sling a cask, a box,
or anything of that nature." Nor did the barbarity with which
these wretched beings were treated during the voyage and at its
close end with their miserable lives, for, according to Mr.
Johnson, the bodies of a number of men who had died before they
could be taken to land were thrown into the harbour; they
presently drifted on shore, where&mdash;scandalous
spectacle&mdash;they were seen lying "naked upon the rocks". Mr.
Johnson "took an occasion to represent this to his Excellency, in
consequence of which immediate orders were sent on board that
those who died on board should be carried to the opposite north
shore and be buried."</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to find accommodation for five hundred
sick people. There was one hospital buildings but it only had
room for seventy or eighty people; fortunately, however, a
portable hospital had been brought out from England in the
Justinian, and this was erected after a delay of more than a
fortnight. It was said to have been put together in England in a
few hours, <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135" id=
"noteref-135">{28}</a> but it was not ready for occupation until
the 7th July. When erected, it was "filled in a few minutes".
Sydney Cove must at that time have presented a painful spectacle.
Phillip's brief allusion to the "scene of misery" in the
hospitals and sick-tents is all that we have officially in the
way of description. The omission, however, is well supplied by
Mr. Johnson, and there are also the published accounts of Collins
and Tench, who, like the chaplain, were eye-witnesses. From the
accounts given by these officers, we learn that, when landed,
"great numbers were not able to walk, nor to move hand or foot".
The spectacle must have been truly affecting; some of the
strongest were to be seen carrying or leading their helpless
comrades; others "creeped upon their hands and knees".</p>
<p>The difficulty of housing so large a number of sick and
helpless people can be easily imagined: it was increased by the
scarcity of bedding. About one hundred tents, each capable of
accommodating four convicts, were erected; a quantity of grass
was collected for them to lie upon, and one blanket was supplied
to each tent. It must be remembered that this was in July, the
middle of our winter. It was no uncommon occurrence to find in
the morning that the strongest of the four convicts had
appropriated the blanket, and left his unfortunate bedfellows to
shift as best they could. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"
id="noteref-136">{29}</a> An eye-witness <a href="#note-137"
name="noteref-137" id="noteref-137">{30}</a> tells us:&mdash;"The
morning generally opened with the attendants of the sick passing
frequently backwards and forwards from the hospital to the
burying-ground with the miserable victims of the night."</p>
<p>The fact that proper bedding was not famished for the sick
people in the tents may seem to point to want of humanity or want
of system on the part of the authorities at Sydney, but it must
be remembered that nearly five hundred sick men were landed
suddenly in a settlement that was ill-supplied with the
necessaries of life, and that blankets and clothing were very
scarce articles. These wants had been mentioned repeatedly in the
letters sent to England, and a large supply had been put on board
the Guardian. That stock, however, was not available, and it does
not appear that the other storeship, the Justinian, brought
anything for the use of the colony beyond provisions.</p>
<p>Why the convicts on board these ships suffered so severely is
plainly to be seen. In the first place, the British Government
acted upon a wrong principle in making its transportation
arrangements. The contractors were paid so much per head for the
convicts shipped in England, including maintenance on the voyage.
The amount paid over was the same, whether all the prisoners
arrived safely at their destination, or whether half of them had
been thrown overboard in the English Channel. <a href="#note-138"
name="noteref-138" id="noteref-138">{31}</a> The contractors, as
represented by their agents (the masters of the transports), had
therefore no interest in preserving life; on the contrary, every
death was a gain. The greater the mortality the larger the
profit.</p>
<p>The same principle operated with regard to the ration. If it
was cut down, the saving of provisions thus made was so much
money in pocket. Captain Hill had this in view when he wrote so
indignantly to Mr. Wilberforce about "the villany, oppression,
and shameful peculation of the masters of two of the transports."
<a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139" id="noteref-139">{32}</a>
That the enormities committed on these vessels were not
overlooked is shown by a passage in Dundas's despatch, to
Phillip, written on the 10th January, 1792:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The distresses to which the convicts sent out in the
three ships were exposed during their voyage to New South Wales
is a subject into which the strictest enquiry will be made, in
order to the bringing to punishment the persons who have been the
cause of that shocking calamity."</blockquote>
<p>On the same date, Mr. John King, who was acting as Under
Secretary at the Home Office in the absence of Mr. Nepean,
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Several affidavits have been taken since the return
of the Neptune respecting the inhuman treatment said to have been
offered to these people, with a view to the prosecution of the
persons who were the cause of it, and in consequence of which the
master, it is reported, has absconded."</blockquote>
<p>In his despatch of the 15th May, 1792, Dundas told Phillip
that he had "thoroughly investigated" and "taken the necessary
steps to bring forward the conduct of the parties concerned in
the treatment of the convicts on board the Neptune, Surprize, and
Scarborough." Although, as stated on a previous page, nothing
came of these proceedings, it is apparent, at any rate, that the
British Government was aware of the outrage that had been
committed, and recognised its responsibility in the matter. The
responsibility was not a light one. It is true that the
Government had appointed a naval officer. Lieutenant Shapcote, to
take charge of the fleet and look after the convicts. If the
instructions given to this officer had been carried out, the
abases which disgraced the Second Fleet would have been
impossible. He was directed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"To visit the ships as frequently on the passage as
opportunities offer, and see they are wash'd and air'd, and that
the convicts are kept clean, have their cloaths shifted and
washed, and as much air given them as possible, consistent with
their safety; and that the sick are kept seperate, and the place
allotted for them fumigated when necessary; that they are
supplied with wine and other necessaries when required by the
surgeon; and that justice is done to the whole of them on board,
agreeable to contract" <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140" id=
"noteref-140">{33}</a></blockquote>
<p>These instructions indicate a proper concern for the welfare
of the convicts, but unfortunately they were of no effect. One
man could not possibly keep watch over three vessels, which were
liable, from the accidents of wind and weather, to be separated
from each other for many days at a time. This difficulty, which
does not seem to have occurred to the Government, rendered all
precautions nugatory. But whatever protection the naval agent may
have afforded to the prisoners, it was given for only a part of
the voyage, and it was on the passage from the Cape to Sydney,
after the death of Lieutenant Shapcote, that the worst of the
atrocities were committed. When the vessels arrived at the Cape
many deaths had occurred (sixty-nine), and the convicts were
suffering from scurvy. In his report to the Commissioners of the
Navy, dated from the Neptune, in False Bay, 24th April, 1790,
Shapcote says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The soldiers and convicts, to a very large number,
are exceeding ill with the scurvy, and as our stay here will be
short, I have, in consequence of representations from the
surgeon's mate of the troops and the different surgeons of the
ships, ordered the masters to issue to them fresh meat every day,
with a sufficient quantity of vegetables." <a href="#note-141"
name="noteref-141" id="noteref-141">{34}</a></blockquote>
<p>If the troops, who had the advantage of free access to the
decks, and were not cheated out of their allowance of food, were
"exceeding ill with the scurvy", it is easy to understand how
much worse must have been the condition of the convicts, who were
kept in close confinement and deprived of a part of their ration.
It may be presumed that the soldiers received the fresh meat that
was ordered for them at the Cape&mdash;their officers would have
seen to that&mdash;but it is doubtful whether much of that sort
of food, if any, found its way into the mouths of the helpless
convicts.</p>
<p>But so loose was the system of transportation in the early
days that even when a naval agent had the sole charge of a ship
he experienced much difficulty in carrying out his instructions.
The Boddingtons, which was sent from Ireland in 1793, had a most
successful voyage. Only one death occurred from her departure
from Cork to her arrival at Sydney, and the convicts all landed
in good health. <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142" id=
"noteref-142">{35}</a> This result seems to have been entirely
due to the exertions of Surgeon Kent, who was in charge in the
double capacity of superintendent and medical officer. He
received elaborate instructions. He was ordered to "enforce a
compliance with the several stipulations made with the
contractor", and to see that medicines and necessaries were
provided by the contractor, and duly and properly administered
during the voyage. So far as the supplies were concerned there
was no room for complaint. The provisions were good, and
everything contracted for was supplied in a very liberal manner;
but the health of the convicts was not even considered by those
in command of the vessel. Mr. Kent, who kept this important point
steadily in view, received no assistance whatever from the
master, who neglected the orders given, and told Mr. Kent very
plainly that he "only came in the ship to navigate her". Finding
that he could obtain no help in that quarter, Kent "contrived to
get the convicts themselves to preserve order, cleanliness, and
regularity", and he found his reward in "the little trouble there
was with them in the medical department". In his letter to
Nepean, 2nd September, 1793, he made the very pertinent
suggestion that the captains of transports should be bound down
to obey the orders of the naval agent in matters affecting the
health and lives of the convicts. That the surgeon of the
Boddingtons should have been constrained to make such a remark
shows how defective was the system. The instructions given were
sound and well judged, but as they could not be enforced they
were practically useless.</p>
<p>If the atrocities committed on board these vessels failed to
meet with the punishment they deserved, they led, at any rate, to
a radical alteration in the system of transportation. Contracts
were made on a different basis, and a naval officer was placed in
charge of each vessel, with instructions to look after the
welfare of the convicts, and see that they received the
provisions for which the contractors had been paid." <a href=
"#note-143" name="noteref-143" id="noteref-143">{36}</a> More
than that&mdash;a bonus was given to those in charge for
delivering the prisoners in safety at their destination. When the
Surprize made her second voyage she had on board a superintendent
and a surgeon. To these officers, and also to the master of the
vessel, an allowance was made of a guinea each for every convict
landed at Port Jackson, "as an inducement to them to take every
possible care for their preservation". The Governor was informed
of the step that had been taken by the Commissioners of the Navy,
in a despatch dated 5th March, 1794, and he was requested to give
certificates of the number of convicts landed, so that the
officers might claim the reward. <a href="#note-144" name=
"noteref-144" id="noteref-144">{37}</a></p>
<p>This was an improvement on the terms under which the transport
Boddingtons was chartered in the year 1793. The amount to be paid
to the contractor (Mr. William Richards, junior) <a href=
"#note-145" name="noteref-145" id="noteref-145">{38}</a> was to
be &pound;22 per head for each convict. This was &pound;4 2s. 6d.
more per head than the sum paid to the owners of the vessels of
the Second Fleet, but there was an important condition in the
contract. The sum of &pound;5 per head was kept back, and was
only payable on the production of a certificate from the Governor
that so many convicts had been landed; for every convict who died
at sea the contractors lost &pound;5. <a href="#note-146" name=
"noteref-146" id="noteref-146">{39}</a> The effect of these
different measures was that the owners, the masters, and the
surgeons in charge became pecuniarily interested in the welfare
of the convicts. It is scarcely necessary to say that under the
new system the abuses which led to the wholesale destruction of
life on board the vessels of the Second and Third Fleets had no
existence.</p>
<p>The necessity that existed for changing the system was shown
not only by the doings on board the vessels of the Second Fleet,
but by the case of the Queen, transport, which arrived in
October, 1791. In this instance a complaint was made to Phillip,
who caused a magisterial inquiry to be held. The evidence proved
that provisions had been deliberately and fraudulently kept back
from the convicts. <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147" id=
"noteref-147">{40}</a> Phillip did not attempt to inflict any
penalty, but sent a copy of the proceedings to Lord Grenville,
explaining that he adopted this course because he doubted if he
had "the power of inflicting a punishment adequate to the crime".
<a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148" id="noteref-148">{41}</a>
Phillip was highly commended by Dundas (who had succeeded
Grenville) for the action he had taken in this matter, but it
does not appear that the offenders received any punishment for
their misconduct, although Dundas remarked that he would take
care when "the parties concerned return home that justice be
done." <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149" id=

Justinian, transport, commanded by Captain Maitland; and our
rapture was doubled on finding that she was laden entirely with

Collins (vol. i, pp. 122, 123) thus describes the condition of
these people when they arrived at Sydney:&mdash;"The appearance
of those who did not require medical assistance was lean and
emaciated. Several of these miserable people died in the boats as
they were rowing on shore, or on the wharf as they were lifting
out of the boats; both the living and the dead exhibiting more
horrid spectacles than had ever been witnessed in this country.
All this was to be attributed to confinement, and that of the
worst species&mdash;confinement in a small space and in irons,
not put on singly, but many of them chained together. On board
the Scarborough a plan had been formed to take the ship. . . .
This necessarily, <i>on board that ship</i>, occasioned much
future circumspection; but Captain Marshall's humanity
considerably lessened the severity which the insurgents might
naturally have expected. On board the other ships, the masters,
who had the entire direction of the prisoners, never suffered
them to be at large on deck, and but few at a time were permitted
there. This consequently gave birth to many diseases. It was said
that on board the Neptune several had died in irons; and what
added to the horror of such a circumstance was that their deaths
were concealed, for the purpose of sharing their allowance of
provisions, until chance and the offensiveness of a corpse
directed the surgeon, or someone who had authority in the ship,
to the spot where it lay."</p>

<h3>5. DESPATCHES FROM ENGLAND.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>BY</small> the Lady Juliana, Phillip received a
despatch, dated 20th June, 1789, <a href="#note-150" name=
"noteref-150" id="noteref-150">{1}</a> from the Right Hon,
William Wyndham Grenville, <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"
id="noteref-151">{2}</a> in which the despatches sent from Port
Jackson in the previous year were acknowledged. The despatches
written by Phillip in May, July, September, October, and
November, 1788, were sent to England by different transports;
but, as it happened, all the vessels, with the exception of the
Friendship, which was scuttled at sea on the homeward voyage,
arrived at about the same time, <a href="#note-152" name=
"noteref-152" id="noteref-152">{3}</a> and the British Government
was placed in possession, almost at once, of the history of the
settlement from its foundation in January, 1788, to the 16th
November of the same year.</p>
<p>Phillip would have been more than mortal if he had not felt
some disappointment when he read Grenville's despatch. It was the
first communication he had received from the Government since he
left England more than three years before, and it was, at the
same time, a reply to a number of his own letters in which he had
given an account of the voyage and the establishment of the
settlement, a narrative of events that had happened since his
arrival, and a statement of the difficulties he had encountered
in the administration of affairs. He had accomplished a great
task. He had brought a fleet of eleven vessels through a long and
tedious voyage with very little loss of life; he had landed
nearly a thousand men at Sydney Cove without accident of any
kind; he had established settlements at Sydney, Parramatta, and
Norfolk Island; and he might reasonably have expected to receive
such an acknowledgment of these services as would show that they
were properly valued by the British Government. But beyond an
intimation that "his Majesty is graciously pleased to approve of
your conduct in the execution of the arduous and important
service which has been committed to your care", and a word of
approval for the measures which had been taken to promote
morality, there is nothing in the curt business-like
communication sent by Grenville to show that the work which
Phillip had done, and was doing, was appreciated, or even
understood. The brief despatch contained little more than an
announcement that the Guardian was about to be despatched with a
supply of provisions, implements, and a few useful convicts and
superintendents, that a thousand more convicts were to be sent in
the autumn, and that, in the opinion of Grenville, Norfolk Island
was a better place for the chief settlement than Port
Jackson.</p>
<p>But if Phillip felt disappointment at the unsympathetic nature
of the despatch, it was as nothing compared with the discomfiture
he must have experienced when he found that, while some of the
requests preferred in his letters had been attended to, the most
important of his recommendations had been entirely ignored. One
of the strongest points urged in his despatch of 9th July,
written six months after his arrival, and enforced in others, was
this&mdash;that no more convicts should be sent, at any rate not
in considerable numbers, for two years at least. He did not give
this advice, which was a warning as well as a recommendation,
without cause. His reasons were substantial. He knew that the
only way to establish the settlement on a sound basis was to make
it self-supporting; and to accomplish this end it was necessary,
before all things, that the land should be cultivated. But this
all-important work could not be undertaken with any prospect of
success unless there was on the soil a population capable of
subduing it. The principle would have held good in any situation,
but the circumstances of the case gave it peculiar force. Land of
fair quality had been discovered at Parramatta, and although it
was not so much encumbered with timber and scrub as that in the
vicinity of Sydney Cove, yet the labour of clearing it was very
great. Cultivation under such conditions would have proceeded
slowly, even if the men employed had been fit for the work and
willing to perform it. But they were not. Scarcely any of them
had before laboured in the fields, while some were so old and
enfeebled that they were unfit for manual labour of any kind.
Those who were strong enough to work were incorrigibly idle, as
well as ignorant, and needed the most constant and vigilant
supervision. There was only one person in the colony qualified by
previous experience in agriculture to properly direct them,
<a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153" id="noteref-153">{4}</a>
and a great deal of the labour was consequently thrown away. It
would have been simple madness to send out large numbers of
people of this sort in the expectation that they would be able to
till the land and support themselves, and Phillip was not slow to
represent the case to the British Government. Writing to Lord
Sydney on the 9th July, 1788, after pointing out that if
superintendents were not sent out the convicts would be a burden
to the country, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I should hope that few convicts will be sent out
this year or the next, unless they are artificers, and after what
I have had the honour of observing to your Lordship, I make no
doubt but proper people will be sent to superintend them.
<a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154" id="noteref-154">{5}</a>
The ships that bring out convicts should have at least two years'
provisions on board to land with them, for the putting the
convicts on board some ships and the provisions that were to
support them in others, as was done, I beg leave to observe, much
against my intimation [inclination], must have been fatal if the
ships carrying the provisions had been lost." <a href="#note-155"
name="noteref-155" id="noteref-155">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p>In the despatches which he subsequently wrote Phillip pressed
the point. Writing on the 10th July, one day later, he explained
that the people wanted in the colony were "farmers, and people
used to the cultivation of the lands . . . without which
agriculture will make but a very slow progress." <a href=
"#note-156" name="noteref-156" id="noteref-156">{7}</a> A few
sentences further on he said:&mdash;"The sending out settlers,
who will be interested in the labour of the convicts and in the
cultivation of the country, appears to me to be absolutely
necessary." The request that settlers might be sent out was
repeated in his despatches of the 28th September and the 30th
October. On the latter date he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Your Lordship will see by my former letters the
little progress we have been able to make in cultivating the
lands, and I presume the necessity of a few proper persons being
sent out to superintend the convicts, as well as settlers, who
have been used to cultivation." <a href="#note-157" name=
"noteref-157" id="noteref-157">{8}</a></blockquote>
<p>The "little progress" that was made in cultivation maybe seen
from the despatches which were before Grenville when he wrote to
Phillip, telling him to prepare for the reception of a thousand
more convicts. Writing on the 28th September, 1788, Phillip
reported that "the detachment is now inclosing ground for their
gardens, and we have about six acres of wheat, eight of barley,
and six acres of other grain"; <a href="#note-158" name=
"noteref-158" id="noteref-158">{9}</a> and on the 30th October he
stated that he had sixteen acres under cultivation "at a small
farm on the public account". The land that had been cleared was
situated in the neighbourhood of Sydney Cove; operations at Rose
Hill were only about to commence. Altogether, only thirty-six
acres of land were under cultivation, the larger portion of which
was private property. What would become of the seed then in the
ground&mdash;a second sowing&mdash;could not be predicted with
anything like certainty, for the first sowing had almost entirely
failed.</p>
<p>This was the state of the agricultural industry in New South
Wales when Phillip sent off his despatches towards the close of
the first year. It did not augur well for the future of the
settlement. The day when the colony would be self-supporting was
clearly a long way off. Its "sole dependence", as pointed out by
Phillip, was on the supplies sent from England. Settlers who
would make good use of the land were wanted; but instead of these
being sent, shipload after shipload of useless convicts were
despatched.</p>
<p>Although the Home Government was to blame for disregarding the
repeated admonitions of Phillip, it must be borne in mind that
the case was viewed in an entirely different light at Whitehall
and at Sydney. Phillip was face to face with the difficulties of
the position; the authorities in England saw them only from afar,
and did not fully realise them. They were possibly misled by the
tone of the despatches received from Phillip, who, while stating
the facts plainly enough, always wrote hopefully about the future
of the settlement. The authorities at Home seem to have been
possessed with the idea that the colony would be self-supporting
almost from the first, and the conviction was not easily shaken.
Advice and warning, unless they were given in the plainest
language, were thrown away upon them. The main purpose of the
enterprise was another point in regard to which Phillip's views
were at variance with those of the Secretary of State. Although
he knew that the primary object was to relieve Great Britain of
her criminal population, Phillip seems to have had larger ideas
on the subject than the statesmen who directed affairs in London.
It is evident from his despatches that he contemplated the
formation, not of a convict-station, but of a colony.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to find a reason for the action of Sydney
and Grenville in ignoring Phillip's request that transportation
should cease for two years. In 1789, when Phillip's despatches
containing this request reached England, the metropolitan and
county gaols were crowded with convicts. Thirteen years had
elapsed since the cessation of transportation to America, and, of
the enormous number of convicts sentenced to transportation
during that time, a few had been sent to Africa, and some were
confined in hulks upon the river Thames, but the vast majority,
numbering upwards of 100,000, <a href="#note-159" name=
"noteref-159" id="noteref-159">{10}</a> were lying in the county
and metropolitan gaols and bridewells, awaiting the execution of
their sentences. So great was the risk of escape and disease,
through cramping these unfortunate people in the small and
insecure buildings which then served as county gaols, that the
Secretary of State was daily importuned to make some arrangement
for their removal.</p>
<p>Shortly after Grenville took office, the evil had assumed such
proportions that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London brought
the matter under his notice, and pointed out that Newgate Gaol
was so overcrowded with felons, many of whom had long been
awaiting transportation, that their health was suffering, and,
unless something was speedily done, the most fatal consequences
were inevitable. Letters to the same effect from Magistrates in
the country districts poured in upon Grenville; but he had only
one reply. The gaols, he admitted, were "extremely crowded in
every part of England . . . the hulks are all quite filled";
<a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160" id="noteref-160">{11}</a>
but he hoped shortly to be able to despatch a number of the
convicts to the new settlement at Botany Bay. There can be no
doubt that Grenville was aware, when he took this hazardous step,
that it was in direct opposition to Phillip's recommendation; but
he probably thought it better to let the convicts take their
chance of starving in New South Wales in preference to keeping
them huddled together in pestilential dens, where the unwholesome
conditions and meagre fare meant misery, disease, and death.
<a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161" id=
"noteref-161">{12}</a></p>
<p>In the despatch of the 20th June, 1789, <a href="#note-162"
name="noteref-162" id="noteref-162">{13}</a> in which Grenville
informed Phillip that about 240 female convicts had been shipped
on the Lady Juliana, and about 1,000 more of both sexes were
shortly to follow, no allusion whatever was made to the reasons
which had induced the Government to ignore his recommendations.
However mortifying this was to Phillip, it must have been
aggravated by the despatches that followed, impressing upon him
the necessity of discharging the very duty that he had said in
his own letters he was most anxious to perform. <a href=
"#note-163" name="noteref-163" id="noteref-163">{14}</a> Writing
on the 24th August, 1789, Grenville enjoined Phillip to carefully
attend to the provisions sent by the Guardian and Lady Juliana,
and "to use every practicable exertion in order to put the colony
in such a situation as not to depend on Great Britain for its
supply in the article of provisions." He went on to say that a
further supply of provisions would accompany the convicts who
were to be sent by the Neptune, Surprise, and Scarborough, and
added:&mdash;"I cannot help flattering myself that after that
period very little farther aids will be wanted from this country
for the subsistence of the convicts." <a href="#note-164" name=
"noteref-164" id="noteref-164">{15}</a> It is inconceivable how
such an expectation could have been formed, excepting on the
supposition that Phillip's despatches, received several months
before, had not received proper attention. It seems scarcely
possible, indeed, that Grenville could have even read those
passages in Phillip's despatches of the 15th May and 9th July,
1788, in which he pointed out the dependent condition of the
settlement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Your Lordship will, I presume, see the necessity of
a regular supply of provisions for four or five years." <a href=
"#note-165" name="noteref-165" id=
"noteref-165">{16}</a></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<blockquote>"Thus situated, your Lordship will excuse my
observing a second time that a regular supply of provisions from
England will be absolutely necessary for four or five years, as
the crops for two years to come cannot be depended on for more
than what will be necessary for seed, and what [stock] the Sirius
may procure can only be to breed from." <a href="#note-166" name=
"noteref-166" id="noteref-166">{17}</a></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<blockquote>"No country offers less assistance to the first
settlers than this does; nor do I think any country could be more
disadvantageously placed with respect to support from the mother
country, on which for a few years we must entirely depend."
<a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167" id=
"noteref-167">{18}</a></blockquote>
<p>If Phillip had known that a thousand more convicts were to be
sent immediately, and that large batches were to follow, he would
not have ventured to express any opinion as to when the colony
would be self-supporting. Grenville, it is clear, looked at the
matter simply from his own point of view; he made little or no
use of the information at his disposal. Had he done so, he would
never have written that remarkable sentence in his despatch of
the 24th August. <a href="#note-168" name="noteref-168" id=
"noteref-168">{19}</a> When this despatch is read in connection
with one written exactly four months later it becomes even more
incomprehensible. Writing to Phillip on the 24th December,
Grenville, after explaining that for several reasons it was
necessary that all the convicts on the Neptune, Scarborough, and
Surprize, including those intended for Norfolk Island, should be
disembarked at Sydney, he went on to say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The disembarking the convicts at Sydney, exclusive
of the consideration before mentioned, seems indeed to be a
measure highly necessary, as from the length of the passage from
hence, and the nature of their food, there is every reason to
expect that many of them will be reduced to so debilitated a
state that immediate relief will be found to be expedient for the
preservation of their lives." <a href="#note-169" name=
"noteref-169" id="noteref-169">{20}</a></blockquote>
<p>Although the shocking condition in which the convicts of the
Second Fleet actually arrived could not have been foreseen, it is
apparent that sickness was apprehended, and that convicts would
be landed in such a condition that they would be a burden rather
than a help to the colony. And yet the arrival of these ships was
to mark a period beyond which very little further assistance
would be wanted from the mother country.</p>
<p>Phillip's reply to Grenville's first despatch was written on
the 17th June, 1790, <a href="#note-170" name="noteref-170" id=
"noteref-170">{21}</a> a fortnight after it had been received by
the Lady Juliana, and nearly a year after it left England. It
betrays no feeling of annoyance, nor is a word said as to the
probable influence that would be exerted on the future of the
settlement by the arrival in a few weeks of a thousand more
convicts. It would not have been in accordance with the rules
regulating official correspondence for the Governor to question
the wisdom of the course pursued by Ministers in England; but
even if Phillip had felt inclined to say a few words in
deprecation of the step that had been taken, it would have been
useless to do so, for arrangements had been made for the despatch
of the transports, and when Phillip wrote his reply to Grenville
they were expected to arrive every moment. They actually came
into the harbour a week later. But although Phillip did not
remonstrate with his official superiors, he endeavoured to
educate them, by explaining the position of affairs, and pointing
out the difficulties that had been encountered&mdash;difficulties
which made the despatch of large bodies of convicts imprudent to
the last degree. After urging for the fourth or fifth time that
settlers, rather than convicts, should be sent out, men who
possessed some means, as well as a knowledge of farming, Phillip
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As it may appear that we have not made that advance
towards supporting ourselves which may have been expected, I
will, sir, beg leave to observe that in addition to those
untoward circumstances which have thrown the settlement so far
back, <a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171" id=
"noteref-171">{22}</a> it never yet has been possible to direct
the labour of more than a small part of the convicts to the
principal object. A civil and military establishment form a
considerable part of our numbers, which is increased by women and
children, all of whom are undoubtedly necessary, but are a
deadweight on those who have to render the colony independent for
the necessaries of life. Stores, barracks, and houses have
required time, and we have still stores and barracks to build in
the stead of those temporary ones at first erected." <a href=
"#note-172" name="noteref-172" id=
"noteref-172">{23}</a></blockquote>
<p>It does not seem to have occurred to the Minister and the
officials at the Home Office that buildings for the accommodation
of the people had to be erected, and that it would be necessary
to clear the land before even a hut could be built or a field
sown. The convicts were at once to set about tilling the soil,
and the colony was almost immediately to become self-supporting.
In time the illusion was dispelled, but many a despatch had to be
written from Sydney before the situation was realised. Nothing
shows more strikingly the profound ignorance of the Home Office
on the subject than the conditions which were laid down in
Phillip's colony. Additional Instructions respecting the terms on
which convict labour was to be granted to soldiers and settlers.
These Instructions, which were received by Phillip with the
despatch of 24th August, 1789, contained this clause:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"And whereas many of the non-commissioned officers
and men of the marine detachment, or other persons who may become
settlers upon Our said continent <a href="#note-173" name=

<p>This condition might have been complied with by settlers An of
the kind that Phillip wanted&mdash;men with means, who would have
been prepared to spend money for a few years in the hope of
obtaining a return later on. But, unfortunately, no English
settlers of any description had offered themselves. A year or two
later a few settlers were sent out, but they took up land on much
more favourable conditions as to convict labour than those
prescribed in the Instructions. The only persons available as
settlers at the time were men belonging to the marine detachment
stationed in the colony, and it was quite out of their power to
take up land under the conditions laid down. So far from being
able to maintain, feed, and clothe convict servants, they would
not have been able, as settlers, to support themselves. It was
only possible to place settlers upon the soil by giving to each
man provisions from the store for a year or two, and convict
servants, who were to be supplied with food and provisions from
the same source, Phillip settled the question in a few
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"No soldier or other person in this settlement could
at present accept of the assistance of convicts in cultivating
the land which might be granted them on the conditions pointed
out in the Instructions&mdash;'of feeding and cloathing them'. I
believe, sir, that it will be little less than two years from the
time of granting the lands before those lands will support the
cultivators." <a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175" id=
"noteref-175">{26}</a></blockquote>
<p>Phillip had, in fact, anticipated the Royal Instructions, for
he proposed in his despatch of 13th February, 1790, that the
first settlers should be allowed a certain number of convicts for
two years, who were to be supported during that time at the
expense of the Crown. <a href="#note-176" name="noteref-176" id=
"noteref-176">{27}</a></p>
<p>Phillip also felt called upon to reply to that part of
Grenville's despatch in which it was intimated that but for the
expense that had been incurred the Minister would have felt
inclined to recommend that Norfolk Island should be made the
principal settlement. We have here another example of the
indifference displayed by the English authorities. While
Grenville took no notice of Phillip's distinct and oft-repeated
warning against flooding the settlement with convicts, he went
out of his way to express an opinion on a point about which he
could not possibly have the knowledge that the Governor
possessed. He knew that the soil of Norfolk Island was more
fertile than that at Port Jackson, and for this reason,
apparently, concluded that an unfortunate choice had been made.
This opinion was expressed, it is evident, on the spur of the
moment, and without giving attention to facts or paying respect
to Phillip's judgment. The area of Norfolk Island is small, as
could have been ascertained in a moment by reference to the maps
and charts. Even supposing its whole surface to be suitable for
cultivation, it was inadequate for the support of the large
number of convicts that were to be sent out. <a href="#note-177"
name="noteref-177" id="noteref-177">{28}</a> As to other
conditions&mdash;whether it possessed a safe harbour, whether the
climate was favourable, or whether it was suitable for trading
purposes&mdash;the authorities were entirely ignorant. Phillip,
on the other hand, was possessed of all the facts. He knew from
the reports of Lieutenant King that the island, though
exceedingly fertile, was so limited in area that under the most
favourable conditions it was incapable of supporting more than a
handful of people, and that, so far from having a harbour where
ships could lie, there was actually no place at which men or
stores could be landed except in the finest weather. It was a
common occurrence for vessels sent with stores from Port Jackson,
to sight the island and have to stand off and on for several days
before they could get near enough to send boats on shore, and
before it had been occupied a year several accidents occurred,
attended with considerable loss of life. This is the place which
in the opinion of Grenville should have been made the principal
settlement, although he knew that Phillip had taken the fleet
into "the finest harbour in the world", and had before him
territory of unknown extent, but practically unlimited.</p>
<p>Phillip treated the suggestion with respect, but he must have
felt the absurdity of the position. He pointed out that there was
one objection to making Norfolk Island the principal
settlement&mdash;it possessed "no harbour or good roadstead". He
made no reference to its limited area, but contented himself with
setting forth the advantages of Port Jackson, which lies, as he
explained, between two harbours&mdash;Botany Bay and Broken
Bay&mdash;so that "if a ship falls in with coast in bad weather,
a few miles either in the northward or Southward, she can find
immediate shelter." He modestly added, "and I believe it will be
found hereafter that the seat of government has not been
improperly placed." Phillip's choice has been amply
justified.</p>
<p>It is curious to note, however, that if Phillip had not been
so impressed with the necessity of making a speedy choice, the
head-quarters of the settlement might have been established at
Parramatta instead of Sydney. Phillip thus refers to the
question:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I had little time to look round me when I first
arrived, for my Instructions particularly pointed out that I was
not to delay the disembarking the people, with a view of
searching for a better situation than what Botany Bay might
afford. I was obliged to look farther, but I did not think myself
at liberty to continue my research after I had seen Sydney Cove.
Had I seen the country near the head of the harbour I might have
been induced to have made the settlement there, but we knew
nothing of that part of the country until the creek which runs up
to Rose Hill was discovered in a journey I made to the westward
three months after we landed; and although I was then fully
satisfied of the goodness of the soil, and saw the advantages of
that situation, most of our stores and provisions were landed,
and it required some little time to do away with the general
opinion that such a situation could not be healthy, and which I
was inclined to think myself until I had examined the country for
some miles round, and was satisfied that there was a free
circulation of air, in the goodness of which few places equal it"
<a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178" id=
"noteref-178">{29}</a></blockquote>
<p>But even if Phillip had chosen the head of the harbour as the
site for the settlement, the fact would have made little
difference to the future of Sydney. Parramatta would have been
the principal town, but it would not have kept its position. For
a time, indeed, it did enjoy the distinction. When it was
discovered that there was better land in the neighbourhood than
any that could be found near Sydney Cove the bulk of the
population settled there, and Sydney was only second in
importance. In fact, so little was thought of it that Tench,
writing in December, 1791, described it as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"This place (Sydney) had long been considered only as
a dep&ocirc;t for stores. It exhibited nothing but a few old
scattered huts and some sterile gardens. Cultivation of the
ground was abandoned, and all our strength transferred to Rose
Hill." <a href="#note-179" name="noteref-179" id=
"noteref-179">{30}</a></blockquote>
<p>But the growth of the colony caused Parramatta to lose its
pride of place, and the principal port of the colony became also
its chief city.</p>
<p>Phillip had scarcely finished writing his reply to Grenville's
despatch of the 20th June, 1789, when the Justinian arrived with
that of the 24th August, 1789. <a href="#note-180" name=
"noteref-180" id="noteref-180">{31}</a> This was the despatch in
which Phillip was enjoined to be careful in the distribution of
the provisions sent by the Lady Juliana and Guardian, and urged
to use every exertion to make the colony independent of the
mother country for its supply of provisions. These injunctions
show the anxiety of the Government to keep down the expenditure,
and to get rid of the burden of provisioning the colony as
speedily as possible. But they need not have been written.
Phillip had been provident from the first; and the sharp
experience of the last six months had taught him to be more
careful than ever of the stores. As to the exhortation to do his
best to make the colony self-supporting, he might have answered
it by quoting his own despatches, which show that this object had
been in his mind from the first. He had even pointed out the way
in which the goal, according to his judgment, might be most
speedily attained; and, had he chosen to do so, he might have
complained that his advice had been disregarded, And his requests
poorly, and grudgingly, responded to. But he contented himself
with acknowledging the receipt of the instructions, and writing a
brief sentence to record the fact that he had been economical in
the expenditure of stores, and mindful of the object which the
Government had so much at heart. "The strictest economy", he
informed Grenville, "has ever been used, and every exertion has
been made on my part to put the colony in the situation
recommended, of the necessity of which I am fully persuaded."
<a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181" id="noteref-181">{32}</a>
As to the expectation Grenville had formed, that upon the receipt
of the supplies sent by the Guardian and the Lady Juliana very
little further aid from Great Britain would be required, he
referred the Minister to his previous despatches, and declared
that the colony had suffered from so many disadvantages that "it
may rather be a matter of surprise that a regular settlement
exists than that it is not in a more flourishing state." The
wreck of the Guardian destroyed at a blow the fabric which
Grenville had reared in his mind, and Phillip's despatches must
have convinced him that he had been altogether too sanguine in
his expectations.</p>
<p>Even if the Guardian had come safely into port instead of
striking an iceberg, those expectations, founded on the merest
conjecture, could not possibly have been realised. The colony
would not have been "thrown back", to use Phillip's expression,
as was the case, but it would have been still a long way from the
situation in which the British Government desired to see it. This
vessel had proved a disappointment in more ways than one. In his
first set of despatches Phillip had begged that superintendents
might be sent out to overlook the convicts, and instruct them in
the cultivation of the land, and that if convicts were sent they
should be useful men, such as farm labourers and artificers. The
latter request was answered by sending on board the Guardian
twenty-five convicts who were supposed to be artificers. Out of
these, nineteen arrived at Sydney, and they had behaved so well
in the hour of danger that most of them were given their freedom.
<a href="#note-182" name="noteref-182" id="noteref-182">{33}</a>
So far, therefore, as public work was concerned, their services
were lost. How urgent was the need for men of this sort is shown
by the particulars given in Phillip's despatch as to the
available labour at Sydney at this time (June, 1790), when
building and repairs to buildings were much required. The marine
detachment could boast of one carpenter and one smith; there were
on shore from the Sirius two carpenters and one smith; while of
the convicts the trained workmen consisted of six carpenters,
four smiths, two bricklayers, one stonemason, and "four men who
work with the carpenters, brought up as seamen and servants". But
this small strength was less than appeared on paper, for Phillip
says of the carpenters that "of the six we have only three merit
the name."</p>
<p>It was much the same with the superintendents sent by the
Guardian. They were nine in number, and the list of names and
occupations, which was appended to Grenville's despatch, looked
very well. <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183" id=
"noteref-183">{34}</a> But when Phillip wrote, only five instead
of nine had arrived, of whom he reported that but one was a
farmer. Two said that "they were used to the farming business
when they were seventeen and nineteen years of age", but, Phillip
added, "they cannot from the knowledge they then obtained be able
to instruct the convicts or direct a farm." It is evident,
therefore, that the superintendents were badly chosen. There
could have been no misunderstanding as to the sort of men
required, for Grenville, in his despatch of the 24th August, says
that the superintendents were sent in consequence of Phillip's
"representation of the want of proper persons to instruct the
convicts in the manner of tilling the land and to superintend
their labour." <a href="#note-184" name="noteref-184" id=
"noteref-184">{35}</a> The Minister can scarcely be held
personally responsible for the unhappy selection that was made,
but it is plainly to be seen that there was blundering or neglect
somewhere.</p>

As early as March, 1785, Edmund Burke called the attention of the
House of Commons to the "melancholy situation under which those
unfortunate people laboured who were sentenced to
transportation." Their numbers, he declared, were at that time
estimated at not less than 100,000. They had been accumulating
for the previous ten years. "He wished to know what was to be
done with these unhappy wretches." Apparently, the Government did
not know themselves&mdash;the only satisfaction Burke obtained
was an assurance that they would not be sent to Gambia, which he
alluded to as the "capital seat of plague, pestilence, and
famine. The gates of hell were there open day and night to
receive the victims of the law."&mdash;Parliamentary History,

"Convicts", remarked the famous philanthropist and prison
reformer, John Howard, "are generally stout robust young men who
have been accustomed to free diet, tolerable lodgings, and
vigorous exercise. These are ironed and thrust into close
offensive dungeons, and there chained down, some of them without
straw or other bedding, in which they continue, in winter,
sixteen or seventeen hours out of the twenty-four in utter
inactivity, and immersed in the noxious effluvia of their own
bodies. . . . Their food is at the same time low and scanty; they
are generally without firing, and the powers of life soon become
incapable of resisting so many causes of sickness and
despair."&mdash;State of the Prisons in England and Wales, 4th
ed., p. 467. The same writer narrates that on a visit to Morpeth
Gaol in 1776 he saw in an "offensive dungeon, the window only 18
inches by 9, . . . three transports, who, upon suspicion of
intending an escape, were chained to the floor.&mdash;Ib., p.
425. In Durham county gaol he saw "six prisoners, most of them
transports, chained to the floor. In that situation they had been
for many weeks, and were very sickly. Their straw on the stone
floor was almost worn to dust."&mdash;Ib., p. 420.</p>

It would appear from this paragraph that the great mortality on
the transports of the Second Fleet was partly due to close
confinement in England prior to embarkation. Howard, referring to
the emaciated condition of some of the convicts when placed on
board transports, mentioned as worthy of imitation a practice
then in vogue in Portugal, of enrolling as soldiers all prisoners
about to be transported to Brazil, and sending them to a
sanitorium to bathe and be better clothed and fed, that they may
be properly prepared for their long voyage. The adoption of a
similar system in England would have prevented an enormous amount
of suffering.&mdash;State of the Prisons, 4th edition, p. 150 and

<h3>6. THE NEW SOUTH WALES CORPS.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>EXACTLY</small> a month before Grenville wrote his
despatch of the 20th June, 1789, the first official step had been
taken to create a special military force which was to replace the
detachment of marines then doing service in the colony. On the
20th May, Sir George Yonge, Secretary at War, addressed a letter
to the Treasury, intimating that it had been determined to raise
a corps of infantry for service in New South Wales, and directing
that it should be immediately placed upon the establishment.
<a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185" id="noteref-185">{1}</a>
It was to number in the aggregate three hundred rank and file,
and to be "commanded by a major having a company". Early in June,
Major Grose received instructions to raise the force, and after
some correspondence as to terms the instructions were carried
out. It was afterwards decided, in consequence, it may be
presumed, of letters from Phillip, in which he stated that a
force of five hundred men would be required for the protection of
the settlement, to increase the strength of the Corps.</p>
<p>Although the Corps was specially raised for service in New
South Wales, where it remained until its action in the Bligh
episode led to its recall, and was described in the despatches as
the New South Wales Corps, that title was not always applied to
it. It was sometimes called the New South Wales Regiment, while
some of the English newspapers of the time chose to call it the
"Botany Bay Rangers", and others the "New South Wales Rangers".
Its status in the Army was precisely the same as though it had
been formed for general instead of special service. This point
seems to have been raised while the Corps was in course of
formation, for in August, 1789, the Secretary at War considered
it necessary to explain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"With regard to the rank of Major Grose's corps, it
being the youngest in the Army must, of course, when drawn up,
either with other entire corps or with detachments from them,
take part on the left. But with regard to the officers in all
corps, without distinction, the militia excepted, they naturally
take part in all duties according to seniority in their
respective ranks." <a href="#note-186" name="noteref-186" id=

<p>As the New South Wales Corps played a prominent part in the
early history of the colony, and exerted a potent influence on
its affairs, the conditions under which it was formed and
maintained are worthy of more than ordinary attention. The force
was raised after the manner in vogue in those days. A "letter of
service" was given to an officer, usually a colonel, authorising
him to enlist a certain number of men, and fixing the bounty
allowed for each recruit at so much per head. If the officer
employed in this service could procure men at a smaller bounty
than the sum allowed in the letter of service, the extra money
went into his own pocket&mdash;it was his profit or reward for
the services rendered in raising the regiment. <a href=
"#note-187" name="noteref-187" id="noteref-187">{3}</a> There was
another system in practice so late as the Crimean War, known as
"raising men for rank", by which regiments were raised by
noblemen or gentlemen, who received as compensation for their
trouble and expense the right to nominate the officers. <a href=
"#note-188" name="noteref-188" id="noteref-188">{4}</a> In
Grose's case both methods seem to have been employed: he received
the bounty money, and was also allowed to nominate some of the
officers. The Corps, in the first instance, consisted of four
companies, each company of one captain, one lieutenant, one
ensign, three sergeants, three corporals, two drummers, and
sixty-seven privates. In the letter of service sent by the
Secretary at War (Sir George Yonge) to Major Grose, on the 8th
June, 1789, he was informed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Yourself and the three captains now to be appointed
by his Majesty will each be required to raise a complete company
(viz., three sergeants, three corporals, two drummers, and
sixty-seven private men), in aid of the expenses of which you
will be allowed to name the lieutenant and ensign of your
respective companies, and to receive from the public three
guineas for every recruit approved at the head-quarters of the
corps by a general or field officer appointed for that purpose."
<a href="#note-189" name="noteref-189" id=
"noteref-189">{5}</a></blockquote>
<p>The bounty offered to recruits varied according to
circumstances. The normal amount was forty shillings. It was so
in Shakespeare's time, and the same bounty was commonly paid in
the Eighteenth Century; but in time of war, when it was necessary
to obtain considerable numbers of men as rapidly as possible,
very much larger bounties had to be paid. <a href="#note-190"
name="noteref-190" id="noteref-190">{6}</a> When Grose received
his instructions to raise the New South Wales Corps, England was
at peace with the world, and it was not necessary to tempt men by
offering very large bounties. It is probable, therefore, that out
of the three guineas per head allowed by the War Office, Grose
received a fair sum as a recompense for his services in raising
the force. The plan was a convenient one for the War Office. By
paying a fixed sum for each recruit, and giving the officer the
right to nominate the subalterns, the cost of raising the force
could be estimated to a penny, and all trouble avoided. The
Government supplied the money, and Major Grose found the men. The
arrangement was simplicity itself, but it was open to abuse. The
practice does not now exist in the British army.</p>
<p>Grose was also allowed the privilege, whatever it may have
been worth, of nominating the Adjutant, Quarter-master, and
Chaplain. It may be remarked here, that the detachment of marines
sent out with the First Fleet had no Chaplain. It was only a
detachment, not a regiment, and the desirableness of appointing
someone to look after the spiritual welfare of the soldiers does
not seem to have been recognised by the authorities. The
circumstances under which the Rev. Richard Johnson was appointed
Chaplain of the settlement have already been alluded to. <a href=
"#note-191" name="noteref-191" id="noteref-191">{7}</a> In
sending out the New South Wales Corps, the appointment of a
Chaplain was a feature in the arrangements. In a letter of the
8th June, 1789, the Secretary at War informed Major Grose that
the Chaplain "must positively engage to embark with the Corps,
and remain with it while abroad", and, he added, that
certificates of character must be furnished before the
appointment was proposed to the King. <a href="#note-192" name=
"noteref-192" id="noteref-192">{8}</a></p>
<p>The Corps, three hundred strong, was raised and ready for
inspection in September, but the propriety of increasing the
number was soon under consideration. Writing on the 8th October
to the Under Secretary for Home Affairs, Major Grose stated that
he had heard of the proposed augmentation of the force, and
intimated that he was "ready to raise either one or any number of
companies without a shilling expense to the Government, if
allowed to nominate the officers." No action was taken at the
time, but on the 23rd of February, 1791, instructions were given
to Grose to raise two additional companies. One of them, he was
informed in a letter from Sir George Yonge, was to be commanded
by a second major, who was to obtain his appointment on condition
of contributing five hundred pounds to the expense of the levy.
The nomination of the rest of officers was left to Grose,
according to the original condition. Grose thought he saw here a
way to promotion, With the addition proposed, the Corps would
consist of six companies; and if further increases took place, of
which there was every probability, the Corps would before long
become equal in point of numbers to a regiment of the line. Even
with a strength of six companies, it should be commanded, Grose
thought, by a colonel, or, at the very least, a
lieutenant-colonel. Accordingly, he renewed his proposal to the
War Office in this form:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Should I be promoted to the rank of lt.-colonel, I
will without expence to Government raise both the companies,
reserving to myself the nomination of the captain and subaltern
officers. Should it be thought expedient to add only a major to
the Corps without permitting me to succeed to any additional rank
[<i>I will raise the companies on conditions of receiving the
levy money, nominating the captain and subaltern officers, and
receiving from the captain appointed to a majority five hundred
pounds.</i>]" <a href="#note-193" name="noteref-193" id=
"noteref-193">{9}</a></blockquote>

<b>3. Facsimile of Major Grose's Handwriting</b></p>
<br>
<p>Grose's suggestions were not adopted. The two companies were
raised on the conditions laid down by the War Office, and
although Grose was given a Commission as Lieutenant-Governor of
New South Wales, he did not obtain, until some time afterwards,
the coveted step in military rank, which he would, no doubt, have
valued far more highly. On the 31st March, Grose reported to the
Secretary at War that the men had been enlisted, and were ready
for inspection. The Corps was subsequently still further
augmented, and early in 1792 an auxiliary company, consisting of
men from the marines, who had taken their discharge in preference
to returning with the detachment to England to be discharged
there, was raised by Phillip, and placed under the command of
Captain-Lieutenant Johnston. <a href="#note-194" name=
"noteref-194" id="noteref-194">{10}</a> When at its maximum
strength the Corps consisted of ten companies, numbering eight
hundred and eighty-six non-commissioned officers and
privates.</p>
<p>The New South Wales Corps has been held up to reproach by more
than one writer. Allowing that its <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> was
open to criticism, there is no reason to suppose that it was
worse than that of other regiments raised in England at about the
same time. Grose, who had been recruiting for two years before he
was instructed to raise a special force for service in New South
Wales, and was, therefore, well-informed concerning the
composition of the Army, did not regard the Corps as below the
standard; on the contrary, his account of the men places them
above the average. Writing from Portsmouth to the Secretary at
War, on the 30th July, 1790, he reported that since he had taken
command the men had conducted themselves with the greatest
propriety, and had given "constant satisfaction" to everyone
concerned. This remark occurs towards the close of a letter in
which he asked that two incorrigibles might be turned over to the
Navy. <a href="#note-195" name="noteref-195" id=
"noteref-195">{11}</a> These men, he explained, did not belong to
those he had received from the Savoy; <a href="#note-196" name=
"noteref-196" id="noteref-196">{12}</a> they had been enlisted as
ordinary recruits. A few months later, when a detachment of the
Corps was on board the Gorgon, two soldiers from the Savoy got
drunk and caused a disturbance, which was made much of by the
commander of the vessel, Captain Harvey, who reported to the
Admiralty that the men had mutinied. Grose wrote to the Secretary
at War declaring that a "drunken irregularity, "which ended in
the two soldiers being put in irons, had been magnified into a
mutiny, from motives of personal pique; and from the fact that
Captain Harvey, although he was a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of
Sir Joseph Banks, was almost immediately afterwards superseded by
Captain Parker, it would seem that Grose's view of the matter was
accepted by the authorities. <a href="#note-197" name=

<b>4. Facsimiles of Autographs of Officers of the New South Wales
Corps.</b></p>
<br>
<p>As to the principal officers of the Corps, who were taken from
different regiments in the Army, it does not appear that they
were selected with the idea that the service was one for inferior
men. Major Grose, the Commandant, was a man of good standing in
the Army, and his connections were at least respectable. His
father was an antiquary of note, <a href="#note-198" name=
"noteref-198" id="noteref-198">{14}</a> whose work in the branch
of literature to which he devoted himself brought him
considerable fame. Major Grose had a long and honorable career in
the British army. According to a statement of services prepared
by himself, he received a Commission as ensign in the 52nd
Regiment in January, 1775, and soon afterwards was fighting in
the American War of Independence. He was at the Battle of
Bunker's Hill, and was afterwards twice wounded&mdash;once at the
storming of Fort Montgomery, and once at Monmouth court-house. He
had to leave America because of his wounds, and was employed as
captain in recruiting for two years in England. It was owing to
the experience gained in this work, no doubt, that he obtained
the privilege of raising the New South Wales Corps. Six years
before he undertook this duty he had been promoted to the rank of
major in the 96th Regiment, and while serving in New South Wales
he received further promotion as lieutenant-colonel. In 1795 he
was obliged to return to England in consequence of his wounds
breaking out, and was subsequently placed upon the staff,
becoming colonel in 1798, and major-general in 1805. The
statement, to which Grose's name is appended, covers nearly
thirty-five years of military service. That Grose enjoyed the
confidence of the British Government is shown by the fact that he
was not only placed in command of the Corps, but honoured with a
Commission making him Lieutenant-Governor of the colony, in which
position it fell to him to administer its affairs for two years.
It is evident also that he was personally known to the Home
Office officials, for in writing to the Under Secretary soon
after his arrival in Sydney he addressed him as "My dear
friend".</p>
<p>The senior captain, Nicholas Nepean, was the brother of Evan
Nepean, the Under Secretary of the Home Office. The first record
we have of his services is his appointment to the post of second
lieutenant in the 58th Company of the Plymouth Division of the
Royal Marines. The date is 10th December, 1776. In this capacity
he served under Admiral Keppel in the engagement off Brest, 27th
July, 1778. Promoted to the rank of first lieutenant of the 120th
Company, on 22nd December, 1778, he served in various divisions
of the Marines until 22nd October, 1789, when he embarked for New
South Wales as senior captain of the New South Wales Corps. He
returned to England in the Britannia on sick leave, sailing from
Sydney on 8th September, 1798. Although he did not return to the
colony, he continued on the establishment of the New South Wales
Corps until 1st September, 1795; when he joined the 93rd Foot as
lieutenant-colonel. He was subsequently raised to the rank of
brigadier-general on the staff of Great Britain, and in March,
1807, was appointed to the command at Cape Breton.</p>
<p>Of Captain William Hill less is known. Up to June, 1789, when
he joined the New South Wales Corps as captain, next in rank to
Nicholas Nepean, he held the post of a half-pay lieutenant in the
86th Foot. It is evident, however, from an account <a href=
"#note-199" name="noteref-199" id="noteref-199">{15}</a> sent by
him to William Wilberforce, that he had the confidence of the
great philanthropist, and was a man of character and ability.
<a href="#note-200" name="noteref-200" id=
"noteref-200">{16}</a></p>
<p>Captain William Paterson had, prior to accepting a Commission
in the Corps, established a reputation as an African traveller.
He published an account of his travels in the year 1789. <a href=
"#note-201" name="noteref-201" id="noteref-201">{17}</a> The
first record of his services in the Army Lists and Regimental
Succession Books is his appointment as ensign in the 98th Foot,
date 7th October, 1781; he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant
on the 4th July, 1783; captain on the 5th June, 1789; major on
4th November, 1795; and lieutenant-colonel on the 19th January,
1798.</p>
<p>The lieutenants&mdash;Macarthur, Foveaux, Townson, and
Abbott&mdash;all held Commissions in various branches of the
British army prior to joining Grose's force.</p>
<p>Macarthur settled in the colony after the recall of the Corps,
and became one of the most remarkable figures in our history.
Foveaux, prior to the departure of the Corps, attained the rank
of major, and was entrusted with the Lieutenant-Governorship of
Norfolk Island. He continued in the service after his return to
England, and was raised in 1830 to the rank of
lieutenant-general. He died in London in 1846, at the advanced
age of eighty-six.</p>
<p>That Grose himself had a high opinion of the Corps as a whole,
and was resolved to maintain its credit as far as possible, may
be gathered from his action in the case of Ensign Duberly. While
a portion of the Corps was at Portsmouth this officer was guilty
of "repeated neglects and misconduct", and Grose was obliged to
place him under arrest. He would readily have released the
offender, he explained in a letter to Sir George Yonge, if an
acknowledgment of error had been made; but the young officer
obstinately refused to apologise or "make the slightest
concession", preferring rather to be tried by Court-martial.
Grose therefore asked that a General Court-martial might be
assembled, but two days later he wrote another letter to the
Secretary of War, informing him that Duberly had made "much
concession", and that, therefore, he wished to withdraw the
application. He was desirous, he said, of giving Mr. Duberly
another chance, and added:&mdash;"I am the more anxious to avoid
(if possible) his being brought to a Court-martial from an idea
that, exclusive of this young man's destruction, it will be
rather an unpleasant and disgraceful thing to the Corps."
<a href="#note-202" name="noteref-202" id="noteref-202">{18}</a>
In this matter, as well as in others, Grose displayed not only
kindness of heart, but a regard for the honour of the force. In
his opinion, the New South Wales Corps had a reputation to
lose.</p>

<br>

<br>
<p>An example of the practice that prevailed of drawing soldiers
from the criminal classes may be found in a proposal made to
Governor Hunter by the Military Department of Bengal, in a letter
dated the 11th January, 1796, in which it was pointed out that,
owing to the war with France, there was little probability of
obtaining from England much-needed recruits for the Indian army,
and it was suggested that "a number of stout young men" might be
obtained from the convicts whose time of servitude had
expired.</p>
<p>It was not anticipated by the Indian authorities that any
objection would be raised to the scheme, and it was carried so
far that an agreement was made with Captain Raven, of the
storeship Britannia, then at Calcutta, to return with two hundred
recruits, for whom he was to receive &pound;12 for each man
landed at Bengal; and two officers, a lieutenant and a surgeon,
were sent over to superintend the recruiting. Hunter refused to
incur the responsibility of sanctioning the scheme. Although the
expiree was regarded as a free man, it was the established policy
of the Government to raise every obstacle which would prevent him
leaving the colony; and Hunter, recognising that many of them
would eagerly seize this opportunity, referred the matter to the
Secretary of State, and, in doing so, pointed out that, while it
might be desirable&mdash;when the number of expirees
increased&mdash;to dispose in this way of the most turbulent of
them, under the then existing circumstances it would be unwise to
deprive the colony of any considerable number of labourers. His
action was approved, and he was directed to signify to the Bengal
authorities that permission to recruit the Indian army in the
manner proposed could not be granted, as "it was conceived that
the inconveniences of such a plan would more than counterbalance
its advantages."</p>
<p>But what tended more to the demoralisation of the Corps than
the levies made from the Savoy or other English prisons was the
practice which obtained in Grose's time of filling up vacancies
by enlisting convicts who had served their time, and emancipating
others to serve as soldiers. The question as to whether this was
a proper way to maintain the strength of the garrison had been
raised before Grose's arrival in the colony. In his despatch of
5th March, 1791, Phillip informed Grenville that three or four
convicts had offered themselves as soldiers. He said nothing for
or against the practice, but asked for instructions, remarking
that although there had been "no very great impropriety in the
conduct of any of those who say the time is expired for which
they were sentenced, it is more than probable that they will
become troublesome as their numbers increase." <a href=
"#note-203" name="noteref-203" id="noteref-203">{19}</a> This may
have been intended as a hint that it would be advisable to put
some of the convicts under the restraints of military discipline;
but Phillip did not venture to make any recommendation. No
objection, however, was raised to the enlistment of ex-convicts
on the part of the British authorities, and Grose made a practice
of recruiting the Corps from this source. In August, 1798, thirty
men were enrolled from the convict class. They had been selected
because they were men of good character, and had formerly served
in the Army. <a href="#note-204" name="noteref-204" id=
"noteref-204">{20}</a> While he was administering the government
Grose went further, and emancipated convicts who had a part of
their time to serve, on condition that they enlisted for life. In
October, 1793, twenty-three convicts were so emancipated, of whom
seven had been transported for life, and three for fourteen
years. <a href="#note-205" name="noteref-205" id=
"noteref-205">{21}</a> Whether Grose acted on his own
responsibility or sought approval from head-quarters before
recruiting the Corps in this manner does not appear, but the
practice at a later date received the official sanction of the
British Government. The War Office having in the early part of
1797 decided to raise the strength of the Corps to ten companies,
a despatch (22nd February, 1797) was sent to Governor Hunter,
instructing him to consult with Major Paterson, the Commandant,
as to the best means of carrying the Order into
effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"You will, in addition to such individuals as shall
be willing to enlist, and who are not otherwise employed or
engaged in the public service of the settlement, emancipate such
convicts as are willing to enlist, and whose good conduct since
their arrival shall best entitle them to such an
indulgence."</blockquote>
<p>These instructions could not have been much relished by
Hunter. He had previously, when complaining of the conduct of the
soldiers, made some strong remarks on the constitution of the
Corps, and now he was directed to employ the convict population
of the colony in the same service. Much, however, was left to his
discretion. Only men of good conduct were to be enlisted, and
amongst the convicts were many who had been transported for
trivial offences, and were not unfit for military service or
other honest employment. But putting the matter in the most
favourable light, this method of strengthening the Corps was open
to serious objection. If it was necessary to recruit from the
criminal class, it would have been better to go to the Savoy than
to enlist convicts on the spot.</p>
<p>The objections to the practice are obvious. It is not to be
supposed that because the convicts left one servitude for another
they broke off all intercourse with their friends. Nothing was
more improbable. Men of that kind were more likely to sympathise
with the convicts than with the military, and their introduction
into the Corps was a source of embarrassment, if not of
danger.</p>
<p>It was intended in the first instance to send out the four
companies with Major Grose by the end of the year 1789. Writing
to Phillip on the 24th December of that year, Grenville informed
him that a detachment, consisting of about one hundred officers
and men, had been put on board the Surprize, Scarborough, and
Neptune, and that the remainder, consisting of upwards of two
hundred more, under the command of Major Grose, would embark at
Portsmouth, on board his Majesty's ship Gorgon, in the course of
a few days. The first part of the plan was carried out, but not
the second.</p>
<p>The Neptune, Surprize, and Scarborough sailed on the 17th
January, 1790. According to a statement dated the 21st December,
1789 <a href="#note-206" name="noteref-206" id=
"noteref-206">{22}</a> (apparently an enclosure to Grenville's
despatch of the 24th idem <a href="#note-207" name="noteref-207"
id="noteref-207">{23}</a>), the detachment of the Corps embarked
on these vessels was distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>On the Neptune: Captain Nepean, Lieutenant Macarthur,
and forty-three non-commissioned officers and privates.
<p>On the Surprize: Captain Hill, Ensign Prentice, Mr. Harris
(Surgeon's Mate), and twenty-eight non-commissioned officers and
privates.</p>
<p>On the Scarborough: Lieutenants Abbott and Townson, and
thirty-two non-commissioned officers and privates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all, seven officers and one hundred and three
non-commissioned officers and men. The names of the officers on
each ship are not given in the official papers; but they are
mentioned by Mrs. Macarthur in her journal. <a href="#note-208"
name="noteref-208" id="noteref-208">{24}</a></p>
<p>Beyond the narrative sent by Captain Hill to Mr. Wilberforce,
<a href="#note-209" name="noteref-209" id="noteref-209">{25}</a>
and the journal kept by Mrs. Macarthur, <a href="#note-210" name=
"noteref-210" id="noteref-210">{26}</a> nothing descriptive of
the voyage is known to have been preserved. Captain Hill's letter
is valuable as the testimony of an eye-witness to the
ill-treatment the convicts received on board the transports; and
although Mrs. Macarthur's journal is taken up chiefly with
matters personal to herself and her husband, it is of interest as
bearing on the conduct of the men who had charge of the convict
vessels in those days.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Macarthur underwent many trials on board the
Neptune. Trouble began before the fleet left England. While the
Neptune was at Plymouth, Macarthur had a dispute with Captain
Gilbert, the master of the vessel, and fought a duel with him on
shore. <a href="#note-211" name="noteref-211" id=
"noteref-211">{27}</a></p>
<p>Captain Nepean, who was in charge of the detachment on board,
sent an account of the affair to his brother the Under Secretary,
and Captain Gilbert was superseded by Captain Trail. So far as
the Macarthurs were concerned, the change was for the worse. They
were subjected to serious annoyances, which are fully described
in Mrs. Macarthur's journal, and no redress could be obtained
from either Captain Trail or Captain Nepean. Affairs on board the
Neptune came to a climax one day, when Macarthur, having brought
his superior officer on deck to hear a complaint against Captain
Trail, was reprimanded, instead of receiving the support he
looked for. Upon this Macarthur applied for permission to
exchange to the Scarborough, and as no opposition was offered he
completed the voyage in that vessel. The master of the
Scarborough, Captain Marshall, is very highly spoken of by Mrs.
Macarthur; but the voyage was one of suffering for her and of
danger to her husband, for after leaving the Cape he was seized
with the fever which was raging in the ship, and for several days
his life was despaired of. Macarthur and Nepean had unfortunately
quarrelled before they left England. Mrs. Macarthur was,
apparently, unaware of the fact when she wrote her journal, for
she not only made no allusion to it therein, but writing from
Sydney in March, 1791, she remarks, "we shall be pleased to
remove anywhere with Captain Nepean; he is a truly good-hearted
man, and has, I believe, a great friendship for Mr. Macarthur";
<a href="#note-212" name="noteref-212" id="noteref-212">{28}</a>
but if the quarrel had been patched up it had not been forgotten,
and probably rankled in the minds of both men. The dispute was
afterwards revived, and was carried so far that Nepean, after his
arrival in Sydney, endeavoured to bring Macarthur to a
Court-martial for conduct alleged to have taken place "a
considerable time before he left Europe". <a href="#note-213"
name="noteref-213" id="noteref-213">{29}</a> As there would have
been great, if not insuperable, difficulty in holding a General
Court-martial, Sir George Yonge, the Secretary of War, wrote to
Phillip in July, 1792, for a report, with the object of having
the case settled by the War Office; but while correspondence was
proceeding, the matter, through the friendly interposition of
Grose, was arranged. <a href="#note-214" name="noteref-214" id=
"noteref-214">{30}</a></p>
<p>The Neptune, Scarborough, and Surprize arrived, as already
stated, towards the end of June, 1790. They bore despatches from
the Secretary of State informing Phillip that Major Grose, who
had been appointed Lieutenant-Governor, was about to follow with
the rest of the Corps, and that on his arrival Major Ross and the
marine detachment, with the exception of those who wished to
remain in the colony, were to embark as soon as possible for
England. <a href="#note-215" name="noteref-215" id=
"noteref-215">{31}</a></p>
<p>Instead of coming out at the time proposed, Grose remained in
England until July, 1791, when he took his passage in the Pitt,
arriving in Sydney on the 14th February, 1792, In November, 1790,
he represented to Nepean the poor character of the
"accommodations" allotted to himself and his brother-officers on
board the Gorgon, the vessel in which it was at first intended he
should sail with the remainder of the Corps. <a href="#note-216"
name="noteref-216" id="noteref-216">{32}</a> He complained that
every comfortable situation in the ship was occupied by the naval
officers, "who profess a positive resolution of messing by
themselves", and he asked that arrangements might be made so that
if the officers of the Corps were to live by themselves an
"eligible" place for their mess might be allotted to them. Grose
was the more anxious to have better accommodation because he was
accompanied by his wife and family. The difficulty was removed by
abandoning the original intention of sending all the remaining
officers and men out in one vessel. In view of the fact that it
was intended to send out about two thousand more convicts, it was
deemed expedient to detain the troops and distribute them as
guards on the convict ships. The change of plan was announced in
a letter from Grenville to Phillip, 19th February,
1791:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It has been judged expedient that the detachment of
the New South Wales Corps originally intended to accompany Major
Grose in the Gorgon should assist in guarding the convicts
mentioned in my letter to you, No. 9 [16th November, 1790],
<a href="#note-217" name="noteref-217" id="noteref-217">{33}</a>
which have since been increased by clearing the gaols in Ireland
to about 2,050, all of whom will, I expect, be embarked on board
the several transports mentioned in the enclosed list, <a href=
"#note-218" name="noteref-218" id="noteref-218">{34}</a> and will
proceed on their voyage in the course of the present month."
<a href="#note-219" name="noteref-219" id=
"noteref-219">{35}</a></blockquote>
<p>The force distributed among the ten vessels is not stated, but
a comparison of the official returns of July, 1790, and December,
1791, <a href="#note-220" name="noteref-220" id=
"noteref-220">{36}</a> shows that on the latter date the strength
of the Corps then present in the colony had been increased from
one hundred and three to two hundred and seventy-three, including
seventy-six stationed at Norfolk Island. The transports must
therefore have brought out about one hundred and seventy of all
ranks, including Captain Paterson and several of the subalterns.
The rest of the officers remained in England with Major Grose
until the Pitt sailed. This vessel took on board one company of
the Corps, commanded by Captain Hill. The sixth company came out
afterwards in detachments as guards for the convict ships.</p>
<p>The voyage of the Pitt was marked by misfortune. After leaving
St. Jago, <a href="#note-221" name="noteref-221" id=
"noteref-221">{37}</a> where the vessel put in for refreshments,
the troops were attacked by a malignant fever, which carried off
a large number. The commander. Captain Manning, in a letter to
Alderman Macaulay, the head of the firm from which the transport
was hired, describes the misfortune in forcible
language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"For a considerable time our scene was truly
melancholy. In fourteen days we buried twenty-seven seamen,
soldiers, their wives and children. Scarcely a person escaped
death who was watering on shore at that d&mdash;&mdash; place,
St. Jago." <a href="#note-222" name="noteref-222" id=
"noteref-222">{38}</a></blockquote>
<p>From a return sent by Grose to the Admiralty, from Rio de
Janeiro, it appears that thirteen soldiers were carried off by
the fever. He attributed the outbreak to the defective
arrangements on board. Captain Manning, on the other hand,
regarded it as due to climatic causes, the time of the year at
which the island was visited being notoriously unhealthy; this
theory is upheld by the fact that while the soldiers and sailors,
who had liberty on shore, suffered severely, the convicts, who
were confined to the ships, escaped the fever altogether. Grose
lost on the voyage about one-sixth of the detachment; and on the
26th March, a month after his arrival, the total strength of the
Corps at Sydney, Parramatta, and Norfolk Island was returned at
three hundred and forty, rank and file.</p>
<p>When Grose arrived at Sydney, in February, 1792, the Corps
consisted of six companies, one of which, however, remained in
England. <a href="#note-223" name="noteref-223" id=
"noteref-223">{39}</a> Its strength was shortly afterwards
increased by the formation of one extra or auxiliary company,
enlisted by Phillip from the marines who elected to remain in the
colony as soldiers. <a href="#note-224" name="noteref-224" id=
"noteref-224">{40}</a> The command of this company was given to
Captain-Lieutenant Johnston, the only officer of the marines
(with the exception of Collins) who did not return to England at
the expiration of the three years' term of service. The question
having arisen as to whether Johnston's seniority was to date from
his appointment to this company, Phillip communicated with the
War Office, and was informed in a letter from Sir George Yonge,
dated 4th July, 1793, that, "as Captain Johnston only obtained
that rank in the marines on the 25th September, 1792, his
Commission as captain of a company in the New South Wales Corps
cannot be dated earlier than that day." The auxiliary company was
placed on the establishment on the 25th of June, 1793, and thus
became part and parcel of the New South Wales Corps. This brought
the strength of the Corps up to about five hundred officers and
men, but as the convict population increased, further
augmentations became necessary. For a time the Government adopted
the expedient of taking men from regiments on service in England
and sending them as guards of transports to Sydney, where they
were added to the New South Wales Corps. But this plan was not
approved of at the War Office, and in February, 1794, the
Secretary of War wrote to the Home Office, <a href="#note-225"
name="noteref-225" id="noteref-225">{41}</a> stating that there
were no men belonging to Major Grose's corps left at Chatham, and
that he did not suppose the Government would approve of his
ordering any recruits of other corps to be sent to New South
Wales "against their inclination". In May, 1795, a guard being
required for the Lord Cornwallis, transport. Major-General Fox
received instructions from the War Office to transfer to Major
Grose's corps such a number of "Volunteers" from the recruits
under his command as would be sufficient to make up a detachment
of twenty-five men, each volunteer to receive an extra bounty of
a guinea and a half. Two commissioned officers, appointed by the
Duke of York, who commanded the forces at that time, were to go
with the detachment.</p>
<p>This step, however, was only taken to meet an emergency. On
the 10th June, 1796, the War Office authorised Grose, who had
returned to England, but was still in command of the Corps with
the rank of Lieutenant-colonel, to raise two fresh companies,
which were to be "of the same establishment as the other
companies of the Corps". The nomination of the officers was left
to Grose, but it was stipulated that the officers recommended for
companies should have served two years as subalterns, and that
"the gentlemen named for ensigns" should not be under sixteen
years of age. Recruits for the Army were now at war price,
<a href="#note-226" name="noteref-226" id="noteref-226">{42}</a>
and instead of three guineas (the bounty given when the first
detachment of the Corps was raised), Major Grose was now allowed
"seven pounds ten shillings for each recruit".</p>
<p>The two companies were raised in due course, and in less than
a year afterwards, February, 1797, the War Office proposed to
raise an additional company. This increase, according to a
statement annexed to a letter sent from the War Office to the
Paymaster-General, would have raised the number of companies to
ten, with a total strength of nine hundred and forty-eight. But
for some reason not stated, the instructions, less than a month
afterwards, were countermanded. In December, 1802, the force
numbered five hundred and twenty-four non-commissioned officers
and men. In 1805 the strength was increased to six hundred and
fifty-six. In 1807 two fresh companies were added to the Corps,
bringing up the nominal strength to eleven companies of eight
hundred and sixty-six non-commissioned officers and privates.</p>
<p>On the 26th January, 1808, Major Johnston, who then had the
command, placed Governor Bligh under arrest, and assumed the
Government. As soon as the fact became known to the authorities
in England it was decided to recall the Corps, and instructions
were given for the 73rd Regiment, then stationed in Scotland, to
take its place. Upon its recall the name of the force was changed
from the "New South Wales Corps" to the "102nd Regiment". The
change of name was made on the suggestion of the Duke of York,
Commander-in-Chief, in a letter to Lord Castlereagh, dated 20th
October, 1808. Castlereagh suggested that it would he better to
establish it as a second battalion "to some of the regiments
already numbered"; but this was not done, and on the 4th March,
1809, the Mustermaster-General of the British army was notified
by the War Office that the title of the Corps had been changed to
the 102nd Regiment. <a href="#note-227" name="noteref-227" id=
"noteref-227">{43}</a> In December, 1809, Lieutenant-Colonel
Macquarie, who had been appointed to the Governorship, arrived at
Sydney, in command of a battalion of the 73rd Regiment, seven
hundred strong, which relieved the New South Wales Corps. But
while instructions were given to Macquarie to take care that
every officer belonging to the Corps, including Colonel Paterson
and Lieutenant-Colonel Foveaux (who were not in the colony when
the Government was subverted), "do proceed to England with, the
regiment", <a href="#note-228" name="noteref-228" id=
"noteref-228">{44}</a> he was expected to make up the full
strength of his regiment by voluntary enlistment from the force
which had been recalled. He had no difficulty in getting
volunteers. On the 30th April, 1810, he wrote to Lord
Castlereagh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have much pleasure in informing your Lordship that
a sufficient number of volunteers have turned out from the 102nd
to complete the 73rd Regiment within nineteen men of the full
establishment of 1,000 rank and file.<br>
<br>
"A great number of old soldiers of the 102nd who had served long
in this country wished to remain in it . . . . . . . . . . . I
have taken the responsibility upon myself of forming them into an
invalid or veteran company for the service of the colony until
his Majesty's pleasure shall be known. . . I have made the
establishment of this invalid company one hundred rank and file,
with the usual proportion of sergeants and drummers, to be under
the command and charge of an officer of the 73rd Regiment, until
I shall receive orders from Home respecting it."</blockquote>
<p>The augmentation of the 73rd Regiment from the New South Wales
Corps did not stop here. The strength of the Corps had been
raised in 1807 to eight hundred and sixty-six non-commissioned
officers and privates, but only three hundred and forty-five
non-commissioned officers and men went home with the regiment.
Upwards of five hundred men have therefore to be accounted for,
and it would seem that most of them joined the 73rd Regiment.
Writing to Lord Liverpool on the 9th November, 1812, Macquarie
pointed out that he had not sufficient barrack accommodation for
the garrison, increased as it had been by drafts from the 102nd
Regiment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"At the present time the 73rd consists of 1,128 men,
independent of their women and children, and the Veteran Company,
106 men, with their proportion of women and children. Total,
1,234 soldiers."</blockquote>
<p>As the strength of the battalion brought out by Macquarie was
"about seven hundred", it follows that upwards of five hundred
men were added after its arrival, which is as nearly as possible
the number left behind from the New South Wales Corps.</p>
<p>The New South Wales Corps was thus split in two. One part
returned to England as the 102nd Regiment; the other remained in
New South Wales, and became part and parcel of the 73rd
Regiment.</p>
<p>From 1807 to 1811 the 102nd Regiment appears on the pay-lists
as a regiment of ten companies; in 1812 and 1813 it numbered
eleven companies, but was afterwards reduced to ten. From 1812 to
1817 the regiment was engaged partly on foreign service and
partly on service in Ireland. A portion of the regiment was
despatched to the Bermudas in July, 1812, and in June, 1814, took
part in an expedition against Moose Island, in America, which
capitulated on the 11th July. In February, 1816, the 102nd, by
direction of the Prince Regent, became the 100th Regiment.
Towards the close of 1817 the companies which had been doing duty
abroad returned to England; those which were on service in
Ireland were recalled, arriving early in March, 1818, at Chatham,
where, on the 24th March, 1818, the regiment was disbanded.</p>
<p>The Veteran Company enjoyed a life of twenty-one years. It was
formed on the 10th March, 1810, and as long as the 73rd Regiment
remained in the colony was linked with that regiment as an
invalid company. In the lists for March, 1814, it is described as
the "New South Wales Veteran Company", and from that date to
September, 1823, it was linked with the 46th Foot and 48th Foot,
the regiments which followed the 73rd in the performance of
garrison duty in New South Wales.<br>

"With regard to the amount of bounty, it is curious to notice the
long continuance of 40s. as the same given by the Crown to the
recruit on enlistment. In 1597, when Shakespeare wrote the first
part of Henry IV, he puts it into Falstaff's mouth to say that he
had (misused the King's Press, and) 'got in exchange of 150
soldiers three hundred and odd pounds.' Upon the increase of the
Army to meet the Rebellion of 1715, the inducement held out was
40s. 'for every man who shall list himself in any of the
regiments of foot'. In later years the same sum will be found
mentioned in the Statute Book; and it was not until after Mr.
Burke's Act [passed in 1783] had been in operation for some
years, and the cost of recruiting had been transferred to the
public, that the amount of bounty was raised to the excessive
prices that in recent wars were demanded for military
service."&mdash;Clode, Military Forces of the Crown, vol. ii, pp.

A military prison. It was a part of the old Savoy Palace, built
br Simon de Montfort in 1245, and demolished in 1381 by the
followers of Wat Tyler. It was rebuilt and dedicated as a
hospital by Henry VIII in 1509. In the early part of the last
century parts of it served "as two marshalseas for keeping
prisoners&mdash;as deserters, men pressed for military service,
Dutch recruits, &amp;c." Prints of the Savoy in 1793 and 1798 are
still in existence showing the hospital and prison. At the foot
of one is a statement that "this part of the Savoy is now
occupied by the Army as a place of confinement for their
deserters and transports."&mdash;Thornbury's Old and New London,
vol. iii, pp. 95-300 The buildings were palled down in 1819 to
form the western approach of Waterloo Bridge. In Farquhar's play,
"The Recruiting Officer", one of the characters declared that as
an inducement to enlist, the recruiting-sergeant "promised to
advance me; and indeed he did so&mdash;to a garret in the Savoy.
I asked him why he put me in prison; he called me a lying dog,
and said I was in garrison."&mdash;Act iii, sc. i. For

In Chalmers's Biographical Dictionary, Grose's father, Francis
Grose, is described as "an eminent English antiquary". He was
born in 1731, and was the author of numerous books, including The
Antiquities of England and Wales; The Antiquities of Scotland,
and The Antiquities of Ireland. He had some bent for the military
profession, for in early life he entered the Surrey militia,
becoming adjutant and paymaster. He died in Dublin on the 6th
May, 1791 , two months before his son's departure for Sydney.</p>

A Narrative of Four Journeys into the Country of the Hottentot
and Caffraria, in the years 1777-8-9. Illustrated with a map and
seventeen copper-plates, by Lieut. William Paterson. London,
1789. The volume was dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks, and contains
abundant evidence of Paterson's botanical knowledge and of his
powers of observation. In the Appendix a paragraph occurs from
which it is evident that during the period which intervened
between the date of his travels in Africa and his sailing for New
South Wales, be had seen active service with the British troops
in the southern provinces of India. According to Collins,
Paterson was the only, naturalist in the country. He
says:&mdash;"About this time [March, 1795], the spirit of inquiry
being on foot, Mr. Cummings, an officer of the Corps, made an
excursion to the southward of Botany Bay, and brought back with
him some of the head-bones of a marine animal, which, on
inspection, Captain Paterson, the only naturalist in the country,
pronounced to have belonged to the animal described by M. de
Buffon, and named by him the Manatee."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p.

Accounts of the affair got into the London newspapers. The
<i>Morning Post</i>, of 2nd December, 1789, gives the following
version:&mdash;"Saturday, in consequence of a private dispute on
board the Neptune, Captain Gilbert, the commander of that ship,
attended by his second, Mr. Nelson, of Plymouth. Dock, met by
appointment Lieutenant Macarthur, of the Botany Bay Rangers, with
his second, the surgeon's mate of the Neptune, at the old Gun
Wharf, near the Lines. The distance of ten paces being measured,
both gentlemen fired their pistols together; Lieutenant
Macarthur's ball passed through Captain Gilbert's coat. They then
fired a second pistol each, without effect, when the seconds
interposed, and the business was settled by Lieutenant Macarthur
declaring Captain Gilbert's conduct was in every respect that of
a gentleman and a man of honour. In the evening Lieutenant
Macarthur declared the same on the quarter-deck of the Neptune,
to the satisfaction of all parties. It is said the quarrel
originated on a refusal of Captain Gilbert to admit Lieutenant
Macarthur into his own private mess; at the same time he offered
him every accommodation for himself and his family the ship would
allow. This brought on some dispute, which occasioned very high
words, but we are happy the duel ended without bloodshed."</p>

The company which remained in England was sent out at various
periods as guards on convict ships, and merged as they arrived
into the six companies located in the colony. In this way,

<h3>7. THE DISPOSAL OF CROWN LANDS UNDER PHILLIP.
<small>[1789]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>PHILLIP'S</small> sentiments in regard to the
alienation of Crown lands were worthy of the man who did not
doubt "that this country will prove the most valuable acquisition
Great Britain ever made." <a href="#note-229" name="noteref-229"
id="noteref-229">{1}</a> Prior to the departure of the First
Fleet from England, and before his General Instructions were
drawn up, he had impressed upon the Government the desirability
of furnishing specific directions respecting land grants to
seamen and marines. It is evident he was anxious to put free men,
and not convicts, in possession of the soil. His chief anxiety in
regard to the latter was that they should be kept apart from the
rest of the community.</p>
<p>"As I would not wish convicts to lay the foundations of an
empire, I think they should ever remain separated from the
garrison and other settlers that may come from Europe, and not be
allowed to mix with them, even after the seven or fourteen years
for which they are transported may be expired." <a href=
"#note-230" name="noteref-230" id="noteref-230">{2}</a></p>
<p>When he received his General Instructions, Phillip discovered
that the views of the authorities on this point were
diametrically opposed to his own. The only class to which he was
empowered to issue land grants was the emancipated convicts, to
whom he was directed to allot areas as follows:&mdash;To single
men, 30 acres; to married men, 50 acres, and an additional 10
acres for each child, with provisions, in each case, for twelve
months, and tools, seed, and stock from the public store. So far
as seamen, marines, and other free men were concerned, Grenville
was content that they should wait until Phillip had examined the
country and reported upon its capabilities, and upon the terms
and conditions on which he thought the land ought to be
distributed.</p>
<p>In compliance with these instructions, Phillip reported in
July, 1788, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Lands granted to officers or settlers will, I
presume, be on condition of a certain proportion of the lands so
granted being cultivated or cleared within a certain time, and
which time and quantity can only be determined by the nature of
the ground and situation of the lands. . . . . . they [the
officers and settlers] likewise must be allowed convicts, who
must be maintained at the expense of the Crown.<br>
<br>
"Your Lordship will be pleased to consider this opinion as given
in obedience to orders, on a subject which requires more
consideration than I can give it at present, and at a time when I
have only a very superficial knowledge of the country for a few
miles around." <a href="#note-231" name="noteref-231" id=
"noteref-231">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>This despatch reached England in March, 1789; and in June
following, Grenville wrote, in reply, that the matter would be
submitted to his Majesty by an early opportunity. By one of the
vessels of the Second Fleet, which arrived at Sydney in June,
1790, Phillip received Instructions under the Royal Sign-Manual
with respect to grants of land to be made to non-commissioned
officers and privates who might prefer to remain in the colony
when the detachment was relieved, and to "such other persons as
may be disposed to become settlers". The document is known as
Phillip's "Additional Instructions". It was evidently drawn up
with one single object in view, namely, to induce the
non-commissioned officers and men of the marine corps to settle
in the colony, when their three years of service were ended.</p>
<p>Phillip, accordingly, was directed to issue grants to all
soldiers, who were willing to remain, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>To married men.&mdash;Non-commissioned officers, 150
acres; privates, 100 acres; and, in each case, 10 additional
acres for every child.<br>
<br>
To single men.&mdash;Non-commissioned officers, 130 acres;
privates, 80 acres.</blockquote>
<p>He was to allow them from the public store, clothes,
provisions, seed-grain, tools, and implements, sufficient for one
year, free of charge; and assign to them the services of any
number of the convicts&mdash;"you may judge sufficient to answer
their purpose"&mdash;on condition of the grantee maintaining them
in a satisfactory manner. If the marines preferred to enlist in
the relieving corps, they were to receive a bounty of &pound;3
per man, and, at the end of five years' service, double the
quantity of land. <a href="#note-232" name="noteref-232" id=
"noteref-232">{4}</a></p>
<p>The free settlers, about whom Phillip was so anxious, were
practically shut out. If any of them found their way to the
colony, he was instructed to give them every encouragement
"without subjecting the public to expense". Grants of land could
be given to them; but they must not exceed the area allowed to
non-commissioned officers. The services of convicts were, if
required, to be assigned to them; but neither for themselves, nor
for the convicts so assigned, were they to be allowed clothing or
provisions, seeds or tools, from the public store. No inducement
whatever was held out to them; and Phillip saw at once that
unless this was done it was hopeless to expect that the colony
would be anything more than a penal settlement for many
years.</p>
<p>This must have been a severe disappointment to him. Upon no
point had he been so emphatic in his despatches to Whitehall as
upon the necessity for placing free settlers upon the soil; he
had, from the first, been convinced that the prosperity of the
settlement depended upon it, and the conviction was confirmed by
experience. By the transports which returned to England after
landing the first convicts and stores, he informed Lord
Sydney:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"If fifty farmers were sent out with their families
they would do more in one year in rendering this colony
independent of the mother country <i>as to provisions</i> than a
thousand convicts." <a href="#note-233" name="noteref-233" id=
"noteref-233">{5}</a><br>
<br>
"The sending out settlers who will be interested in the labour of
the convicts and in the cultivation of the country appears to me
to be absolutely necessary." <a href="#note-234" name=
"noteref-234" id="noteref-234">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p>In the despatches of February, 1790, carried by Lieutenant P.
G. King, he reported:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"If settlers are sent out, and the convicts divided
amongst them, this settlement will very shortly maintain, itself,
but without which this country cannot be cultivated to any
advantage." <a href="#note-235" name="noteref-235" id=
"noteref-235">{7}</a></blockquote>
<p>In replying to Grenville's despatch which covered his
Additional Instructions concerning the issue of land grants,
Phillip contented himself with remarking:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>. . . . . I have had the honor of observing in my
former despatches that settlers appear to me absolutely
necessary." <a href="#note-236" name="noteref-236" id=
"noteref-236">{8}</a></blockquote>
<p>In March, 1791, he returned to the subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"After three years' experience, I am not only fully
persuaded that the sending out settlers, amongst whom the
greatest part of the convicts should be distributed, and
supported by Government for a certain time on some such plan as
proposed in my former letters, is necessary; but I am persuaded
that a large body of convicts on the account of Government will
not answer any good purpose until the country can support
itself." <a href="#note-237" name="noteref-237" id=
"noteref-237">{9}</a></blockquote>
<p>No notice having been taken of his representations, Phillip
wrote to Nepean in November, 1791, in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"My former letters have pointed out the great
necessity of a few intelligent, good settlers, who would have an
interest in their own labour, and in the labour of those who
might be employed under them; but to which I have not received
any answer. . . The colony is now in such a situation that a few
honest settlers who have been bred to agriculture, being sent
out, may, in a very short time, be the means of taking off the
heavy expense which Government has hitherto been at for supplying
this colony with provisions." <a href="#note-238" name=
"noteref-238" id="noteref-238">{10}</a></blockquote>
<p>To Dundas, in March following, he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have, sir, in all my letters pointed out the great
advantages which would attend our having a few intelligent
farmers as settlers. They would do more for the colony than five
hundred settlers from soldiers or convicts." <a href="#note-239"
name="noteref-239" id="noteref-239">{11}</a></blockquote>
<p>It will be seen from these extracts, culled from Phillip's
despatches during the first four years of the life of the
settlement, what importance he placed upon the introduction of
agricultural immigrants; and what little heed was taken of his
oft-repeated requests and warnings.</p>
<p>The persistent manner in which the Imperial authorities
ignored Phillip's recommendations in this, as in other matters,
forces us to the conclusion that the management of Colonial
affairs at Whitehall&mdash;so far at least as New South Wales was
concerned&mdash;was delegated to subordinates. <a href=
"#note-240" name="noteref-240" id="noteref-240">{12}</a></p>
<p>Shortly after Phillip's first despatches reached England,
Grenville took charge of the Colonial Office; but, like his
predecessor, he appears to have failed to appreciate the
significance of the undertaking. Neither in his voluminous
miscellaneous correspondence <a href="#note-241" name=
"noteref-241" id="noteref-241">{13}</a> nor in his Parliamentary
utterances can any allusion to the colony be found. The
despatches and instructions to Phillip, which emanated from the
Colonial Office while he was in power, contain no indications of
the administrative ability with which his contemporaries credited
him. In the heat of party strife and the pressure of the domestic
affairs of the Empire (which formed the chief business of his
Department), Grenville appears to have lost sight of the infant
colony, or to have regarded it merely as a convenient solution of
the problem presented by the overcrowded gaols. "The penal
colonies", wrote one of the leading authorities on the
administration of Colonial affairs, "were regarded as mere
conveniences for the execution of justice at Home, and excited no
farther interest in the minds of statesmen." <a href="#note-242"
name="noteref-242" id="noteref-242">{14}</a> If any further proof
be needed of the failure of the leading statesmen of the time to
realise the significance of Phillip's mission, it can be found in
the fact that Henry (afterwards Lord) Brougham, in a
comprehensive treatise on the "Colonial Policy of European
Powers", published in 1803, while he devoted considerable space
to small insular settlements in the West Indies, made no allusion
whatever to New South Wales, which had then been an occupied part
of the British Dominions for fifteen years.</p>
<p>In acknowledging the receipt of Grenville's despatch covering
the Royal Instructions concerning land grants, Phillip wrote that
he would obey the directions he had received, but he was
compelled not very long afterwards to tell the Secretary of State
that they would have to be carried out according to the spirit
rather than the letter. In March, 1791, he gave grants to some
marines and sailors who had returned to Sydney from Norfolk
Island, where they had cleared land with the view of settling
upon it. It would have been impossible, he explained, for these
men to maintain themselves at the expiration of twelve months,
and he undertook on his own responsibility to give them eighteen
months' provisions, to build huts for them, and clear half an
acre of land for each. These cases were treated as exceptions at
the time, and Phillip informed the Secretary of State that he
should not deviate from the Additional Instructions in future.
Eight months later, however, he wrote to say that he had been
compelled by the force of circumstances to again depart from the
Instructions. To what extent he did so is shown by an enclosure
that accompanied the despatch. <a href="#note-243" name=
"noteref-243" id="noteref-243">{15}</a> Settlers were to be
supported with provisions and clothing from the public store for
eighteen months instead of twelve, and to receive the necessary
implements of husbandly and live stock and seed. Huts were to be
built for them, a portion of the land cleared; and in one case
four convicts&mdash;supported from the public store&mdash;were
allowed for eighteen months. The propriety of making this
departure from the Instructions was not questioned by the
authorities in London, who had satisfied themselves, according to
Dundas's despatch of the 10th January, 1792, that an allowance of
one year's provisions was insufficient. <a href="#note-244" name=
"noteref-244" id="noteref-244">{16}</a></p>
<p>In regard to land grants to settlers from the convict class, a
great distinction was drawn between the emancipist and the
expiree. In the case of the former the Governor was allowed no
discretion. If he emancipated a convict he was bound by his
General Instructions to give him a grant of land, tools, seeds,
&amp;c., and to provision him for twelve months from the public
store. In the case of the convict whose term of servitude had
expired a grant of land could be made, and even tools and
provisions allowed for "a limited time"; but the concession was
an act of grace, dependent on the good behaviour of the convict,
or on the likelihood of his returning to England unless
sufficient inducement is held out to detain him in the
colony.</p>
<p>There was a remarkable omission in Phillip's Instructions
concerning land grants. While provision was made for the
non-commissioned officers and men of the marine force, nothing
was said about grants to the commissioned officers. Phillip, on
his own responsibility, had given them small plots of land which
they were encouraged to cultivate with the aid of convict labour,
and such live stock as could be spared; but the land was only
held on sufferance, the occupiers had no ownership in it, and
when they left the colony they could neither sell it nor the
improvements they had made upon it; when their occupation ceased,
their interest in the land ceased also.</p>
<p>In his first despatches Phillip mentioned that the officers
felt this to be a hardship; but nothing was done to remedy it,
and when the officers of the New South Wales Corps arrived to
relieve the marines they were much chagrined to find that they
were no better off in this particular than their predecessors.
They had joined the Corps with the knowledge that free grants of
land would be made to settlers, and in the expectation that they
would be allowed to participate in the good things to be
distributed. Phillip was well aware of this, as is shown by his
despatch to Dundas of the 4th October, 1792. "The officers in the
New South Wales Corps, he wrote, "have supposed on coming to this
country that lands might be granted to them, with indulgences
similar to those which have been granted to settlers." Some of
them, there cannot be the least doubt, joined the Corps chiefly
because of the special advantages which belonged to life in a new
settlement, where land was to be given away. Such appears to have
been the case with Lieutenant John Macarthur, who exchanged from
the 68th Foot into the New South Wales Corps, and came out to the
colony with his wife, to whom he had not long been married. The
voyage to a distant uncivilised country, and the separation from
relatives, friends, and associations which the new appointment
involved, would have discouraged and alarmed many women; but Mrs.
Macarthur, so far from opposing the plan, was, to use her own
words, "a warm advocate for it". In a letter to her mother,
written from Chatham Barracks shortly before the first detachment
of the Corps sailed for Sydney, she refers to her husband's
exchange into "the Corps destined for New South Wales, from which
we have very reasonable expectation of reaping the most material
advantages."</p>
<p>The feeling that prevailed among the military officers when it
was found that no provision had been made for them in the
allotment of land finds expression in the letter which Captain
Hill, of the New South Wales Corps, wrote to Wilberforce,
describing the iniquities practised on board the vessels of the
Second Fleet. Having finished his account of the voyage, Hill
gave his impressions of the colony, which were anything but
favourable. Coming to the land question, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In America the officers and settlers had grants of
land in proportion to their rank; but those of the marines who
are now here, and have borne every hardship, have no such thing,
neither is there an intention of giving each their portion. In my
humble opinion nothing can be more impolitic. Industry is the
first essential to the welfare of any kingdom, consequently all
measures that are adopted to promote it are highly commendable;
and I am well persuaded Britain will not thank our Governor for
acting, not only on a mean but on an unstable plan, to the great
disquiet of every individual in the colony, and the certainty of
bringing an endless burthen on the mother country." <a href=
"#note-245" name="noteref-245" id=
"noteref-245">{17}</a></blockquote>
<p>Ostensibly, this is Hill's personal opinion, written for the
information of the great philanthropist, but there can be little
doubt that it also represented the views of the marine officers,
who had been denied their "portion" of land. It is not easy to
see why the blame should have been cast upon the Governor. The
marine officers must have known what the Instructions were, even
if they had not been publicly exhibited, for one of their number,
Judge-Advocate Collins, quotes them in his book. Captain Hill and
the other officers ought to have been aware, from their military
experience, that when a servant of the Crown receives written
instructions, whether they are based upon a mean or a liberal
policy, no course is open to him but to obey them. Phillip was
not responsible for the policy that had been decided upon by the
British Government; his function was to carry it into effect
according to his instructions. Evidently, however, he was
credited with a desire to keep from the marine officers what was
regarded as a right. It may have been thought that he was taking
this means of showing his disapproval of the obstructive conduct
which some of them had pursued. If so, the suspicion was
unfounded. The provisions as to land grants contained in the
Additional Instructions were not made on Phillip's
recommendation; he knew nothing about the conditions until he
received the Additional Instructions, with orders for his "exact
compliance" therewith.</p>
<p>The object the British Government had in view in framing the
Additional Instructions was to promote the settlement of the
land. Whether any of the non-commissioned officers and men would
like to remain in the colony when the three years' term of
service had expired was not known to the Government at the time,
but there was every reason to suppose that the officers, or the
majority of them, intended to return to England as soon as they
were relieved; and as grants of land were not offered as rewards,
but with the object of inducing persons to settle in the colony,
the circumstance that grants to officers were not provided for in
the Additional Instructions should excite no surprise. The
Government did not act on mere supposition. In October, 1788, the
commanding officer, Major Ross, transmitted to the Admiralty
replies from the marine officers, who had been requested to state
whether they desired to return at the end of the three years for
which they had engaged, or remain in the colony. Out of the
eleven officers belonging to the detachment, six intimated their
wish to return at the end of the three years' term, or as soon
afterwards as might be convenient, and the other five sent in
answers which showed little disposition on their part to remain
in the colony as settlers. <a href="#note-246" name="noteref-246"
id="noteref-246">{18}</a> That the Government was not averse to
officers settling in the colony is evident from the fact that
when a request was made for grants of land for them it was
readily complied with. On the 24th November, 1791, rather more
than a year after the Additional Instructions had reached him,
Phillip wrote to the Secretary of State informing him that
several of the officers had applied to him for land grants, and
asking for instructions.</p>
<p>At this time the position had undergone some change. Most of
the officers of the marine detachment had made arrangements to
return to England by the Gorgon, which sailed a month afterwards.
Those referred to by Phillip must therefore have consisted
chiefly of officers of the New South Wales Corps, who were
intended to be stationed permanently in the colony, and
consequently enjoyed advantages in the matter of land occupation
which the marines, whose period of service was three years, did
not. In dealing with the officers' request the British Government
adhered to the principle laid down from the first&mdash;that land
was to be parted with only for the purposes of settlement.
Phillip's letter was addressed to Lord Grenville; it was replied
to on the 14th July, 1792, by his successor, the Right Hon. Henry
Dundas:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In answer to the request made by several of the
military and civil officers to have grants of land made them,
which they may dispose of at their departure, I do not foresee
that any inconvenience can arise from your complying with their
requisitions, provided the allotments are made not with a view to
a temporary but an established settlement thereon; that is,
comprehending such portions of land, and in such situations as
would be suitable for a <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> settler, should it
ever come into the hands of such a person." <a href="#note-247"
name="noteref-247" id="noteref-247">{19}</a></blockquote>
<p>This reply to the request for land on the part of the civil
and military officers, which did not reach the colony until
Phillip had left it, may be taken as an indication that the
marine officers would have been included in the Additional
Instructions if it had been supposed that any of them desired to
remain in the colony as settlers. It will be seen later on how
far this power of granting lands to officers was exercised, and
to what extent the settlement of the colony was affected
thereby.</p>
<p>Two points in which the scheme was defective may be referred
to now. While the area of land which a non-commissioned officer
could take up was limited, the directions given in Dundas's
despatch prescribed in the case of commissioned officers neither
maximum nor minimum.</p>
<p>The other point in which the scheme failed to realise the
expectations which had been formed was the ease with which
settlers were able to dispose of their property. They were
required by the conditions embodied in the grants to reside upon
and cultivate the land; but there was nothing to prevent them
from selling their allotments after they had gone into
possession. Phillip brought the question under the notice of the
British Government in his despatch of the 4th October,
1792:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Experience has also pointed out many inconveniences
attending the receiving men as settlers who only look to the
convenience of the present moment. With some the sole object in
becoming settlers is that of being their own masters, and with
others the object is to raise as much money as will pay their
passage to England, and then assign their lands to those who take
them with the same view."</blockquote>
<p>Phillip went on to say that there were many settlers of this
class at Norfolk Island. According to a report from
Lieutenant-Governor King, forwarded by Phillip to Dundas, many of
the settlers at Norfolk Island actually applied to the master of
the Pitt to take them off the island, whereupon they were called
together and informed that if any of them endeavoured to leave
before or soon after the expiration of the twelve months for
which they were to be victualled from the public stores they
would be detained until the quantity of provisions issued to them
had been made good. This was a rough-and-ready way of dealing
with the situation, but it was effective; and as no grants had
yet been issued, Phillip was able to prevent what he described as
an "imposition" by ordering the removal of some of the convicts
from the land, and giving to others leases for five or ten years,
instead of free grants. <a href="#note-248" name="noteref-248"
id="noteref-248">{20}</a></p>
<p>Grose noticed a similar disposition on the part of the
settlers at Sydney and Parramatta, but in their cases,
unfortunately, grants had been issued. In his first despatch to
the Home Department, 9th January, 1793, the Lieutenant-Governor
reported that he was "much plagued with the people who become
settlers, who have evidently no other view than the purpose of
raising a sufficient supply to pay their passages to England." He
also complained that the settlers persisted in selling their live
stock. Some sheep which Governor Phillip on his departure had
divided among them "were almost as soon as given offered for
sale", and Grose was "absolutely obliged to encourage and promote
the purchase of them by the officers, dreading that, without this
precaution, the dissipation of a week would exterminate
effectually a stock that had been the work of years to collect."
It became known to the authorities that the military settlers
sold their land as well as their live stock to the officers,
while many of the convict settlers bartered away their
possessions for rum. <a href="#note-249" name="noteref-249" id=
"noteref-249">{21}</a></p>
<p>It is worthy of note that Grose, who assumed the government of
the colony on Phillip's departure in December, 1792, began to
issue grants to the officers of the New South Wales Corps before
the arrival of Dundas's despatch, which did not reach him until
the 16th January, 1793. He justified his action on the ground
that he could not conceive the existence of any intention on the
part of the Home Government to deal less liberally with the
commissioned officers of the Corps than with the non-commissioned
officers and men. <a href="#note-250" name="noteref-250" id=
"noteref-250">{22}</a></p>
<p>In Phillip's Additional Instructions, the assignment system,
which exerted so powerful an influence on the social conditions
of the colony, was for the first time officially recognised. With
certain limitations prescribed by the Governor, it had been in
operation from the beginning. The only labour available in the
early days of the colony was that of the convicts; and when
Phillip, without waiting for instructions, gave to the civil and
military officers their small plots of land, he also took the
responsibility of placing convict labour at their disposal. But
this was a measure of expediency only. Phillip did not think it
desirable that the practice should endure; his view was that the
services of the convicts should not be monopolised by the
officers, who in his day made but a poor use of their
opportunities, but that they should be distributed among the free
settlers he so ardently desired to see established on the land.
Writing to Lord Sydney on the 12th February, 1790, he remarked
that it had been necessary to give convicts to the officers, but
that the practice was "attended with many inconveniences", and
would not be continued after the marine detachment was relieved,
unless directions to the contrary were received. In another
despatch, written a day later, he gave his views as to the
conditions on which convicts should be assigned to
settlers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As the labour of clearing the ground of timber will
be great, I think each settler should not have less than twenty
men on his farm, which I suppose to be from five hundred to one
thousand acres; it will be necessary to give that number of
convicts to those settlers who come out, and to support them for
two years from the public stores; in that time, if they are any
ways industrious&mdash;and I do not think they will be able to do
it in less time&mdash;at the expiration of the two years they may
return half the convicts they have been allowed, and would want
no further assistance from Government".<br>
<br>
"It may be necessary to grant lands to officers and soldiers who,
becoming settlers, will of course be entitled to every
indulgence; but few of the officers now here have reaped any
great advantage from being allowed convicts; and it is attended
with unavoidable inconveniences, from the convicts being left so
much to themselves, and from their mixing with the
soldiers."</blockquote>
<p>Phillip's opinion was that instead of assisting military
settlers with convict labour, the better plan would be to allow
them a certain quantity of grain for the support of their live
stock until they had a market to go to. He went on to speak of
the regulations that would have to be made if these suggestions
were adopted; but he was in ignorance of the act that while he
was writing his despatch the Additional Instructions, signed by
the King, were on their way to Sydney on board the Lady Juliana.
But for the extraordinarily long passage made by that vessel, he
would have received them before he had put pen to paper. Although
the officers were not mentioned in the Additional Instructions
which authorised the Governor to assign to each
grantee&mdash;non-commissioned officer or private&mdash;the
service of as many convicts as could be employed to advantage
they obtained very soon afterwards, as much land as they
required, and as many convict servants as they could conveniently
employ. <a href="#note-251" name="noteref-251" id=
"noteref-251">{23}</a></p>
<p>The condition that assigned convicts were to be maintained,
fed, and clothed by those for whom they worked was found to be
impracticable. When the Additional Instructions reached the
colony the people were in a state of semi-starvation, and the
convicts, from the privations they had undergone, were unfit for
the severe labour of clearing and breaking up the land. After the
arrival of the Second Fleet they were in a better condition for
work; but no settler could have taken up land with any prospect
of success unless, his labourers, as well as himself, were
supported for a time from the public store. Phillip pointed this
out at once, expressing the opinion that it would be two years
before the land would support the cultivators. He took the
responsibility of relaxing the condition, and it became the rule
to give to settlers the service of convicts who were victualled
for a certain period at the public cost.</p>
<p>The Additional Instructions were accompanied by a table of
fees, but it was expressly directed that the non-commissioned
officers of the marines and convict settlers were not to be
subjected to the payment of such charges. The fees were moderate
in amount, and the schedule would excite no attention but for the
revelation it makes of the existence in the minds of British
Ministers of much larger views with regard to the occupation of
the land than are disclosed by the Instructions.</p>
<p>The largest grant that Phillip was authorised to make was one
hundred and fifty acres, with the addition, in the case of
non-commissioned officers who were married, of ten acres for each
child. The grants to non-military settlers were not to go beyond
this limit. But the list of fees authorised by the table, which
was to be "hung up in one of the most public places", provides
not only for small grants of land, but grants of great extent.
The Governor's fees, which come first, are as follows:&mdash;"For
the Great Seal to every grant not exceeding 1,000 acres, 5s.; for
all grants exceeding 1,000 acres&mdash;for every 1,000 acres each
grant contains, 2s. 6d.; for a license of occupation, 5s." Under
the heading "Secretary's Fees" a charge of 5s. is made for grants
under 100 acres; a charge of 10s. for grants between 100 and 500
acres; and "for every grant from 1,000 to 20,000&mdash;for the
first 1,000 acres, 15s., and for every 1,000 acres more, 2s. 6d."
Another item under the head "Secretary's Fees" is as
follows:&mdash;"For grants of land where the number of
proprietors shall exceed twenty, each right, 2s. 6d." Licenses of
occupation, with no limit as to the area of land to be occupied,
are also provided for. While, therefore, the Additional
Instructions restricted the area of land to be granted to any one
person to a comparatively small area, provision was made in the
schedule of fees for grants up to 20,000 acres, either to
settlers, associated proprietors, or companies. It is evident
that at the time the schedule was prepared the British Government
had in view the occupation of land in New South Wales at a date
not far distant by a class of men quite different from those
provided for in the Additional Instructions. <a href="#note-252"
name="noteref-252" id="noteref-252">{24}</a></p>
<p>Other proposals for taking up land on a large scale were under
notice in the years 1791 and 1792, and it is not improbable that
they had been submitted informally as early as the year 1789.
Sometime in 1791 a Quaker named John Sutton was in correspondence
with the Home Department concerning the terms on which Quaker
families would be accepted as emigrants. <a href="#note-253"
name="noteref-253" id="noteref-253">{25}</a> Sutton made certain
proposals, which were agreed to in a modified form, and it was
arranged that fifteen families should go out. The principal
conditions were that the emigrants should have free grants of
land, that they should have implements and tools out of the
public store, provisions for two years, and the service of
convicts free of charge, who were to receive two years' rations
and one year's clothing from the store. <a href="#note-254" name=
"noteref-254" id="noteref-254">{26}</a> Nothing appears in the
memorandum of conditions to show what area of land was to be
granted; but in the proposals made by Sutton it was stipulated
that each settler should have not less than five hundred acres;
and it was further proposed that the "said settlers" should
receive a grant of "such further tracts of land as they may
respectively discover, survey, and lay out free of expence and
quit-rent, the same not exceeding twenty thousand acres in one
tract." There is a coincidence here that will not escape notice.
Sutton asked for a grant under certain conditions of "twenty
thousand acres in one tract"&mdash;the schedule of fees attached
to the Additional Instructions provided for the issue of grants
of land up to twenty thousand acres. Sutton's proposal was not
placed in writing before the Government until the latter part of
1791; but a comparison of figures leads to the inference that
this plan of emigration, or something like it, had been under
consideration at an earlier date than that borne by the
Additional Instructions.</p>
<p>Sutton and his Quaker families did not go to New South Wales.
The British Government was anxious that the arrangement should be
carried out, and some of the intending emigrants left the
provinces and went to London with the view of embarking.</p>
<p>Dundas wrote to Phillip on the 10th January, 1792, informing
him that a vessel had been taken up for the purpose of conveying
stores to the colony, and that "every encouragement "would be
given "to induce certain settlers (who are Quakers, to the amount
of fifteen families, and who have made proposals to the
Government) to embark by the same conveyance." Six months later
he wrote another letter, explaining that difficulties had arisen,
causing delay, and that the transport Bellona was about to be
despatched with eleven settlers. He expressed regret that these
"are as yet all that have offered themselves". Nothing was said
in this despatch about the Quaker families. The delay that took
place seems to have been fatal to the plan. While the intending
emigrants were waiting in London unfavourable reports concerning
the colony reached their ears; becoming dissatisfied, and perhaps
alarmed, they abandoned the enterprise, and returned to the
places from whence they came. According to Collins, they had
actually "engaged to take their passage" in the Bellona, "but it
was said they had been diverted from their purpose by some
misrepresentations which had been made to them respecting this
country." <a href="#note-255" name="noteref-255" id=
"noteref-255">{27}</a></p>
<p>In January, 1792, Mr. G. Matcham, writing from Lower
Grosvenor-place, offered to send out one or more families as
settlers, and his younger son, with a capital of &pound;3,000
&pound;4,000, provided that he could obtain "such an extent of
country as to make it an object of attention" to him. He
suggested that the area should be "ten or twenty thousand
acres&mdash;two or three hundred acres between Rose Hill and
Sydney Cove, or on the opposite shore between Rose Hill and the
mouth of the harbour (where, I understand, there are no
settlers), and the remainder in a direct line towards Broken
Bay." <a href="#note-256" name="noteref-256" id=
"noteref-256">{28}</a> It is clear that this gentleman
contemplated a free grant of land, for he commenced this letter
with the remark that he had been induced to write it by "the
proposals made to free settlers in New South Wales". In a letter
written some months afterwards he intimated that "twelve thousand
acres are the least that can make it an object to me", and he
offered to pay a quit-rent, or to purchase the land. A few months
later, Mr. W. Richards, junr., who had made several contracts
with the Government for the conveyance of convicts to New South
Wales, submitted proposals for supplying the settlement with
stores. While the matter was before the Treasury, he wrote to Sir
Joseph Banks, intimating that if his terms were agreed to, and he
was allowed to open a store at Port Jackson, and also to take up
land, he would become a settler. <a href="#note-257" name=
"noteref-257" id="noteref-257">{29}</a> He pressed the subject on
the attention of Banks, but nothing seems to have come of either
Richards's proposals or those submitted by Matcham.</p>
<p>It was further provided in the Additional Instructions that
the land should be so parcelled out that each grantee would have
a fair proportion of good and inferior land and of whatever
water-frontage might be available. The breadth of the allotments
was to be one-third of the length and the length was not to
"extend along the banks of any river, but into the mainland, that
thereby the said grantees may have each a convenient share of
what accommodation the said harbour or river may afford for
navigation or otherwise". It was also directed that, between the
allotments of one hundred acres or fifty acres, spaces "ten acres
in breadth and thirty acres in length" <a href="#note-258" name=
"noteref-258" id="noteref-258">{30}</a> should be reserved for
the Crown, but open to be leased at the discretion of the
Governor for any term not exceeding fourteen years. The Governor
was further required to lay out "townships" and "towns" in such
situations as he judged proper, and to provide for the settlement
of families in towns, "with town and pasture lots convenient to
each tenement", The towns were to be laid out upon or near some
navigable river or the sea-coast, and land was to be reserved in
the township for military and naval purposes, "and more
particularly for the building a town-hall and such other public
edifices" as might be deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Phillip was also directed "that a particular spot, in or as
near each town as possible, be set apart for the building of a
church, and four hundred acres adjacent thereto allotted for the
maintenance of a minister, and two hundred for a
schoolmaster."</p>
<p>The Governor, it may be supposed, was somewhat puzzled by the
direction to lay out the settlement like a chess-board, putting
the settlers on one set of squares, and reserving the others for
the Crown. If the matter had been left in his hands he would
probably have taken the land just as it came, and allotted it in
the way most conducive to its profitable occupation. It is
possible that the idea of the Government was that the blocks of
land reserved for the Crown would be made valuable by settlement
around them, and might therefore be disposed of afterwards to
advantage. The plan was good in theory only; in practice it broke
down completely. Phillip, who did his best to carry out the
instructions he received, no matter how they conflicted with his
own views, obeyed orders, and placed the first settlers on
isolated patches of land. But he soon found that this arrangement
was not only disadvantageous, but dangerous. The settlers, he
explained in a letter to Grenville, were, by this disposition of
the land, separated from each other by forests, and exposed, to
the attacks of hostile natives, and as each allotment was
occupied by one man, "or at most a man and a woman", the settlers
were liable to be cut off in detail. There were other
disadvantages belonging to the system. The settlers, Phillip
pointed out, could not so readily assist each other in moving
heavy timber; the labour of fencing, the ground was greatly
increased; and every man was obliged to watch his own farm,
which, from being surrounded with a wood, was peculiarly liable
to depredation. Accordingly, Phillip gave to the settlers the
land which had been reserved for the Crown; they were thus placed
in a position in which they could unite for the purposes of
industry or defence. He explained to the Home Department that the
force of circumstances had obliged him to deviate from the
Instructions, and his action in this respect was not called in
question.</p>
<p>The plan broke down in Norfolk Island also, but for a
different reason. There were no natives there, but the small area
of available land rendered obedience to the Instructions
incompatible with the settlement of the island. On the 8th May,
1792, six months after he took charge as Lieutenant-Governor,
King wrote to Dundas to explain that, like Phillip, he had been
obliged to depart from his instructions. <a href="#note-259"
name="noteref-259" id="noteref-259">{31}</a> He did not do away
with the reserves altogether, but in order to make room for the
settlers, for whom he had been instructed to make provision, he
was obliged to greatly reduce the area of the intermediate
spaces.</p>
<p>The command given to the Governor to lay out "townships" and
"towns" in proximity to the coast was made apparently in
ignorance of the conditions prevailing at the settlement,
although Phillip's despatches had disclosed plainly enough the
nature of the adjacent country. The word "township" was used in
the Instructions in a different sense from that which custom has
given it in these Colonies. Centres of population are cities or
towns; places of lesser importance, which elsewhere would be
called villages or hamlets, are townships; in other words, a
township is a small town. But the "townships" contemplated by the
Additional Instructions were something different; they signified
areas or districts which were to be devoted to agricultural
purposes, of which the town, with its public buildings, was to be
the head-quarters or centre. It was intended, apparently, that
these townships or agricultural areas should be laid out in
contiguous blocks, each having its town; and in that manner
settlement was to spread over the country. Little attention had
been given to Phillip's despatches, or this mistaken notion would
not have been embodied in a set of Instructions with which the
Governor was enjoined to give exact compliance. The fact was, as
the accounts which had reached the Government from its
representative showed, only a few patches of arable land had been
discovered anywhere near the coast; the greater part of the
country known in Phillip's time was rough and unfit for
agriculture. But in framing the conditions of land settlement no
thought appears to have been given to the circumstances of the
colony, of which the British Government, according to Grenville
himself, was practically ignorant.</p>

Henry Taylor, who commenced his official life as a clerk in the
Colonial Office, mentions in Ins Autobiography (vol. i, p. 70),
that while but a young man, and during the first decade of his
service, the Governor of an important colony was recalled at his
instance. The Secretary of State was, at first, not prepared for
so strong a measure; but, "Nowise discouraged by his reluctance,
I proceeded to draw up an elaborate and voluminous despatch,
recapitulating the Governor's errors and misdoings from the
commencement of his administration, and ending with his recall.
The Secretary of State gave way, the despatch was signed, and the
Governor came home accordingly."</p>

The opinion of the settlement on the question is thus stated by
Collins (vol. i, p. 129):&mdash;"The period fixed by Government
for victualling a settler from the public stores&mdash;twelve
months&mdash;was, in general, looked upon as too short, and it
was thought not practicable for anyone at the end of that period
to maintain himself, unless during that time he should have very

The answer of five officers to the question as to whether they
were desirous of remaining in the colony were as
follows:&mdash;Watkin Tench, captain-lieutenant&mdash;"As a
soldier for one tour of three years more." George Johnston, first
lieutenant&mdash;"Having been so short a time in this country,
cannot determine whether he would wish to remain or not; as to
settling can say nothing." John Johnstone, first
lieutenant&mdash;"Having been so short a time in this country,
cannot determine whether he would wish to remain or not; as to
settling, can say nothing until he knows on what terms." James
Maitland Shairp, first lieutenant&mdash;"Being so short a time in
the country, he cannot yet judge whether he would wish to remain
or not; at to settling, until he knows the terms and nature of
the grant, can't determine." William Dawes, second
lieutenant&mdash;"As a soldier for one tour of three years
more."&mdash;Historical Records, vol. i, part 2, p. 201. On the
10th July, Ross forwarded letters to the Admiralty from
lieutenants Poulden, Timins, Davey, Clarke, Creswell, and Kellow,
requesting that they might be relieved at the expiration of three
years, on the ground that private affairs in England required
their attention.-Ib., p. 165. Captain Collins, the
Judge-Advocate, also wished to return to England; in December,
1792, he wrote to Dundas asking to be relieved from further
service in the colony, but the application was not
granted.&mdash;Ib., p. 674.</p>

Measures to prevent the abuse of their privileges by the convict
settlers were taken. Writing from Whitehall, on the 30th June,
1793, Dundas directed that the following clause should be
inserted in all grants made to convicts either on emancipation or
on the expiration of the terms for which they had been
transported:&mdash;"And it is hereby provided that the said
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; shall reside upon and cultivate the lands
hereby granted for and during the term of five years from the
date hereof, provided the said &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; shall so
long live; and any sale or conveyance of the said lands before
the expiration of the said term of five years shall be void, and
the said lands shall in such case revert to his Majesty, his
heirs and successors, except it shall be certified under the hand
and seal of the Governor, or in his absence the
Lieutenant-Governor, of his Majesty's Colony of New South Wales
for the time being, that the same was made with his consent." It
was also directed that leases made to settlers of the convict
class should not be assignable except with the consent, in
writing, of the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor.&mdash;Historical

Referring to the issue of a grant for twenty-five acres to
Lieutenant Cummings on the 13th December, 1792, Collins says
(vol. i, p. 256):&mdash;"In the instructions for granting lands
in this country, no mention of officers had yet been made; it
was, however, fairly presumed that the officers could not be
intended to be precluded from the participation of any advantages
which the Crown might have to bestow in the settlements,
particularly as the greatest in its gift, the free possession of
land, was held out to people who had forfeited their lives before
they came into the country."</p>

It does not appear that any definite steps in this direction were
taken so early as 1789; but the Records show that proposals were
under the consideration of the Government not long afterwards. In
vol. i, part 2, of the Historical Records, p. 424, will be found
a proposal to send out families to settle in New South Wales. It
is printed from a manuscript in the handwriting of Sir Joseph
Banks, and it ends with the words, "My proposal read to Mr.
Nepean". It is not certain that the proposal was made by Sir
Joseph Banks himself. He was in the habit, as the papers
purchased by the New South Wales Government from Lord Brabourne
show, of making copies of documents bearing upon the affairs of
the colony, and the words "my proposal read to Mr. Nepean" may
have formed part of an original document written by somebody
else. It would seem, however, that this proposal, which
contemplated the grant of an "estate" to the person who made it,
to be occupied by families to be sent from England, was actually
laid by Sir Joseph Banks before the Under Secretary of the Home
Department. The MS. bears no date, but it is believed to have
been written sometime in the year 1790. Possibly it was written
at an earlier date, or communicated, verbally, to the Secretary
of State, or the Under Secretary, previous to the framing of the
schedule of fees attached to the Additional Instructions.</p>

By this was probably meant an area having a frontage of ten
squares, each containing one acre, and a depth of thirty squares,
each containing one acre&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, three hundred acres.
The expression was not repeated in Hunter's Instructions; he was

"When I arrived here I found eight seamen and two marines
belonging to the Sirius were already settled, and agreeable to
Governor Phillip's instructions to Major Ross (the then
Commandant of the Island) there was left a space of fifty rods in
front for the use of the Crown between each settler. On the
Deputy-Surveyor's representing to me that if the same measurement
was observed in settling the other marines who came with me and
who followed in the Queen there would not be sufficient ground
for half of them, . . . . I undertook to give directions that the
intermediate spaces should be only twenty rods, by which means
they are all well settled alone the runs of water. I beg, sir, to
observe that nothing but the very great inconvenience which I
foresaw would occur could have induced me to have taken this

<h3>8. PROGRESS OF THE SETTLEMENT AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE SECOND
FLEET. <small>[1790-91]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>FOR</small> some time after the arrival of the Second
Fleet the strength of the community was employed in attending to
the sick convicts and providing for their better accommodation.
In the letter in which he reported the arrival of the ships,
Phillip, while promising Lord Grenville that preparations should
be made for the reception of a fresh batch of one thousand
convicts, explained that "the building of stores and barracks
will find full employment for the few artificers in this
settlement for some months, and the number of sick will employ
all our carpenters for some time in procuring them shelter."
<a href="#note-260" name="noteref-260" id="noteref-260">{1}</a>
But the cultivation of the soil was not neglected; and in the
month of July, 1790, all the convicts who were fit to leave the
hospitals were sent to Rose Hill. <a href="#note-261" name=
"noteref-261" id="noteref-261">{2}</a> This was the best thing to
do with men enfeebled by suffering and privation; but although
they were employed under the most favourable conditions, so far
as health was concerned, their services were of little value. How
little the convicts sent out in the Second Fleet contributed to
the development of the country at that time is shown by the
Governor's despatches to the Home Department. "I have increased",
wrote Phillip, "the number of those employed in clearing the land
for cultivation, as far as it will be possible to do it before
next January, except by convalescents, from whom little labour
can be expected." <a href="#note-262" name="noteref-262" id=
"noteref-262">{3}</a> The returns, enclosed with Phillip's letter
of 17th July, 1790, show that the number of men employed in
clearing and cultivating the land at Rose Hill was only 113, not
one of whom was capable of doing a good day's work.. Although
there were many fresh mouths to fill, the producing power of the
community had not been materially increased. Five or six months
would have to elapse before the labourers in the field could be
reinforced with effect, and by the expiration of that period
harvest-time would have arrived. In other words, the season would
be lost.</p>
<p>According to the return alluded to above, there were at work
at Sydney 316 male convicts, some of whom were convalescents,
while the number incapacitated by sickness was 413. At Rose Hill
154 were employed, and 25 were sick.</p>
<p>In the face of these difficulties, Phillip acted with
promptitude and sagacity. On the site where Parramatta now stands
he immediately laid out a town on regular lines, the principal
street of which was to contain huts for the accommodation of the
convicts of the Second Fleet. This street, which is identical
with the present George-street, Parramatta, ran from the public
landing-place up to the foot of the "Crescent" or rising ground
on which still stands the old Government House. The huts were
built of wattle and plaster, with thatched roofs. As a precaution
against fire, the street was formed with a width of 200 feet; and
the huts were separated from each other, according to Phillip, by
spaces of 100 feet. <a href="#note-263" name="noteref-263" id=
"noteref-263">{4}</a> Each hut was to contain ten convicts; and
sufficient ground was allowed, in each case, for a
vegetable-garden. Captain Tench visited the "town" in November,
1790, and reported upon the progress which had been made.
Thirty-two of the huts were completed. They were each 24 feet by
12, and were divided into two rooms, "in one of which is a
fireplace and brick chimney". Some of the huts contained as many
as twelve or fourteen convicts. Considerable progress had also
been made with a number of public buildings; amongst others, "a
house of lathe and plaister 44 feet long by 16 wide for the
Governor on a ground-floor only, with excellent outhouses and
appurtenances attached to it." In December, 1791, Tench again
visited Rose Hill. The "great road" of convict huts was then
finished. It was "a very noble one, of great breadth and a mile
long in a strait line", calculated to "make Pall Mall and
Portland Place hide their diminished heads". <a href="#note-264"
name="noteref-264" id="noteref-264">{5}</a> In the eyes of Tench
and many of his contemporaries, Parramatta was the future
metropolis of the settlement.</p>
<p>At first no distinction was made between the "town" and the
surrounding district. They were both known as Rose Hill; but on
the 4th June, 1791, Phillip took advantage of the ceremonials in
connection with the anniversary of the birthday of George III, to
publicly announce that from that date it would be known by the
native name of the spot on which it stood, viz., Parramatta.
<a href="#note-265" name="noteref-265" id="noteref-265">{6}</a>
Between the Parramatta of his time and the Parramatta of to-day
there is no resemblance. The widely-separated huts have
disappeared, and in their places are houses closely packed
together; the desolate-looking street two hundred feet in width
has become a business thoroughfare sixty-six feet wide. <a href=
"#note-266" name="noteref-266" id="noteref-266">{7}</a></p>
<p>Phillip saw that "some little inconveniences" might be felt
from the convicts being "so much dispersed", but he pointed out
that to give these people their own gardens was "a spur to
industry, which they would not have if employed in a publick
garden, tho' intirely for their own benefit." In this sentence
Phillip describes in a few words one of the peculiar
disadvantages under which the settlement laboured. It depended
mainly upon the labour of the convicts, by whom work was regarded
as a part of the punishment to which they had been sentenced, and
they shirked it whenever they could. To agricultural labour they
seem to have had a particular aversion. Phillip tried to make
them understand that when they plied the hoe and the spade they
were working for their own benefit, but he failed signally. He
was right, nevertheless. The community, from the Governor
downwards, suffered from the want of fresh food; and as all
shared alike, the labourers in the field were in reality working
for their own advantage. But the convicts could not, or would
not, see this. It was enough for them that the work was
compulsory; they detested it, and avoided it as much as possible.
In giving them their own gardens, Phillip touched the only
vulnerable spot; he appealed to the selfishness of human nature,
and he did not appeal in vain.</p>
<p>The land which the convicts cultivated for their own profit
was not, of course, granted to them. It was simply held during
the pleasure of the Governor, and might pass out of the hands of
the occupiers without a moment's notice.</p>
<p>Phillip, in founding the town of Parramatta, did not
contemplate the establishment there of a permanent convict
settlement. He was obliged to put the convicts on the soil to
begin with, but he proposed that they should be removed in a few
years to new country, at a distance from Sydney, and that the
town of Parramatta should be placed at the disposal of free
settlers, who, he supposed, would be glad to build on the ground.
<a href="#note-267" name="noteref-267" id="noteref-267">{8}</a>
It was impossible to "detach a body of convicts to any distance",
because there was no one to whom the charge of a distant
settlement could be given. <a href="#note-268" name="noteref-268"
id="noteref-268">{9}</a> If it had been determined, for example,
to establish a settlement on the Hawkesbury, as was done a few
years afterwards, nothing would have been easier than to have
sent with the convicts a detachment of troops under an officer as
a guard; but something more than this was required. It would have
been useless to send to a distance a number of men who only
worked under compulsion, and knew nothing of agriculture, without
some one to direct their labours, and Phillip, as already
mentioned, had no such man at his command. A still more serious
obstacle, and one which Phillip had more difficulty in
surmounting, stood in the way of his efforts to advantageously
employ the convicts who arrived in June, 1790. This was the
drought which lasted from July of that year until August,
1791.</p>
<p>Phillip reported in March, 1791, that:&mdash;"From June until
the present time so little rain has fallen that most of the runs
of water in the different parts of this harbour have been dried
up for several months, and the run which supplies this settlement
<a href="#note-269" name="noteref-269" id="noteref-269">{10}</a>
is greatly reduced, but still sufficient for all culinary
purposes." <a href="#note-270" name="noteref-270" id=
"noteref-270">{11}</a> This condition of things seems to have
surprised Phillip, who offered the opinion, with some confidence,
that such a dry season did not often occur. He was speaking, of
course, of the coast districts, for his knowledge of the country
went no further; and it is worthy of note that in this, as in
other matters, he formed a sound opinion from very slender
evidence. Severe and prolonged droughts are common in the
interior parts of New South Wales and the other Australian
colonies, but they are infrequent on the coast.</p>
<p>The crops sown in 1790, Phillip reported, had suffered greatly
from the dry weather. <a href="#note-271" name="noteref-271" id=
"noteref-271">{12}</a> He remarked, however, that they had turned
out better than was expected; but did not state how many acres
were in cultivation, nor what the yield was, although he had
given particulars of the previous harvest. Collins, who reported
the former season's yield, is also silent with regard to this
harvest. In fact, it is evident that the yield was too small to
be worth mentioning. Mrs. Macarthur, writing to England in March,
1791, made the following allusion to this subject:&mdash;"We have
not attempted anything in the farming way. Our neighbours succeed
so badly that we are not encouraged to follow their example. The
Government farm did not this year, in grain, return three times
the seed that had been sown." <a href="#note-272" name=
"noteref-272" id="noteref-272">{13}</a> In the same month,
Phillip, anxious to represent affairs in the most favourable
light, reported that the progress made in agriculture since "last
June" had been considerable, and that at Rose Hill two hundred
and thirteen acres would be sown "this year", that is to say, in
1791.</p>
<p>Tench gives a more complete account of the state of
agriculture at the close of the year 1790 than either Phillip or
Collins. In November of that year he inspected the settlement at
Rose Hill. He found two hundred acres cleared and cultivated; "of
these, fifty are in wheat, barley, and a little oats, thirty in
maize, and the remainder is either just cleared of wood, or is
occupied by buildings, gardens, &amp;c." Four enclosures of
twenty acres each had been marked out for cattle, two of which
were fenced in. The Rev. Richard Johnson is referred to as "the
best farmer in the country". The fifty acres of wheat and barley
were expected to yield four hundred bushels. Tench mentions
incidentally that all the land was turned by the convicts with
the hoe; the daily task of each convict being sixteen
rods&mdash;one-tenth of an acre. <a href="#note-273" name=
"noteref-273" id="noteref-273">{14}</a></p>
<p>The area proposed to be sown in 1791 (213 acres) was not
large, but Phillip looked hopefully to the future. The essential
point was the maintenance of the supply of food from England.
Phillip was convinced that the people would soon be able to
support themselves if the land was brought under cultivation, but
unless the labourers were well fed they could not work. The
country in its natural state afforded no subsistence; everything
depended on a regular supply of food from England. After
reporting what had been done, Phillip said, "And I hope we shall
be enabled by the arrival of the necessary supply of provisions
to continue our labours." These supplies did not arrive with the
regularity that was desired. Writing on the 24th July, 1790,
Phillip informed Nepean that no butter, oil, or pease had been
received, neither were there any spirits in stock. These articles
had not been supplied when Phillip, writing to Grenville eight
months later, expressed the hope that the speedy arrival of the
ships from England would make a reduction of the ration
unnecessary; and, on the 1st April, 1791, he was obliged to
reduce the allowance of food by one-quarter. <a href="#note-274"
name="noteref-274" id="noteref-274">{15}</a> To make matters
worse, the quality of the provisions was inferior. The flour,
which had been bought in Batavia at a high price, was, according
to Phillip, "full one-eighth bran, and the rice was bad". Collins
gives a still more unfavourable description of the food upon
which the people had to subsist. According to his account the
flour was "the best article" dispensed from the stores. "The rice
was found to be full of weevils; the pork was ill-flavoured,
rusty, and smoked; and the beef was lean, and, by being cured
with spices, truly unpalatable. Much of both these articles when
they came to be dressed could not be used." <a href="#note-275"
name="noteref-275" id="noteref-275">{16}</a> In his letter to
Wilberforce, <a href="#note-276" name="noteref-276" id=
"noteref-276">{17}</a> Captain Hill complained bitterly of the
"scanty pittance of salt provisions" on which he had to live, and
which was set before him "unaccompanied by either vegetable,
vinegar, or other thing to render it palatable or wholesome." He
was obliged to buy some wine to "counteract the effects of the
diabolical morsel I am daily obliged to eat".</p>
<p>The circumstances were altogether unfavourable for
agricultural operations. The effect of the reduction in the
rations and of the innutritious food could, wrote Collins, be
seen in "the countenances of the labouring convicts". Those of
the First Fleet had not recovered from the effects of the famine
of 1789-90, and those "who arrived in June, had not recovered
from the severity of their passage to this country." <a href=
"#note-277" name="noteref-277" id="noteref-277">{18}</a></p>
<p>When the conditions under which the cultivation of the soil
was commenced at Rose Hill are considered, surprise must be felt,
not that so little progress was made in the first year, but that
anything was done at all.</p>
<p>The progress made in building during the year following the
arrival of the Second Fleet was much greater than might have been
expected. Phillip reported to Grenville on the 4th March,
1791:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Three stores, sufficient to contain two years'
provisions for the Battlement, are built here <a href="#note-278"
name="noteref-278" id="noteref-278">{19}</a> [Sydney] and at Rose
Hill; they are of brick and tiled, so that we are no longer under
any apprehensions of an accident from fire. A barrack is also
finished at Rose Hill for an hundred men, and the officers'
barracks will be finished by the end of May, immediately after
which barracks for officers and men will be begun at this place
[Sydney]."</blockquote>
<p>This was the first despatch which Phillip had sent to England
since July, 1790; it contained, therefore, a report of his
proceedings for nearly eight months. The buildings spoken of were
commenced after the arrival of the Second Fleet&mdash;a
storehouse and new barracks at Rose Hill were built, according to
Collins, during the months September-December. The storehouse at
Rose Hill, one hundred feet long and twenty-four feet wide, was
begun and finished in November, which was a rainless month. In
December the foundations of a new storehouse at Sydney were laid.
Although water was badly wanted for the crops, the drought was
convenient for building operations. Good clay had been found from
which bricks were made, but so great was the hurry that the
bricks were used without being burnt&mdash;before, in fact, the
clay had become dry. Properly-burnt bricks, however, could not
have been used, because there was no lime at hand with which to
make mortar. Under these circumstances, undried bricks, although
not very durable, served the purpose better than anything else.
Phillip thus explained his building difficulties to
Grenville:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The want of limestone still obliges us to confine
our buildings to a certain height, for although the clay is of a
strong binding nature, we cannot with safety carry the walls of
those buildings [the storehouses and the barracks] more than
twelve feet above the ground, as the rains are at times very
heavy, and should they come on before the clay is thoroughly dry,
the walls would be in danger from the great weight of the
roof."</blockquote>
<p>While Phillip was devoting himself to the development of the
new settlement at Parramatta, <a href="#note-279" name=
"noteref-279" id="noteref-279">{20}</a> he had to look sharply
after affairs in Sydney; for there were many things upon which it
was necessary to keep a watchful eye. One of them was the
practices of the mobsters and sailors of transports, who were
only too ready to help the convicts to get away from the
settlement. <a href="#note-280" name="noteref-280" id=
"noteref-280">{21}</a> The sailors belonging to the transports
were, according to Collins, guilty of "much irregularity" when
they went on shore. Phillip was greatly concerned at the thought
of losing capable workmen, the bone and sinew upon which the
progress of the settlement depended; and he accordingly took
vigorous measures to prevent it.</p>
<p>This practice had begun soon after the arrival of the First
Fleet. The Charlotte, which sailed in May, 1788, carried away a
seaman belonging to the Supply, and a young man who was an
apprentice to the boatswain of the Sirius. Writing to Nepean on
the 22nd August, 1790 Phillip reported that several convicts had
escaped in this way. The evil, he declared, could not be checked
unless the masters of the ships were prosecuted with severity.
The very next day, several convicts being missing, a search was
made on board the Neptune, and one of them was discovered in the
hold. It was asserted by the quarter-master of the vessel that
"preparation had been made when the people stowed the hold for
concealing convicts". Phillip believed that other convicts were
concealed on the Neptune. He warned her master that he would be
prosecuted if he assisted convicts to escape; but beyond this he
could do nothing. <a href="#note-281" name="noteref-281" id=
"noteref-281">{22}</a></p>
<p>Phillip returned to the subject in a letter to Nepean, 14th
December, 1791. He sent the names of a number of convicts who
were believed to have been concealed on board the transports and
carried from the settlement, and suggested that in future the
masters of such vessels should be required to keep a record of
all persons who were received on board from the time they came on
the coast to their return to England, a heavy penalty to be paid
for neglect to register the name of any convict shipped. The
suggestion was adopted by the British Government, and Phillip was
informed by Dundas in a despatch, written on the 10th January,
1792, that masters of vessels who offended in the manner
complained of would be made liable to forfeit their
charter-parties.</p>
<p>This rigorous measure, although it did not prevent the escape
of convicts by the transports, at all events kept down the
practice; but there was another kind of absconding which could
not be guarded against in the same manner. The longing for
freedom and the distaste for work were so strong in some of the
convicts that they braved the greatest dangers and encountered
the most terrible hardships in order to escape from the
settlement. A remarkable instance occurred in September, 1790.
<a href="#note-282" name="noteref-282" id="noteref-282">{23}</a>
Phillip does not appear to have made any report on the subject to
the English authorities, but Collins gives a full account of the
affair:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In the night of the 26th [September, 1790] a
desertion of an extraordinary nature took place. Five male
convicts conveyed themselves, in a small boat called a punt, from
Rose Hill undiscovered [to Sydney]. They there exchanged the
punt, which would have been unfit for their purpose, for a boat,
though very small and weak, with a mast and sail, with which they
got out of the harbour. On sending to Rose Hill, people were
found who could give an account of their intentions and
proceedings, and who knew that they purposed steering for
Otaheite. They had each taken provisions for one week; their
cloaths and bedding; three iron pots, and some other utensils of
that nature. They all came out in the last fleet, and took this
method of speedily accomplishing their sentences of
transportation, which were for the term of their natural lives.
Their names were John Tarwood, a daring, desperate character, and
the principal in the scheme; Joseph Sutton, who was found
secreted on board the Neptune, and punished; George Lee, George
Connoway, and John Watson. A boat with an officer was sent to
search for them in the north-west branch of this harbour, but
returned, after several hours' search, without discovering the
least trace of them. They no doubt pushed directly out upon that
ocean which, from the wretched state of the boat wherein they
trusted themselves, must have proved their grave." <a href=
"#note-283" name="noteref-283" id=
"noteref-283">{24}</a></blockquote>
<p>A more desperate adventure it would be difficult to imagine.
As discovery of the fugitives by any of the search parties that
were sure to be sent out would mean return to captivity, and
punishment with the lash, the intention of Tarwood and his
companions was evidently to make their way, if possible, to some
distant country. But they were not properly equipped for an
expedition of that sort. They embarked in a small and crazy boat,
poorly provisioned and ill-furnished, and they had no firearms
with which to procure animal food or protect themselves from the
savages they might expect to encounter on the coast, where they
would be obliged to land as they travelled northwards. It seemed
likely enough, as Collins concluded, that in making their escape
from the colony they were going straight to their death. But they
did not thus perish. Nearly five years after their departure,
when the incident had been almost forgotten, four of the number,
who had been captured under remarkable circumstances, were
brought back to Sydney. The fifth was dead.</p>
<p>In August, 1795, the Providence, 28 guns, under the command of
Captain Broughton, was off Port Jackson, but was driven
northwards by adverse winds as far as Port Stephens, where four
of the runaways were discovered. This was the first port they had
reached, and they landed there. They did not attempt to continue
their voyage, probably from the want of provisions. Finding the
natives friendly, they lived among them, dragging out a miserable
existence until their recapture, which they did not try to avoid.
It is worthy of remark that some years before the arrival of the
Providence, Mr. Surveyor Grimes, while on a voyage of discovery
in the schooner Francis, visited Port Stephens, where he remained
for some days, but saw nothing of the fugitives, who at the time
were at a distance from the coast; they heard, however, of the
arrival of the schooner soon afterwards from the natives, with
whom some of the crew appear to have had an encounter. According
to Collins, the absconders took wives from the natives, and one
or two had children. <a href="#note-284" name="noteref-284" id=
"noteref-284">{25}</a></p>
<p>The incident shows how little was known, at the time, of the
country, even of the coast near Sydney. It also brought under the
notice of the new occupiers of the land a fact of which they do
not seem to have been previously aware&mdash;that the natives did
not use a common language. It was discovered that tribes not far
removed from Sydney spoke in a tongue which was not understood in
the settlement. Port Stephens is only a hundred miles from
Sydney, and yet, according to the account given by these four
men, the language differed from any dialect known in the district
surrounding Sydney. <a href="#note-285" name="noteref-285" id=
"noteref-285">{26}</a></p>
<p>Many other attempts were made to escape from the settlement,
but few were successful. One of the exceptions was the case of
Bryant and his companions. <a href="#note-286" name="noteref-286"
id="noteref-286">{27}</a> The only way in which convicts could
get clear away was by seizing a boat and putting to sea; but a
careful watch was kept, and it very seldom that escapes were made
in this manner. <a href="#note-287" name="noteref-287" id=
"noteref-287">{28}</a> It was a common thing, however, for
convicts to take to the bush in twos or threes, or in larger
parties, although the fugitives had nothing to choose between
death from starvation; or the spears of the natives, and return
to the settlement, where they were sore to be severely punished.
There seemed, however, to be an impression in the minds of some
of the convicts that it was possible to escape by land to some
other country. One party of absconders, according to their own
account, set out with the object of getting to China, but it was
generally supposed that "this improbable tale was only a cover to
the real design, which might be to procure boats, and get on
board the transports after they had left the Cove." <a href=
"#note-288" name="noteref-288" id="noteref-288">{29}</a></p>
<p>It is a noticeable fact that the convicts who seemed most
anxious to make their escape were newcomers, rather than those
who had lived for a time in the colony. On the 1st November,
1791, twenty-one convicts (including one woman) who had arrived
by the Queen about five weeks before, went off into the bush
bound for "China". Most of them were discovered a few days
afterwards, and brought back in a "state of deplorable
wretchedness, naked, and nearly worn out by hunger", but three of
the party, who were found in the neighbourhood of Narrabeen,
"notwithstanding their situation, did not readily give themselves
up". They said nothing about China, but confessed that they had
gone into the bush to escape work; and so determined were they
not to labour, if they could help it, that a few days after their
capture they again absconded. At the muster ordered in January,
1792, there were over fifty absentees. <a href="#note-289" name=
"noteref-289" id="noteref-289">{30}</a></p>
<p>Phillip before this had frequently complained of the indolence
of the convicts, but among the new arrivals the repugnance to
work was taking such an awkward shape that strong measures became
necessary. He therefore called the convicts together, and warned
them that in future absconders would be fired upon by the
soldiers wherever they were seen, and that if any were brought in
alive they would be severely punished. <a href="#note-290" name=
"noteref-290" id="noteref-290">{31}</a> Although Phillip was not
to be trifled with, he displayed neither anger nor
vindictiveness. On the contrary, having made, as he supposed, a
strong impression upon the convicts, "he forgave some offences
which had been reported by the magistrates, exhorted them to go
cheerfully to their labour, and changed their hours of work
agreeably to a request which they had made." <a href="#note-291"
name="noteref-291" id="noteref-291">{32}</a> Phillip's harangue
seems to have had the desired effect. Absconding became a much
less frequent offence, and the extreme measure of shooting down
convicts in the bush, simply because they had run away from work,
was never resorted to.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the great mortality which took place on board
the Neptune, Surprize, and Scarborough, the arrival of those
vessels and the Lady Juliana almost doubled the population of the
settlements. A return made up to the 20th July, 1790, <a href=
"#note-292" name="noteref-292" id="noteref-292">{33}</a> shows
that on that date the number of persons living at Port Jackson
and Norfolk Island, including men, women, and children,
was&mdash;at Port Jackson, 1,455; at Norfolk Island, 524; and at
Rose Hill, 260. In all, 2,239. Of the gross number, 1,640
persons, including 83 children, belonged to the convict class;
the remaining 599 constituted the free population, consisting
chiefly of the civil and military; of this number 57 were
children. Before the arrival of the Lady Juliana, the convict
population at Sydney and Rose Hill was rather less than 400; by
the time the last of the transports came in, the number had been
increased to upwards of 1,200.</p>
<p>This influx of convicts, a large number of whom required
medical treatment, while scarcely any were fit to labour, was a
serious embarrassment, and Phillip lost no time in relieving the
settlement, so far as was practicable, by sending off a batch to
Norfolk Island. The Surprize, which arrived on the 26th June, was
got ready as quickly as possible, and sailed on the 1st August
with 194 convicts, of whom 157 were women, and as large a
quantity of provisions as she could stow. The female convicts
were evidently taken chiefly from the 225 brought out by the Lady
Juliana, for previously to her arrival there were only 70 female
convicts in the settlement. The Justinian was loaded with stores
and sent to the same destination; she sailed on the 28th July,
and both vessels arrived on the same day.</p>
<p>Norfolk Island was in as great straits for food as Port
Jackson, and the relief was received with gladness. The day
before the ships arrived, the ration, which had continued to
diminish since the wreck of the Sirius in March, was reduced to a
very low point&mdash;it was described in one of the proclamations
as "the most reduced allowance that it is possible for people to
subsist on"&mdash;and even at that rate there were only
provisions for twelve weeks in store. <a href="#note-293" name=
"noteref-293" id="noteref-293">{34}</a> The timely appearance of
immense flocks of birds and the "plenty of supply of fresh fish
saved the people from starvation. <a href="#note-294" name=
"noteref-294" id="noteref-294">{35}</a> The birds referred to are
called petrels in some of the accounts, Phillip described them as
puffins. <a href="#note-295" name="noteref-295" id=
"noteref-295">{36}</a> They came in thousands to Mount Pitt, a
high hill near Sydney Bay, the head-quarters of the settlement,
and as they were easily killed they afforded an abundant supply
of animal food. It was noticed as a remarkable circumstance that
the birds made their appearance almost immediately after the loss
of the Sirius, and did not leave Mount Pitt until the relief
arrived. From this fact they were called "Birds of Providence".
They were also called "Pittites". <a href="#note-296" name=
"noteref-296" id="noteref-296">{37}</a></p>
<p>According to Collins, there went to Norfolk Island, in the
Surprize, Mr. Thomas Freeman, Deputy-Commissary, who had been
appointed to the office by the Governor's warrant, and two
superintendents, who were recent arrivals. <a href="#note-297"
name="noteref-297" id="noteref-297">{38}</a> He mentions at the
same time a name which has become historic. "There came out in
the Neptune a person of the name of Wentworth, who, being
desirous of some employment in this country, was now sent to
Norfolk Island to act as an assistant to the surgeon there, being
reputed to have the necessary requisites for such a situation."
<a href="#note-298" name="noteref-298" id="noteref-298">{39}</a>
This was Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth, a young man who had been trained
in England for the medical profession. He made good use of his
opportunities, and after a few years' service in Norfolk Island
as surgeon's assistant and superintendent of convicts obtained
important appointments at Sydney. He was the father of William
Charles Wentworth, who in later years played a prominent part in
the political life of the colony.</p>
<p>At the close of 1790 the loss of population caused by death
and desertion in the settlements at Sydney and Parramatta was
reckoned up by Collins. It amounted to one hundred and fifty-nine
souls. During the twelve months the only deaths from sickness
among the free population were those of two seamen and one
soldier; while of the convict class, one hundred and twenty-three
men, seven women, and ten children died. Most of these had
arrived by the vessels of the Second Fleet, and many of them were
in a dying state when they landed. The despatches show that fifty
died in less than three weeks after their arrival. The rest of
the people, notwithstanding the privations they suffered, seem to
have kept their health.<br>

"The Governor called it Par-ra-mat-ta, being the name by which
the natives distinguished the part of the country on which the
town stood."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 165. At this distance of
time it is very difficult to say with certainty the origin and
meaning of the native name Parramatta. Bennett, Australian
Discovery and Colonisation, p. 125, states that it means the
"place of eels". The Hon. Richard Hill, M.L.C., who for many
years has been recognised as an authority on the habits and
language of the natives, states that he remembers having heard
many years ago from the old blackfellows that this was the
meaning of the word. When the distribution of blankets was made
to the blacks at Windsor on 24th May, 1894, the Hon. W. Walker,
M.L.C., who for many years has resided in that district, kindly
made inquiries, at the request of the Editor, amongst the oldest
of the natives, whose dialect corresponds with that of the Port
Jackson and Parramatta natives. One very old but intelligent
native informed him that the word "Para" meant eels; and that the
name arose from the fact of a great number of eels having been
once killed in the river there. On the other hand, we have the
statement of Mrs. Macarthur, writing from Parramatta in the year
1795, that the name signified "the head of a
river".&mdash;Historical Records, vol. ii, p. 509. Many old
residents allege that the word signifies the "meeting of the
waters", and point to the fact that where the town now stands the
river originally ran over a ledge of rock; the water above being
quite fresh, and that below brackish. The weight of evidence and
the well-known practice of the natives of distinguishing
localities by the class of food to be obtained there, appear to
point to the first-mentioned translation as the true one.
Instances of the practice alluded to might be cited in great
numbers. The spot on which Newcastle now stands was called by the
natives "Mulubinba", from an indigenous fern named "Mulubin".
which was found there. The island at the entrance of Lake
Macquarie they called "Niritiba"; it being a favourite resort of
the "Niriti" or "mutton-bird".&mdash;Fraser's Edition of
Threlkeld's Australian Language, pp. 51, 52.</p>

Collins, in his Account of New South Wales (vol. i, pp. 125,
126), gives a fuller description of the plan than that contained
in Phillip's despatch:&mdash;"There also [Rose Hill] the
Governor, in the course of the month, laid down the lines of a
regular town. The principal street was marked out to extend one
mile, commencing near the landing-place, and running in a
direction west, to the toot of the rising ground named Rose Hill,
and in which his Excellency purposed to erect a small house for
his own residence whenever he should visit that settlement. On
each side of this street, whose width was to be two hundred and
five feet, huts were to be erected capable of containing ten
persons each, and at the distance of sixty feet one from the
other; and garden-ground for each hut was allotted in the rear.
As the huts were to be built of such combustible materials as
wattles and plaster, and to be covered with thatch, the width of
the street, and the distance they were placed from each other,
operated as an useful precaution against fire; and by beginning
on so wide a scale the inhabitants of the town at some future day
would possess their own accommodations and comforts more readily,
each upon his own allotment, than if crowded into a small
space."</p>

Phillip was of opinion that the colony could not be in a secure
position unless enough provisions to last for two years were
always in stock, and be provided store-room accordingly. The
buildings in his time, however, were never filled. With regard to
the storehouse, Collins writes (vol. i, p. 137):&mdash;"The
Governor proposing [September, 1790] to erect a capacious
storehouse and a range of barracks at Rose Hill, a convict who
understood the business of brickmaking was sent up for the
purpose of manufacturing a quantity sufficient for those
buildings, a vein of clay having been found which it was supposed
would burn into good bricks. A very convenient wharf and
landing-place were made at that settlement, and twenty-seven huts
were in great forwardness at the end of that month."</p>

According to Collins (vol. i, p. 131), a small party of soldiers
was sent on board the Neptune, under the command of Lieutenant
Long, of the marines, who had been appointed by the Governor,
after the arrival of the first detachment of the New South Wales
Corps, to do the duty of town adjutant. The result of the search
was the discovery of one man and one woman. "The man was one who
had just arrived in the colony, and being soon tired of his
situation, had prevailed on some of the people to secrete him
among the firewood which they had taken on board. In the night
another person swam off to the ship, and was received by the
guard. He pleaded being a free man, but as he had taken a very
improper mode of quitting the colony, he was, by order of the
Governor, punished the day following, together with the convict
who had been found concealed among the firewood."</p>

Collins (vol. i, p. 425) gives the following account of the
discovery:&mdash;"The Providence met with very bad weather on her
passage from the Brazil coast, and was driven past this harbour
as far to the northward as Port Stephens, in which she anchored.
There, to the great surprise of Captain Broughton, he found and
received on board four white people, (if four miserable, naked,
dirty, and smoak-dried men could be called white) runaways from
this settlement. . . . Four of these people (Joseph Sutton having
died) were now met with in this harbour by the officers of the
Providence, and brought back to the colony. They told a
melancholy tale of their sufferings in the boat; and for many
days after their arrival passed their time in detailing to the
crowds, both of black and white people which attended them, their
adventures in Port Stephens, the first harbour they made. Having
lived like the savages, among whom they dwelt, their change of
food soon disagreed with them, and they were all taken ill,
appearing to be principally affected with abdominal swellings.
They spoke in high terms of the pacific disposition and gentle
manners of the natives. They were at some distance inland when
Mr. Grimes was in Port Stephens; but heard soon after of the
schooner's visit, and well knew, and often afterwards saw, the
man who had been fired at, but not killed at that time, as was
supposed by Wilson. Each of them had had names given him, and
given with several ceremonies. Wives also were allotted them, and
one or two had children."</p>

<h3>9. SETTLERS ON THE SOIL.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>WHEN</small> Phillip left England he was directed to
turn his attention, immediately upon landing, to the cultivation
of the soil. The difficulties which confronted him in attempting
to comply with this order have already been alluded to. They
arose, in part, from the nature of the undertaking, but
principally from the imperfect manner in which the expedition had
been equipped. Great as these difficulties were, Phillip, from
the outset, maintained that they would disappear with the
introduction of suitable settlers; and as soon as an opportunity
offered he determined to prove whether industrious farmers could,
within a reasonable time, support themselves by their own
exertions on the produce of the land.</p>
<p>In November, 1789, the opportunity he was waiting for
presented itself. Several of the convicts claimed that they had
served a large part of their sentences in England, on the hulks
or elsewhere, before their embarkation, and that they were, soon
after their arrival, entitled to their liberty. Amongst these was
a young farmer from Cornwall, named James Ruse, who had been
sentenced at the Bodmin Assizes of July, 1782, to seven years'
transportation, and who had been distinguished for his diligence
and good behaviour. The authorities having omitted to furnish
Phillip with a statement of the dates on which the convicts'
sentences expired, he placed Ruse&mdash;pending the receipt of
the papers from England&mdash;upon an acre of cleared and
prepared land on the right bank of the Parramatta River, where
the town now stands. A hut was built for him; seeds, implements
of agriculture, and a small quantity of live stock were provided;
and he was allowed clothing and provisions for twelve months from
the public store. As a spur to his industry, he was promised that
if he behaved well he would receive a grant of thirty acres on
the site where his hut stood.</p>
<p>An opinion had been freely expressed by the military-officers,
and, according to Collins, was "pretty freely disseminated", that
the land in the colony would not return an equivalent to the
labour expended in cultivating it. Notwithstanding this, Ruse
gladly accepted the conditions, telling the Governor that if one
acre more was cleared for him he should be able to support
himself after January, 1791.</p>
<p>Phillip doubted whether the man would be so successful as he
anticipated, but thought that he would "do tolerably well" after
he had been supported from the public store for eighteen months.
Ruse, however, was as good as his word. In November, 1790, when
he had been twelve months on his farm. Tench interviewed him
concerning his antecedents and the progress he had then made. He
had at that time an acre and a half in "bearded wheat", half an
acre in maize, and a small kitchen-garden. The wheat, which, he
expected to go about eight bushels to the acre, was sown in May
and June, the maize in August and September. Ruse gave the
following description of his method of preparing the
ground:&mdash;"Having burnt the fallen timber off the ground, I
dug in the ashes, and then hoed it, never doing more than eight,
or perhaps nine rods in a day, by which means, it was not like
the Government farm, just scratched over, but properly done; then
I clod-moulded it, and dug in the grass and weeds&mdash;this, I
think, almost equal to ploughing. I then let it lie as long as I
could, exposed to air and sun; and just before I sowed my seed,
turned it all up afresh. . . . The greatest check upon me is the
dishonesty of the convicts, who, in spite of all my vigilance,
rob me almost every night." Ruse mentioned that he had been "bred
a husbandman, near Launcester (sic), in Cornwall." <a href=

<p>Although only an acre and a half of cleared land were placed
at his disposal, instead of two acres, he was in an independent
position by the 25th February, 1791, "when he declined receiving
any further support, being then able to maintain himself." In the
meantime he had taken a wife, and a child had been born to him,
both of whom, Phillip reported, "he wishes to take off the store
next Christmas". <a href="#note-300" name="noteref-300" id=
"noteref-300">{2}</a></p>
<p>Ruse had fairly earned his reward, <a href="#note-301" name=
"noteref-301" id="noteref-301">{3}</a> and on the 22nd February,
1790, Phillip signed the first land grant executed in Australia,
making Ruse the proprietor of thirty acres of land. The
allotment, which was situated on the south of the "Ponds", at
Parramatta, was named "Experiment Farm" in the grant, which thus
became a record of the success which had attended Phillip's first
effort in land settlement.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the grant can still be traced. The farm
faced a small tributary to the Parramatta River, known as Clay
Cliff Creek. It now forms a part of Anderson Ward, in the Borough
of Parramatta, and lies about twelve chains in a southerly
direction from the public wharf at the foot of George-street: it
is bounded on the west side by Harris-street, on the south by
Brisbane-street, and on the east by Elizabeth-street. The land
was sold by Ruse to Dr. Harris, of the New South Wales Corps, by
whom a cottage, which still stands, was built upon it, and called
"Experiment Cottage", a name it still bears. The part of the land
which Ruse first tilled is now a large vegetable-garden,
cultivated by Chinese. The accompanying facsimile is from the
original document, <a href="#note-302" name="noteref-302" id=
"noteref-302">{4}</a> which is still in existence. A conveyance
to Dr. Harris is endorsed on the back of the original grant.</p>
<p>A few years afterwards (1794) Ruse obtained another grant of
thirty acres of land, "situate on the east side of the river
Hawkesbury, in the district of Mulgrave Place". The land was
named in the grant "Ruse Farm". <a href="#note-303" name=

<br>
<p>It had thus been demonstrated that an industrious man with a
little assistance, could maintain himself on the land after a
year and a half, or less; and eighteen month was adopted as the
time for which settlers should be supported from the public
store. The experiment had succeeded beyond expectation, but the
advantages arising from it were not immediately apparent. The
land was capable of supporting an army of industrious settlers,
but the large body of cultivators Phillip wished to see in
possession was conspicuous by its absence. There was no
immigration of free men, and neither the marines whose term of
service was about to expire, nor the convicts who had served
their sentences, showed much inclination to go upon the land as
one more than the number stated by Phillip, and of these, fifty
took up land at Norfolk Island, while thirty-seven were placed at
Rose Hill. Phillip was satisfied with the progress which had been
made in settling the marines and convicts on the soil; but
Collins looked at the matter in a different light. According to
his account, the convicts who went on the land at this time
formed only a small number of those whose sentences had expired.
He speaks also of an alternative proposal, not referred to in the
despatches, by which convicts who did not care to become settlers
were to work for twelve or eighteen months after their time of
sentence was over:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The convicts whose terms of transportation had
expired were now [July, 1791] collected, and by the authority of
the Governor informed that such of them as wished to become
settlers in this country should receive every encouragement; that
those who did not, were to labour for their provisions,
stipulating to work for twelve or eighteen months certain; and
that in the way of such as preferred returning to England no
obstacles would be thrown, provided they could procure passages
from the masters of such ships as might arrive; but that they
were not to expect any assistance on the part of the Governor to
that end. The wish to return to their friends appeared to be the
prevailing idea, a few only giving in their names as settlers,
and none engaging to work for a certain time." <a href=
"#note-304" name="noteref-304" id=
"noteref-304">{6}</a></blockquote>
<p>Phillip pointed out this difficulty in his despatch of 5th
November, but he did not say in so many words that the
ex-convicts had refused to bind themselves to work for the
Government. Those who could make themselves useful at sea would,
he foresaw, be carried away by the transports, but by far the
greater number "must remain, discontented, and desirous of
seizing the first opportunity which offers of escaping." Phillip
improved the occasion by suggesting that if settlers with means
were sent out they would be able to offer employment to the
people under conditions that would make them content to remain in
the colony.</p>
<p>It was some years before free settlers from England were
obtained, and in the meanwhile the difficulty had to be met in
the best way possible. If the Governor was dissatisfied, so were
the convicts whose sentences had expired. They stood in a
peculiar position. If they chose to remain in the colony as
settlers, they were well treated; they received free grants of
land and support from the Government for a sufficient length of
time to enable them to become independent; but if they refused
these terms, and made up their minds to leave the settlement,
they received no aid whatever. Unless they had money, or were
able to give services in exchange for a passage, they were
helpless. They must remain in the colony, and work either on
their own account or for the Government, under conditions similar
to those which had proved so distasteful to them during their
time of compulsory servitude. If they declined to work, they had
no alternative but to steal or starve.</p>
<p>Phillip does not state at what time the settlers who followed
Ruse were placed on the land, but the return of 5th November,
1791, shows that the majority of those who accepted the
conditions <a href="#note-305" name="noteref-305" id=
"noteref-305">{7}</a> offered by Government had taken possession
of their holdings in the months of July and August, 1791. Three
became settlers as early as 30th March, while ten received grants
at Norfolk Island on the 5th April. According to Collins, the
greater number of ex-convicts were settled in the month of
August. Twelve were placed on land at the foot of Prospect Hill,
near the site of the reservoir which now constitutes the chief
water supply of Sydney; while fifteen were put in possession of
farms at a place on the northern bank of the Parramatta River,
long known as "The Ponds". <a href="#note-306" name="noteref-306"
id="noteref-306">{8}</a> The name has fallen into desuetude. The
locality is now known, part of it, as Rydalmere, and the other
part as Ermington. The relative positions of these first land
grants can be seen from the accompanying map of the part of the
County of Cumberland adjacent to Parramatta and Prospect Hill.
The map <a href="#note-307" name="noteref-307" id=
"noteref-307">{9}</a> is complete with the exception of two
grants which cannot be located. These were probably given to the
two settlers to whom Collins refers <a href="#note-308" name=
"noteref-308" id="noteref-308">{10}</a> as having been deprived
of their grants for non-fulfilment of the condition which
required <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> cultivation. The results were not
at first very encouraging. The settlers who honestly endeavoured
to do their best with the land, and were content to live
frugally, soon found themselves on the road to prosperity, but
those who were not industrious became tired of the life before
they had given it a fair trial. Some of them wished to give up
their land almost as soon as they had acquired it; others sold
their live stock to procure luxuries, and thus deprived
themselves of a valuable aid to success. Phillip reported to
Dundas on the 19th March, 1792, that not only had several of the
settlers who had been placed upon the land acted in this way, but
that he had, in addition, "just received an account of twenty-two
men and nine women who are received an board that ship [the Pitt]
the terms for which they had been sentenced being expired. Thus
will the best people always be carried away, for those who cannot
be received on board the ships as seamen or carpenters pay for
their passage." <a href="#note-309" name="noteref-309" id=

<b>8. Plan of Old Land Grants at and near Parramatta</b></p>
<br>
<p>During the latter end of 1790 and the commencement of 1791 as
much progress was made with the cultivation of the land by the
convicts on the public account as the circumstances would permit.
The conditions were not favourable. With debilitated and ill-fed
men as labourers, the clearing of the ground could only proceed
slowly, while the prolonged dry weather rendered it impossible to
put any seed in the ground until June, when a little rain fell.
But the drought did not break up until August, and Phillip had to
report in November that, although the crops looked better than
there had been reason to expect, they had suffered very much from
the seed having lain so long in the ground before it vegetated.
<a href="#note-310" name="noteref-310" id=
"noteref-310">{12}</a></p>
<p>What progress had been made by the settlers towards the end of
the year is shown by the return of land under cultivation at
Parramatta in November, 1791. <a href="#note-311" name=
"noteref-311" id="noteref-311">{13}</a> The total area cleared
was 921 acres; but of this 288&frac12; acres had not been sown.
The remaining 632&frac12; acres included 90&frac12; acres of
garden-ground, leaving 542 acres actually under cultivation. Of
this. 405 acres belonged to Government, 92 to settlers, and 45 to
servants of the Crown. Of the 288&frac12; acres which had not
been sown, 134 were used as cattle-enclosures, in which the
timber had been thinned, but the surface of the ground had not
been disturbed; <a href="#note-312" name="noteref-312" id=
"noteref-312">{14}</a> the remaining 154&frac12; acres were ready
to receive the seed, and therefore might be properly described as
"in cultivation". There was thus actually under cultivation an
area of 787 acres.</p>
<p>The settlers, of whom thirty-seven had been put in possession
of lots at Parramatta, thus held on an average about 2&frac12;
acres of cultivated land each. The greater number, however, had
only had their land for a few months. Of the 405 acres belonging
to Government, 351&frac12; were in maize, 44&frac14; in wheat,
6&frac14; in barley, 2 in potatoes, and 1 in oats. The yield from
this was as follows:&mdash;Maize, 4,844&frac12; bushels; <a href=
"#note-313" name="noteref-313" id="noteref-313">{15}</a> wheat,
638 bushels; barley, 59 bushels. <a href="#note-314" name=
"noteref-314" id="noteref-314">{16}</a> The other produce
(barley, [sic.] potatoes, and oats) was not recorded. Of the
4,844&frac12; bushels of maize, 2,649&frac12; were issued as
bread for the colony, 695 bushels had been reserved for seed "and
other purposes", while not less than 1,500 bushels had been
stolen from the grounds. <a href="#note-315" name="noteref-315"
id="noteref-315">{17}</a> Three hundred and eighty-three bushels
of the wheat were sown for the next harvest, while 255 were
issued in lieu of bread. The whole of the 59 bushels of barley
seems to have been reserved for seed. In October, 1792, Phillip
informed the Secretary of State of the progress made in the
settlement of the soil during the preceding eleven months. The
number of settlers at Parramatta to whom lands had been granted
had increased from 37 to 65, of whom 53 had been convicts.
<a href="#note-316" name="noteref-316" id="noteref-316">{18}</a>
The area of ground under cultivation on the public account had
increased from 405 to 1,000 acres; that in possession of the
settlers from 92 to 416 acres; and the gardens from 90&frac12; to
100 acres; making in all 1,516 acres. The settlers had, in
addition, 97 acres of ground cleared of timber. It will be
observed that the average area of ground under cultivation by
each settler had been more than doubled in eleven months.
Four-fifths of the Government ground were sown with maize, the
remainder with wheat and barley. <a href="#note-317" name=
"noteref-317" id="noteref-317">{19}</a> The cultivated land was
situated at Parramatta and Toongabbie, or "Toon-gab-be", as
Phillip spells the native name, which he adopted as he had done
in the case of Parramatta. In the neighbourhood of this place
there were, according to Phillip, "several thousand acres of
exceeding good ground".</p>
<p>A word may be said here as to the quality of the land on which
the first settlers were placed. The success which attended
Captain Macarthur's efforts at Elizabeth Farm <a href="#note-318"
name="noteref-318" id="noteref-318">{20}</a> a few years later,
and the profitable use to which some of the land is put at the
present day, shew that the soil, if not unusually rich, was at
least fairly good. But in Phillip's time, as already pointed out,
an idea was very generally entertained that the land was
worthless&mdash;that it would produce next to nothing, and, in
short, was incapable of supporting life. Reports of this nature
reached England, and Phillip hearing of them took an opportunity
of presenting the other side of the case. He did not pretend to
be an expert, but he made use of the first one he could lay his
hands upon. This was Mr. David Burton, a superintendent who was
sent out in the Gorgon. <a href="#note-319" name="noteref-319"
id="noteref-319">{21}</a> He had been brought up as a gardener,
and knew good land when he saw it. Phillip instructed him to
report on the soil at Parramatta and Toongabbie, and he was
particularly directed not to overrate the value of the land.
<a href="#note-320" name="noteref-320" id="noteref-320">{22}</a>
His report <a href="#note-321" name="noteref-321" id=
"noteref-321">{23}</a> was of a very favourable character. It
stated that the land, as a rule, was good, and that all the
settlers seemed to be in a fair way to success, excepting two at
Prospect Hill and three at The Ponds, who complained that their
land was bad; but Mr. Burton, having inquired into these cases,
came to the conclusion that want of success was owing not to the
sterility of the soil, but to other causes, for which the
cultivators were responsible. <a href="#note-322" name=
"noteref-322" id="noteref-322">{24}</a></p>
<p>The results of Phillip's efforts in the settlement and
cultivation of the land were, so far, not of great magnitude, and
they were probably disappointing to the English authorities who
expected more than could be attained under such unfavourable
circumstances. The difficulties that had been encountered, and
had still to be met, were of an extraordinary character. Convicts
had been poured into the country. Even if they had landed in good
health, want of food and the absence of men capable of directing
their labours in the field would have made their successful
employment as cultivators of the soil an impossibility. But in
addition to these obstacles, the settlement suffered from a
drought of great severity, which lasted for more than a year.
These disadvantages were set forth in Phillip's despatch to
Grenville of the 15th December, 1791:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I must beg your Lordship's permission to
refer&mdash;for those causes which have prevented the colony's
being in the situation I expected, and which I have no doubt but
that it would otherwise have been in&mdash;to those parts of my
letters in which I have pointed out the loss of the man on whom I
placed great dependence, and who was charged with directing the
labour of all the convicts employed in agriculture; the very long
drought; the reduced ration, and which, when not so very low as
to render the people incapable of labour, serves as a too
well-founded excuse for their doing but very little work, and
must be always attended with great discontent amongst such
people; the miserable state in which two large bodies of convicts
have been landed, who are a burthen to the colony, and who, when
they regain their health, are not in general calculated for hard
labour; and the want of a proper person to be charged with the
cultivation of the ground, and to have the direction of the
convicts who are employed in agriculture. If I have too often
adverted to this subject, I trust that the cause will excuse me
to your Lordships, and for observing that it now only wants one
month of four years since I first landed in this settlement,
during which time all the public live stock which has been
received is not more than what would be necessary for one good
farm, nor has that been received till within these three
months."</blockquote>
<p>The allusion made to the live stock pointed to a conspicuous
defect in the arrangements which were made for founding and
maintaining the colony. The necessity of stocking the country was
as apparent to the authorities of the Home Department as it was
to Phillip, but the means taken to supply the want were
ludicrously inadequate. The defect was aggravated by the
mortality which took place among the animals that were placed on
board the ships, and by the loss of the whole of the Guardian's
shipment; but accidents at sea were to be expected, and allowance
should have been made for them. If all the live stock shipped
during the first three or four years had been landed at Port
Jackson in safety, it would have been insufficient for the
purpose for which it was intended; but what with accidents at
sea, and losses on land, the live stock in the colony when
Phillip wrote his despatch in December, 1791, nearly four years
after its establishment, was not enough, as he forcibly expressed
it, "for one good farm", and most of it had been received during
the last few months, viz., that brought from the Cape in the
Gorgon by Lieutenant-Governor King.</p>
<p>The loss of the Guardian seems to have paralysed the Home
Department, for although the importance of introducing live stock
was recognised in the despatches sent to Phillip, no measures
were taken to supply the colony for a considerable time
afterwards. The Gorgon was well fitted for carrying sheep and
cattle, but no arrangements were made to employ her in this work,
and, but for the energy and forethought of King, who exceeded his
authority, and ran the risk of being reprimanded for so doing,
she would have arrived at Sydney without a single head. <a href=
"#note-323" name="noteref-323" id="noteref-323">{25}</a> As
Phillip pointed out in writing to Dundas on the 19th March, 1792,
the proper plan would have been to fit out a couple of ships for
the express purpose of conveying live stock from the Cape to Port
Jackson.</p>
<p>It was not until the middle of 1792 that any systematic plan
for stocking the colony with cattle and sheep was considered by
the Home Department, and the arrangement then proposed was of
doubtful value, and certain, whatever happened, to cause delay.
The Government had been for some time in correspondence with the
authorities at Calcutta, with the view of obtaining regular
supplies of provisions for the settlement from that place, and it
was proposed to obtain live stock also from India. Dundas wrote
to this effect to Phillip on the 15th May, 1792, <a href=
"#note-324" name="noteref-324" id="noteref-324">{26}</a> and
followed up the subject in a despatch of two months' later date,
14th July, 1792, <a href="#note-325" name="noteref-325" id=
"noteref-325">{27}</a> in which he said:&mdash;I have some hopes
that you may receive a few sheep or horned cattle, or both, by
the Royal Admiral from the Cape. At the same time, as I observed
in my last, it is to Bengal that I chiefly look for an efficient
supply of that nature." He therefore recommended Phillip to send
the transport D&aelig;dalus to Calcutta for a shipment of stock.
This vessel, as Phillip had been informed by Dundas, in a
despatch written in July of the previous year, <a href=
"#note-326" name="noteref-326" id="noteref-326">{28}</a> had been
sent to the north-west coast of America, to convey stores for the
ships Discovery and Chatham, which were pursuing a voyage of
exploration and survey, under Captain Vancouver; and after the
performance of that service she was to sail for Sydney, where she
was expected to arrive early in 1793, her commander, Lieutenant
Hanson, having instructions to place himself under the orders of
Governor Phillip, either "for going to Calcutta or elsewhere for
the purpose of procuring supplies". To save time, instructions
were given to Vancouver to put some live stock on board the
D&aelig;dalus at Nootka or the Sandwich Islands. <a href=
"#note-327" name="noteref-327" id="noteref-327">{29}</a> For some
reason which is not explained, Vancouver did not carry out this
arrangement. He proposed to procure breeding cattle and sheep
from the Spanish ports on the south parts of the coast of New
Albion; <a href="#note-328" name="noteref-328" id=
"noteref-328">{30}</a> because that country, like New South
Wales, was but "slightly cultivated" and the stock reared under
those conditions had "succeeded to a very high degree, with
scarce the smallest care and attention". <a href="#note-329"
name="noteref-329" id="noteref-329">{31}</a> Twelve cows and six
bulls, with an equal number of male and female sheep", were
accordingly shipped onboard the D&aelig;dalus at Monterey.
<a href="#note-330" name="noteref-330" id="noteref-330">{32}</a>
With the exception of some hogs, one calf, and four sheep, none
of them survived the passage. The despatch from Dundas giving
instructions to the Governor to send the D&aelig;dalus to India
for live stock came into Grose's hands shortly before the arrival
of the D&aelig;dalus, and having doubts as to her safety, he made
arrangements to carry out the instructions in another way. In
April, 1793, he contracted with the master of the storeship Shah
Hormuzear to proceed to Calcutta and bring back one hundred head
of cattle. <a href="#note-331" name="noteref-331" id=
"noteref-331">{33}</a></p>
<p>When the D&aelig;dalus arrived, the day after the despatch in
which Grose informed Dundas of the hire of the Shah Hormuzear was
written, Grose feared that he had been too precipitate; he must,
however, have felt relief when he learned how destructive to the
live stock the voyage of the D&aelig;dalus had been. The Shah
Hormuzear did not return; in her place the Neptune was fitted and
loaded with cattle and provisions, but was wrecked shortly after
leaving Bombay; and it was not until 31st May, 1795, that the
Endeavour entered Sydney Harbour with the live stock for which
Grose had contracted in April, 1793. One hundred and sixty-two
head of cattle were safely landed, but about twenty died shortly
after. <a href="#note-332" name="noteref-332" id=
"noteref-332">{34}</a> The D&aelig;dalus was to have brought
stores as well as live stock for the settlement, but when she
arrived it was found that Vancouver, instead of being in a
position to send provisions, was himself in want of supplies. As
it happened, Grose was able to furnish almost everything that he
required.</p>
<p>India, which was regarded by the Government of the day as the
best place to go to, both for live stock and provisions, failed
at first in both respects. The breed of cattle which thrived
there was small, and the provisions and clothing produced were
found, as a rule, to be of inferior quality. Some time before
Dundas's despatch of 16th July, 1792, reached Phillip, the
Atlantic, which had been sent to Calcutta for supplies, returned
to Port Jackson, bringing, in addition to a cargo of provisions,
a few head of cattle, sheep, and goats. The live stock was not
more successful than the provisions, which Phillip reported to be
"very inferior to those of a similar nature which are furnished
from Europe". Only a few head were shipped, and a large
proportion perished. Of two bulls, one cow, one calf, two rams,
eighteen ewes, and twenty goats purchased at Calcutta, one calf,
eight ewes, and thirteen goats died on the voyage; the only cow
received from Calcutta was very weak when she landed, and was
soon afterwards lost by falling into the water. As the bulls were
of the buffalo breed, while the cows in the settlement were of
the European breed, these animals were of little value.
Afterwards, however, provisions of good quality were obtained
from India, while the sheep sheep sent from Bengal, though small,
were prized because of their productiveness.</p>

settler in this country, who had been upon his ground about
fifteen months, having got in his crop of corn, declared himself
desirous of relinquishing his claim to any further provisions

As no detailed survey of the country had been made, the
boundaries of the early grants could not be accurately defined.
The insertion in the grants of specific names was of use,
therefore, as affording a means by which the land could be
identified. Phillip Schaffer's grant, bearing the same date as
that given to Ruse, was for 140 acres, "to be known by the name
of The Vineyard laying on the north side of the creek leading to
Parramatta". Similarly, the thirty acres of land granted by Grose
to Charles Williams on the Hawkesbury in 1794 was "to be known by
the name of Williams's Farm". Schaffer was one of the
superintendents sent out by the Guardian. In the official list he
is thus described, "Phillip Schaffer, formerly a lieutenant in
one of the Hessian Corps which served in America, has been
accustomed to farming." According to Phillip, "he was not
calculated for the employment for which he came out, but as a
settler will be a useful man."&mdash;Historical Records, vol. i,
part 2, p. 536. Collins says that Schaffer did not know enough of
the English language to qualify him for the position of
superintendent.</p>

"The Governor had now [August, 1791] chosen situations for his
settlers and fixed them in their different allotments. Twelve
convicts, whose terms of transportation had expired, he placed on
a range of farms at the foot of a hill, named Prospect Hill,

"During this month [June, 1791] some rain had fallen, which had
encouraged the sowing of the public grounds, and one hundred and
sixteen bushels of wheat were sown at Parramatta. Until these
rains fell, the ground was so dry, hard, and literally burnt up,
that it was almost impossible to break it with a hoe, and until
this time there had been no hope or probability of the grain
vegetating."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 166. "In addition to the
quantity of ground sown with wheat, a large proportion was
cleared to be sown this season with Indian corn; and the country
about Parramatta, as well as the town itself, where eight huts
were now built, wore a very promising appearance. At Sydney, the
little ground that was in cultivation belonged to individuals;
the whole labour of the convicts employed in clearing ground
being exerted at Parramatta, where the soil, though not the best
for the purposes of agriculture (according to the opinion of
every man who possessed any knowledge of farming) was still
better than the sand about Sydney, where, to raise even a cabbage
after the first crop, manure was absolutely
requisite."&mdash;Ib., p. 167. An obvious printer's error occurs
in this passage of Collins's work. He gives the number of huts at
Parramatta as eight, whereas Tench, who visited the town some
months before, states that about fifty huts were then finished,
and more were in course of erection. There is other evidence to
indicate that "eight" is a misprint for "eighty".</p>

The object of the enclosure was to prevent the live stock
straying away and being lost in the bush. Soon after the arrival
of the First Fleet, four cows and two bulls, the only horned
cattle the settlement possessed, strayed away. They were not
heard of again until November, 1795, when they were discovered on
the banks of the Nepean. They had by this time increased to a
herd.&mdash;Vol. i, pp. 306, 311, 312, 393, "At the commencement

Phillip explains that the convicts stole the grain because they
were pressed by hunger. Several of them died from eating maize in
its crude state when carrying the grain to the public granary. He

cultivation agrees very closely with the report of the
Surveyor-General, dated 16th October, a fortnight later than the
despatch. According to this report, printed by Collins (vol. i,
p. 248, 249), the ground "in cultivation" comprised 1,703 acres,
but of this area there were 162&frac12; acres which had been
cleared only. This reduced the area of cultivated land to
1,540&frac12; acres, showing only a trifling increase on the area
reported by Phillip in his despatch. The return will be found in

<h3>10. THE THIRD FLEET.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>FROM</small> the despatches brought by the vessels of
the Second Fleet, Phillip learned with dismay that a thousand
more convicts were about to be sent out, and he was directed to
make preparations for their reception. For some reason which does
not appear (probably a difficulty in obtaining transports), the
hulks and gaols in England and Ireland were not "cleared" until
the early part of 1791, when upwards of two thousand convicts,
instead of one thousand, were despatched to Sydney. Writing on
the 16th November, 1790, <a href="#note-333" name="noteref-333"
id="noteref-333">{1}</a> Grenville informed Phillip that orders
had been given to engage a number of vessels which would
accommodate at least 1,800 convicts; but in a despatch of later
date (19th February, 1791), <a href="#note-334" name=
"noteref-334" id="noteref-334">{2}</a> it was stated that the
number had been "increased by clearing the gaols in Ireland to
about 2,050". This large number of convicts was sent out in ten
vessels, provided by Messrs. Camden, Calvert, and King, under
contract with the Commissioners of the Navy. The transports were
the Queen (which brought 200 convicts from Ireland), Atlantic,
<a href="#note-335" name="noteref-335" id="noteref-335">{3}</a>
William and Ann, Britannia, Matilda, Salamander, Albemarle, Mary
Ann, Admiral Barrington, and Active. At the same time the Gorgon
man-of-war, which had been used as a reception-ship for convicts
in 1787, <a href="#note-336" name="noteref-336" id=
"noteref-336">{4}</a> was got ready for the purpose of conveying
stores and a few convicts to New South Wales. King, who had been
appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island, had a passage in
this vessel, and the action he took on the voyage in purchasing
live stock at the Cape was not without importance to the
colony.</p>

<br>
<b>9.(ii) Weatherhead's Chart of Jervis Bay.</b></p>
<br>
<p>All the transports arrived in safety, but in the case of one
of them, the Albemarle, not without an adventure. On the 9th
April, in latitude 44&deg; 30' north, longitude 15&deg; 20' west,
a number of the convicts made an attempt to seize the vessel, but
it was frustrated by the vigorous action of the master, George
Bowen, who seized his blunderbuss and shot the leader in the
shoulder. The man fled, and the other mutineers following his
example, Bowen was left in possession of the deck. He at once
mustered all hands, and sent a search party below for the
mutineers, who were easily secured. A sort of informal
Court-martial was held on the spot, in which the naval agent,
Lieutenant Robert Parry Young, took part, the result of which was
that two of the men who had instigated the mutiny, one of them
being the man wounded by Bowen, were immediately hanged at the
fore-yard-arm. <a href="#note-337" name="noteref-337" id=
"noteref-337">{5}</a></p>
<p>The arrival of the transports was spread over a period of
three months. The Mary Ann entered the port on the 9th July, and
the Admiral Barrington on the 16th October. According to
Phillip's despatch of the 5th November, 1791, <a href="#note-338"
name="noteref-338" id="noteref-338">{6}</a> there were shipped on
board these vessels 2,061 male and female convicts, while only
1,863 were landed; 194 men and 4 women, nearly one-tenth of the
gross number, having died on the voyage. A great many were landed
sick, and others became ill shortly after their arrival. The
chief surgeon's report, dated several weeks after the arrival of
the last ship, was to this effect:&mdash;"Under medical treatment
and incapable of labour, 626&mdash;576 of whom are those landed
from the last ships". <a href="#note-339" name="noteref-339" id=
"noteref-339">{7}</a> It is obvious from these facts that abuses
such as marked the conduct of affairs on board the vessels of the
Second Fleet were not absent from the ships of the Third Fleet,
although the consequences in the latter case were not so
disastrous. If any doubt existed as to the cause of the great
mortality and the unsatisfactory condition of the convicts who
survived, it would be removed by the knowledge that while some of
the vessels lost large numbers of prisoners and came into port
with a heavy sick-list, in other cases the loss of life was
small, and the convicts arrived in good health. The inference to
be drawn from these facts is that the sickness and death arose
from preventible causes&mdash;in other words, from the treatment
which the convicts received on the voyage.</p>
<p>Phillip gives no details concerning the ships and their
passengers; but in Collins's book each vessel is alluded to
separately. The Mary Ann's passengers (women) were "all very
healthy" when they arrived, and spoke highly of the treatment
they had received from the master of the vessel. There were very
few deaths on the Albemarle and the Britannia, which landed their
convicts in a healthy state. On the Salamander and the William
and Ann there had been five and seven deaths respectively, while
the former had only one and the latter five sick. In the case of
the other five transports the mortality had been heavy, and they
brought a number of sick convicts into port. Collins briefly
describes their condition as "unhealthy". The worst case was that
of the Admiral Barrington. This vessel took on board one hundred
and twenty-nine convicts, of whom thirty-six, or more than
one-fourth, died on the voyage, while eighty-four were brought in
sick. So that of the whole number embarked on this vessel only
nine escaped either sickness or death. It is impossible to
believe that this wholesale loss of life and general sickness
could have taken place if the convicts had been properly cared
for. In one case, that of the Matilda, there appears to have been
a special reason for a high death-rate and a heavy sick-list. Her
convicts for the most part were old and infirm. <a href=
"#note-340" name="noteref-340" id="noteref-340">{8}</a> The
sufferings of these unfortunate people can be easily imagined.
The voyage to Australia in those days, under close confinement
and unhealthy conditions, could hardly but prove fatal to such
men when it tried the constitutions of the young and robust.</p>
<p>That the convicts in some cases had not received fair
treatment was apparent to other people besides Collins. When
reporting the arrival of the Third Fleet, Phillip described to
Grenville, in forcible terms, the condition which the majority of
the convicts were in when landed. Many of them, he declared,
would never recover their strength. The "greatest part" were so
emaciated by long confinement, or want of food, that for many
months they would be a "dead-weight on the stores". <a href=
"#note-341" name="noteref-341" id="noteref-341">{9}</a> Both
these causes of sickness and death were preventible. Confinement,
to a certain degree, was necessary; but if those who had charge
of the vessels had taken any trouble in the matter, it would have
been easy enough to have given the convicts as much air as would
not only have preserved their lives, but have kept them in
tolerable health. <a href="#note-342" name="noteref-342" id=
"noteref-342">{10}</a> But the convicts seem to have been
regarded by the masters of transports as worthless beings, whose
health did not demand a thought, and who were better dead than
alive. The want of food could only have been caused by the
default of those who had charge of them. In regard to two vessels
of the Third Fleet, complaints were made that provisions had been
withheld; but as nothing was said on the point with respect to
the other vessels, it must be assumed that the practice was not
general. The two vessels referred to were the Active and the
Queen. In the latter case an inquiry was made, and the charge
substantiated. <a href="#note-343" name="noteref-343" id=
"noteref-343">{11}</a> It does not appear that any action was
taken with regard to the Active. <a href="#note-344" name=
"noteref-344" id="noteref-344">{12}</a> Out of two hundred and
twenty-two male convicts landed from the Queen in September,
1791, only fifty were alive in May following. <a href="#note-345"
name="noteref-345" id="noteref-345">{13}</a></p>
<p>Phillip, on 19th March, 1792, wrote to Dundas:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am very sorry to say that most of the convicts who
were received by the last ships still continue in the same
debilitated state in which they were landed, and of whom, in less
than seven months, two hundred and eighty-eight men have died. In
the seven months prior to the arrival of those ships the deaths
were nineteen. The returns of sick this day is&mdash;civil and
military, eighteen; male convicts, three hundred and ninety-four;
and females, seventeen." <a href="#note-346" name="noteref-346"
id="noteref-346">{14}</a></blockquote>
<p>Even then the extent of the mischief had not been realised.
The sick convicts continued to droop and die, and by the end of
the year, according to Collins, the death-roll had risen to four
hundred and thirty-six, most of whom arrived by the Third Fleet.
It is apparent, therefore, that of those who landed sick from the
transports comparatively few recovered. Phillip's despatch shows
that most of the sick convicts referred to in the return of 19th
March were those who arrived in the vessels of the Third Fleet,
but the number cannot be stated with exactness.</p>
<p>The mortality which took place among these people is the more
conspicuous from the fact that the losses by death in the other
classes of the community were small. Nearly everyone who wrote
about the colony at that time, from the Governor downwards, spoke
well of the climate; and although they had to live upon food that
was generally insufficient in quantity and inferior in quality,
there was little sickness or death among the free population.</p>
<p>One feature of the case, regarded by Collins as peculiar, is
not perhaps so strange as it appeared to him. He noticed that
many of the sick convicts, instead of gaining health and strength
after exchanging the pestiferous atmosphere of the transports for
the pure air of Sydney and Parramatta, were attacked by
complaints of a dysenteric character, which caused the death of
the weak, and from which the stronger recovered with difficulty.
<a href="#note-347" name="noteref-347" id="noteref-347">{15}</a>
He was disposed to attribute the cause to "change of water", but
while this may have been an element in the case, it is not
probable that it was the chief cause of the great destruction of
life that took place. The most reasonable supposition is that the
systems of the men were so reduced by the sufferings they had
endured during the voyage that they were peculiarly liable to
disease, and incapable of resisting ailments which, under other
circumstances, they might have thrown off. If the "change of
water" had been the cause of the complaints from which they
suffered and died, it is not likely that the military and
civilians who came out in the transports and the man-of-war
Gorgon would have escaped. The more the circumstances are
considered the stronger becomes the conviction that the
ill-health and loss of life that occurred among the convicts of
the Third Fleet after their arrival was mainly caused by the
treatment they received on board the ships.</p>
<p>Phillip's representations to the British Government concerning
the treatment which the convicts had met with on board some of
the vessels of the Third Fleet, although they might very well
have been conveyed in stronger language, were not without effect.
They were strengthened by the report of the magisterial inquiry
which had been held in the case of the Queen, transport. Dundas,
in a despatch of 15th May, 1792, <a href="#note-348" name=
"noteref-348" id="noteref-348">{16}</a> said he should take care
that when the persons concerned in this case returned to England
justice should be done; and he informed Phillip that it was
proposed in the future to employ, both for the transport of
convicts and stores, vessels in the service of the East India
Company, and he trusted that "by this means the evils which have
hitherto subsisted will be put an end to".</p>
<p>The ill-treatment of the convicts on board the transports of
the Third Fleet was not the only ground of complaint against the
masters and owners. Notwithstanding the fact that the vessels had
been chartered at so much per ton for the conveyance of convicts
and stores, a part of the space which should have been occupied
by convicts or utilised for the stowage of stores was
fraudulently taken up by the owners with merchandise which could
be exchanged in China or India for a return cargo.
Lieutenant-Governor King, who was returning to Sydney in the
Gorgon, was the first to report the fact. Writing on the 29th
July, 1791, <a href="#note-349" name="noteref-349" id=
"noteref-349">{17}</a> from the Cape, where the transports had
put in, he told Nepean:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am credibly informed that each transport has
upwards of 200 tons of iron, copper, and lead in them, besides
other articles. I hope Governor Phillip can seize it, as so much
more beef and pork would be acceptable to the
colony."</blockquote>
<p>King did not say where he got his information from, but it was
accurate, so far at least as four of the transports were
concerned. On his arrival in Sydney he communicated what he had
learned to Phillip, who inquired into the matter, and found that
the Admiral Barrington, Albemarle, Active, and Queen "had on
board a very considerable quantity of copper, lead, iron, and
cordage". From Phillip's letter to Grenville of 8th November,
1791, it appears that the masters acknowledged the fact; their
excuse being that it was known before they sailed that the
articles were on board; they had been "received publickly", and
were "intended for a Portuguese settlement in India". <a href=
"#note-350" name="noteref-350" id="noteref-350">{18}</a> The
story was plausible, but Phillip did not believe it, and would
have confiscated the cargo, which was in point of fact
contraband, but he did not think he had authority to do so.
<a href="#note-351" name="noteref-351" id=
"noteref-351">{19}</a></p>
<p>The vessels, it appears, had clearances from the Custom House
for copper, lead, iron, and steel, but Phillip was informed in a
despatch, 15th May, 1792, <a href="#note-352" name="noteref-352"
id="noteref-352">{20}</a> that the articles in question had been
carried out clandestinely, and were therefore to be considered as
belonging to the Navy Board. While Dundas commended Phillip's
caution, he told him that he should have been better satisfied if
a seizure had been made. <a href="#note-353" name="noteref-353"
id="noteref-353">{21}</a></p>
<p>Some of the transports gave trouble in another way. A part of
the stores put on board the Albemarle, Active, and Queen was
intended for Norfolk Island; but when the masters of those
vessels arrived at Sydney they informed the Governor that the
contract made by their owners with the naval authorities did not
go beyond the delivery of their cargoes at Port Jackson. <a href=
"#note-354" name="noteref-354" id="noteref-354">{22}</a> They had
received written instructions to this effect before they left
England, and as Phillip was not in a position to dispute the
point he made the best of things, and chartered the Atlantic,
which took the Norfolk Island stores to that settlement. She also
conveyed thither Lieutenant-Governor King and Captain Paterson,
with part of a company of the New South Wales Corps. The other
portion was taken by the Queen. She brought back Major Ross, who
had acted as Commandant under a Commission from Phillip, and also
a detachment or marines, which was relieved by Captain Paterson's
company. It is stated by Collins that Assistant-Surgeon Balmain,
who had been sent to relieve Mr. Considen, and the Rev. R.
Johnson, who went for the purpose of performing marriages and
christenings, were also taken to Norfolk Island in the Atlantic,
besides a number of marine and convict settlers. <a href=
"#note-355" name="noteref-355" id="noteref-355">{23}</a></p>
<p>Reference has been made on a previous page to the action of
Lieutenant-Governor King, when returning to the colony by the
Gorgon, in procuring live stock at the Cape of Good Hope; in
addition to this he also purchased a quantity of seeds and plants
at the various ports at which the Gorgon touched. <a href=
"#note-356" name="noteref-356" id="noteref-356">{24}</a> From St.
Jago, he wrote on the 3rd May, 1791, that he had procured at
Teneriffe some fig-trees, orange-trees, and vine-cuttings. He
also obtained a quantity of cotton and other seeds. At the same
place he managed to secure four pairs of hand-millstones, which
he regarded as a possession of no little value. Up to that time
there were few implements in the colony for grinding corn; and
King imagined that he was fortunate in hitting upon a place where
millstones, which would keep a family of ten persons going, and
last a hundred years, could be bought at 3s. 4d. a pair. The want
of mills for grinding corn was mentioned frequently in the
despatches sent to England by Phillip, but he did not approve of
handmills. Those sent out from England were "easily rendered
useless and destroyed", and to grind corn with them for a large
number of people involved "great labour". He represented that
windmills were an absolute necessity, and in course of time he
obtained not only windmills, but millwrights to look after them,
and millers to work in them. <a href="#note-357" name=
"noteref-357" id="noteref-357">{25}</a></p>
<p>From the Cape, King wrote to Nepean on the 3rd July, 1791, to
tell him that he had purchased a quantity of live stock,
consisting of black cattle, sheep, and swine, for which he
intended to draw bills on the Treasury. <a href="#note-358" name=
"noteref-358" id="noteref-358">{26}</a> This purchase is a
striking example of King's energy and forethought. He knew that
live stock was one of the most urgent needs of the new
settlement; he knew also that while the fact was equally patent
to the British Government, no effort had been made to supply the
want. It must have struck him as singular in the extreme that,
while the importance of procuring live stock was dwelt upon in
the despatches from England, proper steps had not been taken to
profit by the voyage of the Gorgon, although she was a suitable
vessel, and it was known that cattle, sheep, and swine could be
procured at the Cape. <a href="#note-359" name="noteref-359" id=
"noteref-359">{27}</a> King made good the omission. Without any
authority he purchased as large a quantity of stock as the Gorgon
could conveniently carry&mdash;if the vessel had been differently
fitted up she could have carried much more <a href="#note-360"
name="noteref-360" id="noteref-360">{28}</a> &mdash;and succeeded
in landing part of it at Sydney. He was pretty sure of his
ground, but still he had some misgivings. It was not a safe thing
for an officer to go beyond his instructions, and all the letters
King wrote on the subject show that the responsibility he had
taken pressed heavily upon him. In his first letter from the
Cape, 3rd July, 1791, he assured Nepean that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"No other consideration than the knowledge I have of
the great want of black cattle, sheep, &amp;c., to breed from,
and having every reason to suppose that it was the intention of
his Majesty's ministers that stock should be transported from
hence to New South Wales. could have induced me to take the
unauthorised step of drawing for the payment on the Right
Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury."
<a href="#note-361" name="noteref-361" id=
"noteref-361">{29}</a></blockquote>
<p>Writing privately to Nepean on the same date, he said in
justification of the unusual step he had taken:&mdash;"Had I not
interfered in the business, the Gorgon would have gone without a
single head of stock, and as it is, I think she should have
stowed more, but I have gone far enough to risque a censure."
<a href="#note-362" name="noteref-362" id="noteref-362">{30}</a>
The responsibility continued to weigh on his mind, for in a
letter written towards the end of the month he expressed a fear
that he might be "greatly censured" for the part he had taken,
and begged Nepean to tell him by the first opportunity whether he
had done right or wrong.</p>
<p>The stock which caused King so much anxiety fared rather badly
at sea, but nevertheless the shipment was far more successful
than others had been. According to a memorandum which appears at
the foot of King's letter to Nepean of the 27th October, 1791,
<a href="#note-363" name="noteref-363" id="noteref-363">{31}</a>
28 head of cattle, 66 sheep, 11 pigs, 16 rabbits, and 20 pigeons
were shipped on board the Gorgon at the Cape of Good Hope. The
passage was marked by cold and rough weather, and only 19 cattle,
59 sheep, and 5 pigs (including births on the passage) were
landed at Sydney. The fate of the rabbits and pigeons is left to
conjecture.</p>
<p>Phillip was not placed in such a bad plight by the arrival of
the Third Fleet as he had been the year before, when the Neptune,
Scarborough, and Surprize came into port loaded with sick and
dying men, although the number of convicts he had to provide for
was twice as many. One reason was that the sick were not landed
in such a deplorable state as those brought by the vessels of the
Second Fleet; another was that they were not all thrown upon the
colony at once, but were distributed over a period of three
months. Phillip had also received longer notice, and he had
learnt by experience how to meet these calls on his resources.
One feature of the case that cannot fail to arrest attention is
the implicit confidence which the English authorities seem to
have placed in the ability of the Governor to provide
accommodation at short notice for any number of convicts that
might be sent to the colony. When they had cleared the gaols and
sent the prisoners on board the transports, their difficulties
were ended.</p>
<p>There seems, indeed, to have been some suspicion on the part
of the Home Department that an inconvenient, if not an imprudent,
course was being pursued, for in the despatch of 19th February,
1791, informing Phillip of the impending departure of the Third
Fleet, Grenville stated that a system was to be adopted of
sending out convicts "in two embarkations in the course of each
year". By this plan it was hoped that a regular intercourse
between the mother country and the settlements in Australia would
be kept up, and inconvenience from the "accidental failure" of
supplies prevented. <a href="#note-364" name="noteref-364" id=
"noteref-364">{32}</a> Phillip, in replying to this despatch,
expressed gratification that a system which promised so well was
to be adopted. But the expectation was not realised, and for many
years afterwards the colony suffered from the want of regular
supplies.</p>
<p>When Phillip received Grenville's despatch of 19th February,
1791, he had less than three months in which to prepare for the
reception of over two thousand criminals. Owing to the numerous
deaths on board the transports, the actual number to be provided
for was 1,863; and this large influx of population severely taxed
the resources of the settlement. The sick, of whom there were
upwards of five hundred, were placed in the hospitals; those who
were capable of work, no matter in what degree, were sent to
Parramatta and the neighbourhood, where the cultivation of the
soil was proceeding. It was impossible to provide houses for the
whole of these convicts by the time they arrived, so Phillip
erected two large buildings, thatched with grass, which afforded
shelter from the weather, but nothing more. <a href="#note-365"
name="noteref-365" id="noteref-365">{33}</a> The accommodation
was, of course, only temporary; but the fact that such a plan had
to be adopted shows to what expedients Phillip was driven, in
order to provide for the large additional population suddenly
thrust upon him.</p>
<p>Although eleven ships, including the Gorgon, had arrived in
the course of a few months, the colony was still badly supplied
with provisions. After the arrival of the Matilda, the second
vessel of the Third Fleet, on 1st August, 1791, the allowance of
flour was increased: and on the 27th, the Atlantic and Salamander
having arrived, the full ration was issued, after being suspended
for twenty-one weeks. <a href="#note-366" name="noteref-366" id=
"noteref-366">{34}</a> The whole of the fleet, ten sail in all,
as well as the warship Gorgon, had arrived by the middle of
October, and yet we find Phillip reporting to Nepean only a month
later (18th November) "we are again at a reduced ration".
<a href="#note-367" name="noteref-367" id="noteref-367">{35}</a>
It may appear strange that a reduction in the ration should have
become necessary so soon after the arrival of the ships, but the
fact is easily explained. The small amount of provisions they
carried was out of proportion to the large increase they made in
the population. <a href="#note-368" name="noteref-368" id=
"noteref-368">{36}</a></p>
<p>The wreck of the Sirius at Norfolk Island, in March, 1790, now
left the settlement (the population of which had been largely
increased by the convicts of the Third Fleet) with only one
King's ship&mdash;the small armed tender Supply&mdash;rigged as a
brig. Both for the proper protection of the settlement and the
examination of the coast, Phillip thought that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>The colony should never be without two ships; and I
feel it my duty to say that I think no ships can with safety be
employed on this station unless they are King's ships, that is,
ships having commission, warrant, and petty officers on board
them; and I think that more than one commissioned officer should
be on board such ships." <a href="#note-369" name="noteref-369"
id="noteref-369">{37}</a></blockquote>
<p>There was considerable force in what Phillip urged. Having
regard to the circumstances&mdash;the lawless character of the
bulk of the population: the state of the harbour at times, where
numerous transports, commanded in many cases by unscrupulous
masters, and manned by disorderly seamen, were lying within easy
distance of the shore&mdash;the presence of one man-of-war, if
not two, was a necessary precaution; but the matter does not
appear to have presented itself to the British Government in that
light. Phillip's strong representations on the subject, however,
would probably have led to the appointment of at least one
war-vessel to the station, but for the circumstances in which the
Government was placed. By the time his despatch reached England
war with France was imminent, and it may readily be understood
that the Admiralty felt disinclined to part with any of its
war-ships for service at the out-of-the-way settlement of New
South Wales. Phillip had expected that a vessel would be sent out
to take the place of the Sirius, but in this he was disappointed.
The Gorgon might reasonably have been expected to remain at the
settlement pending some arrangement; but after her departure in
December, 1791, the station was without a man-of-war until the
26th August, 1795, when H.M.S. Providence arrived, followed, on
the 7th September, by the Reliance and the Supply, two
men-of-war, which had been purchased and fitted specially for the
settlement.</p>
<p>The scarcity of boats was felt even more than the want of
ships. Writing to Grenville on the 5th November, 1791, Phillip
stated that the only boat available for his journeys between
Sydney and Parramatta was one that he could not go out of the
harbour in. The boats capable of exploring the coast, which he
would have gladly employed in services of that kind, had been
laid up for many months. <a href="#note-370" name="noteref-370"
id="noteref-370">{38}</a> No doubt Phillip would have kept these
boats in repair if he had been able to do so, but he had no
boat-builders or shipwrights at his disposal. The position was
slightly improved at the beginning of the following year, the
Pitt having brought out a small vessel in frame. But Phillip was
not certain that he should be able to set her up, for there were
only three or four ordinary shipwrights available, and he was led
to express his regret "that one or two good shipwrights" had not
been sent out. Even when the vessel had been set up she must
remain "until proper people can be found to man her".</p>
<p>It was not until the 24th July, 1793, that the Francis, for so
the little craft was called, <a href="#note-371" name=
"noteref-371" id="noteref-371">{39}</a> was put in the
water&mdash;the first vessel launched in Australia. She is
described by Collins as a sloop of forty-one tons, but she was
turned into a schooner because that rig was considered safer. It
was found afterwards that a mistake had been made. She sailed
badly, and had to be remasted. The launching of the little vessel
would have been delayed still longer but for an accident which
placed the services of a capable shipwright at the disposal of
the colony. <a href="#note-372" name="noteref-372" id=
"noteref-372">{40}</a> When she was equipped, Grose gave the
command to Mr. William House, boatswain of the Discovery, who had
been sent by Vancouver to Sydney for the purpose of being
forwarded to England as an invalid, but had recovered from his
illness. As soon as she could be got ready, Grose despatched the
Francis to Dusky Bay, New Zealand, "in order to ascertain how far
that place, which I understand possesses all the advantages of
Norfolk Island, with the addition of a safe harbour and seal
fishery, may tend to the benefit of his Majesty's service, as
connected with these settlements." The Francis afterwards did
good work in exploring the New South Wales coast, and proved of
infinite service to the colony.<br>

Lieutenant Richard Bowen, one of the naval agents, who was on
board the Atlantic, reported on his arrival in Sydney the
discovery of a "good harbour on the coast", in latitude 35&deg;
6' south, which he named Jervis Bay. In the <i>Naval
Chronicle</i>, vol. xxiii, pp. 353 to 379, a memoir of Lieutenant
Bowen is given, in which mention is made of his services under
Sir John Jervis, afterwards Earl St. Vincent. There is little
doubt that Bowen named the bay after his former commander, to
whom he was largely indebted for promotion in the Navy. The
county in which the bay is situated was subsequently
appropriately named St. Vincent. Bowen furnished Phillip with an
eye-draught of the bay, of which the accompanying chart is a
reduced copy. The island lying off the south head of the bay was
named Bowen Island in honour of its discoverer. In November,
1791&mdash;three months after Bowen discovered it&mdash;Captain
Weatherhead, of the transport Matilda, while coasting southward
in search of seals, put into the bay to stop a leak. He remained
there some days, and upon his return to Sydney furnished Phillip
with the accompanying chart of the bay, copied from the original,
which is still in existence. See Historical Records, vol. i, part
2, pp. 548, 553, 556, 558; Collins, vol. i, p. 174; Tench,

As the Gorgon "was to bring out stores and provisions, her

Young, the naval agent in charge; but from information received
since that volume went to press, it appears that the report came
from Mr. George Bowen, the master. Phillip, when the affair came
to his knowledge, approved of what had been
done.&mdash;Historical Records, vol. i, part 2, p. 559. Collins
(vol. i, p. 181) remarks:&mdash;"They had at this time parted
company with the other transports, and no other means seemed so
likely to deter the convicts from any future attempt of the like
nature. It afterwards appearing that two of the seamen had
supplied them with instruments for sawing off their irons, these
were left at the island of Madeira, where the Albemarle touched,
to be sent prisoners to England."</p>

fifty male and four female convicts dying within the thirty days.
Five hundred sick persons received medicines at the end of the
month." Hunter, in his Journal, p. 561, says:&mdash;"Forty-two
convicts died in the month of November, and in these people
nature seemed fairly to be worn out; many of them were so
thoroughly exhausted that they expired without a groan, and
apparently without any kind of pain." Referring to the number of
convicts returned as sick, Hunter says that one hundred might be
added to the Parramatta list, for there was that number of men
who were "so weak that they could not be put to any kind of
labour, not even to that of pulling grass for thatching the
huts."</p>

such a ship as the Gorgon was to be properly fitted in England,
with only half-a-dozen guns mounted, she would be able to bring
ten times more live stock than the colony has hitherto
received."&mdash;Ib., 597.</p>

<h3>11. EMANCIPATION.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>WHEN</small> preparing the Governor's Commission and
Instructions (the two documents from which Phillip derived his
very extensive powers), a novel point of law presented itself to
the authorities. For many years it had been the custom to empower
the Governors or proprietors of Colonial possessions in America
and elsewhere to exercise the royal prerogative of pardon in
regard to offences committed within the limits of their own
territories. Phillip, however, had asked for more than this
power. When submitting a number of suggestions to the Secretary
of State for the guidance of the officials in drawing up his
Instructions, he requested that he should be empowered to
emancipate deserving convicts; that is to say, that he should
have authority to pardon convicts for offences committed in Great
Britain. This was, from the peculiar circumstances of the
settlement, a very necessary power; but it was one which could
not be delegated to Phillip by the Crown without statutory
authority, <a href="#note-373" name="noteref-373" id=
"noteref-373">{1}</a> the prerogative of pardoning "any kyndes of
felonnyes . . . . comytted in any parties of this realme" being
vested in the Crown alone, by 27 Henry VIII, c. 24. For this
reason we find that Phillip's Commission contained a clause which
conveyed no greater powers than did the Commissions of Governors
of free settlements. The clause in question was evidently
intended to apply only to sentences passed by Colonial tribunals.
It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"And wee do hereby give and grant unto you full power
and authority where you shall see cause or shall judge any
offender or offenders in criminal matters or for any fine or
fines or forfeitures due unto us fit objects of our mercy to
pardon all such offenders and to remit all such offences fines
and forfeitures treason and wilful murder only excepted in which
cases you shall likewise have power upon extraordinary occasions
to grant reprieves to the offenders untill and to the intent our
royal pleasure may be known therein." <a href="#note-374" name=
"noteref-374" id="noteref-374">{2}</a></blockquote>
<p>It will be noticed that the persons pointed to as fit objects
of clemency are not "convicts", but "offenders"; and the words
which follow, especially when they are read in connection with
that portion of the clause which relates to reprieves, plainly
indicate that it was not the emancipation of convicts that was
contemplated. In order to enable Phillip to do this, it was
necessary to pass a short Act empowering the King to delegate his
prerogative in the cases of convicts sentenced in England, and
then to issue a Commission to Phillip under the Great Seal of
Great Britain authorising him to act. In fact, such a Commission
was anticipated in his Instructions; but in the original the date
was omitted. The clause ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"And whereas we have by our Commission bearing
date&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;given and granted unto you full
power and authority to emancipate and discharge from their
servitude any of the convicts under your superintendence who
shall from their good conduct and a disposition to industry be
deserving of favour: It is our will and pleasure that in every
such case you do issue your warrant to the Surveyor of Lands to
make surveys of and mark out in lots such lands upon the said
territory as may be necessary for their use." <a href="#note-375"
name="noteref-375" id="noteref-375">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the clause has reference to land grants.</p>
<p>Before an Act could be passed and a Commission made out the
Fleet had sailed; Parliament went into recess a few weeks
afterwards, and did not reassemble until six months had elapsed.
No opportunity was, at the time, expected to occur of
communicating with Phillip for many months; and it was not until
May, 1790 (three years after his departure), that the Act 30 Geo.
III, c. 47, entitled, "An Act for enabling his Majesty to
authorise his Governor or Lieutenant-Governor of such places
beyond the seas to which felons or other offenders may be
transported to remit the sentences of such offenders", was
passed. This will account for the blank in Phillip's Instructions
not being filled in before the fleet sailed. The text of the Act
is given in Appendix D. It gave the Governor or
Lieutenant-Governor, for the time being, power to remit,
absolutely or conditionally, the whole or any part of the term
for which any convict had been transported. It required the
pardon to be made in writing under the seal of the territory, and
a duplicate, also under seal, to be forwarded to England for
insertion in the next General Pardon which passed under the Great
Seal. During the interval which elapsed between the grant by the
Governor and the confirmation by the Crown, the emancipated
convict was in the position of one who had received a pardon
under the Royal Sign-Manual; that is to say, he was discharged
from the necessity of servitude, but could not claim the
restitution of his civil rights, which had been forfeited by
attainder for felony.</p>
<p>For many years the full import of this distinction was not
recognised. It was generally considered in the colony that the
legal effect both of absolute and conditional pardons conferred
by the Governor of New South Wales was to restore to the parties
all the privileges of free subjects. <a href="#note-376" name=
"noteref-376" id="noteref-376">{4}</a> In fact, even as late as
1818, Mr. Justice Field, in giving judgment in the case of Doe
<i>d</i>. Jenkins <i>v</i>. Pearce and wife, declared that "the
King's or Governor's absolute pardon would, of course, restore
him (a felon attaint) to his competency." <a href="#note-377"
name="noteref-377" id="noteref-377">{5}</a> Considerable
consternation was therefore created when it became known that the
Court of King's Bench had ruled in the case of Bullock <i>v</i>.
Dodds <a href="#note-378" name="noteref-378" id=
"noteref-378">{6}</a>: that the extinction of the civil rights
which followed upon attainder for felony not being removed by a
pardon under the sign-manual, and the remission of a convict's
sentence by the Governor of New South Wales having no more effect
than such a pardon, it followed that until the name of the party
was included in a General Pardon under the Great Seal of the
Kingdom he was still, in the eye of the law, <i>civiliter
mortuus</i>. In the cause under notice this had not been done,
and the plaintiff, although he had, shortly after landing in the
colony, been emancipated by the Governor, was unable to recover
on a bill of exchange because he could not show that the act of
the Governor had been confirmed by an instrument under the Great
Seal of Great Britain. Bullock's case does not appear to have
been an exception. Mr. Commissioner Bigge, in his report (May,
1822), stated that the direction contained in 30 Geo. III, c.
47&mdash;that duplicates of pardons granted by the Governor
should be forwarded to England for insertion in the next General
Pardon which passed under the Great Seal&mdash;'had never been
literally complied with in New South Wales." <a href="#note-379"
name="noteref-379" id="noteref-379">{7}</a></p>
<p>The Special Commission empowering Phillip to emancipate
convicts was received by the Gorgon in September, 1791; but
Phillip had anticipated it. Writing on the 5th March, 1791, seven
months before he received this Commission, he informed Grenville
that he had emancipated two convicts&mdash;"one from his very
meritorious behaviour and the great service he has rendered the
colony by his own labour, and by instructing others, in the
business of a bricklayer." <a href="#note-380" name="noteref-380"
id="noteref-380">{8}</a> The other was particularly recommended
by the Lieutenant-Governor as having been the means of saving the
Sirius from being burned after that ship went in shore." <a href=
"#note-381" name="noteref-381" id="noteref-381">{9}</a> In so
acting Phillip exceeded his powers, and the men were illegally at
large. After the receipt of the Commission empowering him to
emancipate, Phillip reported (5th November, 1791) that he had
freed another convict. This person had been "bred to surgery",
and was employed as an assistant to the surgeons. He was made a
free man because of his "exemplary conduct." <a href="#note-382"
name="noteref-382" id="noteref-382">{10}</a> In the case of the
convict who was emancipated because at considerable personal risk
he had saved the wreck of the Sirius from destruction by fire,
the act of grace was redundant. Shortly after the warrant giving
the man his freedom had been executed it was discovered that "his
term of transportation had expired prior to his emancipation."
The fact, however, was not discovered until he had left for India
in the Atlantic, as an "emancipated" convict. <a href="#note-383"
name="noteref-383" id="noteref-383">{11}</a></p>
<p>The remission of sentence, or emancipation, which the Governor
was empowered to grant was a conditional one. It is apparent from
Phillip's original Commission and Instructions that emancipation
was to be granted with a view to turning the well-disposed
convicts into settlers, and so promoting the cultivation of the
country. In the Instructions which accompanied the Special
Commission authorising the Governor to remit sentences, Phillip
was directed to insert in the instrument granting the remission
"a special condition that such felon or offender shall not return
within any part of our Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
during the term or time which shall thus remain unexpired of his
or her original sentence or order of transportation, on pain that
the remission so to him or her granted shall in such cases be
wholly null and void." This was an irksome condition. It meant
not only that the emancipist who returned to his native country
before the term of his original sentence had expired forfeited
his emancipation, and might be sent back to finish his
punishment, but that he placed his life in jeopardy. According to
the law at that time, a convict who returned from the place of
transportation to Great Britain or Ireland before the term of his
sentence had expired was guilty of a capital offence, on proof of
which he was liable to the punishment of death. Emancipation as
granted under these Instructions was not therefore perfect
liberty. The emancipist, if he remained in New South Wales, was a
free man. He might labour for his own profit instead of for the
advantage of the State, or seek his fortune in any colony or in a
foreign State; but if he returned to the land of his birth he did
so at his peril. <a href="#note-384" name="noteref-384" id=
"noteref-384">{12}</a></p>
<p>The desire of most of the convicts transported from the United
Kingdom was to return to the country from which they had been
banished, and some of them, in their eagerness to get back, paid
no heed to the danger into which they ran, and were punished for
their temerity. It was the established policy of the British
Government to keep convicts from returning, whether they had
served their sentences or not. According to the view then held at
Sydney Cove as to the effect of a sentence of transportation, it
was doubtful whether convicts would be able to return to the
places from which they had been despatched even when their
sentences expired. In one of his early letters to Nepean, 9th
July, 1788, <a href="#note-385" name="noteref-385" id=
"noteref-385">{13}</a> Phillip said that those whose sentences
would soon expire intended to "apply for permission to return to
England", but, he added, that until instructions had been
received from the Government none would be allowed to leave the
settlement. He expressed the opinion, however, that if "the most
abandoned and useless" were permitted, on the expiration of their
sentences, to go to China, it would be a great advantage to the
settlement. From this it would seem that the impression on
Phillip's mind was that when once a criminal had been
transported, no matter for what term, he was practically banished
from the mother country for the rest of his life, unless the
authorities in England chose to allow him to return.</p>
<p>Nothing seems to have been done to rectify this wrong until
King's arrival in England, in 1790, with despatches from the
colony. We find him writing to Nepean from 18, Craven-street, on
the 1st February, 1791, <a href="#note-386" name="noteref-386"
id="noteref-386">{14}</a> to say that he was ignorant whether
Phillip, in his despatches of which he was the bearer, had
mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The great inconvenience that will attend the vast
number of convicts who say the term of their transportation is
expired. It is needless for me to say that those who can get a
passage expect leave to quit the colony. On this head Governor
Phillip desired I would speak to you."</blockquote>
<p>On the 5th March, 1791, <a href="#note-387" name="noteref-387"
id="noteref-387">{15}</a> Phillip wrote to say that there were a
number of convicts who said that their sentences were expired and
wanted to return to England, and he begged for instructions. A
few weeks after King had communicated with Nepean, Grenville
wrote a despatch <a href="#note-388" name="noteref-388" id=
"noteref-388">{16}</a> informing Phillip that the return to
England of convicts whose sentences had expired "could not
legally be prevented", but stated that it was extremely desirable
that "every reasonable indulgence should be held out" to persons
of this class to remain in New South Wales, and adding that "it
should be distinctly understood that no steps are likely to be
taken by Government for facilitating their return." But although
the British Government did everything it possibly could to keep
the convicts in the country to which they had been sent, many of
them returned to England, Ireland, or Scotland, as soon as they
were in a position to do so, and many others would have returned
if they could. Life in the colony, even with the advantages that
were to be gained from a free grant of land and the means of
subsistence for eighteen months, was to the minds of most of them
an uninviting prospect.</p>
<p>Although there were at this time many vessels returning to
England, it is probable that if the discharged convicts had been
obliged to pay for their passages very few of them would have
been able to leave the colony. The transports, however, were
frequently in need of hands, and men who could work were taken to
England in exchange for their services during the voyage. As soon
as it was known in Sydney that there was no legal obstacle to the
return to England of convicts who had served their time,
advantage was taken of whatever opportunities presented
themselves; and a few months after Phillip received Grenville's
despatch informing him that expirees could not be kept in the
colony against their will, it became his duty to send to the Home
Department "a list of those convicts whose times being expired
have left the settlement in the different transports." <a href=
"#note-389" name="noteref-389" id="noteref-389">{17}</a> On the
16th December, 1791, he wrote to Grenville transmitting the
duplicates of four warrants of emancipation under the seal of the
colony. <a href="#note-390" name="noteref-390" id=
"noteref-390">{18}</a></p>
<p>The forms of absolute and conditional pardons will be found in
Appendices E and F. In later years a third class of pardon, known
as the Ticket-of-Leave, was introduced; the form, for purposes of
comparison, is given in Appendix G.</p>

<h3>12. THE NATIVES. <small>[1791-3]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> admirable spirit displayed by Phillip in
his dealings with the natives during the three years following
his landing has been alluded to in a previous vol. <a href=
"#note-391" name="noteref-391" id="noteref-391">{1}</a> During
the latter part of 1791 and the beginning of 1792 the relations
between the natives and the new-comers did not improve. Phillip
steadily adhered to the amicable policy outlined in his
Instructions, but his efforts to bring about a good understanding
between the two races were constantly frustrated. It may be said,
however, that, with very few exceptions, the white man, if not
immediately to blame, was the original aggressor. The natives
could appreciate kind treatment, and were very friendly with
those who won their confidence, but they resented any injury, no
matter how slight it might be; and as the aboriginals' code of
honour taught them to avenge any wrong, grave or otherwise, with
blood, tragic consequences sometimes followed from small causes,
and the injured natives had to be punished for taking the law
into their own hands. But, as a rule, Phillip refrained from
making any reprisals whenever he found that the natives had acted
from a misconception of the motives of the settlers, or had been
provoked by them. One case is particularly worthy of mention. In
September, 1790, he was seriously wounded at Manly by a native
whom he had approached in a friendly manner; but, knowing that
the savage had misconstrued the overture, he took no steps to
punish the offender, but rather endeavoured to have his pacific
intentions explained. <a href="#note-392" name="noteref-392" id=
"noteref-392">{2}</a> The reasoning of the native was very
natural. Phillip had caused several of them to be captured, and
when he advanced with outstretched hands to the one with whom he
wished to make friends, it was not strange that his object should
have been misinterpreted.</p>
<p>It happened that Bennilong, one of the captured natives, who
had escaped a few weeks before, was among the natives at the
time, and it was probably owing to his representations, as well
as to the judicious conduct of the Governor, that good instead of
harm came of the encounter. While Phillip was recovering from his
wound, Bennilong was induced to return to the settlement as a
visitor. He brought three other natives with him, and was so
pleased with his reception that he took up his residence at
Sydney, in a hut built for him at the eastern point of the cove.
This point, on which Fort Macquarie now stands, was until recent
years known as Bennilong Point. <a href="#note-393" name=
"noteref-393" id="noteref-393">{3}</a></p>
<p>Bennilong's return led to the establishment of amicable
relations with the native tribes. One instance of the
friendliness of the blacks is specially noticed by Collins. A
small boat belonging to the chief surgeon, Mr. White, was taken
by five convicts to fish in the harbour, and was lost with all
hands near Middle Head. Portions of the boat were washed ashore,
and were found by the natives, who, instead of appropriating
them, placed them in positions from which they might easily be
seen from boats passing up and down the harbour. <a href=
"#note-394" name="noteref-394" id="noteref-394">{4}</a></p>
<p>The foundation of a good understanding with the natives
appeared to have been laid, but the promise was illusory.
Although they looked sharply after their own possessions, they
could not be brought to respect the right of property claimed by
the new-comers in the products of the soil. Some of the articles
of food used by the whites they would not eat&mdash;notably
bread, but they were very fond of potatoes, which they stole from
the fields. In a settlement where starvation was always a
possible calamity, the preservation of the crops was a matter of
life and death, and there being no other effective way of
stopping depredations in the potato-fields, parties of soldiers
were sent out to disperse the thieves. The natives, thinking
perhaps that they had a right to the produce of the grounds they
had occupied from time immemorial, <a href="#note-395" name=
"noteref-395" id="noteref-395">{5}</a> offered resistance. A
party of soldiers having made a demonstration in one of the
fields, a club was thrown. The reply was a discharge of firearms,
which caused the precipitate retreat of the blacks. One of them
was fatally wounded, and his body was found a few days
afterwards, disposed for burial. The circumstances of this affair
are related by Collins, who lamented that such severe measures
for the protection of the crops had become necessary. <a href=
"#note-396" name="noteref-396" id="noteref-396">{6}</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this unfortunate incident, it was not long
before friendly relations with the natives were re-established;
but they were broken off again very soon, by an act of wanton
mischief on the part of some of the convicts. Several of the
natives were accustomed to sell or exchange fish among the people
at Parramatta, and in a settlement where fresh animal food was
almost an unknown thing this was a great advantage. While one of
these natives, named Ballooderry, was disposing of the fish he
had caught, his canoe, which he had endeavoured to hide, was
discovered by six convicts, who destroyed it. Ballooderry was
greatly enraged at this, and "threatened to take his own revenge,
and in his own way, upon all white people." With the object of
pacifying him, and showing him that it was intended to treat him
and his people with justice, the convicts who had destroyed the
canoe were found and punished. Ballooderry was even led to
believe that one of them had been hanged. But this did not
satisfy the wrath of the savage. According to aboriginal law, a
man who had been injured must take personal vengeance, and the
only way in which he could do so was by shedding some one's
blood, no matter whose, provided that the victim was of the same
tribe or race as the person who had inflicted the wrong.
Ballooderry watched for an opportunity, and coming upon a convict
who had strayed from Parramatta into the bush, attacked and
wounded him with a spear. Instead of trying to capture and punish
Ballooderry, Phillip simply forbade him to appear again at any of
the settlements. The result was that "the other natives, his
friends, being alarmed, Parramatta was seldom visited by any of
them, and all commerce with them was destroyed." <a href=
"#note-397" name="noteref-397" id="noteref-397">{7}</a></p>
<p>This occurrence serves to show how many of the
misunderstandings between the natives and the white population,
ending frequently in loss of life, arose. The convicts stole the
natives' nets and spears or destroyed their canoes; the blacks,
in return, speared the white men whenever they could do so with
safety. According to Phillip, whose knowledge of the
circumstances must be regarded as accurate, the convicts were,
with few exceptions, the aggressors. When two men were killed by
natives at Rushcutters' Bay, soon after the foundation of the
settlement, he refused to take any measures to punish the
murderers, because he was convinced that they had killed the
convicts "in their own defence, or in defending their canoes".
<a href="#note-398" name="noteref-398" id="noteref-398">{8}</a>
Many convicts were killed and wounded after this in Phillip's
time, and, according to his despatches, these outrages were
nearly always committed in revenue for injuries done to the
natives by the convicts. On the 12th February, 1790, a year
before the destruction of Ballooderry's canoe, Phillip reported
to the Home Department that one convict had been killed and ten
wounded since November, 1788. He explained that it was
"impossible to prevent the convicts from straggling, and the
natives, having been robbed and ill treated, now attack those
they meet unarmed." In other words, they took revenge for the
injuries they had received at the hands of the white man,
according to aboriginal custom and precedent.</p>
<p>The quarrel with Ballooderry and his friends did a great deal
of harm. It not only deprived the settlement of the advantages
that were gained from an interchange of commodities with the
natives&mdash;it estranged the people, and caused them to assume
a more hostile attitude than they had taken up before. Soon after
Ballooderry had been warned not to approach the settlements, an
attack was made upon a settler at Prospect Hill, and it was this,
according to Collins, that compelled Phillip to depart from his
instructions as to the disposition of the land, and place
settlers on contiguous lots, instead of separating them by areas
of land reserved for the Crown. <a href="#note-399" name=
"noteref-399" id="noteref-399">{9}</a> The unfriendly relations
between the two races continued. In the following year some
natives were discovered in the act of robbing a hut. They were
fired at with a shot-gun, and one of them was wounded. A few days
afterwards a convict, when walking from Parramatta to Prospect
Hill, was set upon and killed; his body bore no less than thirty
spear-wounds. It was obvious that this murder was an act of
revenge, and the friendly natives declared it to be so. Worse
things happened in later years, one act of violence leading to
another. If Phillip's policy had been loyally followed by the
white population, the natives might have been of infinite service
to the settlement in the early days; instead of which they became
an annoyance and a danger.</p>

the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences,
they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle
they made a point of attacking the white people whenever
opportunity and safety concurred. It was also, unfortunately,
found that our knowledge of their language consisted at this time
of only a few terms for such things as, being visible, could not
well be mistaken; but no one had yet attained words enough to
convey an idea in connected terms. It was also conceived by some
among us, that those natives who came occasionally into the town
did not desire that any of the other tribes should participate in
the enjoyment of the few trifles they procured from us. If this
were true, it would for a long time retard the general

<h3>13. PHILLIP AND DAWES.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> the despatch containing Grenville's final
instructions <a href="#note-400" name="noteref-400" id=
"noteref-400">{1}</a> concerning the recall of Ross's detachment
of marines, one officer was singled out for special mention as
likely to be of peculiar service to the colony, and authority was
given to Phillip, in case he had not placed him in charge of the
auxiliary company of the New South Wales Corps, to retain him on
the footing of a lieutenant of engineers. This officer was
Lieutenant William Dawes, to whose services reference has been
made in a previous vol. <a href="#note-401" name="noteref-401"
id="noteref-401">{2}</a> Shortly after the despatch referred to
was written, and before Phillip received it, a disagreement had,
however, arisen between him and Lieutenant Dawes which rendered
the retention of the latter impossible. Phillip would doubtless,
in keeping with his established policy of ignoring the petty
annoyances to which he was constantly subjected, have made no
mention of the dispute in his despatches, but it became necessary
for him to explain why he had refrained from giving effect to
Grenville's wishes concerning Lieutenant Dawes. The circumstances
of the principal cause of dispute had occurred in December, 1790.
In November, 1791, <a href="#note-402" name="noteref-402" id=
"noteref-402">{3}</a> Phillip, in replying to Grenville, informed
him that his charges were three in number:&mdash;1. That
Lieutenant Dawes had purchased rations from convicts contrary to
the General Orders; 2. That he had refused to do duty; 3. That he
had been guilty of unofficerlike behaviour to the Governor. The
first charge was not a light one; traffic in convicts' rations
had caused serious trouble in the settlement. The men made a
practice, as Phillip explains, of putting together their rations
of flour, and obtaining in exchange spirits and tobacco. The
terms were ten pounds of flour for a bottle of rum, and thirty
pounds of flour for a pound of tobacco. Those who parted with
their flour for spirits and tobacco were pinched with hunger. The
full allowance of food was insufficient, <a href="#note-403"
name="noteref-403" id="noteref-403">{4}</a> and convicts could
not afford to give up a single ounce much less the whole of their
flour, which was the main part of the ration. The natural result
followed&mdash;those convicts who had deprived themselves of
their ration of flour stole from the others and from the
military. Robberies became frequent. The nature of the evil, and
the measures that were taken to prevent it, may be seen from the
stringent order issued on the 11th February, 1791, <a href=
"#note-404" name="noteref-404" id="noteref-404">{5}</a> in which,
after pointing out that every individual was concerned in putting
a stop to "a practice which distresses the honest and
industrious, whose gardens are robbed and provisions stolen by
those who sell their rations", a reward of thirty pounds of flour
was offered for the discovery of any person who should "on any
consideration whatever" purchase or receive provisions from a
convict.</p>
<p>Phillip very properly looked to the civil and military
officers for assistance in carrying out this order, and if any
one of them, instead of helping to maintain the regulation, took
part in the traffic which had been prohibited, he was guilty of a
serious breach of duty. Lieutenant Dawes was so accused. As the
facts of the case are only partly revealed, the degree of his
culpability cannot be accurately measured. According to his
account, dated 6th November, 1791, if he offended at all, it was
in breaking the letter, not the spirit, of the regulation. He
admitted having purchased provisions from a convict, but he
denied that they were rations in the sense in which the term was
used in the order. The convict in question was "baker to the
garrison", and it was known, Lieutenant Dawes asserted, to all
the officers that the man received a weekly allowance of flour
"as the just perquisite of his business, which I therefore
presumed became his own property, and as such was deemed by
everyone to be entirely at his own disposal." He denied that he
had ever purchased from any of the convicts any article of their
ration. Phillip forwarded Dawes's statement to Lord Grenville,
with a memorandum in which he stated that he could not admit that
Lieutenant Dawes had never purchased rations from convicts. Major
Ross had, he alleged, been requested (presumably by Phillip
himself) to point out to Dawes, "some time before", the
impropriety of purchasing pease from convicts; and in one case in
which a convict appeared before the magistrates charged with a
breach of the order in question, he admitted having given forty
pounds of flour and twenty pounds of sugar to Lieutenant Dawes
for "spirits and other articles".</p>
<p>As no inquiry was held, it is impossible to say to what extent
the regulation was infringed by Lieutenant Dawes; but it is
apparent from his own account that he was at least guilty of an
indiscretion. The order was prohibitory; it forbade the purchase
of provisions from convicts under any circumstances whatever, and
it was the duty of every officer to see that it was strictly
enforced. If the flour which he purchased was the convict baker's
perquisite, the proper course would have been for him to bring
the matter under the notice of the Commissary before making any
purchase from a convict, even though he happened to be baker to
the garrison.</p>
<p>The second charge was more serious than the first. It arose
out of a difficulty with the natives in December, 1790. Some of
the tribes, to avenge themselves for injuries they had received
from the convicts, attacked with spears any white man they might
happen to meet unarmed. Several of the convicts having been
killed and others seriously wounded, Phillip determined to make
an example of the offenders, and sent out a large party of
soldiers, with instructions to pursue the tribe and bring in six
prisoners, or, if that should be found impracticable, to put a
similar number to death. <a href="#note-405" name="noteref-405"
id="noteref-405">{6}</a> An order to this effect was issued on
the 13th December, 1790, and it fell to Lieutenant Dawes, in the
ordinary course of duty, to go out with the party, which included
two captains and two subalterns. Entertaining a strong objection
to the plan proposed by Phillip for chastising the natives, he
wrote a letter to Captain Campbell, who commanded the detachment
(Major Ross was acting as Lieutenant-Governor at Norfolk Island),
refusing the duty. He was remonstrated with both by Campbell and
Phillip, but to no purpose. Apparently he had religious or
conscientious scruples, which were temporarily allayed by the
Chaplain, for it is stated that "late in the evening Lieutenant
Dawes informed Captain Campbell that the Rev. Mr. Johnson thought
he might obey the order, and that he was ready to go out with the
party, which he did." <a href="#note-406" name="noteref-406" id=
"noteref-406">{7}</a> But the matter did not end here; he spent
several days with the detachment in the vain pursuit of the
savages, who disappeared as soon as the soldiers came in sight.
After his return to Sydney he repented that he had been prevailed
upon to go out on such a service, and "informed the Governor that
'he was sorry he had been persuaded to comply with the order',
intimating at the same time that he would not obey a similar one
in future." This language, emphasised by a manner which showed to
the Governor a determination to disobey orders in the future, was
clearly insubordinate. If Phillip had been less forbearing it
would have been more strongly resented. Lieutenant Dawes does not
seem, however, to have regretted the part he played on this
occasion. In his letter of the 6th November, 1791, he informed
the Governor that "after so long a time having elapsed, and
repeated reflections on the subject, I feel at this instant no
reason to alter the sentiments I then entertained."</p>
<p>A second expedition was sent out a few days after the return
of the first; <a href="#note-407" name="noteref-407" id=
"noteref-407">{8}</a> but Lieutenant Dawes persisted in his
refusal to take part in it, and the language he used to the
Governor on this occasion constituted the third charge of
"unofficerlike behaviour". His expressions, Phillip stated, "were
such as would have subjected him to a Court-martial had he been
amenable to one". In regard to this part of the charge,
Lieutenant Dawes, who appears to have been of a very impulsive
disposition, disclaimed (in a letter to Phillip dated nearly a
year after the event) any intention to "express anything either
in word or manner in any degree improper or disrespectful", and
he was "exceedingly pained" to find that such an idea was
entertained. He explained that having conceived that a direct
charge had been made against him by the Governor of "leaving the
Observatory without sufficient cause", he had only done justice
to himself in denying the charge "in terms sufficiently clear and
expressive to leave no possibility of misconception". <a href=
"#note-408" name="noteref-408" id="noteref-408">{9}</a></p>
<p>It thus happened that while the Home Department was
endeavouring to make arrangements for his stay in the colony,
Lieutenant Dawes was doing his best to render it impossible for
him to remain, at all events in any official capacity. The
Governor appears to have entertained no personal animosity
towards the lieutenant, and he would have been glad to keep him
in the colony, "provided he had seen his error", not only because
it was the wish of the British Government that he should remain,
but because "his services were wanted in surveying and marking
out allotments of land for settlers". Instead, therefore, of
ordering him home to be tried by Court-martial, Phillip sent him
a written message informing him that his conduct would be
"forgotten" if he acknowledged the impropriety of it "in such a
manner as may leave no reason to suppose that anything similar
will happen in future". The exercise of a little diplomacy might
have removed the misunderstanding; but none was shown by either
party, and a month afterwards Lieutenant Dawes left the colony in
the Gorgon with the Commandant and the greater part of the marine
detachment.</p>
<p>The incident in itself is not of much consequence, but it is
important as showing the difficulties with which Phillip had to
contend, and the manner in which he dealt with them. His
relations with the officers of marines were unpleasant all
through, and if he had acted less judiciously than he did a
misfortune worse than that which occurred in Bligh's time would
probably have happened. In his dealings with Major Ross he kept
his feelings under restraint, and sank his pride of office. He
acted in the same manner with regard to Lieutenant Dawes. If he
had taken a severe or a limited view of his duty, and paid no
regard to surrounding circumstances, he would have put that
officer under arrest when he committed his first act of
insubordination. It is not unlikely that he had these facts in
his mind when he told Grenville, in the despatch which covered
the correspondence with Dawes, that he had "often found that the
peculiar situation this colony has been in made it necessary to
pass over improprieties which could not otherwise have passed
unnoticed." <a href="#note-409" name="noteref-409" id=

<h3>14. STATE OF THE SETTLEMENT IN 1792.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> despatch written by Phillip on the 19th
March, 1792, the last year of his Governorship, shows that the
difficulties under which the colony had so long laboured still
existed. The sick convicts brought by the Third Fleet in the
winter of 1791 were a burden on the settlement; the want of
implements to till the land, and clothing to protect the people
from the weather, was severely felt. <a href="#note-410" name=
"noteref-410" id="noteref-410">{1}</a> There was practically no
live stock, and the colony was still threatened with starvation.
Want of sufficient food told on the strength of the labourers,
while the survivors of the convicts who had been landed sick from
the transports became so weak that they were incapable of doing
any work. This occurred at a time when the absence of the
expected supplies from England, and the uncertainty that was felt
as to the time of their arrival, made progress with cultivation a
matter of vital importance. The hours of labour were
few&mdash;they did not amount, according to Collins's reckoning,
to more than three days per week <a href="#note-411" name=
"noteref-411" id="noteref-411">{2}</a> &mdash;and the men who
could work were so prostrated that their services were of little
value. <a href="#note-412" name="noteref-412" id=
"noteref-412">{3}</a> Under these circumstances the cultivation
of the land proceeded slowly and painfully.</p>
<p>One of the results of this unhappy condition of things was
systematic thieving by the half-starved convicts, who not only
stole corn from the fields, but broke into the stores and carried
off whatever provisions they could lay their hands on. Those who
were found pillaging the crops were flogged; those who were
convicted of robbing the stores were hanged. As the safety of the
settlement depended on the preservation of the stores, no mercy
was shown to offenders of this class. One of them, confessing his
fault the moment before his execution, said that he had committed
the theft for which he was about to suffer because of hunger. "He
appeared desirous of death," says Collins, "declaring that he
knew he could not live without stealing". This is a significant
remark. It shows that the robberies perpetrated at this time were
due not so much to the depravity of the offenders as to an
irresistible craving for food. Phillip, writing to Dundas in
October, 1792, informed him that nearly one-third of the 1791-92
crop of maize had been stolen from the grounds. So great, indeed,
was the scarcity of, and craving for, food that several of the
convicts died "from feeding on it [the Indian corn] in its crude
state when carrying the grain to the public granary." He added:
"It is but just to observe that I can recollect very few crimes
during the last three years but what have been committed to
procure the necessaries of life." <a href="#note-413" name=
"noteref-413" id="noteref-413">{4}</a></p>
<p>To hang starving men for stealing the means of sustaining life
would be regarded in the present day as a cruel and a brutal
thing; but in discussing the punishments inflicted upon the
convict population of New South Wales a hundred years ago, the
circumstances of the colony and the laws in force at the time
must be taken into consideration. House-breaking under the
English law was a capital offence, and if a convict at Sydney or
Parramatta was hanged for stealing a bag of flour from the public
store, be was not more harshly dealt with than a man who was sent
to the gallows in England for stealing a watch from a
dwelling-house. There was, in fact, greater reason for severity
in the former case than in the latter. It was necessary to
protect the stores of food by every possible means, and mercy
could not be extended to thieves without imperilling the public
safety. <a href="#note-414" name="noteref-414" id=
"noteref-414">{5}</a></p>
<p>It is a noticeable fact that the culprits were in almost every
case the convicts who came out in the vessels of the Second and
Third Fleets; those brought by the first transports took no part
in the robberies. The circumstance is not mentioned in Phillip's
despatches; but it attracted the attention of Collins, who
recorded it without suggesting any reason for the wide difference
between the conduct of the old and the new convicts. <a href=
"#note-415" name="noteref-415" id="noteref-415">{6}</a> The
reasons are not very difficult to discover. The first convicts
had been well disciplined, and had become inured to want. They
were, as a rule, in good health, and better able to bear
privations than the late arrivals. They also enjoyed advantages
which the new-comers did not possess, for some of them, at all
events, were able to supplement the ordinary ration with the
produce of their gardens. In a great many cases the sentences of
the men who belonged to the first batch of convicts were about to
expire, and the knowledge that they would soon regain their
freedom if they behaved well was a powerful incentive to good
conduct.</p>
<p>The new arrivals appear to have been so dissatisfied with
their lot, and so impatient of restraint, that, weak and
suffering as they were, they broke out into riot and
disorder.</p>
<p>It was necessary to put a stop to these demonstrations, which
threatened the peace of the settlement, and according to Collins
a proclamation was issued forbidding convicts to assemble in
numbers, and directing that any man who left his hut during a
disturbance should be deemed to be aiding and abetting the
rioters, and should be punished accordingly. <a href="#note-416"
name="noteref-416" id="noteref-416">{7}</a> This rigorous measure
had the desired effect, for riotous conduct on the part of the
convicts appears to have immediately ceased.</p>
<p>While affairs were in this state the Pitt arrived from England
(14th February, 1792), having on board Major Grose,
Lieutenant-Governor of the colony, and Commandant of the New
South Wales Corps. The Pitt also brought a company of this force
under the command of the Adjutant, Lieutenant Rowley, and a
number of convicts. <a href="#note-417" name="noteref-417" id=
"noteref-417">{8}</a> A ship from England was always a welcome
sight at Sydney Cove. In the case of the Pitt the feeling of
satisfaction was enhanced by the general belief that she had on
board a substantial quantity of stores for the relief of the
settlement; but like many other transports, she was a
disappointment. She brought neither flour nor rice, and only
enough beef and pork to supply the colony, at the reduced ration,
for forty days. <a href="#note-418" name="noteref-418" id=
"noteref-418">{9}</a> The omission, which was a serious one, was
explained by Dundas in a despatch forwarded by the
Pitt:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The supply was confined to these articles [salted
beef and pork] on the idea that with the grain produced in the
settlement, the flour already sent from Home, the quantity
purchased at Batavia, and the supply intended to be forwarded to
you from Calcutta, you would not, at least for the present, be in
want of flour or rice. I shall, however, before the departure of
the next ship, <a href="#note-419" name="noteref-419" id=
"noteref-419">{10}</a> endeavour to form the best opinion I can
from your communications, of the exact state of the settlement in
this respect; and shall then make such preparation as may appear
requisite for furnishing you with such further supplies as you
may be supposed to stand in need of." <a href="#note-420" name=
"noteref-420" id="noteref-420">{11}</a></blockquote>
<p>Collins alleged that when Dundas wrote this despatch (5th
July, 1791) he had before him Phillip's letter to Grenville of
the 17th July, 1790, <a href="#note-421" name="noteref-421" id=
"noteref-421">{12}</a> which was sent home by the Justinian, and
in which the Secretary of State was informed that "after two
years from this time we shall not want any further supply of
flour". As a matter of fact, Collins was wrong; and Dundas has
been unjustly blamed. The Justinian, after landing her stores,
proceeded to China for teas, and did not arrive in England until
some months after the Pitt had sailed. Dundas was consequently
quite in the dark, and had, when he wrote the despatch quoted
above, no later advices from Sydney before him than those of
April, 1790, of which Lieutenant P. G. King was the bearer. He
was, perhaps, too sanguine in placing so much reliance upon the
flour intended to be sent from Calcutta. It appears that in
August, 1790, some Indian merchants, having heard of the wreck of
the Guardian, proposed to Dundas, through Lord
Cornwallis&mdash;Governor-General of India&mdash;to furnish the
settlement with stores. About the same time Dundas wrote to Lord
Cornwallis informing him that it was intended to send one of the
transports to Calcutta for this express purpose, after she had
landed her convicts at Sydney. The letters crossed. Cornwallis,
relying upon the return of the transport, took no further action
in the matter. Dundas, on the other hand, concluded that
Cornwallis had contracted with the merchants for the hire of a
storeship. Hence it was that no provisions were removed from
India until 20th June, 1792, when the transport Atlantic,
despatched to India by Phillip, returned to Sydney with a cargo
of flour and grain.</p>
<p>Phillip wrote to Dundas on the 19th March, 1792, reporting the
arrival of the Pitt, and ten days later he explained matters in a
letter to Under Secretary Nepean. The population of the
settlements at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island at this time
numbered 4,192, <a href="#note-422" name="noteref-422" id=
"noteref-422">{13}</a> and Phillip felt it his duty to point out
that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"A great quantity of provisions are consumed daily by
such a number of people, and nine or twelve months' provisions
brought by the transports for the three or four hundred convicts
they are bringing out last but a short time when divided amongst
such numbers." <a href="#note-423" name="noteref-423" id=
"noteref-423">{14}</a></blockquote>
<p>The supplies brought by the Pitt were as a drop in the ocean
in comparison with the wants of the settlement; they did not
enable the Governor to make any increase in the ration. The
position of affairs as regards the supply of food and the
incapacity of the people for work was stated in language that
could not be misunderstood. At the low ration then issued there
was only enough flour in store for fifty-two days, and pork for
one hundred and forty-seven days; the only hope of replenishing
the stores rested in the Atlantic, which had been sent from
Sydney to Calcutta, and the vessel that was to follow the Pitt
from England. It was impossible to say how long the Atlantic
would be in making the voyage to India and getting back to Port
Jackson; and it was equally uncertain when the storeship from
England would arrive. The people had learned from painful
experience that delays frequently took place in despatching
vessels from England, and that unreasonably long voyages were
sometimes made. They had also a vivid recollection of the
disaster which overbook the Guardian, and were sorely troubled by
the conviction that if the ships should fail they would be
brought to the point of starvation. So keen was the anxiety that
Phillip made arrangements for the Pitt, which was going to India
after taking convicts to Norfolk Island, to call at Calcutta,
and, if the Atlantic had not been heard of, to receive on board a
cargo of provisions and return to Port Jackson with all speed.
Fortunately, however, her services were not required.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which the Pitt was sent from England
were not realised by the Governor at once. When she was unloaded,
he discovered that, although she had on board only a small
quantity of provisions for public use, she had brought out four
thousand pounds' worth of goods, which were sold privately in the
settlement. Besides this, she had articles on board which the
Commissary was obliged to purchase. It also appears that public
stores, placed on board in the first instance, were sent on shore
to make room for "private trade". Phillip called attention to the
facts in a despatch written seven months after the arrival of the
vessel, but not with the indignation the circumstances would have
justified. <a href="#note-424" name="noteref-424" id=
"noteref-424">{15}</a></p>
<p>The Pitt was despatched at a critical time. If she had been
well provisioned, the colony, on her arrival, would have
experienced material relief; sent out as she was, with only a
small quantity of salt provisions for the public stores, and a
considerable number of convicts, she brought only disappointment
and vexation.</p>
<p>In striking contrast to other accounts of the state of the
settlement at, and immediately following, the arrival of the Pitt
was the first letter which Grose wrote to England; it was
addressed to his friend Evan Nepean. He thus describes his early
impressions of the colony:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am at last, thank God, safely landed with my
family at this place, and, to my great astonishment, instead of
the rock I expected to see, I find myself surrounded with gardens
that flourish and produce fruit of every description. Vegetables
are here in great abundance, and I live in as good a house as I
wish for. I am given the farm of my predecessor, <a href=
"#note-425" name="noteref-425" id="noteref-425">{16}</a> which
produces a sufficiency to supply my family with everything I have
occasion for. In short, all that is wanting to put this colony in
an independent state is one ship freighted with corn and black
cattle. Was that but done, all difficulties would be over."
<a href="#note-426" name="noteref-426" id=
"noteref-426">{17}</a></blockquote>
<p>While Collins was writing gloomy passages in his notebook, and
even the sanguine Phillip was sending to England despatches
pointing out the distressed condition of the people and the alarm
which was felt, Grose painted everything <i>couleur de rose</i>.
As he had, at the time of writing, been in the colony six or
seven weeks, the tone of his letter can only be explained on the
supposition that he did not know what was going on around him. It
is true that he was stationed at Sydney, the head-quarters of the
Corps, and therefore did not see the weak and emaciated convicts
fainting at their work and "daily dropping into the grave";
<a href="#note-427" name="noteref-427" id="noteref-427">{18}</a>
but these things, one would have thought, were the common talk of
the settlement. He must have known, at any rate, that the people
were living on a scanty allowance of food, for at that time every
one shared alike&mdash;the Governor received no more from the
public stock than the meanest convict. Only a few months later,
in fact, he made a complaint to the War Office that the officers
and men of the New South Wales Corps were treated no better than
the convicts. <a href="#note-428" name="noteref-428" id=
"noteref-428">{19}</a> Whether it was that he had brought from
England extra supplies, which rendered him for a time independent
of the food issued from the public store, or that the produce of
his farm kept him in plenty, it is certain that his opinion
changed considerably within a few months. In April he was in
possession of everything he wanted; in October he joined with
other officers of the Corps in chartering the Britannia to go to
the Cape for supplies, and wrote a letter to Phillip begging him
to facilitate the movements of the ship, so as to assist him and
his brother-officers to "escape the miseries of that precarious
existence we have hitherto been so constantly exposed to."
<a href="#note-429" name="noteref-429" id=
"noteref-429">{20}</a></p>
<p>This effort on the part of the military officers to procure
supplies which the ration issued from the stores did not afford,
was regarded by Phillip with disfavour. He admitted that the
garrison "suffered many inconveniences from the necessary
supplies not arriving", but he was unable to see the necessity,
and doubted the propriety, of taking the step proposed. He was
afraid that the course the officers proposed to pursue would be
regarded by the East India Company as an infringement of its
privileges, and he had no wish to bring the colony into conflict
with that powerful organisation. He thought the officers should
be content to receive such necessaries as they might obtain by
sending orders to India or the Cape, availing themselves of the
opportunities afforded by the arrival of the vessels under
contract with the Government. He did not veto the scheme, but he
refused to give it official sanction. <a href="#note-430" name=
"noteref-430" id="noteref-430">{21}</a> If he had foreseen that
this voyage of the Britannia to the Cape was the prelude to a
system under which the military officers became purveyors to the
settlement and the monopolists of trade, he would probably have
opposed the scheme more actively, although, as he himself
admitted, he could not prevent it. <a href="#note-431" name=
"noteref-431" id="noteref-431">{22}</a> It does not appear that
any objection was raised either by the British Government or the
East India Company, for we find Grose writing to Dundas on the
3lst August, 1794, informing him that the Britannia had been
engaged by the civil and military officers to bring a second
shipment of stores and cattle from the Cape.</p>
<p>While the arrival of the relief vessel was awaited, the people
lived in a state of suffering and suspense almost as intolerable
as that they had undergone two years before, when the wreck of
the Guardian, and the delay in the voyage of the Lady Juliana,
brought the settlement to the verge of starvation. The ration was
reduced month by month, Until it stood thus:&mdash;One pound and
a half of flour, five pounds of maize, and four pounds of pork
for each man per week. Women and children received a
proportionately smaller ration. Even this small allowance of food
was less than it looked on paper, for the maize was issued
unbroken, and in grinding it with the rude appliance available
about a quarter was lost. <a href="#note-432" name="noteref-432"
id="noteref-432">{23}</a> The ration of pork represented rather
more than half a pound of animal food per diem; but if the salt
meat served at this time was no better than that generally
supplied, the half-pound was practically no more than a few
ounces. These three articles&mdash;flour, maize,
pork&mdash;constituted the food supply of the settlement; and
from the Governor downwards the ration received by every man was
the same. The civil and military officers, and others who had the
means, were able to supplement their allowance with game and
fish, obtained in small quantities, and with luxuries purchased
from the masters of the transports, who sold their goods at
exorbitant prices.</p>
<p>But the bulk of the people had only the ration, and they were
half-starved. The healthy suffered severely&mdash;the sick
perished. In the despatches little is said about the miseries of
the people, but Collins's account enables one to form some idea
of the deplorable condition of things in the settlement at this
time. Many of the convicts who arrived by the vessels of the
Third Fleet had never recovered from the privations they endured
on the voyage, and died in great numbers. During the month of
November, 1791, fifty-four of these convicts died, and at the end
of it five hundred were still under medical treatment. The total
number of deaths during the year was one hundred and seventy-one.
<a href="#note-433" name="noteref-433" id="noteref-433">{24}</a>
In the seven months following the arrival of the Third Fleet no
less than two hundred and eighty-eight deaths occurred, the
record for the previous seven months being but nineteen. The
sick-list, on the 29th March, 1792, was four hundred and
twenty-nine, of whom only eighteen were free. <a href="#note-434"
name="noteref-434" id="noteref-434">{25}</a> The month of April,
1792, opened, according to Collins, "with a dreadful sick-list,
and with death making rapid strides amongst us." <a href=
"#note-435" name="noteref-435" id="noteref-435">{26}</a> At the
beginning of May only fifty of the male convicts brought by the
Queen in September, 1791, were living. The number landed is not
stated in the despatches, but Collins, in his Account of New
South Wales, gives it as one hundred and twenty-two. According to
the official list, the number embarked was one hundred and
seventy-five, <a href="#note-436" name="noteref-436" id=
"noteref-436">{27}</a> so that the survivors numbered less than a
third of the number sent out. During the year 1792 four hundred
and seventy-seven deaths were recorded; of these, much the
greater number took place during the first half of the year.
<a href="#note-437" name="noteref-437" id=
"noteref-437">{28}</a></p>
<p>While the mortality was at its height it seems to have
occurred to someone that the men who were dying from exhaustion
might possibly be saved if the meagre ration could be
supplemented with fresh animal food and vegetables. Special
efforts were made to procure game and fish for the sick, for whom
also a good supply of vegetables was obtained. These efforts met
with success, and the increase of fresh wholesome food speedily
reduced the death-rate. The settlement, however, still continued
in a most critical condition. If any accident had happened to the
relief vessels, calamity would have overtaken the settlement;
even prolonged delay in their arrival would have been disastrous.
Fortunately they both arrived in safety&mdash;the Atlantic from
Calcutta, and the Britannia from England&mdash;before the colony
had been reduced to extremity. On the 6th June "there was only a
sufficiency of flour in store to serve till the 2nd of July, and
salt provisions till the 6th of August following, at the ration
then issued; and neither the Atlantic, storeship, from Calcutta,
nor the expected supplies from England, had arrived." <a href=
"#note-438" name="noteref-438" id="noteref-438">{29}</a></p>
<p>The Atlantic anchored in Sydney Cove with a cargo of rice,
soujee, and dholl on the 20th June. <a href="#note-439" name=
"noteref-439" id="noteref-439">{30}</a> These stores were
anything but satisfactory. The soujee, an inferior sort of flour,
<a href="#note-440" name="noteref-440" id="noteref-440">{31}</a>
would not have been accepted by any but starving men, while the
dholl (Indian peas) was scarcely fit for consumption. No animal
food was brought by this vessel, except a few casks of salted
pork, sent as an experiment. Yet her arrival, according to
Collins, was the cause of "inexpressible joy". A "gleam of
sunshine penetrated everyone capable of reflection", and the
community was so excited that "we all felt alike, and found it
impossible to sit for one minute seriously down to any business
or accustomed pursuit." When people of all ranks were thrown into
raptures by the arrival of a vessel loaded with unpalatable food,
the situation of the colony may be understood.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of the Atlantic removed the immediate
prospect of starvation, the supplies from England were still
awaited with eagerness. As no animal food had been received, it
became necessary to reduce the allowance of pork per week from
four pounds to two&mdash;adding, as a set off, a pound of rice
and a quart of pease to the ration.</p>
<p>The Britannia, the long-expected storeship, arrived on the
26th July, 1792. She had sailed from England&mdash;not in the
autumn of 1791, as promised, but on the 15th February,
1792&mdash;seven months after the Pitt&mdash;and carried a good
supply of beef, pork, and flour. <a href="#note-441" name=
"noteref-441" id="noteref-441">{32}</a> The people were now put
upon a fair allowance of food, but it was still far below the
"established ration", which was equivalent to that allowed to
troops serving in foreign parts, with the exception of spirits.
<a href="#note-442" name="noteref-442" id="noteref-442">{33}</a>
For the present all anxiety was removed, and "universal
satisfaction" was felt. But had the Britannia been a month longer
on the voyage the allowance from the store would have been
reduced to a small quantity of vegetable food, and meat would
have disappeared altogether from the ration. <a href="#note-443"
name="noteref-443" id="noteref-443">{34}</a></p>
<p>The inferior cargo brought by the Atlantic gave Indian
provisions a bad name in the settlement, but it was soon
discovered that stores of good quality could be obtained from
Calcutta and Bombay. Early in 1793 the Shah Hormuzear, sent from
Calcutta with a cargo of provisions as a speculation, arrived at
Sydney, and supplies beings still low, her cargo was purchased
and added to the public stock. Before this was done the
provisions were examined by the Commissary, who reported that,
with the exception of the salted meat, all the articles were
superior in quality in any that had previously reached the
colony. Grose's opinion of the salted meat was that, although
inferior to Irish-cured provisions, it was "not so bad but it
might be eaten." On the other hand, every article brought by the
Atlantic was unfit to be served as a ration except to people who
were unable to obtain food of any sort. Finding how vast was the
difference between the Atlantic's cargo and that sent as a
speculation by the Shah Hormuzear, Grose, adopting the advice of
Lord Cornwallis, <a href="#note-444" name="noteref-444" id=
"noteref-444">{35}</a> would have preferred to await the arrival
of another private shipment, rather than order a cargo from
India; but the small quantity of stores in hand obliged him, in
1793, to send the Britannia to Calcutta for provisions, and he
suggested to Lord Cornwallis that a survey of them should be made
before they were accepted, recommending, at the same time, that
the master of the vessel, who had had long experience in the
Navy, should be one of the examiners.</p>
<p>There was now (July, 1792) comparative plenty in the
settlement, but the food was coarse and unpalatable; for the sick
convicts whom Phillip was trying to rescue from death nothing
could have been more unsuitable. One of the items of the
"established ration" was butter, but this article had not been
supplied for a long time. That sent out in the first ships was
rancid when issued from the store. Whether the cause was the
length of the voyage or bad curing does not appear, but it was
decided that butter was not a substance that could be used with
advantage, and oil was substituted. <a href="#note-445" name=
"noteref-445" id="noteref-445">{36}</a> Accordingly, a quantity
of oil was put on board the Royal Admiral and the Kitty, the
vessels which followed the Britannia. But the oil was no better
than the butter; it could not be used as an article of diet, and
was even unfit for culinary purposes. It was employed instead of
candles, or it would have been wasted. <a href="#note-446" name=
"noteref-446" id="noteref-446">{37}</a></p>
<p>Shortly after the arrival of the Britannia, three vessels
entered the port&mdash;the Royal Admiral and the Kitty from
England, and the Philadelphia from America. From the master of
the Philadelphia, Phillip purchased a quantity of American beef,
while those who had the means bought what they could afford from
the miscellaneous stores with which the vessel was freighted.
<a href="#note-447" name="noteref-447" id="noteref-447">{38}</a>
The Royal Admiral arrived on the 7th October, 1792, with over
three hundred convicts. The Kitty arrived on the 18th November,
with only a few women; she sailed in March, but had to put back
to Spithead to stop a leak, and while in port eight of the ten
male convicts who were embarked made their escape. This was "an
unfortunate accident, for they had been particularly selected as
men who might be useful in the colony." <a href="#note-448" name=
"noteref-448" id="noteref-448">{39}</a></p>
<p>The Kitty had not arrived when Phillip wrote his last despatch
(11th October, 1792)&mdash;the last, at all events, that appears
in the Records. Although the official papers are not complete, it
seems probable that Phillip wrote no later despatch than that of
the 11th October. He had made up his mind early in the month to
return to England as soon as he had received permission to do so,
and he was anxiously awaiting instructions from England which
would enable him to get away by the Atlantic, the next vessel to
sail for England. If he missed this chance, he told Nepean in a
private letter, he did not see how he was to get home unless by
way of China or the north-west coast of America, "neither of
which would be very agreeable to a man going in search of
health".</p>
<p>Phillip's report on the Royal Admiral is brief and cautiously
worded; he evidently wrote under restraint. The mortality on
board this vessel, though slight compared with the destruction of
life which marked the voyages of the Second and Third Fleets, was
greater than it should have been, and many of the convicts
arrived in bad health, thus increasing the burden which the
settlement had to bear. Twelve convicts died on the passage, and
sixty-one were landed sick. This would have been considered bad
for any vessel, but there was a special ground for
dissatisfaction in this case. When the reports of the disastrous
voyages of the Neptune, Surprize, and Scarborough reached
England, the Home Department resolved to employ as transports in
future vessels belonging to the East India Company instead of
making contracts with English shipping firms, and the adoption of
this course, it was confidently expected, would put an end to the
shocking abuses which had thrown so much discredit on the
transportation system. The Royal Admiral was the first Indiaman
employed in the service, and her record was highly
unsatisfactory. In the case of some of the vessels which had come
out under different management, the great mortality and sickness
was caused by indifference and inhumanity. In this instance it
does not appear that the convicts were purposely ill-treated, but
the ship was too small for the number on board. The fact was
manifest to Phillip, who would have been justified in writing
strongly on the subject to the authorities in England, but he
contented himself with directing attention to the weak spot in
the mildest terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have no doubt but that strict justice has been
done them [the convicts], and hope the sending out convicts and
stores by ships employed in the service of the East India Company
will answer the end proposed by Government; but, sir, if I was to
give an opinion, I think the people have been too much crowded on
board this ship." <a href="#note-449" name="noteref-449" id=
"noteref-449">{40}</a></blockquote>
<p>Although the arrival of these vessels relieved the colony from
the fear of starvation, the days of plenty had not yet set in.
The full ration of meat was now issued, but, instead of seven
pounds of bread and one pound of flour, which formed part of the
established ration, the allowance was only two pounds of flour
and five pounds of rice. Without the latter article, which was
obtained in large quantities from India, the people would have
fared badly; but it was a poor substitute for flour. With the
full allowance of flour, if the quality was good, everyone was
satisfied; when rice took the place of flour there was
discontent. Unfortunately, the Kitty's cargo, particularly the
flour, <a href="#note-450" name="noteref-450" id=
"noteref-450">{41}</a> was damaged by the bad weather she
encountered, and it was for this reason, probably, that so small
a quantity was allowed in the ration, At the beginning of
December the allowance was increased to three pounds, and it
stood at that for some time. <a href="#note-451" name=
"noteref-451" id="noteref-451">{42}</a></p>
<p>Other necessaries were wanting besides food and clothing. The
progress of the settlement depended upon the cultivation of the
land, but after four years the deficient supply of The want of
ordinary tools of husbandry was still a cause for complaint.
<a href="#note-452" name="noteref-452" id="noteref-452">{43}</a>
The want of iron pots, which were required for cooking purposes,
was a standing grievance. It must be regarded as a supremely
ridiculous thing that the powerful organisation which had the
affairs of the colony in hand was unequal to the duty of
supplying the people with the commonest utensils. An effort was
made to meet the difficulty when the Kitty was sent out, but
while the greatest care was shown in ordering supplies, none
appears to have been taken in stowing the cargo. The consequence
was that a great many of the utensils sent by the Kitty were
destroyed before they reached their destination. <a href=
"#note-453" name="noteref-453" id="noteref-453">{44}</a> Seven
months later Grose complained of the want of common utensils and
tools. <a href="#note-454" name="noteref-454" id=
"noteref-454">{45}</a></p>
<p>One portion of the Kitty's shipment arrived safely, and was
very welcome, although it was not of so much importance as were
provisions, or even iron pots. It consisted of a quantity of
silver money in dollars, valued at &pound;1,001. Phillip had
asked in one of his early despatches (28th September, 1788) that
money might be sent out to pay the wages of the marine
artificers, "as bills would be attended with great loss and
inconvenience". In reply, Nepean stated, 20th June, 1789, that a
remittance would be sent by the Guardian, but the promise was not
kept. The precise reason is not given, but Under Secretary King,
who was acting for Nepean at the time, wrote on the 10th January,
1792, in forwarding the money by the Kitty, that "circumstances
interfered" to prevent its shipment by the Guardian. In the
meantime many of the artificers had become settlers, and wanted
money to pay their way; while a number of superintendents who had
been taken into the Government employment were also asking for
their wages. The absence of cash caused a good deal of trouble,
but Phillip did not say much on the subject in his despatches,
probably because wants of a more pressing nature occupied his
attention. The inconvenience was diminished a good deal, however,
by an expedient adopted by the Commissary, who issued notes on
himself, payable in cash or stores." <a href="#note-455" name=
"noteref-455" id="noteref-455">{46}</a></p>
<p>The money was sent in dollars instead of in coin of the realm,
because the dollar was the standard coin both at the Cape of Good
Hope and Batavia, the places with which the principal trade of
the colony was transacted.</p>
<p>It would be unnecessary to enter into the details given in the
preceding pages but for the fact that upon the quantity and
quality of the food supplied from the public stores the lives of
the people and the progress of the settlement depended.
Notwithstanding the enormous difficulties which were encountered,
owing to the landing of hundreds of sick convicts, and the
absence of proper persons to direct agricultural operations, the
land, even during the first few years, would have been turned to
good account if the working population had been supplied with the
necessaries of life. But, during the greater part of Phillip's
term, the convicts lived in a state of semi-starvation, and were
incapable of any considerable manual exertion. The failure which
attended Phillip's strenuous and persevering efforts cannot be
understood, nor can the responsibility for that failure be placed
where it should properly rest, unless the circumstances under
which the settlement was supplied with food and other necessaries
are carefully studied.<br>

Under extraordinary circumstances offenders have been treated
with equal rigour in recent times. In 1884, when the survivors of
the Arctic Exploring Expedition organised by the United States
Government were on the point of starvation, one of the party
stole food from the common stock, and having disregarded the
warnings he had received, was shot without trial of any kind, by

Sydney was indebted for the visit of this vessel, the first which
had arrived finder a foreign flag, to Lieutenant King. The
Philadelphia was at the Cape in July, 1791, when King was there
on his way out to Norfolk Island in the Gorgon. King suggested to
the master. Captain Patrickson, that it might prove a good
speculation to take out a cargo of provisions to Port Jackson,
and the latter fell in with the idea. Having taken the vessel to
England and discharged her cargo, he made the best of his way to
Philadelphia, reloaded, and sailed early in April for Sydney,
arriving on the 1st November. The facts are stated by Collins,

The arrival of the Royal Admiral led to trouble in the
settlement. Like most of the transports, she brought out articles
of private trade, and shops were opened at Sydney and Parramatta.
A license was also granted for the sale of porter. The result is
thus described by Collins:&mdash;"Under the cover of this,
spirits found their way among the people, and much intoxication
was the consequence. Several of the settlers, breaking out from
the restraint to which they had been subject, conducted
themselves with the greatest impropriety, beating their wives,
destroying their stock, trampling on and injuring their crops in
the ground, and destroying each other's property . . . . The
indulgence which was intended by the Governor for their benefit
was most shamefully abused; and what he suffered them to purchase
with a view to their future comfort, was retailed among
themselves at a scandalous profit; several of the settlers'
houses being at this time literally nothing else but
porter-houses, where rioting and drunkenness prevailed as long as
the means remained."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, pp. 240, 241.</p>

<h3>15. PHILLIP RESIGNS.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>ON</small> the 11th October, 1792, Phillip wrote to
Dundas, intimating that it had become necessary for him to give
up the charge of the Government, at least for a time, but as he
did not feel sure, from the nature of a communication he, had
just received, whether he had permission to return to England or
not, he had determined to "wait the arrival of the next ships".
<a href="#note-456" name="noteref-456" id="noteref-456">{1}</a>
He had been for some time anxious to return to England. In April,
1790, he applied for a year's leave of absence, to enable him to
attend to private affairs; and on the 25th March, 1791, he
renewed the request on the ground of ill-health. He had suffered
greatly from hard work, privation, and exposure, <a href=
"#note-457" name="noteref-457" id="noteref-457">{2}</a> and the
change was highly necessary. In November, 1791, finding himself
no better, he requested permission to resign the government, so
that he might return to England in hopes of finding that relief
which this country did not afford. It is to be noticed that, in
the letter written nearly a year later, Phillip did not speak of
resignation, but only pointed out that it had become necessary to
give up his charge, "at least for a time". He could not tell then
whether he would ever be able to go back to the work which
failing health obliged him to relinquish, but when he sailed from
Port Jackson in December, 1792, he left the colony never to
return. At Sydney his departure seems to have been regarded as
final. His intention to return to England, which was made known
about the end of October, excited, Collins says, "no small degree
of concern in the settlement". Phillip went on board the Atlantic
on the evening of the 10th December, and early the next morning
the vessel sailed for England. Collins gives a brief account of
his departure:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"His Excellency, at embarking on board the Atlantic,
was received near the wharf on the east side (where the boat was
lying) by Major Grose, at the head of the New South Wales Corps,
who paid him, as he passed, the honours due to his rank and
situation in the colony. He was attended by the officers of the
civil department, and the three marine officers who were to
accompany him to England. At daylight on the morning of the 11th
[December] the Atlantic was got under way, and by eight o'clock
was clear of the Heads." <a href="#note-458" name="noteref-458"
id="noteref-458">{3}</a></blockquote>
<p>The officers of marines referred to by Collins were
Lieutenants John Poulden (who was in charge of a small
detachment), Thomas Davey, and Thomas Timins. With the exception,
of Captain Collins, Judge-Advocate, and Captain-Lieutenant George
Johnston, the other officers of the Marine Corps, with the bulk
of the men, returned to England by the Gorgon and Supply, in
December, 1791. Captain-Lieutenant Johnston remained for the
purpose of taking command of the extra company which was raised
by Phillip from the marines who had been discharged, and was
attached to the New South Wales Corps. <a href="#note-459" name=
"noteref-459" id="noteref-459">{4}</a> Phillip took with him two
natives, who afterwards returned to the colony. <a href=
"#note-460" name="noteref-460" id="noteref-460">{5}</a></p>
<p>Phillip had now severed his connection with the colony, but
the work he had accomplished remained as a monument to his energy
and perseverance. He had overcome many difficulties, and when he
sailed for England there was a fair prospect of better times.
Notwithstanding the serious disadvantages under which the colony
laboured, leading to the failure of the plans he had formed,
considerable progress had been made during the last year of his
government, not only in the cultivation of the land, but in the
erection of buildings for the accommodation of the people. As
settlers presented themselves they were put in possession of

<br>
<p>Phillip had no time to write detailed reports on the progress
of agriculture; but Collins, who watched closely all that took
place, describes in his book how well the industrious settlers
fared. In May, "the settlers were found in general to be doing
very well, their farms promising to place them shortly in a state
of independence on the public stores in the articles of
provisions and grain." "Several of the settlers who had farms at
or near Parramatta, notwithstanding the extreme drought of the
season preceding the sowing of their corn, had such crops that
they found themselves enabled to take off from the public store,
some one and others two convicts, to assist in preparing their
grounds for the next season." <a href="#note-462" name=
"noteref-462" id="noteref-462">{7}</a> In June, according to the
same authority, the ground sown with wheat and prepared for maize
was of sufficient area, even if the yield per acre did not exceed
that of the previous season, to produce enough grain for a year's
consumption. <a href="#note-463" name="noteref-463" id=
"noteref-463">{8}</a></p>
<p>The last return relating to agriculture which was prepared
prior to Phillip's departure was dated 16th October, 1792. At
that time the total area under cultivation was 1,540&frac12;
acres; of this, 1,012&frac34; acres were on public account, and
527&frac34; belonged to settlers. In November, 1791, 780 acres
were in cultivation, so that, approximately, the area under
cultivation had been doubled in twelve months. These figures do
not include land which had been cleared of timber ready for
cultivation, consisting in 1791 of 138&frac12; acres, and in 1792
of 162&frac12; acres. <a href="#note-464" name="noteref-464" id=
"noteref-464">{9}</a></p>
<p>It may be said that agriculture, as an industrial pursuit, was
now fairly launched. All difficulties had not been surmounted,
but the chief obstacle&mdash;the want of food&mdash;had been
temporarily removed, and there was reason to suppose that minor
impediments, such as the want of tools and appliances, would soon
be overcome. There was one great drawback&mdash;the scarcity of
live stock. What the Government possessed was not enough, as
Phillip had pointed out, for one good farm, <a href="#note-465"
name="noteref-465" id="noteref-465">{10}</a> and there was no
immediate prospect of obtaining fresh importations. Phillip had
been obliged to place people on the land without giving them the
stock they had been promised, and he frequently referred with
regret to this circumstance in his despatches. On his departure
he gave some sheep to the settlers, for breeding purposes;
<a href="#note-466" name="noteref-466" id="noteref-466">{11}</a>
but some of them were undeserving of the kindness shown to them.
Instead of preserving the stock and allowing it to increase, they
bartered it for liquor or slaughtered it for food.</p>
<p>Although Phillip's despatches show that a large proportion of
the convict population was employed in erecting public buildings,
<a href="#note-467" name="noteref-467" id="noteref-467">{12}</a>
they contain little information as to the work done in this
direction during the year. It may be seen from Collins's account,
however, that a good deal was accomplished. In April, 1792, the
foundations of "two material buildings" were laid at
Parramatta&mdash;a town-hall and a hospital. The former was to
"include a market-place", for the sale of produce and general
merchandise. The hospital, which had two wards, was finished in
November, and was at once occupied; the town-hall was in progress
at the end of the year. In September the erection of new barracks
at Sydney, "on the high ground at the head of the Cove", was
commenced. <a href="#note-468" name="noteref-468" id=
"noteref-468">{13}</a> Among works of minor importance carried
out during the year, Collins mentions the building of brick huts
for the convicts, to take the place of the "miserable hovels
occupied by many", and the construction at Sydney of a tank
capable of holding nearly 8,000 gallons of water.</p>
<p>On the whole, the colony, when Phillip departed, was in a
better condition than might have been expected. It still suffered
from many disadvantages, but, considering the extraordinary
difficulties that were met with, the wonder is that so much had
been achieved. Phillip, at any rate, had no reason to reproach
himself. He had done his best, and he had done well. The
obstacles that were placed in his way by the errors of some and
the opposition of others, and the disappointments that came upon
him one after the other, were enough to sour the temper and damp
the courage of any ordinary man; but Phillip's equable
disposition and sanguine temperament enabled him to pass through
the trying ordeal with infinite credit to himself and profit to
the colony. No matter how great the difficulties, or how dark the
prospect, he never lost heart. His energy was unflagging, and he
spared no effort to promote the affairs of the settlement, giving
personal attention to matters which other men would have been
content to hand over to the care of subordinates. In dealing with
the obstruction offered by the marine officers, his prudence and
moderation averted a serious complication.</p>
<p>The value of Phillip's services can hardly be overestimated.
He founded a great colony, established branch settlements at
Norfolk Island, Parramatta, and Toongabbie, and, in the teeth of
enormous difficulties, brought nearly two thousand acres of land
into cultivation, placing the people in such a position that they
were able, shortly afterwards, to grow enough corn for their own
consumption. The country had been explored, so far as
circumstances would permit, and the establishment of new
settlements on the fertile banks of the Hawkesbury had only been
deferred because there was no one competent to take charge of an
important station so far removed from the seat of authority. It
must be borne in mind that the work done in Phillip's time was
performed by a population of less than four thousand men,
<a href="#note-469" name="noteref-469" id="noteref-469">{14}</a>
a large percentage of whom were soldiers, while a number were
employed as servants by the officers. Of the remainder, a great
many were sick and helpless, while the population, from November,
1789, to July, 1792, lived upon a short allowance of food, barely
sufficient sometimes to sustain life. Having regard to the
unfavourable and trying circumstances in which he was placed, it
must be allowed that Phillip, when he retired from the government
in broken health, had done far more than could have been
expected. He had struggled gallantly and successfully against
adverse conditions, and he returned to England with a high and
well-earned reputation.</p>
<p>Although he had left the colony, he was still Governor of New
South Wales, but a few months after his arrival in London he sent
in his resignation. Life in a convict settlement a hundred years
ago was certainly attended with many undesirable surroundings,
and yet Phillip seems to have written the letter which put an end
to the connection with a great deal of reluctance. Writing to
Dundas on the 23rd July, 1793, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It is, sir, with the greatest regret that I ask to
resign a charge which, after six years' care and anxiety, is
brought to the state in which I left it. But I have the
consolation of believing that I have discharged the trust reposed
in me to the satisfaction of his Majesty's Ministry, and hope
that I may still be of service to a colony in which I feel myself
so greatly interested." <a href="#note-470" name="noteref-470"
id="noteref-470">{15}</a></blockquote>
<p>This letter conveys the impression that he would have liked to
go on with the work he had commenced so well, but the state of
his health put his return to the colony out of the question. He
had endured privations which the Governor of the colony had to
bear in common with everyone else; he had been severely wounded
with a spear thrown by a native at Manly; and he had suffered
from exposure to the weather on exploring expeditions. His
constitution was shaken. He was troubled, moreover, with an
ailment which required treatment that could not be obtained in
the colony, and, acting upon professional advice, he determined
to remain in England.</p>
<p>His resignation was accepted by the British Government with
regret, and his services were acknowledged by the grant of a
pension of &pound;500 per annum, equal to one-half of the salary
he had enjoyed as Governor. This well-earned reward was not the
only mark of favour he received. When he left England he was
Post-Captain in the Navy; after his return he was advanced to the
rank of Admiral, a position which he held until his death, on
31st August, 1814. <a href="#note-471" name="noteref-471" id=

<h3>16. LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR GROSE. <small>[1792-4]<br>
<br>
A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>ON</small> Phillip's departure the direction of affairs
passed into the hands of Major Grose, Commandant of the New South
Wales Corps and Lieutenant-Governor of the colony. <a href=
"#note-472" name="noteref-472" id="noteref-472">{1}</a> The
arrangement was a temporary one, rendered necessary by the
circumstances which obliged Phillip to return to England before
his successor had been appointed, but it lasted for two
years&mdash;from the 11th December, 1792, to the 17th December,
1794. There is no reason to suppose that Grose wished to become
Governor of the colony, or that his appointment to that office
was contemplated by the Government. Nothing had occurred to bring
about a change in the policy originally pursued, under which the
control of the settlement was placed in the hands of a naval in
preference to a military officer, and it must have been well
understood by Grose that the supreme power would rest in his
hands for only a limited period. In these circumstances it might
have been expected that he would have administered affairs as
nearly as possible on the lines laid down by his predecessor, in
accordance with the Commission and Instructions from which
authority was derived. Instead of doing that, one of his first
public acts was to introduce into the administration of civil
affairs the forms and procedure peculiar to a military
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>. <a href="#note-473" name="noteref-473" id=
"noteref-473">{2}</a></p>
<p>Justice had been administered by Phillip in accordance with
the letter and spirit of his Commission and Instructions. Serious
crimes, for which capital punishment might be inflicted, were
dealt with by the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction; <a href=
"#note-474" name="noteref-474" id="noteref-474">{3}</a> minor
offences were inquired into by Justices of the Peace, whose
decisions were reported to the Governor.</p>
<p>The Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, and Judge-Advocate were
Justices of the Peace <i>ex officio</i>; but the ordinary
magisterial duties of the settlement were discharged by the Rev.
R. Johnson (Chaplain), Mr. Augustus Alt (Surveyor-General), and
Mr. Richard Atkins <a href="#note-475" name="noteref-475" id=
"noteref-475">{4}</a> (Registrar of the Vice-Admiralty Court),
who had been appointed Justices of the Peace by Phillip, under
the authority of his Commission. Major Grose did not touch the
Criminal Court, but with a stroke of the pen he abolished the
magistracy. He did not go so far as to cancel the appointments
Phillip had made, but he deprived the Justices of their powers,
and transferred the magisterial function to the officers of the
New South Wales Corps. The circumstances under which the change
took place, and the purpose with which it was made, are described
at length by the Judge-Advocate. <a href="#note-476" name=
"noteref-476" id="noteref-476">{5}</a></p>
<p>Whatever may have been the motive for making this vital
alteration in the government, it is apparent that it was done
deliberately. This is shown by the fact that the assumption of
office, which took place immediately after Phillip's departure,
and the promulgation of the order transferring the magisterial
duties at Parramatta from the Justices of the Peace to Captain
Foveaux, occurred simultaneously. Apparently, Grose, who was
aware two months before the event that he would be left in
charge, <a href="#note-477" name="noteref-477" id=
"noteref-477">{6}</a> had laid down in his mind the system upon
which he intended to administer the government. In all
probability he had consulted his staff on the subject. This is
the more likely, because the change of plan would necessarily
throw additional work upon the military officers, and work of a
distasteful kind. The marine officers in Ross's time refused to
have anything to do with the control of the criminal population,
notwithstanding Phillip's appeals for assistance; <a href=
"#note-478" name="noteref-478" id="noteref-478">{7}</a> but
Grose's innovations entailed far more trouble to the military
than would have been caused by compliance with Phillip's simple
request to the marine officers that they would keep an eye on the
convicts, and communicate the result of their observations. It
can scarcely be doubted that a consultation of some sort took
place, and that Grose was assured of the support of his officers
before he ventured upon so radical a change in the form of
government.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are not in possession of Grose's reasons for
doing away with the civil authority. They ought to have been
communicated to the British Government at the earliest
opportunity; but neither in the first despatch written by Grose
in his capacity of Lieutenant-Governor, nor in any other
communication that has been discovered, is there a word on the
subject. In his first despatch to Dundas, 9th January, 1793,
<a href="#note-479" name="noteref-479" id="noteref-479">{8}</a>
Grose reported his assumption of the government, and referred to
various matters of more or less consequence; but there is not
even a hint in this communication that he had made any material
change in the government.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that Grose endeavoured to hide from
the British Government the important change he had made; whatever
weak points he had, Grose was straight-forward in his dealings.
His letters and despatches show that he was always ready to speak
his mind. Besides, concealment would have been impossible. Copies
of the Orders issued would doubtless be sent to England, and
there was a constant stream of correspondence between the
officials at Sydney Cove and their friends in England. Many of
the letters sent Home found their way into the newspapers, and a
matter of this sort could not have escaped attention. It is not
likely that Grose attempted to deceive anyone. Strange as it may
appear at this time, when the consequences of his ill-considered
action are understood and realised, the fact seems to be that
Grose considered it unnecessary to report to the Home Office the
alterations he had introduced. He appears to have regarded it as
a matter of local administration, chiefly affecting the convicts,
which did not concern the authorities in England; and as the
military command and the Governorship of the colony were now
vested in one and the same person, he apparently thought that it
was no longer necessary to keep up the distinction between the
civil and the military authority. If he had examined Phillip's
Commission of April, 1789, <a href="#note-480" name="noteref-480"
id="noteref-480">{9}</a> as it was his duty to do, seeing that he
had been called upon to administer the affairs of the settlement
under its authority, he would have found that in superseding the
civil magistrates he had been guilty of disobedience to the
authority under which he acted. It was never the intention of the
British Government to invest the military with the functions that
properly belonged to the civil tribunals. The Courts of Criminal
and Civil Jurisdiction were constituted by Letters Patent under
an Act of Parliament; the establishment of a Magistrate's Court
was provided for in Phillip's Commission, which contained this
clause:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"And we do hereby authorise and empower you to
constitute and appoint Justices of the Peace, coroners,
constables, and other necessary officers and ministers in our
said territory and its dependencies, for the better
administration of justice, and putting the law in execution, and
to administer, or cause to be administered, unto them such oath
or oaths as are usually given for the execution and performance
of offices and places."</blockquote>
<p>Letters Patent establishing the Courts of Law <a href=
"#note-481" name="noteref-481" id="noteref-481">{10}</a> gave to
these Justices equal powers to those possessed by Justices of the
Peace in England.</p>
<p>It is clear, from these two documents, that the Government
contemplated the establishment in the colony of a civil
magistracy which should exercise the powers belonging to that
office under the English law. In appointing Justices, Phillip
carried out his instructions, and, until Grose interposed,
magisterial duties were discharged in the manner prescribed, and
the system had worked well. It is difficult to understand how
Grose came to overlook the fact that in abolishing the civil
magistracy he was in reality disobeying the Royal Instructions,
which were as binding upon the temporary administrator of the
government as they were upon the Governor to whom they were
issued. If it had been intended that the colony should be subject
entirely to military rule, provisions for the appointment of
Justices of the Peace, who were to exercise the powers of English
magistrates, and in the same manner, would certainly not have
appeared in the Commission and Letters Patent. Grose either
misunderstood them, or regarded the employment of Justices as
something within the discretion of the Governor.</p>
<p>In so doing he incurred a great responsibility, of which,
however, he appears to have been quite unconscious. In other
matters he was over-cautious. Writing to Dundas on the 3rd
September, 1793, <a href="#note-482" name="noteref-482" id=
"noteref-482">{11}</a> he explained the circumstances under which
it had become necessary to buy food for the people, and
added:&mdash;"I cannot but be alarmed at all I purchase, and
everything I do, being unaccustomed to business, and fearful of
acting so much from my own discretion." It is singular, to say
the least of it, that an officer who was afraid to act upon his
own judgment in such a matter as the purchase of provisions,
should have issued, at the very first opportunity, an Order which
made a momentous change in the government of the country.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the change of government, Grose made an
alteration in the distribution of food from the stores. Under
Phillip's rule no distinction had been made between the free and
convict classes&mdash;every man, from the Governor downwards,
received the same quantity of provisions. This practice, which
had commended itself to Phillip's humanity, was highly
disapproved of by Grose; and he made it the subject of one of his
earliest complaints to the War Office. <a href="#note-483" name=
"noteref-483" id="noteref-483">{12}</a> Of course, if the full
ration had been served to all, there would have been no cause for
dissatisfaction; but Grose protested against a system under which
reductions were made to apply to the soldiers as well as to the
convicts. And, accordingly, when he took Phillip's place, he lost
no time in making a change. In his second despatch to Dundas,
16th February, 1793, <a href="#note-484" name="noteref-484" id=
"noteref-484">{13}</a> he announced that he had "considered it
expedient, while on a reduced ration, to make some little
distinctions between the convicts and the civil and military
people." When the full ration could be issued, he explained, no
difference would be made. The "little distinctions" applied to
two articles&mdash;flour and rice&mdash;the former being the most
important article issued from the public store. Shortly before
sailing for England, Phillip had fixed the weekly ration of flour
and rice at 3 lb. of the former and 5 lb. of the latter. The
alteration made by Grose was that the civil and military
officers, soldiers, superintendents, watchmen, overseers, and the
settlers from the marines were allowed 6 lb. of flour and 2 lb.
of rice per week, while the convicts and the settlers from the
convict class continued to receive 3 lb. of flour and 5 lb. of
rice. <a href="#note-485" name="noteref-485" id=
"noteref-485">{14}</a> This "little distinction" must have been
severely felt by the convicts. Flour, for which no satisfactory
substitute could be found, was the mainstay of the ration. The
quantity now issued to the military was below the full ration,
which consisted of 8 lb. per week; but that received by the
convicts was little better than a starvation allowance,
consisting, as it did, of less than half a pound a day. But they
fared still worse before the year had expired, for supplies
running short, the ration of flour or biscuit for the civil and
military was cut down to 2 lb. for seven days, while the convicts
received&mdash;for the first time since the establishment of the
colony&mdash;none whatever. <a href="#note-486" name=
"noteref-486" id="noteref-486">{15}</a></p>
<p>No notice was taken by the British Government of the new
policy adopted in giving the convicts a smaller ration than that
supplied to the rest of the people. Ministers had many matters of
far more importance on their hands, and they were probably
content to allow Grose, for the limited time he was in charge, to
govern the colony in his own way.</p>
<p>It may be contended by some that Grose was right in his belief
that the privations incidental to a newly-founded settlement
should not fall equally upon those who had injured and those who
were serving the State. Phillip, however, viewed the question
from another standpoint. The convicts, he contended, were
required to do active and laborious work in erecting necessary
buildings and in tilling the soil. The cultivation of the land
was an object of special importance. Men employed in this work
required a larger quantity of food than those engaged in the
duties which required little or no physical exertion, and a
reduction of the convicts' ration below that of the other classes
would have defeated, or at all events interfered with, the object
in view. There was another consideration. If good work was to be
got out of the convicts, it was necessary that they should not
only be well fed, but made contented with their lot. The
probability is that if Grose's plan had been acted upon at all
times, and under all circumstances, serious trouble would have
ensued. Fortunately, although the supply of food in Grose's time
was occasionally very low, the period of want was not prolonged,
and the danger that menaced the settlement soon passed away.</p>

"Major Grose was, after a time, succeeded as Lieutenant-Governor
br Captain Paterson, and during the principal part of the period
of the role of these two officers&mdash;nearly three
years&mdash;the government of the settlement was practically a
military despotism, of which the officers of the New South Wales
Corps were the administrators."&mdash;Bennett, History of
Australian Discovery and Colonisation, p. 171. Writing to Hunter
on the 5th July, 1798, the Rev. R. Johnson, Chaplain of the
Colony, said:&mdash;"But no sooner had Governor Phillip left ye
colony than I was convinced that the plan or measures of
Government were about to undergo an intire change. The civil
magistrates, within two days, received an order that their duty
would in future be dispensed with, and from that time until your
Excellency's arrival again in the colony everything was conducted
in a kind of military manner. This, I believe, was the first step
towards overturning all those attempts and endeavours that had
hitherto been planned and pursued for ye establishment of good
order to be kept up amongst the different ranks and orders of the
inhabitants of ye colony."</p>

<h3>17. FOOD SUPPLIES UNDER GROSE. <small>[1793]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>GROSE</small> found, as Phillip had done, that one of
the principal difficulties he had to contend with was the
impossibility of keeping up regular supplies of food. This was
owing partly to the intermittent nature of the supplies received
from England, and partly to the uncertainty and length of the
voyage. During the two years comprehended in Grose's
Lieutenant-Governorship the prospects were alternately bright and
gloomy. On one occasion such a quantity of stores were on hand
that a cargo of provisions offered by the owner of a trading
vessel, which arrived at Sydney on a voyage of speculation, was
refused; a year later the entire stock had been expended, and the
stores closed a few hours before the arrival of a storeship from
England, and there was actually nothing to save the people from
starvation but the maize in the fields.</p>
<p>At first Grose had no reason to feel anxiety. When Phillip
left Sydney, on the 11th December, 1792, the stock of food was
low, but on the 24th an American vessel, the Hope, arrived with a
cargo of provisions, which was purchased for the use of the
settlement; on the 16th of the following month the transport
Bellona entered the harbour with further supplies; and on the
16th February, 1793, Grose reported that, although he did not
feel justified in issuing a full ration, this was only a matter
of precaution, for the stores contained "five months' flour and
ten months' beef and pork, without including the wheat that is
reaped or the Indian corn we are about to gather." <a href=
"#note-487" name="noteref-487" id="noteref-487">{1}</a> At this
time the colony suffered very much from the want of tools and
implements, especially axes and saws, without which the clearing
of the land could not proceed. Shortly after the Bellona arrived,
the Shah Hormuzear came in with provisions, which were added to
the public stock. This vessel had been loaded at Calcutta with
the approval of the Governor-General of India, who seems to have
thought, according to Grose, that this mode of conveying stores
was preferable to taking up a ship." <a href="#note-488" name=
"noteref-488" id="noteref-488">{2}</a> The settlement was not at
this time in want of provisions, and there was every appearance
of an abundant harvest. But as the months went by without
bringing any fresh ships from England, the situation again became
critical; and to make matters worse, the crops, owing to the
dryness of the season, failed. "Our corn," <a href="#note-489"
name="noteref-489" id="noteref-489">{3}</a> said Grose, writing
on the 30th May, 1793, "which once flattered us with the most
luxuriant appearance, has, for want of timely rain, been parched
and withered to almost nothing, and instead of the twenty bushels
an acre which were expected, we must content ourselves with six."
<a href="#note-490" name="noteref-490" id="noteref-490">{4}</a>
While expressing uneasiness lest he might have been considered as
"too premature" in purchasing provisions, Grose pointed out that
but for the "accidental supplies" which these purchases comprised
"the colony would at this time experience the severity of a very
reduced allowance". He does not appear to have been aware that he
was expected to purchase the cargoes of food that might be
despatched from Calcutta, and that the British Government was
relying largely on the supplies which it was expected would be
sent from that place. <a href="#note-491" name="noteref-491" id=
"noteref-491">{5}</a> He was enlightened on the subject shortly
afterwards by the arrival of a despatch from Dundas; and in
August, no storeship having arrived from England, and, influenced
by the probability that war might interfere with the movements of
the transports, Grose chartered the Britannia, Mr. William Raven,
commander, and sent her to Calcutta for provisions. <a href=
"#note-492" name="noteref-492" id="noteref-492">{6}</a> Towards
the end of Jane it became necessary to cut down the ration. The
arrival of the Boddingtons on the 7th August did not improve the
condition of affairs, for she brought a number of convicts, but
very little food&mdash;salt provisions for only fourteen weeks at
the full ration. By the Boddingtons, information was received
that a sister-vessel, the Sugar-cane, might be expected almost at
once, but as she was supposed to be no better freighted with
provisions than the Boddingtons, the intelligence was not
received with much satisfaction. The Sugar-cane arrived on the
17th September with stores, but the quantity, as had been
supposed, was small. The voyages of this vessel and the
Boddingtons were remarkable for the fact that only one death
occurred among the convicts, and that there was scarcely any
sickness on board. <a href="#note-493" name="noteref-493" id=
"noteref-493">{7}</a> The convicts who came out by the
Boddingtons, according to Collins, bore testimony to the "humane
treatment" they had received from the master. Captain Chalmers,
and cheered him as they left the vessel for the shore. So far as
can be ascertained, the convicts on board the Sugar-cane were
treated with equal humanity; <a href="#note-494" name=
"noteref-494" id="noteref-494">{8}</a> but they were a disorderly
lot of men, and an attempt was made by a number of them to seize
the ship. Before they could put their design into execution the
mutineers were secured, and one of them hanged; the others were
punished with the lash. <a href="#note-495" name="noteref-495"
id="noteref-495">{9}</a></p>
<p>No other vessel arrived from England until the 10th March,
1794, when the William anchored in Sydney Cove with a large
supply of salt beef and pork, but no flour. On the same day a
small vessel, the Arthur, a brig of ninety-five tons, arrived
from Bengal with a cargo of salt beef, pork, sugar, and rum. The
salt meat was purchased by Government, while the sugar and rum
were sold to private persons. In the meantime the settlement had
suffered considerably from the short supply of food, particularly
flour.</p>
<p>Grose, who does not appear to have written any despatch to the
Home Department between the 12th October, 1793, and the 29th
April, 1794, reported in a communication of the latter date the
arrival of the William on the 8th March, 1794, and remarked that
all the provisions had been issued from the stores a few hours
before she was sighted. The stores having been replenished, Grose
was anxious to represent matters in the best possible light; he
informed the Secretary of State that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As all our provisions were issued from the stores
about six hours before she [the William] appeared in sight, I am
apprehensive that from this circumstance our situation may be
represented to be more desperate than it really was. It is,
therefore, requisite that I should inform you that our Indian
corn was at that time ripe, and that the publick and private
farms had yielded in such abundance as to secure us from any
other distress than that of being forced to live on bread only."
<a href="#note-496" name="noteref-496" id=
"noteref-496">{10}</a></blockquote>
<p>It may be doubted whether Grose would have taken up his pen in
the same cheerful state of mind if he had been obliged to live
for a few weeks or months on dry bread and dishes made from
Indian corn; and however he might have fared under such
conditions, the absence of animal food would have been severely
felt by the convicts, who had to labour in the fields. Collins
did not view the situation with any degree of complacency.
Writing of the state of affairs at the beginning of March,
shortly before the William arrived, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The provision-store was never in so reduced a state
as at this time; one serving of salt meat alone remained, and
that was to be the food of only half a week. After that period,
the prospect, unless we were speedily relieved, was miserable;
mere bread and water appeared to be the portion of by far the
greater part of the inhabitants of these settlements, of that
part, too, whose bodily labour must be called forth to restore
plenty." <a href="#note-497" name="noteref-497" id=
"noteref-497">{11}</a></blockquote>
<p>Collins, at all events, appreciated the hardship which would
have been caused by the absence of animal food, if Grose did not.
But when the Lieutenant-Governor told Dundas that the only
distress that would have been felt from the non-arrival of the
William would have been the necessity of living on bread alone,
he did not accurately describe the situation. It is true that
there was plenty of wheat and maize in the fields, but there was
no flour from which to make bread, and there were no adequate
means for turning the corn into flour. Hand-mills had been sent
out, but the number was small, and they were only capable, with
the expenditure of infinite labour, of grinding small quantities
of grain. Efforts had been made to erect large mills at Sydney
and Parramatta, but so far with indifferent success. To what
extent the colony was in a position to supply itself with "bread"
may be seen from Collins's narrative. In November, 1793, four
months before the crisis had arrived, the convicts for the first
time received a ration in which there was no flour or biscuit,
while the allowance of these articles of food to the free
population was reduced to two a pounds per week per head. Wheat
and maize were issued, but until the grain had been ground it
could not be made into bread. The convicts had, therefore, to
take their ration to the mills, and wait until they could obtain
the equivalent in flour or maize-meal. They had to wait a long
time. The mills were kept going night and day, but they were
unequal to the demands made upon them. Some of the convicts,
after spending the night at the mills in the vain expectation of
receiving a pound or two of flour, went to their work in the
morning with unground wheat and maize for food. <a href=
"#note-498" name="noteref-498" id="noteref-498">{12}</a> It is
evident from this that Grose's letter (from which Dundas would
naturally conclude there was abundance of bread in the
settlement) was calculated to convey a very erroneous
impression.</p>
<p>A month later the last of the flour had been used, and, as
regards this part of the ration, the civil and the military were
no better off than the convicts. <a href="#note-499" name=
"noteref-499" id="noteref-499">{13}</a> The arrangements for
grinding corn had now improved somewhat, but the mills were
overtaxed, and the people had to receive their grain coarsely
ground. In this shape it could not have been very palatable; but
there was plenty of it. To relieve the want caused by the
scarcity of animal food, a few hogs were slaughtered, and served
in place of salt pork. Fresh meat was an almost unheard-of
delicacy in the colony, <a href="#note-500" name="noteref-500"
id="noteref-500">{14}</a> and one would have thought that this
little change in diet would have been eagerly welcomed. Yet, if
Collins's account is correct, the people preferred salt pork to
fresh; not because they liked it better, but because it would
last longer.</p>
<p>The arrival of the William rendered it unnecessary to put the
people on a diet of bread and water, and before the provisions
she brought were exhausted two other storeships from England, the
Indispensable and Speedy, came into port, besides the Britannia,
which had been chartered to bring stores from India, but had been
obliged to change her course and go to Batavia instead. <a href=
"#note-501" name="noteref-501" id="noteref-501">{15}</a> The
Indispensable arrived on the 24th May. She was the first of a
fleet of six or seven ships which were to sail from England with
stores and provisions, and were expected to arrive in the course
of two months. The provisions and clothing she brought were
sufficient, with those received by the William, to supply the
wants of the colony for twelve months. <a href="#note-502" name=
"noteref-502" id="noteref-502">{16}</a> On the 8th June the
Speedy arrived with further supplies, and the stores were now so
well filled that when the Halcyon arrived a little later with a
cargo of provisions, spirits, &amp;c., from America, Grose
refused to make any purchases. The goods, however, were sold to
the officers. Another American vessel, the Hope, which arrived on
the 5th July, had to go back with her cargo unsold, except the
spirits, which were bought by the officers.</p>
<p>After the arrival of the Indispensable and Speedy, Grose
suffered no anxiety as to the maintenance of the people. But
before that he was in a position to write with confidence. In
acknowledging the receipt of the supplies brought by the William,
he told Dundas, 29th April, 1794, that if a few months' flour
were sent the colony would be able in future to supply itself
with bread. <a href="#note-503" name="noteref-503" id=
"noteref-503">{17}</a></p>
<p>The rapid improvement which had taken place in so short a time
in the food-producing power of the colony was attributed by Grose
to the energy which the civil and military officers, especially
the latter, had shown in cultivating the land which had been
allotted to them. The circumstances under which the land was
granted to these officers merit special mention.</p>

The amount expended by Grose in the purchase of this cargo, or
rather the sum for which he drew bills on the Treasury in London,
was &pound;9,603 5s. 6d. Collins thought it necessary to account
for so large a transaction with a private trader:&mdash;"Although
a supply of provisions had been lately received from England, it
was but a small one, and we were not yet in possession of that
plenty which would have warranted our rejecting a cargo of
provisions, particularly when brought on speculation. The hour of
distress might again arrive, and occasions might occur that would
excite a wish, perhaps in vain, for a cargo of provisions from
Bengal."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 271.</p>

They were certainly well fed and cared for. In reporting the
arrival of the Sugar-cane to Dundas, 12th October, 1793, Grose
says:&mdash;"The contractor, as well in this ship as the
Boddingtons, appears to have performed his engagement with great
liberality; and the prisoners they have conveyed prove by their
healthy appearance the extraordinary attention that must have

Collins attributes the mutiny to the fact that a small and
untrustworthy guard (a sergeant's party) was expected to keep
under control a peculiarly rebellious set of prisoners:&mdash;"As
intentions of this kind [the seizure of vessels by convicts] had
been talked of in several ships, the military guard should never
have been less than an officer's command, and that guard
(especially when embarked for the security of a ship full of wild
lawless Irish) ought never to have been composed either of young
soldiers or of deserters from other corps."&mdash;Collins, vol.

"Notwithstanding every supply of flour which had been purchased
or received into the store from England, it was at length
entirely exhausted; the civil and military receiving the last on
Monday the 9th [December, 1793]. This total deprivation of so
valuable, so essential an article in the food of man, happened,
fortunately, at a season when its place could in some measure be
supplied immediately, the harvest having been all safely got in
at Toongabbie by the beginning of this month. About the middle of
it, eight hundred bushels were threshed out, and on Monday the

a Bengal steer, both private property, were killed and issued to
the non-commissioned officers and privates of two companies of
the New South Wales Corps. This was but the third time that fresh
beef had been tasted by the colonists of this country; once, it
may be remembered, in the year 1788; and a second time when the
Lieutenant-Governor and the officers of the settlement were
entertained by the Spanish captains. At that time, however, had
we not been informed that we were eating beef, we should never
have discovered it by the flavour; and it certainly happened to
more than one Englishman that day, to eat his favourite viand
without recognising the taste. . . . The beef that was killed at
this time was deemed worth eighteenpence per pound, and at that

<h3>18. GROSE AND THE LAND.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> action of Lieutenant-Governor Grose in
issuing a number of land grants to civil and military officers
has been condemned by more than one writer. Because Phillip gave
no land to the officers, except small plots of garden-ground for
temporary use, while Grose issued grants to all who asked for
them, it has been assumed that during the latter's term of office
there was a sort of land scramble, in which the
Lieutenant-Governor and his friends acquired large estates. No
sooner had Phillip departed, says one writer, than "those who
possessed the power at once commenced to divide the spoil".
<a href="#note-504" name="noteref-504" id=
"noteref-504">{1}</a></p>
<p>Statements of this kind have been made under a grave
misconception. There was no such thing as a division of the
"spoil". In issuing grants to officers, Grose did nothing
improper. He did not even assume any responsibility; he simply
followed his instructions.</p>
<p>As the action taken by Grose in granting land to officers has
been contrasted with Phillip's omission to make grants of that
kind, it may be as well to repeat here the fact previously
stated&mdash;that Phillip had no authority to make grants to
officers. <a href="#note-505" name="noteref-505" id=
"noteref-505">{2}</a> If he had been authorised to give land to
the officers, he would certainly have done so. As his despatches
show, he had no objection to the officers having land; what he
declined to do was to give grants before he had received
authority to issue them. If, however, he had remained in the
colony a little longer it would have become his duty to issue
land grants to officers, for the despatch of 14th July, 1792,
<a href="#note-506" name="noteref-506" id="noteref-506">{3}</a>
giving the necessary power, was addressed to him, and arrived at
Sydney five weeks after his departure. It fell to Grose's lot as
administrator of the government to issue the first land grant to
an officer, and it seems to have been assumed from this fact that
the practice originated with him.</p>
<p>It is also implied that Grose not only did wrong in granting
land to officers at all, but that he disposed of the territory to
one class of the community in unduly large quantities. The second
supposition is as devoid of foundation as the first. An
examination of the lists of land grants issued by him shows that
he did not unduly favour the military class. In fact, so little
value was then placed upon the land that there appears to have
been no hesitation in granting it to whoever made application.
The grants to the officers, as a rule, did not exceed one hundred
acres; the maximum appears to have been one hundred and twenty
acres. There was one exception to the rule. Lieutenant Macarthur,
according to his own account, had nearly two hundred and fifty
acres in cultivation, in 1794, at Parramatta. He may have
purchased part of his land from settlers who wanted to get rid of
their grants, but in any case he had become entitled to an extra
grant for special services. Grose, finding the labour of
regularly visiting all the settlements too irksome, placed the
Parramatta District in Macarthur's hands, creating for him the
appointment of Inspector of Works, which he held in addition to
his position in the New South Wales Corps. In reply to a question
as to what salary should be attached to the appointment, Grose
was informed that the establishment must on no account be
increased. No additional salary could be given to Macarthur, but
he might be rewarded, Dundas wrote, by an extra grant of land, or
an extra allowance of convict servants. <a href="#note-507" name=
"noteref-507" id="noteref-507">{4}</a> It is probable that he was
rewarded in both ways. At all events, Macarthur, as a cultivator
of the land, soon left his brother-officers far in the rear.
Other settlers received much smaller grants. The private soldiers
were allowed, as a rule, twenty-five acres, although under the
instructions from England they were to receive eighty acres if
single, and one hundred acres if married. Some of the applicants
for land probably did not care to ask for a larger area than they
could conveniently manage.</p>
<p>Nothing was said in the despatch of 14th July, 1792,
concerning the area of land that might be granted to officers;
the only condition laid down was that allotments were to be made
"not with a view to a temporary but an established settlement
thereon; that is, comprehending such portions of land, and in
such situations as would be suitable for a <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i>
settler, should it ever come into the hands of such a person."
<a href="#note-508" name="noteref-508" id=
"noteref-508">{5}</a></p>
<p>Acting on this authority, Grose granted to each officer who
wished to take up land, allotments of one hundred acres, fifty
acres less than the area allowed, by Phillip's Additional
Instructions, to non-commissioned officers who had wives, and
thirty acres less than he was authorised to grant to unmarried
non-commissioned officers. <a href="#note-509" name="noteref-509"
id="noteref-509">{6}</a> The result was seen immediately.</p>
<p>Grose reported on the 16th February, 1793, <a href="#note-510"
name="noteref-510" id="noteref-510">{7}</a> five weeks after the
instructions had reached him, that the officers were making rapid
progress with their farms. He informed Dundas that they were
doing this "at their own expense", and that he expected in six
months to see them with cultivated areas "more than equal to a
third of all that has ever been cleared in the colony". To convey
a correct impression, Grose ought to have stated that each
officer was allowed the services of ten convicts, victualled and
clothed from the public store free of any charge; and that, in
addition, they were allowed to purchase the services of gangs of
convicts, when not employed on Government work, paying for the
same with spirits or other articles.</p>
<p>Seven months later (September, 1793) Grose reported that the
officers were "daily clearing ground to a considerable extent".
With his despatch of the 29th April, 1794, he sent a report from
the Surveyor-General, which showed that since Phillip's departure
2,962&frac14; acres had been put in cultivation, of which 982
acres belonged to the civil and military officers. In reporting
the condition of the colony at this time (April, 1794), Grose
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"When Governor Phillip left this country the military
officers were suffering in huts of the most miserable
description. I have now the satisfaction to say they are all in
good barracks. <a href="#note-511" name="noteref-511" id=
"noteref-511">{8}</a> We have three large mills at work, and you
will perceive by the Surveyor-General's return that two thousand
nine hundred and sixty-two acres and one-quarter of ground have
been cleared during my command." <a href="#note-512" name=
"noteref-512" id="noteref-512">{9}</a></blockquote>
<p>Grose was justified in writing thus confidently of the
condition and prospects of the colony. The difficulties attending
a deficient food supply had been removed, cultivation was
proceeding at a rapid rate, and live stock was increasing.
<a href="#note-513" name="noteref-513" id="noteref-513">{10}</a>
At about the same time as the officers began to engage in
agriculture (February, 1793) the first free settlers from
England, who had arrived by the Bellona, were placed upon the
land. This vessel was to have brought out the Quaker families
which Sutton had agreed to send, but that proposal, for the
reasons stated on a previous page, <a href="#note-514" name=
"noteref-514" id="noteref-514">{11}</a> was not carried out. The
Bellona brought instead of the Quakers five settlers of the
farmer class and their families; a millwright named Thorpe, who
had been engaged at a salary of &pound;100 per annum; and a
former resident, Walter Broady, or Brody, who returned to the
colony as master-blacksmith. These people having been offered
their choice of land, selected a level spot near Parramatta, to
which they gave the appropriate name of Liberty Plains. <a href=
"#note-515" name="noteref-515" id="noteref-515">{12}</a> This
settlement was not altogether a success. The settlers fell into
an error which seemed to be common at the time&mdash;they sowed
their wheat too late&mdash;and when the crop failed they
attributed their disappointment to the unproductiveness of the
soil, instead of to their ignorance of the seasons. They were of
opinion, Collins says, "that they had made a hasty and bad choice
of the situation", but this, he remarks, "was nothing more than
the language of disappointment."</p>
<p>It has been assumed that settlement in Grose's time was
conducted in a haphazard way, but the supposition is not borne
out by facts. Although the despatches throw no light on the
subject, the narrative of Collins shows that in settling
agriculturists on the soil, Grose located them in accordance with
a definite plan. One of his ideas was to form a chain of farms
between Sydney and Parramatta, the object being to bring the two
centres of population into communication with each other. Most of
the grants issued in the early part of 1793, after authority had
been received to give land to the officers, were made in
accordance with this design. <a href="#note-516" name=
"noteref-516" id="noteref-516">{13}</a> In October a number of
convicts were set to work at Petersham, now a flourishing suburb
of Sydney, where sixty acres of Government ground were cleared of
timber, twenty of which were sown with Indian corn. <a href=
"#note-517" name="noteref-517" id="noteref-517">{14}</a> In
December, 1793, a settlement was made on the Parramatta River,
not far from the spot where the Northern Railway bridge now spans
it. The place was named Concord, presumably because it was
occupied by settlers from the civil and the military classes.
<a href="#note-518" name="noteref-518" id="noteref-518">{15}</a>
Little information with regard to these settlements is to be
obtained from Grose's despatches, which give only an outline of
events occurring during his term of office. Unlike Phillip, who
took a keen interest in everything that pertained to the
settlement, and kept the Home Department well informed even as to
matters of detail, Grose seems to have given only a general view
of affairs, and reduced his despatches to the smallest possible
compass. His communications to the Home Department, which are
brevity itself compared with the letters of Phillip, present a
striking contrast to those of the Governors who administered
affairs during the decade 1795-1805. Hunter and King were
inclined to err on the side of prolixity; Grose erred in the
opposite direction.</p>
<p>In January, 1794, shortly after the allotment of farms at
Concord, a settlement was formed on the banks of the Hawkesbury.
Phillip, it will be remembered, had contemplated the
establishment of a convict settlement at this place, but had
postponed the design because there was no competent
superintendent whom he could put in charge. For the same reason,
possibly, Grose did not send convicts to the Hawkesbury in the
first instance. <a href="#note-519" name="noteref-519" id=
"noteref-519">{16}</a></p>
<p>The new settlement was a decided success. Three months after
the first landowners had gone into possession, Grose wrote to
Dundas, 29th April, 1794:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have settled on the banks of the Hawkesbury
twenty-two settlers, who seem very much pleased with their farms.
They describe the soil as particularly rich, and they inform me
whatever they have planted has grown in the greatest luxuriance."
<a href="#note-520" name="noteref-520" id=
"noteref-520">{17}</a></blockquote>
<p>Collins, under date of April, 1794, made the following
allusion to these pioneer settlers upon the banks of the
Hawkesbury:&mdash;"The best reports continue to be received. . .
. Everywhere the settlers found a rich black mould of several
feet in depth, and one man had in three months planted and dug a
crop of potatoes." <a href="#note-521" name="noteref-521" id=
"noteref-521">{18}</a></p>
<p>Although the land at and near Parramatta, according to
Superintendent Burton's report, <a href="#note-522" name=
"noteref-522" id="noteref-522">{19}</a> was of fair
quality&mdash;a fact established by Macarthur's success&mdash;it
was certainly less productive than the rich soil on the banks of
the Hawkesbury. Agriculture at Liberty Plains had not been
successful, and in consequence eager eyes were turned to the
Hawkesbury, where a crop of potatoes had been grown in so short a
space of time. Grose's brief reports were of the most encouraging
nature. On the 5th July <a href="#note-523" name="noteref-523"
id="noteref-523">{20}</a> he spoke of luxuriant crops, and on the
31 st August he informed Dundas that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The settlers placed on the banks of the Hawkesbury,
being seventy in number, are doing exceedingly well. The ground
they have already in cultivation has all the appearance of
bearing better wheat than has yet been grown in the colony."
<a href="#note-524" name="noteref-524" id=
"noteref-524">{21}</a></blockquote>
<p>The seventy settlers increased in number rapidly, and the
district became before long the most productive of the
settlements&mdash;so far, at least, as maize was concerned. On
one point Grose was seriously in error. The settlers, it appears,
were unwilling at first to take up land on the Hawkesbury,
because they were afraid of the river overflowing its banks. The
apprehension was, probably, founded on the reports brought in by
the exploring party which examined the river during the winter of
1789. Phillip, who was at the head of the party, stated, in his
despatch of the 13th February, 1790, that the water near the head
of the river sometimes rose thirty feet above the ordinary level.
<a href="#note-525" name="noteref-525" id="noteref-525">{22}</a>
The traces of recent floods were plainly seen; large logs of
timber were lying in the branches of trees from thirty to forty
feet above the level at which the river then stood, <a href=
"#note-526" name="noteref-526" id="noteref-526">{23}</a> Grose
had perhaps not seen these reports, and there was, apparently, no
one at hand to give him trustworthy information on the subject.
No flood was known to have occurred since the foundation of the
colony, and, making a deduction from insufficient facts, he
arrived at an erroneous conclusion. Writing to Dundas, on the 5th
July, 1794, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The overflowing of the river, so very much
apprehended, and on which account the settlers did not wish to be
placed there, appears to be without foundation. This is
universally acknowledged to be the most rainy season that has
ever been experienced in the colony, and the river has but little
exceeded in any parts its natural limits." <a href="#note-527"
name="noteref-527" id="noteref-527">{24}</a></blockquote>
<p>For a time the settlers prospered exceedingly, raising large
crops from the fine rich mould of which Collins speaks so
admiringly; but before many years had gone by they learnt from
painful experience how destructive a Hawkesbury flood could be.
<a href="#note-528" name="noteref-528" id=
"noteref-528">{25}</a></p>
<p>On the whole, Grose had reason to be satisfied with the
progress that had been made in cultivation, especially as the
officers, upon whom he chiefly relied, were doing so well. The
assumption that Grose unduly favoured them in distributing the
land, rests, as already stated, on little or no foundation. But
although he did not give them more land than he supposed them to
be entitled to, he favoured them in another way by placing the
labouring population of the settlement practically at their
disposal. An ordinary settler was allowed one or two convicts,
supported at the public expense, to assist in the cultivation of
the land. Grose gave the officers ten each to begin with; in some
cases, according to the Rev. R. Johnson, more were allowed.
<a href="#note-529" name="noteref-529" id="noteref-529">{26}</a>
In the condition in which the colony then stood this liberal
allowance of labour was of more value than a grant of land of
unlimited extent. A settler having twenty thousand acres, but no
labour to employ upon it except that of his own hands, would have
been worse off than the holder of a hundred acres who received
the gratuitous services of ten men. It is evident, therefore,
than the officers were placed in a far better position than the
ordinary settlers; the great advantage they received in this way
made them, in fact, a privileged class.</p>
<p>Grose took this course for reasons which are explained in his
despatches to the Home Department. He had noticed the indolence
of many of the settlers, and the readiness with which some of
them parted with their land to obtain the means of leaving the
colony. He despaired of being able to derive any benefit from
this class of people, but he thought that if the officers were
encouraged to take up and cultivate land the production of grain
would be promoted, to the great advantage of the settlement.
Having no instructions on the subject, he gave effect to his
conviction in a very liberal manner. This liberality did not meet
with the approval of the British Government. In a despatch dated
30th June, 1793, <a href="#note-530" name="noteref-530" id=
"noteref-530">{27}</a> the omission made in the first instance
was repaired. The Lieutenant-Governor was informed
that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"All the civil and military officers may, as such, be
allowed two convicts each, to be maintained out of the public
stores for two years longer, but after that period they should
themselves maintain such as they are desirous of keeping. But
where grants of lands are made to such officers as at the same
time continue to receive their pay, it is but reasonable that
they should maintain such convicts as are granted for the
cultivation of their land, exclusive of the two allowed to them
as officers for two years, in the manner I have
mentioned."</blockquote>
<p>Grose was placed by this communication in a very unpleasant
position. He got over the difficulty by temporising, and left to
Hunter the disagreeable duty of taking from the officers the
labour which they had first regarded as a privilege, but had come
to look upon as a right. Replying on the 29th April, 1794, to
Dundas's despatch of the 30th June, 1793, Grose intimated that as
the concession had been made, and less than ten convicts each
would be unequal to the task of cultivating the farms of
officers, he would defer carrying out the directions until
further instructions on the point were received from England,
adding that but little inconvenience resulted from these men
being taken from the service of Government; and expressing a hope
that, as the produce raised by the officers had been of "much
public utility", the matter would be reconsidered, and the system
allowed to remain undisturbed.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the authorities in England, the convicts
should have been employed rather for the public advantage than
for the profit of individuals. Under Grose's plan, however, the
officers cultivated the land with the aid of convicts maintained
at the public expense, and then sold to the Government the
produce which, might have been raised by the same labour from the
public estate. It was eminently a one-sided arrangement, from
which the Government received no benefit whatever.</p>
<p>The point was seen clearly enough by the authorities of the
Home Department. Long before Grose could receive a reply to his
despatch, in which he intimated that the arrangement he had made
would go on until further instructions were received, he had left
the colony, and his communication was not answered until 10th
June, 1795, when the Duke of Portland, commenting on the
disproportion between the land cultivated by private individuals
and by Government, informed Hunter that the regulations which
Grose had been directed to observe in regard to convict servants
to be allowed to officers did not admit of any discretionary
construction. The reasons which Grose had assigned for deferring
the adoption of the regulations until further instructions
arrived from England were declared to be "insufficient and
erroneous". <a href="#note-531" name="noteref-531" id=
"noteref-531">{28}</a> No doubt the grantees of the land got more
labour out of the convicts than the Government would have done;
but still, if the men given to the officers had been employed on
the public land, the Government would, at least, have received
some return. Instead of that, the Government paid everything, and
received nothing. It was not likely that such a system would be
tolerated. The point was again pressed on Hunter's attention in a
despatch from Whitehall, dated August, 1796:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"It is not reasonable that the publick should feed
those convicts whose labour it gives to individuals, and should
afterwards purchase the produce of that labour. . . . The more
convicts that can be made over to individuals, and taken off the
store, the greater will be the advantage; but it must be
understood that those individuals, of whatever description, and
in whatever situation they may happen to be, who take the
convicts, must support them at their own expence, and must not be
suffered to receive the produce of the labour of the convicts at
the cost of the Crown."</blockquote>
<p>When Hunter received this despatch he had been administering
the Government for about eighteen months, but he had apparently
been unwilling or unable to bring the regulations as to convict
labour into accord with the directions of the Home Office. A year
later he received a despatch complaining of the heavy expenses
which had been incurred in the colony from the 1st June to 31st
August, 1796, amounting to &pound;40,000. At this rate of
expenditure the cost of maintaining the convicts in New South
Wales, according to the Home Office calculations, without
including that of the civil and military establishments of the
colony, was "more than two-thirds of what they would have been
kept for" in England. The main object with which the settlement
had been founded&mdash;relief from the large expenditure incurred
in maintaining the prisoners in the English gaols&mdash;had,
therefore, been defeated.</p>
<p>The Duke of Portland informed Hunter that he was satisfied the
greater part of the expense to which he so strongly objected had
arisen "from not adverting to the original purpose for which this
colony was established, and from the manner in which the convicts
and public provisions are disposed of." It was pointed out that
every convict supported for the benefit of individuals cost the
Government &pound;20 per annum, "and consequently the allowance
of thirteen convicts to each officer is an expense of &pound;260
per annum to Government, which is to be multiplied according to
the number of persons to whom that quota of convicts is allowed."
It would appear, therefore, that in addition to the two convicts
allowed by the instructions from Whitehall, the officers had
still the services of eleven each, one more than the number given
by Grose in the first instance. Hunter was strictly enjoined to
reduce the number to two, and some time after receiving the
despatch he issued an order to that effect. He experienced
considerable difficulty, however, in carrying out the
instructions of the Government, and abolishing the system which
Grose on his own responsibility had established. The
circumstances under which the change was made, and the
consequences resulting from it, will be dealt with at a later
stage.</p>

Historical Records, vol. ii, p. 226. Collins (vol. i, p. 265)
thus explains the reason for the appointment:&mdash;"In the
course of this month [January, 1793] the Lieutenant-Governor
judged it necessary to send an officer to Parramatta whom he
could entrust with the direction of the convicts employed there
and at Toongabbe in cultivation, as well as to take charge of the
public grain. This business had always been executed by one of
the superintendents, under the immediate inspection and orders of
the Governor, who latterly had dedicated the greatest part of his
time and attention to these settlements. But it was attended with
infinite fatigue to his Excellency; and the business had now
grown so extensive that it became absolutely necessary that the
person who might have the regulation of it should reside upon the
spot, that he might personally enforce the execution of his
orders, and be at all times ready to attend to the various
applications which were constantly making from settlers." Mrs.
Macarthur, in a letter dated 21st December, 1793, stated that her
husband had been appointed to "inspect or superintend the public
works. What advantage may accrue from this is at present
uncertain, but the Major, in his despatches to Government, has
strongly recommended them to confirm the appointment, and to
annex to it such a salary as they may conceive equal to the
importance of the trust."&mdash;Historical Records, vol. ii, p.

"occupied the whole of his time", and he had received no
allowance for the extra work.&mdash;Hunter to Portland, 28 April,

Grose issued one grant (twenty-five acres to Cummings) before the
arrival of the despatch authorising him to give land to officers.
Apparently, this was treated as a special case, but the
circumstances are not stated in the despatches, which do not even
mention the fact. Collins, however, notices the issue of the
grant on the 3lst December, 1792, and makes the following
comments (vol. i, p. 256):&mdash;"In the instructions for
granting lands in this country, no mention of officers had yet
been made; it was, however, fairly presumed that the officers
could not be intended to be precluded from the participation of
any advantages which the Crown might have to bestow in the
settlements; particularly as the greatest in its gift, the free
possession of land, was held out to people who had forfeited
their lives before they came into the country." According to
Collins, the first land taken up by officers was at a place known
then as the "Kangaroo" ground, "situate to the westward of the
town of Sydney, between that settlement and Parramatta", where
"allotments of one hundred acres each were marked out for the
clergyman (who, to obtain a grant here, relinquished his right to
cultivate the land allotted for the maintenance of a minister),
for the principal surgeon, and for two officers of the
corps."&mdash;Ib., p. 266.</p>

"The permission given to officers to hold lands had operated
powerfully in favour of the colony. They were liberal in their
employment of people to cultivate those lands; and such had been
their exertions that it appeared by a survey taken in the last

"The settlers who came out in the Bellona haring fixed on a
situation at. the upper part of the harbour above the Flats, and
on the south side, their different allotments were surveyed and
marked out; and early in this month [February, 1793] they took
possession of their grounds. Being all free people, one convict
excepted, who was allowed to settle with them, they gave the
appellation of 'Liberty Plains' to the district in which their
farms were situated. The most respectable of these people, and
apparently the best calculated for a <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i>
settler, was Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorsetshire, who came out
with his family, consisting of his wife and four children. An
allotment of one hundred and twenty acres was marked out for him.
With him came also Frederic Meredith, who formerly belonged to
the Sirius, Thomas Webb, who also belonged to the Sirius, with
his nephew, and Edward Powell, who had formerly been here in the
Lady Juliana transport. Powell having since his arrival married a
free woman, who came out with the farmer's family, and Webb
haring brought a wife with him, had allotments of eighty acres
marked out for each; the others had sixty each."&mdash;Collins,

the money which they had respectively received for their farms,
were permitted, with some others, to open ground on the banks of
the Hawkesbury, at the distance of about twenty-four miles from
Parramatta. They chose for themselves allotments of ground
conveniently situated for fresh water, and not much burdened with
timber, beginning with much spirit, and forming to themselves
very sanguine hopes of success. At the end of the month they had

In September, 1795, Captain Paterson, who was administering the
government, reported that the river had risen twenty-five feet
above its usual level, "laying the grounds of several settlers
under water". Four years later, in May, 1799, a much heavier
flood occurred. Hunter reports that a heavy fall of rain, coming
after a dry season, raised the river to a height of fifty feet
above the ordinary level, with disastrous consequences to the

<h3>19. THE PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>GROSE'S</small> despatches contain only information of
a general character concerning the progress of cultivation. We
read in them of the success of the Hawkesbury settlers, of the
difficulties caused by drought, and of the production of
sufficient maize and wheat to make the colony almost independent
of outside sources for its supply of bread. But very little is to
be found concerning the land in cultivation or the produce of the
fields. The deficiency is supplied to a large extent by Collins,
who sketches the progress of agriculture in a desultory way. The
prospects in 1793-94 were alternately good and bad, owing to
climatic conditions. The rain which fell in April, 1793, and
which followed a period of drought, was, according to Collins,
"too late to save the Indian corn". <a href="#note-532" name=
"noteref-532" id="noteref-532">{1}</a> Owing to this failure it
was rashly assumed that maize was unprofitable. It was decided,
therefore, to make wheat the principal crop, and as large a
quantity of this grain was sown as the resources of the
settlement allowed. <a href="#note-533" name="noteref-533" id=
"noteref-533">{2}</a> It was soon discovered, however, that the
consequences of a dry season were not to be overcome by a change
of cereal. In August the wheat looked yellow and parched, and
although rain fell towards the end of the month, it was concluded
that, "there being no fixed period at which wet weather was to be
expected in this country, it might certainly be pronounced too
dry for wheat." <a href="#note-534" name="noteref-534" id=
"noteref-534">{3}</a> It does not seem to have been known to
Collins and the disappointed cultivators that maize required more
moisture than wheat; if this fact had been present in their
minds, they must necessarily have decided that the climate was
equally unsuitable for the growth of either maize or wheat. Proof
was afforded very soon afterwards that the country, in ordinary
seasons, would grow both wheat and Indian corn.</p>
<p>Five months after the advent of the rainy weather, which was
supposed to be "too late to save the Indian corn", it was
discovered that the settlers had not fared so ill as was feared,
for, "after reserving a sufficiency for seed for the ensuing
season and for domestic purposes, a few had raised enough to
enable them to sell twelve hundred bushels to Government, who, on
receiving it into the public stores, paid five shillings per
bushel to the bringer." <a href="#note-535" name="noteref-535"
id="noteref-535">{4}</a> At the same time the wheat "wore the
most flattering aspect, giving every promise of a plenteous
harvest". <a href="#note-536" name="noteref-536" id=
"noteref-536">{5}</a> The wheat ripened in November, and the
estimate of the yield was twenty-two bushels to the acre.
<a href="#note-537" name="noteref-537" id="noteref-537">{6}</a>
Unfortunately, owing to the previous failure, only ninety acres
of public land had been sown with this kind of grain, so that
although the crop turned out well the quantity of grain harvested
was small. The settlers began, at the same time, to reap their
wheat crop, and they were offered by the Government as much as
ten shillings per bushel for their produce. <a href="#note-538"
name="noteref-538" id="noteref-538">{7}</a> Authentic returns of
the yields were not obtained, but Collins states that the
settlers' farms produced nearly seven thousand bushels; in some
cases the yield had been as much as thirtyfold. <a href=
"#note-539" name="noteref-539" id="noteref-539">{8}</a></p>
<p>In April, 1794, four hundred acres were sown with wheat for
the Government, <a href="#note-540" name="noteref-540" id=
"noteref-540">{9}</a> and it was discovered at the same time that
the Indian corn, which had been regarded as an unprofitable crop,
had turned out remarkably well. One of the officers of the New
South Wales Corps&mdash;probably Macarthur, who had already
become a prosperous farmer&mdash;obtained as much as fifty
bushels per acre. <a href="#note-541" name="noteref-541" id=
"noteref-541">{10}</a> A month later the Commissary had purchased
from the settlers 6,163&frac14; bushels of maize, at five
shillings per bushel. Grose had every reason to complain of the
selfishness of these people, On various pretexts, such as
unfavourable seasons, and the reduced ration, they had been
allowed provisions from the public stores for more than twelve
months beyond the time allowed under the conditions of
settlement. <a href="#note-542" name="noteref-542" id=
"noteref-542">{11}</a> For this indulgence some return was
expected, and when their land, which had been freely granted to
them, and on which they had been supported for two years and a
half, yielded abundantly, they were asked to assist the
Government in procuring food for the convicts, not by giving up
their corn for nothing, but by selling it to the Commissary at a
fair price. But it was more profitable to use it for brewing or
distilling&mdash;everyone was allowed at that time to keep a
still&mdash;and the Government could obtain from the settlers
only a few hundred bushels. <a href="#note-543" name=
"noteref-543" id="noteref-543">{12}</a> Appeals were made to them
without effect; and as they continued to refuse to sell their
corn, although they were being supported from the Government
stores, sixty-three of them were struck off the provision list; a
just punishment, Collins observes, for their selfishness.</p>
<p>The condition of the agricultural industry in 1794 fully
justified the confident tone of the despatches which Grose wrote
at that time. On the 10th December, a few days before he left the
colony, he stated in a despatch to Dundas:&mdash;"Our wheat
harvest is over; the produce is considerable, and the Indian
corn, at present, has the appearance of plenty." <a href=
"#note-544" name="noteref-544" id="noteref-544">{13}</a> In a
letter which he left for Hunter, whose appointment to the
Governorship had been announced, and whose arrival was daily
expected, <a href="#note-545" name="noteref-545" id=
"noteref-545">{14}</a> he said:&mdash;"The colony is at this time
in so flourishing a state, and the officer I leave in command
<a href="#note-546" name="noteref-546" id="noteref-546">{15}</a>
every way so capable of the duty of it, that no evil consequences
can possibly attend my going away." <a href="#note-547" name=
"noteref-547" id="noteref-547">{16}</a> This favourable account
is borne out by Collins, who described the condition of the
settlement several months before that as very flourishing indeed.
The improvement which had taken place was not known in England,
where, according to reports brought by the William and other
vessels, the general impression seemed to be that the colony was
a sterile waste, destitute of native vegetation, and incapable of
cultivation. In the latter part of 1794 agriculture had been
established on a firm foundation. <a href="#note-548" name=
"noteref-548" id="noteref-548">{17}</a> There could be no
question that the colony, as regarded the cultivation of the
land, had entered upon a season of prosperity. If its condition
from a social point of view had been equally satisfactory, there
would have been little ground for complaint.</p>

"The principal labour in hand at Sydney at this time was what the
building of the barracks occasioned; and at the other settlements
the people were chiefly employed in getting into the ground the
grain for the ensuing season, and in preparing for sowing the
maize. This article of subsistence having in the late season
proved very unprofitable, the average quantity being not more
than six bushels per acre on the whole, the Lieutenant-Governor
determined to sow with wheat as much of the public grounds as he
could; and every settler who chose to apply was permitted to draw
as much wheat from the public granary as his ground required,
proper care being taken to insure its being applied solely to
that use."&mdash;Ib., p. 287.</p>

This estimate was probably in excess of the actual yield.
Twenty-two bushels of wheat to the acre would now be regarded as
a very exceptionally good harvest. The average per acre for the
thirty years ending March, 1893, was 13.2 bushels. The highest
for any season during that period being 17.4, obtained during
1886-7. In other parts of the world much heavier yields are

"No regular account had been obtained of what these farms had
produced; but it was pretty well ascertained, that their crops
had yielded at the least nearly seven thousand bushels of wheat.
Of the different districts, that of Prospect Hill proved to be
the most productive; some grounds there returned thirty bushels
of wheat for one. Next to the district of Prospect Hill, the
Northern Boundary farms were the best; but many of the settlers
at the other districts ascribed their miscarriage more to the
late periods at which their grounds were sown, than to any
poverty in the soil, and seemed to have no doubt, if they could
procure seed wheat in proper time (that is, to be in the ground
in April) and the season were favourable, of being repaid the

"It was found that the settlers, notwithstanding the plentiful
crops which in general they might he said to have gathered, gave
no assistance to Government by sending any into store. Some small
quantity (about one hundred and sixty bushels) indeed had been
received; but nothing equal either to the wants or expectations
of Government. They appeared to be most sedulously endeavouring
to get rid of their grain in any way they could; some by brewing
and distilling it; some by baking it into bread, and indulging
their own propensities in eating; others by paying debts
contracted by gaming. Even the farms themselves were pledged and
lost in this way; those very farms which undoubtedly were capable
of furnishing them with an honest comfortable maintenance for
life."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 338.</p>

"Among other articles of information received by the William we
were assured, that it had been industriously circulated in
England that there was not in this country either grass for
graminivorous animals, or vegetables for the use of man. This
report was, however, rather forcibly contradicted by the abundant
increase of all descriptions of live stock at this time in the
colony, and by the plenty which was to be found in every garden,
whether calculated by the officer or by the convict. A striking
instance of this plenty occurred at Parramatta a few days before
the arrival of the storeship, when six tons and two hundredweight
of potatoes were gathered as the produce of only three-quarters
of an acre of ground."&mdash;Collins, p. 360. "The ships which
had lately arrived from England were fraught with the dismal and
ill-founded accounts, which through some evil design continued to
be insidiously propagated, of the wretched unprofitable soil of
New South Wales. It was hoped, however, that when the present
appearance and state of the colony should reach England, every
attempt to mislead the public would cease; and such encouragement
be held out as would induce individuals to settle in the country.
. . . . The supercargo of the Halcyon, Mr. W. Megee, "on seeing
the Toongabbe hills covered with a most promising crop of wheat,
declared that he had never seen better in America, even at Rhode
Island, the Garden of America; and on being shown some Indian
corn of last year's growth, gave it as his opinion, that we
wanted nothing but large herds of grazing cattle to be a
thriving, prosperous, and great colony, possessing within itself
all the essential articles of life."&mdash;Ib., p. 375.</p>

<h3>20. THE TRAFFIC IN SPIRITS. <small>[1791-8]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>CONSIDERING</small> the materials of which the
community was chiefly composed&mdash;convicts of both sexes, but
principally male, and soldiers who were no better than the bulk
of the British army as it existed a hundred years ago&mdash;a
high standard of morality was not to be expected; but the course
pursued by Grose, in more than one direction, was not calculated
to produce the best results. One of the gravest faults of his
administration was the removal of the restrictions on the
introduction and consumption of spirits which existed under the
rule of his predecessor. Foreseeing the consequences that would
follow if strong drink in considerable quantities became
accessible to the people, Phillip did his best to prevent its
importation. In a despatch of 18th November, 1791, he informed
Nepean that "the landing of spirits without having a permit has
been prohibited in the port orders, in order to prevent the
convicts procuring any"; but he suggested that a duty would more
effectually answer the purpose. To this communication he received
the reply that the port orders were considered sufficient to meet
the case. Probably, it was thought that the settlement was not
ripe for the establishment of Customs duties. Ten years went by
before a duty was placed upon spirits, and by that time the evils
Phillip apprehended had come to pass. So strongly did he feel on
the subject that he would have liked to retain the whole liquor
supply in the hands of the Government. Replying, on the 11th of
October, 1792, to a despatch, in which he was informed that "an
allowance of rum for the non-commissioned officers and privates"
was about to be sent out, he made the warning remark:&mdash;"The
permitting of spirits among the civil and military may be
necessary, but it will certainly be a great evil." <a href=
"#note-549" name="noteref-549" id="noteref-549">{1}</a> The
prediction was only too well founded.</p>
<p>Grose had not been in office a fortnight when he took the
first step which ultimately resulted in a complete reversal of
the salutary system established by his predecessor. The American
ship, the Hope, which arrived on the 24th of December, 1792, had
on board a cargo of provisions and a quantity of spirits, which
were offered for sale. As the master refused to sell one part of
the cargo without the other, the spirits had to be purchased, a
circumstance for which Grose expressed regret; but as he inferred
from the despatch sent from Whitehall on the 15th May that it was
intended to issue spirits to the soldiers, he observed that he
had on that account "the less reluctantly consented". Not being
certain, from the terms of the despatch, whether the liquor was
to be served as an allowance, or whether a deduction was to be
made from the pay of those who received it, he issued the
spirits, making stoppages from the pay of those to whom it was
supplied, and retaining the money until he had received fresh
instructions on the subject. <a href="#note-550" name=
"noteref-550" id="noteref-550">{2}</a> In disposing of the
spirits in this way there was no particular harm. The quantity
which the soldiers were able to purchase out of their pay was
inconsiderable; and although some of them violated the
regulations and disposed of their liquor to the convicts, who
gave their rations in return, the evil that ensued was slight
compared with the consequences that followed soon after from the
establishment of a promiscuous traffic in strong drink.</p>
<p>Most of the vessels that came to the colony on voyages of
speculation brought spirits, and if the liquor was not required
by the Government it was purchased by the civil and military
officers, who were apparently allowed to purchase through the
Government stores as much as they chose, at prime cost. The
officers were also allowed to introduce from India and the Cape
shipments of spirits ordered specially by them. It soon became
apparent that the liquor was finding its way among the settlers
and convicts. The former neglected their farms and squandered
their means; the latter sold their food for drink, and robbed the
settlers' gardens to make up for the loss of their rations. Among
both classes gambling was common. The practice of buying food
from the convicts with spirits was not unknown in Phillip's time,
but stringent regulations were made with the object of putting a
stop to it. <a href="#note-551" name="noteref-551" id=
"noteref-551">{3}</a> These regulations were in force in Grose's
time, but it seems to have been difficult, if not impossible, to
make them effective. <a href="#note-552" name="noteref-552" id=
"noteref-552">{4}</a> A quantity of spirits having been found in
the convicts' huts, it was seized and given to the watchmen and
the guard who made the discovery, "as a stimulus to future
vigilance". But when there were so many eager to buy, and others
willing to sell, the most stringent regulations were of little
avail. Collins says "the passion for liquor operated like a
mania". The spirits obtainable at the time were of very bad
quality; it seems to have been a doubtful point which was the
worse&mdash;the rum brought from Arnica, or the brandy received
from the Cape. The fondness of the convicts for the "pernicious
American spirit" the same authority tells us, was "incredible";
they would do anything to obtain it, and "while spirits were to
be had those who did any extra labour refused to be paid in
money, or any other article than spirits."</p>
<p>In these circumstances it was manifestly the duty of the
Governor to do all in his power to check the consumption of
liquor, but Grose adopted a course which encouraged the practice.
The officers desiring to bring into cultivation, as speedily as
possible, the land which had been granted to them, employed not
only the convicts who had been assigned to them but others who
were allowed to work on their own account on certain days. Taking
advantage of the fatal passion for liquor, the officers paid
these men with spirits. and thus had no difficulty in obtaining
the extra labour they required. <a href="#note-553" name=
"noteref-553" id="noteref-553">{5}</a> The consequences may be
imagined. Instead of consuming liquor in small quantities, the
convicts drank to excess, and, as the pages of Collins show, work
in the fields was too often the prelude to an orgy of
intoxication.</p>
<p>While the soldiers and petty officials were prohibited from
selling liquor to convicts, no matter how small the quantity
might be, the commissioned officers were allowed to purchase
labour with spirits, which thus became the recognised medium of
exchange between the proprietors of the land and a class of
people that it was important in the highest degree to keep from
the influence of liquor. The arrangement was a very profitable
one for the officers, for they sold the liquor&mdash;that is to
say, they exchanged it for labour&mdash;at a much higher rate
than that at which they had purchased it. Grose was desirous of
giving the officers every possible facility for cultivating their
holdings, and although he may have had some misgivings on the
subject, he probably thought that the end justified the means.
The course pursued was an unfortunate one. It produced serious
evils, and established a vicious traffic in spirits, which was
not effectually checked until King, ten years afterwards, had
nearly worn himself out in the effort to put it down.</p>
<p>Another phase of the liquor question, which it is difficult to
understand, was the toleration shown to settlers who by
distillation converted their grain into spirit. Every bushel of
wheat grown was wanted as food for the people, and yet the
settlers were allowed to waste their produce by turning it into
an article that was useless. <a href="#note-554" name=
"noteref-554" id="noteref-554">{6}</a> If Grose had chosen he
could have stopped the practice, but he did not interfere. It was
prohibited by Hunter by General Order in March, 1796, but in the
meantime a great deal of mischief had been done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the records of this period of our history,
particularly the despatches of Lieutenant-Governor Grose, are
almost silent concerning the effect of Grose's government upon
the morals of the community. It was not until some years after
Grose had returned to England that any mention was made in
official papers of this aspect of the question. In September,
1796, Captain Macarthur, writing to the Duke of Portland, alluded
to the great cost of maintaining the settlement, and to the
profligacy of the people&mdash;openly insinuating that Hunter was
responsible for both evils. The Duke of Portland did not answer
the letter, but sent it out to Hunter for his report. It was thus
nearly two years after Macarthur made his charges before Hunter
had an opportunity of replying to them. This he did in a despatch
dated 27th July, 1798, with which he forwarded corroborative
reports from the Rev. Richard Johnson, the Rev. Samuel Marsden,
and Mr. Surgeon Arndell.</p>
<p>Hunter admitted the existence of the evils complained of by
Macarthur; but attributed them to the policy pursued by Grose in
giving so much power to the military officers, and in allowing
the establishment of a system of trade in spirits. Conscious that
his statements would lose force by the fact that he had not any
personal knowledge of the colony during Grose's administration.
Hunter called upon the Chaplains and Surgeon, who had been
eye-witnesses. If the reports of these gentlemen are to be
credited, the state of affairs was shocking even for a convict
settlement. The people were given up to drunkenness, gambling,
and licentiousness; disorder and riot prevailed; robberies and
crimes of a still more serious nature were common; the people had
no respect for either God or man; and so little control was kept
over the criminal population that it was not safe, according to
Mr. Arndell, for a civilian to pass from one part of the town to
the other.</p>
<p>Johnson and his coadjutor employed equally strong
language.</p>
<p>It must not be overlooked that the reports are <i>ex
parte</i>. They were written nearly four years after Grose left
the colony, and there is nothing to show that they were brought
under his notice; at all events, no reply from him has been found
in the Records. The reports must, therefore, be taken as a
statement of the case from one point of view only. They are,
however, confirmed in many important points by Collins, whose
pages contain numerous allusions to the drunkenness, gambling,
profligacy, and crime which prevailed in the years 1793-1795.<br>

"The Lieutenant-Governor having directed the Commissary to
dispose of the spirits purchased from the American to the
military and civil officers of the colony, in which were included
the superintendents, and some others in that line, it was found
that it had been purchased by many individuals of the latter
description with the particular view of retailing it among the
convicts. He, therefore, found it necessary to declare in public
orders that it was his intention to make frequent inquiries on
the subject; and it might be relied upon that, if it ever
appeared that a convict was possessed of any of the liquor so

diabolical spirit from his wheat, than to send it to the store
and receive ten shillings per bushel from the Commissary. From
one bushel of wheat he obtained nearly five quarts of spirit,
which he sold or paid in exchange for labour at five and six
shillings per quart."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 327. Webb was not

<h3>21. RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION UNDER GROSE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>AT</small> the foundation of the colony but slight
provision had been made for the religious instruction of the
community, and the labours of the single chaplain (Rev. R.
Johnson) were performed under difficulties which the
circumstances rendered unavoidable. Having to deal with an
intractable community, consisting as it did chiefly of convicts
and soldiers, he required all the countenance and support which
those in authority could give him. In Phillip's time, although
his work was done under very trying conditions, he received the
countenance and assistance of the Governor; but from Grose he met
with obstruction and contumely.</p>

<br>

1792."</small></p>
<br>
<p>Before considering the treatment he received, it will be as
well to point out the circumstances in which the Chaplain was
placed when Grose took charge. He was the only minister of
religion in a colony of about four thousand inhabitants,
distributed over three settlements&mdash;Sydney, Parramatta, and
Toongabbie. The people were so ill-disposed to profit by the
Chaplain's ministrations that Phillip had found it necessary to
issue an order by which the Commissary was instructed to stop a
certain quantity of flour from the ration of any convict who
neglected to attend divine service without sufficient reason.
When Grose took charge, the disinclination on the part of the
people to take part in the services had become conspicuous.
Although the colony had been founded for nearly five years, no
place of worship had been erected, nor had any serious steps been
taken in that direction. It is true that in the spring of 1791
the foundation of a church had been laid at Parramatta, but
before it was finished it was converted into a lock-up house, and
afterwards used as a granary. <a href="#note-555" name=
"noteref-555" id="noteref-555">{1}</a> At Sydney, as well as at
Parramatta, the Chaplain had generally to perform service in the
open air. The difficulties he had to contend with are described
in a letter to the Governor, dated 29th February, 1792, in which
he pointed out that at times not one-quarter of the convicts were
present, and that he had received frequent excuses from
officers&mdash;civil, military, and naval&mdash;whose sole reason
for non-attendance was the absence of proper accommodation. He
declared that those who desired to attend public worship were in
a much better position to do so when the first tent was pitched
at Sydney Cove, four years before, for then the trees afforded
them some shelter. He himself had suffered so much from exposure
that he did not wonder that others attended so seldom and so
reluctantly. <a href="#note-556" name="noteref-556" id=
"noteref-556">{2}</a></p>
<p>In a letter written a few weeks later, Mr. Johnson referred to
the absence of any place of worship or of any prospect of such
being provided at Parramatta and Toongabbie, and mentioned that
on the then ensuing Sunday service was to be held at Sydney in an
old boathouse&mdash;"not fit or safe for a stable or cowhouse".
<a href="#note-557" name="noteref-557" id="noteref-557">{3}</a>
This state of things continued throughout Phillip's Governorship,
greatly, no doubt, to his regret. That he valued religious
observances is shown by the order he issued with the object of
enforcing the attendance of the convicts. Phillip will perhaps be
blamed in some quarters for omitting to erect buildings for
public worship, but it must be remembered that he was in
circumstances of peculiar difficulty. It was as much as he could
do to find food and shelter for the people. It is not likely that
he would have turned the proposed church into a lock-up, and
afterwards into a granary, had it been possible to avoid doing
so. Not until eight months after Phillip's departure was service
held in a building devoted specially to religions purposes. The
church was a temporary one, constructed of wood, out of the
Chaplain's private funds, at a cost of &pound;67 12s.
11&frac12;d. <a href="#note-558" name="noteref-558" id=
"noteref-558">{4}</a> It appears from Mr. Johnson's letter to
Dundas, 3rd September, 1793, that the erection of the building
was commenced on the 10th June, and that it had only just been
finished at the time he wrote. <a href="#note-559" name=
"noteref-559" id="noteref-559">{5}</a> It afforded accommodation
for five hundred people.</p>
<p>Although Johnson did not ask in so many words that his
expenses might be reimbursed, it may be seen from the fact that
he sent in to the Lieutenant-Governor a detailed statement of the
expenditure, and from the letters he subsequently sent to the
Secretary of State, that he expected to have the cost made good.
But of this Grose by no means approved. He forwarded the
Chaplain's letter to Dundas, but instead of recommending that he
should be repaid for the money he had laid out, he informed
Dundas that he could not allow the matter to pass without
observing that the Chaplain was a very troublesome and
discontented character, the cost was, he thought, extravagantly
high, and he was much surprised that any claim at all was made,
as he had been given to understand by Johnson that the building
was being erected at his own cost, and on this understanding he
had generally been accommodated with a variety of articles free
of charge from the public stores. <a href="#note-560" name=
"noteref-560" id="noteref-560">{6}</a></p>
<p>It is evident from this letter that Grose had taken a strong
dislike to the Chaplain, who does not seem to have been aware at
the time that he had incurred the displeasure of his superior
officer, for that was the relation in which the
Lieutenant-Governor stood to the Chaplain of the settlement, who,
like himself, held a Commission from the Crown. Whether Grose
thought sixty-seven pounds was too large a sum to pay for the
erection of a church, or whether he meant to convey that the
building constructed by Johnson ought to have been put up for
less money, is not clear. On this point the ambiguity of his
language leaves a good deal to conjecture.</p>
<p>Had Grose maturely considered the question whether the church
should have been built by the Government, which had labour and
material at its command, or by the Chaplain, whose allowance was
ten shillings a day, he would have been obliged to confess that
the responsibility rested with the Government, and not with Mr.
Johnson.</p>
<p>What was the cause of Grose's enmity there is no independent
evidence to show; but reading Johnson's letters to Dundas, in
connection with those sent by him to friends in England, and with
the reports made by both the Chaplain and his assistant to
Governor Hunter, <a href="#note-561" name="noteref-561" id=
"noteref-561">{7}</a> the conclusion can scarcely be avoided that
Johnson incurred Grose's displeasure because, in the exercise of
his office, he protested against the neglect of religious
observances and against a number of abuses which the
Lieutenant-Governor took no steps to remove. Johnson had reason
to complain of his treatment by Grose almost from the first. His
convenience was not consulted, his requests for necessary
assistance were refused, and he complained that on one occasion
he was treated with gross disrespect while conducting service.
The circumstances as related by Johnson himself were as
follows:&mdash;One morning while performing divine service (which
by Grose's order was held at 6 a.m.) an interruption was made by
two soldiers; this, as if by a preconcerted sign, was followed by
beat of drum, and the soldiers, falling into line,
unceremoniously marched to their barracks. The service, Johnson
remarked, had then lasted barely three-quarters of an hour, and
he was about halfway through his discourse. Johnson, writing five
years afterwards, <a href="#note-562" name="noteref-562" id=
"noteref-562">{8}</a> referred to the incident at greater length.
From this letter it appears that he was aware, at the time, that
it was intended to confine the service to forty-five minutes, and
that the tattoo for relieving the guard would sound, as usual, at
a quarter to seven. Furthermore, when he began the service he
heard the drum-major order "two drummers to beat off at ten
minutes or a quarter before seven, as usual." Johnson was very
indignant; his astonishment and concern were so great that he
could not continue to address the few convicts who remained, and
returned home greatly distressed at "such barefaced profanation
and infidelity". He immediately wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor
complaining of the treatment he had received. The letter has,
unfortunately, not been preserved. In a letter from Johnson to
Dundas, dated 8th April, 1794, he declared that this complaint
was the first of his acts which gave offence to Grose. <a href=
"#note-563" name="noteref-563" id="noteref-563">{9}</a></p>
<p>He went on to say that he had made application soon after the
church was built for the appointment of a sexton and a man to
ring the bell and look after the church; but this request, which
is properly described as both reasonable and necessary, was
denied. There was no person whose regular business it was to make
preparation for burials; and it often happened that the Chaplain
had to wait in the burying-ground while graves were
altered&mdash;sometimes while they were being made. Having
recounted these disadvantages, Mr. Johnson went on to explain his
position:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"From these different circumstances you may judge,
sir, whether I have not sufficient reason to be discontented. The
soldier, it seems, is properly supplied with his regimentals; the
surgeon has an hospital provided for his patients, and is
supplied with medicines. Persons bearing other offices are
furnished with what is needful for them to do their duty; and,
for the same reason, I do not see why a clergyman should be
denied what is necessary for him in the discharge of his duty.
But such has been all along my situation, and I have had neither
church, nor clerk (except my own free servant, who fills up his
place at Sydney), nor sexton, for want of which conveniences and
assistance I have seen it needful to complain.<br>
<br>
"It was this last circumstance that gave rise to an unhappy
difference that has taken place between the Lieutenant-Governor
and myself. When refused this request, so just, reasonable, and
necessary, I could not forbear signifying that I conceived myself
extremely slighted, and that as chaplain to the colony I had
reason to expect greater support. This occasioned some warm
dispute and altercation, when some ill-natured and ill-founded
reflections were thrown out upon me, which I trust and flatter
myself my general mode of conduct has not merited."</blockquote>
<p>Grose said nothing in his letters about any dispute or
altercation; but he complained in a despatch written on the 29th
April, 1794, <a href="#note-564" name="noteref-564" id=
"noteref-564">{10}</a> of Johnson's behaviour, which he described
as "disorderly" (although he did not state of what the disorder
consisted), adding that he had received from him "treatment very
unbecoming his character as a clergyman to offer, and not very
consistent with my situation to put up with." He accounted for
his previous silence on the subject by stating that he had
refrained from making any representations "in pity to a large
family". It is worthy of remark that Grose made these statements
when replying to a despatch informing him of the appointment of
Johnson's assistant (the Rev. Samuel Marsden), in which his
attention had been drawn to the importance&mdash;in a settlement
like New South Wales&mdash;of the clerical station and character
being treated with respect. Grose was careful to declare that so
far as he was concerned it had been his wish to make the
clergyman as comfortable as possible. If Johnson's letters can be
relied upon, he was singularly unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The Chaplain had other grounds for dissatisfaction. After
referring to his quarrel with Grose, he complained that the
treatment he had afterwards met with was "very uncivil and
severe". He described the incivility and severity at some length.
<a href="#note-565" name="noteref-565" id="noteref-565">{11}</a>
The chief complaint was that, while the civil and military
officers were allowed ten or more convict labourers to help them
to cultivate their ground, he could only obtain the services of
two. He was therefore obliged to pay men at the rate of forty
shillings per week, and his corn was "exposed to perpetual
depredations for want of proper assistance to protect it".</p>
<p>It appears from Johnson's statement that Phillip shortly
before he sailed for England had, in obedience to instructions,
<a href="#note-566" name="noteref-566" id="noteref-566">{12}</a>
set apart four hundred acres as church land, which Johnson had
commenced to clear with the aid of two or three convicts. Finding
that ten convicts were allowed to the officers as farm labourers,
he applied for seven more, but could only obtain them on
condition of giving up the four hundred acres and taking in lieu
thereof the area allowed to the officers&mdash;namely, one
hundred acres. This he did in March, 1793. In the following
November all his farm labourers except two were taken from him
without a moment's notice; but no diminution was made in the
number allowed to the officers. No reason is assigned for this
arbitrary act on the part of Grose in substituting one hundred
for four hundred acres of land. It is possible that Grose desired
to prevent Johnson from establishing a proprietary claim to the
larger area. His precautions were, however, unnecessary; the land
was set apart for the maintenance of a minister, not as the
property of an individual, and whatever advantage the Chaplain
might have derived from it during his enjoyment of the position,
the ownership of the land would have remained with the State.</p>

Reproduced by Heliotype from "Memoirs of the Life and Labours of
the Rev. Samuel Marsden, London. 1858."</small></p>
<br>
<p>The correspondence, on the part of Johnson, was continued at
some length. He concluded his letter of the 8th April by
informing Dundas that he had written to the Bishop of London,
asking him to make application for the papers sent to the Home
Office, so that his Lordship might be able to form some judgment
as to whether his conduct merited the "severe treatment" he had
received, and expressing his willingness to abide by the decision
at which the Secretary of State and the Bishop might arrive. He
followed this up by a letter written on the 7th August, which was
sent, apparently, because he discovered that Grose had written
disapproving of his action in asking to be repaid the money he
had expended in building the temporary church. He mentioned in
this communication that he had forwarded a full statement of the
case to his "honoured friend, Mr. Wilberforce", and expressed
regret that "differences" had arisen, stating that, although he
had made application, if it should be thought he had acted
improperly, he did not desire to receive any compensation for
what he had done.</p>
<p>On the 24th November he again wrote to Dundas, repeating that
if it should be considered that his action in erecting a place of
worship was considered in any way unnecessary or improper he
would cheerfully take the burden upon himself. <a href=
"#note-567" name="noteref-567" id="noteref-567">{13}</a> It has
been remarked that, although Grose in his correspondence with the
Home Department did not hesitate to abuse Johnson, he did not
point to any specific act in support of his charges. He certainly
stated that he had refrained from reporting Johnson's "disorderly
behaviour" from motives of pity; but having allowed benevolence
to get the better of his judgment, it was clearly his duty, not
only to Johnson, but to the British Government, to set forth in
what the disorderly behaviour consisted. In the absence of any
such information it was quite impossible for the authorities in
England to decide whether Johnson was, or was not, fitted for the
post.</p>
<p>Johnson, on the contrary, as soon as he learned that he had
been attacked, opened a correspondence with the Home Department,
in which he made a full statement of his case; supporting his
accusation of unfair treatment on the part of the
Lieutenant-Governor with details, by an examination of which the
truth or otherwise of his complaint could be tested. He also
wrote letters to the Bishop of London, Mr. William Wilberforce,
the philanthropist, and the Rev. John Newton. <a href="#note-568"
name="noteref-568" id="noteref-568">{14}</a> A letter, addressed
to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in which a copy of a sermon was
enclosed, was also sent to Mr. Newton, but it was decided after
consultation with friends that the letter should not be presented
to the Archbishop, "as it seemed improbable that a copy of the
sermon had been sent to him, and if not it was not necessary that
he should see it." <a href="#note-569" name="noteref-569" id=
"noteref-569">{15}</a> It would appear from this that Johnson had
delivered a sermon to which exception had been taken, possibly by
Grose.</p>
<p>Johnson had influential friends in England, where he enjoyed a
good reputation. One of them was Wilberforce, whose knowledge of
his character and readiness to serve him stood the Chaplain in
good stead. By the same vessel that took to England Grose's
letter disapproving of the application which had been made for
reimbursement of the money expended on the temporary church,
Johnson sent a letter to Wilberforce asking him to use his good
offices with the Secretary of State. Wilberforce, who was a
personal friend of Dundas, had no hesitation in complying with
the request, and he gave Johnson at the same time a very high
character:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"When I tell you he is one of the worthiest men
breathing, the most active, the most humble, and at the same time
very little acquainted with the world, I have said enough to
excuse the steps he has taken and to obtain his reimbursement. In
truth, &pound;67 for a church is rather a more moderate charge
than Government, I believe, is used to, and I know from his
private letters that he worked very hard with his own hands, and
often by night as well as by day." <a href="#note-570" name=
"noteref-570" id="noteref-570">{16}</a></blockquote>
<p>Other people who had opportunities of judging of his character
expressed their confidence in him. Wilberforce regarded him as
"one of the worthiest men breathing"; Phillip made him a
magistrate; and Hunter, who held the office of Governor for five
years after the departure of Grose and Paterson, placed the most
implicit confidence in him. King, who succeeded Hunter, had the
means of obtaining trustworthy information, and we find him
writing to the Under Secretary of the Home Department, when
Johnson had resigned his appointment and was about to return to
England, that he, Johnson, had "met with much persecution from
Grose when he commanded here". <a href="#note-571" name=
"noteref-571" id="noteref-571">{17}</a> The letter in which this
sentence occurs was a private one, and King was, therefore, able
to write with freedom. "Persecution" was a strong word to use,
but it was not rashly employed. King's information, obtained on
the spot, evidently supported the statements made by Johnson in
his letters to the Secretary of State and to his friends.</p>
<p>There is another point. If Grose's representations had been
taken seriously by the Home Department, Johnson would have been
deprived of his appointment, instead of which he kept it for six
years after Grose returned to England, when the state of his
health obliged him to relinquish it. The contempt with which
religion and those who were charged with the teaching of it were
treated during the administration of Grose exerted an influence
for evil which was felt for many years.</p>
<p>One good result followed the unpleasant relations which
existed between Grose and the Chaplain. Writing to Dundas on the
5th July, 1794, Grose informed him that he had erected a church
capable of containing three hundred people. He made a special
mention of the fact because:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am given to understand that the Revd. Mr. Johnson,
who is really a most troublesome character, has endeavoured to
persuade the Archbishop of Canterbury that ecclesiastical matters
are not at all attended to, and that there is no place for public
worship excepting a building put up at his own expence." <a href=
"#note-572" name="noteref-572" id=
"noteref-572">{18}</a></blockquote>
<p>Johnson's letter, which was never delivered to the Archbishop,
may have contained the statement referred to by Grose; but if it
did it was strictly correct, for it was written before steps had
been taken by Government for the erection of a church. If Johnson
had informed the Archbishop that ecclesiastical matters were "not
at all attended to", he exaggerated a little; but that they were
very badly attended to is shown by the fact, stated by Grose
himself, that the only effort to provide a place of public
worship, after six years, was the erection of a church which
would accommodate no more than three hundred persons.</p>
<p>Upon one important point the charges made by Johnson and
Marsden, <a href="#note-573" name="noteref-573" id=
"noteref-573">{19}</a> concerning Grose's connivance at the
neglect of public worship, are not borne out by Collins, <a href=
"#note-574" name="noteref-574" id="noteref-574">{20}</a>
according to whom, special orders were issued by Grose to secure
the attendance of the convicts at divine service. Johnson's
account is that he seldom preached to more than ten of twenty
convicts, sometimes only to those who were in his own employment;
while Marsden asserts that "all, without exception, however
infamous and abandoned, were allowed by those in authority to
absent themselves from public worship, and to spend the Sabbath
as their different passions and interests operated upon them."
The latter relates a circumstance which shows that the convicts
had express permission to work on Sundays if they chose. One
Sunday, while he was conducting service at Sydney, he was "much
interrupted by some of the prisoners breaking up ground near the
church." When service was over he remonstrated with the men, and
threatened to have them locked up if they went on with work in
the evening. No attention was paid to him, however, and work was
continued in the evening. After the service had closed he applied
to Johnson, who was a civil magistrate, to have the men taken
into custody for "open violation of the Sabbath, and contempt of
me as a clergyman and one of his Majesty's officers". On
Johnson's order they were committed to prison, but their
commitment was no sooner reported to the Lieutenant-Governor,
Marsden says, than he sent the captain of the guard to know the
cause, and, not satisfied with Marsden's explanation, ordered
them to be liberated, and requested the clergyman not to
interfere again with the internal government of the colony.</p>
<p>Knowing that his superior had failed, and that the efforts he
had made had rather aggravated the situation than improved it,
the Assistant Chaplain probably came to the conclusion that
inaction, so far as making representations to the chief authority
was concerned, was the best policy.</p>
<p>If these reports are to be relied upon, the social condition
of the colony in Grose's time was lamentable in the extreme. The
evil, of course, did not end there. The same system prevailed
during Lieutenant-Governor Paterson's short term of office, and
although a radical change was made after Hunter took command as
Governor in 1795, the evil consequences endured for many
years.</p>

"The clergyman, who suffered as much inconvenience as other
people from the want of a proper place for the performance of
divine service, himself undertook to remove the evil, on finding
that, from the pressure of other works, it was not easy to
foresee when a church would be erected. He accordingly began one
under his own inspection, and chose the situation for it at the
back of the huts on the east side of the cove. The front was
seventy-three feet by fifteen; and at right angles with the
centre projected another building forty feet by fifteen. The
edifice was constructed of strong posts, wattles, and plaster,
and was to be thatched. Much credit was due to the Rev. Mr.
Johnson for his personal exertions on this
occasion."&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 299. The absence of churches
in New South Wales had been brought under the notice of the
ecclesiastical authorities in England. In a letter of 8th June,

whether any measure is taken in respect to a place or places of
worship at Botany Bay, the want of which was so apparent from the

<h3>22. CHANGES EFFECTED BY GROSE. <small>[1792-4]</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>GROSE</small> directed the affairs of the colony for
only two years, but in that short space of time great changes
were brought about. The Government, as already indicated, had
been deprived of its civil character and placed on a military
basis, a new class of proprietors had been placed on the soil,
and cultivation had so progressed that the settlement was almost
independent of the mother country, so far, at all events, as the
supply of grain was concerned.</p>
<p>It was in these matters, principally, that Grose, working
evidently with a settled design, had produced such a remarkable
transformation in the appearance of the country.</p>
<p>The changes effected in the social condition of the
settlement, by relaxing the stringent rules of Phillip in regard
to the importation of spirits, and by discountenancing the
efforts of the Chaplain, were less obvious at the time, and
appear to have been the result of want of foresight on the part
of Grose, rather than of any settled policy.</p>
<p>There can be no question that the colony when Grose left it
was in a highly prosperous condition. Eight months before his
departure he wrote to Dundas informing him that the settlement
required no more than a few months' supply of flour; after that
only salt meat need be sent from England. He seemed to think that
the favourable account of affairs which he was giving might be
attributed to enthusiasm, for he went on to say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am perfectly aware of the consequences that might
ensue if our wants were at all disguised or concealed, and any
wishes of mine to see the colony in a thriving condition will not
induce me to describe it in a more flourishing state than it is.
The great assistance I have received from the civil and military
officers has enabled me to do much more than could be
expected.<br>
<br>
"I am particular in stating what has been done since the
departure of the Governor, not because I wish to arrogate any
consequence or merit to myself, for very little is due to me, but
because I wish to represent in the most favourable point of view
the officers serving in the colony, to whose great exertions the
promising appearance of it may be entirely attributed." <a href=
"#note-575" name="noteref-575" id=
"noteref-575">{1}</a></blockquote>
<p>Writing on the 8th December, a few days before his departure,
Grose spoke of the "flourishing state" of the colony, and no
doubt its condition was as he represented it to be, so far as
productiveness was concerned; but the prosperity was that of a
class rather than of the community as a whole. The small settlers
on the banks of the Hawkesbury were doing well, and so were those
at Parramatta and Toongabbie; but it was only the officers, who
had been supplied with convict labour on a liberal scale, who
were obtaining large returns. The advantages enjoyed by this
class, as well as the prosperous state of the colony, may be seen
from the letter of Captain Macarthur to his brother, written in
August, 1794:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The changes we have undergone since the departure of
Governor Phillip are so great and extraordinary that to recite
them all might create some suspicion of their truth. From a state
of desponding poverty and threatened famine, that this settlement
should be raised to its present aspect in so short a time is
scarcely credible. As to myself, I have a farm containing 250
acres, of which upwards of 100 are under cultivation, and the
greater part of the remainder is cleared of the timber which
grows upon it. Of this year's produce I have sold &pound;400
worth, and I have now remaining in my granaries upwards of 1,800
bushels of corn. I have at this moment 20 acres of very fine
wheat growing, and 80 acres prepared for Indian corn and
potatoes, with which it will be planted in less than a month."
<a href="#note-576" name="noteref-576" id=
"noteref-576">{2}</a></blockquote>
<p>Other officers had similar opportunities, though not perhaps
so good, for Macarthur, as inspector of works, was entitled to an
extra grant, and had other special advantages.</p>
<p>Macarthur expressed astonishment at the marvellous change
which had taken place since the departure of Governor Phillip a
year and a half before; but great as the change was, it need have
excited no surprise. Phillip struggled against exceptionally
adverse circumstances. He had been called upon to provide for
batch after batch of sick convicts, who were a heavy burden; and
after the first year or two, when the strength of the settlement
had to be employed chiefly in the erection of buildings, the
supply of provisions was so short and so precarious that the
convicts were too weak to cultivate the land with any chance of
success. Grose occasionally experienced difficulties of a similar
nature, but during the greater part of his term the supply of
food from England was plentiful.</p>
<p>The correspondence which took place between Governor Hunter
and the Home Department shows in what manner Grose's system,
adopted entirely on his own responsibility, worked. In a letter
to Under Secretary King, 1st June, 1797, two years after his
return to the colony as Governor, Hunter had no difficulty in
explaining why the settlement up to that time had been a
disappointment to the British Government. The letter was a
private one, but it does not lose importance on that account; on
the contrary, its value is enhanced by the circumstance that it
was written with a freedom that could not be looked for in the
official despatches. Hunter said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"When you come to examine the expences of this
settlement since its numbers became considerable, or since 1792,
you will say that it has not answered the expectation of
Government. But, sir, I feel no difficulty in declaring it to be
my opinion that such disappointment has not proceeded from the
nature of the country, but from other causes. There has not been
any land cleared on the public account since the above period,
<a href="#note-577" name="noteref-577" id="noteref-577">{3}</a>
the people had been otherwise disposed of, and the best land now
in cultivation is the property of individuals. I have already
said what were the advantages derived to the colony by the aid
afforded from the public servants to officers upon their farms;
the labourers were better looked after, and the live stock was
preserved. But there were at the same time considerable numbers
of convicts dispersed about in various ways, so as to have been
completely lost to the public. Had those who had been so
improperly disposed of been employed on Government's land already
cleared, and in clearing more for the benefit of the public, I do
not hesitate to say there would not now have been the occasion to
purchase so much grain as we find at this time unavoidable; but
had that been the case, it wou'd have ruin'd the expectation of
officers and settlers, whose interest appears to have been more
consider'd."</blockquote>
<p>This statement must be read in connection with Grose's
congratulatory report on the progress made during his term of
office. It shows that while there were grounds for satisfaction
at the development which had taken place in agriculture, the
results, to which the Lieutenant-Governor pointed with so much
pride, had been obtained by a sacrifice of the public interest.
Having at his disposal a larger number of workers than Phillip
possessed, not men who were fainting with hunger and little
capable of labour, but well-fed convicts, with strength to handle
the hoe and spade, he disposed of them, according to Hunter's
account, in such a way that the advantage which should have
accrued to the Government was reaped by the officers. It is also
to be noted that the best of the land then discovered had,
according to Hunter's report, passed into the hands of the
individuals. If no Crown reservations were made, this was the
inevitable result of the system adopted, for those who took up
land with a view to cultivating it would naturally select the
spots that were considered best adapted for the purpose.</p>
<p>It is not probable that Grose would have admitted that he was
doing wrong. Having deliberately adopted a policy, he acted upon
it with thoroughness. Knowing how difficult it was to obtain
satisfactory results from convict labour in the fields, and being
aware of a desire on the part of the officers to try their hands
at farming, he ventured to give them an opportunity of showing
what they could do. His despatches show that the steps he took in
this matter were the result of a set purpose, and that as soon as
he had made up his mind to turn the current into one direction he
ceased to think of doing anything further to bring the land into
cultivation for public purposes. The officers, he informed
Dundas, were "the only description of settlers on whom reliance
can be placed", and he should therefore "encourage their pursuit"
as much as was in his power. <a href="#note-578" name=

<h3>23. GROSE'S TREATMENT OF KING.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>ONE</small> of the blots on Grose's administration was
his unjust treatment of Philip Gidley King, the
Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island. King, who, in the first
instance, was appointed Commandant by Phillip, planted a
settlement on the island early in March, 1788, less than two
months after the arrival of the First Fleet in Port Jackson; and
for two years he managed the affairs of the young colony to the
satisfaction of the Governor-in-Chief and the authorities in
England. In March, 1790, Phillip placed Ross in charge, and sent
King home with despatches, at the same time strongly commending
him to the Secretary of State for the Home Department and to the
Lords of the Admiralty. The result was that he was promoted from
the rank of lieutenant in the Navy to that of commander, and was
honoured with a Commission appointing him Lieutenant-Governor of
Norfolk Island. He resumed the government in November, 1791, and
at the time when he came into collision with Grose he had been
more than two years in his second term of government, which he
had conducted so successfully that Norfolk Island was almost able
to support itself with animal food, and had produced so much corn
that it was in a position to give help to the elder settlement. A
large part of the land was under cultivation by settlers,
consisting of men from the Marine Force, sailors who had been
discharged from the Sirius, and convicts who had either been
emancipated or had served their sentences. The island settlement
was in fact in a most thriving condition until 1793-94, when a
series of events occurred which provoked the interference of
Grose.</p>
<p>King, in his capacity as Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk
Island, gave offence to Grose in three ways&mdash;First, his
departure from the island on a trip to New Zealand without having
obtained leave from head-quarters; second, the appointment of
Captain Nepean to the command during his absence; and third, the
course he pursued in suppressing a mutiny of the soldiers who
formed the garrison.</p>
<p>Taking the subjects in order, we have first of all King's
unauthorised departure. He left Norfolk Island for an important
purpose, as it seemed to him&mdash;namely, to return two New
Zealand natives to their homes. He was not absent for more than
ten days, and affairs, during his absence, were in competent
hands. It did not occur to him to ask permission from the
Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, under whose authority he
was. Had King waited for permission to leave the island he would
have been unable to accompany the New Zealanders to their homes.
Possibly he had in his mind the course taken by Phillip, who left
Sydney to return to England without having received formal
authority to do so. <a href="#note-579" name="noteref-579" id=
"noteref-579">{1}</a> But the two cases are not parallel. When
Phillip left New South Wales there was a Lieutenant-Governor,
whose Commission authorised him to take charge of the colony, in
the absence or death of the Governor; at Norfolk Island there was
no one to take the place of the Lieutenant-Governor, by virtue of
any Order or Commission; and without the permission of Grose,
King was not at liberty to leave his post.</p>
<p>The natives of New Zealand had been captured, under
instructions received from the Secretary of State, for the
purpose of affording information to the convicts and settlers at
Norfolk Island concerning the manufacture of cordage and clothing
from the flax-plant. At first the captives were sullen and
dejected, and refused to communicate what little knowledge they
possessed. It was soon discovered, however, that their refusal
was not due to ill-will, but to the apprehension that if they
disclosed their knowledge of the subject they would be compelled
to work at the flax-making. When it had been explained to them,
however, that labour would not be exacted from them, and that if
they would teach what they knew they should be sent back to their
homes at the earliest opportunity, they readily complied, and
became more reconciled to their situation. One of them, however,
was a priest, and the other a chief, and it was soon found that
they possessed only a general knowledge of flax-manufacture, and
not the skill of experts, the thing that was particularly
required. According to King, all the information they possessed
was extracted from them in an hour. <a href="#note-580" name=
"noteref-580" id="noteref-580">{2}</a> King treated them with
great kindness, lodging them in his own house, and having them at
his own table, and they became much attached to him. But they
were naturally anxious to return to their country and their
friends, and having performed their part of the compact, they
implored King to carry out his promise and send them back to New
Zealand. They had been twice disappointed, when favourable
opportunities for their return had occurred.</p>
<p>Early in November, 1793, the storeship Britannia arrived at
Norfolk Island on her way to Calcutta, whither she had been
despatched for supplies. The wind being unfavourable for
continuing the voyage, and likely to remain so for some time,
King resolved to employ her in returning the New Zealanders to
their country, and to go with them in himself. Grose could not
see why the Lieutenant-Governor of the settlement should leave
his post to escort two savages to their homes; but King had
substantial reasons. The New Zealanders were influential men in
their own country, and had been trepanned under circumstances
which must have produced a very strong feeling of anger among the
people of the Bay of Islands against white men, and particularly
those of the English race. The only way to remove that
impression, and to obtain the friendship of the New Zealand
natives, was to treat the captives well and to return them to
their homes. Although the master of the Britannia, Captain Raven,
was a man in whom full confidence could be placed, yet King seems
to have been nervously apprehensive that some evil might befall
his friends if he did not keep them under his protection to the
very last. The natives had been treated by King so well during
their enforced residence on the island that he had no difficulty
in managing them; but it was possible that if they were sent on
board a vessel among people to whom they were not accustomed,
some unpleasantness, if nothing worse, might arise. Besides, in
landing the men in New Zealand, caution was required, for some of
the tribes were at war, and if any mistake was made the
consequences would have been fatal to the captives.</p>
<p>Apart from considerations of this sort. King was intensely
anxious to make a favourable impression on the natives of New
Zealand, a country which he thought would be a valuable
acquisition to the British Crown. Unlike Collins, who entertained
a poor opinion of the place, based upon the report made by the
master of the Francis, <a href="#note-581" name="noteref-581" id=
"noteref-581">{3}</a> King was confident that New Zealand was a
valuable country, and he lost no opportunity of urging the
propriety of colonising it. He kept the subject under the notice
of the Government in his despatches, which show that he had a
strong desire to become the founder of a settlement in New
Zealand. But he received no encouragement, and many years elapsed
before any steps were taken to add New Zealand to the list of
occupied British possessions. <a href="#note-582" name=
"noteref-582" id="noteref-582">{4}</a></p>
<p>King explained to Dundas at some length in his despatches of
the 19th November, 1793, and 10th March, 1794, the reasons which
induced him to leave Norfolk Island and escort the New Zealand
natives, in person, to their homes. <a href="#note-583" name=
"noteref-583" id="noteref-583">{5}</a></p>
<p>They were received by a number of friends with great
demonstrations of joy, and some pleasant intercourse took place
between the New Zealand natives and the people on board the
Britannia. <a href="#note-584" name="noteref-584" id=
"noteref-584">{6}</a> After making a thoroughly good impression
on the natives, and promising to visit them again. King returned
to Norfolk Island, where he arrived after an absence of ten days.
He had the satisfaction of finding that during his absence
everything had been conducted with the greatest propriety.</p>
<p>The closing passage of his letter of the 19th November, 1793,
addressed to Dundas, shows that King was somewhat doubtful
whether the Secretary of State would altogether approve of the
trip to New Zealand. "Should any part of my conduct not be
approved of in the proceedings which I have had the honour to
state," he wrote, "I hope my zeal for wishing to forward his
Majesty's service and to convey useful information will offer
some excuse in my favour." <a href="#note-585" name="noteref-585"
id="noteref-585">{7}</a> Although he was severely censured by
Grose for this and for other steps which he took at about the
same time, yet his voyage to New Zealand and back, taken without
the authority of the Governor-in-Chief, was the only part of
King's conduct which the Home Department considered open to
question. <a href="#note-586" name="noteref-586" id=
"noteref-586">{8}</a> So far as can be gathered from the Records,
King had no idea that his conduct, either in this or in other
matters, would have excited the displeasure of Grose; the
avalanche of censure which he brought down on his head astonished
as well as grieved him.</p>
<p>As regards King's absence from the colony without having first
obtained permission, Grose's displeasure, as already suggested,
was caused not so much by the act itself as by the choice of a
substitute. Grose's view was that the officer in charge of the
detachment of the New South Wales Corps, Lieutenant Abbott,
should have been selected; and no doubt that was the appointment
which in ordinary circumstances would have been made. Lieutenant
Abbott, of the garrison in Norfolk Island, was next in authority
to King, and the control of affairs in case of the death of the
Lieutenant-Governor would have devolved upon him. But King had
reasons for not giving the command to Abbott. In the first place,
as he explained in his letter to Dundas, the only officers of the
corps stationed on the island were subalterns, three in number,
and if Abbott had been appointed acting Lieutenant-Governor, no
Court-martial could have been held. This can hardly be regarded
as a very serious obstacle, inasmuch as King did not propose to
be absent more than a few days. But for an accident, however, he
would have been obliged to appoint Abbott, or abandon his New
Zealand trip. The Britannia, which was employed to convey the New
Zealanders to their homes, brought from Sydney Captain Nepean,
the senior captain of the Corps, <a href="#note-587" name=
"noteref-587" id="noteref-587">{9}</a> who was on his way to
England, having obtained leave of absence on the ground of
ill-health. Being on leave. Captain Nepean was not liable, under
ordinary circumstances, to be called upon for duty of any sort,
but King regarded the case as one of emergency, and he therefore
requested Nepean to take his place while he was absent. Nepean
raised no objection, and the appointment was made in an Order in
which it was stated that Nepean was called upon to undertake this
duty because it was "necessary that a sufficient number of
officers belonging to the New South Wales Corps should remain on
the island to order and compose regimental Courts-martial." King
stated these reasons formally in a despatch to Dundas. <a href=
"#note-588" name="noteref-588" id="noteref-588">{10}</a> But they
were not the only ones which influenced him in the choice of a
<i>locum tenens</i>. In a private letter to the Under Secretary
of the Home Department (Evan Nepean), <a href="#note-589" name=
"noteref-589" id="noteref-589">{11}</a> King stated that
Lieutenant Abbott had some months before taken an active part in
certain quarrels between the soldiers and settlers, and was not,
therefore, a desirable man to be entrusted with the command. In
addition, the subaltern next in rank below Abbott was alleged to
be addicted to habits of intemperance, and, therefore, ineligible
to take Abbott's place. Lieutenant Abbott was not disposed to
give way to Captain Nepean without a protest. He contemptuously
declared his intention of refusing to take any notice of King's
Order, and alleged that he did so not in his own name only, but
in that of the subaltern's as well. <a href="#note-590" name=
"noteref-590" id="noteref-590">{12}</a></p>
<p>This occurred the night before King's departure for New
Zealand. If Abbott had persisted, other steps would have been
necessary, but having slept on the matter, he adopted a more
prudent course. He went to King the next morning, and told him
that "he should not retard the service by continuing a
disobedience to the Order, but that he should represent the
oppression that he laboured under." In saying that he should
represent the "oppression" he suffered, he meant, no doubt, that
he would report it to his commanding officer in Sydney, as well
as to the War Office, and there can be little doubt that Abbot's
representation of the case had a great deal to do with the anger
which the proceedings excited in Grose's mind.</p>
<p>For some reason, which is not explained, King did not send to
Grose a separate statement of the reasons which induced him to go
to New Zealand, and to appoint Nepean instead of Abbott, to take
charge in his absence. Instead of doing that, he left open his
despatch to Dundas, to which Grose was referred for information.
This, in itself, may have been regarded as a want of respect.</p>
<p>On the 30th January, when the Francis was about to return to
Port Jackson, King wrote to Grose a long account of matters of
far greater consequence&mdash;the mutinous conduct of a portion
of the detachment, and the measures he had taken to protect the
settlers and convicts. Grose's reply, written on the 25th
February, 1794, <a href="#note-591" name="noteref-591" id=
"noteref-591">{13}</a> was in form an official despatch; in
substance it was an outburst of unreasonable anger and petulance:
it dealt with King's action in regard to the return of the New
Zealand natives, and also with the steps taken to subdue the
mutinous soldiers. In regard to the former. King's action was
declared to be an attempt to lessen the importance of Grose's
office. The appointment of Captain Nepean would, Grose alleged,
have afforded Lieutenant Abbott good grounds for resisting King's
orders; and the detention of the Britannia was unjustifiable and
deserving of the highest censure.</p>
<p>Grose makes it appear in this despatch that the chief causes
of his displeasure were King's departure from Norfolk Island
without permission, and the return of the New Zealanders before
his intentions regarding them had been ascertained. But it is
evident, from the little attention that is bestowed on these
points in the subsequent correspondence, "that these were not the
real causes.</p>
<p>Grose seems to have thought that as the New Zealand natives
had been delivered to him by Lieutenant Hanson, and been
forwarded by him to Norfolk Island, therefore, when they were no
longer required there, they should have been sent back to Sydney.
King himself intended in the first instance to take this course,
<a href="#note-592" name="noteref-592" id="noteref-592">{14}</a>
but there was no ship going to Port Jackson, and he adopted the
readiest way of returning the captives to their homes. Apart from
questions of etiquette and official rule, King did right. To send
the natives back to Port Jackson, so that the Lieutenant-Governor
there might forward them to New Zealand in his own way, would
have served no useful purpose. Moreover, King had given his word
to the natives that if they would communicate the information
they possessed they should be returned to their homes by the
first ship. Under this promise they gave the information, and
claimed the fulfilment of the undertaking. They had been "thrice
disappointed", and were making "hourly lamentations" because they
were still detained on Norfolk Island. King went out of his way
to restore the captives to their homes, from motives of humanity
and policy, not with the object of invading the authority or
position of his superior officer. If Grose really thought that
this had been done, the explanation given by King in his letter
of the 19th March, 1794, ought to have amply satisfied him.</p>
<p>King's appointment of Captain Nepean as his substitute.
instead of Lieutenant Abbott, appears to have been the real cause
of Grose's anger. He had determined that military rule should
prevail in the settlements. Almost the first step he took on
assuming the government was to destroy the civil authority in New
South Wales, and establish a military autocracy. With the
arrangements of Norfolk Island he did not then interfere,
apparently because no question as to the status of the military
had arisen. But King's action in appointing Nepean, and
afterwards in suppressing a mutiny among the soldiers, raised the
question in a very pointed manner. The Nepean appointment and the
mutiny had nothing to do with each other, but information
concerning the whole of the transactions&mdash;the visit to New
Zealand, the appointment of Captain Nepean, the consequent
difficulty with Lieutenant Abbott, and the suppression of the
mutiny&mdash;reached Grose at one and the same time, and were
considered together. King's proceedings throughout appear to have
been regarded by Grose as a deliberate design, not only to flout
his authority, but to belittle the military power which it was
his determination to make paramount. Grose's extravagant
condemnation of King was not endorsed by the authorities at
Whitehall. <a href="#note-593" name="noteref-593" id=
"noteref-593">{15}</a> Before adverting to the extreme measures
which Grose took to disparage King and propugn the military, it
is necessary to relate the leading circumstances of the mutiny
and its suppression. The affair was the subject of numerous
despatches and reports. A full and consecutive narrative will be
found in King's despatch to Dundas of the 10th March, 1794.
<a href="#note-594" name="noteref-594" id="noteref-594">{16}</a>
This account was written by King with the view of setting himself
right with the English authorities. It was transmitted through
Grose, who was asked to read it and forward it to the Secretary
of State with whatever observations he thought it desirable to
make. When Grose wrote his covering letter (eight months after
the events had transpired) his resentment appears to have
moderated, for he informed the Duke of Portland that the facts
were "very fairly and exactly stated" by King. The narrative may
be regarded, therefore, as an impartial and accurate statement of
the facts.</p>
<p>King, in stating his case, traced the origin of the mutiny.
mutinous disturbance to the intimacy which had sprang up between
the soldiers and the convicts; a practice which he unsuccessfully
endeavoured to prevent, although seconded, but not very actively,
by the officers. At first the two classes were on the best of
terms, but they began to drink and gamble together, and the
natural consequences followed. Quarrels arose, which at first
were merely personal, but as the convicts and soldiers, when
their disputes brought them under the notice of the authorities,
were not dealt, with alike, the two classes became hostile to
each other, and a very bitter feeling was engendered. The quarrel
was aggravated by the licentiousness of some of the soldiers, who
intrigued with the wives of the convict settlers, and continued
their improper conduct after they had been ordered by their
officers to desist. A soldier named Windsor, who had seduced a
settler's wife and had been forbidden to go near the place,
enticed the woman from her home, and the husband met the two
together. In his anger he struck the soldier, who made a
complaint. The settler, a man named Dring, <a href="#note-595"
name="noteref-595" id="noteref-595">{17}</a> whose sentence as a
convict had expired, was brought before the Justices, who fined
him twenty shillings. As the defendant had not the means of
payment, King allowed the fine to stand over until he had got in
his crops. He was also required to give security for good
behaviour towards Windsor for twelve months. The soldiers, who
had placed themselves upon a level with the convict population by
voluntarily associating with them, considered it a heinous
offence for one of that class to strike a member of the Corps,
and an outcry arose both against the levity of the sentence and
its suspension by the Lieutenant-Governor. A settler named Smith,
who was a friend of Dring and became his surety, was drawn into
the quarrel. Other disputes followed. The parties complained of
each other to the magistrates, who ordered in one instance a
hundred lashes to a convict named Cooper for striking a soldier,
but the punishment was remitted by King at the request of the
soldier and his comrades.</p>
<p>Things were brought to a crisis on one Saturday evening, the
18th January, when a play was being performed by the freed men
<a href="#note-596" name="noteref-596" id="noteref-596">{18}</a>
and convicts, with the permission of the Lieutenant-Governor, who
was present at the entertainment. <a href="#note-597" name=
"noteref-597" id="noteref-597">{19}</a> It is clear from what
followed that the soldiers had made up their mind to create a
disturbance. Some time before disturbance, the performance
commenced, one of the non-commissioned officers of the
detachment. Sergeant Whittle, entered the theatre, and insisted
on occupying a seat which had been reserved for the
Lieutenant-Governor's servants. He was remonstrated with by a
discharged convict, named Crowder, who was a constable as well as
one of the managers of the entertainment. Whittle refused to give
way, and a scuffle ensued, in which he received a blow from
Crowder. The disturbance which resulted was over before King
entered the place. He noticed, however, that a number of the
soldiers had come into the playhouse ill-dressed and dirty, and
with a demeanour that indicated their temper. After the
performance a collision between the soldiers and their opponents
took place, which wore a serious aspect from the fact that the
soldiers, who were very excited, had, in defiance of orders,
armed themselves with bayonets. King, whose house stood not more
than twenty yards from the place of entertainment, heard the
tumult and ran out. Seizing the first man he could get hold of, a
soldier named Bannister, who was rushing about with a bayonet in
his hand and using violent threats, he handed him over to the
guard, and ordered the people to disperse. The order was at once
obeyed. But from this point the affair took a serious turn. The
soldiers, excited though they were at the time, did not venture
to resist King's authority, but they called upon Lieutenant
Abbott to give Bannister his liberty. Lieutenant Abbott refused
their request, and advised them to retire to their barracks. This
they did; but, from a statement made to Lieutenant Abbott by a
drummer named Coulston, it appeared that they had formed a
determination to release their comrade, Bannister, by force if
their request was not complied with by the officers. On the
following day. Lieutenant Abbott, having heard something of what
was going on, "read to the detachment the oath of fidelity, and
spoke to them, saying that he would support his authority while
on this island." When the men got into the barracks the question
was discussed, and one of the number, a private named Cardell,
said that "they must support their authority too, and that no men
of the detachment should ever be punished on this island on
account of a prisoner, which was said likewise by Wilkinson, and
the men all consented to." <a href="#note-598" name="noteref-598"
id="noteref-598">{20}</a></p>
<p>Although, as it turned out, only a portion of the detachment
was seriously disaffected, it was apparent to King that a
dangerous mutiny was on foot. The position was one of gravity,
and immediate action was necessary. If the mutineers chose to
carry their intention into effect, there was no force to stop
them. They had possession of arms, and, if they acted together,
the settlement was at their mercy. King, after mature
consideration, made up his mind that the best course to pursue
was to deprive the mutineers of their arms, to appeal to the
loyalty of the well-disposed, and to enrol as a militia the men
of the marines who had taken up land as settlers, and were thus
interested in the preservation of order. The plan was carried
out, but not on the Lieutenant-Governor's own responsibility.
King was well aware that such a step would be a reflection on the
detachment, and that it was not likely to be regarded with
satisfaction by the Commandant at Sydney. Before taking action,
therefore, he determined to consult all the officers in the
settlement, both civil and military, and as it would have been
impossible to assemble the military officers at his quarters
without exciting the suspicion of the soldiers and so
jeopardising the scheme, he wrote out an Order, and had it laid
before the officers in detail. His views commended themselves to
the judgment of the whole staff, both civil and military, and the
action which followed was the result of an unanimous decision, to
which the officers of the Corps subscribed as readily as those
who belonged to the civil departments. It is important to bear
this in mind in considering the attitude assumed by Grose, who
threw the whole responsibility upon King.</p>
<p>The disarming of the detachment having been decided upon, the
next question was how to bring it about. If the men had been
openly required to give up their arms they would probably have
refused, in which case disastrous consequences would have ensued.
It was accordingly resolved to resort to stratagem.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 22nd January, a large body of the
soldiers was sent to Phillip Island for the purpose of collecting
wild-fowl feathers, and at the same time another portion was
ordered on duty to Queenborough, one of the out settlements. The
soldiers left at head-quarters were believed to be well affected,
although under the influence of the mutineers. At nine o'clock, a
number of settlers having been previously assembled in the
Lieutenant-Governor's house. Lieutenant Abbott, with Ensign Piper
and Mr. Grimes, Deputy Surveyor-General, took possession of the
arms belonging to the guard on duty. They were then joined by
Lieutenant Beckwith, who, with some of the settlers, took the
arms out of the barracks, without any opposition except that
offered by the sergeant on duty, who, on seeing Lieutenant
Abbott, desisted at once. On the return of the men from Phillip
Island and Queenborough, the ringleaders, twenty in number,
nearly one-third of the detachment, were arrested and placed in
confinement. <a href="#note-599" name="noteref-599" id=
"noteref-599">{21}</a></p>
<p>Having assembled the people, King read a proclamation, which
set forth the reasons which had led to the disarming of the
detachment, and the determination of himself and the officers of
the settlement to maintain order. He took advantage of the
occasion to remove the impression which appeared to have
existed&mdash;quite unfounded, as the facts prove&mdash;that he
had shown partiality to the convicts in their disputes with the
soldiers. He denounced the person or persons who had circulated
the false report, and declared that he would "as zealously
protect" the soldiers "from injustice or detraction" as he would
exert himself to "preserve good order and to defend the liberty
of the subject from all unlawful oppression." Those members of
the detachment who "had a just sense of the iniquity of their
refractory comrades" were assured that there was no intention of
attributing any blame to them. The result of the proceedings was
that the whole of the detachment, except the mutineers, took the
oath of fidelity, and order was reestablished. As a precaution,
however, against further aggression. King decided to embody as a
militia the marine and seamen settlers, forty-four in number.
They were described by King as "very steady men, and good
soldiers." The Government schooner Francis opportunely arrived
not many hours after order had been restored, and King resolved
to send the mutineers to Sydney for trial. As the little vessel
could not conveniently carry twenty prisoners, ten of the number
were pardoned. Lieutenant Beckwith, four non-commissioned
officers, and two privates were sent as a guard, and Beckwith was
instructed to give to Grose a full account of the mutiny and its
result.</p>
<p>King, being anxious to get rid of the mutineers, and to have
intelligence of the disturbance conveyed to Sydney, despatched
the Francis as soon as possible, and was, therefore, unable to
write a full account of the affair to his superior. This was an
unfortunate circumstance. It was not at all probable that Grose
would have received the intelligence with equanimity even if the
unwelcome news had been accompanied by a complete explanation,
but King would certainly have done more justice to himself and
the officers who acted with him, if he had sent at once the
fullest possible statement, instead of leaving Grose to obtain
information from Lieutenant Beckwith and the fragmentary reports
of which he was the bearer.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of the Francis at Sydney, Grose directed the
whole of the officers of the Corps then on duty at head-quarters
to form themselves into a Court of Inquiry to investigate the
circumstances of the mutiny. Grose's letter calling the Court
together was decidedly antagonistic to King. It concluded with a
direction to endeavour to discover if there was not some excuse
or reason for the mutinous conduct of the soldiers, and to
ascertain whether King's action in disarming the detachment was
justified. <a href="#note-600" name="noteref-600" id=
"noteref-600">{22}</a></p>
<p>The evidence on which the Court was expected to decide
consisted of the meagre account contained in King's letter of
30th January, 1794; <a href="#note-601" name="noteref-601" id=
"noteref-601">{23}</a> the depositions and General Orders which
accompanied it; an extract from a private letter from King to
Grose; and the <i>viv&acirc; voce</i> testimony of the accused
and their guards.</p>
<p>The finding of the Court, which was most adverse to King, can
only be explained on the assumption that the officers who were
sent as guards and witnesses, particularly Lieutenant Beckwith,
withheld from the Court a great deal of important information. In
no single particular was King's action approved of. While
admitting that the conduct of the soldiers was "highly
reprehensible", and "certainly mutinous", the Court was of
opinion that they ought to have been absolved from blame by
reason of the provocation and insult they had received. In fact,
it so far condoned their crime as to express its belief that they
had been forced to mutiny by the "licentious behaviour" of the
convicts. The extreme measure of disarming the detachment was
declared to have been quite unnecessary. The Court animadverted
in the most severe a terms upon the policy of King in regard to
the disputes between the soldiers and convicts, and expressed its
belief that the general conduct of the soldiers on the island
would not have discredited any regiment in his Majesty's
service.</p>
<p>The finding of the Court was sent to King by Grose on the
25th. February, 1794, with a very angry and intemperately-worded
despatch, and a General Order regulating the procedure to be
observed in subsequent disputes between the soldiers and
convicts. <a href="#note-602" name="noteref-602" id=
"noteref-602">{24}</a></p>
<p>In the despatch Grose expressed his astonishment and
mortification at what he termed King's "ill-judged and
unwarrantable proceedings". His opinions coincided in every point
with those of the Court, and in giving expression to them he made
no effort to conceal his anger and resentment beneath the
courteous forms of official correspondence. He declared that the
manner in which the convicts had been allowed by King to act
towards the soldiers was "sufficient to provoke the most obedient
to outrage", and directed him to immediately disband the militia
he had formed, and to send their arms to Sydney. Lieutenant
Townson was sent to take command of the detachment, and King, as
referred to him for all instructions concerning the control of
the military.</p>
<p>It is only just to Grose and his officers, however, to assume,
as King did, that Lieutenant Beckwith had not communicated all he
knew, and that therefore the decision was arrived at on
incomplete evidence. In regard to King's action in disarming the
detachment, the evidence brought forward by him in his despatch
to Dundas of 10th March, 1794, <a href="#note-603" name=
"noteref-603" id="noteref-603">{25}</a> and in his letters to
Grose, shows that when the decision was arrived at the men had
got completely beyond control. They had not only committed an act
of mutiny in arming themselves and attacking the convicts, they
had distinctly refused to obey the orders of the officer in
command, and had announced their intention of refusing to submit
to any discipline in cases where the convicts were concerned.
They had practically thrown off authority. King was fully
warranted in informing Dundas that, had a less effective step
been taken, the whole detachment would have risked the
consequences of resisting the authority of their officers.</p>
<p>In a letter to Grose, of the 19th March, 1794, <a href=
"#note-604" name="noteref-604" id="noteref-604">{26}</a> King
further explained that it was not simple refractoriness on the
part of the soldiers that led to the serious step of disarming
them. He called attention to the threats of violence made by the
soldiers against the settlers and convicts, as testified to by
Coulston the drummer, Spencer a marine settler, and Dollis a
convict of "general good character", and the alarm felt among the
people that the threats would be made good. He also pointed to
the fact that the soldiers had made known their determination to
prevent the execution of the sentence of a Court-martial on one
of their number for an offence against a convict. But for these
circumstances, "no steps of the kind which were taken would ever
have been thought of". King assured Grose that he had acted from
a sense of duty, and had taken the only course which seemed
likely to be effective. He saw that Grose and the officers who
constituted the Court of Inquiry had taken offence because, as it
seemed to them, an unnecessary reflection had been cast upon the
Corps. He did his best to convince Grose that he had disarmed the
detachment with extreme reluctance and under the pressure of
necessity, and that he had no desire to cast any reflection upon
those who were orderly and well disposed.</p>
<p>Grose's General Order <a href="#note-605" name="noteref-605"
id="noteref-605">{27}</a> for the future government of the
island, which accompanied his letter of the 25th February, 1794,
was a most remarkable document. It practically placed the soldier
beyond the reach of the established Court of Justice. In case any
assault, however aggravated, was committed by a convict or
expiree upon a member of the Corps, the General Order directed
the accused "immediately to be given up to commanding officer",
who was empowered to order him to be flogged by the drummers of
the detachment&mdash;even though he had received the greatest
provocation or had acted in self-defence. The Order, it will be
observed, was to apply not only to convicts but to those who,
having completed their period of transportation, were free men.
Similarly, the soldier was, if charged with any irregularities,
to be called before his officers, who would adjudicate, and whose
decision was to have the effect of a verdict of the Bench of
Magistrates. On no account whatever was a convict constable to
interfere with a soldier, even though engaged in the commission
of a crime. The system thus introduced indicates how determined
Grose was that military forms and procedure should dominate the
settlement at Norfolk Island, as they did at Sydney.</p>
<p>The clause which directed that convict constables
(<i>i.e</i>., men who had been chosen as constables after they
had served their sentences, or had been emancipated) were not on
any pretence to stop or seize a soldier, recalls the dispute
between Phillip and Ross as to the powers of the convict
night-watch. <a href="#note-606" name="noteref-606" id=
"noteref-606">{28}</a> Phillip, for the sake of peace and
quietness, withdrew a regulation which empowered the watch to
detain soldiers and sailors who were found straggling at night.
Grose, who was Governor at Sydney, as well as commander of the
Corps, went farther. He ordered that the constables were not to
interfere with a soldier, "although he should be detected in an
unlawful act". Interpreting this Order strictly, a soldier might
have been found robbing the Government stores or committing a
murder, but the constables were not to take any steps to restrain
the offender; they were to "endeavour to make themselves
acquainted with his person", and then give information to the
military authorities. This rule was emphasised in another Order,
which directed that all complaints against soldiers were to be
laid before the commanding officer of the detachment, "who will
never suffer the soldier to be given to the custody of a convict
constable". On the other hand, any soldier, whether an officer or
a private, was on his own responsibility to apprehend any convict
who misbehaved. It was necessary to give the soldiers this power,
of course; and there would have been no objection to the Order
had it not been accompanied by others, which placed the soldiers
beyond the reach of any authority but that of their officers.</p>
<p>While these Orders were injurious in themselves, they were
degrading to the Lieutenant-Governor of the island, who found his
position lowered and his authority contemned. The wrong was more
grievous by reason of the harsh language in which the
instructions were communicated.</p>
<p>"While he did not for a moment dispute Grose's right to make
these extraordinary changes in the government of the island, nor
forget for a moment the respect due to his official superior,
King made a vigorous protest to Dundas against the unjust and
degrading treatment he had received. <a href="#note-607" name=
"noteref-607" id="noteref-607">{29}</a> He pointed out that
Grose's order was an implied accusation of leniency on his part
towards the convict settlers against the soldiers. He indignantly
denied the charge, pointing out that whenever complaints of this
sort had been made the accused persons had been brought before
the Justices and dealt with. The Magistrates in those cases had
inflicted fines, a punishment which Grose considered ridiculously
inadequate to the offence; nothing short of a floggings in his
view, would meet offences of this enormity. But the Magistrates,
aided by King and Blackstone, had come to the conclusion that
they could not, under the laws of England, which they were
supposed to follow, order the lash to be applied to free men,
even for assaulting a soldier. Grose met this difficulty by
depriving the Magistrates of their authority, and placing the
Governor of the island below the lieutenant who had charge of the
detachment.</p>
<p>Grose's instructions&mdash;the main part of them at all
events&mdash;were immediately carried out. Lieutenant Townson
took the place of Lieutenant Abbott, who was recalled, the Orders
were promulgated, and Norfolk Island, like New South Wales, was
brought under military rule. The militia, consisting of men who
had served in Ross's detachment of marines, was disbanded, and
the arms with which the men had been supplied were taken away
from them, though not without a protest on their part. It seems
that these settlers, when they took up land at Norfolk Island,
had been promised by Phillip firearms for the protection of their
lives and property. In a petition to Grose, 10th March, 1794,
<a href="#note-608" name="noteref-608" id="noteref-608">{30}</a>
they pointed out that they had always considered their arms as
their own property during their residence on the island, and that
they were rendered necessary by. the fact that numbers of them
had been repeatedly robbed and insulted on their own
property.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Townson established himself in the house of the
Chaplain. Under Grose's authority, he chose for his own use and
that of the officers of the department some land which had been
cultivated by officers and overseers, who had enjoyed a
permissive occupancy. Determined, apparently, to have the same
privileges as his brother-officers in Sydney and Parramatta, he
applied at once for the labour of ten convicts, and five for each
of his subalterns. Hitherto the number of convicts assigned for
the whole detachment was only twelve. When Townson made the
application there was a pressing demand for labour to get in the
crops and prepare the Government ground for seed, and as King had
not received any instructions from head-quarters, on this point,
he did not comply with the request, but wrote for fuller
instructions.</p>
<p>All the changes directed to be made by Grose were loyally
carried out by King, notwithstanding the humiliation which his
compliance involved. He was rewarded by a confession on the part
of Grose that he had written hastily and unjustly, and by the
approval of the Secretary of State. In forwarding King's account
of the disturbances at Norfolk Island to Dundas, Grose wrote,
under date the 30th August, 1794:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As whatever has happened is very fairly and exactly
stated by this officer, I shall not myself say anything on the
subject, excepting that I am well assured he will be much
mortified should it appear to you he has acted improperly; and as
my letter to Lieutenant-Governor King, of which you receive from
him the copy, was written at a time when the situation of the
colony did not wear the most pleasing aspect, it may, in some
degree, account for my having expressed myself in such severe
terms to an officer of whom I should be exceedingly sorry if any
unfavourable conclusions were drawn from anything I felt it my
duty at that time to say." <a href="#note-609" name="noteref-609"
id="noteref-609">{31}</a></blockquote>
<p>In this letter Grose relieved King from blame, and at the same
time accused himself of harshness and injustice. But, considering
that in the despatch which King sent to Dundas, Grose's action
was elaborately criticised, it seems strange that the latter had
nothing to say on the subject.</p>

<br>
<p>Before these transactions came under the notice of the
Secretary of State, Grose had left the colony, and if there was
any correspondence between him and the Government on the subject,
it must have taken place after his return to England. The
communication, if any, was probably verbal. The Records, at all
events, do not show that any official letters passed between
Grose and the Home Department with regard to his treatment of
King. King obtained from Grose's successor a copy of the minutes
of the Court of Inquiry, and discovered from them that Lieutenant
Beckwith had withheld most material information; and that
Sergeant Ikins and Private Bannister had misled the Court by
false evidence. Some light is thrown on this matter by a passage
in the manuscript journal of Lieutenant-Governor King (July,
1794), in which he expressed disappointment and concern that
Grose had not thought proper to make any other reply to his long
letter of the 19th March, 1794, <a href="#note-610" name=
"noteref-610" id="noteref-610">{32}</a> than by sending him a
copy of his letter to Dundas, in which he confessed that he had
been in the wrong, <a href="#note-611" name="noteref-611" id=
"noteref-611">{33}</a> "I also", King went on to say, "received a
private intimation that Governor Grose was ready to suppress it
(King's letter of explanation and remonstrance) altogether. This
proposal I could not hesitate agreeing to, on condition of the
Court of Inquiry revising their decision, or some act exculpating
me from the unjust censure that has been heaped on me." So far as
can be ascertained from the Records, the Court did not revise its
decision, nor was anything done to justify King's conduct until
it received the formal approval of the authorities in a despatch
sent to Governor Hunter soon after he had taken command at
Sydney. Previous to that event a change had taken place in the
personnel of the British Government, which, probably, accounts
for the fact that King's long letter to the Secretary of State
was unanswered. On the 11th July, 1794, Dundas retired from the
Home Department, and his place was taken by the Duke of Portland.
Writing to Hunter on the 10th June, 1795, when the new Governor
was on his way to Sydney, the Duke of Portland intimated that he
had received the despatches of Grose from April to August, 1794,
together with two letters from King. Having considered this
correspondence, the Duke of Portland gave his decision, which, on
the whole, was an approval of King's conduct. The only exception
was the trip to New Zealand:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have maturely considered the statement made by
Lieutenant Governor King of the transactions in Norfolk Island
referred to in Lieut.-Governor Grose's letter of the 30th August,
and I am far from imputing to Lieut.-Governor King any degree of
blame which calls for serious reprehension. What I most object to
is his quitting his government and departing with the New
Zealanders in the Britannia without previous communication with
Lieut.-Governor Grose.<br>
<br>
"With respect to the mutinous detachment that was sent from the
island, I am truly sorry to observe that their conduct was such
as to merit much severer treatment than it met with. The source
of their disorderly conduct and of their disobedience clearly
arose from their having been improperly permitted to mix and
interfere with the other inhabitants, but particularly with the
convicts, from whom, as their situation and their duties are
perfectly separate and distinct, so should their conversation and
connections. The best proof I can receive that both the one and
the other are properly governed will be that matters of dispute
seldom arise between them, and for this plain reason, because
they should neither of them ever be in the way of it. But
whenever such disputes do arise, strict and impartial justice
must decide between the parties, for whoever misconducts himself
must be considered as losing all title to preference or
distinction from being of a different class or description.<br>
<br>
"I have thought it necessary to express my sentiments more folly
on this subject, because I am inclined to think that the General
Orders of Lieut.-Governor Grose, dated 25th February, 1794,
transmitted to Lieut.-Governor King, must have been hastily
conceived on the pressure of the moment, and without due
attention to the principle I have above mentioned, and which in
the distribution of justice should never be lost sight of.<br>
<br>
"I am of opinion it would be better, whenever such disputes
arise, which, I trust will be very rarely, that the complaint in
the first instance should always be guided by and follow the
mature and description of the person.<br>
<br>
"Thus, if a convict, or any civil person, is complained of, the
complaint should be to the Governor or the nearest magistrate; if
a military person, to the Commander-in-Chief, or nearest officer,
as the case may require."</blockquote>
<p>Practically, this despatch is a vindication of King, and a
condemnation of the military authorities as represented by
Grose.</p>
<p>The Duke of Portland expressed the opinion that if the
settlement was properly governed&mdash;that is to say, if the two
classes were kept apart&mdash;disputes would seldom arise; but if
disputes did occur he was particular in stating that "strict and
impartial justice must decide between the parties." This was the
wholesome principle that a Minister of the Crown might have been
expected to lay down; but it would be difficult to find any trace
of it in Grose's Orders, which distinctly favoured the soldier,
and placed the rest of the people at a disadvantage. As the Duke
of Portland was writing to a third person, he could not have
censured Grose in this despatch; but it is clear that in the
estimation of the Secretary of State a mistake had been made.
Practically, the instructions contained in the despatch to Hunter
abrogated Grose's Orders, and restored the government of the
island to the footing which it had previously enjoyed.</p>
<p>The restoration took place in April, 1796, when King,
authorised by Letters Patent from the Crown, cancelled Grose's
Orders, and substituted others embodying the principles laid down
in the Duke of Portland's despatch. King, in making the change,
showed a consideration for the feelings of others which was in
striking contrast with the harsh treatment he had received from
Grose and the officers of the New South Wales Corps. Writing to
the Duke of Portland on the 30th May, 1796, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As I have ever considered an obedience to orders as
indispensable, I have not hitherto allowed a deviation of
Lieut-Gov'r Grose's Orders of 25th Feb'y, 1794, until now, when
it has been done in such a manner as not to hurt the feelings of
anyone present or absent, which I hope will be obvious from the
tenour of the enclosed Proclamation made publick on the day the
patent was read."</blockquote>
<p>The Proclamation in question annulled certain Orders and
confirmed others. Those issued by Grose in February, 1794, which
conflicted with the directions received from the Home Department,
were abrogated; those which did not conflict were retained. In
this King's kindly disposition showed itself. A man of less
generous mind would have given effect to his instructions without
troubling himself about the feelings of others.</p>

In a private letter to Nepean, 19th November, 1793, King
says:&mdash;"I am confident much publick good would result to the
commerce of Great Britain and these colonies if a settlement was
made at the Bay of Islands on the river Thames. . . . Since my
return from that country I am more confirmed in its apparent
utility." Returning to the subject at the close of the letter, he
wrote:&mdash;"If N.Z. should be seriously thought on, would it
not be advisable for some person to examine the country before
any people are sent there? I should have no objection to
performing that service, which might be completed in two months
on sailing from hence." In another letter to Nepean, written
about the same time, King says:&mdash;"If it should be thought
necessary to settle N.Z., and I should happen to be the person
fixed on, I hope my family, which is now growing numerous, will
be considered."&mdash;Historical Records, vol. ii, pp. 79,

Abbott afterwards acknowledged that he had no authority to use
the names of these officers. King told Nepean that he "received a
letter from Ensign Piper denying that he had ever given Lieut.
Abbott the least reason to make use of his name (in refusing to
obey the order), as Lieut. Abbott had not even spoken to him on
this business previous to his (Lieut. A.) coming to me, and
making use of both the officers' names. The other sub'n was so

King, in his Journal, explains his reasons for sanctioning the
play:&mdash;"A short time ago one of the magistrates informed me
that some of the free men and convicts had applied to him to
request my permitting them to get up a play, and to allow them to
perform it on Saturdays, when they were perfect in their
respective parts. As indulging them in this request did not
interfere with the publick work, and as such amusements (when
unattended with licentious behaviour) tend to unbend and divert
the mind, I very readily gave my consent, on condition that the
magistrate who made the application would see it conducted with
decency and propriety. With some little assistance the scenery,
&amp;c., was well arrang'd, and two plays were performed during
this month, in which the actors acquitted themselves with great
propriety, and the utmost regularity and decency was observed."
This was in September, 1793, three months before the disturbance
occurred. Theatrical performances were afterwards prohibited.</p>

H.M.S. GUARDIAN.<br>
<br>
<small>ACCOUNT OF THE DISASTER THAT BEFELL HIS MAJESTY'S SHIP<br>
GUARDIAN, LIEUTENANT RIOU, COMMANDER.</small></h3>
<p class="blok" align="right"><a href="#note-612" name=
"noteref-612" id="noteref-612">{1}</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><small>THIS</small> ship was fitted out in a most
expensive manner, and furnished with all sorts of stores and
provisions for the new settlement at Botany Bay; and had a very
prosperous voyage till she arrived at the Cape of Good Hope,
where she recruited her provisions and increased the number of
her live stock beyond any former precedent.<br>
<br>
On the 24th of December, 1789, being in lat 44&deg; S. and long.
41&deg; 30' E. of London, the weather extremely foggy, we saw an
island of ice about three miles to the S.W. Lieutenant Riou gave
directions to stand towards it, in order to collect lumps of ice
to supply the ship with water. This proceeding was judged highly
expedient, as the daily demand of water was prodigious, owing to
the great quantity of cattle on board. As the ship approached the
island, the boats were hoisted out and manned, and several lumps
collected. During this time the ship lay-to; and on the supply of
water being brought on board, she attempted to stand away. Very
little apprehension was at this time entertained of her safety,
although the monstrous bulk of the island occasioned an
unfavourable current, and, in some measure, gave a partial
direction to the wind.<br>
<br>
On a sudden the base of the island, which projected under water
considerably beyond the limits of the visible part, struck the
bow of the ship; she instantly swung round, and her head cleared;
but her stem, coming on the shoal, struck repeatedly, and the sea
being very heavy, her rudder broke away, and all her works abaft
were shivered. The ship in this situation became in a degree
embayed under the terrific bulk of ice, the height of which was
twice that of the mainmast of a ship of the line.<br>
<br>
At this critical moment the captain and officers retaining their
spirit, their example and vigorous exertion led the people to
their duty; but it was with difficulty they were prevailed on to
overcome the first panic and lend their assistance to trim and
fill the sails. This being at last effected, and the
foretopgallant-sail and staysails between the fore and main masts
being set on the ship, she began to forge off, and the same
instant struck with greater force, if possible, than before,
nearly abreast of the main-chains, kept crashing for some time
along the ice under her, and at last shot entirely clear of it.
The weather continued very foggy, and the wind blowing strong, we
soon lost sight of the ice. Our spirits then gained new vigour,
and served to supply fresh strength, and to support us under the
afflictions which were yet in embryo.<br>
<br>
From the commencement of these misfortunes to this short interval
of better hope includes about the space of half an hour; and the
cheering prospect again vanished as a flash of lightning.<br>
<br>
At about a quarter past eight the carpenter came up from sounding
the well, and reported two feet water in the hold, and that it
was increasing very fast. The pumps were ordered to be rigged and
got to work, and all the officers and people joined in a diligent
and spirited compliance therewith. The chain-pumps were at first
found to be much out of order, which caused some delay. Meantime
all the hands that could be spared were set to work to clear the
deck of the cattle, &amp;c., holding themselves in readiness,
however, to man the pumps, which about nine o'clock were all at
work; and three or four of the people were left between decks to
hoist up and heave overboard whatever they could manage. The
water had at this time increased to three feet and a half, and
was still gaining on all the pumps. The few hands left between
decks did almost more than their strength could be expected to
effect: In the course of half an hour they got up and hove
overboard most of the bags of flour, pease, wheat, barley,
&amp;c., received at the Cape of Good Hope, besides two hogsheads
of tobacco. At about ten, water had increased to five feet.<br>
<br>
Since the first of our misfortunes there had not been an officer
or man unemployed. It was, however, impossible that the few hands
we had could hold out much longer, if employed together; a
reservation was therefore made by dividing the whole of the
officers, seamen, convicts, &amp;c., into two watches, to relieve
alternately. About half-past ten, the first division went to the
pumps. At this time the captain ordered refreshments to be
allotted to each man, taking particular care that the grog should
not be made too strong. Every man received a dram for the first
supply, with biscuit and cheese, which seemed to give them fresh
spirits. The rum above was soon nearly expended; but the captain
thought it would be extremely dangerous to open the hold to get
at more, for fear of the men's getting at it. Wine and water was
accordingly given in lieu.<br>
<br>
At midnight the water had increased to six feet, and it was then
blowing a very strong gale. At daybreak a few hands were set
about filling one of the lower studding sails with oakum, and the
off watch were ordered to get it under the ship's bottom, which
was found to be extremely difficult The leak, however, gained
upon us near a foot of water during this application. By
unwearied exertions at the pumps it became reduced, and continued
diminishing till near eleven o'clock, when the water was reduced
to only nineteen inches.<br>
<br>
At half-past eleven we were, however, unhappily informed that the
leak had again gained upon us some inches, and continued to do
so, more or less, for a short time. Another sail was then
prepared for a second fothering, which again encouraged our
hopes. At noon the water was twenty-seven inches, the ship's head
about W., the wind blowing very hard.<br>
<br>
Dec. 25.&mdash;It still continued to blow a strong gale, the sea
running extremely high, often breaking over the ship with great
violence. Between one and three in the afternoon, the second
fothering was got under the ship's bottom. About this time
several of the crew became almost unable to perform any duty. The
weather was likewise uncommonly piercing. At four the water again
gained on us, when Mr. Clements went down by the way of the
rudder into the gun-room, and from thence into the bread and
spirit rooms, to endeavour to discover the leak, but without
effect. It was then thought fit to endeavour to scuttle the deck
close aft, which, being out of the roll of the water, would
enable us to get up and heave overboard some more of the
cargo.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the captain, the chaplain, the purser, and two men
were employed in this business, but unfortunately endeavouring to
heave up a cask, it fell back on the captain, and bruised his
hand in so shocking a manner as to disable him from giving any
farther assistance. This endeavour was then given up, and all
hands were again set to the pumps.<br>
<br>
At five the water increased to four feet, and at midnight to four
feet and a half. At this time the starboard pump became disabled,
from the wrench breaking; and the leak from that time gained upon
us very fast.<br>
<br>
At four in the morning the water was reported to have increased
to six feet, and at six to seven feet. About this time the people
began to break off occasionally from the pumps, and to secrete
themselves, and could only be kept to their duty by threatening
to have them thrown overboard During the night, the fore and
maintop sails were shivered by the violence of the wind, and the
ship left entirely at the mercy of a most tremendous sea, the
dreadful prospect being rendered still more dismal by the thick,
black, stormy clouds, which appeared as if collected to hide our
misfortunes from the compassionate eye of Providence.<br>
<br>
The people till now had been kept unacquainted with the true
state of the ship, which had hitherto been reported favourable,
when one of the carpenters stationed to sound the well, came up,
and reported that the water was as high as the hallop-deck, and
gaining above a foot every half-hour. The officers could not
possibly suppress this report; and many of the people; who were
really unable to bear the fatigue any longer, immediately
desponded, and gave themselves up to perish with the ship. A part
of those who had got any strength left, seeing that their utmost
efforts to save the ship were likely to be in vain, applied to
the officers for the boats, which were promised to be got in
readiness for them. and the boatswain was directly ordered to put
the masts, sails, and compass in each. The cooper was also set to
work to fill a few quarter-casks of water out of some of the
butts on deck, and provisions and other necessaries were got up
from the hold.<br>
<br>
Many hours previous to this, Lieutenant Riou had privately
declared to his officers that he saw the final loss of the ship
was inevitable, and could not help regretting the loss of so many
brave fellows. "As for me," said he, "I have determined to remain
in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful as
long as there is any occasion for it."<br>
<br>
He was entreated, and even supplicated, to give up this fatal
resolution, and try for safety in the boats. It was even hinted
to him how highly criminal it was to persevere in such a
determination; but he was not to be moved by any entreaties.<br>
<br>
He was, notwithstanding, as active in providing for the safety of
the boats as if he intended to take the opportunity of securing
his own escape. He was throughout as calm and collected as in the
happier moments of his life.<br>
<br>
At seven o'clock she had settled considerably abaft, and the
water was coming in at the rudder-case in great quantities. At
half-past seven the water in the hold obliged the people below to
come upon deck; the ship appeared to be in a sinking state, and
settling bodily down; it was, therefore, almost immediately
agreed to have recourse to the boats. While engaged in
consultation on this melancholy business, Mr. Riou wrote a letter
to the Admiralty, which he delivered to Mr. Clements. It was as
follows:&mdash;</blockquote>
<p class="blok" align="right">"H.M.S. Guardian,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"Dec. 25, 1789.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>"If any part of the officers or crew of the Guardian
should ever survive to get home, I have only to say their
conduct, after the fatal stroke against an island of ice, was
admirable and wonderful in everything that relates to their duty,
considered either as private men, or in his Majesty's
service.<br>
<br>
"As there seems to be no possibility of my remaining many hours
in this world, I beg leave to recommend to the consideration of
the Admiralty a sister, who, if my conduct or service should be
found deserving any memory, their favour might be shown to,
together with a widowed mother.</blockquote>
<p class="blok" align="right">I am, &amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"E. Riou.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>"Phil. Stephens, Esq."<br>
<br>
He then ordered the boats to be hoisted out, in order to afford a
chance of safety to as many as he could with propriety. The
people who were able were accordingly collected together, and the
cutter hoisted out on the lee-side, and afterwards the other
boats on the booms. They were, fortunately, all got into the
water with very little damage; but the sea running immensely
high, it was with difficulty they were kept from being stove
alongside, The launch being forced to drop on the quarter, to
make room for the two cutters, was nearly drawn under the quarter
and sunk, and at last obliged to cast adrift from the ship, with
only seven or eight men on board, and without any provision or
water. A coil of rope was then handed from the quarter-gallery,
and passed over to Mr. Somerville, the gunner, in the jolly-boat,
which hung over the stem. This boat, on being lowered down, was
drawn under and sunk. As soon as the launch had again rowed a
little nearer to the ship, one of the people in her caught hold
of a rope, until the cutters brought them provisions, &amp;c.,
and veered to a good distance astern. A small quantity of
biscuit, and an eighteen-gallon cask of water, was then let down
between the main and mizen-chains into the small cutter, which
was the last thing taken in. The purser then got into the
main-chains, and from thence leaped into her; Mr. Wadman and Mr.
Tremlett likewise, fortunately, got into the boat from the
mizen-chains. It was with great difficulty rowed clear of the
ship, and steered for the launch.<br>
<br>
The agitation of mind on this melancholy occasion may be better
imagined than described. Mr. Riou was at this moment walking the
quarter-deck, and seemed happy the boat had got safe from
alongside The ship was drifting astern, and gradually sinking in
the water. Mr. Clements began to be afraid she would drive upon
the launch; he therefore called to the crew to cut the tow-rope,
and row out of the ship's wake.<br>
<br>
Mr. Somerville, the gunner, who was looking over the ship's stem,
hearing the order, prayed them to hold fast a moment, and he
would jump overboard and swim to them; he did so, and was
followed by John Spearman, seaman, who were both received safe,
and the boat then cut, and rowed out of the ship's track. About
three-quarters past eight we got alongside the cutter, and Mr.
Clements, Mr. Wadman, Mr. Tremlett, and the purser, with one or
two more of the men, went on board, and took two bags of biscuit
and a cask of water. The crew were ordered back to the ship for
further supplies, and to receive as many of the people as could
with safety be taken on board.<br>
<br>
They were not, however, to be prevailed on to return, but rowed
off to some distance, and lay-by to observe our motions. The Rev.
Mr. Crowther left the ship in the cutter, and got an opportunity
of joining the launch while making the exchange. There wen then
left on board the cutter, Mr. Brady, midshipman, Mr. Fletcher,
captain's clerk, and five seamen.<br>
<br>
By this time the jolly-boat had nearly come within bail, and we
lay-by till informed of her situation; she brought with her
neither provision, water, compass, or quadrant. Hence we were
reduced to the sad medium of consulting our safety alone; and
perhaps never did the human mind struggle under greater
difficulties than we experienced in being obliged to leave so
many behind, in all probability to perish; but it was evident
that more people could not with propriety be received on board
the launch, from our quantity of provisions, viz., two bags of
biscuit of about 100 lb. each, two mutton hams of five pounds
each, a goose, two fowls, about twelve pounds of butter, a
cheese, a small keg of rum containing about four gallons, and a
small rum-cask of water, marked on the head twenty gallons. This
was a very inadequate sustenance for fifteen souls already in the
boat, who had to traverse the vast distance of 411 leagues in a
boisterous ocean, without any means of relief.<br>
<br>
There being yet a spare compass and quadrant in the launch, they
were, by Mr. Clements' direction, handed into the jolly-boat. At
this time one of the convicts attempted to get on board us, but
was opposed by all, and pushed into the sea. The fellow in the
struggle caught hold of Mr. Clements, who was with difficulty
saved from being pulled out of the boat along with him. The
people in the jolly-boat picked the man up again, and then took
to their oars, and rowed close upon our quarter, as if determined
to board us by force. To prevent, therefore, any scuffle, it was
immediately agreed to make sail; and we took our final departure
from this scene of misery and distress at about nine o'clock. The
ship at this time appeared sunk down to her upper-deck ports. The
large cutter, which was watching our motions, immediately made
sail after us, but in a short time fell much to leeward. Mr.
Clements thought they intended making for Prince Edward's or
Marion's and Crozet's Island. The small cutter remained hanging
on at a distance from the ship. They also stepped their masts in
the jolly-boat, and made sail after us; but, disappearing almost
at the same moment, we think the boat filled and went down.<br>
<br>
At ten o'clock we had a hard squall of wind, with a heavy fall of
rain; at half-past eleven lost sight of the ship and small
cutter, At noon observed the latitude to be 44 deg. 7 min. S.;
the boat was kept as much to the northward as the sea would
allow. The wind at this time was about N.W.<br>
<br>
Dec. 26.&mdash;Strong gales, squally and cloudy weather, with
remarkably high seas. We were this night very much numbed and
chilled with cold, and could get no sleep. In the morning the
weather became more moderate. At four o'clock shifted the
fore-mast to its proper place, stepped the main-mast, and set the
fore and main sails; at eight the people were employed to make a
maintop-sail out of some sheets, and a yard out of one of the
boat's thwarts; the hand of a broken oar was converted into a
top-mast. A small tobacco-cannister was cut up to make a measure
for the distribution of the water, rather less than a jill, two
of which it was agreed to allow each man a day.<br>
<br>
Dec. 27.&mdash;First part, moderate breezes and cloudy weather.
At one p.m., having boiled all our poultry, and cut up the goose,
which was but small, into fifteen equal parts, one of the men
forward was then blindfolded, and directed to call each person by
name, and another was appointed to serve out the morsel by lots.
Notwithstanding we had now fasted above thirty hours, all were
perfectly satisfied with the small morsel; and some had so little
appetite that they reserved a part of it for a future occasion.
But the very scanty measure of water received afterwards by no
means allayed the universal craving for drink, evidently
occasioned by the excessive heat and feverish state of our
bodies. We did not dare, however, to take one drop more than the
prescribed allowance. We therefore, through necessity, became
philosophers, and submitted with becoming resolution to the
exigencies of the moment. At seven we received our second measure
of water, which, being succeeded by the coldness of the night,
administered greatly to our relief. At midnight it blew a fresh
gale, with dark, cloudy, and remarkably cold weather. The launch
was at this time brought under her main-sail only, and the
weather continuing much the same, no alteration was made
throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Dec. 28.&mdash;The first part fresh gales and cloudy weather,
middle more moderate. About noon we had one of the fowls cut up,
and divided amongst us, as on the preceding day, and then
received our jill of water. The heat and fever of our bodies
increased, and our lips began to break out in watery and ulcerous
blisters. This day one of the crew, being afraid of famishing,
requested his whole quantity of water for the day at one serving,
which Mr. Clements opposed. He therefore had recourse to
salt-water, of which he drank freely. At five in the morning got
the top-mast up, and set the top-sail; at ten fresh gales,
lowered and took in the top-sail. In these seas are constantly
vast numbers of sea-fowl flying about; and had we been fortunate
enough to have had a fowling-piece we could not have been much at
a loss for provisions. Powder and shot we had in store, and two
brace of pistols, but were unable to do any execution with
them.<br>
<br>
Dec. 29.&mdash;This day cut up and divided our last fowl, and
shared our water as before. At daybreak strong gales, with flying
showers of rain, from which we endeavoured to benefit as much as
possible by facing the weather with our mouths open and
handkerchiefs spread out; but the drifting moisture was so thin
and light that we were barely able to catch sufficient to wet our
lips. This morning we received a small thimbleful of rum each,
which was occasionally allowed.<br>
<br>
Dec. 30.&mdash;We were this day reduced to a very low ebb indeed,
and could not eat the smallest crumb till supplied with an
additional measure of water to moisten our lips, which were
almost held together by a tough viscid phlegm that could not be
expectorated but with the greatest difficulty. On this occasion
we dipped our bit of biscuit in the water; and afterwards supped
a little of it with each mouthful to force it down. The butter,
cheese, and hams were left free for the use of everyone, for they
were found to occasion greater thirst, and therefore remained
almost untouched Several of the crew had again recourse to the
salt-water, which appeared not to have any bad effect.<br>
<br>
Dec. 31.&mdash;We again suffered greatly this day from the
burning heat of the sun, and the parched state of our bodies, and
were allowed an additional measure of water, with a larger
portion of rum than usual, in which we soaked our bit of biscuit,
and made our meal of it. About four in the afternoon the clouds
began to shew for rain, and we made preparations accordingly; but
were so unfortunate as to see it fall in heavy showers all around
us, and had barely as much over the boat as would wet our
handkerchiefs.<br>
<br>
The people this day appeared to be in a more hopeless state than
ever, and discovered signs of disrespect to their officers, which
was, however, happily checked in time by the spirited conduct of
the gunner, who chastised the leader in the face of the whole
crew, and restored discipline. Many of the people this day drank
their own urine, and others tried the salt-water. The weather was
this day more warm and sultry than at any time since our
misfortunes.<br>
<br>
Jan. 1.&mdash;We dined this day as on the preceding, and in
general appeared in better spirits, which we considered, on
account of its being the first day of the new year, a happy
presage of our safety.<br>
<br>
Jan. 2.&mdash;Clear weather till about 4 in the afternoon, when
it became overcast and blew a fresh gale. We had before this
dined on our usual fare of biscuit and water, with half a measure
of rum, and were all in tolerable spirits; but the gale
increasing during the night, and the sea running immensely high,
brought us again into great danger, which, with the
disappointment of not seeing land in the morning, as expected,
reduced us to our former miserable state of despondency. At eight
in the evening the fore-sail was shifted to the main-mast, and
the boat sailed under it reefed till about six in the morning,
when the mizen was set on the foremast, to give her greater
steerage-way. At noon the latitude was by observation 33 deg. 19
min., and supposed longitude E. of Greenwich 34 deg. 15 min.<br>
<br>
Jan. 3&mdash;About seven in the evening the clouds put on the
appearance of a very heavy rain, but unfortunately broke over in
a most dreadful storm of thunder and lightning, attended with
gusts of wind and very little rain, succeeded by a violent gale
of several hours from the S.W., in which we were near perishing.
On this occasion the master and the gunner succeeded each other
at the helm, and by their experience and judgment in the
management of the boat, we were this night enabled to traverse in
safety an ocean of such fierce and tremendous seas, in different
directions, as we could scarcely allow ourselves the hope of
escaping.<br>
<br>
At daybreak the gunner, who was then at the helm, discovered a
ship at a little distance from us laying under her bare poles,
Our joy at this sight was great beyond expression, and, anxious
to secure so favourable an occasion, we immediately made more
sail, and between five and six o'clock passed close under her,
and informed her people of our distresses. We then veered about,
and put alongside her on the other tack.<br>
<br>
The people on board her crowded immediately to our assistance,
and received us in the most friendly manner. As soon as we were
alongside, several of them jumped in, and assisted in keeping the
boat from being stove.<br>
<br>
This ship was named the Viscountess of Britannie, a French
merchantman, Martin Doree, master, with part of Walsh's or 95th
Regiment, from the Isle of France, to touch at the Cape of Good
Hope for a supply of water and provisions, on her way to Europe.
The officers of this corps were unbounded in their friendship and
attention towards us, affording us every possible comfort, and
even giving up their beds for our use.<br>
<br>
Jan. 18.&mdash;At noon anchored in Table Bay, Cape of Good
Hope.<br>
<br>
But to return to the ship. She continued some days in the same
state as at the departure of the boats, at the mercy of the winds
and waves, without a rudder, and every instant in danger of being
swallowed up in the abyss. Attempts, however, were made by the
crew occasionally to reduce the water, when their strength
permitted, and thus, by wonderful exertions, was the Guardian
kept afloat till a Dutch packet-boat from the Spice Islands and
Batavia, providentially steering a high southerly latitude, fell
in with her, afforded her aid of men and materials, and enabled
her to make good her way back to the Cape of Good Hope, and kept
her company during her course. The Guardian was full 400 leagues
from the Cape when she fell in with the island of
ice.</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<small>ENABLING ACT&mdash;REMISSION OF SENTENCES.
[1790]</small></h3>
<br>
<p class="blok" align="center">30 Geo. III, cap. 47.</p>
<blockquote><small>AN</small> Act for enabling his Majesty to
authorize his Governor or Lieutenant-Governor of such places
beyond the seas to which felons or other offenders may be
transported to remit the sentences of such offenders.<br>
<br>
<small>WHEREAS</small> by several Orders made by his Majesty, by
and with the advice of his Privy Council, in pursuance of
authority given to his Majesty in that behalf by an Act passed in
the twenty-fourth year of his Majesty's reign, intituled, "An Act
for the effectual transportation of felons and other offenders,
and to authorize the removal of prisoners in certain cases, and
for other purposes therein mentioned", his Majesty hath declared
and appointed, by and with the advice aforesaid, that the eastern
coast of New South Wales, and the islands thereto adjacent,
should be the place or places beyond sea to which certain felons
and other offenders should be conveyed and transported: And
whereas several felons and other offenders have, in pursuance of
the said Act, been conveyed and transported to the eastern coast
of New South Wales, or the islands thereunto adjacent, there to
remain during the terms or times for which they were so
respectively sentenced to be transported by the Courts in which
they were convicted: And whereas his Majesty, by and with the
advice of his Privy Council, may hereafter declare and appoint
the place or places aforesaid, or some other place or places
beyond the sea, to be the place or places to which other felons
and offenders shall hereafter be conveyed and transported: And
such felons and offenders may be so transported accordingly: And
whereas it would greatly advance the design of such sentences so
carried into execution as aforesaid, or which may hereafter be
passed and carried into execution, that the Governor, or (in case
of his death or absence) the Lieutenant-Governor for the time
being, of such the place or places as aforesaid should have power
and authority to remit or shorten the time or term for which
felons and offenders as aforesaid have been or shall hereafter be
transported, in cases where it shall appear that such felons or
other offenders are proper objects of the Royal Mercy. Be it
therefore enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Lords, spiritual and temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
authority of the same, that it shall be lawful for his Majesty,
his heirs and successors, at all times, by his or their
Commission, under the Great Seal of Great Britain, to authorize
and empower the Governor or the Lieutenant-Governor for the time
being of such place or places as aforesaid, or of any of them, by
an instrument in writing under the Seal of the Government in
which the place or places as aforesaid are or shall be situated,
to remit, either absolutely or conditionally, the whole or any
part of the time or term for which any such felons or other
offenders aforesaid shall have been or shall hereafter be
respectively conveyed and transported to such place or places as
aforesaid; and that such instrument or instruments shall have the
like force and effect to all intents and purposes as if his
Majesty, his heirs and successors, had in such cases respectively
signified his or their Royal intention of mercy under his or
their Sign-manual.<br>
<br>
II. And be it further enacted: That such Governor or
Lieutenant-Governor as aforesaid shall, by the first opportunity,
transmit to one of his Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State,
a duplicate, under the Seal of the Government, of each and every
instrument as aforesaid, by which the time or term of
transportation of any such felons or other offenders as aforesaid
hath been remitted or shortened, and that the names of such
felons and other offenders respectively which shall be contained
in such duplicates as aforesaid shall be inserted in the next
General Pardon which shall pass under the Great Seal of Great
Britain, after the receipt of such duplicate or duplicates by one
of his Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State.</blockquote>
