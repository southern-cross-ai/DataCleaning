<p>PRODUCTION NOTES:</p>
<p>This report has been prepared using OCR. There are no marginal
notes or footnotes in this book.</p>
<p>Bigge's idiosyncratic spelling, notably "Paramatta", is
retained throughout. Apart from some modernisation of the
punctuation and corrections of a few obvious typos (e.g. Sidney;
Van Dieman's land; aid-de-camp; Macquarrie), the main problems
are with inconsistent hyphenation and usage (Crown/crown;
Wolondilly/Wallondilly, 8125/8,125, &pound;/<i>l</i>., etc., all
untouched). Some widely-used hyphenations have been made
consistent (quit-rent; police-fund); many remain unchanged
(George-street/George street).</p>
<p>To give the Report context, Bigge's Instructions from Earl
Bathurst (via a despatch to Governor Macquarie) have been
included as an Addendum. In this work, Enclosure 4. is most
pertinent. The documents are taken from "Historical Records of
Australia", Series 1, Volume <i>X</i>, published by the Library
Committee Of The Commonwealth Parliament, 1917.</p>
<p>Bigge often refers to an Appendix; this is a large series of
documents which has never been printed in full. Parts only of
this Appendix may be found in "Historical Records of Australia",
Series 3, Volume III, pp. 215-922 (concerning Van Diemen's Land)
and in Series 4, Volume I, pp. 755-882.</p>
<p>At the end of the Addendum may be found linked notes.</p>

<h3><i>State of Agriculture, and Regulations for granting Lands,
in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p>   MY LORD,</p>
<p><small>IN</small> conformity to your Lordship's instructions,
I proceed to submit to you my Observations upon the state of
Agriculture in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; the
regulations by which land has been granted and settled in the
several districts; and by which also allotments have been granted
for building in the towns. The state of the trade of the two
settlements, and the restrictions to which it has been made
subject: the ecclesiastical establishments, and those instituted
for the purposes of education or charitable relief: the state and
character of the population of New South Wales; and lastly, its
revenue, and the nature of the colonial expenditure and
resources. Under the two last heads will be included the
consideration of the public works, and the mode in which they
have been conducted; as well as observations upon the colonial
hospitals, and the medical establishments.</p>
<p>The tract of land that has been for some time known and
distinguished by the county of Cumberland, is bounded on the cast
by the sea, and on the south by a line of hilly country that
stretches from the seacoast to that part of the Cow Pastures
through which the river Nepean descends from the hills of Nattai;
from thence its southern, western, and northern boundaries are
formed by the river Nepean, which when joined by the river Grose
is called the Hawkesbury, and discharges itself into the sea at
Broken Bay. The rivers Nepean and Hawkesbury thus constitute
seven-eighths of the interior boundary of the county of
Cumberland.</p>
<p>The county of Westmorland is understood to designate the
tracts of land that have been occupied and discovered to the west
of the Blue Mountains, including the settlement at Bathurst. No
boundaries have yet been affixed to it; but since my departure
from the colony, the tract of country that lies between the Shoal
Haven River and the Nepean, and extending as far inland as the
river Warragumba, has received the designation of the county of
Camden, and includes the Cow Pastures, Mount Hunter, the hills of
Nattai, from whence the river Warragumba is supposed to take its
source, and a tract called Bargo, extending as far as the river
Wingee Caribbee.</p>
<p>The county of Argyle adjoins the county of Camden on the
south-west, and is separated from it by the river Wingee
Caribbee, and on the south and west is bounded by the Shoal Haven
River, the Cookbundoon and Wolondilly Rivers.</p>
<p>The greatest extent of the county of Cumberland from north to
south may be computed to be fifty-three miles; and its greatest
breadth from the sea to the base of the Blue Mountains forty-six
miles. It has been divided into thirty-one districts, that are
now laid down and described in the map, with which I was
furnished by Mr. Oxley the surveyor general; and in which are
also described the several grants that have been made by the
different governors of the colony up to the year 1819, with
numerical references to an index, containing the names of the
grantees and the extent of each grant.</p>
<p>This division of the county of Cumberland into districts
appears to have been dictated by civil rather than geographical
reasons and has been partly determined by the population and its
gradual increase, and the necessity of providing for its control
in the appointment of magistrates and constables.</p>
<p>The county contains the principal town of Sydney, the towns of
Paramatta, Windsor, and Liverpool; and the two villages, or, as
they are denominated, the townships of Richmond and Castlereagh.
To these have lately been added the township or village of
Campbell Town, ten miles to the south of Liverpool.</p>
<p>The country that extends on the whole line of the sea-coast of
the county of Cumberland, from the Coal Cliff to Broken Bay and
for six miles into the interior, is a succession of ridges of
stratified sandstone, that is of a greater height towards the sea
and gradually declines towards interior, where it is lost under
the soil. The surface of this part of the country is covered with
a thin soil of decomposed sandstone, in the colouring of which,
as well as in the masses of the stone itself, the effect of iron
is everywhere observable.</p>
<p>The external appearance of the coast and the country around it
is of the most sterile and forbidding kind. On the southern
shores of Botany Bay and of George's River, that flows into it
near the spot that is celebrated for the first landing of Captain
Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, the natural grasses of the country
exhibit some appearance of verdure; but on the northern shore of
the same bay and river, and conformably to the appearances that
characterize all the northern shores of the rivers hitherto
discovered, the soil is destitute of fertility, but affords
support to stunted trees, Banksias, and flowering shrubs.</p>
<p>On the southern bank of the great inlet that forms the harbour
of Port Jackson, some successful attempts have been lately made
to collect and fertilize the small quantities of soil that rest
upon the unequal surface of the sandstone shores, and to convert
them into gardens; but, with this exception, the tract of country
that lies between the entrance of Botany Bay and Port Jackson is
a series of sandstone rock, loose sand, or meagre and
unprofitable swamp.</p>
<p>From the sea-coast to the base of the Blue Mountains, and
generally throughout the county of Cumberland, there is very
little elevation. The surface is gently undulated, except in the
district of Airds and in that part of Bringelly that is
contiguous to the banks of the river Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>The soil of which the interior of the county of Cumberland is
generally composed is thin and light, lying on an aluminous, red,
yellow, or blue clay, that deepens towards the interior, and upon
a substratum of aluminous slate. To this description of land is
generally given the name of Forest Land. It is more fertile as
the land rises gradually into hill: the best description of it
being found in the districts of Airds, Appin, Upper and Lower
Minto, Cooke, Bringelly, and Cabramatta.</p>
<p>The alluvial land in the county of Cumberland is distinguished
by its depth and inexhaustible fertility. It lies on both sides
of the rivers Nepean and Hawkesbury; and the largest tract is
that which is formed by a bend of the latter river between the
town of Windsor and the township of Wilberforce. Upon the banks
of the south creek, likewise, there are some small tracts of
alluvial land, partaking of the same fertility, and suffering
from the same consequences of inundation that have marked the
cultivation of the Hawkesbury districts. Nearly in the centre of
the comity is a tract of land consisting of a deep red loam,
covering the summit, sides, and base of an elevated hill that is
composed of whinstone, and that has long been distinguished for
its fertility. It is called Prospect Hill, and is situated five
miles to the west of Paramatta. In the district called the Field
of Mars, including Pennant hills to the north of Paramatta River,
there are some good tracts of new land, and also much that has
been long in cultivation, and that is now exhausted; and these,
with the alluvial lands of the Hawkesbury, form the only
exceptions to the general character that has been given of the
soil of the county of Cumberland. It should, moreover, be
observed, that the greatest portion of the land in the districts
of Meehan, Castlereagh, Oxley, Nelson, and Broken Bay, forming
the northern part of the county, are unfit for cultivation, but
afford a temporary and uncertain support to cattle; and that the
greatest part of the country that lies to the south of Georges
River, with the exception of strips of land that lie along the
edges, is of the same description. Although no limestone has yet
been worked or quarried within the limits of the county, yet it
has been lately found to be diffused over the country in strata;
some of which do not exceed two feet in thickness, and generally
consist of that stratified quality that is found in coal
countries to lie over and under sandstone. The few specimens that
had been found in the districts of the county were of a very
inferior and impure sort.</p>
<p>The great physical defect of this tract of country is its want
of water. Hardly any natural springs have been discovered between
the sea-coast and the river Nepean. The course of that river for
the last thirty miles, before it discharges itself into the sea,
lies through some rocky and barren districts that derive no
benefit from it.</p>
<p>From the slight elevation of the interior of the country, the
tides flow to a very considerable distance in all the rivers,
rendering the water brackish and unserviceable, both at the towns
of Liverpool and Paramatta, during the summer season.</p>
<p>The rivulets that are designated in Mr. Oxley's map of the
county of Cumberland, are called the South Creek, the Prospect
Creek, the Cabramatta Creek, and the East Creek. The first of
these is the most considerable; but all of them appear to be
drains and reservoirs of the water of the surrounding country,
rather than streams arising from a permanent source. In the
summer season they are nearly dry, and the water lodges in the
deep pools, forming chains of natural ponds, from which in these
seasons the cattle derive a scanty supply of water. These ponds
are also found at a distance from the regular course of the
creeks in different parts of the country, and the water is
retained in them by the impenetrable texture of the subsoil;
while at the same tine its quality and taste, as well as that of
the water of most of the wells that have been sunk in the
interior of the county of Cumberland, are much affected by the
aluminous nature of the strata in which it is obtained. The water
that is found by penetrating the stratified sandstone is
generally free from this taint.</p>
<p>The county of Camden contains the extensive tracts known by
the name of the Cow Pastures, to which five of the cattle that
were landed from Ills Majesty's ship Sirius, soon after the first
arrival of Governor Philip, had strayed from their place of
confinement. They were discovered in these tracts in the year
1795 by a convict, and appear to have been attracted to the spot,
and to have continued there, from the superior quality of the
herbage. Since that period their numbers have greatly increased;
and they have latterly occupied the hilly ranges by which the Cow
Pastures are backed on the south, and have been found in the
deeper ravines of the hills of Nattai, and on the banks of the
Bargo River. It does not appear, however, that they ever have
penetrated beyond the Blue Mountains, or the barren tract that is
called the Bargo Brush. The Cow Pastures extend northwards from
the river Bargo to the junction of the river Warragumba and the
Nepean. To the west they are bounded by some of the branches of
the latter river and the hills of Nattai. They contain by
computation about sixty thousand acres; and the soil, through
varying in fertility, but always deepening and improving on the
banks and margin of the Nepean, consists of a light sandy loam,
resting upon a substratum of clay. In this tract lime has been
discovered upon the estate of Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur; and towards the
southern and western parts, there are numerous creeks that retain
water in the dry weather, and convey it in more deepened channels
to the river Nepean.</p>
<p>Towards the south hills of Nattai the Cow Pastures are broken
into abrupt and hilly ridges, but still are found to afford good
pasturage for cattle; and for a distance of three miles from the
river Nepean, they consist of easy slopes and gentle undulations,
from the centre of which rises a lofty hill that has received the
name of Mount Hunter.</p>
<p>The county of Camden likewise comprehends a district that has
received the name of Illawarra, or the Five Islands; and that
extends in a northern and southern direction for the space of
eighteen miles along the eastern coast, commencing at a point in
which a high range of hills terminate in the sea, and recedes
gradually to the south towards Shoal Haven. The distance of this
tract from Port Jackson by the sea-coast is forty-five miles;
and, on account of the difficulty of access to it by land, the
principal communications are by sea.</p>
<p>The country that lies between Illawarra and the southern part
of the district of Airds is poor and barren; and the hill by
which the present approach is made on the land-side is steep, and
the descent difficult for cattle. The soil of the district of
Illawarra is rich and alluvial. On the freshwater flats and on
the hills it is is good clay; and in many places a rich
mould.</p>
<p>It is tolerably well supplied with streams of water; but in
summer the upper lands suffer much from heat and want of
moisture. In all parts of the Illawarra district, there is
abundance of good timber of various kinds. Mr. Oxley states that
not above ten thousand acres of land in this district remain
ungranted, including all descriptions; and that not above
one-third of it is fit for cultivation, although it is good
grazing land.</p>
<p>The greatest part of the tract that is now called the county
of Argyle, has only been known to the colony since the year
1819.</p>
<p>Attempts had been made in the year 1816 to penetrate a tract
called Bargo Brush, that lies to the east and south of the Cow
Pastures, for the purpose of discovering fresh pasturage for
cattle; and a station was fixed and taken up on the river of
Wingee Caribbee.</p>
<p>Since that period, Mr. Thoresby obtained permission to make a
settlement between the Merigong Range and the Wolondilly River;
and in the year 1820, succeeded in making a tract from his
settlement to the westward, and, crossing the range that is
called Cookbundoon, penetrated by the southern extremity of the
Blue Mountains to the banks of Campbell's River, that falls into
the Macquarie River near Bathurst Plains.</p>
<p>A road having subsequently been made passable for carriages
from Bargo to the Cookbundoon Range, and from thence to the river
of that name, Governor Macquarie, in the month of October 1820,
proceeded to the examination of that country, and also to the
lakes that had been then lately discovered in a south-westerly
direction, and distant from the range of Cookbundoon about
thirty-seven miles.</p>
<p>It was in the vicinity of these lakes that I met Governor
Macquarie upon my return from Bathurst, after traversing the
country that had been tracked by Mr. Thoresby. In this expedition
I was accompanied by Mr. Oxley the surveyor general, who made a
very accurate description of the country and distances, from the
time that we left Campbell's River, on the 18th of October, until
we joined Governor Macquarie at Bathurst Lake on the 26th. The
road by which tile governor proceeded from the Cow Pastures to
lake Bathurst and lake George traverses the district that has
been since named the county of Camden and the county of Argyle:
that part of the former that is called the Cow Pastures has
already been described. On leaving the Stone Quarry Creek, which
is the southern boundary, the road passes through a tract of
indifferent land, which improves a little on the banks of the
Bargo River, that descends from the hills of Nattai, and passing
through a rocky but even channel of sandstone, joins the Stone
Quarry Creek before its accession to the waters of the Nepean. At
a little distance from the river Bargo there are some small
patches of tolerable land, in which the traces of the wild hordes
were very visible; but front thence to the base of a high range
that is called Merigong the land is very sterile, and covered
either with stunted and withered shrubs, or with very lofty and
straight trees of the species of Eucalyptus, called the Stringy
Bark. In approaching the Merigong Range, there is a tract of flat
land called the Kenembegails Plains, parts of which are lit for
cultivation; and both sides of the Lange itself are covered with
thick strata of fertile and tenacious clay. From this range to
the river of Wingee Caribbee the soil is considerably varied. On
the ranges of Merigong, and in the lower lands that adjoin the
river, the clay predominates; and in the winter season the
moisture that it retains has been found very prejudicial to sheep
and cattle. Further to the south, and near the settlement made by
Mr. Thoresby, the soil in the hills consists of a light but
fertile mould, lying on whinstone. In the vallies it is more
compact, and is a deep and rich clay. The surface is broken into
long ranges of hills, divided by line sloping lies; in most of
which there are chains of natural ponds, and free from the
mineral impregnations of the county of Cumberland.</p>
<p>This county has greater elevation than that district; and the
climate, and consequently the state of vegetation, are very
different.</p>
<p>The only parts of the county of Argyle that were known or had
been examined previous to my departure from the colony, were
found to contain a tract of land, the soil of which is of
peculiar fertility and richness. It is a deep red loam, bearing a
thick and vigorous vegetation of the natural grasses of the
country, and abundance of the shrubs called the Daviesia, and the
wild indigo. In most parts of this tract also the trees are of
very large dimensions; there are also open spaces of forest, in
which the same rich soil is found, and although it is in many
places wet and swampy it is very susceptible of cultivation. This
tract, to which the name of Sutton Forest has been given, is
computed to contain about 15,000 acres of fertile land.</p>
<p>The remainder of the country through which the road passes to
the Cookbundoon Range, consists of broken hills towards the
south; and in the space between the Cookbundoon and Wallondilly
Rivers, after traversing an extensive tract of poor and barren
soil, covered with withered shrubs, the country improves, the
hills are less abrupt, and the soil is a light sand, bearing
little grass, but dry and well adapted for the pasturage of
sheep. The surface is gently undulating; and the trees, that are
not of large growth, are sufficiently dispersed for shelter and
ornament to the land, without being an incumbrance to it. This
tract, that is computed to contain 15,000 acres, has received the
name of Eden Forest.</p>
<p>The heights of the Cookbundoon Range, over which the road
passes, will present but little difficulty, even to carriages,
when a better direction shall have been given to it. The country
to the southward of the range is bad and swampy, but improves
greatly on the descent to the Wolondilly River; on the margin of
which there is some good timber. The soil is a light and poor
sand, and is covered with a long and coarse grass. From the
breadth of the channel of this river, there must be a great
accumulation of water in it during the winter season, but there
were no marks of the effects of a violent current; and the ponds
into which it was broken were still and deep, and considerably
broader than those found in the courses of the other rivers.</p>
<p>A large tract of open country that received the name of
Goulburn Plains, extends for a distance of ten miles to the
south-west. It is on an average five miles wide, and has been
estimated to contain about 35,000 acres of land. A little to the
southwest is another open tract of flat land, that has been
called Breadalbane Plains.</p>
<p>These plains are not encumbered with wood. The surface is
gently undulating, and the soil light, sandy and poor. The
bottoms are swampy, and appear to retain great quantities of
water in the winter season. The hills are low and stony, and have
not that admixture of good soil that was remarked in the higher
lands of the county of Argyle. I observed also that the grass on
Goulburn Plains was coarse and tufted.</p>
<p>The country between this tract and Bathurst Lake is much of
the same character, but more hilly and woody, and the swamps more
extensive.</p>
<p>The circumference of Bathurst Lake is about twelve miles; and
Mr. Meehan the deputy surveyor general, who had visited it for
the first time in the year 1818, was of opinion that it had much
increased in size in the interval. Several trees and shrubs on
the margin of the lake appeared to have been very lately
surrounded with water, the colour of which was strongly tinged by
the red-ochreous clay of the shores.</p>
<p>The land on the eastern side of the lake is of a better
quality, and produces good grass on the slopes and gentle
eminences. The bottoms are deep and swampy, and appear to be
extensive drains from the high ranges of hills that bound the
horizon on the east. On the north-west side a stratum of lime was
discovered at the termination of some rocky and uneven hills,
that form the southern and western shores. At a distance of two
miles from Bathurst Lake, and in a south-west direction to lake
George, the surface of the country is for the most part barren
and uneven, covered with stunted trees and rocks of various
kinds, consisting of granite, quartz and slate. The ranges of
these hills are separated by broad and flat swampy meadows, in
the centre of which are found ponds of water.</p>
<p>On approaching the north-east shore of lake George, the swampy
meadows are of greater extent, and reach to the margin of the
lake, where they are separated by rocky projections of sandstone.
The extent of the lake from north to south is nearly eighteen
miles, and its main breadth is from five to seven miles. Dead
trees were observed in it to a considerable distance from its
present shores; and the person who had discovered it in the month
of August preceding, seemed impressed with a belief that the
expanse of water had considerably increased.</p>
<p>The water itself had been represented to be salt, but it was
found on experiment to be remarkably soft, though turbid. There
was no indication of any stream or current in the lake; and
although Mr. Thoresby, who preceded Governor Macquarie, had some
reason to believe from the accounts of the natives that an outlet
would be discovered on the south-eastern extremity, and that it
would in all probability take the same course and discharge
itself into the sea; yet, upon further examination, no such issue
was found there, nor as far as the eye could reach did any such
exist on the south or western shores. The lake is bounded on the
west by a table chain of rocky hills, elevated from 800 to 1,500
feet above its level; and it was from one of these that Mr. Oxley
thought he descried a mountainous chain to the west and
north-west of Bateman's Bay, on the eastern coast of New South
Wales, and distant about forty miles.</p>
<p>The whole extent of the country lying to the south-east and
west of lake George, as viewed from an eminence, appeared to be
rocky, broken and mountainous, and not affording any expectation
that its surface would prove more valuable or attractive.</p>
<p>The south-western extremity of lake George was the farthest
point in that direction that had at that time been examined.</p>
<p>It was Governor Macquarie's intention to employ some person in
the further examination of it, principally with a view to
discover whether there existed any river that flowed from the
interior and discharged itself into the sea on the eastern coast.
I have not yet received any information to that effect; although
I have understood that, upon an examination of that cart of the
coast by Lieutenant Johnstone of the Royal Navy, a river has been
discovered by him, the sources of which will in all probability
be traced to the mountainous ranges that were seen from lake
George.</p>
<p>In a previous communication, I had the honour of submitting to
your Lordship the reasons that determined me to examine the
country to the southward and westward of the Blue Mountains,
rather than the tracts that lie between Bathurst and the river
Hastings.</p>
<p>With a view to examine the communication that had been
discovered by Mr. Thoresby between the Cow Pastures and Bathurst,
and to verify the description that had been given of the lakes
and the country around them by the person who first discovered
them, I yielded to the proposal made to me by Governor Macquarie
to meet him at that point, and left Bathurst with that view on
the 17th October. The journal of Mr. Oxley contains a very
accurate description of the character and elevation of the
country through which we passed, including a distance from
Campbell's River to the banks of the Cookbundoon River of
eighty-two miles.</p>
<p>I do not conceive it necessary to trouble your Lordship with a
detailed description of the country, but I will content myself
with observing, that after leaving the neighbourhood of
Campbell's River, and a tract of land occupied by Lieutenant
Lawson, we passed over a series of long and protracted ridges for
the space nearly of twenty miles, separated from each other by
swampy and sometimes by fertile valleys, that in winter must be
very deep. In the remainder of the distance we found the country
more broken; and we passed two fine and clear streams whose
course was to the southward and westward, and which, according to
a conjecture of Mr. Oxley, formed a junction and afterwards
became branches of the river Lachlan. These rivers were named
Colborne and Abercrombie, and were found to be much of the same
character as those that descend from the Blue Mountains into
Bathurst Plains. After leaving the ridges and passing these
rivers the character of the country varied, and we, passed
through long tracts of hilly and barren ranges, thickly covered
with bad and stunted trees and low shrubs. There were no great
eminences, nor could any distant view be obtained of the country
on either side of our course. We occasionally fell in with that
which had been taken by Mr. Thoresby; but neither Mr. Oxley nor
myself found reason to concur in the description of the country
that this gentleman transmitted to Governor Macquarie, nor in the
facility that he considers it to afford for the passage of
cattle. In many parts of our journey we were obliged to pass
several long and deep swamps; and there were two rocky and abrupt
descents, which in their present state would be impassable to
cattle.</p>
<p>The country around Bathurst, in an agricultural point of view,
has proved to be of considerable value to the colony.</p>
<p>After passing the rallies, watered by Cox's River and the Fish
River, and a range of dry and sterile hills, called Clarence's
Hilly Range, the road from the Blue Mountains leads through
Sidmouth Vallies, that are well watered, and covered with good
herbage, growing in tufts upon a soil of loose disintegrated
granite. The surface of the country slopes gently to the west;
and from an eminence that is a little beyond the Sidmouth
Vallies, a very fine and extensive view is obtained of the open
country, in the centre of which are the Bathurst Plains, and
various broad and rich vallies, stretching to the north and south
of the plain that is watered by the Macquarie River. Before it
reaches Bathurst, this stream is joined by the Campbell River, on
the banks of which there is some rich grazing land, opening into
extensive plains, called Mitchell's and O'Connell Plains. The
elevation of the country on the western side of the Blue
Mountains is strongly marked by the rapidity and fullness of the
streams of water; they abound in every direction, and generally
terminate in the river Macquarie, which, even at Bathurst, is
deep, clear and full. The soil on the points and bends of the
river is, generally, alluvial. The hills, which, on the northern
side, are gently elevated above the level of the river, are
perfectly clear of timber, and are covered with a dry gravelly
loam, intermixed with a coarse granite sand. This soil is not
naturally fertile, but it is dry, and favourable to sheep. The
extent of land denominated Bathurst Plains, and that is clear of
timber, comprises nearly 40,000 acres. The hills on the south
side of the river Macquarie are more elevated, broken and stony,
but covered with good grass and with fertile soil towards the
summits. The rallies that are distinguished by the names of Queen
Charlotte and Princess Charlotte, are remarkable for their
beautiful verdure and expanse.</p>
<p>The wood in the neighbourhood of Bathurst is small, and very
inferior to that which is found on the eastern side of the Blue
Mountains.</p>
<p>I had no opportunities of personally examining the country
beyond Bathurst; but I was informed, both by Mr. Oxley and by
persons who had visited it since his expedition into the
interior, that both to the north and south-west, and in the
direction of the rivers Lachlan and Macquarie, for a distance of
eighty miles, with an interruption of occasional tracts of barren
land and swamps, the country is open, and affords good pasturage;
and that at Wellington Valley there are several fine tracts of
land on the banks of the Macquarie River fit for cultivation, and
well watered by the streams that fall into it.</p>
<p>Limestone in a very pure state has lately been discovered near
Bathurst, and was observed by Mr. Oxley between that place and
Wellington Valley, in his expeditions into the interior.</p>
<p>The nature of the country that lies between Bathurst and the
Hastings had not been examined previous to my departure from the
colony; but the chief constable of Windsor, Mr. Howe, had been
employed to explore the country from the lower branch of the
river Hawkesbury, in a northern direction, to Hunter's River, or
the Coal River. This tract of country had also been examined at a
more recent period by a son of Lieutenant Bell, and was found to
contain a long and stony ridge, covered with stunted shrubs, and
occasional small tracts of good pasturage. At. a place that is
called by the natives Boottee, several rallies were found
inclosed by rocky hills, passable for cattle. Proceeding further
to the north, there was an alternation nearly of the same kind,
but an improvement in the soil, which continued as far as
Comorri, upon the banks of a branch of Hunter's River, where it
was the intention of Mr. Bell to make a temporary establishment
for his cattle. He states that the distance was computed by his
son to be seventy miles from Windsor, and that the only two steep
ascents might easily be made practicable for carts.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to mention to your Lordship the
fertile tracts named Wallis's Plains, on the upper parts of
Hunter's River, and the probability of their becoming valuable
additions to the agricultural portions of the colony. The country
to the north of that river, extending to the River Hastings, and
to the tract by which Mr. Oxley returned from his last expedition
into the interior, has never been examined; and if my attention
had not been particularly directed to the country south of
Bathurst, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the new
communication that was announced between the Cow Pastures and
Bathurst, without the necessity of passing the Blue Mountains, I
should have availed myself of the opportunity afforded by my
visit to Bathurst to have traversed the country as far as the
Hastings, and to have renewed the attempt that I ineffectually
made soon after my arrival In the colony, to examine the country
on the banks and the mouth of that river. The description that
Mr. Oxley has given of the former tracts has been verified by the
subsequent information of individuals who have ascended the river
to short distances from Port Macquarie; and the account that he
gave of that harbour and its vicinity has been confirmed by an
inspection that was made of it by Governor Macquarie at the end
of last year.</p>
<p>As your Lordship has for some time been in possession of the
details, as well as the results of Mr. Oxley's expeditions, that
were prepared by your order, for the purpose of exploring the
interior of New Holland, and tracing the courses of the rivers
Lachlan and Macquarie, and as no subsequent information has been
yet received of the result of the late surveys of Captain King on
the western coast, I have no data upon which I could be justified
in offering any further conjecture than that which has resulted
from the arduous and hazardous enterprize of Mr. Oxley; and I
will confine myself to observing, that the character and features
of the country that has been examined since Mr. Oxley's last
expedition, tend to confirm the extraordinary fact which his two
expeditions established, of two or more tributary streams taking
their source in the highest ridges of the Blue Mountains, within
fifty miles from the sea-coast, and of their being lost at a
distance of 300 miles in an opposite direction, by diffusion over
an immense portion of the surface of the interior. A future and
more accurate examination of lakes George and Bathurst, and of
the existence of any outlet to their waters, together with a
further examination of the eastern coast towards Bass's Straits,
will establish the continuance of that long dividing range of
elevated mountains by which the current of the waters seems to be
determined to the county of Cumberland and the sea on the east,
and to the interior of New Holland on the west.</p>
<p>To the scientific precision and to the accuracy of observation
of Mr. Oxley, as well as to his patience and endurance of
privation and fatigue, the colony of New South Wales is already
much indebted; and it is only just to add, that by the more
humble, but not less useful discoveries of Mr. Thoresby, valuable
and unexpected information has been obtained of the country most
contiguous to the settled districts; but which from want of
curiosity, or want of exertion, had remained altogether
unexamined and unknown.</p>
<p>On reference to the district map, furnished by Mr. Oxley, and
to his evidence, it appears that, in the month of November 1819,
the portion of land fit for cultivation, and remaining ungranted
in the county of Cumberland was so small, that it was considered
probable that Governor Macquarie would be under the necessity of
having recourse to the Cow-Pastures, for the purpose of placing
any new settlers of respectability and capital that might arrive
from England.</p>
<p>The total amount of land held in New South Wales appears, by
the muster of 1820, to be upwards of 389,000 acres; and of these
54,898 acres are returned as cleared. This amount did not include
any portion of the new districts beyond the line of the Bargo
River to the south, or Hunter's River to the north. Of the
quantity of land so held and returned as cleared in these
districts, 16,706 acres were in wheat, 11,270 in maize, 1,230 in
barley, 379 in rye and oats, 213 in pease and beans, 504 in
potatoes, and 1,094 acres in orchard and garden ground.</p>
<p>From a document exhibiting the results of the musters of land
and stock from the years 1810 to 1820 inclusive, it appears that
in the former year the proportion of land cleared to the land
held, vas as one and a half to four; and that in the latter year
it was as one and one-tenth to seven. The districts of Windsor,
Richmond and Wilberforce, returned 16,856 acres of cleared ground
in the year 1820, 10,000 of which were either in wheat or maize.
Next after these, the districts of Evan, and those of Airds and
Appin produce the greatest quantity of wheat and maize; and it is
remarked, that the wheat of Appin, and Airds, and Bringelly, and
generally of the good hill land, is superior both in weight and
quality to the wheat produced in the flat lands of the
Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>In the districts that are nearer to Sydney, and in the
neighbourhood of Paramatta, the land is not so fertile; and the
portion that has been cleared has been much exhausted.
Considerable expense is requisite to renew its productive powers;
and the lands that have been abandoned in these districts, as
well as others towards the sea-coast, are infested with a plant
that has received in the colony the name of the Silk Cotton, and
that was imported some time ago, under a belief that the pods
that it bears and the silky down they contain, would prove
valuable in manufacture. This plant is a species of asclepias,
and is supported by tender and weak stalks, abounding with a
milky juice that is strongly astringent; the bark, when
disengaged of vegetable matter, contains long filaments
resembling hemp. No attempt has yet been made to apply them to
purposes of manufacture; but I was informed by Mr. Lord, that the
down produced in the pods would be of some use in the manufacture
of hats. The seed to which the down adheres is dispersed and
carried by the wind, and there are few of the settled districts
of the colony in which it is not found; but it abounds on the
tops of the dry hills and in open spaces.</p>
<p>The tracts of land on the Hawkesbury and near the town of
Windsor, were originally settled by Lieutenant Governor Grose,
who granted small portions of them, not exceeding thirty acres,
to persons who had been convicts, or whose sentences had been
remitted. The same system was continued by Governor Hunter and
Governor King, who enlarged the quantity of land to the settlers;
and also annexed very considerable tracts above the level of the
river, to serve as commons for the depasturage of cattle
belonging to the occupiers of the smaller tracts in the lower
lands, thus securing, a more free and extensive range for their
cattle, and a temporary retreat from inundation.</p>
<p>Some of the original grantees of these small tenements still
continue upon them: the proportion however is not large, and
while some have extended their possessions by purchase and have
considerable stock, the occupiers of the smaller tenements
appeared to me to be in a very abject state of poverty. Much
exertion and persuasion have been used at different periods by
Governor Macquarie, after the inundations of the river
Hawkesbury, to induce them to repair to the townships and high
lands upon the opposite bank of the river, where the land is out
of the reach of its waters, but either from inability to
construct new habitations, or from unwillingness to leave their
old ones, the lower class of settlers have in very few instances,
taken advantage of these offers. In the districts of Wilberforce
and Richmond, I observed that resort had been made to the higher
lands, and houses had been erected upon them, in which the
proprietors of the lower lands resided.</p>
<p>The most considerable inundations of the river took place in
the month of March 1806, in the same period of the years 1808 and
1811, in the month of June 1816, in March 1817, in the month of
February 1819, and in the month of October 1820.</p>
<p>The progress of these inundations is generally rapid until the
river overflows and its waters are diffused; and it has been
observed, that the rapidity of their rise is greater when the
direction of the wind and rain is from the south-west, than when
it is from the north-west.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of a good ferry-boat at Windsor, the
means of retreat have generally been open to the inhabitants of
the flat lands, before the water has diffused itself over
them.</p>
<p>In several places near the channel of the Hawkesbury, breaches
are made by the force of the current, and the water rushes with
impetuosity into the lower grounds, leaving large pools that are
more destructive to cultivation than the passing current.</p>
<p>The inundations of the Hawkesbury have been most frequent in
the month of March, but they have also occurred at other periods
after a continuance of rain. They appear to be attributable to
the great elevation of the sources of the rivers, whose streams
are added to those of the Hawkesbury and Nepean, as well as to
the impulse that they receive in the narrow and rocky channels
through which they descend; and after rapidly filling the bed of
the river Hawkesbury, discharge themselves over the flat lands in
the neighbourhood of Windsor, Richmond and Wilberforce. They
bring with them and leave a rich alluvial deposit, and great
abundance of weeds and vegetable matter, which create the
necessity of additional labour in cleaning the lands, that in the
month of March are generally prepared for the reception of wheat,
or are covered with maize in its ripened state. The losses
therefore that are sustained by the inundations, both in labour
and in grain, are very considerable. At the early periods of the
colony, great dependance was always placed upon the produce of
the Hawkesbury districts; at present, although the fertility of
the land is not exhausted, yet the admixture of weeds and wild
vetches, the foul state of the land, and the continued
cultivation of it for a long series of years in the mine grain,
has greatly deteriorated the quality of both. In maize, however,
these lands continue to be still very productive, as well as in
the more common kinds of vegetables.</p>
<p>The farms, or rather allotments, in these districts are small;
the houses generally ill-built, and exhibiting the traces of
former inundations. The fields are without fences; but the
vigorous and thriving condition of the horses and cattle, even in
the confined state in which they are necessarily kept, bears
testimony to the richness of the vegetation and pasturage.</p>
<p>The average produce of lands in the Hawkesbury district, from
the year 1804 to 1814, is stated to have been from twenty-one to
twenty-five bushels per acre; and since the latter period from
fifteen to twenty. The rent of land in these districts does not
exceed 20<i>s</i>. an acre if paid in money, and 30<i>s</i>. if
paid in grain, and leases of it are given for terms not exceeding
five years.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the farms on the banks of the South Creek,
partakes much of the same character as that of the low lands on
the Hawkesbury. The quantity of good soil is, however,
considerably less; and being confined to the immediate banks and
edges of the creek, the destruction arising from inundations is
sensibly felt.</p>
<p>The land on the rising ground is of very inferior quality, and
produces very bad crops. The districts of Airds and Appin, those
of Richmond and Bringelly, and upon the banks of the river
Nepean, produce the grain of the best quality; but on these
districts the average produce of the land of the first quality is
not estimated to exceed the rate of twenty bushels per acre, and
that of the second quality is rated at one-fourth less. Under a
good system of cultivation, it is the opinion of Mr. Oxley that
the hilly land of the county of Cumberland, or what he terms good
forest land, would produce about twenty bushels per acre, and
alluvial lands from twenty-five to thirty-five bushels; but he
thinks that the average produce of the colony in wheat does not
exceed ten bushels per acre, and he estimates the produce of
maize, from the same sort of lands, to be from thirty to sixty
bushels per acre.</p>
<p>The lands that have been cultivated at Bathurst, either on
account of government, or by the few settlers that have been
established there, lie in the plain that is traversed by the
Macquarie River. It is fertile, and is not subject to inundation;
but the grain produced at Bathurst has been greatly affected by
smut.</p>
<p>The system of cultivation pursued in New South Wales is of a
very simple kind: The first operation consists of felling the
timber, with which most parts of the county of Cumberland
abounds, and burning it off. The trees are cut at the height of
two feet from the root, and after they are piled into heaps and
burnt; the land is once ploughed or hoed: it is then sown with
maize, and where the means of the cultivator admit, the maize
should be hilled and cleaned twice. The cultivation of new land
in maize is considered to be the best preparation for a crop of
wheat. It is sown generally in the months of October and
November; but I observed that, in the alluvial land, and wherever
the fertility of the soil admitted, preparation for sowing maize
immediately followed the removal of the wheat or other grain that
had preceded it. Thus, if a crop of wheat was sown in the months
of March or April, (the usual period of sowing) and reaped in
November, it may be immediately succeeded by a crop of maize,
that would be ripe and fit for pulling in the month of April
following, forming a period of thirteen or fourteen months for
the production and maturity of two different crops of grain on
the same land.</p>
<p>Although the crop of maize affords the best means of preparing
new land for the reception of other grain, by gradual exposure of
the soil to the action of the sun, yet it is an exhausting crop.
When the land is prepared for wheat, it is sown generally in the
months of March and April; but the seed-time is frequently as
late as July, when the rains have been very heavy in the month of
March. The species of wheat that has been found most advantageous
in the colony is the creeping wheat, as it suffers less from the
effect of the sun on the clay soils, and affords winter food and
pasturage to sheep.</p>
<p>The cultivation of barley and oats has been very partially
practised in New South Wales. A species of the former, called the
Cape or Skinless Barley, is found to be most suitable to the
climate. Hitherto this grain has been little in demand; and it is
the opinion of a person, who was for some time engaged in
brewing, that malt made from the barley of New South Wales
contains from forty to fifty per cent. less of saccharine matter
than that which is made from English barley. It is also stated,
that it ripens irregularly and too rapidly. In its green state it
affords good winter food for sheep and cattle; and it has been
observed already, that at Grose Farm, near Sydney, almost the
whole of the produce of the oats and barley crops were devoted to
that object. The want of demand for barley, rye and oats, has
been alleged, by the inhabitants of New South Wales, as the
principal reason for not pursuing the cultivation of those
grains, and for confining it to the growth of wheat and
maize.</p>
<p>Under the system of management and culture that has been
pursued in the colony till within the last three years, I do not
think that the variation in the crops of grain would have been
attended with any benefit. The want of manure would alone have
impeded such a course of husbandry; and it is to the same cause
that is to be attributed the exhausted state of the soil of the
cultivated districts that does not consist of alluvial land.
Under this impression, the attention of the higher classes of the
settlers has been lately directed to the production of manure,
and of artificial food for cattle. White clover has for some time
been scattered in different parts of the colony; but, either from
insensibility to or ignorance of its value, it has been in very
few instances cultivated. A striking proof of its easy
assimilation to the climate of New South Wales was exhibited in a
small inclosure in front of the Carter's Barrack, at Sydney,
consisting of some very inferior land that had formerly been a
stock yard. It is much affected by the summer heats and long
continued drought, but quickly recovers on the return of
moisture. On the banks and flat lands of the river Hawkesbury and
Nepean, the horses and cattle are fed upon the wild vetches that
have mixed with the wheat; but it is only within the last two
years, and upon a very few estates of the more opulent settlers,
that any attempts have been made to introduce the cultivation of
the artificial grasses. Lucerne, saintfoin and burnet are found
to succeed in the alluvial lands; and rye grass and meadow fescue
are considered as the best species for resisting the heat of
summer, even on the clay land. The seed of these grasses, when
assimilated to the climate, thrives much better than imported
seed; and it is observed that the latter preserve the European
seasons in flowering, and does not assimilate itself to the
climate of New South Wales until after the second crop. Turnips
have been cultivated on some estates, but from the uncertainty of
the seasons it is a crop that is little to be depended upon. The
best period for sowing them is considered to be the month of
March.</p>
<p>The estates that are in the best state of cultivation, and
exhibit the greatest improvement, are those of Mr. Oxley the
surveyor general, Mr. Cox, Sir John Jamison, Mr. Hannibal
M&lsquo;Arthur, Mr. Redfern, Mr. John M&lsquo;Arthur, Mr.
Thoresby and Mr. Howe.</p>
<p>Having observed the increasing necessity of providing food for
their flocks and cattle from other sources than the natural
grasses of the colony, these gentlemen have turned their
attention to the culture of the various qualities of artificial
grasses; and, from the experiments they have already made, there
is every reason to expect that the supply of food for sheep and
cattle may be greatly augmented. The natural grams of the country
have within the last three years suffered much by the continued
and increased depasturage of cattle, and the ravages of a
caterpillar that appeared in the early part of the year 1819. The
marks of its devastation were still apparent at the end of that
years and although the vegetation seemed quickly to recover, when
not exposed to the bite of sheep or cattle, yet the want of food
for both was much felt in the autumn and winter of 1820.</p>
<p>The natural grasses of New South Wales are considered to be
annuals; they have not the verdure or succulence of the English
grasses, but they resist the heat of summer, and derive a partial
protection from the intense heat of the sun in the lofty and
welding branches of the eucalyptus. The districts of the Cow
Pastures and, Illawarra afford the best pasturage for sheep and
cattle on the south side of the I Nepean; and on the north side,
the districts of Bringelly, Cooke, Upper and Lower Minto, contain
several tracts where the vegetation of the natural grasses is yet
vigorous and healthy.</p>
<p>The more opulent settlers have begun to fence their estates
with strong railing made of the stringy and iron bark trees; and
it is stated by a considerable stock owner, that he is enabled to
keep one-third more of cattle in the same number of acres
inclosed, than he could when it was in its open state.</p>
<p>From the access that was afforded by the road over the Blue
Mountains to the country around Bathurst, the stock owners
derived considerable advantage from the pasturage of those tracts
in the year 1816, after two seasons of continued drought. Since
that period, permission has been given to all persons that
applied for leave, to drive their sheep and cattle to Bathurst
for the purpose of temporary occupation and pasturage. A large
tract of land on the south side of the river has been retained
for the use of the government herds; and, with the exception of
one valley in which Mr. Fitzgerald has been allowed to fix a
cattle station, the herds and flocks of the settlers are on the
north side, and as far as the line of the Campbell River.</p>
<p>Mr. Cox occupies a considerable tract of land immediately
opposite the station at which the government buildings have been
placed. No grant had been executed of this land, but I understood
from Mr. Oxley that it was intended to be conferred on Mr. Cox.
This gentleman has here erected farm buildings, and made
inclosures, in which he is making experiments with the artificial
grasses. It is here also that he has very considerable flocks of
sheep, amounting to 5,000, and herds of cattle, which, from the
late accession of other occupants, have been obliged to resort to
new and more distant tracts. Twenty-four flocks, of which ten
belonged to Mr. Cox, were distributed over the Bathurst Plains
and adjoining values in the month of November 1819, and the whole
number of sheep then amounted to nearly 11,000.</p>
<p>The remaining proprietors had availed themselves of the
temporary permissions given by Governor Macquarie, and had placed
their sheep and cattle under the care of their convict servants,
who were lodged in huts built of turf and wood, in the central
part of the tract upon which the sheep and cattle grazed.</p>
<p>Two of these occupiers, Mr. Hassal and Mr. Lowe, had been at
more expense, and had made inclosures, in which they raised
sufficient grain for the supply of their herdsmen; and the former
had erected houses for the shearing and collection of his
wool.</p>
<p>The sheep at Bathurst are not found to require covering during
the winter season, although the cold is considerably greater than
on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains; and ice of the
thickness of an inch and a half is not uncommon, and had been
observed in the month of May 1820. During these periods the
vegetation is affected, and the sheep are driven into the
neighbouring woods, where they derive protection and shelter, as
well as food, from the shrubs with which they abound; of these
the most common and the most nutritive is the davyesia. In the
summer the abundance and variety of wild herbs that are found
amongst the natural grasses of the Bathurst Plains, together with
the dryness of the soil and atmosphere, render these tracts
particularly favourable to sheep; while the thicker vegetation of
grass upon the lower lands, and the ready access to the pure
water of the river, afford excellent pasturage for cattle.</p>
<p>In consequence of the increase in the number of sheep and
cattle in the county of Cumberland, and of the objection made by
the settlers to transfer their stock to the western side of the
Blue Mountains for the purpose of temporary pasturage, the growth
and reproduction of the natural grasses in the former district
has been much checked.</p>
<p>Your Lordship is aware, that with the exception of the lands
held by Messrs. M&lsquo;Arthur and Davidson on the southern side
of the Nepean, the remaining part of the tract of valuable land
called the Cow Pastures, has been appropriated to the use of the
government herds and of the wild cattle. The former consists of a
mixed race of the Bengal and European breeds, and have lately
received some improvement by admixture with the stock of Mr.
M&lsquo;Arthur and Mr. Palmer. The wild herds, consisting of the
stock that was first imported into the colony from the Cape of
Good Hope, have preserved, but in a fainter degree, the character
and peculiarities of the breed of that country; they betray also
marks of degeneracy in the lightness of their carcase and the
elongation of their limbs. When tamed they have been found useful
in draught; but it is considered that, for such purposes, oxen of
the mixed European and Bengal and Cape breeds, are better
calculated; and it is also found that they fatten more easily
than cattle of the pure European stock. At the age of two years
old the cattle of this mixed breed are found to weigh 400 pounds,
but the wild cattle, even of a maturer age, are rarely found to
exceed 600 pounds.</p>
<p>On a reference to the abstracts made from the general musters
of stock and land in cultivation, from the year 1810 to the year
1820, the number of horned cattle in New South Wales will be
found to have been quintupled during that period. In consequence
of the great droughts that occurred in the years 1814 and 1815,
and the difficulty of finding pasturage, there appears to have
been a decrease; but since those periods the numbers have again
increased, and the amount of horned cattle in 1820 appears, by
the return, to be 54,103.</p>
<p>Having observed during the course of a tour that I made into
the grazing districts in the ninth of July of the year 1820, that
the cattle were generally very young, and in a very impoverished
state in consequence of the destruction of the grass by
caterpillars in the preceding year, and that there was a
reluctance among the inhabitants to supply the commissariat
stores with meat, I obtained returns from the different stations
of the quantities and ages of the cattle that had been
slaughtered there during the preceding twelve months. From these
I found, that out of 3,668 head of horned cattle that had been
slaughtered, 1,165 were females, many of which were heifers; and,
with the exception of those slaughtered for the use of the
establishment at Emu Island, were not more than three or four
years old. As the increase of cattle in New South Wales in the
preceding year had only amounted to 2,530 head, there appeared to
me to be sufficient reason to adopt every precaution that might
have a tendency to economize the consumption of meat. I therefore
addressed a letter to Governor Macquarie upon this subject,
proposing a scale of alteration in the items of the ration to the
convicts in the employ of government, as well as to the
constables and overseers.</p>
<p>The increase in the numbers of the horned cattle, apparent in
the returns of the year 1820, is stated to have amounted to
11,479 head: a larger increase than had taken place in any
preceding year from 1810. I shall subsequently state my reasons
to your Lordship for doubting the accuracy of these returns; but
although this apparent increase in the stock of the colony tended
to remove my fears for the immediate effect of an increasing
consumption upon that portion that was reserved specially for the
purposes of breeding, yet the expediency of allowing time for the
winter maturity of the other portions did not appear to me to be
less at my departure from the colony than it was when I first
addressed my letter to Governor Macquarie; while the rate of
consumption of meat, arising from the successive importation of
fresh convicts, confirmed me in the view that I had at first
taken of the subject, and the remedy that I then recommended.</p>
<p>The increase and diffusion of stock in the colony of New South
Wales, has been much assisted by the practice adopted in the
later periods, of distributing the cattle from the government
herds to individuals on receiving grants of land. This practice
has been observed both towards free settlers arriving from
England with recommendations from your Lordship, as well as to
convicts who received grants upon the remission or expiration of
their sentences. Donations of cattle likewise have been made from
the same sources by the governors, as well as in remuneration for
services or meritorious undertakings. In case of distribution to
the settlers, the cattle were issued at the price of 28<i>l</i>.
per head, payable in three years, or returnable in kind at that
period, and in good condition. As the first of these conditions
did not continue to bear any proportion to the progressive
reduction that has taken place in the price of cattle in the
colony, a general preference was given to the last; but it has
not always happened that there was a general compliance with it.
Cases have occurred in which this liberality of government has
been much abused, in the selection that was made in the first
instance, in the delay of repayment, and in the condition and age
of the cattle that were returned. The government herds therefore
hare suffered much in their quality and breed by these exchanges,
and they have equally suffered by the heavy demands that have
been made upon them for the government works, to which it appears
they have been sent of late with little consideration of age or
capacity for labour.</p>
<p>The names of the principal proprietors of sheep and cattle in
the colony are contained in an extract that was made from the
returns of the muster of the year 1820. They consist chiefly of
persons who have come free to the colony; and the herds in which
the greatest improvement has been made, are those of Mr. Palmer,
jun., Mr. Thoresby, Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur, Mr. Wentworth, Sir John
Jamison, Mr. Cox, and the Reverend Mr. Marsden. The stock
belonging to these gentlemen has been more or less derived from
the best English breeds, with a slight and partial admixture of
the Cape and Bengal; and in that of Mr. Marsden, the Suffolk
breed has altogether predominated.</p>
<p>The climate as well as the natural pasturage of New South
Wales are highly favourable to the production, growth and
improvement of horned cattle; and the great increase that has
lately been made in the various products of the dairy, even at a
moment when the natural pasturage in the settled districts had
been deteriorated, and access to the new had just been opened,
proves the value of this branch of rural industry in a
temperature that cannot be considered as generally favourable to
its development.</p>
<p>The increase that has taken place in the number of sheep
during the last ten years has not equalled that of the horned
cattle, the numbers having only been tripled during that period.
At the muster that was taken in the month of September 1820, they
amounted to 99,487. The breed that is general in the colony may
be considered to be an admixture of that of the Cape of Good Hope
and the improved English; and hitherto there have been few
individuals who have turned their attention to the improvement of
their flocks by the introduction of the Merino race. The
perseverance and success of Mr. John M&lsquo;Arthur in the
improvement of his flocks has been adverted to in my former
Report. It appears that his attention to this subject was first
attracted in the year 1794, by observing the improvement that had
taken place in the fleeces of some of the lambs produced from a
cross of sheep of the Bengal breed with some that he accidentally
obtained from Ireland. These fleeces exhibited a mixture of hair
and wool that afforded the first expectation of future
improvement. In the year 1796, Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur was enabled to
obtain by purchase from the Cape of Good Hope, four ewes and two
rams of the pure Merino breed by which his flock was much
improved; and in the year 1801, after submitting specimens of the
pure Merino wool to the inspection of several eminent
manufacturers in England, who considered them to be equal to any
Spanish wool, and that of the mixed to be of considerable value,
Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur purchased nine rams and one ewe from the royal
flock at Kew, from which sources his present flock of sheep
amounting to 6,800, of which 300 are pure Merinos, has been
derived. In the interval that has elapsed since the year 1801,
Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur has been enabled to dispose of several rams,
of the mixed and improved breed, at prices varying from
14<i>l</i>. to 28<i>l</i>. a head; but he has always considered
that the improvement of the fleeces of his flock, by preserving
the purity of their breed, and preventing admixture with sheep of
inferior quality, was a matter of much more importance to him
than the multiplication of their numbers. In pursuing this
object, he has received accidental, but important assistance in
the prevention of access to the Cow Pastures, that has already
been noticed; and while other individuals of the colony, who,
although possessed of sheep of the pure Merino breed, were
insensible to the importance of separating their breeding flocks
and preserving their purity, or were unwilling to incur the
expense and trouble of securing it by enclosures and strict
superintendence, Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur has at length succeeded in
creating a most valuable stock for the increase of his own
flocks, or for the improvement of others. This improvement has
already been perceptible in the flocks of a few individuals; and
the high prices for which the finest fleeces of Mr.
M&lsquo;Arthur's flock have been sold in the London market, will
no doubt direct the attention of other proprietors of land and
stock, to the adoption of the same means by which he has
succeeded in obtaining such a valuable article of export. It does
not appear that sheep that are fed in the colony of New South
Wales are subject to any other or more obstinate diseases than
those that affect them in England; and while there is reason to
believe that the peculiar dryness of the atmosphere is very
favorable to them, the flocks have not been found to suffer
material injury from the heavy I droughts. In the lambing season,
which continues from April to the month of May, it is found
necessary to provide artificial food where an extensive range of
pasturage cannot be resorted to. Until the year 1819, Mr.
M&lsquo;Arthur has not found it necessary to change the pasturage
of his own flocks; nor is it considered that such a mode of
treatment, though much practised, is indispensible for sheep of
the Merino breed. When they are in good condition, the average
weight of their carcase is sixty-five pounds, and they have in
some instances attained seventy. The average quantity of wool,
produced by each sheep in Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur's flock, amounted in
the year 1820 to two pounds seven ounces per fleece. In their
daily range for food the flocks are distributed in different
liens of an estate, and each flock amounts generally to 300. In
the night-time it is necessary to place them in folds, to
preserve them from the attacks of the native dog of New South
Wales, a fierce and destructive animal when in pursuit of prey,
but easily intimidated by the presence of men or dogs.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to allude to the only obstacles
that appeared to me to prevent the rapid augmentation of the
growth of fine wool in the colony of New South Wales; they
consisted of the difficulty and expense of transporting the wool
from the interior to the coast; the prospective augmentation of
duty that existed, until an act that was passed in the last
session of parliament suspended the payment of any higher duty
than one penny per pound on all wool that should be imported into
England, from New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land, for the next
ten years; and the difficulty that had been experienced in
obtaining the labour of convicts accustomed to agricultural
occupations.</p>
<p>The measures that I have had the honour to recommend for the
provisional occupation of extensive tracts of grazing land in the
country to the west and north of Bathurst, appear to me to
provide against the dangers that might be apprehended from a too
general dispersion of the convicts; and it will then only remain
for the local government to improve the present communication
between Bathurst and the seacoast, by the road over the Blue
Mountains. The ascent of Mount York is at present a difficult one
for loaded carts; and it is very probable that, unless another
and more easy route should be discovered, the use of mules in
passing the Blue Mountains will be found preferable to that of
carts and waggons. I should, however, recommend, that even in the
present state of the road, a station for the reception of stock
and cattle that are driven from Bathurst to the coast, should be
established at the foot of Mount York; and that a military guard,
consisting of a sergeant and eight men, should likewise he placed
there, for the purpose of watching and giving notice of the
number of cattle and sheep that pass the mountains. A stockyard
might also be placed at this station for the reception of cattle,
and in this manner it would be found practicable to combine the
advantages of police with those of temporary refreshment to the
sheep and grazing stock, that is very requisite for them after
passing over the sterile ridges of the Blue Mountains. Similar
measures should be adopted on the roads that lead to the counties
of Argyle and Camden, if it shall be found that the tracts of
land on the eastern and south-western sides of the range of the
Cookbundoon hills afford good pasturage for sheep and cattle. A
stock yard had been erected by the only two individuals whose
cattle had penetrated those districts; and the station in which
it is placed is well chosen, both for security and temporary
refreshment. Facility of access has been given by opening a track
from the Cow Pastures to the summit of the Cookbundoon Range; the
largest trees had been felled and removed; and although the roots
will be a source of the same inconvenience in future that has
been felt on the Bathurst and other roads of the colony, yet at
the present moment I do not see the necessity of making any
further improvement than constructing a wooden bridge over the
river of Wingee Caribbee, and laying platforms of the same
material in two swampy passes on the northern side of the
Merigong Range.</p>
<p>It is possible that a practicable communication to the
sea-coast from these tracts may be discovered, which will
facilitate the export of their produce to Sydney and the settled
districts. If the sanguine expectations entertained by Mr.
Thoresby on this subject are realized, I should recommend that
after a line of road has been well surveyed, assistance in making
the most difficult parts of it should be given in convict labour.
For the same reasons I am induced to recommend, that the steep
ascent that renders communication difficult between the district
called Illawarra and the district of Airds, should be improved by
giving a new direction to the present track.</p>
<p>It is in removing impediments of this kind, and in the
distribution of agricultural labourers, that it appears to me
that the local government can afford the most beneficial
assistance to the first efforts of individuals in agricultural
enterprizes, leaving to them at a future period the task of
carrying on the improvements of the communications between the
remoter positions and the ports or depots to which the produce
may be carried.</p>
<p>A proposal was submitted to Governor Macquarie in the year
1820, for the establishment of a joint stock company in New South
Wales for the growth and production of fine wool. In aid of this
establishment pecuniary assistance was requested by advances from
the police-fund; the assignment of agricultural labourers as they
arrived from England; an unlimited range for flocks of sheep in
the interior, not approaching nearer to the settled estates than
five miles; and an importation of sheep of the pure Merino breed
at the expense of government, the cost of which was to be repaid
at a future period, and in the meantime to be secured upon the
shares of the subscribers and the flocks of sheep as they might
be produced.</p>
<p>The objection made by Governor Macquarie to this proposal,
appears to have arisen from an apprehension of the consequences
of placing so many convict labourers in remote situations, under
no other or better control than that of the individual
superintendent of the establishment whom it was proposed to
appoint. This circumstance forms certainly the essential
objection to the extension of settlements in which convicts are
employed, or their removal to a great distance from the residence
of some individual clothed with authority to control and punish
them; and as far as the proposal made to Governor Macquarie
limited the chance of control, by limiting the number of
superintendents, I concur with him in the objection that he made.
I am not aware that the proposal was founded un any general
support from individuals in the colony, although I am disposed to
believe that, from the indisposition already adverted to in the
proprietors of stock to leave their establishments in the settled
districts, and to repair to those more remote for the purpose of
devoting themselves exclusively to the growth of fine wool, they
would gladly have embraced any proposition that had a tendency to
exempt them from individual exertion, and in which no other or
greater degree of risk or expense was to be incurred than that of
paying the salary of the superintendent, and the subsistence of a
certain number of convicts.</p>
<p>Upon the expediency of promoting in the colony of New South
Wales the growth of fine wool, and creating a valuable export
from thence to Great Britain, no doubt I can be entertained, as
it appears to be the principal, if not the only source of
productive industry within the colony, from which the settlers
can derive the means of repaying the advances made to then from
the mother country, or supplying their own demands for articles
of foreign manufacture.</p>
<p>The great extent of pasturage that is now opened between the
course of the river Hastings on the north, and the country that
has been discovered in the neighbourhood of lakes George and
Bathurst on the south, affords the most favourable opportunities
for individuals disposed and capable of entering upon an
extensive scheme of agricultural speculation.</p>
<p>From the first account that I have already adverted to, of the
character of the country to the south of the lakes, and from
thence to the shores of Bass's Straits, as well as of the rivers
and bays that have been discovered upon the eastern coast of that
country, I am not inclined to infer that it will afford any
valuable accession to the agricultural resources of the colony;
but I cannot help recommending in this place that the eastern as
well as the southern shore of that tract should be accurately
examined, with the special purpose of discovering the existence
of rivers and harbours, and the nature of their communication
with the interior.</p>
<p>This survey may be very advantageously extended along the
northern shore of Bass's Straits from Cape Howe as far as
Spencer's Gulph; for although a general description of such parts
of this coast as were distantly visible from a ship's deck, has
been given by Captain Flinders, and may be useful for navigators,
yet it affords no means of forming a judgment of the character of
the interior, or its capacity for colonization. With a view to
obtain such information, I should recommend that the expedition
of land survey should, in the first instance, take its departure
from the head of Port Philip, or that of Western Port in Bass's
Straits, and taking from thence a north-easterly direction,
should endeavour to pursue its course to lake George. The object
of this expedition would be to ascertain the character of the
country lying within these limits, as well as the possibility of
a communication by land between the shores of Bass's Straits and
the small portion of the territory of New South Wales that is
already known and settled. If the character of this tract shall
be found to bear any resemblance to those that have lately been
examined, I apprehend it will be found to possess little facility
of internal communication by %veer. On the other hand, the extent
of its surface, and the natural pasturage for sheep and cattle
that there is reason to expect it will afford, the superior
attractions of its climate and the facility of intercourse with
the northern settlements of Van Diemen's Land and the islands in
Bass's Straits, all constitute reasons for attempting the
colonization of this tract; first by a careful survey of the
country itself, and afterwards by the gradual introduction of
free settlers.</p>
<p>I have already stated my reasons, in a former Report, for not
occupying such or indeed any positions on the coasts of Bass's
Straits as receptacles for convicts. The restraints that are
found necessary wherever such establishments are fixed, are
unfavorable to foreign commerce, or even to much internal
intercourse; and they are equally unfavorable to the purposes of
punishment. Independent of the advantages that have been derived
in New South Wales from the easy multiplication of the stock of
cattle and sheep, those arising from the increase in the number
of horses ought not to be overlooked. The number of horses is
stated in the general return of the year 1810 to have amounted to
1,114; and in the year 1820, it had increased to 3,639. The breed
of horses now prevailing in New South Wales is derived
principally from those of Bengal that have an admixture of
Arabian blood, and from a few importations of English horses of
the lighter breeds. They partake more of the character of the
former than of the latter, and are more distinguished by symmetry
than by strength; but they are found, notwithstanding, to be
serviceable for draught, and are capable of bearing great
fatigue. Some attention has lately been paid to the improvement
of the breed of horses by the higher classes of settlers; but
these efforts appear to have been in some degree checked by the
want of inclosures, and of artificial food during the winter and
spring. Wherever clover has been mixed with the natural grasses
of the country, hay of a very good quality has been obtained; and
it is sometimes made from the natural grass alone. Good clover
hay has hitherto, however, been so scarce in the colony, that it
has seldom been sold for less than 10<i>l</i>. per ton, and is
very rarely to be purchased. In the town of Sydney, where the
principal demand for it exists, the supply of food for horses has
been obtained by the extra labour of convicts, who procure grass
from the banks of the Paramatta River. The advantages that are
thus derived from the easy multiplication of the stock in New
South Wales, are infinitely greater than those that are likely to
be derived from the cultivation of the land.</p>
<p>Independent of the effects of an uncertain climate, that is
not generally favourable to the growth of European grains, and of
a degree of heat that either too suddenly or too quickly follows
a long series of heavy rains, and scorches rather than matures it
the smaller grains of New South Wales, though equal in quality to
those of the south of Europe, have to contend with frequent
blights at Bathurst, and either from the proper seasons for
sowing not having yet been discovered, or from some other cause,
the wheat has been always affected with smut; and in a few years,
in which the season has been very dry, an insect, denominated the
fly-moth, was observed to be generated in the grain produced in
the settled districts, before it was removed from the field. The
insect continued in it after being stacked, and when opened or
exposed to the air, a great proportion of the grain was found to
be consumed. A greater and more constant loss of grain is
sustained from the devastation of the weevil after the wheat is
stacked, and very few of the settlers in New South Wales possess
granaries, or even barns, for its protection from the sudden
vicissitudes of weather. The general state of the farm buildings
in the colony is indeed much worse than might have been expected
from the abundance of materials that are furnished from the
woods. Two reasons only are assignable for such
neglect,&mdash;the expense and difficulty of procuring mechanical
labour, and the careless and improvident habits of a large
proportion of the settlers.</p>
<p>By returns that were furnished to me of the number of
mechanics in the different districts of New South Wales in the
year 1820, I find that there were seventy carpenters, fifty-five
sawyers, forty-three blacksmiths, and seventeen brickmakers,
either free or holding tickets of leave, independent of those of
the same and other descriptions that had been assigned as convict
servants to individuals, or that were retained in the government
works.</p>
<p>In perusing the list of the persons to whom mechanics had been
so assigned, I find them to consist either of the magistrates or
of the officers of the government, who, until within the last
three years, have held grants of land, and have proceeded in the
cultivation and improvement of them. The wages of a mechanic in
the neighbourhood of Paramatta, in which it appears that such
persons are most numerous, amount to 7<i>s</i>. or 8<i>s</i>. per
day where subsistence is not found, and marly the same price is
paid for convict mechanics working by the piece, or on their own
time.</p>
<p>The general indisposition evinced by the mechanics to leave
the towns, or to undertake labour in the country, and the loss of
time experienced by the settlers, as well as risk to their
property, by leaving it in the hands of convict servants for the
purpose of procuring immediate repairs, have much augmented the
expenses and the disappointments of agricultural exertion in New
South Wales.</p>
<p>To these abundant sources of vexation and complaint may be
further added the uncertainty of the colonial markets both for
grain and meat. It has already been stated that the demand for
both these commodities has, until very lately, been limited by
the consumption of the convicts who were retained for the service
of government at the different stations, and that of the military
and civil officers who were entitled to draw rations from the
King's store.</p>
<p>These stations have for some time been established at Sydney,
Paramatta, Windsor and Liverpool; and lately one was added for
the supply of the establishment of convicts at Emu Plains. The
benefit of a temporary supply to a party of convicts employed to
open the road from the Cow Pastures to the Cookbundoon Hills, was
given to an individual whose herds of cattle were grazing in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The market at Bathurst has wholly consisted of the demand for
wheat and meat that existed there for the subsistence of the
convicts and the superintendents; and it has been supplied either
by Mr. Cox, or by a certain number of the settlers in the
immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The price paid for wheat by government during the last ten
years in New South Wales, has been fixed by the Governor, who
appears during the later periods to have been guided or confirmed
in that measure by a reference to the magistrates, who in the
year 1814, gave it as their opinion, that wheat and maize could
not be grown in the eastern districts of the colony, so as to
leave a reasonable profit to the grower, at a less selling price
than 10<i>s</i>. per bushel for wheat, and 5<i>s</i>. per bushel
for maize, delivered at Sydney.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of Governor Macquarie in New South Wales in
the year 1810, and for a considerable time afterwards, a great
scarcity of wheat prevailed in the colony, in consequence of the
effects of a severe inundation of the river Hawkesbury that had
occurred in the year 1808. To relieve the pressure of this
scarcity, the governor had recourse to importations of wheat from
Bengal. These continued to be supplied during the year 1811; and
from a wish to give effect to the instructions of His Majesty's
government in reducing the expenses of the colony, as well as to
afford an inducement to many of the settlers to repay the
advances that had been made to them either in cattle or grain,
the acting commissary, Mr. Broughton, issued a notice, on the
19th December 1812, by order of the governor, stating that wheat
would be received into store at Sydney and Paramatta at the rate
of 10<i>s</i>. per bushel, and at 9<i>s</i>. at Windsor, in
payment of debts due to government; but that as the quantity of
wheat then in store was considerable, and that it would be
further augmented by the quantity expected to be received on
account of the debts due to the crown, a notice was given that no
further purchase of wheat would be rendered necessary on account
of government until the end of the ensuing year (1813); and that
if deficiency should occur, no more than 8<i>s</i>. per bushel
would be paid for wheat received at Sydney, nor more than
7<i>s</i>. for wheat received at Windsor. The government store
had been open the whole of the year 1812, and large purchases had
been made in the early part of that year from the executors of an
individual at Windsor, and from two merchants at Sydney towards
the latter end of it. The quantity of wheat in store was
considerable, and it was so much affected by weevil that it was
not considered prudent either to augment it, or to mix it with
the new wheat of the year 1813. It was under these circumstances
that Mr. Broughton, then at the head of the commissariat
department, though differing with the governor as to the
expediency of reducing the price of wheat, advised him to issue
the notice already mentioned, under a conscientious belief that
the state of the supply, both actual and prospective, justified
the measure. The government stores had remained shut from the
latter end of December 1812, and were not opened until the 1st of
April 1813.</p>
<p>In ordinary seasons in New South Wales, the stores may be
opened for the reception of wheat in the month of February of
each year; the inhabitants of the colony, therefore, were much
disappointed on finding themselves, as it were, excluded from
their best and ordinary market; very few of those who were
indebted to government tendered their grain in payment; and such
was the depreciation of that article in the market, that the
settlers became careless of it, and insensible to the admonitions
of those who had the sagacity to foresee a want of grain, and the
prudence to provide against it.</p>
<p>In the month of August of the year 1813, the supplies to
government had been so small, and the waste of grain so profuse,
by the settlers, that on the arrival of Mr. Deputy Commissary
General Allan, and upon an inspection of the state of the stores,
a scarcity of wheat was apprehended, and the store price was
raised from 8<i>s</i>. to 12<i>s</i>. per bushel, and great
difficulty was experienced in obtaining any supplies
whatever.</p>
<p>In the early part of the year 1814, the store price of wheat
appears to have risen as high as 13<i>s</i>.; and in November, in
consequence of arrivals from India, it fell to 10<i>s</i>. At the
latter end of the same year, the governor, with a view to
encourage the settlers to extend the cultivation of their land,
issued an order, in which, after making several regulations for
the impartial admission of the settlers to the benefit of the
store supply, promised to continue the then existing price of
10<i>s</i>. per bushel for the harvest of 1815, and also for that
of 1816. It appears that this promise had the effect of producing
some increase of cultivation, for in the year 1814 the quantity
of land cultivated in wheat amounted to 8,613 acres, and in 1816
it had been increased to 13,228. Since that period, although
fluctuations in the market price have been frequent, yet the
store price has experienced neither rise nor depression until the
month of July 1820, when, in consequence of an exhaustion of the
supply of wheat in the colony, that haul nut been duly
anticipated, and a great increase in the consumption, purchases
were made of wheat, imported from Van Diemen's Land, at
11<i>s</i>. and 12<i>s</i>. per bushel. The store price of maize
has fluctuated from 3<i>s</i>. to 7<i>s</i>.; for as it is a
grain of more general consumption, on account of the various uses
to which it is found to be applicable, and as it is more easily
preserved than wheat, the settlers have not been disposed to
submit to any depression of price below that which the market
afforded; and the purchases of this grain on account of
government have not been considerable, except in the years 1815
and 1818.</p>
<p>The deputy commissary general at Sydney, furnished me with a
document, showing the quantities of wheat and maize purchased in
the colony in each year, from April 1810 to June 1820
inclusive.</p>
<p>Between the year 1814 and the year 1819, the purchases of
wheat by government appear to have gradually increased from
24,258 bushels to 54,895, and in the year 1820 there was every
probability of that quantity being exceeded.</p>
<p>I was informed in 1819, by an intelligent officer of the
commissariat department, that, for two years preceding, the
demand of government and of the market had exceeded the quantity
of wheat produced in the colony of New South Wales, and
considerable purchases of that grain have been made from Van
Diemen's Land Indeed, such was the state of the market and the
increase of consumption towards the end of the year 1820, in both
settlements, that a speculation was entered into for the
importation of wheat from Valparaiso.</p>
<p>It is not therefore from a want of a remunerating rice in the
purchases of grain by the local government, that the settlers in
New South Wales have had to complain. It is %yell known, that if
the ordinary mode of purchase by contract had been resorted to,
or if indeed a less price than 10<i>s</i>. per bushel for wheat
had been offered, the settlers must have submitted to it, or have
taken the chance of obtaining less favourable terms in the Sydney
market.</p>
<p>The great causes that have operated unfavourably to the
agriculture of New South Wales have been the uncertainty of the
demand for produce, together with the difficulties in obtaining
access to the government stores, and the expense and risk of
cultivation, either as arising from the climate, the frequent
varieties of the soil, or from the carelessness and unskilfulness
of the convict servants.</p>
<p>The first notice of an attempt on the part of the governor to
reduce the price of wheat, or the demand for it by government in
1813, created a great degree of alarm and discontent amongst the
settlers. They assembled together, and in a plain but respectful
manner prayed that permission might be given to them to dispose
of their grain for the purpose of distillation; and that
assistance might be granted to them for the homeward freight of
such articles of colonial growth as they thought might be
saleable in the English markets. It has been, seen that the
governor did not make any subsequent reduction in the store price
of wheat; but as it was not considered expedient at that period
to allow of the distillation of spirits from grain, the only
means that remained to him of compliance with the requests of the
settlers, and as he also considered, with the interests of the
colony, was to create an extended market by extending the
consumption of grain on government account.</p>
<p>It is possible that with assistance, judiciously extended, the
settlers might have been led to turn their attention at an
earlier period to the production of other objects than those that
solely depended upon the demand of government. The period however
was not favourable for their export under the regulations that at
that time governed the maritime intercourse between Great Britain
and the colony; and from the very slow progress that has been
made in the growth and production of fine wool, I am inclined to
doubt whether such experiments, if conducted by individuals,
might not by their failure have led to the discouragement of all
future attempts. For the success of such attempts, capital,
skill, perseverance and personal exertion were alike necessary;
and without meaning to discredit the exertions of a few of the
settlers in New South Wales, who certainly have shown that they
possessed some of these qualities, I can very safely affirm, that
amongst the large body of settlers, no enterprize was to be
expected that required a combination of them. It is only justice
to state, that every exertion has been made on the part of
Governor Macquarie, since the year 1813, to prevent a monopoly of
the only market that was offered. Ills order, published in
November 1814, directed that all the tenders that were made to
the officers of the commissariat department at the different
stations, should be sent to the officer at the head of that
department, and submitted to himself for approval: for some time
this order appears to have been complied with, and the quantities
of grain that each person tendered were published in the
Gazette.</p>
<p>Various have been the expedients tried and recommended to
ensure to every class of the settlers a proportional share of the
benefit of the government supply. Except on one occasion, that
occurred during the management of the commissariat department by
the late Mr. Acting Assistant Commissary General Broughton, the
admission to the supply of grain appeared to have been guided by
fairness and impartiality. It was his practice, as soon after the
harvest as he considered proper, to send round hand-bills to the
different districts, giving notice that the stores were open for
the reception of grain, and that those who wished to supply were
required to send in tenders. A subsequent notice was given, so as
to prepare the settlers, and the stores were kept open till they
were full. In the execution of this duty, a certain degree of
discretion was exercised by the subordinate officers of the
commissariat at the different stations; and a further control by
the chief officer at Sydney, who was directed to have reference
to the muster books whenever he had reason to believe that the
person tendering either grain or meat was not a cultivator, or
that he had purchased the wheat of another, and in such cases to
reject it, and the person so tendering was deprived of the
indulgence of supplying for the remainder of the season. Mr.
Broughton has however declared, that in many instances the
entries in the muster books were delusive and not to be depended
upon; and that from the returns of the quantity of stock, a
deduction of at least one-twelfth ought to be made. He further
states, that in cases where he was enabled to satisfy himself by
documents, that the wheat that was offered by the landlords in
the towns, was received in payment from their tenants, he did not
think himself justified in refusing it. This principle, though
just in itself, was always liable to great abuse; and several
names appear in Mr. Broughton's lists, as well as in those of the
year 1818, that excite much suspicion of the motives that led to
their admission.</p>
<p>From the anxiety of the poorer classes of settlers to bring
their produce to the store at the earliest opportunity, and not
unfrequently to conceal their names from the inquiries of
creditors, it became very difficult to make any regulations by
which embarrassment could be prevented, at the first period
appointed for receiving grain.</p>
<p>It generally happened that the grain produced by this class of
settlers was in worse condition than that of others, and that it
was to be screened before it could be received into store, and
thence arose fresh delays, fraud in the admixture of the grain,
and bribery of the subordinate servants to conceal it. From bad
weather, or accident, a settler might be delayed, and the store
disappointed; and it would then depend upon the humanity or
consideration of the officer in charge, whether the turn of such
a person should be lost, or reserved for a future day. The
distances of the principal grain districts from the principal
receiving store at Sydney, and the state of the roads until a
late period, might and have frequently caused these
disappointments, both to the settler and to the store. To the
former, there was no remedy but that of resorting to the
public-houses in Sydney, where there are granaries for temporary
deposit, together with great temptations to dispose of the grain
at a heavy loss; and to the latter, no other expedient that that
of purchasing grain from those who kept it in deposit, and within
reach of the King's store.</p>
<p>The importations of wheat and rice from India that were made
in the years 1815 and 1816, and those that have more lately been
made from Van Diemen's Land, have tended to convince the
settlers, who were engaged in the cultivation of wheat in New
South Wales, that the period was passed in which the colony was
under the necessity of relying upon its own resources for the
production of wheat, or for the supply of the deficiency that
might be created by accident. These circumstances, together with
the increasing distance from the market at which every new
settler was necessarily placed, or in which, after exhausting a
first grant, some settlers succeeded in obtaining a second, have
materially diminished the encouragement that the demand of
government for grain in New South Wales has hitherto created. The
endeavours of the colonists to procure the additional benefit of
a foreign market have not been more encouraging: In the year
1819, a cargo of flour was exported to the Cape of Good Hope in a
vessel that had been built in the colony, and commanded by an
officer and manned principally by sailors who had been born in
it. The season of the year in which the voyage was commenced was
unfavourable; and from the consequent delay and difficulty that
occurred in procuring a return cargo, the profits of the
speculation were not such as to encourage a repetition of it. It
is, therefore, from the internal consumption of grain that the
colonists have long hoped to derive the benefits of an extended
market; and it is from this source that they are led to expect
the revival of the drooping state of their agriculture, and the
means of extricating themselves from the embarrassments in which
they think that a restricted demand for produce has hitherto
placed them.</p>
<p>The permission to distil spirits from every species of grain
raised in the colony, or in Van Diemen's Land, as long as the
price of wheat in the Sydney market should not exceed 10<i>s</i>.
per bushel, was to take effect in the month of August of the year
1822.</p>
<p>I have already adverted to the expense and risks of
cultivation in New South Wales, as permanent drawbacks from the
successful cultivation of land in grain. The ordinary incapacity
of the convicts for field labour, and the rate of wages and
subsistence afforded them, form large items in this part of the
account. They are estimated by Mr. Cox to amount to the sum of
25<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>. per annum for each convict, whether
skilful or unskilful: of this sum, 9<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. form the
cost of the annual ration of meat, consisting of seven pounds per
week, at 6<i>d</i>. per pound; and 6<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. is the
cost of the ration of wheat, at the rate of a peck per week;
making, with the wages of 10<i>l</i>. the annual charge of
25<i>l</i>. 12<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>By the same gentleman, the expense of converting into tillage
an acre of forest land, or land of an ordinary quality, and
cultivating it with wheat, is estimated at 6<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>.
per acre. The cost of the same operation in maize, he estimates
at 5<i>l</i>. 8<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. calculating the produce at
twenty bushels for the land cultivated in wheat, and at forty
bushels for that cultivated in maize.</p>
<p>Supposing the estimate of the produce to be correct, and that
the whole of it was sold at the store price that has been given
for wheat and maize during the later periods of the colony, the
profits of such cultivation of land, that is granted gratuitously
and only subject to a trifling quit-rent, would seem to afford
ample encouragement. The several causes of deduction from these
profits I have already enumerated, and they have been such as
generally to discourage the higher classes of settlers from
embarking largely in the cultivation of grain.</p>
<p>In my inquiry respecting the expenses of cultivating the
smaller farms of fifty acres, I obtained from Mr. Oxley, the
surveyor-general, a very detailed answer. Assuming a period of
three years, and that the operations of the first are commenced
and continued by a settler on fifty acres of land, with
assistance from government in the article of subsistence for six
months, and with sufficient of his own funds to provide it
himself for the remainder, he considers that, in that year, the
expenses of cultivation would exceed the profits by 5<i>l</i>.
19<i>s</i>; in the second year, that the profits would exceed the
expenses by 49<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>; and that, in the third year,
they would be reduced to 36<i>l</i>. 8<i>s</i>. To this amount,
however, is to be added the value of poultry raised on the farms,
which, with the value of the settler's own labour, may be
estimated at 15<i>l</i>. more. In the whole of this calculation,
it is assumed that the grantee of the fifty acres possesses some
knowledge of farming; that he is enabled to procure manure
sufficient to renovate his land in the third year; that the
quality of it is such as to enable him to bring the whole of it
into ultimate cultivation; and that the market will constantly
afford him 10<i>s</i>. per bushel for his wheat, and 4<i>s</i>.
for the maize. In these cases, Mr. Oxley considers that the net
receipts of his farm may be safely estimated at 60<i>l</i>. per
annum, and that with care they may be continued at that
amount.</p>
<p>For the ordinary class of settlers, to whom sixty acres of
land are usually allotted, the prospect afforded by this
calculation is in very many cases a forbidding one. It supposes
industrious habits, some portion of agricultural knowledge, and
the application of the annual savings to the purchase of
agricultural implements, buildings, and lastly the operation of a
steady demand for produce.</p>
<p>To settlers possessing a moderate share of capital, some
previous acquaintance with agricultural pursuits, and
intelligence in the selection of land, the calculation is on the
other hand not discouraging; and when applied to more extensive
grants, and united with the profits to be derived from grazing,
may afford to those who are emigrating to New South Wales, the
means of ascertaining the real extent of the sacrifice that they
are making, or of the expectations that they may justly
indulge.</p>
<p>Before I proceed to submit to your Lordship the subsisting
regulations by which the grants of land have been made in New
South Wales, I will beg leave to describe the state of
agriculture in the settlement at Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The island has been divided into two counties, one called the
county of Buckinghamshire, extending from the southern coast of
the island to the forty-second degree of south latitude the other
called the county of Cornwall, and extending from the same
dividing line to the northern coast. The county of
Buckinghamshire has been divided into twenty-three districts, but
without any particular view to their natural boundaries or to the
existing state of the population. Very few of the names that were
given to these districts have been preserved in the civil
administration of the colony; and hardly any of them were known
to the colonists themselves.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Evans, the deputy surveyor, that some of
these districts are too confined for townships, and that several
would only form one.</p>
<p>The most cultivated tracts in the county of Buckinghamshire
are those that lie on the shores of the harbour of the river
Derwent, the shores of North Bay, and of an arm of the sea called
Pitt Water.</p>
<p>Upon the shores of the harbour, and in ascending it towards
Hobart Town, the cultivation does not extend beyond a narrow line
of sloping land that forms the base of the hills on the western
shore; and a few farms that have been cultivated upon the
eastern.</p>
<p>The soil in the former tracts consists in many places of a
rich and sandy loam. The farms are small and have been occupied
for some length of time, and cultivated by marines who were
discharged from service in the years 1802 and 1803. The state
both of the farms and buildings, as well as of the produce,
indicated the poverty of the owners as well as their bad
cultivation. The land upon the hills is stony, but covered with
grass, which affords a slender support to a few cattle. Around
Hobart Town the land is of very inferior quality; but in
ascending the left bank of the river Derwent it improves, but
exhibits very remarkable variations within a very small space. It
is on the tract of land called Clarence's Plains, and more
especially in the district of Pitt Water and the Coal River, that
the pre-eminent fertility of the soil of Van Diemen's Land is
exhibited. The surface of these tracts is sufficiently varied and
open to prevent the stagnation of the water, but not to impede
cultivation. The soil consists of a sandy loam, and in Pitt Water
of a rich and reddish loam of some depth and tenacity. The timber
hardly exceeds the proportion that would be requisite for
ornament, and at present is insufficient for the construction of
buildings and fences. The farms are here of a larger extent than
in the other districts of Van Diemen's Land, and the appearance
of five or six of the farm-houses indicated attention to domestic
comfort and agricultural improvement.</p>
<p>The houses are principally built of wood, and thatched with
straw or shingles. Stone of a good quality has been found in the
district of Pitt Water, but has not yet been worked.</p>
<p>The smaller settlers in these districts consist of disbanded
marines, and the families of the convicts that were formerly
established at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>There are also settlers whose terms of service have expired or
have been remitted, and who have purchased land from the original
grantees.</p>
<p>The produce of the land consists chiefly of wheat, a very
little barley, and potatoes. The quality of the wheat produced in
this part of Van Diemen's Land, IS considered to be superior to
that of New South Wales. The barley has not been found to succeed
so well; but the cultivation of this grain and of oats has
hitherto been very inconsiderable and has not been fairly tried.
The potatoes of Van Diemen's Land, especially those that are
grown on the lighter soils, are fully equal to the best potatoes
of English growth, and yield very abundant returns.</p>
<p>If the cultivation was conducted with an ordinary degree of
skill, the produce oft wheat in these districts could not fail to
be very abundant; at present it is estimated upon an average of
five years, ending March 1820, to be about twenty-four bushels
per acre. The cultivated lands of each farm are entirely open,
and except upon an estate of Colonel Davey and one of Mr. Lord, I
did not observe a single fence.</p>
<p>The cultivation of artificial grasses in the southern part of
Van Diemen's Land seemed to be altogether neglected in the year
1820, although a striking and solitary instance of its success
and of its profits was exhibited upon the estate of an individual
at a little distance from Hobart Town.</p>
<p>From the difficulty that now exists of obtaining pasturage for
their cattle upon their estates the settlers, especially those
who do not possess more than fifty acres, are in the habit of
sending their flocks to a considerable distance from the
cultivated grounds, under a permission that they obtain from the
lieutenant-governor, and called a ticket of occupation. A
multiplication of the quantity of stock is thus obtained; but it
is attended with a great deterioration of its quality, in
consequence of the little care that is taken to separate the
flocks.</p>
<p>Great advantage is derived to the settlers in the district of
Pitt Water, from its contiguity to the sea, and the access that
is thereby afforded to the market at Hobart Town. The distance by
land conveyance is twenty-two miles, and by water about forty.
Vessels of light tonnage can anchor in Pitt Water in live or
seven fathoms depth, to receive the produce of the district; for
the conveyance of which to Hobart Town, the price charged is a
deduction of one bushel of wheat in every ten. This district is
not in other respects well watered: two of the three streams in
it contain brackish water, and as yet no wells have been
sunk.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the other parts of the county of
Buckinghamshire is extended to the banks of the Coal River, a
small stream that falls into an arm of the sea at Pitt Water, on
which there are some very fine and beautiful tracts of land,
equally calculated for the purposes of grazing or tillage. In
some portions of these tracts the effects of inundation are
visible; but the general character of the country is attractive,
very accessible, and not more encumbered with wood than its wants
will be found to require. Settlements have also been made upon
the banks of a river called the Jordan, that falls into the
Derwent at Herdsman's Cove; also upon the higher stream of that
river. These settlements are not remarkable for the fertility of
the soil.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the settlement called New Norfolk chiefly
consist of the convicts who were sent to Norfolk Island, and were
removed from thence after being habituated to the soft climate
and rich soil of that beautiful settlement.</p>
<p>There are very few amongst, them who have not suffered in
their circumstances by this removal, and all regret it.</p>
<p>The indulgent consideration with which their claims were
treated on leaving their settlements in Norfolk Island, and on
their arrival in Van Diemen's Land, has neither soothed that
regret nor improved their circumstances; and most of them became
the easy victims of temporary indulgence on their arrival, and
are now regretting the sacrifices that they were induced to make
of the advantages that the government very liberally bestowed
upon them. Their habitations are small and in a state of great
dilapidation, and their lands appear to be exhausted by perpetual
cropping.</p>
<p>The soil of these districts is generally light and sandy,
except upon the immediate banks of the river Jordan, in which it
has an alluvial character, and the vegetation is therefore more
luxuriant. The river itself has much of the character of those in
New South Wales: it is confined to deep pools or narrow channels
in the summer, and spreads beyond its banks to a considerable
distance in winter.</p>
<p>A few settlements have been made on the line of road that
traverses the country to Port Dalrymple, leading through the
plains called Bagdad to the Green Ponds. The land of these
settlements is not unfit for cultivation, and always capable of
it, with little preliminary expense of the removal of timber from
the surface.</p>
<p>The districts that are cultivated in the county of Cornwall
are confined to the banks of the South and North Esk Rivers, that
fall into the river Tamar at Launceston. They are not a greater
distance from that place than fourteen miles; but the access from
Norfolk Plains is yet difficult for loaded carts.</p>
<p>The soil in one of the vallies watered by the North Esk, and
called Paterson's Plains, is a light and rich loamy deposit,
bearing good and continued crops, even in the worst state of
cultivation. The inundations of the rivers on this side of Van
Diemen's Land do not seem to be so extensive as in the few
smaller streams that penetrate the centre.</p>
<p>The North and South Esk Rivers take their rise in the great
eastern and western ridges that border the plains through which
the road passes from the south to the northern side of the
island, and possess a character altogether different from the
sedgy and stagnant pools of the interior. They are clear, full
and rapid, even during the summer.</p>
<p>The settlement at Norfolk Plains contains a few good
habitations, but the soil is inferior to that of Paterson's
Plains and the immediate neighbourhood of Launceston.</p>
<p>The country that lies between the ford of the South Esk River
and Paterson's Plains, comprises some beautiful tracts of land;
the graceful and easy undulations of which are covered with fine
herbage, and slightly encumbered with wood. The want of water
unfortunately diminishes their value in every sense, and they are
probably the last tracts that will be selected by settlers for
profit or convenience.</p>
<p>The cultivation and produce of this part of Van Diemen's Land
differs in no respect from those of the southern districts,
except in the prevalence of white clover in the immediate
neighbourhood of Launceston. This grass was introduced by Colonel
Paterson on the first settlement of Port Dalrymple, and by his
own care and personal attention was disseminated in a small tract
of flat land that is in front of the town of Launceston, and upon
the margin of the river Tamar. One individual only since that
period seems to have been sensible of the benefit thus conferred
upon the settlement, and has extended that benefit to his own
estate in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The total quantity of land cultivated in wheat in the county
of Buckinghamshire appears, by the muster of the year 1820, to
have amounted to 6,293 acres; and that in the county of Cornwall
to 2,982. The grain that is produced in both districts is of
greater size and weight than that of New South Wales, and is not
liable to the ravages of the fly, moth, or weevil. The seasons
are likewise observed to be more regular, and the effect of
blight or drought has very rarely been experienced. The springs
appear to be late in Van Diemen's Land; and the frost has been so
severe in the month of October, and even so late as January, as
entirely to destroy the early growth of the potatoe crop. In the
interior of the country, the effect of frost upon this vegetable
has universally been felt, and has much checked the cultivation
of it.</p>
<p>Next to the advantages of climate that Van Diemen's Land
possesses, the facility with which the soil may be cultivated, is
one that has contributed to give it a preference in the
estimation of settlers over the colony of New South Wales. In the
districts that I have enumerated, the felling, burning, and
rooting up of timber, which in New South Wales constitutes so
large a portion of the expense of cultivation, hardly forms an
item of it. The trees are generally small, stunted, and scattered
thinly, and afford slight impediments to the early use of the
plough. Instances have of late occurred where, by diligence and
industry, a settler has brought as much as sixty acres of new
land into cultivation, and sown it with wheat, during the first
five months of his location upon it, with no more assistance than
that of tour convicts, a plough and team of bullocks.</p>
<p>Until the period in which the convicts were transported
directly from England and Ireland to Van Diemen's Land, there was
no visible or material reduction in the price of labour; and as
the convicts that were most fitted by previous habit for
agricultural labour, have been distributed to the settlers
instead of being retained by the government, the advantage of
employing them has been more sensibly felt by the settlers:
although in this as well as in every other instance of labour
that is purely coercive, it is liable to be, affected by
circumstances that cannot be the subject of calculation.</p>
<p>Amongst these may be specially noticed the temper of the
master, and his means of affording a liberal allowance of animal
food to his convict servants. In this last respect I observed a
superiority of the settlers in Van Diemen's Land over those of
New South Wales, arising from circumstances that were very much
of a local nature. The means of punishing their convict servants
were not so immediately attained; but in the latter, the means of
subsistence were more limited and precarious.</p>
<p>The price of mechanical labour in Van Diemen's Land was,
however, very high in the year 1820; and, with the high price of
iron, constituted a great deduction from the profits of
agriculture, and a serious impediment to the construction of
buildings.</p>
<p>The breed of cattle prevalent in Van Diemen's Land is derived
from an admixture of the Bengal and English breeds. Stock from
the government herds both at Hobart Town and at Port Dalrymple
has been lent, or sold upon credit, to individuals; and at both
places I observed, that the cattle of which those herds were
composed, were very inferior in shape and size to the stock of
individuals; and had suffered much from the selection that had
been made of them by settlers in distribution, as well as by the
imperfect performance of the agreement to return cattle of good
quality and condition. The superintendent of stock at Port
Dalrymple was convinced that clandestine exchanges had been made
in the government herd at that place, and that they had greatly
suffered from depredation.</p>
<p>The ordinary weight of the cattle in Van Diemen's Land, at
three years old, is about 470 pounds: they are much used for
draught, and all agricultural purposes, the price of horses being
yet high, and the breed partaking of the same qualities and
defects as those in New South Wales. The number of horned cattle
in both the settlements of Van Diemen's Land, returned at the
muster of the year 1820, amounted to 28,838.</p>
<p>The breed of sheep now prevailing there, was derived from a
flock imported by Colonel Paterson from New South Wales. These
sheep were of the Teeswater breed, and have since received a
slight ad fixture with the sheep of the Leicester breed, and with
a few that have been imported from Bengal: of the latter there
are few remaining, and the traces are nearly extinct. From the
access that the sheep of these settlements have had to new
pasturage, they have thriven rapidly, and as quickly increased in
number.</p>
<p>By the return of stock made at the muster of 1818, the number
of sheep is stated to have amounted to 127,883. In 1819, it is
stated to have been 172,128; and by the return made at the muster
of the year 1820, the number at both settlements is stated to
have amounted to 182,468.</p>
<p>From the statement made by Mr. Deputy Commissary General Hull,
the returns given in at the annual musters, especially of the
number of ewes, are not to be depended upon. The general
embarrassments of the settlers, and their wish to swell the
amount of their property, as well as to entitle themselves to a
share of the supply required for the King's store, all operate in
giving a delusive character to these returns. The state of the
flocks, however, will in some measure account for the rapidity of
their increase: It is the custom to allow the sheep of all ages
and sexes to herd together in the same flock; and the lambs are
allowed to breed before they have attained the age of seven
months. Little improvement has taken place either in the size or
in the fleeces of the sheep of Van Diemen's Land, nor did it
appear likely to take place under the management of the present
proprietors, and as long as their attention was devoted to the
single object of supplying the stores with meat.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Sorell had for some time been impressed
with the necessity of making some effort to improve the value of
the wool; and after communicating with Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur upon
the best means of effecting it, Governor Macquarie sanctioned an
agreement, by which that gentleman delivered at Sydney 300 Iambs
of the improved Merino breed, in exchange for a certain quantity
of land in New South Wales. The lambs were embarked in a large
vessel that was destined for Van Diemen's Land, and every care
was taken for their security and preservation during the voyage.
In consequence however of their long detention at Sydney after
embarkation, on account of some private business of the captain,
and of the great number of lambs that were put on board, and
necessarily confined between the decks, 91 died on the passage,
209 were landed, and of these 24 died soon afterwards.</p>
<p>A distribution of 181 lambs, valued at seven guineas each,
took place at Hobart Town in the month of September 1820, to the
individuals whom Lieutenant-Governor Sorell considered most
capable of giving attention to the improvement of their flocks;
and the number appropriated to each individual was also regulated
by him, on due consideration of the applications that were made
to him, and the characters of the applicants. Securities were
likewise taken from each person for the repayment or the value of
the lambs thus distributed, and amounting to 1,330<i>l</i>.
7<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. If the settlers, to whom these sheep have
been distributed, should ever be convinced of the necessity of
attending to the separation of their flocks, and will be content
with the certainty of a distant profit in the sale of their wool,
rather than in the risk of a present profit in the supply of meat
to the King's store, there is no reason to doubt that the climate
of Van Diemen's Land will be found as favourable to the
production of fine wool as that of New South Wales, and that the
same improvement will take place in it. Greater expense may be
requisite in Van Diemen's Land in procuring shelter for the
Merino flocks during the winter; but to counterbalance that
disadvantage the cost of transport of the wool will be legs
expensive and difficult.</p>
<p>With the rapid augmentation that has taken place in the
increase both of grain and animal food in Van Diemen's Land, the
difficulty has increased of preserving a due proportion to each
settler of the supply of meat and wheat to the King's store. The
tender lists of meat, both for the county of Buckinghamshire and
Cornwall, have been regularly submitted to the inspection and
control of the lieutenant-governor, who has frequently exercised
his own discretion in erasing names or in correcting the
quantities tendered; and although it appears that Mr. Deputy
Assistant Commissary General Hull, acting in obedience to the
orders of the head of his department, had, officially declined at
one period to submit to the lieutenant-governor the tender list
for the supplies of wheat, yet orders were subsequently
transmitted for his regular observance of that very salutary
practice. I remarked also, that considerable discretion was
exercised by this officer on these points; and that, with a
commendable view of facilitating the re-payment of former
advances made to settlers of wheat, or of implements of
husbandry, he gave a preference to those who were so indebted;
receiving the amount of one-half of their debt, and admitting the
other half on their own account. He also exercised a discretion
in admitting or excluding individual settlers, whose characters
were notorious for excess or immorality; and was constantly in
the habit of making reference to the muster lists, to ascertain
whether the quantity tendered bore a due proportion to the
quantity of stock, or land in cultivation; or whether the party
tendering had only made a temporary purchase for the sake of
obtaining a turn, to which the real proprietor was conscious that
he either possessed no claim, or had done something to forfeit
it. Independent of the admission of the supplies that are
tendered and made public when approved, a still wider discretion
is vested in the commissariat officer, in giving turns to
individuals when others have failed to comply with their
engagements. At certain periods of the year, both in Van Diemen's
Land and New South Wales, when the pasturage is plentiful, and
the stock is in good condition, there is no backwardness in want
of punctuality in the suppliers; but in the winter, or, after a
series of heavy droughts, or even on the occurrence of casual
disappointments, if the requisite supplies are not furnished,
those who voluntarily come forward to assist the store in a
season of scarcity are considered to have a claim upon the return
of more favourable periods. Upon sudden emergencies, likewise,
individuals who have a command of grain or stock are applied to
and indulged with turns, which from not being noticed in the
Gazette, and being withdrawn from public notice, do not fail to
attract and excite a good deal of observation. It was admitted by
Mr. Hull, the officer in charge of the commissariat department at
Hobart Town, that he considered such casual admissions to the
supply of the King's store to constitute part of the fair
patronage of his office. It is not, therefore, surprising that
causes of disappointment, and complaints of undue preference,
should be as frequent at Van Diemen's Land as in New South Wales;
but as the tender-lists in both places were made public, and as
an opportunity, at least, was afforded of fixing blame upon the
individuals in whose hands this large discretion is vested, I
feel it my duty to state, that one instance only was brought to
my notice in which I could feel justified in stating that
improper motives had appeared to guide it.</p>
<p>In inquiring from Lieutenant-Governor Sorell the reasons that
had influenced him in giving his sanction to the admission of
considerable quantities of wheat, that I observed had been
received from two merchants at Hobart Town in the year 1818, I
found that towards the end of the season few tenders of grain are
made to the King's store from settlers; but that as it is found
to have in payment, or otherwise, into the hands of the merchants
or retail dealers of the town, it has been customary to receive
it from them in larger quantities than from the settlers. This?
arrangement is not without advantage to the latter; for if the
merchants were excluded at a later period from all advantage of
the store, the former would be made to feel the re-action in a
greater degree than they now feel the transfer of the advantage
to the merchant. Within the last five years there has been no
variation in the store-price of wheat, or meat, in Van Diemen's
Land, although considerable variation has taken place in the
market, or rather in the export price. The price given at the
store for meat has been 5<i>d</i>. per pound for fresh, and
6<i>d</i>. for salted meat, and 10<i>s</i>. per bushel for
wheat.</p>
<p>The sale of the agricultural produce of Van Diemen's Land has
not of late, however, been confined to the King's store at Hobart
Town and Port Dalrymple; considerable quantities both of wheat
and salted meat having been exported to Sydney, both on account
of government and individuals. From want of due attention to the
curing and packing of the meat, and the want of proper casks, the
reputation of this important article of export has been
considerably diminished; but I was satisfied, from an experiment
that was made at my request in the commissariat department at
Hobart Town, that the process of curing meat may be perfectly
well carried on and completed there, and with the use of salt
that is found and procured in the lakes in the interior of the
island.</p>
<p>The embarrassment of the settlers in Van Diemen's Land, and
their dependence upon their creditors (who are generally the
merchants in Hobart Town) is certainly not less than that which
prevails in New South Wales. I do not believe, however, that the
excessive use of spirituous liquors is so general in the country
districts; and the condition of the settlers, and their habits of
life, seem to be more orderly.</p>
<p>The mode of cultivation pursued is, upon the whole, inferior
to that of New South Wales; and there are no individuals of any
class that have shown a disposition, or have possessed the means,
of commencing and continuing any system of improvement. There was
only one individual in Hobart Town, or the neighbourhood, that in
1820 seemed sensible of the advantages of a dairy-farm, or had
profited by the great price that its produce bore. Amongst those
settlers that had arrived from England, and as late as the month
of May 1820, it was stated by Mr. Evans the deputy surveyor, and
fully confirmed by my own observation, that there was only one
individual that had manifested a disposition to cultivate his
grant of land, and his efforts did not appear to me to be
successful. At Port Dalrymple there are four individuals who
possess considerable quantities of stock, and of these Mr. Cox,
jun. is making some attempts to improve both his land and the
quality of his wool.</p>
<p>In the year 1820 the number of convicts transported to Van
Diemen's Land seemed to be exceeding the demand made for them by
the settlers. Since that period, and in the month of January
1821, I was informed by Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, that the
accession to the population since the muster of 1819 had been
fill 1,600; and of these a great proportion were free persons of
respectable character, and possessing capital. It is probable,
therefore, that increase of cultivation has been very
considerable; and I have reason to believe that the consumption
of animal food in the settlement, and the demand for it in New
South Wales, has fully equalled the present means of supply.</p>
<p>The great and positive evil in Van Diemen's Land, and the
great impediment to its agricultural prosperity, is the system of
depredation committed on the flocks of sheep in the interior. The
establishment of a system of inspection previous to the
slaughtering the sheep and cattle for the use of the store has
certainly done much towards putting down the connivance that
formerly existed between the actual depredators of the sheep, and
those who received them. The present system of depredation
consists in driving flocks of sheep, amounting to 2 or 300, into
remote places during the night; and killing and salting down
portions of them for use, or waiting for a favourable moment to
transfer and incorporate them with other flocks. The
establishment of a criminal jurisdiction in the colony, and an
augmentation, of the number of magistrates in the country
districts, will be found the most efficient remedy for these
frequent outrages.</p>
<p>The numerous arrivals of new settlers and persons emigrating
from England in the year 1820, induced Lieutenant-Governor Sorell
to enter upon an examination of the tracts of land upon which
they could most advantageously be placed.</p>
<p>Until this period, a very small portion only of the Island was
known, or had been examined, with a view to colonization; and the
only tracts that had been visited were those that offered
convenient and temporary pasturage for casual occupiers. The
plains that lie between the river Derwent and the river Tamar,
are not generally favourable to cultivation. The soil is light
and poor, and their distance from any market will much retard any
attempt to fix a population in them. The plains and vallies that
are watered by the Jordan form exceptions to these remarks, and
had already begun to attract settlers.</p>
<p>Desirous of obtaining more accurate information upon these
points, Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, accompanied by the deputy
surveyor of Van Diemen's Land, proceeded to examine the country
that lies between the Cross Marsh and two rivers, now named the
Shannon and the Clyde, that fall into the Derwent, about
thirty-six miles above Hobart Town. These streams are more rapid
than the Jordan, and do not, like that river, cease to flow in
the summer.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Sorell describes the scenery upon the
river Shannon as grand and picturesque; and he found between the
line of road that he quitted, at the Cross Marsh, to the banks of
the river, several tracts of good grazing land, and numerous
vallies, containing a fine black soil, and bearing a luxuriant
grass, intersected by short ridges of moderate hills. The extent
of the land seen in this tract was estimated by Mr. Evans at
40,000 acres. In returning upon a line parallel to the river
Clyde, the lieutenant-governor found that his passage along the
left bank of that river was interrupted by a ridge of stony and
rocky hills, which come from the direction of Macquarie Plains, a
tract of land that has been for some time known and used in
grazing. These hills terminate abruptly on the bank of the
Shannon. Between this river and the Clyde, and near to their
point of junction with the Derwent, the lieutenant-governor found
some very fine plains, which he described as forming a beautiful
tract of country, consisting of elevated plains or downs, all of
tine rich soil, free from timber. He concludes that there must be
nearly 40,000 acres of this sort of land, in a square of eight
miles, bounded on three sides by the rivers Derwent, Shannon, and
Clyde. The distance of this tract from water-carriage will be
from twenty-five to thirty miles; and from Hobart Town about
forty-five. It is in this tract of country that the settlers who
have lately emigrated to Van Diemen's Land will be most probably
stationed.</p>
<p>Nearly about the same period the lieutenant-governor
dispatched some individuals for the purpose of examining the
country between the road to Port Dalrymple and the eastern coast,
especially that part of it that is called Swan Port. From the
report of these persons, the lieutenant-governor has collected
that there is a considerable tract of country at the north end of
Great Swan Port, and that it is well watered. The harbours or
inlets were only calculated for boats, but good anchorage for
large vessels has long been found in Oyster Bay; a position well
sheltered, and capable of serving as a dep&ocirc;t for any
produce collected upon the eastern shores of Van Diemen's Land.
Farther to the north of Swan Port, a tract of land has been
discovered, which, by all concurrent accounts, is one of the
largest and most extensive in the island. It is as far as is now
known, only accessible on one point, namely, a station on the
road to Port Dalrymple, known by the name of Humphrey's Water
Holes. This tract of country, now named the Break-of-Day Plains,
seems to be inclosed by a high tier of mountains that separate it
from the sea coast, as well as from the plains through which the
road lasses to Port Dalrymple. It is from this lofty tier of
hills that the river South Esk takes its rise, and receives in
its course several other streams. The discovery of this tract
will afford an important addition to the northern settlements of
Van Diemen's Land, which Lieutenant-Governor Sorell now admits to
contain more fertile and more valuable tracts than those of the
south.</p>
<p>It is in the vicinity of the lofty ranges of hills that bound
the extensive plains of this side of the island that the best
supply of water will be found; and if the means of exporting the
produce by Swan Port, or any station on the eastern coast, should
be discovered, the difficulties that have attended the export by
Port Dalrymple will altogether be avoided.</p>
<p>Previous to my departure from Van Diemen's Land I had
recommended to the lieutenant-governor the examination of this
tract of country; and with a view to facilitate communications
between Port Dalrymple and Hobart Town, to place stations at easy
distances from each other, for the temporary accommodation of
travellers, or for the reception of soldiers, or officers of the
police, in their expeditions in search of bush-rangers. With this
request the lieutenant-governor felt every disposition to comply;
and although he seemed to be impressed with an opinion that the
southern part of the island was more likely to be the seat of
commerce than that of the north, I have no doubt of his readiness
to give support to any measures of improvement by which the
agriculture or resources of the northern and eastern portions of
the island might be called into action.</p>
<p>The nature of the improvements that I should recommend are, in
the first place, an accurate examination of the eastern and
northern coasts of Van Diemen's Land, from Port Dalrymple
eastwards, and as far as Swan Port; and I should further
recommend that a communication between York and Westmoreland
Plains with that coast, should be opened, and if assistance
should be required in the first operations, that it should be
afforded by the local government, in the shape of convict-labour
and superintendence.</p>
<p>The result of the measure that the lieutenant-governor had
himself adopted and carried into effect, for the improvement of
the wool of Van Diemen's Land, can hardly yet be ascertained; I
will only therefore observe, that the establishments of the
public herds, that have existed both in that country and in New
South Wales, have long afforded opportunities of maintaining, in
its purity, the race of Merino sheep, and of affording the means
of distributing them afterwards to the settlers.</p>
<p>In New South Wales this benefit has been secured to the colony
by the intelligence and assiduity of Mr. J. M&lsquo;Arthur; but
if upon further consideration it shall be found expedient to
continue the government herds in the settled districts of New
South Wales, or in the centre of Van Diemen's Land (to which last
position they were removed by my recommendation) the advantages
of distributing sheep of the pure Merino breed to the settlers on
their arrival, or locations in either colony, may still be
secured. I would also here take an opportunity of observing that
a valuable and easy addition may be made to the flocks of the
government establishments, by sending out in each convict-ship
from England a certain number of sheep selected from the purest
Merino flocks, and not exceeding four in number for each ship.
With reference also to the breed of horses in both colonies, and
their existing defects, it would be equally expedient to send by
the same opportunity that the convict-ships afford, a stallion
colt of one of the heavier breeds of English horses.</p>
<p>With respect to the improvement of the market for grain in
either settlement, I have already, stated that the permission to
use it in the colonial distilleries will, for some time at least,
afford a demand that will be independent of the difficulties that
are inseparable from the competition for the supply of the public
store.</p>
<p>Whenever the recommendations that I have had the honour to
make for the separate establishments of the convicts to the
northward of the settled districts are earned into effect, and
the convicts are strictly and constantly employed there in the
production of food for their own support, the purchases of grain
on account of government will be materially reduced. That great
benefits have arisen to the colony by the liberal remuneration
that government has hitherto given for the supplies of grain
cannot be denied. Whatever may have been the difficulties that
have been experienced in an impartial adjustment of the
quantities that each person was allowed to supply, the advantages
both in the price and the mode of payment, have been greater than
those that any settler could obtain in his trail with the
merchants, and dealers, or with the ordinary purchasers in the
markets. It has been frequently stated by the officers of the
Commissariat Department, that the supplies might have been
procured at a much lower rate by government, by simply resorting
to the ordinary mode of purchasing by contract. It has been the
opinion of Governor Macquarie, supported by that of many other
individuals, that as long as the permission to distil spirit from
grain was withheld, the supply of it, as well as of meat, should
be kept as free as possible from the influence of any one, or set
of Individuals, who by the extensive command over grain that the
contract would afford, might be able to profit by the
embarrassments of the settlers, and obtain their produce from
them upon terms yet more disadvantageous than those by which the
ordinary purchases between the settlers and the merchants are now
conducted. A contract for the supply of the whole quantity of
grain that is at present required by government for all the
stores, would probably exceed the pecuniary competence of any one
individual in either colony, and I agree in the opinion that has
long been held upon the advantage of excluding the influence of
one or more individuals from the disposal of so large a portion
of the produce of the lower classes of settlers as the demand of
government requires.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Sorell was of opinion, in the end of the
year 1820, that a further period of two years must elapse before
resort could be made to the purchases of wheat or meat by
contract; that the earlier adoption of that system would be
eminently detrimental; and in the absence of any competition
would expose the lower class of settlers in Van Diemen's Land to
the necessity of disposing of their produce upon any terms to the
contractors. Since, however, competition is now opened by the
demand for grain in the colonial distilleries, it has appeared to
me that a portion of the grain required for the use of government
might be obtained by contract, without giving rise to the
inconvenience and embarrassments that have hitherto been so
strongly urged against its adoption; the detailed means of
carrying this recommendation into effect, by dividing the
contracts, I reserve for further consideration under another
subject of inquiry; but I would beg leave to notice in this place
the expediency of affording assistance in the conservation of
grain in New South Wales, that will be equally advantageous,
whatever the determination may be respecting the resort to
purchases by contract, or by the continuance of the present
system. The want of proper receptacles for grain in New South
Wales has already been noticed. It has forced the produce from
the poor settlers at the first opening of the stores, and filled
the latter with larger quantities of grain than it was always
prudent to keep in them. By proper exertion, and by the
application of manual labour in turning the wheat, Mr. Fitzgerald
was enabled to preserve it at Windsor from destruction by the
weevil; but neither the stores at that station, nor at Paramatta,
were capable of receiving the quantities of wheat that had lately
become necessary for the ordinary demand of government; they had
been either built or purchased when that demand was very small
compared with its present extent; and they had received no
subsequent improvement or enlargement. It was for this reason,
that, amongst the works that previous to leaving the colony I
recommended to Governor Macquarie to undertake, I suggested, in
point of priority, additional stores or granaries at Windsor,
Paramatta and Liverpool. These buildings, I consider, would be
important to the colony, either under an increased demand for
grain for the purposes of distillation, or in case it should be
deemed expedient to support the convicts in future from grain
purchased from the settlers, rather than with that which may be
raised by their own labour.</p>
<p>Experience has proved that in Van Diemen's Land the
preservation of grain may be most easily effected, and I think
that it is already manifest that it will be from that colony the
most abundant supplies of grain will in future be drawn for the
purposes either of consumption or distillation in New South
Wales, while the supplies of maize, valuable as I have already
stated them to be for both those purposes, will be exclusively
confined to the latter colony.</p>
<p>In this point of view the construction of public granaries at
Hobart Town or Port Dalrymple cannot fail to afford relief to the
inhabitants of those settlements, by extending their means of
deposit until the market is favourable to them, and by preventing
those hasty bargains, by which the labour of a year is frequently
sacrificed for the gratifications of a week.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to ascertain the result of the
efforts of the individual to whom I have already adverted in my
former report, towards the establishment of a brewery at Hobart
Town. Whenever the cultivation and growth of barley shall have
been extended in Van Diemen's Land by a better system of
agriculture than that which has hitherto prevailed there, little
doubt will remain of the success of the breweries, or of their
superiority to those in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The advantages of a cooler temperature during the prom; of
malting as well as brewing, will give a preference to that colony
for such undertakings; and I conceive it is hardly necessary to
insist more at length upon the benefits to be derived from the
creation of a new demand for the produce of the land in either
colony by the supply of a wholesome and nutritious beverage. Hops
have been grown in both colonies, but more extensively in New
South Wales than Van Diemen's Land, and the consumption of the
beer brewed at Sydney from maize and sugar by several individuals
is already considerable, and would be increased if the materials
were of a better quality. Any encouragement, therefore, that can
be given to these establishments, or to the improvement of the
quality of the beer that they brew, will be beneficially felt by
the community in the gradual substitution of that beverage for
the destructive and pernicious spirit that is now imported from
Bengal. It was with this view that an order issued by Governor
Macquarie in January 1816, by which licenses for the sale of beer
were restricted to those persons only who should sell spirits,
was repealed by an order issued on the 26th May of the same year.
The duty on beer licenses was fixed at 5<i>l</i>. and they are
now granted indiscriminately to those who sell beer only, or to
persons who may choose to sell beer and spirits in the same
house.</p>

<h3><i>Regulations respecting Grants of Land and Allotments in
the Towns.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> number of acres of land in New South Wales,
the grants of which have been regularly pawed, entered, and
registered in the office of the colonial secretary; amount to
324,251, and in Van Diemen's Land to 57,423.</p>
<p>These grants, as well as the names of the grantees, appear in
the nominal lists returned by Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans.</p>
<p>The maps prepared by these gentlemen of the settled districts
in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land exhibit the several
grants of land that have been made, and are now occupied there;
and they are also accompanied with references to the nominal
lists of the original grantees. By the commissions that have been
given to the several governors of New South Wales, they have had
the power to agree for the sale of lands, and to grant them upon
such terms, and upon such moderate quit-rents, services and
acknowledgments, as should be reserved according to instructions
given under the King's sign manual.</p>
<p>The instructions given upon this subject to Governor Macquarie
direct, that whenever the governor shall have thought fit to
exercise the power of emancipating and discharging from servitude
any of the convicts under his superintendence, who should from
their good conduct, and a disposition to industry, be deserving
of favour, in every such case he should issue his warrant to the
surveyor of lands to make surveys of, and mark out in lots, such
lands as may be necessary for their use; and afterwards he should
pass grants to the convicts so emancipated, in the proportion of
thirty acres to every unmarried male convict, and fifty acres to
every one that was married, and for every child who might be with
them at the time of making the grants, a quantity often acres,
free of all taxes and quit-rent for the space of ten years. To
these grants, a condition of residence on the pant, and
cultivation and improvement was annexed, with a reservation to
the king of such timber either then growing, and that might
hereafter grow, and that should be fit for naval purposes, and an
annual quit-rent of sixpence for every thirty acres, after the
expiration of the term of ten years.</p>
<p>It was His Majesty's further pleasure, that as convicts after
their emancipation might not have the means of cultivation
without the public aid, assistance, in the shape of subsistence
for themselves and families, together with an assortment of tools
and utensils, a proportion of seed, grain, cattle, sheep and
hogs, should be afforded them, until they might be reasonably
expected by their joint labour to provide for themselves.</p>
<p>The governor was further instructed, in case of application
for land from others of the King's subjects, either resident in
New South Wales, or proceeding from Great Britain and other parts
of His dominions, to afford them every encouragement that could
be given, without subjecting the public to expense. The amount of
these grants was not to exceed one hundred acres, over and above
the quantity granted to emancipated convicts. They were to be
free of quit-rent for the space of ten years, and after that time
to be liable to an annual quit-rent of 1<i>s</i>. for every fifty
acres.</p>
<p>In both cases of emancipated convicts, or meritorious
settlers, the governor had a power to enlarge the grant at his
discretion, subject always to the approbation of one of the
principal secretaries of state.</p>
<p>It is under these and similar instructions and powers given to
other governors, that the lands in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land have been granted, and are now held.</p>
<p>I found some difficulty in obtaining any correct statement of
the quantity of land that had been granted to each of the classes
of settlers, or that is now held by them.</p>
<p>Having observed at the first muster that I attended soon after
my arrival in the year 1819, that although the condition of each
settler was taken down by the clerk, yet that it was in no wise
connected with the possession of property or stock; and that a
statement of these last particulars was collected by the officers
of the commissariat department. I submitted to Governor Macquarie
at the approach of the muster of the year 1820, a plan for taking
it that had been prepared by Mr. Oxley, The particulars of this
plan will be detailed hereafter; but as they appeared to Governor
Macquarie to be too complicated for early adoption by the
magistrates, who, it was proposed should take the musters in the
districts, I was muter the necessity of collecting such
particulars of the present possession of land in New South Wales
as I could obtain through the assistance of the magistrates, who
in pursuance of an order of the governor proceeded to take the
musters of 1820. At my request, the quantity of land purchased by
or granted to convicts absolutely or conditionally pardoned, as
well as to those whose terms had expired, or to those who held
tickets of leave, was separately taken down by the magistrates at
each muster; distinguishing also the quantity of land granted,
and the quantity that had been purchased. The form in which these
returns was directed to be made was forwarded to the magistrates,
but that which had been sent to Windsor having been lost, Mr.
Cox, the magistrate of that district, in his endeavour to make
his return as full as possible, has made an unintentional error
in the calculations of the total quantity of land held in the
Windsor District; inasmuch as that quantity appears to be less by
2,691 acres than the quantity returned as purchased or granted.
With this exception, and the omission of the land granted to two
individuals of this class alluded to in my former Report, I have
reason to believe that these returns are correct. The total
quantity of land that I now find to have been held by them
amounted, according to the returns transmitted to Inc by the
magistrates, to 83,502 acres. The adoption of an abstract that
had been hastily made from these returns, before the whole had
been completed, I find has occasioned a mistake in my former
Report, wherein I have stated that the amount of the land SO held
was 22,238 acres by the class of remitted convicts; and 48,906 by
convicts whose sentences had expired, amounting together to
71,144 acres.</p>
<p>Of the quantity of land held by these classes in New South
Wales, and amounting to 83,502 acres, I now find that 54,693 are
held by persons whose sentences had expired; 8,585 acres are held
by persons who have received free pardons; 19,459 acres are held
by persons who have received conditional pardons; and 765 acres
by persons who hold tickets of leave.</p>
<p>Of the proportion of land so held, 35,309 acres are returned
by the magistrates as held by grant; and 50,884 acres as held by
purchase; but as this gives an excess of 2,691 acres beyond the
total amount of the land held by these classes of the
inhabitants, it is attributable to the error I have already
noticed in the return made to me from the Windsor District.
Taking, however, the total amount to be 83,502 acres, it
constitutes the proportion of land that is held by these classes
of the inhabitants, compared with the total amount of land held
in the colony by <i>all</i> classes, and which by the muster of
1,820, is stated to be 389,238 acres.</p>
<p>Of the respective quantities of land held by persons of the
same classes in Van Diemen's Land, I was not able to obtain an
account; and the musters transmitted to me by Lieutenant-Governor
Sorell do not afford means of making such a calculation.</p>
<p>The granting of land in the colony has been occasionally
suspended by Governor Macquarie, at different periods, partly
upon the principle upon which the suspension of remission of
sentence, or the indulgence of tickets of leave, has proceeded,
namely, the great number of grants that had been made in a
preceding year; and on two occasions it has proceeded from the
exhausted state of the public herds; and latterly, from the
scarcity of land in the settled districts.</p>
<p>A similar suspension has been adopted in the granting of land
in Van Diemen's Land, although it does not appear that the same
objections were applicable in that settlement. It has already
been observed, that applications for grants of land from
settlers, as well as persons who have been convicts were allowed
to be presented to the governor on only one day in the year.
Exceptions, however, were made to this rule, in favour of persons
arriving with orders of your Lordship for land, as well as of
persons who occasionally presented themselves; and such
applications appear to have been forwarded to the
surveyor-general in the form of supplemental lists.</p>
<p>Although the ordinary titles to grants of land in New South
Wales have been founded upon letters of recommendation from your
Lordship's office, and the expiration or remission of terms of
service of persons convicted and transported for crime, yet a few
instances have occurred, in which the Governor has felt justified
in bestowing grants of land on individuals who have arrived from
India, and who proved to him that they possessed capital, as well
as a real intention of settling permanently in the colony. He has
latterly, and, in my opinion, very justly, denied this indulgence
to military officers, or captains of trading vessels, who have
applied for grants of land, with an intention of again absenting
themselves and returning to reside.</p>
<p>By the evidence of the surveyor-general the names of
individuals to whom land is to be granted, as well as the lists
that contain the ordinary applications, are forwarded to him,
signed and approved by the governor; and the applicants have been
hitherto permitted to select their land in whatever part of the
colony they chose, within the district of the county of
Cumberland, subject to the reservations made by the Crown, as
well as to the rules for the appointment of River Front,
contained in the governor's instructions. It was the intention of
Governor Macquarie to extend the power of selection to the
newly-examined tracts that I have described in the counties of
Argyle and Camden; and I have no doubt that by this time large
portions of those districts have been granted and partially
occupied. The reservations hitherto made have consisted of the
tract called the Cow Pastures, in the disposal of which to
settlers or others, it was the intention of Governor Macquarie,
at my departure from the colony, to make no further change than
the allotment of 2,000 acres to Mr. John M&lsquo;Arthur, of a
portion of land contiguous to the grant that he already holds.
The remainder of that tract was occupied by the government herds
and the wild cattle.</p>
<p>The number of acres of land allotted to each individual is
placed against his name in the Governor's list; and the
surveyor-general, or his deputy, proceeds, after notice in the
gazette, to the different districts, to measure off the
quantities of land allotted.</p>
<p>The admeasurement and a description of the boundaries, is then
returned to the governor, who transmits them to his secretary, to
enable him to make out the grant; and after the colonial seal has
been affixed to it, it is registered in the secretary's office,
and the grant, upon payment of the fees, is delivered to the
grantee.</p>
<p>The quantity of land allotted to each individual and the
indulgences annexed to the grant, are circumstances entirely
within the discretion of the governor.</p>
<p>By orders received from your Lordship in the year 1817, the
allowance of the labour of convicts, subsisted and clothed at the
expense of the Crown, is was restricted to the term of six
months; and the practice of granting lands to civil and military
officers, pending their service in the colony, was discontinued,
with an understanding, that, upon their retirement, they might
receive grants of land in the same proportion, and upon the same
conditions as other settlers.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to remark, that the indulgences
that accompanied the grants of land to persons that had emerged
from a state of penal servitude, had been abused, as well as
those bestowed upon free settlers; and it is stated by the
surveyor general, that old settlers have not unfrequently
received new grants, and with them fresh indulgences.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry I have found that this has generally happened in
cases of distress or embarrassment of individuals. Latterly, the
repetition of such indulgences has been of more rare
occurrence.</p>
<p>A practice has for some time prevailed of allowing individuals
to consolidate, under one grant, several small allotments that
had been occupied by the first grantees, and sold by them before
they had been able to obtain the grant, or to comply with the
conditions of it.</p>
<p>This system is convenient to the large capitalists, and has
led to the accumulation of a considerable quantity of land in
their hands; but it affords an irresistible temptation to the
small settlers to abandon the cultivation of land, as well as to
abuse the indulgences that are bestowed by the Crown for the
express purpose of maintaining that cultivation. Some inducement
to this practice has undoubtedly arisen from the delay that is
admitted by the surveyor general himself to have taken place in
the survey and admeasurement of lands, that have been ordered to
be granted, as well as that which has taken place in making out
the grants in the secretary's office, and in the payment of fees
by the parties on the delivery. Much also is imputable to their
neglect in not attending at the appointed time of admeasurement,
and in not complying with the other formalities required.</p>
<p>Until your Lordship's authority was lately conveyed to the
lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land to grant allotments to
settlers on arrival, much inconvenience and expense was incurred
by them in proceeding to Sydney after they had made choice of
their land, or in waiting till the various formalities were
completed there. Permission was frequently given to them to
proceed to the cultivation of their land, upon the authority of
the lieutenant-governor; alone and the grantees of small
allotments did not scruple to avail themselves of it. In that
settlement, however, as well as in New South Wales, the business
of the surveying department had fallen into arrear, either on
account of the disproportion of the establishment to the increase
of business in it, or the frequent interruptions occasioned by
the long absences of Mr. Oxley, Mr. Meehan, and Mr. Evans, on
tours of discovery; and by the distances at which the operations
of admeasurement were to be executed. From whatever causes these
delays may have taken place, it is very important that they
should be removed, for they operate as pretexts, or temptations,
to a settler on his arrival, to remain in the towns, and consume,
in unprofitable leisure and inactivity, the resources that he may
have brought with hint, and that ought to be employed, without
delay, in the first operations on his land.</p>
<p>Another cause of delay in the admeasurement of land in Van
Diemen's Land, has proceeded from the detention of the grants at
Sydney, in the secretary's office, until the fees were paid.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Evans, that the grants that were sent from
Sydney to Van Diemen's Land in the year 1817, bore date in the
month of September 1813; and that he would have undertaken to
recover the fees from the parties, if the grants had been sent to
him. The same cause of delay, however, equally exists in New
South Wales, as advertisements of the names of persons to whom
grants of land have been made, and who have neglected to take
them out at the secretary's office, for a very long period, are
published in the Sydney Gazette; and notice is also added, that
unless they proceed to take them out within a given time the
grants will be cancelled.</p>
<p>The frequent violation that has taken place of the rule
prescribed by His Majesty's instructions, of not selling,
transferring, or alienating the land, until after the term of
five years, and the facility with which this violation has been
practised, has certainly had some effect in producing
indifference on the part of the grantees to the duty of
perfecting their own titles.</p>
<p>The condition of cultivating a certain proportion of land
granted in New South Wales has certainly not been strictly
observed; and it is the opinion of the surveyor-general, that it
never will be observed as long as the quantity of produce is
regulated solely by the wants of government. It is stated by this
officer, that no instance has yet taken place of any resumption
by the crown of land that had been granted, on account of the
breach of this condition. In the year 1814, a public notice was
issued by Governor Macquarie, in which it was declared, that "as
it had been ascertained that several persons who had obtained
locations of land, in the years 1809, 1810, and 1811, with a
promise that grants should be made to them, under the express
stipulation that they would proceed to clear and cultivate them,
had neglected to comply with those stipulations;" notice was
given, that such lands having reverted to the crown, were to be
located by the surveyor to other persons, rimming to the original
occupiers an indemnity for such expense as they had incurred in
felling timber, and the payment of which was to be made by the
new occupants. A claim appears to have been made, and was
attempted to be enforced upon a small portion of land at Windsor,
that was found to be inclosed within the allotment of an
individual, and under a belief that it belonged to the crown; but
the claim was upon better consideration abandoned, and the
individual has not since been disturbed in his possession.</p>
<p>Until a sufficient market was opened for the sale of the
produce of the land, or until the only addition of which it was
susceptible had been made, by the permission to distil spirits
from grain, the enforcement of the condition of cultivation would
neither have been expedient or just. Any indication therefore of
an attempt to cultivate has been regarded as coming within the
condition of the grant, and the construction put upon it has been
of the most liberal kind. I would here take an opportunity of
observing, that although the condition of cultivation is one that
ought constantly to be kept in view in the granting of lands, yet
such is the variety of soil in New South Wales, and the
impossibility or obvious utility of bringing some parts of it
into cultivation, on account of their natural sterility, or the
quantity of heavy timber with which they are encumbered, that the
literal and sometimes partial enforcement of the condition, must
operate as an expulsion of the proprietor.</p>
<p>Settlers, on their arrival in the colony, are easily deceived
by the account that they receive of the disposable land, and
frequently in the appearance that it wears in its natural state
on the first inspection. Acting upon these impressions, they
accept their grant, and employ their capital, or enter into
engagements on the expectation of profits, which they find it
afterwards impossible to realize. In such cases, relief from the
operation of the condition may be justly afforded. On the other
hand, it is equally necessary that the statements that are made
by settlers of the capital that they bring with them should be
submitted to some more regular proof than has hitherto been
applied.</p>
<p>The capital that is usually brought to the colony by these
individuals consists of investments of goods that they have
considered as likely to be most acceptable or profitable in the
market. In many cases these investments have been made upon
credit, and the only interest that the emigrant possesses in them
is the contingent profit that he may make on the sale of the
goods in the colony.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie has frequently found himself placed in much
difficulty in the exercise of the discretion with which he is
invested of apportioning the grants of land to new settlers, and
the usual indulgences, according to the extent of their capital,
as well as in ascertaining its real nature and amount. Delusive
statements have been made to him upon this subject; but although
disappointments in obtaining land and indulgences, were likely to
have afforded grounds of complaint if there had been any real
foundation for them, none were submitted to me during my
residence in New South Wales upon this subject; and from this, as
well as other sources of information, I am enabled to state that
there has been no want of liberality on the part of Governor
Macquarie in the disposal of land to settlers on their arrival,
or in giving an equally liberal proportion of convict labour and
stock from the government herds. The only conditions that have
been imposed upon these last indulgences, were those of
proceeding to cultivate or reside upon the land that was
allotted, or a sufficient reason shown for dispensing with that
condition. In the case of convict settlers, these last conditions
have of late been invariably observed; and the indulgences have
been withheld until, and in some cases even after the cultivation
had begun.</p>
<p>The reservations that are directed to be made, by the King's
instructions, in the grants of land, consist of a quit-rent of
one shilling for every fifty acres, after the term of five years;
and of the timber fit for naval purposes, growing, or that may
hereafter grow; and to these have been lately added the
reservation of the right of making a road along the boundary
lines of each estate, which at a still later period has been
extended or rather altered into an unlimited right of making a
public road through any part of the estate, at any time, for the
public service.</p>
<p>The quit-rents upon land and allotments have not been
collected since the year 1809; and Mr. Meehan, who was appointed
to perform the duty, has alleged no other reason for the neglect
of it than want of time, and his engagement in the practical
operations of surveying and admeasurement. These I believe to
have always occupied a considerable portion of his time, and to
have been executed by him with precision and impartiality. He was
about to proceed in the collection of quit-rents at my departure
from the colony.</p>
<p>The reservation of timber fit for naval purposes has very
rarely been enforced, as those species of wood that are
applicable to such purposes in the settled districts of New South
Wales, have for some time been very scarce, the consumption
having been great, and the waste of them on the first
establishment of the colony very considerable. This reservation
has, notwithstanding, caused dissatisfaction in a few cases in
which it has been latterly enforced; and that by which the timber
that may hereafter grow upon the land is reserved, has greatly
increased that feeling. As it is of importance to afford every
encouragement to the growth of European and other woods more fit
for naval purposes than the common species of eucalyptus with
which the land of New South Wales abounds; and as the European
woods that have hitherto been tried, especially the oak, appear
to succeed extremely well, I feel it my duty to recommend that
from all future grants of land this last reservation should be
withdrawn, and that it shall not have any retrospect, so as to
affect the few plantations that have already been made.</p>
<p>From a former communication, that was made by the
surveyor-general through Governor Macquarie to your Lordship, the
inexpediency of making the reservation of 500 acres to the crown,
between every 5,000 acres granted to settlers, was pointed out.
Governor King had in the year 1804 made very considerable grants
of land to the inhabitants of different districts in the county
of Cumberland, amounting altogether to 25,880 acres, principally
with a view of enabling the smaller settlers to keep cattle, and
provide manure for their small tenements; and especially those
who were disposed to inhabit the towns, or who had taken refuge
in the high lands of Windsor and Richmond from the inundations of
the river Hawkesbury. The names whom he intended to give a right
of common, of the occupiers of the farms, for and to whom he
intended to give a right of common, were entered on the back of
the grants.</p>
<p>As it appeared to Governor Macquarie to be desirable to obtain
a resumption of these tracts of land, for the purpose of giving
allotments to the great number of settlers that continued to
arrive in the year 1820, he consulted me upon that subject, and I
took an early opportunity of ascertaining whether the benefits
that had been contemplated by Governor King were still in
operation, and whether the inhabitants, or their successors, in
whose favour these commons had been granted, had any disposition
to renounce the benefits that had been attached to their lands.
Upon assembling at Windsor, those who had rights of common upon
two of the largest tracts, Richmond and Nelson Commons, they
declined acceding to the proposal that was made of relinquishing
them, on account of the injury that the loss of pasturage would
occasion to their sheep and cattle, of which it appeared that
great numbers grazed upon the commons. Under these circumstances,
I recommended Governor Macquarie to abstain from any interference
with the right of the commoners; and, for the same reasons, I
venture to recommend that these rights should be preserved. No
objection was made by the inhabitants present, and who had rights
upon the Richmond Common, to the appropriation of 400 acres of
land to be annexed, by way of glebe, to the church at Windsor,
and of the same quantity to that at Richmond, when a church
should be built. This proposition was made to them, as the
reservation required by the King's instructions in favour of
clergymen had not been made when the commons were granted by
Governor King; and no land remained in either of the districts
that could be appropriated to that purpose. The terms of the
grants by which these commons have been conveyed are very
defective: The grants declare, that the lands are given to three
trustees, and their successors, as resident trustees, chosen by
the settlers and other cultivators of the district (no district
having been previously named), and their choice to be recommended
or negatived by a bench of magistrates, and finally approved by
the governor. No provision was made for the failure of the legal
estate, from the non-agreement of the commoners in the choice of
trustees, or their non-approval by the governor; and there were
no words in the grant of inheritance or survivorship. The
intention of the grant, however, may be inferred from the words,
notwithstanding their want of technical accuracy; and as the
effect of the grants has been found beneficial to the
inhabitants, I should recommend that new grants of these commons
should be made to those who were then and are now comprised in
the terms of the original grants; namely, settlers and
cultivators, being free men, and holding land by grant under the
crown, or by lease, for more than seven years. As this
description will not literally include the subsequent purchasers
of such grants, it may be advisable to add that description in
the new grants, as it is clear that the intention of Governor
King was to provide the accommodation of pasturage and means of
feeding and rearing cattle to a certain description of
proprietors, occupying and cultivating a certain description of
land, or inhabiting a certain district. The reservation before
noticed, and the portions of land for the clergymen of Windsor
and Richmond, should also be respectively inserted in the grant
of the Richmond and Nelson Commons.</p>
<p>The quantity of land that has been reserved for the use of the
crown within the county of Cumberland consists of a tract at
Rooty Hill, near Paramatta, amounting to nearly 17,000 acres, and
the land at the Cow Pastures, estimated at not less than 25,000;
the establishment at Emu Plains, containing 3,000 acres; the
establishment at Longbottom, amounting to 400 acres; and that at
Grose Farm, amounting to 280 acres. To these is to be added the
land occupied at Bathurst by the government herds, calculated to
be above 20,000 acres.</p>
<p>I have already stated that the lands at Emu Plains, Grose Farm
and Long-bottom, are occupied by convicts; the other places
mentioned are appropriated to the depasturing and breeding of
cattle on account of government, from which drafts are
occasionally made for distribution to settlers, for the supply of
the government works, and also for the supply of the store on
occasions of the scarcity of meat, or reluctance in the settlers
to supply it.</p>
<p>An addition has lately been made to the grounds in which the
residence of the governor at Paramatta is situated, by the
purchase of some land front Mr. Wentworth; and at a little
distance in the district of Toongabbee, four miles from
Paramatta, there is a tract of land that was occupied and cleared
at the first establishment of the colony, that is either used as
pasturage for the governor's herd, or partially occupied by some
old settlers who had permission to continue upon a portion of the
cleared lands. Twelve thousand three hundred acres of land were
granted in the district of Cabramatta by Governor King to
trustees, for the use and benefit of the establishment of the
female orphans, and 150 acres at Paramatta, on part of which last
the school is built. The trustees of this school have a claim
upon government for 600 across, in exchange for the 280 they
surrendered at Grose Farm, to be taken in any other part of the
colony that they may select.</p>
<p>The reservations of land in favour of the clergy consist of a
grant of 400 acres of bad and middling land attached to the
church at Paramatta, 250 acres of very bad land attached to the
church of St. Philip at Sydney, and 1,000 acres to the church at
Castlereagh. No glebe land had been reserved or provided for the
church at Liverpool, nor for that of Windsor, or for the second
chaplain at Sydney; but it was the intention of Governor
Macquarie to provide allotments of land for them, and, at my
recommendation to incur the expense of clearing and fencing all
the glebes, upon an understanding with the present incumbents,
that after such an expense had been incurred, they would be held
liable to dilapidations on their removal.</p>
<p>Reservations of allotments in favour of schoolmasters in the
townships have been made at Paramatta, Richmond, Wilberforce,
Castlereagh and Pitt Town.</p>
<p>The reservation that has been adverted to of the right to make
roads for the public use through any part of granted lands, was
made by Governor Macquarie at the suggestion of Mr. Meehan, who
had found that little benefit accrued from the former mode of
reservation, by which the right was confined to the boundary line
of each estate. The reservation of this right is beneficial to
the public; but as the lines of the public roads, at the early
establishment of this colony, and even since that period, have
not in every instance been judiciously traced, it has been found
expedient, from time to time to make some alterations in them. In
performing this operation on the road from Paramatta to Windsor,
the new right of tracing it through any part of an estate was
exercised upon the property of an individual, on which the right
had been only reserved of carrying it along two lines of the
boundary, and it consequently exposed the proprietor to the
necessity of making an inconvenient division of his estate, and
to the expense of putting up fences on each side of the road. It
was admitted by the deputy-surveyor, that the individual in
question was entitled to compensation for the expense which he
had thus incurred, and that the right of making a road along the
boundary lines of an estate did not imply that of carrying it
through any portion that might be more convenient to the public.
At the present moment, the inconvenience to individuals of
changing the line of roads through their property is not very
seriously or generally felt; but as the settlers are beginning to
inclose their lands, without reference either to roads that have
already been made or used, or to those that the convenience of
the public may require in future, it is important that
opportunities should be afforded to the inhabitants of each
district to fix upon the line of roads that are now, or hereafter
may become, most important to them; and that, when they have been
submitted to the governor for approval, each person shall receive
a notice from the surveyor-general of the portion of his property
that will remain subject to such an appropriation. I should
propose that these opportunities may be most conveniently
afforded them, by convening meetings of the inhabitants of each
district, under the direction and presidency of the
surveyor-general, who should be directed to submit the result to
the governor. At a meeting of the magistrates that was held at
Sydney in the year 1818, the question of the repair of roads, and
the obligation to make and preserve fences, was much discussed;
and the magistrates were informed by Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde,
that there existed no authority by which the liability of the
inhabitants to repair public roads, such as exists by the common
law of England, could be enforced. Hitherto the public roads in
New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land have been all made and
repaired by the government, and the tolls have been received and
carried to the credit of the police-fund.</p>
<p>Trustees of the principal roads have been appointed by
Governor Macquarie, but it does not appear that their duties have
exceeded the letting of the tolls, and receiving the securities
for the payment of the rent. In the present state of the
population of the agricultural districts of New South Wales, and
their distance from a market, I conceive that this system has
been fairer in its operation than any assessment that could have
been made upon the inhabitants and occupiers of the intermediate
lands for the formation and repair of the roads, or upon the
application of the principle of English statute labour.</p>
<p>Latterly, the repairs that have been made upon the principal
roads have been effectual, but the expense has very much exceeded
the amount of the tolls received.</p>
<p>In the districts of Windsor and Richmond, where cross roads
and communications between the low and high lands are both
necessary and frequent, the expense of repair has been borne by
individual proprietors who were the most interested in effecting
it; but until the lines of communication in that as well as other
districts are fixed upon an equitable consideration of the public
convenience, it would be very expedient to declare that such
roads were to be repaired either by the government, or by the
contributions of individuals who may not in any manner be
benefited by them. When these roads are set out, and declared to
be of a public nature, it will then be desirable that the
governor should have authority to fix and levy a rate upon the
inhabitants of each district, for the expense of repairing and
maintaining the public roads respectively belonging to, and
passing through those districts; and that the funds collected
should be placed at the disposal of the commissioners, to be
chosen by the inhabitants under the obligation of presenting
their accounts at stated periods, duly vouched, to the governor.
I should recommend that the principle of the rate should be the
value of the land occupied by each person, and not its extent,
inasmuch as the great variations in the quality of the land in
New South Wales, might subject the proprietor of a large quantity
of bad land to an unequal and unjust proportion of the rate.</p>
<p>I examined two returns, one of which contained the number of
grants of land that have been made by the several governors of
the colony from the earliest period, and registered in the books
of the surveyor-general up to the 12th July 1820, distinguishing
the number of acres of which these grants were composed; and the
other contained a nominal return of lands granted by the several
governors during the same period, and exceeding 1,000 acres. The
most considerable grants appear to be those that were made to Mr.
John Blaxland by order of his Majesty's secretary of state,
amounting to 6,710 acres; and to Lieutenant Colonel O'Connel and
his wife, amounting to 4,555, made by Governor Macquarie in the
years 1810 and 1814. The grants made to Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth
amount altogether to 6,200 acres; but of these, 3,550 appear to
have been granted on the consolidation of grants purchased by Mr.
Wentworth, and of land exchanged by him with the government. I do
not find that the remaining grants, with the exception of that
which has already been mentioned of Mr. J. M&lsquo;Arthur, have
exceeded 3,000 acres; and have only reached that extent in four
cases, one of which occurred in Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The regulations for building in the town of Sydney were
promulgated by Governor Macquarie, by a public order, on the 18th
August 1810. Previous to that period very little attention had
been paid to the regular progress or admeasurement of the town
allotments, or even to the formation of the streets. Much
improvement was rendered necessary and has taken place within the
last seven years, both in the towns of Sydney and Paramatta, by
levelling and widening the streets and giving them regular and
convenient directions. In both of these towns it has teen found
necessary to purchase the interests claimed by individuals in the
houses that obstructed improvement, or projected beyond the
regular lines of the streets; and agreements have from time to
time been made with them for the surrender of their interests to
government. Upon applying to Mr. Meehan the deputy-surveyor, who
had always been employed by Governor Macquarie in making these
arrangements, I found that he had kept no account, and was unable
to do more than refer me to the payments that from time to time
had been made to the proprietors of allotments from the
police-fund, upon agreements negociated by himself and approved
by the governor. The most considerable of these took place in the
month of November 1815, when the sum of 1,190<i>l</i>.
11<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. was paid to sundry persons (not named) as
the amount of the valuation of houses belonging to them in Sydney
and Windsor.</p>
<p>The valuations are stated by Mr. Meehan to have been made by a
committee named by the governor, consisting of the superintendent
of carpenters, stonemasons and bricklayers, who made a report of
the materials that they found, and the value of the interest
possessed by the occupier, whether it consisted of a lease, or
only a title to a lease on fulfilment of a preceding promise.</p>
<p>It does not appear that any grants of allotments that had been
made on condition of building within a certain period, lime ever
been resumed by Governor Macquarie; but I believe that it was his
intention to adopt that measure, in consequence of the number of
allotments that remained without any attempt to build upon them,
after giving a sufficient notice to the parties to provide
against the forfeiture. The rule for building first adopted in
the town of Sydney was that of placing the houses twenty feet
from the footway of each street, and leaving sixty feet for the
breadth of the streets. The intervening spaces between the houses
and the footpath lire generally occupied by gardens in the upper
part of the town, and separated from the street by low palings.
This space, however, is liable to be taken for the improvement of
the streets, when required; and all projections that have been
made by buildings or otherwise are liable to be removed.</p>
<p>With a view to prevent improper encroachments upon these
lines, it was directed that no person should begin to construct a
house without obtaining the permission of the governor signified
through Mr. Meehan, who was then the acting surveyor. At the
period in which this rule was promulgated, it was customary for
the inhabitants to build in what situations and in what manner
they pleased, and some inconvenience and expense would have been
spared if the rule had been more rigidly enforced.</p>
<p>Permission having been given to Governor Macquarie to make
grants of allotments to individuals on condition of their
building houses upon them, allotments have been assigned with the
condition of constructing houses either of brick or stone, not
less than idly feet in depth, sixteen feet wide, and two stories
high, in the space of five years, paying an annual quit-rent that
is expressed in the grant, and a reserve being made to the crown
of the space of twenty feet in front of the house, in case it
should be required for widening the street. The amount of the
quit-rent reserved on grants in the towns does not exceed
15<i>l</i>. per annum, and in the towns of Windsor and Paramatta
does not exceed 9<i>l</i>. Permission is also given for
allotments in the town, generally consisting of forty feet in
front and twenty in depth; but if the parties engage to build to
a greater extent they receive land in proportion.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Meehan, that nearly four-fifths of the
houses in Paramatta and Sydney are permissive occupancies; and
that of these, about forty have remained vacant in Sydney, and
not less than twenty in Paramatta.</p>
<p>The proprietors of these allotments pay no quit-rent for them;
and they have in many instances been subdivided, and have been
the subject of sale and transfer, more especially when they have
been received in remuneration or in exchange for other
allotments. The governor's court, however, in a case that
occurred in the year 1818, where one of these allotments had been
assigned, after a lapse of three years would permit a plaintiff
to recover possession of the premises from a third person, upon
the ground of the uncertainty of the interest, that depended upon
the pleasure of the governor in giving or withholding a grant or
lease after the performance of a preceding condition.</p>
<p>By a return that was made from the surveyor-general's office,
it appears that 128 leases for fourteen or twenty-one years have
been granted by Governor Macquarie, and thirty-five grants of
allotments, on which good houses either of brick or stone have
been built, of which twenty-two are the property of and have been
erected by persons who were convicts.</p>
<p>During the period of Governor Macquarie's government, every
encouragement has been given to build good houses in the towns of
Sydney, Paramatta and Windsor; and in the first-mentioned of
these, there are nine houses the property of the public built of
stone, eighteen of brick, and four of wood; there are also
fifty-nine houses of stone, the property of individuals; 221 that
are built of brick, and 773 that are built of wood.</p>
<p>The largest portion of the stone and brick houses are the
property of the retail traders and public-house keepers, of whom
there are many that were formerly convicts.</p>
<p>The style of architecture of the houses in Sydney is gradually
improving under the direction and taste of Mr. Greenway the
colonial architect, and more attention has lately been paid to
the solidity of the construction, as well as to the selection of
materials. The town is also rapidly extending in the vicinity of
Hyde Park. The great obstruction to its improvement is the
irregular accumulation of houses that has gradually been formed
in that part of it that is called the Rocks this portion of the
town consists of a few narrow lanes and streets that have been
formed upon the edges and declivity of one of the projecting
ridges of sandstone rock that rise from the shores of Sydney Cove
and that of Cockle Bay, two inlets of the harbour of Port
Jackson. On the summit of this ridge are the remains of an old
and now dismantled fort that commanded the town, but was too much
elevated to protect the harbour; it is now encircled with stone
quarries, and below these rises a line of streets and lanes that
is frequently interrupted by large projecting masses of
sandstone. This part of the town has hitherto not received, and
indeed is not susceptible of much improvement; and it will
require both time and expense to give it regularity, and in some
places to render it accessible to carriages. As there is little
space now left upon the sides and shore of Sydney Cove for the
construction of commercial buildings, it is probable that the
shores of Cockle Bay, though more remote from the principal
streets of Sydney, will be resorted to for purposes of trade. The
anchorage for ships is good in this bay, but there are few places
in which they can approach the shore; and the construction of
quays will be expensive on account of the irregular line of the
shore, and the large masses of rock that lie upon its
surface.</p>
<p>The principal streets of Sydney have been lately levelled and
raised in the centre; and some attention has also been paid to
the drainage, which, from the natural declivity of the streets,
may be very easily extended to every part of the town.</p>
<p>In the towns of Paramatta, Windsor and Liverpool, greater
regularity has been observed in the first formation of the
streets, and in the lines of the houses. Their extent and
progress, compared with that of Sydney, has been inconsiderable.
In the former there are not more than six houses built of brick;
the remainder are built of wood or clay, and roofed with
shingles. In Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh and Liverpool, the
resident magistrates have had the power of granting allotments of
land for building; and in the town of Richmond some of the
proprietors of land on the river Hawkesbury have begun to build
small tenements, and from thence to superintend the cultivation
of their farms. A large reserve has been made in the centre of
the town for public purposes. A school-house and chapel have been
erected upon an adjoining allotment; and upon another, the lease
of which will expire in the course of the present year, it is
intended to build a residence for a clergyman. The township, or
rather the village, consists of seventy-nine allotments, upon
twenty-four of which houses are built.</p>
<p>The town of Windsor is of earlier date than the other towns,
but its progress has not been so quick as might have been
expected, considering that it has been the resort of the settlers
of a large and cultivated district, the dep&ocirc;t of its
produce, and the place of export of a portion of that produce by
water-carriage to Sydney. Considerable pains have been taken, and
some expense has been incurred, in levelling the descent to the
river, and making a quay for the embarkation and delivery of
grain; and facilities have likewise been afforded to the passage
of the river by the establishment of a good ferry-boat.</p>
<p>At the village of Castlereagh two houses only had been built,
although several allotments had been assigned; and in the town of
Liverpool sixty-six allotments have been assigned, on condition
that they should be fenced and cleared, and that a dwelling-house
should be built upon each.</p>
<p>There are two other townships in New South Wales, named Pitt
Town and Wilberforce. In both of these school-houses have been
built, and the resident chaplain at Windsor has done alternate
duty in them on Sundays.</p>
<p>The position of these townships has, under all circumstances,
been judiciously chosen. They are contiguous to the navigable
portions either of the river Nepean, George's River, or Paramatta
River; and although the transport of grain by water has much
diminished since the improvement of the roads, and never was very
popular on account of the frauds committal by those employed in
it, yet the advantages of water-carriage from Liverpool to Sydney
and to Botany Bay, into which George's River discharges itself,
cannot fail hereafter to be of importance to the agricultural
districts of Airds and upon the higher banks of the Nepean.</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land nearly the same, regulations have been
observed in the granting of land that have prevailed in New South
Wales; but in the year 1820 there were only three towns, viz.
Hobart Town, Launceston and George Town. The former is situated
upon a small cove of the great harbour or inlet into which the
river Derwent discharges itself, and at the base of the highest
mountain that has yet been examined in this settlement, or in
those of New South Wales. The mean height of the Table Mountain
was measured by Mr. Oxley in the month of March 1820, and was
found to be 3,936 feet. The town is placed upon the ridge and
slope of a hill that forms the base of the Table Mountain; and
the irregularity that at first began to prevail in the formation
of the streets has yielded to the attention and zeal with which
the directions of Governor Macquarie were put in action, at first
by Mr. Meehan, and afterwards by Mr. Deputy-Surveyor Evans.</p>
<p>A copious stream of fresh water flows through the town into
the harbour, and not only affords an ample supply to the
inhabitants, but turns three water-mills for grinding corn. The
elevation at which this stream takes its source is sufficient to
carry it to the level of any of the houses in Hobart Town,
excepting the military barracks. Several purchases of buildings
have been made to effect the improvements sanctioned by Governor
Macquarie in Hobart Town, amounting altogether to 1,528<i>l</i>.;
and the sum of 1,000<i>l</i>. was laid out in the purchase of a
farm and buildings at New Town, distant about two miles from
Hobart Town, for the accommodation of the
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>The buildings upon the farm were in good repair, and of some
extent; and the land, though not intrinsically good, formed a
valuable addition to the tract that is called the Government
Domain, and that now extends from Hobart Town along the bank of
the river Derwent to New Town.</p>
<p>The sum at which this farm and the buildings were valued
amounted to 1,300<i>l</i>; of this sum 1,000<i>l</i>. was paid in
money, and the seller received a grant of 500 acres of land to
make up the remainder.</p>
<p>The names of the parties to whom satisfaction was made for the
value of their houses or building's upon the allotments that were
resumed, is set forth in the account rendered by Mr. Evans; and
although this system of remuneration is equitable when applied to
the pre-existing system of assigning allotments in the towns, yet
it proves the importance of paying attention to the direction of
streets and the position of buildings, at the earliest formation
of any new settlement. Although many of these allotments had been
made by Lieutenant-Governor Collins, soon after the settlement
had been formed at Hobart Town, yet the only right that the
occupiers possessed or could claim in them, was the value of the
buildings and fences that they had erected upon them. With the
exception of three allotments purchased for the purpose of making
the residence of the clergyman at Hobart Town contiguous to the
church, it has not been found necessary to make any purchases or
resumption of land for public buildings in Hobart Town.</p>
<p>A portion of land that had been let on lease to Mr. Edward
Lord, fronting the harbour, and immediately adjoining the tract
belonging to the government, that is now used as pasturage for
the draught cattle, appeared to me to be very desirable for the
future improvement or defence of the town. A dwelling-house and
offices had been erected upon part of this allotment, which
consists of fourteen acres; and upon expiration of Mr. Lord's
lease, I should certainly recommend that any equitable interest
that he may possess in the premises should be purchased by the
government.</p>
<p>There were seven houses in Hobart Town in the month of March
1820, that were held under grant, and seven that were held under
leases for twenty-one years, paying an annual quit-rent of
30<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>Of these last there were only three in which the conditions
were fulfilled.</p>
<p>Of the houses in Hobart Town, one hundred and three were built
of brick; one of them consisting of three stories, twenty of two,
seventy-two of ground floors, and ten being outhouses and
stores.</p>
<p>These buildings have in general been slightly constructed, and
until the use of stone becomes more general, the construction of
houses in Hobart Town is not likely to be permanently
beneficial.</p>
<p>Here, as in Sydney, the permissive possession of an allotment,
with the condition of building a dwelling-house and fencing
performed, is considered equivalent to a lease or grant; and it
is also more beneficial, for although the person to whom the
allotment is assigned may be removed from it, if it be required
for government purposes, on payment of the value of the materials
of the house and the fences yet no quit-rent is demanded for such
an interest, and the possessors are always aware that upon
building a good house, according to the regulated dimension; they
are certain of obtaining a lease or grant according to the
expense they have incurred. A great many individuals in Hobart
Town were awaiting the arrival of Governor Macquarie in 1820, for
the purpose of soliciting these extensions of their titles, in
consideration of their having performed the conditions
required.</p>
<p>Permission is given to the convicts to occupy and build upon
the town allotments, the ordinary size of which is a quarter of
an acre. By degrees they increase the size of their dwellings,
which are at first constructed of wood, and then derive profit
front letting them as lodgings to other convicts.</p>
<p>No township, except that of Elizabeth Town, which contained
only two houses in 1820, had been appointed in Van Diemen's Land,
as late as the month of March 1820; nor had any reserve of land
been made, either at or near Hobart Town, for a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>One hundred acres had been purchased of Mr. Archer, in the
district of Pitt Water, for these as well as other public
purposes; and 400 acres of and had been assigned as glebe to the
resident chaplain of Hobart Town, in the district of Clarence
Plains.</p>
<p>It was the intention of Governor Macquarie to mark out
situations for townships in several districts on his visit to Van
Diemen's Land; and it certainly appeared that in the Pitt Water
district, as well as in a situation pointed out by Mr. Evans in
the district of Gloucester, the establishment of a township had
for some time been requisite.</p>
<p>At Launceston, the regularity of the streets hail been much
interrupted by permissions that had been given by the commandant
to sever id inhabitants to build without previous reference to
Governor Macquarie, or to Lieutenant-Governor Sorell.</p>
<p>It certainly appeared to me that the future importance of this
town had not been sufficiently impressed upon the mind of
Governor Macquarie, when he addressed his dispatch to the Earl of
Liverpool, dated the 17th November 1812, recommending the removal
of the settlement to George Town.</p>
<p>The objections stated by Governor Macquarie, on the authority
of the inhabitants, consist of the difficulty of obtaining fresh
water; the dangers of the navigation of the river Tamar, and the
distance of the town of Launceston from the sea.</p>
<p>This town is situated at the foot of a hill that commands the
junction of the two rivers North and South Esk, and at the edge
of a small tract of flat land that is subject to inundation in
the winter.</p>
<p>The town is not rendered unhealthy by this circumstance, and
the tract of land might very easily be drained and protected from
inundation.</p>
<p>The supply of water is obtained front the river named the
North Esk, at the distance of one mile and a Ralf from the town.
It is either brought down in boats (as the river is navigable
above the town for nearly eight miles) or in carts; and as no
wells have yet been sunk in the town or neighbourhood, some
expense and labour is necessary to obtain these supplies from the
part of the river in which the water may be obtained in purity,
and beyond the reach of the tide. The danger of the navigation of
the River Tamar, that is formed by the junction of the North and
South Esk Rivers, from Launceston to the sea, and the consequent
difficulty of exporting produce or importing merchandize, is
further alleged as an objection to the situation of
Launceston.</p>
<p>The navigation of the river undoubtedly exposes vessels of
more than 200 tons to danger, on account of the rapidity of the
stream in certain narrow channels, and in the centre of one of
which, called Whirlpool Reach, is a sunken rock, six feet below
low water. By the evidence of a pilot who had been upon the
station for eight years, it appears that no accident has ever
occurred in the course of this navigation; but he was of opinion
that no vessel of a greater burthen than 200 tons could approach
nearer Launceston with safety than fourteen miles. The experience
of nine years has proved that small vessels of 150 tons may
safely proceed and anchor opposite to that town; and considerable
quantities of produce have always been exported by these means to
Sydney. The superior advantages of George Town, the place to
which Governor Macquarie recommended that the principal
settlement should be removed, are by no means apparent. The
situation chosen for the town is a flat piece of sterile land,
lying upon the eastern shore of the river, and three miles from
the entrance. A small island in the middle of the river is
immediately opposite the site of the future town, and the channel
is deep and the current strong. At one extremity of the town is a
small cove, called York Cove, in which there is room for about
seven or eight vessels from 200 to 300 tons to anchor; but as the
bottom consists of loose sand, and as the anchors will not hold
against the strength of the current, the anchorage cannot be safe
until moorings are laid down.</p>
<p>Opposite to George Town, in a part of the river called
Kellsoll's Bay, there is better anchorage; but it is in Middle
Island Bay, three miles above George Town, that the best
anchorage is found even for the largest vessels, and in which
they may remain safe from the influence of the strong current of
the river.</p>
<p>As a harbour, therefore, York Cove possesses very limited
means of giving protection to shipping; and large vessels must
anchor either three miles above it, or on the other side of the
river in Kellsoll's Bay.</p>
<p>Another objection to George Town consists in the sterility of
the soil, and the difficulty of finding any tract in the
neighbourhood capable of affording sustenance to cattle.</p>
<p>Abundance of water has been found near the town, which, at the
period of my visit, contained only one house, that belonged to a
free person, unconnected with the establishment.</p>
<p>The supplies of grain are conveyed in boats from Launceston to
George Town by water, a distance of forty-seven miles; and
although a road or trace has been made from Launceston, that is
passable for cattle, yet they are found to suffer from want of
food in their passage, as well as at George Town, on their
arrival.</p>
<p>As the number of convicts employed on the buildings at George
Town is considerable, the largest supplies of meat and grain are
delivered there. This circumstance, however, has not induced
either settlers or merchants to transfer their residence to
George Town. At Launceston, on the contrary, rat disposition has
been manifested to make places of deposit for the grain of the
neighbouring districts; and dealers have established themselves
in the town, who receive consignments of goods from Sydney and
Hobart Town, which they exchange for wheat. From the
circumstances that I have stated, it appears to me that the
situation of Launceston is much more likely to attract a free
population than George Town, although the latter may afford a
convenient place for the residence of such officers as may be
necessary to protect the revenue, or to visit ships on their
departure from Launceston.</p>
<p>It is probable that, as the trade of this town increases, the
produce will be conveyed in barges from thence to the shipping
that may resort either to York Cove or to the anchorage above it;
and it is also to be expected that warehouses will be built at
George Town by the merchants who export it. If the commercial
advantages arising from the maritime situation of George Town
should eventually be such as Governor Macquarie has anticipated,
and that it will become a deposit for merchandize brought by
vessels that may touch in their passage through Bass's Straits,
thaw! advantages will of themselves present sufficient
inducements to attract a commercial population, and will give a
natural direction to the improvements of which the place itself
is susceptible. Viewing George Town as a place of resort for
colonial vessels, or as a place of temporary deposit for the
produce that might be conveyed from Launceston, I did not concur
in the expediency of continuing the works and buildings that had
been undertaken at George, Town. It appeared to me that a
sufficient number had been already constructed for all the
purposes that the place was intended to answer; and after
submitting these points to the consideration of the governor, I
solicited the appropriation of a portion of the labour of the
convicts employed at George Town, for the repair of the gaol at
Launceston, and a few other buildings that had fallen into decay.
Injunctions were also laid upon the commandant at George Town, to
pay more attention to the allotments of land in Launceston, and
to make reservation of a portion that is contiguous to the town,
and upon an eminence that commands it, as a favourable situation
for building a military barrack.</p>
<p>I have since understood that orders were given for the
construction of a gaol or place of confinement at Launceston.</p>
<p>The number of dwelling-houses in the town amounted to
seventy-eight; and out of twenty-two allotments that had been
assigned to individuals, twelve were fenced, and buildings
erected upon them.</p>
<p>Having thus detailed the existing regulations for the grants
of land, and of allotments in the different towns, I will proceed
to submit to your Lordship the measures of improvement of which I
conceive them to be susceptible.</p>
<p>In the first place, I should recommend that there should be an
entire separation of the offices for conducting the business of
the surveyor's department in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land; and that in future there should be a surveyor-general for
the latter settlement, who should be accountable to the governor
of New South Wales and the lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's
Land. Considering the great increase of business that has taken
place in both offices during the last two years, and the
probability of annual augmentation, the addition solicited by Mr.
Oxley of three assistants, is not more than the service
requires.</p>
<p>The establishment in the year 1819 consisted of the
surveyor-general and a deputy, and occasional assistance in the
office from convicts who happened to have any knowledge that
qualified them for its duties. Since the period of my departure
from the colony, I find that two assistants have been added to
the department, with salaries payable to each from the
police-fund amounting to 109<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>As it does not appear that any advantage has arisen from
conferring upon an assistant in the office a duty that is not
strictly within the control of the principal, I should recommend
that the office of surveyor of roads and bridges, as well as that
of collector of quit-rents, should, in the event of Mr. Meehan's
resignation, be suppressed; and as the last of these will
hereafter form a part of the colonial revenue, that it should be
transferred to the department of the colonial treasurer. The duty
of surveying roads, in case my recommendation be carried into
effect, will more properly belong to one of the commissioners of
districts appointed to superintend the application of the rates
levied for the repair of roads. As there will then be three
assistants in the office of surveyor-general, it may be expedient
to establish some difference in the amount of their salaries. For
the first assistant I should propose a salary of 250<i>l</i>. per
annum; for the second, a salary of 200<i>l</i>.; and for the
third assistant, a salary of 150<i>l</i>. Mr. Oxley has solicited
in favour of each of the assistants an allowance for a horse, but
as I consider that out of the four officers of which this
department will consist, two should be engaged in those duties
that are stationary, I would beg to submit, that the allowance
for horses should be limited to two of the assistants, and should
amount to 25<i>l</i>. per annum each. The establishment will then
consist of</p>

<p>making together an increase of 146<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. beyond the expenses of the establishment in the year
1821. These salaries should be considered as superseding all
allowances of convicts subsisted at the expense of the crown, or
of rations on the police stores. The fees that are now received
on grants by the surveyor-general, and that have been for some
time sanctioned by your Lordship, being very moderate in amount,
should be considered as exclusively appertaining to the
surveyor-general in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; but as
no fee is allowed in the schedule for permissive occupancies of
town allotments, which have been hitherto under the management of
a subordinate officer of the department, I conceive that when
they are restored to the superintendence and control of the
principal, a fee of 5<i>s</i>. upon each should be added to the
schedule, and be made payable to that officer.</p>
<p>With respect to the disposal of land to convicts on their
emancipation or expiration of sentence, I have already submitted
such observations to your Lordship in my former Report, as
appeared to me to be warranted by the effects of the system as
they are now exhibited in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.
It is my opinion, that persons of this class have very little
chance of success in the cultivation of the land of quality in
New South Wales, without the possession of some pecuniary means
to enable them to meet the heavy expenses of clearing and
bringing the land into such a state of cultivation as may render
it profitable without exhausting it. Independent of the amount of
capital that should be required from convicts proceeding to
cultivate a grant of fifty acres, as recommended in my former
Report, It should be an object to place this description of
settlers on the most fertile land, at very little distances from
each other, and as near as possible to a market. The immediate
vicinity therefore of townships or villages, is the best
calculated for this class of persons, as well as those to whom I
have before recommended that twenty acres of land should be
given. In the immediate neighbourhood also of such settlers, I am
induced to recommend that reserves of land for commons should be
made, not exceeding 2,000 acres in extent.</p>
<p>The reservation of land in favour of the clergy and the
schoolmasters of each district should be strictly and inviolably
observed; and as these persons possess only a life interest in
their glebe land, it has appeared to me that the intention of
making such a reservation a beneficial addition to their income,
could only be effected by clearing and fencing the land at the
expense of government, upon its appropriation to the first
incumbent. The possession of land in that state would add greatly
to the comfort of any resident clergyman in New South Wales,
whence the possession of it in its present uncleared state is
only a source of disencouraging expense to them.</p>
<p>Respecting the proportions in which grants of land should be
made to settlers on their arrival from England, I have already
stated that there hitherto existed no precise rule, but that the
governor exercised his discretion upon this subject according to
the information that he could obtain respecting the means and
views of the settlers themselves. Upon the recommendation of Mr.
Oxley, it was proposed that for persons who brought out real
capitals amounting to</p>

<p>It was considered that 3,000<i>l</i>. was the largest amount
of capital that was likely to be laid out in the cultivation and
improvement of land in New South It ales by any individual; but
that if a larger quantity should be retired, pension should be
given to individuals to purchase from the crown an additional
quantity (adjoining to the farms they may receive on account of
the capital employed) not exceeding three times the amount of
their grant.</p>
<p>After the statement that I have already made respecting the
advantages of the cultivation of land in New South Wales,
compared with those to be derived from grazing, or the production
of fine wool, the maximum proposed for the extent of the granted
land is certainly small. The virtual occupation of a quantity of
good land at the Cow Pastures, not amounting to leis than 9,000
acres, does not enable Mr. M&lsquo;Arthur to feed or maintain
more than 7,000 sheep and he was anxiously looking for
opportunities of extending his own land, either by additions to
his grant, or by purchase. The proposal therefore for the sale of
land, contiguous to grants made upon real capital, is one which
will be very beneficial to settlers, and will also be productive
of revenue to the crown. In favourable situations, I should
recommend that the additional quantity of land should be sold for
ten shillings an acre; in those less favourable and more remote,
fur live shillings; and in conformity to the recommendation that
I had the honour to submit in my first Report, I think that the
temporary occupations of land contiguous to grants for terms not
exceeding seven years, might operate as a further encouragement
to respectable settlers to engage in the breeding of fine woolled
sheep; with a condition being annexed, that such persons should
bind themselves in penalties to take three convicts off the store
for every 200 acres of land allowed to be occupied, and maintain
and clothe them at their own expense during the term; and should
also engage to employ an overseer that has never been convicted,
who should constantly reside at the principal station; and that
they should further engage to erect a stockyard for such number
of cattle as they might choose to graze upon the occupied land.
With a view to afford encouragement to the purchasers of
contiguous lands, I concur in the suggestion made by Mr. Oxley,
that a deposit of 10 per cent. should be paid upon the purchase
being agreed upon, and that the remainder should be paid by
instalments every six month; until the whole was paid. A failure
in the payment of one or more instalments should not deprive the
purchaser of his right, provided the whole arrears were made good
with interest at the period the last payment became due; but a
failure in the ultimate payment should subject the purchaser to
the loss of antecedent deposits, and of all right to the
land.</p>
<p>As an exception to this general mode of disposing of land in
New South Wales, I should beg leave to point out to your
Lordship's notice that the tract called Emu Islands, now occupied
by the convicts, contains nearly 3,000 acres of the most valuable
land in the settled districts of the colony; and from local
advantages, and its great fertility, would be a desirable
situation for a township. If, however, this destination should
not be given to it, and if it should cease to be occupied as an
establishment for the convicts, no doubt can be entertained that
by public sale and competition a very high price might be
obtained for the whole, or for detached portions of it. Care,
however, should be taken in either case to reserve a convenient
spot for the landing of passengers and cattle from the ferry, and
for the direction of the public road from thence to the ascent of
the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>The proportion of land that is now required to be cultivated,
according to the scale hitherto observed in the colony, and
detailed in one of the documents of the Appendix, is not larger
than may be reasonably expected from the least opulent
cultivator; and as soon as the permission to distil spirits from
grain has begun to operate upon the market, it will be expedient
to enforce the obligation of cultivating and clearing land to the
full extent of the scale referred to, or, in failure of
performance, to resume it.</p>
<p>To facilitate the location of land to settlers on their
arrival from England, it has been proposed that the country
intended to be settled should be previously surveyed and laid out
in districts, subdivided into farms of such sizes as are usually
granted; and that with reference to the locality of the country,
and its natural boundaries, each district should not contain more
than thirty-six square miles.</p>
<p>It is further, proposed that when such a survey has received
the approbation of the governor, the inhabitants and settlers
might have access to it, to enable them to select such situations
as best suited them, and to insert the number of the allotment in
their memorial to the governor.</p>
<p>This proposal I strongly recommend to your Lordship's
consideration, as it will tend to remove the difficulties and
confusion that have hitherto existed in the choice of land, and
will prevent those heavy arrears in the office of the
surveyor-general that have obstructed the speedy location of it.
One further regulation I have to submit to your Lordship upon
this subject, that is connected with a point already adverted to
in this and my former Report: it has been stated that alienations
and transfers, both of lands in the colony and of allotments in
the towns, have frequently taken place without any reference to
the conditions of cultivation, or to the express condition of
non-alienation within the term of five years. The bounty of the
crown is thus abused, and the value of land, as well as of
situations for building in the towns, is enhanced to persons who
are desirous of settling or purchasing. I should propose,
therefore, that a separate registry should be kept in the
surveyor-general's office of all transfers that in any way relate
to land held of the crown; and that no conveyance of or title to
any such land shall be valid or legal, unless it should be so
registered. All allotments of land in the towns should be equally
subject to this regulation, by means of which the frequent and
unauthorized subdivisions of property would be checked whenever
they were found likely to interfere with the general
convenience.</p>
<p>Respecting the proportions of land to capital, by which it is
proposed that the discretion now vested in the governor in making
grants of land to settlers should in future be guided, I am of
opinion that they do not exceed the amount of capital with which
it is necessary to commence the cultivation of land in sew South
Wales. I think, however, that for Van Diemen's Land an abatement
of one-sixth may be made from each proportionate amount of
capital required.</p>
<p>From the quantity of stock now accumulated in the colony, it
does not appear to me to be necessary to make any further issues
or loans of cattle from the public herds; nor do I think it any
longer necessary that the assignment generally made to free
settlers of convict labourers, subsisted at the expense of the
crown, should be continued.</p>
<p>In making grants of land to individuals in the colony, I think
it necessary to state that the same principle should generally
prevail of previous capital or means; yet there is a description
of persons, with regard to whom it appears to me that this
qualification should not be applied with strictness.</p>
<p>The individuals to whom I allude consist of the sons of
persons who have been convicts, and whose parents are alive and
settled in the colony. To them I conceive that land should be
granted on their obtaining the age of twenty-five years; and that
cattle from the government herds should be distributed,
returnable in kind at the expiration of four years.</p>
<p>The collection of the quit-rents that are now due and have
been long due, I have already recommended to be left to the
person who is charged with the collection of the colonial
revenue; but without meaning to cast any imputation on the
conduct of Mr. Meehan, I beg leave to submit to your lordship the
expediency of requiring from him an account of the quit-rents due
on all lands, houses and allotments held of the crown, as well as
an account of all exchanges and transfers of land that have been
made by him, with the authority of Governor Macquarie, for the
improvements of the public streets, or for the enlargement and
improvement of the property of the crown; specifying the dates of
the transfers or exchanges, the names of the individuals to or
with whom they were made, the object and the purpose of the
transfer, and the consideration that was given.</p>

<h3><i>State of the Trade of the Settlements of New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> internal trade of New South Wales is put in
motion by the demand of government for the two great articles of
produce, wheat and meat, consumed by the convicts and the
individuals comp wing the civil establishment, to whom rations
are allowed. The payments for them have lately been made in
receipts signed by the commissariat officers and storekeepers at
each station, which are paid by bills on the Lords of the
Treasury; but from the month of July of the year 1813 until 1816,
and from the early part of the year 1819 until the month of
September 1820, these payments were made by promissory notes,
issued by the officers at the head of the commissariat
department, on certificates of the storekeepers of the quantity
of meat and wheat delivered. The store receipts were consolidated
once a month, by bills drawn by the officer at the head of the
commissariat department on the Lords of the Treasury, and
approved by the governor; but when promissory notes were issued
by them, they were convertible on demand either into cash or
bills upon the treasury, which, except for a certain period, were
also approved by the governor. These store receipts constituted
for some time the only medium of payment in the hands of the
settlers for the goods that they purchased in the merchants
stores, and from the difficulty that was experienced, until the
establishment of the New South Wales Bank, in exchanging those
receipts for paper of equal value or for coin, the lower order of
settlers found an excuse, or rather a temptation to improvident
and unchecked expenditure in their dealings with the retail
merchants: the unbroken amount of a store receipt was made to
cover the unexamined items of an old account, or to encourage the
establishment of a new one. At most of these stores spirits were
sold with the other goods, and the temptation to indulge in them
was thus associated with the purchase of a few of the comforts
and some of the necessaries of life.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the colony efforts have been made
by a few individuals to give an exportable value to the
productions to which its soil and climate appear to be so
favourable: In the year 1810 Governor Macquarie offered bounties
on the cultivation of flax in the colony, and pledged himself to
receive in the government factory at Paramatta any quantity
exceeding that which might be raised or employed for domestic
purposes, or to return the whole quantity supplied in its
manufactured state. This encouragement was so far effectual as to
establish the practicability of raising flax of very good quality
in the colony, but the demand having been very limited at the
period in which the bounties were offered, the cultivation of
flax declined, and no more is now grown than is sufficient for
the supply of the shoemakers.</p>
<p>The tobacco plant has been for some time introduced into the
colony and cultivated; but as the art of curing or drying it was
not known, no profit has been derived from it, although a high
price has been obtained for tobacco imported from Brazil.</p>
<p>Salt works have been established upon a large scale by Mr. J.
Blaxland upon the shore of the Paramatta River, where a
considerable quantity of salt is made. The bitter that it
contains has never been perfectly extracted; but the salt
continues to be used in the colony for domestic purposes by the
lower orders of the inhabitants, but it has not maintained any
competition with the salt imported from Great Britain.</p>
<p>A tannery of considerable extent has been established at
Sydney by an who has exclusively devoted himself to it, and
others are conducted by individuals in the country for their own
consumption, or by means of the convict labourers, who have a
knowledge of the trade. The bark of a particular species of the
Mimosa has been very successfully used in these tanneries; and
although it is found to give a reddish tinge to the leather, it
is found to be a very powerful tanning agent. From an experiment
conducted under the inspection of one of the highest authorities
in this country, the strength of the bark of the Mimosa, as
compared with that of young oak bark of England, is found to be
in the proportion of fifty-seven to thirty-nine. The mimosa tree
from which this bark is taken is not of large growth, and of late
it has become scarce in the neighbourhood of Sydney and
Paramatta. In the interior it is found in great abundance and is
always observed to spring up spontaneously in places where the
surface of the earth has been lately touched with fire. I have
already had occasion to mention the success that has attended an
individual in Van Diemen's Land to reduce this bark to an
extract, and to fit it for exportation. In Sydney, at a late
period, the price was 3<i>l</i>. per ton in its green state, and
when properly prepared for tanning was estimated to cost
6<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>It is stated by the most experienced person in this line of
business, that he exported a few tons to England in its undressed
state, and that it was much approved, but that the price that it
produced 6<i>l</i>. per ton, did not repay the expense of
collection and freight. The persons that are generally engaged in
tanning, both in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, have not
much experience in the art; and the quality of the leather is
found to suffer from the expedition with which the process is
conducted. The hides also suffer much from the careless manner in
which the cattle are slaughtered, and from the brands and marks
being placed upon the most valuable part of the skin instead of
the shoulders of the cattle.</p>
<p>I should recommend, therefore, that persons who intend to
carry on the trade of tanning in New South Wales or Van Diemen's
Land should be required to take out a licence, for which the sum
of 20<i>l</i>. should be paid; and that an inspector of hides
should be appointed for each district, whose duties should be
assimilated to those created by the 39 &amp; 40 Geo. III. c. 66.
I should further recommend that any butcher or other person, not
being a convict, should be made liable to a penalty of 5<i>s</i>.
on conviction before a magistrate, of wilfully or carelessly
cutting the hides of cattle, so as to injure them in the making
of leather; and that if such person should be a convict, he
should be liable to be punished corporally, by order of a
magistrate, or to be imprisoned and confined to hard labour for
one month.</p>
<p>The quality of the leather tanned in New South Wales has
latterly been improved, and will be further increased when the
cattle are allowed to attain a greater age before they are
slaughtered. The colour produced by the Mimosa bark is not
favourable to its appearance or its competition with English
leather, yet under good management its value may be made equal to
the best leather tanned in England: The price that it now bears
in New South Wales may be stated to be 14<i>d</i>. per pound for
sole leather, 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. for upper
leather, and 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for a tanned kangaroo
skin.</p>
<p>The manufactures carried on in the colony are confined to
hats, coarse cloths, blankets, and woollen stockings. For these
the colony is mach indebted to the activity and enterprize of Mr.
S. Lord, who has established a manufactory at Botany Bay, about
six miles from Sydney, where be employs a certain number of
convict; and from fifteen to twenty colonial boys. The price of
the best quality of the cloth that he manufactures is 15<i>s</i>.
a yard, and a considerable quantity is sold to the settlers and
exported to Van Diemen's Land. Some competition arises in this
trade from the facility that the settlers find in employing
convict weavers, so many of whom have been transported to the
colony within the last five years. There are two manufactories of
hats at Sydney, in which a considerable number of the coarser
qualities are made. They are not found to be so durable as hats
of English manufacture, but are sold at much lower prices.</p>
<p>One pottery only has been established in New South Wales, and
a few articles of the coarsest kind only have been produced in
it. The ware is both badly manufactured and very dear. An attempt
was made by the chief engineer to employ some of the convicts at
Sydney, and a proper furnace and buildings were erected at the
brick fields. The two principal workmen were very skilful in the
ornamental part of their business, and succeeded in producing
some very good specimens of workmanship. As, however, they had
not the means of glazing the ware, it was not convertible to any
useful purpose. I should recommend, therefore, that this species
of manufacture should be discontinued, and that in future the
attention of the few convicts that may be employed should be
directed to the coarser and more Useful kinds of pottery ware,
which may be afterwards sold with some profit on account of
government. The manufacture of the flax of New Zealand, made from
the leaves of a plant that has been found to grow therein great
abundance (the Phormium tenax) has of late attracted considerable
attention in the colony. It was established at Sydney by an
emancipated convict named Williams, who has had infinite merit
both in the invention and application of the machinery, by which
he first was able to break the leaves of the plant in their green
state, and afterwards to dress it, and to manufacture it into
rope and twine. The plant has been introduced into New South
Wales, but has not been cultivated. A few specimens are to be
found in the government gardens at Sydney and Paramatta,
affording abundant proof of the facility with which its
cultivation may be extended whenever a demand should be created
for it. The individual already mentioned has manufactured the
flax into every species of cordage, except cables. Its
superiority of strength to the hemp of the Baltic has been
attested both by experiments made at Sydney, and by one that was
made under my own observation in the King's Yard at Deptford.</p>
<p>As I was not able to ascertain at Sydney whether the New
Zealand flax would imbibe tar, I caused a certain quantity that I
brought to England in its undressed state to be made into rope by
a very eminent manufacturer in London, and I found that the
doubts that I entertained were unfounded, and that the rope was
as much and as easily affected by tar as rope made of the Baltic
hemp. After its superiority of strength was established by the
experiment I have already mentioned, it was immersed in water,
and occasionally used on board one of His Majesty's ships lying
at Portsmouth, and during that period it was observed to loose
its flexibility in the same way, though not to so great a degree,
as the small cordage used by the natives of New Zealand in
fishing. The same piece of rope was made use of on board a
merchant ship in the river Thames for lifting weights, and was
found to have lost nothing of its strength, and had regained its
pliability; but from the peculiar compactness with which the
strands were laid, and from the frequent friction to which one
part was exposed, in the particular use to which it was applied,
some parts appeared to have burst. I was led to attach some
degree of importance to the result of this experiment, as a
different opinion had been expressed by the officers of the
Chatham Dock Yard, to whom an examination of the strength of
another piece, made from the New Zealand flax, had been referred
upon a former occasion in the year 1818.</p>
<p>The great length to which the leaves of the Phormium tenax
grow in New Zealand render the flax that is made from it
particularly useful for naval purposes; and the only question
that now remains to be decided is its capacity for resisting salt
water. In its application to all other purposes, either naval or
domestic, the specimens produced in the manufactory of Williams,
at Sydney, amply attest the superiority of the New Zealand flax;
and with the means that he has discovered of breaking it in its
green state, it may be ranked as one of the most valuable
productions that the soil of New South Wales is capable of
producing. The supply of the flax from New Zealand having been
very inconsiderable, and no attempt having been made to grow it
in New South Wales, its use in manufacture has not been
extensive; but I conceive that sufficient experience has now been
acquired of its value to render it an object worthy of every
encouragement by the local government of New South Wales. With
this view, I should recommend that a certain number of convicts
should be employed in planting the New Zealand flax, either at
Emu Plains, or at any other of the government farms in New South
Wales, and that a negociation should be immediately entered into
with Williams for the communication of his invention of the
machine for breaking the flax, and by giving him every
encouragement in the purchase of rope made by him from that
material for the use of the colonial vessels.</p>
<p>It is by assistance rendered in this manner, and by the
application, on a small scale at first, of a portion of the great
means that exist in the hands of the local government in New
South Wales for the developement of the resources of the colony,
that the expenses incurred for the support of the convicts may
ultimately be transferred from the hands of government to those
of individuals, and that articles of export may be found, by
which the real prosperity of the inhabitants may be promoted.</p>
<p>For the purpose of forming a comparative estimate of the
several articles of colonial manufacture, I deemed it expedient
to make a collection of them; and specimens of the tanning
substances, the leather, cloth, hats, porcelain, and the cordage
manufactured from the New Zealand flax, as well as the flax grown
in New South Wales, are respectfully submitted to your Lordship's
notice.</p>
<p>The production and growth of fine wool has already been
noticed, and may be, considered as the great staple article of
its future exports. The manufacture of it in the colony is not an
object that is much to be desired in its present infant state;
and it will be much more conformable to its real interests, and
to the interchange of mutual benefits, and the surest bond of
union between two distant countries, that the colony of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land should continue to profit, by the
great natural advantages they possess of climate and extent of
pasturage, by remitting to England fine wool in its raw state,
and in receiving in return the same or other produce in their
manufactured state. Two commercial houses at Sydney, have lately
been engaged in the purchase and consignment of wool, but the
growers of the best qualities have hitherto exported it on their
own account.</p>
<p>The wood of New South Wales has been used in the construction
of colonial vessels, and four species of it, namely, the iron
bark, black butted gum, stringy bark, and cedar, are found to be
very useful, both for naval and domestic purposes. The peculiar
qualities of these woods are, hardness, heaviness and durability.
From recent importations into England that have been made of very
well selected logs of the stringy bark, this species is found to
start in working, and ship-builders have expressed their
apprehensions of using it either in building or repairs. The
largest trees in New South Wales are generally unsound, but they
are still useful for domestic purposes and for fencing. The duty
of 1<i>s</i>. that until lately was imposed Upon every solid foot
of timber imported or brought into Port Jackson from any other
harbour in New South Wales than Newcastle or Hunter's River, had
begun to operate unfavourably to the interests of the colony for
some time previous to its repeal.</p>
<p>The difficulty of obtaining cedar had encouraged convict
labourers or sawyers to proceed to the nearest part of the coast
in which it could be found, and after conveying it in small
vessels to Port Jackson, to deposit it by night on the shores of
the harbour. The same cause also operated as an inducement to the
convicts engaged in the lumber-yard at Sydney, to convey it away
to receivers in the town, find the consumption of this article at
that station was so large as to justify a well-grounded suspicion
that this species of depredation existed to a very great extent.
Exemptions from the payment of this duty granted to particular
individuals increased the dissatisfaction with which it was
viewed, and as it never appears to have been it productive tax,
every reason existed in favour of its repeal.</p>
<p>The timber in the settled districts having now become scarce,
the importation of timber in the small colonial vessels to Port
Jackson will speedily become an important object of colonial
commerce.</p>
<p>The trade carried on between New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land consists of importations from the latter settlement of
wheat, salted meat and potatoes. From the years 1815 to 1820,
60,309 bushels of wheat were imported from Hobart Town to Port
Jackson, and 47,355 bushels from Port Dalrymple. In the same
period 320 casks of salted meat were imported from the former
place, and 172 from the latter. Wheat is also brought from
Windsor by the River Hawkesbury and Broken Bay to Port Jackson,
or exported direct to Port Hunter for the supply of the convicts
at that settlement, and cargoes of lime, wood, and coals are
returned.</p>
<p>The state of dependance in which most of the settlers are at
Van Diemen's Land upon the dealers prevents them from deriving
much benefit from the demand that the increasing consumption of
New South Wales has created for wheat and meat.</p>
<p>At Port Dalrymple there has hitherto been no direct
importation from England or other places, and all manufactured
goods are received there with the charges of double freight and
commission.</p>
<p>The difference of prices on common articles between Sydney and
Launceston amounts to near too per cent.</p>
<p>The number of colonial vessels employed in the coasting trade
does not exceed twenty-nine, of which seven are not more than
fifteen tons burthen, and the largest of the others does not
exceed 184 tons. These vessels are both badly equipped and badly
navigated, and are little qualified to resist the heavy gales of
wind with which the coast of New South Wales is visited during
many seasons of the year. The coast is bold, and little danger
exists in approaching it too nearly, but the currents are so
strong that they disappoint the calculations of the moat skilful
and vigilant navigators.</p>
<p>The restrictions that are the most frequent subject of
complaint in the colonial trade arise from the delay that is
caused in the port of Sydney as well as in the other settlements,
from the necessity of complying with the forty-first article of
the Port Regulations. That article requires that masters or
commanders of vessels shall give public notice, twice
successively in the Sydney Gazette, as to the time of the ships
sailing, and are also to leave at the Secretary's office a
written notice thereof, at least ten days previous to the muster
of the ship's company. The object of the first part of this
regulation is to secure creditors against the clandestine escape
of their debtors from the colony, and as the Sydney Gazette,
although printed on Saturday, is only published on a Sunday, a
ship arriving on the day after must necessarily remain fourteen
days, until she can commence another voyage. Although many of the
colonial vessels are manned by sailors born in the colony, they
are also in the habit of engaging sailors that have escaped from
other vessels, and as these persons have not generally been
included in the notice that is given by captains of vessels on
their arrival at Sydney, by crying down the credit of their
crews, they are exposed to the necessity of waiting until an
advertisement has appeared twice in the Gazette.</p>
<p>The notice of ten days to the secretary's office, previous to
the muster, does not appear to me to carry with it the same
necessity as the first of these regulations, and it has
frequently been accompanied by greater delay.</p>
<p>A good deal of such delay must depend upon the degree of
interference caused with the other public duties and engagements
of the secretary's office, but it does not spear to require such
a length of notice as ten days. The object of this notice is to
afford opportunities to the secretary of examining the condition
and character of the persons who are taking their departure from
the colony to another, or removing from that part of it where
they are known to that in which they are strangers. In this duty,
as well as that of a similar nature, that he is called upon to
perform in respect of vessels clearing out for foreign ports, he
is obliged to have reference to the indents deposited in his
office, in case any persons present themselves either With
certificates of the expiration of their sentences, or with
general pardons, for the purpose of fixing the identity of their
persons, and comparing it with the description that was taken of
them on their first arrival in the colony. Persons holding
conditional pardons are allowed to remove from one part of the
colony to another, but not to engage as sailors in the colonial
vessels; an equally strict examination is therefore required as
to their identity; and information of their departure, as well as
the particulars of their sentence and pardon, are transmitted to
the lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land, or the commandant
of Port Dalrymple.</p>
<p>In obtaining these particulars the secretary is assisted by
the gaoler or chief constable of Sydney.</p>
<p>It is from the nature of the service in the colonial vessels,
and the temptation that their frequent departure, as well as that
of vessels of larger burthen and more distant destination, hold
out to convicts and debtors to make their escape from the colony,
that the regular compliance with the colonial regulations that
requires an accurate muster to be made of all persons previous to
embarkation, has been so rigidly enforced.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town, in consequence of a daring attempt in which
some convicts succeeded in carrying off a schooner to Batavia,
small coasting vessels proceeding from Hobart Town to Pitt Water
have been ordered to take clearances from the secretary's office,
on payment of a fee of 6<i>s</i>. for the purpose of providing
against the embarkation of convicts in them.</p>
<p>The great objections made to these regulations are the expense
and the delay which they occasion. The former consists of a fee
of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for every person named and inserted in
the clearance of each vessel, of which sum 1<i>s</i>. is paid to
the principal clerk in the secretary's office, and a tonnage duty
of 2<i>l</i>. on all vessels not exceeding forty tons. The amount
of these fees, as well as those taken by the naval officers at
Sydney and Port Dalrymple, on the clearances of a vessel of 118
tons, making ten voyages from Port Jackson to Port Dalrymple in a
year, are estimated to amount to the sum of 310<i>l</i>. The
delay occasioned by waiting in port till the expiration of the
period required for the appearance of two successive
advertisements in the Sydney Gazette, and for the notice to the
secretary's office, is a great augmentation of the expense; and
the muster of the crews of the vessels at the secretary's office
has been found to afford opportunities to the sailors to abscond,
and intoxicate themselves in the towns. It has therefore been
found necessary, as an additional security, that the naval
officers, who are the last persons that visit vessels on their
departure, should muster the crew and passengers, for the purpose
of ascertaining whether there are any other persons on board than
those named in the clearance.</p>
<p>The principal cause of complaint upon these subjects would be
removed if the duty of mustering the crew on board the vessels,
rather than at his official residence, were personally performed
by the secretary; and if the regulation that requires two
advertisements in the gazette, either for the captains, the
mates, or the sailors of <i>colonial</i> vessels, were entirely
dispensed with, as well as the regulation that requires the
sailors of these vessels to take a certificate of no detainer
from the Judge Advocate's office before their names are permitted
to be inserted in the clearance.</p>
<p>The demands against all these persons generally arise from the
credit they too easily obtain, for small amounts, from the public
houses; and it may afford a wholesome check to that indulgence,
to limit the power of detention to cases in which the debt
claimed shall exceed 10<i>l</i>. in amount, and to exclude it
altogether where it is incurred in the supply of spirituous
liquors.</p>
<p>With regard to the crews of vessels clearing for places or
destinations not within the colony or its dependencies, the
difficulty or the delay that may be interposed by the muster of
any number of persons taken from a population consisting of
convicts, whose sentences are remitted or expired, is one that is
unavoidable in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; and the
officer who has the custody of the documents that establish or
negative the legal competence of these persons to quit the
colony, has alone the power of abridging either the delay or the
difficulties attendant upon their embarkation and departure.</p>
<p>The same difficulties that attend the intercourse between the
settlements of the colony on the coast have been found to attach
to another branch of the home colonial trade, that consists of
the seal-fishery, which is carried on either in the islands in
Bases Straits, or on the shores of New Zealand, Macquarie, and
Campbell islands. In all these islands the fishing parties are
left for a considerable time to pursue their occupation, while
the vessels return to or to convey to them fresh supplies. The
sailors employed are paid by a certain proportion of the proceeds
called lays. Many of the sealing-parties repair to the islands in
Bass's Straits, where they reside for some time, depending upon
the arrival of boats from Port Dalrymple for supplies of
provision and upon the arrival of coasting vessels from Port
Jackson, for the sale of their seal skins.</p>
<p>In these occupations they are accompanied by the native black
women of Van Diemen's Land, who take part in these adventures by
the connivance of their husbands, or for the purpose of securing
themselves from ill treatment.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of a person much experienced in this trade,
that several convicts have found means of escape from New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land to India. The seal fishery in the
island of Bass's Straits hies from these causes been much
disturbed, and is not so productive as it was formerly; it has
therefore been transferred to the coast of New Zealand and
Macquarie Island, and the seal skins are either brought to Port
Jackson, where they are charged a duty of three half-pence per
skin, or are sent to China.</p>
<p>The restrictions upon the home trade of the colony to which I
have now adverted, have been trifling in comparison to that which
has been experienced by the inhabitants in their attempts to
engage in the whale fishery, in consequence of the heavy duties
imposed on the importation of train oil, blubber, and spermaceti
oil, into Great Britain, taken and caught wholly by His Majesty's
subjects usually residing in a British plantation or settlement;
the duty upon black whale oil, amounting to 8<i>l</i>. 8<i>s</i>.
per ton, and on spermaceti oil, to 24<i>l</i>. 18<i>s</i>.
9<i>d</i>. Previous to the enactment of these duties the whale
fishery had presented an ample source, both of enterprize and:
profit to the inhabitants of New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land. Small vessels, not exceeding go or too tons burthen, were
fitted out at Sydney, and were very successful in prosecuting the
fishery, even within sight of the coasts. The bays; of the
western coasts of Van Diemen's Land abound with black whales, and
during my residence in the settlement, I observed some British
vessels at anchor in the river Derwent, within twelve miles of
Hobart Town, engaged in the fishery, while all participation in
it was virtually denied to the inhabitants. The coasts of New.
South Wales are equally the resort of black whales at all periods
of the year, and in the winter season the spermaceti whales
repair to the north-east coasts; several of the native-born
youths of the colony found it a profitable employment in the
colonial vessels fitted out for this trade, and the oil procured
in it was brought to Sydney, and deposited in warehouses for the
freight of vessels returning to England; a more natural and
profitable course of commercial employment, or one that was more
advantageous to the inhabitants, could not have been devised. It
is however necessary to add, that all the objections that have
been stated to apply to commercial intercourse with these
settlements, as long as they are occupied and treated as
receptacles of convicts, would have applied, and still continue
to apply, to the particular branch of the whale fishery that is
conducted upon the coasts. In Van Diemen's Land, where it is
found to be most easy and practicable, the attempts of the
convicts to seize and carry off large vessels, have been most
frequent and daring.</p>
<p>It was under a strong impression of the necessity of applying
the regulations that have already been noticed to south-sea
whalers, anchoring in the bays and waters of the river Derwent,
in the prosecution of the fishery, that Lieutenant-Governor
Scroll made a representation to Governor Macquarie respecting the
refusal of one of these vessels to repair to Hobart Town, to
enter outwards before she finally left the river, and to be
searched for convicts that might have secreted themselves on
board.</p>
<p>The opportunities afforded by the casual delay both of
colonial and English vessels between their anchorage in the
harbours, and the open sea, are precisely those that are most
anxiously watched by the convicts, and are favourable for their
concealment and escape.</p>
<p>It is to defeat these attempts that one of the port
regulations requires, that no vessel shall come to anchor between
the harbours in Sydney or Sullivan's Coves; but, that after being
once searched and cleared out shall immediately proceed to sea,
and yet it is in these very limits that the temptations to
prosecute the whale fishery in the colonial and the other vessels
are the greatest, on account of the facility with which it is
conducted. The communications, moreover, that colonial vessels
would hold with those engaged in the South Sea fishery, when met
with at a greater distance from the coasts, would multiply the
opportunities for the escape of convicts from the colony. Until,
therefore, the number of convicts at Sydney and Hobart Town is
greatly diminished, and the control over them increased, and
until all those in the employment of government are confined and
lodged in a barrack, where their numbers can at any time be
checked and ascertained, I am of opinion, that it will not be
expedient to diminish the weight of those restrictions that
operate at present as an entire prohibition to the inhabitants of
either colony to engage in the prosecution of the whale
fisheries. Whenever that period arrives, it is hardly necessary
for me to insist upon the great advantage that will be derived
from the admission of the inhabitants to participate in a trade
to which they are as much invited by their natural dispositions
as by their local interests.</p>
<p>The repeal of the present duties on the importation of black
and spermaceti whale oil, or blubber and whale fins, fished and
taken by the inhabitants of New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, and the reduction of those duties to the amount paid on
oil, the produce of fish taken on the shores of Newfoundland,
namely, 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per ton for train oil and blubber,
and 15<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. on spermaceti oil, are measures that
cannot fail to be productive of lasting benefit to the colony. In
a general point of view, it would afford employment to a large
proportion of native youths of the colony, and inure them to
habits of activity and enterprize, and, as far as it regards the
interests of commerce, it would add to the few means the colony
now, or for some time will possess of furnishing freight to the
vessels that bring consignments of manufactured goods from
Europe, or that are employed in the transportation of
convicts.</p>
<p>I need hardly add, that in proportion to the facility afforded
to these last-mentioned vessels of procuring freight at Port
Jackson and Van Diemen's Land, on their return-voyages, will the
rate of freight be diminished to the government for the transport
of the convicts from England to New South Wales.</p>
<p>The foreign trade of New South Wales consists of the
importations of sugar, spirits, soap, and cotton goods from
Bengal, and tea and sugar candy from Canton; to which latterly
has been added that of Chinese silks, and wearing apparel made up
in China of cloth imported thither from Great Britain.</p>
<p>The importations from Europe consist of iron and hardware
goods, cottons, millinery, wines, porter, cheese, and salted
provisions.</p>
<p>A few successful attempts were made at one period in the
colonial vessels, to supply the China and Batavia market with
sandal wood pearl shells, and beche la mer, from the Fejee and
Marquesas Islands, and to import cargoes of tea in return. The
outrages committed by the crews of these vessels upon the natives
of the South Sea Islands, and the spirit of vengeance that these
outrages excited, as well as the subsequent and successful
competition of the Americans in this branch of commerce, have
been the causes of its decline in the hands of the inhabitants of
New South Wales; and the trade that they now carry on with the
South Sea Islands is restricted to that which was first opened by
the missionaries, consisting of the exchange of cocoa-nut oil and
salt pork, for coarse cottons and iron ware. The desire of the
inhabitants of all these islands to obtain fire-arms and
gunpowder has much impeded the attempts of the missionaries to
introduce amongst them a knowledge of christianity; and as the
intercourse of the vessels engaged in the South Sea fisheries has
not been found susceptible of any effectual restraint, many
instances have occurred on one side of violent and unpunished
outrage, and on the other, of savage and indiscriminate revenge.
The extensive and beautiful islands of New Zealand have been the
most frequent theatres of these afflicting occurrences, as they
are more resorted to than the other islands on account of the
excellence of the harbours, and the facility of obtaining
supplies. The warlike and hostile spirit of the native tribes
towards each other has been fed by the instruments of destruction
that their intercourse with Europeans has placed in their hands.
The missionaries themselves have incurred some danger from the
same cause, and such is now the value attached to the possession
of fire-arms amongst the New Zealanders, that no supplies of food
can be obtained from them, even by the missionaries, without some
concession to their prevailing love of war and revenge. Several
of these islanders have visited New South Wales, and a few of
them have been taught the art of spinning flax, and have learnt
to read and write in a school established by the Rev. Mr. Marsden
at Paramatta. Their attainments however have not core responded
to the sanguine expectations he had formed of them. If the
missionaries at New Zealand should hereafter more attention to
the cultivation of their land, and to place before the eyes of
the natives the practical benefits of the arts of civilization
and commerce, they will be more likely to obtain influence over
the New Zealanders, and to detach them from the pursuits of war
and plunder in which they now so obstinately engage.</p>
<p>At present the trade between New Zealand and the other islands
of the South Seas, from one or other of the causes before
mentioned, is very inconsiderable. In the Society Islands however
the efforts of the missionaries have been more successful, both
in the diffusion of a knowledge of christianity, and in exciting
a disposition to cultivate intercourse with the subjects of the
Crown of Great Britain.</p>
<p>The trade that has hitherto existed has been altogether in the
hands of the missionaries, directed by the Reverend Mr. Marsden,
their agent at Sydney. The articles exported from thence having
consisted of cotton goods and supplies for the missionaries, who
in return have sent cocoa-nut oil, and salted pork to Sydney. An
attempt was lately made at that port to engage in a direct trade
with the king of Taheite, and it appears that the cultivation
both of sugar, cotton, and coffee, may be expected to increase in
that and the other Islands, and enable the natives to carry on an
extensive trade in those articles with New South Wales.</p>
<p>The duties that have been levied upon the importation of goods
and merchandise into New South Wales have consisted of
10<i>s</i>. for every gallon of spirits landed, 9<i>d</i>. for
every gallon of wine, and 6<i>d</i>. upon each pound of tobacco.
There have been also duties levied, amounting to 2<i>l</i>.
10<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. upon every ton of sandal-wood, and pearl
shells; 5<i>l</i>. on every ton of beche la mer; 2<i>l</i>.
10<i>s</i>. on every ton of spermaceti oil, and 2<i>l</i>. on
black whale oil; a duty of 1&frac12;<i>d</i>. on every seal skin,
and &frac12;<i>d</i>. on every hare or kangaroo skin. On timber
the duties have consisted of 1<i>s</i>. for each solid foot of
cedar, or other timber imported from Shoal Haven, or any other
port of the coast (Newcastle excepted) when not supplied by
government labourers, a duty of 1<i>l</i>. for every twenty spars
from New Zealand or elsewhere, and 1<i>s</i>. on every solid foot
of timber, either in log or plank, imported from New Zealand. In
addition to these duties, fees are demanded and paid to the two
wharfingers, amounting to 9<i>d</i>. on every bale, cask, or
package, landed or shipped; 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for metage of
every ton of coal, and 2<i>s</i>. for measure of every one
hundred feet of timber.</p>
<p>Of all the several duties that have been imposed and levied in
New South Wales, those upon the importation of spirits have been
the most productive, and the successive augmentations that have
been made from 3<i>s</i>. to 5<i>s</i>. in the year 1812, from
5<i>s</i>. to 7<i>s</i>. in the year 1814, and lastly from
7<i>s</i>. to 10<i>s</i>. in the month of April 1818, have had no
perceptible effect upon the consumption.</p>
<p>The duties have always been levied upon the quantity, and not
upon the strength of the spirits; and at the period in which the
second augmentation of duty was made, an option was given to the
importers to deposit their spirits in the King's store until
payment of the duty, giving bond, or sufficient security, to make
that payment within twelve months from the landing of the
spirits; and if they remained in deposit beyond that period they
were to be charged with a further payment of 1<i>s</i>. per cask
for every week that the spirits should remain in store.</p>
<p>From the mode adopted for levying the duty on spirits, and the
virtual encouragement it held out to the importation of spirit of
the strongest proof, the largest importations of this article
consisted of Bengal Rum, the strength of which has been estimated
as high as thirty and forty per cent. above the hydrometer proof,
while the spirit imported from the isle of France, being inferior
in quality as well as strength, has not found such a ready sale.
In the year 1819, the quantity of spirit issued from the bonded
store at Sydney to individuals, amounted to 58,079 gallons, and
in 1820, to 69,741 gallons. To this must be added the quantity
issued on account of government, amounting in the first year to
18,743 gallons, and in the second to 17,062. Of the quantity
issued to individuals, the largest portion was from twenty to
thirty per cent. over London proof; and the rate of annual
consumption of spirit in the colony may therefore be estimated at
100,000 gallons.</p>
<p>By the statute of the 59th Geo. III. c. 114, continued by
subsequent statutes paned in the first and second years of His
present Majesty's reign, the governor of New South Wales was
authorized to levy duties on spirits made in the colony; and in
the exercise of that power, Governor Macquarie issued a series of
regulations on the 10th February 1821, by which the distillation
in the colony of spirit from grain was to be guided. The duty
upon colonial spirit was fixed at the rate of 2<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per gallon of spirit of the strength of seven per
cent. above hydrometer proof; while the duty upon imported spirit
continued at 10<i>s</i>., which, however, was to be levied on the
strength of all spirits above hydrometer proof imported from and
after the 1st May 1821, from any part of British India, and on
the first day of August 1821, if imported from any other
place.</p>
<p>The governor not having the power of augmenting any duty that
had previously been levied in the colony, by the Act that paced
in the last session of Parliament the duty of 10<i>s</i>. per
gallon on spirits, the manufacture and produce of Great Britain,
and on rum, the produce of any of the British West India Islands,
was continued at 10<i>s</i>.; and a duty of 15<i>s</i>. per
gallon was ordered to be levied upon all other spirits imported.
The difference of duty thus established between the colonial and
imported spirits will operate as a great encouragement to the
distillation within the colony, and will also have an effect that
I conceive to be very desirable, of altering the taste that
prevails in New South Wales for the use of the ardent spirit that
has been imported from India.</p>
<p>By the last-mentioned Act of Parliament the duty upon tobacco
imported into the colony of New South Wales was raised from
6<i>d</i>. to 4<i>s</i>. upon the pound weight, with a view to
encourage the domestic growth of that article. The ordinary
supplies have been furnished from Bengal, and a taste has been
created amongst all classes of consumers for the peculiar flavour
that is imparted to the Brazil tobacco from the admixture of
coarse sugar and molasses. The price of this tobacco has always
been subject to great fluctuations, from 7<i>s</i>. to 1<i>l</i>.
I have been informed upon good authority, that since my departure
from the colony, the tobacco that was planted at Emu Plains under
the direction of Mr. Fitzgerald, in 1820, was dried and cured by
a person conversant in the trade, and that during a period in
which imported tobacco was very scarce, it was sold in the colony
on account of government, for 4<i>s</i>. per pound. The climate
of New South Wales, and the fertile portions of the soil, appear
to be very favourable to the growth of tobacco; and there seems
to be no reason that the convicts who may be destined hereafter
to the new settlements in Port Bowen, Moreton Bay, and Port
Curteis, should not be employed in the cultivation of it, as well
as in the subsequent process of drying and packing it for
exportation.</p>
<p>The remaining duties on imports consist of those levied by
colonial authority, subsequently confirmed by Act of Parliament,
and of the <i>ad valorem</i> duty of fifteen per cent. upon all
goods, wares and merchandise, that are not the growth, produce or
manufacture of the United Kingdom, imported directly from thence
into the colony. National character, and direct importation of
goods, thus constituting the grounds of exemption from the duty
as will attach upon all other goods, whether imported from India
and China, or from other its of the world. Of this, there are
none that will not fully bear the <i>ad valorem</i> duty,
augmented by the last Act of Parliament from five to fifteen per
cent.</p>
<p>I have already stated that the cargoes from China consist of
tea, sugar, and a small portion of the silk manufactures.</p>
<p>It appears that this trade has been carried on by India-built
vessels, and in one instance, by a vessel aiming a register from
the Isle of France, for which licenses have been obtained by
application to the government in Bengal, and subject to the
control of the Committee of supercargoes at Canton. Instances
have occurred in which vessels have cleared out direct from New
South Wales to China, but in general their destination is stated
to be the South Seas.</p>
<p>Tea is observed to be the constant accompaniment to the meals
of the middle and lower classes of inhabitants; and from the
adoption of it as part of the daily ration of the convicts in the
employ of Government, the consumption has been much
increased.</p>
<p>The vessels that have been engaged in importing it have not
been of large tonnage, and the consignments have been made on
account of the principal merchants resident at Sydney, who
complain of interference in this branch of trade by certain
foreigners, who, through an American interest at Canton and the
Isle of France, hay: been able to procure facilities for their
trade, as well as protection for the vessel in which it is
carried on. The effect of this interference has been to reduce,
in a very material degree, the prices of tea in New South Wales,
and to glut the market with an article that had in earlier times
afforded frequent opportunities of profitable monopoly.</p>
<p>The importation of tea by way of Bengal is of course subject
to greater expense, and heavier charges, than that which is
effected from China direct, and this circumstance has added
considerably to the regret with which those merchants, who have
not the facilities of engaging in the direct trade, view the
interference of the resident foreigners.</p>
<p>The operation of the colonial duties that have been imposed
upon the importation of sandal-wood, beche la mer, and pearl
shells, has not been so much felt since the decline of the trade
in those articles, in consequence of the interference of the
Americans in the direct trade that they carry on between the
South Sea islands and China. The importation of them into New
South Wales has now nearly ceased; but as the trade may in some
future period revive, and as the expense of fitting out vessels
at Port Jackson, and the wages of seamen hired there, press
heavily on all maritime enterprizes, I should recommend that the
duties that I have before recapitulated, as well as those of
2<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. and 2<i>l</i>. upon oil imported into the
colony, either for consumption or exportation, should be
repealed.</p>
<p>English vessels engaged in the South Sea fishery are much
deterred from resorting to Port Jackson for refreshment, by the
amount of the port duties.</p>
<p>The owners of these vessels equally dread the temptations held
out by the dissipation of the town of Sydney, and the endless
causes of detention of their sailors, as well as of desertion to
which it gives rise.</p>
<p>It has been strongly urged, that no measures of harbour police
within the colony can afford at once such effectual protection or
control as the presence of an English of war, and that the
control would equally be extended to the coasts of New South
Wales, and to those of New Zealand, where it might afford the
most beneficial protection to the natives of that island against
the outrages of the South Sea whaling vessels. I think it
probable that in a very short period the New Zealanders will
become so expert in the use of fire arms that they will be
competent to repel actual violence, if they are not equal to
punish injustice; but I cannot help stating it as my opinion,
founded both upon reference to past transactions, actual
observation, and the opinions of others, that the present
settlement of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land are greatly
in need of some efficient naval protection for their harbours and
coasting trade.</p>
<p>The harbour-dues to which I have before alluded consist of a
fee of 5<i>l</i>. sterling or 1<i>l</i>. 10.[<i>s</i>.] paid to
the naval officer, or received by him and paid over to the
treasurer of the police-fund, for entries of all ships laden with
articles for sale, and in government service, or otherwise; and
of fees of 1<i>l</i>. to 6<i>l</i>. according to the tonnage of
the vessels, for permission to obtain wood and water; of a fee of
1<i>l</i>. 1<i>s</i>. for permission to trade; of 10<i>s</i>. on
each of three bonds taken for due observance of the port
regulations, and for the security of the convict; and lastly of a
fee of 5<i>s</i>. for the port-clearance, and 2<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. for the naval officer's clerk.</p>
<p>The fees for pilotage, as well as for the benefit of the
light-house on the south head of Port Jackson, are received by
the naval officer, for each ship that enters the harbour, and are
paid over to the treasurer of the police-fund.</p>
<p>The aggregate of these fees for a ship of 500 tons amount to
21<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. and with the exception of that, for
permission to trade, have been demanded from ships entering the
harbour for the purposes of refreshment, as well as from those
that bring cargoes, or convey convicts from England.</p>
<p>Exemptions from the payment of duties at Hobart Town have
occasionally been granted in favour of ship conveying convicts
thither from Port Jackson, or conveying passengers on account of
government. Of all these charges, that which is made for
permission to wood and water appears, under present
circumstances, to have the least foundation, either as arising
from service rendered, or accommodation afforded. The only
regular place for obtaining water in Sydney is at the tanks, that
were excavated during the administration of Governor King from
the rocky channel of a ravine, for the preservation or deposit
for the water that descends from a small Spring in the higher
part of the town. These tanks are neither deep nor capacious, and
access to them has, until very lately, been open, and the
regulations for keeping them free from dirt and disturbance have
met with very little attention. To the shipping they could afford
only slight accommodation on account of their distance from the
shore, and the risk of the dispersion of the sailors when
employed in filling their water-casks. They have therefore
resorted to a farm on the north shore of the harbour, where the
supply of water is precarious in the summer season; and they cut
wood on the banks in the immediate neighbourhood. There is
certainly nothing in the past or present state of the supply of
these very necessary articles at Sydney that justifies a charge
for them; and until some facility is afforded by the local
government, complaints of this charge are not unreasonable;
colonial vessels are exempted from paying it, but I observed that
it was included in the naval officer's charges at Hobart Town,
although no greater facility is afforded there than at Sydney in
the supply of water and wood, and no other benefit conferred than
the casual superintendance of an officer called the water-bailiff
whose duty it is to appoint the time and places to which the
watering parties are sent to resort.</p>
<p>The fee for permission to trade is no longer justified by the
state of the commercial regulations of the colony, and may well
be dispensed with.</p>
<p>The remaining fees paid to the naval officer appear to be
justified by the several services to which they are attached, and
are also inconsiderable in amount.</p>
<p>The mode in which the fees for wharfage have been levied has
become a subject of complaint by the owners of vessels and
importers of cargoes; a fee of 9<i>d</i>. is taken for every
bale, cask, or package, of which, 6<i>d</i>. is Raid to
government, and 3<i>d</i>. to the wharfinger; no distinction or
allowance is made for small packages; and the charge upon the
landing of cargoes from India and China, which generally consist
of packages of that description, amounts to a considerable sum.
The consideration moreover, for the charge of 6<i>d</i>. that is
payable to the government, was originally founded upon the
accommodation afforded, and the expense that had been incurred in
the construction of the public wharf, now called the King's
Wharf, where all goods were ordered to be landed from the ships.
Front the increase of the trade of the port, and the decay of the
wharf itself, the accommodation for landing goods upon it is very
inadequate, and they are not allowed to be landed at any other
place; it is therefore very desirable that as the tax continues
to be paid for it, the wharf should be either enlarged, or that
another wharf should be constructed in some other part of Sydney
Cove.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town the same fee is charged for landing goods, and
the want of accommodation is still more conspicuous than at
Sydney. Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, however, was taking measures
for the improvement of the wharf during my residence in Van
Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>A plan was suggested to me by several of the inhabitants of
the town of Sydney, that promised to combine facilities for the
landing of goods, and the means of cleansing the harbour from the
quantities of sand and alluvial deposit that have already begun
to accumulate near the only quay that is now left for the
accommodation of the public. On reference to the plan of the town
of Sydney, it will be found that at the place in which the small
stream that flows from the higher part of the town, and
discharges itself into the cove, the shore for a considerable
space on each side is covered with soft mud and sand, that is
washed by the title at high water. This surface extends nearly
from the government wharf to the public wharf, and it has been
proposed to build a quay extending from one of these points to
the other, leaving a passage for the water of the rivulet, which
being confined to a narrow and deep channel would discharge
itself with increased force into the harbour. The quay would thus
afford access to vessels for the purpose of landing and embarking
goods, and might communicate with the end of Pitt Street, in the
point where it intersects with Hunter Street. It would be
necessary to purchase two allotments only between O'Connel-street
and Spring Street, to give this new and continued direction to
Pitt Street, and the labour of collecting stone, and depositing
earth for the formation of the quay, would furnish appropriate
labour to the chain-gang, at a very little distance from the
place of their confinement, and subject to the observation of
persons who would feel an interest in stimulating their labour,
as well as in denouncing the connivance of the overseers in their
neglect of it. The other parts of Sydney Cove that from depth of
water and other circumstances are most accessible to shipping,
and most lit for commercial accommodation, are occupied by the
grounds and plantations that surround the government house; a
public walk and terrace have been constructed upon the line of
the shore; and there is not sufficient space between it and the
government grounds to form quays or warehouses, if even it should
be resolved to sacrifice all the improvements that have been
made for the benefit of the public, or the reservation of the
ground that is the most appropriate for the future residence of
the governor. That sacrifice, in the present state of the colony,
I certainly could not venture to recommend, and therefore it
would appear to be more advisable to secure for the public
convenience all other parts of the Cove that are now left
unoccupied or ungranted, and that are most convenient for
commercial purposes, or capable of being made so. The removal of
the large masses of sandstone that impede the access to the
present residence of the naval officer in Sydney Cove would
furnish good materials for the quay that I have proposed, and at
the same time afford room for the construction of another and
more convenient building.</p>
<p>Respecting the wharfage fees, I should propose an alteration
in the mode and rate of charge, by imposing a duty of sixpence
for every five solid feet, by measurement of cargo landed from
each ship, of which four pence should be considered as payable
for the use of the wharfs, and two pence as remuneration to the
wharfingers.</p>
<p>From the great increase that is now taking place in the
population of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, by
emigration from the British dominions, the demand for all kinds
of manufactured goods, but especially of iron and hardware, has
been greatly augmented, and at length appears to have exceeded in
value the ordinary means of remittance. The prices of these
commodities have been liable to great fluctuation; but since the
permission was given for vessels under 350 tons to proceed direct
from England to New South Wales, the supply of manufactured goods
has been more extensive and better suited to the state of the
markets. The price of English goods imported into New South Wales
varies from 60 to 100 per cent. above the prime cost. At former
periods, very large profits were frequently realized, but they
have been latterly reduced by the ordinary effects of enlarged
trade and competition.</p>
<p>At one period, many of the civil officers had engaged so
largely in speculations of this kind, that Governor Macquarie
found it necessary to obtain your Lordship's sanction to the
obligation that Ire afterwards promulgated to them, of making
choice between the pursuit of civil and mercantile occupations;
the latter have always afforded such great temptations of profit,
and although the practice has been openly discontinued, yet it is
known still to exist.</p>
<p>There are now established at Sydney twelve commercial firms
that are importers of goods on their own account, and amongst
these are three conducted by persons who have been convicts. It
has lately become a subject of complaint amongst them, that the
masters of convict-ships are still permitted to land in New South
Wales various articles of merchandise; that they find the means
of embarking, either before they quit the river Thames, or while
they remain at Portsmouth and Cork. This practice has been
invariably prohibited by the instructions of the Navy Board, with
which the masters and the surgeons superintendant are furnished;
and it also constitutes a breach of one of the covenants of the
charter-party entered into by the owners, for which they, as well
as the captain, are liable to be mulcted in part of the freight
on their return to England. With the view to prevent the
embarkation or the landing of any other goods than those that are
allowed by the Navy Board, a list is transmitted to the governor
of New South Wales, and with this notice, he has it in his Power,
but always upon his own responsibility, to prevent the masters of
the convict-ships from landing any other goods. In the year 1818,
an attempt was made by two individuals to seize two convict-ships
that had imported and were lauding goods, either from Rio de
Janeiro, or from England, and after encountering some
difficulties, one of them succeeded in bringing an information
against the ships before the Vice Admiralty Court at Sydney, for
various alleged breaches of the revenue laws; first, in having no
clearance; secondly, for having goods on board that had never
been entered at the custom-house in England, or regularly entered
in any cocket; and lastly, for having disobeyed the orders of the
Navy Board, in embarking goods for which they had given no
permission. The information was dismissed by the court for want
of legal right in the parties to seize either vessel or goods,
the acts of 12 Geo. I. c. 28, and 26 Geo. III. c. 40, having
limited the right of seizing in such cases both to certain local
limits of the British coast, as well as to certain officers of
the customs; and lastly, from want of jurisdiction in the court,
as a court of revenue, to take cognizance of mere disobedience of
the orders of the Navy Board. The seizure was also attempted to
be justified, by considering it an infraction of an order that
had been transmitted by your Lordship to Governor Macquarie, by
which the landing of spirits, goods, wares, or merchandise of any
kind from on board convict transport ships was prohibited.
Several of the inhabitants of the colony had felt that this
prohibition would tend to create a monopoly in favour of the few
importers of goods from England, and would consequently raise
their price; and they immediately presented a memorial to the
governor, in which they prayed him to suspend the effect of your
Lordship's prohibition. Governor Macquarie complied with this
request, and the masters of convict-ships have since been allowed
to land whatever goods they imported, on payment of the same
colonial duties that were paid by other vessels. As long as the
importations of goods front England were confined to a few
vessels, and those of large tonnage, the merchant importers did
not complain of the great interference with their profits that
this concession in favour of the convict-ships occasioned; but,
as the number of these vessels has greatly increased within the
last three years, and that they have eluded the vigilance of the
officers of the customs, or the agents of the Navy Board, by
embarking goods that have far exceeded the amount of the tonnage
that is allowed them, the large importations they have made from
time to time at last became a subject of observation and serious
complaint.</p>
<p>As the masters of the convict-ships pay no freight for the
articles they put on board, they are enabled to undersell those
who import cargoes by merchant vessels.</p>
<p>During my residence in Sydney the merchants brought to my
notice several cases of convict transport ships that were landing
and selling goods to a considerable amount; and stated their
apprehensions of the effect of these investments upon the profits
of those that they were in daily expectation of receiving. I
found, upon inquiry, that these importations were considerable,
and that as the convict-ships never cleared out at the custom
houses in the ports of England or Ireland, they were in the habit
of describing the goods that they brought for sale under the name
of "ship's stores". Many of the articles imported and landed at
Sydney from these vessels did not come under this description,
and had evidently been embarked in evasion or violation of the
orders of the Navy Board, and the laws of the revenue. They
happened to be in great demand at Sydney, at the period in which
they arrived; and especially the important article of iron, which
found a ready sale in the colony. The other articles imported in
the convict-ships were generally disposed of by auction and as no
prohibition appeared to have been made to the landing, or any
other restraint in the disposal of them, than that of selling
them in the ships before they were landed, I did not deem it
necessary, nor indeed did the merchants who complained of this
interference with their profits, seem to wish for any other than
prospective measures for the suppression of the practice. As the
trade between England and New South Wales is now opened to ships
of small tonnage, and as the market is not likely to be affected
in future by the same fluctuations by which it formerly so much
suffered, and by which individuals so much profited, the period
has arrived in which the prohibition against the importation of
goods by convict-ships may be rigidly enforced both in England
and in New South Wales; and it is likewise to be observed, that
the regular importers of goods at Sydney will not be induced to
supply the market if they have to fear a competition with the
masters of the convict-ships in the supply, upon terms so unequal
as those I have described. It is certainly my belief, that the
prohibition can only be effectually put in force by giving all or
any persons in the colony a right to inform against the landing
of any other goods in New South Wales and its dependencies than
such as are enumerated and contained in a list approved by the
Navy Board, or such as consists of provisions and stores put on
board by their order. A legislative enactment, making the act of
landing such goods penal, and subjecting them to forfeiture, will
be necessary to enable the vice-admiralty court at Sydney to take
cognizance of informations brought before it for the breach of
such a regulation.</p>
<p>The facilities that are afforded by the provisions of the Act
of 3 Geo. IV. ch. 45, by which a direct trade in British ships is
permitted between the British colonies, both in the West Indies
and other parts of the world, and any foreign port in Europe or
Africa, Gibraltar, or the island of Malta, are not likely to
augment the exports from New South Wales, or to divert the trade
of the colony from the natural channel that it is destined both
to take and observe, between its own ports and those of the
mother country. The entire coincidence of habits that hitherto
has been little affected by the difference of the climate of the
two countries, %yin long preserve to the manufactures of the
mother country a preference over those of India or China, even
obtained at a cheaper rate.</p>
<p>By affording encouragement to the production of fine wool,
tobacco, and flax in the colony, freight may speedily be
furnished for the return of vessels that carry thither the
English manufactures; and when the removal of the convict
population from the sea-ports, is so far carried into effect as
to admit the inhabitants to a free participation in the whale
fisheries, the exportation of the produce upon equal terms with
that which is procured on the coasts of Newfoundland, will
furnish the inhabitants of New South Wales with an article of
export equally valuable as a means of consignment to the
merchants as of lading to the vessels.</p>
<p>The only articles of export that have hitherto been tried from
New South Wales are those of flour to the Cape of Good Hope,
horses to Batavia, and coals to that port and to Calcutta. In the
first instance, the attempt was made in a colonial vessel, having
a colonial register, but under 350 tons burthen.</p>
<p>The result of the speculation in horses to Batavia was such as
to induce a repetition of it, and the coals of New South Wales,
though found to be inferior in quality to the best English
sea-coal, are likely to find a ready market in the different
ports of Java.</p>
<p>The exportation of these commodities would have been more
frequent, if it had been clearly understood that it was competent
to British vessels to make distinct voyages between places within
the limits of the East India Company's Charter, and to carry on
trade without reference to their original voyage. The
interpretation of a doubtful passage in the Act of 54 Geo. III.
ch. 34, section 1. had prevented, or rather discouraged, British
vessels, even when protected by a license from the East India
Company, from trading between New South Wales and Java, or any
places more to the northward than 11 degrees of south latitude,
and between the 64th and 150th degrees of east longitude from
London. That doubt, however, being now removed, British vessels
have proceeded from New South Wales to Java, and the Island of
Mauritius; but as the Act by which vessels under 350 tons burthen
were permitted to trade to New South Wales confined that
permission to the trade between ports and places in the united
kingdom and New South Wales, I apprehend that it would not now be
competent to any vessel of a less tonnage, either with a colonial
or British register, to trade between New South Wales and Java,
or the places within the peculiar limits of the East India
Company.</p>
<p>This trade, as far as regards the island of Mauritius, the
Cape of Good Hope, and the island of Java, is of great importance
to the colonial interest of New South Wales, for it is to these
places that the first efforts of its commercial marine will be
directed. Small vessels, with registers from the island of
Mauritius, have traded from thence to New South Wales, and
brought cargoes of sugar and spirits, which they have exchanged
for wheat, and it is only in these small vessels that investments
suited to the present demand of markets in New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land, can be advantageously made.</p>
<p>By the 57th Geo. III. c. 1, a power has been reserved to His
Majesty to regulate by order in council, the trade of all his
colonies to the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope, excepting the
possessions of the East India Company. It would be very desirable
therefore that the trade between New South Wales, the island of
Java, and Mauritius, and the Cape of Good Hope, should be opened
to vessels built in the colony of New South Wales or its
dependencies.</p>
<p>An admission of vessels of small tonnage to the trade between
the peculiar limits of the East India Company's charter,
consisting of all places situated on the continent of Asia front
the river Indus to the town of Malacca, and any island under the
government of the company lying to the north of the equator,
would perhaps constitute an interference with their privileges,
which, at the present moment, the company may not be disposed to
concede in favour of the inhabitants of New South Wales; and the
direct communications that have taken place between the colony
and India have proved the difficulty of preventing the escape of
convicts to that territory, and have been the occasion of expense
to its government in sending back those who had effected it. I
observed also, that the lascars employed in the navigation of the
vessels from India, and for whose protection that government has
always shown such an anxious desire to provide, became the
victims of the felonious arts of the convicts, whenever they
landed from their ships in New South Wales or Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>The establishment of the bank of New South Wales in the early
part of the year 1817, has greatly added to the facility of
commercial transactions within the colony.</p>
<p>The evils of a paper circulation, rued upon the credit of
individuals, had become the subject of universal complaint, and
had defied all the measures of restraint or correction that from
time to time had been applied to them.</p>
<p>Supported by the patronage and influence of the local
government several of the inhabitants of the colony met together,
and after agreeing upon the great expediency of establishing a
bank, drew up some rules and regulations, that were submitted to
Governor Macquarie.</p>
<p>Relying upon the assurances of the highest legal authority in
the colony, and with a well grounded conviction, that, unless the
privileges of a chartered incorporation were granted to the
subscribers, their efforts to establish the bank would not be
successful, Governor Macquarie conferred upon them, in a charter
under the seal of the colony, a right of immunity from all risk
or liability beyond the amount of the shares they subscribed. The
bank was declared to be established for the general and customary
uses of deposit, loan and discount, with a sanction to charge
interest at ten per cent. for the same, on a fund or capital
stock of 20,000<i>l</i>. sterling, which was to be raised by
shares of 200<i>l</i>. each. The charter was granted for the term
of seven years; and the subscribers were constituted a body
corporate and joint-stock company, under the name and title of
the "President and Company of the Bank of New South Wales", the
stock being made transferable and with succession, together with
all such powers, rights and capacities as are usually granted to
chartered incorporations.</p>
<p>The charter further declared, that the bank was to be managed
by seven of the proprietors, who were to be called directors; and
who, as well as the president, were to be elected once in every
year by ballot, at a general meeting of the proprietors.</p>
<p>The directors were authorized to issue notes and to declare
dividends, as well as to make regulations and bye-laws for the
management of the business of the bank; with a provision for
their conformity to the principles of the charter, and subject to
the confirmation of the general meeting of the proprietors.</p>
<p>The amount of shares subscribed was 12,600<i>l</i>; and notes
are issued by the bank for 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., 5<i>s</i>. and
10<i>s</i>., 1<i>l</i>. and 5<i>l</i>.; and on the 1st January
1821, the notes in circulation amounted to 5,902<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The rates of dividend declared in the half years of 1819 were
twelve per cent, in the first half year of 1820 nine per cent,
and in the second half year and the first of 1821, they were
reduced to six per cent.</p>
<p>The accounts of the police and orphan funds are kept at the
bank by the treasurers of those funds; and in the year 1820,
deposit of 3,000<i>l</i>. arising from an unappropriated balance
of the police-fund, has made in the bank by order of Governor
Macquarie.</p>
<p>The notes of the bank of New South Wales are received by the
naval officer in payment of duties; and the bank possesses the
means that seem at former periods to have been possessed and
exercised by other capitalists at Sydney, of affording
accommodation to merchants or to masters of convict ships,
wishing to make remittances to England, by the exchange of the
bank paper for government bills.</p>
<p>The notes of the bank of New South Wales have constituted the
largest portion of the circulating medium of the colony, since
the suppression of those issued by Mr. Deputy Commissary General
Drennan for purchases made on account of government.</p>
<p>The return to the mode of payment in store receipts by the
commissariat department in August 1820, for their purchases of
grain and meat, was highly favourable to the transactions of the
bank in the colony, for it enabled them to make their own notes
exchangeable at all times or nearly so, with bills upon the lords
of the treasury.</p>
<p>By the statement rendered to me of the affairs of the bank in
the month of February 1821, it appeared that the amount of bank
notes then known to be in circulation, was 5,902<i>l</i>.; and
that the amount of the commissary's bills on the treasury, that
they held, was 22,427<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>.; and that of store
receipts, for which bills could be demanded, 19,405<i>l</i>.
1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.; and of securities on mortgage,
4,172<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The bank paper thus afforded a convenient circulating medium
for the internal transactions of the colony, and enabled the
poorer classes of settlers, who received store receipts in
payment for the grain and meat they had supplied to the King's
stores, to break the amount of them, and to reserve a portion of
that amount for the supply of their future wants, as they
occurred.</p>
<p>In consequence of an order issued by Governor Macquarie on the
23d December 1816, the notes of the bank, as well as other notes
issued in New South Wales, could only be issued for the payment
of money in sterling, and the notes of the bank express an
obligation to that effect.</p>
<p>Their notes have hitherto been convertible into bills upon the
lords of the treasury, not from any obligation expressed in the
charter or the regulations of the bank, but because the
government expenditure in the colony, and the bill sand store
receipts given in payment for it, had continued to supply the
inhabitants with ample and convenient means of remittance to
England, or of payment to the importers for the articles they had
occasion to purchase.</p>
<p>Mr. Deputy Commissary General Drennan sometimes made payments
in dollars at 5<i>s</i>. each, as well as in his own notes, and
the bank also issued them when they were required at the same
nominal value. They also received them again at that rate, and
gave bills for them on the Lords of the Treasury. The quantity of
specie, however, in circulation in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land was very small in comparison with the paper
currency, consisting of the bank notes and bills of individuals.
By the return furnished me in February 1821, the amount of
Spanish dollars in the bank was 1,625<i>l</i>.; of cut dollars,
2,525<i>l</i>. and of the cut silver pieces, 312<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Although the bank does not appear to have suffered from the
extensive accommodation it afforded in the years 1818 and 1819,
yet instances of mercantile failure occurred that were traceable
to the credit that had been obtained through its means; and a
spirit of speculation was also kept up, that had an influence on
the prices of commodities in so small a market.</p>
<p>The bills discounted by the bank amounted in the year 1817 to
12,193<i>l</i>.; in 1818, to 81,672<i>l</i>.; in 1819, to
107,256<i>l</i>.; and in 1820, to 98,498<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The direction of the affairs of the bank of New South Wales
has been principally conducted by Mr. J. T. Campbell the
president, partly from the confidence reposed in him by the
directors, and partly from his having resided more constantly in
Sydney, than any other member of the direction.</p>
<p>The duty of superintendence, or of examination of the accounts
and cash, does not seem to have been cast upon him in a more
especial manner than upon the others; but from the interest which
he felt and possessed in the bank, he was induced to devote as
large a portion of his time as he could spare from the other and
more laborious duties of his office of secretary to Governor
Macquarie.</p>
<p>The office of cashier of the bank had been, at a later period,
intrusted to a person who was strongly recommended for his
knowledge of business and his integrity. In the course of the
year 1820, the directors had reason to be dissatisfied with the
conduct of this person, and he had notice that after a certain
period, which would be given for the purpose of making up his
accounts, his services would no longer be required. It appeared
that during this interval, as well as for some time previous to
it, a sufficient examination had not been made of the contents of
the bank chest, and that in the month of January 1821, a deficit
in the cash balance was discovered to the amount of
12,100<i>l</i>. and upwards. It was found that the cashier had
been in the habit of affording accommodation to several persons
in Sydney, by giving credit for payments which were never made by
them. A particular examination of the manner in which this
accommodation was afforded, was commenced at Sydney previous to
my departure, but the result as far as affected the individual
was not known. As far as it concerned the bank, the directors
apprehended that it would be attended with a loss of not less
than 6,000<i>l</i>. or one half of their capital; but that the
security of the establishment, and its credit with the public,
would remain unshaken.</p>
<p>As the charter of the bank of New South Wales has never
received the royal sanction, and as the provisions it contains
did not meet your Lordship's approbation, it has hitherto stood
upon no other authority than that of the governor.</p>
<p>Fortunately no necessity has existed of resorting to the
protection, from the responsibility of common commercial
partnerships, that the charter was intended to convey. The
original authority for this protection, or indeed for any other
power that the charter conveyed, was never questioned in the
colony; and a belief of its existence contributed both to the
original formation of the bank, and to the support it has
subsequently received. I have already stated that whatever defect
may have existed in the original regulations of the bank, the
object of the establishment, in substituting a paper currency of
sterling value, and convertible into cash or government bills,
for the unrestrained issues of promissory notes made by
individuals in the colony, was highly beneficial.</p>
<p>The annual amount of paper discounted by the bank for
individuals appears to have been considerable, but very few
instances have occurred in which the accommodation thus afforded
by the bank has been improvidently or incautiously extended;
while the loans that have been made by them on landed securities
have afforded salutary aid, and have not much exceeded the
inconsiderable amount of 4,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Whilst, however, I bear testimony to the utility of this
establishment, I cannot be insensible to the consequences of
insufficient control that a chartered immunity from the ordinary
risks of commercial partnership has a tendency to produce; and
the circumstance to which I have already had occasion to allude,
will afford some proof of the expediency of leaving both the
credit and the management of the bank of New South Wales upon
that footing upon which it was your Lordship's determination that
it should be placed, and for publicly withdrawing from it
altogether all pledge of royal authority or sanction.</p>
<p>The term for which the present charter was granted will expire
on the 12th of February 1824; and from the benefits that have
already been experienced from it in the colony, I do not think
that any difficulty will be experienced in combining both
sufficient funds and sufficient security amongst the mercantile
and landed interests in New South Wales, for the establishment of
another bank, without the necessity of resorting to the
protection of a royal charter of incorporation.</p>
<p>The amount of debt recorded in the office of the judge
advocate, and secured by mortgages registered since the
commencement of the year 1817, appears by a return made by his
clerk to be 34,050<i>l</i>. This sum, however, falls very short
of the amount of debt for which antecedent securities have been
given on other and more private documents, in the shape of bonds
bearing a heavy interest. The rate of interest established in the
colony by the authority of Governor King was eight per cent,
since that period the rate given in ordinary transactions has
been ten per cent, and since the allowance of that rate in the
bank charter, it has been considered to have received the
authority of the governor, and to the extent that such authority
could be conferred. There does not appear however to exist any
local reason for continuing the rate of interest in the colony
beyond seven per cent, and I should beg leave to recommend that a
legislative declaration should be made to that effect,
accompanied with the penalties of the law of usury for taking any
larger rate.</p>
<p>As the commercial transactions of the colony have much
increased of late, and as cases have occurred in which the
necessity of judicial interference in the regulation and
distribution of insolvents estates has been much required, I
should recommend that amongst the new legislative enactments that
I have had the honour of submitting to your Lordship's
consideration, one should be introduced, by which the court of
civil jurisdiction shall have the power of summoning the
creditors of any person whose debts and effects shall appear to
be attached, and shall not be found sufficient to play twenty
shillings in the pound, and to declare the insolvency of such
person. A further power should be given to the court (after the
choice of an assignee for the collection of the property has been
made and approved, and the recovery of the debts of the insolvent
has been effected) to make a rateable distribution of the
proceeds. The court should also, with the consent of two-thirds
in number and value of the creditors, have the power of giving a
certificate to persons who, after affording full explanation of
their affairs, shall have appeared to have conducted them with
integrity and honest dealing, and not to have been guilty of
extravagance or fraudulent preference in the payment of their
creditors, and that the effect of this certificate should be a
bar to all actions commenced before the declaration of
insolvency.</p>

<h3><i>State of the Ecclesiastical Establishments in New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> ecclesiastical establishment in New South
Wales, in the year 1820, consisted of a senior chaplain resident
at Paramatta, two chaplains at Sydney, one at Windsor, one at
Castlereagh, one at Liverpool, and one in the district of Airds.
An assistant chaplain had also proceeded to reside at
Newcastle.</p>
<p>The establishment at Van Diemen's Land consisted of a chaplain
at Hobart Town, and one at Launceston.</p>
<p>The chaplains on their arrival in New South Wales have
received their nomination to the different chaplaincies from
Governor Macquarie; and by an order issued by him on the 15th
September 1810, they were enjoined to consider themselves at all
times under the immediate control and superintendence of the
principal chaplain, and were to make such occasional reports to
him, respecting their clerical duties, as he might think proper
to require or call for. It appears, however, that on certain
occasions Governor Macquarie has deemed it expedient to regulate
the clerical duties of the chaplains, either in restraining the
use of prayers not authorized by the strict forms of the liturgy
of the church of England, or by enjoining the introduction and
promulgation of certain public orders of a secular nature, which
he conceived might be usefully impressed upon the minds of the
people by communication during the hours of divine service.</p>
<p>The districts into which the ecclesiastical functions were
distributed have never been specifically described, but they
appear to have been fixed in those wherein the population was
most concentrated.</p>
<p>The clerical ditties at Sydney were increased by the
performance of those of garrison chaplain; and the duties that
devolved upon the Reverend Mr. Cartwright, during his residence
at Windsor, were much augmented by the distance of the several
districts from that town, and the difficulties of communication
that occurred from the passage of the river Hawkesbury in the
periods of inundation.</p>
<p>From the rapid increase of the population in New South Wales,
and it may also be added from some improvement in the religious
feelings of the inhabitants, the attendance at church has of late
been more regular, and the accommodation has been found
insufficient. The church at Sydney, named St. Philip, will not
accommodate 800 persons during the utter season with convenience;
and the addition of another church was in every point of view
desirable. The new church of St. James was nearly covered in at
the end of the year 1820, and must soon after have been in a
state to admit the attendance of the convicts; and the gallery of
St. Philip's church would then be capable of receiving part of
the free population. The church of St. Philip was begun during
the administration of Governor Bligh, and was finished soon after
the arrival of Governor Macquarie. It is built on the side of a
hill, and from want of care in laying the original foundations,
or in protecting them afterwards, the wall that is nearest to the
hill is much weakened. The church has latterly received some
repairs and internal decorations; and by attention to the state
of the foundations, it may be preserved from decay. The church of
St. James is placed nearly on a line with the convict barrack in
Hyde Park, and was formerly destined for a court-house. For
reasons that I have before adverted to its destination was
changed; and although the line of the foundation has projected
too much upon the street to which it fronts, and the general
effect of the building has been somewhat disturbed by its change
of destination, yet it will upon the whole have a respectable
appearance; and the manner in which the brick-work has been
finished, reflects credit upon the skill and perseverance of the
colonial architect, Mr. Greenway.</p>
<p>The church at Paramatta is built of stone, and was the first
that was finished in the colony. It contains nearly 400 persons,
but until lately was badly ventilated. Some late additions have
been made to the chancel, by which more accommodation has been
obtained, and two steeples have been added to the opposite end of
the church.</p>
<p>Two new churches have very lately been finished at Windsor and
Liverpool and a school-house has been built in the township of
Castlereagh, that affords sufficient accommodation at present for
the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>At Wilberforce and Richmond the school-houses were applied to
the same purposes, on alternate Sundays, by the chaplains of
Castlereagh and Windsor.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie proposed to establish a chaplaincy at
Campbell Town twelve miles beyond Liverpool, in the district of
Airds; and I think that it will be found advisable to establish
another in the district of Lower Minto, in or near to which there
is no school, and the inhabitants are placed at a distance of
twelve or fourteen miles from any place of religious worship.
Since the arrival in the colony of two clergymen of the Roman
Catholic religion, the inhabitants professing that faith have
attended the celebration of maw, either at the court-house at
Sydney or at the houses of individuals in Paramatta, Windsor and
Liverpool. They were required to give notice to the magistrates
of place and hours of their meeting, with a view to the proper
attendance of the convicts but as no separate place had been
provided for the latter at the court-house at Sydney, it was not
deemed proper by the commanding officer of the 48th regiment to
allow those of his men who were Catholics to attend mass.</p>
<p>A subscription was commenced by the Catholics in New South
Wales, prior to my departure, to build a chapel at Sydney, and
Governor Macquarie had promised to give them an allotment of
ground for the purpose. I observed, that although some difference
of opinion arose amongst the Catholics themselves respecting the
situation of the allotment, and the preference that had been
given to the town of Sydney, yet a very liberal disposition was
manifested by them to defray the expense of the work, and it also
met a still more liberal encouragement from the higher classes of
the Protestants.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Methodists have built and opened places of
meeting at Sydney, Paramatta and Windsor; and at the latter town
I observed that a Sunday school for children was established, and
that the attendance and management were very creditable to the
conductor of it.</p>
<p>The new church at Hobart Town was opened in the year 1819, and
the interior was finished in the year 1820. It is respectable in
appearance, but the workmanship especially the building of the
walls, is defective. It is estimated to contain nearly 1,000
persons.</p>
<p>Some place of worship as well as of interment is much wanted
in the district of Pitt Water, on account of its distance from
Hobart Town, and from its increasing population. The assistance
of another clergyman will also be desirable in that district, on
account of the increasing age and infirmity of the present
chaplain at Hobart Town. At Launceston a temporary wooden
building had been appropriated to the performance of divine
worship on Sundays, and the resident chaplain also proceeded
occasionally to George Town. With the exception of Bathurst, all
the principal stations were supplied with some means of
performing divine service; and I feel myself bound to state, that
in every one of them the chaplains displayed the utmost zeal in
the performance of their pastoral duties. At Sydney those that
devolved upon the Rev. Mr. Cowper must have been very extensive
and laborious until they were shared by the Rev. Mr. Hill, who
arrived in the year 1819; and these gentlemen have neglected no
opportunities of extending the influence of their sacred duties,
by frequent visits to the houses of the poorer classes and to the
hospitals and the gaol.</p>
<p>At Paramatta and Windsor, the Rev. Mr. Marsden and Mr.
Cartwright have been equally attentive to the performance of
their duties, although both have undertaken those of magistrates;
and the time of Mr. Marsden has also been much occupied by the
business of the missions that he conducted, by the
superintendence of the building of the female orphan school at
Paramatta, and by the construction of a water mill and wind-mill
in the immediate neighbourhood. Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Marsden
had also been engaged in agricultural pursuits, that have
afforded more occupation to their time than augmentation to their
fortunes. In the previous and even in the present state of the
colony, the possession of a portion of land, however small, to
those who live in the country, is an object of importance for the
supply of domestic wants; and as no glebe was attached to the
chaplaincy of Windsor the Rev. Mr. Cartwright found himself under
the necessity of hiring a farm in the neighbourhood; and as the
residence provided at that place was small and inconvenient, he
removed to his farm, upon which he continued to reside until he
was appointed to Liverpool.</p>
<p>There are now good houses of residence assigned at Paramatta,
Sydney, Castlereagh and Liverpool to the clergymen at those
places; and it was the intention of Governor Macquarie to build
one at Windsor, and to convert the present residence of the
chaplain into a court-house. At Hobart Town no residence had been
provided for the chaplain; but at Launceston the Rev. Mr. Youl
resided in the government house until the parsonage-house at
George Town was finished. At the former place the people had been
little accustomed to the performance of any religious duty, from
want of a proper place for the celebration of divine service; and
until the arrival of Mr. Youl, in the year 1820, no religious
rite of any kind had been performed.</p>
<p>The attendance at the church at Sydney is numerous on Sunday
mornings, but very thin on the evenings of that day.</p>
<p>The congregation at Paramatta appeared to me to be more
respectable and attentive than at the other places of worship;
and the choral parts of the service were admirably performed by
singers, some of whom are free, and some have been convicts, and
who had been taught under the directions of the Rev. Mr. Marsden.
The persons who officiate as clerks at all the churches were
formerly convicts, and they receive rations from the store, and
fees on baptisms, burials and marriages. The sextons are also
appointed from the same class of persons, and receive a similar
remuneration.</p>
<p>The burial ground at Sydney has been lately removed to a
distance of a mile and a half from the residence of the chaplain,
but this measure was rendered necessary from the inconvenient
situation of the old burying ground, which, as well as the new
one has been surrounded with a high wall. That of Paramatta was
open to the street, and the fence unrepaired.</p>
<p>The churches in New South Wales are not sufficiently provided
with large Bibles and Prayer Books, and I should recommend that
six sets should be sent out from this country, together with
Prayer Books of a less size, for the communion service.</p>
<p>Communion plate is likewise requisite at all the churches, and
decent ornament for the pulpits and communion tables, except at
Sydney, where they had latterly been provided under the direction
of the chief engineer. At Hobart Town the church is already
supplied with the Bibles and church plate, that were sent out
with the expedition under Colonel Paterson, that was ordered to
take possession of Port Philip, from whence its direction was
changed to Fort Dalrymple. At Launceston it will be necessary to
provide a set of Bibles and Prayer Books, and church plate.</p>
<p>The principal establishments for the education of youth of
both sexes, are those of the male and female orphan schools. The
former was established by Governor Macquarie on the 1st of
January 1819, soon after the removal of the female orphans from
the house that had been long occupied by them in George-street,
Sydney, to a more commodious building at Arthur's Hill, about one
mile from Paramatta. The house of the male orphan school
underwent some repairs at that period, but it is placed in a bad
situation; and the garden below it is contiguous to the swampy
bank of the rivulet that discharges itself into Sydney Cove. The
school is under the direction of a person who was strongly
recommended by the Rev. Mr. Marsden, and came to the colony by
his persuasion. The object of the institution, as declared in the
rules and regulations that were published in the year 1819, is
"To relieve, protect and provide with lodging, clothing, food,
and a suitable degree of plain education, and instruction in some
mechanical art, poor, unprotected male orphan children." The
management of the school, the admission of the boys, and the
examination of their progress, and of the quarterly accounts of
the expenditure, are entrusted to a committee named by Governor
Macquarie, and consisting of the lieutenant-governor, the judge
advocate, the judge of the supreme court, the secretary to
government, the principal chaplain, the senior assistant
chaplain, Mr. J. Palmer, and Mr. Hannibal M&lsquo;Arthur; of
these, the principal chaplain acted as treasurer, and Mr. J. T.
Campbell as secretary. The number of boys that had been admitted
into the orphan school from the 1st January 1819 to the 15th
January 1821, amounted to sixty-three; of whom one had died, and
four had been discharged. The boys were taught to read and write,
and the plain rules of arithmetic, according to the system
pursued in the national schools of England; and their progress,
though creditable to the superintendence of Mr. Bowden the
master, had been much assisted by the later instructions of the
Rev. Mr. Reddall, who was specially appointed by your Lordship to
introduce the system into the schools of New South Wales. Upon
the retirement of Mr. Reddall into the country, I suggested to
the committee that he should be allowed to take with him some of
the boys who had made greater in the system, with a view to
become teachers in the other schools; but this proposition,
though supported by Governor Macquarie, did not appear to the
committee to be then advisable. In addition to the elementary
instruction that the boys receive, they are taught the trades of
shoemakers and tailors, and in their hours of exercise to work in
the garden. The establishment consists of a master, who receives
an annual salary of 100<i>l</i>. sterling paid from the
parliamentary grant; an assistant, who receives 10<i>l</i>. per
annum from the orphan funds; a tailor, cook, gardener, and
washerwoman, who are convicts and who also receive the same
wages. The annual amount of expenditure for the subsistence and
clothing of each boy is 16<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>.; and the gross
amount, including expenses of every kind, is 22<i>l</i>.
9<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. Very few of the boys who have hitherto been
received into the school are orphans, nor do the regulations
require that they should be so. They are the children of persons
whose indigent circumstances, or whose abandoned characters, have
left them without means of existence in their parents' houses. It
is intended that on or before the age of fifteen the boys should
be apprenticed to mechanics or to farmers under indentures.</p>
<p>The female orphan school was established by Governor King, who
made a grant of 1,500 acres of land, near Paramatta, to three
persons in trust for the support, it education, and benefit of
female orphan children. Until the year 1819 the school continued
to be kept at Sydney; and although the foundation of the present
building at Arthur's Hill, near Paramatta, was laid on the 25th
September 1813, it was not finished until the 27th June 1818. The
direction of this work was committed to Mr. Marsden, and
accompanied by a plan and elevation for the house. Want of funds,
difficulties in obtaining workmen, and the irregular conduct of
those who were employed, appear to have caused delay in the
completion of the work. The building stands upon the bank of the
Paramatta River, at some distance from the public road, and
perfectly accessible from the shore of the river. The land
attached to it has been lately divided and fenced, and some
attempt has been made to clear it of timber, and prepare it for
cultivation. It was the opinion of persons experienced in the
agriculture of New South Wales, that the land would not repay the
expense incurred in this attempt. A plan had been recommended,
and was under consideration at the period of my departure, for
the improvement and extension of the principal building, as well
as the offices, which were both inconvenient and
ill-constructed.</p>
<p>In the month of February 1821, the school contained sixty
girls, eight (who were apprentices) placed for the purpose of
learning domestic employments, and two assistants, who had been
formerly brought up in the school. They are all taught to read
and write, ciphering and needle work; and their progress and
attainments were represented to me by the ladies of the local
committee, who were most in the habit of visiting the school, to
equal those of children of the same class in England; but they
were of opinion, that it would be expedient to make some change
in the general system of their education, and to adapt it more
nearly to their future condition in the colony, either as wives
or domestic servants. The matron who superintended it was a
person of respectability, the wife of a convict who resided in
the house, and who assisted also in its management. A local
committee of ladies, appointed by the governor, appeared to take
an active interest in the affairs of the school, and greatly
contributed to its welfare.</p>
<p>It appears from the books of the institution, which in the
earlier periods of it had been very irregularly kept, that since
the year 1801, the date of its establishment, two hundred and
seventeen children had been admitted, and of those eighty-eight
had been apprenticed, five had been married, and the rest had
either been discharged or remained as scholars.</p>
<p>The expenses of the female orphan school, from the 1st January
to the 31st December 1820, amounted to 2,064<i>l</i>. 9<i>s</i>.
11<i>d</i>.; from which, after deducting the expenses of
improvements on the land, servants wages, and their subsistence,
amounting to 628<i>l</i>. 18<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., there would
remain the sum of 1,435<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>. as the annual
expense of the establishment, not including the sum of
100<i>l</i>. charged upon the parliamentary grant for the salary
of the matron: the annual charge for the support, dandling and
subsistence of each child would amount to 21<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>.
2<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The funds of this institution originally consisted of
one-eighth part of the duties received on importations, and of
the profits derived from a herd of cattle that had been purchased
from the government in the year 1816. The Reverend Mr. Marsden
declined accepting the percentage that was offered him on the
receipts by the trustees, and requested that it might be applied
to the purchase of cattle for the benefit of the institution.</p>
<p>The cattle were placed on the farm near Paramatta, but having
been removed to another part of the country during the drought of
1816, without having been previously marked, many were lost; and
the stock belonging to the institution now amounts only to 165
head.</p>
<p>The farm, though consisting of 1,500 acres of land in a good
situation, has not been made productive. There was only one
enclosure upon it, and a small house in a bad situation; and from
the neglect of the herdsman and superintendent, the cattle of
adjoining settlers were permitted to range upon it.</p>
<p>The attention of the committee had been called to the state of
this part of the property of the institution, and they were
proceeding to take measures for its improvement.</p>
<p>The accounts of the treasurer of the institution are audited
and examined every quarter by the committee; and the sanction of
a local committee is now required to all purchases made for the
expenses of the establishment, and for improvements at the farm.
A report of the proceedings and resolutions of the committee is
required to be laid before the governor, as patron, after every
quarterly meeting.</p>
<p>The share of the duties originally appropriated to the support
of this institution having greatly increased, Governor Macquarie
authorized the appropriation of them to the support of the male
orphan school.</p>
<p>Payments are likewise made from the same fund in support of
the schools established in the different districts. The share of
duties so appropriated is paid over by the naval officer every
quarter to the treasurer of the institution, who pays the drafts
made upon him for the expenses when audited by the committee.</p>
<p>In the month of February 1818, the Reverend Mr. Marsden was
requested by the committee to lodge the balances in his bands, as
well as all future ones belonging to the institution, in the bank
of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Previous to this period they had been kept by him in the hands
of a respectable commercial firm the town Of Sydney; and it is
only due to them, as well as to Mr. Marsden, to state that his
orders upon them were always considered as cash, and were of
equal credit with the government paper. At a former period, it
also appears that Mr. Marsden was in advance to the institution
from his own funds to the amount of 477<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>. the
notes that had been placed in his hands by the naval officer
being found irrecoverable, and there being no disposable balance
in the hands of the treasurer of the police-fund.</p>
<p>Two schools at Sydney are under the immediate protection of
the government; and conducted by individuals sent out from
England for the purpose. The first and largest of these is
conducted by W. Smith, who receives a salary of 100<i>l</i>.
Sixty-six boys and thirty-four girls were taught in this school
in the month of January 1821, according to the national system,
to read, write and cipher. The situation of the school and the
building were very inconvenient; and the latter in a state of
dilapidation, the attendance of the scholars irregular, and
little progress appeared to have been made by them. The second
school at Sydney is attended by thirty-seven boys and fifty
girls. A rent of 10<i>l</i>. per annum is paid for the
school-room, and the progress of the children was creditable, but
their attendance irregular.</p>
<p>A school is established at Paramatta, that is attended by the
children of the middle classes of the inhabitants. The master has
a salary of 60<i>l</i>. per annum, and receives payments from the
parents of his scholars, varying from 12<i>s</i>. to 1<i>l</i>.
per quarter: both the house and school are the property of
government, and are in good repair.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there is a school at Kissing Point and
at Pennant Hills; the former attended by fifteen scholars, the
latter only by two. In the other towns and districts there are
ten schools, in which the masters receive a salary generally
amounting to 15<i>l</i>. per annum, with rations from the store,
and a small emolument from the parents of the scholars.</p>
<p>The school for the civilization of the native black children
is situated in the town of Paramatta. It was established in the
year 1814 by Governor Macquarie, with the commendable view of
endeavouring to improve the condition of the natives of New South
Wales; a superintendent was appointed, and the number of children
was not allowed at first to exceed six of each sex. A committee
consisting of Mr. J. T. Campbell, Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth, Mr. W.
Redfern, Mr. Hannibal M&lsquo;Arthur, the Rev. Mr. Cowper, the
Rev. Mr. Fulton, and Mr. R. Hassal, were appointed by Governor
Macquarie to conduct and direct all the affairs of the
institution, to hold quarterly meetings, audit the accounts,
examine into the condition and progress of the scholars, and to
make a report thereof to the governor. An account was submitted
to me of the number, names and attainments of the children that
have been received into the institution since its establishment;
and it appears that thirty-seven boys and twenty-seven girls have
been placed in it, and of these, six have absconded, two have
died, and one was taken by his father to reside upon some land
that was given to him. These children have been taught to read
and write, and have been instructed in the principles of the
Christian religion. They also attend church regularly at
Paramatta, and join in the service. The girls have been taught
the common sorts of needle-work and domestic service, and two
have been hired out as servants to respectable inhabitants in the
country.</p>
<p>From the experiment that has been made at this establishment,
no doubt can be entertained of the natural opacities of the
native black children, and their power of attaining the means of
improving their condition. It yet remains to be proved, whether
the habits they acquire in the schools are permanent. In the mean
time, the effort that has been made is very creditable to
Governor Macquarie; and the meeting that he has annually held
with the chiefs and black natives that are nearest to the settled
districts, has tended in some degree to conciliate them. It has
not, however, had the effect of subduing their reluctance to
allow their children to be taken into the native institution; and
I did not observe that the meeting between the parents and the
children on these occasions awakened any sympathy or emotion.</p>
<p>By one of the returns that was furnished by the Rev. Mr. Hill,
who is now secretary to the several institutions that I have
mentioned, the annual expense of the maintenance, instruction and
clothing of each of the native black children amounts to the sum
of 15<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>From the same returns, it appears that the number of boys
educated at schools established and provided by the government
amounts to 291, and of girls to 243.</p>
<p>By a return furnished me by the Rev. Mr. Cowper of the number
of children attending schools at Sydney not supported by the
government, it appears that there are eleven, in which 192 boys
are taught, and 118 girls; and at the regimental school of the
48th regiment, there are 25 boys and 26 girls: giving a total
amount of 508 children of both sexes who are receiving
instruction in the town of Sydney, and 990 in the colony of New
South Wales. It is further observed by the Rev. Mr. Cowper, that
the number of the children now receiving instruction at Sydney
does not exceed that which existed there in the year 1813; and
when compared with the total number of children in the colony, as
returned by the musters of 1821, and amounting to 7,568, the
disproportion appears still more disadvantageous.</p>
<p>In the attempt that was made by the Rev. Mr. Reddall to
introduce the national system of instruction into the first
school at Sydney, he found that the attendance of the children
was very irregular; and upon inquiry he also found, that although
the parents did not forbid the attendance of their children, yet
that they were too frequently in a state that rendered them
incapable of compelling it. The same complaint was made to me by
most of the schoolmasters in the country districts; and as the
habitations and farms of the settlers are much dispersed, the
distances that the children had to come to attend these schools,
were the causes of frequent absences and interruption.</p>
<p>It is stated by Mr. Cartwright, and the observation was
confirmed by that of other persons, that there was no want of
inclination in the parents, generally, to educate their children,
whatever might be the irregularity of their own lives. It will
therefore become an object of importance so to extend the system
of education in the districts, and even in the towns of New South
Wales, that as little control as possible shall be left to the
parents over the time, the habits, or disposition of their
children.</p>
<p>It was the intention of Governor Macquarie, when I left the
colony, to build, with as much expedition as possible, a new
school, in which the national system of instruction could be
taught. During my absence at Van Diemen's Land in 1820, the
foundation of a school, upon an enlarged plan, was laid in a
space of ground adjoining that on which the new church of St.
James was built. They were placed much too near each other; and
when the plan was submitted to the Rev. Mr. Reddall, he was of
opinion that the disposition of the rooms was by no means
calculated for the object of teaching according to the national
system. The school-house was then converted into a court-house,
and a new plan was submitted by Mr. Greenway the colonial
architect, which appeared to me to possess a defect common to all
his plans, of making too great a sacrifice of time and labour to
the purposes of ornament and effect.</p>
<p>The person who now conducts the government school at Sydney
did not appear to me to be qualified for the task, but he was
fortunate enough to have a son who rendered him great assistance,
and indeed had the principal management of the school. The
addition therefore of a schoolmaster, well instructed in the
central school in London, would be very desirable at Sydney,
under an impression that the school-house that was intended to be
built there must be in a state of great forwardness or be
entirely completed.</p>
<p>Although there is much to commend in the conduct of the male
orphan school at Sydney, yet the situation is confined and the
capacity of the house insufficient.</p>
<p>Considering the difficulty that is found in enforcing a
regular attendance of the children, I should venture to recommend
that a central school should be established on the estate that I
have already mentioned as belonging to the female orphans near
Paramatta, and that it should be large enough to contain 300 boys
under fifteen years of age. They should be instructed, according
to the national system, in reading writing and arithmetic, and in
their hours of exercise they should be taught the employments to
which they will be first called when they return to the houses of
their parents.</p>
<p>Upon the same estate, and at a short distance from the school,
I should recommend that there should be established a farm for
the instruction of a certain number of colonial youths, from the
age of fifteen to twenty, in which they should be taught the
cultivation and fencing of land, and more especially the
management of sheep and cattle. The laborious part of clearing
and burning off timber should first he performed by the labour of
convicts, and the farm should afterwards be worked by one
superintendent and two assistants, who possessed a competent
knowledge of agriculture, as Well as experience in those modes
that have been found most beneficial in the colony. With the
instruction of the young men, it would be practicable to combine
some profit in the sale of the produce, or in the supply of grain
and meat for their daily subsistence; and, if conducted with
proper economy, the expenses of an establishment of this nature
ought not to exceed the expenses of 1,000<i>l</i>. per annum,
allowing an annual expense of 15<i>l</i>. for each boy, and the
sum of 100<i>l</i>. per annum for a superintendent, and
50<i>l</i>. to each of the assistants.</p>
<p>The object of both these establishments should be directed to
the effectual separation of as many children as possible from
their parents in the lower classes of the inhabitants, and early
instruction in those habits by which their future exertions may
be rendered profitable.</p>
<p>At present the bad system of farming that has been pursued by
the convict parent is taught and transmitted to his son; and as
long as land can be procured or purchased in the colony at a
cheap rate, the sons of the present lower orders of settlers
would prefer a miserable existence upon the land granted to the
parents, to that of serving as labourers or overseers on the
farms of more opulent inhabitants. With better instruction in
agriculture than it is now possible for them to attain, they
would become most useful members of the community; and even at
the present moment, instances are not wanting to prove the value
of their early proficiency, their intelligence, and their moral
habits.</p>
<p>In removing the male orphan school to the neighbourhood of
Paramatta, much advantage will be gained by its central position,
while it will afford at the same time the means of easy access
and frequent inspection. In the first instance it may not be
desirable to augment the numbers of the school to 300, or even to
prepare a building equal to the reception and accommodation of
that number; but I would only observe, that in the formation of
such an establishment, it does not appear to be necessary to
constrict the buildings of stone or brick, except in laying the
foundations, and raising them very slightly above the
surface.</p>
<p>With a view to connect religious instruction with the
education of the children, I should recommend that a clergyman of
the church of England should be appointed to the general
superintendence of the establishment, with a salary of
200<i>l</i>. per annum; and that he should be enjoined to pursue
the system of religious instruction that now prevails in the
national schools of England, with a further view to its general
adoption in the other schools of New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the two Catholic clergymen in New South
Wales, a mall school for the instruction of the children of Roman
Catholics has been established at Paramatta; but it appears that
before that period they had been admitted into the orphan and
other schools of the colony, without any reference to their
religious creed, or without objection on the part of their
parents.</p>
<p>In the towns of Windsor and Liverpool, the population is
sufficiently large to require some improvement in the system of
instruction that now prevails there. It is only at one school in
Sydney that the national system is taught; and I fear that the
Rev. Mr. Reddall, to whom the task was committed of instructing
adults in the art of teaching it, had not sufficient time or
opportunity to carry that Purpose into effect. Schoolmasters,
therefore, competent to teach it are required both at Windsor and
Liverpool. Elementary school-books were also much wanted at all
the schools; and I should strongly recommend that a supply should
be forwarded in some of the convict ships, addressed in the first
instance to the governor, who, by means of chaplains, will have
opportunities of distributing them in the quarters where they are
most required. Bibles and Prayer-books and religious tracts have
been supplied by the liberality of the Bible societies; but books
of elementary instruction have always been scarce in the colony,
dear, and badly preserved.</p>
<p>The Female Orphan Institution is one from which the greatest
benefits may be derived to the community in New South Wales, both
in withdrawing young females from the presence and bad example of
their parents, and affording them that instruction and those
habits that they cannot be expected to acquire under the parental
roof.</p>
<p>Much strictness is found requisite to enforce obedience
amongst the children of the Female Orphan School, and their
tempers and dispositions are not very easily controlled.</p>
<p>A female superintendent is required for the establishment; and
it is very desirable that she should be married, and well skilled
in the business of instruction, and of an active and energetic
character. Her husband may be very beneficially employed in the
superintendence of the farm, and should receive a salary of
50<i>l</i>. per annum, as a substitute for all other allowances
or emoluments whatever.</p>
<p>The establishment of Sunday schools has for some time existed
for the instruction, or rather for inducing the attendance of
children at the churches on Sundays. At Paramatta, I found that
considerable numbers of the children who attended the government
schools during the week were assembled in the church, and
instructed by teachers, and occasionally superintended and
assisted by the members of Mr. Marsden's family.</p>
<p>A society was attempted to be formed by certain individuals in
Sydney and Paramatta in support of Sunday schools, in which the
principal chaplain did not concur, conceiving that it was not
necessary, and that the attempt implied a reflection on the
clergy of the established church. The opposition made by Mr.
Marsden had its influence on the members who composed the
society, and the Sunday schools at Sydney have not since met with
support.</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land two schoolmasters are appointed and paid
by the local government, and the arrival of one capable of
introducing the national system was expected.</p>
<p>At the government school at Hobart Town there were thirty-five
boys educated, and twenty-four girls; and at two other schools in
the town that had been kept by convicts, and who had latterly
been dismissed for offences, there were twenty-five boys and
twenty-one girls; another school was then established by a free
person that contained eighteen boys.</p>
<p>At Clarence Plains, Pitt Water and Humphries River, schools
were established, in which altogether fifty-one children were
taught to read and write.</p>
<p>These schools in the districts were kept by convicts, who had
rations from the King's store, and received a trifling
remuneration, paid in grain, from the parents to the children.
The total number of the children instructed amounted to 150,
exclusive, both here and in New South Wales, of those that
received private tuition from persons who have been assigned as
convicts, and taught in the families in which they resided.</p>
<p>At Launceston, the schoolmaster paid by the local government
was both incompetent from age, and disqualified by habit.</p>
<p>The Reverend Mr. Youl had established a school very near his
own residence, under the direction of a convict who was married,
and the appearance and attainments of the scholars did credit to
their teacher, as well as to the attention that had been bestowed
upon them by the reverend chaplain himself. Twenty-three children
attended the school in the year 1820. Out of the total number of
children returned by the muster of 1820, and amounting to 1,021
it appears that 193 were receiving instruction from the
established schools. The attainments and progress of the
scholars, and the qualifications of the instructors, appeared to
be inferior to those in New South Wales; and it would be equally
advisable to augment the number of competent teachers, as well as
to establish a central school, consisting at first of fifty
scholars, upon the plan I have already submitted.</p>
<p>The principal societies for charitable relief or religious
instruction, are the Benevolent Society and the Bible Society.
The first was established by the association of a few individuals
at Sydney, principally consisting of missionaries who had
returned from the Society Islands. In these efforts, as well as
in holding religious meetings in the town of Sydney, they were
joined by Mr. Edgar, who acted as secretary to the Benevolent
Society at its first formation, and contributed much to its early
success.</p>
<p>The object of this association was to afford relief to the
indigent, aged and infirm, and to supply them with medical aid
and comforts in sickness. From a general approbation of the
principle of this association, as well as the augmented clans on
its consideration, its members have increased, and great support
has been afforded to it by all ranks of the community.</p>
<p>In the conduct of the concerns of this society and the Bible
society, the invidious distinctions between the free and the
convicted classes seem to have given way; and members of both
those classes have served upon the same committees, and joined in
the general and public administration of their affairs.</p>
<p>It was, however, considered more inducive to the general
benefit of the society, that each district or districts should
associate for the relief of their own poor, and consequently the
inhabitants of Richmond have established a fund of their own, as
also those of Paramatta and those of Sydney.</p>
<p>At the first of these places a grant of land has been made by
Governor Macquarie, at the solicitation of the inhabitants, for
the pasturage of cattle, designed, as the memorial states, "for
the purpose alarming a permanent and increasing fund for the
relief of the distressed and indigent poor." Certain individuals
were appointed to examine, and to afford relief, in cases of
emergency, to distressed objects; but the administration of
general relief is placed under the direction of a committee,
composed of the clergy anti magistrates and four landholders
chosen from each district, who hold monthly meetings to consider
of the cases brought before them, and the relief to be
administered: the grounds upon which it is stated to be afforded
are those of absolute distress, free condition, previous labour
when in bodily health, and residence during the last year in one
of the associated districts. The estate granted by Governor
Macquarie consists of 800 acres of land, near Windsor; and in the
year 1820 a portion of it had been inclosed and cultivated, and a
farm-house had been erected. Contributions of cattle had been
made by individuals, but hitherto they had not been converted to
the purposes of the society, and its funds had been raised by
voluntary contribution of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>At Sydney the association and contributions have been of a
more extensive nature; and although an effort was made at one
period to raise a permanent local fund for the support of the
poor, by the contribution of stock, and the profits of a grazing
farm; and it professed to call for public support on the same
principles upon which the poor laws have so long been maintained
in England; yet hitherto no grant of land has been made in
furtherance of this project, and the funds of the society have
depended upon voluntary contribution. They are managed by an
acting committee, and an annual report is made of the proceedings
and number of cases relieved, at general meetings, at which
Governor Macquarie has presided since the formation of the
society in 1818.</p>
<p>It appears that from the year 1813 to the year 1818, the
number of cases in which relief has been given amounted to 618,
and the number of individuals relieved to 1,075.</p>
<p>Since the later and more extended association was established
in the year 1818, up to the 6th June 1820, the total number of
cases relieved amounted to 201.</p>
<p>A vigilant control is kept by the acting committee, not only
upon the funds of the society, but upon the state of persons
relieved; and in the performance of these duties the Reverend Mr.
Cowper of Sydney has rendered most useful services, and has been
much assisted by Major Antill.</p>
<p>The amount of subscriptions in the year ending 31st May 1820
was 434<i>l</i>; and appeals have been made, from time to time,
by the members of the committee, and by the president Mr. Judge
Advocate Wylde, to the liberality of the inhabitants, who have,
in general, shown a very commendable disposition to contribute to
the relief of casual or permanent distress.</p>
<p>On account of the expense incurred in providing lodging for
many of the aged persons relieved by the society, Governor
Macquarie was induced to build a house lit for their reception at
the expense of government, capable of containing nearly forty
persons. It is situated at the entrance of the town of
Sydney.</p>
<p>A Bible society was established in New South Wales in the
month of March 1817, under the patronage of Governor Macquarie
and presidency of Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde.</p>
<p>By the fourth report of this society, it appears that 990
Bibles and 1,600 Testaments have been distributed, either at
Sydney or by the district societies, of which there is one at
Paramatta and one at Windsor. In Van Diemen's Land also, an
auxiliary branch Bible society has been established under the
patronage of Lieutenant-Governor Sorell; and in an abstract
return, annexed to the first report, it would appear that out of
519 dwellings that had been visited by the members of the first
committee, there were upwards of 250 that were destitute of the
holy scriptures. In the month of May 1820, the sum of
185<i>l</i>. was remitted from the society in Van Diemen's Land
for the purchase of Bibles and Testaments, which were immediately
supplied and distributed. The annual subscriptions in New South
Wales amounted in the year 1820 to 140<i>l</i>.; and, at the
meeting that was held of the subscribers in Sydney in that year,
there prevailed a strong and unanimous disposition to promote the
great objects and second the views of the principal society in
England.</p>
<p>From these circumstances I am justified in stating to your
Lordship, that there has existed no want of zeal in the local
authorities of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; in the
clergy of the established church, or in those who are not members
of it, to promote the interests of religion and morals amongst
the lower classes of the inhabitants, or to afford them the
opportunities of receiving early instruction.</p>
<p>The dispersed state of the settlements, and the depraved
habits of the people, have been found to oppose the strongest
impediments to these salutary objects; and it is only by the
positive effects of the colonial establishments, in the
comprehensive admission of children to the schools, and the
greater efficiency of the teachers, that the influence of the bad
habits of the parents can be successfully resisted.</p>
<p>If the plan that I have had the honour to propose, for
building a school for boys on the orphan school farm, is carried
into effect, there will be less immediate necessity for the
additional school proposed by the Reverend Mr. Hill in his
remarks upon the existing establishments in New South Wales; but
in case it should not be deemed expedient to remove the present
orphan school from Sydney to the country, and to enlarge its
establishment, a point which, for many reasons, is desirable, it
will then be necessary to establish a school in the districts of
Airds and Minto, and in the districts of Baulkham Hills, near
Paramatta.</p>
<p>I should further propose, that in Van Diemen's Land two
schools should be established for the separate reception and
education of not less than one hundred boys, and the same number
of girls; and that the expenses of the establishment should be
defrayed from the public fund of that colony, without the
appropriation of any specific portion of it.</p>

<h3><i>State and Character of the Population of New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> Population of New South Wales consists,
first, of persons who have gone out to the colony in a state of
freedom, either as civil servants, settlers and merchants, or of
persons who, after serving in the regiments stationed there, have
entered upon those pursuits. To dim may be added a very few
individuals who have repaired to the colony from India, and have
settled in it. Second, of the children either of free persons or
convicts, and who have been born in the colony. Thirdly, those
who, after having been transported under the sentence of the law
for crime from England, Scotland, and Ireland, and also from
India, or the eastern colonies, under sentences of courts
martial, have become free by expiration of their terms of
sentence, or remission of them by the governors of the colony.
Fourthly, of the convicts, whose terms of service are still
subsisting; and lastly of those, whether free or convict, who
having been again convicted of offences in the colony, are
suffering punishment by the sentences of the colonial courts.</p>
<p>The annual musters of the several classes of the inhabitants
have been taken under the inspection of the several governors,
and lieutenant-governors, and the chief officer of the
commissariat department; and in late years these musters have
been taken in the month of October, as the period that causes the
least interference with the labours of agriculture. A personal
attendance of the parties is required by the governor, except in
cases of convict servants actually employed in watching flocks of
sheep and herds of cattle; and I observed that a considerable
degree of indulgence was afforded in this respect, and that lists
of convicts assigned, containing a description of their persons,
the ship in which they came, the place of their trial and length
of sentence, were very frequently handed in to the clerk who
attended the governor in taking the musters. The places and days
of attendance of the several classes of inhabitants being
previously fixed by a public order, they severally presented
themselves before the governor, who, if they had been convicts,
examined the certificate of expiration of the term of service,
pardon, conditional pardon, or ticket of leave, and signed the
initials of his name to it, and the date. In this duty the
governor was attended by a person now called clerk of the
musters, by whom the names are taken down, and the lists are
subsequently made out. The deputy commissary general attends also
at these musters for the purpose of taking down in lists the
quantity of land and stock held by each individual; but from no
description being added to the name, it has become a matter of
some difficulty to connect the several classes of inhabitants
with the quantity of laud that they severally held. These musters
occupy nearly three weeks, and although every effort was made by
Governor Macquarie to diminish the inconvenience of personal
attendance to proprietors, yet the free classes made it a subject
of complaint, and hardly ever complied with an important object
of the regulation, which was that of fixing in each district the
exact amount of population that it contained, and the quantity of
land cultivated and of stock possessed. It also occurred that
returns were made by the proprietors in one district, and by
their overseers in another, by which the gross amount of the
musters, as well as that in each district, was greatly augmented;
allowing for the operation of other motives in very many of the
proprietors of land and cattle in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, the deduction of one-twelfth from the amount of
both, stated by Mr. Acting Deputy Commissary General Broughton,
appears to be consistent with the observation and opinion of
other persons upon the subject.</p>
<p>The principal objects proposed by these annual musters are to
ascertain the actual number of the convict population, and of
those who, although emancipated by the governor's pardon, were
still subject to the condition of residence in the colony.</p>
<p>The musters have likewise afforded information of the
progressive increase of cultivation and cattle, and to the
commissaries the basis of their calculations of the quantity of
meat and wheat that each settler should be allowed to supply to
the King's store in the following year. The governors have
likewise been instructed to transmit alphabetical lists of every
individual that has been transported and is now in the colony,
with a reference to his place and date of trial as well as to the
ship in which he came to the colony, for the purpose of answering
inquiries made by relatives in England at the office of the
Secretary of State for the Home Department. This duty has been
executed by an emancipated convict, who possessed great knowledge
of the inhabitants of the colony, but whose habits of
intoxication during the latter period of his service materially
affected the accuracy of his returns, and it is now in the hands
of a person whose condition and whose habits I regretted to
observe were very similar to those of his predecessor.</p>
<p>The clerk of the musters and his assistants occupied an office
in the commissariat department, and were considered as attached
to it; but I could see no other reason for this regulation than
the facility of reference that it afforded to the returns of
stock and land in cultivation, as a guide in the reception of
wheat and meat into the store.</p>
<p>The improvement that was suggested to me from many quarters,
in taking these musters of the inhabitants, was a previous
inquiry by the district constables of the number of proprietors
and convict labourers, or of land and stock cultivated and
possessed in the district in which they served.</p>
<p>To facilitate the execution of this duty, and to make it
uniform in its result, the returns should be made on printed
forms; and the musters should afterwards be taken by the
magistrates in the most central part of each district, conforming
themselves, with a very little variation, to the form of muster
that was submitted to me by Mr. Oxley.</p>
<p>With a little care in making the abstracts from these several
returns, the condition of every individual resident in each
district may be known, together with the number of his family,
and of the convicts that he employs, and the amount of the
property, that he possesses either in land or stock.</p>
<p>The muster of the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land for the
year 1820, that was forwarded to me by Lieutenant-Governor
Sorell, is infinitely more distinct than those taken in New South
Wales, but it affords no means of connecting the property held
with the condition of the holder.</p>
<p>With exception of the convicts and ticket-of-leave men, and
men conditionally pardoned, who ought to be mustered personally
every year, I do not think that any necessity exists for
continuing an annual muster of the inhabitants. A biennial muster
of the whole population, and a correct alphabetical abstract of
the names, sentences, condition and places of abode of those who
had once been or still were convicts, and who had remained in the
colony, for the information required in the office of the
Secretary of State for the Home Department, would answer all the
purposes for which the musters are at present taken, and relieve
the civil officers and inhabitants of a great deal of trouble and
attendance.</p>
<p>In taking the muster of the convicts, ticket-of-leave men, and
those that are conditionally pardoned, it will be of importance
as much as possible to avoid the collection of them in the towns,
as it never fails to lead to intoxication and quarrels.</p>
<p>From a document which I inspected, it appeared that between
the years 1787, and the end of the year 1820, 22,217 male
convicts and 3,661 female convicts have been transported to New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, making a total number of
25,878 convicts. In the return made by the clerk of the musters
of those taken in the year 1819, or in the preceding year, there
is no distinction made of the condition of the free inhabitants.
In that of 1820, the distinction was afterwards made at my
request, as the form that was transmitted to the magistrates in
that year, to direct them in taking the muster, confounded in the
same column the distinctions of freedom by servitude, or by
absolute and conditional pardon, that it was so important to
preserve. In the returns of population made in the year 1821, I
observe that these distinctions have been observed.</p>
<p>In the returns of the year 1820, it appears that the total
number of inhabitants in New South Wales amounted to 23,939, and
of these 1,307 persons had come free; 1,495 had been born in the
colony; 159 had been absolutely pardoned; 962 had been
conditionally pardoned; 3,255 were free by servitude and
expiration of sentence; 1,422 held tickets of leave; 9,451 were
convicts; 5,668 were children; and 220 were serving on board
colonial vessels.</p>
<p>The proportion of those persons that live in Sydney, and the
districts immediately adjoining, amounts to 12,079, and of these
4,457 were convicts. The number of women of every class in the
colony amounted to 3,707; and the number of female children
amounted to 2,603.</p>
<p>In Van Diemen's Land in the year 1820, the total population
amounted to 5,468 persons, of whom 714 came free to the colony;
185 were born in it; 362 were free by servitude and expiration of
sentence; 23 held free pardons; 208 held conditional pardons; 368
held tickets of leave; and 2,588 were convicts. The number of
children of both sexes amounted to 1,020. The number of women at
the settlement of the Derwent amounted 658, and at Port Dalrymple
to 222. In taking the musters it has not been customary to note
the married or single condition of the parties, or the legitimacy
of their children; but I find from the returns transmitted by the
magistrates of the different districts, that in the colony of New
South Wales there were 641 persons who were married, and of those
45 consisted of persons who had been born in the colony. Of the
total number of persons resident in the town of Sydney, and
amounting to 357, the number of persons that are married amounts
to 219. From the abstract of the returns of marriages that have
taken place from the year 1811 to the year 1820, I find that
although the free population has been gradually, and within the
last three years rapidly, increasing in numbers, the number of
annual marriages has not borne any proportion to that increase.
In the year 1811 there were 143 marriages, and in the years 1818
and 1819 there were 166 and 165 marriages.</p>
<p>The number of persons baptized between the year 1811 and the
year 1820, amounts to 3,011, and the number of deaths in the same
period amounts to 2,315.</p>
<p>It is stated by the Reverend Mr. Cowper, that the number of
children born in the colony much exceeds the number registered as
baptized.</p>
<p>I was furnished with a return of baptisms, marriages and
deaths within the district of Hobart Town, from the 12th of March
1804 to 31st December 1819. In this period, it appeared that
there had been 685 children baptized, and 26 natives of Van
Diemen's Land; and that of these 524 were the children of married
parents, and 161, including the native children, were
illegitimate. It further appeared, that 170 marriages of free
persons had taken place, and 127 marriage's of convicts. The
deaths had amounted in the same period to 347.</p>
<p>No registers appear to have been kept in the county of
Cornwall previous to the arrival of the Reverend Mr. Youl in the
year 1820; and in the quarter ending 30th March in that year,
there were thirty-two baptisms of children whose parents were
married, five marriages, and nine deaths.</p>
<p>In the year ending the 31st December 1820, there were 105
children baptized at Hobart Town, of whom eighty-two were
legitimate, and twenty-three illegitimate. There were nineteen
marriages of free persons, and forty-three marriages of convicts;
and there were seventy-eight deaths.</p>
<p>Of the 25,878 convicts that have been transported from England
and other places to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, from
the establishment of the colony to the end of the year 1820,
there now remains 18,798 accounted for, under the different
conditions described before in the musters of 1820, in New South
Wales and in Van Diemen's Land, leaving 7,080 as the difference
to be accounted for by deaths, escapes or lawful departures from
the colony.</p>
<p>The early registers of deaths were not kept with any
regularity, and previous to the arrival of the Reverend Mr.
Cartwright at Windsor in 1812, no registers whatever existed.
Even the present returns made by the chaplains do not specify
with sufficient particularity the condition of the parties
buried; and it would be very desirable that the forms of the
returns made by the chaplains of the several districts, of
marriages, burials and baptisms, should be printed and uniform,
and should always specify the condition of the parties, as well
as the parents of those baptized.</p>
<p>By a return furnished from the office of Mr. Secretary
Campbell, of the number of persons that have left the colony
under certificates of expired service, or pardon, from the year
1810 to 1820, it appears that 247 males and thirty-one females
have left it with certificates of expired service; and
eighty-seven males and twenty-four females have left it under
free pardons; making a total of 389 persons.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to advert to the attempts at
escape from the colony that have been made by the convicts from
time to time, and the difficulty that I found in obtaining any
correct information respecting them. The principal superintendent
of convicts was of opinion that they were more numerous than they
were reported to him to be; but it was the general opinion in the
colony, that to a large portion of the convicts, the temptations
that a residence in it holds out of easy subsistence to all
labourers, of considerable profit and of indulgence to those who
possess either industry or skill, operated as a better security
for the detention of the convicts, or of those conditionally
pardoned, than the regulations of police.</p>
<p>The effect of the climate of New South Wales cannot be said to
be prejudicial to the health of those who are even exposed to the
labours of the field: the changes of atmosphere are abrupt in the
summers, and in the beginning of autumn; and amongst the
labouring claws the abundance and cheapness of those fruits, that
in England are only in use amongst the opulent classes, together
with the bad quality of the water, produce dysentery, the only
endemial disease that has hitherto been marked with fatal
consequences. In the months of January, February and March of the
year 1820, the number of deaths was greater than they had been in
any preceding year, but not greater in proportion to the
population of the town of Sydney at former periods; and in the
months of July and August, many of the older inhabitants of the
colony were affected with a catarrhal fever, that in several
instances proved fatal. The prevailing disease of dysentery is
also attributed to the irregular habits of life to which the
majority of the inhabitants have been accustomed; and the effect
of these habits, as well as of the early discipline of the
colony, are very visible in the persons of many of the lower
classes of settlers. The class of inhabitants that have been born
in the colony affords a remarkable exception to the moral and
physical character of their parents: they are generally tall in
person, and slender in their limbs, of fair complexion, and small
features. They are capable of undergoing more fatigue, and are
less exhausted by labour than native Europeans; they are active
in their habits, but remarkably awkward in their movements. In
their tempers they are quick and irascible, but not vindictive;
and I only repeat the testimony of persons who have had many
opportunities of observing them, that they neither inherit the
vices nor the feelings of their parents. Many of the native
youths have evinced a strong disposition for a sea-faring life,
and are excellent sailors; and no doubt can be entertained that
that clams of the population will afford abundant and excellent
materials for the supply of any department in the commercial or
naval service. Of the general disposition of the inhabitants of
the colony, I may be permitted to observe that it differs in one
material point from that which may be considered as common to
most other colonial dependencies of Great Britain. Of the older
inhabitants there are very few who do not regard the colony as
their future home; and of those who have arrived in later periods
there are many who are now convinced, that it is by perseverance
only in the continued pursuit of moderate profits that any
benefit can be derived by emigration to New South Wales. The
periods of monopoly, and of great and sudden profits, are passed;
and the colony has every prospect of receiving ample supplies of
British manufactures, and of commodities from India without the
re-action of alternate scarcity and abundance. The great
attraction of New South Wales to the majority of the persons who
visit it is the beauty of its climate and temperature; and the
salubrity of both has already been tried and attested by several
residents in British India, who from visitors have eventually
become resident proprietors of the soil. When the means of
subsistence become more abundant and more easy of access, and
when domestic accommodations are more easily procured, and are
exempt from the perpetual vexation to which the employment of the
convicts in domestic service gives rise, New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land will offer advantages to emigrants that are not
found united in any other portion of the British dependencies. In
the mean time the condition of those who have long been settlers
in the colony does not afford proof of this proposition: there
are very few persons of the free classes who, however respectable
in character, are not still suffering from the effect of early or
later embarrassment. Their habitations possess little of the
comfort or convenience that distinguish the houses of the middle
classes in England; and it is chiefly amongst those who have been
connected with the superintendence of the labour of convicts and
the sale of spirits that the traces of wealth are yet to be
distinguished.</p>
<p>The improvement of the communications between the more
populous parts of the settled districts, and the reduction of the
price of mechanical labour in the colony, by a relaxation of the
practice of retaining all good mechanics for the service of
government, will probably have the effect of withdrawing from the
town of Sydney that disproportionate share of the population that
has hitherto been attracted to and fixed in it. It appeared to
me, during my residence in Sydney, that any measure that had
those effects was prejudicial to the moral habits of the
convicts, and tended to divert the other portions of the
community from pursuing those paths of agricultural industry to
which the climate and the natural resources of the soil so
evidently point, and which must eventually constitute the solid
foundations of their prosperity.</p>
<p>In New South Wales the relief afforded by the funds of the
Benevolent Society has been extended to many of the lower
classes, who were reduced to a state of indigence by age,
accident or distress; but there are others, amounting in number
to seventy-seven, who received rations from the King's store as
objects of charity. These persons were generally recommended by
the magistrates to the governor, who gave them a victualling
order upon the store; and from the inquiries that I made into the
character and situation of these persons, I have no reason to
believe that there existed any abuse of the indulgence thus
shown.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town I found that forty-eight persons were
victualled as objects of charity, and at Port Dalrymple. The
recommendations for support are made here, as in New South Wales,
by the magistrates to the lieutenant-governor; but the principle
has been extended to the families of superannuated functionaries
or settlers of the lower class, who have been in the settlements
from the earliest periods, many of them having been removed from
Norfolk Island at its evacuation, and several being marines. No
public fund having yet been established in Van Diemen's Land for
the support of persons in indigence, the expense has necessarily
Eaten it the government; but in examining the list of those to
whom it was given, it appeared to me that, in a few instances it
had exceeded the grounds of positive necessity.
Lieutenant-Governor Sorell fully entered into the views that I
expressed upon this subject, and appeared to be convinced of the
necessity of watching narrowly the claims that were presented for
support, or of not allowing it to be converted into a resource
against the consequences of idleness and dissipation.</p>
<p>Since the year 1816 the native black inhabitants of New South
Wales have ceased to give any active disturbance to the pursuits
of the settlers in the county of Cumberland. They occasionally
visit the towns in small parties and travel to the coast, where
they subsist on fish; and several have resorted to the shores of
the harbour of Port Jackson, where they take up a temporary
abode, occasionally visiting the town of Sydney and disposing of
their fish to the inhabitants. They likewise resort to the farms
of some of the settlers on the banks of the Nepean, and are
sometimes induced to take part in the labours of the farm, or to
cultivate a portion of land in maize for themselves. They are not
incapable of labour, but they dislike any continued occupation
that binds them to the same spot. A very few of them have settled
upon portions of land that Governor Macquarie has granted them;
and one black native has been made a constable in the district of
Windsor, and discharges his duty with fidelity and intelligence.
Their numbers have been observed to diminish in the neighbourhood
of the settled districts, and as an unfettered range over a large
tract of country seems to be indispensible to their existence,
the black population will undergo a gradual diminution in
proportion to the advances of the white population into the
interior. In the course of the expedition that I made from
Bathurst to the lakes, and in my return from thence to the Cow
Pastures, one family only was observed or met with, consisting of
seven persons. I was informed that at Bathurst they sometimes
made attacks upon the cattle of the settlers, which graze at a
distance; and as they are indiscriminate in their revenge, it not
unfrequently happens that unoffending parties stiffer some injury
for the imprudence or cruelty of others. There is, however, a
general disposition amongst the white inhabitants to treat the
black natives with kindness and indulgence; but from mistaken
motives, and sometimes from reprehensible ones, they supply them
with spirits, and stimulate them to the commission of shocking
outrages upon each other. The appearance of the natives in the
towns generally leads to quarrels; and independent of the
violence to which they are protection it is very offensive to
delicacy. The black natives have both enjoyed the protection of
the law in New South Wales, and have been made amenable to
it.</p>
<p>A convict at Newcastle received sentence of death, and was
executed, for the murder of a black native; and in the year 1816
a native named Dual, who had been distinguished by great ferocity
of character, was sentenced to be transported to Van Diemen's
Land, where I saw him in the year 1820.</p>
<p>The native black inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land are
distinguished from those New South Wales, by their aversion to
intercourse with the Europeans, and by the spirit of hostility
and revenge that they still cherish for an act of unjustifiable
violence formerly committed upon them. They are rarely seen in
Hobart Town, or in the vicinity even of the settlements but a few
of the children have been adopted and treated with kindness by
the settlers. In their form and stature they are more robust than
the native blacks of New South Wales, but their physiognomy is
nearly the same and marked by a great projection of the lower
part of the forehead, and a full bushy eyebrow, affording
protection to large and rather expressive eyes.</p>
<p>The distinction that is most remarkable in the natives of Van
Diemen's Land, is that of their woolly hair, which perfectly
resembles the hair of the African negroes. From the accounts of
persons who have visited the interior of Van Diemen's Land, there
is no reason to presume that the black natives are numerous, or
that they will oppose any serious resistance to the extension of
the future settlements.</p>

<h3><i>State of the Revenue in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> Revenue that has been raised within the
colony of New South Wales has consisted of a duty of live per
cent, levied upon all goods and articles imported into the colony
not of British manufacture; of certain rates per ton on sandal
wood, beche-la-mer, pearl shells, sperm oil, and black whale oil;
of three halfpence on every fur seal skin, and one halfpenny on
hare and kangaroo skins; of 1<i>s</i>. for each solid foot of
cedar imported from other parts of the colony, either for home
consumption or re-shipment; of 1<i>l</i>. for every twenty spars
from New Zealand, or elsewhere; and 1<i>s</i>., afterwards
reduced to 6<i>d</i>., for each solid foot of timber in log or
plank from New Zealand, or elsewhere. There is likewise a duty of
2<i>s</i>. per ton on coals imported for home consumption, and
5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per ton on coals exported; and a further
duty of 3<i>l</i>. on every 1,000 square feet of timber imported
from Hunter's River for home consumption, and 6<i>l</i>. for that
quantity exported.</p>
<p>Duties of 10<i>s</i>. per gallon have been levied on spirits
imported, 9<i>d</i>. per gallon on wine imported, and 6<i>d</i>.
per pound on tobacco.</p>
<p>In addition to these must be reckoned the duty of 6<i>d</i>.,
received as a wharf tax on every bale of goods landed; the fees
of entry and all other fees taken at the naval office, except
2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to the clerk; an auction duty of three
halfpence per cent. on all goods sold by auction; the market and
fair duties at Sydney and Paramatta; the tolls of the public
roads and bridges; and the fees paid on the slaughtering of
cattle at the public slaughter-house at Sydney.</p>
<p>The duties on importation are received by the naval officer,
Captain Piper, who is authorized to charge five per cent. on the
gross receipts. The tolls of the public roads, and of the Sydney
and Paramatta markets, are let by public auction, and the rents
are paid over by the trustees to the treasurer of the
police-fund. For the security of the revenue, the masters of
ships on their arrival enter into a bond, engaging that they will
not suffer any goods to leave their ships without a permit; and
the permits are filed at the office of the wharfinger, as a check
upon the landing of the cargo. The manifests of imported cargoes
have been sworn to by the masters before the naval officer, since
he became a magistrate; and a copy of it is sent to the governor,
together with blank permits, for his signature to allow the
landing of the goods.</p>
<p>On landing spirits or wine at the wharf, they are gauged by
one of the officers of the commissariat department, who, as the
spirits are generally deposited in the King's store, is allowed a
percentage on the contents.</p>
<p>The <i>ad valorem</i> duty of five per cent. upon goods
imported, is taken upon the manifest and original invoices of the
cargoes. It is stated by Captain Piper that copies of these
invoices are sent to the governor when the ship enters, but that
they do not express the value of the goods imported, nor do the
rough estimates that are transmitted to the governor convey that
information to him, although they show the gross amount of duties
collected on each ship in every quarter. There appears,
therefore, to be no check upon the calculation of the <i>ad
valorem</i> duty made by the naval officer on goods that are
subject to it.</p>
<p>Permissions have sometimes been given to civil officers to
import wine and spirits duty free, but they have of late been
less frequent than they were formerly.</p>
<p>At the end of every quarter, the accounts of the naval officer
have been approved by the governor; and by his order,
seven-eighths of the duties received are paid over to the
treasurer of the police-fund, and one-eighth to the treasurer of
the orphan fund; therefore, from the commencement to the end of
the quarter, and during the interval between the receipt and
payment, the duties are retained in the hands of the naval
officer. It does not appear that he has ever given or has been
called upon to give security to the government; but I am not
aware that any loss has occurred in the collection of the duties
since Captain Piper, the present naval officer, has filled the
situation. The duties are paid to the naval officer either in
store receipts, dollars, notes of the bank of New South Wales, or
orders on the police-fund, approved by the governor, and signed
by the chief engineer.</p>
<p>The office of treasurer of the police-fund was created in the
year 1810, and conferred on Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth by Governor
Macquarie.</p>
<p>It does not appear that any salary was originally annexed to
the specific duty of treasurer; and Mr. Wentworth continued to
discharge it until the year 1820, upon an assurance from Governor
Macquarie, of a recommendation having been forwarded to your
Lordship of the allowance of a salary; and upon an expectation
constantly entertained by Mr. Wentworth and his friends, although
not assented to or understood by the governor, that a salary was
to be allowed. Upon his retirement in 1820, a discussion upon
this subject took place between him and Governor Macquarie, which
ended in Mr. Wentworth's being allowed to deduct from the balance
of the police-fund in his hands, a sum equal to 100<i>l</i>. per
annum for the period in which he held the office. The drafts upon
the treasurer of the police-fund have been signed by the governor
himself, except in a very few instances, when they have been
expressed to be by order of the governor, and in the hand writing
of Mr. J. T. Campbell his secretary, in which case Mr. Wentworth
took the precaution of having them again submitted to the
governor for signature.</p>
<p>The accounts of the police-fund were made up every quarter,
and after being submitted to the governor, and a committee of
audit, consisting of the lieutenant-governor, and the judge
advocate, they were published in the Sydney Gazette. In the
order, by which the duty of the auditors was prescribed, they
were required to meet monthly, or as often as they might judge
necessary, to inspect and regulate the accounts of the treasurer,
which upon their approval, and that of the governor, were
afterwards to be published.</p>
<p>The audit of these accounts has been made every quarter, and
it has been limited to the examination of the orders and warrants
of the governor for the several charges made by the
treasurer.</p>
<p>No examination of the receipt of duties appears to have taken
place at any time; and the only vouchers submitted to the
auditors were the orders of the governor upon the naval officer
to pay to the treasurer of the police-fund the amount of the
duties received and collected by him within the quarter. The
receipts of the rent of the tolls and markets; the receipts of
the clerk of the peace for licenses to sell spirits, and those
for slaughtering duties. Utterly, on account of the numerous
purchases that have been made in aid of the public service of
materials of every description, the bills have been annexed to
the governor's warrants for payment, but formerly it does not
appear that this practice was observed.</p>
<p>The duties that have been already enumerated, and that formed
the principal sources of revenue in New South Wales, have never
been enforced with rigour. Securities to the amount of
4,024<i>l</i>. for the payment of duties, have remained for a
long period in the hands of the governor, some of which were
dated anterior to his assumption of the government, and had been
delivered over to him by his predecessor.</p>
<p>In the year 1817, the solicitor of the Crown was instructed by
the governor to proceed against several persons whose securities
for duties were considered to be available, although the parties
had neglected or refused to discharge them. A list of these
persons was submitted to me, and the total amount of the sums in
which they were indebted appeared to be 1,286<i>l</i>.
16<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. The duties for which the securities had
been taken were chiefly upon the importation of sandal-wood, and
most of them were dated as early as the year 1813. One person
only discharged the sum in which he stood indebted, and
proceedings were instituted by the solicitor to the Crown in the
Supreme Court, and declarations filed against each debtor, when
Mr. Justice Field, having communicated with Governor Macquarie,
and having informed him that as he considered the duties for the
recovery of which the actions had been brought to be illegal, and
that they had been levied without sufficient authority, he should
feel himself under the necessity of making such a declaration in
case the actions were continued. He therefore advised the
governor that the actions should be withdrawn; and he was further
of opinion that the second section of the statute of the 5 Geo.
III. c. 114, by which a power was given to the governor of New
South Wales to order the levy of any rate or duty that had been
imposed, or usually collected or levied in the colony previous to
the passing of the act, had no retrospective operation upon
duties that were due only, and had not been paid; upon receiving
this declaration the actions were discontinued, after a
considerable expense had been incurred by the solicitor of the
Crown, and the securities upon which these actions were brought,
as well as the others comprising the sum of 4,024<i>l</i>. may
now be considered as unavailable.</p>
<p>At one period such long credit had been given for the payment
of the duties that Mr. D. Wentworth was under an advance to the
police-fund in the sum of 3,500<i>l</i>. in which he was
reimbursed by bills drawn upon the Lords of the Treasury, by Mr.
Deputy Commissary General Allan, under a warrant of the governor,
which was afterwards repaid by his order, at different times,
upon the police-fund, together with interest to Mr. Wentworth for
the period in which he was under advance. No security was ever
required of Mr. Wentworth, nor did he ever give any, although the
sums that have been paid to him by the naval officer must have
occasionally left large balances in his hands. In the discharge
of his duty as treasurer Mr. Wentworth appears to have acquitted
himself with punctuality and credit. Upon his retirement from the
office in the month of May 1820, Governor Macquarie, not
venturing to place the same confidence in his successor, who,
although respectable in character, was not possessed of much
property, withdrew from the balance of the police-fund, then in
the hands of the treasurer, the sum of 3,000<i>l</i>. and placed
it in the bank of New South Wales, taking the receipt of the
president and directors, who agreed to pay five per cent. for the
use of that sum, for the space of twelve months.</p>
<p>The amount of duties received by the naval officer from the
1st of October 1817, to the 31st December 1820, is stated by him
to have amounted to the sum of 81,748<i>l</i>. 3<i>s</i>.
11<i>d</i>. In the year ending 31st December 1820, the duties
collected on wine, spirits, tobacco, foreign on auctions, and the
south-head lights, amounted to</p>

<p>I have already stated the augmentation of duty from
10<i>s</i>. to 15<i>s</i>. per gallon imposed upon spirits
imported into the colony after the passing of the 3 Geo. IV. c.
96 as well as the continuance of the duty of 10<i>s</i>. upon
ruin the produce of the British West Indies. Those duties are
sufficiently high to afford protection to the colonial
distillation during the first year of its establishment; and the
duty of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per gallon imposed upon the spirits
distilled in the colony affords great encouragement to those who
may embark in that speculation. The regulations under which it
was determined that distillation in the colony should be
conducted were published in the Sydney Gazette on the 3d February
1821. The period on which it was to commence was fixed on the 1st
August 1822, and the principal regulation provided that it should
be lawful to distil within the colony, and in stills licensed by
the governor, and not containing less than forty-four gallons,
spirit of seven per cent. above hydrometer proof, from grain
grown in the colony, and from no other grain whatever; that the
governor should have the power of suspending the distillation of
spirit from grain whenever the price of wheat should exceed the
sum of 10<i>s</i>. per bushel in the Sydney market for two
successive days; but that during the continuance of the
prohibition of distilling from wheat, distillation from fruit
might be permitted. Particular directions are given for the form
and proportion of the diameter to the altitude of the stills to
be used in the colony, as well as for the inclosure of the houses
in which they are to be placed, by walls not less than ten feet
in height, and distant forty-eight feet from the still-houses. To
prevent the sale of spirits in small quantities from the
distilleries, it was provided that no person who should be a
part-owner, or have an interest in a licensed distillery, should
have a license to retail spirits; and no licensed distiller was
permitted to sell at any time a smaller quantity of spirits than
100 gallons.</p>
<p>The principle upon which the duty was ordered to be collected
was that of charging the distiller with the duty of 2<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per gallon for as much spirit of the strength of seven
per cent. above hydrometer proof as every still should be found
capable of producing from the number of charges that could be
worked off in the space of twenty-eight days.</p>
<p>This system of charging the duty by working against time was
considered to be better adapted to the imperfect means of
collecting a revenue that the government possessed in such a
colony as New South Wales, than a system of survey by officers,
if indeed the permission to use stills of such small dimensions
as forty-four gallons would have admitted of the application of
such a system. In the early discussion of the measure it had been
contemplated that the stills should not be of less dimensions
than 200 gallons, and that the business of distillation should be
carried on by a joint stock company. There appeared however to be
important objections to this measure, either with reference to
the purchase and consumption of grain for the use of the
distilleries or in the tendency that it had to fix the new market
that it afforded in one and the same place.</p>
<p>It was very desirable in the early establishment of the
distilleries in New South Wales to avoid as much as possible the
risk of giving a monopoly in the supply of home-made spirits, or
an influence in the purchase of grain, by confining the use of it
in the distilleries to one, or even to an association of
individuals and it was also desirable, that by placing the
distilleries in different districts a remedy should be found for
the inconvenience, expense, and interruption to their pursuits
that was caused by the resort of the settlers to the distant
market of Sydney. When the moral effects of the measure came to
be considered, it appeared that there was less injury to be
apprehended from augmented facility of access to spirits than
from confining the sale of them to one place and that the
immoderate use of them was much more likely to be promoted by
association in towns than by the domestic consumption of spirits
in the country. Upon these principles the regulations issued by
Governor Macquarie in the month of February 1821 have proceeded
and although I think it probable that the long-established use of
the Bengal spirit in the colony will secure it a preference in
the market, notwithstanding the difference of the duty imposed
upon it, and the spirit distilled in the colony, yet I have very
little doubt that means will be found to improve the quality of
the latter, and to accommodate it gradually to the taste of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Taking the consumption of spirit upon which the new duty is
payable in the colony of New South Wales to amount in 1820 to
80,000 gallons, and that the consumption of spirit distilled in
the colony for the first three years after the opening of the
distilleries will not exceed that quantity, the animal revenue
collected on spirit would only amount to the sum of
10,000<i>l</i>. To meet this reduction in the revenue the duty of
10<i>s</i>. and 15<i>s</i>. is to be levied on the strength, and
not, as heretofore, on the quantity of imported spirit. The
duties on all goods imported in the colony, not of British
manufacture, have been raised by the Act of 3 Geo. IV. c. 96,
from five to fifteen per cent. and as they consist of tea and
sugar, India goods, and articles of luxury, and are obtained at a
very cheap rate these duties may, without any injury either to
the revenue or the inhabitants, be raised from fifteen to twenty
per cent. And I should further recommend that when the
improvements of the public wharf in Sydney Cove, that I have
suggested, shall be carried into abet, or the present public
wharf shall have been repaired or extended, the mode of levying
the duty according to the sworn value of the goods, that is
pointed out by the seventh section of the act, shall cease to be
applied to the articles of tea and sugar, and that each shall be
charged with a fixed duty upon the weight. The object proposed by
the augmented duty of 4<i>s</i>. per pound on tobacco imported
was to afford encouragement to the domestic growth of it, both as
an article of consumption, and one of future exportation to Great
Britain. With this view, and considering that the growth and
consumption of tobacco in the colony has already been
established, I should recommend that a still further increase
should take place upon all imported tobacco, and that the duty
should be raised from 4<i>s</i>. to 7<i>s</i>. per pound.</p>
<p>In the observations that I have had the honour to address to
your Lordship on the subject of the trade of New South Wales, I
have had occasion to remark upon the duties levied in the colony
upon the importation of certain articles, either for home
consumption or re-shipment. These duties have not, perhaps, had
much effect in discouraging the efforts of the colonists in New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land in the importation of these
articles, or to establish a trade of export; but when it is
recollected that the expense of fitting out vessels in these
colonies is yet considerable; that the wages or seamen are also
high, and that they have to come into competition with the skill
and capital of English traders, who, in the South Sea fisheries
are also aided and encouraged by high bounties, and that lately
they have had to encounter the effects of American enterprize in
the same pursuits, it would seem only reasonable that duties
imposed on the colony upon the productions of colonial industry
should for the most part be withdrawn; and that the colonists
should at least not have to encounter, in the shape of a colonial
tax, any symptoms of discouragement to the early efforts of their
enterprize and industry.</p>
<p>The duties upon sandal-wood, pearl shells, beche la mer, seal
skins, oil, wood and coals, imported into Sydney Harbour in
colonial vends, from the year commencing 6th October 1817, and
ending October 1818, amounted only to the sum of 726<i>l</i>.
4<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.; from October 1818 to October 1819, to
386<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.; and from October 1819 to
December 1820, to 568<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The loss of revenue, therefore, upon these importations by
taking off the duties will be very inconsiderable.</p>
<p>The duties arising from licenses to sell spirits and beer are
not higher in amount than the profits of those traders can very
well afford, but the amount of 25<i>l</i>. paid for licenses to
brew does not appear to me to be justified by the same motives,
while it operates as a restraint upon the production of a good
and wholesome substitute for spirits, and upon the competition of
which its quality would be improved; I therefore recommend that
the sum of 25<i>l</i>. paid for brewing licenses should be
reduced to 5<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The tolls of the different turnpike roads constitute a just
source of revenue, or rather of compensation for the expense that
has been incurred in their formation and improvement; but I do
not think that they admit of any augmentation beyond their
present amount, and that for the next two years it will be more
conducive to the public advantage that the repair both of roads
and bridges should be maintained by the government, than
undertaken by the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The slaughtering duties received at Sydney consist of a
payment of 5<i>s</i>. for every head of horned cattle slaughtered
for the use of the King's store; 8<i>s</i>. sterling for each
score of sheep, and 1<i>s</i>. per hundred weight for pigs. The
duties are ordered to be paid weekly to the treasurer of the
police-fund, accompanied with certificates of the store-keeper of
the King's store, of the number of cattle slaughtered. The
superintendent of the slaughter-house receives a salary of
50<i>l</i>. from the police-fund, and is allowed the labour of
four convicts subsisted by the government. The object of this
establishment was to protect the settlers who supplied meat to
the King's store from the extravagant demands made by the
butchers in Sydney for killing their cattle, and for ensuring a
proper degree of care and regularity in the slaughtering. The
situation of the slaughter-house is convenient as it regards the
town of Sydney but until a late alteration of the access, it
became the cause of great annoyance and danger to the
inhabitants, from the cattle being driven through the principal
streets of the town.</p>
<p>The continuance of the slaughtering duties, although attended
with expense to the government, in the original construction and
subsequent repair of the house and yard adjoining, is upon the
whole beneficial to the public, although not a productive source
of revenue.</p>
<p>The tolls of the Sydney market were established by a public
order of Governor Macquarie, issued on the 20th October 1810. A
clerk of the market is appointed, who, as well as an assistant,
are sworn in constables, and have the power of settling and
arranging all questions tending to the order and regularity of
the market. It is also ordered that all articles brought to
market for sale should be lodged in the market-house or store;
that the clerk should take an account of the quantity and the
prices at which they were sold. Part of this regulation is now
dispensed with, on account of the ruinous state of the building,
but the goods are brought within the paling that surround the
market, and are subject to the payment of the same ditty as if
they had been stored in the market-house. These duties,
especially as long as the consideration for which they were
imposed had ceased to exist, appeared to me to exceed the just
measure of convenience to the public, or of remuneration to the
government. The protection of articles brought to market at
Sydney, and exposed to sale there, either from the effect of
weather, or from spoliation, was a matter of great importance to
the community, and it was a subject of regret that the
accommodation of a good and enlarged market-house had not been
provided at an earlier period. A commodious building is probably
by this time erected, together with a strong fence for the
reception of cattle brought for sale. The tolls allowed at the
Sydney market amounted to 3<i>d</i>. for every bushel of wheat or
barley; 2<i>d</i>. for every bushel of maize or oats, and
3<i>d</i>. per hundred weight of potatoes. The sum of 1<i>s</i>.
4<i>d</i>. per week for the stalls erected in the market-place
was taken, and 8<i>d</i>. for the liberty of selling goods on
every market-day. The clerk of the market is furnished with
stamped, and scales, by which he is empowered to regulate and
adjust all sales made in the market, and has a further power to
inspect, whenever he may think proper, the weights and scales
that are used in the town of Sydney: He is further required to
make a weekly report to the magistrates of the quantity and juice
of wheat sold on every market-day, to enable them to fix the
price of bread. The tolls of the market are now let by auction,
and have been more profitable in that shape, than by giving the
clerk of the market a salary, and receiving from him a weekly
account of the tolls. He was however permitted to reside in the
market-house, and had obtained a license for the sale of spirits,
which appeared to me to be an accommodation very prejudicial to
the purposes of his appointment, or to the faithful execution of
his duty.</p>
<p>The colonial regulations for the protection of the revenue of
importation are embodied in the port regulations that I have
already had occasion to refer to. They are contained in the
eighteenth and seven following articles. The power of seizing
goods that are landed at any other place than the public wharf,
or that are discharged from any ship with an intention of being
landed without a permit, or of seizing goods not entered in the
ship's manifest, is given by these regulations to all constables
or peace-officers; but the whole of the forfeitures arising from
those seizures, as well as the penalties, are declared to belong
to the Crown. The naval officer who collects the duties on
importation has no other interest in their protection than his
percentage upon the gross amount, nor has he any other assistance
in the performance of that duty than his own boat's crew, who are
convicts, and who have no powers to make a seizure. Upon the
establishment of the row-guard in the month of February 1820, it
was ordered, with a view to give protection to the revenue, that
one third part of all seizures, when duly condemned, should be
divided equally between the boatswain and crew of each boat, and
the remaining two thirds should be applied to the police-fund.
After an experience of seven months I did not find that this
appointment, however useful in purposes of harbour police, has
afforded any proof of active prevention of smuggling.</p>
<p>Considering the increase of the import trade at Sydney and at
Van Diemen's Land, and that the duties a both places are now
levied, either directly by the authority of Parliament, or
through the intervention of the authority of the governor
specially conferred upon him by the fourth section of the Act of
the 3 Geo. IV. c. 96. I should recommend that the collection of
the colonial revenue should be transferred from the naval
officers to persons named and appointed collectors of the
customs, accountable to the governor, and through him to the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. These persons should, both
in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, be required to give
security for the payment of all public monies that they may
receive in the collection of the duties upon imports, and be
guided in the execution of their own duties by the laws of
revenue in other colonies and plantations of Great Britain, or by
such other rules and regulations, as the governor, acting tinder
the authority of Parliament, is now legally authorized to
make.</p>
<p>With respect to the collection of the internal revenue of the
colony, whether derived from the duties upon spirit distilled in
the colony, from tolls of turnpike roads, from the slaughtering
duties, auction duties, annual licenses for the sale of spirits
or beer, or for brewing licenses, I should recommend that the
duty of collection, receipt, and account, should be intrusted to
an officer, to be named the colonial treasurer, and that a person
experienced in the department of the excise in this country
should be appointed to the situation of surveyor of the
distilleries in the colony, to act under the orders of the
colonial treasurer, and to account to him for the monthly
receipts of duty.</p>
<p>Similar appointments will be necessary in Van Diemen's Land
whenever the distillation of spirit shall be established in that
island.</p>
<p>At the present moment, it will be more expedient to continue
the power of proceeding for penalties and forfeitures, or for
breaches of the regulations made for the protection of the
revenue, by summary information before two magistrates of the
districts, than by process issued out of the vice admiralty
court, or the civil court under a new charter; but I should
recommend that a right of appeal to the civil court in New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land should be given to either party
aggrieved by the decision of the magistrates. The right also of
proceeding for the recovery of all duties payable to the Crown,
either in the shape of quit-rents, or arising from any other
source of revenue, and for the possession of land forfeited for
breach of condition, should, as I have already had the honour of
suggesting, be distinctly recognized in the new charter, and the
appointment of an attorney-general will afford the means, that
have been long wanting in the colony, of an effectual assertion
in the courts of justice of the rights and prerogatives of the
Crown. Amongst others, the right of succeeding to the property of
persons dying without heirs has already occurred; and an estate
of a person named Anderson, who was murdered by his wife, is now
held and administered by the clerk to the judge advocate, by the
permission of Governor Macquarie. The wife of Anderson, having
been tried and executed for the murder of her husband, the
property would have remained without protection, for there were
no heirs; but Mr. J. H. Bent, then judge of the supreme court,
conceived that he had a power, under the charter of justice, to
appoint an administrator to estates left without heirs on the
spot, and in cases where no application was made by the next of
kin, or creditors, for their administration. He therefore
appointed a person to administer the property; and on leaving the
colony, applied to Mr. Justice Field, his successor, to appoint a
new administrator. Mr. Justice Field, not concurring with Mr.
Bent in his construction of the power of the charter, declined
making any appointment; and Governor Macquarie, to prevent the
dilapidation of the estate, intrusted it to the care and
management of the clerk to the judge advocate.</p>
<p>As I found that no security or account had been required or
rendered by this gentleman, I requested him to exhibit it. The
amount of the property is not considerable; but I should
recommend, that after inquiry has been made in this country for
the heirs of Anderson, and in their default, possession of the
property should be taken on behalf of the crown; and Mr. J. J.
Moore, the judge advocate's clerk, should be called upon to
render an account of his administration, if he should not have
already done so, in pursuance of the recommendation that I gave
him to apply to the supreme court for regular letters of
administration to the estate.</p>
<p>The duties levied in Van Diemen's Land are similar to those of
New South Wales, excepting in the items of the slaughtering
duties and tolls, there being no regular slaughter-house for the
use of government at Hobart Town; and at the period of my
departure from that settlement no tolls had been collected upon
the principal road of communication between Hobart Town and
Austin's Ferry.</p>
<p>A market-house of simple construction and solid materials had
been erected at Hobart Town, but it was very little resorted to
in the year 1820.</p>
<p>The accounts of the importations at Hobart Town, and the
duties received upon them, are exhibited in the very correct
returns that were furnished to me by Mr. Beamont, acting naval
officer at Hobart Town. They embrace a period commencing in the
month of July 1815, and ending 30th December 1819.</p>

<p>The exports from Hobart Town to Sydney, in the year 1819,
consisted of 14,940 bushels of wheat, potatoes, oil; 3,620
Kangaroo skins; 182 casks of salted meat; three tons of tallow,
and a small quantity of tanned hides.</p>
<p>It has been customary at Sydney to receive the duties upon
goods imported into Sydney harbour, and re-shipped or re-exported
to Van Diemen's Land and by the return annexed to the police-fund
accounts of that settlement, I find that 5,032 gallons of spirit,
1,643 gallons of wine, and 13,133 pounds of tobacco, were
imported in this manner. In the order by which the duties on
sandal-wood and the other articles of importation were
authorized, they were to be levied "on all such as should arrive
and be landed on or after the date of the order, whether they
should be destined for colonial consumption, or re-shipment to
other markets."</p>
<p>Cases have frequently occurred in which the goods have been
imported into the harbour, but have not been lauded, and have
been either re-exported in the same vessel, or trans-shipped to
others. In both cases, however, the duties have been levied at
Sydney, contrary, as I conceive, to the letter of the order,
which declares that both importation and landing are necessary
before the duty can be levied. If these words had been in the
disjunctive, the meaning could not have been subject to doubt;
but as they now stand they do not appear to me to admit the
construction that has been invariably put upon them by the naval
officer at Sydney, acting by the orders of Governor
Macquarie.</p>
<p>Indulgence in the payment of duties has been extended in
certain cases to importers at Hobart Town, and a list of
securities for the payment of duties, amounting to the sum of
1,122<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. was transmitted to me. A
portion of this sum was paid before my departure from Hobart
Town, and all the securities were available.</p>
<p>As the expenditure of the police-funds of both colonies has
been constantly brought under public observation ever since the
commencement of the administration of Governor Macquarie, it is
less necessary for me to advert to the appropriations that have
been made from time to time, or to the general deviations that
have taken place from the purposes of its first establishment.
Those purposes were declared to be the expenses of the gaols and
police, those incurred for ornamenting and improving the town of
Sydney, and in constructing and repairing the quays, wharfs,
bridges, and streets. From the observations that I have already
made upon some of these points, your Lordship will be able to
determine how far the original purposes of the police-fund have
been kept in view. It is only just, however, to Governor
Macquarie, and to Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, to declare it as my
opinion and belief, that the funds have been faithfully applied
to the several objects declared in the accounts, and that the
particularity with which the names of the persons were always
noticed, to whom payments had been made, was the best guarantee
against malversation.</p>
<p>The accounts of the treasurer of the orphan fund have at all
times undergone an examination by the committee of that
institution, and have been published in the Sydney Gazette.
Before, however, I proceed to make any observations upon the
general expenditure of the colony, I will beg leave to state,
that of late years it has been customary to defray the expense of
extensive purchases of tools and implements required in the
public works from the colonial funds, and to defray the expense
of the lodgings of military officers, of their passage from one
colony to the other, and even those of their equipment on voyages
from New South Wales to India, from the same fund.</p>
<p>Since the practice has ceased of allowing civil and military
officers to import spirits duty-free, the revenue derived from
that source has considerably increased, but some deduction from
it was occasioned by a permission given to certain of the
soldiers of the 48th regiment, who conducted themselves well, to
the married men, and to those who were in debt, to dispose of
their allowance of spirits through the regimental paymaster, to a
person in the town of Sydney, who contracted for the purchase of
it at the rate of fifteen shillings per gallon. The proceeds were
accounted for to the captains of the different companies, and ex
tended in the purchase of clothing, or other necessaries, for the
use of the men. The amount of rum thus disposed of appears to
have been equal to half the consumption of the regiment at Hobart
Town, an arrangement of a similar kind was made through the means
of the keeper of the canteen, and the proceeds of the rations of
rum were applied in aid of the expenses of clothing, which at
that settlement was both dear and of bad quality. Although the
object with which this practice has been sanctioned was
beneficial to the soldiers, yet the disposal of so large a
portion of spirits that had not paid duty, when all other spirits
were subject to a duty of ten shillings per million, was
considered to be too great a departure from the rules that had
latterly been observed in the colony, and formed a considerable
deduction from the colonial revenue.</p>
<p>Considering the present state of the colony, I have not been
able to discover any new sources of revenue that would not have
the effect of discouraging or restraining the attempts of the
colonists to avail themselves of the productions that either
their own industry or the resources of the soil and climate may
supply.</p>
<p>The sale of unappropriated land, either to the present or
future colonists, at the prices that I have before had the honour
of submitting to your Lordship, will, in my opinion, be a more
productive source of revenue than an augmentation of quit-rent,
and will be more adapted to the present condition and resources
of the colony.</p>
<p>Taking the amount of land held by convicted persons in New
South Wales to amount to 83,502 acres, and to be subject to the
annual quit-rent of sixpence for every thirty acres, after the
lapse of ten years, that was imposed by virtue of Governor
Macquarie's instructions, the annual revenue payable to the Crown
from these lands would only amount to 69<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>Taking also the amount of the land held by the remaining
inhabitants to be 305,786 acres, and subject to the quit-rent of
one shilling for every fifty acres, imposed by the same
authority, the annual amount of quitrent payable after the
expiration of ten years would be 305<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>Considering the nature and character of the greatest portion
of the colony that has been examined, and assuming that the
character of a large portion of the remainder will be found to
bear a resemblance to it, it may fairly be presumed that its
future condition will be that of pasture rather than tillage, and
that the purchase of land will be made with a view to the
maintenance of large flocks of fine-woolled sheep; the richer
lands, which will be generally found on the banks of the rivers,
being devoted to the production of corn, maize, and
vegetables.</p>
<p>Such appears to me to be the natural and the most beneficial
course for the agricultural industry of New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land; and the only restriction that I shall recommend to
be placed upon the sale of land in either colony would be a
reservation of those portions that I have already named, for the
support of the clergy and schoolmaster, and the commons in the
neighbourhood of townships. Another source of revenue in the two
colonies may hereafter be found in the shape of postage for the
conveyance of letters. Post-masters have been appointed both at
Sydney and Hobart Town, and they receive the letters that arrive
from England, and that are authorized by a late regulation of
Governor Macquarie, published in the Sydney Gazette, and dated on
the third June 1820, to charge the sum of 8<i>d</i>. for postage
upon all single letters, to or from Britain, India, or Foreign
places, with an increase of rate upon double letters.</p>
<p>An inland postage is likewise chargeable for letters directed
to the inhabitants of the different districts in the colony, but
they are only transmitted when opportunities occur, or are
casually delivered to the more respectable inhabitants of Sydney.
A list of all the names of persons to whom letters are addressed
is exhibited at the post-office, and was formerly published in
the Gazette, but as the number of letters increased, and
frequently were not called for, the post-master found that the
expense of this mode of publication of the names increased in a
greater proportion titan his fees, and letters are now left at
the post-office in Sydney and Hobart Town, till they are called
and paid for. The annual amount of letters received at Sydney was
estimated in the year 1821, to be between 1,000 and 1,200; but I
have reason to believe that from accidental causes, and want of
means of transmission in the colony, rather than from any neglect
in the post-master, a great many of those addressed to the
convicts do not reach their destination. Their change of abode
from the service of one master to another, and their removals on
account of make it very difficult, and indeed impossible, for any
person that is not connected with the superintendence of the
convicts, to find out the actual residence of a person of that
class. The establishment of a regular communication by a post
conveyed on horseback, from Sydney to Paramatta, and from thence
to Windsor, would be beneficially felt at present, and would
relieve the constables from a great deal of duty that now
improperly devolves upon them. I conceive that the rates of
postage allowed by the order of Governor Macquarie would defray
the expense incurred for the pay and subsistence of two men and
horses, travelling constantly, three times a week, between those
places; and lay the foundation of a new source of revenue to the
colony.</p>
<p>The annual profits of the situation of post-master at Sydney
are stated by him not to exceed 100<i>l</i>. and I submit that
all postage received beyond that sum should be accounted for to
the colonial treasurer; and that with a view to check the
account, a statement of the number of letters transmitted in
every letter-bag, to New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land shall
be forwarded to the colonial secretary.</p>
<p>In considering the actual resources of the colonies of New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, and their future application
to the purposes of agriculture and commerce, it appears that the
mineral productions that have yet been discovered consist of coal
and iron.</p>
<p>The quality of the former is equal to the ordinary
descriptions of English sea coal, and it may be expected to
improve as access is opened to the seams that are more removed
from the surface. From the many indications of coal that have
been observed in different parts of the county of Cumberland and
upon the coasts, no doubt can be entertained that abundant
supplies will be found whenever attempts are properly made to
discover them. The right to all minerals has been of late
reserved in the grants made by Governor Macquarie, and I should
recommend that this reservation should be continued, and that
leases for terms of years should be granted of the coal,
reserving to the Crown an annual rent for the same, with a
certain proportion of the coal raised. At present, all the coal
that has been consumed in the colony, or exported, has been
raised by the labour of the convicts, transported for punishment
from the settled districts to Newcastle. Individuals have been
allowed to purchase coal there, and have brought it to Sydney,
for sale, but the quantity has been very inconsiderable.</p>
<p>From the high price that was demanded by the chief engineer
for the coal brought in the government vessels from Newcastle to
Sydney, and that exceeded the quantity required for the use of
the officers to whom it was allowed, the demand for it has been
much diminished. If it had been allowed to be sold on more
moderate terms the local government might have derived some
advantage in disposing of it to masters of convict-ships
proceeding to India or Batavia, on their return-voyages, who
would have always preferred it to ballast. Instead of this mode
of disposing of it, and of laying the foundation of an export
trade, the coal worked at Newcastle has been disposed of in
barter at Sydney, and at a high price, for goods required for the
public works.</p>
<p>No attempt has yet been made to convert into metal the iron
ore that has been found in New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land.
At the distance of eight miles from Port Dalrymple, in Van
Diemen's Land, considerable quantities of iron ore have been
discovered upon the surface, which upon analysis in this country
have been found to consist of pure protoxide of iron, (similar to
the black iron ore of Sweden) and furnishing a very pure and
malleable metal.</p>
<p>The other resources of New South Wales that are likely to
afford materials of valuable export consist of the great extent
of natural pasturage for the support of fine-woolled sheep, and
for the production of horned cattle and horses, the abundance of
materials for tanning to be collected from the indigenous trees,
and the facility that they will afford for the export of hides in
their dressed or raw state.</p>
<p>The cultivation of flax and tobacco has succeeded wherever it
has been tried in the richer soils of the colony, and all the
finest fruits of Europe are found to succeed and yield
abundantly, even under a very careless system of cultivation.</p>
<p>The vine has been cultivated in New South Wales from an early
period of the establishment of the colony, and one individual has
bestowed much attention upon it, though with very little success.
The grapes that have hitherto been produced are invariably found
to be affected with blight as they approach to maturity. It is
possible that with a better selection of soil and exposure, and
under more skilful management, the vine may be successfully
cultivated in New South Wales; but in a soil that consists
chiefly of disintegrated sandstone the chances of its success are
not considerable.</p>
<p>The olive-tree has been introduced into the colony by Mr. J.
M&lsquo;Arthur, and has already manifested indications of early
assimilation to the climate. Its growth and progress have
exceeded that of the olive-trees in the south of Europe, and
afford the strongest grounds of expectation that the olive-oil of
New South Wales will not be inferior to that of France and Italy,
and afford another and very important article of export either to
India or to Great Britain. With a view to accelerate the
production of olive-oil in the colony, I should recommend that
plants should be sent from England, by every convenient
opportunity in the convict-ships, and that they should ill the
first instance be consigned to the care and management of the
colonial botanist, and afterwards distributed amongst the
respectable settlers who apply for them.</p>
<p>I would here beg leave to solicit your Lordship's attention to
the importance of the establishment of the botanic garden at
Sydney, that has hitherto been attached to the governor's garden
at that Pace, and has derived assistance from the labour of the
convicts assigned for its cultivation. It has been lately placed
under the management of Mr. C. Frazer, who accompanied Mr. Oxley
in his last expedition into the interior of New South Wales, and
who also accompanied me to Van Diemen's Land, and by his care and
attention the collection has been enriched with the most curious
plants that were discovered in the course of those expeditions,
as well as by contributions from New Zealand, the islands of the
South Seas, Bengal, and China. The value of such an
establishment, both in affording means of collection and of
experiment, and more particularly of diffusing throughout the
colony the most valuable specimens of foreign grasses, plants,
and trees, is unquestionable; and I have great satisfaction in
stating that, as far as his means have allowed, these benefits
have been realized under the zealous exertions of the present
colonial botanist. A catalogue was furnished by him of the plants
that are now cultivated in the botanical garden at Sydney.</p>

<h3><i>Nature of the Expenditure of the Colonies of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> expenditure of the colonies of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land may be classed under the heads of
salaries to civil officers; salary and pay of the commissariat
department; subsistence of convicts not assigned to settlers, but
either retained, or left in the service of government, including
those confined in the gaols or in the hospitals; purchases of
materials for government works; and expenses of pay of colonial
vessels and subsistence of the crews. By abstracts of the returns
of persons holding civil offices in New South Wales in the year
1821, it appears that the salaries defrayed from the
parliamentary estimate of 1821, amounted to 8,474<i>l</i>.
17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and that those defrayed from the
police-fund, amounted to 9,824<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. In Van
Diemen's Land, the salaries defrayed from the parliamentary
estimate amounted to 2,896<i>l</i>. 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and
those defrayed from the police-fund to 2,006<i>l</i>. 6<i>s</i>.
some of the salaries included in the parliamentary estimate have
not been drawn in this, or in some of the preceding years, but
have been defrayed from the police-fund of New South Wales, such
are those of the two government school-masters at Sydney,
amounting to 60<i>l</i>. per annum each; six superintendents
according to the estimate of 1821, at 50<i>l</i>. per annum each,
and the clerk to the judge advocate amounting to 80<i>l</i>. per
annum.</p>
<p>The augmentations of salary that I beg leave to submit, are
first, that of the colonial secretary, in consequence of the
reduction of his fees on mustering the crews of colonial vessels,
that I have already proposed, and which constitute the principal
sources of his emoluments.</p>
<p>The returns made of the fees received by Mr. J. T. Campbell,
the secretary to Governor Macquarie, from the year 1816 to 1820,
give an average of 709<i>l</i>. per annum, and with the salary
charged upon the parliamentary grant, and that which is paid from
the police-fund, make up an annual income of 1,074<i>l</i>. I
should recommend therefore, that the deduction from this income
that may be occasioned by the abolition of the fees, on mustering
crews of vessels, should be made good by an increase of the
present salary from the police-fund; and that considering the
augmented duties and responsibility of the office of the colonial
secretary, that it should be raised to the stun of 1,500<i>l</i>.
per annum.</p>
<p>The present amount of the salary of the clerk in the
secretary's office is only 60<i>l</i>. per annum. The fees
received by him on the musters of the crews of vessels,
constitute a large portion of his emoluments, and upon their
abolition I should recommend that an addition to his salary of
200<i>l</i>. should be made, exclusive of the other fees that he
receives on giving certificates and emancipations.</p>
<p>Having already stated the alteration that has appeared to me
to be expedient in the office of the surveyor-general, I will now
only add, that in the estimate of salaries that I have submitted,
that of Mr. Oxley, the surveyor-general, was recommended to be
raised from its present amount of 273<i>l</i>. 15<i>s</i>. to
365<i>l</i>. per annum, on account of the increased importance
and amount of the duties that he is called upon to perform. In
the other departments, the reductions that I beg leave to
recommend are those of the office of assistant superintendent of
police, and that of superintendant of government mills, for the
reasons that I have already had the honour of stating upon the
subject of police, and those that I am about to submit on the
expediency of suppressing altogether the government mills in
Sydney.</p>
<p>The remaining appointments contained in the lists that I have
already referred to do not appear to me to exceed, either in
number or rate of remuneration, the demands of the public service
in their several departments, and they will be subject to the
augmentations that I have proposed, in the course of this and my
former Reports, in case those augmentations should be finally
sanctioned.</p>
<p>By the return of the officers in the commissariat department
at the different stations in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, their pay and salaries amount to 4,159<i>l</i>. 11<i>s</i>.
3<i>d</i>. From the observations that I was enabled to make of
the duties of these officers, I do not see that any other
reduction would be advisable in their numbers than that of the
deputy assistant commissary general at Windsor. The supply of the
station of Emu Plains is made from Windsor, but I conceive that
the duties that it requires, as well as the issue of provisions,
may be very sufficiently performed by a respectable
store-keeper.</p>
<p>The clerks in the commissariat department generally consist of
persons who have been convicts, and also of persons who are still
in that condition, but who have received tickets of leave. They
receive pay, differing in amount from 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to
5<i>s</i>. per day, and lodging-money; they likewise receive the
full ration, or that which is otherwise termed the ration and a
half, with a weekly allowance of spirits. Complaints were made to
me at all the stations of the misconduct of the clerks so
employed, but especially at Hobart Town and Launceston; and I
should recommend in future, where it is practicable, the
employment of young men who are natives of the colony, both as
storekeepers and clerks, instead of persons who have been
convicts.</p>
<p>The appointment of a commissary of accounts is one which I
consider to be particularly useful in New South Wales, in
providing some more early and local cheek upon the expenditure
than is practicable under the present system. The reductions in
the expense of this establishment must, however, in a great
measure, depend upon the mode that shall be adopted in supplying
the stores in future with provisions. Having already detailed the
reasons that have existed in favour of the present mode, and of
fixing a maximum upon the prices of the two great articles of
supply, meat and wheat, I will not now repeat them; but it was
stated to me by an intelligent officer of the commissariat
department, that government, by resorting to the supply of bread
by contract, would be able to create a saving of one sixth of the
expense occasioned by the present mode of purchasing wheat, and
issuing rations of flour. It appears that ten men are constantly
employed in the stores at Sydney for the sole purpose of turning
the grain, to prevent its consumption by vermin. This expense, as
well as that of grinding, which in 1819 was as high as 1<i>s</i>.
2<i>d</i>. per bushel, was reduced in the month of February 1821,
(by competition between the proprietor of a steam-mill and a
water-mill, to 1<i>d</i>. per bushel of every fifty-six pounds,
with a certain reservation of the bran not required for the use
of the government horses,) would be entirely saved, together with
the losses on the issue, and the fraudulent abstraction that
takes place in conveying the grain from the store to the mills,
and in returning it thither.</p>
<p>From circumstances that are perhaps inseparable from the
conduct of the commissariat department in New South Wales, and
from the perpetual temptation to plunder that it holds out, by
the necessary exposure of the property of the Crown, any system
that tends to diminish these temptations, or that substitutes the
interested vigilance of an individual for the indifference of a
subordinate officer, must be advantageous. It is for this reason
recommended that the rations bread should be baked by contract,
and that to prevent the consequences so much apprehended in the
colony, of throwing too great a degree of influence in the
disposal of grain into the hands of one individual, it is further
suggested, that the contracts should be divided, and that at
first they should be for limited periods, the precaution being
always taken to secure a certain supply of wheat, flour or
biscuit, in the government stores, to prevent the consequences of
accident or sudden disappointment.</p>
<p>Contracts for the supply of the hospitals with bread, meat and
vegetables, have lately been conducted with advantage to those
establishments, and whenever the distillation from grain has
begun to take effect, and opened a new market, I conceive that
the greatest part of the supply of bread to the convicts, and to
the civil and military establishments at the different stations,
may be conducted upon the same principles, without prejudice to
the settlers, and with a considerable saving of expense to
government.</p>
<p>Although the price of five-pence per pound at which meat has
been supplied to the government in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, is considerably lower in proportion than the price
of grain, yet I do not see any reason that exists against
resorting to the supply of meat to the King's store by contract,
upon the same principle us that which I have recommended to be
adopted with regard to bread.</p>
<p>The number of persons who receive rations from the King's
store in New South exclusive of the military, is always
fluctuating, from the arrivals of convict-ships. It also
fluctuates at the different stations in the colony, and at the
different establishments of convicts at the Sydney station, from
the perpetual changes that take place in the gangs, and their
removal, for reasons generally founded upon local convenience, or
special demand for labour. From the returns furnished from the
commissariat department, I find that the number of rations issued
in New South Wales on the loth of August 1820, amounted to
8,716&frac14;, and on the 30th of December of the same year they
amounted to 9,326. In these returns are included all the members
of the civil establishment who draw rations from the King's
store, as well as the settlers to whom convicts are assigned and
subsisted by the Crown. With the exception of two officers in
this list, the clerk of the peace, and the deputy
surveyor-general, to whom I see no reason for not applying the
former rule by which the rations of those officers whose salaries
exceeded 90<i>l</i>. per annum were taken away, I should
recommend, that all the rations allowed to that elm of
functionaries at Sydney, denominated superintendents, pilots,
jailors, school-masters, &amp;c. as well as to their families,
amounting in the whole to fifty-eight daily rations and a half,
should be taken away, and a corresponding value in money should
be paid to them from the police-fund. The principal reason for
giving this indulgence in the early periods of the colony arose
from the difficulty of obtaining animal food; and at the stations
that are at a distance from Sydney, such as Liverpool and
Windsor, where the difficulty of obtaining it is still felt, it
may be proper to allow the continuance of the indulgence in a
very few cases. At Paramatta a reduction of thirty and a half
rations might take place on the same principle as at Sydney. At
Windsor, Liverpool, and Bathurst, the rations might be continued
until a market should be established, and the population
increased. In all instances, however, in which rations from the
King's store are given in the shape of remuneration, it is hardly
necessary for me to repeat the suggestion that. I have already
made of the expediency of reducing every ration to the same
standard.</p>
<p>The number of convicts victualled in New South Wales on the
30th December 1820, including convicts at Newcastle, and the
female convicts employed at the factory in Paramatta, and
described as labourers on public works, amounted to 5,135, to
whom 7,027 daily rations were issued; the excess in the number of
rations beyond the number of persons victualled being caused by
the circumstance already adverted to, of the ration issued to
convicts in New South Wales consisting of a ration and a
half.</p>
<p>I procured a return of daily rations issued to civil officers
and settlers at the King's store at Hobart Town in February 1820,
and to the government men, wiped to them for remuneration,
amounting in the whole to 573 daily rations. The number of
rations issued to convict labourers, at the same time amounted to
522. To some of these rations and a half were issued in
consideration of the greater degree of labour that they had to
perform, and of being prevented from making any advantage of
their own time in working for individuals at Hobart Town.</p>
<p>To the constables, also, double rations were allowed, as well
as spirits, by way of remuneration; which, as I already have
observed, ought in future to be defrayed from the
police-fund.</p>
<p>At Port Dalrymple the number of rations issued to civil
officers and settlers in 1820, amounted to 302, and to labourers
in public works to 289. The same system of remunerating
constables by the issue of extra rations, spirits and slops,
prevailed at this station as at Hobart Town, and with a greater
degree of justification, as the duties levied on importation at
Port Dalrymple, though very inconsiderable, were remitted to
Hobart Town, and placed at the disposal of the
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>I have already stated the reasons that appeared to me to
justify the early abolition of this system of remuneration, and
the application in future of police-fund of Van Diemen's Lind
equally to defray the expenses incurred at George Town, at
Launceston, as well as those at Hobart Town.</p>
<p>The supplies of meat to the public stores in New South Wales
have derived occasional assistance from the public herds, and
latterly from the wild cattle, after being reclaimed.</p>
<p>The stations at which the government herds have been placed
are at the Cow Pastures, Rooty Hill, near Paramatta, at Emu
Plains, until the convicts were placed there, and at Bathurst.
The principal superintendent, Mr. David Johnston, receives a
salary of 100<i>l</i>. per annum from the police-fund; and there
are three principal overseers, each receiving salaries of
50<i>l</i>. per annum, at the several stations, with horses, and
an allowance of forage to each. At Rooty Hill and the Cow
Pastures considerable expense has been incurred from time to time
by inclosing stock-yards for the cattle, and building houses for
the superintendents, all of which has been defrayed from the
police-fund.</p>
<p>It appears by a return from the present superintendent of
stock, that seventy-five convicts are employed as stock-men and
labourers at the different stations, and a clerk at the principal
one and that the total number of daily rations drawn for the
superintendents and labourers amounted to 122, which, estimated
at 4<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per week, would give an annual cost of
1,480<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and with the salaries of
the superintendents, and slops, if regularly issued, that of
2,105<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The cattle and horses bred at the different stations supply
the government works with draught cattle; and the sheep have been
used either for the supply of the governor's table, or for the
improvement of the land inclosed and contiguous to the government
houses at Sydney and Paramatta. Their wool has been transmitted
to the factory at the latter place, and has been used in making
cloth and blankets for the convicts. Some additional expense has
likewise been incurred in the purchase of horses of a good
description, and in the employment of skilful herdsmen for the
pursuit of the wild cattle. By their exertions, 451 head of wild
cattle were re-claimed from the 1st December 1819 to the 11th of
November 1820; and from the 31st August 1819 to the same period
of 1820, 688 head of horned cattle of the government herds, and
83 sheep, had been slaughtered at the different stations,
yielding 237,229 pounds of meat, which, at the government price
of 5<i>d</i>. per pound, would produce the sum of 4,942<i>l</i>.
5<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>.; and from the 11th of February 1819 to the
month of October 1820, 173 cows had been delivered on loan to
settlers.</p>
<p>In the month of August 1819, the government stock at all the
stations, including those at pasture, as well as those employed,
amounted to 3,480, the sheep to 1,833, and the horses to 230 and
at the same period in 1820, they amounted to 3,890, 2,013 and
229.</p>
<p>The government herds have occasionally afforded very
seasonable supplies of meat to the government stores at Sydney,
when no tenders were made by the inhabitants on account of the
state of their cattle; and they have also had the effect of
preventing combinations to compel the government to raise the
price of meat by withholding supplies. They have likewise
afforded means to the government to assist settlers on their
arrival with stock, and to carry on very extensive public
works.</p>
<p>The public herds have long been viewed by the settlers with
jealousy, on account of the interference they occasioned with
their disposal of meat; but I certainly think that the
establishment has hitherto been beneficial: and although I should
recommend that the station at the Cow Pastures should be reduced,
to afford room for the location of settlers, yet, in the present
state of the colony, and with the supply of meat still
precarious, and an annual increase in the number of the convicts
transported, I cannot recommend, until the measure suggested in
my former Report, for their removal to other stations, shall have
been carried into effect, that those in the settled districts,
consisting of Booty Hill and Bathurst, should be reduced.</p>
<p>It has been customary to issue cattle from the government
herds in barter for homes required for the use of government,
accompanied with an order from the governor to the commissary to
receive the cattle at the government stores at the usual price
given for the meat. These transactions are concluded between the
chief engineer in New South Wales, and persons whose horses may
be required for the public service; and in Van Diemen's Land they
are sanctioned by the lieutenant-governor, and applied as well to
the purchase of horses as other articles required for the service
of government. It does not appear that any valuation is ever made
of the horses purchased, or of the cattle exchanged: an order for
the delivery of a particular number is given by the governor upon
the superintendent of the public herds; and it depends in a great
measure upon his selection and the accuracy of his judgment us to
the weight of the cattle, whether the terms of purchase are
advantageous to the crown, or to the person who makes the
exchange. I submit that this is a mode of purchase in which the
interests of the crown are exposed to an unnecessary degree of
risk, I therefore recommend that, in future, all purchases of
horses should be defrayed from the public fund, upon a valuation
made by two persons, one appointed on behalf of the crown, and
one by the seller.</p>
<p>A necessary consequence of this practice of exchanging
government cattle for horses was made a subject of complaint to
me by a settler, on account of the interference that it caused
with the general supplies of meat, and the postponement of the
turn of supply, for the purpose of admitting into store the
cattle bartered for horses.</p>
<p>Debts were incurred at a period anterior to the assumption of
the government by Governor Macquarie, for various articles
supplied to the settlers as well as for cattle; and in the year
1815, Mr. Assistant Commissary General Palmer received
instructions to proceed against the debtors for the recovery of
them. The original books in which the accounts of these debts
were entered did not appear to have been very distinctly kept,
and many persons have since disputed them. Confessions however
were obtained in the year 1815, to the amount of 549<i>l</i>.
18<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. and much expense was incurred by the
employment of a law agent in commencing actions for the recovery
of these debts. Mr. Deputy Commissary General Allan, having
observed that the expenses that would be incurred in this
proceeding would in all probability exceed the amount of the sums
recovered, gave orders to Mr. Palmer, in September 1816, to
suspend the proceedings, and, except as to the debts confessed, I
should not recommend any ulterior proceedings to be carried
on.</p>
<p>The whole of the debts that were considered as proveable, but
not confessed, is stated by Mr. Palmer to amount to
4,424<i>l</i>. 9<i>s</i>.; but in the examination of the list of
debtors, I found that many were either dead, or had left the
colony in a state of insolvency.</p>
<p>I had returns made of the quantities of wheat, maize and meat,
that hare been received into His Majesty's stores at the
different stations in New South Wales, from the year 1810 to the
year 1820, inclusive; with the prices at which they were
obtained, together with the loss on, issues. It has been
customary at all the stations to receive grain by the bushel of
fifty-six pounds, and issue it by the pound. The wheat grown in
different parts of New South Wales differs greatly in weight,
sometimes exceeding, and sometimes being less than fifty-six
pounds; and that of Van Diemen's Land, as already observed,
weighs much heavier than the wheat of New South Wales, and
generally as much as sixty-three pounds to the bushel.</p>
<p>The rate of loss, charged on the issue of wheat by the orders
of the officer at the head of the commissariat department,
appears to have varied at different periods, from temporary
circumstances that affected the grain iii the store; but should
recommend that in future at all the stations, both with a view to
perspicuity in the accounts of the commissariat department, as
well as to afford encouragement to the settlers to improve the
quality of their grain, the whole of it should be received by the
pound.</p>
<p>The payment adopted for the supplies of meat and wheat,
received into the King's stores at the different stations, has
generally been made through the issue of store receipts by the
storekeepers, for the quantity of the articles purchased. These
documents are drawn by the storekeepers in the form of an order
upon the officer at the head of the department, to pay to the
payee or bearer the value of the quantity of wheat or meat
delivered into His Majesty's store by the payee, at a given rate
per bushel or per pound. These instruments were made negotiable,
and were required at first to be presented for payment every
quarter, in order to be consolidated by bills on the Lords of the
Treasury. His mode of payment had subsisted in the early part of
Governor Macquarie's administration, during the period in which
Mr. Assistant Commissary General Broughton conducted the
department of the commissariat, and until the arrival of his
successor, Mr. Deputy Commissary General Allan, in June 1813.</p>
<p>This officer having been informed that the system of inning
store receipts was not approved, either by the Lords of the
Treasury or by the auditors of public accounts, proceeded with
the sanction of Governor Macquarie to issue his own notes in
payment of supplies, until circumstances occurred in the year
1815, both in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, that
appeared to Governor Macquarie to make it necessary to resort to
the former system of issuing store receipts. From that period
they continued to be issued until February 1819, when upon the
arrival of Mr. Deputy Commissary General Drennan, and under a
more recent, but verbal communication by him of the objections
entertained by the Lords of the Treasury to the system of issuing
store receipts, Mr. D[r]ennan commenced issuing his own notes
until the month of September 1820, when the store receipts were
again resumed. Great difficulty appears to have been experienced
at all periods in inducing the holders to bring them in for
consolidation within a given period, more especially at Van
Diemen's Land, where communication between the settlers and the
town was not frequent, and was some times hazardous.</p>
<p>The store receipts, therefore, were frequently detained by the
holders, until Occasion might require them to be changed, either
by the merchants for goods, or by the commissary himself, by
bills or dollars.</p>
<p>A supply of dollars for the use of the colony had been
transmitted from Madras previous to the arrival of Mr. Deputy
Commissary General Allan in 1813, and they were after that period
put in circulation; but with the view of raising their current
value in the colony, and preventing their exportation, a portion
of silver was cut from the centre of each dollar, which was
stamped and circulated at the value of 1<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. and
the remaining part of the dollar was circulated at 5<i>s</i>.
Dollars to the amount of 10,000<i>l</i>. were cut in this manner,
and have continued to be circulated in the colony at the nominal
value of 5<i>s</i>. each, together with dollars that were not
cut, and that circulated also at the same rate. These coins have
always been issued and received by the commissary, and exchanged
at their nominal value for bills upon the Lords of the
Treasury.</p>
<p>Upon Mr. Deputy Commissary General Allan's notes being
withdrawn, it was conceived that the store receipts would supply
their place. In some respects, and for the purpose of making
large payments, they had that effect; but for the accommodation
of the poorer settlers they were very inadequate. To exchange
them they were compelled to resort to Sydney, where they could
only obtain them for a bill upon the Lords of the Treasury, or
goods from the stores of the retailers. To these persons the
store receipts were and are still acceptable, for by being made
convertible at frequent and convenient periods into bills upon
the Treasury, they answer every purpose of remittance. The issue
of the promissory notes by the officer at the head of the
department, convertible as they were made by him into bills upon
the Treasury, promised a very desirable degree of accommodation
both to the settlers and to the merchants; but after that mode of
payment had been adopted, circumstances occurred in the year
1820, that proved the immediate necessity of keeping a more
effectual check than that which appeared to have been held by the
officers of that department, either upon the first issue of the
notes or their subsequent re-issue, independent of the risk of
transmitting them from Sydney to the officers at the outstations,
or of their custody there.</p>
<p>The system of payment by notes, therefore, was again changed,
and store receipts were issued after the 23d of September 1820,
for all purchases made at the King's store.</p>
<p>However beneficial or convenient the system of issuing
promissory notes by the commissary may be in the colony of New
South Wales, with a view to furnishing a circulating medium for
its internal transactions, yet from the circumstances that took
place in the year 1820, I conceive that the introduction of a
metallic local currency in the payments made from the
commissariat department would diminish the chances of forgery,
and would lead to an equally speedy and leas complicated
adjustment of the public accounts.</p>
<p>The mode adopted by Governor Macquarie for the issue of the
store receipts provided a most effectual check upon the public
expenditure, although it substituted a local check by the
examination of a committee appointed by himself, instead of the
final examination before the auditors of public accounts in
England. The store receipts were by his order, and after being
compared with the cheque books from which they were taken,
ordered to be cancelled; and as they constituted an original
voucher in the hands of the commissary, it became necessary for
him to provide himself with some new document to transmit to
England. Pay-lists were therefore provided, signed with the names
of the parties who received payment for the articles they had
furnished; but if it happened that store receipts were detained
by the holders beyond the regular period for consolidation of
them by bills, or for examination by the local committee, the
commissary would be under the necessity of taking credit in his
accounts, unsupported by any voucher, for the amount of the
outstanding store receipts. On the other hand, the system of
making payments, by the introduction of a metallic currency, is
not without its inconvenience in New South Wales, as it tends to
multiply vouchers in the office of the commissariat, and places
temptation in the way of the clerks employed there, that it may
be found difficult for them to resist, as well as for the officer
at the head of the department to control. These difficulties will
be greatly diminished to the government by the gradual
introduction of the mode of making purchases by contract, to
which I have before adverted; and it forms one of the reasons,
and perhaps the most important one, for an earlier resort to that
system.</p>
<p>The estimated expense of stores supplied to the five vessels
employed in the colonial service in one year, including the
vessel employed in the survey of the coasts, amounts to
1,620<i>l</i>. and the wages of the masters and seamen to
1,733<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>These vessels are employed in keeping up the communication
between Port Jackson and the Coal River, conveying prisoners
thither, and bringing back cargoes of wood, lime and coals. These
vessels, with the exception of the Mermaid cutter, were built in
the colony. They are strong, but are not well equipped.</p>
<p>Whenever it shall be determined to make the settlements that I
have recommended to the northward of the river Hastings, it will
be expedient to purchase two additional vessels, either of 200 or
250 tons burthen, with sufficient accommodation for the military
officers and troops, who have suffered much inconvenience by the
frequent voyages they have been obliged to make in the colonial
vessels. They should also be capable of affording good,
accommodation to the governor in his visits to the distant
settlements.</p>
<p>The estimate of expenditure in New South Wales for the year
ending the 24th December 1821, furnished by Mr. Deputy Commissary
General Drennan, amounted to the sum of 189,008<i>l</i>.; the
item of rations for the troops, civil officers and convicts
amounting to 143,370<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>It must have occurred to your Lordship, that a considerable
portion of this expenditure arises from the detention of so many
labourers in the government works, as well as of the expense of
superintendence and materials. There are at present three modes
adopted for obtaining these materials; first, by requisition
addressed to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for such as
are most likely to be wanted, not with a view to any particular
work, but to the general works in contemplation; secondly, by
purchase through the commissariat department at Sydney, by virtue
of warrants of the governor; thirdly, by purchases made by the
chief engineer, with the sanction of the governor, and defrayed
from the police-fund.</p>
<p>Respecting the first I would observe, that as long as the
convicts are employed in constructing buildings, in which
neatness of workmanship is requisite, good tools made of very
good materials will be required. These tools should in every
instance, if possible, be marked with the broad arrow, to deter
the convicts from stealing, and others from receiving them; and
the articles of supply, and the tools that appeared to me to be
most useful, were saws of different kinds, nails of the strongest
description, and planes; iron of all dimensions; bricklayers
tools; pitch, tar, rosin; the common sorts of paint, and canvas.
As the settlement of Van Diemen's Land has hardly ever partaken
of the consignments of tools and materials that have been sent
out from this country, and as there are several buildings of
importance required both at Hobart Town and Launceston, I should
recommend that, in all future consignments of tools, a proportion
of one-third should be sent to Van Diemen's Land. At both places,
however, it will be necessary to impress most strongly upon the
minds of the engineers, as well as of the higher authorities,
that the greatest, the most severe attention should be paid to
economy in the use of the supplies; and that the indulgence that
has prevailed both in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, of
allowing the convict workmen, who had occasional liberty to work
for themselves, to use the government tools, should be most
positively forbidden.</p>
<p>The purchases of materials by order of the governor have been
made through the chief engineer, Major Druitt, who has shown a
considerable degree of care in the adjustment of prices and
agreements, but less of economy in the use of the materials. It
was not his custom to purchase them by contract, but to apply to
those dealers who had the largest supplies, and were willing to
furnish them at the most reasonable rates, or to make agreements
with importers of cargoes for such portions as he required.</p>
<p>In the period in which Captain Gill of the forty-sixth
regiment had the superintendence of the engineer department, much
economy was observed; and the scale upon which the works were
conducted was then very contracted, in comparison with that which
was adopted after the appointment of Major Druitt. This officer
had the merit of great personal activity, but the details of his
department were left to the subordinate officers, who executed
very imperfectly the arrangements that he traced out to them. The
error that he committed was that of undertaking a great extent of
work, without reference to his means of control or
superintendence; and without recollecting that the means of
plunder augmented with the extension of the works. The numerous
instances in which he detected and severely punished the authors
of that plunder, combined with the repetition of the offence
notwithstanding the severity with which it was punished, ought to
have convinced him that the only means of preventing the
spoliation of the government property by the convicts was, to
multiply the chances of detection by repeated examination of the
tools that were necessarily committed to their care.</p>
<p>This precaution does not seem to have been taken at Sydney,
and there always prevailed a greater desire at this station to
complete with expedition any work or building that was suggested,
than to calculate the expense, to mature the plan, or sometimes
even to describe the dimensions. A striking instance of this was
afforded in the construction of a building that was intended as a
protection to a public well in the town of Sydney. Another
unfortunate effect of the precipitation with which the buildings
were conducted, was the unseasoned state of the timber. Such was
the extent of the demand for it at Sydney, and the rate of
consumption, that the efforts of the numerous gangs of labourers
at Newcastle and at Pennant Hills were insufficient to meet it.
In the year 1819, there appears to have been exported from
Newcastle to Sydney 90,946 superficial feet of timber of all
sorts, valued at 1,136<i>l</i>. 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; and in
the year 1820, there were exported to the same place 102,256
superficial feet of timber, valued at 1,278<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>.,
and 26,461 feet of sawn timber of various kinds, in plank, valued
at 641<i>l</i>. 8<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. In addition to the work of
cutting and sawing timber at that station, 3,915 tons of coal
were raised and exported to Sydney, of which 150 were embark in
private vessels, and 42,800 bushels of lime. These materials were
wholly expended upon the public works at Sydney, in addition to
the large contributions of lime and wood made from other stations
in the neighbourhood. I procured a return of buildings and works
undertaken, in progress, or completed since the 1st February
1810. It appeared from this document, that seventy-three
buildings of various kinds, including two vessels and several
boats, have been commenced, and that the greatest portion of them
has been completed. Without enumerating the whole, I will beg
leave to state that the most useful buildings included in this
list are, the King's store at Sydney, St. Philip's church at
Sydney, a church at Windsor, one at Liverpool, and a chapel at
Castlereagh; the repair and improvement of the government-houses
at Sydney and Paramatta, and the clearing of the grounds
contiguous to them; a parsonage-house at Sydney, one at
Paramatta, and one at Liverpool; the completion of the greatest
part of the military barracks at Sydney, the hospital at
Paramatta, and military hospital at Sydney; the improvement of
the dock-yard and lumber-yard at Sydney, the convict barracks at
Sydney and Paramatta, and the carters barrack and gaol at
Windsor; the female factory at Paramatta, the lime-kiln at
Bennelong's Point, the inclosure of the burial ground at Sydney,
the light-house on the South Head, the residence for the judge
advocate, and the judge of the Supreme Court; the courthouse at
Sydney, school-house, and new market house, and an asylum for the
aged and infirm near Sydney.</p>
<p>At Newcastle, the buildings that have been erected during the
same period, consisted of a church, an hospital, a gaol, house
for the commandant, a surgeon's quarter, an officer's quarter a
capacious workhouse, and blacksmith's forge; the construction of
a pier, of which 625 feet in length were completed in January
1821, a windmill, and a parsonage-house.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town, the buildings completed, or in progress,
consisted of a church, government-house, gaol, hospital, military
barrack and guard house, and two small bridges.</p>
<p>At George Town, they consisted of a house for the commandant,
a parsonage-house, military barrack, store for provisions, house
of confinement, working yard, and windmill.</p>
<p>The buildings here noticed may be all considered of immediate
importance to the colony; and although they are defective in the
plan, and many of them are equally so in the construction, yet
the exertions that have been made, and more especially at later
periods, are creditable, considering the general want of
professional skill in the direction, and the general character of
the labourers employed upon them.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to advert to the valuable services
of Mr. Greenway, and as far as they were employed in the public
buildings I have mentioned, the benefits derived from them have
been very conspicuous.</p>
<p>In adverting to other buildings constructed during the same
period, it is impossible to omit the mention of the general
hospital at Sydney: its merits as an hospital will be considered
hereafter; but as a building, I regret to state, that its
condition was such, at the period of my departure from the
colony, as to render the occupation of one wing dangerous, and to
afford little expectation of saving the remainder without
incurring a very considerable expense. The great error committed
in this building was that of giving it such large dimensions, at
a period when the means of construction were not within reach;
and attempting to give an appearance of grandeur and extent to a
building in which all that was required was a degree of
accommodation adapted to the actual wants of the colony, and the
capacity of future extension.</p>
<p>Without entering into the detail of the discussions that took
place between the contractors and Governor Macquarie respecting
the mutual deviations that took place from the specifications of
the original plan, and the claims for indemnity against alleged
breaches of the condition; I only state, that after very
considerable sacrifices were made of public expediency to the
provisions of the contract, the deviation made in the formation
of the roof of the building, by dividing the principal beams into
three pieces instead of framing them in one, has endangered the
whole of the structure, by laying an external pressure, that
ought to have been divided by the internal walls, upon a range of
very weak stone pillars. As there were no workmen in the colony
at the time who were capable of directing the execution of such a
building, the attempt should not have been made upon so large a
scale.</p>
<p>The buildings and works to which I have adverted in former
parts of my Report, as either being of less importance than
others that were neglected, or being finished in a style of
ornament and decoration little suited to the limited means of so
young a colony as New South Wales, and very much disproportioned
to the natural progress of its population, consist of the new
government stables at Sydney, the fountain in Macquarie-place,
the turnpike gate, and the fort at Bennelong's Point, and the
saluting battery at Dawes's Point.</p>
<p>Having already enumerated the buildings that appeared to me,
to be yet required in the colony, I will beg leave to remark that
attention is requisite to the supply of water to the town of
Sydney, and to the improvement of the tanks.</p>
<p>From the scarcity of water in the summer, and from the
difficulty of obtaining it, great advantage would be derived to
the inhabitants from the formation of tanks in all the towns, and
from opportunities that they might thus derive of observing and
imitating the construction of works to which the greatest portion
of them are entire strangers.</p>
<p>Although the general expense incurred in erecting public
buildings in New South Wales is lessened by the employment of
convicts in that labour, yet the preparation and collection of
materials that might be otherwise disposed of to advantage, and
the application of the local funds to the purchase of them,
instead of defraying the expense of the subsistence and clothing
of the convicts, can, in my opinion, be justified only by the
absolute necessity and utility of the buildings upon which the
labour and materials are so expended.</p>
<p>By the observations that I have previously made upon the
extensive employment of convicts in towns, and when necessarily
connected, during their hours of work, with the mass of the
population, it will be seen that temptations to plunder and
purloin the materials and tools are perpetually occurring; and in
the town of Sydney, where mechanical labour as well as tools are
at a high price, it is almost impossible to devise a system by
which the natural consequences of such temptations can be
effectually checked.</p>
<p>There is one species of expense, however, incurred in the
public works, which I think it necessary here to notice. From the
difficulty that formerly existed in grinding the wheat required
for the public service, two windmills were built at the public
expense in the town of Sydney, and they were worked under the
management of a superintendent, who receives a salary of
30<i>l</i>. from the police-fund, and a certain number of
convicts subsisted at the expense of the crown. The use of one of
these mills has been for some years allowed to the regiment in
garrison, and they have derived the advantage of having their own
wheat well ground, and a certain degree of profit from the
grinding of wheat for others. The other mill is still kept up;
but since the establishment of a water-mill and steam-mill near
Sydney by individuals, no necessity exists for its continuance.
The quantity of flour produced from it is very inconsiderable;
and from a calculation made by an officer in the commissariat
department, the profit derived from it does not exceed
30<i>l</i>. per annum, subject to casualties from plunder. I
should recommend, therefore, that both these mills should be
disposed of.</p>
<p>Before the determination can be finally made of removing the
convicts from the present settlements to those that may be found
practicable on the northern coasts, and for the purpose of
completing the buildings that I have ventured to suggest as still
necessary in the settled districts, the superintendence of the
works by a professional person will be found requisite.</p>
<p>The formation of the roads in the colony under the direction
of Major Druitt, and the repair of the bridges, during the last
two years, has been creditable to him; and has discovered at the
same time the insufficient, but expensive system, by which they
had been previously conducted under contacts made with an
individual in the country.</p>
<p>The circumstances that I have already stated in the conduct of
the public works at Sydney, and in other places, give me no
reason to expect that a more cordial co-operation would take
place between the chief engineer and the colonial architect than
that which had previously subsisted and I should therefore
strongly recommend, that an officer of the corps of engineers
should be appointed to the colony of New South Wales, and that he
should have the general direction and superintendence of all the
works that are conducted by convicts, either in New South Wales
or Van Diemen's Land, including also the roads and bridges that
are or may be necessary as the colonization of the country
advances. After the appointment of such an officer shall have
taken place, it does not appear to me that it will be necessary
to continue that of the colonial architect, as there are no
buildings that I have recommended, (with the exception, perhaps,
of the government-house at Sydney), in which it would be
requisite or desirable to have reference to his assistance. From
what I have already stated, your Lordship will have observed that
Mr. Greenway's architectural skill has been the means of
introducing into the building of the colony greater celerity and
better taste than had previously prevailed. The ornamental style
in which some of them have been finished cannot in fairness be
made ground of charge against Mr. Greenway, however difficult it
may have been found either to control or to contend with his
disposition to indulge in it. The appointment of an officer of
engineers, subject to the control and orders of the governor as
to the nature, plan, and extent of the works that may be
undertaken in the different settlements, will be the means of
introducing a more uniform and simple style of architecture into
the government works, and preserve a more just proportion than
has hitherto been observed between the execution and scale of the
buildings, and the actual and future resources of the colony. It
has been frequently urged, that the mode of executing works by
contract is preferable in New South Wales to the execution of it
by the superintendence of the colonial officers and the labour of
the convicts. From circumstances that occurred in the building of
the parsonage-house at Paramatta, the church at Liverpool, and of
the factory at Paramatta, I am disposed to think that, at the
period in which these buildings were undertaken, the number or
the means of mechanics in the colony were not equal to such
engagements, and that more injury to the interests of the crown
was to be apprehended from the combination of individuals to
raise the terms of contracts, than from the employment of its own
officers and its own labourers. The only mode in which these
objections could be now diminished would be by assigning to the
persons who contracted for buildings a certain number of convict
mechanics, and binding them in larger penalties, and by more
accurate specifications of the work, than have been annexed to
the contracts hitherto made in the colony.</p>

<h3><i>Medical Establishments in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land.</i></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT</small> of New South Wales in
the year 1819 consisted of a principal and assistant surgeon at
Sydney, and an hospital assistant; of one assistant surgeon at
each of the stations of Paramatta, Windsor, Liverpool, and
Newcastle; and of a superintendent of lunatics at Castle
Hill.</p>
<p>The establishment of Van Diemen's Land consisted of an
assistant surgeon at Hobart Town, one at George Town, and one at
Launceston.</p>
<p>In the year 1820, the number of assistant surgeons at Sydney
was augmented to two and, upon the retirement of Mr. Mileham at
Windsor, of Mr. Luttrell at Hobart Town, and Mr. Mountgarrett at
Launceston, the medical establishment at those places was placed
upon a more efficient footing.</p>
<p>The admission of convict patients into the colonial hospitals,
either from the service of government or from that of settlers,
has never been subject to any other limitation than that which
appeared to the surgeon to arise from the nature of the
complaints with which they were affected; and it has been
observed in my former Report, that a denial has been rarely given
to the poorer class of settlers themselves, whenever it was made
to appear to the governor, on memorials presented to him and
certified by the medical officers, that they were not in a
condition to bear the expenses of their own cure.</p>
<p>For the purpose of affording some check upon the very liberal
and extended access that had always been given to the medical
resources of the colony, Governor King issued an order, requiring
that every convict sent by settlers to the colonial hospitals
should bring with him a supply of provisions for fourteen days,
and in most of the hospitals this practice was continued to a
late period. If the convicts remained after the expiration of
that period, they, as well as free persons, were victualled from
the public store, with rations consisting of one pound of meat
and one and of wheat or flour per day, the rations being issued
conformably to lists furnished and signed by the principal or
assistant surgeons, and transmitted to the commissariat
department. The cost, therefore, of the maintenance as well as of
the medicine administered to hospital patients, with the
exception of sailors occasionally received from the ships in the
harbour, has thus fallen entirely upon the crown. Out-patients,
who were capable of being provided for at their masters houses in
the towns, were visited by the surgeons, and supplied with
medicine from the stores of the different hospitals; but it
appears that convicts holding tickets of leave, and free persons
in a state of poverty, were not admitted to partake of the
medical assistance and resources of the colonial hospitals
without a petition and acquiescence of the governor.</p>
<p>Of the number of convicts that had from time to time been
received into the hospitals, or of the numbers of those that had
received medicine or attendance, I was not able to obtain any
accurate account. By an order of Governor Macquarie, weekly, and
afterwards monthly returns, were required to be made to him as
well as to the principal surgeon at Sydney, of the patients
received into the hospitals, as well as of their discharge or
death. The returns to the governor were for some time made
regularly; but those ordered to be made to the principal surgeon
from the more distant stations of Windsor and Newcastle, have
frequently, and in later periods, been entirely omitted.</p>
<p>The causes alleged for this omission have consisted of the
want of proper supplies of stationery&mdash;of regular
communications with the town of Sydney; and in two instances that
occurred in Van Diemen's Land, of the reluctance in the medical
officers there to acknowledge the superintending authority or
control of Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth, the principal surgeon at
Sydney.</p>
<p>I found likewise that the books of the several hospitals had
not been kept with any regularity. Those at Sydney had for some
time been committed to the care of Mr. Henry Cowper, who was an
apprentice to Mr. Redfern, and whose duty it was to enter the
name of every patient on his arrival, the daily course of
treatment prescribed, and the date of his discharge or death. The
state of these books, which were only produced for my inspection
at a late period of my residence in New South Wales, was in a
great degree attributable to want of care in preserving them, and
also to the various duties that devolved upon Mr. Henry Cowper,
when only one assistant surgeon happened to be at Sydney. A
greater degree of regularity and method appears to have taken
place on the appointment of a convict clerk, named Johnstone,
whom I have had occasion to mention in my former Report, and who
was appointed to perform the duties of clerk at the general
hospital in the month of June 1818. From the imperfect reference
to the hospital books previous to this date, and from the
confused manner in which the entries of discharges and deaths
were noticed in them, the abstract that was made from them at my
request, by Mr. Henry Cowper, is not much to be relied upon. From
this document it appears, that from the month of September 1816,
to the same month in 1817, 992 patients were received into the
hospital, 337 were discharged, and forty-one died. From the month
of May 1818, to the month of October 1819, 988 patients were
received into the hospital, 560 were discharged, and eighty-six
died.</p>
<p>The books of the different hospitals having been more
accurately kept, and the returns more regularly made, after the
appointment of Mr. Bowman to the situation of principal surgeon
in the month of October 1819, the number of sick received into
the different hospitals after that date can be ascertained with
more precision. From a return it appeared, that between the month
of October 1819, to the 31st December 1820, 1,875 patients were
received into the hospital at Sydney, and 3,471 were admitted as
out-patients. Of these, 1,673 were discharged, 124 died, and
seventy-seven remained at the date of the return. At the hospital
at Paramatta, 384 patients were received during the same period,
and 348 as out-patients. Of the former twenty-two died, and 362
were discharged. The returns from the hospital at Windsor or
Liverpool, during the same period, were not included in the
general return; but in that which was made from the settlement at
Newcastle, 404 were received into the hospital, and 363 as
outpatients. Of these, twenty-six died, and 394 were discharged.
At the asylum for lunatics at Castle Hill, it appeared that
twenty new patients had been received, in addition to thirty-nine
already on the list; five of whom have died, eight had been
discharged, ten had made their escape, and thirty-six
remained.</p>
<p>It thus appears, that in the space of one year and two months,
a total number of 2,663 patients had been received into the
colonial hospitals above-mentioned, exclusive of those at Windsor
and Liverpool, as well as those at Van Diemen's Land; and that
3,182 persons had been received as out-patients.</p>
<p>The principal hospital of the colony is situated in the town
of Sydney. The defects of the old hospital, that was built soon
after the establishment of the colony, and the want of the
ordinary means of preventing escape, had impressed Governor
Macquarie with the early necessity of providing a proper place of
reception, and more secure detention of the sick, and of removing
it to a more airy and retired situation in the town.</p>
<p>As the state of the colonial funds did not then afford the
means of defraying the expense of such a building as the governor
deemed it expedient to erect, an agreement was entered into by
Mr. Broughton, then acting deputy commissary general, on behalf
of the government, and Messrs. Blaxell, Riley and Wentworth, on
the 6th November 1810, in which it is declared by them, that in
consideration of certain advantages and allowances that had been
and were to be made to them by the colonial government, they
undertook and contracted to build a general hospital in the town
of Sydney, according to a plan that had been approved by the
governor; and that it was to be commenced on or before the 1st of
May 1811, and was to be finished in the corresponding period in
the year 1814. The first stone of the general hospital was laid
by Governor Macquarie, on the 29th of October 1811. Various
delays took place in the execution of the work; and it was not
until the month of March of the year 1816, that the patients were
removed from the old hospital.</p>
<p>The terms of this contract, and the reasons alleged for the
reciprocal deviations from them by both parties I have already
adverted to in observing upon the public buildings of the colony.
For the present, therefore, I will only advert to the dimensions,
site and capacity of the general hospital at Sydney, and the
other colonial hospitals, and to the accommodation that they
afford for patients. The principal building of the hospital at
Sydney contains eight wards, four of which are upon the round
floor and four upon the first floor. Each of these wards is sixty
feet in length, twenty-four feet in width, and sixteen feet in
height. The communications to them consist of two entrances, and
two staircases of wood. The windows of the first floor open upon
a gallery covered with a penthouse roof, that is supported by
wooden columns, and that rest upon a wooden plate, supported by a
range of stone columns. Each of the wards in the general hospital
is capable of containing twenty-two patients; but if the beds
were placed four feet apart from each other, the number
accommodated in each ward would only be sixteen. With the
exception of coal cellars under the basement wall, the principal
building contains no other accommodation whatever. Two kitchens
with rooms above are placed in the rear of the principal
building; and privies, and a small washing and bath house,
communicating with the hospital by a flagged and open pathway,
are at a little distance below.</p>
<p>The situation of the general hospital is well chosen, airy,
and free from damp; and the principal building, as well as the
quarters of the surgeon and assistant surgeons, are surrounded by
a wall of twelve feet, separating the spacious area in which they
stand from the government pleasure-grounds towards the east, and
from Macquarie-street towards the west. At each end of the
principal building, and detached from it, are the homes of the
principal and assistant surgeons. The first of these contains
three spacious rooms on the ground floor, with a room that was
originally destined for a dispensary, and one in the upper story
for a dispenser of medicine, both of which have been always
appropriated to the use of the judge of the Supreme Court. The
wing appropriated to the use of the assistant surgeons is divided
into two separate residences, each containing two rooms on the
ground floor and three in the upper floor. The kitchens and
domestic offices of this, as well as the principal surgeon's
wing, an detached from their houses, but are within the area of
the hospital.</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth has stated that he was consulted by Governor
Macquarie in forming the plan of the hospital at Sydney, and
that, subject to certain alterations and conveniences, he
approved that which was adopted.</p>
<p>Mr. Redfern likewise states that he made no objection to the
plan at the time the work was begun, but that he has since found
reasons to think that it is defective, in not having the several
conveniences of wash-house, store-rooms and water-closets. Great
encroachments appear to have been made upon the accommodation
that the hospital was capable of affording to the patients sent
thither both from the town and the country districts, by the
appropriation, in the first instance, of four wards at the north
end of the principal building of the hospital to the use of the
civil and criminal courts, two wards on the ground floor being
converted into courts, and two on the first floor immediately
above being used by the judges and members of the civil and
criminal courts for retiring rooms. At a later period permission
was also given to Mr. Lewen, an artist, to occupy one of these
rooms for the purpose of painting several large pictures. Another
ward in the first floor of the hospital was also appropriated to
the reception of the medical stores, by which means, out of eight
wards that the hospital contained for the reception of patients,
three only were appropriated to that purpose until the year 1819,
when Governor Macquarie requested the judges to dispense with the
retiring rooms that had been attached to each court, and two
wards %were then given up to the use of the patients. It is much
to be regretted that this arrangement had not taken place at an
earlier period, for it seldom or ever occurred that the civil and
criminal courts were assembled at the same time. The court that
was not occupied might always have been used as a retiring room
for the court that was sitting; and it has already been observed,
that in addition to this accommodation, the judge of the Supreme
Court was permitted to use two moms in the principal surgeon's
wing as an office for his clerk, and a robing room for himself,
until an office was finished and attached to his own residence in
the town of Sydney.</p>
<p>In consequence of the encroachments thus made upon the medical
apartments of the hospital, great inconvenience is represented to
have been experienced in providing for the sick at certain
seasons of the year. Two wards were appropriated for the men, and
one for the women. In the former, there have sometimes been
placed four rows of cradles for sick patients, and as many as
ninety have been crowded in three rooms, which, according to the
ordinary arrangements, are capable of receiving only half that
number.</p>
<p>No effectual separation took place of the women's ward from
those occupied by the men, until the year 1818, when, in
consequence of a discovery of circumstances that ought to have
been anticipated as the result of unrestrained access, the very
aim ale precaution of placing bolts on the outside of the door of
the female ward was adopted, and the communication between the
wards was effectually stopped.</p>
<p>Upon the removal of the women's ward from the ground floor to
the upper floor, and upon opening another ward for the men upon
that floor, it has been found necessary to fix a boarded
partition in the gallery that surrounds the hospital, and to
place a constable at the door; but even by these precautions the
separation of the male and female patients is not so effectual as
could be wished, nor can it ever be complete unless a separate
access is made from the male and female wards to the kitchens and
privies in the yard.</p>
<p>The present hospital at Paramatta was commenced in the month
of August 1817, and was completed in September 1818. The ruinous
state of the old hospital, and the deplorable consequences
arising from it, are described in the evidence of Mr. Rouse, Mr.
Marsden, and Mr. West. They appear to have risen from want of
security against the escape of the patients; of means of
preventing their communication and intercourse with the people of
the towns, and the temptations to plunder that were perpetually
afforded, either by the patients or others, of all articles of
use or comfort that were provided for them. Orders appear to have
been given by Governor Macquarie to Mr. Rouse, the superintendent
of convicts at Paramatta, for repairs, but they were either not
attended to by him, or were of little benefit, on account of the
decayed and rotten state of the building.</p>
<p>In this hospital, as well as at Sydney, the ordinary and most
simple precautions of preventing intercourse between the sexes
appear to have been neglected; and from want of a proper place of
reception out of the hospital, the deal bodies were suffered to
lie in a passage that separated the male and female wards, until
coffins were prepared for them.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to enter with more particularity into a
detail of these or other consequences, arising from the
intercourse of convicts of both sexes disposed by habit to
licentiousness, and unrestrained by the ordinary preventions that
are resorted to in all places of reception for the sick.</p>
<p>Temporary repairs, or temporary restraints, seem to have been
very sparingly used; and under a belief, that no measure would be
found effectual until an entirely new building should be
completed.</p>
<p>The plan of the new hospital at Paramatta was furnished by
Lieutenant Watts, aide-de-camp to Governor Macquarie; and it
appears to have been framed upon that of Sydney, although the
division and arrangement of the apartments is somewhat different.
Mr. West is of opinion, that it is not calculated to contain more
than fifty patients, although during the wet season of the year
1819, and the prevalence of a typhus fever, as many as
ninety-five were admitted. It appears to be very doubtful,
whether any separation of the male from the female patients was
ever contemplated in this hospital; and no such separation was
made in it until the month of January 1819, nor were effectual
means adopted either for securing escape from the windows, or
from the area in which it is situated. It is at present only
surrounded by a high wooden paling.</p>
<p>The hospital at Paramatta has nearly the same advantages and
defies as that of Sydney. It is well situated and airy, but has
no domestic accommodation.</p>
<p>The hospital at Windsor was formerly a brewery, and formed
part of the property of Mr. Andrew Thompson. The hospital
patients had previously been lodged in a building that was hired
of the executors of the same individual, and was partly used as a
barrack; but as it was very desirable that the soldiers and
patients should as soon as possible be separated, Governor
Macquarie sanctioned the purchase of the brewery of Mr. Andrew
Thompson, and converted it into an hospital. It consists of two
rooms, capable of containing about twenty patients; an assistant
lives in a room attached to the hospital, and the assistant
surgeon has a residence assigned to him in the town of
Windsor.</p>
<p>This hospital has frequently been repaired since it was
purchased; and from being placed upon the side of a hill,
consisting of loose alluvial land, and exposed to the current of
a rivulet called the South Creek, that is very rapid in the rainy
season, the foundations have been gradually weakened, and the
bank in which they are set will require to be supported by strong
wooden piles.</p>
<p>The hospital at Liverpool was built at the expense of the
colonial government. It consists of three rooms that are all upon
the same floor, and are attached to the house of the assistant
surgeon. The hospital will not contain more than twelve patients.
The situation is airy and dry, but the rooms are too small and
badly ventilated.</p>
<p>The hospital at Newcastle was built by convicts condemned by
colonial sentences to work there, and is situated upon a sandy
hill that lies between the sea-shore and the town. It was
intended for a gaol, but was converted by Captain Wallis, the
commandant, into an hospital. The building consists of two rooms
for patients, that are not capable of receiving more than
twenty-four beds, and of two small rooms, ten feet long and six
feet wide; one of which is appropriated to the use of the female
patients, and the other to the grinding the rations of wheat for
the use of the hospital.</p>
<p>The building is of stone and rough cast, with a projecting
pediment in front, supported by wooden columns. It is much
exposed to the north-west winds, and the ventilation is sometimes
suspended from the necessity of closing the windows against the
clouds of sand with which it is surrounded. The residence of the
surgeon is at a little distance from the hospital.</p>
<p>At Hobart Town, in Van Diemen's Land, the house of an
individual had been hired for some time for the reception of
patients: it was ill situated, low, and possessed no domestic
accommodation. On my arrival I found that the foundations of an
hospital had been laid, and the building was proceeding upon a
plan that had been furnished by Mr. Evans the deputy-surveyor,
and that had been approved by Governor Macquarie. Upon
considering the plan and taking the opinion of Mr. Assistant
Surgeon Priest, who had lately arrived from England under an
appointment of your Lordship, I took an early opportunity of
submitting to the attention of Lieutenant-Governor Sorell the
expediency of several alterations in the plan, by which the
accommodation for the patients was enlarged, the ventilation was
improved, and a separation was effected between the male and
female patients; and several domestic offices were provided that
had been neglected or deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Sorell immediately adopted these
recommendations, and some improvements were promised in the
execution of the building, which I found to be extremely
defective. The situation of the hospital was well chosen, and the
ample extent of the ground attached to it will afford the means
of adding further accommodation whenever the wants of the colony
require it.</p>
<p>At Launceston a wooden building of small dimensions was
occupied as an hospital, and contained seven beds for patients.
It possesses very little accommodation.</p>
<p>At George Town a small wooden hut had been converted into an
hospital, and was capable of containing five patients. This hut
was ill constructed and without any floor, but was only intended
for the temporary reception of the sick, until a more suitable
place could be provided.</p>
<p>It has been the practice in all the hospitals of the colony to
draw the same rations for the subsistence of the patients after
the expiration of the first fortnight of their arrival, as they
had been accustomed to receive when in health. It has also been
the practice to allow the rations to be dressed in the rooms of
the hospitals in which the patients were confined. A discretion,
however, seems to have been vested in the surgeon to purchase
such medical comforts as the diseases of the several patients
required, if they were not found in the stores of the
hospital.</p>
<p>A representation of the bad effects of this practice was
submitted by Mr. Wentworth to Governor Macquarie in the month of
March 1817, with a proposal for the supply of meat, bread, and
vegetables to the hospitals, according to the orders of the
surgeon, regulated according to the state and condition of the
patients. It was also accompanied with a very detailed statement
of the comparative expense of the two modes of supply, and a
suggestion of the expediency of giving small remunerations in
money to the superintendents, clerks, and wardsmen employed.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie, not thinking himself justified in making
these alterations, in the mode of supplying the hospitals,
declined to sanction its adoption until he had submittal it to
your Lordship. The approval of the measure was conveyed to
Governor Macquarie in the year 1818, and was communicated in
December of that year to Mr. Wentworth, with a view to its
adoption on the 1st of January 1819. The circumstances that
prevented or protracted it until the arrival of Mr. Bowman in
September 1819, were not satisfactorily explained; but it was
finally and very successfully carried into effect in a fortnight
after he succeeded to the office of principal surgeon.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary for me to refer your Lordship to the
statements of the manifold consequences that arose from the
continuance of this practice, or the impossibility of preserving
order or cleanliness in the hospitals as long as it prevailed.
There does not seem to have been any want of the ordinary
attention to cleanliness in the hospital at Sydney; and it
appears that Mr. Wentworth and Mr. Redfern endeavoured
occasionally to supply the want of medical comforts, or proper
diet, by sending them from their own houses.</p>
<p>The medicine, hospital clothing, and medical stores were
deposited in one of the upper wards of the hospital, or in a room
above Mr. Wentworth's kitchen. In these rooms no sufficient
arrangement was made for the preservation of the different
articles; and it appeared by the survey of the hospital stores,
that was taken upon the retirement of Mr. Wentworth, that several
articles had received damage; and that others had been concealed
from view, from want of room or proper arrangement in the stores
in which they were deposited. It also appears, that both at the
Sydney hospital, as well as at Paramatta and Newcastle, a
scarcity of the medicines most in demand had from time to time
occurred; and that on account of the few importations of medicine
into New South Wales by individuals, it was always difficult to
obtain it by purchase.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to allude to the practice that had
prevailed in the colonial hospitals, of the surgeons supplying
their private patients with medicine from the stores in the
hospital, and the injurious consequences of such a practice to
that class of persons for whose benefit the transmission of
medicine at the expense of government was solely incurred. The
practice thus adopted by the higher officers was imitated by
those under them; and as there was no person in the Sydney
hospital charged with the duty of dispenser, or to whom the care
of the stores could be safely confided, it necessarily devolved
upon those who had other duties to perform, and who were
frequently called away from theirs special duties as surgeons to
perform those of apothecaries and dispensers. There is no doubt
that from want of a person specially appointed for the
arrangement, transmission and account of the medical stores, that
they were exposed to injury, loss and embezzlement. A gradual
accumulation having taken place at Sydney of the large cases of
lime juice that had not been used during the voyages of several
convict ships, Mr. Wentworth applied to Governor Macquarie for
permission to dispose of them for the best prices, and to apply
the proceeds to the payment of expenses incurred in the hospital.
I received an account that was furnished me by Mr. Wentworth, and
certified by him, of the disposal of the cases of lime juice, and
the application of the proceeds, which, although unaccompanied by
vouchers, I have reason to believe is correct.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowman, not having received any specific instructions
respecting the appropriation of medicine to his own use from the
hospital stores, I took an early opportunity of cautioning him to
abstain from it, unless under the special obligation of repaying
it at 50 per cent. above the original cost. An account was
ordered to be kept of all medicines so taken either by himself or
the assistant surgeons; but from the evidence of the hospital
clerk, as well as others, I was not satisfied that this duty was
strictly observed. The assistant surgeons could not be expected
to be very exact in the performance of it, as they equally
claimed the privilege of purchasing medicine with the principal
surgeon; and I also observed that demands were made upon their
time, in the preparation of medicine for his private patients,
which it did not appear to me that he had any right to claim. It
was also obvious, that as long as these supplies should continue
to be made to the inhabitants, no regular vender of imported
drugs would think of establishing himself in Sydney, or of
entering into competition with the unlimited and uncontrolled
issue of them from the King's stores. After submitting a
statement of these circumstances to Governor Macquarie, he
acquiesced in their general tendency; but as there was no
competent person to undertake the duty of apothecary and
dispenser of medicine, that charge still remains in the hands of
the principal and assistant surgeons; and the care of the clothes
and bedding is placed under the management of a convict, who now
receives a small pecuniary remuneration for the performance of
that duty.</p>
<p>I beg leave very strongly to recommend, that an apothecary and
a storekeeper should be appointed to take charge of the medicine
and stores at Sydney, that they should reside within the are: of
the hospital; and that, considering the inconvenience that has
and is likely to result from it, the practice of allowing the
surgeons to purchase medicines upon any terms from the hospitals
should altogether cease, with a strict injunction to them to
abstain from it in future.</p>
<p>It has been customary to admit into the hospital at Sydney the
sailors of the ships in the harbour, and the charges made for
medical attendance and medicine have been paid to the principal
and assistant surgeons. An account of the charges for subsistence
and medicine so supplied was submitted to me by Mr. Bowman, and I
shall recommend that, in future, it should be regularly laid
before the colonial secretary, and the colonial treasurer; and
that Mr. Bowman and the assistant surgeons at all the stations,
should be called upon to pay the value of all the medicine that
they have taken from the hospital stores, from the period in
which they entered upon their duties, with the additional charge
of 50 per cent upon the first cost.</p>
<p>With respect to the gratuitous reception and treatment of the
convict servants of the settlers into the hospitals of the
colony, I cannot recommend that the same latitude should be given
as heretofore; nor is there any reason why the masters should not
be required to pay a certain weekly sum, that will at least cover
the expense of their subsistence. I submit, therefore, to your
Lordship, that every settler whose convict servant is sent to the
hospital, should be required to pay the sum of six shillings per
week for his maintenance for the whole of the period that he
remains in the hospital; and that the same sum should be demanded
for all sailors or free inhabitants of the colony who are not in
a state of absolute poverty. Certificates of the periods for
which the servants have been detained in the hospitals, signed by
the several surgeons, should be transmitted to the colonial
treasurer, who should be instructed to recover it from the
masters, and pay it over to the commissary, to be credited in his
accounts with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.</p>
<p>With reference to the practice that has hitherto been observed
in furnishing medicine gratuitously from the hospital stores to
the officers of government, I should submit that such practice,
originating in the early necessities and scanty supplies of
medicine in the colony, is now no longer necessary, and that the
only persons in whose favour I should recommend an exception to
be made, are the clergymen and their families.</p>
<p>A statement of the present medical staff of the colony, and of
the additional number that the principal surgeon stated to be
requisite for the adequate performance of the duties at the
different stations, was sent for my Information. The present
number of surgeons in New South Wales is seven, and in Van
Diemen's Land four; and Mr. Bowman, in the statement that he
submitted to Governor Macquarie, recommended an addition of five
in the former, and one in the latter. He has recommended that
there should be two assistant surgeons at Windsor, two at
Paramatta, one at Castle Hill, (the lunatic asylum,) and one at
Bathurst. He has also recommended the appointment of an
apothecary at Sydney, and a storekeeper.</p>
<p>In the former recommendations I cannot agree, as I conceive
that when the two assistant surgeons at Sydney are relieved from
the duty of dispensing and making up medicine, and the occasional
superintendence of the stores, their duty will not be greater
than they can perform with care; nor can I admit the necessity of
two assistant surgeons at Windsor and Paramatta, when the lunatic
asylum, that is now at a station six miles distant from thence,
shall be removed to the town or neighbourhood of Paramatta, which
is perhaps the best that can be devised for it. It is necessary o
observe, that this removal should be effected with all convenient
expedition, as the lunatic asylum suffered much from the want of
proper inspection of some medical person, and from the
dilapidated state of its external and internal accommodation.</p>
<p>As I should not consider it advisable to increase the number
of convicts at Bathurst beyond thirty, or to undertake any
buildings there, I cannot join in the recommendation of an
appointment of a medical officer at that station.</p>
<p>With a view to enable the principal surgeon to perform with
regularity the important duty of occasionally inspecting the
distant stations, and the assistant surgeons to visit the sick in
the remoter situations of the colony, I recommended to Governor
Macquarie that an allowance for a horse should be made to the
principal surgeon at Sydney, and to the assistant surgeons at
Paramatta, Liverpool, Windsor, Hobart Town, and Launceston.</p>
<p>The pay of the assistant surgeons being, only 5<i>s</i>. per
day, and some difficulty having been found in inducing persons of
professional respectability and character to fill the situations,
I further recommended to the governor that their pay should be
raised to 7<i>s</i>. per day, with a ration and a servant
victualled from the store; with all understanding that this last
allowance should be confined to services that were strictly of a
domestic nature.</p>
<p>Having observed also that the expense of fuel to individuals
at Sydney was considerable and likely to increase, and that it
occasioned very little additional expense to government to supply
the medical officers with coals, I recommended that the same
allowance that was made to the military officers should be
extended to the principal and assistant surgeons at Sydney.</p>
<p>Respecting the hospitals in the colony of New South Wales, I
should recommend that the construction of such medical and
domestic accommodations, as may be pointed out by the surgeons
should be attended to, both at Sydney and the other stations; and
considering tile state of the general hospital at Sydney, and the
great expense and the little degree of accommodation that would
arise from carrying into effect the plans that have been
suggested for its alteration and support, I am of opinion that
the occasional repairs and the additional accommodation,
suggested by the principal surgeon, may be advantageously made to
it; and that whenever the occupation of the centre it of the
building should be found unsafe, the hospital may be transferred
to the present convict barrack at Sydney.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude this part of my subject, without
representing to your Lordship the zealous exertions that were
made by Mr. Principal Surgeon Bowman, to give effect to the new
arrangements introduced into the hospitals soon after he
succeeded to his present appointment, as well as the state of
order and cleanliness in which I always found them upon many
occasions in which I unexpectedly visited them. The attendants
employed consisting entirely of convicts indiscriminately
assigned from the convict ships as they arrived, or as others
were dismissed, great difficulty exists in enforcing attention to
orders for the care of the patients, and in preventing the
plunder of the hospital stores.</p>
<p>The only remedy that I am able to suggest for these evils is
the selection of convicts recommended for previous attention and
diligence in other situations; and the allowance of small
pecuniary rewards to those who conduct themselves well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p><small>I HAVE</small> thus endeavoured to submit to your
Lordship's consideration, the results of my inquiries into the
several objects pointed out in my instructions, as well as a
statement of the measures of colonial regulation, that might form
the basis of any future change in the administration of the
colony, either as a place of punishment, or as a colonial
dependency of the crown.</p>
<p>I greatly regret that I have not found it practicable, even
with the closest attention, to bring my Report to a conclusion at
an earlier period; but the multifarious nature of the materials
from which it was derived, and the detailed manner in which I
thought it necessary to present it, with a view to information
upon points that were of a practical nature, has greatly exceeded
my estimate of the time and labour that I have found necessary to
complete it.</p>
<p>In the acquirement and collection of those materials, during
my residence in the colony, I feel it my duty to state, that I
received every assistance and support that it was in the power of
Governor Macquarie, or Lieutenant-Governor Sorell to afford; and
I feel an additional satisfaction in stating, that whatever was
the difference of opinion or of feeling, that occurred between
those officers and myself upon public subjects, I continued to
experience from them every mark of public respect and
attention.</p>
<p>The nature of the investigations with which I was charged, and
the incidental inquiries to which they also gave rise, was such
as to have excited in ordinary minds a natural degree of jealousy
and mistrust; but I deem it an act of justice, both to Governor
Macquarie and lieutenant-Governor Sorell, to declare that there
was no point upon which I either solicited information, or
intimated a wish for explanation, in which they did not manifest
an earnest and a sincere desire to afford it or to direct me to
the sources from whence the most authentic intelligence could be
obtained. Previous to my departure from the colony, I took an
opportunity of publicly expressing my thanks to the judges,
magistrates, and civil officers, for the readiness with which
they had acquiesced in all my demands upon their time and
attention; and of declaring the satisfaction with which I should
be enabled to submit to your Lordship, the testimony of
respectful acquiescence that had been shown by all classes of the
inhabitants, in the authority as well as in the objects of my
commission. From a careful and anxious review of the
circumstances connected with it, I have found no reason to alter
that opinion; and although I cannot but feel, that in a colony
composed as that of New South Wales, the reluctance or the
readiness to give testimony may be ascribable to the effect of
influence, to the hope of favour, or to the gratification of
personal feelings; yet I trust that the efforts I made to
counteract the operation of those feelings will be found to have
been successful; and that they will have enabled me to afford to
His Majesty's Government, the means of introducing beneficial
improvement into those portions of the colony that are
susceptible of it, and of correcting in others any insensible
deviations from the primary objects of the Establishment.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>The Prince Regent, having had under his consideration the
actual Circumstances of the Colony under your Government, more
particularly with a view of ascertaining how far in its present
improved and increasing State, it is susceptible of being made
adequate to the Objects of its original Institution, has been
pleased to direct that a special Commissioner <a href="#note-001"
name="noteref-001" id="noteref-001">{1}</a> should proceed to New
South Wales, and should there conduct the enquiries necessary to
this important Object.</p>
<p>The Gentleman selected for this Duty is Mr. John Thomas Bigge,
<a href="#note-002" name="noteref-002" id="noteref-002">{2}</a>
who has for many years filled a high Judicial Situation in one of
His Majesty's Colonies with the Entire Approbation of His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent.</p>
<p>In order to explain to you more distinctly the Objects of his
Appointment, I have the Honor to enclose a Copy of the
Commission, and of the Instructions with which he has been
furnished.</p>
<p>As it may be necessary for him in the course of his Enquiry to
have the Power of Administering an Oath to the Persons, whose
Testimony he may require, it is the Pleasure of His Royal
Highness that you should immediately on his arrival in the Colony
appoint him a Justice of the Peace and Magistrate for the
Territory; you will further give him every Facility of Access to
Official Documents, and every other Assistance in your power in
the prosecution of the Objects of his Commission.</p>
<p>During the interval, which has elapsed between Mr. Bigge's
Appointment and his Departure for the Colony, he had free access
to all the Correspondence connected with the Colony, and has been
put perfectly in possession of the views of His Majesty's
Government; His Royal Highness has therefore been pleased to
instruct Mr. Bigge to recommend to your immediate Adoption any
Alteration or Improvement of the System at present in force in
the Colony, which he may consider necessary either for the Remedy
of existing Evils, or for the prevention of Causes of Complaint
in future, and I have only to desire that you would give to his
recommendations in this particular the weight due to them by an
early, if not an immediate, adoption of them. Should however any
case occur, in which you may deem it adviseable to take upon
yourself the heavy responsibility of declining to adopt his
suggestions, you will communicate to me without delay the reasons
of your Refusal for the special consideration and Decision of His
Royal Highness.</p>

<p align="center"><b>EARL BATHURST TO MR. COMMISSIONER BIGGE.
[1]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>As the time is now approaching for your Departure for New
South Wales in the execution of the Duty to which His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent has been pleased to appoint you, it
becomes my Duty to direct your attention to those points which
will, on your arrival in the Colony, form the leading Object of
your Enquiry.</p>
<p>You are aware of the causes which first led to the Formation
of the Settlements in New Holland. As they were peculiar in
themselves, these Settlements cannot be administered with the
usual Reference to those general Principles of Colonial Policy,
which are applicable to other Foreign Possessions of His Majesty,
Not having been established with any view to Territorial or
Commercial Advantages, they must chiefly be considered as
Receptacles for Offenders, in which Crimes may be executed at a
distance from home by punishments sufficiently severe to deter
others from the Commission of Crimes, and so regulate, as to
operate the Reform of the Persons by whom they had been
committed. So long as they continue destined by the Legislature
of the Country to these purposes, their Growth as Colonies must
be a Secondary Consideration, and the leading Duty of those, to
whom their Administration is entrusted, will be to keep up in
them such a system of just discipline, as may render
Transportation an Object of serious Apprehension. While the
Settlements were in their Infancy, the Regulations, to which
Convicts were subjected on their arrival, were sufficiently
severe, and were moreover capable of being strictly and uniformly
enforced. Hard Labour, moderate Food, and constant
Superintendance were, and (what was at least of as much
Importance) were believed in this Country to be the inevitable
consequences of a Sentence of Transportation, varying only as to
the period during which they were enforced, either according to
the original Sentences of the Convicts or to the Evidence, which
their Conduct in the Settlement afforded of their Progress
towards Amendment and Reform. At this time it appears that
Transportation to New South Wales answered every end of
Punishment; For while it operated, not very severely though
always beneficially, on the Convicts themselves, the opinion of
its severity in this Country was so enhanced by the distance of
the Settlement and the little which was known of it, that it was
an object here of peculiar Apprehension. <a href="#note-003"
name="noteref-003" id="noteref-003">{3}</a> There are instances
on record, in which Convicts have expressed their desire that the
Sentence of Transportation might be commuted even for the utmost
Rigour of the Law, and it is not too much to assert that the
Punishment did then materially contribute to prevent the
Commission of those Crimes to which it was at that time more
particularly confined.</p>
<p>Many Circumstances however have since concurred to render the
Punishment lighter in itself, to diminish the Apprehension
entertained in this Country of its Severity, and to break down
all proportion between the punishment and the Crimes for which it
is now inflicted.</p>
<p>You will find these circumstances detailed in my Letter
<a href="#note-004" name="noteref-004" id="noteref-004">{4}</a>
to Lord Sidmouth, in which I first suggested the expediency of
this Commission. Every Information which I have since received,
and every consideration which I have since given to the subject,
confirms me in the conviction that an Investigation is become
necessary. Since the writing of that Letter, Intelligence has
been received of the arrival of that large body of Convicts,
which I then noticed to be under Sentence of Transportation, and
the number, on whom this Sentence has since been passed, has
considerably increased. In addition to which, a Great proportion
is for Offences of that Magnitude in Moral Depravity, or of such
serious Mischief to Society, as have been generally expiated by
the utmost Rigour of the Law. While Transportation to New South
Wales is thus applied as an adequate Punishment for the most
Heinous Crimes, it unfortunately at the same time carries with it
in Public Estimation so little of Apprehension in any proportion
to the Guilt of the Convicts, that numerous applications are made
from those who are sentenced to Imprisonment for Minor
Transgressions that they may be allowed to participate in the
Punishment to which the greatest Offenders are condemned.</p>
<p>Such being the actual State of Things, it appears to The
Prince Regent most important that the first Object of your
Enquiry should be to ascertain whether any and what Alteration in
the existing system of the Colony can render it available to the
purpose of its original Institution, and adequate for its more
extended application. With a view to this you will examine how
far it may be possible to enforce in the Colonies already
established, a System of General Discipline, Constant Work, and
Vigilant Superintendance. The Latter must necessarily be
understood to comprise complete separation from the Mass of the
Population, and more or less of personal Confinement, according
to the Magnitude of the Offence. You will therefore pay
particular Attention to the possibility of providing Buildings
proper to the Reception of all the Convicts, the want of such
Buildings having been frequently and justly represented by the
Governor as one main Obstacle to the Enforcement of Discipline.
Should it appear to you, as I have too much reason to apprehend
will be the Result, that the present Settlements are not capable
of undergoing any efficient Change, the next Object for your
Consideration will be the expediency of abandoning them
altogether as Receptacles for Convicts, and forming on other
parts of the Coasts, or in the Interior of the Country, distinct
Establishments exclusively for the Reception and proper
Employment of the Convicts who may hereafter be sent out. From
such a Measure, it is obvious that many Advantages must result.
It would effectually separate the Convict from the Free
Population; the Labour of forming a New Settlement would afford
constant means of Employment and that of a severer Description.
By forming more than one of such separate Establishments, the
means of classifying the Offenders, according to the Degrees of
Crime, would be facilitated, and that salutary Apprehension of
the punishment revived, which can alone make it available to the
grave Offences to which it is at present applied. But on the
other hand you will have to consider, what would in the first
instance be the expence of the measures, which you might think
yourself justified in recommending, and what may be the probable
Amount of Annual Charge, which may result from their Adoption. I
need not impress upon you the necessity of making your Estimates
as accurate as circumstances will admit, for it will be obvious
to you that in order to enable His Majesty's Government to decide
whether it is adviseable to continue, or to alter, or to abandon
the System, which for near Forty Years has been pursued, it will
be most material for them to know, not only the means by which
Transportation can be rendered an effectual Punishment for the
Prevention of Crime, but also the Expence at which, as compared
with other Systems of Punishment, it can be enforced.</p>
<p>I have only in conclusion to desire that you will in the whole
course of your enquiries constantly bear in mind that
Transportation to New South Wales is intended as a severe
Punishment applied to various Crimes, and as such must be
rendered an Object of real Terror to all Classes of the
Community. You must be aware that it is taking but an imperfect
view of the end of Punishment, if you look only to the state of
those on whom it is inflicted. The Great End of Punishment is the
Prevention of Crime, and as there are gradations in Crimes,
against the Commission of which the Legislature is bound to guard
in proportion to their moral Turpitude or to the injurious
Effects which, either necessarily in themselves or from the
Circumstances under which they were practised, they may have on
the Community, the sufferings of those, to whom punishment is
awarded, do not answer the purpose for which they were inflicted,
unless they are in some degree proportioned to the Offences
committed, and of a Character to deter others from Similar
Misdeeds. Transportation must not be considered like imprisonment
in Gaol applicable to the suspected and unfortunate in common
with the criminal, but it operates exclusively on convicted
Guilt, and that too as a part (not the most effectual part) of
the punishment assigned to it. For mere Expatriation is not in
these days an Object of considerable Terror. The Intercourse,
which it breaks, is readily reestablished, and the Mystery, which
used to hang over the Fate of those condemned to it, can never
long exist. It is the Situation of the Convicts in the place to
which they shall have been consigned, the strict Discipline, the
unremitting Labour, the severe but wholesome privations to which
they are condemned; It is their sad Estrangement from the sweets
and comforts of a Life, which their Guilt has forfeited, and the
Mercy of His Majesty has spared, and above all the strong feeling
impressed upon this Country that such is the unavoidable Fate of
the unhappy Men, on whom the Sentence has passed, that can alone
make Transportation permanently formidable. If therefore, by ill
considered Compassion for Convicts, or from what might under
other circumstances be considered a laudable desire to lessen
their sufferings, their Situation in New South Wales be divested
of all Salutary Terror, Transportation cannot operate as an
effectual example on the Community at large, and as a proper
punishment for those Crimes against the Commission of which His
Majesty's Subjects have a right to claim protection, nor as an
adequate Commutation for the utmost Rigour of the Law.</p>

[2]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In the course of the enquiries, which you are authorized under
your Commission to institute in New South Wales, the conduct of
the several persons in authority in that Colony will necessarily
come under your particular Review, and as you are aware, from the
free access which you have had to the correspondence of this
Department, of the Grounds on which the Conduct of many of the
Servants in that Colony has been subjected to accusation, you
will not fail to enquire how far the reports, which have from
different quarters reached His Majesty's Government, are
deserving of Consideration. But although I am to desire that you
do not permit your respect for any Individual, however exalted in
rank or sacred in Character, to check an Investigation of his
Conduct, in cases in which you deem it to be necessary, yet I am
equally to impress upon you the necessity of not divulging in the
Colony the opinion, which you may ultimately form as to the
justice of the original suspicion. The Result of your
Investigation, and the Evidence by which it is to be supported,
is to be communicated to His Majesty's Government alone, and,
although it will be your Duty to furnish them with the most ample
details, it will be no less incumbent upon you to prevent any
disclosure in the Colony, which could only have the Effect of
inflaming existing Resentments and disturbing the Tranquillity of
the Colony, during the Interval which must elapse between your
departure from the Settlements and the final Decision of His
Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>Should however the result of your enquiries, either on this or
any other subject, lead you to entertain an opinion that the
system, which has been pursued in any Department, is either so
bad in itself or so liable to Abuse as to render an immediate
Alteration desireable, you will consider yourself authorized to
express to the Governor in writing the several Improvements and
Alterations, which you deem it your Duty to recommend to his
immediate Adoption, and you will consider the Instruction as
applying to every branch of Administration with the exception of
the Distribution of the Military Force.</p>

<p align="center"><b>EARL BATHURST TO MR. COMMISSIONER BIGGE.
[3]</b></p>
<p align="right">Downing Street, 6th January, 1819.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have already had the occasion to point out to you those
Objects of Enquiry on your arrival in New South Wales, which are
connected with the Administration of the Settlements there as fit
Receptacles for Convicts; but although the Prince Regent
considers these to be the most important and therefore the main
Objects of your Investigation, yet His Royal Highness is also
desirous of availing himself of your presence in that Quarter in
order to obtain a Report upon the variety of Topics, which have
more or less Reference to the Advancement of those Settlements as
Colonies of the British Empire. It becomes therefore my Duty to
detail to you the Subjects, upon which it appears requisite that
you should furnish every Information in your power, and in doing
so I deem it necessary to premise that, in any opinion you may be
led to form with respect to any change in the existing Regulation
of the Colony, you must always bear in mind the possibility of an
Abandonment of the present System of Transportation so far as
regards the existing Settlements, and must therefore in
recommending any Measures for adoption carefully distinguish how
far you consider them applicable to the Settlements in their
actual State, or only to that in which they would be placed in
the event of the Convict part of the Population being henceforth
diverted to other Stations.</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Courts of Justice will form the first
subject of such an enquiry. It will be for you to consider
whether the Alterations introduced into the Constitution of the
Courts in 1812 have rendered them adequate to the wants of the
Inhabitants, and to the due Administration of Criminal and Civil
Justice, and, if they still appear to you to be defective, to
suggest the Improvement of which you conceive they are
susceptible. You will also particularly report whether the
Settlements in Van Diemen's Land have advanced so far in
Population and Wealth, as to require a Judicature altogether
separate and distinct from that of the Principal Settlements in
New South Wales. In connection with the Judicial Establishments,
you will not fail to review the Police Regulations of the Colony,
and the manner of their Application to the several Classes of
Inhabitants whether Free Settlers or Convicts; It will form also
a Branch of your Investigation to point out whether, in a
Population so compounded as that of New South Wales, it be
consistent with safety to dispense with any of those more severe
provisions, which have frequently given rise to complaints, and
which cannot but be irksome to the Free Inhabitants of the
Colony.</p>
<p>You will also turn your Attention to the possibility of
diffusing throughout the Colony adequate means of Education and
Religious Instruction, bearing always in mind in your suggestions
that these two Branches ought in all Cases to be inseparably
connected. The Agricultural and Commercial Interests of the
Colony will further require your Attentive Consideration. With
respect to them, you will both report to me their actual State
and the means by which you consider they can be most readily
promoted. It cannot fail to have struck you that many of the
Colonial Regulations are at variance with the general Principles,
by an Adherence to which such Interests are usually advanced.
Among those which in this point of view must have appeared of
very questionable Expediency, I would more particularly refer to
the Authority which the Governor has hitherto exercised of fixing
the Prices of Staple Commodities in the Market, and of selecting
the Individuals who shall be permitted to supply Meat to the
Government Stores. With respect to these Regulations, you will
investigate how far their Repeal is likely to lead to any General
Inconvenience or to any Public Loss. I am aware that when the
Colony was first established the necessity of husbanding the
scanty means of Supply, and regulating its Issue, might justify
an Interference on the part of the Government, but now that the
Quantity of Land in cultivation is so much increased, and the
number of cultivators proportionately enlarged, so as to preclude
on the one hand all fear of want, and on the other a General
Combination of all the Cultivators against the Government, I
confess that I have great reason to doubt the expediency of these
Regulations. At the same time, I feel unwilling to recommend so
material an Alteration without some examination on the spot as to
its probable Effects. It will therefore be for you to report to
me whether the Markets may not be freed either gradually or all
at once from such restriction, whether the Competition of Traders
will not here as elsewhere produce the most beneficial Effects,
and whether the Government Stores may not be supplied (as in
other Colonies) by Public Tender, with equal Advantage both to
the Public and to the Individual Cultivator.</p>
<p>Another Subject of enquiry will be the propriety of permitting
in future a Distillation of Spirits within the Colony. From the
access, which you have had to the Correspondence, you are aware
of the Grounds upon which this measure has been so frequently
recommended by the Local Government, and of those reasons which
have induced His Majesty's Government hitherto to withhold their
Sanction; I need not therefore enter into the details of this
Discussion. The main question, now at issue, is whether a
Distillation of Spirits in the Colony could be so checked and
controlled as to prevent the indiscriminate and unrestrained
Dissemination of Ardent Spirits throughout a Population, too much
inclined already to an immoderate use of them, and too likely to
be excited by the use of them to Acts of Lawless Violence; and to
this your enquiry in this particular will be principally
directed.</p>
<p>It will not be unimportant for you to enquire into and report
upon the actual and Probable Revenues of the Colony, whether they
may be looked to hereafter as affording the means of defraying
some part of the heavy expenditure annually incurred on account
of New South Wales, and whether they are in any and in what cases
susceptible of Increase without prejudice to the Prosperity and
Welfare of the Settlements.</p>
<p>There is one other point also, which I cannot avoid
recommending to your consideration, though I fear there is not
much prospect of your being able to reconcile that difference of
opinion which has prevailed in the Colony. I allude to the
Propriety of admitting into Society Persons, who originally came
to the Settlement as Convicts. The Opinion, entertained by the
Governor and sanctioned by The Prince Regent, has certainly been
with some few exceptions, in favor of their reception at the
expiration of their several Sentences upon terms of perfect
Equality with the Free Settlers. But I am aware that the Conduct
of the Governor in this respect, however approved by the
Government at home, has drawn down upon him the Hostility of many
persons, who hold association with Convicts under any
circumstances to be a degradation. Feelings of this kind are not
easily overcome, but I should be unwilling to forego the
possibility of reconciling the conflicting opinions on this
subject by not adverting to it as a proper question for your
consideration.</p>
<p>I forbear to enter into a variety of other minor points of
detail, which will necessarily fall under the several Heads of
enquiry which I have pointed out to you, because I am confident
that no important point will be left unnoticed in the report
which you may ultimately furnish, and that you will be as anxious
to afford, as His Majesty's Government are to receive, every
Information necessary to form an opinion with respect to the
Police, the Agriculture, the Commerce, the Revenue, or the State
of Society in the Settlements, to which you are about to
proceed.</p>

<p align="center"><i>A special Commissioner.</i></p>
<p>The conclusion of the Napoleonic wars enabled the British
government to pay more attention to the development of the
colonies. The colony had been established under Governor Phillip
purely as a penal settlement. Major Grose and captain Paterson
had carried on the administration from the time of Phillip's
departure to the arrival of Governor Hunter. During this period
certain individuals, chiefly of the military party, commenced to
acquire wealth. Hunter in his government was confronted with a
new problem in the birth of vested interests. The clash of these
interests with the idea of a penal settlement and the
misrepresentations that were made to England caused Hunter's
recall. He was succeeded by Governor King, who met with a similar
fate, to be in turn succeeded by Governor Bligh. By this time,
the party which had caused the unrest had become stronger, and
Bligh's government, therefore, terminated in his deposition.
Governor Macquarie was sent to reorganise the colony. He
attempted to elaborate the idea of a penal settlement. He
discouraged the immigration of free settlers. He adopted his
policy for the encouragement of emancipists; but this policy
assisted in the removal of some of the terrors of transportation.
At the same time, the settlers, who had adopted the colony as
their home, agitated for various reforms, and adverse
representations were made against Macquarie's administration. It
is probable that the colonial office was in a quandary as to the
merits and demerits of the colony as a penal settlement, of the
agitations for reform, and of the principles of Macquarie's
administration, and that for this reason the appointment of a
commissioner of enquiry was made.</p>

<p>John Thomas Bigge was the second son of Thomas Charles Bigge,
of Long Benton, Northumberland, and was born in the year 1780. He
was educated at Newcastle Grammar school, Westminster school, and
Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1801 and M.A. in
1804, and two years later was admitted a barrister of the Inner
Temple. After some practice at the bar, he was appointed, in
1815, chief justice and judge of the vice-admiralty court at
Trinidad. He had thus acquired some colonial experience before
his appointment to the commission of inquiry into the state of
New South Wales. His report caused much bitterness in the colony,
and he was publicly accused even of causing Macquarie's early
death. Shortly after his return to England from this inquiry, he
was given a similar commission to inquire into the state of Cape
Colony, where he did excellent work in exposing the corruption
amongst the officials employed there. This mission lasted for
several years; during that time his leg was injured by a fall
from a horse, and for two years he was under the treatment of a
quack, who turned out to be a female. He died in the year
1843.</p>

<p align="center"><i>It was an object here of peculiar
Apprehension.</i></p>
<p>In the year 1718 a statute, 4 Geo. I, c. II, was passed, which
authorised transportation, and established the machinery for
carrying it into effect. It provided that this punishment should
be substituted for branding and whipping, and that, in cases of
death sentences, the King might commute the punishment to
transportation for life or a fixed period to some part of the
American colonies. It was further provided that prisoners so
sentenced should be conveyed, transferred and made over "to the
use of any persons contracting for their transportation, to them
and their assigns", for the term of their sentence. The convicts
thus became the property of the contractors, upon whom no
restrictions were placed as to the manner of dealing with such
property. The contractors, who were usually shipowners, sold the
convicts as virtual slaves to the highest bidder, as soon as they
were landed in the American colonies. The colonial masters of
convicts made them work in the fields together with the black
slaves, and they were equally punished with the lash for idleness
and disobedience. The horrors of such a system naturally created
a dread of transportation.</p>
<p>By an order in council, dated 6th December, 1786, this system
was made applicable to the territory of New South Wales. But the
practice of selling the convicts on arrival at the place of
transportation was never adopted. In its stead, a ship was
chartered, the convicts were assigned to the owners or master,
who at the time of assignation agreed for a nominal sum to
re-transfer the services of the convicts to the governor or
lieutenant-governor at the port of debarkation. Whilst the colony
was in its infancy, and reports were received in England of
hardships endured, of subsisting on reduced rations, and being
clothed in rags, the thought of transportation to Botany bay, as
the settlements were commonly known, was dreaded, and acted as a
deterrent to crime. But when stories of prosperity, and of wealth
rapidly acquired by convicts and ex-convicts, reached England,
the dread rapidly disappeared. The attempt to revive this fear
was the cause of the rigorous systems adopted at Norfolk island,
at Port Arthur and Macquarie harbour, Tasmania, and Port
Macquarie, N.S.W.</p>

<p align="center"><i>My Letter to Lord Sidmouth.</i></p>
<p>The letter to Lord Sidmouth was dated "Downing Street, 23rd
April, 1817", and was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My Lord,</p>
<p>"I have for some time past had under consideration the present
State of the Settlements in New South Wales, principally with a
view of satisfying myself whether they are now calculated to
answer the object, for which they were originally established, or
whether it might not be expedient to introduce some alteration in
the existing system.</p>
<p>"Until a recent period the Transportation of Offenders to New
South Wales appears to have answered in a very great degree the
ends, for the Attainment of which it was adopted. The many
instances of persons returning from Transportation and becoming
afterwards useful Members of Society here, and the far more
numerous Cases in which Convicts, after the expiration of their
Sentences, became industrious Settlers in the Colony, are
sufficient to prove the Efficacy of the System in its Infancy, as
far at least as regarded the Improvement and Reform of the
Offenders. So long as the Colony was principally inhabited by
Convicts and but little advanced in Cultivation, the strictness
of the Police Regulations, and the Constant Labour under due
restriction, to which it was then possible to subject the
Convicts, rendered Transportation as a punishment an object of
the greatest Apprehension to those who looked upon strict
Discipline and Regular Labour as the most severe and the least
tolerable of Evils.</p>
<p>"It was not long however before the Settlements were found to
hold out to many Individuals inducements to become cultivators,
and thirty Years' experience of the Climate and Fertility of the
Soil has for some time past rendered a permission to settle in
New South Wales an object of anxious solicitude to all, who were
desirous of leaving their Native Country and had capital to apply
to the Improvement of Land. This System together with the Number
of Convicts, who after the Expiration of their Sentences remain
with their respective Families growing up under them, has so
increased the population of Free Settlers that the prosperity of
the Settlement as a Colony has proportionably advanced, and hopes
may reasonably be entertained of its becoming perhaps at no
distant period a valuable possession of the Crown. It is this
very circumstance which appears to me to render it less fit for
the object of its original Institution. The Settlers feel a
Repugnance to submit to the Enforcement of regulations which,
necessarily partaking much of the Nature of the Rules applicable
to a Penitentiary, interfere materially with the exercise of
those rights which they enjoyed in this Country, and to which as
British Subjects they conceive themselves entitled in every part
of His Majesty's Dominions. The greatest Objection however to the
present system arises from a cause over which Regulations in the
Settlement will not have any immediate Control. During latter
Years, the Number of Convicts annually transported has increased
beyond all Calculation, as will appear by a Reference to the
enclosed Return; and I am apprehensive that Your Lordship will
not be able to hold out any expectation that the Crimes to be
punished by Transportation will diminish in Magnitude or
Frequency, or that the Numbers to be transported will in this or
indeed in succeeding Years be less considerable. This continued
Influx must annually increase the Difficulty, which has long
began to be experienced of enforcing on the Convicts such a
strict Discipline, both as to Labour and Deportment, as is
essentially necessary to make Transportation answer the purpose
either of Punishment or Reform. The Difficulty of finding Regular
Employment for them has been such that it has been the practice
of Late Years to grant Tickets of Leave, almost without
exception, to those who had any prospect of obtaining a
Livelihood by their own exertions, and also to place a greater
proportion as Servants in the Families of Free Settlers. In the
former Case, the Convicts could be subjected to little more than
a nominal Restraint; and, in the latter, it is obvious that with
less regular Labour they must enjoy a freedom inconsistent with
the Object proposed in transporting them. Another Evil resulting
from the increased Number is the great Difficulty of subjecting
any of the Convicts to constant Superintendance either during the
Hours of work or Relaxation; and the necessity of leaving to a
large proportion of them the care of providing themselves with
their own Lodging during the night from the inadequacy of Public
Buildings, allotted to their Reception, forms one of the most
formidable objections to the present system. These Evils, and
more especially the Last, have been recently brought under my
Consideration by various persons, and also by the Governor, who
has coupled his Representations with a Recommendation that
Buildings should be erected for the reception of all the
Convicts; but the heavy expence of such a Work, if it be intended
that the New Buildings should encrease with the encreasing Number
of persons to be lodged in them, has induced me to decline my
sanction to this Recommendation except to a very limited Extent.
I am not however the less sensible of the Evil, nor can I conceal
from myself that Transportation to New South Wales is becoming
neither an object of Apprehension here nor the means of
Reformation in the Settlement itself, and that the Settlement
must be either placed upon a footing that shall render it
possible to enforce, with respect to all the Convicts, strict
Discipline, Regular Labour, and constant Superintendance, or the
System of unlimited Transportation to New South Wales must be
abandoned. I do not feel at present prepared to decide upon the
Alternative, which it may be expedient to recommend; but,
thinking it necessary as a preliminary to such a Decision that
the actual State of the Settlements in New South Wales should be
distinctly ascertained and that Information should without Delay
be procured both as to the Means, by which it is practicable to
remedy the existing Evils, and as to the Charge, which such an
undertaking might bring upon the public, I propose (should it
meet with Your Lordship's Concurrence) to recommend to His Royal
Highness The Prince Regent the appointment of Commissioners, who
shall forthwith proceed to the Settlements, with full power to
investigate all the Complaints which have been made both with
respect to the Treatment of the Convicts and the General
Administration of the Government, and to report to His Royal
Highness The Improvements and Alterations of which the present
System appears to them to be susceptible, and the Charge which
their Adoption may bring upon the Public.</p>
