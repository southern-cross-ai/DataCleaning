<h2><a name="ch-00" id="ch-00"></a>A Foreword.</h2>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-001.jpg">If it be fair to take one's
impressions from English books and papers, I am surely justified in
supposing that the average British "tramp" is a despicable loafer
or an abandoned ruffian. The Australian "trav'ler" is on a
different footing. Ragged prowlers do not hide behind Australian
barns and watch for unprotected females to insult or blue-eyed
babes to kidnap. Our girls can usually look after themselves, and
our infants are saleable only at starvation prices. And yet the
country is full of moneyless men who "pad the hoof" from place to
place, and drift backward and forward, always begging, occasionally
stealing, seldom finding rest, and in some cases quite undesirous
of a more settled fortune or a less precarious mode of existence.
These men belong to the vast army of The Unemployed. When a poor
tradesman or labourer is out of work, he must move on or starve on
the spot. He therefore rolls up his "bluey" and starts off, billy
in hand, "on the wallaby track" in search of a job. But countless
others are engaged in the same quest, and jobs are scarce. Some
wanderers are eventually enthralled by the irresistible charm of
nomadic idleness, and are unable to return to a definite and
cabined way of life.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-002.jpg">In the beginning of the
shearing season, the main current sets westward, and the wayfarers
wander from shed to shed on the inland stations. When shearing-time
is over, the tide sets back towards the cities. Travelling in the
"out back" country is full of hardship&mdash;"and there is no health in
it," as a vagabond rouseabout once told me. In the dry season,
hardly a drop of water is to be had: in the wet season, the whole
country is a puddle of mud of various consistency. Travelling in
the coastal districts is distinctly pleasant, if the weather be
moderately fine. Personally, I have never tramped on the western
side of the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>The trav'ler usually gets his food by the system which he
honours with the title of "bummin'"&mdash;in other words, he begs it. He
levies his tax upon every homestead, and everywhere he meets with
helping hands. Of course, many graceless scamps take advantage of
this state of affairs and roam about the country for a living. They
are professional trav'lers. They refuse to work, because for them
labour is an unnecessary trouble. They camp on the outskirts of a
township until they have thoroughly bummed it, and then they set
out for pastures new.</p>
<p>When I am out of employment in the summer time, I become a
trav'ler. My tactics depend upon the condition of my finances.
Sometimes I pay my way; sometimes I am a bummer. Why I love the
rough and ready life of comparative hardship, and what comfort I
find in the manifold discomfort of "the track," are questions which
the reader may answer for himself when he has come to the end of
Knight Wilford's narrative.</p>
<p>It must be obvious to the most casual reader&mdash;even to the
counter-lunch man, who takes his literature in snacks at the
bookstalls&mdash;that much of the story is founded upon the author's own
experiences. Therefore I think well to explain that "The Boy" is
not a portrait of any of my friends, though in depicting him I have
found it convenient to borrow a few accidental details (of costume,
employment and so forth) from one who travelled with me a few years
ago. But essentially "The Boy" is himself alone.</p>

<h2>LANDLOPERS.</h2>
<p><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a><b>Thursday, 12th March.</b></p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-004.jpg">Still at home: still at
work. From the window where I sit, I can see some of the roofs and
spires of the city, above which hangs the dark morning-cloud of
smoke. By road, it is seven miles to Sydney&mdash;seven dreary, dusty
miles. Half a mile to the southward of this house is the village of
Gladesville on the hills above that portion of the Harbour which is
mis-named the Parramatta River. And here I sit, pent in by four
walls and faced by an irregular array of books and manuscripts. The
hideous sameness of things! The misery of clock-work regularity!
This limited existence galls me; and the enforced study of Old
English poetry increases my dissatisfaction. Freedom and action
nerve every line of Anglo-Saxon verse. To start reading the ancient
songs is to plunge into the swirl of foaming sea-waves and to feel
the battle frenzy. If I am to stay here, I must read something
soothing and enervating&mdash;conservative and Tennysonian. But only one
thing can bring me peace now. The old longing is upon me&mdash;the
longing for the open road and its lazy labour. I want to burst
these prison-walls of home and custom; to meet my mates of former
days on the proper footing, and to mingle with them unrestrained
and unrebuked. My fellow-thanes await me. I hear their voices and I
must go. I must lie close to the living earth, encompassed by the
stars. My eyes are dim with longing for the dear blue of hills and
sea and sky. I am eager for a thousand natural pleasures; to dive
down into cool water and gaze up through spaces of dim green or
grey, or mark in clear depths the blending of tints in wave-worn
pebbles and aquatic weeds; to let the branches of trees sweep
across my face and body, causing indescribable thrills of love; to
lie with my back against a hill and watch slow melting clouds, and
see birds gliding down the wind; to sink my face in sweet-scented
grass, and spread my fingers that I may feel the caress of the
elastic blades; to rejoice in the smooth flow of the breeze; to
stand upon the shore and feel the ceaseless pulsing of the Pacific.
I am hungry for communion with these mates of mine. And then the
freedom from restraint, the fetterless uncertainty of vagrant life!
And the darling children by the wayside!&mdash;children who laugh shyly
at the incomprehensible tramp who asks such foolish questions. He
asks them merely for the sake of hearing childish tones and looking
into childish eyes. The confidence of these younglings is not won
until they have done the poor trav'ler a favour&mdash;filled his billy
with water, perhaps. It is one of the earliest-developed traits of
our nature that we love better those whom we freely serve than
those from whom we receive service. These things need not be
curiously enquired into. Enough for us that they are good. And the
tramp can appreciate everything, and can find enjoyment even in
misfortune. He is not stifled by conventional obligations. He
wanders at large in a perfect atmosphere of love. He is on the
common level; no social lies raise him to a pedestal or depress him
in a cess-pit. He feels his fellowship with Nature. An individual,
he is yet merged in the universe. He recognises his union with the
Divine. He is a god. And the people whom he passes on the road see
only a tramp with fringed breeches and a hat full of holes. They
wonder at his half-curbed bursts of laughter, and possibly suppose
he may be mad. But he is so brimming with exultant joy that he
would like to clasp the hand of every man he meets, and kiss the
lips of every girl...</p>
<p>And Marjorie? Is the breach permanent this time; or will she
forgive me for the gusty violence of my love? To what end does the
Life-Spirit set the blood of a man boiling on the flame of passion?
I am a law-abiding subject of a Sovran who crumbles your
manufactured rules as Time brings to naught the parchment they are
written on. I am called a rebel, because I resist all senseless and
unnatural tyranny. And Marjorie? The longest way round, as some
Scriptural writer says, is the shortest way home. I shall start for
your door, my own, by turning my back on it.</p>
<p>The bell! Gods, how I hate this deadly regularity! Curse their
punctual habits! But dinner is dinner.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=

<p><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a><b>Friday, 13th March.</b></p>
<p>The Boy crossed my track to-day. He is eighteen years of age,
but looks several years younger. By trade he is a house-painter. I
asked him whether he would swear mateship and shoulder swags with
me. He will.</p>
<p>So it is all settled, and we are to start as soon as The Boy has
finished his current job. I must borrow some money. Farewell to
conventionality and Anglo-Saxon!</p>

<p>Marjorie is still on the snow-clad heights of displeasure. She
was at church this morning. I sat in the next pew. She was
supernaturally decorous, and concentrated her attention upon the
sermon with a Sabbath solemnity unusual in her. For my part, I
tried to look like a despairing penitent. With an expression of
sorrow and humiliation, I watched the flies dancing a saraband
under the chandelier. But she did not once look in my direction. A
holiday will do me no harm, but I'll make up lost time when I come
home, for she loves me and I know it.</p>
<p>After lunch, I went across to chat with Arthur Seaton. We sat on
the edge of the verandah and smoked.</p>
<p>"Seen Marjorie Traill lately?" I said, blowing rings.</p>
<p>"No," he grinned; "but I expect you have."</p>
<p>"No I haven't," I said. "I'm going away for a while, in a day or
two&mdash;and you know how a fellow's time all gets taken up."</p>
<p>"Where the dickens are you going now?"</p>
<p>"Don't know. But I wish you'd write to me when I'm away."</p>
<p>"But if I don't know&mdash;? "</p>
<p>"Write to Jenolan, and if I don't go there I'll have it
forwarded. Let me know about the things you think I take an
interest in."</p>
<p>"When will you be back?"</p>
<p>"Don't know. But write in about a week."</p>
<p>"Well, by the Lord, Knight," he said with rather disrespectful
admiration, "it's no wonder people say you're mad."</p>
<p>Half an hour later I turned at the gate after saying good-bye,
and called: "Arthur By the way, if you happen to see Marjorie
before you write, you may as well let me know how she's getting
on."</p>
<p>And he nodded and winked. The nod was for me, the wink was for
himself.</p>
<p><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a><b>Monday, 16th March.</b></p>
<p>This morning I met The Boy about ten o'clock. He said he had
finished the job on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Very well," I said, "we start to-day."</p>
<p>We gathered together our traps and equipped ourselves for the
journey, and by eleven o'clock we were on the road. A trav'ler does
not carry more weight than he can help. Bill asked whether he
should bring a watch.</p>
<p>"To what end?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Then leave it at home."</p>
<p>I am dressed in clothes which are remarkable only for their
antiquity. My brown trousers have an important blue patch, and my
shaggy hair protrudes through two holes in my soft felt hat. Into
my pocket, along with a tooth brush and other trifles, is thrust a
"Canterbury Poets" copy of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. A large cotton
kerchief takes the place of collar and necktie. In my swag I carry
two extra flannel shirts and a few pairs of socks, with a piece of
American oil-cloth measuring about six feet by four. In the
"nose-bag" are small "tucker-bags" of tea, sugar, oatmeal, rice,
and lentils, and a tin of mixed pepper and salt. The swag is made
by rolling your pair of blankets into cylindrical shape with your
extra clothes inside. This bundle is strapped at each end, and the
end fastenings are connected by a "shoulder-strap," which in my
case is represented by a rolled towel. The swag is slung from the
right shoulder. The nose-bag containing food is bound to the upper
end of the swag, and hangs in front of the body over the left
shoulder. The whole load when properly adjusted is perfectly
balanced and easy to carry. The Boy's get-up is similar to mine,
the main difference being that his blanket is gaudy with red and
blue, whereas mine is an uniform sober grey.</p>
<p>"Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road," I quoted. And
Bill, knowing not The Answerer, nodded and said: "So do I."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-006.jpg"></p>
<p>We took the main road, and after having lunch in a ferny hollow
near the village of Ermington, trudged in dusty content into
Parramatta. For about an hour we strolled about the old town which
Bill had never before visited, and examined various objects of
interest, including the house where a murder had been committed, a
dead dog, and the oak-tree against which the wife of an Australian
Governor was once thrown from a buggy. A commemorative obelisk
stood near the tree, and just beyond the obelisk was a standpipe.
We filled our billies&mdash;for I was uncertain of the water-supply
beyond&mdash;and proceeded through the Park in the general direction
pursued by the railway line, which we here sighted for the first
time. A mile or two beyond the town we pitched our camp in the
scrub. Bill was anxious to make a gunyah, though there was
absolutely no need for it, and has actually erected a rude and
inadequate shelter of gum-suckers. But his energy will abate when
the novelty of sleeping in the bush has worn off. A gunyah, by the
way, is a lean-to, constructed of boughs or bark, after
architectural designs supplied by the blacks. We lit our fire,
spread the oilcloth on the ground, and arranged our blankets.</p>
<p>As we sat before the fire and smoked our pipes, after a simple
but by no means scanty meal, I remarked to The Boy:&mdash;"Bear this in
mind, Bill: we have left our forks and serviettes behind us, and we
are not to be overshadowed by them. We are free, for a while."</p>
<p>The Boy smoked and grinned, wondering what serviettes might
be.</p>
<p>"We are now in the bush, and partners of the wild things. We
merely add hypocrisy to their list of virtues."</p>
<p>"Ryebuck!" said The Boy.</p>
<p>"Morality and immorality," I continued in my most pompously
sententious manner, "are the twin children of bondage, and we have
left them at home with their mother. We are the masters of all
wealth. Whatever is good is ours. If birds are caught in an
orchard, taking their fill of fruit, they are shot: if we're caught
too obviously enjoying our liberty, we shall be immured. There's no
difference."</p>
<p>"You're a regular savage," interposed The Boy placidly.</p>
<p>"No," I replied, "unhappily most irregular. God bless all pagan
rebels!"</p>
<p>And with that we silently lay back on our blankets and watched
through the branches the star-flecked sky.</p>
<p>I write in the midst of a clear silence, shot through with the
alternate chirping of frogs and the click and chink of myriads of
nocturnal insects. Dear sea of life, I plunge into your warm waves,
electrified with the subtle flow of love. I am happy. I am
free.</p>

<b>NOTHING TO DRINK</b>



Nothing to drink but water going bad
    In hollows where rank grasses rot and stink
Nothing but this foul puddle to be had
          Nothing to drink.

The surface of the stuff is green and pink
    With iridescent changes; yet I'm glad
To lie out here upon my back and think

For here no longer custom drives me mad;
    And in the town, too, I have had to slink
Dry-throated home, and gasp the story sad&mdash;
          "Nothing to drink!"

<p><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a><b>Tuesday, 17th March.</b></p>
<p>Soon after daybreak, I took the billies down to the creek. The
water there was thick and red with mud from the road, eminently
suitable for cocoa, but impossible to disguise with tea. However, I
followed the stream up, and found a shallow weedy pool, which was
not too greatly discoloured. The Boy said it was filthy, but he is
not accustomed to the naturally-collected water of districts more
than half civilised. On previous tramps I have drunk raw mud which
was like thick black cream, and I have made tea which left hard
terraces of manure round the interior of my pannikin. I told The
Boy so, and he did not believe me. Before he returns home he will
learn to style all translucent water clean.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-008.jpg"></p>
<p>After breakfast we followed the railroad, most of the way
through scanty bush, but emerging occasionally upon a road. Near
Seven Hills we bought a loaf from a passing baker, and lunched with
our feet in the gutter. I was drowsily filling my pipe and watching
the intricate dance of a mob of midgets, when a trav'ler swung
along the road. He stopped and asked for a match, which I gave him
after I had lighted my own pipe with it. Then he dropped his swag,
sat on it, puffed awhile, and finally asked:</p>
<p>"From Richmond?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;Parramatta. No regular course."</p>
<p>"Dunno what sorter road this is?"</p>
<p>"No. How is it the way you've come?"</p>
<p>"Goin' to Penrith?"</p>
<p>I blew a ring of smoke and nodded at it.</p>
<p>"Good road," says the tramp, "all the way. You won't run short
o' tucker."</p>
<p>"Have a drop o' tea?"</p>
<p>He swigged from the billy, spat out a couple of tea-leaves, and
looked at me with meditation in his eye. I yawned a chest-full of
smoke at the sky and returned his look, languidly and without
interest. He concluded from my appearance that I was sufficiently
dishonest to be trustworthy; so he took me into his confidence.</p>
<p>"There's good peaches, a bit back." He jerked his thumb over his
shoulder. "I wuz thinkin' at first, there wuz a dog. All right,
though. I eat 'em all quick&mdash;them I'd got&mdash;for fear they'd be found
on me."</p>
<p>"Peaches!" The Boy exclaimed, and gulped.</p>
<p>"How far?" I asked; and the good fellow generously gave me full
directions. I thanked him, and he heaved his swag to his shoulder,
nodded "Good luck!" and went.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that always, when I am on the track, I
am the recipient of abundant kindness and hearty hospitality. Most
Australians are warm-hearted and open-handed, almost to a fault.
Circumstances may obscure their goodness of nature for a time, but
in the end the light of their inborn virtue breaks through the
clouds, and they live in memory, clad with unselfishness and haloed
with loving-kindness. I once camped the night with a shearer, and
so far misjudged him that I fell asleep with the idea that he was
the stingiest blasphemer on the continent. But in the morning he
showed me how to catch stray ducks with a noose of string suspended
from a stick.</p>
<p>Dessert is an infrequent luxury to the trav'ler, and we partook
of the heaven-sent gift with thankful hearts. We got further
supplies of fruit later on, for the orchards abut on the line, and
we could not have avoided them without making detours of
inconvenient compass.</p>
<p>Our camp to-night is in a coppice of oak saplings, on the flat
above a fair-sized creek. I do not know certainly, but I believe
the last station we passed was Doonside&mdash;a platform with a paddock
full of mushrooms beside it. The frogs are chirping and tap-tapping
to each other across the creek, and our fire of driftwood is
blazing and crackling. The water here is moderately clean, but
rather unpleasant in flavour. The Boy insists that there must be a
piggery on the bank higher up; but the taste is merely that of
rotting foliage. There is a waterhole within a stone's-throw of our
bed. In the morning I shall swim.</p>
<p>What a delicious thing the warmth of a fire is! How it soothes
the body, and sweeps in soft waves across the skin with every
breath of wind! But I protest against stuffy rooms and
onion-casings of clothing. Why should our skin be so sensitive to
no purpose? Every square inch of body-surface gives foothold to a
pleasure. The only way to enjoy a fire thoroughly is to pose before
it as a nudity. Perfect pleasure is inconsistent with cerements.
Wind, water, sunshine&mdash;is it possible for mummy-swathed wretches to
realise the ideas represented by these words? If we would
understand Nature&mdash;sweet naked living Nature; if we would meet her
and know her, seeking her not as a blind-worm scientist, but as a
lover; if we would be uplifted with the joy of her kisses; then we
must strip off these artificial hindrances and become as nude as
she. And what is the value of these wrappings, after all? Are they
worn as a protection from the cold? But I have noticed that those
who lap themselves in the thickest clothing are the first to
complain of chilled bones. It is largely a matter of habit. Do
clothes add beauty to the human form? Answer, the Art of Greece!
But, says a sickly apologist, many of us have bodies which are not
joys for ever. And will it improve them, I ask, to smother them in
dank and poisonous darkness? Will you attempt to give them beauty
by denying them light and air? Ah, but the doctors say&mdash;. They have
said it was good to swallow doves' dung and powdered unicorn's
horn. They say it is beneficial to inject certain excretions of
disease. They are always certain. For truth's sake, never heed the
doctors. Listen to the voice of Nature, the voice of the Soul, the
voice of God. Listen to my voice.</p>

<p>The morning was very cold, and The Boy declined to have a bath.
He said he was afraid of snags. There was a great tree-trunk lying
across the hole, and from it I took a dive. When I came out I was
cold; so I went out into the open paddock and danced with my shadow
on the grass. While I was leaping about, a train rushed past.
Somebody waved a handkerchief to me from a carriage window and I
responded with my towel. A wagtail swooped about me and chattered
of friendship. That was a good time. But The Boy called me from the
other side of the creek and cut it short.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-010.jpg"></p>
<p>"Wilford!"</p>
<p>"Bill Smith."</p>
<p>"Put on your togs, and start."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because the people on that train 'll know you're a lunatic, and
the police'll be after you from the next station they stop at."</p>
<p>"Oh, air divine and breezes swift of wing! I never thought of
that. I'll be ready in a sparkle!"</p>
<p>I went back to the camp, and thrust myself into my scanty
raiment in a few minutes. "Ready" I said, and lit up. "Shall we go
across the paddocks, or along the line?"</p>
<p>"Along the line. The grass is too wet."</p>
<p>"All right. Quick march!"</p>
<p>"How far is it to Penrith?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, and I don't mean to. I'm content. Why should I
worry myself with mathematics?"</p>
<p>"When are we going to have breakfast?"</p>
<p>"I'd forgotten. Next water."</p>
<p>So we halted and boiled oatmeal, and threw water over each other
with the billies, and smoked. A meal is always a long ceremony with
us. But the police failed to overtake the lunatic.</p>
<p>By the time we reached Penrith, dusk was close upon us, and The
Boy was tired. We trudged down the street, in which the electric
light had just been turned on, until we met a labourer with a child
clinging to each hand. I nodded to him, and he sang out cheerily:
"Good ev'n, mate!" We enquired the locality of the usual "camp,"
and were told it was a dirty old ruin about a quarter of a mile
down the road.</p>
<p>"You'd better hurry up, or you won't find room," said the
blue-eyed father, "'cause there's about thirty fellers there
already, waiting for the Show to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Thanks, mate. Much obliged."</p>
<p>"No trouble. Good night."</p>
<p>We sat on a vacant block of land to consider our course. We got
on rather slowly, for I am not used to practical thinking; so I
gave Bill threepence and told him to buy a water-melon at the shop
opposite. While we ate, a sturdy young tramp came to us from the
west. He accepted a laconic invitation by flinging himself upon the
grass and hacking a large slice from the melon. He was looking for
a camp, and we mentioned the ruin. Incidentally, I remarked that we
were going to camp on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>He said: "You'd best look sharp, or it'll be dark first."</p>
<p>I acknowledged the fact. He was kind enough to be interested in
our movements, and I followed his lead. It is easy to take the cue
from a man like this, and he feels all the better for his
exhibition of insight and kindness.</p>
<p>"Goin' out west?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Lookin' for work in the sheds?"</p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"D'you know how to shear, then?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Goin' rousin'?"</p>
<p>A nod.</p>
<p>"Bin out before?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"My oath! It's yer maiden trip, eh? Well, I'll tell yer where
y'oughter go first."</p>
<p>"Wish you would."</p>
<p>"Well, you go ter &mdash;&mdash;," and he mentioned a gibberish name which
I have had no occasion to remember.</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> name?"</p>
<p>"He repeated it, and told me exactly where the station was, and
how much I was likely to make. The information was valueless to me,
but I was grateful. I set down the incident merely as another
example of the readiness of people to help us on our way. In
return, I could only tell him that the road before him was a good
one; especially on the stage between Parramatta and Sydney. The
country within a radius of twenty miles from Sydney is the bummer's
happy hunting-ground. More than once, old Murrumbidgee whalers have
told me that the Sydney folk are the kindest and most liberal in
Australia.</p>
<p>We crossed the Nepean River, after lingering a few minutes to
gloat over the long stretch of calm water, beautiful in the evening
light with grey and green and rose and yellow and silver. Before
us, like a rampart thrown up by giant revolutionists, stood the
Blue Mountains, and above them moved a mass of deep purple
clouds.</p>
<p>We sleep to-night on the foothills. I had to descend far into a
rocky gully for water&mdash;sweet, sparkling water&mdash;and fell about
grotesquely in the dark, to the annoyance of a squealing bandicoot.
Meanwhile The Boy lit a fire. When I reappeared, scratched but
triumphant, he proposed a gunyah.</p>
<p>"Looks like rain, you know."</p>
<p>"No matter. I hate building gunyahs."</p>
<p>"It means labour, eh?"</p>
<p>"It involves tearing down a lot of young trees."</p>
<p>"That's what I mean."</p>
<p>"Be blowed!"</p>

Rest, for the purple haze the bush bedims,

His brow by gentle breezes is caressed,
    In weary sight the quiet landskip swims,
And silence of all blessings is the best.

With shadow now the gully overbrims;

<p><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a><b>Thursday, 19th March.</b></p>
<p>At daybreak rain began to drizzle, but we heaped logs on the
fire. As I threw a slab with shaped ends across the blaze, I
instinctively looked towards the nearest fence. Then I turned my
eyes on Bill, but he whistled to himself softly and busied himself
with the tucker-bags. It was a matter of no consequence, for we
were not on the road usually taken by trav'lers. We were on the
first coach-track, an over-grown disused route. It was not likely
that other tramps would suffer for what we did in that wilderness.
I asked no questions.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-012.jpg">We made a damper and some
porridge. When it was too late, we discovered we were camped within
two or three hundred yards of a patch of pie-melons. It was a pity
but we neither of us cared to take a melon as an outside passenger,
and our vulgar verdict was: Full inside." So we made a start.
Before we regained the main road at Wascoe, we were drenched,
through having to push our way through rain-laden oaks; and every
now and then the grey sky darkened and a sharp shower drifted
across. But we took no heed of discomforts. Why should we?</p>
<p>We met many trav'lers. Most of them were hurrying towards the
Plains, for they wished to try their luck at the Penrith
Agricultural Show. They all told us, in one phrase or another, that
it was rainy weather, and a good many asked whether it was wet
enough for us. The question is humorous in a mysterious way&mdash;must
be, for each man smiled as he put it.</p>
<p>As we moved on, the showers became more frequent, until rain was
the ground material of the weather and dry spells the patches. The
roads consisted partly of sticky mud and partly of slush. When we
felt hungry, we turned aside for dinner into a gully near
Springwood, hoping to find a cave. But there was no cave. We
started a fire with some bark and leaves which we found under a
log, and then we cooked our dinner. I took off my clothes and
spread them near the blaze, where they steamed like a mixen.
Meanwhile, every drop of rain touched my bare skin with a tiny
ice-cold finger. There is something strangely pleasant in that
touch; but my clothes were as wet as ever when I donned them&mdash;heavy
and clammy&mdash;and I was inclined to favour an early camp. The
afternoon was well-worn already.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-013.jpg">While we were passing a
cottage a little further on&mdash;a doctor's house, as I saw by the
brass plate&mdash;we noticed two children, a girl and a boy, on the
verandah. Suddenly the little lass hailed me: "Hallo, man!"</p>
<p>"Hallo, sweetheart!" I cried back; and meant it. God bless her
soul of sunshine!</p>
<p>"How are you getting on? "I asked, assuming old friendship.</p>
<p>"Quite well, thank you," she replied gravely; "how are you?"</p>
<p>"Wet," I said. "Good-bye!"</p>
<p>"Good-bye, man!"</p>
<p>And we saw each other no more.</p>
<p>Is such an incident a trifle? Well, it may be, but the best of
life is made of such trifles. I rejoice, and thank the Spirit of
Love for them. I have been feeding for hours on the memory of that
child's face and voice, and words cannot tell one who does not
sympathise how glad I am that the little light-bringer is getting
on "quite well."</p>
<p>When one is radiant with love, the children are immediately
sensitive of the glow. They are naked to its influence. It is worth
the while of philosophers to consider the causes of later slowness
of appreciation. The lion will lie down with the lamb when all men
understand the eternal Fact which gives their deepest meaning to
these lines:&mdash;</p>
<pre class="poem">

"Man, a dunce uncouth,
Errs in age and youth:
Babies know the truth."

</pre>
<p>We searched gully after gully for a cave, but without success. I
found a poor kind of shelter, on private property and well within
sight of the proprietor's house. This possible camp was an
overhanging rock, close to the ground, and partially sheltered by a
rudely-built wall of loose stones. It was a wet and cramp-provoking
hole at best. While I was examining it, somebody at the house
caught sight of me and shouted warning. So we wandered off through
the rain, and The Boy said thoughtfully:</p>
<p>"D'you know, Knight, I don't think I enjoy this tramping quite
as much as you do."</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-014.jpg">Most trav'lers, by the way,
avail themselves of the "boxes" on the railway platforms. I
consider them more cheerless than rain, and you cannot light a fire
in them. Even the intellectual refreshment afforded by quaint
pencil inscriptions on the walls does not atone for the dreariness
of those wretched boxes.</p>
<p>I slumped along with a light heart, knowing well that&mdash;though
night was coming rapidly upon us&mdash;shelter awaited me somewhere.
Truly, "the goddess Wyrd oft withholds misfortune from the man
undoomed when his courage sustains him "; and I foresaw a fire and
bubbling water. We met a horseman, and asked him whether he knew
where we could find a roof to creep under. He looked at us sharply,
and said: "I think not; I've had enough of you fellows about my
place."</p>
<p>At that I grinned, and said: "All right, boss. You <i>do</i> run
into some hard cases and spielers who burn fences and slope with
your garden-stuff, and you ain't to blame if you can't see we're
not that sort. But don't you know of any cave or old shed about? We
ain't particular about sleeping in <i>your</i> pig-sty."</p>
<p>Then <i>he</i> grinned too, but did not soften much. "I'm afraid
I can't help you," he said; "but there's a camp of workmen in a
cottage about half a mile on. They might find a place for you."</p>
<p>We found the house, and, when I looked in at the warm room, I
was glad to notice that it could easily accommodate many more
lodgers without inconveniencing the occupants who were lounging
about the fire. A hulking black-browed navvy caught sight of me. I
nodded, and asked: "Any chance of a camp here, mate?"</p>
<p>He replied: "No, I don't think there is&mdash;mate."</p>
<p>"Mate" was an after-thought."</p>
<p>"Any camping-place further on?"</p>
<p>"Dunno."</p>
<p>Another man, who was kicking the blazing logs on the hearth;
desisted from his occupation and spoke over his shoulder: "Go to
the station&mdash;Linden's the name&mdash;a piece down the road, an' then
foller the line till yer come to a red gate. Go through the gate to
the right an' down the track straight ahead of yer. There's a big
cave there, they call King's Cave."</p>
<p>"Thanks, mate. So long!" And again the rain received us.</p>
<p>We stumbled along in the dark, found the red gate, followed the
track, and there, just over the edge of the hill, was a sandstone
cave that might have accommodated fifty men. We were housed at
last. The rain got up a demonstration for us on the spot, and came
roaring down in a solid mass. A cascade leaped from the hill across
the open archway of our home, and the bush was lost in the jaws of
the growling storm. We found dry wood, and soon the deeper end of
the cavern was faintly illuminated, and we lay on our blankets and
swallowed hot pea-soup.</p>

<p><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a><b>Friday, 20th March.</b></p>
<p>We have not marched many parasangs to-day. In fact, we are only
four miles from King's Cave.</p>
<p>It rained all the morning, so we stayed where we were, and
watched the occasional shafts of sunshine sweeping over the
mountains. There was a little well of clear water in the cave, and,
with one drawback, it was a model abode. The floor, dusty and
barren as it looked, was the realm of a mighty race of
fleas&mdash;fierce, tiger-striped little creatures, which would leap in
battalions upon your hand and arm as you stooped to gather chips. I
was barefoot, and my trousers were rolled to the knee, and upon one
of my legs I counted an impi of twenty-eight, which had rushed to
the assault as one flea. But they did not annoy us much. A flea is
only a nuisance when he persists in exploration.</p>
<p>We bade farewell to the hungry hosts in the afternoon, and
walked in pale sunshine to Hazelbrook. Here we bought a loaf of
bread, and were directed to another cave. This other cave is much
smaller than King's Cave, and is less comfortable, because of huge
rocks which lie about the floor. Two whalers were here before us;
one, an old cooper, who was sitting on a square block of stone and
reading an ancient newspaper with the help of spectacles; the
other, a grey-bearded nondescript with bulging eyes. Water dripped
briskly from the lip of the cave into a kerosene tin, and lying on
one of the discomforting masses of rock were a rusty iron dish and
a piece of soap.</p>
<p>The man with bulging eyes told us compassionately that these
were "hard times," and asked countless questions concerning our
past career and our plans for the future. The old cooper, on the
other hand, modestly gave us information about the road before us,
and then fell to reading his newspaper again. We were still going
west to find work as rouseabouts. We bestowed the lie gratuitously
on many a chance-met wayfarer. It is useless to ask why, and it is
unnecessary. A simple explanation like that is far more likely than
the truth, Heaven knows.</p>
<p>While we were erecting little defences against the incursions of
the man with bulging eyes, a young man with a brown beard and a
spotless suit of clothes appeared on the scene. He had been bumming
the township of Hazelbrook.</p>
<p>"Visitors?" he shouted as he came round the corner.</p>
<p>"Visitors," I nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, I hope they have the spondoolicks," he said, by way of
jocular enquiry.</p>
<p>"They'll pay for their lodging next time they're round," I
ventured, entering into his mood.</p>
<p>"Always the way," he said, "always the way I'm too soft-hearted
for a landlord." And he put down his parcels and laughed at his own
humour.</p>
<p>We sat round the fire after tea and diligently smoked. I was
reading <i>The Song of the Redwood Tree</i>, when the old cooper
interrupted me:</p>
<p>"What's the book, young man?"</p>
<p>"Poetry. Walt Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i>."</p>
<p>He nodded, blew a long stream of smoke at the fire, and plunged
head-foremost into a string of reminiscences: "I remember a clurk I
met at Junee. He was a clever chap with a pen; you wouldn't
believe. He told me he was goin' down to Melbourne. He had a son
down there, that was a tutor in one o' the colleges&mdash;taught, you
know, at the University."</p>
<p>"Why didn't his son send him his fare?" asked the brown-bearded
man.</p>
<p>"P'raps 'e did," interposed the man with bulging eyes, "'n' th'
ole man drunk it." <img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-015.jpg"></p>
<p>"Not him!" said the cooper. "I don't know how it was. Maybe the
son was too well orf to notice his father at all. Anyway, we were
camped in the bush, an' it come on to rain. He hadn't any tent an'
no more had I, an' there wasn't no cave handy, like this. So I
says: 'I'm orf!' an' told him to come, too. But not a bit of it! He
had some books in his swag, an' he was dead frightened he'd get 'em
wet. ' Well,' I says, 'please yourself. There's plenty more books
in the world; but ef <i>your</i> binding gets rotted, you'll have
to wait till the last day before you can get a new one.' But he
only said he musn't wet them books. An he shoved his swag into a
holler log, an' sat on top, shiverin'. So I left him an' went to
the pub in the town&mdash;I don't know if you know Junee?&mdash;The Warrigal
Inn. It was kept by old Tom Hourigan in those days. Many's the time
he's done me a good turn since; but I didn't know him then. I went
to the door, an' asked him ef he could give me some kind o' shelter
from the rain, an' he took me into the kitchen an' told me to dry
meself. Then he says: 'Have you got any money?' 'No,' I says.
'Well, you'd better have a bit of somethin' to eat,' Tom says, an'
he got the girl to set out a plate an' a good dinner. After a bit,
he looked at me suddenly an' says: 'Ain't you got a mate?' 'Why,
yes,' I says, 'I have; but he's sittin' on a log in the bush,
because he don't want to wet the books in his swag.' So Tom says he
must be a fool, an' any man who didn't have the sense to come an'
ask for shelter didn' deserve to get it."</p>
<p>"Quite right!" said the brown-bearded man.</p>
<p>"But pretty soon he turned up, an' I never seen anybody look
more miser'ble. He was wet through, an' so was his swag&mdash;books an'
all. An' his forehead was wrinkled an' the corners of his mouth
twitched back, an' the tears were runnin' down his cheeks. But he
got a bit better when he had some tucker inside of him, an' Tom
made him take off his clothes to get dry, an' lent him a suit of
his own."</p>
<p>Here the old cooper sucked vigorously at his pipe, and
discovered that it had gone out. He, therefore, took a burning
stick from the fire to light it again. He satisfied himself that it
was well and truly lit, pressed down the glowing tobacco with his
little finger, and, without looking at us, unexpectedly continued
his story:&mdash;"He had a way of burstin' out cryin' every now an'
then. An' the longer he didn't have it, the longer he had it when
it come. I remember, when we got down to the border, the man in the
punt wouldn't take us across the river. It used to be tuppence to
get across then, an' he wouldn't start till we showed him the
money; an' of course we hadn' got it. Well,' says this fellow I'm
tellin' you about&mdash;this clurk&mdash;'what ever are we goin' to do now,
George?' An' I says: 'Why, there's only one thing to be done. Ef we
can't get across in the punt, I suppose we can both swim.' I meant
it for a joke, you know, but I'd forgot he hadn' been cryin' for
two days. He sat by the side o' the road an' sobbed like a baby,
an' the tears came drippin' out between his fingers. It made me a
bit angry, so I says: 'What's the matter now?' An' he says: 'I
can't do it, George. It ain't no use. I can't swim.' 'All right,' I
says, 'I suppose you don't want me to wait here while you learn.'
Then he nearly choked himself cryin', an' he got down on his knees,
all of a heap, an' he caught hold o' the leg o' my trousers, an'
says: 'For Gawd's sake, don't leave me, George!'&mdash;like that. An'
his hands were shakin' like the water in the top o' that tin. 'Why
not?' I says; 'I'm gettin' an old man, an' I can't afford to be
wastin' time, waitin' on the edge o' this river.' But he gripped
tight hold o' me, an' sings out: 'I can't get on without you,
George. Ef you leave me, I'll die before I get to Melbourne.' An' I
says to him: 'How did you get on before you met me?' 'I don't
know,' he says; Gawd help me, I don't know!' 'Well you must be a
baby,' I says; 'you might uv known I was jokin'. Do you think any
man in the world could get across just here by swimmin' with a swag
an a billy.'"</p>
<p>He paused for so long that we thought we had come to the end of
the yarn. But when the brown-bearded man asked: "And how <i>did</i>
you get across?" he made a fresh start.</p>
<p>"A chap come along on a horse, an' I says: 'Good day, sir' 'Good
day to you,' he says. Can I have a word with you?' 'Oh, yes. What
is it?' An' I told him. 'Here's two fellers stopped on their way to
Melbourne for the want o' four-pence,' I says, an' one of 'em come
all the way from Sydney to see his son at the University.' That was
all right. He paid sixpence, an' we all went across together. We
got on without any trouble, till we come to Euroa. There was a
brewery there, an' I says to the clurk: 'I'm goin' to try an' get a
job at my trade here, an' you can wait till I tell you how I get
on.' An' he says: 'Well, I hope you don't get any job.' Actually
said that, after all I'd done for him. An', mind you, I had to get
all his tucker. No bummin' for him. He said he wasn't come so low
that he'd beg; so I had to beg for him. An' then he hoped I wouldn'
get a job. I never knew a more ungrateful chap. 'Well, I hope I
do,' I says, 'an' don't you show yourself at the brewery till I
call you, neither; 'cause of you do, we won't be friends&mdash;that's
all.' An' he kept away all right. I went to the brewery an' saw the
boss&mdash;Wild, his name was&mdash;an' told him what I wanted. 'Well,' he
says, 'ef you're a cooper an' not a blanky fool, you're just the
man I want;' an' pretty soon we had the affair fixed up. Then I
says: 'I s'pose you don't happen to have another job of any kind
open? I've got a mate outside that wants to get to Melbourne.'
'No,' he says, 'I don't want any more hands.' 'Then p'raps you'd
give me a week's wages in advance,' I says, ''cause he's a helpless
sort o chap, an' he ain't got no money.' 'I s'pose he can't figger
accounts?' he says. 'Yes, he can. That's just what he can do. He's
a clurk.' 'Well, where is he?' I just stepped out to the gate an'
whistled, an' waved my hand like that, an the clurk came in. Well,
the end of it was that Wild took him down to the cellar an' showed
him the door. It was a big door, covered all over with chalk
marks&mdash;letters an crosses an' curls an' things. You see, Wild
couldn't figger or write, so he made them marks on the door, so's
he could understand 'em. But he couldn' make up the accounts that
way, an' he hadn't anybody to do it for him. We lifted the door orf
its hinges an' took it into the office, an' Wild read it to the
clurk. But it took him three days to straighten out the accounts.
Then, one day, I was workin' in the yard, an out come the clurk, an
he says: 'I'll have to be sayin' good-bye, George. The boss has got
me a job to take a lot o' sheep all the way to Melbourne.' 'He's a
good sort,' I says, for I knew Wild 'ud see the chap was well paid.
An' then I says: 'I s'pose he gave you a present, too.' An' he had.
He'd given him three quid. So the clurk went orf, an' left me
workin' at the job he hoped I wasn't goin' to get. But, before he
went, he gave me two o' the books out of his swag, with a bit of
writing beautifully put in both of 'em, with curly marks all
round." The old cooper indicated lines of writing with his pipe
stem, as he slowly repeated the words of the inscription:
"<i>From</i>&mdash;then he had his name&mdash;to Mr.&mdash;then he had my
name&mdash;<i>as a slight but sincere token of his undyin' gratitude for
countless acts o' kindness on the road between Junee and
Euroa</i>&mdash;an' then he had the date. I never knew of he got down to
his son all right, but I reckon he did. I wasn't sorry when he was
gone. He cried a bit when he left."</p>
<p>"What did you do with the books?" enquired The Boy.</p>
<p>"Oh, I read 'em&mdash;they weren't much good&mdash;an' then I gave 'em to
Mrs. Wild."</p>
<p>The old cooper went on to describe his experiences while he was
employed by Mr. Wild. The brown-bearded man retaliated with a tale
of his adventures in Dubbo, where he had been grievously swindled
by his employer. Then the two swapped lies, until the rest of us
were tired out and got between our blankets. As I set down these
last words, the old cooper, having vanquished his rival, is
spreading his blanket and singing <i>Star of the Evening</i>. All
the others are lying on their backs about the cave; and the man
with bulging eyes is snoring tremendously. The brown-bearded man
folded his clothes carefully, and hung his neatly-indented hat upon
his boots. He has no blanket, but has covered himself with a couple
of old sacks, and looks like the unidentified corpse of a suicide.
The night is cloudy, but no rain is falling.</p>

<b>THE BOND OF THOUGHT</b>

I wonder do you think of me

<p><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a><b>Saturday, 21st March.</b></p>
<p>At breakfast the brown-bearded man said:</p>
<p>"You fellows came through Woodford, I suppose."</p>
<p>"We did."</p>
<p>"Did you see the big Government Camp there?"</p>
<p>"'M," I grunted, with my mouth full.</p>
<p>"Any chance of tucker there?"</p>
<p>"Didn't try."</p>
<p>"Oh, they'd give you somethin'," said the old cooper; "they're
only poor men."</p>
<p>The sun was shining, and the road was drying rapidly, so we
up-saddled early. Near Lawson, we met a family adrift. First of all
came a covered waggonette, driven by a stalwart,
independent-looking man, beside whom his wife was sitting and
suckling an infant. In the back of the vehicle a couple of children
were nestling among the blankets. The rear was brought up by a
healthy jolly lad on a bare-backed pony. Fair luck go with the
party, and happiness sit by their camp-fire! The sight of them was
good.</p>
<p>At Wentworth, The Boy proposed that we should have a drink at
the Hotel, and in we went. Beer is one of the biggest items on our
invisible account-sheet, I am afraid. As we sat with our pints
beside us, I remarked: "I've been in this pub before."</p>
<p>"When?" asked Bill.</p>
<p>"One summer, a year or two ago. I was with old Colonel Turbot on
a sort of exploring expedition, and we struck the line just here.
He's a queer-looking fellow, old Turbot&mdash;tall and bony and dark,
with little bright eyes, and a tuft of hair coming down to a point
on his forehead. Reminds you of a cockatoo. He was a bit tired, so,
after he'd swamped his beer, he lay down on a horsehair sofa in the
parlour. It was pretty late in the day, and the blinds were down.
By-and-bye, a portly old woman came into the room and peered about
in the dusk. I suppose she could just make out a figure on the
sofa, for she looked that way and said: 'Are you there?' and Turbot
said he was. Then she grabbed a chair and brought it over to the
sofa, and set it down close to Turbot, and sat on it. The Colonel
watched her a bit nervously, because he saw how easy it would be
for the lady to make out a case against him. He lay still, and
determined not to shift, whatever happened. She leaned forward with
her hands on her knees, and said: 'Do you know, I can't make out
what's the matter with Sarah!' Turbot, knowing that, whatever
Sarah's condition was, he could not be suspected, brightened up at
that, and said, with the usual polite affectation of interest: 'No?
Really?' 'No,' the old woman said; 'she can't stand.' Turbot
thought Sarah was probably drunk, but he only said: 'Well, hadn't
you better speak to the proprietor about it?' And, of course, that
burst up the show."</p>
<p>"How do you mean?" The Boy asked.</p>
<p>"Why, because she thought <i>he</i> was the proprietor. Drink
your beer."</p>
<p>We decided to turn aside from the main road for an hour or two,
and to have dinner at the Falls. We went to a store and purchased
material for the meal; and the man at the counter thought we were
mad, and evidently felt uneasy until we had paid him. We bought a
loaf of bread, a pound of onions, a pot of jam, and half a pound of
butter. It was a gorgeous meal, and Wentworth Falls never looked
better. We sat on the cliffs, and let our gaze rest upon&mdash;</p>
<pre class="poem">

"An inland sea of mountains, stretching far
In undulating billows, deeply blue,
With here and there a gleaming crest of rock,
Surging in stillness, fading into space,
Seeming more liquid in the distance vague,
Transparent melting, till the last faint ridge
Blends with clear ether in the azure sky
In tender mauve unrealness; the dim line
Of mountain profile seeming but a streak
Of waving cloud on the horizon's verge."

</pre>
<p>And the sublimity of the scene was enhanced by delightful dreams
of anticipation&mdash;fair children, begotten upon the soul by the scent
of frying onions.</p>
<p>We did not visit Katoomba Falls, because we did not wish to be
benighted on the heights. Instead, we turned off at the Explorer's
Tree, and descended Nellie's Glen, a beautiful, rock-walled pass to
the Valley. It is in the lower end of the Glen that we are camped.
We are under the lee of a sloping rock, close to the creek. The Boy
is convinced that we shall be caught by the police and imprisoned
during Her Majesty's pleasure for lighting a fire to cook our tea.
But Her Majesty may rest in peace. We are very careful, and not a
single fern-frond or twig or leaf have we plucked to soften the
hard ground beneath our hip-bones. The law has no terrors for me,
but I know that every form of sin is an insult to Beauty. To offer
Her an undisguised affront is too serious an offence, even for an
irresponsible tramp. I dare not defile the very shrine of the
goddess, at the moment when her blessing is like sunlight on my
spirit. When I feel a pebble grinding between my ribs, I put my
hand beneath me and pull the offending fragment out, and murmur:
"Oh, blast the!&mdash;! I apologise. For Thy sake, most Holy Queen,
sweet mistress of my soul!" and I throw the lump of stone into the
creek.</p>
<p>I wonder what Marjorie is doing to-night. Within two days, if
Arthur keeps his word, I shall have news of her. This life of
freedom is a symbolical dream of our love, a shifting pageant of
the union of souls and bodies. The bubbling mirth of a creek, the
majestic sloth of a sunlit cloud, the ripple of leaves, the
interchange of swift glad song by hidden birds, the aromatic scent
of certain bush growths in the brushwood&mdash;these, and a thousand
other appeals to the senses, overwhelm my whole being with subtle
suggestion. I am alive, and I love; and the world is a mystical
mirror of my inmost self. Why do I thrill with fierce desire at the
mere sight of green-fern-fronds unrolling in the sunshine? The Life
of the World sweeps through me and over me, and I am a-tingle with
passionate sympathy. Even when I lie drowsing by the fire, strong
passion couches beside me with strenuous outstretched limbs. And
because I have not caged my heart, and taught it parrot-cries of
blasphemous commonplace, I am driven out with polite horror and
respectable denunciation. If you were here to-night, my true Love,
I think I could convince you&mdash;if you were here, my Sweet&mdash;if you
were here.</p>

<b>A RIME OF THE SHORELESS SEA</b>

Sea without shore stretching over and under us;
    Knowing too well for exploring and noting
    Infinite distances where we are floating,
Knowing that naught can betray us or sunder us,
          Swing we, my own,
Borne by the current of passion that carries us,
    Sweeps us and pauses, and whirls us and lingers,
Brings us together, attracted, and marries us,
    Swirled in the wake of omnipotent fingers,
          Always together, and always alone.

<p><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a><b>Sunday, 22nd March.</b></p>
<p>As we swung gaily across the undulating country which forms the
bottom of the Valley, we were greeted at every step with cries of
welcome from all kinds of birds. Parrots of various species
screamed and chattered, and magpies carolled in the trees. As we
were passing a piece of swampy ground, three spur-wing plover ran
off, clacking. The kookaburras burst into long peals of laughter. I
laughed, too, wildly and plenteously, to the amazement of The Boy,
who asked, "What's the joke?" And when I shouted, "Life!" and
pointed to a scurrying rabbit, he said he couldn't see anything so
funny about it.</p>
<p>We had a little difficulty in crossing Cox's River, which was
somewhat swollen. There is no bridge, and the gigantic oaks which
have been felled from time to time across the stream have all been
swept away. Bill sniffed at the Cox, and called it a dribbling
creek, but it took him an hour to get from one side of it to the
other, with his swag and his clothes in one big bundle on his head.
There are a couple of selectors' huts near the ford, and a
half-caste woman strolled down to the river bank to watch us. But
she offered us no advice, and I mutely thanked her for her
forbearance. She was the last person we saw to-day. There are not
many houses near that bridle-track.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-016.jpg">As we climbed the deceptive
slopes, after our passage of the Cox, the Boy announced every ten
minutes that he had sighted the top. Each time he discovered his
mistake he began a new search for the summit, and prepared himself
a fresh disappointment. But we did surmount the hill at length and
reached Little River about an hour before sunset. We had a meal,
and discussed the situation. The result was that we started the
arduous ascent of the Black Range at nightfall.</p>
<p>We toiled up the steep mountain path for about three miles, and
then arrived at the saddle where the track turns to the right along
the back of the range. We pushed on more rapidly. It was very dark,
for the night was cloudy, but we found our way by watching just
ahead for the wider glades, and by keeping the foot-worn ground
beneath us. If we strayed a yard from the track we could feel grass
and dead leaves under our feet. We strode along at the rate of
about three miles an hour. We could hear the wallabies scattering
before us and thudding through the scrub into the gullies, and once
we heard the wail of a bear. Here and there a log lay across the
track, and we produced confused crashing and bumping sounds in the
gloom, and murmured words of mystic import. It was a weird journey
through a desolate land. There was not a drop of water to be found,
and we were parched with thirst.</p>
<p>Suddenly the light from a frightened peeping star gleamed in
reflection from the ground before me. I grasped The Boy and flung
him back, lit a match, and knelt upon the soil. Almost an inch of
water had collected in a hole left by a horse's hoof. We drank by
turns, lying flat and sucking up mud. A quarter of a mile further
on we came to a swamp full of clear pools.</p>
<p>By the time we emerged from the bush upon the Mount Victoria
Road, thin veils of mist kept rising from the bottoms and trailing
across the ranges, rendering the darkness clammy and ghostly in the
drip-starred silence. We turned to the left, and went on until we
discovered a grass-hidden creek of running water. There is an old
gravel-quarry near the creek&mdash;a tiny amphitheatre, where the
workers have dug out earth and gravel to bind the loose metal of
the road. Here we have pitched our camp. There is abundance of
firewood, though there is no shelter from the threatening sky. We
are roasting ourselves at a splendid conflagration. Actually, we
found a stack of squared logs in this little stronghold. Everywhere
we meet the kindness of men and the bounty of the gods.</p>
<p><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a><b>Monday, 23rd March.</b></p>
<p>It rained, during the night, until our blankets were wet. Then
the rain gave place to a thick, penetrating fog. We rose before
dawn, erected a precarious clothes-horse of dead saplings, and hung
up our blankets to dry. Perhaps you think it easy to dry a wet
blanket in a fog. There is no difficulty in heating the thing&mdash;or
even scorching it&mdash;but it needs much careful manipulation before it
becomes even decently damp. It was a long while before we felt
justified in rolling our swags and resuming our march.</p>
<p>Instead of following the main road in all its windings round the
mountain-side, we took a track which runs straight along the ridge.
A keen wind, which was rapidly blowing the mist away, brought every
now and then a slight sweeping shower of fine rain across the
ranges. The Boy was full of talk; and every time I had heaped a
card-castle of thought, his breath blew it down.</p>
<p>First it was: "My hands are very cold. I don't know if yours
are."</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-017.jpg">Of course he didn't know,
and there was no good reason why he should. The temperature of my
hands could not be a question of pressing interest for him. And, at
all events, his remark called for no reply.</p>
<p>But he persisted: "I don't know if yours are." He spoke louder,
but I retired deeper into my thoughts and was silent.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, he returned to the attack:</p>
<p>"I suppose your hands are pretty cold."</p>
<p>The supposition was a harmless one. I let him suppose.</p>
<p>He nudged me: "ARE THEY?"</p>
<p>"What?" I said wearily.</p>
<p>"Cold."</p>
<p>"Are what cold?"</p>
<p>"Your hands&mdash;are they cold?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>He fell into silence for five minutes. But he was only composing
a new catechism.</p>
<p>"We're pretty near Jenolan now."</p>
<p>Blank silence on my part. The statement did not call for
contradiction.</p>
<p>"Aren't we?"</p>
<p>"Aren't we what?"</p>
<p>"Near Jenolan."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm hungry. I don't know if you are."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"I don't know if you are."</p>
<p>A long pause.</p>
<p>"ARE YOU HUNGRY?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I'd be glad of a bit of bread."</p>
<p>"We may as well have breakfast, then...Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"No. If we have our usual luck we'll get breakfast this morning
without working for it. Don't ask how; you'll see in time."</p>
<p>At nine o'clock we arrived at the settlement of Jenolan, and
straightway passed through the lofty natural tunnel which is known
as the Grand Arch, and sought the cottage of one of the Cave
Guides. A coach-road is being made through the Grand Arch, so that
visitors from Mount Victoria may drive through the hill, and into
the valley in which the Accommodation House and its accomplices lie
like dregs at the bottom of a basin. The whole place is resonant of
destruction. The click of hammers and crowbars and the thud of
pick-axes are incessant. And at intervals a blast is fired, a
shower of slate-blocks rains into the gully, and the roar of the
explosion crashes from hill to hill, and rushes, rolling and
swaying, through the valleys, till it dies upon the mountain-slopes
like a spent wave.</p>
<p>We climbed up the spur to the Guide's house, and I knocked, but
nobody came to the door. The worst of it was that I could hear the
tinkle of spoons. We went to the back of the house, and a chained
dog frantically danced in a semi-circle, yapping and gurgling his
regrets at not being able to accord us a warmer welcome. The
brute's master heard the noise and came out, with his mouth full of
bread and butter. As soon as his tall handsome frame choked the
door-way, I bailed him with enthusiasm. His breakfast was not
over.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-018.jpg">"Hallo, Voss!" I said.</p>
<p>"Hallo, Knight I When did you get here?"</p>
<p>"Just arrived over the mountain. We came to see if you could put
us up to a hole in the rock where we could camp."</p>
<p>"Haven't you a tent?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"The Coach-house is the best place I know, but they won't let
you camp there. I don't know what you're to do."</p>
<p>"Right! We'll look round for ourselves."</p>
<p>"You know your way about, and you're not likely to do any
damage. But they're a bit strict about the Arches, so you'd better
keep away from them. I'll see you later. I'm having breakfast
now."</p>
<p>He nodded and left us. We stared at each other and grinned
ruefully. There seemed to be no course open to us except that of
cooking our own tucker. But a woman thinks of everything, and Voss
is a married man. Before we had turned away, he reappeared and
said: "Come inside, and have a cup of tea, Knight." And we went
inside and astonished him. When we descended to the Coach-house, we
were warm with the glow of inward satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Devil's Coach-house is a huge cavern or arch, through which
in flood time runs a creek, violently struggling, tossing tawny
arms, and fighting its passage over and between the boulders which
block its course. But at present the bed of the creek is dry. The
roof of the Coach-house is said to be two hundred and seventy-five
feet from the floor. In the walls are innumerable ledges, crevices
and caves, and from the roof hang stalactites of pink and green
calcite. The wonderful blending of colours in this magnificent hall
can only be appreciated after loving study, but the grandeur of its
proportions should strike even the most flippant dumb. And in a
nook of this home for gods, we made our insignificant camp, like a
couple of mice in a cathedral.</p>
<p>Throned on a great block of limestone that must have crashed
from the roof many ages ago, I reclined and read Arthur Seaton's
letter:</p>
<p><i>Dear Knight&mdash;<br>
<br>
Can't make out the lay of the land here. Something seems to be
wrong, but I reckon you know more of that than I do. Last night I
went over to Traills'. Marjorie's cheerful enough, and while I was
there she was so lively she didn't seem able to sit still for five
minutes at a stretch. She'd play a bit, and then slap down the
piano-lid and pick up a book. Then she'd drop the book and run
outside to chuck stones for the dog. And she was ready to laugh at
nothing at all. When I told her I was going to write to you she
said, "Where to?" and before I could answer she said, "Oh, never
mind. I don't want to know!" When I opened my mouth to speak, she
held her hands over her ears and said, "Don't tell me&mdash;promise you
won't?" And when I promised she went outside again. Her mother
asked me just afterwards where you'd gone, and I told her as much
as I knew. And there was Miss Marjorie in the doorway, looking
awfully disdainful and careless. By-the-bye, her mother told me the
girl seems put out about something. "But she's been working about
the house, by fits and starts, as though nothing could make her
tired. I can't make her out at all." That's the report, sir. The
old man kept watching her very suspiciously, and he was pretty
short with me. If anything's wrong&mdash;anything you didn't make proper
allowance for&mdash;I'd advise you to keep out of the way for a bit.
Lassie's pups turned out all right after all&mdash;five of them. I'll
keep the best for you. Be good.<br>
<br>
A. S.</i></p>
<p>So Marjorie is restless and excitable; and she wanted hints from
which she could construct a likely environment for her
dream-portrait of me. The sleepy-looking tatterdemalion who was
sprawling to-day on that lump of rock, is an Emperor in disguise,
and a man whom the happiest mortal in the world might envy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we visited the Lucas Cave. I have neither
ability nor desire to describe the Caves. Others have tried often
enough; and I must refer you to the orthodox guide-books for a
thoroughly inadequate and misleading account of them.</p>

<b>MY DEAR</b>

I called you My Dear in a letter,
    When you were a free-hearted child,
As blithe as the wind and as wild,
    And you flushed with disdain&mdash;knowing better&mdash;
"<i>His</i> Dear! and since when?" and a stroke of the pen
    Stabbed the word by which "Dear" was defiled.

<i>Now</i> strike out the word, I renew it;
    In letters provokingly clear
My claim I reiterate here.
    But no stroke of pen can undo it&mdash;
For the word is a sign that our spirits combine;

<p><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a><b>Tuesday, 24rd March.</b></p>
<p>We have been through the Imperial Caves to-day, and have seen
that they are not bad. Personally I prefer daylight to underground
gloom, but all experience is enjoyable, and a procession of idiotic
people stooping their shoulders and slipping, with candles in their
hands, about a damp chilly passage, is worth seeing. I wonder why
they take such delight in tracing resemblances between the
wonderful formations of carbonate of lime and such objects as
bullocks' tongues, dead fowls, politicians and entrails. And why is
there a funny man in every party&mdash;a man who with daring originality
makes the stupid jokes which the guides have to hear twice a day
for ever and ever?</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-019a.jpg"></p>
<p>Our money is vanishing too quickly. When we started, we had
thirty-five shillings. Now we have only twenty-seven. It must be
remarked that we had well-stocked tucker-bags when we left home,
and we have no idea how long we are likely to be away. I casually
mentioned the state of our funds to The Boy.</p>
<p>"My word!" he said; "we may have to work for our living before
we get home."</p>
<p>"God forbid!" I said quietly. And I saw that he was impressed by
my simple piety.</p>
<p>Later in the day he came to me, beaming, with two shillings on
his palm.</p>
<p>"Been humping visitors' luggage for tips?" I asked
indifferently.</p>
<p>"No; one of the 'workers' gave 'em to me."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Yes. One of the fellows at the forge in the Arch. He said: 'Are
your legs tired, my boy?' and threw me these."</p>
<p>"And you grovelled in the dirt and picked 'em up?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Had some trouble, too. One of 'em slipped under the dust,
and I couldn't find it for a while."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have taken 'em."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because the man is poor, and coins sweat. If you'd got 'em from
a dandy visitor, it wouldn't have mattered."</p>
<p>"Well, it's too late now."</p>
<p>"To give 'em back?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not going to give 'em back."</p>
<p>"All right, Bill. It's your affair. But you can't spend 'em this
trip, unless you go for a spree by yourself."</p>
<p>It was all very well to say that, but every time I walk through
the Arch I sneak past the forge with my eyes on the ground. It is
unreasonable, but I am afraid to meet the eyes of the
blacksmith.</p>
<p>Just below the Devil's Coach-house, a creek of clear cold
lime-water emerges from a rock, and runs rollicking down the gully,
smoothly muscular on the even lengths of its channel, brawling
among rocks where its course is narrow and rugged, leaping from
time to time over bevelled cliffs into lucid pools. Surely one
should be able to read through so transparent a medium the
life-secrets worked by Nature in mosaic upon the pebble pavement.
Four years ago my tent stood in the gully, and daylong I heard the
voices in the waters. Over and over again, I would glance towards
the Arch, expecting to see a troop of visitors coming down the
glen. Over and over again, I saw nothing but rocks and trees and
the hurrying creek. In the middle of the night, I would wake
suddenly, rise on my elbow, and listen. And how those voices lit
the silence! Musical laughter and sweet speech filled my soul with
longing. I knew that where the creek poured out into the hollow
night and caught the star-pictures in its dimpled hands and crushed
them, scattering fragments, the pure naked forms of unearthly
maidens played invisibly. I knew those perfect women spoke to me;
that they had a message for me&mdash;a secret of joy as clear and
complete as a flawless crystal. But in vain I strained my ears to
catch the elusive sense of those frank utterances. I was upon the
very verge of a great discovery. No distinct word reached my ears,
and yet the whole meaning of the sounds was only just beyond my
grasp. And still I hear voices calling, calling, calling in the
creek. But they have undergone a change, unaccountable but
unmistakable. They are no longer the dulcet tones of laughing
women, but the deep determined speech of athletic men. But more
than once I have caught the keyword of their message. And I know
that the time will come when my ears will be opened. For the word
is LOVE.</p>

<p><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a><b>Wednesday, 25th March.</b></p>
<p>We were wakened by voices in the Coach-house, and rapidly clad
ourselves in shirts and pants. Then I kicked together the glowing
coals of our sinking fire, and threw on a few sticks. We felt then
that we were, in a manner, standing to attention, and we awaited
our visitors calmly. An old wood-carrier clambered up the track and
approached us, followed by a delicate-looking boy of about sixteen
years. After we had exchanged courtesies, the carrier explained
that he had brought his son to see the Coach-house, and then went
on to discuss the important question: To whom belongs the honour of
having discovered the Jenolan Caves? He was inclined to give it to
MacEwan. And this, briefly, is the story, of MacEwan:&mdash;</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile up the creek, the bottom of the gully
widens into a grassy flat, which is known as The Little Hole. On
this bit of alluvial lived, long ago, an assigned man who had
escaped and had taken to the bush. His name was MacEwan. He had
built himself a hut, and he used to grow corn and vegetables. But
he was not entirely independent. When he ran short of tea or sugar
or gunpowder, he would ride to the main track, and rob Whalan's
bullock-drays. Whalan, who thought it better to lose a little than
to risk all, submitted. One day, MacEwan's mate&mdash;who shared the
hut&mdash;was foraging for himself, when he came across three or four
horses of good breed and in excellent condition. They were too
valuable to be lost. He turned his own steed loose, mounted one of
his new acquisitions, and drove the rest to The Little Hole. Later
in the day, MacEwan crossed his trail and thought from the
appearance of the hoof-marks that the horses belonged to the
police. When he subsequently saw his mate's horse running in the
bush without a saddle, he guessed that its owner had treacherously
turned Queen's evidence to save his own neck or for the sake of a
reward.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-021.jpg"></p>
<p>So home rode MacEwan and shot his brother bushranger at sight.
Some time after the occurrence of this regrettable mistake, MacEwan
was addressed in insulting terms by one of Whalan's drivers. He let
the man go, but promised to shoot him if he met him again. The
driver resigned. MacEwan was disappointed, but implied that another
driver would do almost as well. Meanwhile, he disabled Whalan by
stealing half his cattle and all his yokes. The iron portions of
the yokes had been imported from Sydney at great cost of time and
money. Whalan's patience was smashed, and he reported the
freebooter's whereabouts to the police. Half a dozen mounted
troopers approached The Little Hole by night. They camped on the
hills. At dawn they charged down the gully, whereupon MacEwan,
thinking that his horses had stampeded, jumped out of his bunk and
rushed into the open air. He was clad in a long white garment of
fine linen, with frills on the sleeves, bosom and hem, and on his
head was a lady's night-cap. Before he realised what had happened,
he was in the hands of the police. Among various stolen articles of
attire found in the hut were six dresses, with dainty underclothing
to match. At his trial he swore vengeance against Whalan. Ten years
later a crop-haired horseman begged for shelter at Whalan's house.
The bushranger was greatly changed, but Whalan recognised him.
Australian hospitality is not a phantom sentiment. MacEwan shared
the settler's supper and lodged during the night in his house. In
the morning he rode off into the bush. The story is incomplete, but
I tell it as I heard it.</p>
<p>A party of tourists came through the Coach-house this afternoon.
There was an old gentleman with an immovable eyeglass and a fixed
smile, and there were two young swells. With them tripped a young
lady of some thirty-nine midsummers. Her manner was vivacious, her
costume gorgeous, her hair golden, and her complexion bloomy. To
save her clothes from being draggled, she had gathered a great part
of her skirt into a bunch behind her; and beneath this hump of
millinery she had passed a strap which she buckled in front just
below the level of her diaphragm. She looked like a giddy old
emu.</p>
<p>I happened to be sitting by the fire reading a copy of "King
Lear," which I had conveyed from the parlour of the Caves House.
The more inane of the young dandies was agape with curiosity. He
picked his way to me and stood simpering. I looked up.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-022.jpg"></p>
<p>"Good afternoon, my man," he squeaked bravely.</p>
<p>And I rose, removed my hat, and humbly said, "Good afternoon,
sir."</p>
<p>"I see you're reading."</p>
<p>"I was, sir."</p>
<p>"May I see your book?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>
<p>"<i>King Lear</i>, by William Shakespeare?" Turning the leaves:
"Isn't this rather too deep you, my good fellow?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know, sir; I understand a here and there and I
guess at the rest."</p>
<p>"Really, I should have thought it above your head, you know. In
fact, I don't know that I should care to read it
<i>myself</i>."</p>
<p>He rejoined his party, and I could hear him babbling to his
fellows: "Most superior man; so polite; knows his place and that
sort of thing; reading Shakespeare, you know&mdash;Shakespeare, by Jove.
"</p>
<p>They took the path to the left and went up the hill; but they
were still in the neighbourhood. Suddenly two or three stones came
clattering through a hole in the roof and crashed into the bed of
the creek. I knew that the floor of the cave was not visible from
where the stone-throwers were standing, and I felt annoyed, though
I was not actually in a position of danger. So I sang out politely:
"Would you mind chucking rocks at somebody else, please?" A
dropping rain of pebbles was the only answer. I shouted, less
politely: "Stop that, you jackasses! If you have only a spoonful of
brain, you might as well exercise it." Straightway an avalanche of
limestone fragments thundered down. Thereat I became almost rude. I
said: "Damn and blast you, you infernal gory blanks! If you can't
act with more flaming sense, I'll blanky well report you to the
crimson Department. I can identify you. There's a sanguinary old
Barbary ape, two carnal poodles, and a skittish cassowary." And
then peace descended upon the Devil's Coach-house.</p>
<p>The Boy was away while this was going on. Before he returned, I
had made up my mind that I would no longer consent to crawl like a
whipped puppy through the Arch. The taking of the blacksmith's
money was not really my affair, but I determined unjustifiably to
take the matter into my own hands and end it. I wrote a letter,
explaining that we were not in want and that we were merely
travelling for pleasure's sake. I tendered gratitude and begged to
return the silver. I addressed the envelope to:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-023.jpg"></p>
<p>When I saw The Boy, I demanded the money. He produced it without
a word, and I slipped it into the envelope. I showed him the
letter, and told him to give it to the smith with my compliments.
He refused, but was willing to come to a compromise. Eventually, he
went, after dark, and put the precious epistle on the
forge-bellows. Thank the stars, that is done with!</p>
<p>Bill has tooth-ache, and makes his pains an excuse for declining
to have a wash in the creek.</p>

<p><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a><b>Thursday, 26th March.</b></p>
<p>This morning we made up our minds to leave Jenolan, in spite of
the cloudiness of the sky.</p>
<p>I heard, with great satisfaction, that the chemist from Tarana
was at the Caves House. This man travels about periodically, and is
said to be a dentist of some skill. I consulted him about Bill's
jaw, and he consented to glance at it. So I found The Boy and sent
him into the house to be examined. He looked as though he almost
wished he had had a wash and said nothing about his ache. In a
minute or two, I heard a strangled yell, and the patient came out,
spitting blood. The tooth had been extracted, and its quondam owner
seems pleased. But the chemist was master of the situation, and
wrung five shillings from our "shammy." Think of it!</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the morning in exploring various caves and
crevices. We clambered about the crags and wormed ourselves into
all kinds of wallaby-haunted holes. We ended by visiting the Glass
Cave. The adventurer who enters that cave really deserves to find
something worth looking at. He crawls along a passage like a wombat
burrow for a distance of some yards, and falls into a pit. Then he
gathers himself together, and takes a full turn to the left, and
squeezes himself up a slippery hard channel, pulling himself
laboriously along by means of little stalagmites and other helpful
obstructions. He bumps his head, and tears his shirt, and swears,
and knocks his kneebones, and barks his shins, and burns his
fingers, until he suddenly finds that he has thrust his head sheer
over the edge of a precipice; in fact, he is looking into the Glass
Cave from a hole in the wall. Below his chin a ladder of wire rope
descends into darkness. But he could not even turn over in the
narrow sloping passage, and he spends some minutes in wondering how
he is to set his feet on the rungs of the ladder. Then he forces
himself out into space, keeping hold of the ropes and constantly
lowering his grip on them until he is hanging head downward and
only his legs are in the hole. Very cautiously he draws out one
leg, and then drags himself up the ladder again till he can
securely withdraw the other. In triumph he descends the swinging
ropes, and finds for his pains much mud and a cell paved with bats'
bones. And it is far more difficult to get out of than it is to
enter the dismal dungeon.</p>
<p>Soon after dinner-time, a great thunder-storm swept up and burst
above our heads. The magnificent echoing roll of the thunder,
filling the hollow dome of the Coach-house, crashing with sonorous
reverberation from wall to wall, roaring lion-like, growling, and
slowly rumbling into silence, was music to fill the heart at once
with awe and exultation. When the storm had passed, we left Jenolan
by the Tarana Road, a steep zig-zag track cut in the side of a bare
grass-sloped mountain. In this district, the mountains of granite
and other igneous formations always look rather mangy when compared
with the tree-clad hills of sandstone. We had almost reached level
ground, when another storm came up. We enveloped our swags with our
oil-cloth, and looked for shelter. There was a huge hollow log
close to the road. We crept into it, and sat there, nursing our
knees and watching the blotting out of the mountain view by falling
rain. The shelter was inadequate. Soon, drops of tan-brown water
began to filter through the interstices of the charred wood above
us. Furthermore, an extremely cold draught blew steadily upon our
backs. We preferred the storm, and continued our journey in
defiance of weather. At a distance of six miles from Jenolan, we
took a bridle-track to the left. Bill thought we were going the
wrong way; but I knew that if I missed one place, I should find
another. The sky is above us everywhere.</p>
<p>When I struck a made road, I again wended to the left, in spite
of expostulations, and was soon rewarded by arriving at a spot
where several bramble-knolls stood by the roadside. Each knoll was
covered with ripe blackberries. After a meal of berries, we
sauntered on until we saw two houses, one on each side of the road.
On the right was a squat cottage flanked by a garden; on the left,
a slab but in a bare paddock.</p>
<p>"Where have you brought us now?" The Boy complained.</p>
<p>"This," and I smiled reassuringly, "I take to be Gingkin."</p>
<p>"Garn! There's only a house and a half here."</p>
<p>"Yes? Well, the house with the garden is the post-office."</p>
<p>So it was, for a wooden plate on the verandah bore the
inscription POST OFFICE in large letters. An old lady was in the
garden. Obviously she was the post-mistress. I touched my hat, and
asked: "Is this Gingkin Post-office?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And do you know where we could find shelter for the night?"</p>
<p>"You might get one if you go on to Hennessy's."</p>
<p>Isn't there any old shed about here?"</p>
<p>"There's the hut opposite, but I don't like to offer it to you.
It's a leaky old place, and it wouldn't be comfortable. Are you
going to the diggings?"</p>
<p>We have left civilisation behind, thank the gods! I voted for
the hut, and we are now occupying half the town of Gingkin. We have
a fire in a broad fire-place, and hooks and chains for the
suspension of our billies. The old lady sent a boy across, a few
minutes ago, with a number of sacks, that we might make a soft bed
on the earthen floor. From the bush, close at hand, floats the
sweet melancholy note of a mopoke.</p>

<p><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a><b>Friday, 27th March.</b></p>
<p>Following the directions of the postmistress, we passed through
"Hennessy's paddock," where we found it necessary to again enquire
the way. There were some children in the paddock, fair-haired happy
bairns, who fled at our approach. But the eldest, a girl of about
eleven years of age, halted when she had placed a fence between
herself and us, and answered questions from her point of vantage.
We departed, to her evident relief, and followed a good track for a
mile or two, passed another house, and came to a little green
plain. We wandered from the track, in search of mushrooms, and
picked up a clear trail further on. We then took the new path, and
religiously traced it along a fence for a considerable distance.
But when we came to the corner of the paddock, the track turned
with the fence.</p>
<p>"Having come this far," I said, "we may as well inspect the
man's fence all round."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" said Bill.</p>
<p>"That this track runs alongside the fence to the spot where we
struck it. When we reach the green flat again, we'll look up the
proper way. How about tucker?"</p>
<p>We had our dinner, and solemnly completed the circuit of the
selection. We saw several wombat-holes and innumerable wallabies,
and eventually we regained the proper track. The diversion was
quite unnecessary, and with a little care we should have avoided
it. But if we are to be careful we might as well be at home.
Besides, we have plenty of time. And then there's Marjorie.</p>
<p>At last we came to a scattered settlement. We looked through the
window of the first building we reached, and discovered evidence of
our whereabouts. At the other end of the single room were rows of
wooden benches. On a table, close to the window through which we
were peering, were three brass candle-sticks and some plaster
statuettes of Jesus and His Mother. "Most of the people in
Shooter's Hill are Catholics," Bill commented. And we went down a
well-made road, passed the post-office, and came to a selection in
front of which grew a thick blackberry hedge.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-025a.jpg"></p>
<p>"Armour's!" cried The Boy.</p>
<p>"William Armour, of Shooter's Hill," I agreed.</p>
<p>We got over the slip-rails, and ate ripe fruit on the other side
of the hedge. Then Bill Smith said suddenly, awed into a whisper:
"They're watching us."</p>
<p>True," I replied, without ceasing to appropriate the
thick-blooded berries; "the gentleman with the mattock left off
work about three minutes ago to wonder who the deuce we are."</p>
<p>"Well, why don't you leave off bagging his blackberries?"</p>
<p>"I like 'em."</p>
<p>"S'pose he's angry? "</p>
<p>"If he's wrong-headed enough to be annoyed, he won't help us,
anyway. So it can't hurt us to eat more of his berries. If he don't
mind our taking the berries, we may as well have our fill before we
interview him. It's too late to leave off on a supposition."</p>
<p>The boss, a sharp-eyed, pleasant-faced man with a fair beard,
waited for our business.</p>
<p>Are you Mr. Armour? "</p>
<p>"That's my name."</p>
<p>"Voss Wiburd said you might be kind enough to direct us on the
road to Werong." This, by the way, was true.</p>
<p>"Come inside. I suppose you won't want to go any further to-day?
"</p>
<p>"Thanks, no. We'll stay here to-night, if you let us."</p>
<p>He led the way into the kitchen of the slab-built house, and
presented us to his wife, a broad-built powerful woman. She set to
work immediately to brew some tea.</p>
<p>This is a typical selection, a little farm wrested from the bush
by intelligence and muscle. Its proprietor is one of those men who
stand unobserved, and sustain our destiny upon their shoulders.
They are the foundation-stones of a great nation.</p>
<p>Armour has a family of several children, ranging in age from
about eight to about eighteen. As usual, the youngest members of
the family won my closest attention, and I made overtures of
friendship to the smallest boy and his sister, who was, perhaps,
two years his senior. At first they were very shy; peeped at me
through the door crack, and hid ostentatiously behind the
furniture. When I tried to bring them nearer by pretending to take
no interest in their movements, they attracted my attention by
whistling on a set of pan-pipes, but still hovered out of reach. At
a sudden movement on my part, they scampered. But I was born in
Sydney, and I never hurry. In the evening, I sat in the ingle-nook
with the bare-footed younglings, and enjoyed myself. The lassie
recited, in the sing-song peculiar to public school children,
Paterson's false gallop of verses, the ballad of "Lost." It
begins:&mdash;</p>
<pre class="poem">

"'E <i>oughter</i> be 'ome, said the OLD man, with<i>out</i> there's somethin' aMISS.
'E <i>on</i>'y wenter the TWO-mile&mdash;'e <i>oughter</i> be back by THIS."

</pre>
<p>Only the chorus of the infant class can deliver it with full
effect.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is the easiest thing in the world to win
the trust of children. The instinct&mdash;the yet unblotted
knowledge&mdash;of childhood is never at fault. Others may mistake your
reserve for self-complacency, your silence for surliness. But the
children know. They have not fully learned to misinterpret the word
of eternal Love. They face the Light with eyes not yet too thickly
veiled. The blindest man on this round world can see the light of
Heaven in the eyes of a little child, can feel the breath of God in
the warm air that surrounds its sweet-fleshed body. No wonder that
modern Art, rebelling against the worship of false gods to which
materialistic folly would force her, enthrones in painting, in
sculpture and in literature the ideal of childhood, and bows down
to it in passionate adoration.</p>
<p>The rugged simplicity of Armour's household appeals strongly to
my sense of fitness. Their method of making butter by stirring a
bucketful of cream with a stick seems to be absolutely and
undeniably right&mdash;for them. That they boil great lumps of salt meat
and hacked-up pumpkin and Swede turnips in one big black pot is
evidence that the complex mischief of civilisation is a thing of
naught in this far-away spot. When the contents of that pot are
placed, steaming upon a dish, in the centre of the table, where
each of those who sit around may reach them with his fork, I
remember funereal banquets at which I have been present, and a
table at which a waiter knocked me down by thrusting a chair
against the back of my knees and thereafter whisked away my dinner
while my attention was diverted. We are not over-burdened with
ceremony here.</p>
<p>Armour gave us a plan of the more difficult parts of the course
before us. Then he said: "Watson, the storekeeper is taking
supplies to Werong to-morrow. You'd better go with him and get a
lift. I'll see that you start in time." He showed us where we are
to sleep, and left us, wishing us a good night's rest. We have a
real bed to-night, with blankets, and coverlet, and a straw
mattress that rustles when one turns upon it.</p>
<p><a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a><b>Saturday, 28th March.</b></p>
<p>The landscape was white with frost when we bade farewell to
Armour and walked briskly down the road in search of the store, and
the air was cold and exhilarating. We found Watson just preparing
for his journey. His wife was helping him to load the dray, and it
struck me that all the women about here are of the same
type&mdash;large, powerful and downright. And most of the children are
bright-faced and hearty, with hair half-bleached by the weather. We
readily obtained leave to throw our swags upon the laden dray, and
at half-past eight we started for Werong. The dray was drawn by
three horses, harnessed in tandem fashion. There were no reins, but
Watson walked beside his team and directed it with voice and
whip.</p>
<p>Mile after mile we strolled along a bush-track which wound among
the grey and yellow trunks of straight gums&mdash;a monotonous and not
very well-marked course. The velocity of the cavalcade was not
excessive; the average rate was, possibly, two miles an hour. Bill
and I soon discovered that we grew weary in attempting to keep pace
with the horses, so we used to walk ahead for about a mile and then
wait until the main body reached us. Some four hours after our
departure from Shooter's Hill, we crossed a creek. Watson shouted
to us, and asked whether we were going to stop for dinner.</p>
<p>"No," I said; "it's not worth while."</p>
<p>"Because that's the only water on the road," he explained.</p>
<p>And we drifted on.</p>
<p>We reached the diggers' settlement of Mount Werong about two
hours before dark. It is not a particularly picturesque spot. On
each side of a depression, which common speech exaggerates into a
gully, are a few huts of stringy-bark, and some skeletons of
deserted dwellings from which the bark has been stripped. In the
depression is a dam, holding back a sheet of dirty water. On every
side are excavations of various size, and heaps of yellow earth. Go
straight from the dam in any direction and you will come either to
a hole like a clumsily-dug pond or to a little oblong pit like a
child's grave.</p>
<p>"Here we are," I said, and pulled my swag off the dray.</p>
<p>"Wed better look for a camp," was The Boy's first idea.</p>
<p>"By-and-bye," I replied. "But I'm hungry now; ain't you? So
long, Mr. Watson! Much obliged."</p>
<p>We made a fire in a hole where somebody had been washing dirt in
a cradle, and we had very soon satisfied the cravings of the body.
Then I lay back on a heap of earth and filled my pipe. The Boy was
restless. He said: "We'd better look for a camp now."</p>
<p>Give me a match, O thou of little faith," I drawled sleepily,
and thereupon lit my pipe and lay a-smoking. Soon I broke silence:
"See those men on the hill trying to make some horses drag a heavy
boiler?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I've been watching 'em."</p>
<p>"Want to help 'em?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, we won't go near 'em till I've finished my pipe." And I
smoked in peace, until I had finished. Then we left our swags, and
approached the workers on the hill. A big cunning-eyed hooky-beaked
man, thick-bearded and arrogant, was acting as overseer. To him I
spoke:</p>
<p>"Good day, boss! Could you tell us where we can camp for the
night?"</p>
<p>He eyed me from head to foot, and rasped a churl's reply: "Yes,
my son"&mdash;he waved his hand comprehensively&mdash;"you've got the whole
bush to yourself." And he turned away.</p>
<p>"The old curmudgeon!" gasped The Boy.</p>
<p>"Shut up," I muttered, "and wait for our luck."</p>
<p>We stood and watched the shouting men and sweating horses. It
was growing dark. Presently a man detached himself from the crowd
and came to us.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't offer you a camp in my house," he said
apologetically.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it."</p>
<p>"I've got a small house and a large family&mdash;a very large
family."</p>
<p>Again: "Don't mention it."</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-026.jpg"></p>
<p>"But if you like to use my stable, you can move the cart out and
I'll put the horse somewhere else."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"That's the place, yonder. You'd better go and get yourselves
some wood now. There's going to be a frost "</p>
<p>So we are using Mr. Dawson's stable. It has only one wall (and a
bit), but its roof is sound, and we have built a roaring fire in
front of it. The proprietor, too, has placed at our disposal a heap
of sacks.</p>
<p>The imperturbable Chinaman gains his point by means of two
phrases: "No savee!" and "Aw li!" For the rest, he is passive. You
may learn something even from a Chinaman.</p>
<p><a name="ch-28" id="ch-28"></a><b>Sunday, 29th March.</b></p>
<p>The night was bitterly cold, but it wore through in reasonable
time, and left us sleeping within an inch or two of our bonfire.
Three times before dawn I left my blankets and flung logs on the
fire, sending fountains of sparks into the freezing moonlight. And
on each occasion the night had stolen every vestige of heat from my
bed before I could take my place again. She was welcome to her
booty, however, for I am no cold-blooded toad, and I never grudge
heart's-warmth to a friend.</p>
<p>"Now," I said, as I cast out the tea-leaves, "we go, probably,
from here to Vinn's on the Abercrombie. And the way to get there is
to 'take no right-hand tracks.' Those are our directions: '<i>Arma
viamque cano</i>.' Roll up and trek."</p>
<p>"How far's Vinn's?" asked The Boy, after trying to make
elaborate calculations without any basis.</p>
<p>"Don't know, and don't want to."</p>
<p>"And you don't know the track?"</p>
<p>"Only as much as Armour told us:&mdash;</p>
<pre class="poem">

But shall I go mourn for that, my dear!
    The pale moon shines by night;
And when I wander here and there,
    I then do most go right."

</pre>
<p>"I reckoned we might get dinner at Vinn's."</p>
<p>"And so we shall, by great Pan's leave. But you are looking too
far ahead. Oughtn't to be hungry just after breakfast. Help me to
run the cart in again, and then we'll start."</p>
<p>Well, we reached Vinn's in the middle of the day and found Vinn
himself standing in front of his house.</p>
<p>"Day!" from us.</p>
<p>A nod from Vinn.</p>
<p>"You Mr. Vinn?"</p>
<p>Another nod.</p>
<p>"We're on the way to Wombeyan, Mr. Vinn. Camped the other night
with Armour of Shooter's Hill, and he reckoned you could put us on
the track."</p>
<p>"Yes?" said the immovable bushman.</p>
<p>"Yes, and&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;here we are."</p>
<p>"I can't go with you, to-day. I've got to go the other way
altogether."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>"But there's a young fellow here may be going part of the way
this afternoon." And Vinn moved deliberately into the house.</p>
<p>"Dinner?" asked The Boy anxiously.</p>
<p>"Don't prompt Wyrd, Bill. She knows her game."</p>
<p>Vinn came out and thought in the sunlight. Then he spoke,
slowly: "No. He won't be going. But you can get along all right. Go
through that gate, and turn off, up the range, at the first rise in
the track after you pass the house&mdash;my old house."</p>
<p>"All right! thanks!"</p>
<p>Obviously our business with Vinn was over. I was about to swing
my load into position, when he spoke once more: "Better come in and
get some dinner before you go." And we went in, and found the
household&mdash;consisting mainly of pretty girls&mdash;assembled round the
table. After a copious meal, we slouched into the sunlight again,
and Vinn verified a pencilled plan which Armour had drawn us, and
gave us a full and unmistakable explanation of it. Whereupon we
took to the track, blessing him.</p>
<p>"I won't prompt Wyrd again, Wilford," said The Boy. "She's all
right."</p>
<p>A young kangaroo dog was trotting after us. It was a beautiful
animal, but we agreed at once that it must be sent home.
Dog-stealing is not one of our practices. At the same time, the dog
was an affectionate beast, and it would clearly have been wrong to
have resorted to violent language and cruelty. I undertook to
dismiss our follower in a rational and kindly manner. When I
stopped and turned round, the dog halted and watched me. It was
quite ready to listen to argument. "Good old doggie," I said
gently, "you must go back." But the animal, after a moment's
thought, came to a different decision, and sat down. "See
<i>here</i>, boy&mdash;<i>here</i>, boy," I expostulated; "if you don't
go back, I shall have to punish you." To indicate the form of his
prospective punishment, I softly beat my thigh with my hand. The
dog came writhing to me, wagging his tail and cringing to the
ground. "Well, Bill," I said with a sigh, "we've done our best to
send the beast home. I reckon no further responsibility attaches to
us." And the dog quietly came after us. One cannot expect to find a
highly-developed intelligence in a mere dog; but I could hardly
have put the case to him more simply and clearly.</p>
<p>We turned leftwards at the rise, crossed the creek, and followed
up the dip in the opposite hill. At first there was no track
whatever, but before long we struck an old dray-track. We mounted
up and up, until we reached a saddle (or "point"), and then we took
to a blazed foot-path which ran to the right along the range. A
brown retriever came out of the bush, and showed, by a greeting
devoid of impertinent curiosity, that he was a friend of the
kangaroo dog. I turned to the latter and explained the situation:
"We have already disclaimed responsibility in your case, and, if
any acquaintance of yours cares to accompany you, we are quite
prepared to do the same on his account." Both dogs listened
attentively. "However," I continued, as a collie trotted down the
track and carelessly licked the retriever's head, "we don't want to
march at the head of a canine army."</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-027.jpg"></p>
<p>When we reached a lonely cottage near a swamp, and made the
usual enquiries, we discovered the owner of our followers. An old
woman looked at us with piercing suspicion, and said: "Whose dogs
are these?" Then she shut her lips and stiffened them against one
another.</p>
<p>I twitched at my beard, and answered: "Don't know."</p>
<p>"Where did you first see 'em?"</p>
<p>"Up on the range."</p>
<p>"H'm!"</p>
<p>"Beg pardon?"</p>
<p>"How is it they're with you?"</p>
<p>"Followed us. We couldn't make the brutes leave us. Do you know
whose they are?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Yours?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>No wonder they came the same way that we did. They were on their
way home all the while. But, to my secret satisfaction, the woman
had to chain up the kangaroo dog, to prevent its following us when
we plunged once more into the bush.</p>
<p>It was getting dark when we clambered, hungry and footsore, down
a sharp descent to a broad metalled road.</p>
<p>"Right or left?" from Bill Smith.</p>
<p>"Both. Try left, first."</p>
<p>So we went to the left, about a quarter of a mile. Then we
turned back, and went the other way. We found an empty hut and a
large creek. We hung about, mooned up and down the track, and grew
hungrier.</p>
<p>"I'm hungry," I told Bill, at last.</p>
<p>"I'm tired," Bill said.</p>
<p>"Also," I added, "it's very dark. We'll light a fire on the flat
by the creek, have our tea, and&mdash;if nothing turns up&mdash;camp under
those big oaks."</p>
<p>We bathed our feet in the icy water, and then built a fire and
boiled rice. About an hour afterwards, an old man rode down to the
ford.</p>
<p>Hallo!" I shouted.</p>
<p>He answered gruffly from beneath the folds of a shawl in which
the lower part of his face was muffled: "Hallo, mate!"</p>
<p>"D'you know where Mr. Chalker hangs out?"</p>
<p>"Which Chalker? "</p>
<p>"Caretaker of Wombeyan Caves."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes!"</p>
<p>He dismounted, hung his horse to the fence, and sat on his heel
by our fire. He was Chalker's brother. We smoked the pipe of peace,
and conversed at length. Before he left, he pointed out a
bridle-track which led to the Caves House.</p>
<p>It must have been nearly ten o'clock when we dragged our steps
across the green flat to the weatherboard one-storied cottage that
serves as an Accommodation House at Wombeyan. We flung down our
swags on the verandah, and looked through the front windows.
Nothing to be seen but the dim squares of sky behind the windows on
the other side of the dining-room! We knocked, and the house
sounded very hollow. We tramped noisily on the verandah. We beat at
the door with the butts of our sheath-knives. We wakened nothing
but echoes&mdash;echoes that sounded like the footfalls of ghostly
adherents of a long-loved domicile. Bill looked pale, so far as I
could judge. He sat on the edge of the verandah, and waited while I
set out to explore the rear of the building. I saw light streaming
from a window. I peered in, and saw that a fire was burning on the
kitchen hearth. Without hesitation, I tried the door, and it was
not locked. Straightway I returned to The Boy and reported.</p>
<p>He said: "Anybody there?"</p>
<p>"No, not a soul."</p>
<p>"Well!"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"We can't go in."</p>
<p>"Oh, can't we There's a good fire, and a chair each side of it,
and a safe that looks as though it might hold something to eat.
Come on."</p>
<p>No fear! Not if there's nobody to ask."</p>
<p>"All right. Your teeth are chattering so hard that you bite off
the ends of your words; but if you like the cold, you're welcome.
Good-night!" And I was walking towards the kitchen, knowing well
that he would soon follow.</p>
<p>Suddenly a window was thrown up close to me. I looked hastily
round, and made out a female head with window curtains gathered
together under the chin&mdash;a sort of "Bluebeard's wife" illusion
without the red paint. The apparition was ghastly, silent and
immovable. It had staring eyes. I spoke to it airily, and it
replied in grave long-drawn monosyllable.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chalker live here?"</p>
<p>Yes."</p>
<p>"He's out?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In the caves, maybe?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Be home later?"</p>
<p>Yes."</p>
<p>"We can go into the kitchen, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Come on, Bill. You needn't violate your conscience. A kind lady
has given us permission to warm ourselves."</p>
<p>While we were sitting by the fire, the door opened, and the
apparition walked in, full length. It was Mrs. Chalker, as we soon
learned, and a very pleasant apparition, too. She asked us: "Have
you had your tea?"</p>
<p>"Yes, thank you," Bill said.</p>
<p>I kicked him furtively, and explained, "But it was very long
ago, and we're mighty hungry again now."</p>
<p>She made us a pot of tea, and placed a loaf of bread before us.
While she was busy, I quietly murmured to Bill: "If we are supposed
to pay well for our board and lodging here, let's be sure of our
money's worth. If we are to be let off lightly, anyway, why should
we stint ourselves? Tuck in." And he tucked.</p>
<p>We smoked before the fire lazily, with complete satisfaction.
When we knocked the ashes from our pipes, Mrs. Chalker offered to
show us a bed. She brought us to a room where there are
<i>three</i> beds of superior quality, and left us to make our
choice. "How good is man's life, the mere living!" Can I blow out
the candle from here?</p>
<p><a name="ch-29" id="ch-29"></a><b>Monday, 30th March.</b></p>
<p>At half-past two this morning, a couple of young men dragged
themselves into our room and took to one of the other beds. I
awoke, and interviewed them. One was the post-boy from Taralga; the
other was the owner of a sheep-run a few miles away, and his name
was Robinson. They and another fellow, whose Christian name was
Walter, had been assisting Mick Chalker to capture a pig. This pig
had been running wild in the bush for upwards of five years, and
they had taken another eight or nine hours to drag him from a gully
to the top of a hill, where they left him securely bound. He was a
very savage pig, they said, and strong, and they were tired. So I
allowed them to sleep.</p>
<p>Soon after daybreak, Mick Chalker walked into the room. He said
he was going to bring home the pig. Robinson lay still, with humped
shoulders, and suspense in every curve of his bedclothes. My feet
were sore, being cut by the much-broken uppers of my boots. But we
certainly could not afford to lose a chance of paying part of our
way without money. So I was cheerful, and chirped out:</p>
<p>"Can we assist you, Mr. Chalker? "</p>
<p>"I'd be glad if you would, and then I won't have to ask this
young man," Chalker acknowledged.</p>
<p>And Robinson relaxed with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>We dressed ourselves quickly. I pulled on my boots. Oh, my poor
feet! But I swaggered out, as though I were quite at my ease, and
before long we were off to the hills. There were four of
us&mdash;Walter, Mick, Bill and I. Mick led a horse which drew a slide
(or sled). A slide consists of a pair of heavy wooden runners,
connected by crosspieces and decked with bark. You can drag a
vehicle of this kind over country which a cart could not possibly
traverse. I mean you can make a horse or a bullock drag it.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-028.jpg"></p>
<p>The pig looked almost resigned when we found him. He neither
romped nor squealed. He merely heaved his bulk with a few sulky
grunts, though his eye was wicked and watchful. We hauled him upon
the slide and strapped him down. Then each of us&mdash;except Mick, who
led the horse&mdash;held the end of straps which were attached to his
legs, and prevented his rising or rolling. The Boy was on the
right, Walter behind, and I on the left. How we swung and bumped
and slipped down the hill! We jolted down the rough granite slopes
in danger of our lives. The slide shot from side to side, thudding
threats of broken legs; or leaped suddenly along on one runner, and
attempted to upset the pig upon us. The straps we held were short;
mine scarcely extended three inches beyond the edge of the slide.
But we hung on as though they were the handles of a battery, and
rushed along over rocks and through soft soil. We had to keep an
eye upon the pig, and yet we must, at the same time, dodge the
slide and avoid obstacles. We had to twist ourselves round or
scramble over trees, logs, stumps and boulders. Then we would come
to a creek. The slide would splash into the ford, and with it we
would go flying knee-deep into cold water. And, all the while, we
watched the old porker's tusks, and wondered how soon we should be
thrown within their reach.</p>
<p>We reached home in good time for breakfast, had tea and damper,
and feasted royally. But the thought of the pig haunted me. I had
played a very mean part in his little tragedy. For five years he
had been enjoying his freedom, grubbing for roots and munching
thistles in the gullies. With magnificent courage, skill and
strength, he had held the dingoes at bay, and had asserted his
right to range the bush without molestation. And I had tramped all
the way from Gladesville to take the part of his oppressors. I had
dragged him, ignobly bound, from the scene of his unhampered
happiness, and had helped to pen him in a dirty little enclosure. I
felt mean. I explained to myself that I had merely saved Robinson a
troublesome job, and that the pig would have been put in the sty
whether I had helped or not. But sophistry availeth not, and I
should not care to meet the eye of my grunting victim.</p>
<p>We spent the greater part of the day with Chalker in the caves.
They are better than those at Jenolan, and the gem of them is the
Kuringa. As we stood in a dark corner of the Arch, and waited while
Mick lit the candles before proceeding to the Old Cave, I saw a
small snake crawl from beneath the hollow of Bill Smith's left
boot. He was watching Mick. I told him to tread on the snake, but
he grew unduly excited, and jumped away. I was about to stamp upon
the reptile, when Mick stopped me. He said he had never seen a
snake in the caves before, and that he would like to get this one
as a specimen. So I held the little creature fast with a stick,
while he ran for a bottle. It was a savage snake, surely, biting
the ground, and striking at my hands when I tried to place it in
the bottle. But we imprisoned it at last, and had a good look at
it. It was really very beautiful; about a foot or fifteen inches
long; in colour, a rich brown with clear black stripes. This is the
first snake we have seen, though everybody warns us that during
this month the bush is a-swarm with them, both by day and night. We
are told that they will creep into our blankets and pay our fare
across the Stygian Creek. Content.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, we turned our backs upon Wombeyan, and
accompanied Robinson to his hut on the sheep-run. The hut is
divided into three rooms&mdash;two small sleeping compartments and a
living-room. And here we sleep this night. How long will it be
before we reach really civilised people, who will refuse to grant
us house-room?</p>

<b>OPEN SPEECH</b>

Good friend of mine, you feel with me&mdash;
Your blood grows hot by sympathy
With something that I say or do;

Let not the silence wrap you round
While you are living over-ground.
They say that earthly years are few;

Perhaps I pass you in the street,
And, when our eyes a moment meet,

Are you, too, longing for a sign,
Yet fear to stretch a hand for mine?

<p><a name="ch-31" id="ch-31"></a><b>Tuesday, 31st March.</b></p>
<p>Last night I found myself in a dream of which it would be easy
to invent a mystical meaning. I was enveloped in a thick mist&mdash;a
dull white dark ness. Under foot the ground was like a heavy paste
of fog or coagulated cloud. I felt that I was on an errand, but I
was lost, and a great dread was upon me. I was tortured by the
silence, and yet I could not cry out. Suddenly the mist became
luminous, and with a rumble of thunder a star fell from heaven and
lit glowing upon the solid cloud at a short distance from me. Then
the light that was diffused throughout the vaporous atmosphere
gradually concentrated upon the star. The mist shuddered and began
to sweep in eddies about the centre of light; the circles in which
it whirled grew smaller and closed in, until a dense white mass
with a heart of fire spun before me. This by degrees thickened and
diminished till it stood like a rosy column. Gradually it took
human shape before my eyes, and with a cry of joy I took three
steps and clasped the radiant form of Marjorie.</p>
<p>All the morning we loafed in Robinson's hut, and clacked of
every conceivable subject. Robinson leads a lonely life here, and
is glad of any company&mdash;even such as ours. If there had only been a
bottle of whisky in the place, what a pleasant evening we might
have spent last night. We had a jolly time as it was, with weak tea
and damper.</p>
<p>I suppose it must have been three o'clock when we shook hands
with our host and took the bridle-track through the hills. This
track disappeared, after we had trusted it for about five miles,
and left us in a paddock overlooking the Wollondilly River. We knew
that a man called Gorman had a selection on the nearer bank of the
river, and that a bridle-track went somewhere down a spur to it. We
spent three-quarters of an hour trying to find the upper end of the
track, but it was time wasted. Far down we could see the stream,
curving away among the mountains, but between us and it were cliffs
and precipitous slopes.</p>
<p>"We must go down the lower gully," I said, "and then we'll be
sure of being below the cocky's place."</p>
<p>"It's pretty rough," Bill murmured, when we stood on the
brink.</p>
<p>"Horrible steep!" I admitted.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-030.jpg"></p>
<p>Nothing but a rock wallaby had ever ventured that descent
before. It would have been risky enough without our swags. As it
was, our blankets hustled us off narrow ledges and forced us to
take prodigious leaps at uncertain grass-tufts. When we landed, the
swags would swing out with a sudden tug and invite us to swoop
headlong into fissures and hollows. Many of the rocks were slimy
and afforded us no foothold; others gave way beneath us and bounded
over crag-edges, thudding and crashing with suggestive emphasis.
Where a little soil had collected at improbable angles, there was
no safety, for an unwary projection of weight started avalanches.
Our descent was not rapid, but it was engrossing. When we reached a
dry creek-bed full of smooth shingle and boulders, we followed it
down until we came to the river. And here, on a flat Dantesque with
ring-barked trees, we made a discovery. We came across the relics
of a house. A couple of corner posts still stood, and a sloping
roof had been newly constructed by leaning sheets of bark against
the solitary cross-beam. Under shelter of this gunyah were a
padlocked box, a straw mattress, and some blankets. Close at hand
was a heap of ashes, and on it grew a spreading vine of vegetable
marrows.</p>
<p>Now, I was quite willing to try a change of diet. Bill had been
enjoying variety, because he eats meat. I touch no flesh of any
kind, and had lived entirely upon damper and tea since our arrival
at Wombeyan. But it was Bill who suggested that we should borrow
the largest marrow.</p>
<p>I reproved him. He is too hasty. I said: "Whoa, there! Honesty
is the best policy, Bill. The man would miss that fellow directly
he got home, because it grows in the open. Take that one on the
right. It's nearly hidden by leaves, and it's not much smaller than
the other."</p>
<p>We divided it deftly, that its shape, bulging on our nose-bags,
might not betray us.</p>
<p>"Let's clear, Knight," The Boy said, "before the boss gets
home."</p>
<p>But we had hardly turned away before we saw a man swimming his
horse across the river towards the flat. He had not seen us, and we
did not stop to ask him if we were heading towards Gorman's. We
followed up the river-bank for about half a mile, and came upon the
selection. Gorman was there, and promised to direct us to Bullio in
the morning.</p>
<p>"Where are you going to camp to-night?" he said, fearing fires
about his homestead.</p>
<p>"Why, we thought you might have a shed."</p>
<p>He reflected, and said, "Yes. You can sleep in there "&mdash;pointing
to a rough log-house&mdash;" but you can't light a fire near it."</p>
<p>That was all right. We had no wish to light a fire within sight
of the house. We cooked the marrow among the boulders on the edge
of the river; and it filled our larger billy three times. Bill gave
out that he had no liking for marrows, so I had to finish the lot
by myself.</p>
<p>We went into the log-house darkling, but I found a bit of
candle, and with its aid we explored. We are camped in a little
bark loft, with a pile of corn-cobs and a number of mice. I
rummaged about the place, and came across a couple of horse-rugs
and a gorgeous railed blanket; and we are very comfortable.</p>

<p><a name="ch-33" id="ch-33"></a><b>Wednesday, 1st April.</b></p>
<p>We bathed in a tributary of the river, dressed on the other
bank, and toiled up the spur. The track from the Wollondilly to
Bullio is faint and confused in parts, but we followed a broad
hoof-mark, and arrived at the settlement at dinner-time. From
Bullio there is a good buggy road, which is now being shortened and
repaired. We passed the road-camp about eight miles back. For the
most part the road is unbeautiful, sometimes running for miles by
grey ring-barked gums&mdash;"the skeleton wraith of a wood."</p>
<p>We are lodged in the playhouse of a public school, and I really
think the Government ought to have a better shed erected. It is a
miserable bark cubby-house; a disgrace to Rumanwatta&mdash;or whatever
the name of the place is.</p>
<p>A trav'ler with a collie dog was here when we came up, and we
have been sitting over the fire and inventing experiences for each
other. The dog only listens and sniffs.</p>
<p>The man indicated his companion. "He don't help me much. People
say, 'He looks well fed,' and snap at me for wanting anything to
eat. They grudge a fellow a bit of tucker if he don't starve his
dog. If the brute's skinny, they look suspicious, and I have to try
and look thin myself. Poor people sometimes give me an extra bit
for him, though."</p>
<p><a name="ch-34" id="ch-34"></a><b>Thursday, 2nd April.</b></p>
<p>We dawdled along the road to-day, aristocratically, conscious of
no pressure of hurry and above the plain-featured notion of work. I
think this is the way angels spend their time, when they are not
running errands or strumming. What pleasure to stretch the arms
lazily; to let one's weight sway, with the motion of walking, from
hip to hip; to slouch in the sun with half-closed eyes; to breathe!
Those were gracious times, of old, when students sauntered over the
countryside, and defrayed the expenses of their education by
wayside collections freely contributed. There is no money in
tramping nowadays.</p>
<p>We turned aside by a track to the right, and The Boy was stung
to protest. But the main road leads to Mittagong, as I explained,
and therefore our way lay in the direction of a half-right turn. He
was dissatisfied. So was I, when our track bore too far southward,
but I strode on automatically without change of course or
countenance. At an easterly bend, I left Bill sitting on a log, and
walked off to a selection for information. I got it from a girl who
had brown eyes, light brown hair, and a rather dark, underflushed
complexion. I loved her at second-hand for the combination, and for
an hour afterwards wished myself nearer home. She said we should
have kept to the main road, though we could reach our destination
by keeping on as we were going.</p>
<p>"How much longer is this track than the other way?"</p>
<p>She considered before saying: "About three miles; "and her
contracted lips raised alluring visions of a distant hill-side.
After all, there are ties.</p>
<p>I told Bill that the track was right, and dropped the extra
three miles into the slot of silence. For prize, I drew a sudden
cheerfulness. He chattered, and I dreamed of beaming eyes, and we
descended the slope to Berrima between three and four in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>We bought a loaf of bread and a pot of jam, and sat beneath the
bridge to make a meal. The public-school pupils are dismissed at
3.30, and above our heads constantly sounded the sweetest of music,
the pattering of children's feet. But the pattering of horses' feet
we found too violent. At the passage of rider or driver, came dust,
fine-trampled wood, and dry chewed hay, showering into our jam. But
we ate and laughed, without a thought of budging. And the children
left indelible footprints, more lasting even than the indubitate
spoor of the god who stamped his toe-marks upon rock as he strode
from hill to hill.</p>
<p>Four miles brought us to Moss Vale, a dusty town, inhospitable
(track-lore tells us) to trav'lers. A nod and "Good day!" to a
horseman produced a stony stare. We have reached civilisation.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-032.jpg"></p>
<p>There are sheds at Moss Vale Show Ground, and we intended to
scale the fence and find sleeping room under the iron roofs. We
hung about the place for half an hour. So did a man with a bridle
on his arm, who eyed us from a distance and hovered round with
obvious hostility. Perforce, we abandoned our intention, and have
settled down under a row of willows near a creek, about a mile and
three quarters from the town. We have had to collect fire-wood in
the dark, expecting to feel the sticks writhe in our hands. Clouds
are speeding across the sky from the south-east with proposals of
rain, but we lie at full stretch on either side of our little fire
and accept the drowsy moment without questioning.</p>

<hr class="longer">
<p><a name="ch-36" id="ch-36"></a><b>Good Friday, 3rd
April.</b></p>
<p>The night was kept warm with the clouds as with a blanket, and
no rain bespattered our comfort.</p>
<p>While we were at breakfast, three tourists passed, making for
the coast. They were English, I suppose, and looked
determined&mdash;seriously resolved to enjoy their tramp. They were
dressed in tweed suits with baggy knickerbockers, and had knapsacks
slung across their shoulders. Each to his taste! They were
painfully respectable. We thought it a sign of grace that they went
afoot, abjuring bicycles.</p>
<p>I went to town in the forenoon, and for comfort's sake I left my
boots at camp with The Boy. I was rewarded for my walk by evidence
of humanity even in this civilised hole. I was sitting on the
station with my back against a wall, when a man&mdash;soft felt hat,
beard a sable silvered, grey suit&mdash;approached, and diffidently
invited confidence. He had been watching me furtively for some
time, his charity at war with fear of offending.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," he began, "but is it a habit of yours to go without
boots "</p>
<p>"Oh no! I'm giving my feet a rest."</p>
<p>"But you have boots?&mdash;Excuse my pushing myself into your notice,
you know, but I&mdash;well, I thought I might be able to assist you&mdash;in
some way."</p>
<p>"That's all right. I'm much obliged."</p>
<p>"If you haven't any boots, I could find you some."</p>
<p>"Thanks, I have a pair planted in the bush. They chafed my feet,
and I'm having a holiday."</p>
<p>"Are you looking for work? If you are&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No. I have a job waiting for me further along. I'm trav'lin'
Shoalhaven way. Thanks all the same." And I shook hands with him
before turning campward.</p>
<p>A hundred yards in front of me walked two fashionably-dressed
men, with upturned trousers and broad-crooked sticks. An old
swagman, who was crouching woefully by the roadside, glanced
hopelessly at them, and clawed his beard in meditation. The sight
of my rags gave him a shock of life. He sang out:</p>
<p>"Can yer give us a fill, mate?"</p>
<p>And I parted my plug, and thought.</p>
<p>On my way I bought a bottle of beer, which I subsequently
deposited in the creek to cool. When I pulled it out at tea-time,
it was covered with leechlike parasites.</p>
<p>The little wretches were evidently sucking their hardest, but
the bottle held out; though every moment I expected to hear a
slight pop, and to see a sudden distention of a leech. How on earth
did they discover the virtue of beer?</p>
<p>Just after I had reached the willows and had stretched myself on
the broad of my back to watch the sunlight in the foliage, The Boy
asked me whether I had brought any sugar from the town.</p>
<p>"Forgot," I explained. I thrust my hand into my tangle of hidden
treasures and pulled out the grime-crusted bag. It still contained
about three spoonfuls of damp sugar, so I emptied it over the
creek.</p>
<p>"Goin' to buy some?" The Boy enquired.</p>
<p>"And walk into town for it? Thanks!"</p>
<p>"Well, <i>I</i> ain't," he snorted, as I walked off.</p>
<p>I went to an ivy-covered house a couple of hundred yards away,
and stood near the kitchen door.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-034.jpg"></p>
<p>In a few moments a serving-wench came out with a pie in her
hands and crossed the yard. She entered the main building, and I
still waited. Then she came back, without the pie, and looking at
me with a disdainful expression, asked me what I wanted.</p>
<p>"I want some sugar, please," I replied.</p>
<p>"Well, you won't get it," she told me; and she re-entered the
kitchen.</p>
<p>Still I waited. Then, as she hurried across the yard with two
vegetable-dishes, she went on: "So you'd better clear outer this."
But I treated the advice with blank indifference. She passed and
repassed, empurpled by strangling rage. At last I noticed a flash
of vindictive triumph in her eyes as she sailed across, and I
wondered whom I should have to deal with now. A grey-haired old
lady appeared at the back-door. I took off my hat and smiled.</p>
<p>"Do you want anything?" the Mistress asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Well, mum, I do," was my diffident reply, "but not if it will
be any trouble to you. I thought you mightn't mind letting me have
a spoonful of sugar."</p>
<p>"Yes, I can give you a little," she nodded, "but only a very
little. So many of you tramps come here."</p>
<p>"I want just enough for a pannikin of tea."</p>
<p>"Very well. Come with me into the kitchen."</p>
<p>The silent fury of the maid! The old lady opened a huge
canister, and asked: "Have you anything to put it in?"</p>
<p>I produced the bag.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she cried, "Isn't it rather dirty?"</p>
<p>"On the outside. The sugar makes it sticky, mum. But it's clean
enough inside. Do to take a few grains of sugar as far as the
creek, anyway."</p>
<p>"Hold it open, then, while I spoon the sugar in...Are you
travelling? Tell me when you have enough."</p>
<p>"I am, mum."</p>
<p>"Have you come far?"</p>
<p>"Well, I've done pretty well, mum. But I haven't had a job since
I started from Sydney. There's something wrong in the way this
country's governed. These are hard times for a poor man, mum&mdash;very
hard times for a poor man." And I absently watched her transferring
sugar with a teaspoon, and wished she had chosen a larger
instrument.</p>
<p>"Times are hard indeed; I feel it myself. Have you a trade?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mum, I'm a house-painter." I spoke pathetically and tried
to look as though my thoughts were far away. But I could feel the
bag growing heavier.</p>
<p>"Are you, indeed? And are you a good worker?"</p>
<p>"Well, I ought to be. I painted for Skinner and Giles for five
years, and they never complained." I had never heard of Skinner and
Giles before. They were merely an inspiration.</p>
<p>"I'm glad of that. I have a job of painting, if you'd care to do
it."</p>
<p>"With pleasure, mum. What is it?"</p>
<p>"The partition at the end of the verandah, there. I'm thinking
of having that done. How much would you charge?"</p>
<p>It was a question I had not anticipated. I knew nothing of the
cost of painting, and an estimate from me would probably create
amazement. My hope lay in dodging particulars. I replied with
reverent melancholy: "In times like these, a man must take what he
can get, mum. I'm quite ready to suit my prices to the purses of
customers. You were saying, mum, you felt the hard times. Now, if
you'll just make me an offer I dare say we won't quarrel about
it."</p>
<p>She was silent, and I supposed she was making calculations. But
at last she said with deep regret in her voice: "I'm afraid I'd
better not have it done, after all. I really can't afford it."</p>
<p>"Very well, mum, I know how it is&mdash;. Why! I beg your pardon,
mum. You've gone and filled the bag up to the top. I should have
noticed. Well, now, I am sorry; and I only wanted about a spoonful,
too. And now what am I to do? I don't like to empty it back into
the tin out of this filthy old bag."</p>
<p>"No, no," she cried hastily; "you'd better keep it now you've
got it, I suppose."</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-035.jpg"></p>
<p>"Thanks, mum, for your kindness. Good-bye. And don't bother
about that job, mum; I can worry along all right. Thanks, all the
same. Good-bye, mum." And I bowed myself out, nursing my booty, and
returned to the willows to lie on my back and study the
sun-glitter.</p>
<p>The willow canopy again, tonight: to-morrow, the track. We smoke
voluminously in loaded silence. Be Raleigh's colonists held ever in
grateful remembrance!</p>

<b>NOCTURNE</b>

Day's bright bird to the westward hovers,
          Wings outspread
  Golden-feathered and green and red,
Singing the song that is loved of lovers;
          Soft and long
          Is the evensong;
  Hope and peace in its notes are shed.

Way-worn searchers and weary cravers
          Smile and sigh,
  Knowing that health and content are nigh.
Dreamily drifting, the night-wind wavers,
          Whispers and croons,
          And sways and swoons,
  Wakes and pauses and wanders by.

Comes the season of sleep that blesses
          Weary sight
  Tired of staring against the light.
Now we long for the calm caresses,
          Tender and strong,
          And sweet as song,
  The cool embraces of healing Night.

<p>We halted at the Fitzroy Falls for refreshment, within sound of
both upper prattle and roar of the depths. A picnic party, which
had passed us earlier in a coach, had just finished a royal lunch,
and was collecting plates and sorting into pairs. None of the
company looked twice at the two dusty tramps; none offered them the
broken remnants of a pie or a cake half-eaten. I lingered, hopeful
of charity, not because I was hungry, but to give the picnickers
full opportunity to prove their deserving of pastry. They did not
even ask what we were looking at.</p>
<p>For miles we trudged along a straight flat road, flanked by
bush. Then the track took a dip, and ran down a gully at a gentle
slope, crossing the creek at times. The vegetation grew slightly
richer as we proceeded. We still had a couple of hours of daylight,
when The Boy pointed up the hill-side across the creek and spoke of
a possible cave. We explored, and found a fine roomy apartment,
with a flat sandy floor. The slope in front was strewn with dead
wood; and the clear creek below hurried along, bubbling with merry
secrets.</p>
<p>"But it's jolly early to be camping," The Boy murmured.</p>
<p>"Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!" I replied, and dropped my load
on the sand.</p>

<p><a name="ch-40" id="ch-40"></a><b>Sunday, 5th April.</b></p>
<p>We had breakfast fairly early, and a few minutes later were
overlooking Kangaroo Valley. The valley was brimming with dense
mist, a lake of white vapour, which began, as we watched, to grow
tenuous along the wooded shores, and to creep up among the trees.
The sun silvered the surface of the cloud, and drew it up into
hillocks, as we descended the pass. The zig-zag track is bounded by
a semi-tropical jungle of cabbage-palms, musk-trees, myrtles,
tamarinds, tree-nettles, wild gooseberries, and innumerable
plant-forms which I love without labelling. In forks of great trees
perched staghorn and bird's-nest ferns, and the whole mass of
vegetation was knitted solidly together with raspberries, lianas
and bush-lawyers. Through the deep shadows shot and floated the
notes of coach-whip bird and thrush.</p>
<p>Later, we came upon bush of a more familiar appearance, where
there were few trees but gums; the ground was shaggy with the
palm-like zamia. Lower still were paddocks, imperfectly cleared,
with corn and sorghum growing among the stumps. At last we reached
the valley and fine pastoral country. The mist had lifted, and the
sun was bright between lazy-pacing clouds.</p>
<p>We held a bivouac in the township, smoked, and bought stores. I
visited a baker and asked him whether he would break the Sabbath by
selling me a loaf. He looked sharply at me, and answered: "No. But
I'll <i>give</i> you one."</p>
<p>"All right," I said, and dropped threepence halfpenny back into
the 'shammy.'</p>
<p>He gave me a long tinned loaf, and, when I thanked him, said:
"Needn't thank me. The baking went wrong. If the loaf was good, you
wouldn't get it. I have a whole batch to get rid of some way."</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-038.jpg"></p>
<p>But Bill and I found no fault in the bread.</p>
<p>We turned at the Berry Road, and were soon ascending The
Mountain by a zig-zag road somewhat resembling that by which we had
made our way into the valley. Among trees of which I took
particular notice was one which bore small hairy figs, sweet but
otherwise tasteless. Bill suspected that they were poisonous, and
would not raise one to his lips until he had seen me eat a dozen.
The air was full of rich perfume from the thick brushwood. The
road's ascent is gentle, and by no means unpleasant to the
pedestrian, though I am told that people who dwell hereabouts look
on it as something to be shuddered at.</p>
<p>On the top of The Mountain we unrolled our swags beside a
crystal crayfish-haunted stream, which ran across the road in a
shallow channel about ten feet in breadth. After tea, we lit our
pipes, and talked in a desultory fashion about the future of the
Australian race. We had just agreed that, whatever our faults might
be, Australians would never develop into an arrogant nation of
truculent hypocrites like the English, when two men drove down to
the ford in a trap. Their horse was startled by the glimmer of our
watchfire, brokenly reflected in the water, and suddenly shied,
refusing to make the passage. A voice, which nobody could mistake
for that of an Australian, was heard uttering vain expostulations
and words of soothing affection. I proffered advice and assistance,
explained the nature of the road, and quieted the frightened horse.
Then I led the beast across, wading in cold water, and wondering
whether I should get a shilling for the job&mdash;or more. The night was
dark, and the zig-zag road unfenced; but they were anxious to reach
Kangaroo Valley, and received my information with the coolness of
omniscient ignorance. One of them asked what we were doing.</p>
<p>I said: "Trav'lin'"; and thought I scented coin.</p>
<p>"Oh?" said the questioner, quite at a loss.</p>
<p>His companion came to his rescue. "Oh yes! Yes, of
course&mdash;selling things. What do you sell?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," I replied.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing!" echoed the strangers in a tone expressive of
enlightenment. And away rattled the trap.</p>
<p>"What did they mean by 'selling'?" The Boy asked, as I took off
my wet trousers and spread them to the blaze.</p>
<p>"Commercials," I said. "They were Britishers."</p>
<p><a name="ch-41" id="ch-41"></a><b>Monday, 6th April.</b></p>
<p>In the night a violent wind sprang up, and blustered for nearly
an hour. I awoke, thought I smelt singeing blankets, slapped my bed
at random, and went to sleep again. The morning revealed havoc. A
spark from the whipped fire had reached our pile of stores, and had
smouldered and spread. We had lost a pound of tea, several
tucker-bags, some pease, a handkerchief, and a shoulder-strap.</p>
<p>A workman from a road camp, a mile ahead, came along with a
halter in his hand, looking for a runaway horse. I had heard a
horse pass in the night, and told him so. He was Australian and
poor, and was grateful even for an almost valueless scrap of
information.</p>
<p>"D'yer smoke?" he asked.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Catch," he said, and threw me half a cake of tobacco.</p>
<p>The spirit of comradeship lies full length on our continent, a
sleeping giant. When he is wakened, he will be recognised by those
who wrong us as a formidable adversary. In him rests our strength.
Even the worn-out tradition of hostility between Sydney and
Melbourne is treated as a preposterous joke by all but fools and
foreigners who bray of border hatred and bid the friends pelt each
other from the Murray banks. Australia has only one heart.</p>
<p>From the eastern edges of The Mountain, we overlooked miles upon
miles of coast and sea, with the distant headlands fading into
sunny haze, and the Shoalhaven district mapped out below us.
Nevertheless, we did not stop long to gaze, but descended to the
'town' of Berry. Berry is an uninviting flat huddle of houses, with
no redeeming points. We hurried through the dreary village with no
loss of time, determined to camp in Gerringong, which is the
prettiest township on the coast.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-039.jpg"></p>
<p>A dip in a willow-shaded creek preceded dinner. A prolonged
siesta followed. Bill was footsore, and the metalled roads were no
improvement, in his eyes, upon earthen tracks. For various reasons
we made our way over the hills very slowly, and night overtook us
before we reached Gerringong. Luckily I knew good quarters, for I
had camped here before. On the slope above a long pale brown beach
stand two empty houses. One of them is the regular stopping-place
for tramps and bummers. We stumbled through a rough paddock,
amazing cows and execrating the pitchiness of the night, and
reached the house. We unloaded with great relief.</p>
<p>"I'll get water," I said, "while you get wood."</p>
<p>So Bill sank into the darkness, and I groped my way down to the
cow-trampled swamp which lay between us and the beach.</p>
<p>On my way back, I met The Boy, and asked if he had gathered any
wood.</p>
<p>"Two pieces," he answered wearily.</p>
<p>"Bill Smith," I said, after examination of his find, "you're
making a mistake. We don't want toothpicks till after tea."</p>
<p>"Can't find any more."</p>
<p>"Take the water to the house, and I'll look around."</p>
<p>Far away to the left lay a clump of bush, as I knew, and I
worked towards it painfully. I tore my clothes on a barbed-wire
fence and plunged into the swamp, but I reached the bush. Somebody
had been there before me, for I could hardly find a stick. While I
was crawling about and raking with my fingers, I heard a whistle.
It was from The Boy. I whistled back, and he sang out:</p>
<p>"How did you get there? "</p>
<p>"Walked."</p>
<p>I heard him talking to himself, and then there was a splash and
the sound of suction as he pulled his leg out of a mud-hole.</p>
<p>"This isn't the way," he told me.</p>
<p>I did not think it was.</p>
<p>He made a few more trials, and finally stood beside me. Together
we collected a few sticks, and then gave up in disgust. On the
return journey, we went a short distance inland to avoid the swamp,
and found a deserted picnic-fire with its heart still glowing, and
beside it a noble heap of wood. We took as much as we could carry,
and a few minutes afterwards the flames were roaring up our
chimney.</p>
<p>We intend to sleep to-night on the verandah which fronts the
ocean. The music of the waves is in our ears&mdash;</p>
<pre class="poem">

The various rush, in front; behind, the roar
Continual, changeless, never less or more,
The great sea's mystic song and magic spell,
Whose meaning man may feel, but none may tell.

<p><a name="ch-42" id="ch-42"></a><b>Tuesday, 7th April.</b></p>
<p>We saw day break upon the sea. Very slowly the tender regretful
Eos drew aside with rosy fingers the diaphanous many-dyed curtains
that Apollo the Magnificent might step from the gilded portals of
the East. In fact, dawn was followed by sunrise. The sight was
worthy of being left undescribed by a master of word painting.</p>
<p><img class="figright" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-040.jpg"></p>
<p>Instead of going back to the road, we proceeded along the shore
for a little distance, dodging sly waves on the beaches, collecting
shells, and looking for echidnae and anemones in the crevices of
the rocks. When we came to a naturally hollowed tank, we bathed.
The water was so clear that, sitting quietly at the bottom, we
could see the tiny fish, which swam round us in wonder at the
harmless monsters of the air and, at our slightest movement, darted
off and were lost in the marvellous blending of colors which
represented rocks, weeds and pebbles. But mortal men cannot live
long in the fairy world; it can never become stale; Science herself
cannot destroy its mystery.</p>
<p>Between the sea and the railway, we found mushrooms so gigantic
that they incurred suspicion. I took one which measured about nine
inches from side to side, and suggested that we should have it for
dinner.</p>
<p>"Might be poisonous," Bill objected.</p>
<p>"Might," I agreed.</p>
<p>I found a smaller fungus of similar shape and appearance, and
ate it as a test. The agreement was that, if I died, the large
mushroom was to be thrown away. I have not died, and we have shared
the suspected umbrella and found it coarse.</p>
<p>We had dinner near an old mill, not far from Kiama. As we were
talking, a cricket, lurking beneath dry leaves, joined in with
sudden trills.</p>
<p>"Little beast!" ejaculated The Boy, and stamped at the spot from
which he thought the music came.</p>
<p>"Stop," I cried. "Don't kill it."</p>
<p>"Why not."</p>
<p>"Stupidity and strength don't tot up to right."</p>
<p>He stamped again, and when I checked his gymnastics, said: "Do
you know what these things do?"</p>
<p>"Don't want to."</p>
<p>"They eat cabbages. Chew all round the stalk."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"They won't eat the whole cabbage," he complained angrily.</p>
<p>"Have you seen a cabbage in this district? When did you last set
eyes on cabbages?"</p>
<p>"Dunno. No more do you."</p>
<p>"I do. We passed a cartload at Moss Vale, and haven't seen a
trace of one since."</p>
<p>"Don't care. They do lots o' mischief in our garden."</p>
<p>"If you stamp round any more you can go your own gait home. I'll
take another track. Do you think I want my course through the
country dotted out in dead things? Don't be a damned fool.</p>
<p>And that is the nearest approach to a serious quarrel that The
Boy and I have made. But I have never come so near with any other
mate. He is young, and has hardly begun to learn that he is not an
alien individual backed by living tapestry. Probably he has much to
urge against me, but, you see, I am writing this diary.</p>
<p>Of course we visited the famous Kiama Blow-hole, where</p>
<pre class="poem">

    "underground there rolls s sound
From where the prisoned waters glide."

</pre>
<p>But an intense calm drowsed on sea and land, and no fountain of
spray shot into the air. Only, in the tunnel, the surly waters,
withheld from play, growled discontent and gurgled submission. I
had often seen the Blow-hole before, but it was new to The Boy, and
he was disappointed.</p>
<p>Towards evening, the thought of camping arose.</p>
<p>"But where?" asked Bill.</p>
<p>"There's a flea-hopping camp, a couple of miles on."</p>
<p>"Oh Lord!"</p>
<p>"We'll have tea first, and think about camp after."</p>
<p>"Tea?&mdash;Where? There's no firewood about this place."</p>
<p>Come on."</p>
<p>I knocked at the door of a cottage, for I am not unknown in
Kiama. A gentleman came to the door, and glared enquiringly,
suspicious of beggary. I nodded, with confidence of friendship, and
said: "I suppose you don't recognise me in this rig, Mr. O'Keefe?"
The supposition hit the clout, for he stared with knitted brows.
When I laughed, his face lightened.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilford!" he let out. "No, I should never have known you.
But your voice&mdash;I never forget voices."</p>
<p>He asked us in, ragamuffins as we were, introduced us to his
wife, and invited us to join them at the tea-table. The Boy's
sidelong shuffiings and his alacrity in accepting a chair were due
less to shyness and fatigue than to a painful consciousness of a
breach of decency in his attire. O'Keefe, with painful courtesy,
failed to notice the rent an envious stalagmite had made. I am his,
heart and hand. May his stars be polished by God's most industrious
angels!</p>
<p>At about nine o'clock we sallied forth once more. There was an
empty passenger train standing near the goods-shed, waiting for the
morning. "We must leave early, Bill," I said, as we climbed into a
first-class compartment.</p>
<p><a name="ch-43" id="ch-43"></a><b>Wednesday, 8th April.</b></p>
<p>Northward we passed, skirting the Minna-Murra River, crossing
the bridge, and then following the railway until we came to Shell
Harbour platform, where we turned seaward to visit the township
which gives the station its name. Refreshed with deep draughts of
ozone and beer, we turned inland again towards Albion Park. We left
the road, followed up a little creek to the right, in search of
clean water, and came to a halt for lunch beside a green-mantled
pool which was only moderately befouled by cattle. We threw
ourselves into the long dry grass, and munched the bread we had
bought at Shell Harbour.</p>
<p>I was lifting the billy from the fire when a jew-lizard came
rushing down the hill towards me, and stopped close to my foot. He
came from a little thicket, some twenty or thirty feet away, and
ran&mdash;as jew-lizards always do when they are in a great hurry&mdash;on
his hind legs. His eyes were round, and his flanks throbbed.</p>
<p>"Hokey!" I exclaimed. "Just look what a fright this lizard's in.
Must be a snake in that clump."</p>
<p>The Boy rose hastily from his nest in the grass, while I went to
the thicket and saw the end of a shiny monster gliding away among
the leaves. We bombarded the thicket with boulders, hurled with
Cyclops force. The snake stole away on the other side of the
shelter, and I found him with his head hidden under a tiny bush. A
stone, badly aimed, struck but did not disable him, and he shot,
with head erect, into a brake where he was safe. He was fully six
feet long, glossy black, with large convex scales.</p>
<p>"How about dotting your course?" The Boy queried.</p>
<p>I ignored him.</p>
<p>Between Albion Park and Dapto we were overtaken by a lady and
gentleman in a sort of waggonette&mdash;a shallow vehicle adorned with
the name of somebody's sewing machine. They pulled up close to us,
and the gentleman hailed us. We waited.</p>
<p>"I hope you won't mind my suggesting it," he said politely, but
we have a few sandwiches, and we thought you might not mind taking
them."</p>
<p>"Much obliged, I'm sure," I said; "we'd be very glad o'
them."</p>
<p>He groped under the seat and brought out a brown paper parcel,
which he surveyed with some dismay. His apologies were ample: "I'm
very sorry," he said, "but I find there are fewer sandwiches than I
thought; in fact, there are only two. But if you don't mind&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it. One apiece is good enough. G'day!"</p>
<p>He handed me a couple of ham sandwiches, which I bestowed upon
Bill with my blessing as soon as the donor was out of sight.</p>
<p>At nightfall we reached the crossing at Mullet Creek and found
five workers&mdash;who were making for Albion Park&mdash;camped under the
willows. We made use of their fire to boil our soup. These minor
pre-ordained conveniences you will recognise as characteristic of
our tour. They are the direct result of friendship with the pagan
gods, Hellenic and Teutonic. Moreover, I have a special protector,
for like a well-known freeman, I was littered under
Mercury&mdash;witness my empty purse and my love of wandering.</p>
<p>A wild wind sprang up in the south and hurled itself upon us,
scattering the embers of the fire, and lashing the willows. Clouds
rushed up and flung showers of rain as they passed, murmuring,
fearful of being late at some elemental celebration, anxious to
exhibit their ghastly power. The five navvies rolled their swags
and fled towards the nearest hotel. The Boy and I took refuge under
the bridge. The atmospheric disturbance grew more pronounced. Out
at sea, a tempest was executing its frenzied dance. We could see
the flashes of lightning; could hear the rumbling of thunder. From
more than one quarter, as it seemed to us, huge bodies of cloud
fled towards the centre of turmoil, like regiments of artillery
hurrying into action. And we sat on our swags and waited till the
stinging showers had ceased. Then we returned to the willows and
made up the fire with wood which the navvies had painfully
collected. The wind is busily removing all traces of rain.</p>

<p>Beside the road, half a mile to the south of Wollongong, rested
three miners in various stages of intoxication. One lay on his face
in the grass. Of the other two, who sat with their feet in the
gutter, one imagined himself almost sober, and the other was
admittedly drunk and frankly self-depreciatory.</p>
<p>"Come on," shouted the Self-depreciator to us. "Chuck off yer
swags, mates, 'n' 'ave a drink."</p>
<p>"Yesh," corroborated the Sober One,
"cumanaverdrink&mdash;uhrp&mdash;lotshere."</p>
<p>"There ain't," growled the man in the grass.</p>
<p>But the Sober One held out a soda-water bottle full of rum, and
smiled invitation; whereat I swigged gravely, and returned the
bottle that he might pledge me.</p>
<p>"There's no sush crimson fools in th' worl' as miners,"
explained the Self-depreciator. "Look 'ere!" He thrust his hat
back, and slapped his retreating forehead for confirmation.</p>
<p>"They're mostly real good fellows," I said.</p>
<p>"Thasho," the Sober One said with sapient nod, "but he's awri',
though he <i>is</i> drunk."</p>
<p>"No, he ain't," from the man in the grass.</p>
<p>"Will yer come 'th us fer th' night?" invited the
Self-depreciator. "Our comp'ny ain't mush, but we've gollotser
tucker."</p>
<p>"Goin' stinkin'," the man in the grass commented.</p>
<p>"Not too shtinkin'," the Sober One assured us.</p>
<p>The man in the grass raised a fresh point. "Too far."</p>
<p>"Yesh; too far, mi' be," said the Sober One. "We live up on
slopesher Moun' Kemler." An explanatory wave of the hand almost
upset him.</p>
<p>We regretted that the slopes of Mount Kembla were too distant
from our track, but expressed gratitude for the hospitable
offer.</p>
<p>The Sober One then gave us some parting advice. "If yer look'n'
fur work at th' mines&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We ain't," I interrupted.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;well, no!" he said thoughtfully. After a moment's pause a
bright idea struck him, and he continued cheerfully: "But I shay if
y'are&mdash;if y'are&mdash;be careful even if yer know all&mdash;uhrp&mdash;'bout it.
If yer don't&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We ain't looking for work."</p>
<p>"No. I'm tell'n' yer, cosh I'm sobresh o' th' three."</p>
<p>"Shut up," snarled the man in the grass.</p>
<p>The Sober One smiled benignantly at the prostrate figure, winked
heavily at us, and kept on: "If yer don't know 'nything,
don't&mdash;uhrp&mdash;don't take it."</p>
<p>The advice was sound, no doubt. He was adding to it when we
passed out of hearing.</p>
<p>I am writing this at Woonona, in a patch of bush where I,
perhaps, am a trespasser. At any rate, nailed to the tree against
which I am leaning is a notice-board bearing the words: <i>Miners'
Pathway an Sufferance</i>. But a trav'ler must camp somewhere.</p>
<p>The stars remind me of Marjorie's eyes, and I almost feel as
though she were looking at me&mdash;not reproachfully, but with a
generous love which knows nothing of such nice particulars as
resentment or forgiveness. And the breath of the evening is like
her presence, surrounding me with subtle deliciousness which none
of the five senses can perceive. Since I left her, my love has been
glowing by reflection from everything I see, or feel, or hear, and
the whole world is a glass to my delight. Nature offers me
compensation for the absence of my dear one. My passion is recorded
in a thousand beautiful forms. I see it in the green crops which
bow to the glad breeze; the wind scribbles it across the water; it
flares in the sunset, and glitters on the sea-track of molten gold
at sunrise; the wagtails chatter it, and the leaves tell it in
whispers; I feel it in the soft, strong grasp of the ocean, in the
warmth of sunshine, and in the swing and resistance of branches
pushed aside. I believe the birds are happier when I pass through
the groves where they flute to their chosen companions.</p>
<p><a name="ch-46" id="ch-46"></a><b>Friday, 10th April.</b></p>
<p>The beauty of the coastal scenery has been bedimmed all day with
a thick haze, caused probably by smoke from bush fires. But the
subdued colouring and uncertainty of outline in the landslip
harmonised with our almost sleepy satisfaction as we drifted
onward. We halted occasionally for a meal, a bath, or a smoke, but
we seldom spoke. The silence was luxurious.</p>
<p>Below the crumbling cliffs at Clifton I picked up a pin and
stuck it in my waistband&mdash;I was not wearing a coat&mdash;with prevision
of future uses. The Boy said: "Picking up a pin means you'll have
good luck."</p>
<p>"Then you ought to be pleased," I said. "We share our luck
pretty equally, I think."</p>
<p>But, while looking out a good camping-ground at Stanwell Park, I
found a bed&mdash;a couple of sacks on a frame-work of saplings. The Boy
said, with gloomy triumph: "I told you so," and saw the hand of
Providence. I rigged the bunk on a couple of logs, and find it very
comfortable.</p>

<b>BENEATH THE TREES</b>

Abysmal ease received us both,

An unimaginable sloth,

The rush of water, hum of bees,
    And air to slumber nothing loth,

<p><a name="ch-48" id="ch-48"></a><b>Saturday, 11th April.</b></p>
<p>We had hardly slipped between our blankets, when a wind of
terrific violence swept, down upon us, and the bush was full of
mingled sounds of strife, the lashing of leafy boughs, groaning of
tortured trees, and the rending and crashing of branches torn from
the trunk and hurled to the ground. Then rain came pelting through
the bush. I spread my oilcloth over the top of my bed, and lay
listening to the storm and the tattoo of rain-drops. Bill had no
means of protection, and was jealous.</p>
<p>He said: "It doesn't cover up the end of the bed."</p>
<p>I grunted.</p>
<p>He said: "The rain will get in and run under you."</p>
<p>"My troubles!" I said. "I'll sleep here, if the bed turns into a
trough."</p>
<p>He rolled up his swag to keep his blankets dry, dressed himself,
and sat by the fire. The warmth sent him to sleep; and he awoke
towards morning, steaming. I believe he was sorry I had not got
wet, but the rain had not lasted long, and I had warded it off
without difficulty.</p>
<p>The wind still held its course, but we bathed in the lagoon, and
defied low temperature and stinging volleys of sand, for at this
point we were to bid farewell to the sea. The low-lying strip of
land ends at Stanwell Park, for the coastal range of hills curves
in and runs sheer down to the ocean.</p>
<p>We passed through Otford, a mining township, and followed the
railway to Helensburgh, where we had dinner. The sand flew over us
in clouds, and our food was gritty with it, but we cheerfully bent
to the will of the gods, and enjoyed ourselves.</p>
<p>We tried a short cut later on, but it took us away in a
semi-circle until we were walking southwards and about three miles
from the road.</p>
<p>We turned from the misleading dray-track, and plunged into a
gully. Slowly we made our way through thick undergrowth and deep
beds of rotting vegetation. We crossed the creek, and began
climbing the opposite hill. An unused foot-path, which ran parallel
with the stream, we disregarded, and waded on until we reached an
irregular terrace of rocks, which we skirted, looking for a
convenient pass. The Boy was in front, when I heard him cry in a
hoarse whisper: "God! Knight, look at this!" And I looked. We were
opposite a little cave, about five feet high and four deep. And
there, with her back against the wall, as though she were resting,
sat an old lady in a seedy black dress. Her draggled bonnet was
hanging rakishly on the side of her head, and her long-dead face,
with its brown and broken shreds of mummied flesh, glared at us
with empty eye-sockets and grinned with a lipless mouth. Her right
hand was mouldering into the sand at her side; her left lay on her
lap, and I saw on the grisly fingers several rings. And one of the
rings was a plain golden circlet. As I stood gazing at this
grey-haired Queen of Solitude I thought of Marjorie, and felt
myself clutched and held prisoner by unreasoning fear. I longed for
my dear girl with fierce and frantic desire. My flesh crept and
shuddered, and I felt my muscles twitching. My breath clicked in my
throat. The Boy recalled me to my senses.</p>
<p>"What are we to do now?" he asked, as though somebody had
injured him.</p>
<p>"Marry, well remembered! We must get along to some place where
we can make a decent camp. This gully is too snaky-looking, and
we'd be too likely to start a bush-fire."</p>
<p>But about that?" he said, pointing.</p>
<p>"Too heavy, with the swag, for me," I said; "I'll leave it, I
think."</p>
<p>He laughed aloud. Then his ghastly merriment infected me and the
gully rang. We left off suddenly, and the silence leaped stealthily
back. It was horrible. Again Bill spoke:</p>
<p>"I suppose we must tell the police, though."</p>
<p>But I turned away without speaking and made my way up the slope.
The scrub grew less dense, and in a few minutes we came to a bush
track leading, approximately, in the direction in which we wished
to go, and finally we came upon the railway close to Waterfall.</p>
<p>We have camped near the ruins of a humpy between Waterfall and
Heathcote. Little is left of the hut besides a brick-built chimney,
and of the bricks we have constructed a neat breakwind and a broad
fireplace. If a fire were allowed to have its own way in this thick
low scrub, the National Park would be swept by the flames in a few
hours, for the wind has not yet died away.</p>
<p>Shall I be sorry or glad when I reach home? I have been enjoying
my liberty so much, and yet&mdash;. I believe, after all, it depends on
the light in one pair of brown eyes. God bless them!</p>
<p><a name="ch-49" id="ch-49"></a><b>Sunday, 12th April.</b></p>
<p>We must be very improvident! How came it otherwise that for
breakfast we had only a few grains of rice, which we solemnly
seethed in the bottom of a pannikin? However, we ate our meal
slowly in Barmecide spoonfuls, and started, with tightened
girdle-straps through a barren stretch of country, a dry gravelly
waste where nothing can grow but stunted scrub and a few gnarled
and dwarfish gums.</p>
<p>At Sutherland we were attracted by an inscription upon the front
of a house: SUTHERLAND BAKERY AND BUTCHER. We went to the rear of
the shop, entered the yard, and interviewed a woman who was
standing on a verandah. Several children were playing in the
yard.</p>
<p>"Could you sell us a loaf of bread?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but we have none left."</p>
<p>"Yes, mother," a little boy said, "there's one loaf in the
bread-box."</p>
<p>"Is there?" said the woman, "Wait a bit, and I'll see."</p>
<p>She went into the house, and returned with a loaf.</p>
<p>"It's stale," she said.</p>
<p>"No matter."</p>
<p>When I produced the 'shammy' she waved it aside, saying she
would not charge us anything for stale bread, and I did not press
her to violate her conscience. We retired to the shade of a giant
gum-tree, about a hundred yards from the bakery, and there we
devoured our dry bread with great relish. While we were thus
employed, a little girl came to us with a newspaper parcel. "Mother
thought you might like a bit of meat," she said, and handed us the
parcel, which contained about two pounds of cold roast beef. The
baker's family had been watching us from the window. The kindly
man, says philology, is the natural man. On the track, we cannot
materially affect a man's fortunes for good or evil. Therefore, he
appears to us as he is; he displays his real nature; he is
kindly.</p>
<p><img class="figleft" alt="" src=
"1300671h-images/landlopers-042.jpg"></p>
<p>We walked along the line until we reached Como, where the
railway bridge spans George's River. We crossed unobserved, and
threw a stone at the notice which threatens foot-passengers with a
fine of "not more than twenty pounds." At Tempe we were overtaken
by a trap containing a family&mdash;father, mother, little girl and two
boys. The gentleman, who was driving, drew up and offered us a
lift. We jumped up, and were carried briskly on through the
gathering shades of night, over Cook's River and right into
Newtown.</p>
<p>The lady, who had prompted her husband to pick us up, said: "I
saw you in Hurstville, from the verandah of an hotel."</p>
<p>"Thanks for remembering us," I said; "we are grateful."</p>
<p>We alighted at the Newtown railway-bridge. A man was standing on
the pavement, leaning against a post. I addressed him: "Any trams
going out Marrickville way?"</p>
<p>"I think so. Goin' down the coast?"</p>
<p>"No. Just come from there."</p>
<p>"Did you come through&mdash;? What's the name o' that stinkin' little
town the other side o' Kiama?"</p>
<p>"Gerringong!"</p>
<p>"That's it. Come through there?" I was down that way, Christmas time.
Stopped in that old house above the beach&mdash;know it?"</p>
<p>"We stopped there."</p>
<p>"There was a poor old devil dying in it when I came through.
Here's your tram. Good night!"</p>
<p>At Dulwich Hill we called at the home of some friends of mine,
who received us with the utmost kindness, giving us a spread of
tucker no less distinguished by abundance than by variety. Further,
they have asked us to stay here for the night. Each of us has a
room to himself, and I feel like Sly the tinker in the house of the
lordly jester. Was it this morning that I breakfasted with a
spoonful of rice on top of a scrubby hill? And here I lie, full
stretch, on a spring mattress, and jot down by gaslight the events
of the long day. I am yawning over the page; I have written enough.
Dreams of brown eyes beckon me towards the cave of Sleep.</p>

<p>It did not take us long to swing into Sydney, where we pushed
through the crowded streets, exulting in contact with men and
women. He must be a very small-minded man who feels no shocks of
joyousness in the pressure of human crowds, jostle of shoulders and
swift interchange of glances. In silent nights on lonely
mountain-tops, and where the stream of humanity sweats in the
summer sunlight of the streets, in every spot and at all times and

<p>We parted soon after leaving the boat, and the two strands of
our joint existence fell easily apart, but slightly crumpled to
each other's form by contact. Bill hurried on, whistling. I turned
to the left, the side where a man's heart naturally lies. In a few
minutes I stood at the garden gate before the little weatherboard
cottage, and very gently eased my swag from the shoulder and laid
it noiselessly on the path; for somebody was at the piano, idly
improvising a strangely irregular and broken accompaniment to
wandering thoughts and emotions that sweep across the mind like
wind that dashes down a reach of waveless water. I know her touch;
and the music filled me with certain hope as I stood listening. The
blind was down to shade the room from the evening sun, but love and
memory gave me the vision of her dreaming eyes. I crept along the
grass border to the verandah and leaned against one of the posts,
and the music was like cool water running upon tired limbs. It was
good to have been away&mdash;merely for this.</p>
<p>Suddenly the music quickened into a tune, and my heart beat time
to it, for it was mine. Then she sang, though the words were not in
harmony with her mood, and their inane gaiety struck me as
incongruous and grotesque, so that I laughed softly.</p>
<pre class="poem">

"Summer is a-comin' in,
Bringin' back the swag an' billy,
Loafin' mate an' pannikin&mdash;
Summer is <i>a-comin'</i> in."

</pre>
<p>It was madly ludicrous, and my laughter fluttered through my
melancholy, as a bright-plumed bird in the dusk of sunset. Months
ago she asked me why I never wrote or published songs, and
jestingly I brought her as a reason this stupid perversion of a
medieval lyric, with its tinpot melody. She was pausing now, and I
wondered whether she was coming out. On the fence a Jack-o'-Winter
was calling monotonously to her mate:
"Peter&mdash;Peter&mdash;Peter&mdash;Peter&mdash;Peter! and faintly from the other side
of the paddock came his reassuring reply:
"Dearie&mdash;Dearie&mdash;Dearie&mdash;Dearie&mdash;Dearie!" And I wondered why they
sat so far apart.</p>
<p>The music began again, and again I heard her voice.</p>
<pre class="poem">

"Summer is a-comin' in
Over country flat an' hilly;
Bees are workin' in the whin&mdash;
Summer is a'comin' in.

Summer is a-comin' in.
Silver clouds are up above me;
Leaf an' feather, hand an' fin,
<i>Summer</i> is a-comin' in.

Summer is a-comin' in.
Wayside friends o' mine who love me,
Hear me chuckle with a grin,
Summer is a-comin' in.

</pre>
<p>She ceased suddenly, and the bass notes moaned at the weight of
her forearm. I tiptoed from the verandah, slammed the gate, and
crunched back boldly down the gravel path. I carefully avoided
looking at the window, but I know the blind moved. With beating
heart I waited till she came. She was quiet and tried to appear
careless, but her brown eyes, with their glistening brim of unshed
tears were traitors to her purpose. She stood in the doorway, and
looked at me in critical disapproval of my appearance. And I almost
held my breath, in fear that my joy and amusement would take arms
against me and leave me at her mercy.</p>
<p>So you're back again?" she said.</p>
<p>"Are you sorry?" I ventured to ask.</p>
<p>"Well, I should think I ought to be."</p>
<p>"Marjorie!"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Are you sorry?"</p>
<p>"You ought to know&mdash;. No, don't go, Knight&mdash;not yet."</p>
<p>I reached the gate, opened it, and lifted my swag.</p>
<p>"Knight, come back. I want you to tell me where you've been&mdash;and
what you've been doing."</p>
<p>"Are you sorry?" I repeated, as I unhooked the billy from the
fence.</p>
<p>"No," she said. I dropped my burdens, and came back. She caught
me by the arm, and continued: "Not <i>very</i> sorry, I mean. No,
you can't get away now."</p>
<p>"Marjorie," I murmured," have you found an excuse for me?"</p>
<p>"Well, I've tried," she said doubtfully.</p>
<p>I remembered how she had torn herself from my arms; how she she
had flung the sharp, breathless words of renunciation at me as the
gate clashed between us; and how my loneliness had served as a void
for the cold stars to swing in. And it was enough for me that she
had <i>tried</i> to palliate my impulsive wrongfulness.</p>
<p>"You forgive me?" was my next suggestion.</p>
<p>"If I say 'Yes,' you'll be as bad as ever in a week, I
suppose."</p>
<p>But as I did not feel inclined to offer premature denial of so
likely a supposition, I only urged her to tell me I was pardoned.
In love, the present is all important. She forgave me, with great
show of reluctance.</p>
<p>"Prove it, Sweetheart," I said, for she spoke with face
averted.</p>
<p>"No, no! Well&mdash;but somebody's <i>sure</i> to see. O Knight, I'm
so glad&mdash;I'm so glad."</p>

<b>AN AFTERWORD</b>

This book of ours that sheet by sheet
I gave you as I wrote it, Sweet,
     Afar in timorous days when yet
     My love in words I dared not set,
At last I bring to you complete.

It tells of lagging hours and fleet,
Of two whose blood with rapid beat
     Thrilled each to each wheneer they met&mdash;
               This book of ours.

And dreams there be that still intreat,
In passionate terms of swooning heat,
     Your hopes to fly far forth and let
     The Future take them in his net.
Dear <i>eyes</i>, glow softly when you meet
               This book of ours.
