  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I.&mdash;THE MEETING</h2>

  <p class="first">In the year 1444 there reigned in Brittany, one of the
  fairest fiefs of France, François II., son of the great Duke, Jean V. and
  Jeanne of France, daughter of the unfortunate Charles VI.</p>

  <p>He came to the throne in a time of peace. Between him and his two brothers
  was perfect friendship, and the wars that tore France did not disturb
  Brittany, unmolested by foreigners, strong and respected at home.</p>

  <p>From the hand of François himself came the glint of the sword that
  brightening smote the country into factions, the little quarrels that spread
  into civil war, the little whispers that grew into foul slanders, the petty
  jealousies and intrigues that became heartbreaks and miseries.</p>

  <p>And the beginning of this was the coming to the court of Rennes, of Guy de
  Montauban, a penniless Breton noble.</p>

  <p>That was five years ago and for those five years had his influence spread
  and his power grown, till the Duke was a mere puppet in his hands and
  Brittany, delivered to him, slipping fast into a state of weakness and
  internal disorders.</p>

  <p>Men wondered what gave to Montauban his great power over the Duke. For Guy
  de Montauban was in every sense an ordinary man. He had neither charm,
  gaiety, splendour, nor brilliant talents to attract the senses; neither
  affection, honesty, devotion nor truth to attach the heart.</p>

  <p>Born in Italy, of an Italian mother, educated in Padua with all the
  elegance of the time (a training that, while it gave him neither wit nor
  talents, yet gave him a certain power of concealing lack of ability, and a
  finish in his manner, a gravity and dignity in his demeanour, his indolent,
  narrow mind was far from confirming)&mdash;Guy de Montauban, by the mere
  chance infatuation of the Duke, found himself at the age of thirty-five in a
  position to dictate to a reigning Prince and to use a whole country, if he
  willed, for his sport.</p>

  <p>Yet even those who hated him most could not say he had made any great
  ill-use of his power. Things went wrong in Brittany, it was more through de
  Montauban's carelessness than his ill-will, he had no more the capacity for
  great crimes than for great strength or heroism. Indifferent to most things,
  if he sundered the Duke from his brothers, it was through idle talk, more the
  result of his position than his character.</p>

  <p>Placed so that he could have swept the younger princes from before him,
  for five years Montauban had tolerated them about the Duke; Pierre, the
  second brother, who was meek, content to be overlooked, he even helped and
  treated with kindness.</p>

  <p>Indolent and infirm of purpose, he spent his days in amusements that
  wearied, and useless quarrels with the only person at the Duke's court he had
  any active feeling for, namely, Gilles of Brittany, the Duke's third and
  youngest brother.</p>

  <p>High-spirited, handsome, honest-hearted, full of gaiety and ambition,
  Gilles would not brook the all-powerful favourite, and by mocks and taunts,
  open and covert, stung Guy de Montauban into a dull feeling of hate. But
  Gilles cared nothing. Defying Duke and favourite both, he openly demanded his
  appanage; declared the Duke was bewitched, and only the good offices of
  Pierre and the Duchess patched up a hollow truce between him and Montauban.
  But the gay Prince's laughing taunts were not forgotten. It was not long
  before Montauban induced the Duke to send Gilles on an embassy to England and
  so remove from his sight the man who humbled him in his own eyes.</p>

  <p>But Gilles, seeing rightly enough who had dictated the move would not go;
  he feared Montauban would work his undoing in his absence.</p>

  <p>Then Montauban made Rennes unbearable, until at last, now more mindful of
  the present than the future, light-hearted Gilles left Brittany, not for
  England indeed but for France, where, with a company of English mercenaries
  he did good service against the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile François, already feeble in health, grew more sickly. Impossible
  he would live long, it was possible he might die in a few months. He left no
  children, Brittany would pass to Pierre, and Montauban's fortunes fall like a
  house of cards.</p>

  <p>There was only one thing could secure them, a wealthy marriage, such as
  now in the heydey of his power he might make.</p>

  <p>He had only to speak his choice. The Duke would confirm it. There was no
  lady in Brittany, however, rich enough to tempt him. France was impoverished
  and it would be impolitic to leave the Duke to seek further.</p>

  <p>Meantime, Gilles, returning from France, came again to his brother's court
  and asked his consent to his marriage with Françoise de Dinan, an unknown and
  penniless lady whom he had seen by chance and, for pure love, would
  marry.</p>

  <p>Now were the two brothers once more reconciled. François II. had no
  objection to the match, the granting of which brought his brother into
  subjection; nor had Montauban any dislike to seeing Gilles unite himself to
  one who could bring him neither position, influence nor money.</p>

  <p>Françoise de Dinan was the niece of Robert de Dinan, one of the richest
  nobles in Brittany or France, lord of the great lands of the house of Rohan,
  Chateaubriand, Bain, Beaumanoir, Hardouinaye and Montafilan, in all a fortune
  for a Prince; yet she brought no dowry with her hand, for she was the
  daughter of Robert de Dinan's younger brother who, after marrying a French
  princess, having flung his fortune to the winds in luxury and extravagance,
  had left at his death wife and daughter penniless.</p>

  <p>Françoise found with her uncle a home, nothing more. Two years ago he had
  betrothed her to his on and heir and all honour had been lavished on her, but
  now Philippe de Dinan was wedded to another and she lived alone with her
  attendants in the château of Hardouinaye.</p>

  <p>It was not Philippe's fault he had not married his cousin. She gave him
  back his troth to plight herself to Guy de Laval, an even richer match, who
  quarrelled with her over the Lord of Beaumanoir.</p>

  <p>And he too parted in anger from her, and so at seven and twenty Françoise
  de Dinan was still unwed, when her schemes and her beauty brought Gilles'
  honest heart to her feet and she took the chance he offered.</p>

  <p>She had never loved any; to dislike Gilles of Brittany was impossible, her
  lone life was growing well-nigh unbearable. He was a Prince and the Duke's
  brother.</p>

  <p>These were her reasons and his was simply love.</p>

  <p>Françoise de Dinan, older than Gilles by five years, was a poet, a
  musician, selfish, beautiful, passionately enamoured of the graces of life,
  colours, fancies, artificial emotions. Elegant in manner, refined, witty,
  brilliant, charming, she was by nature false and in that sense true, at least
  to herself.</p>

  <p>She had played with her own soul, settled her life beforehand, laid down
  the path she was to tread and pursued it unfalteringly, scattering smiles,
  tears, frowns and caresses to help her to her self-appointed goal&mdash;of
  riches, independence, titles and worldly honour.</p>

  <p>And so far she had passed along serene, her heart untouched; even to think
  of it moved to a passion out of her control, roused her laughter. In all her
  plans she reckoned without it, reckoned, too, without her passionate nature
  that had slept so long she did not know that it was there.</p>

  <p>No one had passed beyond her smiles, more than dainty caresses she had
  given none. She kept herself inviolate, yet she had lost her many throws and
  not yet won a fortune.</p>

  <p>Gilles of Brittany sincerely loved her. He was younger and, for all his
  high gaiety, more simple, than her former suitors; he had much of the ancient
  chivalry that never questioned a woman's word sworn to with kisses. She, too,
  with her twenty-seven years and her lost chances behind her, played more
  sanely now and lived more softly.</p>

  <p>Then, with the same breath with which Gilles told her their marriage was
  assured and sworn to by the Duke's word before all Brittany, he told her too
  he had undertaken a delicate mission to England, that might mean some weeks'
  absence. The heart of Françoise de Dinan sank. She judged him by
  herself&mdash;supposing he forgot!</p>

  <p>But in Gilles' mind was no doubt. His great love left no room for it. He
  trusted her as he did Heaven. He hoped much honour from this mission, and a
  rise in the Duke's favour, and they could spare a few weeks from a lifetime
  of happiness. He guessed nothing of her impatience to appear at the court of
  Rennes; how she shrank from the waiting weeks that might prelude another
  chance foregone. He took her dismay for grief at loss of him, and Françoise,
  when he spoke of it so, was moved to smile to herself, bitterly.</p>

  <p>It was an October evening, the day before Prince Gilles sailed, that
  Françoise came from the château of Hardouinaye to take a last leave of him.
  The sun was sinking in a twist of golden vapour, tinging the flat gray rocks
  with colour, burning like fire in the little pools left by the rains of
  yesterday.</p>

  <p>Beyond them the sea glinted, silver white. Françoise, shading her eyes
  from the level rays, looked down the road. The air was cold and from head to
  foot she was wrapped in a purple mantle; over her black hair was a hood that
  shadowed her fair face, a face that grew a little troubled as no one came
  down the straight road.</p>

  <p>Impatiently she walked about under the trees; the last leaves of autumn
  burned bright as jewels against a sky the colour of dead forget-me-nots;
  always as she paced was that slight fear at her heart that he might grow
  indifferent.</p>

  <p>But presently against the sun appeared the figures of two horsemen riding
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>One was Gilles of Brittany; she waved her hand gaily and came to meet him,
  glancing at his handsome face to see if any doubt of her lurked there. But
  with gay brown eyes he smiled on her and Françoise's heart rose&mdash;of a
  surety he loved her and she could never lose him. Now with every word he
  spoke he confirmed it, as, outdistancing the man he rode with, he leaped to
  the ground and told her all his hopes, and spoke of what the journey to
  England might mean to both of them. For a while she listened smiling.</p>

  <p>"But in England you will forget me," she said at last, and the fear in her
  voice was not all feigned&mdash;she found it hard to believe in sincere
  affection.</p>

  <p>"Françoise, <i>ma bien aimée</i>," laughed Gilles of Brittany. "When the
  stars fall shall I forget!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Gilles!" she cried, looking up at him. "I would you were not
  going!"</p>

  <p>"Now, why?" he answered smiling. "Only, Françoise, a few short weeks and
  my fortune may be made."</p>

  <p>"If Montauban were not ever at the Duke's ear," said Françoise, "you would
  not have to go abroad to seek your fortune and leave me thus long." And in
  her heart she thought that, once she was the Prince's wife, it should go hard
  with her if she did not manage to overthrow the powerful favourite.</p>

  <p>"Montauban is my one uneasiness," said Gilles tenderly, "yet he would
  never dare molest thee."</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon ami</i>, he will not even deign to see me," she answered. "Even
  now he stays with mine uncle at Chateaubriand while I am imprisoned
  here&mdash;oh, Gilles, the one thing I care for in my dull life you take from
  me&mdash;I pray you do not go!"</p>

  <p>The fear she could not lose put conviction into her voice; she clasped her
  delicate hands round his and her eyes were pleading.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" cried Gilles. "After all why should I? I am my own
  master, <i>ma chérie</i>. Now ask again and, by my faith, I will not go!"</p>

  <p>"You care so much?" she whispered, well pleased at this proof of her
  power.</p>

  <p>"Françoise," he answered eagerly. "For your sake I was going&mdash;I'll
  stay for the same reason, sweet, if you'll take me fortuneless; what care I
  for the Duke's displeasure?"</p>

  <p>But Françoise reflected what the Duke's displeasure meant and looked up
  with a sigh and a smile.</p>

  <p>"Gilles, this is only folly&mdash;because I love you so I Go, I would not
  have it otherwise&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Gilles stopped her with a kiss, taking her hands in his joyously.</p>

  <p>"We'll have no talk of that!" he laughed. "There are no oaths needed
  between us&mdash;Françoise, I ask none, I know you love me, <i>ma
  chérie</i>."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, enough," she answered. Her voice broke into a little sob, her
  eyes were full of tears. Gilles' frank heart was touched to the quick to see
  her grief; silent with her hand in his he sought for some comfort.</p>

  <p>"I shall not leave you utterly alone," he said at last. "I found a friend
  in France would give his life for aught of mine. He, Françoise, shall look to
  the sending me word if need be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I need it not," she answered. "Sure of thee I need no more."</p>

  <p>Then she knew not what drove her to it, but she took his hand and said:
  "Whatever happens, whatever befalls, will I be true, Gilles!"</p>

  <p>"Françoise," he whispered, "I would as soon doubt Heaven!"</p>

  <p>At his grave eagerness she almost feared, and turning her head sharply,
  noticed with relief that the Prince's companion advanced toward them.</p>

  <p>"'Tis my friend," said Gilles. "The Englishman. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! I hear he
  comes for me&mdash;now how can I ever use to you, <i>ma chérie</i>&mdash;the
  word 'farewell'?"</p>

  <p>Françoise smiled and answered softly, then drew her hands away and turned
  toward the newcomer who led the Prince's horse.</p>

  <p>"Now the good angels guard you, sweet," said Gilles with a catch in his
  throat. The rider was singing to himself. As he drew near he took his cap
  off, waiting, and Gilles led Françoise to his saddle bow.</p>

  <p>"Françoise," he said. "This is my true friend, Captain Kristopher
  Fassiferne, true friend he will be to you, if for my sake and his own worth
  you will accept his services."</p>

  <p>It had grown so dark that though she glanced curiously at the Englishman's
  face, it only struck her as she answered graciously that he was much older
  than Gilles and not the man she would have thought he would have chosen for a
  friend.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Captain Kristopher gravely, "there's a more powerful weapon
  than will be found in a soldier's armoury, an' that's in your possession
  already, my lady."</p>

  <p>"What, Messire?" she asked. The voice was low and pleasant, she strained
  her eyes the more clearly to see the face.</p>

  <p>"It's an honest, true heart, my lady," he answered. "An' a true faith an'
  love, so it's none of my help the Prince will be wanting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And he laughed as Gilles sprang into the saddle.</p>

  <p>The words galled her. As she drew back from Gilles' stirrup her gold scarf
  caught in the Englishman's and as he stooped to disentangle it, she, glancing
  up, saw that he had bright blue eyes and a laughing mouth. The laugh made her
  flush.</p>

  <p>A few moments more and they had gone; Françoise, standing alone, watched
  them go, still with a colour in her cheeks. She was strangely humbled in her
  vanity&mdash;it seemed to her the Englishman had read her like a book and
  laughed at her for her poor pretence.</p>

  <p>But she angrily shook off the fancy.</p>

  <p>"Had I been my uncle's heir," she thought bitterly, "I had had no need to
  cheat a boy into love for me." She went back to the château very swiftly.</p>

  <p>It rained heavily that night. Françoise, restless in her chamber, could
  not sleep for the sound of it beating on the stonework without her
  window.</p>

  <p>Discontented and weary, she lit a little lamp and stirring the embers of
  her fire together, sat over it, brooding.</p>

  <p>Though still dark it was near dawn. In a few hours Gilles would sail. "He
  is a mere simpleton," thought Françoise. "Could I have feigned affection to
  that friend of his so? <i>Dieu?</i> If I were rich&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off her thoughts abruptly, and turning her head looked at
  herself in the mirror that hung above the lamp; looked long and
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>She grew angry with herself, frowned at the shadow in the glass, calling
  it fool; then lay back in her chair sighing with a fair brooding face. She
  had chosen for herself and repentance was too late.</p>

  <p>She was bound to him before all Brittany.</p>

  <p>Outside the rain beat stronger, mingled with gusts of wind; the bare
  boughs creaked and groaned. The storm jarred on Françoise, she rose
  restlessly and began pacing the room.</p>

  <p>A sudden loud knocking at the château gates made her start violently.</p>

  <p>For a moment she stood still in absolute fear; thoughts of her powerful,
  lawless neighbour, the Lord of Dol, an outlawed robber, flashed into her
  mind. Hardouinaye was very lonely and this the dead of night.</p>

  <p>Throwing a cloak over her loosened dress she went out on the stairs, and,
  calling one of her women bade her go and bring the seneschal.</p>

  <p>But there was no need; the loud knocking had roused the whole
  establishment; consisting only of a few, for Françoise de Dinan was allowed
  no state.</p>

  <p>Carrying a lantern, struggling against the wind and the rain, the
  seneschal made his way to the gate where a little band of horsemen waited for
  admittance. Their leader demanded to see the chatelaine at once; he came, he
  said, from Chateaubriand, from her uncle, and would tell no more.</p>

  <p>From her uncle!</p>

  <p>Françoise heard in utter amazement, it was many weeks since she had had
  any message from her uncle, and she half suspected a ruse.</p>

  <p>For a moment she hesitated; then made a compromise between her prudence
  and her curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Admit the leader and keep him in sight," she said. "I will see him in the
  hall." With her heart beating fast she went back into her chamber and
  arranged her dress.</p>

  <p>What could her uncle have to say to her? Had his spite, or Philippe's,
  urged them to forbid her marriage?</p>

  <p>Then the strange hour moved her wonder almost to fear.</p>

  <p>With the purple mantle over her straight red gown, her black hair gathered
  away from her bare throat and flushed face, Françoise de Dinan descended into
  the hall, followed by her two women; her mind busy with a thousand
  fancies.</p>

  <p>The great chamber, dimly lit by hastily brought lights, looked blank and
  dreary; the seneschal and her few serving men were there and, standing by the
  ash-strewn hearth, a man who had put his dripping mantle on the chair beside
  him and was looking impatiently toward the entrance.</p>

  <p>In a certain excitement, a half fear, a half hope
  of&mdash;something&mdash;Françoise entered, her eagerness making her fair
  face more human, less calm than was its wont. The stranger came forward;
  appeared surprised, almost startled at her great beauty set off as it was by
  the soft light, the dark background and the quiet mystery of her
  surrounding.</p>

  <p>"I am Françoise de Dinan," she said, fully aware of the effect she
  produced and in no way abashed.</p>

  <p>Her great black eyes studied him, closely noting every detail. He was
  slight and slender; good-looking, of a pale face; hair and eyes as black as
  her own, but with a hard, sneering mouth. He was richly dressed; he carried
  sword and dagger by his side and twisted gloves and a riding whip in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What I have to say," he began, speaking in a very humble voice, more
  natural than assumed, "will be my best excuse for this sore lack of
  ceremony."</p>

  <p>"You come from Chateaubriand?" asked Françoise, "from my uncle?"</p>

  <p>"I have ridden straight from there, madam," he hesitated. "Perhaps by name
  I am not so unknown to you," he added, smiling. "I am Guy de Montauban."</p>

  <p>At mention of the most powerful name in Brittany, she could not conceal
  her utter surprise or find any words to answer him. For once in her life she
  was completely at a loss.</p>

  <p>"I am the friend of your betrothed," went on Montauban, smiling the more
  at her surprise. "And I come with grave news."</p>

  <p>As quickly as she had lost her self-possession she recovered it and came
  forward into the full lamplight.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my lord," she said, "whatever news you bring is for the bearer's
  sake, welcome."</p>

  <p>"There was not much love between you and your uncle?" asked Montauban,
  looking full at her with much admiration.</p>

  <p>Completely at her ease now, flattered and expectant, Françoise lifted her
  brilliant eyes and laughed.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! No!"</p>

  <p>For a second Montauban paused.</p>

  <p>"Robert de Dinan is dead," he said.</p>

  <p>In the perfect silence that followed he looked at her keenly; she had
  fallen back a step, very white, but her eyes were ablaze.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she whispered at last, "and Philippe?"</p>

  <p>Montauban's sombre face lit up.</p>

  <p>"Your discernment is excellent," he returned. "He too is dead. They were
  both drowned yesterday. I saw their boat sink with all on board. A pleasure
  sail on a lake&mdash;<i>morbleu</i>!&mdash;it has made you the richest woman
  in Brittany."</p>

  <p>The colour ebbed slowly back into Françoise's face, she looked with
  dancing eyes at the bewildered faces of the servants, then at Montauban.</p>

  <p>"Dead?" she murmured. "Both dead?"</p>

  <p>She had not believed there was anything under. Heaven could move her as
  this news had done; she trembled and had to catch at the tapestry for
  stealthy support; yet she was not one whit bewildered nor confused. In a
  second she saw it all too clearly, what it meant, what difference it made,
  saw, too, something of Montauban's purpose in bringing the news to her
  thus.</p>

  <p>"And Prince Gilles?" she asked, raising her eyes. "He does not know?"</p>

  <p>Montauban, always closely observing her, smiled and came a step
  nearer.</p>

  <p>"He has already embarked," he said. "This news must follow him,
  Countesse."</p>

  <p>"'Tis no matter," answered Françoise quickly. "'Tis a great matter that I
  should thank you and somewhat fittingly&mdash;for this your trouble," she
  added. So calm she was, he could only guess at her great excitement, at the
  deep joy she kept even from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Some day I may be so glad to call upon the gratitude of the Countesse de
  Chateaubriand," he answered, "as to wrong myself by calling to your mind such
  a service even as this&mdash;now I would pray you only to forgive an
  intrusion that has fallen so far below my respect&mdash;and also, Countesse,
  to remember me for so long as it may be till we meet at Rennes."</p>

  <p>"Messire, were it years hence I should not fail in that," said Françoise,
  with her eyes turned away to hide their exultation.</p>

  <p>Guy de Montauban passing from the sombre château, anew into the driving
  rain, found nothing but satisfaction in his knowledge.</p>

  <p>"I feared she might love the Prince," he thought. "There is no love. She
  shall marry me within a month."</p>

  <p>Shaken from his habitual indolence he reflected keenly on his chances and
  the means of bettering them. The result of his reflections was that, instead
  of riding to Rennes, he turned his horse toward the coast and started rapidly
  for the little port where Gilles was to have, or had, embarked.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II.&mdash;THE LANDS OF KOET KANDEK</h2>

  <p class="first">Gilles stood in the courtyard, watching with a thoughtful
  face the last bales of goods carried through the gate toward the calm sea,
  while he talked to Kristopher Fassiferne, who leaned against the wall beside
  him.</p>

  <p>Captain Kristopher was tall and well shaped, at first glance all thought
  him rarely handsome, but it was in expression and not in features that the
  claim lay. His real beauty was a pair of great blue eyes, dark and yet
  brilliantly changeful; for the rest he had a firm mouth and a clear freckled
  skin that flushed when he talked, face and neck so brown they made his bright
  eyes and teeth by contrast dazzling, the pleasantest of smiles and an eager
  frank look, a quiet manner; he looked and noticed more than he spoke, and
  laughed frequently.</p>

  <p>In age he might have been thirty-five or six, his dress was a well-worn
  and patched leather suit, a faded scarf, and there was not a single ornament
  about him, except a silver ring on his left hand.</p>

  <p>Gilles fell to pacing the courtyard with a puzzled, angry face.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon cher</i>," he said at last, stopping in front of the other. "The
  Sieur de Montauban dislikes me&mdash;ever since we came back from
  France&mdash;you and I&mdash;I've seen it still knowing how blindly François,
  my brother, trusts him. I was glad to think at first of this mission and
  escaping him a while&mdash;but&mdash;now&mdash;" Gilles crushed a paper in
  his hand with a laugh, "suddenly my heart misgives me."</p>

  <p>Kristopher Fassiferne was listening, but he made no answer, and the Prince
  continued, still doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> but&mdash;to leave him here&mdash;at my brother's
  ear."</p>

  <p>"And what can he say there?" asked Kristopher, suddenly looking up with
  brilliant smiling eyes. "Or do, my Prince? Isn't he just a thing to be taken
  no heed of&mdash;and aren't you above all the meddlings of favourites?"</p>

  <p>Gilles was silent, then a flush crept into his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of Françoise," he said with shining eyes. "She is so
  alone&mdash;and so beautiful! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! did you ever see such beauty,
  Kristopher, <i>mon ami</i>?"</p>

  <p>"It was so dark I could see nothing at all," answered Kristopher, tracing
  the cobbles with his sword point. "But were she just all the beauty that ever
  was&mdash;'tis no matter for the leaving of her an' she love you&mdash;an'
  what's six months, my Prince? an' she living alone an' not having even seen
  Sir Guy? It's trouble out of nothing you're making," and Kristopher looked
  up, showing his white teeth in a fascinating smile that Gilles'
  light-heartedness responded to at once.</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>, you are right, <i>mon ami</i>," he said, holding out his
  slender hand. "What is six months? And, praise be to St Herve, Françoise hath
  no riches that the Duke should want to break his promise&mdash;tell me now
  that you will look to her while I am away and I go happy."</p>

  <p>"There are better men for that service, Prince," answered Kristopher
  Fassiferne gravely. "An' better able to please you in it, since the lady
  needs no watching, and it isn't a captain of mercenaries would protect her
  from Sir Guy if he came along, with the Duke behind him."</p>

  <p>"Captain Kristopher," said the Prince eagerly, with wistful eyes, "you are
  the truest soul I ever knew&mdash;you are my only friend&mdash;there is none
  other I could trust&mdash;my brother, Pierre, is young yet&mdash;I will give
  you this letter to him&mdash;" He drew a paper from his pocket and forced it
  on the other, who stood silent looking at him.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I am foolish," he continued, with a little laugh. "What
  can happen to her? But undertake this charge, Captain Kristopher."</p>

  <p>"She hath guardians," was the reply. "Her uncle and her uncle's
  son&mdash;almost the richest men in Brittany."</p>

  <p>"They!" cried Gilles impatiently. "They live at
  Chateaubriand&mdash;keeping her close in Hardouinaye&mdash;and they are men
  she hath been sore angered with&mdash;but I will not ask this service of you
  since it is distasteful, Captain Kristopher, praying to God and his saints
  alone to watch over Françoise de Dinan."</p>

  <p>A squire came and touched him on the arm&mdash;the hour for his
  embarkation had come: the two great ships were laden, their sails spread; the
  wind was fair for England.</p>

  <p>"Fare thee well, Captain Kristopher," smiled Gilles and he held out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>The soldier raised his eyes and strode forward impulsively, clasping it
  warmly.</p>

  <p>"I will do what you wish," he said smiling.</p>

  <p>"Never a harm shall come to your lady, my Prince&mdash;aren't we comrades
  and sworn friends?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Kristopher!" cried Gilles, his whole face clearing. "Now is my
  mind at ease and with a light heart I leave&mdash;swear to me by our
  friendship you mean this."</p>

  <p>Kristopher Fassiferne laid his hand on the other's satin sleeve.</p>

  <p>"I swear it," he said simply. "And you can trust me I On my honour," he
  added, "you leave one behind who will not forget."</p>

  <p>Gilles of Brittany looked at him through the yellow hair and white
  feathers that were blown about his face.</p>

  <p>"I am content," he said. "Take you that letter, <i>mon ami</i>, to my
  brother, Pierre&mdash;you go to Rennes?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, to Rennes," and the soldier heaved something like a sigh. "To report
  myself, my Prince&mdash;and to take my commands from his Grace."</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>!" cried Gilles eagerly. "Had I half the influence Guy de
  Montauban has&mdash;you would be in a different position, <i>mon
  cher</i>&mdash;but go you to Pierre with that letter and remember Françoise
  knows you saved my life twice and that I love you&mdash;and if need
  be&mdash;remember your promise, Captain Kristopher."</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on his friend's shoulder: "Wish me success, <i>mon
  ami</i>," he smiled, "for in truth, I am more than a little
  faint-hearted."</p>

  <p>"Three times success," answered Kristopher. "And I have pledged my honour
  to look to the lady&mdash;though she wants no looking to&mdash;with a true
  heart and no riches to tempt the Duke&mdash;now, rest you easy, my
  Prince&mdash;for I've sworn."</p>

  <p>The mist began to part and roll away, the standard of Brittany showed
  faintly at the mast of the ship in the offing.</p>

  <p>"Blowing for England," said Kristopher, with a quick breath on the name.
  "God give you three times success, my Prince&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gilles grasped his hand in silence, with smiling eyes; in a moment more he
  had embarked. Standing silent, Captain Kristopher watched him enter the boat
  and near the ship&mdash;watched him on the deck, standing on the prow above
  the gold dragon. Then suddenly the breeze freshened, lifting the clouds like
  a veil, the great sails filled and the two ships began to move, long oar's
  splashed up wreaths of spray and scattered the sea birds till they rose and
  flew screaming round the masts and cordage. Gilles, waving his orange scarf,
  stood with uncovered head, a gallant figure&mdash;at the prow.</p>

  <p>Kristopher's eyes never left it till the ships were lost in the gray sea
  mist, then he turned and went up the beach to where at a little distance some
  fifty men at arms were drawn up, English mercenaries under his command, newly
  returned from France and bound now with him for Rennes.</p>

  <p>Captain Kristopher mounted his black horse.</p>

  <p>"An' we get to Rennes to-night," he said, "we must be starting on the
  minute&mdash;give me my helmet, Robin, for we shall be riding through Koet
  Kandek&mdash;a very nest of robbers."</p>

  <p>Then he turned to his men who waited wrapped in their cloaks.</p>

  <p>"Now for Rennes," he said. "'Tis the long road&mdash;" He paused abruptly;
  a little group of horsemen were spurring rapidly over the short grass toward
  them&mdash;some ten or twelve with a tall knight leading.</p>

  <p>"Now, who are these?" asked Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Before there was time for an answer, the leader of the newcomers hid
  galloped up and reined in his horse.</p>

  <p>"Gilles of Brittany hath sailed?" he asked, looking past Kristopher out to
  sea, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sailed and out of sight," was the answer. The other's dark face lit
  up; he halted and looked at Kristopher.</p>

  <p>"You ride back to Rennes?" he asked, speaking as one used to command.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Kristopher, his blue eyes taking him in, keenly.</p>

  <p>"I go that way, too," said the horseman. "I but came to see if the Prince
  had sailed. My name is Guy de Montauban."</p>

  <p>He gave it with a pride amounting to arrogance; but Kristopher only
  inclined gravely his head.</p>

  <p>"Are you not he whom they call Captain Kristopher," continued Guy, "and
  Gilles' friend?"</p>

  <p>"I am he," answered Kristopher. "Captain Kristopher Fassiferne of the
  English mercenaries&mdash;will it please you, Sieur, if you come my way, we
  should ride on?&mdash;it grows late."</p>

  <p>He spoke with a grave courtesy at variance with his rough dress and the
  rougher men he led; Montauban noticing it, looked at him, and, like everyone,
  was so struck with the fascination of his face as to keep his eyes there;
  when Kristopher, giving the signal to his men, was falling back to the head
  of them, he stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Ride by me," he said. "I have to talk with you."</p>

  <p>For a way the road ran along the sea like a white ribbon, fringed either
  side with salt-dried, shaking grass and scattered with dead sea weed, ancient
  and colourless, that crackled beneath the horses' hoofs.</p>

  <p>"You were with the Prince in France?" asked Guy and he looked at his
  companion furtively. "He trusts you, Messire?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher laughed, glancing round. "What are you wanting to find out, Sir
  Guy?" he said. "Isn't this a clumsy way of beginning? An' well may you save
  your pains, for half I know and half I guess."</p>

  <p>Montauban stared at him with a faint flush on his thin face.</p>

  <p>"What do you know?"</p>

  <p>The road was rough and Kristopher stopped to tighten his reins before he
  answered. When he looked up the laugh had gone from his face.</p>

  <p>"I know you have somewhat against the Prince," he said with angry
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Guy did not answer and for some way they rode in silence, through the
  lands of Koet Kandek&mdash;desolate, forlorn, with no sign of living plant or
  flower to right or left.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Guy turned to his companion: "Seeing you are his friend, the
  Prince bath not done much for you," he said. "Leaving you still leader of
  hired soldiers&mdash;find you fortune slow in coming, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Fortune?" said Kristopher, speaking as if roused from thoughts of other
  things. "That, Messire, I have long given up the seeking of, and it's a save
  of heartache!"</p>

  <p>"A soldier without ambition!" said Montauban. "What use is your sword if
  not as a lever to rise with?"</p>

  <p>"It earns me bread," said Kristopher, with defiant eyes. "It gets me a
  living and keeps me from sinking to some valet's place&mdash;it's a leader of
  mercenaries you're talking to, Sir Guy, an' no knight errant, and it's just
  for the living I get, I serve, and not for glory."</p>

  <p>Guy glanced at him furtively.</p>

  <p>"Lord Verdun of Valence," he said softly. "Is all your ambition quite
  dead?"</p>

  <p>"St George!" cried Kristopher, and his clear skin flushed scarlet. "You
  know that?"</p>

  <p>"That and more," was the answer. "I know why you keep your name hid, Lord
  Verdun, and why you ride here now, a hired soldier."</p>

  <p>The colour faded from Kristopher's face.</p>

  <p>"How came you to know?" he said, staring at Guy, who leaned nearer.</p>

  <p>"I met one who knew you at the court of England, when you were high in
  power," he answered, keeping his eyes on the other. "Before&mdash;you were
  banished."</p>

  <p>Kristopher's face showed white as linen in the dusk. He laughed
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" questioned Guy, as if astonished. "You are he who was
  banished from England as a traitor&mdash;for selling your country to the
  French&mdash;five years ago?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher clinched his hands tight upon his bridle and kept his gaze
  fixed before him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "It's true. I am he."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Guy triumphantly. "I will give you back the place that you
  have lost, Lord Verdun."</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned fiercely with flaming eyes.</p>

  <p>"That name's dead," he said, "and on all this earth there is no man can
  give me back what I have lost."</p>

  <p>"Leave the name then," said Guy easily. "Listen to me, Captain
  Kristopher."</p>

  <p>"I am Prince Gilles' friend," cried Kristopher, "and I will hear naught
  against him."</p>

  <p>"Is your honour grown so nice of late?" asked Guy calmly. "You sold your
  country&mdash;couldn't you sell your friend, Captain Kristopher?"</p>

  <p>"Dear Lord!" said Kristopher under his breath through set teeth; then he
  was silent and Montauban spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Gilles leaves his betrothed behind," said Guy de Montauban, "fair and
  penniless&mdash;Françoise de Dinan&mdash;a heartless lady and an ambitious,
  who cares for him no more than she would for any man who brought her
  rank&mdash;are you listening?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher was silent, motionless, looking in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Françoise de Dinan will be my wife," continued Guy. "And Gilles stays in
  England till she is wedded."</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned as if about to break out passionately but still remained
  silent.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to hinder me," continued Guy. "I can do anything with
  the Duke&mdash;easily enough will he take back his promise."</p>

  <p>"And the lady?" said Kristopher hoarsely. "The lady?"</p>

  <p>"Cares nothing for anyone&mdash;and now&mdash;is the richest heiress in
  Brittany or France."</p>

  <p>Kristopher stared blankly.</p>

  <p>"Robert de Dinan is dead," whispered Guy, in an excitement he could not
  repress. "And his son&mdash;I was at Chateaubriand, the Sieur de Dinan and
  his son were drowned&mdash;gone down in a storm&mdash;all were lost and among
  them these two&mdash;the lords of Dinan&mdash;and so Gilles' betrothed is the
  richest marriage in France. You see now, Captain Kristopher?"</p>

  <p>"I see," answered Kristopher, without turning his head. "God help Prince
  Gilles!"</p>

  <p>"<i>You help me</i>, Captain Kristopher," said Guy, and he put out his
  thin hand, touching the other's arm. "Help me win the lady and her fortune,
  help me keep Gilles in England&mdash;and Lord Verdun of Valence may make his
  fortune yet."</p>

  <p>Kristopher shuddered, looking steadily in front of him.</p>

  <p>"You have no scruples?" asked Montauban, scornful at sight of the other's
  face. "A man who betrayed his country may well betray his friend&mdash;what
  did the French pay you? I will double it, Captain Kristopher."</p>

  <p>Kristopher shook him off passionately.</p>

  <p>"Get you gone, Sieur," he said, with wild wide-open eyes. "I will ride to
  Rennes alone, not in the company of such as you&mdash;get you gone!"</p>

  <p>It was raining fast, a blinding drizzle; Guy drew his cloak closer round
  him with an angry laugh.</p>

  <p>"I am Guy de Montauban," he said. "These words come ill from an
  outcast!"</p>

  <p>At this Kristopher looked him straight in the eyes, then he laughed, so
  suddenly that Guy was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I will give you others then," he flashed. "You're a poor, mean knave,
  Sieur, and not worth the snap of an honest man's fingers, and Gilles left me
  in charge of the lady&mdash;and she'll be true for all that it's you are the
  Duke's favourite&mdash;an outcast, say you?&mdash;I' faith, you talk of what
  you know nothing of&mdash;there never was a Verdun yet who smirched his name,
  an' given I'm the last of them there never will be."</p>

  <p>Kristopher had a pleasant and soft way of speaking, a certain charm of
  words and voice that fascinated; that fascinated Guy now, spite of the fire
  and anger in Kristopher's tones.</p>

  <p>He looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"You have a tongue should have kept you your position," he said, "and an
  insolence I will remember at a more fitting time. Throw aside your chance as
  you will! I will wed the lady without you."</p>

  <p>"Never," said Kristopher fiercely. "Never as I live! It's the Prince
  himself trusted me."</p>

  <p>"Which is the greater fool&mdash;the Prince or you?" sneered Guy. "The
  Prince who thinks Françoise de Dinan loves him and makes a friendship with
  such as you&mdash;or you&mdash;to talk to me&mdash;like this?"</p>

  <p>But Kristopher was suddenly swaying on his saddle, in a perfect frenzy of
  fury, and Montauban drew back from the bared recklessness of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Fool, say you, Sieur!" he cried. "Sure you're the fool&mdash;and a mean,
  pitiable fool, an' might a gentleman soil his hands a-breaking your neck it's
  I would do it&mdash;you, a carrier of scandal and a picker up of lies,
  getting great by another man's favour&mdash;proud blood I come of&mdash;an'
  never yet did I pledge my honour for nothing&mdash;and I pledged it to Prince
  Gilles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You!" interrupted Guy, white with rage. "Your honour!"</p>

  <p>"And has never an innocent man been banished before this?" flashed
  Kristopher. "Look at me and say I was a traitor!"</p>

  <p>"It is your trade to lie and show a frank face," said Montauban,
  scornfully. He drew a whistle from his belt. "You think more is to be made by
  the Prince than by me," he added. "Fool, I have all Brittany behind
  me&mdash;in a month Françoise de Dinan will be my wife."</p>

  <p>"Not in a year&mdash;or thrice three years," said Kristopher proudly. "An'
  thanking God I'll be for a woman's true heart that'll defeat your plots and
  your guiles."</p>

  <p>Montauban laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe her heart will change with her fortunes&mdash;maybe she will forget
  Prince Gilles."</p>

  <p>"And I will remind her," said Kristopher. "Were to-morrow the blessed
  judgment day tonight I'd spend in the Prince's service."</p>

  <p>They had gained a little clearing of crumbling earth through which a
  sunken stream ran muddily, the banks were grown with strange weeds of sickly
  hues and fungi of unwholesome tints, poisonously brilliant. Until now both
  leaders had been too angrily absorbed to heed their way, but Guy blew his
  whistle and summoned up his men.</p>

  <p>"My thanks for the lifting of your company," said Kristopher and his eyes
  showed like jewels in his flushed face. "Pleasanter the road will be without
  a knave's converse." Then he laughed, showing his white teeth. "I' faith,
  little you gained that time, like the Devil in the fairy tale, you went
  a-fishing with a broken net and it's not the fish will cry over
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And Kristopher Fassiferne laughed again, and cantered back to his own
  band, leaving Guy looking after him through the rain and the gathering
  dark.</p>

  <p>At a steady pace the fifty mercenaries turned on the road to Rennes; all
  the laugh had gone from their leader's face. He crushed his gloves together
  in his hands and shuddered violently, looking ahead with straining eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sweet St Kate!" he murmured once, "have pity on me!" Then again with a
  little gasp, "Sweet Lord&mdash;help me!"</p>

  <p>It rained steadily, incessantly: men and horses were soaked through, the
  water was running off Kristopher's cap and streaming down his faded scarlet
  cloak&mdash;to right and left&mdash;before and
  behind&mdash;gray&mdash;nothing but gray&mdash;Montauban was quickly lost to
  sight, not a bird or a flower&mdash;nothing but weeds, dead and wet, straight
  and spiked, and broken boughs, bare trees, and flat dull blue rocks&mdash;and
  ahead, to the side of the road a great wood, dense even now, though the trees
  were leafless. At a gallop they were sweeping past, when Kristopher reined up
  his horse suddenly, and his followers stopped&mdash;fearfully.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" said Captain Kristopher.</p>

  <p>The men listened in a strained silence.</p>

  <p>Only the drip of the rain and the pant of the streaming horses.</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned in the saddle and looked toward the dark forest, rising
  lonesome and eerie with a white ribbon of a road twisting into it.</p>

  <p>"'Twas nothing," said Robin.</p>

  <p>"Hush," said Kristopher.</p>

  <p>From the direction of the wood came a long, low cry rising slowly and
  dying away.</p>

  <p>"Is it a human voice?" asked Kristopher.</p>

  <p>"Dear Lord! No!" cried Robin, crossing himself. "'Tis the ghost of the
  unblessed!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the cry was repeated, and Kristopher flung himself from his
  horse.</p>

  <p>"It is some one in distress!" he said, "an' a woman!"</p>

  <p>Shrill it came again through the damp evening air. It was nearly dark and
  the men looked askance at the dim trees and the lone path through them, but
  Kristopher ran swiftly toward the wood and entered it. Presently the long,
  low wail rose again now&mdash;and Kristopher turned to motion his men up,
  only to find he could no longer see them. The undergrowth was dense and thick
  and for a moment he stood irresolute&mdash;then at another sound&mdash;the
  low baying of dogs, plunged through the dead leaves and suddenly found
  himself on a well-worn road, evidently running straight through the
  forest.</p>

  <p>And down it came a single horseman followed by a pack of white dogs,
  glimmering, visible.</p>

  <p>Kristopher, hidden in the dead foliage and the trunks, paused, half
  believing he looked on something unearthly.</p>

  <p>But there came laughter and voices that were very human, as the cry he had
  heard was answered, and other horses and riders came through the trees, as if
  meeting and welcoming the first-comer.</p>

  <p>Some of the advancing party carried lanterns, among them was a woman who
  rode first, next to the horseman Who led the dogs.</p>

  <p>Her lantern showed a striped orange cloak and a sharp pretty face that
  teased Kristopher with a sense of being familiar; she was talking to her
  companion, who wiped his sword and laughed.</p>

  <p>As they came nearer, Kristopher saw his face thrown up in the circle of
  the lantern light, a handsome, indolent face, the handsomest and most
  unpleasant he thought he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>He was near a giant in size, this rider, but his face was framed in long
  curls like a woman's, and he wore not armour, but velvet and jewels.</p>

  <p>As Kristopher gazed they swept past him, riding faster, but though they
  were gone quickly he caught the name the woman gave her companion when she
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"Enguerrand."</p>

  <p>At their heels the dogs hurried, and a few men, fierce, ill-clad, then the
  forest swallowed them up again and Kristopher stood alone, cursing himself
  for the utter folly of dashing away from his men.</p>

  <p>He made no doubt they were wandering robbers or pillaging soldiers,
  returning to one of the vast châteaux thereabouts, and, as he pushed on
  resolutely down the well-worn paths, would have banished them from his
  thoughts, had not the woman's face haunted him, still with that sense of a
  likeness to some other face.</p>

  <p>There was no hope of finding his men that night. Kristopher, grown weary,
  hardly cared, they would find their way to Rennes alone as he must.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the road grew wider and stopped before a cluster of houses. In a
  moment more Kristopher could distinguish a sign hanging from the nearest, and
  making his way to the door knocked on it loudly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III.&mdash;VALERIE ESTERCEL</h2>

  <p class="first">The door opened instantly. Yes, the place was an inn, the
  fat-faced Breton admitted, and this the village of Kormenk, some miles from
  the Rennes road.</p>

  <p>"It's I will stay here to-night then," said Kristopher, and threw his wet
  cloak on the narrow bench in the hall.</p>

  <p>With slow movements the man locked and bolted the door, then raised the
  lantern from the floor.</p>

  <p>"St Kate, but I am wet and weary," sighed Kristopher.</p>

  <p>The peasant muttered something under his breath, and opened a little door
  to his right.</p>

  <p>Kristopher stepped in gladly; wringing the water from his cloak he went
  into the light, closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The room was low, with great rafters and one window; the whole dimly lit
  and filled with the melody of old-world music, as faint as the perfume of
  dead flowers.</p>

  <p>The musician sat with his back to the door, a slender, erect figure in
  blue velvet, playing a strange little lilting measure that seemed to bring
  shadowy shapes out of the dim corners to dance, the music of fairyland.
  Standing at the door, Kristopher looked at him&mdash;silent and startled.</p>

  <p>The room had one other occupant, some one crouched in the great chair by
  the smouldering logs, the face buried in the hands. Neither moved at
  Kristopher's entrance, and he glanced with continued astonishment at the
  elegant player in blue, swaying slightly to and fro to the lilt of the tune,
  unheeding, and he remained silent, for the music lay like a charm over the
  old chamber. A soft light just touched some carved goblets on the table, and
  made them blink as if they were dancing; near them, in the shadow lay two
  swords, and close by a soiled, torn shoe, a lady's shoe, muddied and frayed,
  but once gold and white, not laid carelessly, but with a certain grace of
  arrangement, in keeping with the quaint measure, the little slender figure of
  the musician, the rapid movement of his delicate hands over the ivory keys,
  and the outlines of that other figure, huddled together in the faded crimson
  chair, motionless, with little fingers clutched in pale yellow curls.</p>

  <p>It was all under a charm, as far removed from the wet forest and dark
  night as if it lay in another world, unreal and fantastic as a legend.</p>

  <p>"Good even," said Kristopher suddenly, and coming forward he flung his wet
  gloves on the table.</p>

  <p>Like a delicate picture in frost, shattered by a blow of a sword, the
  spell was broken. The musician stopped and turned with a reproachful face,
  the shadows danced away, Kristopher walked to the fireplace and with his foot
  stirred the logs into a blaze so that a strong red flare sprang up, lighting
  the farthest corner of the room, dispelling the last traces of the romance
  and mystery.</p>

  <p>Kristopher began drying his wet clothes, looking et the other two, keenly,
  with smiling blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good even," said the musician gravely, in a French that was not of
  Brittany, and he swung round on his seat to face the stranger.</p>

  <p>He had a pointed face, with light yellow hair brushed out round it like a
  halo, and full lips that wore an expression of scorn.</p>

  <p>Kristopher glanced from him to the other who by now sat up in the great
  chair staring.</p>

  <p>In every form and feature the two were alike, as delicate as china, as
  small as children, French evidently, and of some station. Kristopher smiled
  tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"I am English," he said. "Maybe you go to Rennes&mdash;Messires?"</p>

  <p>He in the blue stepped from his bright stool, looking with some contempt
  at the other in the chair.</p>

  <p>"I travel back to France, Monsieur," he said gravely, and his light-blue
  eyes were angry, though his voice was quiet.</p>

  <p>"And I," cried the other excitedly, "I travel on&mdash;on&mdash;" he flung
  his head up proudly. "Even if alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Valerie, you will return with me," said his counter-part, speaking with
  much gesture. "<i>Morbleu</i>! and all the Holy Saints, but I am weary of
  it!" Then turning to Kristopher, who watched them amused. "Monsieur, he is
  mad, my brother here, we might be at the fairest court in Europe, instead of
  in this vile inn, were it not for his folly. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! Mad! and I mad
  to permit it, but&mdash;Monsieur&mdash;bear me witness&mdash;this is the
  end!"</p>

  <p>The brother had sunk into the chair again in an attitude of despair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Amedée, Amedée, you will not forsake me&mdash;my brother
  Amedée&mdash;after so long&mdash;and me so near to goal!"</p>

  <p>Amedée whirled on his heel:</p>

  <p>"I have humoured thy madness long enough. An' thou will go, Valerie, go
  alone."</p>

  <p>Valerie looked up at Kristopher, standing with smiling blue eyes, large
  and silent by the fire.</p>

  <p>"I must be cooking my supper, it was morning when I last ate, and then it
  was but a sorry meal," he said, and drew up closer to the blaze, undoing his
  wallet calmly with a total disregard of the glances of the other two, who
  seemed to be forgetting their quarrels in observing him.</p>

  <p>Presently the captain opened the door and looked out into the dark
  passage.</p>

  <p>"A pot," he called, "and a bottle of wine." Then he returned to his
  cookery and his red cloak steaming over the chair.</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>!" murmured Valerie Estercel, shrinking away to the other
  end of the room, where he and his brother fell arguing anew in lowered
  tones.</p>

  <p>The landlord entered, clapping down an iron frying-pan and a stone bottle
  of wine.</p>

  <p>Kristopher seized them with a pleasant smile.</p>

  <p>"Save our souls!" he cried, "but it's wet and cold outside&mdash;" he
  stopped and looked around.</p>

  <p>"Who is Enguerrand?"</p>

  <p>The peasant had shuffled to the door, he paused there, looking back.</p>

  <p>"Enguerrand is La Rose Rouge," he said, and laughed hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"And who&mdash;" said Kristopher, "is La Rose Rouge?"</p>

  <p>But the man had gone, and Kristopher fell to his cooking, listening amused
  to the Frenchmen, who were talking in high, thin, excited voices.</p>

  <p>Amedée had drawn himself up to his full height, with many scornful glances
  at his brother: "A strolling player!" he cried. "A dancing woman!"</p>

  <p>"The lady I love!" flashed Valerie. "The lady I have sworn to adore till
  death. Monsieur&mdash;" he turned excitedly to Kristopher, "I have vowed to
  find her&mdash;her image is graven in my heart&mdash;more fair is she than
  dawning day&mdash;all the love in Ovid cannot express my passion!"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" cried his brother, interrupting angrily, "thou hast seen her
  once&mdash;from a distance, Valerie, and we have sought for her for a year
  and a half&mdash;Valerie&mdash;I have no more to say, I start at daybreak for
  France&mdash;knight-errantry may go too far&mdash;and fantasy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a flourish he clapped his feathered cap upon his head, and bowing
  low, strode from the room, his head high, his face flushed with indignation
  and resolve.</p>

  <p>Kristopher, eating his supper, had given them only half his attention, but
  he looked up amused at Amedée's sudden exit and glanced with something like
  pity at the other who, after standing with an air of mighty resolution, took
  one of the swords from the table.</p>

  <p>"I have sworn to Our Lady, the pheasant and the peacock," he said, his
  eyes large and eager, his face pale with excitement, "that I will go upon
  this quest I am vowed to&mdash;facing all the ill that may offer for one more
  sight of her! I will go alone&mdash;Amedée shall return to France&mdash;I
  have chosen."</p>

  <p>There was an air of great bravery about him, a defiance as of a man facing
  a great misfortune.</p>

  <p>Kristopher looked up from his plate and held out his hand with a sudden
  pleasant laugh'.</p>

  <p>"If I can aid you, Sieur, I travel to Rennes&mdash;Captain Kristopher, of
  the English mercenaries&mdash;perchance your quest may lead you that
  way."</p>

  <p>Valerie grasped his hand.</p>

  <p>"Do not think I feel fear or doubt, do not dream I falter or that my
  footsteps turn aside&mdash;to Our Lady I have sworn. Monsieur&mdash;could you
  go on&mdash;even if you had lost your comrade? Wonder not I ask you,
  Monsieur, seeing I am forsaken." And he clasped his jewelled hands to his
  forehead, staring with a white face at Kristopher, who answered instantly,
  lifting his brilliant eyes:</p>

  <p>"I would be going alone," he said, "had I sworn it&mdash;save our
  souls&mdash;an' all the world turned their backs!"</p>

  <p>The little French stranger seemed to dilate with delight.</p>

  <p>"Would you! would you!" he cried. "Oh. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! so will I,
  Monsieur! Monsieur! I love her so&mdash;into my heart no doubt can enter
  while that great love is there!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher looked up at him in amusement.</p>

  <p>"I' faith, you're a very knight of romance," he said. And he fell to his
  supper again, calmly, till Sir Valerie seized his hand between his two
  slender ones and put it to his lips passionately.</p>

  <p>"Sure, it's none too much sense the good saints blessed you with," said
  Kristopher amazed.</p>

  <p>Valerie fell again to fondling the shoe, murmuring to himself, and
  Kristopher began clearing away his supper, stifling yawns.</p>

  <p>"Her slipper! <i>Mon Dieu</i>, her slipper!" And the small, frayed, white
  thing, hung with broken bells, was pressed close to Valerie's heart.</p>

  <p>"St Kate!" groaned Kristopher. "But rain will make a man's bones ache,
  also a sitting horseback all day, an' a being sick with passion."</p>

  <p>He laid his head against the back of his chair, stretching out his legs to
  the fire, while Valerie, clasping the shoe, was gazing upward, with parted
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Yea, it must be I shall find her I soon, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! soon!"</p>

  <p>"An' I am wondering what you're going to do then," murmured Kristopher
  sleepily.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;ah, then&mdash;all my life will be golden light. I shall
  return to France with her. Oh, my lady! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! the sweetest lady on
  earth!"</p>

  <p>"We're wanting another log," said Kristopher, suddenly noticing the fire
  was low, "an' you might be getting it, Sir Valerie." And he yawned again,
  blinking at the other with sleepy blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Valerie flung himself on the bench opposite, unheeding, and leaned forward
  with eager, clasped hands and excited face, his breast heaving under his
  scarlet doublet.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur! listen to me&mdash;I will tell you
  all&mdash;everything&mdash;Monsieur&mdash;all! It was June, two years
  ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher roused himself.</p>

  <p>"I will be getting the log," he said, rising, but the little Frenchman
  entreated him back to his seat with a gesture he could not disregard.</p>

  <p>"We were riding back from the tourney at Paris," resumed Sir Valerie.
  "Amedée and I&mdash;Amedée and Valerie Estercel of Lorraine, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>His pale, blue eyes sought Kristopher's an instant, then travelled back to
  the fire.</p>

  <p>"It was evening, M'sieur&mdash;just the clear, pale light before the
  dusk&mdash;the long, white road seemed a path to love and glory. Amedée
  carried a silver and crimson pennon on his lance&mdash;won at the
  tourney&mdash;and ahead of us I saw two mules&mdash;two women muffled to the
  chin riding them&mdash;Ah! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! It was the hour of all my life!
  the great, pure sky throbbed like my heart in swift beats&mdash;all earthly
  care fell from me&mdash;I became as one winged, uplifted. The mules
  disappeared down the hill, but I was after them&mdash;my lips
  smiling&mdash;my heart laughing&mdash;uplifted&mdash;exalted&mdash;till I
  felt myself treading on clouds and stars. I gained the hilltop and saw them
  still ahead&mdash;pausing outside the houses of a little village&mdash;a
  golden village in a silver calm. With winged feet and a heart afire I hurried
  on&mdash;the perfume of the cool, fresh air became mingled with faintest
  music&mdash;music to tear the heartstrings&mdash;she on the dark mule
  played&mdash;she on the white one&mdash;sang!"</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel paused, his hands clasping and unclasping. Kristopher,
  leaning back in his chair, was silent.</p>

  <p>"She sang! I could not speak or cry&mdash;I drew nearer softly and
  watched&mdash;she sang in English&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! in liquid music!
  Little else have I seen since, little else till death shall I see but that
  figure, stirring lightly as a flower petal&mdash;" He stopped suddenly,
  choking with emotion, and bowed his head on his hands.</p>

  <p>"I stood entranced&mdash;enchanted. Amedée found me there like one turned
  to stone&mdash;and they&mdash;they had gone! Oh, my beautiful queen&mdash;oh,
  my heart's goddess&mdash;ever since have I followed you&mdash;and ever will!
  Once in Normandy did I see her&mdash;so hastily she fled that I picked up her
  shoe&mdash;only two days ago I saw her again&mdash;Oh, belle amie I Oh, my
  soul's desire!"</p>

  <p>The infantile voice rose and fell as if labouring with a passion of tears,
  he clasped his slender fingers over his heart, bending forward in the faint
  firelight.</p>

  <p>"Ah I my poor heart! It is sore with waiting&mdash;But one day I shall see
  and hear her again. Monsieur, assure me you believe so also!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. Kristopher lay back, his handsome head on the worn
  velvet of the chair, his dark lashes on his flushed cheek&mdash;he was
  asleep.</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>!" cried Valerie angrily, "a coarse churl!"</p>

  <p>The blue eyes opened, looking at him, dazed.</p>

  <p>Valerie stamped.</p>

  <p>"I was telling thee of my lady I My quest!" lie cried, flushing
  scarlet.</p>

  <p>Kristopher's head fell back, his breast rising with his even
  breathing&mdash;and Sir Valerie turned away in despair.</p>

  <p>At the door he looked back. Captain Kristopher was fast asleep, the
  firelight caught the silver ring he wore and the tarnished buttons of his
  <i>côte-hardie</i>. He was certainly fast asleep; with a sigh Valerie went
  out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV.&mdash;THE DANCING GIRL</h2>

  <p class="first">It was the first hour of the next dawn, a fair morning that
  held the promise of one of those perfect autumn days, slipped, as a rose into
  the pages of a dusty book, between the wet, gray weeks.</p>

  <p>A white light lay over the wide, low landscape, mellowing the bare, wet
  trees, transfiguring the forlorn weeds and flowers, and, tinted like a great
  shell, flushed and pure, the sky was reflected in many still pools, that the
  breeze was not strong enough to ruffle.</p>

  <p>Kristopher Fassiferne, standing at the door of the old inn, was conscious
  of a great peace in the infinite calmness of the sky, the sense of largeness
  and space, the freedom of that gray country rolling to the horizon.</p>

  <p>Behind him were the sounds of footsteps, and the jingle of a horse's
  bridle, the low patter of a dog's feet and some one speaking French
  softly.</p>

  <p>And presently Amedée Estercel rode out of the court-yard, his dog and
  squire beside him.</p>

  <p>Kristopher, saluting, watched till the figure was lost in the distance,
  then turned into the inn.</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel was there, torn between grief at his brother's departure
  and the one fixed thought to find the idol of his quest. Kristopher's comfort
  (though given as if humouring a child) called forth passionate gratitude and
  praises of his lady in high fantastical terms, which his listener forgot as
  soon as they were uttered.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the two were on the road, and before midday had parted
  at the gates of Rennes, Kristopher to the fort above the gates where he was
  quartered, Valerie Estercel to the inn: "The Sign of the Rising Sun."</p>

  <p>Disheartened at his brother's desertion, forlornly eager on his search,
  Valerie, as soon as his horse was stabled, wandered out beyond the walls of
  Rennes, aimlessly, too full of his thoughts to heed how far he went, or
  whither he bent his way. Several people passed him on the road, merchants,
  soldiers, travellers; in particular he noticed a knight, a lady and their
  servant, noticed them because the lady's face, angry and tear-stained,
  reminded him of the dancing girl he sought.</p>

  <p>And when the knight drew rein, asked him something of the direction of the
  road and the inns in Rennes, he answered with his eyes upon the lady,
  courteously as was his wont, his chivalrous heart touched by her seeming
  trouble.</p>

  <p>He told them of "The Sign of the Rising Sun" and was rewarded with a smile
  from the lady, who, lifting her weary eyes to his, told him gently they came
  travelling from the coast of France, and as they rode away and he turned with
  another smile to hope that they might meet again in Rennes, as she drew her
  orange mantle round her with the air of a great dame, yet smiled again
  beneath discreetly lowered lids.</p>

  <p>"A successor to Enguerrand, think you?" asked the knight of the lady as
  they rode on; he made a gesture of gloomy scorn toward Valerie Estercel. "Has
  he money, think you, Denise? Judging by his face he has little wit."</p>

  <p>The lady turned furious eyes on him. "We have quarrelled with
  Enguerrand&mdash;<i>your</i> fault, my brother," she said stormily. "Will it
  please you not to speak of him? As for this man we have met, we have need of
  any who will speak to us&mdash;fool or knave."</p>

  <p>"La Rose Rouge has left you sore," remarked her brother. "But 'tis I
  should be the one angered at you who had so little hold on him that at the
  first difference he cast us off like dogs!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, silence!" cried the lady passionately. "Have we not lived on him, the
  three of us for months, do we not carry away gold enough? And&mdash;you to
  talk! What had you ever gained from La Rose Rouge without my face to catch
  his fancy?"</p>

  <p>The brother shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go to the inn of our gentleman's advising, Denise?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded angrily, and lapsing into silence they passed through the gates
  of Rennes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Valerie Estercel, still walking slowly onward along the great
  road, was suddenly aware of two figures approaching. Two women in gray cloaks
  mounted on little palfreys. One was the dancing girl.</p>

  <p>As they drew nearer and the first vague tremor of a doubt was confirmed
  into a certainty, the Chevalier stood still and dumb.</p>

  <p>It was she&mdash;she at last, the lady of his dreams, she round whom all
  his fantastic devotion clustered, it <i>was</i> the dancing girl.</p>

  <p>She came on unsuspecting, talking to her companion. The little Frenchman
  could neither speak nor move.</p>

  <p>It seemed almost as if they might pass each other. He could find no words,
  but if he could only step forward and let his eyes rest upon her!&mdash;There
  seemed no need of speech. He turned toward her.</p>

  <p>Then, glancing round she saw him and drew up her palfrey with fear and
  some anger in her look.</p>

  <p>"The mad Frenchman!" whispered her companion. "Ride on!"</p>

  <p>But Valerie had caught her bridle, stammering he knew not what.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur!" she said flushing, "what do you want&mdash;mean? Are you
  following me?"</p>

  <p>She was fair, truly, only her prettiness had faded, her thick hair was ash
  colour, under her dark cloak her white dancing-dress was showing.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have followed you," stammered the Chevalier. "Did I not assure you
  I would follow you&mdash;always, madame? Tell me why you fly from me?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she answered, "let go my palfrey&mdash;I am beneath your
  notice&mdash;and above it, too&mdash;I know not what you mean and will not
  ask, only I pray you, let me go."</p>

  <p>But his hand only tightened on the bridle. At last!&mdash;it seemed
  'twould be enough to merely gaze upon her face.</p>

  <p>"I adore you!" he said simply. "I would take you from this
  life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You insult me," she interrupted sharply, her gray eyes filling with
  tears. "I am a poor dancer&mdash;let me go, I want nothing from you&mdash;a
  year ago I said so, Monsieur, let me go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Valerie Estercel," he said quickly. "Of a great name and
  fortune&mdash;I will use both freely in winning you for my wife."</p>

  <p>She seemed startled by his earnestness, touched, too; glancing at her
  companion, she laughed almost wildly.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! you are mad, I think!" she said. "That is if you are
  sincere&mdash;I believe you are sincere, Monsieur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sincere!" cried Valerie fervently. "God knows you are the one dear thing
  on the earth to me!"</p>

  <p>"You know not what you say," she answered. "Monsieur, this is folly," and
  her companion broke in impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, let us go&mdash;we have no wish to stay."</p>

  <p>"Nor any will," added the dancing girl more gently. Her sad eyes fell on
  the Chevalier. "I pray you cease this fantasy and follow us no more.</p>

  <p>"You were not born to this&mdash;you are not happy!" cried Estercel
  earnestly. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I know it. Why will you not leave this world for
  the one where you belong?"</p>

  <p>"I am what I was born," she answered bitterly. "A churl&mdash;of the dust,
  the gutter&mdash;leave me there. Happy? I do not ask for so much&mdash;only,
  Monsieur, to be left alone, unspied upon, unfollowed."</p>

  <p>She drew her cloak round her and gathered the reins up with a gesture that
  was his dismissal, but Estercel would not take it, he caught the rein, he
  pleaded with her to heed him and to listen.</p>

  <p>"I need neither protection nor sympathy," she broke in suddenly, "nor am I
  a woman to be made an idol of. What heart I have is not mine to give. Once
  more I say I believe you are sincere, Monsieur, and will heed me when I ask
  you&mdash;go and waste no more time in following me."</p>

  <p>He dropped her bridle with a piteous face.</p>

  <p>"I cannot put you from my heart," he said slowly. "Through long weeks have
  I&mdash;hoped&mdash;but since you ask&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll laugh at this to-morrow," she said, quickly, then at the sight of
  the misery in the large, childlike eyes she added: "You are an honest
  gentleman, Monsieur&mdash;and&mdash;so young!" Smiling a little wistfully,
  she held out her hand, but with a sad gesture Valerie stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Will you not tell me your name?" he said. "You have asked me, and my love
  shall trouble you no more, only tell me your name."</p>

  <p>"I have many names," she answered. "I hardly know which I may call my
  own&mdash;the dearest one&mdash;to me&mdash;is Yvonne-Marie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yvonne-Marie&mdash;" the Chevalier murmured it. "My dear thanks for this
  favour," he added simply.</p>

  <p>"Will you not add to it? Is there not some service I may do&mdash;thee?"
  His voice fell softly to the word.</p>

  <p>"None&mdash;save promising to follow no more."</p>

  <p>"I promise," he answered, his staring, tear-blinded eyes on her face. He
  paused a moment as if about to say more, then turned away, adding simply;
  "Farewell, Yvonne-Marie."</p>

  <p>She smiled between bitterness and sadness, and glanced at her companion,
  then touched up her palfrey without a word and the two rode on toward
  Rennes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V.&mdash;YVONNE-MARIE</h2>

  <p class="first">"An' she does not love Prince Gilles&mdash;I will be utterly
  undone&mdash;for the game is in the lady's hands." So thought Captain
  Kristopher, looking over the wide town of Rennes from the window of the fort
  that overhung the gates.</p>

  <p>The emptiness, the dreariness of the room made it a cage; so it struck
  Kristopher as fie turned from the prospect of the gray, mist-shrouded
  town.</p>

  <p>He began moodily pacing the rough flags, and his thoughts shaped
  themselves to half-uttered words.</p>

  <p>"I' faith, it's not for a leader of hired soldiers to be picking and
  choosing&mdash;" With a laugh he checked himself and picking up his doublet,
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Robin!" he called. "This will be needing patching," and he flung it down
  the corridor, and returning to the table, sat there in his shirt, his face
  gloomy, his eyes on the mists and the grayness without. He had not seen
  Montauban since he had left him that day in Koet Kandek; he had been to Court
  and seen the Duke's second brother, and obtained feeble promises of
  advancement from him&mdash;beyond that, nothing. Pointless as ever, his life
  dragged on, to-morrow Françoise de Dinan came to Rennes, her month of
  mourning over, and from more than one Kristopher had heard her betrothal
  spoken of lightly, as a thing easily to be broken, thinking of his promise,
  he grew sick at heart.</p>

  <p>"An' Guy de Montauban is all powerful&mdash;sure, it remains with the lady
  herself&mdash;for nothing I can do."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>That same evening in a little inn in Rennes, a mixed company of travellers
  sat at supper, and high in the seat of the pointed window were two
  "disrevellers "&mdash;strolling players and story tellers&mdash;both women.
  One, the older and the darker, was called Héloïse by her companion, the other
  was she who had given her name to Sir Valerie as Yvonne-Marie.</p>

  <p>A minstrel in a striped dress had just finished singing, and the company,
  flushed and laughing, turned to the window seat and to the two who sat
  there&mdash;silent.</p>

  <p>"Tell us another story, <i>ma chérie</i>," cried one, and raised a goblet
  glittering in the firelight.</p>

  <p>The others echoed his words, pushing their chairs back over the rushes,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned her head and gazed down at them, wearily. She looked
  ill, all the rouge on her cheeks could not disguise their thinness and
  pallor, her dress had been white, but was now soiled and torn.</p>

  <p>"I have told you all my stories," she said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Tell them again!" laughed the minstrel.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie put her hot hand in her companion's, her eyes were blazing,
  the brightly lit room, the laughing faces, the fire, began to swim before
  her.</p>

  <p>"Ask Héloïse," she said, "if you want something to make you laugh&mdash;I
  have no pleasant tales."</p>

  <p>The dark woman frowned impatiently: "'Tis our living, fool!" she
  whispered. "Tell them something an' you wish for shelter to-night."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie's heart was heaving under the tarnished lace&mdash;the
  serving man held up a glass of wine to her and she took it and drank and
  laughed, then she dropped the glass, spilling the rest over the rushes,
  drawing herself together, shivering.</p>

  <p>"Tell us somewhat sad, then," said the man at the head of the table,
  good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>As she raised her head, her eyes almost startled them; some of the wine
  had fallen over her dress&mdash;it looked like blood. She began talking,
  rapidly, feverishly, looking straight in front of her, taking no heed of her
  listeners.</p>

  <p>"It was a long time ago&mdash;and yet a little while&mdash;it was in the
  forest of Fontainebleau and yet it was nowhere&mdash;that two people lived,
  alone and happy. One was a girl and the other was her father.</p>

  <p>"He was an outlaw&mdash;for what I cannot tell&mdash;and she&mdash;she was
  a girl I Fontainebleau I&mdash;the beautiful forest&mdash;the strong wet
  leaves&mdash;the happy, unseen flowers&mdash;Fontainebleau! She knew nothing
  but that forest&mdash;nothing of shame and lies, hate or love&mdash;fear she
  knew, for their lives were not safe anywhere but there&mdash;and
  hope&mdash;sometimes hope of something better even than the happy
  present&mdash;beyond that&mdash;nothing. And one day into the forest of
  Fontainebleau three strangers rode&mdash;straight up to their but and
  dismounted.</p>

  <p>"Two were men, they had light hair and eyes&mdash;one was dark of face,
  the other smiled, the third was a woman, much more beautiful than anything
  this girl had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"And all three were dressed in silk and finest cloth and there were jewels
  in the lady's ears and on her neck. The horses were trapped with
  silver&mdash;the girl crept away among the trees, abashed, while they talked
  to her father&mdash;and she would have run away and hid&mdash;but they called
  her out and told her she was coming with them&mdash;she was old enough, they
  said, and pretty too.</p>

  <p>"They were her brothers and her sister.</p>

  <p>"She saw them give some money to their father&mdash;and he laughed,
  bidding her God-speed&mdash;the soldiers had found him out at last&mdash;he
  was leaving Fontainebleau&mdash;and France.</p>

  <p>"Afterward she heard he was dead, killed before he reached the coast, and
  she did not weep much for other troubles lay heavy on her heart&mdash;but
  often she would wake in the night and weep to think of Fontainebleau and the
  spotted deer.</p>

  <p>"They took her to a country chateau, her brothers and her sister, and for
  a year she lived there, learning many things&mdash;but not that they were
  liars and robbers and she a`poor dupe in their hands!</p>

  <p>"They told her she was al countess and all the lands they looked at from
  the chateau theirs...</p>

  <p>"By and by they sent her to England with her youngest brother&mdash;to the
  English&mdash;and she was called Countess and he Count and the name they used
  was not their own&mdash;but she did not know it. She was young and
  pretty&mdash;she grew happy&mdash;she did not question why or wherefore she,
  an outlaw's daughter, was living as a high-born dame&mdash;she was weak and
  foolish-hearted.</p>

  <p>"There was a young knight at the court, wealthy and a noble&mdash;the
  king's favourite and pleasant to all men.</p>

  <p>"He was a soldier and held a high post, his comings and goings were
  triumphs of magnificence, he lived in royal state, twenty gentlemen waited on
  him&mdash;fifty serving men rode behind him, his largesse was greater than
  the king's&mdash;of three counties he was the lord and his name through the
  land one with honour.</p>

  <p>"And she loved him.</p>

  <p>"One day her brother found her with his picture&mdash;and she told
  him&mdash;weeping, poor soul!</p>

  <p>"And he&mdash;her brother&mdash;used her to bait his trap, dangling her
  before the young knight's eyes...</p>

  <p>"And she loved him with her whole soul.</p>

  <p>"Her brother had letters from the French court, and influence.</p>

  <p>"In the end the young knight married her.</p>

  <p>"Then, not a month after her wedding-day her brother came and spoke to her
  telling her she was not what her husband thought her, and if he knew the
  truth he would cast her off&mdash;and she clung to him, weeping, and begged
  him to be silent forever&mdash;for she was living in Paradise!</p>

  <p>"And then he told her to find out things from her husband&mdash;listen
  when others talked to him&mdash;take his papers and bring them to him to
  copy. If she did this he would not tell.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;poor fool! she promised&mdash;only too gladly and her life went
  on happily&mdash;cleverly she did her spying and stealing&mdash;for ah! she
  was afraid of losing him!</p>

  <p>"Only she noticed her husband began to grow graver&mdash;and some people
  would look coldly on him.</p>

  <p>"And they were called before the king, both of them&mdash;and she heard it
  put to him that suspicion lay on him, of betraying his country&mdash;but so
  proudly and calmly did he deny it and so high stood his honour, they believed
  him.</p>

  <p>"'And your wife,' they said to him&mdash;'is French.'</p>

  <p>"And he answered hotly before she could speak 'My wife is my wife and I
  answer for her honour with my own.'</p>

  <p>"And again they believed him, and to show trust, gave him a
  paper&mdash;writing on it&mdash;and limning.</p>

  <p>"When they reached home she crept away into the dark and wept&mdash;and
  presently her brother came and she thought the Devil must look as he
  did...</p>

  <p>"He asked her for that paper&mdash;for a little while:</p>

  <p>"'Give it me or I tell him,' he said.</p>

  <p>"She knew where it was&mdash;she went and fetched it&mdash;and gave it
  him. He promised it back, she tried to stifle her heart with that.</p>

  <p>"Two days after she sat alone in the dusk&mdash;she heard him coming up
  the stairs&mdash;stumbling.</p>

  <p>"When he came into the room she saw his face was the colour of paper, he
  went to the window and leaned there, silent. He did not speak to her or she
  to him. A long time seemed to go by, then he looked up and told her the
  English had been defeated&mdash;and some islands lost to the French.</p>

  <p>"She said nothing&mdash;there were other feet on the stairs and the room
  filled with the great court lords.</p>

  <p>"They asked him for that paper, he vowed on his honour it had never left
  his hands, and turned proudly to give it them.</p>

  <p>"She sat frozen, she could have laughed in anguish&mdash;there was no
  paper I they shrugged their shoulders at his dismay&mdash;he was the only man
  who knew the English plans&mdash;this had been a test and proved him
  false.</p>

  <p>"His face was as white as the lace round his throat&mdash;they left her
  alone&mdash;she had not spoken, she did not tell.</p>

  <p>"Presently he came back&mdash;up to where she sat, laid his dear head on
  her shoulder and wept. 'I'm ruined,' he said, 'penniless and
  banished&mdash;dishonoured&mdash;can you love a dishonoured man, dear
  heart?'</p>

  <p>"She loved him more than all the world&mdash;she could not tell&mdash;she
  could not save his honour and lose his love.</p>

  <p>"All his splendour was taken from him&mdash;all his lands&mdash;they took
  the sword from his side and the orders from his neck and broke them.</p>

  <p>"Still she did not speak.</p>

  <p>"They were banished&mdash;in a few hours they would start for France.</p>

  <p>"For one whole long night an angry crowd surged outside the windows and
  called him vile names.</p>

  <p>"Still she did not tell.</p>

  <p>"Half mad, she sat crouching in the dark when her brother came again.</p>

  <p>"'Leave me now,' he said, 'come back to France with me&mdash;he is
  penniless and I've made more gold than you've ever seen by that piece of
  paper.'</p>

  <p>"He showed her some of the money, laughing, he had the paper in his
  hand&mdash;she took it from him and struck him across the face with
  it&mdash;shaking with fury and dashed out of the room...</p>

  <p>"Outside she met her husband, his hand on the door...</p>

  <p>"After a while he spoke.</p>

  <p>"'I've heard,' he said, and drew the paper out of her hand spreading it
  out under the light.</p>

  <p>"When he turned, his face was quite different.</p>

  <p>"'It's strange to think I ever loved you,' he said in a strained voice,
  and he turned away, leaving her there&mdash;alone.</p>

  <p>"This is only a story I am telling&mdash;I can't say what she felt&mdash;I
  do not know&mdash;I only know she was sure of this&mdash;that he would not
  tell the truth&mdash;for he had answered for her honour before them all. Ah I
  me!</p>

  <p>"'I will clear him myself,' she said, but the doors were locked on her,
  and at the next day's gray dawn, they started for France.</p>

  <p>"The shame was still over him&mdash;he had not told.</p>

  <p>"All the long, weary journey he never spoke to her&mdash;never looked at
  her.</p>

  <p>"And this she knew however great her sin, her punishment was
  greater&mdash;in all the world could be no greater bitterness than
  this&mdash;to lose his love.</p>

  <p>"He took her to a convent in France and left her there with the nuns. She
  was a miserable impostor, of a disgraced family, with spies and thieves for
  her brothers&mdash;she deserved it&mdash;but she loved him.</p>

  <p>"This is a foolish story, is it not? but I am, reaching the end&mdash;what
  became of him do not know, she never saw him again&mdash;as he was going he
  spoke to her again: 'Thou hast done that,' he said, 'that has severed us two
  forever. Teach thine own soul to forgive thee&mdash;no curse of mine shall
  drag thee down.'</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!</p>

  <p>"She lived there for a year, a whole weary year&mdash;she tried to pray,
  to bring repentance to her heart&mdash;but it was a stranger to her, as sin
  had been&mdash;it did not ease her heart to pray&mdash;she had no thought of
  any but him&mdash;she was dying, slowly, not because of the stern
  life&mdash;not because of remorse, but of love.</p>

  <p>"Then she escaped&mdash;one of the sisters helping her and coming
  too&mdash;she had a gold cross on her dress and she sold it and bought a
  mummer's outfit.</p>

  <p>"And so she went in quest of him&mdash;with nothing but her love for her
  guide.</p>

  <p>"She sought three years in vain&mdash;singing and dancing for her
  livelihood&mdash;she sought in vain!</p>

  <p>"There is no more to say."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie brought her gray eyes from staring in front of her, and
  looked at the ring of listeners held silent by her words, and laughed
  unhappily and changed the dull, level tones of her voice.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your patience," she said wildly, putting her hands to her
  burning forehead, "you have listened to a true tale, Messires!"</p>

  <p>Her companion dragged at her sleeve, but she shook her off, laughing
  again.</p>

  <p>"Tell us the names!" cried one of the company, and as Yvonne sprang down
  into the rushes he held out a piece of money.</p>

  <p>She did not seem to see, she leaned against the wall, her cheeks hotly
  bright with colour under her rouge, her eyes shining.</p>

  <p>The other woman went round the table collecting coins in the corner of her
  gold scarf and those that gave it were subdued and quiet. There was something
  painful both in the tale and the teller.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie looked round at them, flinging her hood over her head.</p>

  <p>"She doesn't want to find him now," she said. "That is the worst of
  it&mdash;what is she now? A beggar living on charity!"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for the other she ran to the door, but one of the men put
  out his hand and caught her by the wrist as she passed.</p>

  <p>"Was it you?" he said with a smile in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie wrenched her hand away with a reckless laugh.</p>

  <p>"I?" she cried. "I am a poor 'disreveller'&mdash;nothing more. She I tell
  you of, passed under the name of Diane d'Esperon; her real name was
  Yvonne-Marie; and he, the Englishman, was Verdun of Valence, and Lord of
  Coventry&mdash;should you ever meet him, Messire, exiled as a traitor, you
  will know it was his wife, his wretched wife, for whom he bears the blame and
  to whom he never casts a thought!"</p>

  <p>She lurched forward and caught at the door, leaving the company silent
  behind her&mdash;then out into the oak passage and the dark.</p>

  <p>Héloïse crept out after her and took her hot hand.</p>

  <p>"Yvonne&mdash;Yvonne-Marie&mdash;are you mad?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. They drew back the bolt and stepped into the night,
  the keen air making them shiver in their thin dresses. Héloïse was knotting
  the coins into the corner of her dress; Yvonne-Marie looking at her, saw she
  was crying quietly.</p>

  <p>"Poor thing!" she said dully, quietly. "You are sorry you ever came with
  me&mdash;you wish you were in the convent again."</p>

  <p>The rain had dried, but it was damp and cold. They walked on rapidly
  toward the house where they had lodgings, splashing through tie mud that
  covered the streets.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI.&mdash;MY LADY OF DINAN</h2>

  <p class="first">For some days Françoise de Dinan had been at the court of
  Rennes; despite the flying of many rumours she was still Gilles of Brittany's
  betrothed; Kristopher began to think he had put too high a value on
  Montauban's skill, too low a value on her faith. Even for his friend's sake
  he had no wish to meddle in court intrigues nor any desire to put himself
  against Montauban, so he waited quietly till a summons from the Duke brought
  him to the court.</p>

  <p>But then he heard whispered words and laughs that made him wish Gilles was
  back in Brittany.</p>

  <p>"She is a great fortune for a third brother!"</p>

  <p>"Hearts change with titles too&mdash;she never loved him."</p>

  <p>Kristopher passed on quickly&mdash;how had there risen even a hint of such
  a thing? From the Duke's demeanour&mdash;from hers&mdash;or knowledge of the
  practice of courts?</p>

  <p>In the low, crowded audience chamber he stepped aside into the window,
  waiting his turn.</p>

  <p>Françoise de Dinan was there, so richly dressed, so different in gay
  bearing and laughter he would hardly have known her for the same woman whose
  sad face had looked wistful through the mist.</p>

  <p>Guy de Montauban was beside her; both glancing up saw Kristopher, and the
  lady paused and came a little nearer to the window.</p>

  <p>"You know yonder soldier, madame?" said Guy, smiling. "The banished
  Englishman who fought so well in France."</p>

  <p>"One of Gilles' men," she answered. "He did him some service
  once&mdash;were he not a tried soldier we might call him a friend."</p>

  <p>"He will not dare to come and speak to me," she thought and was sorry for
  it, eyeing Kristopher through her thick, dark lashes, While she spoke to
  Montauban of indifferent things and pulled the velvet ribbons on her sleeve
  with a slight impatience.</p>

  <p>Her month of mourning over, she had blazed into the rich garments she had
  ever dreamed of&mdash;a princess, the wealthiest woman in Brittany, at the
  summit of her desires at last. There only remained to dash her joy that she
  had parted with her liberty in her obscurity&mdash;a good match for Françoise
  de Dinan was a poor one for the Countess de Chateaubriand, and her tie to
  Gilles galled her secretly&mdash;she had no need to marry for money now.</p>

  <p>She turned away at last to speak elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"An' you've forgotten me?" said a voice behind her, and she looked round
  into the blue eyes of Captain Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Delighted, she took little pains to conceal it, holding out her hand
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"Captain Kristopher Fassiferne," she said, and the next instant was vexed
  she had the name so ready. "Where did I see you, Messire," she added lightly,
  to cover it.</p>

  <p>Captain Kristopher smiled. He was perfectly unabashed, completely at his
  ease, like one used to courts.</p>

  <p>"You remember," he said, "outside the walls of Hardouinaye&mdash;when the
  Prince said good-bye&mdash;my lady&mdash;an' you wore a purple gown an' a
  gold ribbon&mdash;sure, you remember now?"</p>

  <p>His smile deepened, his face and voice held her so completely she could
  not take her eyes away. Guy waiting by the stairs for the Duke, looked at
  them frowning, but she took no heed.</p>

  <p>"You have quick eyes," she said, "and a good memory, Sieur."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," he smiled. "But it's some things don't&mdash;need a good memory
  to remember, an' one of them is you, my lady&mdash;sure it's not quite a
  senseless clod I am to see you and forget you."</p>

  <p>It was the first time Françoise de Dinan had so been spoken to&mdash;she
  was bewildered and fascinated by something so different from the stately
  manners and set speeches of her nation.</p>

  <p>"Gilles hath often spoken of you," she said, and her eyes were noting
  every detail of his dress and appearance. "Hath he not done more for you than
  a poor captaincy?"</p>

  <p>He laughed, standing easily before her, his cap in his hands.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be a man's friend and his favourite both&mdash;and I'm his
  friend, my lady."</p>

  <p>His vivid, dancing eyes sought her face. She could not tell why&mdash;she
  could not answer him&mdash;but turned away with a sudden desire to hide
  herself&mdash;to get away from them all&mdash;and looking round and seeing
  Guy's pale yellow eyes on her, the desire grew. It did not please Montauban
  she should so remember Kristopher, and so look at him and so speak to
  him&mdash;for all her face was soon indifferent, it did not please him.</p>

  <p>"The Duke," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>Guy took his eyes from Kristopher slowly; his dark face was none the
  pleasanter for the other's smiles.</p>

  <p>"The Duke." The word went round.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Brittany crept down the stairs slowly, leaning on the Duchess'
  arm; he was tall and stooped, peering ahead with weak eyes.</p>

  <p>Halfway down the courtiers were already thronging&mdash;Montauban pushing
  up to him, spoke a second&mdash;then standing aside, a dozen others filled
  his place.</p>

  <p>The Duchess, sandy-haired, light-lashed, awkward of bearing, came over to
  Françoise and kissed her affectionately.</p>

  <p>Her affection was false, and Françoise knew it, but answered with the
  sweetest of smiles. "There has been no news from England, madame&mdash;for
  long," she said. "The Duke hath not heard to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no, <i>ma chérie</i>&mdash;and what is of such interest in
  England?"</p>

  <p>"You ask me?" said Françoise in a soft, reproachful tone. "Ah! Madame,
  you&mdash;who know my heart." She turned swimming eyes on the
  Duchess&mdash;"Madame&mdash;your brother and my betrothed!"</p>

  <p>Isabel smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are very constant, <i>ma petite</i>&mdash;how long will it last,
  <i>m'amie</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Madame!" sighed Françoise, and her eyes roved to Kristopher.</p>

  <p>"Till he comes back or forgets?" asked the Duchess.</p>

  <p>"You break my heart, Madame," said Françoise, sighing again, still looking
  at Kristopher. "Surely I sorrow enough for you to spare me this?"</p>

  <p>"You keep it well hid," said the Duchess, sharply.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII.&mdash;AT THE SIGN OF THE RISING SUN</h2>

  <p class="first">AT the "Sign of the Rising Sun," the inn near the gates of
  Rennes, where Valerie Estercel stayed, a stranger, both to the city and to
  Brittany, had arrived. An Englishman with one esquire.</p>

  <p>He sat now in the public parlour, leaning over a letter of directions,
  pushing his hair back from his intent face, in the endeavour to make out the
  close writ French.</p>

  <p>The window was open and a sweet smell of freshness, of rain and wet earth
  was blown into the sunny oaken room.</p>

  <p>The Englishman appeared to be a person of some distinction judging by his
  blue velvet dress, handsomely ruffled with lace, and the sable cloak thrown
  over the back of his chair, and when he rose from the letter, and crossed to
  the window, he showed a tall, well-formed figure and a pleasant face, the
  most remarkable feature of which was a pair of light brown eyes.</p>

  <p>It was drawing toward the evening, and those who lodged there beginning to
  return to the "Sign of the Rising Sun," and he of the brown eyes, noticing
  the courtyard filling with travellers, went into the passage in some anxiety,
  surveying a bale of goods and a chest that stood there.</p>

  <p>"Plague on your outlandish tongue," he said to himself, glancing at the
  host, for he spoke no Breton, and the other little French.</p>

  <p>By dint of signs and much impatience on the part of the Englishman, the
  packages were dragged upstairs and lodged in his room, still regarded by
  their owner with anxious eyes.</p>

  <p>Among those returning to the inn was Valerie Estercel and he did not come
  alone.</p>

  <p>A lady and a knight were with him, attended by a serving man. The couple
  whom he had met on the road outside Rennes, the gray-eyed dame and her dark
  brother.</p>

  <p>To the host Sir Valerie explained they were travellers who had lost their
  way, and whom he had met outside the town&mdash;to-night they could stay at
  the "Rising Sun "&mdash;to-morrow he would leave Rennes with them&mdash;as
  they had asked the favour of his company.</p>

  <p>The Englishman had returned to the parlour and was looking out of the
  window at the wide prospect of crooked roofs, with here and there the
  high-springing, slender spires of beautiful churches.</p>

  <p>When he turned again Valerie Estercel was in the room, and the lady
  undoing her mantle at the fire, the profile of her face clear against her
  dark hood. She had a tender mouth and wistful, and heavy, dark-brown hair lay
  coiled about her neck, she was rouged and her eyes darkened, but it was done
  so well as to be forgiven. Valerie was talking to her in a low voice and her
  companion standing near the door covertly surveyed the Englishman.</p>

  <p>He had a dark face and shrewd eyes and was plainly dressed but with
  elegance.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Valerie turned to the figure in the window with whom he had some
  slight acquaintance, they having been guests together these few days at the
  "Rising Sun."</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said to the lady, "Sir Gregan Griffiths, an Englishman,
  travelling Brittany as we do&mdash;one whom I trust may accompany
  us&mdash;Sir Gregan, this is Madame la Contesse d'Estouteville and her
  brother, Sir Esper Vassè."</p>

  <p>Sir Gregan Griffiths looked at them both keenly. He had merry eyes and a
  mouth that looked as if it was always going to break into a laugh.</p>

  <p>He laughed now, bowing, then turned to the window again, but his eyes were
  on the lady's face&mdash;she reminded him of some one, reminded him very
  strongly.</p>

  <p>A boy came in and placed lights round the room and put more logs on the
  fire stirring it into a ruddy glow that shone through Valerie's flaxen
  hair.</p>

  <p>The lady had laid her cloak aside, underneath she wore a long, gray gown
  that matched her eyes in colour, and at her breast and in her pretty hair
  were thick red ribbons.</p>

  <p>She had scarlet velvet gloves and drew them off slowly, seating herself in
  the great chair in front of the fire, Valerie on one side, and her brother,
  dark, silent, on the other.</p>

  <p>They were talking together, softly, when Gregan Griffiths, coming from the
  window with his eyes on her face, joined in easily, leaning on the back of
  Valerie's chair.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you know Brittany better than I," he said. "Maybe, you can tell me
  something I have been puzzled over since I landed."</p>

  <p>"What, Messire?" asked Madame d'Estouteville, and there was a slight
  simper in the sweetness of her tone.</p>

  <p>"This," said Gregan&mdash;"Who is La Rose Rouge?"</p>

  <p>He was surprised to see her start and flush&mdash;and her brother answered
  quickly as if to cover her confusion:</p>

  <p>"What have you heard of him, Messire?"</p>

  <p>The Englishman shrugged his shoulders lightly. "Travelling through
  Hardouinaye and Dol, I heard much&mdash;every forest I traversed, they bade
  me beware of La Rose Rouge&mdash;every horseman riding by, went on his knees
  to God to defend them against La Rose Rouge&mdash;I passed houses burned to
  the ground&mdash;La Rose Rouge did it&mdash;I passed trees laden with
  corpses&mdash;La Rose Rouge did it&mdash;and no one could tell me who La Rose
  Rouge was."</p>

  <p>"I heard of him," said Valerie, "when I rode through Hardouinaye."</p>

  <p>Madame d'Estouteville kept her eyes on the fire, but Sir Esper answered
  with a laugh: "I can tell you&mdash;it is Enguerrand de la Rose, Count of
  Bàrrès and Dol, called La Rose Rouge because of the colour of his hair, his
  eyes, and his hands&mdash;a dangerous rebel, Messire, who has defied the Duke
  and the King, long and successfully."</p>

  <p>"The people of Brittany seem to hold him in terror," said Gregan.</p>

  <p>Esper's sister spoke now, sweetly:</p>

  <p>"He holds the land of Dol&mdash;a perfect king there, Messire, no one dare
  interfere."</p>

  <p>She folded her hands in her lap, they were very white and pretty hands,
  and she crossed her feet daintily, her red shoes glowing like fire in the
  warm light.</p>

  <p>Her voice was very plaintive and sweet&mdash;Gregan Griffiths had heard
  one very like it&mdash;some years ago in England&mdash;he was watching her
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said suddenly, "had you a sister at the court of
  England?"</p>

  <p>She turned and looked him straight in the face. "Never, Messire."</p>

  <p>Her voice was quite steady, her face calm.</p>

  <p>"You remind me, Madame, of one called Diane d'Espernon&mdash;you never
  knew of her?"</p>

  <p>She did wince a little now and turned away, but still she answered firmly
  and with some disdain: "I never heard the name, Messire."</p>

  <p>Gregan smiled, but his face had grown hard.</p>

  <p>"'Tis some mistake," said her brother hastily ant he rose: "Your chamber
  will be ready now, Denise."</p>

  <p>As she rose, she looked at Gregan defiantly, her teeth set in her under
  lip, then gathering her skirts about her, was gone, Sir Esper following.</p>

  <p>Gregan looked after them and laughed:</p>

  <p>"Save our souls! a pretty pair!"</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel, day-dreaming over the fire, looked up startled.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Messire?"</p>

  <p>Gregan Griffiths came up to him and laid his hand on his shoulder:</p>

  <p>"You make those your companions?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Messire, our roads he together&mdash;and the countess' face
  remindeth me of one I hold in my heart&mdash;they asked me&mdash;therefore I
  go with them." He turned great, swimming eyes up at the other and spoke
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"My friend," said Gregan calmly. "Take a warning&mdash;that man and his
  sister are as clever a pair of rogues as ever deceived."</p>

  <p>"Messire!"</p>

  <p>Valerie sprang to his feet with a flushed face. "What right have you to
  say that&mdash;<i>Morbleu</i>! what right?"</p>

  <p>Gregan looked amused into the other's angry eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are easily caught," he said, "and I am sorry for you&mdash;why, the
  man's a scoundrel, a lying scoundrel&mdash;and the lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The lady&mdash;what of the lady?" Valerie's slender figure was dilated to
  its full height, his eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"She is&mdash;well, no better&mdash;take heed in time, Sir Valerie."</p>

  <p>"This is slander!" cried Valerie. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! slander! Have they not
  trusted me I stands it with mere honour to listen to you now? I will go with
  them to the end of the earth!"</p>

  <p>"More like to the end of the next street to be left there clubbed with
  your pockets empty." Valerie flushed hotly:</p>

  <p>"I'll not listen&mdash;I'll not believe."</p>

  <p>"Sir Valerie&mdash;whatever you call yourself," retorted Gregan angrily,
  "you're a fool, and I warrant this isn't the first time you've been told
  so&mdash;but an' you've a fancy to grace my lady Denise's net&mdash;it's not
  I will be wasting time stopping you."</p>

  <p>Valerie held his clasped hands up to Heaven in a passionate appeal:</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! that I should hear this! that a true
  knight should be so insulted. Hear me swear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the door banging told him Gregan had gone, and he flung himself on to
  the settle again, sighing.</p>

  <p>Gregan Griffiths went up to his chamber and began pacing about
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"She is Diane d'Espernon's sister, I feel sure of it," he said, "an' busy
  ruining others as Diane ruined Kristopher." He felt sore and angry at having
  met them&mdash;what were they doing in Brittany where Kristopher
  was&mdash;Kristopher, whom he had come from England to see, for Sir Gregan's
  wife was Fassiferne's own sister.</p>

  <p>Presently he heard voices outside and went out on to the landing.</p>

  <p>Denise and Esper were talking together on the stairs, half hidden in the
  dark and with them another&mdash;he who had come with them as a
  serving-man.</p>

  <p>Gregan caught a glimpse of him, and all the blood rushed to his face.</p>

  <p>All doubts had vanished now&mdash;that serving-man was he who had shone at
  the English court as Kristopher Fassiferne's friend and his wife's
  brother.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>It was some hours later, past midnight, the whole inn silent, dark, not a
  soul stirring. The great parlour was in perfect blackness, the fire out, the
  ashes cold.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a faint sound, as of a footstep, and a pale light
  flickered up, a taper, showing clearly who held it, Denise
  d'Estouteville.</p>

  <p>Her brothers were there, too, creeping softly into the thin circle of
  light.</p>

  <p>Denise put the taper cautiously on the table, shading it with her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Eneth," she said to the younger of the two men, "he is abed and
  asleep?"</p>

  <p>Eneth nodded, but Esper spoke angrily:</p>

  <p>"'Tis a piece of folly&mdash;I think he knew you, Denise."</p>

  <p>"How could he?" she retorted sharply, "he had never seen me&mdash;and I am
  not so very like to Yvonne-Marie."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" whispered Eneth.</p>

  <p>"Besides," continued Denise in a lower tone, "we must have money&mdash;I
  brought nothing away from Bàrrès but the ornaments I wore."</p>

  <p>"Curse you for quarrelling with Enguerrand," said Esper sullenly, "and for
  looking so foolish when he was mentioned."</p>

  <p>"It was you," she said. "I had kept him had not you
  interfered&mdash;.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma chérie</i>," said the younger brother softly, picking up the
  candle. "If you have anything to say&mdash;this is hardly the time to say
  it&mdash;I have the keys here&mdash;I know he carries treasure."</p>

  <p>"And the wine is drugged," said Denise. "An' we are to deceive that
  wearisome fool, Sir Valerie, we must have money." As she spoke she opened the
  door softly, and silently they stepped out into the corridor.</p>

  <p>The one candle shed a pale light, enough to show the way, no more.</p>

  <p>They were all darkly dressed, Denise with a handkerchief tied over the
  lower half of her face, making her look ghastly in the sickly light.</p>

  <p>"Hush&mdash;did one of you speak?"</p>

  <p>She looked back over her shoulder, stopping.</p>

  <p>"No, no," whispered Esper.</p>

  <p>Cautiously they gained the first landing, a cold wind blew across from the
  draughty window and almost put the candle out, its flickering light only
  showed a few feet of dark, carved wood and their own tense faces.</p>

  <p>"Which door?" breathed Denise, fumbling her hand across the wall in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>"The second&mdash;hush&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They paused&mdash;breathless a moment, it was only the wind.</p>

  <p>"Curse the wind," muttered Esper.</p>

  <p>Another sound was mingled with it now, the wild beat of the rain, slashing
  down through the bare trees.</p>

  <p>"Fortunate," said Denise, and carefully turned the handle; there was no
  need for the key, the door was unlocked.</p>

  <p>Breathlessly, with a silent, gliding motion, Denise crept in, Eneth after
  her; for a second the elder brother hung back, then followed.</p>

  <p>The room was fairly small and low, the one window firmly barred.</p>

  <p>A great black bedstead stood against the wall, canopied in silk.</p>

  <p>Denise stepped a little closer, light-footed as a cat.</p>

  <p>Eneth was creeping across the room with the stealthy pace of a panther,
  feeling by the wall as he went.</p>

  <p>"Where is it&mdash;where?" whispered Denise. She held the light over her
  head and looked round.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Eneth; from the far corner of the room he dragged a great
  package, drawing it lightly over the floor.</p>

  <p>Esper was beside it in a moment, the tools were ready and he was prizing
  the lid open.</p>

  <p>Denise stood over them with the taper, not without some anxious glances
  toward the bed.</p>

  <p>A stifled exclamation from Esper intercepted him, the chest lay open, the
  pale light showed folds of stuffs&mdash;no gold&mdash;no jewels!</p>

  <p>"Curse them!" cried Eneth. "<i>Malidictè!</i>"</p>

  <p>"There is gold somewhere," said Denise. "I have kept my ears and eyes open
  all the evening and heard of it. Gregan Griffiths carried it."</p>

  <p>"We must find it," said Eneth.</p>

  <p>They paused and looked round irresolute, flashing the candle into the
  farthest corners of the room. There was no sign of any chest or anything
  containing money.</p>

  <p>Denise bit her lip in vexation. "We had best leave it," said Esper,
  fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Is he not drugged?" returned Denise, "and the wind and rain beat loud
  enough to drown our footsteps to the others."</p>

  <p>She looked toward the bed. Under the rough coverlet lay Gregan Griffiths
  in a deep sleep. At the end of the bed was his fur-lined cloak and the blue
  velvet suit.</p>

  <p>Eneth was going over the pockets deftly, there were papers and
  money&mdash;both English.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Denise pointed to the bedside, on a cane chair lay a sword and a
  dagger, both bare and in reach of the sleeper's hand, and underneath was a
  small, padlocked box.</p>

  <p>The three fixed their eyes on it eagerly.</p>

  <p>The sleeper never moved or stirred, his deep breathing alone showed he was
  alive.</p>

  <p>The rain beat down steadily, the wind made the casement rattle and the
  faint candlelight leaped up and down.</p>

  <p>"Draw that box out," whispered Denise.</p>

  <p>"It lies very close to him," returned Esper, shrinking.</p>

  <p>"He is a powerful man, as I know of old," said Eneth, looking at the
  sleeper's outline beneath the clothes. He slipped the money he had taken from
  the clothes into his pocket, and the papers into the breast of his doublet.
  "Plague take it, for English money!"</p>

  <p>"Shall we stand here till dawn?" said Denise, angrily. "He is
  drugged!"</p>

  <p>With a sudden catlike movement Eneth had crept up and drawn the box out
  into the room.</p>

  <p>Denise, bending forward eagerly, with the taper, saw something gleam on
  the bed.</p>

  <p>"He wears a fine ring," she said.</p>

  <p>The two men were busy forcing the box open; this time was no mistake, it
  contained bags of gold and jewels. Esper closed it with a sigh of
  content.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;leave as quickly as we can," he said.</p>

  <p>"I will have that ring," said Denise, "to give to Valerie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come away," said Esper roughly, dragging the heavy box toward the door.
  Denise followed him, but stopped by the bedside.</p>

  <p>The sleeper's hand lay outside, on one of his fingers he wore a carved
  gold ring of great beauty, set with a crystal.</p>

  <p>"Eneth&mdash;et me that ring&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush&mdash;come away&mdash;it is pure folly&mdash;there are rings here
  and to spare."</p>

  <p>Denise hesitated a moment, but the sight of that great jewel roused all
  her greed.</p>

  <p>"I must have it&mdash;he is drugged&mdash;it will only take a second."</p>

  <p>Eneth turned in a fever of impatience. "Must you always do the one thing
  too much? Taking it from his very hand!"</p>

  <p>"I will do it myself," said Denise. The sleeper's steady breathing came
  regularly, the dark curtains were drawn well away from the bed, the ring
  gleamed on the hand lying on the tapestry coverlet. Denise drew nearer,
  carrying the candle, and her brothers waited in the door, fuming, the faint,
  yellow light throwing a shaded gleam over the sleeper's face. The woman's
  eyes were on the ring, she looked round keenly and leaned forward.</p>

  <p>Esper and Eneth held their breath. Her hand was on his, with delicate
  fingers she was drawing it off, so still, her very breathing was
  checked&mdash;it fitted tight&mdash;still it was coming&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>Her hand was seized in a grasp of iron and a pair of brown eyes were
  looking at her from the pillow.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! <i>Mon Dieu</i>!" she struggled violently, flinging the
  taper to the ground, Eneth making desperately for the door only shut it in
  the dark, and could not find the handle.</p>

  <p>"Let me go, let me go!" cried Denise. She leaned down and bit the hand
  that held her, struggling wildly.</p>

  <p>It was dark, pitch dark. Esper in a frenzy of fear, fought wildly for the
  door, he could not find it.</p>

  <p>They could hear Denise's stifled cries of rage, the sound of a desperate
  struggle.</p>

  <p>"We must kill him," said Eneth.</p>

  <p>It was the only way for their safety&mdash;the only way&mdash;a few sparks
  of fire still burned on the hearth, Esper with the cunning of desperation
  thrust the taper he carried into the grate&mdash;in a moment more the room
  was in the light again, the whole thing had taken only seconds in almost
  perfect silence. Esper looking round wildly, with a drawn sword, saw Denise
  lying by the bedfoot, twisted round with the sheet, and sitting on the bed
  Sir Gregan with a flushed face; he had his sword across his knee, and Esper
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Three of you are there?" said Sir Gregan, looking round at
  them&mdash;"now"&mdash;as Eneth made toward him with his dagger&mdash;"you
  put your swords&mdash;both of you&mdash;down here beside me&mdash;or I blow
  this. You&mdash;unspeakable caitiff&mdash;I remember you." He had a silver
  whistle round his neck and showed it them.</p>

  <p>Eneth fell back with lowering hate in his face. They knew each
  other&mdash;these two.</p>

  <p>The Englishman rose, his bare sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You miserable rogues&mdash;you know what it would mean if you were found
  here? Hanging."</p>

  <p>"Wretched coward!" flashed Denise, and struggled on to her knees. "Kill
  him, Eneth."</p>

  <p>"Hanging," repeated Gregan calmly. "Now do you want to be hanged?" He was
  a powerful man, the game was in his hands, though he was only half dressed
  and they were two, the slightest noise would bring the house and Valerie
  about them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Esper put his sword down, Eneth his beside it.</p>

  <p>"Now bring that box back!"</p>

  <p>Esper dragged it back into the room, watching for a chance to seize the
  other by the throat, but he was watchful, too, and had that bare sword across
  his knee.</p>

  <p>"You were rifling my pockets&mdash;keep the money for your
  trouble&mdash;and give me the papers back."</p>

  <p>"You were awake!" said Denise, her eyes bright with hate.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my pretty lady, I was awake. I know too much to drink the wine
  brought to me in inns in this honest country&mdash;when Sir Eneth d'Espernon
  brings it."</p>

  <p>Eneth flung the money and letters on the bed with a curse, the box of
  jewels stood in the middle of the floor.</p>

  <p>"You may go," said Gregan curtly.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to do, they turned, humbled, baffled. As they
  neared the door he came up to them with a curious smile:</p>

  <p>"Take this," he said to Denise, and slipped the gold ring off his finger.
  He held it out in the pale taper light close to her bewildered face. "As a
  token that Gregan Griffiths will be silent as Kristopher Fassiferne was."</p>

  <p>"Why should you tell?" she flashed. "Have you not got it all
  back&mdash;keep your ring, too!"</p>

  <p>Esper tried to hush her, but she flung him off.</p>

  <p>"Keep your ring, too&mdash;" she tossed it back across the room, her
  tear-stained face distorted with passion.</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Now, my sweet little rogue&mdash;you will leave this inn&mdash;and
  Rennes&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Before daybreak," said Esper, and dragged his sister from the room.</p>

  <p>Eneth paused a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am unarmed&mdash;" he began fiercely.</p>

  <p>"And a thief," said Gregan Griffiths, calmly, "otherwise we might
  fight&mdash;as it is&mdash;Sir Eneth d'Espernon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took him by the shoulders and put him outside the door, closing it
  after him.</p>

  <p>He heard them hesitate outside, baffled. Gregan laughed a little.</p>

  <p>I suppose I was a fool to let them go&mdash;but it made me sick to think
  of that woman's face hanging from the town gibbet&mdash;had it not been for
  her he picked up his ring and shut the lid of the treasure box, drawing it
  close to the bed.</p>

  <p>"The little devil bit hard, too," he murmured, looking ruefully at his
  finger, stiff from Denise's teeth.</p>

  <p>He half thought they might return.</p>

  <p>"She has spirit enough for anything," he said to himself and kept on the
  alert, half sorry that he had not choked the life out of Eneth.</p>

  <p>But the night wore on and no one came, and Gregan fell asleep in his
  chair, forgetful of everything in utter weariness.</p>

  <p>He woke with a start, the noise of horses outside had awakened him: It was
  daylight, there were voices outside, the voices of the Bretons, the cheerful
  calls of the stable boy.</p>

  <p>Gregan remembered last night, save for the tumbled tapestries and that
  handkerchief under his sword he had almost thought it a dream.</p>

  <p>He went to the window and looked out, there were four people mounted on
  horses, the three of last night and another.</p>

  <p>"That fool Sir Valerie," said Gregan to himself, "now if they don't leave
  Rennes&mdash;the whole pack of them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sudden thought struck him, he went back into the room and fetched the
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Denise looked pale and her sleeves were well down over her wrists.</p>

  <p>Gregan opened the window and leaned out:</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said softly, "Madame!"</p>

  <p>She looked up instantly, there was no blush on her face, no fear in her
  eyes, only a cold questioning.</p>

  <p>Gregan's anger rose higher, there was malice in his even voice.
  "Madame&mdash;you dropped this&mdash;last night." He flung the handkerchief,
  and as it fluttered to the ground, Sir Valerie picked it up, and at sight of
  it a slow colour mounted to Denise's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Messire," she said, but she did not raise her eyes to those
  bright brown ones above.</p>

  <p>But Valerie did look up, and hotly too.</p>

  <p>"A gallant way to return a lady's handkerchief!" he cried. "Worthy
  thee&mdash;who art thou&mdash;thou churl!"</p>

  <p>"Now," said Gregan, "this is too much. What art thou?&mdash;I will tell
  thee&mdash;a fool among rogues."</p>

  <p>And he drew his head in, shutting the window sharply on Valerie's furious
  reply.</p>

  <p>And not till they were out of the courtyard and well up the street, did
  Gregan Griffiths descend, and calling his man, set out in search of Captain
  Kristopher.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>VIII.&mdash;THE WHISPER</h2>

  <p class="first">Kristopher Fassiferne and Gregan Griffiths walked in the
  gardens of the Duke's Palace&mdash;some seven days after the latter's arrival
  in Brittany.</p>

  <p>Kristopher was in Prince Pierre's service now&mdash;to-morrow Gregan
  returned to England, his mission part fulfilled&mdash;part not.</p>

  <p>He had come to bring the money raised from the sale of an estate in France
  and consigned by his sister to Kristopher&mdash;he had also been entrusted
  with a packet of letters from Gilles&mdash;this part of his errand he had
  performed&mdash;what else he had come for, viz., to prevail on Kristopher to
  return to England, he had not fulfilled, and had argued and pleaded in vain.
  There was a dark blot on the fame of the Englishman, and Kristopher would not
  clear himself&mdash;would not listen to entreaty.</p>

  <p>They walked over wet leaves, under low trees, in the mist of late
  afternoon. Gregan looked at his companion's musing face, and spoke
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Five years&mdash;five years of exile, poverty, and disgrace&mdash;sure it
  is enough!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned on him fiercely:</p>

  <p>"You will be driving me mad with your talk&mdash;I say I'll not speak,
  will not shake off the beden I took up&mdash;and sure, I'll bear no
  more."</p>

  <p>Gregan made no reply&mdash;then after a while spoke again:</p>

  <p>"Have you seen <i>her</i>&mdash;since?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned eyes on him that were dark with passion.</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Diane," said Gregan. "Your wife."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Nor ever will?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>They walked on in silence, a glance at Kristopher's face told Gregan the
  subject was hopeless.</p>

  <p>The wind blew strong and cold beneath a sky that, pale and dear, stretched
  above the bare trees. Kristopher shivered and looked up.</p>

  <p>"An' I were free to go I could not," he said, "for I'm left in
  trust&mdash;an' a difficult trust."</p>

  <p>"Your honour is&mdash;as ever, fantastic," said Gregan.</p>

  <p>"Just because I will be seeing no wrong done an absent friend? Sure I
  swore, Gregan&mdash;swore they should not steal his lady from Prince Gilles,
  an' it's not my sister's lord should be counselling the breaking of
  oaths."</p>

  <p>They had come to a pause at an old wooden seat, and sat there. Gregan
  rested his foot upon it, looking gloomily upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"An' the lady be faithful," he said, "there is no need for you to be
  watching and guarding her."</p>

  <p>"Sure, what is one faithful heart against a score of knaves? There is
  Montauban, lying to the Duke day and night&mdash;no letters coming from
  Gilles&mdash;no, I must stay in Rennes&mdash;till he comes back."</p>

  <p>"He hath been gone two months, and she is still betrothed to him."</p>

  <p>Kristopher looked round at Gregan and sighed.</p>

  <p>"But the Duke bath been closeted with Guy&mdash;he bath spoken to
  her&mdash;an' they do lie, Gregan They do lie!"</p>

  <p>"If she loved him, it would make no difference, Kit."</p>

  <p>Kristopher's face flushed scarlet under its freckles, and his blue eyes
  sparkled, he looked away through the trees and smiled.</p>

  <p>"But she doesn't," he said under his breath, "she cares nothing."</p>

  <p>Gregan looked at him, puzzled. Kristopher turned and laid his hand on the
  other's arm, and all the smile had gone from the blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"But I must be making her, Gregan, that's why I stay in Rennes&mdash;she
  shall marry Gilles&mdash;I have sworn it!"</p>

  <p>"And she?" asked Gregan.</p>

  <p>"Near two months have I been in Rennes," answered Kristopher, "an' seen
  her every day&mdash;but never&mdash;save the first time of her meeting has
  she spoken to me&mdash;I have no reason to doubt her."</p>

  <p>"Then how is it you know she does not care?" asked Gregan, as they turned
  in the path and walked slowly back.</p>

  <p>Kristopher shuddered, for the wind was keen and cutting.</p>

  <p>"There's some things one knows without telling," he said, "an' times when
  the eyes say more than the lips&mdash;an' yet&mdash;an' yet&mdash;it's
  praying for me you must be, Gregan."</p>

  <p>Gregan looked up, surprised, but Kristopher only looked back and laughed
  lightly.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later they stood in the Duke's presence chamber and, half
  hidden in a window embrasure, watched the crowd.</p>

  <p>Françoise de Dinan was there; she talked to Montauban, seated with her
  back to Kristopher, laughing.</p>

  <p>Beside her another lady, silent and grave, now and then gave furtive
  glances at Kristopher in the recess.</p>

  <p>This was Odalie de Merle, cousin to Duke and Comtesse de Verrandois.</p>

  <p>Françoise de Dinan was in a vivid pink and purple dress that eclipsed her
  companion's quiet green robe as her beauty did the other's pink and
  white.</p>

  <p>"Guy de Montauban is overmuch with Gilles' betrothed of late," said
  Kristopher quietly, but angered at Guy's smiling face; and then seeing the
  two, the Duke called Gregan forward in his peevish voice:</p>

  <p>"You are from England, Messire?" he said.</p>

  <p>Françoise turned and laid down the cards she held, and de Montauban looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"What of our brother Gilles?" said Françoise fretfully. "No news again
  this packet this business should be done and he back&mdash;<i>Morbleu</i>!
  how long he dallies What is the reason?"</p>

  <p>"Prince Gilles is a favourite at the English court, my lord," began
  Gregan.</p>

  <p>"A favourite!" The Duke interrupted him, stamping impatiently. "Aye, I
  know he is a favourite!"</p>

  <p>"A popular ambassador," murmured Guy with a smile.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! they love the envoy more than the mission&mdash;what say
  you, Messire, my brother's friend?"</p>

  <p>And the Duke turned with some malice to Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Françoise rose suddenly and moved from where she had been sitting.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Kristopher, smiling. "I should be saying he's been no
  success&mdash;recall him, my lord."</p>

  <p>Montauban looked at him, and in the slight pause awaiting his reply the
  laughter and the light whispers ceased.</p>

  <p>"'Recall' is strange advice from a friend," he said in a tone to sting
  Kristopher into retort.</p>

  <p>"The other's stranger from an enemy," cried Kristopher, "an' but a
  cloaking of ill deeds under fine words!"</p>

  <p>Reddening with peevish anger, the Duke turned:</p>

  <p>"My brother has no enemy here," he said.</p>

  <p>"Certainly no enemy," sneered Montauban, "but an unwise friend."</p>

  <p>Kristopher was angered. A long endurance of much slander of his absent
  friend broke suddenly in daring speech.</p>

  <p>"Honesty is not always wise," he said, with a flushed face. "What I said
  was true as it was hasty."</p>

  <p>The crowd about him tittered at his folly, and Montauban's laugh and the
  Duke's quiet sneer fired the Englishman still more. He stepped before them
  all and swore that neither the favourite nor his master should slander Gilles
  of Brittany while he stood there.</p>

  <p>"Your insolence," said the Duke, turning away with his hand on Montauban's
  shoulder, "will cover neither your faults nor Prince Gilles' failure."</p>

  <p>His tone was less than scorn: it was contempt and Kristopher laid his hand
  on his sword, words on his lips that uttered would have meant the end for him
  of liberty&mdash;perhaps life.</p>

  <p>But a soft touch caught his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Françoise de Dinan.</p>

  <p>As he turned she fell away again and no one could have said she stayed
  him, but with her touch, her look, all the mad impulse died out of Kristopher
  and his hand dropped to his side.</p>

  <p>Montauban seemed to ignore him, but still half waited, hoping to hear him
  utter the unforgivable.</p>

  <p>But Kristopher stood silent, bowed, and the Duke passed on.</p>

  <p>Then the crowd about the mad Englishman broke into open comment; some
  advised him that no folly of his could better the Prince's cause, others
  advised him to leave the Palace&mdash;and Rennes.</p>

  <p>But Kristopher heard them absently. He saw Françoise leave the audience
  chamber.</p>

  <p>Presently he too turned abruptly and made his way to a little armoury
  within the Palace where few came to trouble the solitary brooding: Kristopher
  had sought the place before.</p>

  <p>It grew near to dusk.</p>

  <p>Kristopher crossed to the one window that looked out on to the town, and
  as he stood there he shuddered like one rousing himself from sleep.</p>

  <p>"Leave Rennes," he muttered, "aye, I must leave Rennes&mdash;I dare not
  stay."</p>

  <p>It was not fear of the Duke nor Montauban that drove him to thinking how
  he might at once leave Brittany nor stay within the Palace another hour; they
  had left his thoughts long since.</p>

  <p>"A fool I've been!" he cried furiously, with a stormy face. "A fool to
  stay so long."</p>

  <p>But who would speak for Gilles when he had gone?</p>

  <p>That thought came as an added trouble, reminding him it was his duty to
  remain and see Françoise de Dinan keep her troth.</p>

  <p>The slight noise of a footstep, the sound of a closing door, made him turn
  sharply.</p>

  <p>It was Françoise. She stood against the sharp lines of the swords upon the
  wall, her eyes very bright and steady.</p>

  <p>Kristopher's thoughts leaped into a mad confusion, the mists seemed to
  thicken and gather about his sight as he waited for her to speak, his hand
  shut tight upon the window bar.</p>

  <p>"They have broken my betrothal," said Françoise, "they say he is a traitor
  and I may think no more of him&mdash;I came to tell you&mdash;as you are his
  friend."</p>

  <p>She spoke simply as if they were equals and knew each other well</p>

  <p>They were alone together for the first time, both were keenly aware of it.
  Kristopher looked at her before he answered, saw her averted face, the bend
  of her neck where the black hair lay, and how her bright gown heaved over her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"An' what did you say to them, my lady?"</p>

  <p>She was silent a while.</p>

  <p>"Montauban has the power," she said at last.</p>

  <p>Kristopher's eyes were on her all the time, he moved a little from the
  window, speaking in a very even voice.</p>

  <p>"Montauban! sure, I think it's you have the power&mdash;if you love
  him."</p>

  <p>Again she paused, still with her face away.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in him?"</p>

  <p>He made an impatient movement. "Believe!" he answered, his voice bitter.
  "Sure, I know he's true enough and noble&mdash;an' he trusts you as he does
  heaven&mdash;you an' me."</p>

  <p>"Montauban and the Duke think otherwise," said Françoise softly.</p>

  <p>"What they told you was a lie!" cried Kristopher fiercely. "But what
  matters it an' you love him?" and he laughed unsteadily, twisting the ends of
  his belt together.</p>

  <p>"He's true?" said Françoise in a strange voice.</p>

  <p>"You think so?"</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to swear to it?" asked Kristopher, facing her, "pledge my
  honour on his&mdash;would you believe that, my lady?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes, looking straight into his through the dusk.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to believe," she said, "I don't love him&mdash;and you know
  it."</p>

  <p>Straight as a sword thrust between them her quiet words tore down the veil
  and they stood face to face without disguise.</p>

  <p>Kristopher stared at her, the blood beating in his face.</p>

  <p>"You love me!" he cried suddenly. "By Heaven, you love me My French
  lily!"</p>

  <p>"You know it," answered Françoise, holding her hands out, her head lifted
  high. And you?</p>

  <p>"I!" cried Kristopher triumphantly, his whole face changed, "Oh! my
  dear&mdash;mine&mdash;mine! an' you love me?</p>

  <p>"You," she said trembling, "and only you."</p>

  <p>She pressed her face against the wall between the swords, and he caught
  her hands in his with a sudden laugh.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I've dreamed of this," he whispered unsteadily. "Of such utter
  happiness&mdash;dreamed it might happen to other men&mdash;but not to
  me&mdash;sure, not to me!"</p>

  <p>She felt his fingers close tighter round her hand:</p>

  <p>"How I love you, Françoise!"</p>

  <p>With a stifled cry she faced him and he drew her nearer passionately.</p>

  <p>"An' you know nothing of me," he whispered. "A soldier of
  fortune&mdash;an' you love me!&mdash;won't you say so again, darling? Won't
  you look at me&mdash;speak to me an' tell me you're mine, mine to all
  eternity, my love?"</p>

  <p>The dusk was the colour to them of flame and roses, she dropped her head
  on to his soldier's mantle, and shivered and sobbed for joy.</p>

  <p>"Darling&mdash;" said Kristopher again in his winning voice, clasping her
  close to him eagerly. "You cannot guess how I love you! My lily of
  France!"</p>

  <p>Laughing, in the very pride of delight, he kissed her fallen hair and she
  raised her head suddenly to look at him in a deep joy that found the silence
  as proud as triumphal music, the dusk as splendid as flashing gems.</p>

  <p>"That there should be such a thing as this in the world and I have not
  known it!" she cried, her face held high and through the dusk she showed a
  perfect harmony, fair as the first flush of roses on the ending of the
  spring.</p>

  <p>But Kristopher took his eyes from hers, and his hand from her shoulder so
  suddenly she fell back a step.</p>

  <p>Between them was a ringing of metal and a bronze shield fell forward from
  against the wall, caught by her dress as she had moved; it was Prince Gilles'
  shield, with his arms across the boss.</p>

  <p>With instinctive terror Françoise looked at Kristopher and he back at her
  with a colourless face.</p>

  <p>"Gilles?" he muttered, "Gilles?"</p>

  <p>"Gilles I that!" she cried passionately. "Would you put him between
  us&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"Now," answered Kristopher. "Now&mdash;between us&mdash;now
  an'&mdash;always!"</p>

  <p>She stared at him incredulous, then broke into weak and desperate
  laughter:</p>

  <p>"You almost made me believe you loved me," she said. "And then you speak
  of&mdash;Gilles&mdash;who will find ten loves to love him before he stops to
  wed the one. Gilles, a simpleton!" She came near, her hands clenched tight,
  her eyes full of passionate appeal that belied the defiance of her words.</p>

  <p>"Simpleton?" echoed Kristopher, wildly. "Aye, fool an' treble
  fool&mdash;for he trusted me!"</p>

  <p>"Must you remember that now?" asked Françoise trembling. "Remember it when
  you and I stand here&mdash;together?"</p>

  <p>"Remember it!" cried Kristopher. "Why did you tempt me with your fair face
  ever to forget it? Oh, Françoise!" he added with a passion that made her
  cower, "we're standing at Hell's gates, you an' I."</p>

  <p>"Kristopher!"</p>

  <p>She came to him, still with that wonder in her face.</p>

  <p>"Call me knave and coward," said Kristopher hoarsely, "for it's both I am
  an' worse&mdash;I was his friend." He leaned against the wall, his blue eyes
  wide open, and Françoise stood motionless and dumb before what she did not
  understand, yet with a sense of bitter anguish struggling for words.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave Rennes," said Kristopher suddenly, with a great effort. "I'll
  leave Brittany."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" cried Françoise sharply, then her tone fell into utter misery.
  "You mean you'd leave me&mdash;when&mdash;I love you!"</p>

  <p>"I mean there's all the world between us," answered Kristopher and he
  paced the room in a storm of passion, "just lies an' cowardice an' treachery.
  I mean I've been a cursed madman to say what I did to you, to dare to look at
  you&mdash;isn't it a deed a man would scorn to kill another for?"</p>

  <p>The gloom whirled round Françoise, as if in a dream she saw the pale arc
  of the window and the dark line of the man's figure as he passed and repassed
  it in his swift strides.</p>

  <p>Slowly she sank from heavy leaning on the wall to her knees, motionless
  under the crossed swords.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave Rennes," said Kristopher again. "Forgive me an' forget me for
  a miserable coward!"</p>

  <p>And she heard him turn toward the door: as he opened it, she turned her
  head slowly.</p>

  <p>"I think you've broken my heart," she whispered.</p>

  <p>In a second he was back beside her; the open door clicked to.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my darling!" he cried, with a catch in his voice and lifted her up
  with strong hands that shook. "It was my fault&mdash;mine&mdash;I could but
  love you, dear, seeing you&mdash;it was my fault&mdash;I can only leave you
  as all honour stands between&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she slipped from his grasp, and dropped her head against the wall,
  catching at the cold armour rather than at him.</p>

  <p>"It's a thing that can't be," continued Kristopher, stumbling over his
  words. "It Can't be&mdash;it's hate we should build on lies&mdash;not
  love&mdash;don't you see it, Françoise?" he caught her hands in his
  eagerly&mdash;"Don't you see it?"</p>

  <p>But this appeal met with no response in Françoise's heart, a passionate
  denial was on her lips, but she did not dare voice it, did not dare say how
  little this talk of honour was to her.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see it?" cried Kristopher again, waiting in an agony for her
  answer. "Don't you understand&mdash;Françoise?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot even hear what you say," she answered, under her breath. "I only
  know you're speaking to me&mdash;touching me&mdash;that I love you."</p>

  <p>"Don't speak to me like that," cried Kristopher. "For God's sake!" He
  dropped her hands and moved back a step, struggling with his breath: "It's
  rather your curses an' your scorn I deserve," he said at last. "Give me those
  an' I can leave you&mdash;give me your hate&mdash;I must go."</p>

  <p>Françoise roused herself and, opening her eyes, faced the dark of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "Stay&mdash;and I will keep my word,&mdash;you shall not
  be dishonoured through me&mdash;I'll wait for Gilles of Brittany&mdash;if you
  ask it I'll marry him."</p>

  <p>"You would?" cried Kristopher, "you'd do that?"</p>

  <p>She saw her words had added to his love, his admiration, that this way she
  held him better than any other.</p>

  <p>"For your sake," she whispered, "if you ask it&mdash;Oh, but you must
  stay. I cannot do it alone&mdash;Kristopher, promise me you'll stay!" And she
  followed him to the window where he stood and, reaching her hands to his
  shoulders, looked up with brilliant eyes.</p>

  <p>"Promise me you'll stay!" she pleaded again; he could see the dim pink of
  the gown on her heart rise and fall, feel how she shook, and hear the tears
  hidden behind her tense voice. It put in him such a rage against himself,
  such a love for her, he came near to throwing all the world aside to hold her
  free from any touch of sorrow, but Françoise in her wild eagerness was
  waiting for an answer: "See, I'll do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;I will not
  speak to you, look at you&mdash;only know you're there&mdash;I'll not tempt
  you by as much as a smile&mdash;only you must stay&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I
  should die if you left Brittany&mdash;Kristopher you won't go&mdash;you won't
  leave me&mdash;you'll stay, Kristopher!"</p>

  <p>"I dare not!" he answered brokenly. "Ah, my darlin', I dare not!"</p>

  <p>And he tried to put her away, to blind himself to her thrown-back face
  outlined against the circle of the window where a pale moon hung.</p>

  <p>"For both our sakes," he said, but Françoise clung to him desperately, the
  heap of her black hair fell on to his arm, he could not help it that he
  stopped and looked down at her, that there was more triumph than horror in
  his face.</p>

  <p>"I bring half Brittany as my dowry," she said, "I should enrich a prince.
  Before the world I would give all this to you, give my life and count it
  joy&mdash;for you I would wed your friend&mdash;for you&mdash;and you, will
  you not stay for me&mdash;Kristopher&mdash;it is all&mdash;stay Ah, my love,
  stay!"</p>

  <p>She broke into a passion of shuddering weeping, hiding her face; she was
  wild as if it was her life she prayed for.</p>

  <p>Kristopher tried to speak, smote into deeper anguish at her tears, but she
  cried out through her sobs:</p>

  <p>"If I kneel to you!"</p>

  <p>The pride in Kristopher's face rose to exaltation, between great joy and
  great misery, half mad, beyond reasoning, nearer triumphant laughter than
  horror of what he did, he leaned forward and drew her to him, across Gilles'
  fallen shield and kissed her, on her wet cheeks and trembling mouth.</p>

  <p>Reality seemed to swoon away into the dusk of dreams, outside a bird
  called shrilly as birds will at dark, and for a long while they stood silent
  save for his heavy breathing, motionless save for her quiver under his
  arm.</p>

  <p>She feared to speak, lest this sweetness should vanish as a spell, and he
  could find no words that were not mockeries of the treasure of his joy.</p>

  <p>But at last the fear that had kept her silent found her words. At last she
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"You'll stay&mdash;now?" she whispered, looking up into his blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"I cannot choose," whispered Kristopher. "I'll stay,
  darling&mdash;Françoise, sure I can't reason on it&mdash;I'll stay."</p>

  <p>The bird called again, flying across the window, and Françoise, drawing
  herself away, gave a trembling laugh under her breath, staring through the
  dark. She cared for little else, she was not fearful of the future if he
  stayed in Rennes, there was pure joy in her heart and ecstasy tempered by no
  regret.</p>

  <p>"My love," she said very softly. "Mine&mdash;" and when he came forward to
  where her dim figure stood, she laughed again, passionately, and was gone,
  leaving the door open on a flood of light.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX.&mdash;A PROMISE</h2>

  <p class="first">A low, mean house in a narrow, squalid street in Rennes.</p>

  <p>It was evening, a chill stinging rain had fallen all day, and in this
  house, old and ill-built, it dripped through the cracked roof and slimy
  walls. Only in the larger lower room was there a light and a fire, and there
  the window was shutterless and hung across with a soiled yellow satin skirt;
  only dirty rushes covered the floor. On a long rickety bench were some torn
  clothes, various half-broken pots and a bundle of sticks.</p>

  <p>In front of the fire sat Denise, beside her a torn tambourine and flute, a
  greasy dish and a pair of tawdry shoes. A faded scarf was tied round her
  hair, and she was whitening her face and arms before a cracked mirror,
  shivering the while in her pinched red finery. It was not rare for these
  three vagabonds to be reduced suddenly from a fine appearance to open
  squalor; this old house was a favourite haunt of theirs when fortune played
  them as ill a turn as she had done now when she cast Yvonne-Marie in their
  way&mdash;Yvonne-Marie, their sister, who at first sight of them had at once
  told their travelling companion, Valerie Estercel, their true character and
  her own story.</p>

  <p>Disappointed of any hope of money from Sir Valerie, the three were reduced
  to their last resource&mdash;but they were still clever rogues with many
  friends among the scum of Rennes&mdash;and not alone did they retreat to
  their hiding-place&mdash;Valerie Estercel came with them&mdash;as a prisoner,
  and Yvonne-Marie, if not as a prisoner, by force.</p>

  <p>The brothers moved about the room silently. Eneth in a ragged,
  parti-coloured tumbler's suit, Esper tuning a flute. Huddled in one corner,
  sitting motionless, staring with bright eyes through tangled locks was
  Yvonne-Marie.</p>

  <p>Presently Denise rose, twisting some faded velvet flowers in her hair, her
  eyes weary, and sullen lines about her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Yvonne," she said. "Yvonne-Marie!"</p>

  <p>Her sister looked up defiantly, as if she knew what the other would
  say.</p>

  <p>"I'll not come with you," she answered. "I'll not come."</p>

  <p>Esper, plastering a hole in the wall up with a handful of rushes, rooked
  round at them.</p>

  <p>"Go supperless then," he sneered over his shoulder. "Starve&mdash;you
  fool!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie laughed, pressing her hands to her head.</p>

  <p>"I shall not need lack of food to kill me," she said, "an' I will not
  dance and sing for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your repentance comes late, my fair saint," said Eneth. "Why did you ever
  leave your convent an' you were so virtuous?"</p>

  <p>"With thoughts of atonement," she cried. "To find him we wronged so,
  Eneth&mdash;our souls are lost for what we did that year in England!"</p>

  <p>She stopped, choking, but her brothers only laughed and Denise stamped in
  a sudden fury.</p>

  <p>"Why did you cross our way again with whinings, and tears&mdash;and a
  pride that looks ill in rags, my sister?"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie moved from the wall slowly, her shadow thrown grotesque and
  huge behind her:</p>

  <p>"I did not wish it," she said slowly. "I tried to evade you&mdash;you
  followed me up&mdash;I could not help it."</p>

  <p>Esper laughed now, he had an unpleasant laugh and showed his teeth like a
  wolf:</p>

  <p>"Did we ask you, my sister&mdash;to tell Sir Valerie Estercel our
  quality?"</p>

  <p>His voice was rough and dangerous, but Yvonne-Marie only smiled
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but you asked me to help deceive him&mdash;and from the day I
  left England I vowed&mdash;no more&mdash;I've seared my soul enough, <i>Mon
  Dieu</i>! enough!"</p>

  <p>Sullenly she dragged herself to the fire and crouched there, huddling over
  the scanty flames.</p>

  <p>"Little enough Sir Valerie gains by your treachery," said Denise, drawing
  a ragged mantle over her finery. "And little enough you will,
  Yvonne-Marie."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to murder him?" asked her sister, dully, looking over her
  shoulder, her white face tinted red from the flames. "Or wait till he dies in
  his imprisonment?"</p>

  <p>"Do you intend to save him?" smiled Denise, extinguishing the lamp.</p>

  <p>"No," said Yvonne-Marie wearily dropping her head in her hands.</p>

  <p>"You stay with her, Eneth," said Esper, opening the door, his teeth
  chattering in the chill draught that swept in from the other room. "And look
  to the prisoner."</p>

  <p>The younger brother put his tambourine down, and seated himself in the
  corner with a shrug of his shoulders; watching his sister was the same to him
  as singing in the streets; he had always liked Yvonne-Marie, in his rough way
  he was sorry for her.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," he said gloomily, "an' you do not want me to perish of
  cold."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Yvonne-Marie!" said Denise, and the crazy door banged on
  them.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie leaned forward and raked the sticks together, then she
  glanced over her shoulder furtively at Eneth's silent figure.</p>

  <p>Presently she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Strange to think we should ever come together again, you and I!"</p>

  <p>It was too dark for him to see the fierce, hot anger in her eyes. He
  answered carelessly:</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he said. "Two of a trade&mdash;we are likely to meet!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie shuddered violently, a pinched-up figure outlined against the
  light.</p>

  <p>"Are you hungry, Eneth?" she said after a pause.</p>

  <p>"Hungry?" He laughed now, bitterly. "Aye, and thirsty&mdash;you fool to
  tell Sir Valerie&mdash;we might have been rich now!"</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> is at the court of Rennes," said Yvonne-Marie quietly, "I saw
  him to-day&mdash;he threw me a piece of money."</p>

  <p>Eneth stared across at her, blankly, through the shadowy room.</p>

  <p>"Who do you mean?" he asked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher," she answered, without turning round. "Isn't it
  strange&mdash;Eneth&mdash;strange!" And she laughed again, rocking to and
  fro.</p>

  <p>"And so he never told&mdash;" said Eneth after a silence. "And no one
  would believe now if he did&mdash;how many years ago, Yvonne-Marie?"</p>

  <p>"Five," she answered. "Five years."</p>

  <p>A long silence fell over them&mdash;once they heard footsteps
  overhead&mdash;the prisoner, Sir Valerie Estercel.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Yvonne-Marie looked round, and put her hand to her breast.</p>

  <p>"You are hungry," she said, "go and get some food, Eneth "&mdash;and she
  held out a couple of silver coins on the palm of her hand. She had this much
  of her sister's art that she could conceal under indifference her great
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Her brother snatched them eagerly, with an angry reproach.</p>

  <p>"An' we starving!" he cried. "But I can't leave you," he added
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie smiled, it seemed as if her long waited-for chance had come
  at last.</p>

  <p>"I'll look after the prisoner," she said. "Go and get the food,
  Eneth."</p>

  <p>He was hungry&mdash;he did not credit her with any desire to free Sir
  Valerie and his weakness made him desperate, but he was careless mainly
  through an indifference that cared little what she did.</p>

  <p>"I'll lock the door on you," he mused cunningly&mdash;"Lock you
  in&mdash;the two of you."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie, crouched with her chin on her knees, made no reply, looking
  sullenly into the fire till she heard the key turn in the outer door and she
  was alone. It was almost dark&mdash;worse than dark with tall, waving shadows
  and black recesses.</p>

  <p>She rose slowly, chilled and weary, the footsteps overhead had ceased, the
  fire rose and fell in the gusty draughts and outside the rain beat.</p>

  <p>There was no other sound&mdash;a painful stillness. Yvonne-Marie opened
  the door and looked into the pitch black.</p>

  <p>It was like the dwelling-place of thieves, dismal and evil. She closed the
  door, again leaning against the wall, the dark filled with fire and leaping
  before her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Kit&mdash;my beautiful Kit!"</p>

  <p>She was in another world, there was a gulf between them nothing could
  bridge&mdash;not even her great love, it seemed to her, and the tears rolled
  down her face.</p>

  <p>She stood a moment bent with misery, then gathered herself together,
  wiping her eyes hurriedly.</p>

  <p>In the dismal red lights of the fire, leaping up, leaping down, she found
  her mantle and put it on, then drew from her dress a little crucifix and
  kissed it humbly, going on her knees beside the dismal hearth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marie!" she whispered weakly. "Marie, have mercy!"</p>

  <p>She was dizzy with weakness, it cost her an effort to rise and mount the
  stairs to Valerie Estercel's room, her head reeled and her hand clasped tight
  over the crucifix, trembled.</p>

  <p>"Sir Valerie," she called; even to herself her voice sounded very faint.
  "Sir Valerie!"</p>

  <p>Instantly the door was opened and Valerie Estercel came on to the head of
  the stairs, peering through the dark; his room was never locked, but with a
  guard ever below this had availed little till now.</p>

  <p>"It is your chance," said Yvonne-Marie, trembling the more she heard of
  him. "Our chance&mdash;I am alone&mdash;I've got Esper's key&mdash;come down,
  Sir Valerie."</p>

  <p>In a second he was beside her and the two moved toward the door and the
  firelight.</p>

  <p>"You mean, you've come to save me?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned her head away in bitter shame.</p>

  <p>"Save you!" she echoed, then after a second, "what you must think of
  us&mdash;of me!"</p>

  <p>She had told him everything when she first fell in with her brother again
  and him, deceived, in their company; she had disclosed their true character
  to him and her own story, and when they, before he could profit by her
  warning, had made him a prisoner in this hidden part of Rennes, she had done
  all in her power to save him. But face to face with Valerie her little
  courage fled; she felt shamed to the very dust before this man who had once
  thought so well of her.</p>

  <p>"'Tis not in my power, to think ill of you," answered Valerie gravely. "As
  I believed you before I believe you now&mdash;and honour you, Madame."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie looked round quickly, wistfully into his white face and eager
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she faltered. "I&mdash;I&mdash;am leaving
  these&mdash;to-night, I will set you free&mdash;then go back, I have my
  friend waiting for me at our old lodging&mdash;I managed to send to her
  yesterday&mdash;and you&mdash;you will in charity
  forget&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You? What then?" asked Valerie, looking at her steadily. "You will go
  back to your old lifer Madame?"</p>

  <p>Again Yvonne-Marie gave him that swift, piteous glance.</p>

  <p>"I can trust you," she said faintly. "I know it, Monsieur&mdash;but
  you&mdash;dare I ask you&mdash;I have no right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Madame," interrupted Valerie, an agony of pity and love behind the
  stateliness of his manner, "if you have ever held me worthy of one
  thought&mdash;I pray you let me serve you."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie, steadying herself against the wall, glanced at him in a
  great gratification, then her tired face flushed hot.</p>

  <p>"I am ill, I think," she said. "I've been ill for days&mdash;I have just
  strength enough to get away from here&mdash;Monsieur, you will take me to
  Héloïse&mdash;and then&mdash;" She stopped a moment, looking at Valerie, her
  cheeks scarlet. "If I am very ill&mdash;like to die," she continued, with a
  great effort, "I want you&mdash;in your great charity,
  Monsieur&mdash;toto&mdash;go to&mdash;my husband&mdash;and&mdash;and bring
  him to me&mdash;he might come, you see, if I was dying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Valerie was dumb in the great sorrow and pathos of her words, he felt
  tears choking him, blinding him, but Yvonne-Marie, seeing him silent, flushed
  still deeper, misreading him.</p>

  <p>"You see, Monsieur," she said tastily, as if in excuse, "I have no
  friend&mdash;and I thought&mdash;that is I hoped&mdash;I dared to dream he
  might come if&mdash;if you asked him&mdash;if I was ill and
  helpless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He <i>shall</i> come!" burst out Valerie suddenly. "Sainte Marie! He
  shall!"</p>

  <p>"He is gentle," she answered with her head low. "He will&mdash;yet swear
  to me not to bring him&mdash;lest I am like to die."</p>

  <p>"If you wish," cried Valerie, his eyes glittering with impatience. "But
  why not now? <i>Mon Dieu</i>! What have you done you have not atoned
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she whispered. "Promise me!"</p>

  <p>"But he would come&mdash;I doubt not he loves you&mdash;I do not dream he
  has forgotten!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned such bright, glowing eyes to him&mdash;her whole face
  lit up so at the mere words that Valerie could not bear to look at her and
  read how she loved another&mdash;a curious rage against this other took hold
  of his soul&mdash;"He shall come," he vowed in his heart. "He shall
  come."</p>

  <p>"If I might think it," she said with a little gasp. "I gave up that
  dream&mdash;so long ago! Yet if he should come&mdash;and&mdash;if he should
  have&mdash;cared&mdash;all along&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&mdash;if it should
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the firelight Valerie Estercel saw her face for one instant flushed and
  smiling, then as the flame faded leaving them in the dark she caught his arm
  with sudden energy, throwing open the door.</p>

  <p>"You've promised?" she asked, feverishly. "If I am like to die and not
  else."</p>

  <p>Not till they had traversed the dark passage and reached the outer door
  did Valerie answer and then he spoke very low:</p>

  <p>"If I can best serve you so," he said. "I will swear it."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie's hand was on the latch, she had unlocked the door, she
  looked over her shoulder to where she knew he stood and answered with a
  wistfulness in her voice that made him glad of the dark that hid her
  face.</p>

  <p>"God bless you, Sir Valerie&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am very
  grateful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He made no reply but again he vowed silently&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He shall come&mdash;he shall forgive her&mdash;" for more and more his
  love and pity for her grew&mdash;more and more his increasing wrath against
  her husband.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie waiting, touched his arm again timidly.</p>

  <p>"Eneth will be back," she whispered. "And you have no sword."</p>

  <p>The wind had risen, they could hear it blowing high without and feel it
  holding the door against their efforts like a live thing.</p>

  <p>At last Valerie with a sudden wrench tore it open. "Jesu!" he cried with a
  great start and Yvonne-Marie echoed the cry, falling back a step.</p>

  <p>A man in a traveller's mantle stood in the doorway holding the reins of
  the horse he had just dismounted.</p>

  <p>He was not in the least disconcerted by this sudden appearance before he
  had knocked, or astonished at their surprise. Utterly ignoring Valerie he
  looked at the woman's cloaked figure.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Denise?" he said, and his insolent, affected voice fired
  Valerie into instant reply.</p>

  <p>"Neither Denise nor, any concern of thine&mdash;let us pass."</p>

  <p>The stranger surveyed him from his great height and laughed, making no
  attempt to move.</p>

  <p>"Where is Denise?" he asked, still with his eyes on Yvonne-Marie, and she,
  schooled all her life to fear and obedience, came forward fearfully with an
  eager desire to speak him fair.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she began. "Denise is not here&mdash;" She got no further, the
  stranger bent forward and pushed her hood back from her face with the stock
  of his riding-whip, then fell back laughing again.</p>

  <p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> the truth for once," he cried. "Then since Denise is not
  here&mdash;I may not stay one instant!"</p>

  <p>And he mounted his horse before Valerie, who had stepped forward
  furiously, could interfere.</p>

  <p>"Peace&mdash;for our lives!" whispered Yvonne-Marie, staying her
  companion, and to the horseman she said aloud, "Monsieur&mdash;whatever your
  errand, Denise is not here or like to be to-night."</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind her as she spoke, locking it while Valerie
  Estercel looked at the stranger with his hand where his sword should have
  been and doubt in his face. It had ceased to rain, the stars were out and the
  wind as it blew high caught the horseman's mantle showing the splendid
  embroidery, purple and green, of the satin he woke underneath and the gold
  work on his white gauntlets.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Dieu!</i>" he said, after another glance at them, as curious as
  they gave him. "If Madame Denise could not wait no more can I&mdash;give you
  good even."</p>

  <p>He pulled his large hat off with a certain mock courtesy that made Valerie
  flush with anger and Yvonne-Marie tremble with fear.</p>

  <p>The lantern hanging above the door sent its light full over his face as he
  turned away slowly, a face with thick, red curls hanging about it, rouged on
  the cheeks, a face that was perfectly handsome, insolent, and arrogant in
  every line, a face that repelled Yvonne-Marie utterly and made her drag
  Valerie away.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid, <i>ma petite</i>?" asked the horseman with an unpleasant
  smile that showed large white teeth behind his full red lips. "With such a
  gallant cavalier?"</p>

  <p>He turned his red-brown eyes for the first time on Valerie and touching
  his horse up suddenly, in a second was gone.</p>

  <p>Now the way was free before them Valerie seized her arm and started at a
  swift pace they did not relax, and in a tense silence they did not break,
  till they had reached a wider, more reputable street where, freed from
  immediate fear of pursuit, they paused.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Mon Dieu</i>!" said Yvonne-Marie weakly. "That man&mdash;if he
  should find Denise and tell her of us&mdash;who was he? Do they not say the
  Devil comes in such a guise&mdash;bedizened like a woman&mdash;with such a
  smile?"</p>

  <p>"They dare not on their lives pursue us," answered Valerie, then stopped
  aghast, to find she leaned against the house beside them, sobbing.</p>

  <p>"I am weary," she whispered. "Oh, so weary&mdash;that man who knew
  Denise&mdash;<i>my</i> sister&mdash;Oh, Sainte Marie, the shame of it I And
  yet&mdash;" she lifted her head, stifling her tears back with a piteous
  bravery. "Yet I am <i>his</i> wife&mdash;you will remember?"</p>

  <p>And before he could answer she began to talk feverishly, hurriedly of
  other things, their present safety and the way before them, and Valerie,
  quick to understand, responded to her change of tone gravely, choking back
  the great desire he had to comfort her passionately.</p>

  <p>She walked very quickly and eagerly though she shook from head to foot and
  her lips trembled as she faltered out her gratitude, and her piteous trouble
  at the burden she had been to him.</p>

  <p>"I thought I was beneath pity," she said. "You have heartened me with the
  hope I am not beneath&mdash;forgiveness&mdash;liking. God bless you, Valerie
  Esterce!"</p>

  <p>Valerie turned and looked at her half seen, half hidden in the
  starlight&mdash;he was quiet, almost holding his breath that he might hear
  hers coming and going, walking softly that he might catch the light sound of
  her feet, and behind his silence love, pity, and a deep anger grew into, one
  great resolve. Suddenly, at a low door she stopped and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Promise me," she said, "out of your gentle courtesy&mdash;you will not
  trouble him by any hint of me unless I am like to die&mdash;then&mdash;if he
  could forgive."</p>

  <p>Through her soft hair she smiled, and her hand fluttered in his. "You
  would know the house?" she questioned. "You would come and ask for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Valerie Estercel, very low, and at the sound of his voice
  the anxiety faded from her weary face, she knocked lightly and drew her hand
  away, then as the door opened quickly, sending yellow light across the road,
  Valerie stepped back into the shadow to hide his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Héloïse!" cried Yvonne-Marie in a broken voice. "I have come
  home!"</p>

  <p>It was the last sight he had of her, as she always remained in his memory,
  in the candlelight, with drooping head and pitiful eyes, searching for him in
  the dark. But, leaning heavily against the wall, he made no movement, no
  reply to her timid farewell, and the door closed on them, leaving it again
  dark.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X.&mdash;THE WOOING OF MONTAUBAN</h2>

  <p class="first">In the brightness of a winter morning, Françoise and Odalie
  wandered away from the Duchess and her ladies, far into the palace
  grounds.</p>

  <p>The Lady of Dinan was not thinking of her companion, her head was upheld
  proudly, her eyes looking ahead and shining.</p>

  <p>"Odalie," she said suddenly, "do you think Gilles be true?"</p>

  <p>Odalie looked up.</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said. "And so, Françoise, do you."</p>

  <p>Françoise shrugged her shoulders, smiling oddly.</p>

  <p>"They say he has sold his country&mdash;the Duke and Guy&mdash;no letters
  come&mdash;why should I not believe it true?"</p>

  <p>The colour was flushing into Odalie's fair face.</p>

  <p>"You know it false," she answered. "In your heart you <i>know</i> Guy lies
  and he is honourable&mdash;you said so."</p>

  <p>Françoise looked at her smiling, her eyes defiant. "It rests with me to be
  convinced, Odalie."</p>

  <p>The Duke's cousin clenched her hands tightly in her fur dress.</p>

  <p>"To say you are convinced or no&mdash;to take advantage of another's
  falsehood or no&mdash;you said you knew they burned the letters."</p>

  <p>"Put it as you will," smiled the Lady of Dinan. "It rests with me."</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle was silent.</p>

  <p>They had reached a little cluster of trees that fringed a sloping hollow,
  near which grew a great beech, the silver trunk, shining like polished metal,
  splashed with dried brown moss. A pile of logs lay close and Françoise seated
  herself on them.</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle came close, half timidly with frightened eyes, and spoke
  very low.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to marry Guy de Montauban?" Françoise looked up swiftly,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"No, <i>m'amie</i>&mdash;three times no!"</p>

  <p>"Are you going to keep your troth to Gilles?" said Odalie, still with that
  startled look in her face, and with lips that trembled.</p>

  <p>"You are very serious," answered Françoise, with a slight mock in her
  tone. "What can it matter to you whether I do or no?"</p>

  <p>Odalie flushed crimson.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she answered in the same tone. "Nothing&mdash;only&mdash;it
  seems a dreadful thing&mdash;when there is none to speak for him&mdash;that
  you should forget."</p>

  <p>"Now must your tender soul be doing penance for my sins?" smiled the Lady
  of Dinan. "Content yourself, Odalie. I will weep for my own falsehoods."</p>

  <p>Odalie turned away sharply, and Françoise turning too, noticed people
  coming through the trees.</p>

  <p>"My suitor and his tools," she said and laughed again, folding her hands
  in her lap.</p>

  <p>The two were a great contrast, side by side in the calm sunshine.
  Montauban, coming toward them, thought so and his heart leaped and warmed to
  Françoise's beauty&mdash;it was not only the lands of Dinan he was wooing
  now.</p>

  <p>From head to foot Françoise was in blue; a sapphire blue velvet lined with
  violet, her little gauntlets were ermine, her hood, her shoes bright gold,
  she leaned her head against the smooth trunk behind her and smiled.</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle seemed commonplace by comparison.</p>

  <p>Guy de Montauban, coming nearer, smiled too. "I have been looking for you,
  Madame," he said, and as he spoke Odalie de Merle moved away quickly, the
  distress in her face deepening, but Françoise only turned her head.</p>

  <p>"By what right, Messire?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Because you left me this morning before I had finished&mdash;because it
  is my fate to seek you and follow you, my Lady of Dinan."</p>

  <p>Françoise glanced round to see Odalie walking away with the Duchess and
  her ladies.</p>

  <p>"You are going to say the same thing, Sieur," she said&mdash;"and&mdash;so
  am I."</p>

  <p>"I do not lack courage," he answered. "In such a cause&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The winning of the lands of Dinan," said Françoise rising. "For me you do
  not care&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Madame&mdash;I love you!"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur! I am betrothed!" And she laughed, dimpling her face.</p>

  <p>"That was long since broken&mdash;" cried Guy, raising his eyes, "formally
  broken by the Duke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What care I for the Duke? It rests with me, Messire."</p>

  <p>"Madame&mdash;Gilles is a proved traitor."</p>

  <p>"If I believed, Messire," answered Françoise. "It would make no
  difference&mdash;and I do not."</p>

  <p>He was maddened by her smile and tone, baffled by what seemed her caprice,
  he kept his voice even with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"You do not care for Gilles, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"Did I say so?&mdash;does it follow I must care for you?"</p>

  <p>He came nearer, controlling himself&mdash;he had thought to win her in two
  weeks and two months saw him still unsuccessful, and memory of this came to
  him, stinging.</p>

  <p>"You are playing with me, Madame&mdash;and why? I can make you greater
  than he could&mdash;I can offer you everything pride can ask&mdash;it is the
  Duke's will&mdash;nay, the Duke's command, and this man, whose idle troth you
  keep&mdash;you do not care for&mdash;and he is proved unworthy!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with smiling eyes.</p>

  <p>"How unworthy?"</p>

  <p>Guy flushed and spoke passionately. "All Rennes know his letters few!"</p>

  <p>"But they show him loving&mdash;those few!"</p>

  <p>"Pierre even no longer believes in him!"</p>

  <p>"Pierre is nothing to me." She moved further away but Guy came after her
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Françoise! you madden me&mdash;what whim is this constancy&mdash;or is it
  something more than a whim?"</p>

  <p>There was a challenge in her eyes as she looked straight back at him, that
  put a new anger and some fear into his voice.</p>

  <p>"It is something more."</p>

  <p>She drew one of her gloves off and looked at Gilles' ring on her white
  finger, then she laughed, and a certain insult in the action stung Guy into a
  great anger.</p>

  <p>"Who is it you do love?"</p>

  <p>She quailed ever so slightly under his gaze, and drew her skirt away.</p>

  <p>"Not you, Messire&mdash;and more, you have no right to ask."</p>

  <p>But the lightness had gone from her tone, and she flushed faintly. Guy
  noticed it in added rage:</p>

  <p>"There is one you would break your troth for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Their eyes looked straight into each other.</p>

  <p>"Has Kristopher Fassiferne been pleading his friend's cause?"</p>

  <p>At this sudden, unexpected mention of his name, the colour flew into her
  face and she faltered in her answer for all her pride.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Montauban looked at her keenly.</p>

  <p>"It were better not to say what I mean," he said, all gentleness gone from
  his voice. "I have no wish to anger you&mdash;what I think shall remain in my
  thoughts&mdash;only&mdash;had not you better be careful&mdash;you
  and&mdash;Captain Kristopher?"</p>

  <p>For a second she hesitated in her reply and he thought she was going to
  strike her glove across his face or answer in great anger, but when she did
  speak it was with a smile:</p>

  <p>"If you were not my very good friend," she said, "I might be angered,
  Sieur&mdash;as it is&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! I only wonder what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Shall I put it more clearly?" asked Montauban. "My meaning&mdash;the
  meaning of your refusal?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Françoise swiftly. "I think&mdash;you had
  better&mdash;not."</p>

  <p>Montauban was not afraid she did not understand, he felt he had the
  mastery over her, it was she who was baffled, startled now, he who had the
  strength of a great and bitter rage.</p>

  <p>"We will speak no more of it," he said quietly. "I think you see now I am
  not utterly blind, not utterly&mdash;a fool&mdash;I think you see too,
  Madame, that you will be my wife and that there are things my future wife may
  not do."</p>

  <p>"I am Gilles' betrothed," answered Françoise, her anger rising too. "You
  cannot make me forget it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Montauban smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"And you cannot use his name as a shield much longer&mdash;shall I be the
  only one to see and talk? Gilles of Brittany is very fortunate, Madame, both
  in his betrothed&mdash;and in his friend."</p>

  <p>"I can have no answer to any of this," she replied, biting her lip.
  "Nothing to say to what you have no right to ask&mdash;as for your
  insults&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;do not understand them."</p>

  <p>They looked at each other with angry eyes, then Françoise turned away
  without a word and Montauban made no attempt to follow her.</p>

  <p>Steadily she walked on over the dead leaves, her heart in a tumult,
  unheeding of the broken boughs and the swift birds startled at her
  approach.</p>

  <p>Looking back once she saw Montauban was hidden from view in the trees and
  with a sigh she seated herself on the twisted roots of an elm, dropping her
  head in her hands.</p>

  <p>A footstep fell sharply on the dead sticks and she looked up swiftly to
  see Kristopher Fassiferne coming through the beeches, a hound in a leash
  beside him. As he stopped suddenly at sight of her she rose against the tree
  and smiled, but Kristopher stood where he was, motionless.</p>

  <p>"Won't you speak to me?" whispered Françoise. "It is so long since you
  spoke to me."</p>

  <p>"It does not need for words," he answered looking at the ground, "between
  us two&mdash;speak to you!&mdash;haven't I been getting courage to speak to
  you&mdash;to say farewell?"</p>

  <p>Françoise came a step toward him in swift terror, thinking of Montauban's
  words.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" she said. "Do you mean to leave me to do
  it&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>"I mean I must leave Rennes&mdash;I'm sinking lower every day I stay,"
  said Kristopher, still with his face away. "It's not in the compass of things
  we&mdash;we&mdash;should go on like this."</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" repeated Françoise, "what do you mean? Am I not doing
  what you bid me&mdash;what I said I could not do alone?"</p>

  <p>"Gilles must come back," said Kristopher. "It's the only
  thing&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>A helpless, miserable fear came over Françoise that he had heard
  something, that Montauban had spoken to him as he had to her, that he was set
  on leaving her for all she could say.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid?" she said bitterly. "Afraid of Montauban&mdash;a court
  spy? Oh, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! you cannot love me, then&mdash;I am afraid of
  nothing but of seeing you leave my sight!"</p>

  <p>"Afraid?" echoed Kristopher. He turned and looked at her with sombre eyes.
  "Yes, I'm afraid&mdash;afraid of Montauban, afraid of every menial in the
  palace that looks at me, afraid of myself&mdash;of you&mdash;afraid of Gilles
  of Brittany as of God!</p>

  <p>"Then you do not love me," said Françoise, coming a step nearer with a
  white face. "You never did&mdash;or&mdash;you&mdash;are tired of me."</p>

  <p>There was no sincerity in her words, he knew it and laughed, almost in
  anger.</p>

  <p>"That's my greatest fear," he said. "I'm afraid of lovin' you too
  much&mdash;an' you know it, Françoise."</p>

  <p>She stood silent, looking at him eagerly. Montauban's taunt lay heavily on
  her heart, how his name had been flung at her, she dare not tell him what
  Montauban knew or guessed&mdash;she had nothing to say to combat this
  resolution that would take all her happiness from her, she could not tell how
  well he read her and she dreaded to lose him too much to declare her real
  sentiments.</p>

  <p>"I'll marry Gilles," she said feverishly. "I'll keep my
  troth&mdash;indeed&mdash;only stay at Rennes&mdash;just that one thing, stay
  where I may see you." She had come close and laid her bare hand on his
  sleeve, her face pleading as a child's and he, lifting his head, seized her
  hand in his with a sudden passion and anguish that made her tremble.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what you're asking," he cried. "You don't realise what it
  would mean&mdash;you don't see the end&mdash;the inevitable end&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A passionate response rose to Françoise's lips&mdash;she longed to cry out
  she cared for nothing, honour, shame, another's pain, nothing&mdash;but
  looking into his strained blue eyes she dare not.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand?" he continued desperately, almost fiercely.
  "Françoise, Françoise! don't you see what's before us&mdash;that it's just
  the impossible we're tryin'&mdash;deceivin' ourselves, hidin' wrong with
  smooth names! Can we go on lookin' at each other as if there were nothing
  between us&mdash;Afraid!&mdash;aren't you afraid, Françoise?"</p>

  <p>"Of nothing but of losing you," she answered, her blood beating fever-high
  with the mad hope she might yet win him to forget his honour for her sake. "I
  care not what any may say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," interrupted Kristopher passionately, taking her
  hand from his arm and moving away.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I can let you be slandered because of me, the Prince laughed
  at, and&mdash;Oh, there are evil tongues endough in Rennes, and enemies
  enough who'll seize the slightest breath&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! Montauban has been speaking to you," cried Françoise,
  betraying herself in her fear.</p>

  <p>"Montauban?" asked Kristopher sharply. "God in Heaven! What does he
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;" she answered faintly. "Only I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me the truth," interrupted Kristopher. "What has he said to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," whispered Françoise trembling. "Nothing&mdash;he is ever
  hounding me, but he said nothing of you, nothing&mdash;don't go for
  that&mdash;stay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no movin' my mind, Françoise," he answered looking at her full.
  "Though I must go&mdash;Heaven can't stop me&mdash;or you&mdash;even
  you."</p>

  <p>Françoise drew herself straight in her velvet mantle, stung by desperate
  grief into cruelty.</p>

  <p>"Where will you go?" she said with flashing eyes. "Who has caught your
  fancy now&mdash;or will you go back to&mdash;your wife?"</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had been mentioned between them, and Françoise
  herself was startled at the sound of her own bitter taunt, all her anger died
  into shame at the sight of his blanched face.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;have deserved&mdash;even&mdash;that," he said huskily and
  turned his head away. "Though&mdash;maybe&mdash;it's you don't know what
  power you have to hurt me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Françoise burst into wild, sudden tears, crouching down on the elm roots,
  her bright gown shaken over with dead leaves.</p>

  <p>"You make it very hard for me," said Kristopher after a pause.</p>

  <p>She glanced up to see he looked at her yearningly and with a great effort
  caught her sobs back. "<i>I</i> will go," she said. "<i>I</i> will leave
  Rennes&mdash;to wait for Gilles, you shall stay and I will go&mdash;Oh,
  <i>Mon Dieu!</i> I would not be cruel, dishonourable, I will keep my
  troth&mdash;have I not said so? I will leave Rennes to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Where would you go?" asked Kristopher. "No&mdash;'tis my part to
  leave."</p>

  <p>"You must stay in Rennes&mdash;" she answered desperately, "are you not
  his friend&mdash;all he has to speak for him?&mdash;you must
  stay&mdash;<i>I</i> will go."</p>

  <p>He came a step nearer to where she sat and the hound whined
  restlessly.</p>

  <p>"'Tis your wish?" he asked, fingering his sword-belt.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I would be free of Montauban&mdash;of it all," whispered
  Françoise quickly, rising. "I shall go to Chateaubriand till Gilles
  returns."</p>

  <p>Her bare hand was against the rough elm bole and Kristopher leaned and
  kissed it where it lay.</p>

  <p>"God be with you&mdash;my dear, dear lady," he said very low,
  "an'&mdash;an' forgive me if you may."</p>

  <p>Françoise shivered, pausing a moment to choose her words and temper them
  with quietness.</p>

  <p>"If he&mdash;Montauban&mdash;follows me, if I am in trouble&mdash;if I
  need you, send for you&mdash;you will come? you are the only thing in the
  world that cares for me," she added quickly, piteously. "As Gilles' friend
  you'll come?"</p>

  <p>The hound ran between them, thrusting his muzzle into Kristopher's hand, a
  little wind swirled the leaves round, then Kristopher lifted his blue eyes
  and answered.</p>

  <p>"If you need me&mdash;I'll come."</p>

  <p>A moment more and she was alone, watching his figure disappear through the
  trees.</p>

  <p>"Need you!" she cried aloud. "Oh, my love, need you!" She dropped her head
  against the tree and burst into hysterical laughter and sobs, more proud than
  sad, joyous than agonised, she set her teeth in the black hair blown across
  her face and clenched her hands tight, shaking from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"You <i>shall</i> come!" she cried, lifting her fair face to the blue sky,
  "you <i>shall</i> come to me!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI.&mdash;THE SENDING OF THE LETTER</h2>

  <p class="first">More rumours, more insolent letters, had completed the
  Duke's dislike of his brother&mdash;it was easy for Guy to deceive one so
  willing to be deceived, to manage one so completely his tool, and, in the
  pure truth of it, Gilles had had no success in his mission, he had written to
  ask for his recall, and <i>that</i> letter Montauban had not destroyed, but
  given to the Duke and dictated the answer&mdash;that Gilles was not to set
  foot in Brittany till his mission was accomplished&mdash;and the penalty
  would be the penalty of treason.</p>

  <p>"In a month she shall be my wife," said Guy, "and the Prince may return
  for the wedding."</p>

  <p>Françoise had been at Chateaubriand for some days and the Duke sent
  Montauban red-hot after her to take up his residence at Konkorgas, a little
  chateau belonging to the Duke not half a mile from Chateaubriand. Montauban's
  squire and confidant had a pretty acquaintance with most of the rogues in
  Rennes and some knowledge of those three who called themselves
  D'Estoutevilles. His master being in need of such&mdash;they were taken into
  Guy's service, outwardly as servants, in reality as tools in the winning of
  Françoise de Dinan and her lands.</p>

  <p>This evening, after Prince Gilles had been gone from the shores of
  Brittany near three months, this cold, dull evening in January, Françoise de
  Dinan crept up to her chamber, silently&mdash;she had dismissed her women,
  their talk, the sight of their faces was a pain to her. Alone, the lamp in
  her hand, she entered the room.</p>

  <p>Since she had first been dazzled and intoxicated by her great love, this
  was the first time she had reflected&mdash;thought of the future; here,
  alone, things that had seemed dim and unreal in Rennes with Kristopher before
  her, seemed living and close now, and the sacrifice she had promised so
  easily&mdash;impossible.</p>

  <p>The room was sombre and silent, she hung the lamp on the wall with a
  shudder, thinking of Hardouinaye.</p>

  <p>The long windows were all curtained from the winter night, there was not a
  breath of wind; she closed the door and came to where the great logs
  smouldered on the hearth; her footstep, the rustle of her gown seemed to
  break the perfect stillness painfully, and many things, confused by day,
  seemed clear now.</p>

  <p>The future!</p>

  <p>Françoise leaned her aching head against the chimney-piece and faced
  it&mdash;at first she had not thought or cared in the pride and glory of her
  love, the one knowledge that he returned it filled her world&mdash;but
  now&mdash;she looked ahead with frightened eyes, her courage sinking&mdash;if
  she was true, if she gave him up and waited&mdash;what would it mean? a gray
  life&mdash;on the horizon no hope&mdash;and Kristopher&mdash;she might never
  see him again, but have to act the lie she had first smiled to Gilles to the
  end.</p>

  <p>She had no mercy on her own weakness, her own soul&mdash;she had no honour
  and knew it, she had tricked her betrothed into loving her for her own
  ends&mdash;she had cheated, schemed, and lied to become a Princess, to shine
  at Rennes, to be rich.</p>

  <p>Torn out of her heart into the light it was nothing more, and she could
  not complain of injustice, what she had asked had been given&mdash;and she
  wanted none of it&mdash;only this one thing she had never reckoned on or
  known of&mdash;love.</p>

  <p>Flinging herself down beside the bed, she buried her face in the rich
  coverlet, crouching, afraid&mdash;for&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He thinks me honourable&mdash;he loves me because he does not know!"</p>

  <p>And of all her bitter thoughts that was the bitterest&mdash;he did not
  know.</p>

  <p>With a little gasp she laid her head against the bed&mdash;thinking of the
  armoury in Rennes and his kiss&mdash;he loved her! he loved her! Her whole
  soul rebelled, her whole heart cried out&mdash;"I cannot do it! I will
  not!"</p>

  <p>There was his wife&mdash;these lonely days she had often thought of her
  with wonder, scorn, maybe, but never jealousy, she was not afraid of any
  rival in Kristopher's heart&mdash;she thought of her now, as another
  barrier&mdash;but she might be dead, and if she lived&mdash;such a marriage
  was as thistledown&mdash;she would make him clear his honour and her power
  would cause Rome to free him from his wife&mdash;it was no real obstacle, in
  her eyes&mdash;neither was Gilles&mdash;the only thing was&mdash;his honour.
  She went to the window, with an unsteady hand drawing the curtains, leaning
  her sick head against the mullions.</p>

  <p>The still country&mdash;overlooking Dol and Bàrrès&mdash;lay dark under a
  darker sky. Then as she stood there, silent, a faint sound broke the silence,
  and she opened the window, startled. It was a man singing.</p>

  <p>Françoise took the lamp and carried it to the window, holding it above her
  head, so she stood full in light.</p>

  <p>Along the path beneath came another light, held steadily&mdash;a man on
  horseback it seemed carried it.</p>

  <p>The country was desolate&mdash;Dol some miles away. Françoise wondered,
  drawing back a little&mdash;she thought of Guy&mdash;but it was not his
  voice.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Canst thou hear me, love,<br>
  Through wind and rain,<br>
  Where the broken poppy curtsies, love,<br>
  To the elder in the lane?<br></p>

  <p class="poem">"Canst thou see me, love?<br>
  Through the storm and the night,<br>
  Where the bruised grass is weeping, love,<br>
  And the marsh flare is bright."</p><br>

  <p>The voice was low and soft. Françoise put down the lamp, but did not shut
  the window&mdash;the circle of light below moved steadily on, she was sure
  she had not been seen.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Oh, love, my own love!<br>
  The may is all torn,<br>
  The lilies have died in the breath of the wind,<br>
  But here's a rose, and a red rose<br>
  A harbour shall find!"</p>

  <p>The jingle of the horse bells ceased, the rider suddenly raised the
  lantern and she saw his face, a laughing face, framed in dark red curls, and
  before she could draw back he had flung something up at her, and ridden on,
  laughing.</p>

  <p class="poem">"The snow lies heavy, love,<br>
  On flowers 'neath our feet&mdash;<br>
  Still one red rose, love,<br>
  Till next we meet."</p>

  <p>Françoise pushed the window to, and picked up what he had thrown&mdash;a
  full red rose&mdash;a Fresh rose in January&mdash;a rose the colour of
  blood.</p>

  <p>She stared at it, then looked again out of the casement for the
  singer&mdash;but he had gone&mdash;it was perfectly still again and icy cold,
  she seemed frozen to her heart, hardly conscious of pain only great
  weariness. She put the rose in water and extinguished the lamp, standing
  shivering in the dark, then heartsick she threw off her heavy garments and
  lay down on her bed.</p>

  <p>How silent it was, silent with a great loneliness, neither the wind to
  murmur nor the rain to splash&mdash;from the curtained bed she could not even
  see the stars, quite still she lay with wide eyes looking into the darkness,
  her hands clasped tight under her cold cheek&mdash;then her hushed breathing
  was broken with sobs and she hid her face in the lavender pillow.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Kristopher! I want you! I want you!" Her thoughts stung her into
  restless movements, she rose and looked at the stars again, longing for the
  dawn, longing too, perhaps, for that singer to return.</p>

  <p>She stood silent a long while&mdash;till the light came and the room grew
  dully light, then she threw her embroidered robe around her and seated
  herself in the black chair by the dead embers. The day gave promise of rain,
  the sun rose pale, swimming in a watery mist, torn gray clouds floating about
  it, the light in the chamber was very faint and cold, filling it with a
  ghostliness little less sombre than the dark.</p>

  <p>Sitting in her chair, Françoise caught sight of her face in the mirror
  opposite; she looked hardly beautiful now, with swollen eyes and her locks
  hanging lank round her pale face. Impatient of herself she rose and bound her
  hair up, bathed her face, then returned to her seat, sitting miserably quiet,
  with lifeless hands, while the gray light strengthened into white, and the
  sun trod down the clouds, rising higher, floating in faint pink.</p>

  <p>A bird called shrilly under the window and the sound roused Françoise; she
  went to the table under the window, as a faint ray of sunlight fell across
  her face, then faded again as the clouds once more overcame the sun.</p>

  <p>Slowly she drew a parchment out, spreading it on the table with a great
  flush beaming in her cheeks, and eyes sparkling. Panting she wrote in the
  indistinct light.</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;for I need thee." Then she added, hesitatingly, "For Gilles'
  sake."</p>

  <p>"Françoise de Dinan."</p>

  <p>She folded the letter, but hesitated over the seal, started to tear it
  across, then looked up and saw the great red rose staring at her.</p>

  <p>It was like a live thing&mdash;something as terrible as
  beautiful&mdash;something, Françoise thought, evil, but she laughed&mdash;"A
  wandering troubadour!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>XII.&mdash;THE TEMPTATION OF CAPTAIN KRISTOPHER</h2>

  <p class="first">It was afternoon of the next day, and she stood in the great
  hall of her château. He had come&mdash;come at once&mdash;they told her he
  was below and she waited for him, looking out of the window with unseeing
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Françoise wore an orange gown furred with white, opening on to silk the
  colour of a daffodil, and round her right wrist a bracelet fashioned like a
  snake in gold. She moved to the fire, looking dazzlingly bright, and turned
  away from the door as she heard footsteps and the arras drawn aside.</p>

  <p>The door closed softly and Françoise shivered in her satin, there was a
  sense of cold, of winter brought into the warm room, she kept her eyes on the
  fire, and the flames swam before her like a molten sea.</p>

  <p>"I've come," said Kristopher, "I've come, my lady."</p>

  <p>The red rose stood near her, she raised her eyes to it, and a second time
  it gave her courage.</p>

  <p>"I could not rest without you," she said rising. "I could not do what you
  asked me&mdash;and so&mdash;I sent for you&mdash;and so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He came up to the fire, standing facing her.</p>

  <p>"You mean you'll break your word?" he said under his breath, playing with
  his sword hilt, with his trick of twisting his fingers in the leather.</p>

  <p>The sight of him, the sound of his voice was a mad pain to her.</p>

  <p>"Is that everything to you?" she whispered. "That I should keep my word to
  Gilles of Brittany?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher laughed, sadly.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it just everything, my lady? Your honour and mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Françoise rose, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He started at the new note in her voice and raised his ardent blue eyes,
  his whole face lit by the firelight.</p>

  <p>"I am not honourable," went on Françoise. "Do you really know me? Do you
  know that I deceived Gilles?"</p>

  <p>She broke off abruptly, her eyes on his face.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Kristopher. "Before I saw you I knew."</p>

  <p>A great joy leaped into her face. "It makes no difference?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher grasped the wood-carving tight.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in heaven or earth makes any difference&mdash;it's not virtues or
  beauty makes love, my lady&mdash;but the one soul and the one face&mdash;and
  the heart that's yours, and the eyes that look different on you, and the
  mouth that trembles at your goin', that's love, my lady, and when you're free
  to speak it&mdash;it's heaven, too&mdash;just heaven&mdash;and when there's
  all the world between just honour and faith and all that's right
  between&mdash;it's just hell! my lady, hell!"</p>

  <p>He turned from her, leaning his head in his hands on the mantelpiece, and
  a great triumph and pride came over Françoise to see him so moved.</p>

  <p>"This is the right," she said softly, "as God's laws are above men's
  laws&mdash;so is love above honour&mdash;must we slay our souls for a
  shadow&mdash;for a light promise&mdash;Oh, no! no cannot ask it&mdash;want
  it&mdash;" Lightly she laid her hand on his sleeve, but as he raised his head
  at the look in his eyes she shrank and blanched.</p>

  <p>"Gilles," he said with difficulty&mdash;"my friend&mdash;whom I swore to,
  vowin' my honour, believin' me, trustin' me now&mdash;what of that&mdash;Oh,
  God in Heaven! what of that?"</p>

  <p>"To-day it is you and I&mdash;Kristopher&mdash;you and I alone."</p>

  <p>The strong, upleaping light was over them both, she leaned nearer, her
  mouth a-tremble, and he winced beneath her touch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear heart!" he murmured, "you don't know how hard it is for me."
  Then he turned suddenly, taking her hand, his blue eyes dark with pain.</p>

  <p>"It's my friend and&mdash;my wife."</p>

  <p>"Your marriage is as thistledown!" she cried passionately. "You fear her
  shame&mdash;putting her before me&mdash;the woman who could
  do&mdash;that."</p>

  <p>"She is my wife," said Kristopher miserably, "and God help me! truer in
  her love than&mdash;I am&mdash;what right have I to judge&mdash;who once
  loved her&mdash;she was but a tool!"</p>

  <p>"You can think of her&mdash;now!" Françoise drew her hand away, the orange
  and daffodil heaving on her heart.</p>

  <p>"And 'tis but a word&mdash;tell the world what she is&mdash;and your
  marriage is nothing&mdash;believe Gilles the traitor he seems and your word,
  my word is nothing!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher drew himself up, the blood beating in his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I know Gilles honourable," he said brokenly. "An' because it's easy to
  think&mdash;him other&mdash;sure, I should be vile indeed&mdash;to
  pretend&mdash;for mine own ends&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;she was my
  wife&mdash;an' her treachery mine&mdash;an' I took it&mdash;shall I expose
  her when it suits me? Drag her in the dust&mdash;now? Oh, sure&mdash;you
  would not wish me as low&mdash;as that!"</p>

  <p>Françoise was silent, crouching in the chair, her dress crushed in her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"And Gilles trusted me," he continued. "An' I've never lied yet&mdash;my
  lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Françoise, "you do not love me! You put others before
  me&mdash;you do not love me!" And she rose suddenly, facing him. "You are
  bound in bonds of straw and you will not break them for me&mdash;Oh! you do
  not love me!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher stepped nearer, but she fell away, weeping, brilliant as a
  summer marigold in the fireglow.</p>

  <p>"Higher than the highest imaginings I love you," said Kristopher, leaning
  forward, "an' my love is of that quality I may not dishonour it, makin'
  something low an mean out of something so beautiful&mdash;an' it's you see
  it&mdash;in your own dear heart&mdash;my soul's love!"</p>

  <p>But she looked up frightened, trying to speak, her face white, her eyes
  glittering with tears.</p>

  <p>"You'll do it!" said Kristopher passionately. "An' I&mdash;sure&mdash;we
  could not love so much an' be unworthy!"</p>

  <p>"'Tis for all our lives, Kristopher!" cried Françoise desperately. "To
  part&mdash;for&mdash;all our lives!"</p>

  <p>"'Tis our souls," he said, "for all eternity!"</p>

  <p>"I care not," she cried. "If my love is a crime I will take the
  punishment."</p>

  <p>A mad exultation rose in Kristopher's heart, he, too, felt reckless for
  the future, regardless of his soul, the honour he talked of was a dead thing
  too&mdash;she alone sitting white&mdash;for his sake was real.</p>

  <p>"If I might have died before I saw your sweet face&mdash;and so spared
  your tears now!"</p>

  <p>"Would you leave me, <i>bien-aimé</i>? Tread on what loves you so? See,
  nothing in all the world matters&mdash;only this&mdash;I love you! I love
  you!"</p>

  <p>He was on his knees beside her chair, the room had grown dim to both of
  them.</p>

  <p>She bent and kissed his hair&mdash;the low head by the carved dragon of
  the arm. The fire had died down, but was strong enough to show where his hand
  rested on the crimson cushion, and the curve of her lips.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a flushed, passionate face.</p>

  <p>"Françoise...my love...my beautiful love..."</p>

  <p>"Ask me to marry Gilles of Brittany now," cried Françoise proudly, leaning
  from the silk cushions, so near their cheeks almost touched, then Kristopher
  rose suddenly, staring at her.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I ask you."</p>

  <p>He gave a pitiful little laugh&mdash;it was so dark&mdash;she could not
  see&mdash;but she thought she heard him sob...</p>

  <p>"God forgive me&mdash;and you...I'm going..." She sat frozen, seeing him
  move away.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher! who do you think will benefit by this?&mdash;A-ah!...it will
  not be Gilles!"</p>

  <p>She sprang up, stumbling forward and caught his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Fare thee well&mdash;my lady," said Kristopher tenderly, and he put her
  from him on to the crimson cushions.</p>

  <p>The door closed&mdash;softly&mdash;she heard it, the fall back of the
  arras and his light footstep.</p>

  <p>How cold it was! She shuddered violently, staring dumbly in front of her,
  then moved slowly, groping in the half dark.</p>

  <p>Her dress caught the table near and something was hurled to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>On the hearth lay the crimson rose.</p>

  <p>She picked it up and thrust it passionately out of sight, then drew
  herself suddenly straight like a hunted animal that hears the hounds.</p>

  <p>Some one was opening the door and as she saw who entered she burst out
  fiercely, for it was Guy de Montauban.</p>

  <p>"How dare you force yourself on me!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you refuse me?" he answered, coming forward. "Françoise&mdash;I
  met the Englishman coming from your presence."</p>

  <p>He had come on her in a moment when his knowledge of her was like a whip
  in his hands to cow her and the sense of it made her wince.</p>

  <p>"I will ride after him," he said, after waiting in vain for her answer. "I
  will tell him you are my betrothed wife."</p>

  <p>Again he paused, again she was silent.</p>

  <p>"There must be an end of this," he went on. "You are behaving
  foolishly&mdash;is the fellow worth it?"</p>

  <p>Françoise said something under her breath. "You do not understand," she
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"I will go after Captain Kristopher, and tell him so," said Montauban
  grimly.</p>

  <p>Then Françoise suddenly turned like one goaded beyond bearing.</p>

  <p>"Tell him what you will! I am weary of it all," she said fiercely. "There,
  take Gilles' ring&mdash;show your Captain Kristopher&mdash;say I am to be
  your wife&mdash;say I hate him&mdash;only go!"</p>

  <p>She slipped her betrothal ring from her finger and thrust it into
  Montauban's hand, who looked at her earnestly a moment.</p>

  <p>"You mean this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>And without another word he turned and closed the door sharply on her dim
  seen figure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>XIII.&mdash;THE BETROTHAL RING</h2>

  <p class="first">Kristopher Fassiferne rode back to Rennes, through rain and
  a fine chill sleet, when suddenly he was aware another horseman was following
  him&mdash;sharply he drew rein and as the other neared, he recognised Guy de
  Montauban, smiling, smiling still more at sight of him, and stopping too,
  gaily:</p>

  <p>"Captain Kristopher," he cried. "Do you remember our last ride?"</p>

  <p>"I have a good memory for a knave's face," said Kristopher recklessly.</p>

  <p>Montauban laughed.</p>

  <p>"Remember you what I said?"</p>

  <p>"What I would not recall, nor, for shame, should you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said I would win the lady without your&mdash;or any aid&mdash;Messire,"
  said Montauban.</p>

  <p>Their horses were close together, Guy's face leaning close to
  Kristopher's. "And you&mdash;Messire&mdash;said 'No'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And say it again," said Kristopher fiercely. "I say it's true to the end
  she'll be."</p>

  <p>"She is my promised wife," said Montauban, "with her own lips she has
  consented."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie!" cried Kristopher hotly, then he laughed, "an' sure&mdash;a
  poor lie."</p>

  <p>"It is the truth," said Guy with sparkling eyes. "And to-morrow all
  Brittany shall know&mdash;see this&mdash;Messire, to prove it."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and on the open palm was a pearl ring&mdash;Gilles'
  betrothal ring. Kristopher knew it at once, that very day he had seen it on
  Françoise's finger, and he started and flushed enough to gratify even
  Montauban's spite.</p>

  <p>"Take this as double proof," he continued. "That Françoise de Dinan is
  beyond your meddling, and that I will sweep you from Brittany as I did from
  Rennes!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Kristopher. "Sure, you're a low, mean knave, Sir Guy&mdash;an'
  what I said&mdash;I say again&mdash;she shall not be your wife."</p>

  <p>Swiftly he leaned forward and seized Montauban's hand in his, there was a
  moment's struggle, but a moment only.</p>

  <p>"You churl!" cried Guy furiously, caressing his bruised fingers, but
  Kristopher slipped Françoise's ring into his doublet.</p>

  <p>"Will you fight for it?" he said furiously. "Here and now?"</p>

  <p>"Give me that ring," said Montauban. "Are you a common robber as you are a
  common traitor?"</p>

  <p>In the light of the swinging lantern, Kristopher looked grimly
  threatening&mdash;in spite of his bold words Montauban drew back and
  Kristopher laughed in his face, with inflamed features.</p>

  <p>"A cold night for long converse&mdash;get you to bed, Montauban, when she
  is your wife I will give you the ring&mdash;an' sure I'll leave
  Brittany."</p>

  <p>He touched his horse up and passed on, leaving Guy silent. Kristopher rode
  furiously, madly, not knowing it was cold and raining, not caring it was
  dark.</p>

  <p>"So she would not keep her troth&mdash;she would fling herself away on Guy
  in her anger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He felt for her ring, drawing it out, and his eyes lit and sparkled.
  Surely he had done enough&mdash;fulfilled his vow, he could no longer keep
  her true&mdash;he would help his friend no more and what mattered it to
  Gilles who supplanted him as long as he lost her?</p>

  <p>Reining up his horse, he stopped, looking back through the night, panting,
  holding the ring tight.</p>

  <p>"They are but bonds of straw," he whispered eagerly. "She said
  so&mdash;even now I might go back&mdash;I might go back."</p>

  <p>The cold wind blew through his ruffled hair and against his hot cheeks, he
  lifted the little ring to his lips, struggling with himself.</p>

  <p>He might send to Gilles&mdash;tell him of this thing, bring him back, he
  could easily send&mdash;none knowing there was Robin, his man would go, in a
  week Gilles might be in Brittany.</p>

  <p>That was the right, what he must do&mdash;Gilles must return, he urged his
  horse on again, not daring to look back, the chill rain stinging his
  face.</p>

  <p>As he neared the city the day broke, wet and gray, in the early light the
  wide gates were distinguishable ahead of him, and almost without knowing it
  he slackened his pace.</p>

  <p>Once inside Rennes, once Robin was charged with that message, the thing
  was done and she lost irrevocably, again he drew the ring out, looking at it,
  at her name and Gilles' intertwisted inside the circle, and still with it in
  his hand rode through the low arch into the still sleeping street.</p>

  <p>His horse, wet and jaded, moved wearily and Kristopher looked back over
  his shoulder again and again with set teeth and a face flushed at the
  baseness of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Into the courtyard of the house where he stayed he rode, rebellious at
  heart, forgetful now of Gilles and that other, dead or alive in France,
  thinking of Françoise left in Chateaubriand.</p>

  <p>He stabled the horse himself, then waited, in the courtyard, leaning
  against the house front, tracing pattern with his sword point, till the place
  should be astir. Following the whole miserable thing out in his mind, he
  could see Gilles would be kept in ignorance till all was over, he alone, of
  all Brittany would send him word of this treachery&mdash;it was his trust, on
  him would be the burden and the shame and it could be done easily enough, had
  there been no other motive in his heart, he would have done it&mdash;without
  question&mdash;at once.</p>

  <p>He turned to the house to wake Robin but did not, wandering restlessly to
  the stable instead, looking at a fresh horse there, asking himself
  fearfully:</p>

  <p>"What if I never send&mdash;if I rode back even now?"</p>

  <p>Presently came Robin, whistling merrily, and Kristopher started at sight
  of him, guiltily, following him into the house, talking of indifferent
  things, saying nothing of that journey to England.</p>

  <p>"I will speak of it later," he said to himself, pacing about restlessly,
  but the time went by and he did not, and the more he delayed the more
  difficult it grew, again and again her words occurred to him: "They are but
  bonds of straws!"</p>

  <p>Robin, moving to and fro, glanced at him curiously, more than once,
  surprised at his restlessness, at his start and flush when spoken to and his
  absorbed silence.</p>

  <p>Again Kristopher turned to speak&mdash;again he said nothing and let Robin
  leave the room.</p>

  <p>And now, the first doubt crept into his heart, his faith in himself was
  shaken, neither his pride nor his honour satisfied him, what had been his
  standard all his life seemed swept away, right and wrong grew strangely
  confused, passionately he rebelled against it all, crying out in his heart
  with the recklessness of passion, for her, only for her, forgetful of the
  past and future, his pride lowered to heedlessness of his name, his honour
  lowered to the forgetfulness of all faith. The evil had entered his soul,
  with the first hesitation a barrier had been removed, and a thousand devils
  rushed into his heart.</p>

  <p>"I will go back," he said. "I will go back."</p>

  <p>In the stable he found the horse still, and saddled it himself, his face
  flushing hotly as Robin entered to help him, and across his wild thoughts
  came the recollection of where Robin should be&mdash;on the coast by now.</p>

  <p>But he said nothing, mounting and riding away fiercely; what was in his
  heart he hardly knew, he could think of nothing clearly, he had no plan for
  the future&mdash;he was simply riding back to her&mdash;to save her from
  Montauban. Furious with himself, abashed and yet triumphant. The gray old
  street was very quiet, the sound of voices singing in a little church near
  the gate the only sound. The music inflamed Kristopher's eager soul the more,
  it exalted, intoxicated him, lifting his action and his love higher, for a
  moment blinding him to himself.</p>

  <p>The sun parted the clouds, shining brightly, full on the old gates and
  Kristopher's blue mantle, he could have sung aloud, joined the rich hymn,
  laughed&mdash;as he passed the gates his eyes were bright to madness, he
  lashed his horse up, thinking no more of turning.</p>

  <p>"One rides after you, Messire," said the watchman, as he opened the
  gate.</p>

  <p>"'Tis none I will heed," cried Kristopher with a sudden, wild smile. "Let
  me pass, for sure&mdash;for nought will I stay."</p>

  <p>He was forcing by impetuously when the man stopped him again.</p>

  <p>"He calls after you, Messire."</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned impatiently, a single horseman was riding up the
  street.</p>

  <p>"Captain Kristopher!" he cried, urging his horse faster and soon came up
  to him, white-faced, panting.</p>

  <p>"Sir Valerie Estercel!" said Kristopher, until this very moment he had
  forgotten his very existence, given him no thought since they last
  parted.</p>

  <p>"Aye, Valerie Estercel," returned the other. "Where ride you, Captain
  Kristopher?" His great eyes devoured his face eagerly and Kristopher's
  flushed scarlet.</p>

  <p>"On mine own errand," he cried with defiant eyes.</p>

  <p>"Whatever it be you must back with me," said Sir Valerie, laying his hand
  on the other's arm in his eagerness. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! How I
  have sought for you!"</p>

  <p>"Sought for me?" answered Kristopher proudly. "Now I know not for
  what&mdash;but I must on, Sir Valerie."</p>

  <p>"All honour demands your return," said Valerie Estercel sternly, and
  Kristopher knowing his journey known to himself alone was startled and
  angered, thinking the Frenchman's head turned with his romantic follies, and
  chafing at the delay he strove to pass, but a second time Sir Valerie laid
  his hand on his bridle demanding his return, till Kristopher came near to
  shaking him off furiously.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Valerie wildly, bitterly, in his childish manner. "Throw me
  off&mdash;you have the power and the cruelty of strength I Yet hear me first
  you shall."</p>

  <p>Kristopher controlled his rising anger, interrupting abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Sir Valerie&mdash;you are but a child, meddle not with things past your
  understanding&mdash;I must ride on&mdash;at once."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Sir Valerie with blazing eyes, "I must say what I would have
  spared you&mdash;here."</p>

  <p>Something in his face struck Kristopher: "What do you mean?" he cried with
  a sudden pang, and put his hand to his forehead, being sore bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Your wife is in Rennes," said Valerie Estercel, quivering with anger.
  "Your wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher dropped his reins, staring, and Valerie drew back from his
  white face&mdash;clasping his hands like a child in distress.</p>

  <p>"My wife!...My wife...Diane?" said Kristopher, faltering in his speech.
  "It is...it is...not possible, I have no wife now."</p>

  <p>"She is in Rennes," said Valerie Estercel, "ill unto death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher put his hand out swiftly, stopping him, his whole bearing
  changed.</p>

  <p>"It is not possible," he said again, under his breath with trembling
  lips.</p>

  <p>Valerie turned his horse's head.</p>

  <p>"With thine own eyes see," he said. "For two years she has sought for
  you&mdash;escaping from her prison to find you."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" muttered Kristopher, drawing himself up, staring at Valerie with
  unseeing eyes. "To find me&mdash;Diane&mdash;to find me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you come now&mdash;shall she lie there with strangers to tend
  her?"</p>

  <p>The colour spread over Kristopher's face slowly&mdash;he never moved his
  wide eyes&mdash;there was horror in them and utter woe.</p>

  <p>"How may I tell this is the truth?" he said with painful effort.</p>

  <p>The gatekeeper, standing waiting during their low conversation, came
  forward now, asking whether he should close the gate&mdash;and Kristopher
  turned sharply, looking at the road, beyond the road that led to
  Chateaubriand.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said slowly. "I shall not ride from Rennes sure&mdash;not
  to-day."</p>

  <p>At these words, Valerie leaned forward, but Kristopher drew back, touching
  up his horse.</p>

  <p>The harsh closing of the gate sounded behind them and they rode back
  through the streets of Rennes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>XIV.&mdash;A TOAST</h2>

  <p class="first">Kristopher sat in the parlour of the little house where
  Valerie Estercel had brought him.</p>

  <p>Upstairs was his wife and Odalie de Merle&mdash;her charities were well
  known in Rennes and she visited Yvonne-Marie as she visited all the sick in
  need.</p>

  <p>He had seen her, and it did not help to make his position the more
  bearable that she, Françoise's friend, was there to wonder who this woman was
  Valerie Estercel had left to his care, left in his hands proudly, with no
  word uttered as yet of the rage in his soul.</p>

  <p>Yesterday when Kristopher had come and looked at his wife she had made no
  sign of gladness, shrinking away, like a dog afraid of the lash, hiding her
  face, and he recalled the gesture now, sickening at his heart.</p>

  <p>Last night, in his agony, he had resolved this should make no difference,
  that he would not forsake Françoise, that Yvonne-Marie should bear her
  punishment to the end, but now, he had grown afraid and dared not, for the
  high courage of a stainless purpose was gone from him, he could not deal with
  his wife as he had done, for in thought if not in action he was as low as she
  and his motive as ignoble as hers had ever been.</p>

  <p>And Françoise&mdash;what of her? He could not trust himself to think of
  her, he could not bring himself to resign all hopes, fiercely he chafed
  against what kept them apart, miserably he saw he could not in honour break
  the barriers down, and so he sat, till his heart was numb with a great
  weariness.</p>

  <p>The sun crept round till it lay on the table and over his bent head, a
  footstep sounded outside and he roused himself, rising to his
  feet&mdash;desperately. There was no more time to be given to thought, he
  could not sit still and let things drift&mdash;something must be
  done&mdash;something.</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel entered suddenly, and the sight of him added to the
  anguish of Kristopher's indecision, it was one more stab to his pride that
  this stranger he had smiled at knew his story, but he spoke gently, keeping
  his eyes away.</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you, Sieur&mdash;yesterday I&mdash;I&mdash;you left too
  soon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Valerie said nothing and Kristopher hesitated a second, grasping the chair
  back tight, then lifted his eyes, like a dumb animal's in their misery, and
  spoke again with an added pride in his voice: "An' with my thanks, Sir
  Valerie, I have to say this matter hath grown beyond any meddling...it is
  mine own affair..."</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel, leaning with his back against the door, made no sign of
  moving though he read his dismissal clearly enough in Kristopher's words,
  there was no colour in his face, and his eyes were swollen as with
  weeping.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" he asked, trembling, clenching his hands.</p>

  <p>Kristopher, sunk in his distracting thoughts again, started at Valerie's
  tense voice.</p>

  <p>"I have said," he answered flushing. "It is mine own affair."</p>

  <p>But Valerie was blinded by unreasoning rage and the infatuation of his
  fantastic devotion. He broke out passionately:</p>

  <p>"You have not answered me&mdash;what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"What right have you to ask?" cried Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Valerie began to speak, but broke off, staring dumbly&mdash;it had not
  struck him before Kristopher might not know&mdash;might not have remembered
  that confidence in the wayside inn and understand.</p>

  <p>He could not say what was on his tongue. Kristopher's frank eyes abashed
  him and he stood silent, raging inwardly.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;hath thought fit to confide in you," went on Kristopher slowly.
  "An' for what you did you have all the gratitude that can be&mdash;but with
  what I may do no man shall interfere."</p>

  <p>Valerie was bursting out beyond control&mdash;passionately&mdash;when
  Kristopher broke in angrily.</p>

  <p>"An' were you not a child, Sir Valerie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, but you shall hear," cried Valerie, trembling with the force of his
  words. "I credited you with honour and mercy and justice and&mdash;I say I
  will not&mdash;I will not see a woman die sacrificed to your pride."</p>

  <p>"You talk of what you know not," said Kristopher sternly. "Get you gone
  before you anger me," and he turned his back. But Valerie had no thought of
  going, he was not confused by many views, he gave no thought to the man's
  pain, there was one thing only in his mind&mdash;Yvonne-Marie.</p>

  <p>"Go to her," he said&mdash;"tell all Rennes she is your wife or&mdash;you
  are unworthy of an honourable name."</p>

  <p>"I seek to satisfy myself, not your standards of honour," answered
  Kristopher, with his back to Valerie. "An' once more&mdash;begone."</p>

  <p>Valerie drew himself up proudly.</p>

  <p>"She confided in me&mdash;I will be worthy of it&mdash;I'll not
  go&mdash;she hath gone through misery and want, she hath tasted of the
  deepest bitterness. She hath near died of weariness of soul&mdash;seeking for
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how dare you!" cried Kristopher suddenly. "How dare you!"</p>

  <p>He turned and faced Valerie, who shrank away, his voluble words dying in
  his throat at the bitterness and the anger in the other's face.</p>

  <p>"I' faith you've said enough&mdash;you've dared enough," said Kristopher.
  "Think you it's you can interfere&mdash;you?"</p>

  <p>Valerie glanced at him standing close, quietly, proud and strong, and
  faltered almost to tears.</p>

  <p>"She will die! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! she will die of your hate!" Kristopher
  flushed, suddenly motionless&mdash;What if she did? In his soul he knew he
  wished it.</p>

  <p>Valerie moved from the door miserably silent, taking no heed as Kristopher
  passed him, making no reply as Kristopher spoke.</p>

  <p>"It's no good you can do here, Sir Valerie. What is it to you whether my
  wife dies or no?"</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel was silent, making no movement. Kristopher waited for him
  to speak, regarding him steadily, then left the room.</p>

  <p>He could hear voices outside&mdash;among them Odalie de Merle's. He
  mounted the stairs quickly, his blood at fever heat. Valerie's hysterical
  words, motiveless as they seemed, had served to sting him near to
  madness...On the landing he paused, leaning against the window, trying to
  steady himself to the sight of the calm gray sky without, trying to fix his
  thoughts on anything save Françoise. Odalie de Merle, coming down the stairs,
  stopped at sight of him, her gentle face colouring.</p>

  <p>"I am needed no more, Messire," she said. Kristopher looked at her,
  thinking of when he had seen Françoise beside her&mdash;her presence was an
  added pain, but his natural sweetness made him answer courteously, thanking
  her, even though his voice broke and she saw it, coming suddenly closer, her
  calm eyes full of trouble.</p>

  <p>"Messire," she said, speaking low, "Will you not speak for Gilles of
  Brittany?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me?" he answered. "Countess?"</p>

  <p>But he was ashamed and could not look at her and she had noticed how he
  winced at his friend's name.</p>

  <p>"You are the only one," she whispered. "He hath no other friends&mdash;all
  Brittany knows now how Montauban hath triumphed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped, panting with her own boldness, holding on to the stair
  railing, and Kristopher looked into her pure face, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"What may I do to help him?"</p>

  <p>"You may send for him, Messire," said Odalie, and at his own thought
  meeting him Kristopher started, then fell to fingering his sword belt,
  looking away.</p>

  <p>She watched him, with cold hands tightly clenched like one might watch
  another at the torture, and had he seen her face then, he must have known
  that she understood.</p>

  <p>But he did not look round till she had turned to go, and then he spoke
  with his eyes still on the sword hilt.</p>

  <p>"Come back with me, Countess," he said, his voice suddenly steady. "Sure,
  you'll not refuse?"</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle followed him without a word, regardless of her attendants
  waiting without.</p>

  <p>"St Kate bless you for your sweet charity," he said under his breath,
  opening a door at the top of the stairs. "An' for your words, Countess."</p>

  <p>The room they entered was that that led into Yvonne-Marie's&mdash;large
  and bare. Héloïse, waiting there, crept away at her entry, being mortally
  afraid of Kristopher.</p>

  <p>He took no heed of her, but went to the table and began to write, while
  Odalie watched him, again with that expression of utter love and sorrow on
  her face, and when he had finished and handed the parchment to her she could
  hardly read for the smarting tears.</p>

  <p>"Faith, I will bring the prince back," said Kristopher proudly. "I can do
  no more."</p>

  <p>"You will send it&mdash;secretly?" said Odalie.</p>

  <p>"To-day&mdash;in seven days he should be here, with help&mdash;it's force
  we must use&mdash;once the prince is in Brittany."</p>

  <p>He paused, sealing the parchment slowly.</p>

  <p>"And Françoise?" asked Odalie. "She will not refuse."</p>

  <p>Kristopher was silent. He could not bring himself to speak of her, only
  after a while, with his head turned away did he answer.</p>

  <p>"It's his life&mdash;an'&mdash;an'&mdash;and others will be in her hands,
  sure, she'll come&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle drew her breath sharply&mdash;she was afraid of
  Françoise.</p>

  <p>"An' now," said Kristopher, "I'll tell you why I'm here&mdash;an' who she
  is you nursed."</p>

  <p>He was leaning against the table, his figure clear-cut against the square
  window, his letter in his hands. A sudden terror and shame rushed over
  Odalie, she dare not look at him.</p>

  <p>"Why me?" she faltered, "I came here, not knowing till yesterday&mdash;you
  were here."</p>

  <p>"'Tis what all the world will know," he answered. "Sure, what is it to
  you? Yet out of your charity listen to me, Countess."</p>

  <p>He opened the door of the other room,' and</p>

  <p>Odalie followed him shrinking, silent, noticing with a sharp pain how he
  was labouring with his breath, how tight his hands were clenched&mdash;what
  it cost him to drag this secret into the light.</p>

  <p>Near the window sat Yvonne-Marie, wrapped in something red and gray, with
  her listless head hanging to one side and her hands folded in her lap.</p>

  <p>Her whole attitude expressed utter indifference, she did not look up when
  they entered.</p>

  <p>For a second Kristopher stood looking at her, her delicate prettiness had
  gone, only her gray eyes were the same&mdash;there seemed something about her
  he had never seen before, as if her origin and her need had proclaimed
  themselves...in her hands and her weary droop, dull as a hunted animal. He
  came closer, he was no nearer sympathy or forgiveness for her than he had
  been five years ago&mdash;but he was looking at things from a different
  level&mdash;he knew what it was to be tempted, almost what it was to fall, he
  no longer felt the utter furious scorn of something so low, but rather pity
  for something so weak.</p>

  <p>"Diane," he said, laying his hand on the back of her chair, and again she
  made the gesture she had done yesterday and would not look up&mdash;she was
  expecting no pity from him, he had not given the forgiveness she had half
  hoped for yesterday; she was very sure he was going to cast her off,
  Kristopher glanced at Odalie and Héloïse, then down again at her. It seemed
  as if Valerie had spoken the truth&mdash;she looked like to die from sheer
  distaste of life.</p>

  <p>"Countess," said Kristopher, raising his head. "Again I thank you for
  these kindnesses&mdash;to my wife&mdash;Mistress Fassiferne, seeing that
  other name was once held so high&mdash;too high for this estate&mdash;her
  name is Mistress Fassiferne."</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle made no answer, her eyes were on Kristopher's proud face
  and the sick woman, who suddenly turned her head and sat up, with a pitiful
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"My Lord!" gasped Yvonne-Marie. "My Lord!"</p>

  <p>It was a sign of the distance between them, that even in her happiest days
  she had always called him that, it was the first time he had heard her
  speak&mdash;he leaned his face lower and lifted up her hand.</p>

  <p>"We've come together&mdash;Diane&mdash;it's what was meant&mdash;forgive
  me as I you&mdash;an'&mdash;an' so&mdash;it's no ill will there is between
  us&mdash;my wife."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie shuddered violently, burying her face in the cushions,
  sobbing.</p>

  <p>"When I was banished England, Countess," said Kristopher, "I could ask
  none to share the shame, though it was undeserved&mdash;an' so&mdash;Diane I
  left in France&mdash;but she hath had faith enough to seek me out&mdash;an' I
  would have all know she is my wife&mdash;sure, if any ask you&mdash;you will
  tell this, Countess?" He spoke awkwardly, with an effort Odalie noticed, she
  saw what his control cost him, she saw, dimly, the truth.</p>

  <p>"If you wish it," she said faintly. "I leave Rennes to-morrow for
  Chateaubriand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell any there who ask of me," said Kristopher, speaking over
  Yvonne-Marie's bent head. "But sure&mdash;who is like to care?"</p>

  <p>His voice was low as a sob&mdash;Odalie could bear it no more, she rose
  suddenly and went toward the door, feeling her way as if blind&mdash;and in
  truth the whole room was blurred through her unshed tears.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie looked up from her cushion, her white face was filled with
  colour, her dull eyes bright. Kristopher, looking at her, saw she would not
  die&mdash;she would live! live!&mdash;a chain and burden, a barrier between
  him and Françoise forever and ever&mdash;the thing was
  done&mdash;forever&mdash;he had spoken&mdash;she would live! As he had said,
  he bore her no ill will&mdash;the past was dead indeed, he had lived down
  that pain, he was bitterly sorry for her&mdash;he could not bring himself to
  kiss her.</p>

  <p>"We will go from here," he said. "Sure, when you're better&mdash;we'll
  talk of what we'll do&mdash;Diane."</p>

  <p>Odalie, at the door, heard him, speaking with difficulty, heard some
  murmured answer from Yvonne-Marie and fled downstairs, numbed and sick at
  heart.</p>

  <p>She stopped in the parlour to recover herself before she left the inn, her
  whole heart was bleeding, her whole frame a-tremble&mdash;she thought of
  Françoise and shuddered.</p>

  <p>Valerie Estercel, who had not moved since Kristopher left him, rose at her
  entrance.</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle clutched at a chair to keep herself from falling.</p>

  <p>"I am no longer needed," she faltered as some excuse. "I
  am&mdash;am&mdash;going."</p>

  <p>"Who no longer needs you?" said Valerie with blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mistress Fassiferne," said Odalie firmly.</p>

  <p>"Her lord hath now the charge of her&mdash;Mistress Fassiferne!" repeated
  Valerie and he gave a great sigh that was half a sob, "and she will
  live?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," answered Odalie wearily, "she is not like to die."</p>

  <p>Again Valerie sighed, creeping to the door, and Odalie glanced round at
  him.</p>

  <p>"There is no longer need of me," he said, and was gone before she could
  speak.</p>

  <p>Odalie drew closer to the fire, shivering&mdash;she could hardly move, the
  red light caught a jewelled ring on her finger&mdash;the Lord of Bàrrès's
  betrothal ring&mdash;she twisted it round, and wrapped her handkerchief about
  it, the tears running silently down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>She was standing thus when Kristopher entered, her back to him; to see her
  there surprised him; he looked for Valerie.</p>

  <p>"I am cold," said the Countess Odalie&mdash;"and Sir Valerie Estercel hath
  let the fire out."</p>

  <p>Kristopher came closer. She was fastening her hood, her face hidden,
  something in her voice moved his gentleness to speak.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Countess&mdash;sweet St Kate bless you&mdash;an' if you
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stumbled over the name, the blood rushing to his face.</p>

  <p>"Françoise de Dinan&mdash;" said Odalie. "I know what you would say,
  Messire&mdash;I will do all I can&mdash;for Gilles of Brittany."</p>

  <p>A horseman clattered across the cobbles outside&mdash;Robin with the
  letter in his belt&mdash;Kristopher watched him ride past the window, then
  turned to her&mdash;slowly.</p>

  <p>"It is done, Countess."</p>

  <p>Odalie de Merle suddenly raised her head. "You have acted as a noble
  gentleman, Messire," she said with a strange pride, and held out her
  hand.</p>

  <p>He clasped it, flushing more deeply, then she drew away with some
  whispered excuse and was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>XV.&mdash;TWO LOVES</h2>

  <p class="first">It was fourteen days later and the day before Françoise de
  Dinan's wedding.</p>

  <p>She sat in the hall of the castle of Chateaubriand, in the full
  candlelight, in the midst of a rich company, furious at heart.</p>

  <p>When she accepted Montauban she had done so with the thought that it was
  the surest way to bring Kristopher back, that it would prove to him she would
  not wait for Gilles; day by day she had waited in the certainty he would come
  if only in anger, if only to defy Guy and speak again for his friend.</p>

  <p>But there had been never a word or a sign from him: completely he had
  disappeared since the night he had left her on her knees&mdash;and her
  waiting days had been a long agony, an agony tempered at first with hope, she
  could not believe he would let her marry Guy. She dared to think he would
  claim her yet.</p>

  <p>But not many days passed before she heard that that killed all hope,
  coming to her carelessly, through Pierre, who had known Kristopher, and
  gently through Odalie de Merle, she had heard of him and of his new-found
  wife.</p>

  <p>After her first furious humour and mad grief and anger had exhausted
  themselves into utter weariness and woe and she thought her hot heart had
  sobbed itself out, there came a letter. It was from Kristopher. All her
  passions flamed afresh till she was in the mood for murder, sitting among her
  guests&mdash;with his writing over her heart. This letter! It held Gilles'
  life and Kristopher's&mdash;the lives of those who followed them&mdash;it
  gave their hiding place&mdash;and he had put it into her hands. Gilles had
  returned&mdash;Kristopher had dared take so much as that on his soul&mdash;to
  bring him back secretly, and then trust her with his life.</p>

  <p>His letter said nothing of what was her soul's one thought, nothing of his
  love, his wife. It told her Gilles, at his instance, had returned secretly to
  Brittany with English aid, that they now were hidden some few miles from
  Chateaubriand with the Lord of Bàrrès as an ally and it asked her to meet him
  at a place he minutely described the next day at dawn.</p>

  <p>"That you may keep your plighted troth to Gilles of Brittany&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That was all, there was not one word to show he despised or loved her,
  nothing of Guy, nothing of his wife, no reproach or scorn or regret&mdash;but
  this written with his own hand, signed with his name, sealed with his seal,
  his life, all their lives, put into her hands in a trust that was too proud
  even to enjoin secrecy.</p>

  <p>It filled her with a furious amazement that after what was past he should
  have sent her such an instrument of vengeance, she felt shamed to the very
  soul to think he should have thought her above using it, angry to think
  perhaps he scorned her so he thought She was too weak to dare&mdash;ashamed
  and angry both when it struck her he might not guess she knew.</p>

  <p>The fact that he and not Gilles had written, that he and not Gilles would
  meet her first, these things only showed any doubt of her, he used no
  entreaties&mdash;he wrote as if certain she would come.</p>

  <p>Françoise thought of his wife and looked across at Guy de Montauban with
  flaming eyes, her hand lying on what was Kristopher's death-warrant if she
  showed it. She knew he would come to-morrow.</p>

  <p>She leaned back, her head against the purple cushions, her eyes still on
  Guy, and drew the letter out, smoothing it on her lap.</p>

  <p>From her chair grinned wooden griffins, the same glowed in silver from the
  andirons, sending fantastic shadows across the wall, dancing in the
  firelight, and soon there was another shadow mingled with theirs, Odalie's,
  coming, velvet-slippered from the laughing company to where these two sat
  apart.</p>

  <p>Françoise, looking at Guy's moody face, did not notice her, and Odalie
  stopped suddenly as if she had been stabbed.</p>

  <p>In the red light she saw the open letter&mdash;the name, the
  message&mdash;the next second Françoise put her sleeve over it, then folded
  it beneath her hand, and Odalie came round the chair, looking at her in a
  dread that froze her.</p>

  <p>"Jesu!" she said under her breath, for in Françoise's face she read what
  she meant to do, and the image of Kristopher lying dead rose up, stunning
  her.</p>

  <p>"Odalie," smiled Françoise, breaking the strained silence. "We are poor
  company here, my lord and I, come and talk to me."</p>

  <p>Odalie sank on the stool at her feet, glad to hide her white face in the
  shadow, to gain time.</p>

  <p>"Guy," said Françoise again with a mad recklessness in her tone, "you are
  silent, <i>mon ami</i>&mdash;cannot you sing or play or even talk?"</p>

  <p>Montauban rose impatiently, adding his shadow to the others on the wall;
  she had ever mocked and flouted him, to-night almost beyond bearing.</p>

  <p>"I can remain silent," he said. "And in some circumstances that is no
  small gift."</p>

  <p>Françoise laughed, leaning forward, her chin in her hand, her elbow on the
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Do I anger you?" she said. "I have that here shall make my
  peace&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Odalie heard her in utter terror&mdash;she was going to use Montauban as
  her instrument, going to show that letter. Odalie's sick dread was confirmed,
  she clutched the griffins on Françoise's chair, thinking desperately of some
  means to gain time.</p>

  <p>"That shall make you forgive me three times over," continued the Lady of
  Dinan, with a little caress in her voice, her white right hand over
  Kristopher's seal. Odalie looked from her to Guy, the colour leaping into her
  face.</p>

  <p>"You have never done that yet, Françoise, that a smile could not atone,"
  said Montauban, and she laughed, looking straight at him, and he caught the
  sneer in her eyes, and lapsed into silence again, flushing deeply.</p>

  <p>"And you, my pious cousin," smiled Françoise, "why are you so silent?"</p>

  <p>Odalie roused herself from her numb dread and answered something, her
  starry eyes still on the paper.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Françoise, lifting her brilliant eyes to Guy. "Her thoughts
  are all on her new altar cloth&mdash;earning a halo with yards of wool-work
  and a place in Heaven bought by alms&mdash;and the prayers of
  churls&mdash;paid for! Preserve me from a Heaven bought by such!"</p>

  <p>And she laughed again, bitterly&mdash;"She is playing with herself,"
  thought Odalie, clasping cold hands, and in truth the Lady of Dinan fingered
  the letter slowly as if it gave her cruel enjoyment, and as Guy came closer
  she looked up at him with reckless eyes and flaming cheeks and a tightening
  of her beautiful mouth as if she imagined him standing thus over Kristopher,
  dead.</p>

  <p>"Whose prayers do you look to to save your soul?".said Guy smiling,
  putting his hand on the arm of her chair, so close to the flutter of that
  paper Odalie could have screamed in agony.</p>

  <p>"There are the bedesmen at a mark apiece," mocked Françoise, "and there is
  always Gilles&mdash;poor, deserted Gilles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At her sudden light mention of his name, Montauban winced in anger, and
  Odalie found her chance to speak.</p>

  <p>"That name sounds hardly well from you, Françoise," she said, "nor these
  sneers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You think not?" was the answer. "Then shall we talk of somewhat
  else&mdash;the Lord of Birres? your betrothed&mdash;your well-beloved." Her
  words were cruel as her eyes and mouth, they stung Odalie to the heart and
  angered Guy, already sore from the sting of her tongue, but she took no heed
  of either, taunting and flouting them both in her soft voice, always with her
  hand tight over the letter&mdash;like a wild thing with its prey.</p>

  <p>"He is so handsome, Odalie I Does it matter his father was a common
  soldier&mdash;he is so brave&mdash;does it matter he is a robber and a
  cut-throat?"</p>

  <p>"Madame!" gasped Odalie, cowering away, but Françoise laughed the more.
  "Oh, you will buy him back to peace and law&mdash;<i>ma chérie</i>&mdash;the
  Church will absolve his murders&mdash;maybe he will even grow as devoted as
  my lord here&mdash;and you will never know how many there were before!"</p>

  <p>"You are mad to-night," said Odalie quietly, but white and trembling. "Why
  are you taunting me with my misfortune?"</p>

  <p>Montauban said nothing, he was held by her fascination to stand there
  gazing at her, though his heart was burning within him.</p>

  <p>"Enguerrand," said Françoise softly, stroking Odalie's brilliant curls
  with delicate fingers, "a pretty name, <i>ma mignonne</i>&mdash;how many have
  thought so?"</p>

  <p>Montauban's page rose up suddenly from the shadow with a half-checked
  gesture of an anger that could no longer be still, for Montauban's page was
  Denise d'Estouteville though even her master did not know her sex, and
  Françoise noticed it&mdash;for a second her eyes were distracted from
  Odalie's white face, then she looked at Guy, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Your page lacks manners," she said.</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;" cried the page, flushing scarlet under her rouge, but Guy
  put her back suddenly, fiercely, and she turned away into the shadow, while
  Françoise laughed again, lifting the letter from her knee to her heart with
  reckless madness in her magnificent eyes.</p>

  <p>"Odalie, Odalie&mdash;are you angry with me? Because I said Enguerrand was
  a fair name?"</p>

  <p>"If it be&mdash;'tis not for you to be saying so," said Guy sternly.</p>

  <p>"Like you Gilles better?" flashed Françoise, rising swiftly to her feet,
  and Odalie rose too, thinking of nothing but the letter in the other's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Not from your lips," answered Montauban quietly, "not from her who shall
  be my wife."</p>

  <p>"Shall be?" she said defiantly. "Are you so sure of that? but, let
  be&mdash;you hate me now, yet I have that shall make you love me as you never
  did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Odalie caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"Now God help you, for you are mad to-night!" she cried, but Françoise
  took no heed and never moved her eyes from Guy's angry face&mdash;she
  despised them equally&mdash;but for him she had a use.</p>

  <p>"Whom hold you highest in your hate? Whom would you give the most to
  slay?" Her voice was low and even, but distinct and clear, she held herself,
  as ever, aloof from him, as ever, she seemed unattainable, dimly he felt she
  was using him as a tool, despising him the while, and as she came nearer,
  beautiful, smiling, he was angered into words.</p>

  <p>"Who? He whose memory makes you insult me now&mdash;he whom I shall kill
  for it&mdash;Madame&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His face was near as passionate as hers, she had stung him into forgetting
  all prudence.</p>

  <p>"And next?" she mocked, seeming not to know Odalie was gripping her arm,
  staring from one to the other in an agony.</p>

  <p>"Next!" said Montauban&mdash;"there is no other&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;" said Françoise&mdash;"he is&mdash;Gilles of Brittany."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, looking straight at her with a bloodless face, "he is
  Kristopher Fassiferne&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Françoise&mdash;" whispered Odalie. "Françoise&mdash;" and there was wild
  entreaty in her voice. Françoise did not shake her off or look at
  her&mdash;but unfolded the letter slowly&mdash;spreading it out.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher Fassiferne," she said in a strange, low voice. "This is the
  second time you have flung his name at me."</p>

  <p>"But not the last," said Montauban furiously, "neither his name nor your
  falsehoods&mdash;Madame."</p>

  <p>"You think I care for him?" she answered, her eyes and cheeks burning, and
  before her face Odalie fell back, hopelessly, "now see how much I
  care&mdash;here is his life, Montauban." She held out the letter, smiling as
  Guy took it, then glanced for the first time at Odalie.</p>

  <p>"How much do you know?" she said proudly. "How ever much&mdash;that is my
  love."</p>

  <p>"No love at all, but a Devil's pride," answered Odalie, and she drew away
  in a trembling horror. "You&mdash;you&mdash;coward!"</p>

  <p>Françoise only half heard her words. She was intoxicated, sick with
  passion, the blood beat in her ears till she was dizzy, her hands were fever
  hot, the jewels on her breast no brighter than her angry eyes, she came close
  to Guy, looking over his shoulder as he eagerly read Kristopher's
  letter&mdash;the careful writing of one unused to the pen&mdash;the
  ill-spelled French, his name at the bottom&mdash;all was burned in on her
  heart&mdash;to the very way the firelight fell over the folds in the
  parchment.</p>

  <p>Montauban looked into her eves. "You mean&mdash;you want&mdash;me to go?"
  he whispered.</p>

  <p>"I gave it to you," said Françoise, "and you ask me what to do? It
  is&mdash;his life."</p>

  <p>Guy gave a great gasp, and the colour mounted to his face.</p>

  <p>"You care for me&mdash;after all?"</p>

  <p>"Enough for this," said Françoise, scorning him in her heart as three
  times fool for not understanding.</p>

  <p>"Enough to be your wife to-morrow&mdash;when you have met that
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And Gilles," said Guy, gazing at her in a kind of bewildered joy and
  wonder. "Back in Brittany&mdash;all their lives on it&mdash;and they send
  you&mdash;this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Twas their error," she answered. "Go now and prove it so&mdash;why do
  you hesitate? the directions, are they not complete?"</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," said Guy passionately. "If I could dare to
  think this means what it seems&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She lifted her face suddenly and kissed him on his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Think what you will&mdash;do what you will&mdash;tell all the company or
  tell no one&mdash;I care not&mdash;of so little matter is it all to me."</p>

  <p>"Françoise!"</p>

  <p>He forgot all her falseness with her face so close, he was completely
  duped, all his rage had vanished with the reading of that letter&mdash;that
  she should have given it&mdash;to him I There was no time for either to say
  more, the Duchess came up from the distant guests and Françoise moved away
  leaving Guy bewildered with his delight.</p>

  <p>He beckoned to his little page and spy, eagerly whispered
  directions&mdash;he would tell no one, but gather men secretly.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" said Denise. "These you take to-morrow&mdash;need you many
  men?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, not many," answered Guy with bright eyes on Françoise's distant
  figure. "They will be trapped as hares&mdash;Count Enguerrand maybe will show
  fight."</p>

  <p>"Where shall I tell my brothers to bring the men, Messire?" asked Denise.
  Guy bade her follow him to another room, and there wrote his directions
  bidding her carry them to her brother Esper who commanded Montauban's
  escort.</p>

  <p>Denise d'Estouteville took the paper and hurried from the gaily lit parts
  of the château.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the stone passage, under the solitary lamp she stopped,
  opened the paper, and carefully read the directions.</p>

  <p>"The chapel of St Herve&mdash;in the borders of the woods&mdash;some half
  mile away."</p>

  <p>Denise folded it with a frown, stamping her foot.</p>

  <p>"He shall not die a dog's death for all your tricks, Madame Françoise,"
  she said to herself. "Betray who not lift a finger, but not La Rose
  Rouge."</p>

  <p>She half laughed, half frowned at the recollections the name brought,
  twirling a ruby ring round her finger, then shrugged her shoulders and
  hastened on her errand, with a calm face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>XVI.&mdash;THE SNOWSTORM</h2>

  <p class="first">In the chapel of St Herve, Kristopher Fassiferne waited for
  the daybreak. It was fresh and cold, the little lamp burning before the
  statue of the saint gave a faint light&mdash;it was utterly silent. Presently
  a wind rose and the clouds began to gather over the dying moon. Kristopher
  drew his blue mantle round him and went to the door, looking out on to the
  half-seen country.</p>

  <p>As it grew lighter he went back to the lamp, and as he extinguished it the
  flame flickered up a moment, showing his grave eyes and set mouth, then sank,
  leaving all almost dark.</p>

  <p>Outside two horses waited, now and then the jingle of their harness broke
  the silence, twice Kristopher went and looked at them, coming back to pace
  the damp stone floor with intent eyes ever on the open door.</p>

  <p>And now the darkness was lifting like a veil, though still sunless, the
  sky heavy with great clouds, lightly stirred. Kristopher paused in the door,
  his heart suddenly leaping high, and his eyes riveted to a figure running
  swiftly through the bare trees toward him; as it drew nearer he stepped from
  the shadow eagerly into the faint gray only to fall back again the light
  faded from his face&mdash;it was a boy in a dark cloak who speeding rapidly
  over the bare ground came up to the chapel door and stopped, panting, looking
  at him, showing under his mantle the bright blue of a page's dress.</p>

  <p>"Captain Kristopher Fassiferne?" he asked with an odd defiance in his
  voice, still gasping for breath.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Kristopher, looking at him keenly, nonplussed by his
  sudden appearance, startled too. "Come you as a friend?"</p>

  <p>The page shrugged his shoulders, and his mantle falling back showed
  Montauban's arms on his breast and a ruby ring on his bare hand.</p>

  <p>"I come to tell you you are betrayed. Your letter is in Montauban's
  hands&mdash;you're waiting for your death, Captain Kristopher."</p>

  <p>A certain almost insolence in the tone, a jaunty carriage of the head
  marked the page as he flung out the words, standing against the square of
  brightening light, and Kristopher had a vague feeling of having seen that
  face and heard that voice before.</p>

  <p>"The Lady Françoise sent you?" he demanded, half suspecting some trap on
  Guy's part, half fearful of he knew not what.</p>

  <p>The page laughed, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"She gave your letter to Montauban, she bid him come to meet you
  here&mdash;kissing him on it."</p>

  <p>Kristopher stepped forward and laid his hand on the other's shoulder
  sternly. "Think you I'll take that as the truth&mdash;that? 11</p>

  <p>"As you wish," was the defiant answer, but Denise d'Estouteville shrank
  from his face for all her courage.</p>

  <p>"Stay and find it true or false&mdash;what care I? I did not come to save
  <i>you</i>&mdash;" she added with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Kristopher dropped his hand, and sat down heavily on the low bench, that
  ran round the wall, a great figure half hidden in the shadow.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Denise, curiosity and hate mingled in her face, "hath this
  struck all reason out of you? You are betrayed, I say, betrayed!"</p>

  <p>"Why have you come to tell me so?" asked Kristopher looking up
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"For no love of you&mdash;but because of one who is entrapped too&mdash;La
  Rose Rouge, whom I served once, and quarrelled with, and hated&mdash;and
  maybe loved&mdash;and whom I would not have die in a
  snare&mdash;and&mdash;save yourself and him&mdash;and who you
  will&mdash;but&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher did not move from where he sat nor take his eyes from her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Sure, it was brave of you, child," he said calmly, "to venture this much
  for one you knew&mdash;but know this, I'll not leave this place alive without
  what I came for."</p>

  <p>Denise stared.</p>

  <p>"You think I lie?" she cried. "You believe her perfection could not stoop
  to this&mdash;but I say I will save Count Enguerrand&mdash;you have no right
  at least to throw other lives away!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher rose and came nearer to where she stood, flushed and vehement,
  her face scarlet above the blue dress.</p>

  <p>"You have not the voice or the bearing of a page," he said quietly, "and,
  sure, somewhere I have seen your face before&mdash;whoever you
  are&mdash;Count Enguerrand is safe, my warning would do no good&mdash;if
  Montauban knows the evil hath been done&mdash;Gilles and the Count are some
  distance away&mdash;I said to them an' I be not back by broad day&mdash;the
  thing is over and I am dead&mdash;for back I will not come alone&mdash;I say
  it again, to you."</p>

  <p>She turned away, suddenly, from his steady blue eyes, and though she
  laughed, it was more affected than real.</p>

  <p>"You think she'll come!" she said. "Even as I left the château Guy's men
  were arming&mdash;but as you are so foolish&mdash;what care I for any? My
  love to La Rose Rouge is not so much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Slipping the ruby ring from her finger she held it out to Kristopher: "If
  you ever see him again give him that, and say the wearer risked their life to
  save his."</p>

  <p>He took it and put it in his doublet, his sad eyes looking past her
  through the door.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I'll remember," he said, with something of his old smile, and
  Denise turned away, it was getting late, and fear for herself was uppermost,
  but she stopped at the door and looked at him standing silent and proud, with
  a sweetness in his face nothing could efface, and a sudden remorse smote
  her&mdash;he was waiting for his death.</p>

  <p>"She isn't worth it," she whispered over her shoulder, "not a man's
  life."</p>

  <p>Kristopher flushed from brow to chin and smiled proudly.</p>

  <p>"What can you know of her?" he said passionately, "or of me&mdash;of any
  of it? If she did this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If!" broke in Denise. "I saw her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure, your errand's done," he answered, a sudden anger in his face. "Get
  you back&mdash;I stay here and wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For death," said Denise, with a little smile. "For her," said Captain
  Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Denise could not understand him&mdash;she stared, still hesitating,
  suddenly furious against Françoise.</p>

  <p>"Whether you speak truth or no," said Kristopher, impatiently, "whether
  you go to urge Montauban faster or no&mdash;wherever you come
  from&mdash;go."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders, daring to stay no longer, and drawing her
  mantle over her light dress, slipped out into the bare trees, not without
  some glances back at the stranger whom she yet knew so well.</p>

  <p>"If it should be so&mdash;" whispered Kristopher. "If it should be
  so."</p>

  <p>He watched the page disappear, and seated himself against the wall, his
  sword across his knees.</p>

  <p>It was bitter cold, silent, remote, a few flakes of snow fluttered from
  the gray sky in at the open door. Kristopher shuddered. Denise had broken all
  his calm&mdash;he was on fire with impatience, watching the snow increase
  till it lay a little heap, white and fresh, on the dusty floor, watching it
  flying past quickly shutting him off from the world like a curtain drawn
  swiftly down.</p>

  <p>"She'll come," he said speaking aloud to steady himself. "Body and soul
  she is mine&mdash;an' she'll come to me." And he sat still as carved stone,
  his eyes on the ground to be rid of the falling snow.</p>

  <p>A light sound broke the calm, he looked up to see a woman standing in the
  doorway with a lantern in her hand...</p>

  <p>At first he did not know her. He had ever pictured her in his heart as he
  last had seen her, in her brilliant gown, in the firelight&mdash;she was
  hooded now in something dark, with a face as white as the snowflakes on her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You've come," he said, knowing her now as she looked at him. "Thank God
  for that!"</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed into brilliancy as he came nearer, the light of her
  lantern catching the silver clasp under his chin and the studs on his belt,
  she was looking at him with wild eyes&mdash;almost in wonder.</p>

  <p>"What think you I came for?" she said. "To tell you Montauban
  knows&mdash;only that&mdash;to give you time to save
  yourself&mdash;because&mdash;maybe because I pitied you."</p>

  <p>The snow was drifting in behind her whitening the floor, blotting out the
  landscape.</p>

  <p>"You mean you'll not come?" said Kristopher, and she dropped her eyes and
  put the lantern on the ground as if her strength failed, before she
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she cried bitterly. "I mean that&mdash;I mean you are
  betrayed."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" he asked, and she crouched against the wall wringing her hands,
  and hiding her despairing face.</p>

  <p>"It was taken from me&mdash;that letter," she whispered. "Montauban got it
  by force&mdash;tore it from me. I could not help it&mdash;why did you send
  it! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! Why! They are coming to kill you&mdash;I could do
  nothing&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He came up close to her, and she dare not look at him, being shamed and
  sick almost to fainting.</p>

  <p>"Is this truth you're telling, my lady?"</p>

  <p>There was a second's silence, then she spoke passionately, still with her
  eyes away.</p>

  <p>"No, it's a lie, a lie&mdash;I gave Montauban that letter, I bade him come
  and kill you here&mdash;because I thought I hated you for leaving
  me&mdash;because&mdash;I was mad And now I have come to save you."</p>

  <p>Her voice faltered and broke, she put her hands before her face.</p>

  <p>"It was only that I loved you so!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher drew her hands away from her face and took them in his and
  kissed them, laughing under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you lovely thing," he said softly. "Sure, I could not be angry with
  you&mdash;didn't I know you'd come&mdash;what matters for anything but
  that?"</p>

  <p>All the jealousy, her sore anger had gone&mdash;she wondered she could
  ever for a second have doubted he was hers and hers only&mdash;his wife faded
  from her thoughts as if she had never been.</p>

  <p>"Come, my lady," he said, "they're waiting&mdash;Gilles of Brittany is
  waiting." And she quivered and blenched as if he had struck her, drawing
  herself up against the wall.</p>

  <p>"You want me to go&mdash;to him? You came for that&mdash;after all?"</p>

  <p>"What else?" he said with a quiet strength and certainty of himself that
  frightened her. "There's no reasoning on't, no question&mdash;it's the right,
  just the right, my lady&mdash;just the one thing to do&mdash;and you came
  because you knew it."</p>

  <p>Françoise looked into his blue eyes and flushed eager face, all her wild
  feelings merged into one dread of losing him.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said, her voice low and as intense as her great eyes,
  "you're asking of me what I cannot do&mdash;I cannot marry Gilles&mdash;for I
  love you&mdash;no one's love, no one's hate matters&mdash;I love you.
  Kristopher&mdash;I accepted Montauban to bring you back&mdash;only for
  that&mdash;I'll follow you now, where you will&mdash;in honour or
  dishonour&mdash;my very soul is yours&mdash;and that's the simple truth,
  Kristopher."</p>

  <p>Standing a pace away from her, he did not speak, and a great joy began to
  fill his heart.</p>

  <p>"Will you take me, Kristopher? Oh, I have nothing in all the whole world
  but you&mdash;no knighthood to keep sacred, no honour, hardly any
  God&mdash;nothing but you who are all these to me."</p>

  <p>"Dear heart!" he cried suddenly, his eyes sparkling. "Sure, I love you too
  much to bring you to shame&mdash;maybe for myself&mdash;for them&mdash;but
  for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not count it shame," she said, her heart heaving beneath the dark
  dress, a delicate colour in her cheeks. "But rather shame to lie a lifetime
  long to Gilles&mdash;look at me and answer me."</p>

  <p>It was his chance&mdash;she was his to take now and keep
  forever&mdash;Gilles and his wife&mdash;his word twice given&mdash;his honour
  before the world on one side&mdash;on the other this&mdash;his
  chance&mdash;in a flash he saw it so.</p>

  <p>"I loved you so I would have killed you," whispered Françoise. "Because I
  thought you had forgotten&mdash;but you had not&mdash;Kristopher&mdash;now
  you see me again&mdash;you cannot think of that other!"</p>

  <p>The allusion to his wife sent the blood to his cheeks, he thought of her
  white face and what he had said to her&mdash;of Gilles&mdash;trusting
  him&mdash;of his name, secretly, proudly kept unstained so long.</p>

  <p>"Dear heart," he said, speaking very low, "what should I be if I did this?
  A thing fit for no one's love&mdash;and you'd see it&mdash;you'd turn from
  me&mdash;from what my love had brought you to." His words struck on her
  heart, dully, she clasped and unclasped her hands, writhing through all her
  slender body, while he watched her in a miserable silence she could find no
  words to break.</p>

  <p>He was the stronger, in her heart she knew it&mdash;if he bid her she must
  go to Gilles&mdash;if he did not bend, she must&mdash;all her tears could not
  touch his steadfastness, with the bitterness of despair she read it in his
  eves as he looked at her.</p>

  <p>"Some men would do this for me," she broke out bitterly. "Some would put
  me above everything&mdash;all the world esteems&mdash;everything!&mdash;would
  have taken me&mdash;proudly; Gilles would have done it&mdash;in your
  place&mdash;why did I not give my heart to such?"</p>

  <p>"None who loved you as I do would do other than what I do," he said,
  startled into fierceness at her words. "Would you have me bring you lower
  than the dust to gratify myself&mdash;for you do not dare to doubt I love
  you&mdash;so much."</p>

  <p>She was cowed into utter silence at his sudden passion, she dare say no
  more&mdash;she was conscious he was lifting her mantle from where it had
  fallen and putting it round her.</p>

  <p>"So much," he whispered again, his face so close she felt his breath on
  her cheek, "so much, I'll lift you where none of this shall touch
  you...you'll be the Prince's wife."</p>

  <p>But for his holding of her up&mdash;she would have fallen, her head
  dropped so low her face was hidden.</p>

  <p>"I'll not come." she whispered. "Take me yourself&mdash;or
  go&mdash;alone."</p>

  <p>"An' I'll not force you," breathed Kristopher. "Take you as I might by
  strength&mdash;but stay here&mdash;an' you choose it&mdash;holding
  you&mdash;till Montauban comes&mdash;think you I'll go back
  alone&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"Stay and be killed?" she cried in a white terror.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "an' you here to see&mdash;you'll not return till I be
  dead&mdash;at least I owe Gilles that!"</p>

  <p>"And me?" said Françoise, raising her eyes at last to his. "Where do I
  touch your thoughts? What do you owe me?"</p>

  <p>"You?" answered Kristopher. "All my love can think of nothing more to
  offer than this return&mdash;to the true&mdash;to the right."</p>

  <p>She began sobbing, passionately, wrenching her hands away to hide her
  face.</p>

  <p>"Take me to him&mdash;I'll come&mdash;but not willingly! Oh, <i>mon
  Dieu</i>! not willingly! Whatever happens remember that! not willingly
  but&mdash;because I can resist no more!"</p>

  <p>"You'll thank Heaven for it yet, my lady," cried Kristopher, raising her
  with hands that trembled.</p>

  <p>"It is not right to me," said Françoise desperately. "But
  wrong&mdash;bitter wrong&mdash;remember I said so&mdash;when I lie to Gilles
  to please you&mdash;betray my own soul to lull his folly!"</p>

  <p>She turned away to the door, standing out dark against the snow.</p>

  <p>"Haste&mdash;lest Montauban come."</p>

  <p>With set lips and flaming cheeks she followed Kristopher through the swift
  snowflakes, her passionate heart leaping under the heavy mantle.</p>

  <p>As he helped her to the horse he saw her face, white in the dark
  hood&mdash;not luxuriously beautiful now but pained to distortion&mdash;for
  him&mdash;and all his courage sank to misery and rebellion again&mdash;what
  right had he to act for her&mdash;what right?</p>

  <p>Her thoughts were still all for him</p>

  <p>"Haste&mdash;even now&mdash;if they come."</p>

  <p>He had had his chance and lost it&mdash;she was no longer
  his&mdash;perhaps he had even killed her love&mdash;and the thought leaped up
  in his heart mocking him as they flew through the scudding snow side by side
  toward Gilles of Brittany.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-17"
     id="ch-17"></a>XVII.&mdash;LA ROSE ROUGE</h2>

  <p class="first">The evening of the same day Castle Bàrrès was flaring with
  lights from top to bottom, five hundred men were there, the English who had
  followed Gilles and the men of Enguerrand de la Rose, Count of Bàrrès and
  Dol, the lord of all the lands that bordered the estates of Dinan and now
  leagued with Gilles of Brittany against Heaven, earth and Hell, as he had
  sworn, throwing all his immense power into the balance&mdash;for mere love of
  rebellion and fierce lawlessness men thought, and so he let them think,
  making no mention of what had worked with him&mdash;a once seen woman's face.
  Françoise de Dinan stood before the fire in the gaunt, ill-furnished hall and
  looked on the crowd moving to and fro&mdash;looked beyond them down the
  corridor to where lights burned in the chapel where they prepared for her
  wedding. She was glad to be rid of them all for a few moments, to stand alone
  without Gilles' eager eyes upon her&mdash;to gain some respite, all half
  dazed, bewildered as she was. Not far away, two other women talked&mdash;one
  with blue eyes that were strangely familiar, Kristopher's sister and Sir
  Gregan Griffiths' wife, who had hung over Françoise in sympathy and
  tenderness, till chilled by the other's coldness&mdash;the second slight and
  shrinking, with a timid face. Among all those that came and went, Françoise
  watched these two covertly, leaning slightly forward with locked
  hands&mdash;her journey here, her meeting with Gilles, was a blur, she
  remembered nothing but Kristopher's blue mantle in front and the blinding
  snow&mdash;Kilda Griffiths' kindly talk was blended with her recollection
  too, that and a face she had seen before somewhere.</p>

  <p>Recalling that face, she looked round those passing in and out, arming,
  shouting orders, carrying torches, her aching head against the chimmey-piece,
  a silent spectator of the turmoil&mdash;then suddenly stiffened and flushed,
  all her vague remembrance confirmed&mdash;a knight in inlaid armour had
  stopped in front of her, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she cried impulsively. "The singer outside Chateaubriand!"</p>

  <p>"The lady at the window," he smiled back. "Welcome to my poor castle for
  many things&mdash;above all for that remembrance."</p>

  <p>Françoise suddenly understood.</p>

  <p>"You are Count Enguerrand?" she said, both startled and vexed.</p>

  <p>"La Rose Rouge," he said with a deepening of his curious smile, and she
  flushed more hotly at his tone, thinking of his flower that had been as an
  evil suggestion in her trouble.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Prince?" she asked impatiently. "What are we waiting
  for?"</p>

  <p>"The chapel hath not been used these many years," said Count Enguerrand.
  "The Prince would have it swept before his wedding&mdash;and tonight we start
  for Guildo, Madame."</p>

  <p>Françoise glanced at him, his voice had the same almost unpleasant
  fascination for her his flower had&mdash;besides she had heard too much of
  him not to feel curious. His face was as insolent, as handsome as her memory
  had pictured it only his red-brown eyes were soft and laughing as a woman's
  now.</p>

  <p>"There are many here I do not know," she said hastily, looking away again.
  "When the Prince told me their quality I was too weary to heed&mdash;who is
  the fair-haired lady, Count?"</p>

  <p>She asked at random, because the silence discomposed her, but the answer
  drove all the blood from her heart like the shock of a sudden blow.</p>

  <p>"She is Mistress Fassiferne," he answered, "the wife of the Prince's
  friend."</p>

  <p>Françoise felt her heart leap into her eyes, she could hardly command
  herself, in a great fear and agony she turned away, with no flush on her face
  now and strove to murmur some reply.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge looked at her keenly, and as she braced herself to face him
  again, his expression made her tingle to her finger-tips.</p>

  <p>"Count," she said desperately, "do me this favour to bring the Prince to
  me."</p>

  <p>"I read that you would be alone?" he smiled, and left her at once, going
  over to the window and talking with Gregan Griffiths.</p>

  <p>"His wife!" whispered Françoise&mdash;his wife in flesh and
  blood&mdash;what had been but a name till now, was another woman like
  herself&mdash;it made her misery real as it had never been.</p>

  <p>She sat on the oak settle, her thoughts whirling, the room spinning before
  her, then her eyes fell on Count Enguerrand and rested there, half
  frightened, half attracted through all her distraction.</p>

  <p>A well-known voice roused her, she rose unsteadily to meet Gilles face to
  face and listen to his eager talk till she could have screamed aloud in
  anguish.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge, lolling against the window, had his eyes on
  her&mdash;occasionally he glanced at Gilles with something like pity and
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"Come you with us to Guildo?" he asked suddenly, turning to where
  Kristopher stood silent behind him.</p>

  <p>"No," was the answer. "I command the English in Dol, Messire&mdash;taking
  leave of you to-night," then with a sudden start: "I had near forgot! It's a
  message I have for you, Count."</p>

  <p>They stood apart from the noise and bustle under the light of a torch
  fixed high on the wall, and Count Enguerrand withdrew his eyes from Françoise
  to fix them on Kristopher curiously as he took a ring from his doublet and
  tendered it with his frank smile.</p>

  <p>"A little page in Montauban's service, Count, gave it me for you and he
  bade me say he risked his life to save yours as indeed he did&mdash;coming to
  warn me."</p>

  <p>The look on Enguerrand's face made him stop suddenly. La Rose Rouge
  glanced from the ring lying on his palm into the other's face and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"You've made a mistake," he said.</p>

  <p>"A mistake?" said Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand held the ring up between his finger and thumb, still laughing
  softly.</p>

  <p>"' Françoise,' the name round this is&mdash;a pearl and a bloodstone."</p>

  <p>His eyes had disappeared to mere specks of light, he seemed convulsed with
  insolent amusement; Kristopher flushed scarlet with a sudden recollection and
  a great rage against his own heedlessness.</p>

  <p>"It's a mistake," he said quietly. "A ring of my Lady of Dinan's I
  found&mdash;give it me&mdash;this was yours."</p>

  <p>"<i>This</i> I do know," smiled La Rose Rouge taking the ruby&mdash;"and
  this other shall I not give it the lady?" motioning to where she stood with
  her back to them.</p>

  <p>"Give it me," repeated Kristopher with a dangerous light in his eyes.
  "I'll choose my own time and place for its return."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Enguerrand softly, handing it back. "Maybe, it would be
  wiser."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Kristopher.</p>

  <p>"A good many things," returned La Rose Rouge with a hidden fierceness
  under the careless insolence of his manner. "Among others that I own no
  master and'll stand no questioning, Captain Kristopher."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" said Kristopher, looking at him straightly.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand shrugged his shoulders, laughing again, glancing at Françoise
  now moving slowly toward the chapel.</p>

  <p>"How got you this same ruby ring?" he said, ignoring the question.</p>

  <p>"I told you, Count," answered Kristopher, distracted by his own stormy
  thoughts, thinking he must get this ring back to her before Gilles
  saw&mdash;tingling with the annoyance of his slip before this man.</p>

  <p>"Montauban's page!" smiled La Rose Rouge, whirling the ruby round in the
  light. "Mine once, Monsieur&mdash;and useful too&mdash;clever and troubled
  with no scruples&mdash;a pity we quarrelled! but you say she put her life on
  saving mine? Now, what woman would do as much for you?"</p>

  <p>"Woman?" cried Kristopher, and suddenly two faces were before
  him&mdash;with a dark forest for background&mdash;the man's, that before him
  now&mdash;the woman's, the same with the page in blue.</p>

  <p>"Shall we say boy then?" answered Enguerrand mockingly. "What boy would do
  the like for you?"</p>

  <p>"I' faith, Count," cried Kristopher, "boy or woman, what care I&mdash;the
  time is something too precious to be wasted thus."</p>

  <p>Kristopher did not care greatly to think that Enguerrand&mdash;false,
  utterly without honour, must hold the safety of Guildo in his hands&mdash;at
  present his interest bound him to Gilles, but Kristopher had small hope of
  his faith if the Duke bribed higher.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he had made possible what without his aid had been impossible:
  by his immense power alone could they keep a foothold in Brittany, and
  Kristopher bore his company for what his alliance meant to Gilles.</p>

  <p>Turning from him now, he passed through the eager excited company and the
  flaring lights to the dark and the quiet of the corridor and from that to the
  pale yellow glow in the chapel where two dim lamps burned above the altar,
  and through the rose window floated the fine snow whitening the dusty floor
  beneath. Against the wall leaned Françoise, either side of her the half
  grotesque, half terrible forms of cowering angels. She was not praying or
  weeping, her hands were locked in front of her and she stared out blankly.
  Kristopher's heart died within him at sight of her face&mdash;it took all his
  courage to go up to her&mdash;but for her own sake Gilles must not know she
  had parted with his ring.</p>

  <p>"I could not send this by another," he said speaking slowly, holding it
  out. She took it, putting it on her finger dully, it was not easy for either
  to speak, since the morning something had come between them&mdash;something
  that had driven them insensibly apart&mdash;they were no longer
  alone&mdash;under the same roof was his wife and her betrothed&mdash;no names
  or symbols now but tangible facts.</p>

  <p>And the sense of this, the feeling the distance between them was widening,
  that she could never hear him talk other than she had just done, that it was
  hopeless now&mdash;hopeless&mdash;stirred her sick heart almost to
  madness.</p>

  <p>"I got it from Montauban," said Kristopher unsteadily. "There is no need
  to tell the Prince."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am an adept in deception!" flashed Françoise, with flaming eyes. "I
  can lie to him an' you bid me&mdash;tell him what you choose&mdash;say I was
  forced into it&mdash;say how I wept for him."</p>

  <p>"Don't speak like that," interrupted Kristopher.
  "Don't&mdash;you're&mdash;not&mdash;like that."</p>

  <p>She drew herself up, quivering, shutting out the sight of his blue eyes
  with her hand over her own.</p>

  <p>"You've left me no choice," she said. "You've put me where I cannot go
  back&mdash;an' so&mdash;I'm going on&mdash;into what'll be&mdash;Hell."</p>

  <p>Her words came with difficulty, she drew her free hand backward and
  forward over the cold stone.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," she went on, "but I'm not strong&mdash;nor brave&mdash;and
  if I fall and fall terribly, as I feel it in me to fall&mdash;remember I gave
  you the chance&mdash;I asked you to save me&mdash;and you put honour
  first."</p>

  <p>The clink of armour sounded outside&mdash;the red flare of torches fell
  across the gloom&mdash;in a little while she would be taken from him
  forever&mdash;all the unreasoning passion he had crushed flamed up in his
  heart again&mdash;bidding him take her&mdash;save her, at the cost of
  everything&mdash;pay with his honour, with all the world&mdash;for the sight
  of her face comforted of its despair.</p>

  <p>"Save you?" he gasped, gripping the slender pillar beside him
  tight&mdash;"and now!"</p>

  <p>"Would you?" she asked, looking up with sparkling eyes&mdash;"But
  no&mdash;your love does not go so far."</p>

  <p>"You do me wrong," he said, passionately. "Nothing matters but
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped and dropped his outstretched hand. Françoise too recoiled as if
  a snake had sprung up between. Down the steps came Kristopher's wife.</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;" she began, then looked from one to the other, confused at
  Françoise's presence.</p>

  <p>"I do not know this lady, Messire," said the Lady of Dinan, with the
  cruelty of great pain, her pride helping her to her calm.</p>

  <p>"My wife," answered Kristopher, sick with shame and agony, humbled to the
  very dust in his own eyes. "Mistress Fassiferne."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie looked at Françoise smiling curiously, too.</p>

  <p>"I have no need to ask your name," she said. "I have seen you before,
  Madame."</p>

  <p>"And I you," answered Françoise, "but I had forgotten."</p>

  <p>There was this in her that she had no small feelings of jealousy or hate
  at sight of Kristopher's wife, she was as indifferent to her as to
  Gilles&mdash;save as an obstacle she had not touched her, but looking at her
  now she marvelled passionately why he should be bearing shame and banishment
  for her sake&mdash;why he should do so much for her.</p>

  <p>"The Prince bade me&mdash;if I saw you, my lord," said Yvonne-Marie, "say
  the English are all in readiness&mdash;he hath been reviewing them&mdash;I
  had trouble to find you," she added with a faint smile, and Françoise who had
  been marking her timid shrinking address with a strange pleasure suddenly
  flushed.</p>

  <p>"Count Enguerrand told me," continued</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie. "He was sitting in the doorway and saw you within."</p>

  <p>The flush on Françoise's face deepened, she glanced at Kristopher, his
  eyes were on the ground, but she saw the blood had rushed to his cheeks too
  and knew his thought was the same&mdash;"If that man heard!"</p>

  <p>"Gregan hath his men in readiness?" said Kristopher with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Yvonne-Marie, "and so are yours&mdash;the Prince said we
  might start when he did, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Start for where?" asked Françoise.</p>

  <p>"For Dol, Madame, where my lord bath the command."</p>

  <p>"You do not come to Guildo?"</p>

  <p>Françoise turned to Kristopher impulsively. "No, Madame&mdash;to
  Dol&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was labouring with his breath painfully, the whole scene had become a
  torture to him he could not bear, the lamps over the altar were blinking like
  evil eyes, the proud face of Françoise, the half-frightened face of his
  wife&mdash;accusing faces both seemed to rise and fall as if tossed up on
  some great sea.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie's gentle voice broke the pause.</p>

  <p>"Sir Gregan Griffiths commands the English in Guildo, Madame."</p>

  <p>The chapel was filling, Enguerrand ascended lazily, yawning, others behind
  him, and Françoise turned from them all and went to the altar steps, and
  knelt there silent&mdash;this was as the last hope killed&mdash;it would be
  farewell&mdash;to-night and forever.</p>

  <p>What else she had expected she did not know, in truth it was all she could
  have looked for&mdash;nevertheless it stabbed and stung&mdash;they must part,
  and that other would go with him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! <i>Mon Dieu</i>!" moaned Françoise, her head in her
  hands. "I cannot bear it!"</p>

  <p>But when Gilles came up to her, and took her hand, she answered him and
  smiled, remembering how easy once had been what now was so difficult.</p>

  <p>"What you have given for me," she said. "This is war, Gilles, war to the
  death!"</p>

  <p>He looked round at the gathering of soldiers proudly.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I have not given half enough," he said happily, "an' can I punish my
  brother's and Montauban's falsehood by rewarding your truth with a
  crown&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not ask it," she said, her eyes busy with Kristopher standing on the
  altar steps fixing a torch.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," cried Gilles&mdash;"anything but this!"</p>

  <p>"Now are we lit as we have never been lit before!" cried Enguerrand, as
  the last torch was raised. "'Tis a long time since prayers were held here,
  Lady&mdash;here in Bàrrès, where roses grow in winter."</p>

  <p>"By aid of the evil one?" laughed Gilles, but Françoise dropped her eyes
  from the dancing red ones of the Count&mdash;her strange dread of him was
  growing and yet in the awful future the thought of him being there gave her a
  curious comfort&mdash;as his rose had done.</p>

  <p>Standing before the priest with her hand in Gilles', she looked round on
  them all, the quiet chapel glowing red from the torchlight, spears and
  armour&mdash;Kilda and Yvonne-Marie with the English behind her&mdash;to the
  right Kristopher&mdash;to the left Enguerrand, the light full on his smiling
  face and twisting curls, playing on the fantasy of his armour and showing a
  little dancing imp in his velvet eyes&mdash;he held her gaze fascinated;
  there was such an expression of insolent devilry in his whole bearing she
  could have cried aloud in fear&mdash;his figure gave a horror to the whole
  place, as if the devil had come to see her wed. She felt in a dream, a
  nightmare, closed in some great tomb with red light flickering over friends,
  standing up dazed and dumb to part with her soul&mdash;her happiness
  forever.</p>

  <p>A moment more and the thing was done, until death, too late now all hopes
  and struggles, all prayers and pleadings, over all glimpses of happiness, the
  sweetness that was too sweet to dread the future&mdash;she was Gilles of
  Brittany's wife.</p>

  <p>Their names were ringing to the vaulted roof&mdash;"Long live Gilles of
  Brittany! Long live Françoise of Brittany!" The sombre chapel was broken into
  a medley of colour and light&mdash;in the crowd that came about them she
  missed Kristopher, but Enguerrand's evil face seemed ever close to hers, he
  had put his casque on, and the red plumes lay on his shoulders like blood, he
  spoke to Gilles laughing, but his eyes were ever on her...</p>

  <p>The snow had turned to a fine rain as they gathered in the courtyard, the
  English archers and the French outlaws, even for one night they dared not
  stay at Bàrrès, it was too near to Rennes, another day's march and they would
  be well within La Rose Rouge's land and safe.</p>

  <p>Gilles was taking leave of Kristopher, Françoise moved her horse farther
  away that she might not hear his voice, that she too might not have to say
  farewell&mdash;here before them all, she would rather he should leave without
  a word, but Gilles came up with his friend behind him and she could not avoid
  turning.</p>

  <p>"Shall I leave some of my thanks to you, Françoise?" smiled Gilles, "to
  this gentleman who hath done so much for both of us?"</p>

  <p>"What can I say?" faltered Françoise, glad of the dark to hide her face.
  "Empty thanks are but poor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Any thanks, Princess," answered Kristopher, "are but a mockery of my poor
  services&mdash;peace and happiness to you, Princess!"</p>

  <p>She could not answer, she dare not look, she knew he had gone&mdash;gone
  with his wife, that was her farewell. She writhed on the saddle in a mute
  agony, clenching her hands over her heart, struggling for breath, and when
  she did turn, her love had indeed gone, and beside Gilles rode Enguerrand de
  la Rose, smiling.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>XVIII.&mdash;MURDER</h2>

  <p class="first">They were journeying to Guildo, still ahead of their
  pursuers, a hundred archers under Gregan Griffiths's command, two hundred
  under Count Enguerrand's, slowly making their way over the desolate country
  where the remainder of the men awaited them; English some of these, some La
  Rose Rouge's men, outlaws, robbers, glad to have Gilles of Brittany's name to
  war under, and looking as the English for some great advantage from the
  Duke's rebellious brother.</p>

  <p>It was quite light and cold, the ground slippery with half melted snow,
  the slush of broken ice.</p>

  <p>They rode slowly, carefully; the way led over rough rocks and past deep
  ravines, through clogging marshes and hard broken ground where the horses
  stumbled and could hardly find a foothold.</p>

  <p>Françoise, riding a black horse, by the side of Gilles, some paces before
  the others, was sensible of no fatigue, the agony at her heart dulled all
  weariness, she rode erect and straight as any soldier, long after Kilda was
  half falling from her horse, and lagging far behind.</p>

  <p>"Dear heart," said Gilles softly, joyously. "We are but two hours off
  Guildo&mdash;dear heart&mdash;there we shall be safe from all the world."</p>

  <p>Two hours! God had not heard her prayer&mdash;she was drawing
  nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;there was no more pity in heaven than in her
  lover's heart.</p>

  <p>"And we are unpursued," she said, turning her dark eyes on Gilles; she had
  to make some answer, and this was but speaking her thoughts; she almost
  wished Montauban would overtake them, so desperately she longed for something
  to happen&mdash;something before her fate closed round her&mdash;before they
  reached Guildo. "And now ride ahead, Gilles, the way is narrow."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she drew her hand away from his and backed her
  horse&mdash;Oh, for a miracle! for something to strike-her dead&mdash;for
  some deliverance&mdash;either of Heaven or Hell!</p>

  <p>Before them the road wound up a steep rugged rock, twisting along its
  edge, hardly wide enough for more than one, and giving straight on to a
  considerable drop into a stone-filled valley, where a little dark stream
  gurgled.</p>

  <p>It was gray and colourless, there was no sun, rocks, horsemen, trees and
  the driving rain distinct in a cheerless cold light that was hard and
  pitiless. But Gilles rode ahead gaily, it was not gray to him, Françoise rode
  behind, muffled close in her cloak, and near to her La Rose Rouge was
  following singing under his breath, in a fascinating voice that jarred on her
  like discordant howls. She could have screamed, she could have implored him
  'to stop, but she dare not turn and look into his dancing eyes&mdash;she was
  afraid.</p>

  <p>Oh, for a deliverance from Heaven or&mdash;Hell!</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>!" said Gilles with a gay laugh. "These roads are
  slippery!"</p>

  <p>He was riding carelessly; the path so narrow at places the horses only
  could pass with difficulty, and suddenly the blood rushed to Françoise's
  heart, in front of Gilles the earth had crumbled away&mdash;across his path
  was a great rift&mdash;there was foothold for neither horse nor man, and he
  looking ahead did not see.</p>

  <p>Her first impulse was to cry out&mdash;but she did not&mdash;a
  deliverance! a miracle! Gilles drew nearer&mdash;in a moment he must
  see&mdash;La Rose Rouge had stopped singing. All feeling was frozen in her,
  her thought was turning her blood cold, still she did not speak&mdash;did not
  warn&mdash;he would see for himself&mdash;he must see&mdash;Oh, God in
  heaven, he must not see!</p>

  <p>"Gilles!" she called suddenly, and hardly knew she did it, it was so low
  he did not hear; her voice would not come&mdash;he would see&mdash;"Gilles!"
  she shrieked, and knew why now, knew what it felt like to murder. "Gilles! my
  horse is slipping&mdash;help!"</p>

  <p>He looked round instantly, loosening his hold on the reins and for an
  instant struggled to turn the horse or dismount, and in that instant he lost
  his control, the animal, confused, plunged&mdash;caught his foot in the
  fissure, and tore forward at a headlong gallop over the level stones with
  Gilles dragged after, one foot caught in the saddle trappings...</p>

  <p>Françoise dropped from her horse, she had meant worse than this, she had
  meant horse and rider to be hurled over the cliff&mdash;La Rose Rouge sprang
  from his horse and lifted her up, still smiling, his face whiter than
  ever.</p>

  <p>"Well done, my beautiful devil!" he whispered, but she slipped from him
  and sank on her knees on to the wet ground.</p>

  <p>"Gilles! Gilles! save him&mdash;Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! he will be
  dead&mdash;stop him!" she was frantic, struggling, she realised what she had
  done in her madness, the others were coming&mdash;she called out to them,
  trying to free herself from Enguerrand.</p>

  <p>"Gilles!" she screamed. "Kristopher! Kristopher!"</p>

  <p>But La Rose Rouge held her tight, dragging her from the horses.</p>

  <p>"Gilles will not trouble you again, beautiful," he said with a deepening
  smile. "And, Mignonne, you must not call him Kristopher."</p>

  <p>Françoise gazed at him in silent horror as he put his face so close to her
  the red curls touched her breast.</p>

  <p>"The others might hear, beautiful&mdash;and the others might guess,
  beautiful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are mad," gasped Françoise. "Let go my hands&mdash;go and help the
  Prince&mdash;let go my hands, I say!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand laughed.</p>

  <p>"Others have done that," he answered. "The Englishman hath stopped the
  horse."</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" said Françoise, cowering from the veiled brown eyes, turning
  desperately to Gregan, who came running up white and gasping.</p>

  <p>"Keep the Princess here," he cried brokenly. "The Prince's horse has
  thrown him&mdash;Dead! I don't know&mdash;he's&mdash;mangled."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" shrieked Françoise, and Gregan shook his head motioning,
  shuddering, to Enguerrand to keep her away.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge drew her from the crowd, her hands in his.</p>

  <p>"There aren't many women would have dared that," he whispered. "Take
  heart&mdash;he <i>may</i> be dead."</p>

  <p>"Oh, devil!" cried Françoise, "think you I wish it?"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand glanced toward the excited group they stood apart from and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I know it&mdash;I heard&mdash;if I keep silence you'll owe me some
  thanks, Princess."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a white upturned face.</p>

  <p>"Your silence! I would not buy it with a word!" she said.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge's insolent eyes began to dance dangerously.</p>

  <p>"Then," he whispered, "shall I turn and tell them all?"</p>

  <p>The gray mist was writhing between them like a living thing, half shutting
  off the figures moving to and fro.</p>

  <p>"All?" repeated Enguerrand, and his red brows were gathered together in a
  heavy frown. "Even Kristopher Fassiferne?" She looked at him a moment then
  turned her face away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not him!"</p>

  <p>The frown disappeared from Enguerrand's face, he flushed with pleasure and
  laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"So I've touched you now, my lady?"</p>

  <p>He had no time for more. Kristopher's sister came up and drew Françoise
  away weeping; through the rain figures moved silently, the long line of
  spears showed through the mist, as the soldiers waited motionless along the
  hill.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand watched Françoise till her bent figure had disappeared in the
  gray among the others.</p>

  <p>"Now is he dead?" he thought, and looked over the cruel rocks down which
  the horse had dragged his master till Gregan Griffiths had stopped the
  creature and drawn Gilles away near the spot where they now gathered.</p>

  <p>"Now' is he dead?"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand turned to know at once, "Yes," or "No," when his foot struck
  against something&mdash;a little packet of letters. Instantly he picked it
  up, thrusting it up his sleeve, as Gregan Griffiths was upon him, and the
  soldiers moved nearer.</p>

  <p>"Will the Prince live?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Saints! How may a man know?" shuddered Sir Gregan. "He is
  alive&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>Enguerrand sprang on to his horse, snarling between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Is this the first blood you've seen?" he cried aloud, "that you mow and
  chatter thus?"</p>

  <p>He beckoned the men up behind him angrily.</p>

  <p>"Whether Gilles be dead or alive we must to Guildo to-night&mdash;tell
  them so, Chevalier."</p>

  <p>"The poor Princess," murmured Sir Gregan, looking back, his voice
  trembling, his face white with the horror of it.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge glanced to where she rode beside the litter within which
  Gilles of Brittany lay hidden under a scarlet cloak, the one spot of colour
  in the cavalcade.</p>

  <p>"The poor Princess!" he smiled. "A fine entry shall we make into
  Guildo."</p>

  <p>Those who carried Gilles and those who followed, the Bretons and the
  English, came silently, but Kilda was weeping, and her sobs broke the silence
  painfully. Enguerrand drew his horse up and waited for the little cavalcade
  to pass, and as Françoise drew near, he smiled.</p>

  <p>Her face was calm but changed and she gazed on the outline beneath the red
  cloak steadily.</p>

  <p>But La Rose Rouge leaned forward and as she looked up with heavy eyes, his
  smile deepened and he turned his horse sharply and rode beside her, in
  silence, down the twisting road.</p>

  <p>A deliverance!&mdash;either of Heaven&mdash;or Hell! Françoise looked from
  the litter where her husband lay to the man riding beside her&mdash;the man
  who knew, who held her in his hand&mdash;her punishment had fallen swiftly on
  her crime, and her crime had been for nothing&mdash;Prince Gilles lived. The
  very sky seemed bearing down on her, the mist to lie like lead upon her
  heart, she was conscious of two things only, the scarlet cloak one side, the
  smiling face with her secret behind it the other. She dared not draw away
  from him, she dared not show her fear and hate&mdash;he knew! he knew!</p>

  <p>And so, in the silver evening between Gilles of Brittany and Enguerrand de
  la Rose Rouge, Françoise rode into Guildo by the sea.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-19"
     id="ch-19"></a>XIX.&mdash;A LEADER OF THE WICKED</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a month after Françoise de Dinan's wedding, and
  Brittany was torn from coast to centre with a hot civil war.</p>

  <p>On the side of Gilles of Brittany were the English and Count Enguerrand's
  great power&mdash;on the Duke's side the French, fearful for their hold in
  Brittany if the rebellious prince was as successful as it seemed he might be.
  For successful so far he was, more so than his friends had dared to hope,
  half the country was his&mdash;a large army wore his colours, the peasantry
  of Dol were up in arms for him, the English allies were reinforced till they
  outnumbered the French and it seemed they might crow strong enough to wrest
  the Duke's very crown from his grasp. But he in whose name so much blood was
  shed was incapable of understanding his victories&mdash;Gilles lay between
  life and death in Guildo, shunned by his wife, avoided by Enguerrand and his
  followers, and dependent on the charity of Kilda Griffiths and the tenderness
  of servants.</p>

  <p>Françoise had not been near him since their stay in Guildo, they had told
  her his back was injured and that he would be a cripple for life and she
  could not bring herself to look on him, her miserable life was punishment
  enough without that, she told herself bitterly. She lived in a daily fear of
  Count Enguerrand, a fear that he would speak of what he knew of her, a fear
  that he would betray her husband and his cause into Montauban's hands.</p>

  <p>And this last thought was very terrible to Françoise, it was more horror
  than remorse she felt for what she had done, more fear for the consequences
  than regret for the motive&mdash;yet she could not bear to think of Gilles
  betrayed, maimed and helpless, into the hands of his bitter enemy. It could
  avail her nothing. Ghastly as was her mockery of a life in Guildo, it was
  better than what her fate would be if she fell into Montauban's hands
  again&mdash;bitter as her wrong toward Gilles was now, it would be bitterer
  if through this wretched war she had caused he lost his life, and though
  Françoise of Brittany had an easy standard of right and wrong, even her wild
  heart shrank from the bare horror of having on her soul the murder of the man
  she had deceived and crippled.</p>

  <p>She would have done much to prevent it and she watched Enguerrand eagerly
  and fearfully.</p>

  <p>Well enough she knew he was dealing with Montauban&mdash;that Guildo was
  infested with French spies and often she had to listen to the muttered
  complaints of the English that they were in league with a traitor, but as yet
  Enguerrand had shown no open sign of treachery and she dare not speak to him
  of her fears.</p>

  <p>He had displayed no desire to make any use of what he knew, so far he had
  not sought her out; nor in any way alluded to that ride to Guildo.</p>

  <p>But Françoise did not trust this silence&mdash;she thought bitterly that
  he was not the man to forego the advantage he had over her, and when she
  discovered she had lost the only two letters Kristopher had written her, she
  was filled with the sickening dread that they were in Enguerrand's
  possession.</p>

  <p>She could do nothing but wait and bear her suspense as best she
  might&mdash;she was at his mercy in that; if he chose to be silent she could
  not speak of her shame.</p>

  <p>And so the spies came and went unmolested, and when Gregan Griffiths came
  with furious complaints of La Rose Rouge she had to hush him and pretend she
  believed in Enguerrand's honour, even while her lies made her sick with rage
  and shame.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly what she had been waiting for came&mdash;Count Enguerrand
  demanded to see her, and she, not daring to offend him, consented, cold with
  terror.</p>

  <p>And waiting for him she spent the time pacing to and fro her room like a
  caged animal raging against herself and all mankind.</p>

  <p>After arranging himself carefully before his mirror, Count Enguerrand left
  his room to seek Françoise de Dinan.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for this favour, Madame," he said with a gravity that brought
  the blood to her cheeks. "A favour I will repay with what I come to tell
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am listening, Count," answered Françoise. She raised her beautiful head
  but did not look at him.</p>

  <p>"Are you not tired of Guildo, Princess?" he said smiling, a few paces away
  from her. "Hath it not become an irksome prison to you?"</p>

  <p>"How a prison?" she said quickly. "My château, Count."</p>

  <p>"Princess," smiled Enguerrand, "in three days you will be
  free&mdash;Guildo will be in Montauban's hands&mdash;Gilles hath been too
  long a-dying!"</p>

  <p>Françoise looked at him in utter terror and rose up to the full of her
  slim height with her face ivory white, all the slow horror and dread of these
  days in Guildo seemed realised, she was face to face with the worst at
  last.</p>

  <p>"You mean you are going to betray Guildo? <i>Mon Dieu</i>! Then what they
  said was true!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"If they said that, it was," answered La Rose Rouge with dancing eyes. "I
  have gained half Brittany by this service to the Duke&mdash;and the hand of
  the Duke's cousin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will betray Guildo to Montauban!" interrupted Françoise, sharply, and
  Enguerrand looked at her straightly, with a great admiration for her beauty,
  and no thought of the anguish in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Which means Gilles will not be so long a-dying," he said softly. "In
  three days&mdash;I have arranged it with Guy's spies."</p>

  <p>"You dare to come and tell this to <i>me</i>&mdash;?" flashed Françoise,
  passionately. "You&mdash;you&mdash;dare to I You are foolish as you are vile,
  Count, for Gregan Griffiths will know of this before nightfall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was trembling with anger, her eyes blazing, but Enguerrand never moved
  from his easy position against the wall and the insolent smile did not leave
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Leave me!" continued Françoise, drawing farther away. "Did I not scorn
  you more than fear you I would have you hanged for what you are&mdash;for I
  am mistress at least in my own château&mdash;leave me before I have you flung
  out of my presence."</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten our ride to Guildo&mdash;when the Prince fell?"
  answered Enguerrand, his red brows frowning over his smile.</p>

  <p>Françoise did not wince but faced him undaunted, her head held very
  high.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said through bloodless lips, "and you are mad to remember
  it&mdash;mad to speak of it now&mdash;mad to think it could weigh with
  me&mdash;mad to venture to insult me so."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember your wedding day?" asked Enguerrand, always with his eyes
  on her. "And how Kristopher Fassiferne came to return you your betrothal
  ring? I was in the shadows and heard&mdash;and saw."</p>

  <p>"Then are you spy as well as traitor," cried Françoise furiously, "and
  none of this means anything to me!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, you have a fine courage," smiled La Rose Rouge. "Two
  letters now, from this same Kristopher Fassiferne&mdash;have you not missed
  them of late?"</p>

  <p>"If you have stolen them," she answered, with quivering lips but a high
  carriage still, "show them to all the world&mdash;he never wrote aught that
  could shame either of us."</p>

  <p>But she dropped her eyes and shook so that she could hardly stand as he
  laid on the table between them the packet he had picked up on the rocks.</p>

  <p>"Certainly he was cautious," he said quietly. "But they are
  something&mdash;these letters&mdash;and there is&mdash;this&mdash;and
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Françoise stared wildly as he put before her a letter of her own, written
  to Kristopher and never sent, passionate, written in her greatest
  misery&mdash;signed with her name.</p>

  <p>"You should have burned it," he smiled. "And, Princess, you should have
  opened these."</p>

  <p>They were Gilles' letters, those he had written to her from England, and
  the seal was unbroken.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get them?" asked Françoise, hoarsely, and Enguerrand's eyes
  sparkled and watched the keen effect of every word.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have spies in Chateaubriand," he said slowly, "where you left
  these, these that are proof enough I think, that my word be taken against
  yours&mdash;were I to show them to the Prince, enough to make him believe you
  wished his death and tried for it, enough to make you false and a murderess
  before all Brittany, all Brittany, and&mdash;your lover."</p>

  <p>Françoise shrank down into the chair with her face in her hands,
  conquered, humbled beyond concealment, and Enguerrand came closer, his soft
  voice very low; at the sound of it she looked up again with a ghastly
  distorted face and strove in vain to speak.</p>

  <p>"You should have visited your husband, Princess&mdash;" he said, "it hath
  been noticed&mdash;what I could prove would not long be doubted."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! <i>Mon Dieu</i>!" cried Françoise, finding her voice
  in a burst of agony, twisting her hands together. "What are you torturing me
  for? What do you want of me&mdash;I could not see him&mdash;I dare
  not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She ended in a shuddering sob and dragged herself up. "Maimed! disfigured!
  How have I lived this month? Oh! I have been so miserable you well may spare
  me more."</p>

  <p>His strange eyes never moved from her tortured beauty, but he was startled
  out of his sneer when he saw her go on her knees.</p>

  <p>"Here, in the very dust," she said, looking up with the tears running down
  a face distorted with pain. "Have mercy on me, Count! Spare Gilles' of
  Brittany!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand flushed scarlet with pleasure to see her there, he was
  coarse-souled enough to value this submission of her helpless distress, cruel
  enough to enjoy his pleasure, as he silently watched her stifling her tears
  back&mdash;in her pain unconscious of her humiliation.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" he said at last, his whole face glowing, "to think that
  you should do this for the thing you hate&mdash;or is it still what that man
  thinks of you? But either way, I'll not betray Guildo&mdash;for your
  sake."</p>

  <p>"Oh, swear it!" cried Françoise, staggering to her feet. "Swear it!"</p>

  <p>"Would you believe me if I did?" he said, with a smile no longer insolent
  but fierce. "What have I to swear by? There is little sacred to both of us,
  Princess, little sacred to either." He pushed toward her the letters lying
  between them. "Burn those to prove I'll not betray Guildo without your
  consent."</p>

  <p>And as Françoise stared at him, incredulous,' he picked them up himself
  and flinging them on the fire, watched them burn.</p>

  <p>"So, am I your friend indeed," he cried over his shoulder at her, through
  his red hair. "Now, thank me, Princess."</p>

  <p>But terror mingled with Françoise's relief, she grew almost more afraid of
  Enguerrand as he did this and asked nothing&mdash;a shrinking as if a devil
  had offered his friendship, and as he turned he read her thought.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of yourself, Princess?"</p>

  <p>"No," she whispered back. "But of you&mdash;why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>Till now she had thought only of herself, but something in his face and
  triumphant bearing made her pause. "You'll give up all this meant to you?"
  she continued wonderingly. "I&mdash;I never thought it&mdash;for what?"</p>

  <p>"For mine own ends," he smiled. "Always for mine own ends, Princess, but
  my ends are yours, I think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Françoise looked at him, bewildered. She was too much under his influence
  to imagine she had over him any of her own.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," she said. "But&mdash;from my soul, I thank you,
  Count&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say 'my friend,'" said Enguerrand, holding out his hand across the table
  she kept between them. He had done much for her, he asked for no return, and
  so she gave him her hand, something comforted&mdash;one friend at least, she
  thought, as Enguerrand's near presence and touch thrilled her into her old
  courage&mdash;what if he was a friend indeed&mdash;her stronger half?</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, then as she drew her hand away she smiled faintly.
  "I think I have your rose still&mdash;shall it be a pledge between us?" she
  added with a quick glance.</p>

  <p>"Now, on my soul!" cried Enguerrand, passionately, pleased beyond measure.
  "Kristopher Fassiferne was a fool to let you go!"</p>

  <p>Françoise flashed back responsive to the note in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Would you have done it?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Had I had blue eyes and you had loved me," smiled Enguerrand with an
  ardent face. "The world between had made no difference!"</p>

  <p>"I take my leave on that," said Enguerrand, triumphant at the door,
  brilliant, for all the sunless light, in his scarlet and gold. "While you
  still smile on me, Madame!"</p>

  <p>When he had gone Françoise felt strangely forlorn, at first above
  everything she had dreaded seeing him, and had been glad that he seemed to
  avoid her, but now he had proved himself, at least generous, and more
  courteous than she had dared to hope, she longed for the distraction from her
  wretched thoughts his converse gave, his lawless way of looking at life, the
  light way he regarded what she had done put her at her ease, raised herself
  in her own eyes, though he knew everything, she was no longer afraid of
  him&mdash;he was the one soul in Guildo she was not humbled before. He knew
  her secret and he was her friend&mdash;she felt more than a little proud that
  he had done so much for her, as she cast up all the tales she could remember
  of his wickedness and savagery.</p>

  <p>He had ended the anxiety she had felt this month in Guildo&mdash;her
  secret was safe with him&mdash;and for her sake he would not betray
  them&mdash;which in some way eased her soul of its burden toward her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"I would take you were all the world between, an' you loved me," he had
  said, and Françoise found herself wishing with a bitter sigh that Kristopher
  Fassiferne was more like La Rose Rouge.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-20"
     id="ch-20"></a>XX.&mdash;THE SCHEMING OF DENISE</h2>

  <p class="first">Count Enguerrand well kept the promise he had made
  Françoise. Montauban's spies returned discomfited; La Rose Rouge broke his
  betrothal to Odalie de Merle, refused to betray Guildo or Gilles of Brittany,
  refused to detach himself from the Prince's cause.</p>

  <p>And Guy de Montauban had placed his hopes on the character and precedents
  of the Lord of Bàrrès, he had been very sanguine of bribing him to betray the
  cause his unique power upheld.</p>

  <p>Furious in his disappointment, Montauban half suspected it was Françoise's
  influence again defeating him, though he had not thought Enguerrand a man to
  be swayed by a woman when his advantage showed another way.</p>

  <p>Whatever the motive behind this sudden change of front&mdash;for La Rose
  Rouge had dallied long with the Duke's offers&mdash;Montauban found himself
  baffled and defeated.</p>

  <p>But, though the Duke was a mere tool in his hands, and all Brittany his to
  use for his object, Françoise was still as far from him as on that day she
  had fled through the snow with Kristopher, and Montauban was half distraught
  with his bitter impatience.</p>

  <p>He lay at Chateaubriand with all his forces, as near to Dol as he could
  compass, as near to Guildo and Françoise.</p>

  <p>Yesterday he had been driven back by the English, he was smarting under it
  now, chafing under the delay of the French, sick with fury and impatience, in
  the mood to stake anything in one desperate attempt to take Guildo, he had
  grown reckless and indifferent as to the real objects of the war; Gilles'
  rebellion, the safety of the Breton throne, the triumphs of the English or
  the French had narrowed down to his personal hates and desires.</p>

  <p>He stood by the great fireplace&mdash;on the very spot where she had given
  him that letter, where she had kissed him&mdash;the whole hall was full of
  memories of her, he remembered her sitting in the window seat, singing, with
  topaz on her breast, and at thoughts of her eyes and voice felt he could
  almost forgive her&mdash;now, if she came back, felt it for one moment and
  the next second was clutching the arms of his chair, wishing he had her down
  before him and his fingers round her throat...Her treachery had roused a
  savagery in him he had himself beet unaware of.</p>

  <p>"Messire," said a voice softly. Opposite the other side of the red-tiled
  hearth stood Denise d'Estouteville, mountebank, court lady, juggler, beggar
  and spy, but to Guy only a sharp-witted page introduced to his service by
  that useful rogue d'Estouteville, who was useful at times when deftness
  counted more than courage.</p>

  <p>She drew the ribbons on her sleeve through her teeth, frowning, and waited
  for him to speak, looking keenly at his thin haggard face the while.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said wearily, and Denise smiled under her frown, coming to what
  she meant at once.</p>

  <p>"Send me to Bàrrès, Sieur," she said. "Let me deal with La Rose
  Rouge."</p>

  <p>"You?" said Montauban. He looked at her a moment in silence. "What could
  you do? Your bragging brother failed&mdash;spies are no use in Guildo."</p>

  <p>"I once knew Count Enguerrand, Sieur," replied Denise. "We had some
  tenderness for one another&mdash;at least he will listen to me."</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>!" cried Montauban, bitterly. "You are sanguine! Think you
  the Count will do for an ancient tenderness what he cannot be bribed
  to&mdash;do for a boy what he will not do for his advantage!"</p>

  <p>"Give me the chance to try, Sieur," said Denise, coming nearer. "At least
  it can do no harm."</p>

  <p>"It is mere child's folly," answered Guy impatiently. "Count Enguerrand is
  a very stone!"</p>

  <p>"Well," whispered Denise, still playing with her scarlet ribbons and
  speaking eagerly. "Well&mdash;if he fail, Sieur, I have hopes of
  another&mdash;send me to Guildo."</p>

  <p>Montauban looked up at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"Of another? who else could play the traitor?"</p>

  <p>There was a swift scorn at his dullness in her eyes, and she dropped the
  lids to conceal it, smoothing her dress with a smile and a catlike lightness
  of gesture.</p>

  <p>"I have done you good service, Sieur, for just reward if I do you a
  greater service, will you give me a greater reward? What will you give me if
  I tell you how you may take Guildo?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" said Montauban abruptly. "It is impossible to take
  Guildo but by force."</p>

  <p>"I want money&mdash;" said Denise. "The only thing I've ever cared
  about&mdash;not money that is enough to dazzle a page, but money that'll
  unlock the world's delights&mdash;a fortune, Sieur."</p>

  <p>"You are a strange boy," Montauban smiled faintly, "and direct of speech.
  If you know of what will get me Guildo, I'll buy it of you with&mdash;a
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"Then, send me to Guildo," she answered with brightening eyes. "If not La
  Rose Rouge, as I have said there is another&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>Their eyes met and Denise smiled.</p>

  <p>"My Lady Françoise."</p>

  <p>Montauban stared bewildered, the blood singing in his head at mention of
  her name&mdash;"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Sieur," said Denise, "I mean she will do it&mdash;the Prince's
  wife&mdash;the Prince is sick unto death and helpless&mdash;she hates
  him."</p>

  <p>Guy rose to his feet, a burning red in his thin cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;think she'd&mdash;betray him?"</p>

  <p>Denise nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sieur."</p>

  <p>"But not for me!" said Montauban bitterly. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! She may be as
  false as Hell&mdash;but very fear would keep her from that."</p>

  <p>"Very love would make her," answered Denise. "She'd do it for love not
  fear as I would word the message."</p>

  <p>"Betray Gilles for me?" asked Montauban, struggling between his doubt and
  hope. "If she wearied of him sick and maimed, would she credit me with such
  forgiveness as to betray him for me?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not for you&mdash;but for Kristopher Fassiferne,
  Sieur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, where learned you that!" cried Guy furiously. "Who taught you to
  couple his name to hers?"</p>

  <p>"Mine own eyes," said Denise quietly. "I know she loves him&mdash;I know
  also her love can be made her ruin&mdash;please you be not angered, Sieur,
  and listen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You go far on my patience," answered Montauban, crouching down in his
  chair again, biting his lips furiously. "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I may speak? Sieur, it is so plain&mdash;let her but think Captain
  Kristopher is without and through them all she opens the gates&mdash;She
  shall think him without, and so&mdash;the thing is done, Sieur."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Guy sullenly looking away.</p>

  <p>"Sieur!" smiled Denise. "It is easy! I take a message in to Guildo, from
  Captain Kristopher, I say, it tells her his wife is dead, it tells her he can
  yearn for her no more&mdash;this with what embellishment my fancy doth
  suggest&mdash;it tells her that he hath sacrificed his honour at
  last&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"His honour!" sneered Montauban. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! His honour!"</p>

  <p>Denise shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"So they call it&mdash;it says also, this message, that he will ride to
  Guildo and bid the gates be opened, coming for her, to take her on his heart
  to peace and liberty in France&mdash;waving therein all aside for this. And
  so, when some such men arrive, she will open to them."</p>

  <p>"She'll not believe it," said Montauban quickly. "She has seen you in my
  service&mdash;she is no fool&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! no fool&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Trust me for convincing her," replied Denise. "I'll to Dol first where
  this paragon commands, and steal some token&mdash;I'll succeed, Sieur."</p>

  <p>Montauban looked up at her, fired by some of her quiet eagerness.</p>

  <p>"I almost believe you will," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"You're a strange boy and a clever, if you should trick her into
  that&mdash;make her do it openly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Denise, with glittering eyes. "Openly! I'll so blind and
  madden her with her love she'll do it before them all&mdash;Gilles will
  know&mdash;all Brittany will know, her lover will know&mdash;she will be
  ashamed, a traitress and&mdash;she will lose his love&mdash;is not that a
  revenge worth paying for!"</p>

  <p>"And it shall be paid for!" cried Montauban with a flushed face.</p>

  <p>"Here's my hand on it, page." They clasped hands, standing on the
  brilliant tiles, and Guy's eyes searched her face, then dropped to her hand
  in his&mdash;it was the first time he had looked at her close.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;" he said. "Why..."</p>

  <p>He looked at her again, closely&mdash;paused a while, then smiled
  meaningly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed!&mdash;You are a strange boy I&mdash;so this is why you are even
  cleverer than your brothers!&mdash;this is the secret of your influence with
  Count Enguerrand&mdash;because&mdash;why&mdash;Madame!"</p>

  <p>"And that is why I shall succeed," answered Denise with her head high.
  "Because I am&mdash;Madame."</p>

  <p>"Trick her as you have me," said Montauban. "And I have no fears. Now what
  are you to have come to this?" he added curiously.</p>

  <p>"That is no matter." answered Denise defiantly, something proudly. "You
  pay for my services, Sieur, not my history."</p>

  <p>"Is it to be bought?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, but the price is high&mdash;and&mdash;I choose the buyer,
  Sieur."</p>

  <p>Montauban took some money from his pocket, counting it over on his hand in
  the red glow of the fire.</p>

  <p>"Here's for your journey," he said, giving it her, smiling. "I do not
  doubt of your success."</p>

  <p>"Nor I of my reward," answered Denise. "A fortune, Sieur."</p>

  <p>"Made you one with Count Enguerrand?" asked Montauban smiling more
  still.</p>

  <p>Denise tossed her head.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't his page," she said insolently. "Give you good even,
  Sieur&mdash;I am on to Guildo."</p>

  <p>"Give you Godspeed, page," answered Montauban gravely. "For your own sake
  as well as mine, you'll try and succeed, page."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-21"
     id="ch-21"></a>XXI.&mdash;MY LORD KRISTOPHER</h2>

  <p class="first">Kristopher Fassiferne, commander of the English and the
  Prince's forces in Dol, bore his part in the war with a quietness that
  revealed to none how large a part he bore in the Prince's success and how
  unhappy a heart lay behind the sweetness of his manner.</p>

  <p>The news of Gilles of Brittany's accident inflicted a deep pain that would
  not heal and a torturing self-reproach he could not reason away. He had
  brought him back&mdash;for this. He&mdash;his friend.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if all he had touched had crumbled to dust&mdash;his
  sacrifice had proved useless. Gilles was involved in a war that he could not
  reap the benefit of if he succeeded, and must bear the full penalty of if he
  failed. Françoise was tied to a cripple whom she could not love and might now
  hate, and his own wife drooped silent and miserable.</p>

  <p>"A fine coil I've made of it all!" he thought bitterly. "There'll be no
  one owing me thanks for what I've done!"</p>

  <p>Yet he had done the right, the only thing possible and Françoise had risen
  to his level.</p>

  <p>That one thing comforted Kristopher; she at least had proved herself
  worthy and he was deeply glad of it. He meant never to see her again and for
  that reason he refused to go to Guildo even when Gilles lay mortally
  ill&mdash;he could not face her over her maimed husband.</p>

  <p>And it added to Kristopher's dissatisfaction with himself that he saw
  Yvonne-Marie was wretched.</p>

  <p>All he could do he did, but he could not content her.</p>

  <p>"Only on love could we have been reconciled," she thought miserably, "and
  on his side there is no love." Yet he gave her as complete a trust as if she
  had never proved herself unworthy, he made no allusion to the past, and never
  questioned her as to her life those five years.</p>

  <p>And this very gentleness chafed Yvonne-Marie almost more than
  reproaches&mdash;his toleration was a harder thing to her than his
  anger&mdash;and at the back of her thoughts was always a vague feeling she
  could not define herself.</p>

  <p>It was jealousy of Françoise&mdash;a dim realisation of the truth that had
  come to her on Gilles of Brittany's wedding night when she had entered the
  chapel in Bàrrès.</p>

  <p>This spring morning she stood on the balcony of their house in Dol and
  shivered in the pale sunlight, and looked over the houses toward Guildo, then
  down at the creeper about her feet, faintly green with the first leaves, and
  as she gazed she saw two strolling players come into the courtyard beneath,
  the sun strong on their satin hoods&mdash;the man playing, the woman dancing.
  Yvonne-Marie drew back from the balcony and entered the room with a flush on
  her face, a flush often called to her cheeks at a thousand little sights and
  words, meaning nothing before, but much now to her sensitiveness, in the
  memories they recalled.</p>

  <p>In the low-arched chamber sat Kristopher writing, and she went straight to
  him and stood the other side of the table, her breath coming and going in
  great leaps with a long resolution finding vent at last.</p>

  <p>"My lord," she said&mdash;"My lord&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked up at her and she winced from the steadiness of his blue eyes,
  but the mad desire to know what was behind them drove her on.</p>

  <p>"I've come to speak to you&mdash;I cannot bear it any longer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher put his pen down in silence almost as if he had expected this,
  and Yvonne-Marie went on quickly. She had long meant to do this and her
  courage had risen to her need, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot live like this, my lord&mdash;on your tolerance&mdash;with the
  memory of what I did between us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure, I have forgotten," said Kristopher wearily. "Why grieve for
  it&mdash;or&mdash;speak of it?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> have not forgotten," answered Yvonne-Marie passionately, "nor
  have you&mdash;it's eating into my very soul&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then forgiven&mdash;either way dead and atoned for, my wife," he replied
  gently.</p>

  <p>"I have made no atonement," cried Yvonne-Marie. "Are you not banished,
  disgraced, outcast for me? Do I not know and see it every day, and can I
  think it dead? Let me tell, tell the truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher moved as if in pain.</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> I should not forgive," he said. "It's five years
  ago&mdash;who cares now for my dishonour? And it's&mdash;it's&mdash;not hard
  to bear&mdash;it's a fresh life I'm living&mdash;that's all over&mdash;don't
  you see&mdash;Yvonne?"</p>

  <p>"At least," she whispered, "it might&mdash;make you think&mdash;the better
  of me."</p>

  <p>"Dear heart," said Kristopher tenderly, "there is no need for that, sure."
  He could not bear to see she had turned away to hide her tears, and he rose
  impulsively, but she faced him again with her hands clasped tight over her
  gray dress.</p>

  <p>"I must do something," she said wildly. "Something! I am wretched beyond
  bearing! Why did you never ask me what I did those five years? Why did you
  forgive me without question? Without a word?"</p>

  <p>"I trusted you," he answered simply. "There was ever that about
  you&mdash;I never doubted you would remember you were my
  wife&mdash;an'&mdash;why questions? Would you be here now an' I thought you
  needed them?"</p>

  <p>"Would I were dead before I was here!" cried Yvonne-Marie looking at him
  with eyes shining through tears. "Do you remember at the convent
  gate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't," cried Kristopher sharply. "That's over."</p>

  <p>"Not over," she answered. "We're acting it now&mdash;you said You have
  done that that's severed us two forever,' said it and meant it&mdash;and it
  was true&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! true! true!"</p>

  <p>"Yvonne, Yvonne," he cried desperately. "There is no one in all the world
  I'd put before you, say what you wish an' I'll do it&mdash;can you ask
  more?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered with her head away, "not so much&mdash;and
  yet&mdash;yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>An officer entering with a message broke the pause, and she at least was
  glad of it, and crept out on to the balcony again, resting her head on the
  sun-warmed stone, her weary eyes toward Guildo.</p>

  <p>Presently he came out to her, with his sword and cloak on.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the walls, dear heart, they say Montauban comes
  nearer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She made no answer and he came closer.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me, Yvonne," he said, with a sudden bright flush, "I may be gone all
  day."</p>

  <p>The blood rushed into her white face and she drew farther away, crushing
  into the bare creeper.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" she whispered, and Kristopher winced at her tone and her averted
  face.</p>

  <p>"At least it's good-bye you'll be sayin'," he held out his hand wistfully.
  "If you knew how I'd be gladdened if you'd forgive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forgive!" murmured Yvonne, and she suffered him to take her hand and kiss
  it, and let him turn away leaving her, after hesitating a moment for her
  answer.</p>

  <p>A second later and he was back, suddenly flushed anew with pleasure at a
  thought that had come to him, he might be gone all day or longer, he would
  leave her in his place&mdash;as his lieutenant, in full trust. He said so,
  giving her the keys. There could be no greater mark of confidence, but the
  very eagerness he showed in his desire to show he trusted her made it
  valueless in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She thanked him, not looking round, and again he lingered a moment, but
  she said nothing more, standing quite motionless in the sunshine, till he had
  gone, then she leaned over the balustrade, eagerly, to see him ride out.</p>

  <p>The strolling disrevellers were still there, sitting in a corner with a
  group of soldiers, eating their dinner, bright patches of colour among the
  russet uniforms, like butterflies among withered leaves, and as Kristopher
  rode through, the man leaned low over his guitar and the woman drew her hood
  down, but Yvonne-Marie did not notice them, her eyes were following the
  little band of horsemen.</p>

  <p>"My lord, my lord Kristopher," she whispered. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! how I love
  you!"</p>

  <p>When she could no longer see him, she still leaned over the stone,
  wondering miserably what she might do now.</p>

  <p>Restlessly she began pacing up and down, going over every word and gesture
  of his&mdash;"What did it cost him to ask me to kiss him?" she asked herself
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>Then as she turned, she stopped, staring for she saw the singer in her
  orange hood standing in the open window looking at her.</p>

  <p>"Denise!" she gasped, in utter dismay.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered her sister, coming out on to the balcony. "All the morning
  have I been waiting for your fine lord to go&mdash;I came up now under
  pretence of telling your fortune&mdash;I have to speak with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll go," said Yvonne, trembling with surprise and shame. "I'll not
  speak to you."</p>

  <p>Denise laughed.</p>

  <p>"Am I not rather the one to be angered?" she said. "Think how you left
  us&mdash;with Sir Valerie, how you tricked Eneth that night&mdash;but for all
  that I've come to do you a service."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie was white with anger, she hated her sister now more than she
  had ever done, she stamped in her rage.</p>

  <p>"Leave this place at once," she cried. "Or I'll have you sent&mdash;what
  are you here for? to spy or steal? my lord left me in command&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hath he gone to Guildo?" interrupted Denise with a simper as she seated
  herself calmly on the balcony.</p>

  <p>"Denise," said her sister, the more angry she could not help a pang at the
  name. "I'll have you exposed for what you are if you won't go."</p>

  <p>Denise broke in again, smiling insolently. "And what am I, Madame
  Virtue&mdash;your sister! Oh, you're a fool," she added, "in a fool's
  paradise too, my Yvonne, if you think this husband of yours you won't have
  spied upon cares one jot for you!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" cried Yvonne, hoarse with passion. "Have you come to
  insult me&mdash;you&mdash;you shameless! Get you gone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You little fool!" said Denise, with a look of contempt. "I've come to
  help you&mdash;listen to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll not," cried Yvonne, "'tis treachery to him!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" mocked Denise, "how devoted you have become, my sister! Treachery,
  forsooth&mdash;don't you know he is mad with love for Françoise de Dinan and
  she for him&mdash;don't you know you're too indifferent to him for her to be
  jealous even."</p>

  <p>At the sudden shock of her faint fears confirmed thus in her sister's
  brutal words, all speech was struck out of Yvonne-Marie, she stood as if
  frozen, staring, and Denise seeing she believed, laughed, leaning along the
  stone.</p>

  <p>"What think you she married Gilles for if not to please him? for he is a
  pure Sir Galahad! Nevertheless, he loves her perhaps the more that their love
  went not beyond sighs and glances, even those atoned for in burdening himself
  with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie writhed, helpless, too weak to say she did not believe, too
  agonised to conceal her misery, and Denise surveyed her with a scorn in which
  there was no touch of pity. "He loves her because she is worthy of what he
  thinks her&mdash;and you are not."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" shrieked her sister. "I don't believe what you say&mdash;I'll not
  listen&mdash;how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I was Montauban's page," laughed Denise, "and saw it all&mdash;you see
  it, too, you believe it too, <i>ma chérie</i>! but we are wasting time,
  Yvonne-Marie."</p>

  <p>She looked at her sister with disdainful gray eyes, and her full red lips
  curled as Yvonne beat her hands against herself with the desperate action of
  a caged bird.</p>

  <p>It had been hanging over Yvonne-Marie she might one day meet Denise or her
  brothers&mdash;but to meet like this, unprepared, to hear this, know it true
  and not have the courage to scorn it, to feel herself feeble before the
  other's laughter&mdash;with a great effort she tried to collect herself,
  trembling pitifully, not daring to look at Denise.</p>

  <p>"What did you come for? Whatever it was go now&mdash;for pity's
  sake&mdash;don't say any more&mdash;I&mdash;I can't bear it."</p>

  <p>"You miserable, weak thing!" said Denise. "This is what I came to
  say&mdash;what if Françoise de Dinan was disgraced before all
  Brittany&mdash;brought as low as you? in his eyes, mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie dropped her hands from her face and a faint colour came to
  her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Why, that he'd despise her then, loathe her, and there'd be some chance
  for you&mdash;supposing he found her hollow and false as he found
  you&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Yvonne-Marie. "Oh!"</p>

  <p>And she looked round half-frightened, as Denise drew nearer still.</p>

  <p>"But she is noble&mdash;" she faltered. "She&mdash;would
  never&mdash;and&mdash;Oh&mdash;I could not have her trapped as I was
  trapped!"</p>

  <p>"We'll see, <i>ma mignonne</i>," answered her sister.</p>

  <p>"She's not so noble&mdash;she'd have thrown everything aside for
  him&mdash;she shall now&mdash;with your help I'll make her betray
  Guildo&mdash;and put her husband in Montauban's hands&mdash;before all
  Brittany."</p>

  <p>"Betray Guildo?" gasped Yvonne&mdash;"she&mdash;she'd&mdash;do it?"</p>

  <p>Denise nodded impatiently, feeling the time short.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I want your help&mdash;it serves my ends, you see, and yours. She
  must think he asks her&mdash;I want something to deceive her with&mdash;some
  token&mdash;his name or some paper&mdash;come&mdash;you said you had the
  keys&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her sister stared and Denise slipped impatiently from the wall and shook
  her by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool!" she exclaimed angrily, stamping her foot. "You have the
  keys."</p>

  <p>"You want them?" interrupted Yvonne-Marie, who had lapsed into a calm the
  other took for submission.</p>

  <p>Denise nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you must know how to use them, where his papers are
  kept&mdash;Eneth needs some copy for this letter he must write&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What will it say&mdash;this letter?" interrupted Kristopher's wife, and
  her sister answered with growing impatience.</p>

  <p>"It will ask her to betray Guildo, and thinking it comes from him she'll
  do it&mdash;now&mdash;the keys!"</p>

  <p>"You think so?" said Yvonne-Marie slowly, still with no attempt to comply
  with her sister's demands.</p>

  <p>"Never fear but she will disgrace herself," answered Denise, "all her
  inclinations lie that way, and I think to find an ally in Count
  Enguerrand."</p>

  <p>"You'll find none in me," said Yvonne-Marie under her breath, "for a
  moment, I&mdash;I was tempted&mdash;but not now&mdash;I've not come back to
  him to deceive him a second time."</p>

  <p>"You won't!" cried Denise, utterly astonished. "Why&mdash;don't you
  believe he loves her?"</p>

  <p>"The more I have to thank heaven and his chivalry that he came back to me,
  loving her," answered Yvonne-Marie with flashing eyes. "I am weak and
  vile&mdash;you speak the truth&mdash;he does not love me&mdash;I am not
  worthy of it&mdash;yet not so unworthy as to lift a finger either against him
  or Françoise de Dinan."</p>

  <p>Denise was silent in sheer vexation, she could find nothing to meet this
  unexpected turn of affairs, it had never remotely occurred to her
  Yvonne-Marie would refuse to play the traitor.</p>

  <p>Her sister, speaking faintly, broke the pause. "Will you go now, 'Denise?
  Don't say anything more of this to me&mdash;nothing can move me!"</p>

  <p>"You'll not help me?"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie lifted her great gray eyes&mdash;"No," she answered, "not in
  any way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not help me to bring him back to you!" cried Denise, she could not
  understand this sudden strength on her weak sister's part, it bewildered even
  more than it angered her.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned her quivering face away.</p>

  <p>"No," she said through her set teeth.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" exclaimed Denise in a fury. "But we shall succeed without
  you&mdash;I suppose your virtue won't make you tell him," she added with a
  sneer.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie stood immovable&mdash;she dared not show her weakness or
  reveal the wild tumult of her heart. She was afraid of Denise and held
  herself in lest she should betray how greatly she was moved.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you said," she answered as firmly as she could.
  "If the Prince's wife is vile enough to betray him&mdash;I&mdash;I shall not
  be called on to clear her&mdash;that&mdash;it&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah! you won't tell&mdash;" cried Denise triumphantly. "No, I'm not afraid
  of that&mdash;you'd like to reap the benefit without the trouble&mdash;for
  you understand well enough what I mean."</p>

  <p>It was the truth&mdash;Yvonne-Marie both understood and ardently wished
  Denise success, the thought of Françoise lowering herself in Kristopher's
  eyes was a brighter pleasure than she had known for a long while, but she
  stifled her feelings back and turned away with a firmness Denise admitted to
  herself, sullenly, was hopeless to shake.</p>

  <p>She had no time to waste in more words, they were on their way to Guildo
  and could risk no delay, so in silence she swung on her heel and flung back
  the way she came, through the window and the chamber.</p>

  <p>Not wholly in vain had she come; in passing through the castle she had
  picked up a little dagger that she had seen Kristopher wear in Rennes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-22"
     id="ch-22"></a>XXII.&mdash;IN DOL</h2>

  <p class="first">The sweet spring days, that were so fair for all the war and
  terror they looked upon in Brittany, wore away till five had gone since
  Denise came to Dol on her way to Guildo, and Yvonne-Marie, though outwardly
  going quietly about her life, was waiting with an intense eagerness for some
  news of her sister's success or failure.</p>

  <p>But this evening it was quiet within and without the castle of the
  commandant, and within the embrasure of the open window Yvonne-Marie played
  chess with Kristopher.</p>

  <p>Against the high-carved chimney piece leaned Enguerrand de la Rose. He had
  that day ridden from Guildo seemingly to bring reinforcements into Dol and
  order provisions for Guildo, in reality to observe Kristopher and his wife.
  They were part of a pattern he was skilfully fitting together, a pattern that
  when completed, should make him master of Françoise de Dinan's
  dowry&mdash;and, incidentally, herself.</p>

  <p>He was fond of watching people; it amused him to watch these two whose
  secret he knew, it amused him still more to torture them with little remarks
  they could feel and not resent, and as he knew they both disliked him and
  that he was only there on tolerance, his amusement grew a pleasure.</p>

  <p>Gregan Griffiths had requested Kristopher to come to Guildo to see the
  sick Prince, his ally and his friend. Enguerrand was charged with the
  message, and in his malicious hands it became another weapon wherewith to
  wound Gilles' friend. There had been a long silence in the chamber that La
  Rose Rouge now broke. He had been watching them closely, and Yvonne-Marie's
  strained silence and pale face and Kristopher's sad eyes had put him in high
  good humour.</p>

  <p>"So I'll tell Sir Gregan you won't come to Guildo," he said. "Though it's
  a pity&mdash;the Prince is lonely."</p>

  <p>A slight movement on Kristopher's part told how voice and tone had jarred,
  he answered slowly, with a visible effort.</p>

  <p>"Say I shall be serving the Prince better here&mdash;sure, what am I
  wanted for in Guildo?"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It seemed you might have wished to see the Prince&mdash;your friend."</p>

  <p>"They say it's no one he knows yet, Count, so the seein' me would be
  little service."</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge laughed.</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>! he hath little chance of knowing any," he said, "since
  none but servants come to him!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher dropped his rook and stooped with a flushed face to recover it,
  and Yvonne-Marie who had watched the chess-board till now, looked up with
  bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"What of the Prince's wife, Sieur?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My Lady Françoise is in love," said La Rose Rouge. "By her white
  face&mdash;her tears&mdash;her hate of her husband, her distracted
  voice&mdash;I know it now&mdash;with whom? It is amusing to guess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher sprang up suddenly, scattering the chess-men into his wife's
  lap.</p>

  <p>"She you speak of is our Prince's wife," he said hoarsely with his noble
  face angry and his eyes brilliant. "I'll hear no slander of her, Count
  Enguerrand."</p>

  <p>Enguerrand swiftly turned, too, like a man who sees his enemy suddenly
  face him.</p>

  <p>"I voice what every serving man may know," he answered insolently,
  "<i>I</i> it is who make the Prince's rebellion a success&mdash;at least I'll
  keep my tongue free. I say she makes no show of caring for Prince
  Gilles."</p>

  <p>"Why does it anger you?" cried Yvonne-Marie coming forward. "What is she
  to us, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"I neither know it nor believe it," answered Kristopher, turning to her,
  and she blenched before his look. "Dear Lord! what are we to judge&mdash;any
  of us here."</p>

  <p>They were silent before him, both of them. If Enguerrand meditated an
  answer he thought better of it and contented himself with a sneer and a shrug
  of his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If she were what you say five times over," continued Kristopher,
  mastering his first anger, flushing in his eagerness, "It's we have no right
  to speak of it&mdash;if I believed it, it's I would not hear you, Count."</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge laughed. Yvonne-Marie grew suddenly frightened lest this
  should go too far.</p>

  <p>"Will you play no more?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I' faith, no more," he answered stormily. "I'm in no mood for it,
  sure."</p>

  <p>"All because of a chance word against the Princess!" flashed Yvonne-Marie.
  "Oh, sorry am I I spoke against your paragon&mdash;who is very human after
  all, I doubt not!"</p>

  <p>"Yvonne-Marie," said Kristopher, turning away. "It's charity best becometh
  a woman. When you speak so&mdash;so ungenerous, sure, you hurt me."</p>

  <p>She had hurt him now she could see even by what the darkening room showed
  her of his face, but she stood silent and watched him go, and when the door
  had closed on him, she began picking up the chess-men, slowly. There was a
  moment's silence, broken only by the voices without, then Enguerrand turned
  yawning.</p>

  <p>"Madame the commander's wife," he said. "Good even to you, I must get to
  Guildo to-night."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie made no answer, great dislike and some fear of Enguerrand was
  struggling with a wild rage against herself.</p>

  <p>She leaned over the chess-men, choking, and Enguerrand came up and handed
  her a fallen pawn.</p>

  <p>"Your lord hath a quick temper," he whispered. "What will he say when he
  findeth Françoise of Brittany betrayeth Guildo?"</p>

  <p>The chess-men rattled to the ground again. Yvonne-Marie stood mute,
  staring, her eyes wide to catch his face in the uncertain light.</p>

  <p>"We've met before," continued Enguerrand. "You remember?&mdash;in Rennes,
  when I thought you were your sister&mdash;Denise, who is in Guildo
  now&mdash;belike, Madame, you wish her success? She told you, I think, of her
  errand there."</p>

  <p>"If she told you this much of me," answered</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie scarlet with anger and shame, "she must have told you I
  refused to lift a finger to aid&mdash;your&mdash;infamy!"</p>

  <p>"But you haven't told your husband for all this&mdash;and you won't," said
  La Rose Rouge. "Denise has given her the letter&mdash;and when it works with
  her&mdash;an' she's disgraced herself&mdash;well! you won't tell that letter
  was false, I think!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie looked at 'him as he stood in the firelight resplendent as a
  jewel from head to foot; flaunting and handsome and strong.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how vile you are!" she cried with an instinctive loathing. "I pray
  Heaven the Prince's wife may be delivered from your toils!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say amen to that prayer, my fierce saint," he answered. "But
  what is that to you&mdash;I say, will you tell?&mdash;but no&mdash;you
  won't."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, I do not know. I do not know! I can only pray she
  may not be tempted." Enguerrand watched her white distress.</p>

  <p>"She will do it," he said&mdash;"against herself. I will make her."</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie looked at him, startled.</p>

  <p>"You!" she cried again. "Why should you want this thing to happen?"</p>

  <p>"That's too long a tale for now," he answered. "Enough I'll do
  it&mdash;and you should be grateful."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, "you're afraid of me&mdash;you're sorry Denise told
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I am, but I am not afraid of you. I have seen you and the
  Englishman. You will not tell, Madame."</p>

  <p>He took up his cloak and sword from the chair and glanced at her
  covertly.</p>

  <p>But she made no sign of assent or refusal, she did not know herself What
  she should do, she hated Enguerrand and despised herself; but he watching her
  figure standing motionless in the circle of the window was satisfied.</p>

  <p>"We're safe from her," he said to himself and the little anxiety he had
  felt on account of Kristopher's wife was allayed.</p>

  <p>He rode back to Guildo that night under a delicate new moon and through a
  wealth of spring flowers, his thoughts busy with Françoise de Dinan. Denise
  had been in Guildo three days, for that time Françoise had had the letter; as
  yet she had given no answer, every time she was approached she asked for
  longer to consider and Enguerrand and Denise had to bear their impatience
  with outward quiet. Neither had any doubt that she would eventually fall, and
  Enguerrand had a second card to play should she long prove obdurate.</p>

  <p>It was night by the time he reached Guildo and few were abroad, but as he
  went down the long corridor to his quarters he noticed that a light burned in
  the little chapel at the end.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" he asked the servant who attended him, and as the man did
  not know he bade him wait for him at the foot of the stairs and taking the
  lantern went softly to the chapel door.</p>

  <p>The light that burned within was very faint, being thrown only by the
  candle that burned in front of the altar, and Enguerrand, looking through the
  half-open door, could at first distinguish nothing; then, with a sudden start
  he saw Françoise seated on the altar steps with her hands clasped round her
  knees.</p>

  <p>She wore a dark dress and her heavy black hair hid half the face that was
  turned to something lying on the step above her.</p>

  <p>On her lap lay the little dagger Denise had picked up in Kristopher's
  house and that they had given her as a token the letter was true.</p>

  <p>She sat perfectly motionless, and as his eyes became used to the light
  Enguerrand saw it was the letter she was studying so fixedly&mdash;and
  steadily, and fearful lest he should be seen, he drew back again and returned
  softly.</p>

  <p>So she could not sleep or rest for agitation&mdash;she was troubled enough
  to sit at night in that chapel studying their bait!</p>

  <p class="first">The next morning Enguerrand was abroad early in the woods
  outside Guildo. Denise had asked him to meet her there&mdash;Françoise, she
  said, had promised her answer this morning and she would bring it to him
  there at once.</p>

  <p>He was a strong ally to Montauban's spy, through him her admission had
  been made possible, through him it was possible for her and Eneth to live
  there under the very eyes of the angry English, with but a thin pretence to
  veil their occupation, and if Denise sometimes wondered at his protection she
  accepted it gratefully.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect morning, there were no signs in these beautiful woods of
  the bloodshed that stained Brittany; sunshine was everywhere, on the back of
  the gulls that came and went slowly, on the hawthorn meadows and the massive
  ramparts of the château, and on the flag of Gilles of Brittany that hung idle
  above. Underfoot were primroses, violets, lilies and fern, and through the
  young leafage glittered a turquoise sea. The spring tide was at its full.
  Enguerrand had not long to wait before Denise came running through the trees
  toward him, a paper in her hand.</p>

  <p>He looked up expectantly and noticed her face was flushed and her eyes
  bright.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked. "Well?"</p>

  <p>Denise flung closer through the daffodils, her blue and green doublet
  heaving over her heart.</p>

  <p>"She hath given it back," she cried furiously. "She bade me carry it to
  Montauban&mdash;who was the sender, she said! She vowed it was a lie!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Maledictè!</i>" exclaimed Enguerrand, genuinely startled and angered.
  "Did she not believe it came from the Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>! I know not!" answered Denise angrily. "I only know my
  pains are for naught, and that she'll have none of it."</p>

  <p>"She knows him too well," said Enguerrand frowning. "She knows his stiff
  pride and narrow creed would never permit him to do this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In plain words she bath more wit than we," flashed Denise. "She's seen
  through the lot of us!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he answered with a deeper frown. "I think it was a
  hair's weight in the balance that made her decide&mdash;I was pretty sure of
  her!"</p>

  <p>"And I!" cried Denise. "I was certain of success&mdash;<i>Maledictè!</i>
  must I go back to Montauban to prate of failure. No, <i>ma foi</i>&mdash;she
  <i>shall</i> betray Guildo!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Enguerrand, with a musing face, "she shall."</p>

  <p>Montauban's spy, pulling angrily at the daffodils, suddenly stopped and
  looked up at him with something of disdain and wonder.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want her to do this thing?" she demanded. "Why didn't you do
  it yourself, La Rose Rouge?"</p>

  <p>"What are your reasons, <i>ma mignonne</i>?" smiled Enguerrand. He was
  seated on an old log at the foot of the flowering almond, being simply
  dressed he looked younger, the colour in his face was natural, and the
  perfect handsomeness of his appearance was not marred by the usual
  affectations of his dress and manner, and Denise, looking at him in silence a
  moment before she answered, was filled with a mingled rage and
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"My reasons!" she cried somewhat bitterly. "Oh&mdash;the same I served you
  for&mdash;Montauban pays me well."</p>

  <p>"You served me because you loved me," said Enguerrand, looking up and
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"You insolent!" she answered with a sneer. "Think you you were more to me
  than the many I have served?"</p>

  <p>"Did you risk your life to save the many from a chance of danger?"</p>

  <p>"'Twas for my own ends," said Denise, but she coloured under her paint and
  he noticed it and laughed.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, I believe you love me still, <i>ma belle</i>!" he said,
  leaning back against the almond, the sunshine flecked over his green
  dress.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you hanged for a ducat, La Rose Rouge," she answered with rising
  anger. "I came not to Guildo to see you again&mdash;but because my mission
  took me here."</p>

  <p>"Yet would you make our quarrel up, Denise," said Enguerrand calmly. "I
  warrant you came for that too."</p>

  <p>"Our quarrel! our parting rather&mdash;we are too wise to quarrel as we
  are too wise to love&mdash;and too much alike to work together, La Rose
  Rouge," she laughed turning her sharp, still pretty face toward him with an
  impudent curl of her lip and a defiant toss of her head. "<i>Ma
  foi</i>&mdash;I think I had forgotten you until we met here in Guildo."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," answered Enguerrand lazily. "You're a clever rogue, <i>ma
  petite</i>&mdash;whom I've ever had a liking for&mdash;and I know I've only
  to lift my finger to bring you to my feet."</p>

  <p>"You think so?" said Denise scornfully, but she avoided the gaze of his
  red eyes, she was in the presence of the one person she was not at her ease
  with, the one she was slightly afraid of&mdash;the only being she had ever
  cared for.</p>

  <p>"I know it," replied La Rose Rouge. "I've never met a pride yet I couldn't
  melt&mdash;you wouldn't think Françoise de Dinan had been on her knees to me;
  she never knelt to her God, I think, but she knelt to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She did!" cried Denise, "Françoise de Dinan."</p>

  <p>"She shall come to kiss the latchet of my shoe," said Enguerrand, with his
  beautiful eyes sparkling. "<i>Morbleu</i>! she is pretty in her pride, she
  may keep it to all the world save me, but she, the proudest princess in
  Brittany, will grow to no more dare raise her eyes in my presence than you
  would, did I bid you."</p>

  <p>Denise's sense of fear increased, she felt vaguely sorry she had ever come
  to Guildo, she looked at the young hunter in the green, with the calm
  handsome face, and the hint of savagery in his mouth, and felt in her sore
  heart he spoke the truth. Enguerrand suddenly broke into a pleasant laugh and
  held out to her his shapely hand.</p>

  <p>"We are comrades in trade, at least," he said. "It's the object of both of
  us to make Françoise de Dinan betray Guildo&mdash;take my hand on it, <i>ma
  mignonne</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>! I do not understand you!" said Denise dropping his hand
  quickly. "I can see that you were willing to betray Guildo for your
  advantage&mdash;can see you found it more to your advantage to
  refuse&mdash;but why you would drive her into doing what you could do better
  yourself&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"Since it helps you, Denise," he answered indolently. "Why complain?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," she said abruptly. "I only wonder."</p>

  <p>"Because it suits me."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward through the flowering grasses and stroked the white dog
  lying in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>"It suits me, <i>ma mignonne</i>, that she shall disgrace herself before
  all Brittany&mdash;that Gilles shall die, that a certain Englishman in Dol
  shall see his idol fall&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" cried Denise startled. "You love her!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are jealous," said Enguerrand glancing at her, raising his red
  brows. "For all you did not remember me."</p>

  <p>"I was a fool not to see it," said Denise, very pale, her glance for all
  its scorn, fixed in the spring glory at her feet. "But she stands too high
  for you&mdash;there's too much between&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take you so much comfort from the thought, <i>ma belle</i>!" he smiled.
  "There's nothing between I'll not remove&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you do love her," cried Denise again, unable to keep the tears from
  her eyes and the bitterness from her tone.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"She'll be my wife," he said.</p>

  <p>"Even your devil's tricks can't accomplish that," she answered with
  flashing eyes. "There's Gilles of Brittany, Guy de Montauban, her lover and
  her pride between!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said La Rose Rouge with a look in his eyes that sent her cold. "I
  have them all in the hollow of my hand."</p>

  <p>"She hates you," said Denise.</p>

  <p>He rose suddenly, scattering the trailing blossoms, with a change in his
  indolent face, like a man thinking suddenly come to a decision.</p>

  <p>"Give me that letter she returned you," he said holding out his hand, but
  Denise put it behind her back facing him with bright eyes and an erect
  head.</p>

  <p>"She hates you," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he answered. "If she does she will not when she is a
  by-word for falsehood."</p>

  <p>"I see," interrupted Denise angrily, "you would disgrace her to your
  level&mdash;she shall betray, murder her husband&mdash;Oh! I see&mdash;La
  Rose Rouge, but remember, the man she loves is Kristopher Fassiferne."</p>

  <p>Enguerrand flushed and the latent fiend in his eyes sprang to life.</p>

  <p>"Take care how you use that name," he said. "Give me that letter."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Denise, drawing further away. "I'll not help you."</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge showed his white teeth in a smile, still holding out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What good will it do?" she said again. "She won't believe&mdash;she loves
  him too well."</p>

  <p>Then she suddenly cowered from the look on his face and half sank against
  the young chestnuts.</p>

  <p>"You do love her!" she cried for the third time.</p>

  <p>"Should it pain you so?" he asked, as angry now as she was, as savage as a
  roused wolf. "Give me the letter."</p>

  <p>"Never," said Denise setting her teeth, her blood up.</p>

  <p>"Never?" he echoed, coming close to her, and the next instant he had
  grasped her hand in his and dragged the paper from her, though she struggled
  furiously.</p>

  <p>"For your ends&mdash;why not mine?" he said, quiet and sneering again.
  "Two of a trade&mdash;we should work together, and not quarrel,
  <i>mignonne</i>."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-24"
     id="ch-24"></a>XXIV.&mdash;THE BETRAYAL</h2>

  <p class="first">"Madame, the Prince hath sent for you." Françoise stood at
  an open window looking over the sea when this message came to her.</p>

  <p>Of late she had seen her husband several times, as he grew nearer health
  she could no longer avoid it and after what Enguerrand had said of how they
  thought of her, her pride as well as her remorse made her treat him with
  tenderness. She sighed a little now and shut the window on the freedom
  without, but she felt nearer resignation than she had done for many
  months.</p>

  <p>The three days she had struggled with herself over that letter had been an
  intolerable agony for she half believed it came from Kristopher, but with
  returning it to Denise she had given herself a strange content, for the first
  time in her life she felt mistress of herself, strong enough to resist
  temptation.</p>

  <p>For the first time in her life, too, she, ever too proud for confidences,
  had eased 'her wretched heart in sincere prayer, spending all night on the
  floor of her room before the little ivory Madonna, vowing to the heaven she
  had never believed in that all the remainder of her life should be devoted to
  Gilles, and sobbing out her repentance till quiet stole over her, and all
  passion was frozen in her heart.</p>

  <p>As she passed through the chateau on her way to the Prince, she met
  Enguerrand de la Rose and stopped with a quiet dignity. She had seen little
  of him since he had given her his word not to betray them, a promise he had
  kept. His demeanour had been respectful and quiet, he had not sought her out,
  and she was grateful.</p>

  <p>"A fair morning, Sieur," she said smiling. She was in green, carrying a
  basket filled with jasmine and violets; among the delicate lace on her breast
  was a cluster of snowdrops.</p>

  <p>"Spring itself, Princess," he answered; he had a letter in his hand that
  told him Montauban's men were an hour's march off, he put it in his white
  doublet as he spoke, his strange red eyes intent upon her face with a great
  triumph. A slight fear smote her as she passed on she reasoned it
  away&mdash;"I am not in his power&mdash;he burned those letters, there is
  only his word&mdash;and he means me well."</p>

  <p>In the Prince's antechamber she bade the page following her wait, and,
  raising the silken tapestry, entered Gilles' room. The doctor sitting with
  him rose and left them alone, and Françoise laid her flowers on the table
  then came to the Prince's couch and kissed his hand.</p>

  <p>He was lying under the open window, dressed in scarlet, his pallid face
  raised on cushions, one arm strapped to his breast, a rich coverlet over his
  bandaged foot, his face drawn, more with utter weariness than pain.</p>

  <p>"Thank thee for coming, Françoise," he said, his still bright eyes fell on
  his beautiful wife. "So sweet a day I feared you might be abroad."</p>

  <p>"'Tis fair within Guildo as without, Gilles," she answered smiling, but
  she glanced out at the sea and he was quick to see the longing in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Guildo has grown a prison to you, Françoise."</p>

  <p>"Nay," she cried eagerly, leaving the flowers she was arranging to come
  and kneel beside him. "All my sorrow is for you, Gilles, the loneliness for
  you! <i>Mon Dieu</i>! what have I not brought you to! war and misery have
  been my dowry, my husband&mdash;I was not worth it."</p>

  <p>Gilles made no answer, his hand stole to the breast of his doublet as if
  feeling for something. She drew nearer, stroking his forehead caressingly,
  the snowdrops at her breast pressed his doublet, her voice was soft as a
  child's, her mouth as tender.</p>

  <p>"Gilles," she said, "you're sad to-day, and it's I&mdash;I who have made
  you so&mdash;you flung everything in the world aside for me!"</p>

  <p>He looked down into the upturned face, her pale beauty was like the
  drooping flowers rising and falling with her breathing, her presence filled
  the room like a perfume, like the sunshine.</p>

  <p>"Nothing matters to me if you love me, Françoise," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"Gilles," she pleaded. "Gilles, have I not said it&mdash;what makes you
  doubt me?"</p>

  <p>Again his free hand sought his breast and the action filled her with a
  strange terror, she knew not why. She rose, laughing nervously and began
  putting the flowers about the room.</p>

  <p>"Why should I doubt you?" said Gilles, following her with his eyes. "As
  you say, why? You waited for me long and faithfully, Françoise."</p>

  <p>For the third time his hand went up to his doublet and again her eyes
  followed fearfully&mdash;how changed he was&mdash;his very voice different,
  in an agony she wondered if he would ever be the old gay Gilles again. She
  could not look at him, but leaned over the violets, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Montauban has twice the power, twice the wealth," went on Gilles. "You
  left him for me&mdash;why should I doubt you?"</p>

  <p>The sunny air blew in strong and sweet, stirring the scent of the jasmine
  she held, lifting the black curls from her face, and showing a strange terror
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What makes you speak so strangely?" she said wistfully. "Why did you send
  for me, Gilles?"</p>

  <p>"Besides, have I not had your word?" he continued, unheeding of her
  question. "Your vows, your kisses? It must be that you love me,
  Françoise?</p>

  <p>"Am I not your wife?" she cried. "Gilles&mdash;your wife."</p>

  <p>His hand rose to his breast and stayed there. There was a long silence
  that she found fearful.</p>

  <p>"I'm maimed for life," He said at last, and Françoise winced and shuddered
  over her flowers as if he had called her murderess.</p>

  <p>"O no!" she cried desperately, the primroses falling from her cold
  fingers. "That is not true!"</p>

  <p>The cold horror of dreams seemed closing about her&mdash;she did not know
  this man she had maimed&mdash;he was not her husband but a ghost.</p>

  <p>Gilles smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I shall never stand again," he said. "Never be
  anything&mdash;but&mdash;what I am."</p>

  <p>His head dropped back as if he were exhausted, she could not guess his
  thoughts from his dull voice.</p>

  <p>"Lift me up a little, my wife." Tenderly she raised him on the
  cushions.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be sure of it," she said trembling. "But if it be true&mdash;I
  care not, Gilles."</p>

  <p>She noticed with a dread she could not reason away he had his hand on his
  breast and kept it there. She laid her arms around him, beseechingly, she put
  her cheek next his, kissed his poor thin hands and sobbed. "I'll never leave
  you, Gilles, never." And she was sincere, for the moment she meant it. But he
  shuddered under her touch and turned his head away on the cushion, moistening
  his lips painfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me so much?"</p>

  <p>"Have I not said so?" she pleaded, her dark hair touching him, her face
  very close. "I love you, Gilles." She drew his hand down and kissed it, her
  soft eyes full of tears.</p>

  <p>"Say that again," he said under his breath, and she noticed the veins were
  swelling round his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I love you, Gilles," she whispered, shuddering at her lie.</p>

  <p>With a sudden cry he flung her arms off and struggled half up on the
  couch, his face livid, and in a second she saw he knew and she screamed in a
  mad fear.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you devil!" he gasped with straining eyes, "You&mdash;devil!"</p>

  <p>She gazed back at him and crouched on the floor among the fallen flowers,
  speechless with terror.</p>

  <p>"Did you think I did not know you&mdash;murderess?" whispered Gilles,
  drawn with passion, shaking in his fury, and at the sight of his cruel face
  she screamed aloud again, huddling on the floor beside his couch&mdash;she
  had nothing to say&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <p>"Did you think I was fooled by you!" shrieked Gilles looking down at her,
  white and terrible. "Did you think I didn't know you tried to murder,
  me&mdash;even before I saw this."</p>

  <p>He was transformed, his face fiend-like...he was thrusting something under
  her eyes, Kristopher's letter&mdash;he was printing his hot fingers in her
  flesh. "You're going to betray me," he panted, struggling between his
  weakness and his passion. "But you'd kiss&mdash;me&mdash;first."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie," moaned Françoise. "He never wrote it."</p>

  <p>But Gilles had drawn himself up as far as he was able and she shivered
  away in mortal fear from his distorted face.</p>

  <p>"To strangle you now," he panted, his mad eyes on her. "To maul you till
  he turned from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, heaven, hear me!" cried Françoise crouching along the floor. "I am
  innocent."</p>

  <p>"When have I hated you the most?" continued Gilles, speaking in gasps.</p>

  <p>"When you left me alone to be a mock&mdash;or when you&mdash;came and
  kissed me Françoise&mdash;with his love letters in your breast?"</p>

  <p>"You do him bitter wrong," she cried. "I alone am what you think&mdash;and
  even I not wholly&mdash;" she staggered to her feet, her hands to her head
  desperately. "How did you get that letter?" she moaned. "I gave it back! It's
  a lie!"</p>

  <p>"The punishment I have for you," gasped Gilles, struggling with his
  breath. "I'll see you worse than&mdash;die&mdash;I've been quiet so
  long&mdash;only till I was strong enough&mdash;to speak&mdash;all the world
  shall know of this&mdash;know what you are&mdash;what he is&mdash;my faithful
  friend."</p>

  <p>He dropped back exhausted, choking, beating the pillows&mdash;he was
  terrible to look at.</p>

  <p>"That letter's a lie," whispered Françoise, wildly. "Whoever gave it
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's the truth," he gasped. "The Count gave it&mdash;had it from your
  messenger&mdash;your go-between&mdash;you devil!"</p>

  <p>The Count!&mdash;a fresh flood of thoughts rushed through Françoise's
  bewildered brain, she stood staring at Gilles' ghastly face, hardly seeing
  him, hardly hearing what he was choking out at her.</p>

  <p>At first she had been too stunned by the sudden horror of it to even
  think&mdash;but now...</p>

  <p>What if the letter <i>was</i> from Kristopher?</p>

  <p>"Look what you've made of me!" cried Gilles. "Look what I am&mdash;less
  than a man&mdash;why didn't you kill me&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! How I
  loved him&mdash;but I was a boy&mdash;a fool&mdash;was I to stand in the way
  of his man's love! And you&mdash;have laughed at me&mdash;you two&mdash;when
  he took your kisses&mdash;" He stopped, choking, his thin frame shaken, he
  might have been very old, his face was so wizen, his eyes so hollow.
  Françoise, erect, with clasped hands, stared at him dumbly, she was as deaf
  to what he said as if she had fainted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Dieu!</i>" he cried in an outburst of bitter agony. "That I had
  found you in his arms and he had killed me then!"</p>

  <p>He fell back groaning with pain, writhing in his anguish and fury.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Françoise through white lips. "Do you want everyone to
  know&mdash;do you want to kill yourself?"</p>

  <p>She hardly knew what she was saying; she stooped and picked up the
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Everyone shall know," whispered Gilles. "I'll cast you off as a soiled
  rag&mdash;I'll brand you&mdash;falsehood&mdash;itself&mdash;traitress
  and&mdash;murderess!"</p>

  <p>Her passions began to kindle at his deathly rage&mdash;in a quick flash
  she saw what it would be&mdash;the exposure&mdash;the shame&mdash;she was
  recovering slowly from her terror.</p>

  <p>"If it comes, it comes from me!" she cried. "I would have served you to
  the end, Gilles&mdash;of half of what you think I am innocent and he&mdash;he
  was never false to you even in his thoughts!"</p>

  <p>"He wrote that letter," muttered Gilles, pointing with shaking hand to the
  paper clasped in hers. "Your lover wrote it&mdash;there's his
  name&mdash;Kristopher Fassiferne. How I loved you both!" With a bitter cry he
  threw his hand over his face, sobbing in sheer weakness.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" muttered Françoise again. "He's innocent I tell you&mdash;can't
  you understand&mdash;I don't think he wrote this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She seemed to see quite clearly, to feel quite calm, but she swayed
  forward across the end of his couch and slipped from there to the floor and
  could not rise.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Gilles turned and seeing her so close gave a little cry and
  leaning from his bed clutched at her and dragged her close.</p>

  <p>"If I had a knife," he whispered to himself. "I'd kill you now."</p>

  <p>He was dizzy with a hate that gave him strength to hold her there,
  bruising her, shoulders with his tight fingers.</p>

  <p>She was white and passive, and drooped against the scarlet bed, motionless
  in his clutch.</p>

  <p>"My wife!" muttered Gilles hoarsely. "You&mdash;my wife!"</p>

  <p>Then Françoise suddenly roused struggled to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am!" she shrieked. "And I've lied to you&mdash;and I've tried to
  murder you&mdash;and I would again for I hate you and I love him&mdash;though
  I've not sinned as you think I have&mdash;I would have done&mdash;mark you I
  would have done&mdash;but for his honour&mdash;I've done all this and I'll
  betray you now!" With a wild effort she flung him off and dashed him aside,
  and fled from the room.</p>

  <p>"My lord is ill," she said in a wild voice to an attendant without. "Look
  to him&mdash;he knows not what he says."</p>

  <p>And she went back along the corridors, her face as white and cold as
  marble, but her breast heaving hard and her eyes hot. She looked up from her
  agony to see Enguerrand de la Rose standing before her with his insolent
  smile, gay in his embroidered clothes, linked and laced with steel.</p>

  <p>All her rage and scorn rose to her lips, she was not afraid of him
  now.</p>

  <p>"Much was I mistaken in you!" she cried. "I knew you vile, Count&mdash;but
  not quite so vile as this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A noise and shouting from without interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"The French!" said Enguerrand, looking from the window. "He has come."</p>

  <p>"And he shall enter!" cried Françoise, superb in her passion, her white
  bosom heaving under the torn flowers, her eyes a madness.</p>

  <p>Outside was the clatter of the soldiers, and La Rose Rouge's face lit and
  flushed with joy, he turned in an excitement as great as her own.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>&mdash;'tis the only way to silence Gilles&mdash;in
  Montauban's case," he said smiling.</p>

  <p>"Come near me and I will strike you," said Françoise, with blazing eyes.
  "Silence him&mdash;no, I'll show to all the world who is my lover&mdash;take
  up shame, disgrace&mdash;and happiness."</p>

  <p>She stood erect, proud, triumphant and when Sir Gregan Griffiths and the
  English officers entered, with them the seneschal of the château, she saw
  them through a red passion and laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Who stands for the Prince here?" cried Gregan Griffiths. "Three hundred
  armed men without demand admittance in the name of the King and the
  Duke&mdash;how best may we answer such insolence?"</p>

  <p>"You will admit them," cried Françoise recklessly, facing them. "I stand
  for the Prince, open the gates."</p>

  <p>For a moment they looked at her in incredulous silence, then Gregan
  Griffiths spoke, slowly and meaningly.</p>

  <p>"For a certainty Montauban is with these men," he said sternly. "If he is
  it is death to the Prince to admit him, Madame."</p>

  <p>"Open the gates," she said, never blenching. "I am mistress here&mdash;"
  she turned to the horror-struck seneschal with a great colour flaming in her
  face. "You hear me&mdash;admit them!"</p>

  <p>"Madame!" thundered Gregan Griffiths, "on your life you shall
  not&mdash;not a soul will obey you to do this thing!"</p>

  <p>"Are you turned disloyal to your master's wife?" she cried. "Then with my
  own hands will I unbar the gates."</p>

  <p>"It shall not need, Princess," said La Rose Rouge behind her. "I have men
  will obey."</p>

  <p>"Count," cried Gregan desperately. "This will be betraying Guildo!"</p>

  <p>"It will be obeying the Prince's wife who rules here," answered
  Enguerrand, and he whispered some orders to a man near him.</p>

  <p>"I need you not for an ally," said Françoise wildly. "And you, Sieur, may
  leave Guildo an' you fear treachery."</p>

  <p>"Treachery!" exclaimed Gregan, goaded beyond bearing. "Aye! what else from
  traitors&mdash;I have only a handful of men."</p>

  <p>"I obey the Princess's orders," interrupted Enguerrand. "All the men save
  your few obey me&mdash;and so the gates open, Sieur."</p>

  <p>With a cry of rage Gregan turned away and his men followed 'him, furious,
  down the hall.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand laughed, his men were opening the gates, he could hear even the
  rattle of the chains of the portcullis, a fear and a confusion had come over
  Guildo, several people fled across the hall, Françoise stood motionless, her
  eyes on the door.</p>

  <p>She seemed to have forgotten La Rose Rouge, when he spoke she started</p>

  <p>"You have a splendid courage," he said smiling. "You will be
  free&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall be free of your toils!" she cried with burning eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are so sure?" answered Enguerrand, and the little imp danced up in
  his eyes and his smile was cruel, but Françoise was lifted above all fear of
  him&mdash;her eyes were ever on the door, her ears straining for the sounds
  without&mdash;he had come&mdash;come&mdash;he loved her enough for that! And
  she, she would go to him before them all&mdash;she would be free of Gilles'
  hate.</p>

  <p>The hall was filling with armed men who entered with little ceremony,
  sweeping all aside before them, the light in her eyes brightened, she stepped
  forward and Enguerrand laughed, leaning against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Where is Gilles of Brittany?" demanded the leader of the soldiers.</p>

  <p>"Ask the Princess whose orders admitted you," said La Rose Rouge.</p>

  <p>"The Princess!&mdash;Françoise de Dinan!" said he who had spoken before,
  and raising his visor he showed the face of Guy de Montauban.</p>

  <p>"You!" whispered Françoise. She glanced round the ranks of armed men.
  "You!"</p>

  <p>"False, and ever false!" said Guy with a sour smile, motioning some of his
  men forward. "Go now and search for Gilles of Brittany," he said to them and
  as they left the hall she stepped forward impulsively looking at them wildly,
  like a prisoner before her judges, with Enguerrand's red eyes upon her the
  while, calmly through all the babble and confusion.</p>

  <p>"Where is&mdash;" the name died on her tongue, she looked round again, the
  truth breaking in on her slowly, and Guy watched her, knowing whom she looked
  for, and finding a stern pleasure in the anguish dawning in her face. The
  chamber was full of distant noises, the men behind Guy looked at her
  curiously too&mdash;there was not one who did not scorn her.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she said at last. "Oh!" and fell back a pace, staring.</p>

  <p>"The English have escaped," said another officer entering. "Shall they be
  pursued?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Montauban, tearing his eyes from Françoise. "Let them carry the
  news of this to Dol. I meant they should."</p>

  <p>Françoise turned her eyes on Enguerrand slowly, then on Guy and so from
  one to the other&mdash;as if she understood&mdash;at last.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-25"
     id="ch-25"></a>XXV.&mdash;THE PRICE OF TREACHERY AT BOWEN</h2>

  <p class="first">She was quite quiet, not a sound escaped her as she watched
  Guy order his men over the château, as she saw her servants
  arrested&mdash;saw the keys given to Montauban&mdash;saw the scorn of all
  turned toward her, but Enguerrand who stood unnoticed in the shadow, saw the
  great tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You are our prisoner, Madame," said Montauban. "I hold Guildo
  now&mdash;you will remain here as such till&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Such is the King's will," said the Frenchman beside him, in a gentler
  tone, moved to some pity by her beauty. "Even your present loyalty cannot
  atone your past disobedience."</p>

  <p>Guy spoke again harshly. "Where is the Count Enguerrand? Is he our ally or
  no?"</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge spoke from where he stood, without altering his position.
  "Sieur, he and his men are in the Western tower."</p>

  <p>"And you?" asked Montauban sharply.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge answered without hesitating: "One who helped your spy."</p>

  <p>"Some men to Hardouinaye with the Prince," ordered Guy, taking no more
  heed of him. "You, Sir Amedée, look to the Princess&mdash;I go to find La
  Rose Rouge."</p>

  <p>In the confusion Enguerrand spoke to Françoise eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Now," he whispered&mdash;"now&mdash;come with me to Bàrrès&mdash;I can
  free you." His hot hands held hers tightly&mdash;she looked up at him dully
  and silent, but he saw his chance&mdash;Sir Amedée was speaking to Guy.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" he cried, but she resisted.</p>

  <p>"No," she muttered. "I will not."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but you shall," he whispered, looking over his shoulder.
  "Now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I loathe you," she cried suddenly, her blood up, her hate of herself
  adding to her hate of him.</p>

  <p>"And I," cried Enguerrand gaily&mdash;"I love you!"</p>

  <p>He saw it was hopeless, the soldiers were closing round them, but he put
  his arm round her, he took her chin in his hand and kissed her tear-stained
  face; she winced as if his eyes that came so close had burned her, and
  shuddered, but he held her tight.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur!" she shrieked in torture, and he let her so suddenly and faced
  those who came up, turning and swinging his sword out&mdash;his men were
  running into the hall, his men and his dogs. The French fell back a second,
  calling for help and in that second Enguerrand turned again and tried to drag
  Françoise from the tapestry where she clung, but his enemies were upon him
  and he was forced to defend himself, somewhat desperately. The hall was
  filled with fighting. Taken by surprise the French were driven back,
  Enguerrand's men outnumbered them, too&mdash;he would escape. In all her
  shame and misery somehow Françoise could feel glad of it, though a moment
  before she would have killed him herself&mdash;gladly. He fought
  magnificently, cutting his way to the door. She watched him, proudly; she
  almost forgave his shameful usage of her in the thought that he must love her
  enough to gain her anyway&mdash;he did not put her last&mdash;like
  Kristopher&mdash;Kristopher who had not come&mdash;Kristopher whom she almost
  hated now.</p>

  <p>She stood alone, unheeded, they had left the hall, she could hear them
  fighting in the courtyard&mdash;the shouting, the clash, then more soldiers
  trooped past her and it struck her she was a prisoner&mdash;Montauban's
  prisoner. She wished she had gone with La Rose Rouge, she wished they had
  sent her with Gilles&mdash;she remembered his face. "They'll kill
  him&mdash;they'll kill him," she whispered&mdash;she tried to call out but
  her voice died away, she tried to go to the window but her limbs failed her,
  she stood motionless staring, her passion, utterly dead now, had left her
  very weak.</p>

  <p>The French were pillaging Guildo, they paid no respect to the woman who
  had admitted them, she was no longer a Princess, a noble lady in their eyes,
  in her very presence they pulled the rich arras from the walls and quarrelled
  over the gold and silver vessels.</p>

  <p>One of the men held a silver bowl against the light, it slipped from his
  hand, rolled to her feet and struck against her foot. It was the vessel she
  had filled with violets that morning in Gilles' chamber, the blood rushed to
  her white face and she found words to speak.</p>

  <p>"Where is your lord?" she said. "Where is the commander of the French?"
  All eyes were turned on her. Some looked ashamed, some laughed, none
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Know you who I am?" she cried, goaded almost beyond bearing, clenching
  her hands till the nails entered her flesh. "The mistress at least of
  Guildo." She came out farther into the room to find herself, as the door
  opened, face to face with Montauban.</p>

  <p>"Am I your prisoner?" she cried with a desperate effort to look him in the
  face. "Do you want me to be insulted?" Montauban ordered his men away, and
  till the last had gone, said nothing, not looking at her, but when they were
  alone he raised his eyes and answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are my prisoner&mdash;do you remember our last meeting?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Day and night since," continued Montauban, very quietly, "have I been
  praying for a chance to see you again."</p>

  <p>"You meant to kill me?" cried Françoise desperately. "Spare what you have
  to say&mdash;I have no excuse&mdash;I wronged you bitterly."</p>

  <p>"I am no murderer," smiled Guy. "Why should I wish you dead? I would make
  you feel what I have felt."</p>

  <p>She interrupted him, turning quickly. "You sent that letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Ah! and&mdash;and he&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Kristopher Fassiferne knows nothing of all this," said Montauban calmly.
  "He is with his wife&mdash;in Dol&mdash;now <i>should</i> I wish you dead?
  'Tis harder to live, belike, Madame."</p>

  <p>She went to the window seat slowly and sat there silent, a long while, the
  tender sunshine full over her bent figure, the hawthorn smiling behind her,
  the blossoms and the blue.</p>

  <p>"I have received what I have given," she said at last, with a great
  effort. "I have deceived and been deceived and I have
  been&mdash;very&mdash;vile&mdash;but I am punished, you could wish no more
  than this."</p>

  <p>She paused, struggling with her breath. "Would you
  leave&mdash;me&mdash;now, alone?"</p>

  <p>Guy stood silent&mdash;he was thinking that the moment he had looked
  forward to so long was a poor triumph after all, but Françoise looking up at
  his dark figure, saw no pity there, and spoke again with trembling lips.</p>

  <p>"My husband has cursed me, with his hate, Sieur de Montauban. I am
  disgraced before all Brittany&mdash;am I not sunk to your
  pity&mdash;yet?"</p>

  <p>"Before all Brittany," answered Guy torn between his pity and his hate.
  "Before Kristopher Fassiferne, Madame!"</p>

  <p>"You'll tell&mdash;<i>him</i>?" she said, raising her head, and all Guy's
  fury rose at the horror in her face.</p>

  <p>"It shall not need for me," he said bitterly. "Gregan Griffiths has ridden
  to Dol and Count Enguerrand&mdash;Tell him? what think you I did it for if
  not for this? The worst for&mdash;you&mdash;and for him."</p>

  <p>"He'll understand," cried Françoise sharply.</p>

  <p>"He'll never know," answered Guy, and he stooped and picked the crumpled
  letter from the floor where she had dropped it. "He will never know your
  treachery was for him."</p>

  <p>"Think you I'll not tell how I was duped?" she said desperately.</p>

  <p>"You will have no chance," said Montauban quietly. "You are a
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>"The Prince&mdash;the Prince will tell."</p>

  <p>"I have means of silencing the Prince, Madame. Gregan Griffiths doth not
  know&mdash;he thinks it wanton falsehood&mdash;my spy will not tell&mdash;his
  wife will not tell&mdash;nor, I think will the Count&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again Françoise was silent, twisting her fingers together, her head very
  low.</p>

  <p>"You have indeed punished me," she said at last without looking up.
  "Almost&mdash;enough."</p>

  <p>"You should be pleased," cried Montauban. "At least you bear all the
  shame&mdash;his name is untouched&mdash;for did it not suit me better this
  way he had been disgraced again as he was before."</p>

  <p>"And as falsely," answered Françoise rising. "He did no deed in all his
  life a saint would shame to own."</p>

  <p>"The greater fool you to think he sent that letter," said Guy, his rage
  rising. "Fool and shameless you, Françoise de Dinan&mdash;boasting in your
  disgrace&mdash;flaunting what you should hide&mdash;yes I you would have
  opened the gates to him under your husband's eyes&mdash;gone down to him
  before all Brittany."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said the quieter as he lost control of himself, able to face
  his insults better than his calm. "For I love him and it is the one true
  thing in all my life."</p>

  <p>Montauban looked at her, baffled; he had torn her heart as a child the
  wings of a butterfly, he had taken all she valued in life from her, and her
  helpless quiet under it stung him with a sense of defeat, a bitterness near
  to tears.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it?" he cried. "Why did you deceive me so bitterly?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered wearily with a restless movement of her hand.
  "You're avenged methinks&mdash;where is Gilles?"</p>

  <p>"Gilles is my prisoner," said Montauban laconically.</p>

  <p>"He could not stand," whispered Françoise. "He was carried, Madame, to
  Hardouinaye."</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything&mdash;of me?"</p>

  <p>"He was swooned when they took him hence," answered Guy sternly.</p>

  <p>"Then was I spared his curses!" cried Françoise wildly and slipped on to
  her knees. "Leave me now, Montauban!"</p>

  <p>"I too go to. Hardouinaye," said Guy. "You are a prisoner here and soon I
  shall come back to you."</p>

  <p>Françoise did not hear him, her head had fallen on the window seat, her
  eyes were closed and hidden, she did not hear the door swung to on Montauban
  or the noises of the chateau coming through the open window, she was utterly
  regardless whether any watched her or not as she lifted her face for a second
  with a dismal little cry like a beaten animal.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher will curse me&mdash;Gilles too&mdash;all will curse
  me&mdash;except&mdash;one&mdash;Enguerrand&mdash;Enguerrand!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-26"
     id="ch-26"></a>XXVI.&mdash;THE ATONEMENT OF YVONNE-MARIE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was the morning after the fall of Guildo when Yvonne-
  Marie opened her window on to flowers and the unending quiet to watch the
  mists break before the sun.</p>

  <p>It was May-day.</p>

  <p>The memories of other May-days came back to Yvonne-Marie; she thought of
  London and the apple blossoms out along the meadows about Westminster; it was
  as if a sting had touched her to the heart as the keen feel of their scent
  came back to her.</p>

  <p>She was alone, Kristopher had been abroad all night and when she heard the
  clatter of hoofs below, she looked down eagerly thinking it might be he
  returning. But it was a party of dishevelled torn horsemen who galloped up
  and Yvonne-Marie's heart stood still when she recognised La Rose Rouge in
  their leader.</p>

  <p>Quickly she drew from the window with a sharp feeling that she was face to
  face with it at last&mdash;face to face with the moment that had been
  haunting her for days.</p>

  <p>She gathered herself together a moment, then descended rapidly to the
  lower chamber.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Count?" she demanded of the few English gathered there. "I
  saw him enter&mdash;but now."</p>

  <p>"He is without, asking for my lord," was the anxious answer.</p>

  <p>"Bid him come in to me," said Yvonne-Marie. "I fear some disaster."</p>

  <p>And after they had gone she stood facing the door with bright eyes and
  parted lips, her head held high.</p>

  <p>It was some moments before he entered, the confusion of his followers
  dismounting came to her; then careless laughter, the quick questions of the
  English, and the tramp of the tired horses; and while she waited Yvonne-Marie
  pulled the curtains back from the window and let the early sunshine in in
  sleepy patches of gold on the panelled walls and drew a deep breath of the
  fresh jasmine scented air that filled the chamber with sweetness.</p>

  <p>Count Enguerrand's voice as he entered stirred all her control into fear,
  but she was silent till he had closed the door and come to the table, though
  her wide eyes were studying closely his embroidered clothes torn and
  bloodstained, his left arm in a bandage, his face white and his eyes heavy
  with fatigue. He sank into a chair with an air of utter weariness, but there
  was no mistaking the triumph in his bearing.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Yvonne-Marie, "you have succeeded!"</p>

  <p>"She has betrayed Guildo," he answered, "and I have come to tell Captain
  Fassiferne."</p>

  <p>"Alas! poor soul!"</p>

  <p>Before he spoke she had known what he came to say, his words brought no
  shock or bewilderment, but a great added hatred of him of which her words
  were an expression.</p>

  <p>"You should be pleased," said Enguerrand, frowning at her. "Think what
  this means to you&mdash;<i>Morbleu</i>! she is shamed before all
  Brittany."</p>

  <p>She put her hand to her forehead a moment and sat down opposite him, her
  elbow on the table. His red eyes were watching her curiously.</p>

  <p>"He won't believe you," she said at last.</p>

  <p>"Maybe&mdash;Gregan Griffiths and his wife are following me&mdash;they
  bring the same tale&mdash;not assured he'll be convinced."</p>

  <p>"What has happened to the Prince?" she asked in the same level contained
  voice.</p>

  <p>Her colourless face betrayed neither horror nor delight but Enguerrand
  felt no fear of her, he looked upon her as false as her sister and far
  weaker.</p>

  <p>"Gilles hath gone to Hardouinaye," he replied, "as Montauban's
  prisoner&mdash;thinking both his wife and his friend false&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"His friend!" cried Yvonne-Marie, looking up. "Did he too believe
  Kristopher sent that letter?"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand nodded.</p>

  <p>"But when he saw it was Montauban who came?" she questioned.</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he thinks your lord is leagued with the French. I only know that he
  is sure that he wrote that letter."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Mon Dieu</i>!" muttered Yvonne-Marie, "<i>Mon Dieu</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Where is your husband?" demanded Enguerrand, turning impatiently.
  "<i>Pardieu!</i> how long he is!"</p>

  <p>He began pacing the room and she turned slowly and watched him&mdash;with
  narrowing eyes.</p>

  <p>"This seems to give you great delight, Count," she said at last. "It seems
  to give you great pleasure to give my husband pain&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"Why will it please you?" he returned mockingly. "Both reasons lie equally
  deep."</p>

  <p>And he turned to and fro the window again, savagely biting the ends of his
  curls with an impatient frown.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie's great gray eyes were still following him; she noticed the
  stains on the bandage of his arm and how he winced as he moved it.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"No, I thank you," he answered, and twisted the scarf tighter with a
  muttered curse at Kristopher's delay.</p>

  <p>"You're weary," said Yvonne-Marie again. "Doubtless you rode fast to bring
  the news the first."</p>

  <p>She went to the cupboard and brought out wine and glasses, quietly as if
  he had been the bearer of ordinary news.</p>

  <p>"We're strange allies, you and I," laughed La Rose Rouge as he took the
  wine, and she shuddered and moved away.</p>

  <p>"He is coming," she said quietly and moved away from her watch at the
  window.</p>

  <p>Count Enguerrand pushed back his tangled hair from his flushed face
  eagerly and smiled to himself in pure triumph, but Yvonne-Marie was trembling
  with downcast eyes she hardly raised as her husband entered.</p>

  <p>"Sure, it's early you are, Count," said Kristopher, with a glance at the
  other's clothes. "Hath there been fighting?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply he went to his wife; he had a little piece of
  apple blossom in his hand that he gave her with a half-apologetic laugh.</p>

  <p>"It was so pretty it looked," he said, "I picked it outside the gates, for
  sure, dear, it minded me of your face."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie murmured some reply and hid her face in the pink and white
  flowers, and Enguerrand could hardly forbear an open mock.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Kristopher, turning to him with a smile.</p>

  <p>He flung his gloves and his cap on the table and</p>

  <p>La Rose Rouge's exultation was heightened by his utter
  unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>"Sure it's not ill news you're bringing?" asked Kristopher suddenly struck
  by something in the silence.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like a bearer of good tidings?" answered Enguerrand, coming
  forward. "I bring bad news&mdash;the worst."</p>

  <p>Kristopher stood gazing at him, arrested in his movement.</p>

  <p>"What?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Guildo hath fallen."</p>

  <p>Kristopher made a sudden furious movement. "And you here to tell it!" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" answered Enguerrand. "For Guildo fell by treachery!"</p>

  <p>There was a second's silence, Yvonne-Marie shrunk closer to the wall, and
  Kristopher paused in his passionate outburst like a man dazed by a sudden
  blow.</p>

  <p>"Whose treachery?" he asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"There was only one in Guildo to profit by treachery&mdash;the Prince's
  wife&mdash;Françoise de Dinan opened the gates&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," interrupted Kristopher haughtily, the blood rushing into
  his face. "A lie to shield your own black treachery!"</p>

  <p>"It is the truth&mdash;she opened the gates to the French and Guy de
  Montauban."</p>

  <p>"Stand back from me!" cried Kristopher furiously, his hand on his sword.
  "Or I'll put that across your face shall prevent your ever lying more!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand's sneering triumph changed into sudden wrath.</p>

  <p>"It's true!" he cried. "As true as I'll make you feel it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" interrupted Yvonne-Marie, coming forward. "Gregan
  Griffiths&mdash;I hear him without&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Enguerrand, dropping against the wall gain. "You'll listen to
  him belike?"</p>

  <p>All the devil in him had sprung into his white face and there was such a
  note of conviction in his voice that a second time Kristopher paused.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my lord," said Yvonne-Marie faintly. "The English are here to confirm
  or disprove this news!"</p>

  <p>He did not seem to notice her but he wheeled round sharply to face the
  door, and as it opened, he sprang forward.</p>

  <p>"Is it true! Is it true, Gregan Griffiths?"</p>

  <p>Gregan Griffiths stopped startled in the doorway at the wild appeal and
  the mad horror in his brother-in-law's face.</p>

  <p>"The saints help us!" he murmured, overcome with weariness. "It is
  true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And he sat down wearily, his wife hanging on him.</p>

  <p>"We've been flying for our lives, Kit," she said, all trembling. "We are
  near dying!"</p>

  <p>But Kristopher took no notice, he went up and shook Gregan by the
  shoulder, crying out for the truth&mdash;the truth!</p>

  <p>"Aye, the truth," demanded Enguerrand imperiously. "Take the truth from
  there!"</p>

  <p>"Hath not the Count told you?" cried Gregan. "We are undone&mdash;the
  Prince is in Montauban's hands&mdash;we are betrayed."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" asked Kristopher heavily. "Will you drive me mad? Can't you
  answer me?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" moaned Kilda, frightened at his vehemence. "What ails you,
  Kit?"</p>

  <p>"The Princess betrayed us!" exclaimed Gregan. "Françoise de Dinan!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand broke into immoderate laughter.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe now?" he asked. "Have you come to the knowledge every camp
  follower owns that Françoise de Dinan is a traitress!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned on him with a distorted face.</p>

  <p>"Don't dare to call her that!" he shouted. "You who were there and could
  have prevented it!"</p>

  <p>"She was the mistress in Guildo," flashed Enguerrand, coming nearer, and
  Gregan rose, startled at Kristopher's passion.</p>

  <p>"She did it," he said, "I heard her orders&mdash;" Kristopher interrupted
  him with an imperious gesture, his face inflamed, his eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"Keep back from me!" he cried. "You who come to prate of what you watched!
  Just God! was there not one man there&mdash;not one to strike her down before
  she did this thing! To kill her before she damned herself to all
  eternity!"</p>

  <p>He swung Gregan aside&mdash;he went leaving them staring at each other,
  too silenced to stop or follow him.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>! this passionate gentleman hath uttered insults that must
  be answered&mdash;I did not betray Guildo!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, be silent!" flashed Yvonne-Marie, moving for the first time since
  Gregan had entered. "If you had not goaded him, he had not insulted
  you&mdash;" she turned her white face to Gregan&mdash;"I pray you heed him
  not&mdash;he knows not what he says."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it is enough to craze any man," the English knight answered.</p>

  <p>"It means the last of the war to us belike&mdash;and almost certain death
  to Gilles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet is it rare for him to be so moved," said Kilda wonderingly, "I will
  after him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Yvonne-Marie stepped in front with an imploring face.</p>

  <p>"Let him be&mdash;his pain is greater than you guess," she said.
  "Exceedingly he loved the Prince."</p>

  <p>"Yea," mocked Enguerrand, "Exceedingly he loved&mdash;the Prince, I doubt
  not!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned her large clear eyes on him with an unfathomable
  look.</p>

  <p>"What is there to mock at in a brave man's woe?" she asked; and La Rose
  Rouge shrugged his shoulders and admired her for the good face she put on
  it.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering what the lady's motive was," he said slyly.</p>

  <p>"Saints! what matter for the motive!" cried Gregan Griffiths miserably.
  "Her false heart alone knows&mdash;I ever hated her&mdash;she is false to her
  heart's core."</p>

  <p>"Think no more of it now," said Yvonne-Marie gently. "You are
  weary&mdash;forgive me I thought not of it sooner&mdash;my lord will be
  better soon."</p>

  <p>As she left the room to attend to them, Enguerrand looked after her with
  lifted brows and a little smile.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi!</i>" he said to himself, "she takes it well!"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The perfect day had faded into a perfect night, through the open windows
  of the commander's house came songs and laughter, lamplight and colour. Count
  Enguerrand and his men were feasting with little care for the news they had
  brought.</p>

  <p>Hardly did La Rose Rouge try to veil his deep triumph&mdash;he had
  redeemed himself from Gregan Griffiths' suspicions by his fleeing from Guildo
  instead of joining with Montauban, and little it troubled him that any should
  think him careless of this disaster.</p>

  <p>But, though the house was so gay, there was one chamber dark and quiet.
  And there Yvonne-Marie sat and looked out on to the torch-lit streets where
  soldiers and citizens were arming. She had been there all day and the hours
  had not seemed long to her. She had come to the moment&mdash;the test was
  before her&mdash;it was now or never that she must speak.</p>

  <p>Chief of all her wild thoughts was that of Gilles in Hardouinaye,
  believing Kristopher a vile traitor&mdash;they had said that he was to
  die&mdash;if he died undeceived, cursing Kristopher&mdash;she felt her blood
  freeze as she thought of that.</p>

  <p>And Kristopher believed Françoise had betrayed Guildo for
  Montauban&mdash;"And I," said Yvonne-Marie, "I know the truth."</p>

  <p>She turned from the window and began pacing the room; there was no one to
  help her, she must decide for herself alone&mdash;if she did not tell no one
  would, Kristopher would not know Gilles' bitter woe. Gilles could not be
  undeceived, Françoise would go branded forever in her lover's eyes.</p>

  <p>It was late already, early to-morrow Kristopher would leave Dol, she had
  little time to do the thing her soul shrank from as flesh does from fire.</p>

  <p>She left her room and went on to the stairs, and hardly knowing what she
  meant to do, saw her actions no farther than the moment ahead and as if
  groping in the dark she went forward trembling.</p>

  <p>"Where is my lord?" she asked a page who passed her, carrying wine to
  those who feasted below.</p>

  <p>"Madame," was the answer, "he sits apart in the room above the hall."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned and went along down the passage.</p>

  <p>The room where Kristopher sat was little used. Yvonne-Marie found the door
  as usual closed, and a dread seized her he was not there.</p>

  <p>But when she entered softly, she saw him, a dim figure in the dark,
  outlined against the window.</p>

  <p>His head hung down, he leaned heavily against the wall&mdash;there was
  something in his attitude that told her he was broken-hearted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Dieu!</i>" whispered his wife through cold lips and she came
  forward swiftly.</p>

  <p>Kristopher looked up and she stopped away a pace and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Why do you sit so long?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;it's only to think&mdash;" he answered, forcing a smile, and
  turned to her as she came up to him with tense eyes and gazed into the face
  that was revealed to her in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>She quivered and blanched before the anguish she saw there and could not
  speak, but Kristopher took her hand gently.</p>

  <p>"It's not grieving for me you must be," he faltered, "I'm&mdash;only
  weary&mdash;and the loss of Guildo&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, she had never seen such misery as lay in his blue
  eyes&mdash;it frightened her, she cowered back with a mad desire to rush
  away, and he seeing some of her dumb terror made an effort to speak
  again.</p>

  <p>"Dear heart&mdash;it's not troubled you must be&mdash;" Yvonne-Marie sank
  down on the window seat beside him and stared into his face.</p>

  <p>"Is there not any comfort I may give you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He moved from her scrutiny with a movement of uncontrollable agony.</p>

  <p>"Neither in heaven nor earth is there any comfort for me!" he answered
  hoarsely. "Oh, leave me alone to get my strength back!"</p>

  <p>It was the cry of a despair too deep to heed to whom it spoke, she saw his
  control was giving way, that his shoulders heaved, that he kept his face from
  her hidden in his hand.</p>

  <p>She felt the awe and shame the sight of great pain always gives, but at
  the sight of him, she rose to the best that was in her for the first time in
  her life.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher!" she said, "Kristopher!" and she leaned forward and caught
  his free heavy hand in hers, with the thought only of comforting him, and it
  seemed strange to her she had ever thought it would be difficult. Her words
  came simply as a child's.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher&mdash;she was trapped&mdash;she did not open the gates to
  Montauban but to you&mdash;to you&mdash;they deceived her&mdash;she did not
  know what she did."</p>

  <p>He turned and faced her so suddenly, seized her hands and stared at her so
  wildly, that she gave a little cry.</p>

  <p>"What do you know?" he demanded; and she slipped down to her knees before
  him, looking white as a lily in the dusk.</p>

  <p>"I know you love her!" she cried. "That she loves you&mdash;that for love
  of you she betrayed Guildo!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" broke in Kristopher, letting go of her hands suddenly. "You
  know all this&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>"Yea," she answered passionately. "Forgive me, I did not spy on
  you&mdash;or her&mdash;it came to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" shuddered Kristopher, "you'll shame me to the dust!"</p>

  <p>And he struggled to his feet but Yvonne-Marie clung to him and would not
  let him pass.</p>

  <p>"This is not talk of me," she said. "Forget me&mdash;I come to tell the
  truth, to justify Françoise de Dinan&mdash;nay, you shall hear me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For in sheer horror and bewilderment he strove to stop her, but she sprang
  up from her knees and put herself in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me!" she cried. "You shall, you must! She betrayed Guildo for
  your sake&mdash;she was deceived&mdash;as I stand here I know it!"</p>

  <p>And standing before him, with her face uplifted, she poured out the whole
  story, and he listened, held silent by the force of her intense sincerity,
  for so eager was she to convince him, so utterly forgetful of herself, so
  lifted above all jealousies, all thoughts of anger or fear; that what she
  said became almost impersonal, she appeared to have no part in her own story,
  save where it touched him, her absolute single heartedness gave her a great
  power.</p>

  <p>And Kristopher grew so intent on what she said, he almost forgot who it
  was spoke; and she did not care that he looked at her with unseeing eyes and
  gave no heed to what it cost her to raise his idol up again, she only waited
  eagerly for the horror to lift from his face, and for the misery in his eyes
  to fade.</p>

  <p>"And you must forgive her!" she ended passionately. "I should have done
  it&mdash;any woman would have done it&mdash;she did not know what she
  did&mdash;put her back in your heart again&mdash;say I have made it right
  between you!"</p>

  <p>But Kristopher's face did not alter, he stared at her as if he did not
  know her, she was expecting great rage against Enguerrand and Montauban who
  had used his name so vilely&mdash;or a burst of love for Françoise, but
  neither of these things came and she could not fathom his thoughts from his
  white face and fixed eyes.</p>

  <p>Desperately she fell to pleading with him and dropped on her knees in an
  agony.</p>

  <p>"Are you not comforted!" she cried. "Oh, have pity on her weakness and be
  comforted! for she loves you!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned his head slowly, he did not seem to notice she knelt or
  yet to hear what she said.</p>

  <p>"The Prince," he asked under his breath. "Did the Prince see that
  letter&mdash;does he think it's a traitor I am?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas! I fear me so!" she answered, the tears rushing to her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"He believed!" cried Kristopher. "He believes it now!"</p>

  <p>"But you must rescue him&mdash;and tell him the truth," said Yvonne-Marie
  eagerly, startled that this was all he seemed to understand or care
  for&mdash;"And she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who?" he interrupted, still staring down at her with that dazed look that
  made his face a mask.</p>

  <p>"Françoise de Dinan," she answered with a sudden sob. "She was bitterly
  wronged!"</p>

  <p>"What is Françoise de Dinan to me?" said Kristopher slowly. "I had forgot
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But she did it for love of you!" implored Yvonne-Marie.</p>

  <p>But the words seemed to mean nothing to Kristopher.</p>

  <p>"The Prince!" he repeated wildly. "The Prince! He may die in Hardouinaye
  and never know!"</p>

  <p>"Hardouinaye must fall!" cried Yvonne-Marie and the words called
  Kristopher to life like a trumpet call, his numb heart leaped and the hot
  blood rushed into his white face.</p>

  <p>He was springing towards the door when she caught hold of his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"To Hardouinaye!" he answered, all on fire now. "To prove to Gilles I am
  not what he thinks!"</p>

  <p>"You'll take the French?"</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;not leagued with such as Enguerrand&mdash;I and the English
  ride now&mdash;alone to Hardouinaye! The Leopard of England&mdash;alone!"</p>

  <p>And lifting her from his way as if she had been a child, without one look
  or thought for her, he dashed through the door and down the stairs and a
  second later she heard him shouting for his men.</p>

  <p>"But he cannot take Hardouinaye with that handful!" she cried bitterly.
  "And Gilles will die without knowing!"</p>

  <p>For well she knew neither Montauban's nor Enguerrand's hate of Kristopher
  would be content to let Gilles know the truth&mdash;he was utterly in Guy's
  power and Enguerrand had his spies in Hardouinaye.</p>

  <p>"What if after Kristopher came beneath the walls they&mdash;murdered his
  friend?"</p>

  <p>The thought came to her in a flash, she crouched down in the window seat,
  half deafened by the noises of the confusion without, and disturbance and
  clatter of Kristopher's sudden departure.</p>

  <p>She felt no bitterness at the manner of his leaving her, she had expected
  no gratitude for what she had done&mdash;her one thought was how she might
  aid him. "The Prince must know!" she kept repeating to herself. "The Prince
  must know!"</p>

  <p>A sudden quiet, broken only by the laughter of the still undisheartened
  revellers, told her that Kristopher had gone, and she rose with a sudden
  resolution that brought her great strength.</p>

  <p>"I will go to Hardouinaye&mdash;I will tell Prince Gilles the truth."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-27"
     id="ch-27"></a>XXVII.&mdash;SNARED</h2>

  <p class="first">It was some days later and things stood as they had done,
  Kristopher had arrived without Hardouinaye, but all his desperate purpose had
  not helped him to any success.</p>

  <p>He was as far as ever from freeing Gilles and by no sign or message had he
  been able to communicate with the prisoner. His helplessness was near driving
  him mad, he hardly ate or slept, there was only one thought in his
  mind&mdash;to repair some of the wrong done Gilles of Brittany and to clear
  himself in his eyes.</p>

  <p>All his other hates and loves faded into nothing beside this, there
  existed no soul in the world for him but the crippled prisoner of Hardouinaye
  who had once trusted him and called him friend.</p>

  <p>Count Enguerrand hung back in Dol and would send him no aid, for more
  reasons than one he did not wish Kristopher to rescue his friend. On that
  point he and Montauban were one; both ardently wished the death of
  Françoise's husband and for the same reasons&mdash;because he was her husband
  and Kristopher's friend.</p>

  <p>And if Gilles had been in Enguerrand's power he had died before this, but
  Montauban lacked courage, he could not face the thing so the prisoner
  lived.</p>

  <p>But La Rose Rouge was not to be held long in check by Montauban's
  ineptitude; half his plot had been successful, the other should be so too.
  Kristopher's wild departure from Dol had roused his suspicion that
  Yvonne-Marie had played&mdash;as he termed it&mdash;false, and this suspicion
  grew a certainty when Kristopher's wife with her friend Héloïse disappeared
  from Dol, and no trace could be found of either.</p>

  <p>It utterly surprised him to think she should, but there was no longer any
  doubt in his mind that she had&mdash;and bitterly he cursed Denise's
  thoughtlessness in confiding her secret to her sister. Yet he did not credit
  Yvonne-Marie with anything more than a wild setting out in disguise to join
  her husband and this was confirmed by the account of one of his men who had
  met them on the road to Hardouinaye dressed again as dancing women, riding
  their mules.</p>

  <p>And on hearing this, Count Enguerrand shrugged his shoulders and
  magnificently dismissed a foolish woman from his mind; Yvonne-Marie had shown
  more spirit than he had given her credit for, but he was far from suspecting
  her of any determined action either of good or evil.</p>

  <p>As passionately as Kristopher had vowed the Prince should live to know the
  truth he had vowed Gilles should die and his thoughts were all for that.</p>

  <p>There was one in Hardouinaye whom he could trust&mdash;Denise; she was in
  Guy's confidence and had free access to the prisoner, and to please La Rose
  Rouge she would not stop at murder.</p>

  <p>He was sure of her, but he waited, hoping Montauban would free him of
  Françoise's husband; it would suit him better if Guy branded himself as a
  murderer and left his hands clean.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Duke had ordered his brother to appear at Rennes to answer a
  charge of treason before his peers, and Montauban could not long hold back,
  both his own side and the adherents of the Prince demanded an open accusation
  and an open hearing for Gilles.</p>

  <p>There was little time; a few days would see Gilles in Rennes, out of reach
  of them all, beyond Kristopher's rescuing, beyond Guy's hate and Enguerrand's
  malice&mdash;he would be put on his open trial and before all Brittany the
  truth would be revealed.</p>

  <p>Then, in a sudden flash, Enguerrand saw his last move plain before him. It
  had been one of his fears that Yvonne-Marie in telling the truth to
  Kristopher&mdash;as he made no doubt she had done&mdash;had justified
  Françoise de Dinan in her lover's eyes and put her back in her old place in
  his heart, and now he saw how he might a second time sunder these two,
  utterly and forever.</p>

  <p>Acting upon this he wrote to Françoise, a close prisoner now in Guildo
  and, professing still he was her humble ally, put before her the state of
  things as he foresaw them.</p>

  <p>By common consent of both parties, he wrote, a truce would soon be
  declared while Gilles was heard in Rennes.</p>

  <p>There was little doubt that Kristopher would raise the siege of
  Hardouinaye for this; it was to his interest to have Gilles out of
  Montauban's power, it was to his interest to have an open hearing for the
  Prince and himself at Rennes&mdash;to tell Gilles that way, the truth.</p>

  <p>And what is the truth they will both bruit abroad?</p>

  <p>Enguerrand put this question to Françoise in his letter and then answered
  it thus:</p>

  <p>"Gilles knows of what you tried and failed in, he is but waiting his
  chance for his revenge&mdash;Brittany and Kristopher Fassiferne know you a
  traitress now&mdash;if the Prince speaks they will know you&mdash;a
  murderess.</p>

  <p>"Shall the Prince live to execute his revenge&mdash;shall he tell
  Kristopher Fassiferne that that shall make him treble his loathing of
  you?</p>

  <p>"For the betrayal of Guildo you have your excuse&mdash;for the other
  deed&mdash;none.</p>

  <p>"One you may so extenuate that he shall forgive&mdash;the other you can
  never. And if this man is nothing to you, Prince Gilles' words will touch you
  in other ways; all Brittany will hold you a by-word for shame, you will be
  undone, disgraced, all men will have nothing but fury for you, and if Gilles
  dies of his weakness, Kristopher Fassiferne's hate may drag you to the block
  to expiate your deed by a shameful death.</p>

  <p>"Foreseeing all this, is it your will the Prince should go to Rennes or
  that Kristopher Fassiferne should rescue him?</p>

  <p>"I am your friend, I have the means to serve you, a word from you and
  Gilles is silent forever and you are safe.</p>

  <p>"Shall he before he leaves Hardouinaye?</p>

  <p>"If you say so it is done and your secret safe with me.</p>

  <p>"If you do not answer this, the Prince lives&mdash;haste, for the time is
  short."</p>

  <p>This letter was sent to Françoise in Guildo; she was not kept so closely
  that she might not receive messengers or send them, and Enguerrand's
  temptation was delivered into her own hands. With some curiosity he awaited
  her answer, it would make no difference to his actions, Gilles must die, it
  was plain Montauban would not dare it, therefore he must and would, whether
  Françoise returned a yes or no.</p>

  <p>He had already sent his instructions to Denise in Hardouinaye with many
  cajoleries and flatteries and he felt no fear he should not be obeyed. But he
  wanted Françoise to compromise herself&mdash;he wanted her name to a piece of
  paper ordering Gilles' death that he might show it to Kristopher, he wanted
  to put her in such a position that she had to turn to him in her desperate
  shame. He wanted Kristopher to scorn her so&mdash;to come to such an open
  voicing of that scorn, that all her love would turn to hate and she would
  turn from him in fury.</p>

  <p>"I want no woman whose heart is with another man," he thought. "One way or
  another she shall hate him."</p>

  <p>He was not going to run the risk of her thrusting <i>him</i> over a cliff
  for Kristopher Fassiferne or opening the gates of Bàrrès as she had those of
  Guildo.</p>

  <p>He meant she should come whole-heartedly&mdash;with hate for all the world
  but him.</p>

  <p>Therefore he waited eagerly for her answer, sometimes with hope, sometimes
  with fear. He had no clue to what her mood might be in her lonely prison,
  whether she had grown desperate or tame, bitter or humbled&mdash;he could
  only wait.</p>

  <p>Outside Dol lay encamped his mighty army&mdash;to move to Hardouinaye
  soon, for Enguerrand intended to rescue Gilles&mdash;when he was dead.</p>

  <p>Montauban had but a few men with him, if La Rose Rouge had joined
  Kristopher's little force he would have taken it days ago&mdash;now he meant
  to take it&mdash;to sweep Guy de Montauban from his way as he would Gilles
  and Kristopher.</p>

  <p>All the war through he had played fast and loose, the balance of power was
  in his hands and he had used it skilfully for his own advantage&mdash;it had
  suited him so far Montauban should be successful, it suited him now he should
  be overthrown and he had the means to accomplish both wishes.</p>

  <p>It was a fair afternoon when Enguerrand rode leisurely out from Dol to
  this camp to pass, in surveying his men, the time that might elapse before
  any answer came from Françoise.</p>

  <p>As he left the town and came into the open country scattered thick with
  tents and huts, he lifted his eyes more than once to where the distant trees
  hid Guildo and the sea.</p>

  <p>In the meadows where the tents were pitched, grew close daisies and
  anemones and in the hedge-rows and little woods near by the hawthorn was
  mingled with the elder that rose from fiery daffodils. But the spring beauty
  was in part despoiled; rough trenches had been dug in sweet grass, fires had
  scorched the young trees and the heavy iron wheels of cannon pressed dead
  flowers.</p>

  <p>The air, that only the birds should have disturbed, was full of shouted
  commands, the ringing of armour, and the sound of the falling tents, and
  against the sky fluttered bright pennons and banners that waved from sharp
  spears. Enguerrand rode quietly in and out the tents and the long slanting
  shadows, stopping now and then to speak to one of the men, till he came to a
  quieter part of the field where a great bank of primroses sloped up to a
  little grove of beech.</p>

  <p>Several ladies sat there, their stiff skirts spread about them, glittering
  little caps and nets on their bright hair and on their laps flowers they
  twisted into chains.</p>

  <p>They were the wives and daughters of the Bretons that followed
  Enguerrand.</p>

  <p>One was mending a great scarlet banner that trailed over her white dress
  into the primroses, and another, seated higher on the bank than the rest, was
  singing:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The red may looks out in the garden,<br>
    The white may on the hill,<br>
    The spring is in the air, Anton,<br>
    And my heart will not be still."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Enguerrand drew his horse up and watched them, and they, noticing him,
  fell laughing among themselves, but she who sang continued with an
  affectation of unconsciousness:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "I am kissed by the youth of the morning,<br>
    The swallow bath brushed my breast,<br>
    I see no cloud on earth or sky<br>
    And yet I know not rest!<br>
    <br>
    "Songs come up from the clover,<br>
    Where the milk-white sheep are laid,<br>
    Around my feet is the sunshine,<br>
    Around my heart the shade.<br>
    <br>
    "The crocus hath jewelled the grasses,<br>
    Lilies my garden fill&mdash;<br>
    The spring is in the air, Anton,<br>
    And my heart will not be still!"
  </blockquote>

  <p>She ceased, and looking over her shoulder, laughed too, while Enguerrand
  rode nearer, smiling.</p>

  <p>"So you are not afraid of us, <i>mes dames</i>?" he said. "Nor of the
  cannon or the swords or the prospect of fighting?"</p>

  <p>The foremost lady tossed her head. "Of the first not at all," she
  answered. "Of the others, a little perhaps."</p>

  <p>"But there'll be no fighting," said another looking up. "At least not
  here."</p>

  <p>"Unless it be for your favours, demoiselle," said Enguerrand, at which she
  blushed and laughed again and the lady who had sung, a beautiful blonde in
  deep blue, flung her zither down and rose.</p>

  <p>"You seem to something lack for work, Sieur," she said with a glance at
  the rider on the white horse. "But not for pleasure," he answered. "In this
  company&mdash;a monk might forget his missal."</p>

  <p>As he finished he turned quickly, his ear caught by the sound of
  approaching footsteps.</p>

  <p>It was the messenger he had sent to Guildo, with a packet in his hand.</p>

  <p>The letter was from Françoise, her heavy seal was across the back, her
  fine writing across the front.</p>

  <p>"How found you the Princess?" questioned Enguerrand and turned a flushed
  face to the messenger.</p>

  <p>"Weary and bitter, Sieur, her women say she rails and frets against her
  jailers like a mad thing&mdash;she seemed pale too and wild-eyed."</p>

  <p>"Now who bid you mark her pallor or her eyes?" interrupted Enguerrand
  imperiously. "<i>Morbleu</i>! when I send you on messages to dames I desire
  you not to lift your eyes higher than their feet."</p>

  <p>And dismissing the man with the insolence that earned him universal hate,
  he rode to his tent and entering, broke the seal of her answer.</p>

  <p>The evening sun fell through the open canvas pleasantly red and all the
  noises of the camp seemed mingled into harmony by the peace that surrounded
  them; Enguerrand was alone but he hesitated a little with the open letter in
  his hand, the light catching his tall figure and beribboned sleeves as he
  stood a second with his red eyes frowning. Then he opened the parchment out
  and read it word for word with a slow eagerness.</p>

  <p>Thus it ran:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Sieur:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your letter findeth me lonely and weary&mdash;if they keep
  me here long I shall die&mdash;perhaps they mean that, sometimes I think
  so&mdash;I know nothing of what is said of me without these walls&mdash;I am
  utterly desolate. This is why I write to you, though you have once betrayed
  me and I should hate you&mdash;though you propose infamy and I should scorn
  to answer it&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Oh, <i>m'amie!</i>" exclaimed Enguerrand impatiently, "Your woman's
  parade of words."</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"You put before me," the letter went on, "what the future
  holds and all you say I have already thought, and though not putting it so
  plainly I have considered it. You mention Kristopher Fassiferne&mdash;well!
  maybe that name does not weigh so dear with me as once it did&mdash;maybe I
  care not so much what he thinks of me, but yet I would not have him know me
  what I am&mdash;and I am of too noble blood to be shamed publicly before all
  France.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You said you were my friend&mdash;see to it then I am
  spared this&mdash;<u>Gilles must not live to speak openly in
  Rennes</u>."</p><br>

  <p>At this underlined sentence, Enguerrand stopped in bewildered delight and
  flushed warmly to see the words clear writ before him&mdash;he had credited
  her with more wit or less spirit than to send such words to him, he had not
  hoped for such good fortune, he could hardly read the rest for his eager
  satisfaction.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I put it thus plainly that you may know my will and
  because all disguise is folly between us two now&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"I cannot feel any remorse or pain for Gilles&mdash;to you
  I cannot feign it&mdash;I would he had died when I meant he
  should&mdash;better for him than to come back to life a helpless
  cripple!&mdash;better for me&mdash;I had not then stained my soul for
  nought!</p>

  <p class="letter">"All is black and dismal to me. I am so utterly
  alone&mdash;oh, my friend, save me from worse than this!&mdash;do what I
  failed in&mdash;Gilles must not live to shame me&mdash;come to me afterwards
  and ask what thanks you will.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">"Françoise."</span></p><br>

  <p>"Now you are caught!" cried Enguerrand triumphantly. "As surely as you
  wrote this I have you now!"</p>

  <p>And he read her letter over again, hardly able to tear his gaze from the
  words that put her in his power. It was not quite what he had expected, he
  had not thought she would so openly word her wish. He was a little surprised
  at his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Does she think I'm a fool&mdash;that I will be her tool like Guy de
  Montauban?" he wondered, for reading between the lines he guessed she thought
  she might use him and discard him afterwards&mdash;that he would burn this
  letter at her bidding as he had the others.</p>

  <p>Enguerrand smiled to himself as he put the letter carefully inside his
  doublet and if the prisoner in Guildo could have seen his face then she would
  have known she had not quite the devoted ally in La Rose Rouge she believed,
  that her influence was not so strong or his infatuation so deep as she
  thought.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-28"
     id="ch-28"></a>XXVIII.&mdash;IN HARDOUINAYE</h2>

  <p class="first">While these things passed there was one who knew nought of
  any&mdash;Gilles of Brittany who lay in Hardouinaye and waited for his
  death.</p>

  <p>He had no wish to live; his life had faded under his touch like a fingered
  rose leaf, all his gold had become brass, all his loves bitter hates; in the
  dawn of his youth and strength he had been struck down to worse than the
  helplessness of old age, the world had no recompense to offer Gilles save the
  quiet of his grave and for that he longed with a weariness too great for
  pain.</p>

  <p>He had seen no one during his imprisonment save Montauban's servants and
  Denise and Eneth, who coming to and fro would look at him curiously,
  sometimes eagerly, never pityingly&mdash;yet he was not more lonely than he
  had been in Guildo in the midst of his splendour, not more neglected; he had
  grown used to the dull apathy of the long spring days when no one came near
  him, grown indeed to like better than the restless presence of Montauban's
  spies. His prison looked on to the steep rocks on which Hardouinaye was built
  and the one small window admitted the sunshine, though the patch of gold it
  made on the floor was lined across with the shadow of the heavy bars.</p>

  <p>Yet Gilles, lying on his low bed, could sometimes see the herons that
  rested in the stonework fly past, and sometimes, as now, the summer wind
  would bring in the strong perfume of the wild thyme that grew without.</p>

  <p>To-day it roused Gilles, he turned on his pillow and figured up by the
  square of sunlight what time of the day it might be.</p>

  <p>"It must," he thought, "be afternoon," about the time some one usually
  came to him and he turned his eyes expectantly toward the door.</p>

  <p>He was thirsty and the water they had left him was out of his reach,
  otherwise he would not have wished for the coming of any&mdash;he preferred
  to lie passive and silent&mdash;undisturbed. For a little while he was
  motionless, then the bitter-sweet odour of the thyme made him again restless
  and he tossed his head wearily on the pillow. He was thinking of nothing, his
  half-closed eyes looked out on a blank; there were neither memories nor
  foreseeings in his heart&mdash;he had grown as dull as an old man sleeping in
  the sun.</p>

  <p>Presently his door opened and Montauban's page, Denise, crept in and stood
  looking at him with a strange hesitation and revulsion.</p>

  <p>"Give me to drink," said Gilles, opening his eyes a little wider.</p>

  <p>They were wonderful gold-brown eyes, utterly expressionless now, which
  made them fearful to look on by one who knew his story&mdash;by one who
  planned his death, and Denise's drawn face went whiter as she handed him the
  cup.</p>

  <p>For she meant he should die, she had sworn it to Enguerrand and she had
  gathered her courage up to a pitch of desperate resolve that could not
  flinch. Now La Rose Rouge had intended she should with her own hands kill
  Gilles of Brittany, but this she could not bring herself to do; instead she
  had instilled into Montauban's timid heart that the Prince must not live, day
  and night she had goaded him, and now when he saw beneath Hardouinaye the
  advancing spears of the Bretons who came to aid Kristopher and knew that
  Gilles must be rescued soon, he consented.</p>

  <p>Gilles must die.</p>

  <p>She had accomplished it&mdash;he would not live to greet his friend when
  Hardouinaye fell&mdash;she had obeyed Enguerrand and thrust on to Montauban's
  fierce, weak soul half the guilt.</p>

  <p>Yet she stood now in Gilles' little prison sick with a great fear and
  horror, and could not tear her eyes from his face.</p>

  <p>He set the cup down, glanced up at her and suddenly smiled.</p>

  <p>"When are they going to end this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"End it?" gasped Denise, stepping backwards.</p>

  <p>"I wonder they have let me live so long," he answered and turned his face
  away from her.</p>

  <p>"He guesses," thought Denise, "he knows," and her blood ran cold to her
  finger-tips, but she set her teeth firmly and dragged herself out of his
  prison without a glance backwards.</p>

  <p>And Gilles did not move again, his blank eyes stared into the rough stone
  wall for a while, then he fell into a dull slumber, and the sun creeping
  farther round cast the shadowed bars over his face. And while he slept, his
  solitude was again disturbed&mdash;this time unheeded.</p>

  <p>It was another of Guy's spies, Eneth, who entered and following him was a
  woman whose delicate face and dead ash-coloured hair was half concealed in a
  dark hood.</p>

  <p>It was Yvonne-Marie.</p>

  <p>In the guise of a dancing girl she had found her way to Hardouinaye and
  through her brother Eneth admittance into the chateau and the Prince's cell.
  Eneth was moved to pity of Gilles of Brittany. Despite the last trick she had
  played him, he was fond of his sister, and, though ignorant of Guy's intent
  and Denise's plot, he looked upon the Prince as little better than a dead man
  and was not unwilling he should die in what peace Yvonne-Marie could give
  him.</p>

  <p>"It is strange you should leave your husband and travel in such a guise,"
  he said to her when she first came to ask this favour of him. "To comfort a
  man you know nothing of."</p>

  <p>He spoke part in wonder, part in admiration, for her deep sincerity and
  earnestness had moved him.</p>

  <p>"I come to help right a deeply wronged man," she had said. "My wronged
  lord's friend&mdash;one half hour with the Prince, Eneth, and I will forgive
  you my wrecked life." And he had hidden her till he found this chance to slip
  into the Prince's cell unnoticed.</p>

  <p>"Montauban'll never let him live," he said, with a glance at the sleeping
  man.</p>

  <p>"Why?" whispered Yvonne-Marie, fearfully.</p>

  <p>"For Françoise of Brittany's sake," he answered. "He wishes her&mdash;and
  her dowry."</p>

  <p>"After all this!&mdash;but my lord will rescue him&mdash;I heard them say
  Hardouinaye cannot stand another day."</p>

  <p>Eneth shrugged his shoulders; indifference was his ruling quality.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave you now," he said. "You'll find me in the hall beneath this
  when you've done&mdash;no one will visit the prisoner to-day, I think."</p>

  <p>He was almost gone, when she went after him and took his hand.</p>

  <p>"God bless you, Eneth," she whispered. "And&mdash;thank you."</p>

  <p>He laughed uneasily to hide his real feeling.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," he answered. "If this makes you
  happy&mdash;<i>ma foi</i>! why not?"</p>

  <p>Their whispered voices disturbed the prisoner. He turned on his bed and as
  the door closed on Eneth, he sighed in his sleep heavily&mdash;and turned;
  softly Yvonne-Marie came into the middle of the room and looked about her. It
  was a dismal place, ill-furnished and dark, the only colour Gilles' blue
  coverlet and a large painted crucifix that hung above his bed. Now Eneth had
  gone it was perfectly still and she grew frightened of the motionless figure
  before her.</p>

  <p>He was a stranger to her, she had only seen him once and never spoken to
  him; till now all her energies had been employed in gaining admittance to
  him, now that end was accomplished, she felt she knew not what to say or do,
  as she crept nearer the bed and gazed down into his face. But as she looked
  such a burning pity and rage rose within her that all her fear passed like a
  breath.</p>

  <p>She recalled him on his wedding day, flushed with pleasure, erect and
  handsome, she remembered his laughter, his gaiety, she saw him now white,
  crippled, wasted, and all her heart went out to him; with a little cry she
  went on her knees beside the bed and gathered his hand up in hers.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur! Monsieur, the Prince!"</p>

  <p>Gilles turned and opened his eyes on a fair face flushed with tears and
  heard a sweet voice broken with sympathy calling on him. It bewildered
  him.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "Who have they sent now?"</p>

  <p>"I come not from Montauban," she answered quickly, divining his meaning.
  "I come from outside&mdash;from your friends&mdash;" She had no lack of
  words, she quivered with her pain for him and her eagerness, but the apathy
  did not leave Gilles' face, his brown eyes had a little wonder in them, but
  neither expectation, hope nor fear.</p>

  <p>"I have no friends," he said simply. "Will you leave me alone?"</p>

  <p>A terror crossed Yvonne-Marie's feverish passion that she would not be
  able to rouse him; his dullness almost killed her energy, as if it had
  touched ice, her heart went cold.</p>

  <p>"You have a noble friend," she shuddered. "Oh, Prince&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not that now," he interrupted in the same level tone. "Only a cripple
  who'll be dead soon."</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried. "You'll live! Oh, <i>Mon Dieu</i>! do you not
  feel&mdash;hope&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Gilles was silent awhile, he tossed his head as if her presence fretted
  him.</p>

  <p>"No," he said at last, and his thin fingers clutched the coverlet
  impatiently. Yvonne-Marie drew herself up with a gasp of eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Look at me," she said, "turn to me, Prince Gilles&mdash;I've risked
  everything to come to you."</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at her curiously, her gray eyes were wide and dark in
  their intensity, her nostrils distended, her pale lips parted, her black gown
  strained over her heaving breast, her two hands that lay on his bed clasped
  so tightly together that the fingers made red marks in the flesh.</p>

  <p>"Who sent you?" asked Gilles with some interest.</p>

  <p>"No one," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>His voice was still cold, unmoved.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie lifted her head with a look of despair.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Do you not know me? I am Kristopher Fassiferne's most unworthy
  wife!"</p>

  <p>As if she had thrust fire under his face, Gilles of Brittany drew back and
  a long shudder ran through his poor, maimed body.</p>

  <p>"How dare you name <i>him</i> to me?" he whispered, and his eyes lit into
  fury.</p>

  <p>"The truest friend you ever had!" cried Yvonne-Marie passionately. "The
  most loyal and the tenderest&mdash;I've come to tell you so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lies, lies!" interrupted Gilles impatiently "Get you gone&mdash;I'm a
  poor fool&mdash;but not fool enou' to be made his butt again!"</p>

  <p>"God be my witness he did not write that letter!" she answered in an
  agony. "God hear me as I swear he was ever true to you&mdash;and she,
  Françoise&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>With a sharp cry of bitter pain and fury the sick man half struggled up.
  "Why did you come to awake all the sleeping devils?" he demanded hoarsely. "I
  have been praying to die before any spoke that name to me!" And with a sound
  that was half sob, half cry he dropped back again and lay gasping for his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Then let her go!" cried Yvonne-Marie. "I come to justify Kristopher
  Fassiferne, why should I lie to you? I love him and he loves not me."</p>

  <p>Gilles put out his hand with a sudden gesture that checked her.</p>

  <p>"Poor soul," he whispered wistfully. "He does not love
  you&mdash;no&mdash;he loves&mdash;my wife&mdash;for she is my wife."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he loves her," she answered, facing it boldly with a desperate
  courage. "And she loves him&mdash;could they help it? And she betrayed Guildo
  for him&mdash;but he did not write that letter&mdash;it was a plot, a
  forgery."</p>

  <p>"You speak false," said Gilles kindling into a white rage again.. "He
  wrote it&mdash;he betrayed me in my absence."</p>

  <p>"He was your true friend, pure in his loyalty to you! Will you not believe
  me?"</p>

  <p>"If he was so true to me," demanded Gilles fiercely, "how came they to
  know of this great love of theirs? If this love was so pure how came she to
  try and <i>murder</i> me?" His voice was terrible and Yvonne-Marie quailed
  from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I loved him so you cannot dream," went on Gilles, staring down at her.
  "Yea, more than the woman I loved him&mdash;I was a boy, you see, and I think
  women cannot know how a boy may love and worship a man&mdash;as I did
  him!"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie, burning with the desire to clear Kristopher, the one object
  that had driven her to this, the one thought that filled her mind, the set
  purpose that was animating her to courage and strength, yet felt herself awed
  into silence before the horror of Gilles' tragedy. A sense of the
  hopelessness of any comfort, of a conviction of the weakness of anything she
  could say assailed her, she could find no words to interrupt him.</p>

  <p>"I flung everything aside on his bare word," continued Gilles. "I risked
  all I had to come back to Brittany&mdash;to save her&mdash;and she tried to
  murder me."</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie straightened with horror.</p>

  <p>"You mistake," she said. "She could not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She did!" he returned passionately. "She made me what I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jesu, he did not know&mdash;he thought it chance."</p>

  <p>"I will not hear speak of him," interrupted Gilles in a torment of
  passion. "Why have you come to speak of him? He has wronged you."</p>

  <p>"No!" she answered, her head flung back. "I have wronged him&mdash;he is
  not a leader of mercenaries&mdash;but an Earl&mdash;lord of Coventry and
  Valance, and I&mdash;I&mdash;have dragged him down!"</p>

  <p>Gilles paused in his fury at her intensity, as Kristopher had done, and
  she seeing her chance pleaded with him again as if it was life lay in the
  balance.</p>

  <p>She told him everything in direct words that struck through the torpor of
  his misery, her own story, the story of the plot that had trapped Françoise,
  Enguerrand's share in it and Guy de Montauban's, Kristopher's agony and how
  he rested day nor night striving to free Gilles.</p>

  <p>"He thinks of nothing but that&mdash;nothing," she ended with. "He would
  give his life for yours&mdash;his soul&mdash;he hath gone through temptation
  as the innocent through fire, unscathed! As he was noble to me he hath been
  to you&mdash;on High Heaven I swear&mdash;if your heart is not all withered,
  believe me&mdash;I can say nothing more!"</p>

  <p>The strain and passion of her words was exhausted, she lowered her head in
  the coverlet of his bed and burst into wild tears; but Gilles was silent a
  long while; once or twice he made a movement of pain and at last he put out
  his hand and touched her bent hair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't touch me!" she cried through her bitter tears. "If you can't
  believe&mdash;if you don't know when you hear God's truth&mdash;oh, don't you
  see I'm not lying?"</p>

  <p>He drew his hand back at the sharp appeal and she lifted a face distorted
  with grief and stared at him.</p>

  <p>Still he did not speak, and after a second she sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"God forgive you, Gilles of Brittany!" she cried in her agony. "I never
  can&mdash;for you have slain my lord!"</p>

  <p>"He'll not die," whispered Gilles through white lips, "he'll live to laugh
  at me&mdash;and you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie began walking up and down the narrow cell in a tempest of
  grief and Gilles' bright eyes watched her with no sign of relenting.</p>

  <p>"You love him?" he muttered, "yea, he has the trick of it&mdash;she loved
  him and so did I&mdash;he has the tongue of the deceiver." And he put his
  hands to his faded hair and tore at it in a weak rage, muttering under his
  breath, and Yvonne-Marie seeing stopped suddenly before him with tight-locked
  hands and a drawn face.</p>

  <p>"You'll not believe me?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," he answered wearily.</p>

  <p>"Not if I swear on the Cross&mdash;on my soul?"</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> perjured her soul for him&mdash;why not you?"</p>

  <p>"I am not a murderess!" cried Yvonne-Marie. "I love him&mdash;but not like
  that&mdash;I sinned, but not like that&mdash;let her go&mdash;but tell me you
  believe him!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," he repeated.</p>

  <p>Yvonne-Marie turned away sharply and fell on her knees before the crucifix
  at the head of the bed in an ecstasy of appeal.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Christ!" she cried, wringing her hands in the fervency of her
  distress, "open this man's eyes! Oh Thou who hast dealt too tenderly with
  me&mdash;punish me&mdash;take my life&mdash;take my soul&mdash;damn me for my
  sins as I deserve, but let this man believe! Oh, Jesu! Jesu have pity on
  me!"</p>

  <p>A silence fell broken only by her sobbing breaths as she clung to the feet
  of the crucifix, then Gilles held his hand out and spoke&mdash;brokenly.</p>

  <p>"Come to me again&mdash;come and look at me&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;come to
  me."</p>

  <p>She rose and came to the bed shaking with the force of her tears, there
  was a moment's silence, then:</p>

  <p>"I believe you," said Gilles of Brittany.</p>

  <p>She was too spent to cry out, her voice had sunk to faltering whispering,
  her eyes were dim, she put her hand in his with a little sob and slipped on
  to her knees again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God be thanked!" she whispered, "God be thanked."</p>

  <p>And she smoothed his tumbled pillow and laid the coverlet straight and put
  her cool hand on his hot forehead.</p>

  <p>"He will save you," she breathed. "You shall hear this from his own
  lips."</p>

  <p>"It matters not," he answered, "I believe you."</p>

  <p>And he smiled, his eyes had grown soft, his whole face transfigured,
  despite his disfigurement he looked a boy, and he kept his gaze on her as if
  she soothed him like music or sunshine.</p>

  <p>And she was silent in her gladness, the hand she held she caressed
  tenderly and she could not speak.</p>

  <p>"You have healed my heart," he faltered at length. "I think&mdash;nothing
  matters&mdash;if he is true to&mdash;me."</p>

  <p>The tears rushed to her eyes again and welled over; he had the pathos of
  an animal or a child&mdash;gentleness and tenderness is very terrible when it
  is wronged and helpless as he was now, and sick and dizzy as she was with her
  passion and her delight, she lifted her aching head to strive and comfort
  him.</p>

  <p>A sound, slight yet very distinct in the stillness, made them both
  silent.</p>

  <p>It was cautious footsteps without and presently whispered men's voices.
  Obeying a sudden impulse, Yvonne-Marie rose and bolted the door, then as she
  turned again, she saw the sick man had flushed with hot colour and that his
  eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>"<i>They have come to murder me</i>," he said, under his breath.</p>

  <p>By what intuition he had guessed it she could not tell, but she felt that
  the dread had come to her with that first sound without, and all her courage
  rose to meet the need.</p>

  <p>"It must not be," she muttered, and put her ear to the door holding her
  very breath.</p>

  <p>What she heard those without say left her in no doubt. They had come to
  murder the Prince. She felt no fear, rather an exaltation of courage and
  wrath. She went back to the Prince and put her arms about him and lifted him
  up tin his head touched her breast.</p>

  <p>"You will not die alone," she said.</p>

  <p>"Nor yet unhappy," he answered, "since I know the truth&mdash;an' I am not
  afraid to die, they say the very young never are&mdash;I'm only twenty."</p>

  <p>The moment had not found either unprepared&mdash;he had been expecting it
  for days and the desperate terror that had driven her to see him was thought
  of this. She clasped him tight, her wide eyes on the door, she knew that bolt
  could not hold them long, she knew they might slay her too, but she did not
  care&mdash;Gilles believed.</p>

  <p>"Curse on the cowards!" cried the Prince with a sudden flush of wrath, "I
  knew Montauban would not let him rescue me!"</p>

  <p>"He cannot prevent it that you know," she answered triumphantly. "He
  cannot take your faith in Kristopher away!"</p>

  <p>She did not falter or shudder, her tears were all dried, her face calm.
  Gilles looked at her in deep gratitude and admiration, her presence uplifted
  him, her arms about him was the sweetest thing he had ever known, he had been
  desolate, deceived so long, her companionship and truth inspired him like
  wine.</p>

  <p>He heard the key turn in the lock, but it gave him no shudder.</p>

  <p>"Have you no message for him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Say I loved and believed," he answered simply, "and blessed you&mdash;his
  wife&mdash;that he should turn from you to her!"</p>

  <p>Those without had found the inner bolt slipped and struck on the door
  heavily.</p>

  <p>"Farewell," said Gilles of Brittany through set teeth. "They won't hurt
  you&mdash;when they come you'll leave me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never!" she cried proudly. "I came to make amends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sun had left the cell entirely dark, the walls looked down on the
  man's gaunt figure held up on the woman's breast, on her proud face turned to
  the door and the light that leaped up into his eyes. They were struggling
  with the bolt violently, it could not hold much longer.</p>

  <p>"If I could stand!" breathed Gilles. "I could have faced them
  all&mdash;once!"</p>

  <p>With a last blow the heavy door swung back.</p>

  <p>"Courage!" whispered Yvonne-Marie. "You shall be terribly revenged."</p>

  <p>With her help he struggled up to face his enemies, and at the sight of him
  and the woman holding him up the three who entered fell back startled. They
  were brutal-looking men, common soldiers; Montauban had found difficulty in
  getting any for this service and these, degraded as they were, seemed to
  hesitate as if frightened.</p>

  <p>"Well?" demanded Gilles. "You've come for me?&mdash;take this woman
  away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," said Yvonne-Marie. "I'll not go." And she turned her pale, proud
  face to the three halting by the door.</p>

  <p>"Who sent you?" she said. "Where is he who admitted me&mdash;Eneth?"</p>

  <p>For she had a hope her brother might prove a friend, a desperate hope that
  he could not have known of this, that he might come to her aid.</p>

  <p>The name seemed to explain her presence to the new-comers: one of them
  advanced more boldly.</p>

  <p>"He's safe from interfering," he said. "Come now&mdash;make away with
  you." He stamped his foot as he spoke and made an attempt to catch hold of
  her, but she shrank away and clung tighter to Gilles, and a flush leaped into
  the face of the doomed man.</p>

  <p>"You dastards!" he said through his teeth. "Can't you see I can't strike a
  blow&mdash;are you come to murder me?"</p>

  <p>"Where's Montauban?" asked Yvonne-Marie. "He cannot have sanctioned
  this&mdash;let me see him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Par Dieu!</i> he sent us&mdash;" was the rough answer. "Come
  away&mdash;he who let you in will answer for this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He caught hold of her arm savagely, but she shook him off desperately.</p>

  <p>"Where is he? Eneth! Eneth!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Leave me," whispered Gilles. "I ask it."</p>

  <p>"Never," she replied. "I stand for Kristopher&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The men fell back again to the far end of the cell and whispered together,
  cursing Eneth for admitting this woman, nonplussed by her appearance and
  firmness.</p>

  <p>And Yvonne-Marie held Gilles on her breast and watched them with dark,
  unflinching eyes.</p>

  <p>"The end hath come," breathed the Prince in the hush. "I pray
  you&mdash;go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she only smiled; she was as steadfast in her resolve, as high in her
  courage as if she had greatly loved him; and when the three came again toward
  the bed she put herself between Gilles and them with a high lift of her head
  and a calm strength that a second time made them pause.</p>

  <p>"God's curse is on you if you touch this man," she said. "Get you
  back&mdash;would you be a murderer's tools?"</p>

  <p>For a second they stood still, then the foremost broke into a snarl.</p>

  <p>"We're not to be threatened by a woman. <i>Par Dieu!</i>" he cried, "our
  business is with you, Monsieur le Prince!" And he made a lunge forward at
  Gilles, but Yvonne-Marie sprang forward and stood in front of him.</p>

  <p>"We are helpless&mdash;" she cried. "Utterly helpless! As you are men you
  could not harm us!" But her cry only increased his fury.</p>

  <p>"<i>Maledicte!</i>" he shouted. "Get you out of the way!"</p>

  <p>"Alas! there is no help," breathed 'Yvonne-Marie, and she fell swiftly to
  her knees and put her arms about Gilles as a shield.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid," he said striving to put her aside. "God bless
  you&mdash;leave me&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>They were dragging them apart and a frightful cry escaped Gilles to see
  her roughly handled, drops of sweat stood out on his forehead, his face was
  contracted with agony; but not for his own death so near, but for his lost
  strength, for the weakness that made him lie there helpless.</p>

  <p>For one moment of his lost manhood&mdash;to be able to die standing,
  facing them, protecting her who had brought such hope to him.</p>

  <p>"I overcame four as strong as you the time I won the tourney prize in
  Ghent!" he cried. "Oh, <i>Dieu</i>, that I might not die thus!" And the big
  tears ran down his white face.</p>

  <p>"Courage!" cried Yvonne-Marie. "I am here&mdash;I will help you&mdash;even
  as he would have done!"</p>

  <p>And she wrenched herself free and rushed to Gilles and with a sudden
  strength lifted him up as if he had been a child, raised him till his head
  reached her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Now come and kill him!" she cried.</p>

  <p>A third time they hung back. They were terrible to look at, the slim woman
  who was all white and gray, clothed in black with wide strained eyes and the
  panting man whose bright gold hair lay over her shoulder, whose worn body she
  clasped tight so that he might face his foes.</p>

  <p>At last one leaped forward, but with a sudden desperate force Gilles flung
  out his arms and tossed him off&mdash;so that he fell heavily on the
  stones.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Gilles staring down at him joyously. "I am not all useless
  yet!"</p>

  <p>But the sight of their fallen comrade inspired the two others with new
  courage; with one impulse they flung themselves on Gilles, and he supported
  on the woman's shoulder met them with the bravery of a lion. And she held
  herself rigid, motionless, she did not wince or shudder, or once relax her
  hold.</p>

  <p>The unequal struggle was brief, the foremost lifted Gilles by sheer force
  from Yvonne-Marie, twisted him savagely and dropped him back, limp and
  helpless on the bed, where he lay crushed and dying.</p>

  <p>"Finish it! Finish it!" yelled the other hoarsely, but Gilles' murderer
  fled from what he had done as if from a plague: Yvonne-Marie's voice, sharp
  with agony, drove him back like a lead-tipped whip:</p>

  <p>"Your work is done!" she wailed. She was on her knees by the bedside, she
  lifted Gilles' head and pillowed it on her arm, she stooped and kissed his
  damp, drawn forehead and panic seized on the three, he whom Gilles had thrown
  sprang to his feet, and they turned as one man and fled.</p>

  <p>"Gilles! Gilles!" whispered Yvonne-Marie. "You'll wake in Heaven for this
  sleep of thine!"</p>

  <p>He moved his hand feebly and tried to take hers, a faint smile crossed his
  distorted face.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he whispered so low she could hardly hear.
  "You'll&mdash;mind&mdash;to&mdash;tell&mdash;him&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He shall know and he shall avenge you," she answered. "He shall cherish
  you forever, Gilles."</p>

  <p>She lifted the strands of bright hair back, she stroked his hands and held
  him as he shuddered, her courage and sympathy were about him in his death as
  the perfume round a dying rose, all the deep, long-suppressed tenderness of
  her life found a vent. He was saying something, she could hardly hear what,
  his dimming eyes sought hers wistfully and she smiled down on him.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me again," he muttered, and she heard now and put her lips to his
  cheek, and as they touched his flesh she felt his heart leap under her arm,
  then he gave a sigh and quivered into silence and stillness.</p>

  <p>She had never looked on death before, she had always shuddered to hear of
  it; yet she made no mistake and felt no fear now.</p>

  <p>She knew he was dead.</p>

  <p>For a long while she knelt as motionless as he, suffering his head to lie
  on her arm; it was only footsteps entering hastily but rousing her to turn
  and&mdash;lifting his head tenderly&mdash;to rise.</p>

  <p>It was two of the murderers who entered and her brother Eneth, white and
  fierce.</p>

  <p>"I never knew of this!" he cried. "Come away&mdash;Yvonne-Marie."</p>

  <p>But she looked at the two men behind him&mdash;"Oh, you cowards!" she
  cried in a wild fury at so base a thing. "To kill him&mdash;oh, you vile
  dastards!"</p>

  <p>Then a complete reaction overcame her, the tension suddenly snapped; she
  threw out her hands to Eneth and fell forward at his feet unconscious.</p>

  <p>With a muttered oath he picked her up, and began railing at the villainy
  of the other two&mdash;he had known nothing of this&mdash;they had taken good
  care he should not be in the way.</p>

  <p>Without waiting for an answer to his anger lie snatched up Yvonne-Marie
  and carried her away.</p>

  <p>Without Gilles' prison was confusion and hurrying to and fro; among others
  Eneth passed Denise who did not notice who he dragged along with him.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" she asked, and he answered fiercely, thrusting her
  aside:</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>Then Denise turned and fled up file stone steps through the room where
  Montauban sat with his officers.</p>

  <p>"The Prince hath died in his sickness," she cried, and Montauban looked at
  her and understood.</p>

  <p>"Then is there no need for me," he said slowly, and a flush spread over
  his wan face. "I go tonight to Guildo&mdash;and at the first summons let the
  English be admitted."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-29"
     id="ch-29"></a>XXIX.&mdash;GILLES OF BRITTANY</h2>

  <p class="first">Without waiting for the French that hurried up to join him
  Kristopher marched up for an attack on Hardouinaye; he wanted no help from
  Count Enguerrand, in his fiery impatience he vowed to save his friend alone,
  to capture the château that held Gilles of Brittany even if every stone was
  bolted with iron and every defender trebled in strength and number.</p>

  <p>The days since he had left Dol had been terrible to him, the most terrible
  in his life; the sense of his friend, his bitterly wronged friend lying
  helpless behind these walls, believing him false was a keen torture, a bitter
  sting in his sore heart that those who followed him could not understand.</p>

  <p>It was early on a fair morning when they rode up to the walls of
  Hardouinaye, so early the silver mists had not risen from the grass nor the
  birds grown tired of their first song.</p>

  <p>There was no resistance from Hardouinaye, the walls were unarmed, and as
  the English neared a man bearing a white flag appeared on the drawbridge.</p>

  <p>They were ready to open the gates he said, to lay down their arms, the
  Sieur de Montauban had abandoned the château and they could make no
  defence.</p>

  <p>Kristopher listened, motionless, then he turned slowly to Gregan who rode
  at his right.</p>

  <p>"What may this be meaning?" he asked. "Think you&mdash;they have&mdash;"
  He broke off and sprang to the ground, roused by the rattle of the opening
  portcullis, and they followed him into the château, held hushed by something
  indefinable in his utterly quiet manner.</p>

  <p>When they clattered into the great empty hall, he turned with a visible
  effort and whispered something to Gregan, who stepped forward, while he
  leaned against the wall near the door, his breath coming unevenly, like some
  one panting for strength.</p>

  <p>An officer stepped from the sullen ranks of Montauban's men and handed the
  keys to Gregan who took them sternly.</p>

  <p>"Where is Prince Gilles?" he demanded. "In his prison, Sieur."</p>

  <p>"And Montauban abandoned him&mdash;leaving the place defenceless?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sieur," answered the Frenchman calmly.</p>

  <p>"He left by the secret way&mdash;last night."</p>

  <p>"If this is some trap," answered Gregan Griffiths, "you'll all hang for
  it&mdash;I command in Hardouinaye now, your men will march out when they've
  taken their standard down&mdash;and you'll take us to the Prince at
  once."</p>

  <p>Kristopher came a little from the wall slowly, and his blue eyes seemed to
  discompose the officer, he glanced away before he answered.</p>

  <p>"You have the keys of all the château, Sieur," he said.</p>

  <p>"And the power to hang you," cried Gregan Griffiths. "Now the way to the
  Prince's prison&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was stepping forward impulsively, the soldiers pressing close behind,
  when the Frenchman put out his hand with a gesture that stayed them.</p>

  <p>"Gilles of Brittany died yesterday," he said. And half timidly he drew his
  cap off and waited for the utter silence to break.</p>

  <p>It was Kristopher who spoke first. "Take me to him."</p>

  <p>Gregan, frightened at his voice, turned with some desperate attempt at
  comfort, but Kristopher stopped him.</p>

  <p>"I guessed," he said. "The shadow of it&mdash;has been over me&mdash;don't
  speak to me&mdash;yet&mdash;take me to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A low murmur rose from the English soldiers, the look on Kristopher's face
  touched all of them&mdash;he was greatly beloved&mdash;yet none, not even
  Gregan dared speak to him.</p>

  <p>With an awkward gentleness Gregan drew him away as the Frenchman left the
  hall. Angry and silent the English followed their two leaders through the
  long dark passages that led to the prisons, with stern faces and eyes on the
  outlook for treachery.</p>

  <p>Kristopher moved with a strange apathy that stirred his own wonder; he had
  felt so much, so terribly of late, it seemed curious that now when the worst
  had fallen, he should feel dull and passive.</p>

  <p>He marvelled at it and wondered if his heart was dead or broken as he
  waited in a black lassitude while they unlocked the bars of Gilles'
  prison.</p>

  <p>He caught himself thinking of other things, moments in his life that had
  been dead for years&mdash;the day his father died came back to him, the quiet
  horror of the sick chamber, the exhaustion of his bitter grief mingled
  strangely into one, with the look of the bed curtains and the faint perfume
  of incense burned round the dead.</p>

  <p>It seemed a long time before some touch roused him and he entered the
  narrow door.</p>

  <p>Four candles burned either side the bed and for the first time Kristopher
  noticed how strange candle light looks in broad day&mdash;how dim and
  ghastly.</p>

  <p>The blue coverlet on the bed heaved over the stiff line of a figure and
  the rise of two still feet across which the shadow of the prison bars lay
  strong&mdash;the curtains were drawn back but the face was covered with a
  white cloth, outside which the little rings of hair showed golden.</p>

  <p>Kristopher went up to the bed, still dully wondering at his own calm,
  marvelling that he did not swoon or die, and dropped on 'his knees and stared
  at the face cloth.</p>

  <p>Gilles' thin hands were laid together and on them was a wreath of drooping
  flowers. Kristopher found himself kissing their faded leaves and blessing
  whoever had put them there.</p>

  <p>Then his head sank forward on the coverlet and he became as motionless as
  Gilles&mdash;his strength of body and soul gone from him in that apathy that
  is called despair.</p>

  <p>What came and went in the chamber he could not tell, what hurryings and
  whisperings there were, what new footsteps entered or the old ones
  left&mdash;he knew nothing till he felt a hand laid on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Through the thick leather he wore, he felt that hand printed cold on his
  flesh and he shuddered with a little moan and looked up. It was his wife.</p>

  <p>She stood beside him as pale as the dead he knelt by and as their eyes met
  she gave a start hardly knowing him, for he too was terribly changed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't grieve so," she murmured. "Don't grieve so&mdash;I was with him
  when he died&mdash;he knew the truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kristopher stared at her and his rigid face relaxed and moved.</p>

  <p>"He believed!" said Yvonne-Marie brokenly. "He blessed
  you&mdash;and&mdash;and loved you to the last!"</p>

  <p>Like a dreamer struggling back to reality he rose to his feet and the warm
  blood stirred about his frozen heart.</p>

  <p>"It's not cursing me he died?" he faltered. "It's believing and trusting
  me he was&mdash;Oh, Jesu&mdash;if it might be!"</p>

  <p>His face grew alive with yearning and hope, the hard stare left his blue
  eyes, he shook himself like a man awaking from a nightmare.</p>

  <p>"It's true!" she cried, "I told him all and he believed me&mdash;I
  comforted him&mdash;I held him up when he died, I made what amends I
  could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He needed to hear no more, only now did he realise how tense had been his
  agony, her words refreshed his torn soul like wine the body, new life and
  strength ran through his veins.</p>

  <p>Gilles had understood&mdash;believed&mdash;the sting and the horror had
  gone from his sorrow, the black despair was lifted.</p>

  <p>He turned to the dead man and gathered him up in his strong arms as
  tenderly as a mother a tired child and kissed him with his blue eyes wet with
  tears and murmured endearments in his passionate sorrow and relief.</p>

  <p>And Yvonne-Marie leaned faintly against the prison wall and watched
  him.</p>

  <p>A second time he had forgotten her.</p>

  <p>Gently Kristopher laid Gilles back, lingering over him, his lovable face
  grown soft and tender, then with a half sigh he straightened himself out and
  tore his eyes from the bed.</p>

  <p>Gregan and a company of others entered the cell and he turned to them with
  shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"You'll not help the dead this way, Kit," said Gregan. "Come up into the
  light&mdash;there&mdash;there's work to be done&mdash;Montauban&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure do you think he'll escape me?" answered Kristopher under his breath.
  "I'm coming, Gregan&mdash;e&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Count Enguerrand hath just arrived," said Gregan, surprised at the change
  in Kristopher's demeanour. "He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" interrupted Kristopher flushing, "I'm coming, Gregan."</p>

  <p>Then as they fell back to the door again he turned to the silent woman in
  the shadow and his face was tender and proud.</p>

  <p>"My wife!" he said very low and reverently as he held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I shall come back."</p>

  <p>He took her hand and drew her close and looked into her tear-stained
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"My wife!" he said again, then turned abruptly and followed the others
  into the great hall.</p>

  <p>With the lifting of his utter blind despair had come a sudden strength and
  calm; the blackness that had made everything distant and unreal was torn
  aside, he saw what he must do very clearly, without hesitation, faltering, or
  any sign of weakness he put the men round him back and stepped into the hall
  where Count Enguerrand waited.</p>

  <p>The sun was already high and shining through the red quarterings on the
  long window before which La Rose Rouge stood; shining too, in a dazzling
  patch through the open door and on to the armour of the Bretons waiting
  without.</p>

  <p>Kristopher stood a moment with a thoughtful face looking at the sunlight
  and the glitter, and Enguerrand came a step nearer drawing off his white
  gloves.</p>

  <p>"So the Prince is dead?" he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"How is it you know?" answered Kristopher, without moving or taking his
  eyes from the other.</p>

  <p>"Because I met Guy de Montauban riding to Guildo&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Was that your only reason?" asked Kristopher, still so quietly that
  Enguerrand grew puzzled.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "There was this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took a paper from his glove and handed it to Kristopher, who took it
  without a word.</p>

  <p>It was Françoise's letter.</p>

  <p>There was an utter silence while Kristopher read it, only Enguerrand made
  a movement of his hand to his sword and his face grew watchful as one in wait
  for a lion to turn.</p>

  <p>But Kristopher read the letter from beginning to end, then folded it
  slowly and quietly.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep this," he said, feeling for his words carefully. "I know of
  your last know of this too&mdash;if it is false&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you find it hard to believe?" demanded Enguerrand. "That twice she
  tried and once failed?"</p>

  <p>"Never trouble for my belief&mdash;it's the truth I'll be knowing,"
  answered Kristopher, lifting his eyes for the first time. "Who did she send
  this to?"</p>

  <p>"To me," said Enguerrand insolently. "But there was no need of my
  service&mdash;Montauban saw to it she became a widow."</p>

  <p>"You've played for her both of you&mdash;this way now is
  it?&mdash;Well&mdash;if she wrote this she'll be almost ignoble enough to be
  your mate, Count."</p>

  <p>Enguerrand laughed to hide his anger.</p>

  <p>"How will you find whether that be true or no?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall to Guildo," answered Kristopher quietly. "I shall ask her."</p>

  <p>"<i>Grand Dieu!</i> And you think she'll tell you the truth?" cried
  Enguerrand.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it's the truth she'll be tellin'&mdash;to me!"</p>

  <p>And Kristopher moved away with no more notice of La Rose Rouge than if he
  had been a dog.</p>

  <p>"Look to Yvonne-Marie," he said to Gregan. "I'm goin' to Guildo."</p>

  <p>It was what Enguerrand had intended and planned for; he meant Kristopher
  to show his open scorn to Françoise, yet something in Kristopher's quiet
  nettled him into a rage that could not allow the other to depart so
  easily.</p>

  <p>Kristopher knew his treachery and took it with calm and the disdain of one
  discovering meanness in a churl, and Enguerrand, feeling it so, was goaded
  into following him to the door.</p>

  <p>"My news does not seem to move you much, Monsieur," he said with an
  unmistakable challenge in his voice and bearing. Kristopher turned with a
  weary loathing.</p>

  <p>"You! "'he said. "What can such as you be to me? Not even matter for
  scorn."</p>

  <p>And he was passing on again when Enguerrand, fired and flushed, flung
  himself in front across the steps.</p>

  <p>"<i>Par Dieu!</i> you don't leave like this!" he cried, and those who
  watched held their breath to see the two so close.</p>

  <p>Kristopher looked at the other's inflamed features with no change in his
  own.</p>

  <p>"Oh, get you away," he said indifferently. "It's hinderin' me you
  are."</p>

  <p>And he lifted his gloves and struck Enguerrand across the face with them
  twice, as he might have whipped a cur from the way and never looked back as
  he descended.</p>

  <p>The action was so sudden, so unexpected, so dispassionate that it left
  Enguerrand staring as if petrified, all his passion turned into
  amazement.</p>

  <p>But some of his men who had witnessed the scene sprang forward to follow
  Kristopher and then he moved.</p>

  <p>"Let him go!" he cried fiercely. "It suits me he should go."</p>

  <p>He turned into the hall again with his hand over the dull red mark on his
  white face and Gregan grew fearful for Kristopher. "He is mad," he said. "His
  friend's death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Enguerrand with a ghastly smile, "at least for the present
  we will think so."</p>

  <p>He drew out a lace handkerchief and dabbed his smarting face, and the
  English watching with difficulty restrained a desire to cheer Kristopher's
  action; they had none of them heard the low conversation that had passed,
  they knew nothing of what lay behind Kristopher's blow but they bore a strong
  dislike to the painted Frenchman who led his soldiers perfumed like a
  woman.</p>

  <p>Sending one to learn his wish from Kristopher who was gathering his men
  together without, Gregan went in search of Yvonne-Marie. Left alone with his
  own men Enguerrand still stood silent against the wall and made no attempt to
  follow Kristopher. When Gregan Griffiths came back he found him there,
  staring at the floor.</p>

  <p>"Count," said the Englishman, "the war is near over now&mdash;it's each
  man for himself. We English are going to Dol&mdash;and the Prince&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Prince!" broke in Enguerrand with a savage sneer. "Isn't the Prince
  carrion?&mdash;I shan't bury him&mdash;let your madman do that&mdash;and
  you&mdash;get you to Dol or get you to Hell&mdash;what care I? I stay
  here."</p>

  <p>"As you please," answered Gregan fiercely and Enguerrand flung away up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>Another hour and the English had left Hardouinaye fortified by the Bretons
  and marched to Dol from whence they intended to disband and return to
  England.</p>

  <p>With the Prince's death all motive or excuse had gone&mdash;it had become
  a confusion in which it was, as Gregan had said, each man for himself.</p>

  <p>And out of all this broil and tumult Count Enguerrand intended to withdraw
  into his stronghold of Bàrrès&mdash;with the prize they had all been
  contending for&mdash;Françoise of Brittany and her dowry.</p>

  <p>Half her estates he held already by force, he intended to hold them all by
  right as her husband&mdash;a position in which he could defy the Duke and the
  French&mdash;a position that would make him the most powerful and the richest
  man in Brittany or France position from which he could buy peace and alliance
  with whom he willed.</p>

  <p>When it was near noon and hours since the English had left, he commanded
  his men to be ready for the march in two hours' time. He had calculated the
  distance to Guildo and the time, to a nicety, and now the final orders were
  given, he went to the chamber that had been Françoise's and sat there,
  waiting&mdash;looking out of that window Françoise had opened the night
  before she left for Rennes, and gazed on to the rain and the dark.</p>

  <p>It was different now&mdash;there was a flowering almond outside and
  sunshine, a warm gold light that fell over Enguerrand's white velvet and his
  splendid hair. He took his watch off and hung it up opposite him, and gazed
  at the time impatiently, now and then putting his hand to his smooth cheek as
  if he still felt Kristopher's blow tingling there.</p>

  <p>Presently a hurried footstep and one he had utterly forgotten
  entered&mdash;Montauban's page&mdash;his ally&mdash;Denise.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he smiled easily. "Denise!"</p>

  <p>"Denise!" she echoed. She shut the door and leaned against it panting. "Is
  that my reward&mdash;after I've done&mdash;murder&mdash;for you, La Rose
  Rouge&mdash;Denise!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand smiled indulgently, though fretted by the distraction of her
  earnestness. He wished she had remained hidden till he had left.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, you proved a true friend, <i>ma mignonne</i>, as I
  knew&mdash;" he held his hand out. "Come and kiss me, Denise!"</p>

  <p>But she did not move and the colour leaped up in her drawn face.</p>

  <p>"What I've done can't be paid by a kiss&mdash;do you guess what it meant
  to me&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;kill that man&mdash;the torture it
  was&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma chérie</i>," he answered, half contemptuous, half amused, "I asked
  it, and you did it&mdash;well! that's all, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I did it for you, Enguerrand!"</p>

  <p>His velvet eyes scanned her curiously as-she came and caught hold of his
  hand passionately.</p>

  <p>"Could I do more!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Or I?" and he kissed her lightly.</p>

  <p>"You didn't speak like that when you goaded me, to it," whispered Denise
  imploringly. "Your caresses were different&mdash;it seemed worth doing
  then&mdash;I've never forgotten when we first saw one another&mdash;oh, La
  Rose Rouge!"</p>

  <p>"What memories women have for kisses! smiled Enguerrand, smoothing her
  hair elegantly.</p>

  <p>"<i>Your</i> kisses burn to the heart," answered Denise. "They're lying on
  mine&mdash;as deeply printed there as that man's dead
  face&mdash;deeper!&mdash;for when you look at me I can forget even
  that&mdash;Oh, Enguerrand&mdash;say you love me!"</p>

  <p>She was in deep, passionate earnest, her gray eyes swimming in tears, she
  drew nearer Enguerrand with trembling lips&mdash;he, biting his brilliant
  curls, looked at her, smiling, though there was weariness in his face.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>&mdash;I do," he answered, "love you, Denise&mdash;" and his
  eyes roved to the watch opposite.</p>

  <p>"What do you watch the time for?" she asked sharply. "Are you going after
  him&mdash;and her&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Else what were all this for?" said La Rose Rouge. "Your service and
  all&mdash;<i>m'amie</i>&mdash;he'll kill Montauban."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he'll kill her!" cried Denise furiously. "Pray God he'll kill
  her!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand sat upright, suddenly, and glowered down on her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you little devil!" he said. "You think he will!" and at the note in
  his voice the white dog beside him growled. "But he won't," he added. "He'll
  kill Montauban&mdash;not the woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You won't go after her&mdash;you don't want her, Enguerrand!" she cried,
  fallen to pleading again. "I&mdash;I've given my soul for you!"</p>

  <p>"Madame the vagabond," said La Rose Rouge, easy now and smiling, "you
  never had one."</p>

  <p>She was weeping real tears, the first for very long.</p>

  <p><i>Ma mignonne</i>, you're a mummer&mdash;an' over serious for the part.'
  He raised her head in his hand. "<i>Ma foi</i>&mdash;where's your
  indifference, <i>ma chérie</i>!"</p>

  <p>"I never was&mdash;to you&mdash;vagabond&mdash;mummer. I always cared for
  you!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand's eyes turned from the tear-stained face to the watch.</p>

  <p>"You can't guess what it means," she shuddered. "Murder I never was so bad
  as that&mdash;murder!"</p>

  <p>"He does not live to avenge it, <i>ma petite</i>&mdash;and no one
  knows!"</p>

  <p>There was a pause, she kneeling with her face buried in the folds of his
  velvet cloak, he thinking of other things, his eyes on the watch.</p>

  <p>"There's&mdash;Heaven,' whispered Denise at last.</p>

  <p>"Heaven'll get one victim for this sin," he answered. "Let Montauban bear
  it before Heaven as before Earth&mdash;<i>Ma foi</i>&mdash;if we can deceive
  Brittany we can deceive God&mdash;there ain't so many sharp eyes in Heaven,"
  and he laughed with a flash of gleaming teeth and red eyes, but Denise
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>"There's&mdash;Hell," she said.</p>

  <p>"Where I'll be," he smiled, and she clung tight to his arm, but he rose
  and put her aside. "Buy an altar with your worn out bracelets an' you fear
  Heaven!" he laughed. "I must to Guildo," and he drew his sword, looked at it
  and slipped it back, turning to the door, but she sprang up desperately.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" she shrieked, "you don't think of me!" She threw her
  arms about him desperately&mdash;she could not let him go.</p>

  <p>"Think of you?" said Enguerrand. "<i>Morbleu</i>!&mdash;yes&mdash;but
  there are other things in life."</p>

  <p>"You said it was her wealth," cried Denise, clinging close, "you said
  'twas I alone you cared for&mdash;why must you go after her?"</p>

  <p>"An' you remember and believe so well all I say, you must mind I
  said&mdash;'she will be my wife'&mdash;now let me go&mdash;Denise."</p>

  <p>He was smiling, but not pleasantly, yet she took no warning from it, her
  face sank against his sleeve and she fell sobbing.</p>

  <p>"You spoke false to me!"</p>

  <p>"A miracle!" he said, "have you never heard that told of me before?" He
  put her away from him impatiently and whistled to his dog.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" screamed Denise in an agony. "You love her I I've done
  murder for you&mdash;and you love her!" She was wringing her hands, gazing at
  him with a distorted face. Enguerrand looked at her, suddenly flaring from
  his tolerant indifference into fury.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I love her!" he said fiercely. "Now&mdash;get out of my
  way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had no need to ask twice, she crawled to the wall in silence, and
  dropped down, lying along it, with her face hidden, and he watched her and
  seeing her quiet and tumbled, spoke again with his velvet eyes veiled and the
  savagery gone from his voice.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma petite</i>&mdash;you ask so much&mdash;you are unreasonable,
  Denise."</p>

  <p>He took his hat and mantle, tightened his sword belt and patted the
  dog.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, Denise," he said, smiling at her, prostrate along the dusty
  arras, but she did not answer and he shrugged his shoulders. "As you will,
  <i>ma mignonne</i>."</p>

  <p>He went to the door, the eager hound behind him, then suddenly stopped and
  took the red rose from his belt, throwing it back at the tumbled heap of blue
  and green&mdash;then to the dog:</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;St Anthony," he said very low, and the door closed on his
  magnificence.</p>

  <p>Denise sat up and stared at the flower, brilliant on the dull floor, with
  her hands to her ears that she might not hear his footsteps going away. A red
  rose!&mdash;for murder, lies, devotion, great love&mdash;hope of heaven
  lost&mdash;this was her reward.</p>

  <p>A long while she sat quite still with closed eyes shaping the picture of
  Enguerrand before her, in his jewels and his golden magnificence.</p>

  <p>"Why did I demand so much?" she asked herself. "I could have better lived
  on his toleration, better than without him." She went to the window and
  stared out&mdash;but he had gone, the place was deserted, and seized with' a
  sudden terror she rushed wildly to the door; but as she opened it her flight
  was arrested; Eneth stood in front of her and caught her by the
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What have you stayed behind for?" she gasped. "To see you safe out of
  this," he answered. "So he has left you, has he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! well, you'll come with me, Denise. Esper went with Montauban."</p>

  <p>"And you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall leave Brittany&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have money&mdash;" she interrupted eagerly, "a fortune."</p>

  <p>"Blood money!" he answered fiercely. "Think you I'll touch it? God forgive
  you for the taking of that fortune, Denise!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-30"
     id="ch-30"></a>XXX.&mdash;A PRISONER OF THE DEAD</h2>

  <p class="first">When Guy de Montauban rode to Guildo he took few men with
  him and but one thought; to assure himself of Françoise de Dinan and her
  dowry&mdash;for now she was free again and in his power.</p>

  <p>At first she refused to see him; it was close on noon before his threats
  and entreaties combined brought her down to the room where he waited in a
  fierce impatience. When she entered he was struck, almost startled, by a
  subtle change in her; she did not seem to be the same woman he had left here
  little over a month ago. She did not look ill, but she was very white and
  cold and her delicate cheeks slightly hollowed, her eyes slightly shadowed,
  her voice unnaturally level and colourless. And she was more elaborately
  dressed than he had ever seen her; her attire was usually splendid but
  simple, her hair dressed plainly, now she wore stiff satins and a gold corset
  laced across with jewels and for the first time there were pearls in her ears
  and in her curled hair which was gathered under a Princess's coronet and half
  concealed under a black veil, from her proud head to the tiny foot she
  glittered with gems, and the lines of a little song she used to sing occurred
  to Montauban and jingled in his ears.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">Gold as the sun in Autumn,<br>
  In radiant jewels dressed<br>
  Yet white as the waxen Virgin,<br>
  With the fire swords through her breast.</p><br>

  <p>For if Françoise was decked in splendour like a church image she might
  with much aptness have worn a bleeding heart on her breast, deep wounds she
  bore there, more than five, and all her magnificence seemed only the louder
  to proclaim them.</p>

  <p>"Is the Prince dead?" she asked with quivering nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Montauban, and for all the strange mar over her beauty he
  found her very fair as he studied her.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had not come else," she said slowly. "You come now I
  suppose for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You," he interrupted. "There is no need of words&mdash;you know
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In what way for me?" she answered. "You mean you'd marry me now?"</p>

  <p>"I mean I will."</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!"</p>

  <p>Her coldness was stirred into surprise, she lifted eyes a little heavy and
  looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Guy de Montauban. "Has this not been my goal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The lands of Dinan and Rohan," she interrupted. "You mean them?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You may add some love for you, Françoise." She checked him with a quick
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"It is terrible to hear you say that&mdash;it makes me feel vile
  indeed&mdash;my husband is scarcely dead."</p>

  <p>"He died in his sickness," said Montauban, as if her words contained an
  accusation.</p>

  <p>"He did!"</p>

  <p>A deep flush spread over her face and she half rose up.</p>

  <p>"Does that surprise you?" he demanded startled. "Did you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! don't say any more," she cried. "I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Our talk is not of him but of you&mdash;you were his wife only in name,
  you need not weep for him&mdash;I cannot dally long&mdash;I come to take you
  to Rennes."</p>

  <p>Montauban spoke abruptly, and Françoise lapsed into her calm again.</p>

  <p>"How if I refuse?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You are in the Duke's power," he answered. "Is it a question of refusal?
  Besides, it is your only chance."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Are there so many men of your own estate would marry you even for your
  dower? Do you want to sink lower and lower?"</p>

  <p>A bright colour swept over her fair face.</p>

  <p>"No," she said under her breath. "It is very terrible to be degraded."</p>

  <p>"There is none other than I can save you from it," answered Montauban,
  stopping in front of her. "What you have done will be forgiven my
  wife&mdash;but not the Prince's widow."</p>

  <p>She turned her face away and was silent a moment, while Montauban watched
  her keenly.</p>

  <p>"There are others would take up my cause," she said at last. "Count
  Enguerrand."</p>

  <p>Montauban made a movement of genuine horror. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>! You could
  think of him&mdash;you&mdash;a noble born at least&mdash;you
  could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He holds half this unhappy fortune of mine," murmured Françoise, flushing
  crimson with shame. "He is nothing to me&mdash;yet he might save me."</p>

  <p>"He is another tool of thine doubtless," said Montauban bitterly. "You're
  using him for your own ends&mdash;but what ends can you have now? Are you not
  utterly in my power&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You would seem to make me feel it," she answered, rising. "But I looked
  for nothing else from you." She stood erect with her back to him, and
  Montauban's dark eyes were fixed on her.</p>

  <p>"Will you take me?" he cried. "It is your only chance, unless you care for
  such a life as Enguerrand can give you."</p>

  <p>The sneer in his voice stung her to the quick.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" she cried eagerly. "I am not sunk to that&mdash;I'll marry you,
  Montauban&mdash;and be grateful."</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he answered quietly. "You were always clever enough to see
  your own advantage."</p>

  <p>And he turned away and looked from the window into the smooth ring of sea,
  but Françoise swung round with a sudden change in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Be gentle with me, Guy," she cried. "Oh, for heaven's sake be gentle with
  me!"</p>

  <p>He looked over his shoulder at her a moment, then came up close with a
  sudden impulse.</p>

  <p>"And if I am can you learn to love me a little?"</p>

  <p>Françoise sat down heavily, staring into his earnest face: then she broke
  into a sudden uncontrollable laugh.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what you're talking of," she said. "Love you? Don't you
  know I am here now at your mercy because I love another with my whole soul?
  Oh&mdash;you need not be angry, I am gone far beyond his ken&mdash;I shall
  never see him again&mdash;but I love him and shall&mdash;till I die."</p>

  <p>She rose again with another laugh and shook her shoulders as if dismissing
  something.</p>

  <p>"So there is an end of that, Guy&mdash;we'll never mention this subject
  again&mdash;but don't talk to me of&mdash;love!"</p>

  <p>"Nor you to me of Kristopher Fassiferne," answered Montauban furiously.
  "If you dare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned with an impatient scorn that made him stop.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose you can frighten me?" she said. "Haven't I run the whole
  gamut for him? Wasn't I ready to go down to open shame&mdash;to him? And
  <i>you</i> threaten me."</p>

  <p>"Still you shall not speak of him!" cried Montauban.</p>

  <p>"Did I?" she answered proudly. "Did I not say the subject was
  over&mdash;closed?"</p>

  <p>The glory of the sun in her hair showed like the red lights in wine and
  glittered on her many jewels and her eyes were weary beyond words.</p>

  <p>Yet she gave no signs of tears or grief or even anger against Montauban,
  she seemed as far from sorrow as from joy, she had brought herself strangely
  under control since last he saw her.</p>

  <p>He found it disconcerting and moved away from her to the other end of the
  chamber, painfully conscious of her dark eyes following him and the latent
  scorn in them.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>She spoke quietly but with a new note in her voice, and Montauban
  straining his ears caught a distant sound mingled with the beating of the
  sea&mdash;a sound like mingled voices and footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Brought you many with you?" cried Françoise. "No," he answered, staring
  at her. "Not above twenty men."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;fool We're trapped&mdash;they are forcing an entrance."</p>

  <p>"Who?" cried Montauban frantically.</p>

  <p>"How can I tell&mdash;maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He read the unuttered name in her face and remembering Gilles guessed.</p>

  <p>"If it is he&mdash;it is better we came to issues now&mdash;" and he drew
  his sword and flung himself forward on the door but in a few quick steps
  Françoise was beside him.</p>

  <p>"Bolt the door," she said. "If it's he&mdash;he'll kill you&mdash;and
  I&mdash;I could not bear to see him."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm a coward?" answered Montauban. "Whoever it
  is&mdash;there's fighting below."</p>

  <p>And he seized the handle but she clung to him in a white terror.</p>

  <p>"Hark!" she cried.</p>

  <p>Outside they heard a voice that both knew very well: it cried:</p>

  <p>"Which way? Which way?"&mdash;then&mdash;"Montauban! Montauban!"</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me," whispered Françoise. "I'm&mdash;afraid."</p>

  <p>But all Montauban's blood rose to answer and meet his enemy calling
  without, she could have checked him for only a second. The door was flung
  back in their faces and Kristopher stood facing them.</p>

  <p>With a quick instinct Montauban stepped back, dragging her with him, and
  before Kristopher could move he had flung her into the window seat and stood
  in front with his naked sword over her.</p>

  <p>He saw well enough what Kristopher had come for and he cursed the folly
  that had allowed himself to be trapped, yet his heart leaped to meet this
  man.</p>

  <p>But Kristopher did not appear to notice him, he looked past his dark
  figure to Françoise.</p>

  <p>"I have come to speak to&mdash;her&mdash;the woman," he said.</p>

  <p>"I stand for her," answered Montauban fiercely, but she struggled up and
  tried to thrust him aside.</p>

  <p>"Let him speak to me," she cried, and Kristopher came a step nearer,
  holding a paper out in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Did you write this?" he demanded and at sight of it and his face above
  she gave a sudden shriek.</p>

  <p>"So he has a second time betrayed me!"</p>

  <p>"So it's you wrote it!" thundered Kristopher, "and it stamps you twice as
  a murderess!"</p>

  <p>Again she shrieked in utter horror and Montauban flushed into a blind
  fury.</p>

  <p>"What do you talk of, you coward!" he cried, and seized hold of
  Kristopher's arm to fling him back, but he found himself shaken off against
  the wall with a force that half stunned him.</p>

  <p>"It's that woman I'm speaking of. That woman who murdered her
  husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There you lie," gasped Montauban, staggering up again. "I&mdash;I
  murdered Gilles of Brittany."</p>

  <p>Kristopher turned from her white rigidity to his tense wrath: they were
  both of them furious beyond control, in the grip of blind passion, beyond the
  touch of reason or restraint.</p>

  <p>"You murdered Gilles! But the first time&mdash;what she speaks of in this
  letter&mdash;it's she maimed him&mdash;she!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jesu!" cried Montauban. "Is that another lie&mdash;Françoise?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know what you're saying," she faltered and her
  words were so slurred they could hardly understand her. "I suppose&mdash;it's
  true."</p>

  <p>"It is not!" shouted Montauban, "and Gilles died by my orders&mdash;and I
  stand to answer it&mdash;and if you're not coward as well as liar you'll
  answer me!"</p>

  <p>Then Françoise threw herself between them and clung to Guy, looking at
  Kristopher speechlessly, but he with an incoherent cry thrust her aside into
  the window embrasure, where, her foot catching in her dress, she fell across
  the window heavily with a sharp cry of pain, and Montauban with one glance at
  her tossed aside his sword and flung himself on Kristopher with his bare
  hands.</p>

  <p>Then Françoise crouching silent behind them saw Kristopher lift Montauban
  up as if he had been a child, and shake him and fling him off so that he fell
  at her feet. But Montauban rose instantly and came at Kristopher with his
  dagger&mdash;only to have it wrested from him and tossed aside.</p>

  <p>Françoise saw they were struggling together and she hid her face
  instinctively till a short desperate cry made her look up and echo it.
  Kristopher had Montauban in his arms and was bending him backwards over his
  bent knee with a terrific force that left the other as helpless as a babe in
  his grasp.</p>

  <p>"Oh, pity I pity!" she wailed.</p>

  <p>But Kristopher held him even as Gilles of Brittany had been held and did
  not turn or relax for her feeble cry, and Guy de Montauban gave a moan of
  mortal agony as he writhed impotently.</p>

  <p>The next second Kristopher with a last effort bent him almost double and
  hurled him a second time at her feet.</p>

  <p>"So is Gilles revenged!" he cried with a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Françoise rose up by the window with a horrified face; the man at her feet
  was terrible to look on, he was trying to speak, but his teeth clicked
  meaninglessly, and his head rolled from side to side as he heaved up and down
  on the polished floor.</p>

  <p>"Aye, squirm like the miserable worm you are!" said Kristopher with
  blazing eyes. "Die&mdash;you mean traitor and murderer, would I could give
  ten such as you to appease the soul of Gilles of Brittany!"</p>

  <p>But Françoise bent down and half dragged up the dying man and stared into
  his twitching face, and a swift blackness seemed to fall over the rest of the
  room as she held him&mdash;only when his jaw fell loose and his eyes rolled
  stiff and the blood on his mouth glistened scarlet on a white face did she
  let him slip from her inert arms and rise to her feet to find the room full
  of scornful eyes, to see Kristopher pointing to her and thundering out
  hate.</p>

  <p>"Look at those two well!" he said. "The murderers of Gilles of Brittany!
  It's accursed they are&mdash;of God and man&mdash;it's only living she is
  because it's the bitterer part&mdash;living to face shame
  unutterable&mdash;to know her state beneath scorning as a street-whipped
  vagabond!"</p>

  <p>The English fell back awed by his fierce bitterness and the sight of the
  wild-faced woman above the prone man.</p>

  <p>"Look at her well!" continued Kristopher. "Sure, she's beautiful&mdash;but
  there's not a painted woman of the streets&mdash;not a dice-loading follower
  of the camps could not show a fairer soul than hers! Oh, surely as it's
  pitiful God can be&mdash;it's terrible he can be&mdash;as surely as I spare
  her wretched life now, she'll find it so!"</p>

  <p>The blood flamed into Françoise's cheeks as she realised she was the
  centre of a crowd, pilloried for common scorn, and as the shame of it rushed
  on her so awful was the look on her face that the man next Kristopher was
  moved to pity.</p>

  <p>"She is a woman," he whispered, but Kristopher's face was set in new lines
  of cruelty.</p>

  <p>"Yea, she is a woman!" he answered bitterly. "She may still trade on that,
  buyin' toleration with her eyes an' protection with her lips&mdash;'tis her
  profession! But for us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't curse me," said Françoise suddenly, her eyes roved round piteously.
  "Don't curse me!"</p>

  <p>"Shall it need for my curse?" he answered stormily. "When it's Gilles of
  Brittany's soul'll bear witness against you?"</p>

  <p>But her words had checked his outspoken wrath, he turned from her to the
  English behind him.</p>

  <p>"We'll on to Dol now."</p>

  <p>"You'll abandon Guildo?"</p>

  <p>"As a place accursed&mdash;go&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>The trumpets struck up into music; the men filed from the room with the
  clashing of pikes and halberts, and Kristopher leaning against the door
  watched them go with glittering eyes and his mouth set in a thin line. When
  the last had gone he made no movement to follow: his back was to Françoise,
  his face to the open door, he was silent with the exhaustion of the lull
  after great passion; only now and then he shook slightly, like the convulsion
  of sobbing strongly checked.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher."</p>

  <p>She spoke the name under her breath; she could not move from the window
  for Guy de Montauban lying across her path, but she leaned forward as far as
  she could.</p>

  <p>"What is to become of me?" she continued in the same low voice.</p>

  <p>He did not look round or answer, for all his inert figure showed he might
  not have heard her.</p>

  <p>"What is to become of me?" she repeated. This time he answered, though
  still without turning.</p>

  <p>"Can you think I care?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't suppose you do," she drew a deep breath and spoke very
  slowly. "You've killed the man who would have given me an honourable life
  you'd&mdash;let me go to the&mdash;gutter&mdash;I suppose&mdash;that's what I
  shall sink to&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Kristopher muttered the same answer.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I care?"</p>

  <p>Yet still he made no attempt to leave her, did not as much as change his
  weary position or lift his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you know why I betrayed Guildo?" asked Françoise. "For you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His utter motionless silence answered her.</p>

  <p>"And it makes no difference!" she cried sharply. "To me? No!"</p>

  <p>"Then it's useless for me to tell you I wrote that letter that I might be
  spared in your eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Everything is useless," broke in Kristopher,</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose I know it?" she cried. "I have done and you have spoken
  what has sundered us two&mdash;but&mdash;do you remember what you
  said&mdash;that nothing could make any difference&mdash;to love?"</p>

  <p>The silence that followed her slow words lasted some seconds, then she
  spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Kristopher."</p>

  <p>He made a slight movement but no response, and she continued:</p>

  <p>"You love me, Kristopher. As I love you, and ever shall&mdash;I've given
  my soul for you and you I think have given nothing for me&mdash;but you love
  me&mdash;I know it."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he drew himself straight by the door post.</p>

  <p>"It's Gilles&mdash;Gilles lying murdered&mdash;I stood by this mornin',"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I'm a murderess," she answered. "And you'll leave me and go
  back to&mdash;your wife&mdash;and I shall go
  downward&mdash;to&mdash;damnation."</p>

  <p>With an uncontrollable movement of agony Kristopher turned and at sight of
  his face she gave a little cry.</p>

  <p>"Yes! it hurts you&mdash;because you love me!"</p>

  <p>He stood as he had turned and stared at her, the space of the room
  between, the dead unheeded, and she leaning toward him pressed her hands
  together and trembled. 6</p>

  <p>"You can't give your soul away twice, Kristopher&mdash;you'll go back to
  her&mdash;but you'll give her nothing but cold respect&mdash;all you have of
  love and passion is mine&mdash;your very heart&mdash;Oh&mdash;my dear!"</p>

  <p>Kristopher came a step nearer and she fell back behind Guy, all her jewels
  suddenly glittering in the sun as she moved; without any change in his white
  intent face, he stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I'm mad I think," he said hoarsely. "To stay an' listen to you. I
  bear the Leopard on my coat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You stay because you love me&mdash;haven't you vowed it?"</p>

  <p>"Yea," he answered. "When you were pure&mdash;of crime&mdash;at
  least&mdash;but now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't lie to your own soul," she broke in. "You love&mdash;me."</p>

  <p>She put her arm up and hid her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go?" she, said faintly, then she looked up to see he stood
  close enough to touch her, only the body of Montauban dividing them.</p>

  <p>In the bright sun his face looked distorted and strange and his wide eyes
  were fixed on her as if they knew of nothing else to gaze on.</p>

  <p>Then he turned swiftly and walked steadily to the door and without looking
  back was gone.</p>

  <p>The sunshine scrolled away from Françoise like a rose leaf before flame;
  she stood in a misty dark and heard steady footsteps going away from her and
  knew she was alone.</p>

  <p>But she could not speak, a weight was over her tongue; she writhed mutely
  and tried to force the swirling darkness off with helpless hands, and
  desperately sought to find the window and the light, but that too had grown
  utterly black&mdash;she found herself both blind and dumb, only her ears were
  acute and they heard footsteps going&mdash;away.</p>

  <p>For a long while she stood erect, enveloped in blackness, then she felt a
  little wind blowing on the back of her neck and the veil was lifted and she
  di stared out on dim objects.</p>

  <p>The objects of a tomb, it was a tomb she stood in, utterly gray and damp
  and stifling, filled with thick air that stung in her nostrils&mdash;a burial
  vault, and in the centre lay a coffin with a prince's pall twitched
  aside.</p>

  <p>"I'm going mad," choked Françoise, and tried to close her eyes but could
  not, they were fixed on the coffin till every nail in it was burned into her
  brain.</p>

  <p>Under the lid hung out a golden curl and it was trailed over with
  blood.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" shrieked Françoise, flinging out her arms. "Oh, no!"</p>

  <p>Wildly she struggled for the possession of her senses and fumbled for some
  real object to steady herself by, but she groped in the dark and presently
  fell forward into what seemed a deep gulf where she lay prone and motionless.
  A perfume of limes and strong lilies smote her, she thought she could see the
  sun shining and feel the quiet of long shadows, the sense of splashing
  waters&mdash;she seemed back in Hardouinaye and Gilles of Brittany was riding
  toward her and he was young and strong and singing. Then as he came close
  enough to touch her he burst into a flame that scorched up the whole scene.
  Françoise shivered and moaned and dragged at the fastening of her dress in
  her stifling agony and strove to crawl forward, only to find herself held by
  something that gripped her dress.</p>

  <p>In her delirium she thought it was Gilles who clutched her and she
  muttered entreaties and strove feebly with him, calling again and again on
  Kristopher to save her; and presently she saw a hand that she seized gladly
  and held to for all it was cold and damp, as some protection against the
  awful shadows that were bearing down on her, the stifling multitude of shapes
  she was struggling against&mdash;things that held her down and mocked and
  shrieked.</p>

  <p>Suddenly something soft touched her cheek and the spell of her horror was
  broken, she looked up into reality.</p>

  <p>It was a white sea-gull that had flown in through the open window and now
  circled the low room slowly.</p>

  <p>With a shudder of exhaustion Françoise watched it and knew the nightmare
  had been snapped.</p>

  <p>The sea was behind her, the darkening room in front, the jasmine struggled
  in the sea breeze and the sun, grown ruddy for its setting, flung light on
  the imprisoned gull's wings.</p>

  <p>"I've been here a long time," moaned Françoise, "a long time."</p>

  <p>Then she realised she was lying along the floor, close to Montauban,
  holding one of his stiff hands in hers, and with a shriek she dropped it and
  leaped to her feet to find what it was held her. The dead man, the fingers of
  his right hand were locked firmly in her gown, she could not move from the
  window embrasure for his body in her path and his clutch on her dress.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" she implored. "Let me go!"</p>

  <p>And desperately she-tried to wrench herself free and when that proved vain
  she strove to loosen her dress&mdash;to escape that way, but her numb fingers
  struggled uselessly with the stiff fastening&mdash;she could not free
  herself.</p>

  <p>The thought came to her to step over him and rush away, but she pictured
  him dragging along the floor after her as she ran through the château unable
  to shake him off and she could not face it.</p>

  <p>The sea-gull found the window again and whirred past her head into the
  sun, and Françoise leaned back against the lattice and burst into sick
  sobbing and long stinging tears that choked her and made her struggle for her
  breath.</p>

  <p>She was utterly forsaken&mdash;to the meanest servant, all had forsaken
  her&mdash;there was no one to come and see whether she was dead or
  alive&mdash;no one to care&mdash;no she was beyond the sympathy of a churl,
  the kindness of her own footboy.</p>

  <p>A second time she made a desperate vain attempt to get free of Montauban
  and a second time she fell back&mdash;unable to weep now for sheer weariness
  and leaning her head against the open window stared on to the sea.</p>

  <p>A distant noise of life and laughter, footsteps and voices made her turn
  and face the room again&mdash;she could not think who could be coming and as
  the noise grew louder she crouched farther away.</p>

  <p>The footsteps of some one hurrying, the swinging open of doors&mdash;her
  name called loudly&mdash;and suddenly Françoise understood.</p>

  <p>And with the impulse her knowledge gave her she faced the door as it was
  flung back and Count Enguerrand entered.</p>

  <p>For a second they stood looking at each other, then he noticed Montauban
  at her feet and gave a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> so he left you with that? Well, you hate him
  now&mdash;don't you, <i>ma belle</i>!"</p>

  <p>She made no answer but as he came and kneeling before her wrenched
  Montauban's hand away she looked down at his handsome white face with a fury
  that made her own drawn and hard.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Enguerrand rising, "why don't you speak to me? I've come for
  you."</p>

  <p>Now he was sure of her, his tone was insolent, he was weary too, and her
  silence chafed him, he had expected pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, with his red eyes grown impatient. "Give me a better
  welcome than this&mdash;my wife to be."</p>

  <p>And catching hold of her he swung her over Montauban's body, but she
  writhed away and drew herself up against the wall and Enguerrand catching
  sight of her face stopped short.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he demanded, and the flush of his triumph deepened
  into anger. "You're coming with me now."</p>

  <p>She spoke now, interrupting fiercely.</p>

  <p>"So this was what you played for&mdash;beguiled me and betrayed me
  for&mdash;twice!"</p>

  <p>"What else?" he answered. "You guessed it&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! you knew
  I loved you."</p>

  <p>"Loved me!" she whispered. "Loved me!"</p>

  <p>She turned her face to the wall and he could guess at nothing from her
  weary words and pose, so with an amused laugh he came nearer and put his hand
  on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You'll not be sorry to come, <i>mignonne</i>," he said. "They've treated
  you badly&mdash;but I'll make amends&mdash;I'll set you up as a princess in
  the land again&mdash;as my wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your wife!" ejaculated Françoise and her tone roused him into anger
  again.</p>

  <p>"You should be pleased," he said insolently. "You're not my superior now,
  I think&mdash;they left you here for the first corner."</p>

  <p>Françoise interrupted him with a little faint laugh of scorn.</p>

  <p>"Your&mdash;wife!" she repeated.</p>

  <p>"<i>Parbleu!</i>" cried Enguerrand furiously. "Be not so proud, my lady.
  Thank your dowry it is as my wife you'll come to Bàrrès, for come you will
  and&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>Françoise turned further away with a little shudder.</p>

  <p>"How I do loathe you!" she whispered. "How I hate you, Count."</p>

  <p>Enguerrand clenched his hand till the plundered rings he wore cut the
  flesh in the effort to control his wrath; this was not the welcome he had
  looked for.</p>

  <p>"We'll make it no talk of love or hate, then," he said. "We'll say I'm
  taking you for the lands of Dinan, and you're coming because you must."</p>

  <p>"Not now," she put in. "I'm tired unto death&mdash;and the sight of you
  sickeneth me."</p>

  <p>"Make no words about it," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You've fooled many but you've met your master now."</p>

  <p>He caught hold of her wrist and dragged her into the light.</p>

  <p>"Who've you been weeping for?" he demanded, his wrath rising higher.
  "Didn't you know I'd come&mdash;weren't you content to wait?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought of you," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Who did you think of then? Who killed Montauban? Was it he&mdash;your
  Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she cried proudly. "He slew him splendidly!"</p>

  <p>"And you?" said Enguerrand, trembling with rage. "Didn't he throw you
  off?&mdash;Don't you hate him?"</p>

  <p>She looked up squarely into his eager red eyes. "No, I love him."</p>

  <p>At first she thought he was going to strike her with the little whip he
  carried and stood very still to meet it, but he turned away and began
  striding up and down the room while she sank on the window seat in an utter
  lassitude.</p>

  <p>"I'll kill you for that if you speak it again&mdash;you dare to talk of
  loving him&mdash;my thing, you&mdash;if you hate me you may, either way
  you're mine." Françoise rose up with her white face held high.
  "No&mdash;his&mdash;always his."</p>

  <p>Enguerrand stopped in his pacing and looked at her.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to strike you dumb?" he said passionately.</p>

  <p>Françoise's head sank slowly till her chin touched her breast and he
  waited in vain for her answer.</p>

  <p>She had nothing to say, she was completely conquered and after a while he
  laughed, and going to the door called the men who were plundering the château
  without.</p>

  <p>As he stood there talking to them, Françoise glanced up covertly at his
  splendid presence and wondered how she could have felt even a faint liking
  for him.</p>

  <p>For her hatred of him was now beyond all measure.</p>

  <p>Presently he came back to where she sat and demanded the keys of her
  jewels and the gold vessels, and when she gave them dully he flung them to
  the man at the door and bade him bring everything of worth to Bàrrès.
  Françoise was still motionless, only as he came up to her and lifted the
  black curls from her cheek she shuddered.</p>

  <p>"You're weary," he said, with a return of his elegant manner, a little
  moved too by the piteous droop of her figure, a little regretful of the
  passion that was needless when he had her so surely. "Françoise,
  <i>bien-amie</i>, look up at me&mdash;we'll not be unhappy." She did not
  change her posture of utter despair, but she answered very low.</p>

  <p>"You think you can make me happy?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, you'll be the first woman I've failed with if I don't," he
  answered smiling. "Only, <i>ma petite</i>, you must a little like me."</p>

  <p>One of his soldiers struck on the door&mdash;they were ready to march.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Enguerrand, and he held out his hand to Françoise, watching
  her keenly the while. For a second she was motionless; then she rose as one
  going reluctantly to death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-31"
     id="ch-31"></a>XXXI.&mdash;IN THE MOONLIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">The thick trees round Count Enguerrand's encampment were
  powdered silver with moonlight that night and the colour of the heavens was
  scarcely visible for the thick stars.</p>

  <p>So light it was that Françoise, standing at the entry of her tent and
  looking out on the night, could clearly distinguish the colours of the
  daffodils and violets in the long grass and count the men and horses under
  the trees.</p>

  <p>And Enguerrand's men, looking up to the group of ash trees where her tent
  stood, could see her distinctly enough to be impressed, almost awed, by her
  motionless figure and her stormy face.</p>

  <p>She had loosened her hair from its pins and combs; it fell straight to her
  waist obscuring the jewels on her bodice; her eyes were half closed through
  utter weariness, but very bright and restless.</p>

  <p>Though she was the only woman in the camp every man save Enguerrand was
  afraid of her; as she stood there so still in the moonlight, and looked down
  on them they would not have dared come near, even her steady gaze made them
  uneasy.</p>

  <p>Presently she turned back into the tent.</p>

  <p>A lantern stood on the ground; in the square of yellow light it cast the
  thick grass was visible and a great trail of columbine visible with its
  striped flowers scrolled.</p>

  <p>In one corner lay a pile of cloaks arranged as a rough couch, on them was
  flung a silver comb and mirror. Françoise stopped in the centre of the tent
  and pushed her hair back.</p>

  <p>The air, confined in the close canvas, was oppressive; she drew a quick
  breath and began unclasping her stiff, heavy bodice.</p>

  <p>With a sigh of relief she took off that and her thick trailing skirt,
  shook herself free of them and stood up straight and slender in her plain
  under garment, a gray kirtle that fitted tightly and bore her arms in the
  gold lilies on the breast. When she had done this she began walking up and
  down with purposeless words and gestures to herself.</p>

  <p>Her mind was a confusion, she could not see clearly either backward or
  forward; she hardly knew what had happened to her, why she was here, yet the
  moment when Kristopher had flung her off was clear as a picture before her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Her right arm was so bruised and sore where he had flung her against the
  window that she could hardly lift it. Enguerrand had done this thing; he had
  been the means; he had trapped her and flaunted her shame before
  Kristopher&mdash;Kristopher&mdash;</p>

  <p>She hated him so that when she Thought of him she uncontrollably shuddered
  as if at the remembrance of a leper.</p>

  <p>Yet she was going with him passively, she had heard him give orders for
  Bàrrès; she had no plan of revolt in her mind, no purpose; she only sat
  staring at the daisies at her feet and trembled with her loathing of
  Enguerrand. She felt herself very weak and helpless; she felt no remorse
  either for Gilles or Guy, but a vast pity for Françoise de Dinan who had been
  trapped so miserably.</p>

  <p>She began crying softly.</p>

  <p>Surely no one was to be pitied as much as she was, no, not Gilles maimed
  and murdered, not Guy suddenly slain, not Kristopher with a lost country and
  a broken heart had tasted such bitterness as she; for all they had suffered
  she had suffered double; all three of them had cursed her&mdash;but there had
  been no need&mdash;she was paying&mdash;dear Lord I&mdash;she had paid!</p>

  <p>She rocked herself to and fro; before her came the faces of those four
  men, two dead now, who had said "I love you!" and what had they done for
  her&mdash;nothing!</p>

  <p>She had been deceived by all of them, even by Gilles who had made her lie
  while he held that letter, by Guy, who had sent his spy to tempt her, by
  Kristopher who loved her and denied her, most of all by Enguerrand who had
  triumphed now, Enguerrand whom she hated, hated.</p>

  <p>And what was she to do?&mdash;how was she to get free of him?</p>

  <p>What was she to do?</p>

  <p>She slipped to her knees on the grass and caught hold of the columbine
  leaves, crushing them up in her hands; they were cool and fragrant to touch,
  the thick stalks were strong too; she could not have held herself up even on
  her knees without them.</p>

  <p>Mingled with the beating of the ash bough came another sound; the gentle
  breaking of branches and the swish of tall grass bent back.</p>

  <p>Françoise listened; it came from the side of the tent furthest from the
  entrance; some one was walking outside and stealthily, it seemed.</p>

  <p>She drew herself upright on her knees and her eyes widened with
  expectancy, waited, holding herself alert.</p>

  <p>There was a movement on the canvas without, then a sudden sharp rip of
  stuff and the gleam of a knife ran along from top to bottom. The taut canvas
  flew apart in a great slash and a bar of moonlight fell over Françoise's
  white face.</p>

  <p>A boy whom she did not know stood in the aperture, gazing down at her and
  she spoke, faintly, from a cloud of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer stepped into the tent without a word and slipped the knife
  back into his waist-belt.</p>

  <p>Françoise suddenly gave a little cry: "Oh! you are Montauban's spy!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Denise, standing over her with a passionate face, "that and
  some other things&mdash;stand up and listen to me, Françoise of
  Brittany."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she stepped back against the tent and leaned there, panting.
  Françoise rose, excitement lending her strength. "Now what have you come to
  say?" she asked. "Whose messenger are you now?"</p>

  <p>"I stand for myself," answered Denise, "I have been following you&mdash;I
  came from Hardouinaye&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" breathed Françoise.</p>

  <p>The two women faced each other&mdash;hardly a foot apart, Denise breathing
  hard, flushed and passionate, Françoise very white and quiet.</p>

  <p>"Following me?" she said as the other did not answer.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;him," flung back Denise. "He loves you&mdash;doesn't he? Jesu I
  One might wonder why&mdash;I think you're no better now than I, Françoise of
  Brittany!"</p>

  <p>She drew herself up defiantly and her gray eyes glowed fiercely.</p>

  <p>"God he knoweth I am better than none," said Françoise quietly, "and if
  you speak of Enguerrand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," put in Denise, "Enguerrand."</p>

  <p>The heavy eyes of Françoise lifted and measured her; took in her disguise,
  her face, her quality, something of her mission too.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you are here&mdash;secretly?" she questioned. "Yes&mdash;I've
  been dismissed."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Françoise. "I understand."</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the pile of cloaks and put her hand to her forehead,
  turning a dull face toward the other woman.</p>

  <p>"I've been in the camp yonder," said Denise swiftly, "I've been gathering
  threads&mdash;and now I've&mdash;come to you&mdash;but&mdash;tell me, do you
  hate me, Françoise of Brittany?"</p>

  <p>The slight gray-clad figure on the rich embroidery was shaken with a
  shudder.</p>

  <p>"I hate him," she answered.</p>

  <p>"And you have need!" cried Denise. "Even with what you know you have
  need&mdash;but&mdash;you do not know&mdash;or do you?&mdash;that he has
  planned to catch and slay&mdash;the Englishman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Kristopher!" said Françoise&mdash;"To kill Kristopher!"</p>

  <p>"He struck him," flashed Denise. "Full on the face&mdash;before all his
  men&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" burst out Françoise hysterically. "My lord is
  magnificent&mdash;so he struck him&mdash;on the face!"</p>

  <p>A smile curled Denise's hard mouth.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "I like your Englishman&mdash;I am greatly indebted to
  him for that blow&mdash;now what will you do to help me save him?"</p>

  <p>Françoise tried to rise but at her first movement she grew so giddy that
  she fell back with a weak laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm ill," she whispered. "I cannot think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The hard-living, shameless vagabond whose nerves were of steel, whose body
  was inured to privation and fatigue, gave a curious glance at the broken
  figure of the great lady who was fainting under the burden of her shame.</p>

  <p>Even in her present wild mood she was touched by the fact that Françoise
  accepted quietly that she had fallen to the other's level and made no sign of
  distaste at her company.</p>

  <p>"You are very humbled, Françoise of Brittany," she said curiously. "You
  looked over my head once&mdash;I had thought you might be proud still."</p>

  <p>Françoise said nothing; her fingers moved slowly through the shut daisies
  by her side and her eyes were vacantly on the lantern light.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Denise coming nearer, "The Englishman has been at
  Hardouinaye&mdash;burying the Prince&mdash;he leaves there to-morrow morning
  for Dol&mdash;he will have his wife with him."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Françoise faintly.</p>

  <p>"The way to Bàrrès passes Hardouinaye. Enguerrand will lie in wait for the
  Englishman&mdash;he has only a handful of English&mdash;do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Dear God!" whispered Françoise.</p>

  <p>Denise laid a steady hand on her shoulder, looked eagerly down into the
  wild black eyes. "You and I, Françoise of Brittany, have been accomplices
  before&mdash;when the Prince died&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear God!" shuddered Françoise again.</p>

  <p>"We've gone too far to go back&mdash;both of us," cried Denise wildly.
  "Don't you see what next there is to do&mdash;we are two women whom he has
  laughed at&mdash;but don't you see? And if you want to save the
  Englishman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well?" Françoise struggled to her feet. "You hate
  him&mdash;don't you?" breathed Denise. "And I also&mdash;that is why I came
  to you&mdash;he'll come to you I think&mdash;oh, yes, your lure is new
  enough&mdash;well then to-night&mdash;and there need be no ambuscade for your
  lover to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!" shrieked Françoise. "No! I cannot do it again!"</p>

  <p>She wrung her hands and swayed forward. Denise caught her by the shoulder,
  supporting her.</p>

  <p>"Has he tamed you then?" she cried fiercely. "He said he'd hold you in his
  hand&mdash;bring you to kiss his shoe&mdash;has he done it?"</p>

  <p>Françoise lifted her head. "He said that of me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and you&mdash;said you hated him."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;oh yes."</p>

  <p>Françoise, half slipping through the other's grasp, fell back against the
  canvas.</p>

  <p>"Well, send for him," said Denise. "Ask him to come here now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She watched eagerly for the effect of her words; she felt Françoise
  quiver, then straighten under her grasp, saw how her breast was struggling
  under the gold lions of Brittany on her dress, saw at last her face lifted,
  struck into a passion as great as her own.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;we should kill him&mdash;with a lure&mdash;well, I have done
  worse things than that&mdash;in cooler blood too&mdash;I have a fever
  to-night." She brought the laboured words to an end and showed her bruised
  arm to the other. "See what my lord did to me!" she cried. "Is he not
  splendid&mdash;my lord? he spurned me royally&mdash;he put me to
  shame&mdash;but I have broken his heart!"</p>

  <p>Denise was silent before her tumultuous words and distorted beauty;
  Françoise in a fever close on madness, began laughing.</p>

  <p>"He struck Enguerrand I Across his hateful face&mdash;I would give my life
  to do the same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Send for him," cried Denise&mdash;"Surely he will come?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;he'll come&mdash;'I hate you as I love the other man,' I said
  to him&mdash;he cursed me but he has some pride&mdash;'you're free of me till
  we get to BArrês,' he said&mdash;'but you'll send for me before that.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to-night&mdash;to meet me to-night!" Françoise suddenly caught her
  in a passionate embrace.</p>

  <p>"Ah I did you not dream it all differently, long ago, I mean&mdash;when
  you were a child. I did&mdash;once&mdash;oh, you are a woman&mdash;and you
  will touch me still&mdash;put your arms round me&mdash;I've never loved a
  woman, but kiss me&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Denise trembled under the soft, warm weight in her arms; she looked at the
  fever-flushed face and her own quivered.</p>

  <p>"We have no time for tears," she said unsteadily. "And, sweetheart, you
  will make me cry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've been a hard cheat," shuddered Françoise, clinging to her. "I would
  to God I had died when&mdash;I dreamed it all so differently&mdash;you
  know&mdash;what I mean&mdash;I've gone beyond remorse now."</p>

  <p>"But not beyond hate," said Denise hoarsely. "Think what he did to
  you&mdash;think of the Englishman trapped to-morrow&mdash;bring him here to
  meet me&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Françoise. "No!&mdash;but I will go to&mdash;warn
  Kristopher&mdash;I can escape&mdash;I cannot look on blood again."</p>

  <p>She shuddered her face on to the other's shoulder, clutching her fingers
  in the rumpled doublet.</p>

  <p>"Stay with me," she said wildly. "Go with me&mdash;have pity on
  me&mdash;don't ask any more from me! Jesu! I have done enough!"</p>

  <p>"You make a fool of me!" answered Denise with a hard catch in her voice;
  she lifted the head from her shoulder and with her fingers under the chin,
  stared down at the flushed face.</p>

  <p>"You are very sweet, Françoise of Brittany," she said. "Why do you cling
  to me?&mdash;I came here to kill Enguerrand."</p>

  <p>Françoise shook with a sob.</p>

  <p>"I've been hard! hard!&mdash;I've been a liar, a&mdash;I meant to
  be&mdash;all because I loved my lord&mdash;and when I'd given my soul for him
  he flung me off&mdash;I want to die now&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;but I
  will go and warn him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But the other man?" cried Denise. "The man we both hate?"</p>

  <p>"May, I never see his face again," murmured Françoise, "but I cannot lure
  him to be slain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me free then&mdash;let go of me!"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;stay with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Denise tried fiercely to unlock her hands, but Françoise held her tight,
  her half-swooning face against the other's breast, and, at the feel of it
  there a wild tenderness distracted Denise; she tried to push her away, yet at
  the same time she supported her; she had not been sorry for herself, but she
  was bitterly sorry for Françoise, lying against her weak as a stricken
  doe.</p>

  <p>"Sweetheart&mdash;you must not," she began&mdash;when suddenly Françoise
  unclosed her black eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hush!"</p>

  <p>They drew themselves apart, erect, listening. There was a sound of singing
  without and it drew nearer.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Denise in a trembling whisper. "He comes&mdash;of
  himself&mdash;he comes!"</p>

  <p>Swiftly she turned the lantern over; they were in the dark save for the
  drift of moonlight that came through the gash in the canvas.</p>

  <p>Françoise stood with her finger-tips on her lips and no purpose in her
  mind; she felt Denise hold her arm and heard the singing of Enguerrand coming
  nearer, her eyes fell to the columbine flowers in the patch of moonlight and
  the crowds of little daisies about them.</p>

  <p>He was very close now; she felt Denise's fingers tighten and put out her
  other hand to close it over hers; the companionship was very dear to her
  now.</p>

  <p>The tent flap was lifted; Françoise saw him outlined against the dim trees
  beyond.</p>

  <p>"Françoise," said the slow, insolent voice. "I grew weary of waiting for
  you&mdash;Françoise." He stooped and came into the tent, the two women clung
  together, silent, unseen.</p>

  <p>"Françoise, I could not sleep to-night," he said. "We march in an hour's
  time&mdash;for Hardouinaye "&mdash;she spoke out of the shadows in a
  contained voice:</p>

  <p>"Why to Hardouinaye?"</p>

  <p>He turned to where the voice came from.</p>

  <p>"To settle with the Englishman."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried Françoise, "and I am to be there to see!"</p>

  <p>Enguerrand laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "Where are you&mdash;Françoise?" He came full into the
  moonlight, straining his eyes into the corners.</p>

  <p>"Françoise!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>A woman's figure formed itself out of the darkness; a small hand was laid
  on his and drew him gently out of the moonshine.</p>

  <p>"Enguerrand," said the voice of Françoise. "Will you slay him for love of
  me&mdash;or for that blow on the face?"</p>

  <p>He started to think she knew; the darkness was confusing him, the hand had
  gone from his arm; he reached out and caught hold of some one who came
  unresistingly.</p>

  <p>"Why, for both causes," he said, drawing her up to him&mdash;"and who told
  you, Françoise?"</p>

  <p>She lay quietly in his arm; there was a sound like broken hysterical
  laughter from the corner of the tent; Enguerrand startled, lifted his head
  and for the first time noticed the torn tent.</p>

  <p>"<i>Morbleu</i>!&mdash;now what is this!" he cried.
  "Françoise&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>He felt the woman grow tense in his embrace and in a sudden terror let go
  of her; but she clung to him and he felt she was striking up at him with a
  bare knife.</p>

  <p>With a passionate cry he felt for his sword, but some one was clinging to
  it; some one had him by the cloak, the knees, hampering him, and again the
  woman struck.</p>

  <p>He felt his own blood run warm over his hand as he struggled to fling her
  off, but he laughed as he tugged at his sword.</p>

  <p>"Who is the other one?&mdash;come into the light, sweetheart!" he called
  out.</p>

  <p>His great strength wrenched him free of both of them, he staggered
  backward into the open and drew his sword at last. But as it flew out he fell
  heavily on to his knees and could not find voice to call out to his men.</p>

  <p>For a moment his bleeding face was turned to the tent, the next instant he
  was prone on the grass with his sword snapped under him. He was aware of two
  women clinging together and laughing weakly, and he wanted to laugh too
  savagely; he struggled on to one elbow.</p>

  <p>"Denise!" he smiled, "by Christ! Denise!" Then he fell over and lay
  still.</p>

  <p>"Now he is dead," whispered Denise, "and&mdash;he knew
  me&mdash;run&mdash;you&mdash;before they find him."</p>

  <p>Françoise was staring at him with dilated eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why did you strike his face?" she breathed. "Look how&mdash;it
  runs&mdash;down his cheek&mdash;the blood, ah!&mdash;and your hands!"</p>

  <p>"At least he will not ride in an hour's time to Hardouinaye!" cried
  Denise. "Kristopher is safe&mdash;and I have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come away!" shrieked Françoise. "There is blood on the grass and on my
  feet&mdash;God! why did you strike his face? you have blinded him&mdash;ah,
  curse the moonlight! I could have done anything in the dark!"</p>

  <p>"You have roused the men!" said Denise. "Run&mdash;for your life!"</p>

  <p>She turned herself and doubled through the trees like a hare; Françoise
  dropped to her knees beside Enguerrand and caught hold of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Get up&mdash;" she said, "get up and kill me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sound of distant shouting made her look up&mdash;</p>

  <p>Enguerrand's men were running up the slope toward her.</p>

  <p>Fear for herself, for her life seized her; she fled into the forest with
  her hands over her ears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-32"
     id="ch-32"></a>XXXII.&mdash;RIDE ON!</h2>

  <p class="first">She ran for a while aimlessly, hardly conscious of her body;
  the slim trees raced by her, and sleeping birds, startled at her approach,
  fluttered dark into the moonlight; once a swift fox crossed her path and then
  a rabbit flying through the bracken.</p>

  <p>She dropped on to her side at last, and lay panting on last year's leaves,
  starred With primroses, while she looked up at the silent trees.</p>

  <p>It came to her as strange that she had not been caught yet; she would be
  caught she knew, and before long.</p>

  <p>The strong, fragrant bracken half hid her; she laid her head on the ground
  among primroses and violets, the beech mast and dead leaves; the world seemed
  flying about her in shreds of darkness; she was drawn tense to hear the thud
  of hoofs nearing, the war cry of Enguerrand's men.</p>

  <p>But there was a perfect stillness; she began to wonder what she should do;
  all her instincts cried out to her to hurry on&mdash;on&mdash;to plunge
  deeper and deeper into the forest, then she remembered she must be nearing
  Dol.</p>

  <p>She sat up with the dead bracken in her hair.</p>

  <p>Kristopher would ride by here&mdash;near, she knew where&mdash;she knew
  the road from Hardouinaye to Dol.</p>

  <p>She would go and watch him pass; Enguerrand's men might find him&mdash;if
  need be she could warn him. She drew herself erect and set her face toward
  the highroad; she could find her way, she thought. The brambles and wild
  roses caught at her, tearing her dress; save for the gold lilies on her bosom
  she might have been a beggar wench.</p>

  <p>It was the first time in her life that she had been alone in the woods at
  night; the sense of loneliness and freedom, the quiet, sleeping things about
  her made her feel disembodied; her wild life had fallen away utterly; she
  felt very sure this was the end.</p>

  <p>She thought of nothing; only there came to her broken memories of the
  beginning of life, how she had gone nutting in these woods with her cousin,
  and how he had caught a squirrel for her which she had kept in a cage over
  her bed; she had been fond of it, she remembered, but one day she had given
  it cake to eat that killed it and her cousin had said she had done it on
  purpose because they had quarrelled.</p>

  <p>She had always loved this forest; it was more beautiful now than she had
  ever seen it under the sun; honeysuckle and sweet briar were giving forth a
  pungent scent to right and left of her; anemones and primroses made the
  ground soft for her feet; she walked rapidly, feeling no longer fatigue or
  giddiness.</p>

  <p>Presently she came to a little wooden bridge well known to her and stopped
  there staring down into the stream.</p>

  <p>Now she was not far from where Kristopher must pass on his way to Dol.</p>

  <p>As she leaned on the moss-grown rail, she grew aware of a change coming
  over everything; the stars she had seen reflected at her feet, began to get
  lost in the dark water, she looked up and saw that they were being absorbed
  into a silver sky; the moon was sinking like a great pearl behind the
  sharp-cut purple trees; it grew colder; there was a stir of birds in the
  leaves; Françoise looked again into the unfathomable water, and saw it
  faintly stained with red and orange; then she turned round and saw the sun
  was rising behind her; as she looked the lilies sparkled in their gold
  threads on her dress and liquid light began to run through the trees.</p>

  <p>Then, all at once, it was day.</p>

  <p>Françoise saw everything about her breaking into colour; the banks of the
  stream were turquoise with forget-me-nots and a little tree beside her showed
  itself a snowy hawthorn. Françoise hurried on; ran till her side hurt her and
  she had to hold it, panting. The smooth wide highroad showed at last; she lay
  down in the fern, with her eyes on it. As the sun grew brighter she could see
  the whole length of it, almost to the gates of Dol.</p>

  <p>The sky was changing to a faint, cloudy blue; she strained her ears for
  the sound of pursuers&mdash;here Enguerrand was to have met and slain
  Kristopher&mdash;she had saved that, she thought, at whatever price to her,
  at least he would go free.</p>

  <p>Presently she heard the bridle bells and dragged herself on her elbow to
  watch. It was he, riding from Hardouinaye. She struggled to her knees, filled
  with a wild desire to attract attention&mdash;she had saved him.</p>

  <p>The little cavalcade came on at a smart trot, he had Gregan Griffiths with
  him, his sister and his wife; not above ten men-at-arms, on his surcoat she
  saw the English leopard.</p>

  <p>The thought of her danger came to her&mdash;surely he could not leave her
  to die&mdash;if she stepped into the road before his horse and called to
  him?&mdash;surely if he knew she was there he must stop and save her!</p>

  <p>She dragged herself nearer the road; she could not let him pass in
  silence&mdash;she could not let him go.</p>

  <p>Eagerly she strained her eyes for a sight of his face.</p>

  <p>It was turned from her toward his wife and he was smiling.</p>

  <p>Françoise drew back into the fern with her fingers at her lips; she could
  not cry out.</p>

  <p>She had a vision of Yvonne-Marie's sweet, contented face, of Kristopher's
  fresh-coloured and smiling, and they had swept past her, the Leopard of
  England glittering on the banners.</p>

  <p>For a while she lay quite still, then she looked after them till they were
  lost in the distance.</p>

  <p>"So," she said miserably, "you don't care&mdash;you will live&mdash;I
  think&mdash;to forget."</p>

  <p>Aimlessly she turned back into the forest, numb at heart.</p>

  <p>It was bright daylight now and the grass lay in an emerald slope before
  her; eased of a fear and a hope she felt tired and giddy again.</p>

  <p>But a sudden sound roused her and sent the blood warm through her veins.
  The sound of horsemen galloping through the trees.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;they had found her, but they had missed him&mdash;he was in Dol
  by now.</p>

  <p>She turned at bay against a hawthorn tree with no attempt to fly.</p>

  <p>They came fast through the bracken, fifty of them; they were on her before
  she had time to realise them, had seen her and burst into savage shouts.</p>

  <p>At sight of their leader she shrieked too: "Enguerrand!"</p>

  <p>He had drawn up his powerful horse within a few feet of her; his face was
  white and bandaged; but his red eyes and his laugh were the same.</p>

  <p>"So I have found you!" he said fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Enguerrand!" she cried again, "so you live!"</p>

  <p>"Are you not glad of it?" he answered. "<i>Morbleu</i>! I do not think I
  shall die by a woman's spiteful tricks&mdash;but as for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As for me," she broke in wildly, "I have lived my life!&mdash;And he is
  safe!"</p>

  <p>"The Englishman!" shouted Enguerrand.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she flung back&mdash;"and so I care not if you die or live&mdash;he
  is in Dol by now!"</p>

  <p>He swayed on his horse in a passion of wrath&mdash;she stepped to his
  stirrup and looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"And he struck you&mdash;before these, she said.</p>

  <p>"And you shall pay for it!" yelled Enguerrand. "Did I not say you had met
  your master in me? You shall stand proxy for him!"</p>

  <p>He leaned down, caught her by the shoulder and flung her on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Ride her down!" he thundered to his men. "Ride her down!"</p>

  <p>Françoise shrieked out:</p>

  <p>"No! not under the hoofs!"</p>

  <p>But Enguerrand rose in his stirrup and struck at his plunging horse.</p>

  <p>Françoise shrieked again and struggled to catch hold of him&mdash;to keep
  him off her.</p>

  <p>"Ride her down!" shouted Enguerrand. "Ride her down!"</p>

  <p>He dashed his whip into her face as his horse thundered over her and never
  looked back as his fifty men galloped after him, trampling her fair body
  beneath the iron hoofs.</p>

  <p>Her face, her hair, the gold lilies of France were mangled together; her
  proud blood was beaten into the dirt and spattered over the horse's hoofs; as
  the last man passed her he looked down and cried out&mdash;so terrible was
  she to see; her black hair caught and clung to his stirrup, he stooped and
  freed himself with a wild curse.</p>

  <p>"Ride on!" came Enguerrand's voice. "Ride on!"</p>

  <p>And so they passed in a mad gallop through the forest of Hardouinaye,
  leaving the wolves to deal with Françoise of Brittany.</p>
