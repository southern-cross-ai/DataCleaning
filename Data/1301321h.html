  <h2><a name="ch-00"
     id="ch-00"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p>The following pages contain an account of the life of the woman known as
  Charlotte de Corday, with which are interwoven the lives of the man whom she
  slew and the man who died for championing her memory. It is indeed
  impossible, if a true balance is to be preserved in the story of Mlle. de
  Corday, to ignore either Jean-Paul Marat or Jean-Adam Lux. Nor is it complete
  without some reference to the man who inspired these people, complete
  strangers until they met in the summer of 1793, to destroy each other.
  Jean-Paul Marat had never heard of Charlotte de Corday when she entered his
  presence on that afternoon of July 13th, 1793. Jean-Adam Lux had never heard
  of Charlotte de Corday until she had only a few days to live; he never saw
  her until she was on her way to death.</p>

  <p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau's teachings inflamed, exalted and brought together
  these three people of different races, to their destruction and their
  immortality. The Sardinian French cosmopolitan, the purebred Norman, the
  German from Mayence, had each in several ways and according to a peculiar
  temperament, imbibed the doctrines of Rousseau, and the two latter had
  brooded long and deeply over the book that had been the inspiration of the
  Genevan watchmaker's son&mdash;<i>Plutarch's Lives of Illustrious
  Men.</i></p>

  <p>Not only then are these three people of remarkable interest because of the
  tragic drama they played in the midst of anarchy, but because they received
  the impetus for their actions from a common source.</p>

  <p>To force this point would be vexatious, for in each case character,
  circumstance, environment, shaped and directed the life, but in the
  background was always <i>Du Contrat Social, Emile,</i> the enthusiasm for the
  heroes of Plutarch, an almost frantic idealism, an ardent admiration for
  antiquity and its fabulous virtues.</p>

  <p>The story of Charlotte de Corday arouses no controversy, postulates no
  problem; it is simple, straightforward and well authenticated to most of the
  smallest details; the slight discrepancies in one or two unimportant
  particulars have been dealt with in the Note given above the Bibliography at
  the end of this volume. Though the main outlines of the story I have here
  attempted to tell are well known, it has never been related to English
  readers in full detail and as a consecutive narrative based on the vast
  contemporary material and the researches of modern French scholars. This is
  my excuse for essaying a subject as difficult as fascinating.</p>

  <p>The title&mdash;a translation of Alphonse Lamartine's <i>"L'ange de
  l'assassinat"</i>&mdash;may appear too melodramatic for what professes to be
  a sober study of facts, but the subject itself is melodramatic as only
  reality can be.</p>

  <p class="first">In the month of July, 1768, Madame de Corday d'Armont came
  for a visit from her house at Mesnil-Imbert to the farm of
  Ronceray-les-Ligneries, near Vimoutiers, which was part of her husband's land
  and where one of her relations resided. She was a gentle, quiet woman of a
  melancholy and resigned appearance, of an old Norman family, entitled to be
  called <i>noble dame</i>, but weighted down by the burden of aristocratic
  poverty. She was pretty, but delicate, and had lost the sight of one eye.</p>

  <p>Ronceray is situated near the borders of Orne and Calvados, in a lonely
  part of Normandy. Meadows, orchards and marshy ground surrounded the modest
  farm-house, which was little better than the dwelling of a well-to-do
  peasant, though dignified by the title of <i>logis</i>. It consisted of two
  floors, the ground rooms being paved with flagstones; the windows were low
  and narrow, the fireplaces large and open. A natural spring flowing into a
  pleasant sheet of water graced the home fields and the immediate landscape of
  pasturage and orchards of pear trees was encircled by irregular hills.</p>

  <p>Madame de Corday d'Armont had been married four years and was the mother
  of two boys, Jacques-François and Charles-François. She was expecting the
  birth of a third child, and while she was reposing in the isolated farm-house
  she was suddenly taken by the pangs of labour and her daughter was born in
  the humble bedchamber on the first floor. In order that mother and infant
  might not be disturbed, and as a sign of rejoicing that another child had
  been born to the noble house of Corday, one of the most ancient in the
  Calvados and the Orne, the peasants beat the marshes all night to silence the
  frogs.</p>

  <p>The day after her birth the infant was taken to the little church of
  <i>Saint Saturnin-des-Ligneries</i> which, austere and lonely, yet stands,
  environed by fertile fields and wind-shaped oaks, in a narrow, peaceful
  valley. M. de Corday d'Armont himself was present at the baptism, the
  godmother was <i>noble dame</i>, Françoise-Marie-Anne-Levaillant de Corday,
  and the godfather, <i>messire</i> Jacques-Alexis-de-Gautier, <i>écuyer
  seigneur</i> of Mesnival, a relation to Madame de Corday d'Armont.</p>

  <p>The child was christened Marie-Anne-Charlotte, and when her birth was
  registered at the <i>mairie</i> of Exorches, her father was described as
  <i>messire</i> Jacques-Francois de Corday <i>écuyer seigneur</i> d'Armont,
  and her mother as <i>noble dame</i> Marie-Jacqueline de Gautier.
  Marie-Anne-Charlotte might then claim on either side blood that entitled her
  to rank among the provincial nobility.</p>

  <p>She was also, on either side, of pure Norman descent. The Cordays could
  trace their titles of nobility to 1077; their arms were surmounted by the
  coronet of a Count, the blue shield with the three broken chevrons (<i>d'azur
  a trois chevrons, brisés d'or</i>) was distinguished by the rebus <i>Corde et
  Ore</i>. These Norman gentlemen, of untainted blood and unsmirched
  reputations, soldiers, civil servants, modest landowners, lived from
  generation to generation on their hereditary estates. They were proud of the
  title <i>gentilhommes</i>, that is, nobles of the land and the sword, owing
  their rank to their services, not to court favour. Sturdy, robust,
  independent, typical Normans, with a strain of mysticism and obstinacy, the
  Cordays had not produced by 1768 any outstanding character, although there
  was, especially among the women, a reputation for a certain eccentricity.
  They were, however, connected by marriage with two of the most famous names
  in French literature; Marie-Anne-Charlotte de Corday d'Armont was the
  great-granddaughter of Pierre Corneille, whose grand-daughter had espoused
  Adrien de Corday in 1701. Through this marriage the Cordays might also claim
  kinship with Bernard de Fontenelle, Corneille's nephew, who lived to be a
  hundred years old and who was said to have a second brain instead of a heart
  within his breast.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>M. de Corday d'Armont took his wife and infant daughter back to his
  father's domain of Mesnil-Imbert, the Manor house of which, though officially
  described as <i>manoir seigneurial</i>, was no more than a comfortable
  farm-house.</p>

  <p>M. de Corday de Cauvigny's estate of Mesnil-Imbert was enclosed by wooded
  hills, crowned by wind-swept oaks, and the Manor house was built on a slope
  above a valley and covered with apple trees. Handsome chestnut trees shaded
  the sheds, barns and bakehouse; a deep well provided abundant fresh water.
  The dwelling itself was solid and attractive, with its peaceful air of family
  life and the natural labours of the land. The house, heavily beamed, was
  covered by a hip roof of slate, the bricks faded to an old rose-colour, the
  windows of unequal size, the entrance modest. A simple flower-garden, fields,
  orchards formed the domain that was peaceful and solitary to the point of
  melancholy.</p>

  <p>The fecund Norman landscape was monotonous if agreeable. Agriculture was
  the sole occupation of this part of the province Calvados, which took its
  name, according to a fantastic legend, from a vessel of the Invincible
  Armada, the <i>Salvador</i>, that foundered on the reefs on the coast at
  Asnelles. The air was humid, frequent sea winds twisted the trees and
  stripped the foliage, and there were long periods of rain, grey clouds, and a
  chill light without brilliancy.</p>

  <p>The Manor house consisted of a vestibule, coldly paved with flags, a large
  kitchen with open joists overhead, a huge pent-house chimney supported by
  large corbels, a wainscoted dining-room and a wide stairway leading to the
  first floor, which consisted of three chambers and three closets. The
  furniture was heavy, old-fashioned, and designed entirely for use; there were
  no luxuries, but as many comforts as the age afforded in the way of warmth,
  food, service. There were a few books, a few pictures, one or two musical
  instruments, respectable hangings, drapery and silver, and the walls were
  wainscoted or papered, but apart from these refinements it was a life without
  polish, without amusement, without leisure. It was also, because of constant
  poverty and the galling contrast between means and pretensions, a life
  without gaiety.</p>

  <p>M. de Corday d'Armont was the third son of M. de Corday de Cauvigny, from
  whom he had received Armont as his portion. A poor portion the young man had
  always considered it, and the difference between his birth and his revenues
  had galled him ever since he had left the College of Beaumont-en-Auge at Pont
  l'Evêque, where he had been educated. In character and intellect he was
  mediocre, in his tastes simple, ordinary in his opinions, depressed by the
  struggle to bring up a family on an income that never exceeded fifteen
  hundred <i>livres</i>. M. de Corday d'Armont was a true Norman in appearance,
  tall, robust, inclined to stoutness, with small, regular features and bright
  colouring between red and gold.</p>

  <p>He lived on a farm entitled Bois on this estate of his father,
  Mesnil-Imbert, and rented the lands of Ronceray, where he grazed cattle and
  tilled the land, not disdaining himself to assist in the manual labour.</p>

  <p>This farm, to which he returned with his infant daughter in the summer of
  1768, was built round a courtyard planted with fruit-trees and flanked by a
  flower-garden. Here, there was even less of luxury than in the Manor
  house&mdash;the walls were papered, there was a <i>salon</i> in the
  <i>rez-de-chaussée</i>.</p>

  <p>The neighbouring estate of Glatigny, distant seven hundred metres from the
  <i>ferme du Bois</i>, was owned by an elder branch of the family of Corday;
  there had been a lordly house there since the sixth century and the
  <i>château</i> had belonged to the Corday family since 1400. It was a
  handsome building, surrounded by a moat crossed by wooden bridges, built with
  two wings and surmounted by a very high tiled roof, a <i>grande allée</i> led
  to the entrance and another long avenue of poplar trees showed the distant
  spire of Saint-Gervais-les-Sablons. This lonely Manor house had dignity and
  grace; it was furnished with refinement, if not with elegance, but when
  beaten upon by the sea storms of autumn that gave all the trees a landward
  twist, or under the grey skies and heavy rains of winter, it was melancholy
  of aspect.</p>

  <p>The Cordays were beloved for their pure Norman birth, their dignified,
  austere life, their kindness to their dependants. They, like the peasantry,
  languished under the decaying feudal system; there was little to be made from
  the land, but "there was always bread in the <i>château</i>" for those in
  need.</p>

  <p>Nor had their poverty blemished the reputation of these
  <i>gentilhommes</i> in the eyes of their neighbours; a legend that gave them
  royal blood embellished their race; a Mlle. de Chayot, descended from the
  <i>Bailleul</i> (John Balliol, King of Scotland), had married a Corday; she
  claimed the gift of healing the King's evil.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Between these two estates of Mesnil-Imbert and Glatigny and the lands he
  had hired at Ronceray, M. Corday d'Armont passed his time and watched his
  children grow up. Jacqueline-Eleonore was born soon after her sister; she was
  gentle, and either from some congenital defect or from the results of an
  accident, slightly hunch-backed. Though the <i>ferme du Bois</i> was their
  usual lodging, the children were free of the two Manor houses, Glatigny and
  Mesnil-Imbert; the two boys were soon sent to school in order to prepare for
  the sole career that seemed suited to their birth and their poverty; their
  harassed father strained his resources to send them to the <i>Ecole
  Militaire</i>. The two little girls grew up in solitude, knowing only their
  relations, the servants and labourers who toiled about them. At Bois they had
  a little closet lined by a common blue paper; at Mesnil-Imbert, where they
  often stayed, Marie-Anne-Charlotte had a cabinet to herself austerely
  furnished with plain bed, chairs, table and mirror; the walls were not even
  whitewashed but showed rough brick; an oak chest held the child's few
  clothes; close by was a small room fitted up as an oratory, where Madame de
  Corday trained her infant daughters to offer up their prayers at a humble
  altar. The window looked out on an avenue of elms stretching towards a wood,
  and the rude little chamber, austere as a nun's cell, was filled by the
  sounds of the winds that constantly troubled the trees and whistled through
  the uncarpeted, untapestried rooms.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, as they grew older, the children would be taken on holy days to
  Glatigny to enjoy a simple festival, which would be announced by the sound of
  trumpets echoing oddly across the lonely fields. On these rare occasions the
  tired mother, always gracious and well-bred, would find fresh muslin
  kerchiefs for her daughters and ribbons for their hair, and they would dance
  gaily in the <i>salon</i> of the old <i>château</i>, that was handsomely
  adorned by sculptured woodwork. M. de Corday de Cauvigny was very fond of his
  grandchildren, who were also caressed and petted by Marjotte (Fanchon
  Marjot), the faithful servant of the <i>château</i>, and the little girls,
  who had no companions of their own age and no amusements, grew to like life
  better in their grandfather's houses, Glatigny or Mesnil-Imbert, than in the
  pinched, quiet establishment of their parents at the <i>ferme du
  Bois</i>.</p>

  <p>M. de Corday d'Armont was devoted to his frail wife&mdash;their
  neighbours, in the classic taste of the moment, named them Philemon and
  Baucis. No quarrels, no differences of opinion, no humours, disturbed this
  simple home. It was, however, darkened by bitter care, by lack of all
  diversion, by a sense of grievance, at least on the part of the man. He
  resented his lot as third son, the system whereby he had to live like a
  gentleman on a farmer's earnings, his inherited instincts warred with his
  circumstances. He had to toil hard, often holding the plough himself and,
  though he declared agriculture to be the most honourable of callings, he was
  galled by the inability to live like the nobleman he felt himself to be. His
  gloom and his discontent darkened his home and disturbed the expanding
  spirits of his daughters. M. de Corday d'Armont was no philosopher and had
  been educated above his position, or he would have found his Norman life not
  so ill. The real sting of poverty lies with the town dweller or the homeless
  wanderer; this man owned land, a house, had work for every day to his hand,
  dealt directly with the fruits of the earth, had men and animals at his
  command, neighbours to respect him, relations to whom to turn at need, a
  comfortable bed, a warm hearth, a loving wife and blooming children. In
  brief, he could have enjoyed the life of classic dignity then becoming so
  fashionable with many philosophers&mdash;the "back to nature" existence that
  many firmly held would be the salvation of mankind. But M. de Corday was
  neither genial, jovial, nor <i>philosophe</i>; he brought the anxiety of the
  town to the country. The education of his sons meant heavy expense, he lived
  beyond his means and chafed at his inadequacy. In vain he toiled among his
  crops and beasts, in vain his wife laboured to contrive and save in the
  household; there was never enough. Discontent- was in the French air; some of
  the numerous books and pamphlets that voiced the complaints of the
  intellectuals found their way to the Calvados and on to the shelves at
  Mesnil-Imbert, beside the works of Corneille and Plutarch. M. de Corday
  d'Armont read and brooded over the <i>Contrat Social</i>, by J. J. Rousseau,
  the <i>Philosophe des Deux Indes</i>, by the <i>abbé</i> Raynal, and his
  disappointment increased. Not only was everything wrong with France, but he
  was the victim of other men's blunders; he began to inveigh against the
  feudal system to which he felt he had been sacrificed and became more and
  more self-centred and sombre.</p>

  <p>The life that so fretted the father pleased the daughters; monotonous
  though it might appear to townsfolk, it was to the country-bred, lonely
  children, full of interest, even of excitement. They had everything that the
  city dweller misses; the rhythm of nature, blotted out in cities, was clearly
  discernible to them; they marked the four clear seasons, the budding of
  spring, the flowering of summer, the fruitage of autumn, the pause of winter;
  close to the earth, they were familiar with the processes of growth; they saw
  the seed planted from which their food would come. Bread to them was not
  something bought in a shop; they watched the grain ground, the flour mixed,
  the loaves shaped and baked in the great <i>fournil</i>. They gathered the
  fruits that appeared at their simple board on dishes of Norman pottery, they
  helped their mother and the maid make butter and cheese, skim the cream and
  set the milk in wide-mouthed crocks. They roamed unchecked over their own
  land when the hawthorn whitened the hedges and sweetened the air, they rode
  home behind the stout Norman horses bringing in haysel and harvest.</p>

  <p>Their toys were the chestnuts that came sliding through the leaves on the
  old trees near Mesnil-Imbert, the acorns found beneath the oaks in the great
  avenue, the twisted sticks to be picked up after a night of storm, the sedge
  grasses to be found round the Manor house pond.</p>

  <p>The winters were long. When the snow fell the children would help the
  servants sweep it away from the road that connected Glatigny and
  Mesnil-Imbert; when the cold was intense they would slide on the pond, throw
  balls in the bare garden or collect the scarlet berries from the hedges.
  There were other days when there was neither snow, frost, nor storm, but only
  a long greyness of rain and steady wind, and when perhaps for weeks there
  would be no blue sky, no ray of sun, no relief from the soughing of the
  dripping boughs, the whistling of the wind in the chimney corner, the slash
  of the rain-drops on the small windows of the farm-house.</p>

  <p>The little girls were not idle during the leaden, windy weather when the
  mornings were dark and the evenings short; under the guidance of their mother
  they learned to sew, to memorise the prayers in the Psalter, the Holy Hours,
  the beads on the rosary. They drew from her the fervour of a simple faith, as
  from Nature they learned the changeless sequence of the seasons; she taught
  them the manners of gentlefolk and the arts of the housewife; they were
  instructed in the history of France, and in particular that of Normandy and
  the exploits of the House of Corday, which had given a captain to the
  campaigns of Robert Guiscard in Sicily and an officer to the household of the
  Duc de Bourgogne.</p>

  <p>Madame de Corday d'Armont knew all the folk-tales of Normandy, and seated
  by the winter fire burning beneath the huge cowl, related these together with
  legends of the saints and the Virgin.</p>

  <p>The lamps and candles never burnt very long; oil and tallow had to be
  hoarded; in their chill bedrooms, with the rain and wind without, under the
  rough clean sheets and home-spun coverlets, the little girls had many hours
  in which to dream.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The elder child grew robust and beautiful; nourished by pure food, inured
  to the hardships of poverty, she showed, in her fine limbs and well-cut
  features, her healthy gallant race. Her spirits were high, her gaiety almost
  turbulent; she preferred the company of her brothers when they were home on
  holidays to that of her fragile mother and her delicate sister. She liked to
  go with the peasants when they worked in the fields and orchards, her arms
  bare, her neck open, clad in a plain gown of red linen with the masses of
  brilliant, blond hair hanging free on her shoulders. She was not, however,
  rough or rude, her air was well-bred, her manners modest, and though she
  rejoiced so much in the active life of the countryside and possessed a witty
  humour, a fund of laughter and gaiety, she also liked solitude, to muse by
  herself in the shade of some lonely tree at midday, to sit alone by the pond
  and watch the clouds mirrored behind her own face in the water, or to hide
  herself in some remote corner of granary or barn.</p>

  <p>There was much besides Nature with which she could feed her dreams; a desk
  once used by Pierre Corneille was treasured in the Manor house of
  Mesnil-Imbert, and before she could read the antique stories he used as his
  material, they were familiar to her from the lips of her parents. Rome and
  Sparta were words as familiar to her as Calvados and Orne; the heroes and the
  actions of antiquity were woven into the incidents of her daily life to form
  one ineffaceable impression. Hers was the usual experience of the lonely,
  imaginative child&mdash;her dreams, fed by tales and coloured by enthusiasms
  fostered in silence, blended with the familiar round of her material
  existence until the impression of mingled truth and fantasy became
  ineffaceable. The smell of new bread baking in the great ovens, the
  half-sickly perfume of the hawthorn blossom, the aroma of ripe fruit at the
  apple harvest, the scent of burning autumn leaves, of the byre, of the pails
  of fresh milk, were all associated in her mind, and without any sense of
  incongruity, with the martial figures of noble Romans, the severe outlines of
  Spartan heroes.</p>

  <p>Her education did not, as is so often the case, obscure these early dreams
  or half-efface these early tendencies. Her uncle, the <i>abbé</i> Charles
  Amédée de Corday, who was <i>curé</i> of Vicques in the Calvados, was given
  this charge when Marie-Anne-Charlotte outgrew her mother's cares, and he
  developed the child's mind and heart along the lines she had already chosen
  for herself. He taught her to read from the stately lines of Pierre
  Corneille, he encouraged her to admire those antique virtues praised by the
  great dramatist, which she already by instinct cherished. The priest found
  nothing strange in inculcating a passionate acceptance of pagan standards of
  heroism alongside a simple acceptance of Christianity. He was a rich man, of
  high principles, giving much in charity, akin to his pupil in independence
  and loftiness of character. He lived in the house attached to the <i>chapelle
  Saint-Roch</i>, near Vicquette, and often sent his carriage and pair to fetch
  his niece to her lessons. In the dignified austerity of his study, with the
  crucifix on the plain walls, and copies of the classics in worn calf on the
  shelves, he instilled nobility of conduct, fearlessness, grandeur of soul,
  self-sacrifice and exalted piety into the receptive mind of the eager child.
  These ideals suited her nature as glove fits hand; she had to the full that
  glow of generous enthusiasm for greatness not uncommon in extreme youth, but
  which, instead of being fostered is usually overlaid and even destroyed by
  contact with the world. But Mlle. de Corday d'Armont had no one to disturb
  her ingenuous passion r for sublimity and heroism. It was, indeed, encouraged
  by her austere life, the noble outline of her country spread undefaced before
  her, the direct teaching of the unworldly priest, even by the mournful
  complaints of her father lamenting the wrongs that he unjustly suffered.</p>

  <p>The child began to dream of herself as devoted to some great
  self-sacrifice, some splendid abnegation, some tremendous service to a high
  ideal. She mused over heroism as some girls muse over love; she felt in
  herself the pride, the courage, the fortitude necessary to the accomplishment
  of a famous deed. So exactly did the tragedies of Corneille suit her temper,
  that she exclaimed: "I am of the race of the Emilias and the Cinnas!"</p>

  <p>She expanded intellectually with great rapidity; her ideas became early
  set; no one had much influence over her once her mind was decided; the Norman
  independence defended the Norman mysticism with a masculine energy and a
  remarkable eloquence. She early showed that quick irony, that keen sense of
  humour often found with saintliness. Saintliness indeed soon became
  associated with Mlle. de Corday d'Armont; she was named "<i>une sainte
  personne</i>." Her reading of Corneille and Plutarch, her dreams of the
  simple age of heroism, did not interfere with her cheerful and dutiful
  conduct at home. She worked willingly at her household tasks and tended
  affectionately the fast-failing mother who with every month was less able to
  exert her feeble strength.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In 1782, when Marie-Anne-Charlotte was twelve years old, her childhood,
  which had not been without pleasure and gaiety, and which had known a healthy
  freedom and a beautiful background, came to an end. M. de Corday d'Armont,
  with the petulant energy of a weak man forcing his character, brought a
  lawsuit against two of his brothers-in-law. This was a desperate attempt to
  retrieve his fortunes sinking under the expense of the two youths at College.
  The life at Mesnil-Imbert and the <i>ferme du Bois</i> was given up and the
  family removed to Caen. The unhappy father's sole hope was a successful
  termination to his law case.</p>

  <p>He had, indeed, chosen the shadow for the substance; had he decided to
  bring up his sons as farmers his daughters as farmers' wives, he might have
  secured a pleasant, care-free, if humble existence; but he was unable to
  forget his noble birth and so sank deeper into the shifts and humiliations of
  genteel poverty.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Caen, the ancient capital of Calvados and situate on the Orne sixteen
  kilometres from the coast, was a town of sufficient elegance and culture to
  be named the Norman Athens. There was a University, several splendid
  churches, abbeys and convents, many learned societies, and the handsome
  streets were lined by the <i>hôtels</i> of the Norman nobility; it was also a
  garrison town. These proud and reserved people, rigid with the prejudices of
  their classes, lived among themselves and gave to the old town a sad and dull
  air. Most of the <i>hôtels</i> had black marble slabs at the doors which bore
  the names of aristocratic owners, too proud to live on their estates, too
  insignificant to venture to Paris, rich enough, from the labours of the
  peasantry, to live in luxury that bred idle men and insolent women. Between
  this class and that of the despised and servile <i>bourgeoisie</i> were the
  money-lenders, the bankers, all the dealers in finance who sucked the blood
  of <i>la haute noblesse</i>, as they sucked that of the peasantry. The
  <i>château</i> of William the Conqueror and the numerous massive churches of
  Norman architecture connected this town of select provincial snobbery with a
  bold and stormy past, while several houses with carved and sculptured wooden
  façades bore witness to the fantastic and opulent taste of the Renaissance.
  The fine and sober beauty of the bell-tower of Saint Pierre, of the
  thirteenth century, gave distinction to the sombre outline of the town. M. de
  Corday d'Armont had nothing to do with the haughty and wealthy society of
  Caen to which by birth he belonged; he rented a small house of the humblest
  description at the <i>Buttes de Saint-Gilles</i>, near the famous
  <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i> or <i>de la Trinité</i> and the ancient church of
  <i>Saint-Gilles</i> situate on the limits of the town on the south-east.</p>

  <p>The <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, a magnificent building in the Romanesque
  style, was founded by Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror, in expiation of
  the irregularity of her marriage; in repentance for the same fault her
  husband had raised at Caen the <i>abbaye-aux-hommes</i> and the church of
  <i>Saint-Etienne</i>. The work of the pious Queen had been damaged in the
  Hundred Years' War and restored in the reign of Louis XIV, but the heavy and
  impressive towers, the magnificent porch, the graceful <i>clocher</i>,
  retained their pristine aspect of sombre splendour. The body of Matilda still
  rested under the marble slab in the choir where it had been placed in 1083,
  and the black-robed nuns with the white band and gimp of the order of
  <i>Saint Benoît</i> still moved in dignified peace through the cloisters. One
  portion of the <i>abbaye</i> had been reconstructed in 1704 and served as a
  <i>hôtel-Dieu</i>; beyond was the old convent park which contained a
  labyrinth or maze of horn-beam hedges; in the centre of this was a hillock
  that commanded an excellent view of Caen. An <i>allée</i> of elms shaded the
  walls of the <i>abbaye</i>, so that although the life was confined and dull
  compared to that of Mesnil-Imbert, the poor home of M. de Corday d'Armont was
  situate in a position ennobled by the grandeur of the convent and made
  pleasant by the park and trees. <i>Saint-Gilles</i> was another ancient
  building that adorned the neighbourhood; it was a humble church, old,
  neglected, which served the poor people; bread was given away every Sunday
  morning after Mass.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The family of de Corday d'Armont had few friends in Caen and their poverty
  was more keenly felt in the proud town than it had been on their own lands.
  No longer could Marie-Anne-Charlotte run free in her gown of red linen; she
  and her sister had to sew at little caps, kerchiefs and aprons for themselves
  in order that they might make a decent appearance; the toils of Madame de
  Corday d'Armont increased with the melancholy of her husband. No dissension
  added to their burden; complete love and confidence existed between the
  parents and their two children; the father, with Norman frugality, would
  place his slender resources in a drawer accessible to all, often portioning
  them out, in the presence of his children, for the necessaries of life.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont lost much of her gaiety and high spirits. She
  devoted herself with almost fanatic enthusiasm to her domestic duties; this
  child of fourteen was already inclined to extremes&mdash;all she did must be
  done passionately, pushed to its limits. Her manner was grave and severe; she
  disclosed herself to none and the hard reality of her life did not Interrupt
  her dreams. She was still surrounded by beauty; if she could no longer muse
  by the pond in the home field or in the shade of the old chestnut trees, she
  could sit under the rich shadow of the arcades of the Roman nave of the
  <i>abbaye</i>, watched by the grimacing masks in the capitals of the columns
  (which seemed to peep from their world of fantasy at the strange child wrapt
  in her visions) or worship in the fine Gothic chapel, in the transept, in the
  holy, lamp-lit gloom.</p>

  <p>She was free of the old park and the maze, of the peaceful <i>allée</i> of
  elms; she could hear the singing of the choirs, the praises of the nuns, the
  sombre harmonies of the organ, and, when venturing with her mother down the
  elegant streets, she could hear from window or garden the sound of clavecin
  or lute, violin or harp, playing the melodies of Haydn or Mozart, Gluck or
  Lully. Often her uncle, the good <i>abbé</i>, came over to Caen to examine
  her in her studies. There was also, for the thoughtful and watchful child,
  curious aspects of the great world to be noted in Caen, people and things she
  had never seen before; the smart officers, powdered and frizzed, the young
  students, the old professors in robe and gown, the inns where travellers
  stayed, the shops that showed Parisian novelties, the fashionably dressed
  women in their carriages with their lackeys and lap-dogs. Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont noted this modern life as she saw it from the outside and shrank the
  deeper into her dreams and pored the longer over her tales of antique
  heroism.</p>

  <p>Books, pamphlets, newspapers were more easily available in Caen than they
  had been in Mesnil-Imbert. The young girl heard her father discussing the
  faults and troubles of the government, the suggested remedies of the
  intellectuals; his own bitterness coloured his comments on the state of the
  country.</p>

  <p>In 1774, when Marie-Anne-Charlotte was enjoying her gay infancy, the age
  of cynical frivolity had come to an end with the death of Louis XV, who had
  said: "Bah, the crazy old machine will last my time, and who comes after must
  take care of himself." His successor, Louis XVI, blundered forward, like a
  man who has given the reins to fate; his ministers, Maurepas, Malesherbes,
  Turgot, set themselves to make the best of the disordered finances of a
  country without a constitution.</p>

  <p>M. de Corday d'Armont discussed with avidity the proposals of the
  government to abolish monopolies, introduce free trade and land taxes; he
  keenly noted their failure before the opposition of clergy and nobility, and
  the rise of Necker, a Swiss banker, to be chief minister&mdash;Necker, a
  commoner and a Protestant, detested by all but the lower classes, whose
  reforms raised a clamour throughout France. The poor Norman
  <i>gentilhomme</i> also read many of the republican and atheistical books
  then flooding the country. The axioms of Locke and Montesquieu filtering
  through J. J. Rousseau, the materialism of Condillac and Helvetius, the
  infidel opinions of Voltaire, the new and startling Republic founded in North
  America, all the catchwords of the <i>philosophes</i> and the
  half-unintelligible jargon of their followers were discussed in the poor home
  in the shade of the ancient <i>abbaye</i> which seemed to stand as a
  permanent memorial of a changeless faith and an unshakable government.</p>

  <p>The fall of the Necker ministry and the reactionary policy of M. de
  Calonne, with his vast loans raised to conciliate the Queen, the Princes and
  the nobility, filled M. de Corday d'Armont with mingled excitement and
  apprehension. Where was he, poor overburdened gentleman, to find his count in
  all this confusion? He had no fixed political ideas, he only knew that there
  was something very wrong with a condition of affairs that kept a man of his
  blood and rank in poverty.</p>

  <p>His eldest daughter marked his bitter comments, his weak complaints, and
  she searched the writings of the <i>philosophes</i> for an answer to these
  puzzles of mankind's rights and wrongs.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A more personal grief soon clouded the Norman gentleman's vexation with
  his affairs; his wife failed rapidly in health and he was unable to procure
  for her the assistance he wished. The illness of the mother, the anguish of
  the father, strongly affected the elder daughter; she was not aware what was
  the burden under which her mother was sinking, but she saw, clearly enough, a
  human tragedy evolving in her poor home. Her fortitude was remarkable; she
  deliberately trained herself to endure suffering in silence. One of her few
  friends, Mlle. de Loyer, once met her dragging herself along the walls by the
  <i>abbaye</i>, her face covered with blood, half-fainting from pain and
  shock. She had fallen in leaving the church, but refused to admit that she
  was hurt and smiled at her frightened mother, who exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Ah, this poor child is too hard on herself! She never complains and I
  have to guess when she is ill&mdash;she never tells me!"</p>

  <p>This friend noted that the grave child was "<i>douce, calme, douée dune
  raison au-dessus de son âge</i>"&mdash;industrious and thoughtful, also
  "<i>une jeune personne accomplie</i>."</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont soon had need of all her precocious energy. Birth
  and death met in the humble house, darkened by privation; Madame de Corday
  d'Armont died in giving to the world a third daughter who soon followed her
  to the grave. In this home, too modest even for the decencies of life to be
  observed, the child saw, at first hand, the rituals of the entering and
  leaving of life, the hustle of the midwife, the solemnity of the undertaker,
  the cradle and the <i>pompes funèbres</i> in one sad scene. She saw her
  mother's face, hollowed by anxiety and fatigue, stiffen into rigidity; she
  heard the plaints of the new-born infant fading into perpetual silence; she
  observed the useless, the almost guilty grief of the father, humiliated by
  his poverty. Her shy, half-aware maidenhood was shocked; she withdrew her
  secret soul even further into those sanctuaries inhabited by her phantom
  heroes and heroines.</p>

  <p>The little household had been dealt a shattering blow; grief and gloom
  descended darkly on the widowed father, on the little girls in their cheap
  black gowns; the vague revolt of the man against his destiny was heightened
  by his loss; the gravity of the children Increased as they realised their
  unfortunate portion, their disasters and their helplessness. The elder was
  true to her ideals, she tried to be a mother to the delicate
  Jacqueline-Eléonore, a housekeeper to her father. She undertook, with
  sweetness and energy, the most menial tasks, filling not only the place of
  the dead mother, but of the servant they could not afford.</p>

  <p>M. de Corday d'Armont was baffled; his lawsuit dragged on, his lands
  brought him a poor return, his heavy expenses continued. And in the
  background was France, putting a thousand questions to herself as she awoke,
  with convulsive heavings, from what seemed centuries of sleep. Before his
  poor hearth, with his helpless little girls beside him, the unhappy man pored
  over those specimens of the infidel and democratic writings that came his
  way; was there any help for him in the teachings of the intellectuals, the
  rebels, the <i>philosophes?</i></p>
  <hr>

  <p>Until the eighteenth century the governments of peoples were almost
  entirely decided by powerful men of action, or by able intriguers. When force
  ruled and ignorance obeyed, the role of theorist was useless and dangerous,
  nor was the power of the press sufficient to make it worth while to endeavour
  to influence opinion through books. With the weakening of tyrannies, with the
  fading of superstition and the spread of the printing press, with a rapidly
  growing discontent and wonder as to this and that among all classes, came the
  men-of-letters, the self-styled philosophers who began to focus and voice the
  popular grievances, to question institutions sacred and quasi-sacred, to
  criticise the privileged classes and to compassionate the serf, the peasant,
  the little townsmen. What, asked these bold speculators, is the best form of
  government? What is the nature of the contract between ruler and people? What
  concern has the church with the state, or either with ethics or a man's
  private conscience? How can the rapacity of the clergy and the nobility,
  their exemption from taxation, their idle lives, be justified? Of what use
  are the laws that leave a large portion of the nation in a state of hopeless
  misery?</p>

  <p>These and other questions, equally pertinent, equally disturbing, at first
  severely censured, gradually spreading, began to occupy all thinking men in
  France. Voltaire and d'Alembert, Condillac, Fontenelle, Diderot, all the
  authors of the Encyclopaedia, Montesquieu with his famous <i>Esprit des
  Lois</i>, all had, despite the efforts of outraged authority, a considerable
  vogue among all classes. These writers were none of them men of action. As
  soldiers, as politicians, as administrators or organisers of any kind they
  would have been failures. They lacked all experience of public affairs, many
  of their theories were vague, unworkable, the whims of amateurs. But they
  possessed the perilous gift of powerful, vivid pens, the very least of them
  were accomplished journalists. They saw the palpable injustices, cruelties,
  hypocrisies, follies of the social and religious systems under which they
  lived, and they pointed them out with every resource of literary art. Who
  would fail to be impressed by an obvious truth, presented with eloquence,
  fire and wit? The man who voices a general grievance is sure of a wide
  hearing from those made inarticulate by weakness. The French people whom the
  <i>philosophes</i> addressed were no worse off than their ancestors of a
  hundred years before; but when they found indignant complaints in the air
  they were ready to applaud vigorously and to bring out their personal
  grievances.</p>

  <p>These men-of-letters were mostly republican and infidel. They suggested a
  sweeping away of decaying institutions, the Church, the Monarchy, the Feudal
  system, the privileges of clerics and nobles. They were not so ready with
  practical, constructive criticism; their ideals appeared to be the dim
  Republics of Greece and Rome, the England of Locke, Sydney, Cromwell, and
  later, the United States of Benjamin Franklin and Washington. The consequence
  of these brilliant discontents, these paper reforms, founded on such genuine
  wrongs, was that the public became agitated by a thousand glittering
  prospects without knowing how to put one into practice.</p>

  <p>Most beloved, most dangerous, and most gifted of the writers who
  fascinated, alarmed and roused France, was Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He had died
  ten years before the de Corday d'Armont family came to Caen, but his writings
  were only beginning to filter from the intellectuals to the people, with whom
  they were to enjoy for so long a sensational popularity and to have an
  unprecedented influence.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to proceed with the study of the development of Mlle. de
  Corday d'Armont without briefly considering J. J. Rousseau, who together with
  the <i>abbé</i> Raynal, Pierre Corneille, the Old Testament and Plutarch, was
  her guide in her extraordinary career.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>This son of the Swiss watchmaker was one of the most remarkable men of a
  remarkable age; he stood at the source of many modern tendencies and it is
  often disputed whether or no he still has influence on modern thought. At
  least, even if the works that once sent a nation frantic are rarely read save
  for academic purposes, many of his ideas which seemed so original and
  startling to his contemporaries have been incorporated in present schools of
  thought. Not only were these ideas in themselves seductive, but J. J.
  Rousseau possessed the immense advantage of being able to clothe them in
  clear, attractive and passionate language. His novel, <i>Julie, ou la
  nouvelle Héloïse</i>, was eminently successful in conveying that luscious
  romantic atmosphere, half-sensuous, half-sentimental, that enables the
  sensitive, refined reader to indulge in highly-coloured, amorous emotionalism
  under the guise of a tribute to virtue. J. J. Rousseau had caught the trick
  from Richardson; the lachrymose story of Julie, like the mournful tale of
  Clarissa Harlowe, owed its frenzied popularity to the adroit handling of the
  sex element. Thousands of women, when reading these tempting pages, saw
  themselves pursued, besieged, languished over, captured while preserving all
  the flattering bloom of chastity.</p>

  <p>No less popular was <i>Emile</i>, where a new theory of education was
  expounded with a grace and fervour which started a fashion that lasted for
  years; while the <i>Social Contract</i> owed much of its immense influence to
  the fact that it contained ideas and theories that people of the most diverse
  opinions could applaud. J. J. Rousseau was a theorist, a failure in all his
  personal relationships, ill from birth with a most distressing complaint that
  drove him out of society, and ended in partial insanity and persecution
  mania, an hysterical neurotic, and in the early part of his life at least, a
  vagabond and a scoundrel. He yet was able, in the few books he left behind,
  to influence most profoundly a whole generation and to leave his name as a
  challenge and an authority on the lips of numberless men of various beliefs
  who had very little idea of what the famous philosopher had written and no
  clear conception of his theories or ideals. J. J. Rousseau's philosophy was
  indeed difficult to define; many of his doctrines were not original, he was a
  disciple of Montesquieu and owed much to Locke; he himself admitted that he
  could see separate truths, but could not combine them into a satisfactory
  whole. He was timid, anti-revolutionary, prepared to accept Monarchy; many of
  his famous <i>dicta</i>, such as "<i>L'homme est né libre, et partout il est
  dans les fers</i>," which became a catch-phrase, are manifestly false, and
  his persistent sentimentalism, so sharply in contrast with the outlook of his
  predecessors, Voltaire, Condillac, Fontenelle, enervated all he wrote and
  tainted all he taught.</p>

  <p>To what then did he owe his unparalleled popularity, the vast numbers of
  his enthusiastic disciples? First, perhaps, to his complete sincerity. Though
  Rousseau largely lived in a self-created world as far as his own personal
  relationships were concerned, while even many of the statements in
  <i>Confessions</i> are suspect, and he could be deceived to the point of
  hallucination (as in the affair with David Hume), yet in his attitude towards
  society he was able to detach himself completely, to see the condition of
  mankind with brilliant clarity and to comment on it with passionate
  sincerity. Rousseau had none of the rather superficial cynicism, the classic
  calm, the neat irony of the <i>philosophes</i>; humanity to him was not a
  matter for witty comment, hardly for moral indignation, but for tears.</p>

  <p>This manifest sincerity had a universal appeal; none of Rousseau's
  readers, whatever his or her intelligence or circumstances, could fear that
  he was writing for effect, for fame, for money, or indeed otherwise than from
  his heart. Rousseau was also a visionary and an idealist, and these qualities
  strike in a most powerful fashion to the secret depths of all sensitive,
  suffering, or discontented hearts. Though he confessed, himself, to a certain
  inability to put together all the diverse theories he evolved so as to form a
  complete scheme for the betterment of mankind, yet he was no dreamy builder
  of fanciful Utopias. In the <i>Contrat Social</i> he suggested reforms,
  pointed out defects in existing institutions, and advised remedies with
  convincing clarity and judgment; in the <i>Pologne</i> he drew up an
  elaborate and detailed scheme for the working of a model state. It was easy
  for his readers to believe that it was possible to put into practice all
  these ideas in the new states being organised in Europe, and in the New
  World, notably in North America. There was nothing in Rousseau's doctrines to
  shock the orderly, the decent, the timid. He foresaw and dreaded a revolution
  in France; he was neither an anarchist nor an infidel; he advocated nothing
  violent, and that safe compromise between a democracy and tyranny, the
  constitutional Monarchy was, in the <i>Contrat Social</i>, his choice of
  government. But doubtless his strongest appeal, the main cause of his great
  popularity, was his direct attack upon the warmest sentiments of the heart.
  He believed in the moral law, the essential goodness of mankind; that is, he
  argued that a universal happiness might be obtained by basing the law, the
  linch-pin of the State, upon morality and goodness&mdash;these being defined
  according to Christian ethics. Coincident with this principle ran that of
  "back to nature." Rousseau himself said, with some peevishness, that this was
  not to be interpreted as meaning a life in a desert or a wilderness, or a
  casting aside of all the advantages of civilisation. It meant, rather, a
  protest against the evil influences of cities, the corruption of courts and
  bourses, an escape from the endless complications of intrigues for place,
  power and money, the meannesses, vices, despairs and disasters inseparable
  from a competitive struggle for existence. Rousseau thought that the greatest
  happiness for mankind lay in family life, in close contact with the earth, in
  simplicity of manners, in modest desires, in rural surroundings.</p>

  <p>This was a startling doctrine for eighteenth-century France. For
  generations the land had been despised, worked by the lowest class, who were
  treated virtually as slaves, while the middle classes crowded into commerce
  and the nobility clustered round the King, abandoning their estates for the
  cities, where they intrigued to obtain some State-paid position. Only here
  and there did a gentleman live on his land, and usually then, like M. de
  Corday d'Armont, he regarded his lot with bitterness and struggled to get his
  sons away from the earth that had bred them.</p>

  <p>"Back to nature" became, in theory at least, increasingly popular in the
  years following the death of Rousseau (1778). Everyone could understand it;
  with equal poignancy it appealed to the failures, the poverty-stricken, the
  idealists, the lonely and the fanciful. Here was none of the difficulty and
  dryness of philosophy or economics or politics&mdash;all was reduced to the
  simple terms of family life; the nerve of the State was to be found not in
  Kings, nobles or parliaments, but on the humble hearths of the people. It
  seemed of such a seductive simplicity, this picture of domestic bliss founded
  on virtue, where all was tender and noble, where the general goodness of man
  triumphed over all obstacles, where the children ran free, lived austerely
  and grew up full of kindness and compassion, where the father looked after
  the land, the mother after the house, and all was reduced to such simplicity
  that no difficulties could arise. The country responded to the sentimental
  appeal, to the idealism, the apparent common sense. Rousseau roused a need
  for tenderness, a longing for domestic joys, for virtuous and languishing
  love, for self-sacrifice. He stirred a nostalgia for the land, not for the
  land of the park and the garden, the hunt and the <i>fête champêtre</i>, but
  for the land of the field and the orchard, the farm and the cottage, the
  seed-time and harvest. Added to the attractiveness of his matter was the
  charm of Rousseau's style; he wrote a vigorous and limpid French, ardent and
  persuasive. The flaws in his ideas, the faults in his proposals were
  manifest; even his famous "Man is born free, and is everywhere in chains,"
  which has such an air of startling truth, may be disputed on the ground that
  man is not born free, he is born helpless. And it is obvious that a national
  life of classic dignity and simplicity, occupied in tending the kindly fruits
  of the earth, would not have been possible in eighteenth-century Europe.
  Rousseau indeed recognised, almost in despair, the difficulties of national
  reformation. In 1772 he had written, almost as his last words, "<i>Il n'y a
  que Dieu qui puisse gouverner le monde, et it faudrait des facultés plus
  qu'humaines pour gouverner des grandes nations." (Pologne.)</i></p>

  <p>He placed his faith, as all reformers must, in the children, in education.
  He regarded the child (and this seemed an enticing novelty), not as a mere
  reflex of the parent, but as a powerful and individual force. Starting from
  Plato's principle that the complete life is only possible in a social
  organisation arranged to make goodness paramount, he saw in the child the
  germ of the future realisation of this ideal. The child was to be taught to
  live a natural life&mdash;i.e., one in which all the natural instincts of
  goodness found full scope, and to take his part in a society which existed
  solely to co-ordinate and protect these moral principles; the child, too,
  should early understand patriotism in its widest sense.</p>

  <p><i>"C'est l'éducation qui doit donner aux times la forme nationale, et
  diriger tellement leurs opinions et leurs gouts, qu'elles soient patriotes
  par inclination, par passion, par nécessité. Un enfant en ouvrant les yeux
  doit voir la patrie, et jusqu' a la mort ne doit plus voir qu' elle. Tout
  vrai républicain suça avec le lait de sa mère l'amour de sa patrie, c'
  est-a-dire des lois et de la liberté." (Pologne.)</i></p>

  <p>Rousseau himself was aware that much of what he taught was vague, or
  impracticable, or visionary; he even, in his deep sincerity, thought
  sometimes that it might be false. "<i>Peut-être tout ceci n'est-il qu'un tas
  de chimères; mais voila mes idées. Ce n'est pas ma faute si elles ressemblent
  si peu a celles des autres hommes, et it n'a pas défendu de moi d'organiser
  ma tête d'une autre facon." (Ibid.)</i></p>

  <p>Chimeras or no, the ideas of Rousseau gradually spreading from the
  intellectuals to the main body of the reading public, were accepted by many
  who did not understand more than their superficial meaning. Rousseau's
  romanticism and sentimentality appealed to thousands who cared nothing for
  the moral law or the goodness of man, numberless young women saw themselves
  as Julie and their lovers as Saint-Preux, numberless ardent reformers and
  patriots saw themselves overturning the existing order of things in order to
  carry out Rousseau's ideas on the ruins, numberless mothers and governesses
  educated their charges in the manner of <i>Emile</i>. Some nobles took
  Rousseau seriously and pondered over his dicta, far more made him the
  plaything of the moment; tears and hermitages, plank beds, the following of a
  trade, and a lachrymose concern for "the lowest classes" became as
  fashionable as the <i>pantin</i> dolls or the untwisting of braid had been a
  few years previously. Indeed, every class, every individual, could find in
  the seductive pages of Rousseau something new, something attractive,
  something to discuss or to copy. On some natures the ideas of Rousseau acted
  like a madness, working them up to a frenzy of enthusiasm, blinding them with
  sublime ideals, dissolving them in tears of tenderness and compassion. The
  name of the Genevan was on the lips of many self-named disciples whose
  conduct he would have abhorred; it was used as a rallying cry by parties he
  would have completely repudiated; his theories became twisted, his meaning
  misunderstood, his ideals ignored by those who professed to be his ardent
  followers. Folly, stupidity, hysteria, the falsity of sentimentality, all
  advanced themselves with his name. But here and there some sincere and noble
  soul accepted Rousseau on the terms of sincerity and nobility, rejected
  Julie, and brooded, without morbidity or egotism, on <i>Pologne</i> and the
  <i>Contrat Social</i>. These thinking people perceived that much was wrong
  with the condition of France. The <i>philosophes</i> had opened the eyes of
  the sensible middle classes to cruelty, injustice, unequal distribution of
  wealth and taxes, the hypocrisy of the Church, the tyranny of the nobles, the
  anachronism of the feudal system. Might not the remedy be found in the pages
  of J. J. Rousseau? It must be remembered, to the credit of those
  serious-minded people who were dazzled by this extraordinary man, that he was
  a brilliant genius, and in much, a prophet.</p>

  <p>Amiel (writing in 1877) found him "<i>un ancêtre en tout</i>," in romantic
  reverie, where he inspired Chateaubriand, in rustic rambles where he led
  Töpffer, in literary botany before George Sand, in the cult of nature
  enlarged upon by Saint-Pierre, in the theory of democracy before the
  Revolution of 1789. In politics and theology he was the leader of Mirabeau
  and Renan, in teaching he inspired Pestalozzi, and in the description of
  Alpine scenery, Saussure; he made music and "confessions" fashionable and
  created a new French style: "<i>en somme on peut dire que rien de Rousseau ne
  s'est perdu et que personne n'a influé plus que lui, sur la Révolution
  Française...et sur le XIXe siècle."</i></p>

  <p>Amiel, then, found J. J. Rousseau at the source of many modern
  tendencies&mdash;from ethics to country walks. George Sand paid an earlier
  tribute: <i>"Il m'a transmis, comme à tous les artistes de mon temps, l'amour
  de la nature, l'enthousiasme du vrai, le mépris de la vie factice et le
  dégoût des vanités du monde."</i></p>

  <p>H. Taine (writing in 1876), who disliked Rousseau, admits the
  attractiveness of his <i>"sensibilité délicate et profonde, l'humanité,
  l'attendrissement, le don des larmes, la faculté d'aimer, la passion de la
  justice, le sentiment religieux, l'enthousiasme."</i></p>

  <p>It is easy to understand that to oppressed, refined, sensitive and noble
  souls, bewildered by what they saw around them, uneasy as to the future and
  longing to be of service to humanity, the works of such a writer would be as
  a Bible, second only to Plutarch's <i>De viris illustribus</i>, which seemed
  to relate the deeds of the heroes of that vanished world which had provided
  the basis for much of the Genevan's inspiration.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In 1782, while in Paris, Madame de Genlis was bringing up the children of
  the <i>duc</i> d'Orléans according to <i>Emile</i>, Mlle. de Corday d'Armont
  was beginning, in her sad poverty at Caen, to read the exciting and enticing
  works of J. J. Rousseau, which exactly suited her expanding mind, already
  formed by the heroics of Corneille.</p>

  <p>The harassed father, to whom the necessity of finding the daily bread made
  all philosophy vain, soon returned with his daughters to Mesnil-Imbert, while
  he tried to place the eldest in the establishment for impoverished
  gentlewomen endowed by Madame de Maintenon at Saint-Cyr.</p>

  <p>The little housewife, with her head full of Corneille, Rousseau and
  Plutarch, did not fail in childish tenderness to "papa" on his birthday; when
  she had no means with which to buy a present, she wrote a little verse:</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Souffrez, tendre papa, que mon zèle devance,<br>
  L'âge oil l'on ne connaît ni rime, ni raison,<br>
  J'ai pour bouquet mon coeur, que pent de plus l'enfance?<br>
  Le présent quand on s' aime est toujours de saison.'<br>
  Je suis avec tout le respectueux et sincère attachement,<br>
  <br>
  "Marie-Anne-Charlotte."</p>

  <p>The placid, melancholy Norman fields did not look so fair to the young
  girl as before she had left them to go to Caen. Her laugh was no longer so
  frequent, nor so joyous; she did not run so freely over the fields or muse so
  long beside the resting water. This was not only because she was grieving for
  her mother and had the cares of the little household on her shoulders; it was
  because her eyes were opened to much that she had not noticed in her gay
  childhood, the peasantry working like beasts without reward or hope, the
  struggle to pay the taxes to Church and noble, the <i>dîme</i>, the
  <i>gabelle</i>, the misery of the <i>corvée</i>, the long labour with rude
  implements to make the earth yield a living, the stark poverty of the
  labourer's hut, the shifts of the small gentry's dwelling, her own family's
  grim effort to maintain caste in face of penury&mdash;all these things passed
  into the soul of the girl. She knew now where the money went that was wrung
  from a soil too often watered by tears&mdash;to support the idle men, the
  insolent women, the fat tradesmen, the pampered lackeys whom she had seen in
  Caen.</p>

  <p>Melancholy and indignation coloured her childish musings, but her Norman
  firmness kept her resigned, silent, even cheerful.</p>

  <p>However many political pamphlets M. de Corday d'Armont had read, however
  little he believed in the stability of the government he despised, he was as
  eager to attach his children to ancient institutions as if he believed that
  these would last for ever. Every sacrifice had been made to place the sons in
  the army; then the daughters must be taken under the wing of the Church.</p>

  <p>The application to Saint-Cyr failed. The father used his only weapon, the
  influence of his rank and connections, and solicited for his girls the
  advantage of an education at the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>.</p>

  <p>Their aunt, Madame de Louvagny, was a nun in this establishment; she put
  the case of the two noble and desolate young girls before her friend, the
  Abbess of the Convent, Madame de Belzunce. She was aided in her petition by
  another nun, Madame de Pontécoulant, and by particular favour, the
  demoiselles de Corday d'Armont were accepted on the foundation of Queen
  Matilda, which allowed maintenance and education to five young girls of high
  birth but impoverished means.</p>

  <p>Thus, at the age of fourteen, Mlle. de Corday d'Armont, with her younger
  sister Eléonore, entered the magnificent, rigid and sombre <i>abbaye</i> as a
  <i>pensionnaire</i>. This made an abrupt break with her former life; the
  existence of the rustic infant, the anxious little housewife, the earnest
  pupil of the uncle priest, had come to an end.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>TWO. LADIES IN SECLUSION</h2>

  <p class="quote">"Sitôt que les hommes vivent en société il leur faut une
  religion qui les y maintienne. Jamais peuple n'a subsisté, ni ne subsistera
  sans religion." &mdash;J. J. Rousseau, <i>Du Contrat Social</i>, 1772.<br>
  <br>
  "En général, dans le commencement des sociétés, les femmes sont les premières
  a se policier. Leur faiblesse même, et leur vie sédentaire, plus occupée de
  détails variés et de petits soins, leur donnent plutôt ces lumières et cette
  expérience, ces attachements domestiques qui font les premiere instruments et
  les liens les plus forts de la sociabilité. Soit que l'ascendant de ce sexe
  tienne a sa beauté, ou que ce soit un effet particulier de sexe tienne a
  beauté, ou que ce soit un effet particulier de son assiduité au travail et de
  son intelligence pour les affaires."<br>
  &mdash;L'abbé Raynal. <i>Tome II, Histoire des Indes, 1780.</i></p>
  <hr style="width:25%">
  <br>

  <p class="first">The stately establishment of <i>l'abbaye aux dames</i> was
  conducted with saintly decency and admirable order; no gossip or scandal had
  ever attached to the band of devoted women who kept alive the piety of
  William the Conqueror's wife. They lived in community, but were not an
  enclosed order; they took some pupils and they interested themselves in works
  of charity. The dignified air and well-bred grace of the convent were
  exemplified by the noble Abbess, Cécile-Genevieve-Emilie de Belzunce de
  Castelmoran. This lady, then twenty-eight years of age, imposing and delicate
  in appearance, with large blue eyes, a smiling mouth and long fine hands,
  undertook to direct the education of the two motherless girls. Beneath her
  gentle air she was pious, ascetic and severe; her family were aristocratic,
  her nephew Henry [<i>sic</i>], Vicomte de Belzunce, was afterwards in
  garrison at Caen, major in the <i>régiment du Bourbon infanterie.</i></p>

  <p>Under the guidance of this noble lady the education of Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont continued; she was trained on the lines that had been for long laid
  down as suitable for gentlewomen, in all the grave and elaborate ritual of
  her faith, in charitable duties to the poor and the sick, in music, drawing,
  fine needlework, lace-making. As well as these definite accomplishments the
  nuns taught those intangible arts and graces that composed, in their opinion,
  good breeding. The girl, used to poverty and hard work, who had already from
  her parents learned a gentlewoman's bearing, now was trained in deportment,
  courtesy, suppleness in her approach to life, a grasp of the technique of
  living, the <i>finesse</i> of behaviour. If the nuns were aware of any of the
  signs of the times or understood the epoch in which they lived, they gave no
  sign of it; they prayed, taught, and went round with their doles of bread and
  soup as if they were still living in the age of William and Matilda.</p>

  <p>The pupils of the <i>abbaye</i> were, at this period, four: the two de
  Corday girls, Mlle. Alexandrine de Forbin and Mlle. de Récorbin. They wore
  dark blue habits like those of novices, had to obey without discussion, to
  lead a severe life without excitement and amusement, and to help the nuns in
  their charitable labours. Mlle. de Forbin was <i>dévote</i>; she was destined
  to a religious life; her sister Julienne was an Ursuline, her two brothers
  were in the army. She came of a noble, half-ruined family of Avignon and was
  related to the Abbess and the Bishop of Marseilles; this Comtesse Alexandrine
  was the chosen friend of Mlle. de Corday d'Armont.</p>

  <p>Among other nuances of conduct taught by the nuns was pride of birth; the
  four girls understood that they were of the nobility; the two de Corday
  d'Armont girls who had lived almost like peasants in Mesnil-Imbert, learned
  that it was of importance to be a de Corday, to have a long pedigree and a
  coat-of-arms. The four young ladies lived in a perfect accord; their amiable
  behaviour sprang from goodness of heart, intelligence and fine training, so
  that no ill-humour, temper, jealousy or spite marred their intercourse.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The most brilliant and the most difficult of the pupils was
  Marie-Anne-Charlotte; docile and sweet as was her disposition, she found it
  hard to submit to the severe rules of the convent. The liveliness eclipsed by
  her mother's death returned&mdash;she had a quick wit, an ironic turn not
  always acceptable to the nuns. Her aunt and teacher, Madame de Louvagny, had
  often to struggle with her on questions that arose during the lessons. The
  girl had an intense mental activity; she could take nothing on
  trust&mdash;all must be argued and proved. Nor could she resign, on any
  count, her own convictions. On the contrary, she would defend them with fire
  and force, taking them always to extremes. The Abbess was alarmed at this
  independence of spirit, which the girl carried so far as to argue with her
  Confessor. But as her ideals were all lofty, her instincts all noble, no one
  was prepared to punish her for the exaltation and enthusiasm with which she
  pressed her points, or the lively intelligence with which she examined dogmas
  and traditions. Then her conduct was excellent, her charm of person and of
  manner so compelling, her piety so warm and orthodox. The <i>abbé</i> Boulay,
  the confessor to the young girls, found Mlle. de Corday d'Armont what those
  who had watched her childhood had found her to be: "<i>Une sainte
  personne</i>."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The young Norman believed in the Church whose rites she so piously
  followed; there was nothing of the atheist or the heretic in her disposition,
  which was raised above all these differences and restrictions. She was a
  mystic.</p>

  <p>She had brought her Plutarch, her Corneille into the convent; her reading
  was not unduly limited, she was allowed to mingle the exploits of the ancient
  heroes with the lives of the Saints. Owing to her high character she was
  permitted, as she grew older, to read J. J. Rousseau (not the romances) and
  that strange work which affected her so powerfully, the <i>Histoire
  Philosophe des deux Indes</i> by the <i>abbé</i> Raynal. Plutarch's
  <i>Lives</i>, which might at this period be termed the intellectuals'
  handbook, was often between her fingers and always in her mind.</p>

  <p>Like many lofty minded women she was delighted in creating something with
  her hands and took a great pleasure in needlework; she drew her own
  embroidery designs and was an exquisite lace-maker; she learned to play the
  clavecin excellently. In her own language she was not accomplished; although
  she read so much she always spelled incorrectly and made many childish
  mistakes in putting her sentences together.</p>

  <p>Her physical gifts were as abundant as her mental endowments; she
  developed into "<i>un vrai soleil</i>"&mdash;her charm was enhanced by her
  touching modesty, her complete unself-consciousness; she enjoyed a brilliant
  health which gave her a serenity, a poise and a cheerful common sense that
  would have been impossible to the feeble, the nervous or the hysterical. Her
  voice, low and warm, was extremely beautiful and could hardly be heard
  without emotion.</p>

  <p>Her serenity of mind rose from her perfect spiritual, as well as her
  perfect physical, adjustment; she had the mystic's supreme happiness of
  feeling at one with God. This conviction of union with the Divine gave her
  the confidence that some mistook for pride and obstinacy; it was not possible
  for her complete integrity to betray what she felt to be a sacred truth for
  the sake of agreeing with human arguments. She became very devout in her
  religious observances, showing an exalted fervour that was a perfume rising
  from her consciousness of the faith whose observances were so closely round
  her. Everything mediocre being distasteful to her, she strove to raise her
  religion to sublime heights, she wished to be not only a Christian, but a
  saint, a martyr; to the rites of the Church she brought the emotional heroism
  of Corneille, the stoicism of Plutarch's worthies.</p>

  <p>Into a little notebook she copied sermons, litanies and prayers with her
  large, irregular hand, and these lines: "Deliver us always, Lord, from our
  enemies, we entreat you, by this Sign of the Cross...O, Jesus, I present
  myself before you with a humble and contrite heart, to recommend to you my
  last hour and that which must follow it...When my pale and livid cheeks
  inspire with compassion and terror those who attend me...When my ears, about
  to be for ever sealed to the voices of men, wait, trembling to hear the word
  of Judgment pronounced&mdash;<i>Miserere mei</i>."</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont could be gay, too; she was the most high-spirited
  among the pupils and the nuns. On an occasion she fastened some little bells
  to her garter, which rang as the girls danced together in the <i>allées</i>
  of the old park; the nuns had to chase them and catch them, one by one,
  before they could discover from where the pretty tinkle came. She loved, too,
  the company of children; one of these, whom she taught at the age of six to
  make lace on a pillow, spoke of her long afterwards as "<i>un ange du bon
  Dieu</i>."</p>

  <p>The <i>vacances</i> were spent at Mesnil-Imbert, where the two sisters
  were regular in their attendance at the parish church and where the elder
  gathered round her the infants and the poor, inventing games for the first
  and giving generously, sometimes even to her entire substance, to the second.
  When she had lived in the <i>Buttes de Saint-Gilles</i> she had eaten black
  bread in order to give the white loaves to charity; any sacrifice afforded
  her pleasure.</p>

  <p>This life of nun, of gentlewoman, of young girl approaching womanhood,
  lasted nearly seven years. During that period she was most influenced by the
  books she read, which were more to her than the gentle company of the nuns
  and her fellow-pupils, more than the environment of the ancient, massive
  building that enshrined her devotions, more, to her than anything she saw or
  heard about her daily life. This seclusion of seven years was ideal for
  breeding dreams, for encouraging visions, for forcing a strong imagination
  back on itself. Mlle. de Corday d'Armont was not fed by romances or tales of
  love or intrigue; her reading was severe, no novel ever came into her hands;
  she had not read <i>La Nouvelle Héloïse</i>, which had disturbed so many
  feminine hearts. J. J. Rousseau was to her the author of <i>Contrat
  Social</i> and she knew none of the scandals of his miserable life.</p>

  <p>Her natural disposition, the circumstances of her upbringing, the subtle
  influences of her time, above all her reading, turned her thoughts in one
  direction, that of virtue and strength. A passionate admiration for Sparta
  and Rome roused in her a secret exaltation that was at the root of her
  serenity, her gaiety, her piety. She was in love with heroism. Through her
  adored Corneille, she reached out to antiquity, where she found her ideals
  realised&mdash;the hero combating the tyrant, the hero dying for the
  country.</p>

  <p>The enthusiasm she felt burnt the stronger for being concealed; she had no
  <i>confidante</i> among these delicate women, with their resignation and
  their meekness; she knew that the expression of her exaltation would sound
  strangely among the muted tones of the nuns breaking the silence of the
  cloisters. Often her musing, her concentration on these heroisms, these
  ideals, would result in an ecstasy.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>What were these books, these heroes, which so impressed this powerful,
  simple and noble mind?</p>

  <p>Consider first the works of Pierre Corneille (1606-1684) for whom she had,
  as his descendant, an almost superstitious reverence. This connection gave
  her great prestige at the Convent, heightened by the fact that her uncle
  (one-eyed like her mother) was a Chevalier de Saint-Louis&mdash;a de Corday
  d'Armont truly shone with such embellishments.</p>

  <p>How easily these famous dramas which she never saw acted, but from which
  she drew such fervent inspiration, might seem to another eye dull, insipid,
  almost absurd.</p>

  <p>Neither the plots nor the characters of Pierre Corneille's plays bear any
  relation to any life that could ever have been lived anywhere. The
  elimination of all commonplaces, of all incidents in the minor key, of all
  humble details, leaves nothing but inhuman figures declaiming sentiments that
  only rarely and intermittently stir the human heart. There are no half-shades
  in the studies of the tyrant, the hero, the wicked woman, the
  heroine&mdash;there is no relief from emotional crisis; the protagonists leap
  from one peak of passion to another; there is always some mighty decision in
  debate. Not a single gleam of irony, of wit, of true pathos, lightens the
  long outbursts of eloquence with which these metallic figures express their
  woes, their indignations, their resolutions. They cannot be said to be
  characters, they are embodied virtues and vices, they settle no problems,
  they open no new vistas, they are quite incompatible with any existence of
  any human being.</p>

  <p>What matter? They are grand, they have the heroic outline, they are raised
  above the petty needs of everyday; they declaim against tyranny, against
  wrong, against injustice; the heroes are ready, eager for sacrifice, for
  liberty, for the country, i.e., the common weal. And all this impossible
  enthusiasm of antique virtue is couched in splendid diction, which rolls
  seductively off the tongue and fascinates the ear, as the elevation, dignity
  and grandeur of the sentiment fascinate the mind. Artificial, impossible it
  may be, even irritating or ridiculous in its refusal to recognise the real
  measure of humanity, but it is sublime and like fire to tinder when
  represented to a heart of noble mould.</p>

  <p>"To the influence of the great Corneille," said Napoléon I, "France owes
  some of her grandest actions; tragedy elevates the human soul, fires the
  heart with a noble passion and forms men into heroes. I would have made him a
  Prince."</p>

  <p>With with delight, then, did Mlle. de Corday d'Armont, in the seclusion of
  her austere chamber, in the secrecy of the hornbeam labyrinth, pore over
  <i>Cinna, Le Cid, Horace</i> or <i>Polyeucte</i>, with what noble pleasure
  did her beautiful lips form such energetic passages as these from her
  favourite drama of <i>Cinna:</i></p>

  <p class="poem">"Plus le péril est grand, plus doux en est le fruit,<br>
  La vertu nous y jette, et la gloire le suit."</p>

  <p>This sentiment exactly suited her own desire for self-sacrifice, for
  abnegation, as did this, put into the mouth of Emilie, a stern and patriotic
  heroine:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Meurs, s'il y faut mourir, en citoyen romain<br>
  Et par un beau trépas couronne un beau dessein."</p>

  <p>"<i>En citoyen romain</i>." This term might be said to sum up the desires
  of many ardent souls in the days that Mlle. de Corday d'Armont mused in the
  <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>; the intellectuals were classic mad. J. J. Rousseau
  referred his disciples back to Sparta and Rome, and Plutarch was in
  everyone's hands, as if it had been a guide book to daily life. People
  talked, wrote and thought about antiquity; in some it became a pose, an
  intolerable affectation, in most it prevented a clear understanding of the
  problems of the moment. The words
  republic&mdash;liberty&mdash;sacrifice&mdash;heroism, excited and confused
  the ardent spirits who dreamed of reforming France, the names of Cinna, the
  grandson of Pompey, who conspired against Augustus to avenge the murdered
  father of Emilia, of Mucius Scaevola, who thrust his hand into the brazier
  full of fire in front of Porsenna, of Marcus Curtius who leaped into the gulf
  to save the city, which recalled the two Roman Consuls, father and son, who
  rushed on death to appease the gods and gain the victory for their country,
  of Brutus, the Roman father, who sacrificed his son to the laws; of Manlius,
  the Roman David, who slew the gigantic Gaul and put to death his successful
  but disobedient son&mdash;these names were on everyone's lips, as if they
  belonged to living people; these actions were quoted, as if these were
  profitable examples to consider in the France of the last quarter of the
  eighteenth century.</p>

  <p>But the name that was most often repeated, which became a charm, a
  watchword, a symbol, an invocation, was that of Marcus Brutus, who slew his
  friend and benefactor in order to secure the liberty of Rome. Marcus Brutus,
  who was the fashion and the god of the moment was also, before even
  <i>Cinna</i> or <i>Rodriguez</i>, the first hero of Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont's admiration.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A book that had an equal value in her eyes with J. J. Rousseau, with
  Corneille, with Plutarch, was an extraordinary work which contained sentiment
  and heroism, tenderness and grandeur, a passion for liberty, a hatred of
  tyranny and slavery and a high admiration for Greece and Rome.</p>

  <p>This was a work in ten volumes ponderously entitled <i>Histoire
  Philosophique et Politique des Etablissements et du Commerce des Européens
  dans les deux Indes</i>, by Guillaume-Thomas Raynal and several
  collaborators. So immensely popular had this work proved that it had run into
  edition after edition and had been translated into several languages by the
  time it came into the hands of Mlle. de Corday d'Armont some ten years after
  its publication in 1770. So dangerous was it considered, and so offensive to
  authority, that the author had to flee France, and so when the pupil of the
  <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i> was reading his pages he was an old man living in
  exile in Germany.</p>

  <p>Raynal (1711-1796), a native of Rouergue, had been a Jesuit preacher of
  some distinction, but his independent spirit irked at all restrictions and he
  left the Church to become editor of the <i>Mercure de France</i> and a writer
  who combined fame with profit. He had travelled in England and
  Holland&mdash;the seats of enlightened government&mdash;but had resided in
  Paris until the Parliament of Paris proscribed <i>Les Deux Indes</i>.</p>

  <p>To read this book is like looking into a mirror wherein is mirrored the
  serene soul of the pupil of the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, so easy is it to see
  the reflection of her spirit in this work she so loved, which she re-read
  again and again. Purporting to be an account, laborious and accurate, of the
  conquest and colonisation of the East by the West, this rambling book, in
  much superficial, alternating between the style of the guide-book and an
  impassioned eloquence, has a rare fascination, which is, in part, that of the
  fairytale.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont's lively imagination, which had been fed on no
  scenery beyond the quiet Norman landscape, on no architecture beyond the
  sombre churches, convents and castles of Caen, delighted in the accounts of
  the strange, far-off lands conquered by the Portuguese, English, Dutch and
  French, the very names of which, Persia, Arabia, Malabar, Coromandel,
  Sumatra, Tartary and Yucatan, were like charms to efface the daily routine
  and evoke the rare and the precious. For a girl who had never permitted
  herself even to think of luxury, there was pleasure in the description of
  mares with henna-dyed tails, of the peacock throne of the great Mogul, of the
  silks, brocades and lacquers of China, of the muslins and cloths of gold of
  India, of the exquisite spices of the East, of landscapes such as these:
  <i>"C'est la que la nature riche et belle offre une verdure éternelle, des
  fleurs d'un parfum exquis, des eaux de crystal tombant en cascade, des arbres
  chargés de fleurs et de fruits en même temps, des situations pittoresques que
  l'art n'imitera jamais."</i></p>

  <p>The gentlewoman who had never had any but the simplest ornaments satisfied
  her taste by reading of the pearls of the Gulf of California, the virgin gold
  of the mines of India, the shawls of Kashmir, the balm, the camphire, the
  sapphires, the crystals&mdash;all the exotic luxuries of the new world that
  was the oldest world of all.</p>

  <p>But while, in this immense book, itself as full of odd treasures as the
  storehouse of an Eastern King, the young girl liked to ponder over the
  accounts of distant, almost fabulous countries; what made the author so near
  her heart was his passionate hatred of tyranny and cruelty, his noble
  indignation over the unhappy peoples enslaved, exploited and ruined to
  satisfy the greed of the tyrant, the adventurer, the trader. Mingling the
  sentimentality of J. J. Rousseau with the vigour of Pierre Corneille, Raynal,
  after soberly describing the vanilla plant, the cochineal industry, the
  culture of jalap or of indigo, would break into diatribe against the savage
  Europeans and eloquently extol the native virtues and liberties they so
  wantonly destroyed. In these passages the heart of his young reader was
  fervently with him, and the more she pondered over the words of the
  noble-minded <i>abbé</i>, the deeper she was confirmed in her worship of
  antique virtue.</p>

  <p>A handsome edition of the <i>Deux Indes</i> was brought out in Geneva in
  1780; in front of each volume was a copperplate from the elegant burin of
  Moreau le Jeune, representing some exotic, far-off scene&mdash;Montezuma's
  capture by the Spaniards, the English at the feet of Aurengzeyb&mdash;in
  itself sufficient to set the romantic mind on a fanciful voyage.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On one passage Mlle. de Corday d'Armont often cast her serious glance,
  that in which Raynal, with startling suddenness, interrupted his account of
  Anjinga with an <i>éloge</i> in the style of Sterne; by many this piece was
  thought to have been written by Diderot. "If my writings live, the name of
  Anjinga shall remain in the memories of men...there was born Eliza
  Draper..."</p>

  <p>In a tone of high-flown sentimentality, not without charm or pathos,
  Raynal proceeded to celebrate the young Englishwoman, Mrs. Elizabeth Draper,
  wife of Daniel Draper, counsellor at Bombay and friend of the Rev. Laurence
  Sterne, a delicate woman, who died of consumption at the age of thirty-three.
  <i>"Une âme celeste se sépara d'un corps céleste...Heureux Sterne, tu n'es
  plus, et moi je suis resté. t'ai pleuré avec Eliza, tu la pleurerois avec
  moi; et si le ciel eut voulu que vous m' eussiez survécu tous les deux, tu
  m'aurois pleuré avec elle."</i> In this style the aged author lamented his
  ideal woman who in her portrait had much in common with Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont; candour, sensibility, charm, elegance, and notably that rare
  combination of "<i>volupté et de décence</i>." Raynal wrote that Eliza Draper
  might have served as a model either for a statue of Profane or Sacred Love
  (<i>Volupté ou Pudeur</i>), so lovely was her form, so pure her soul; and the
  same might have been more truly said of the young Norman, with her brilliant
  beauty and her unblemished virginal modesty, than of Sterne's friend, of whom
  an English biographer wrote: "Her life would not bear inspection." But it was
  on her deathbed that Eliza Draper rose to those heights of sublimity that
  always roused the naïve admiration of Mlle. de Corday. Exhorting Raynal to
  follow the severe muse of History, the dying Eliza exclaimed, after
  references to Fame and the Phoenix:&mdash;<i>"Que ces emblémes t'exhortent
  sans cesse a to montrer le défenseur de l'Humanité, de la Vérité, de la
  Libérté."</i></p>

  <p>In response Raynal swore to the shades of Eliza, "in Heaven, thy first and
  last dwelling-place," never to write a line she would wish blotted, and
  proceeded to a description of Cochin, where there was a colony of Jews who
  foolishly maintained that they had been there since the captivity in
  Babylon.</p>

  <p>All this was strange reading for an imaginative young girl, shut away from
  intercourse with the world, a nun in all but the vows, full of noble,
  generous instincts and completely ignorant of modern conditions. What could
  she make, in her solitary musings, of this unworkable mixture of paganism and
  Christianity, of the energetic grandeur of Corneille, the half-visionary
  ideas of J. J. Rousseau, the sentimentalities and the honest tirades of the
  <i>abbé</i> Raynal, all derived from or fused with the heroes of
  antiquity?</p>

  <p>And these heroes, who were they? Most of them had never existed, were
  fabulous demi-gods, or were ordinary men credited with impossible exploits.
  Such of them as might prove to be authentic lived in times so remote, under
  conditions so different, that their examples were useless to
  eighteenth-century France. False Greeks, false Romans, the turgid imaginings
  of a middle-class Frenchman, the nostalgic romancings of a neurotic, the
  sentimental meanderings of a third-rate philosopher, the brutal savagery of
  the old Testament&mdash;what intelligence could fuse this to any practical
  rule of life, to any clear and definite faith? No intelligence, perhaps, but
  this young woman was a mystic, she did not heed the dross in all these
  muddled doctrines, for, put through the alembic of her temperament, only the
  pure gold remained.</p>

  <p>From her long brooding over the strange assortment of books which formed
  her little library she drew only ideals of liberty, goodness, strength,
  courage, self-sacrifice. She saw a Sparta, a Rome that had never existed, and
  could write, she who had wit and humour, in all sincerity:</p>

  <p><i>"O grande République! Vertus austères! Sublimes devouements! Actions
  héroïques! Vous n'êtes plus de notre époque! Les François ne sont pas assez
  purs, assez généreux pour te cornprendre et te réaliser, Republique de géants
  de l'antiquité! O nation trop frivole! Tu as besoin d'être régénérée et de
  puiser dans ton passé national les traditions du beau, du grand, du vrai, du
  noble!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <p>Thus the young patrician in her convent, in her chaste seclusion, while in
  France events were taking place which would be written even in the briefest
  handbook to history, none of these, as yet, had anything to do with Mlle. de
  Corday d'Armont and their echoes hardly pierced the massive walls of the
  <i>abbaye aux dames</i>.</p>

  <p>The nuns went about their lace-making, tapestry and embroidery, played
  their clavecins, distributed their bread and soup, visited their sick and
  poor, prayed and praised as the nuns of Matilda had done for nearly seven
  hundred years, and as peacefully as if their Norman cloisters were strong
  enough to stand till the Judgment Day and to weather all the storms of heaven
  and earth.</p>

  <p>The pupils studied and read, dreamt and sewed, wandered in the old park
  and sat in the ancient chambers of the convent with their tapestry frames and
  their psalters. They, too, were assured that none of the distant excitement
  of which they occasionally heard would ever disturb this sacred tranquillity,
  and they turned their thoughts more and more to taking the vows. The world
  was so ugly, so corrupt, so distasteful! They were so poor, so
  high-born&mdash;where was there any place for them save in this sanctified
  retreat?</p>
  <hr>

  <p>There is an old legend of the magic mirror, in which not only the future
  could be seen, but events that were taking place at the other side of the
  world. The witch would breathe on the dim surface, and the seer peering
  within could glimpse the beloved who was oceans away, or even the stranger
  whose destiny was one day to cross his own. Had Mlle. de Corday d'Armont
  possessed such a mirror, and had she looked into it sometimes during those
  seven years she lived in the convent, she might have seen two men, then as
  unknown to her as she to them, who were, in different parts of Europe,
  concerned with their own hopes and fears.</p>

  <p>One of them she was to know well and to see once only for a few moments,
  the other she was never to see, never to be aware of his existence; on both
  she was to exercise the power of a Fate. Let them be considered, briefly and
  severally, while all their destinies are at pause, yet slowly converging
  together, like three travellers in leisurely fashion proceeding along three
  different roads to a common goal.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The first picture that the magic mirror would have shown Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont would have been the ancient city of Mayence, then the <i>aula</i> of
  the University, where a young man was receiving his <i>doctorat</i> of
  philosophy from three professors in sky-blue robes garnished with gold
  braid.</p>

  <p>The successful student was the son of peasants, who had gained a
  scholarship at the University; on the academic register he was inscribed as
  <i>pauper</i>. At first he had wished to study medicine, but anatomy had
  disgusted him and he had turned his lively intelligence and his diligence
  towards Philosophy. The teachers thought well of the amiable youth and he was
  in particular the favourite of Nicholas Vogt and his brother, Johann Heinrich
  Vogt.</p>

  <p>To obtain his diploma the young man had written a Latin thesis; his
  subject was Enthusiasm (<i>De Enthusiasmo</i>). He had, besides, to discuss
  with the examiners twenty-two subjects, the origin of ideas, Greek
  philosophy, the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, on the
  Beautiful, astronomy, geometry, and physics among them.</p>

  <p>Having satisfied the professors the young doctor was free to go in the
  streets of Mayence; the University. was <i>en fête</i> for the gifts of the
  Elector, Charles Frederick von Erthal, who had marked the tricentenary of the
  foundation by presenting the incomes of three suppressed convents to the seat
  of Learning.</p>

  <p>It was November, 1784, and the ardent young man long remembered the
  sensation of pleasure he had felt on that day of late autumn when he had
  succeeded in the first important step of his life and when his spirit was
  animated by, and his heart full of, the noble and sublime ideas that he had
  been expounding. He was nineteen years of age, of middle height, with blunt
  Teutonic features, brilliant grey eyes, a wide forehead and long, heavy
  light-brown hair; he had an appearance of great energy. The essay Enthusiasm
  had been written from his heart; in it he had, in mediocre Latin, full of
  Teutonic terms, striven to paint the "enthusiasm of the heart, transported by
  sublime and grand actions, showing its sentiments in abundant and lively
  expressions, without rule, without art, with movement and fire," and while he
  had composed his stiff periods his own blood had burned with the desire for
  self-sacrifice, for some splendid heroism, for service in the cause of
  liberty and virtue&mdash;republicanism and virtue. He, too, was a pupil of J.
  J. Rousseau; he, too, was lost in admiration of the heroes of antiquity; he,
  too, valued the beautiful, the grand, the great enterprises&mdash;Mlle. de
  Corday d'Armont would have read his treatise with delight and would have
  subscribed to all the opinions it contained. The young doctor, detailing the
  different kinds of enthusiasms, moral, political, religious, was careful to
  repudiate fanaticism, intolerance, excess of any nature, and to teach that
  the true enthusiasm, which is capable of cutting through any obstacle, is
  free from vice, is pure and elevated. Above all, he extolled public and
  national enthusiasm&mdash;"such as animated the Greeks." Such enthusiasm was
  capable of causing revolutions, of reforming nations, of regenerating
  mankind.</p>

  <p>With his head full of these exciting and otherworldly thoughts, the young
  doctor sought for a living. He found a post as tutor to the children of Herr
  Dumont, a rich merchant of Mayence.</p>

  <p>His gentle manners, his noble and candid nature, his intelligence and the
  graces of his person obtained for him not only the friendship of his
  employers, but the hand and heart of Sabina Reuter, Madame Dumont's sister.
  Full of the ideals of Sparta, Rome and J. J. Rousseau, the young husband left
  the city and, with his wife's dowry and his own savings, purchased a little
  estate, Donnersmühle, near Kostheim, in the midst of joyous and delicious
  scenery. There he lived, with his loving wife and the three little girls whom
  she bore him, a life of classic simplicity such as would have pleased the
  author of <i>Emile</i>. He tilled his fields, cultivated his vines, gathered
  his dear ones round his humble hearth, meditated in the woods and lanes, or
  enclosed himself in his closet with his books and his meditations on
  politics, on literature, on the ideals of J. J. Rousseau, on enthusiasm. When
  he left this charming retreat it was to go into the city to meet the savants
  and professors of Mayence and to discuss with them the thoughts which had
  risen in him during his solitude. Closest among his friends was the
  counsellor to the tribunal of the University, his brother-in-law, Johan Georg
  Reuter.</p>

  <p>Thus the magic mirror would have shown this young man living in studious
  idyllic repose in his rustic retreat during the years that Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont was in retreat in the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>; these two young
  minds, in much so similar, were being nourished by the same fare, both were
  being turned passionately in one direction, that of sublimity,
  self-sacrifice, enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>This man came from the village of Obernburg in the electorate of Mayence.
  His name was Jean-Adam Lux.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>After the magic mirror had shown this simple and touching picture, which
  would have roused Mlle. de Corday d'Armont to admiration and respect, it
  would have presented to her another vision with which she would have had no
  sympathy&mdash;that of the other man whose destiny was to cut so sharply and
  so soon across her own. The scene is not very different; again it is a
  University, this time that of Rouen, where a prize is being awarded to the
  best thesis "on the use of electricity in medicine" (electro-therapy); again
  it is a doctor at a successful moment of his career, but now a doctor of
  medicine of the University of Saint Andrews, Scotland. He is older than Mlle.
  de Corday d'Armont and Jean-Adam Lux; he is, at the moment (1783) he receives
  this honour, sombrely and with a grudging pleasure, nearly forty years old,
  is in doubtful circumstances and has seen altogether too much of mankind. He
  is soured, jealous, ambitious, gifted, hard-working, by birth a Sardinian, by
  upbringing a Swiss Calvinist.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>This struggling man of medicine, with his Scotch degree, had been born at
  Boudry, near the city of Geneva, and was the son of a poor chemist who worked
  at a textile factory and who came from Cagliari in the Isle of Sardinia. He
  was one of six children, four boys and two girls, and passed his infancy and
  childhood at Neuchâtel, where he was brought up on stern Calvinist lines by
  his father, who then earned a living by teaching languages. These children
  were taught as a trade that famous Swiss craft, the making of clocks, watch
  hands and very fine jewellery. The eldest daughter, Albertine, showed herself
  especially skilful at this delicate work.</p>

  <p>The eldest of the family, Jean-Paul, was carefully educated; his quickness
  of mind and ardour to succeed secured him several prizes and the
  encouragement of his master, but his gloomy, bilious temperament, his
  fantastic vanity and uncouth appearance earned him the dislike, often
  actively expressed, of his fellow-students. He had a turn for science, was
  expert in several languages, energetic, curious and enterprising. In his
  early youth he had endeavoured in vain to obtain permission to join an
  expedition that was being sent to Tobolsk to observe the transit of Venus.
  Finding no definite goal for his vague and stormy ambitions he resolved to
  travel, and supporting himself by teaching, journeyed to the Midi, residing
  in Toulouse and Bordeaux. He then went to London, Dublin, Edinburgh, The
  Hague, Utrecht, Amsterdam, London again, always poor, restless, bitter,
  observant and gnawed by worldly ambition. He early turned to writing as a
  scope for his feelings and a bait for his desires. From the pleasant
  seclusion of Pimlico he sent forth pamphlets, essays, in the fashion of the
  moment; one of these, "A Philosophical Essay on Man," written in English,
  attracted considerable attention but produced no solid results. His work did
  not lack brilliancy, but was confused and superficial, largely owing to the
  obscurities and difficulties of his subject, and a little perhaps because
  some of his ideas were novel and ill-digested.</p>

  <p>Translated into French, his books had a bad reception in Paris; the
  <i>philosophes</i> would have none of the young adventurer, and stung by
  their scorn he gloomily and bitterly started again on his travels. At Saint
  Andrews, in 1775, he took his degree in medicine, and he afterwards practised
  humbly in London, writing the while anonymous English pamphlets on medical
  subjects and a political one entitled "Chains of Slavery." In 1777 he
  returned to France, where he obtained a post in the household of the King's
  brother, the fashionable and elegant Comte d'Artois, <i>Monsieur</i>. His
  position was that of doctor to the <i>gardes</i> or gentlemen attendant on
  the Prince; he received his keep and, annually, two thousand <i>livres</i>.
  So far, gifts and industry were suitably rewarded and Jean-Paul might
  congratulate himself on being, at the age of thirty, a successful man. He may
  then be imagined, in the years when Mlle. de Corday d'Armont was doing
  housework in the <i>Buttes de Saint-Gilles</i> or disciplining herself in the
  <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, when Adam Lux was studying hard in the University of
  Mayence or residing in his rustic retreat, as living (1777-1789) in a
  pleasant little apartment in the rue de Bourgogne, which, furnished elegantly
  and comfortably, was remarkable for a little collection of fine pictures. Not
  only had the young doctor his court appointment, but also a fashionable
  <i>clientèle</i>; he charged thirty-six <i>livres</i> a visit and never
  lacked patients. He soon, however, became impatient of the drudgery of what
  he termed a <i>"métier de charlatan"</i> and which seemed to promise no
  money, fame, or what he valued more, power. He neglected his patients for
  laboratory work and threw his passionate energy into an attempt to discover a
  remedy for a disease that he saw devastating his
  contemporaries&mdash;consumption (phthisis). He believed that he had secured
  a <i>spécifique</i> against this deadly malady and succeeded in curing a
  noble lady, the Marquise Laupespine, who had been given twenty-four hours of
  life by other doctors. This cure seemed like a miracle and brought Jean-Paul
  a number of patients and a good sale for the water that had rescued the fair
  marquise from the grave.</p>

  <p>The young doctor was doubtless sincere in believing that he had made a
  remarkable discovery and did not suspect that if the lady had really been in
  the last stages of lung consumption, no <i>eau factice antipulmonique</i>
  could have cured her malady.</p>

  <p>In 1783 came the prize for the thesis on <i>"l'éleetricité médicale"</i>
  and attempts to storm the austere heights of the Academy of Sciences with
  brochures on "The Nature of Fire, etc.," "Discoveries on Light" and other
  experimental essays, which were not successful.</p>

  <p>In 1784 Jean-Paul competed for and failed to obtain a prize offered by the
  Academy of Lyons; the subject was Sir Isaac Newton's theory of light. Deeply
  chagrined by this rebuff, the energetic competitor printed his thesis, which
  was an attack on Newton, and roused contempt and derision from the
  Academics.</p>

  <p>Fearless and embittered, the author, attacking all accepted authorities,
  published one pamphlet after another, which showed no profound knowledge of
  his subjects but a quick, restless and lively mind. He became embroiled in
  quarrels with the scientists and the orthodox members of his own profession
  and began to turn to journalism and that type of political pamphlet which he,
  so long employed by royalty, had issued against tyrants in
  <i>L'esclavage</i>, written in his lonely youth. He was a quick, vivid
  writer, and his industry was enormous; the lust for power, for fame, for
  applause, drove him on like a spur in his side; he had no interest save for
  his work; he wrote of the "sublime Corneille," he admired the heroes of
  Greece and Rome, he called himself a disciple of J. J. Rousseau, but not for
  him was the dream of rural bliss, the vision of heroic grandeur, of
  self-sacrifice, of the felicity of mankind. His egotism was profound and with
  every failure more deeply wounded, until the whole morose and melancholy
  nature turned savage. If he ever pondered over the reformation of society it
  was because he thought that an upheaval might mean an advantage to himself;
  if he hated society it was because it had not honoured him; if he thought the
  world was awry it was because there was not a sufficiently exalted place in
  it for himself. Could he have found his court in the civilisation about him
  he would not have found it corrupt, filthy, detestable. Could the worldly
  prizes he coveted have been his he would not have greatly cared for the
  wrongs and miseries of his fellow-men. It was his own grievance that corroded
  his soul, his personal disappointment that clouded his mind, his frustrated
  vanity that coloured his views.</p>

  <p>His merits were considerable; his private life was chaste, he had no
  vices, he was capable of great endurance, he spared nothing in the
  furtherance of an aim, he was morally and physically fearless. His was, in
  much, the temperament of a Puritan, frustrated, thwarted, suppressed,
  unhappy, savagely ready to turn on those who had helped themselves to all
  those things he could not or would not enjoy.</p>

  <p>His bad health was responsible for much of his violent temper, his
  restlessness, his misery.</p>

  <p>In contrast to the serene health enjoyed by Mlle. de Corday d'Armont and
  Dr. Adam Lux, Jean-Paul was a neurasthenic, exhausted by toil, anxiety, envy
  and jealousy.</p>

  <p>He would spend hours at his desk, writing with furious speed, until he
  trembled with fatigue, then drink quantities of black coffee to revive
  himself, this being repeated until he sank, insensible from exhaustion, into
  a half-drugged, uneasy sleep.</p>

  <p>His appearance was remarkable, terrible and imposing. No more than five
  feet in height, his torso was huge, his head enormous and sunk in his
  shoulders, his colouring of the South, masses of tousled dark hair, a yellow
  complexion, usually showing the unshaven traces of a black beard,
  yellow-hazel eyes, piercing, lively, formidable. The bony structure of the
  face showed under the lead-coloured skin, the nose was heavy, with a crushed
  look, the mouth swollen, brutal and distorted by a nervous twitching, the
  jowl gross and ugly. If the brow and eyes had a certain nobility, the lower
  part of the face might well be termed the jowl of a monster. He moved and
  spoke with a natural force and pride that were graceful in its spontaneous
  vigour. His voice was deep and powerful with a slight defect in his speech
  owing to the size of his tongue. He had neither manners, taste, nor any sense
  of the conventions, his attire was careless, his person neglected; he gave
  the impression of a driving force that did not yet know in what direction to
  turn its fury.</p>

  <p>This sick, passionate creature, this man of science <i>manqué</i>, this
  cosmopolitan, southern by birth, Swiss Calvinist by upbringing, this
  ambitious, hideous charlatan searching desperately, frantically for an outlet
  for his feverish energies, was named Jean-Paul Marat.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In the years 1789-1790 Mlle. de Corday d'Armont decided to take the veil
  and persuaded her sister to do the same; she wrote long letters to her uncle
  on this subject and other matters to her friends. Going abroad in Caen she
  bought a <i>Typus Mundi</i>, dated 1627, ornamented with engravings, and in
  it she wrote: <i>"Acheté 4 livres, C. de A. Sainte-Trinité à Caen, 20
  décembre 1790."</i></p>

  <p>Sometimes she signed herself Marie, sometimes Corday or Armont, or Corday
  Armont. She wrote to a friend, Madame Duhavelle, the story of Aglaë, who in
  the year A.D. 300 raised a statue to Saint Boniface at Rome; she wrote little
  business letters which show the careful Norman shrewdness. She was ignorant
  of the existence of Dr. Lux, of Dr. Marat; she scarcely knew what was taking
  place in France; she was still ignorant of love, still without fault or
  stain, resolute then to dedicate her life to God and to remain for ever in
  the seclusion of the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>. Every morning she took the
  Sacrament; when she prayed her face was hidden in her hands; she was pious,
  charitable, obedient, the humours of her youth were subdued; she no longer
  argued or showed obstinacy; she considered herself, and others considered
  her, as a nun&mdash;<i>une vraie religieuse</i>.</p>

  <p>She wrote to her brothers on the charms of a conventual life and told of
  her <i>communications avec Dieu</i>. She was eager to show her devotion in
  undertaking the humblest and most difficult of labours; she eagerly nursed
  the sick&mdash;"if she had been asked to give her life," it was said of her,
  "she would not have hesitated to do so."</p>

  <p>Yet amid all this atmosphere of Christianity, of feminine abnegation, of
  elegant seclusion, her soul was with her beloved heroes of antiquity, with
  Cinna, Manlius, Brutus, Decius, and her dreams were bright with sublime
  grandeur.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The year 1789, Mlle. de Corday d'Armont in her convent, Adam Lux on his
  farm, Jean Marat turning from medicine to politics&mdash;the outbreak of the
  French Revolution.</p>

  <p>The States General opened on May 5th; what can they do for a country where
  affairs are in chaos and everyone is either incompetent or helpless?</p>

  <p>Church, Nobles, Commons, the King, the Queen, the Princes of the Blood,
  all gathered at Versailles.</p>

  <p>After disputes the Commons vote themselves a National Assembly and refuse
  (June 23rd) to obey the Royal command ordering them to quit the Tennis Court
  (<i>Jeu de Paume</i>), to which they have adjourned when the doors of <i>La
  Salle des Menus Plaisirs</i> are closed to them. M. Bailly, the astronomer,
  is the President; on June 27th the <i>duc</i> d'Orléans, most of the clergy
  and nobility, join the Assembly, which is divided into the Right
  (government), the Left (republican) and the Centre (moderates).</p>

  <p>While Mirabeau and Sieyès harangue the Assembly, the foolish harassed King
  dismisses Necker, causing riots in Paris and the calling out of the soldiery.
  Amid turmoils a National Guard is formed with Lafayette as their head; they
  wear the tricolour&mdash;red, blue for Paris, white for the Bourbons; these
  are also the colours of the House of Orléans.</p>

  <p>While the Assembly is arguing, the People, feeling authority feeble,
  begins to try its strength. On July 14th the Bastille, the almost disused
  State prison and fortress, is taken by the mob and its military defenders
  slain. Seven freed prisoners, five of whom are criminals, are paraded in
  triumph; it is a notable date in history, the era of liberty has begun. The
  King recalls Necker, grants an amnesty to the rioters, establishes the
  <i>Commune</i> (government of the city of Paris) and puts the tricolour
  cockade in his hat.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The ladies of the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i> may have considered themselves
  safe from all these events, but the sudden outbursts of savage violence in
  different parts of the country did not spare Caen. Before the Revolution was
  well begun it was marred by the terrible excesses of the lowest classes and
  the violent characters who seized the opportunity of the weakening of all
  authority to try to push the nation into an anarchy where they might rape and
  plunder at their will.</p>

  <p>In the <i>salon</i> of the <i>abbaye</i> Mlle. de Corday d'Armont had
  heard of M. de Belzunce, the handsome young officer who was related to the
  Abbess. This arrogant young aristocrat, wilful and fearless, did not hesitate
  to express his disgust at the growing power of the people; supported by a
  fellow-officer, the <i>duc</i> de Beavron, he turned his disdain on the
  newly-raised militia or National soldiers, and on his own authority broke up
  the meetings of the political clubs then being formed in Caen. General
  Dumouriez, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the new Cabinet, warned him to
  be careful, but the young Vicomte laughed. A pamphlet exciting the army
  against the people was attributed to him and so exasperating was his insolent
  behaviour considered that the National Committee that had been set up in Caen
  requested the Governor-General of Normandy to remove M. de Belzunce from the
  garrison.</p>

  <p>The climax came with a scuffle between the militia and the regulars in the
  streets of Caen; some fool fired, a man was killed, and the town in an
  uproar. The Bourbon regiment fired on the crowd, the tocsin broke the
  slumbers of the nuns and their pupils; the alarm bells sounded, the Faubourg
  de Vaucelles was set on fire, the soldiers began to drag out their
  cannon.</p>

  <p>It was a riot passing into a revolution; the officers of both sides went
  to the Town Hall to endeavour to come to an understanding. M. de Belzunce,
  who had come to his senses, was among them. When he left the militia guarded
  him in order to protect him from the fury of the people, to whom he was an
  object of peculiar detestation.</p>

  <p>As they were taking him to the citadel the mob broke through the escort
  and seized the unhappy young man; a national guard shot him and his mutilated
  body was dragged through the streets, his head set on a pike, his heart torn
  out, roasted and eaten by a woman of the People.</p>

  <p>This was some of the first blood shed in the Revolution, a terrible
  indication of the almost incredible savagery of the lowest people, who,
  brutalised by long oppression, ignorant, bestial, full of hatred towards
  their superiors, had not the intelligence to wait for the reforms being taken
  in hand by the Assembly, but, impatient and roused, rushed at once to bloody
  excess.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont heard with horror of this murder which came so
  near to her and which was so shocking in its circumstances. A few days before
  his death the bold and charming young man had been walking in the
  <i>allées</i> of his <i>château</i> with Mlle. de Mortemart, his
  <i>fiancée</i>, playfully yoking himself to a little chariot to draw along
  some ladies...</p>

  <p>The young girl shuddered deeper into her cloisters, delivered herself more
  passionately to her prayers and her dreams.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The Assembly (<i>L'Assemblée Constituante</i>) is alarmed; the
  <i>canaille</i> tend to get out of hand; there are tales, from all over the
  country, of pillage, murder, burnings of <i>châteaux</i>, defiance of
  authority; the nobles begin to emigrate; among them the King's two brothers
  and the three Princes of the great House of Condé.</p>

  <p>The deputies hesitate; what do the people want? How satisfy them? Can we
  even at this moment of terrible crisis venture to take from the only classes
  who have to give, the nobles, the clergy?</p>

  <p>No one does anything, but a gesture of antique grandeur provokes a frenzy
  of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>It is a famous date&mdash;August 4th, 1789; the Vicomte Jean de Noailles
  rises and suggests the abolition of the Feudal system&mdash;quiet the people
  by giving them all they ask for, make all Frenchmen equal! He is seconded by
  the <i>duc</i> d'Aiguillon, always a liberal; amazed, the <i>Tiers Etat</i>
  applaud.</p>

  <p>There is a frantic competition in generosity, noble after noble rises up
  and sacrifices all the goods and privileges of his Order, the clergy offer
  the <i>dîme</i> (tithe), the Provinces, Brittany, Languedoc, Artois,
  Burgundy, Lorraine, renounce their privileges&mdash;it is an orgy of
  self-immolation.</p>

  <p>The deputies <i>semblent fous</i>, they weep, faint, embrace one another,
  1,700 men become hysterical; not only have they saved their country from
  anarchy, they have laid the foundation-stone of the golden age; they rush,
  overcome by emotion, to hear the Archbishop of Paris conduct a <i>Te Deum</i>
  in the ornate chapel of Versailles; it is a transport, a delirium, a
  stammering of joy: <i>"Quelle Nation! Quelle gloire! Quel honneur d'être
  français!"</i> What a triumph for the readers of Plutarch, for the disciples
  of J. J. Rousseau, for believers in antique virtue and the goodness of
  man&mdash;what a scene for an Adam Lux or Mlle. de Corday d'Armont to weep
  over!</p>

  <p>There is no one among the enthusiastic legislators to note that M. de
  Noailles is a cadet of his house and ruined, that he has, in fact, nothing to
  give away, that his friends call him "<i>Jean sans terre</i>," that the other
  nobles offer what they can no longer protect, that the Church has offered the
  <i>dîme</i> when it is gorged with the greater part of the country's
  wealth.</p>

  <p>"The people," declare the deputies, "will, overcome by gratitude, return
  at once to law and order."</p>

  <p>But Mirabeau, the one great man in the Assembly, remarks on hearing the
  news from the provinces&mdash;"Before you give the people their rights, you
  must teach them their duties."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont heard, indeed, with boundless enthusiasm, of
  August 4th; she saw her dreams translated into realities, her visions made
  solid&mdash;the millennium realised, the doctrines of J. J. Rousseau, of
  Raynal, "her oracle," put into practice&mdash;France would be great, would be
  free, would be glorious, on the model of Sparta or the Rome of Brutus. She,
  too, wept tears of joy; the <i>Déclaration</i> (The Declaration of the Rights
  of Man, August 26th, 1789), drawn up as near as possible to the ideals of J.
  J. Rousseau, excited her most profound admiration. The promised land was in
  sight at last; "the rights of man" had been proclaimed by the government of a
  great nation. A constitution, modelled on that of the United States and
  inspired by the teachings of the Genevan philosopher, was to be given to the
  people of France: <i>"Nous voulons faire une déclaration pour tous les
  hommes, pour tous les temps, pour tous les pays, et pour servir d'exemple au
  monde!"</i></p>

  <p>This is the language of hysteria, of delirium. M. Dumont, a Swiss present
  at the meetings of the Assembly, dryly commented: <i>"Vaines disputes des
  mots, fatras métaphysique"</i>&mdash;"a class at the Sorbonne," while another
  foreigner, the German Campe, remarked that the confusion in the Assembly "was
  like a witch's Sabbath."</p>

  <p>There was, however, no "medley of balderdash" in all this to Mlle. de
  Corday d'Armont, nor to thousands of others who hailed with triumph the
  redemption and happiness of mankind. Adam Lux wept in an ecstasy over his
  books in his rustic retreat, a young English poet then in Paris sighed:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive<br>
  But to be young was very heaven."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Jean-Paul Marat, abandoning all orthodox ways of a livelihood, had thrown
  himself violently into the disturbed current of the times. An inflammatory
  pamphleteer, a venomous journalist, scribbling with facility, power and fury,
  he soon was marked as a dangerous man and pursued from pillar to post by the
  police under Lafayette. In his own words he was "exposed to a thousand
  dangers, surrounded by spies and assassins, chased from hole to hole, never
  able to sleep two nights in the same place." Lurking now with a butcher, now
  with an actress, he snatched at whatever asylum was offered, writing,
  writing, on truth, liberty, the rights and wrongs of the people, swollen by
  his own monstrous indignation at his own fate. He had forgotten his science,
  his attacks on Newton, his disputes with the Academics, his cures for
  consumption, his speculations on electricity; he was no longer interested in
  the cause of the colours in soap-bubbles, or the virtue of <i>l'eau
  ambrée</i> in milk; he had found his <i>métier</i>&mdash;he was a
  patriot&mdash;<i>l'ami du people</i>.</p>

  <p>At one time he was reduced to hiding like a rat in the old quarries of
  Montmartre, at another to lurking in damp, dark cellars&mdash;<i>rongé par la
  misère la plus affreuse</i>.</p>

  <p>Without shirt or stockings, wrapped in a filthy coat and breeches, his
  head of greasy hair tied in a torn handkerchief damped with vinegar, he sat
  hunched in his foul retreat, a pen in his hand, a wad of paper on his knees,
  like one making dynamite underground.</p>

  <p>His health, always miserable, failed rapidly; the noisome air of his hole,
  the stink from the coarse oil of his crazy lamp, the damp, the wretched food,
  the anxiety, the rage that racked him caused inflamed eyes, chronic
  indigestion, constant headaches, nervous convulsion, and gradually a most
  repulsive skin disease resembling, in the eyes of the ignorant, leprosy.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The <i>Déclaration</i> had admitted the existence of God, the Church had
  not been touched, and the existence of the ladies in the
  <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i> remained unchanged; Normandy had accepted with
  enthusiasm the principles of the <i>Déclaration</i> and order had been
  restored in Caen after the Belzunce murder.</p>

  <p>Madame de Belzunce died in 1787 and her place as Abbess had been taken by
  Madame de Pontécoulant; M. de Corday d'Armont, hoping to find some relief for
  his own grievances in this general adjustment of grievances, joined the
  medley of pamphleteers with <i>L'idée de Procès</i>, inspired by his own
  unhappy lawsuit, followed by <i>L'Egalité de Partages</i>. He had willingly
  accepted the abolition of those feudal rights which had not favoured him, a
  younger son, and, as representative of his parish, he claimed a share in the
  newly freed lands&mdash;he desired an equality of division among all the sons
  of a man of property; beyond this he did not go; he remained attached to the
  King, to the traditions of his class, and he viewed with alarm the
  possibility that the reforms he approved might be pushed to excesses that he
  would regard with horror.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The Revolution spreads. In October, 1789, the frantic reception of the
  loyal Flanders regiment in the <i>Salon de Hercule</i>, the tricolour
  trampled underfoot, the white cockade triumphant, in the streets of Paris
  women with drums, shouting: "Bread! Bread!" Seven thousand of them marching
  on Versailles, driven out by the National Guard, the King forced to return to
  the <i>Tuileries</i>, virtually a prisoner.</p>

  <p>On July 14th, 1790, Fête of the Federation, first anniversary of the fall
  of the Bastille, all take the civil oath on the Champ de Mars: "I swear to
  defend the liberty of the nation."</p>

  <p>It is another triumph for the idealists; the Bishop of Autun, assisted by
  four hundred priests on a huge altar, celebrates Mass and sprinkles holy
  water on the hundreds of banners of the people; they all wear tricolour
  sashes, there is more weeping, more embracing, more enthusiasm; Autun, whose
  name is Charles de Talleyrand, whispers to Lafayette as he mounts the altar,
  "As long as you don't make one laugh"; a few weeks later Necker has resigned
  again; there is no money in the country, no bread&mdash;"You play act," says
  Mirabeau, "with bankruptcy staring you in the face."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The clubs are founded; with their headquarters in Paris, they have
  branches all over the country; in the gloomy rooms of the old Jacobin convent
  in the rue St.-Honoré the extremists, ragged, dirty men, violent and
  forceful, meet by the light of cheap tallow candles; among them is one
  neither ragged nor dirty, but neat, charming, elegant and well
  behaved&mdash;Maximilien Robespierre.</p>

  <p>In the ancient monastery of the Cordeliers is another club, the members of
  which are poor, oppressed, sombre and passionate; their avowed aim is the
  establishment of a free Republic. Among those who creep out of hiding to join
  these secret meetings is Jean-Paul Marat.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In April, 1790, the Assembly, faced by a financial crisis, confiscates the
  property of the Church; Necker, once more struggling with a crisis, has
  exhausted every expedient; <i>"la nationalisation des biens du clergé"</i> is
  a last and desperate resource which leaves three milliards' worth of property
  in the hands of the Government; against these not easily realisable
  securities, paper money, the famous <i>assignats</i>, is issued. The country
  is not satisfied by the spoliation of the Church any more than it has been
  satisfied by the self-sacrifice of the nobility; thoughtful people dread to
  look ahead, but Mlle. de Corday d'Armont remains in her convent, her state of
  exaltation undisturbed, Adam Lux regards France with envy from his orchards
  on the banks of the Rhine and passionately wishes he was a Frenchman,
  Jean-Paul Marat, eaten by disease and filth, scribbles in his foul
  hiding-place or raves at the forbidden meetings in the Cordeliers.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The year 1791. The royal family tries to fly the country and is brought
  back, all functions of royalty are suspended, the Constituent Assembly is
  dissolved, the Legislative Assembly is formed of 745 Deputies elected by the
  people to frame the laws for the new Constitution. The divisions are as
  before; the Right, consists of the <i>Monarchists</i>, the Centre, the
  <i>Moderates</i>, the Left, the <i>Gironde</i>, so called because the most
  famous members were from the Gironde.</p>

  <p>The King chooses his ministers from the Left, Roland, Dumouriez; they
  declare war on the Holy Roman Empire and on Russia, for these two Powers have
  sent insolent rebukes and demands to the Assembly; the French are defeated in
  the field, the government enrols 20,000 men for the defence of Paris, the
  King vetoes the measure; the mob storms the <i>Tuileries</i>; the Duke of
  Brunswick, sent with 140,000 men to crush the Revolution, issues an arrogant
  manifesto&mdash;"I am commissioned by the Sovereigns of Europe to lay Paris
  in the dust and crush the republican vipers under heel." Paris flies to arms,
  the <i>Tuileries</i> is attacked again, the Marseillais march on the capital
  singing the hymn of the Revolution; the King and the royal family are sent as
  prisoners to the Temple. Among the members of the Assembly who come into
  prominence is Jean-Paul Marat, who leaves his refuge of sewer rat to sit on
  the benches of the tribunes.</p>

  <p>"I am," he cries, "the rage of the people."</p>

  <p>And, in his rage, his dirt, his suffering, his fury, his venom, he does
  indeed seem to typify, foreigner as he is, that portion of the French nation
  which has hitherto been shut out, despised, starved, beaten, ridiculed.</p>

  <p>He is a figure of horror, a monster, terrible and fascinating. <i>"Quoi!
  c'est là Marat! Cette chose fauve, verte d'habits; ces yeux gris faune si
  saillants! C'est au genre batracien qu'elle appartient à coup sûr plutôt qu'à
  l'espèce humaine. De quel marais nous arrive cette choquante
  créature?"</i></p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont begins to hear of him in the political gossip
  that filters through even to the convent, to read of him in the newspapers
  she so eagerly peruses; his name is linked with Danton, repeated with that of
  Robespierre; he becomes daily more powerful in the Cordeliers, which, with
  the Jacobins, is daily becoming more powerful than the Government, if
  Government the Assembly can be termed.</p>

  <p>By a decree of 1791 all monasteries and convents are closed; Mlle. de
  Corday d'Armont cannot then be a nun; the life for which she has been for
  seven years and a half insensibly preparing is forbidden. No longer are
  masses to be sung for the soul of Queen Matilda; the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>
  becomes National Property. The young girl lingers on the threshold of change;
  she is allowed to remain in the cloisters for a while, reading, pondering;
  she is there when Marat and Danton, representing the <i>Mountain</i>, or
  Extreme Left, urge on the September massacres as reprisals against the
  royalists for the march of the invaders on Verdun; ten thousand prisoners are
  slaughtered in two days by hired murderers, while Dumouriez drives the enemy
  back across the Rhine, retaking Verdun and Longwy.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday d'Armont hears rumours, echoes, confused reports of these
  events; all increase her admiration for the <i>Gironde</i>, these true
  Republicans, disciples of J. J. Rousseau, lovers of Plutarch, who talk in
  terms of Greece and Rome, these men worthy of the names of Cato, Cincinnatus,
  Brutus, Manlius&mdash;she perceives that they have their enemies, that the
  tyrants are not crushed. But Tarquin and Caligula were not to be found on the
  throne, now overturned, but on the benches of the tribunes, disguised under
  the ferocious masks of Danton and Marat.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In this terrible year of 1791 Mlle. de Corday d'Armont leaves, at length,
  and reluctantly, the quiet seclusion of the ancient convent, the
  <i>allées</i> of elms, the labyrinth of hornbeams, and returns to her father
  at Mesnil-Imbert; the family, in accordance with the new republican fervour
  and the law of 1790 suppressing titles of nobility, cease to use the name of
  their estate; the eldest daughter, on re-entering the world, takes her third
  name; she is now known as Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <br>
  "La désorganisation du Royaume ne pouvait être mieux combinée." &mdash;
  Gabriel Riquetti Mirabeau, 1791.</p>
  <hr style="width:25%">
  <br>

  <p class="first">It seemed very far from all these events at Mesnil-Imbert;
  Charlotte de Corday was absorbed into her pastoral life again, mingled with
  her friends, became part once more of the Norman air, the Norman landscape.
  For a while she wore the dark blue habit of the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i> which
  appears to be that of a novice, worked among the poor and the sick, but soon
  she adopted a secular dress and occupied herself almost entirely with
  children, for whom she had a tender affection.</p>

  <p>She gathered round her in the old bakehouse little classes for
  lace-making, for reading, and she could often be seen racing her little
  pupils down the valleys, the winner rewarded with a doll of her own
  making.</p>

  <p>Above all, she was admired for her sweetness&mdash;<i>douce, si douce</i>,
  they said of her; she was frequently compared to an angel, the type of angel
  worshipped by holy nuns and trusted by little children.</p>

  <p>She had an entire absence of any kind of affectation. Her sincerity was
  absolute; she had the unselfconsciousness of perfect breeding and did not
  appear to know that she was beautiful; her gorgeous tresses were not dressed
  or powdered more than four times a year; for the rest they hung as they would
  over her shoulders, confined by a simple ribbon or falling under a plain cap;
  sometimes lightly powdered by herself in front where the small ringlets waved
  on the pure brow.</p>

  <p>She wore in the summer austere gowns of Indian muslin, embroidered by
  herself round the hems, and grey in colour; one was in wide stripes of two
  shades of brown. She had a riding habit of white cloth, gallooned with braid;
  on fête-days she wore robes of taffetas, white, grey, rose, all
  unpretentious, elegant, the attire of a gentlewoman.</p>

  <p>When not reading or occupied with her pupils, she was busy with the little
  arts taught her at the convent, drawing, tapestry, fine sewing, all of which
  well suited her delicate fingers.</p>

  <p>She taught lace-making to the peasant women, introducing <i>le point de
  France</i>, which she said had been brought to the country by a Queen of
  France and by which a poor woman could gain as much as three francs a
  day.</p>

  <p>After her lessons to her little ones she would play with them,
  blind-man's-buff, ring-a-roses, dances; she was gay, light-hearted,
  cheerful&mdash;Mesnil-Imbert was so far from Paris with its gathering storms,
  the pastoral beauty of the fields was so changeless!</p>

  <p>In the old brick <i>colombier</i> where the doves flew in and out of their
  niches she would tell the fair-haired little Normans of the sublime deeds of
  the ancient heroes which might be found in Plutarch and Corneille, teach them
  the grandeur of love, of country, of self-sacrifice, of fortitude. She would
  tell them of the new government in France, which was founded on these pure
  models of antiquity, of the new tribunes of France, the members of the
  <i>Gironde</i>, republicans all worthy of Sparta. Surely these children would
  live to see this glorious dawn increase in power until the beams of brilliant
  day blessed the beloved land! A government modelled on Rousseau, conducted by
  men who were nourished on Marcus Aurelius, who had put up a bust of Brutus in
  the Senate and who had taken as their motto, Liberty or Death!</p>

  <p>The fair eyes of Charlotte de Corday gleamed with ardour as she expounded
  these wonders to her patient little audience in the dovecote, who endured the
  lessons for the sake of the lovely teacher and of the sweetmeats to
  follow.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On the borders of the Rhine, Adam Lux dreamed the same dreams of a golden
  age, as he wandered with his Plutarch or his <i>Contrat Social</i> in his
  hand; he shared to the full the tumult of excitement and admiration created
  among the German intellectuals by the events in France, an enthusiasm
  expressed in the frantic odes of Klopstock, who saw, "with an effusion of joy
  and tears in his eyes," the "audacious diet of Gaul," setting out to reform
  civilisation. He was glad to have lived sixty-four years to see this <i>"plus
  grand acte du siècle,"</i> and transported by his fervour he exclaimed:
  <i>"le soleil monte toujours!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <p>Jean-Paul Marat also became more <i>Rousseauiste</i> than ever, more
  blindly, more fanatically attached to the rights of man. He worked as
  furiously as he had done in his laborious youth, when for three months he had
  toiled twenty-one hours out of the twenty-four at his "Chains of Slavery";
  snatching at cups of black coffee to keep himself awake, falling at last in a
  stupor of exhaustion over the poor desk where he kept the two pistols he had
  ready to greet the police. His paper <i>L'ami du peuple</i> had failed for
  lack of capital soon after it was started in 1789, but had been revived again
  in 1791. After a brief visit to London, the patriot had installed at No. 39,
  <i>rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie</i>, a small printing press and had begun the
  regular issue of his newspaper. He was enabled to do this through the
  devotion of a woman. Hideous, diseased, filthy as he was, suffering in mind
  and body, he won the tender affection and the deep loyalty of a woman
  twenty-six years old, Simonne Evrard, who was of good character and possessed
  a small capital. This she put at the disposal of Marat, and he devoted it all
  to the printing press and the paper. On what he could earn as a journalist
  and on the profits, small indeed at first, of <i>L'ami du peuple</i>, Marat
  set up a poor home with Simonne Evrard and Albertine, his sister, who held
  him in a passionate admiration and contributed to the miserable <i>ménage</i>
  by her exquisite work at watch-making.</p>

  <p>Marat, in the increasing fervour of republicanism and the gradual
  disappearance of the <i>ancien régime</i>, had been able to leave his
  hiding-places and start this little establishment with the two women who held
  him in such admiration and respect; he did not marry Simonne, as he despised
  such conventions as matrimony, but he was grateful to her and offered her all
  that he could offer any woman.</p>

  <p>Not only had she put her entire fortune at his disposal so that he might
  realise the dream of his heart, the publication of the paper, she had, at her
  own peril, hidden him when he had been pursued by the agents of
  Lafayette.</p>

  <p>He espoused Simonne after the manner of Rousseau; taking her hand in his,
  he led her, one day of sunshine, to his open window, and asked her to kneel
  with him before Heaven&mdash;in the presence of the Supreme Being.</p>

  <p>"It is in the vast Temple of Nature," said Marat, "that I take, for
  witness of the eternal fidelity I swear to you, the Creator who hears
  us."</p>

  <p>Both of them kept these unconventional vows; they were as serious, as
  self-centred, as determined as they were poor. Simonne was a respectable,
  comely woman, of decent behaviour, short, with brown eyes and hair, an oval
  face, a high nose, a large mouth, a grave expression. Marat, who seemed to
  his enemies like an obscene toad which had crept up from some stagnant marsh,
  who was in truth so foul in his person that even his friends did not dare sit
  next him on the benches of the Assembly, had aroused in this young woman a
  passion which made her willingly his companion, nurse and servant, cheerfully
  performing the most menial and the most loathsome offices. She was not,
  however, fastidious, and Marat's apartment always had an air of squalor.</p>

  <p>In this year 1791 the cruel disease that had seized Marat was rapidly
  increasing in virulence, encouraged by his filthy habits, his nervous
  tension, his incessant labours.</p>

  <p>He was often in bed for days together with attacks of pain, fevers,
  headaches, and he was never free from the steady torture of a skin disease,
  herpes. He wrote himself of "the long and cruel malady" which tormented him,
  and a notice in a newspaper of July, 1791, mentioned the miserable couch of
  <i>L'ami du peuple,</i> where the patriot lay agonised by <i>"une migraine
  affreuse et dévoré d'une Pyre ardente, la ate enflée comme un boisseau avec
  une fluxion épouvantable sur tout le coté gauche et les vésicatoires sur les
  cuisses, ne pouvant changer d' attitude depuis plusieurs jours."</i></p>

  <p>Nothing could be in more violent contrast to the radiant figure of
  Charlotte de Corday, teaching virtue to her little pupils in the old
  dovecote, or to that of the comely young German in his pure exaltation and
  rustic retreat, than that of Jean-Paul Marat, with his polluted body, ruined
  nerves and half crazy mind, working in his sordid Parisian apartment.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday was an avid reader of newspapers and pamphlets, in
  particular of the Press of the Gironde; she supported this party with all the
  force of her passionate convictions; when the King chose his ministry from
  among them she was full of delight. She followed with eager admiration the
  acts of M. Roland, and of his wife Manon Philipon, muse and priestess of the
  Gironde. These were great men, these were the saviours of their country; she
  mingled their names with those of the heroes of antiquity. She longed
  ardently for an opportunity to do them a service, to express her admiration
  for them, even if need be to sacrifice herself for them, as she had longed to
  sacrifice herself as a child to her sick mother, as a girl to the infirm and
  the poor, as a maiden to God.</p>

  <p>Her nature, always in extremes, saw these men as figures out of the dramas
  of Corneille and as such they passed into her pure and proud reveries.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Who were these amateur senators, the members of the <i>Gironde</i>, who
  had so inflamed the intellectuals of Europe with enthusiasm for their
  patriotic virtues? They were young men (most were under thirty, and none was
  over forty years of age), of middle class, well educated, of high morals,
  fine ideals, full of enthusiasm, courage and good intentions. They were,
  except for the atheism which most of them professed, fanatic followers of J.
  J. Rousseau, and they all carried the prevalent fashion for antiquity to a
  mania. They were more familiar with Greece and Rome than with their own
  provinces, more at home with the heroes of Plutarch than with their own
  countrymen; they were journalists, lawyers, medical students, small squires.
  There was not one man of action among them, but all of them could write and
  talk and their leaders were unsurpassed in brilliant eloquence. All were full
  of theories, of schemes for reform, of noble sentiments, of high ideals. All
  were gentlemen, most of them were good-looking with seductive personalities
  and the attractions of wit, generosity, moving eloquence, graceful delivery,
  elegant gesture, an air of culture and refinement.</p>

  <p>Most conspicuous among them was Pierre-Victorin Vergniaud, thirty-three
  years of age, whose melting and impassioned speeches, contrived with every
  art and composed, it was said, of honey and gold, could affect any audience
  to any purpose. He thought, spoke and acted <i>en romain</i>. He was a gifted
  author and wrote dramatic pieces for his charming mistress, Mlle. de
  Candeille; for the rest he was indolent, sentimental, voluptuous, escaping in
  reveries from the realities he could neither understand nor face. Francois
  Buzot, fiery, sentimental, honourable, Isnard and Grangeneuve, full of force
  and enthusiasm, Brissot de Warville, with his Quaker-like appearance, austere
  life and skilful pen, were other ornaments of the ranks of the
  <i>Gironde</i>. Equal to these in fame were Elie Marguerite Guadet, the thin,
  subtle lawyer, unequalled in sarcasm and bold invective, Armand Gensonné, and
  Charles Barbaroux with his southern eloquence, his "port of a Marc Antony"
  and his daring enthusiasm. He had been a student under Jean-Paul Marat when
  that struggling doctor had tried to add to his resources by holding classes
  for the study of electricity.</p>

  <p>Other prominent members of the <i>Gironde</i> were Jérôme Pétion, who
  exerted a strong influence over his party, and Lanjuinais, who had founded
  the first Jacobin club; the entire group was inspired by an impractical
  philosopher, the Marquis de Condorcet.</p>

  <p>These men, who essayed to govern a nation at a moment of appalling crisis,
  did not number one able politician, nor even one shrewd man of the world in
  their brilliant ranks. They were amateurs in everything save journalism and
  party oratory; often, intoxicated with their own verbiage, they would
  sacrifice a principle for a fine phrase, a truth for a round of applause, and
  leave the Assembly, ashamed of what they had said. Well intentioned, brave
  and attractive as they were, they were fitted for nothing but the static
  poses of the orator addressing the Senate, or the patriot dictating his
  memoirs or scribbling rigmaroles for the Press. They were <i>fanatiques de
  Rousseau</i> without having grasped his teaching (even if that teaching could
  at this juncture be turned to practical account), they were republicans
  without knowing how to form a republic, they were utterly tedious in their
  endless references to Cato, the Gracchi, to Brutus, the father of Roman
  liberty and his stoic namesake; they had so little humour as to term Louis
  XVI Caligula or Tarquin, and yet they had not really studied the antique
  models over which they raved, nor penetrated beneath the surface of those
  classic institutions and events that appeared so perfect from a distance.</p>

  <p>Their attire marked them out from the brocaded, powdered nobles and the
  ragged hordes of the people. They affected that classic simplicity, which was
  to create a uniform dress for all classes, sombre but not unbecoming,
  plainest of coats and breeches, or the new trousers, simple linen cravats,
  with large muslin bows, a toga-like cloak, long hair hanging loose and cut in
  a Brutus fringe, a large leaved hat turned back from the face with the huge
  tricolour cockade or a high-crowned beaver. Their youth, their good
  intentions, their incompetence added to their useless brilliancy, gave them
  that romantic pathos which attaches to the doomed leaders of a lost
  cause.</p>

  <p>Such as they were they satisfied Mlle. de Corday, who, judging them
  largely through their own Press, found no fault with them. It was because of
  her admiration for the <i>Gironde</i> that she came to a disagreement with
  her father. The eldest son had emigrated and had drained the slender family
  resources for his expenses, and M. de Corday had then retired to Argentan,
  where he lived with his two daughters in the <i>rue de Bègle</i>. This small,
  quiet country town, far from even the echo of events and without the
  pleasures and labours of the country, did not suit the growing restlessness
  of Charlotte de Corday; she found there none of the joys of the pastoral, the
  peace of the convent, nor the excitement of the city.</p>

  <p>Besides, dissension appeared for the first time in the poor home; M. de
  Corday remained faithful to the King, to the <i>ancien régime</i>, much as he
  desired reforms, in particular the abolition of the galling feudal system. He
  rebuked his elder daughter for her passionate republicanism, her fiery
  admiration of the <i>Gironde</i>; the gentle Eléonore supported her father;
  the atmosphere became strained, painful. Charlotte obtained permission from
  her father to visit a distant relation, a certain Madame de Bretteville, a
  widow in comfortable circumstances, who lived in retirement at Caen.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Madame de Bretteville inhabited an old and gloomy house, 148, <i>rue
  Saint-Jean</i>, at Caen. This was one of the main streets of the town and ran
  from the river to the citadel; it consisted of aristocratic, though sombre
  and ancient houses, two splendid churches, Saint-Pierre and Saint-Jean, and
  was inhabited by the most snobbish of those patrician families who still
  remained in Caen; it contained the <i>hôtel de Faudoas</i>, where M. de
  Belzunce had walked in the garden with his <i>fiancée</i> shortly before his
  murder; <i>le grand Manoir</i>, the <i>hôtel de Beauvron</i>, several other
  noble mansions; nearby was the <i>hôtel de l'Intendance</i>, the principal
  hostelry of the town.</p>

  <p>No. 148 was situate near the rich and imposing Church of
  <i>Saint-Jean</i>; it was set back in a dark and narrow court in the middle
  of which was a pump; the ground-floor was let to a wood-turner named Lunel,
  who used the premises as a workshop; a narrow door, a corridor led to the
  staircase that ascended to Madame de Bretteville's apartments. The house had
  a balcony on the first floor, was gabled, with a steep roof. The mistress of
  this modest, respectable and aristocratic establishment was a dull, ordinary
  old woman, religious, conventional, correct in everything, feeble in health,
  apathetic in character, much respected by her neighbours as a well-behaved
  person of impeccable morals and good breeding. She had been for some months a
  widow and her life had always been monotonous and dull&mdash;often
  exasperating.</p>

  <p>She had been an heiress, the rich Mlle. Lecoutelier de Bonnebos, a
  neglected child, idle and depressed, growing up at random in the
  establishment of her father, which was ruled over by a succession of
  mistresses. Plain and uninteresting as she was, she might have married
  several times, but her father and the prospective husbands could never agree
  on the amount of her dowry. When she was forty years old, a decayed
  gentleman, M. de Bretteville, offered to take her with a small sum, in view
  of her father's great age and the fortune she would enjoy on his death.</p>

  <p>M. de Bonnebos, however, continued to survive, while the De Bretteville
  <i>ménage</i> sank into poverty and despair, blackened by acrid disputes
  between husband and wife about the longevity of her father.</p>

  <p>"I can't murder him to please you," she would say bitterly.</p>

  <p>The birth of a child added to their difficulties; but while they were
  perplexing themselves as to her future, the girl died, aged seventeen, in
  1789.</p>

  <p>On the very same day, M. de Bonnebos, then aged eighty-nine, married an
  ancient mistress of seventy-six, with whom he had lived for fifty years.</p>

  <p>"I hoped to marry my daughter and bury my father," said Madame de
  Bretteville. "It is the other way about!"</p>

  <p>A few months after his marriage, M. de Bonnebos died, leaving a large
  portion of his fortune to his widow, and to his daughter an income of 40,000
  <i>livres</i>, some valuable furniture and a quantity of diamonds. Timid,
  crushed by ill-fortune, Madame de Bretteville continued to reside in the
  house she had inhabited for years; she added some of her father's costly
  furniture to her modest rooms, wore his rich diamonds on her withered
  fingers, and lived her uneventful effaced existence. Uneducated and idle as
  she was, unable even to sew, not caring to read, she had yet a certain polish
  and elegance&mdash;the allure of a gentlewoman, and knew how to run an
  orthodox establishment.</p>

  <p>This was managed by two confidential servants, the couple Leclerc and a
  maid named Anne Bosquaire. Madame Leclerc was the cook-housekeeper, her
  husband was much in the confidence of his mistress. He was of superior birth,
  his father having been a land surveyor, and was intellectually inclined, fond
  of serious reading, of political argument, a good business man, reliable and
  faithful; he really played the part of secretary or confidential steward to
  Madame de Bretteville without in any way overstepping his place. He had
  studied astronomy and medicine; of firm character and sound judgment, short,
  plain, pale, with high forehead and snub nose; he was the guiding but
  unobtrusive spirit of this precise household.</p>

  <p>The most notable families of Caen visited Madame de Bretteville, dined at
  her well-kept table, or drank tea in her sombre, elegant salon&mdash;the
  families de Faudoas, Hérier, de Loyer, de Tournélis Bougon-Langrais,
  Boisjugan de Maingré, the President of the Assembly and President of the
  Administrative Department of Calvados, the Comte Doulcet de Pontécoulant,
  nephew of the abbess of the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, all the officials and
  notables of Caen in the year 1791. The Norman town had approved with effusion
  the incidents of the Revolution, the taking of the Bastille, <i>La
  Déclaration</i>, the <i>Fête du Champ de Mars</i>. The Normans were mainly in
  sympathy with the <i>Gironde</i>, without relinquishing their moderate and in
  many cases royalist sentiments.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Into this obscure and stately dwelling arrived suddenly Mlle. de Corday,
  with her beauty, her energy, her remarkable personality.</p>

  <p>Madame de Bretteville was amazed to see her, did not at once know
  her&mdash;after all, the relationship was slight, she was Mlle. de Corday's
  aunt <i>a la mode de Bretagne</i>, M. de Corday's cousin in the seventh
  degree. She found this intrusion of youth and beauty into her routine
  startling, but the girl demanded her hospitality and it was offered, though
  with some reserve.</p>

  <p>Madame de Bretteville anxiously confided to a friend that she did not know
  her young visitor from "Adam or Eve," that she resented this sudden
  visit&mdash;she liked ceremony, respect, formality&mdash;besides, there was
  something about the young girl that made her vaguely uneasy&mdash;she was too
  serene, too stately, too reserved&mdash;what reason had she for coming so
  suddenly to Caen?</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday did indeed seem to put out that dim household, as a star
  might outshine a row of candles. Where everything was mediocre, dull, even
  mean and petty, she was in everything remarkable; Madame de Bretteville
  appeared before her like a drab sparrow before a bird of Paradise. An
  eye-witness of her own sex, Madame de Maromme, thus described Charlotte de
  Corday at this time:</p>

  <p>"She had grown very tall and very beautiful, her figure, perfectly formed,
  though a little robust, did not lack nobility; her carnation was of a
  dazzling purity and the most brilliant freshness. Her complexion had the
  transparency of milk, the flush of the rose and the velvetiness of the peach,
  the tissue of the skin was of the greatest fineness&mdash;you could see the
  blood circulating behind the petal of the lily. She blushed very easily and
  then became truly ravishing. Her eyes were deep-set and very beautiful,
  though slightly veiled in expression. Her chin was slightly <i>de galoche</i>
  (prominent), but her countenance was full of charm and distinction. The
  expression of this lovely face was of an ineffable sweetness, as was the
  sound of her voice. Never has been seen an expression more pure, more
  angelic, more candid, nor a smile more attractive. Her golden chestnut hair
  suited admirably with her complexion. She did not hold herself well, her head
  always drooped a little."</p>

  <p>This last defect was common among Norman women. Madame de Bretteville
  received coldly this dazzling creature who came to ask of her an asylum in
  the name of their common ancestor, Corneille; her dry manners were caused
  partly by timidity&mdash;the sensitive girl defended herself by a calm
  serenity, she had early and long learned reserve, control, fortitude.</p>

    <p class="caption">Charlotte De Corday. Portrait by Johann Jakob Hauer.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The prim young housekeeper, Madame Leclerc, showed the unwelcome guest to
  her chamber, using the haughty manners of a spoiled and favourite servant. If
  Mlle. de Corday had expected a warmer welcome, a more agreeable
  establishment, more gaiety and comfort, she concealed her
  disappointment&mdash;she was used to poverty and to the life of a nun.</p>

  <p>The chamber allotted to her was on the first floor with a balcony, giving
  on the courtyard by a tall narrow window with leaded lozenge-shaped panes;
  the floor was paved with bricks, overhead was a ceiling with blackened beams;
  a huge hooded chimney shaded the wide hearth; a faded tapestry was on the
  walls. Madame de Bretteville had not indeed taken much trouble with this
  mournful guest-chamber, in furnishing which neither comfort nor taste had
  been considered, but which had an air of decency and gentility. Two chests of
  drawers, a card-table with a green baize covering, two antique chairs with
  worn damask and fringe, an oak coffer with a dim mirror composed the
  furniture of this room so little suited for the use of a brilliant young
  woman. The bed was old-fashioned, gloomy, with posts, curtains and valances
  in plain damask from which all the colour had faded.</p>

  <p>The window looked on the street and afforded a view of the sombre houses
  opposite, and a street which divided them in which was the <i>hôtel de
  l'Intendance</i>, where strangers came and went. At the side, blocking the
  light, was a building used partly for storing grain, partly as a residence.
  The sun never penetrated this chamber, winter and summer there was an even,
  grey illumination.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday accepted this asylum with resigna tion and dignity; she
  unpacked her trunk and placed on the table beside the bed the Plutarch, the
  Bible, the volumes of J. J. Rousseau and the <i>abbé</i> Raynal she had
  brought with her from Argentan. This last author was more than ever "her
  oracle" by reason of his heroic behaviour. In March, 1791, he had sent a
  letter to the Assembly, warning them of the dangerous direction in which
  affairs were being allowed to drift and rebuking "the tyranny of the people"
  which might be more terrible than the tyranny of kings, and pointing out the
  alarming state of the country, "soldiers without discipline, generals without
  authority, ministers without power&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He then sternly blamed the wild licence of the inflammatory section of the
  Press (of which Marat's <i>L'ami du peuple</i> was a fair specimen), the
  useless metaphysical discussions which served only as germs of disorder, the
  harsh treatment of the King. He pointed out anarchy ahead for France&mdash;"a
  King without power, a people without a bridle." Instead of the people being
  freed, they would in their turn become <i>le tyran le plus féroce</i>. Raynal
  was eighty years of age and had long been one of the prophets of reform, one
  of the most eager friends of liberty. Therefore this grave and bold warning
  filled the Assembly with alarm and dissension. The Right applauded; the Left
  hesitated; the Extremists were furious; Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins,
  Marat violently attacked Raynal as senile and disloyal.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday read the letter (it was printed) with passionate interest;
  one phrase of this author in particular had always rested in her mind: <i>"On
  ne doit pas la vérité a ces tyrans."</i></p>

  <p>She was already familiar with other grand sentiments of this philosopher:
  "Glory belongs to God in heaven, on earth to virtue, not to
  genius&mdash;virtue sublime, startling, benevolent, heroic...this is the
  virtue owned by one who gives his life for his subjects, this is the virtue
  of a people who would rather die free than live as slaves&mdash;the virtue
  not of a Caesar or a Pompey, but of a Cato or a Regulus."</p>

  <p>Was not this an echo of Corneille? Did not Raynal, the great man of the
  moment, confirm Corneille the great man of the past? Republican idealism,
  grand self-sacrifice, magnanimous love of country, of <i>goodness</i>.</p>

  <p>And if Mlle. de Corday shared the admirations of this <i>fanatique par
  humanité</i> she also shared his hatreds. With what scorn and loathing did
  she regard those whose excesses were already staining the glories of 1789,
  those furious scribblers, those venomous orators who were arousing the people
  to blind fury! Foremost amongst them and typifying them all, she saw
  Jean-Paul Marat, the dwarf, the monster with his misshapen body and mask of
  satyr, covered with sores, in his filthy clothes, two pistols in his belt,
  his bare legs thrust into broken boots, a dirty rag round his brows, inciting
  to anarchy, to blood, to ruin, destroying the work, overturning the ideals of
  the <i>Girondists</i>, the true Republicans, the saviours of their country,
  full of antique virtue.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday had a small allowance from her father and a modest store
  of clothes; her expenses were low, but she was poor, almost existing on
  charity since Madame de Bretteville continued to offer her hospitality, but
  coldly and without affection. Thus driven in on herself the sensitive ardent
  girl turned more and more to her reading; pamphlets, brochures, newspapers
  accounted for most of her modest pocket money.</p>

  <p>She was a subscriber to the press of the <i>Gironde: La Gazette
  Quotidienne, Le Courrier Français, Le Courrier Universel, Le Courrier des
  Départements, Le Patriote Français</i>; from these she drew strong
  nourishment for both her admirations and her hates.</p>

  <p>Like Madame Roland with her hair cut <i>à la Titus</i> and her Grecian
  robes, this girl believed that she was living in the times she adored; also
  like Madame Roland, she preferred to think of herself under masculine times;
  hero was to her a nobler term than heroine, and those antique women whom she
  most admired, the Emilias, Cornelias, Livias, Judiths, Jaels, were those who
  had least of the feminine in their composition.</p>

  <p>Yet in herself, and unknown to herself, Mlle. de Corday was touchingly
  feminine, in her exalted enthusiasm, in her compassion, in the nervous
  fortitude with which she covered her sensitiveness, in her dreams of the
  heroic and sublime, and, most of all, in her judgment, so perilously based on
  sentiment and emotion.</p>

  <p>The first awkwardness of her residence in the <i>rue Saint-Jean</i> was
  broken by the arrival of two ladies, mother and daughter, Madame and Mlle. de
  Loyer, whom she had known when she had lived in the <i>Buttes de
  Saint-Gilles</i> at Caen; the younger had sometimes been a fellow-pupil in
  her lessons with her uncle.</p>

  <p>"What! do you not know me?" she cried joyously. "It is the little
  d'Armont!"</p>

  <p>They had not indeed known her, for they had not seen her since she had
  been at the convent, and the beautiful creature startled them; they received
  her with an affection that moved Madame de Bretteville in her niece's favour.
  The old lady gave the girl several handsome dresses and paid for lessons for
  her&mdash;dancing, music, deportment; the dull and timid widow had no
  affection to give, but she tolerated Mlle. de Corday because of her rank and
  their relationship.</p>

  <p>The well-bred girl was warmly received into what remained of society at
  Caen; she sparkled at several aristocratic dinner-tables and in <i>salons</i>
  where the questions of the day, so vital, so terrible, were being discussed.
  Her young friend loosened her splendid ringlets, threaded a glittering ribbon
  through them, arranged a fichu of lace round her shoulders, a rose on her
  bosom, and the nun was transformed into a polished young aristocrat.</p>

  <p>But Mlle. de Corday was still gravely absorbed in her reveries, disdainful
  of the world. She would, when in company, suddenly rouse herself from a
  day-dream to pronounce a glowing eulogy on some classic hero or heroine of
  her choice until her friend Mlle. de Loyer lovingly checked her, warning her
  that she would be considered, in the opinion of ordinary people, odd; after
  this, she would, when tempted to betray her feelings, restrain herself,
  blushing, on a glance from her friend, but she retained these deep emotions,
  none the less, passionately locked in her heart.</p>

  <p>Apart from this social life there was not much for Mlle. de Corday to do
  in Caen, no outlet for her energy, no scope for her talents, no prospects of
  anything in the future beyond this respectable, dull life of a poor
  gentlewoman in attendance on an elderly and indifferent relative.</p>

  <p>They were long days when there were no visits to be paid or received, when
  in these large gloomy rooms in this sombre house in this dull provincial
  town, the young girl sat in the eclipse of idleness. The prim establishment
  ran without her assistance; three efficient servants, a mistress who gave
  little trouble; a monotony of small events made up the tedious days.</p>

  <p>Often the brilliant young woman would sit down to the neat meals along
  with her small, hunch-backed hostess with her faded features, winged cambric
  caps and widow's attire, with her diamonds and her air of timidity and
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>The meals would be served slowly, with formal ceremony, with handsome
  crystal and silver, the dog and the cat would sit either side of their
  mistress's chair waiting for tit-bits, Madame de Bretteville's only smiles
  were for Minette, her only caresses for Azor; a few remarks, peevish,
  glacial, or trite, were offered now and then to her companion, whose
  demeanour was always sweet and respectful, but who refused to flatter or to
  hide her opinions.</p>

  <p>The meal over, and the duties that Madame de Bretteville demanded had been
  attended to, the girl would escape to her sad chamber and lose herself in
  dreams which shone the brighter for contrast with the poor mediocrity of her
  life.</p>

  <p>Taught never to be idle, she would endeavour to beguile tedious boredom by
  sewing, lace-making, drawing, writing verses, but all was, to her, a sham;
  she worked without purpose or direction, and often the needle or the pencil
  would drop from her hand and she would pick up a newspaper or a pamphlet to
  read once more the terrible news from Paris.</p>

  <p>In blood, fire, thunder, the year 1792 passed over France. In September,
  the Legislative Assembly fell and was replaced by the Convention, composed of
  seventy-two deputies who abolished all titles, decided that the year 1792 was
  the Year I of the Republic, One and Indivisible, and who were divided into
  three main parties, the <i>Gironde</i>, under Brissot, the <i>Montagne</i>,
  so called from the high-placed seats the deputies of the Extreme Left
  occupied in the Senate and the <i>Centre, Plaine</i> or <i>Marais</i>.
  Prominent among the <i>Montagnards</i> were Danton, Robespierre, Jean-Paul
  Marat, the Secretary of the Commune, one of the representatives of Paris; the
  situation soon resolved itself into a struggle between these two opposing
  parties, the moderates and idealists, the extremists and realists; the fate
  of the King became of paramount importance; the <i>Gironde</i> would have
  saved him, though they knew that the <i>émigrés</i> and the foreign armies
  which threatened France, the King's allies, would, if they could, destroy
  them; true to a principle, they remained indifferent to their own interest,
  their own safety. With equal heroism and sincerity, the <i>Montagne</i> were
  resolved on the extreme step of the death of the King as a symbol of the
  extinction of royalty, as a gage of defiance to Europe. This struggle took
  place in the midst of a country hovering on the brink of anarchy and
  bankruptcy and threatened by a foreign invasion on all sides; a growing sense
  of tension, a deepening horror, gripped the nation; steadily the nobility
  crept away to the Rhine, where the army of Condé gathered daily in numbers if
  not in strength. A sense of impending disaster was in the air as if the bold
  prophecies of the <i>abbé</i> Raynal were about to be fulfilled.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>It was supposed in the society of Caen that Mlle. de Corday would marry;
  several eligible men were discussed by Madame de Bretteville and her
  cronies.</p>

  <p>But Mlle. de Corday, always reserved, discreet, though often gay and
  witty, kept all suggestions of marriage, all proposals at a distance, never a
  hint of a romance, a coquetry, a sentimental friendship touched her life,
  which still had about it the loofty calm of the convent.</p>

  <p>But those who loved her could never forget her; two men carried about with
  them her little formal notes of courtesy, her portrait secretly commissioned,
  and were, when their ends came, buried with these souvenirs over their dead
  hearts.</p>

  <p>With some of the men whom she met in Caen Mlle. de Corday permitted a
  reserved platonic affection; two of her friends she regarded with esteem, and
  when they were parted, one from the other, exchanged with them a long
  correspondence on matters of philosophy, politics and ethics.</p>

  <p>These two gentlemen were M. Boisjugan de Maingré and M. Bougon Langrais.
  With both the attraction, on her part, was purely intellectual; she admired
  them for their views, their conduct, their ideas, and nothing in her manner
  towards them, or in her correspondence with them, was tender, intimate or
  passionate.</p>

  <p>M. Bougon Langrais was a high official of the departmental administration
  of Calvados, distinguished, cultured, delicate, imbued with the ideals of
  Greece and Rome; his manners were grave and amiable; he was twenty-seven, but
  his office and his disposition made him appear older than his years. M.
  Boisjugan de Maingré was a young nobleman whose acquaintance with Mlle. de
  Corday was brief; he left the country, returned, was caught with arms in his
  hand and shot as a proscribed <i>émigré</i> in 1792. This murder, like that
  of M. de Belzunce, deepened, if it were possible to deepen, Mlle. de Corday's
  horror of violence and anarchy, and accentuated her melancholy sense of the
  doom awaiting the young and the ardent in this epoch of terror.</p>

  <p>Yet she had not loved, even in a romantic sense, either of these men; they
  were too far below her ideals. She resigned herself to celibacy; she did not
  wish to surrender her freedom to anyone. "Never," she wrote to a friend,
  "will you have to put 'Madame' on my letters, never will I renounce my
  precious liberty, my independence."</p>

  <p>She believed that the only kind of marriage to which she could have
  submitted, the only kind of man to whom she could have given her sincere
  vows, was not to be found in the commonplace world she inhabited. She
  resigned herself, but this resignation added to the melancholy that increased
  daily behind her gaiety, her dutiful sweetness, her pious calm.</p>

  <p>She had wished to devote all the ardours of her soul to God, but the
  convent doors had been closed to her; she had hoped there might be some
  sublime human passion on which she might bestow these enthusiasms&mdash;but
  she found no object worthy of what she knew she had to give. All the emotion,
  then, of which she was capable, was turned to love of her country.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1792 the profound disturbances that shook France were
  felt in Normandy, in Caen; several families of Madame de Bretteville's
  acquaintance decided to emigrate; others came in from the country to the
  protection of the town&mdash;their <i>châteaux</i> were being burnt, the
  peasants were rising, the government's authority daily weakened.</p>

  <p>The family of Tournélis decided to leave Caen (a M. de Tournélis had been
  suggested as a possible husband for Mlle. de Corday), the family Loyer made
  preparations to go to Rouen; insecurity was felt everywhere. Madame de
  Bretteville was thrown into a pitiful state of alarm; she, too, wished to
  fly, but had not the courage to move. She was in such a nervous state that
  she could not bring herself to contemplate crossing the bridge of boats
  across the river&mdash;a <i>détour</i> by Paris was worse. Her friends could
  not persuade her to move; she remained, paralysed by terror, in her sombre
  rooms, with Minette and Azor, with the servants to whom she no longer dared
  to give orders, but who must be addressed as citizen and citizeness.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday wrote to her school friend, Mlle. Loyer, afterwards Madame
  Maromme, who had left Caen, of the pitiful condition of her aunt:</p>

  <p><i>"Would we had a magic ring with which to build her a solid bridge!...If
  I were near you, I should again become your scholar and I should promise more
  attention to your lessons&mdash;perhaps then I should find, in the study of
  literature and of languages, in your friendship and that of your kind mother,
  forgetfulness of all the tediums</i> (les ennuis) <i>to which I have been a
  prey for so long. When the present offers nothing and there is no future one
  must take refuge in the past and look there for the ideal life that does not
  exist in reality."</i></p>

  <p>To relieve these "tediums" she studied English and Italian, to try to be
  of some use she exerted herself in favour of the monks and nuns who were
  homeless and often penniless through the closing of the convents.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Madame de Bretteville gave a farewell dinner to such of her friends as had
  resolved to leave Caen and invited M. de Corday and his two children to join
  the party. Francois-Charles de Corday and the M. de Tournélis who had been a
  pretender to the hand of Charlotte were intending to join the army of
  Condé&mdash;"the old white flag of France" on the banks of the Rhine; the
  elder son, Jacques-Francois de Corday, was already at Coblenz.</p>

  <p>M. de Corday received his daughter with the warmest affection which she
  eagerly returned; it was a charming family reunion; all disagreements and
  vexations were forgotten, all troubles too. Youth, gaiety, high spirits
  triumphed over everything, even over the fearful apprehensions of Madame de
  Bretteville and the sombre monotony of her mournful chambers. This youthful
  enthusiasm gave a rosy illusion to the future, the young men spoke of their
  journey to the Rhine as of a pleasure trip, the women spoke of welcoming them
  back to an era of peace and prosperity.</p>

  <p>One who was present has left a description of Mile. de Corday as she was
  on that joyous evening, discussing with M. de Tournélis her beloved Rome and
  Sparta:</p>

  <p>"She was ravishingly beautiful&mdash;I see her now before my eyes, wearing
  a dress of rose taffetas, striped with white, over a petticoat of white silk;
  her rich shape was marvellously set off by this <i>toilette</i> which suited
  her to perfection. A rose-coloured riband was threaded through her tresses
  and harmonised with the roses of her complexion, deeper than ordinary because
  of the meeting with her father and the excitement of finding herself in the
  midst of her family. She appeared, on that evening, an ideal creature."</p>

  <p>One little incident only spoiled the harmony of that charming dinner
  party; the health of the King was given and Mlle. de Corday's glass was not
  raised; all glanced at her reproachfully, her father with severity; Madame de
  Loyer whispered to her not to refuse to drink to a King so virtuous. "I
  believe him good," replied Mlle. de Corday, blushing and in a low voice, "but
  what virtue is there in a weak King? He is nothing but a misfortune to his
  people."</p>

  <p>Such, given some years later, was the opinion of Napoléon I.</p>

  <p>The young girl refused to drink, and, after a moment's awkward silence,
  the light, gay talk was resumed. It was again disturbed and this time more
  seriously.</p>

  <p>Bishop Fauchet, representing the <i>nouveau clergé constitutionnel</i>,
  took, this evening, his departure from Caen, enthusiastically supported by
  followers; he had been recently elected Bishop of Calvados, and had come to
  Saint-Pierre to preach on Christian charity and to oust the legitimate holder
  of the see. He was famous for his eloquence and frequently took as his text:
  <i>"Frères, les Français sont libres!"</i> or <i>"les tyrans sont
  morts!"</i></p>

  <p>The noise in the street broke up the dinner-party, everyone crowded to the
  window, and the two young royalists, M. de Corday and M. de Tournélis, wished
  to rush into the street to protest against the shouts of the mob acclaiming
  the revolutionary Bishop. The other guests drew them back from the window,
  Mlle. de Corday restraining in particular M. de Tournélis.</p>

  <p>"A bravado of this sort might be fatal to us all!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You," he replied, "offended everyone just now in order to be true to
  <i>your</i> sentiments when you refused to drink to the King. May I not avow
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"My action," she said smiling, "could only compromise myself&mdash;yours
  would risk the lives of everyone about you!"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>With the departure of these friends from Caen and the return of her father
  to Argentan, Mlle. de Corday's life became even more quiet; there were so
  many mansions closed in the town; there were the convents and monasteries
  with "National property" daubed over them, there were fewer people to whom to
  talk, and there was the increasing terror of Madame de Bretteville, the
  increasing isolation of the dark house. And always, from far and near,
  rumours of approaching insurrection, anarchy, invasion, a toppling
  government.</p>

  <p>The lonely young girl wrote long letters to her departed friends, in
  particular to Mlle. de Loyer, her companion of school days, then at Rouen.
  They were sad letters, full of <i>"contempt for life, disdain of an existence
  without purpose, the complete disenchantment of a spirit that finds itself
  deceived after having cherished long and delicious illusions."</i></p>

  <p>Speaking of the desolation in Caen, she wrote: <i>"If the grass does not
  grow in the streets it is because the season is not here&mdash;there is a
  general flight from the town and so we are at least in less danger of an
  insurrection."</i> She had little hope of any good coming from the
  <i>émigrés</i> on the Rhine whom her two brothers had joined: <i>"They are
  not disciplined, but the ideal of liberty gives them some courage&mdash;and,
  at a pinch, despair will serve...What fate awaits us? A fearful
  despotism&mdash;if they cannot control the people, we shall escape Charybdis
  only to be devoured by Scylla. There is nothing ahead but suffering&mdash;but
  lamentations do not help us."</i></p>

  <p>These letters breathe nostalgia and resignation.</p>

  <p><i>"We are almost alone&mdash;what would you? I am charmed to think that
  you are happily domiciled again in your own country&mdash;for here we are
  menaced, any moment, with a revolt. One can only die once, and what fortifies
  me against the horrors of the situation is that no one will lose anything in
  losing me."</i></p>
  <hr>

  <p>Often Mlle. de Corday would sit in the shadows of her room as evening fell
  and listen to the sounds of a violin and clavecin that came from a
  neighbouring house. There was still, in the half deserted, menaced and
  frightened town, someone to make music. The lovely sounds fell soothingly on
  the fiery energy that burned behind her sad resignation and touched her
  dreams to gold. "Ah, had I lived then, I might have been happy, I might have
  been loved."</p>

  <p>As Pauline dreamed of Severus Mlle. de Corday dreamed of some demi-god,
  grave, stately, gracious, posed for a sublime action; such a one would alone
  be worthy of her love. Love? She did not use the word, even in her thoughts;
  her soul was as virginal as her body, the ideal companionship that she
  imagined did not touch on an embrace, a kiss.</p>

  <p>But the dream was poignant enough to make the reality bitter.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, seated in that sombre, alien chamber, offered her out of a cold
  regard that was almost charity, listening to the music stealing in upon her,
  she wept, though all traces of tears were removed by the time she went
  downstairs to sit with Madame de Bretteville cowering in the winged-chair
  between Azor and Minette.</p>

  <p>"You are crazy," one of her friends rallied her, "to think so much of the
  past&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," she smiled. "I wish that I had lived in the times of Sparta or
  Athens&mdash;then there were some courageous women."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Almost the same process was taking place in the soul of Adam Lux as he
  looked up from his Plutarch and Rousseau on the same world as that which met
  the sad gaze of Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>The young German had followed the progress of the revolution with zealous
  interest; for him it was exactly what it was for her, a glorious dawn, and he
  devoted himself, body and soul, to the principles of the Declaration of
  Rights. Active where she was inactive, he was a prominent <i>clubiste</i> and
  became well known in Mayence for his lively eloquence, his singlemindedness,
  his enthusiasm and his high ideals. "I have," he declared with perfect
  sincerity, "a violent hatred of tyranny and injustice under any form."</p>

  <p>When war was declared, the sympathy of Lux, as that of many of his
  countrymen, was with the French; he wished Mayence to be attached to the
  great and splendid nation that would arise from the events of 1789, '90,
  '91.</p>

  <p>"Nations have always been strongest when breaking their chains!" he cried;
  like the <i>Girondists</i>, whom he so greatly admired, he had the talent for
  the fine phrase, an endless flow of eloquence, a facile pen; <i>"paysan
  philosophique,"</i> he described himself in the list of the members of the
  club to which he belonged, he encouraged his nephew to roam in the forest
  reading Ossian instead of studying&mdash;"sentiment is more useful in forming
  a man than is knowledge." But Adam Lux could be energetic; he took a definite
  part in the politics of Mayence, which was beginning to affect his own modest
  affairs.</p>

  <p>In September, 1792, he wrote to his sister-in-law that his finances were
  nearly exhausted, that the taxes were being increased, that the oppression of
  the government was in crying contradiction to the new political doctrines,
  that clumsy means were being taken to deceive the people, while the forced
  levies of recruits were causing grave discontent.</p>

  <p>In October, 1792, General Comte Adam Custine, at the head of the French
  republican troops, took possession of Mayence; Adam Lux was among those who
  received him with applause. His friends advised him to return to his farm and
  not to meddle in public affairs which seemed so dark and so
  uncertain&mdash;after all, the golden age might not be so near, the King of
  France was in peril of his life in Paris, and the <i>Gironde</i> was
  weakening before the <i>Mountain</i>. Adam Lux replied in those terms of
  antique simplicity that would have pleased Mlle. de Corday:</p>

  <p>"Even if we fail&mdash;or perish, our efforts will leave some result
  behind&mdash;when there are many seeds sown, some plants must come up.
  Posterity will blame those who remained idle in such a time as this&mdash;I
  do not wish to incur that blame."</p>

  <p>He soon became one of the most powerful, impressive and popular orators of
  the club and used his considerable influence in favour of the French. Custine
  appointed a Provisional Administration for Mayence, and this passed a
  resolution that the electorate should be united to France under the name of
  the department of Bouches-du-Rhin.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux and several of his friends were entrusted with the task of
  touring the country to induce the inhabitants to vote for France. In his own
  village he set up the tree of liberty, helped by the pastor and a young
  student, while the country people went up to the town hall to inscribe in a
  red book "the names of free men." Lux's eloquence was so effective that out
  of two hundred and twenty-three people, two hundred and thirteen signed, and
  the following memorial was sent to Custine:</p>

  <p>"Our shepherd has left his flock without help, the German Empire has
  neither force nor power, the Emperor cannot even defend the Low Countries,
  and we accept the fraternity offered us by the victorious French, as long as
  they show themselves true friends and undertake to give the people a sound
  government."</p>

  <p>Returning to Mayence, Lux wrote and lectured in the cause of France, being
  particularly successful in gaining converts among his friends, professors and
  students at the university.</p>

  <p>A Convention for the Rhine Province, in imitation of that of Paris, being
  decided upon, Lux took a prominent part in the elections. At Spires he and
  his colleagues met with some opposition, and the French commandant had to
  bring cannon into the street before the inhabitants were persuaded that they
  wished to be annexed to France. But the eloquence, obvious sincerity, good
  faith and personal charm of the young man did much towards inclining the
  electors to accept this new form of government. Nor did his zeal stop at
  speeches; in virtue of the decree that ordered the removal of <i>"tous les
  restes du despotisme,"</i> he made it his business to see that all the
  armorial bearings on the noble houses at Spires were removed.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Convention rhéno-germanique</i> was elected Adam Lux took his
  seat as deputy for the village of Volxheim. The first act of the Convention
  was to vote all the country between Landau and Bingen "free," i.e., of the
  Emperor and the Elector. Adam Lux rose to suggest that this little republic,
  <i>Convention national des Allemands libres</i>, should be incorporated with
  the French Republic.</p>

  <p>This was in March, 1793. Louis XVI had been beheaded in January and his
  fearful cry as he was swung under the guillotine knife had echoed throughout
  Europe, raising indignation and horror in all feeling hearts. Raising doubt
  as to the future, too&mdash;the <i>Gironde</i> could not save the King; could
  they save themselves?</p>

  <p>And if the <i>Gironde</i> went, who would stem the tide of anarchy?</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday wept when she learned of the death of the man whose
  toast she had refused to honour. She wrote thus to Mlle. Rose Fougeron du
  Foyot:</p>

  <p><i>"You have heard the frightful news, my dear Rose, and your heart, as
  mine, must have trembled with indignation&mdash;France is indeed delivered
  over to the scoundrels who have already done us such harm. God knows when
  this will stop. I know your sentiments and so can write freely what I think.
  I shudder with horror and indignation. Such an event prepares us for the most
  frightful possibilities in the future. It is obvious that nothing more
  unhappy could have happened. I am almost reduced to envy those among our
  relations who have left the country, so much do I despair of the return of
  that tranquillity which, only a little while ago, I thought possible.
  Everyone who could have given us liberty is being assassinated. These men are
  mere butchers! Weep for the fate of our poor France. I know that you are very
  sad and I would not increase your sorrows by a recital of mine. All my
  friends are being persecuted and my aunt subjected to all sorts of trouble,
  because it is known that she sheltered Delphin</i> [Mlle. de Corday's uncle,
  Delphin Boussaton de Belleisle] <i>when he passed through here on his way to
  England. I should follow him if I could. But God keeps us here for other
  destinies...We are here a prey to brigands of all colours, they leave no one
  in peace, it is enough to give one a horror of this Republic...in brief,
  after this terrible blow</i> [execution of the King] <i>which frightens the
  universe, pity me, my dear Rose, as I pity you, as I pity myself, for there
  is no generous and sensitive heart that must not weep tears of
  blood."</i></p>

  <p>Adam Lux, not so near the centre of affairs, did not see so clearly as
  Charlotte de Corday; still not disillusioned, he, a few weeks after she wrote
  this letter, thus addressed the Convention in Mayence:</p>

  <p>"Oh, my country, without France you resemble a feeble orphan who will soon
  be enslaved by his neighbours and by strangers! But, see! A tender and
  powerful mother offers to adopt you&mdash;she assures you that she will
  fulfil towards you all maternal duties&mdash;do not hesitate, then, to run to
  her arms! Brothers, long live the French Republic!"</p>

  <p>The resolution of union with France was passed with acclamation in the
  <i>Convention rhéno-germanique</i> and Mayence saw herself, in the glowing
  words of Adam Lux, as part of a <i>masse redoutable</i> opposed to a
  coalition of despots.</p>

  <p>Lux, Forster and Pocki were sent to Paris to carry the decree to the
  Convention. On March 30th the three Germans appeared before the Senate (as it
  was to them) and the President, Jean Debrez, gave them the kiss of
  fraternity. Afterwards they were received warmly at the Jacobin Club, where
  they swore to live as republicans or to die.</p>

  <p>Their duty accomplished, they wished to return to Mayence, but the German
  army blocked the way; everything was, indeed, as Lux had been warned by his
  friends it might be, dark and uncertain.</p>

  <p>The <i>Montagne</i> was beginning to mutter that the <i>Girondists</i>
  were agents of Pitt and Coburg, the loyalty of the <i>Gironde</i> General,
  Dumouriez, victor of Jemappes and Valmy, was suspected. Did he wish, under
  the excuse of avoiding anarchy, to make the young Duc de Chartres, son of
  "Citizen Prince" (the <i>duc</i> d'Orléans), King? These, the bitterest of
  the bitterest questions of the moment, disturbed the Assembly and distracted
  the people.</p>

  <p>The three deputies from Mayence were thus reduced to inactivity and
  poverty; when news came through the blockaded routes Lux learned that his
  little property at Kostheim had been burnt, Forster that his had been
  threatened. The Convention allowed them each, in <i>assignats</i>,
  twenty-eight <i>livres</i> a week; with the <i>louis d'or</i> at a hundred
  <i>livres</i> it was not much, but the young Germans contrived to live on it
  in their modest <i>hôtels</i>.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux lived with Forster in the <i>hôtel des patriotes hollandais, rue
  des Moulins</i>. He talked with the other Germans he found in Paris: Oelsner,
  Kerner; he wandered in the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i> with his Rousseau, his
  Plutarch, his newspaper; he mused and dreamed under the shade of an oak or by
  a lake&mdash;there was nothing else for him to do. "His brow was without a
  cloud, his voice tranquil and thoughtful, and his serious glance was full of
  a brilliant serenity, the reflection of the calm of his soul," wrote his
  friend Kerner.</p>

  <p>The young German, musing in the woods and fields outside Paris, had come
  to where he was to meet Charlotte de Corday, of whom, as yet, he had not
  heard.</p>

  <p>She, too, in this month of April, 1793, took a step along the road that
  was to bring them together.</p>

  <p>On April 8th, she procured a passport in order to visit her father at
  Argentan; on April 23rd she accompanied a friend, Madame de Beaumont, to the
  town hall; this lady decried a passport for Paris. Mlle. de Corday decided to
  have hers <i>viséd</i> for the capital, in case of need. This passport
  read:</p>

  <p>"Allow to pass the citizeness Marie Cordai [sic] native of Mesnil-Imbert,
  domiciled at Caen department of Calvados, twenty-four years old, height five
  feet one inch [<i>cinq pieds une pouce</i>], hair and brow chestnut
  [<i>châtains</i>], eyes grey, forehead high, nose large, mouth medium, chin
  round, cleft [<i>fourchu</i>], face oval. Give all assistance she may require
  in case of need on her route to Argentan.</p>

  <p>"Given at '<i>la Maison Commune de Caen</i>,' April 8th, 1793, the IInd
  year of the French Republic, by me, Fossey, the elder, registrar
  [<i>greffier</i>].</p>

  <p>"Signed by me, the clerk and the said Citizeness Corday.</p>

  <p>"Marie Corday.<br>
  "Henri, clerk."</p>

  <p>The visa ran: "Passed at Caen, for a journey to Paris, April 23rd, 1793,
  the IInd year of the Republic&mdash;Euguelland, registrar."</p>

  <hr style="width:25%">
  <br>

  <p class="first">The "brilliant serenity" of Adam Lux was soon disturbed; he
  had not been more than a few days in Paris before he began to feel a strange
  uneasiness. A bitter disillusionment began to creep over the dreams that had
  been so bright. Was this the Republic modelled on Sparta, Athens, Rome? Were
  these the senators who aspired to be Catos or Ciceros? Where was a
  Cincinnatus, a Brutus, a Manlius, a Gracchus? Where in this great city, where
  half the inhabitants were famishing, where vice was flamboyant, where there
  was little law or order, where all the elegance, authority and dignity of the
  <i>ancien regime</i> had been swept away, but all its squalor, injustice,
  folly remained, was that ideal government which, viewed from the banks of the
  Rhine, had seemed so dazzling?</p>

  <p>In April, 1793, Paris was a city calculated to dispel the most obstinate
  of romantic dreams. The nobility, who had given the capital all its
  brilliancy, all its purpose and importance, had disappeared; they had either
  been Murdered, emigrated to the army of Condé, or lay hid with impudent
  cunning in some poor lodging, garret or cellar, where they contrived to evade
  the inefficient police that intermittently searched for them and only
  occasionally caught them.</p>

  <p>All the palaces, all the great <i>hôtels</i> that had been the scenes of
  so much elegant, charming and expensive life, were closed, most of them
  sacked, with "National property" daubed over the walls. The churches were
  shut, dismantled, the convents and monasteries deserted, but the brothels and
  gambling hells were open. In the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal (Palais
  Egalité)</i> every species of luxury and vice was eagerly traded in; men of
  every shade of political opinion tried to forget their danger, their hopes,
  their misery with drink, with the cards, with debauchery. The <i>filles
  publiques</i> often concealed, in the rooms a Republican paid for, some
  mocking noble whose vast mansion stood empty a few yards away.</p>

  <p>Much had been destroyed&mdash;what was to take its place?</p>

  <p>The bright promise had not been fulfilled. Adam Lux could not forget that
  ten thousand prisoners had been murdered by "a handful of scoundrels" in '91,
  nor the King, who, to the horror of the nation, had been brutally
  sacrificed&mdash;nor men like the Duc de La Rochefoucauld, first and most
  enlightened of the Liberal peers, who had been assassinated at Gisors. From
  all over the country came tales of blood and fire, wrong and misery. Where,
  in such a scene, was there room for the "goodness of man," the moral law, the
  peaceful rustic felicity imagined by J. J. Rousseau, or those sublime virtues
  which the intellectuals of 1787 had inherited from Greece and Rome?</p>

  <p>Adam Lux looked with despair even at those whom he had most admired, the
  true Republicans, the men of antique mould, the cultured idealists of the
  <i>Gironde</i>. He had soon been disillusioned with the <i>Jacobins</i>; he
  attended only one of their meetings, where he found nothing talked of but
  atrocities; and his attendance at the meetings of the Convention, which then
  had moved from the <i>salle de manège</i> in the "palace of liberty" to a
  gloomy Medicean room in the <i>Tuileries</i>, the gorgeous palace of the
  Bourbons, so recently the scene of bloody fighting, brought him no greater
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>With famine at the door and the enemy on the frontier, an insurrection in
  La Vendée and no settled system of government, the meetings of the
  representatives of the people could be no other than confused and stormy,
  bitter and violent.</p>

  <p>The external situation, to which enthusiasts like Adam Lux and Mlle. de
  Corday gave no thought, was appalling. England blockaded the coast, Spain
  held the Pyrenees, Austria was menacing on the Alps, Russia with the
  Netherlands was ready to strike on the Northern frontier; it was reckoned in
  Paris that nearly three hundred thousand men were in arms against the One and
  Indivisible Republic. Added to these threats and dangers, which might indeed
  appear overwhelming to a country in a state of chaos, was the doubt, strongly
  felt by many, as to the loyalty of Dumouriez, the Republican General who had
  saved France at Valmy and Jemappes. He was of the party of the
  <i>Gironde</i>, he was suspected of resenting the execution of the King, the
  rigorous imprisonment of the Queen, and it was declared by his enemies that
  not only was he plotting to put the crown on the head of the young Duc de
  Chartres, whose father, <i>Philippe le Rouge</i>, sat on the Left, but that
  he was prepared to sell France to the Allies.</p>

  <p>Anxiously Adam Lux searched the benches of the senate for the man of
  antique virtue and sublime courage who should save not only France but
  Europe, not only Europe but civilisation. Keenly he scanned the ranks of the
  <i>Gironde</i>; he found nothing to blame in their principles, their
  behaviour, nothing to scorn in their talents; he thought them worthy, by
  their merits, their gifts, to found and sustain a free State. But their
  inaction troubled him; he feared that they were in danger of being
  overwhelmed; sitting after sitting that he attended passed in furious
  disputes, bitter reproaches, maddening confusions.</p>

  <p>Houssman, formerly Commissioner of the Convention to the Rhine country
  (<i>le pays rhénan</i>), introduced Adam Lux to several members of the
  <i>Mountain</i>; he admired their ferocious sincerity, their republican zeal,
  but he was repelled by their violence and mistrusted their judgment; soon he
  was attached: <i>"par un noble lien, par l'amour ardent et désintéressé de la
  République"</i> to the <i>Gironde</i>.</p>

  <p>The ardent young man, himself comely, eloquent, who had never had an evil
  thought and who was inspired by such altruistic principles, found it easy to
  admire and to idealise many of the striking personalities of the Right. He
  was not fortunate in obtaining their notice. The virtuous Roland had no
  leisure for the ardent foreigner who also escaped the attention of the fair
  and fervent Manon; had Madame Roland's glance fallen at this period on the
  young enthusiast from Mayence, she might have found him not unworthy of a
  place in the heart which was so warmly disposed towards Barbaroux and
  Buzot.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux contrived, however, to gain the acquaintance of Jérôme Pétion and
  Elie Guadet; from these two members of the <i>Gironde</i> the eager German
  endeavoured to discover the opinion of their party on the future of the
  Convention and of France.</p>

  <p>He was rebuffed by the civil evasions of the two deputies, who were not
  disposed to admit him into their confidence.</p>

  <p>Pétion and Guadet were, indeed, in a state of acute anxiety; in common
  with the other members of the Right they saw the country falling into
  complete anarchy, with the encouragement of the terrible <i>Mountain</i>, and
  at last, after months of speeches, writing, debate, argument, they found
  themselves face to face with action&mdash;crude, violent, horrible, which
  they feared would overwhelm them.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The situation that Adam Lux viewed closely Mlle. de Corday saw only from a
  distance, through the medium of journals, pamphlets, from the lips of those
  few acquaintances she had who came and went from Paris to Caen.</p>

  <p>But her reaction was the same as his; from her reading and listening she
  put together the same picture as did Lux, almost a daily spectator of the
  sittings of the Convention, and, like the German, she cherished a great
  hatred and a great admiration: hatred for the infernal forces led by Danton,
  Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat, Couthon, Hébert; admiration for the
  <i>Girondists</i> who were making a stand against them.</p>

  <p>In April came terrible news to a country that seemed already too wretched
  for any further misfortune to befall. General Dumouriez, Commander-in-Chief
  of the Republican forces, endeavoured to desert with his army to the enemy.
  His troops refused to follow him and he fled, with less than two thousand of
  his men, to the Austrian headquarters at Tournay.</p>

  <p>France was, therefore, without any organised defence and the most bitter
  taunts were thrown by the <i>Montagne</i> at the
  <i>Gironde</i>&mdash;traitors, spies of Coburg and of Pitt, Royalists at
  heart&mdash;cries of all others most calculated to inflame a populace hungry,
  lawless, dreading a foreign invasion and the return of outcast masters
  panting for vengeance.</p>

  <p>The Left, in full assembly, led a furious onslaught on the Right. "Brissot
  and Gensonné must taste the guillotine&mdash;that's a dance they must learn,"
  shrieked Carrier. Danton, counter-attacked by the <i>Gironde</i>, replied by
  hurling the whole force of his gigantic personality against them, vigorously
  aided by his bilious lieutenant, the heavy-browed Camille Desmoulins, who
  published his famous invective, <i>Histoire des Brissotins</i>, of which
  4,000 copies were sold in a few days. Jean-Paul Marat went still further: in
  spite and invective as a deputy for Paris, as President of the Jacobins,
  secretary to the Commune, he had rapidly acquired power and was fast
  approaching the apogee of his fame, power and fame that the poor doctor,
  sweating over his battles with the Academics, the proscribed journalist
  starving in his damp cellar, had enviously dreamt of but hardly hoped to
  realise.</p>

  <p>He named himself, after his now successful journal, <i>L'ami du
  people</i>, and the very dregs of the populace gave him that glory he had
  tried to grasp from Kings, nobles, savants. All his bile, his fury, his
  egotism, his frustration, his disappointment, found vent in this
  cause&mdash;the cause of all the despised and mocked of humanity. True type
  of the <i>enragé</i> or low agitator of the Paris gutters, Marat was adored
  by his followers.</p>

  <p>"The just rage of the people"; his self-description was true enough; he
  did represent the rage, jealousy and vengeance of those who had nothing
  against those who had much, and represented it with an awful sincerity. The
  filthy condition of his person that he had once allowed through neglect, he
  now purposely encouraged in order to flatter the vilest of the vile by
  degrading himself to the lowest level. His agonising skin disease had
  increased to such an extent that it was commonly believed that he had a
  leprosy; his whole body was covered by a foul eruption, a scrofula
  (<i>prurigo de Hébra</i>, or eczema); this disease and the arthritis that
  accompanied it were beyond the power of Souterbielle, the skilful doctor who
  dressed Robespierre's ulcerated leg every day in secret, to cure or even
  alleviate. In that April of his triumph Marat was a doomed if not a dying
  man, and the fury that possessed him had the fearful power of the insanity
  produced by the torment of his body and the passion of his mind. Before the
  horrified imagination of Charlotte de Corday this loathsome figure that
  seemed the embodiment of anarchy was raised with the force of a vision from
  the infernal regions.</p>

  <p>The little man with the huge head and mask that might have been that of
  murder personified, with the brow of the philosopher, covered with greasy,
  verminous black hair and bound with a dirty rag soaked in vinegar, with his
  scabby limbs covered with filthy clothes, his bandaged legs thrust into
  broken boots, two pistols in his sash, vituperation, denunciation, abuse on
  his livid lips, seemed indeed to symbolise the Terror, that appeared about to
  overtake France and to efface for ever the ideals of the patriots.</p>

  <p>The German poet, Klopstock, who represented emphatically and faithfully
  the feelings&mdash;from wildest enthusiasm to deepest horror&mdash;of his
  countrymen regarding the French Revolution, wrote as an expression of his
  most profound disgust: "Who is, what is, this nation that makes a god of the
  hideous Marat?" And he imagined and described an orgy truly terrible in the
  blackened, foul rooms of the Jacobin club, where the <i>clubistes</i>
  honoured Marat "after the fashion of the Hottentots," with the names of
  "tiger-cat, porcupine, hyena, eagle," while they celebrated the coming of the
  reign of terror, expressed by Klopstock in a huge portmanteau word after the
  fashion of Aristophanes, meaning, briefly, Republic of the guillotine, of the
  City, of the Mountain, and of the Club,
  "Klubergmunicipalguillotinoligoquatiererepublik."</p>

  <p>Under this sinister, half-symbolic aspect, as a creature too dreadful to
  be believed in, as a symbol too horrible to be understood, did Adam Lux and
  Mlle. de Corday see Jean-Paul Marat.</p>

  <p>Yet apart from the meaningless fanaticism of the mob's idolatry there were
  some who loved this stricken, terrible creature.</p>

  <p>Simonne Evrard continued to adore the man to whom she had plighted her
  vows before Heaven, to tend his repulsive disease, to dress his putrid sores,
  to mix the almond water that eased his feverish thirst, to fill the bath in
  which he sat continually to relieve the fire in his blood, to run his
  wretched home.</p>

  <p>Neither Marat nor his followers were any more capable than the
  <i>Girondists</i> of formulating a definite plan of government, or even of
  knowing what they wanted. None of them had <i>le tact de chose possible</i>;
  if the King had stumbled to his doom with "the diadem over his eyes," these
  Republicans certainly had the Phrygian cap pulled over theirs; not one of
  them knew where he was going. It is to be doubted if Marat cared;
  <i>Rousseauiste</i> as he was, he had discarded the Genevan's Utopia for the
  pressing need of the moment&mdash;to destroy, to sweep away all who opposed,
  all who criticised, all who roused his envy, jealousy or hatred.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On April 10th, 1793, Jean-Paul Marat, with all the force of his infuriated
  spite, accused the <i>Girondists</i> of being traitors to France and of
  having tried to save "the tyrant" (Louis XVI) by that "appeal to the people"
  for which some had voted.</p>

  <p>The Right, roused at last to action, in their turn charged the deputy of
  Paris with incitement to murder and secured his arrest. While the case of
  Marat was being referred to the Revolutionary Tribunal, the Commune, under
  whose particular charge Marat as secretary and representative to the
  Convention was, exclaimed in fury that they would make the <i>Gironde
  "retomber dans son vomissement."</i> They excited the people by proclaiming
  that there were thousands of empty stomachs in Paris and that all the
  <i>Gironde</i> offered these starving wretches was some fine sentences from
  the classics.</p>

  <p>There was much justice in the ferocious complaint; the people, caring
  nothing for Rousseau, Plutarch, Brutus, or any kind of Utopia, took up the
  cry, and backing the Commune, gave it the power of might. On April 18th,
  Jean-Nicolas Pache, the newly-elected Mayor of Paris, son of a Swiss porter,
  appeared at the bar of the Convention: "The fruits of the earth," he declared
  in demanding the vote of the <i>maximum</i> (that the taxes should not pass a
  certain point), "like the air, belong to all."</p>

  <p>It was a doctrine as popular as it was fallacious and
  dangerous&mdash;<i>les Romains</i> of the Left, who had talked so much about
  Liberty, had no reply to make.</p>

  <p>The Commune, fully aware of its power and backed by the clubs and the
  famished people, pressed the Tribunal to acquit Marat. The <i>maximum</i> was
  voted, the power of the Convention destroyed.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux was present at the frightful scenes which celebrated the
  acquittal of Marat on April 23rd. The demagogue, the idol and the hope of the
  mob of Paris, was carried on the shoulders of his frantic admirers from the
  <i>Palais de Justice</i> to the <i>Tuileries</i>, his rags fluttering about
  him, a wreath of laurels over his soiled <i>foulard</i>, a grin of exultation
  on his dark, tormented face. This grim caricature of a Caesarean triumph
  swept into the Assembly hall. Marat, dirt, sores, fury, laurels, rags, was
  placed on his seat, while his terrible and tattered bodyguard danced and sang
  the <i>carmagnole</i> on the floor before him, making a hideous music with
  clattering wooden shoes and hoarse whistles and shouts.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux was only one of many who gazed on this grotesque scene with
  fascinated dismay. There was a sickly pallor on the faces of the members of
  the Right as Marat rose to speak, the vast Centre remained silent, uneasy, as
  <i>l'ami du peuple</i> was swept away to a complete apotheosis in the club of
  the Jacobin.</p>

  <p>It needed no great clearness of vision to see that the Commune, the mob,
  and men like Marat, were leading the forces of anarchy against any attempt at
  sane government, exploiting the fear and poverty of the people, for their own
  ambitions.</p>

  <p>But Adam Lux comforted himself; he still believed in the power of the
  <i>Gironde</i> to affront even this terrible situation.</p>

  <p>Leaving the ill-kept, severely-policed streets, where there was nothing to
  be seen but vice, misery, famine and ruin, he would still turn into the woods
  outside the city to breathe the fresh air, to rest beneath the budding trees,
  to watch the resting birds and breathe the delicate perfume of the first
  flowers.</p>

  <p>In these quiet hours his old serenity would return and he would refuse to
  believe that this great, glorious and successful enterprise could be ruined
  by a handful of the frantic mob. So, too, Charlotte de Corday, wandering in
  the old elm avenue near the convent where she had prayed and mused so long,
  with her two-day-old newspaper in her work-bag, would dream that it might
  still be possible for France to be saved.</p>

  <p>In the evening Adam Lux, living like an anchorite on his poor pension,
  would muse in his modest chamber as Mlle. de Corday would muse in her sombre
  room, in the hands of each a Rousseau or a Plutarch, in the heart of each a
  fear slowly overcoming a hope.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>When the <i>Commission de Douze</i> was formed by the efforts of the
  <i>Gironde</i> to punish those who disturbed the business of the Convention,
  Adam Lux felt his hope revive. He was ready to hail joyously a return to
  order and tranquillity; no longer would the ex-valet Hanriot, "general" of
  the people, be able to surge round the <i>Tuileries</i> screaming: "Down with
  the <i>Gironde</i>!" no longer would a stream of obscene and infamous libels
  be allowed to issue from the press of the <i>Mountain</i> and the
  <i>Jacobin</i>. Indeed, the first act of the Twelve was to arrest Hébert, who
  edited one of the most offensive of these gutter rags, <i>Le Père
  Duchêne</i>. Such a tumult followed, however, that the <i>Gironde</i> had to
  suppress the <i>Douze</i>, but only to reappoint it the next day. This was a
  signal for an insurrection. Hanriot and his ragged army again surrounded the
  <i>Tuileries</i>; the <i>Girondists</i> could do no more, they had in vain
  used eloquence. One of the qualities they had never lacked, courage, they
  showed abundantly; but it did not save them against the Commune, against the
  Paris mob so skilfully inflamed to fury, against Danton and the revengeful
  passion of Jean-Paul Marat.</p>

  <p>On the evening of May 30th Adam Lux and his fellow-Germans were roused by
  the sound of the tocsin; when they ran into the streets they found the
  barriers closed, the people being called to arms. It was an insurrection
  engineered by the <i>Jacobins</i>, the Commune against the <i>Girondists</i>.
  Soldiers were being raised at forty <i>sous</i> apiece&mdash;the adventurer
  Hanriot was their general. It was a night of nightmarish horror and alarm.
  The more prominent members of the <i>Gironde</i> believed that they were
  about to be massacred. They made no attempt, however, to hide, and early in
  the morning several presented themselves in the former theatre of the
  <i>Tuileries</i>, to which the sittings of the Convention had been moved.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux and his compatriots watched with admiration and apprehension
  these pale, resolute figures, which seemed to them to represent the sole hope
  of civilisation; the theatre was empty save for three <i>Montagnards</i> when
  the <i>Girondists</i> arrived; one was Danton.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened," he said tranquilly; but the doomed deputies were
  not deceived.</p>

  <p>"Look," whispered the novelist Louvet to Elie Guadet, "at his hideous
  expression&mdash;one sees what he is hoping." Then, true to
  Plutarch:&mdash;"Doubtless this is the day when Clodius will exile
  Cicero."</p>

  <p>As the chamber filled, Pache, Mayor of Paris, brought the assurance that
  the revolt was nothing and that he was responsible for law and order, but
  even as he spoke the sound of the cannon fired by Hanriot's communists filled
  the <i>Tuileries</i>. Soon after, a deputation, heavily armed, marched to the
  bar and protested the grievances of the people. Elie Guadet, who was the
  secretary to the Convention, and who had calmly mounted to his desk, answered
  boldly and declaimed against the miserable situation of the capital, "fallen
  into the hands of a group of agitators," and demanded, who had dared to sound
  the tocsin and fire the cannon? Couthon, the paralytic, who wheeled himself
  into the Assembly in his chair of yellow velvet, violently defended the
  action of the Commune and attacked the <i>Douze</i>. The mob that had pushed
  into the room supported him with yells of hatred against the Right. The day
  proceeded in wearisome confusion; it was a cynical illustration of Hérault de
  Séchelles' ironic remark: "The voice of reason and that of the people are the
  same thing"&mdash;for in this mob law the voice of reason could not be for
  one second heard.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the hideous tumult Robespierre, suave, meek, rose and
  began to accuse the <i>Gironde</i> in vague, involved phrases.</p>

  <p>"Make an end!" cried Pierre Vergniaud contemptuously.</p>

  <p>The air was suffocating, foul; every entry to the theatre, once the scene
  of elegant pleasure and charming leisure, was blocked by armed, furious and
  implacable people; the atmosphere was electric with hysteria.</p>

  <p>"I'll end&mdash;against you," said Robespierre, and demanded the heads of
  the Right.</p>

  <p>The Convention, that is the Right, feebly supported by the timorous
  Centre, resisted, but towards ten o'clock, exhausted in mind and body, the
  deputies consented to dissolve the <i>Douze</i>.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux, half-fainting from fatigue and chagrin, forced his way out into
  the streets, which were crudely illuminated for the "triumph of the
  people."</p>

  <p>The following day, June 1st, was a Sunday, and a haggard truce lay over
  the dishevelled city. Adam Lux wandered abroad with death in his heart, the
  bitterness of his disillusion amounted almost to insanity, he lost all sense
  of proportion, of reality, of the logical sequence of events, of half-shades,
  he saw all in black and white, the forces of evil overcoming the forces of
  good. As he walked, at random and half-dazed, through Paris, a proclamation
  placarded on the walls met his eyes:</p>

  <p>"Citizens, remain on the alert&mdash;the dangers of the country are your
  supreme law."</p>

  <p>Hanriot was reorganising his ragged and ferocious forces. Some of them
  were to be sent to crush the revolt in La Vendée, others remained to overawe
  the capital.</p>

  <p>Jean-Paul Marat, who had been the focus and the figure-head of the mob
  fury from the first, was not yet satisfied with his victory. Exhausted as he
  was from the long, agitated sitting of May 31st, burning with fever, his
  aching brows bound with a rag freshly moistened by the anxious hands of
  Simonne Evrard, <i>l'ami du peuple</i> escaped from the care of his
  womenfolk, made his way to the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> and, creeping into the
  belfry, with his own hands rang the tocsin. This dreadful sound, which seemed
  like the very voice of Marat demanding blood, struck with terror into the ear
  of the young deputy from Mayence. In all this frenzy of horror he had had
  only one consolation&mdash;the spectacle of Madame Roland, dauntless,
  indignant, pushing through the vile crowd to the bar of the Convention and
  protesting against the arrest of her husband; her courage was useless, she
  was herself arrested.</p>

  <p>Only by some such act of "antique" virtue and courage could he, Adam Lux,
  relieve his agony of dismay and disappointment.</p>

  <p>The Revolution of June 2nd surged round him. On the reopening of the
  Convention an armed crowd surged again round the <i>Tuileries</i>; a new
  petition, demanding a decree against the <i>Douze</i>, was brought
  forward&mdash;these were accused of being <i>"les correspondants de
  Dumouriez."</i> While the <i>Gironde</i> was evading the petition by
  referring it to a Committee, the men of action were preparing to sweep away
  finally the men of words. Hanriot's scarecrow battalions took up their
  position round the <i>château</i>, upon which, by midnight, sixty pieces of
  artillery were trained; eighty thousand men guarded all the entries to the
  <i>Tuileries</i>.</p>

  <p>The proscribed members of the <i>Gironde</i> amounted to twenty-two; all
  bore themselves with that haughty courage which they so admired in their
  antique models. Especially distinguished by their proud bearing were Charles
  Barbaroux, who had led another assault on the <i>Tuileries</i> not so long
  before; Lanjuinais, one of the ablest of the Moderates; Isnard, Lanthenas,
  the <i>abbé</i> Fauchet, whom Charlotte de Corday had watched from the window
  in Caen and Dussaulx.</p>

  <p>Thus assailed on all sides, facing the frightful fate of mob massacre, the
  "suspect" <i>Girondists</i>, twenty-two against hundreds of thousands,
  preserved their dignity and their spirit. Lanjuinais, raising his voice above
  a storm of cat-calls, even had the courage to take the offensive, accused his
  enemies of their obvious crimes and refused to sit down until he had finished
  his indignant speech. The mob yelled: "We come to denounce you for the last
  time!" The <i>Gironde</i>, followed by the silent and overawed Centre, passed
  to the order of the day; the crowd, led by the <i>Montagnards</i>, rushed
  from the room shouting: "To arms!"</p>

  <p>Bertrand Barère, "the Anacreon of the guillotine," rose, suggesting that
  the accused deputies should resign to save themselves from a worse fate.
  Lanjuinais and Barbaroux were heard amid the excitement refusing to accept
  this chance of ignoble safety.</p>

  <p>"I have sworn to die at my post," said the handsome deputy. "I shall keep
  my word."</p>

  <p>His famous beauty and his courage were extremely effective, but did not
  help his party.</p>

  <p>The Convention was silenced by a rebuke addressed to Chabot by Lanjuinais;
  the <i>Girondists</i> had lost everything save their bravery and their wit.
  When the gross ex-Capuchin friar, rudely insulted the <i>Gironde</i>,
  Lanjuinais smiled: "The priest sacrifices the victim, Chabot&mdash;he does
  not mock him."</p>

  <p>Jean-Marie Hérault de Séchelles, the handsome and elegant Norman noble who
  was President of the Convention, was at a loss, he sat composed, but mute.
  The Centre remained "in a stupor."</p>

  <p>Two deputies who had tried to leave the <i>château</i> were driven back by
  Hanriot's soldiers; they showed their torn clothes to their colleagues when
  they returned in indignation and fear.</p>

  <p>Barère then suggested that "to prove that we are free" the Convention
  should continue their deliberations in the midst of the Revolutionary army;
  this bizarre proposal was accepted. Hérault, cool, polite and impressive,
  wearing his hat, led the deputies out of the <i>château</i> and halted them
  in front of Hanriot's line of cannon.</p>

  <p>This fantastic general, a little, gross, foul-mouthed man, ex-valet,
  ex-public-house keeper, rode a black horse and was half eclipsed by his
  enormous hat with the grotesque panache of the tricolour plumes; as the
  deputies advanced bare-headed he grimaced with insolent triumph.</p>

  <p>Hérault, with admirable courage, demanded to know what the people
  wished.</p>

  <p>"Not words," was the reply, "but twenty-two criminals."</p>

  <p>"Take us all!" replied such of the deputies as could hear this menace.</p>

  <p>Hanriot's reply was to order his gunners to their cannon. The deputies
  backed, divided into small groups, tried to find a way out of their
  intolerable position, if only a return to the <i>château</i>. With yells of
  mockery the <i>sans-culottes</i> shouted: "Long live the <i>Mountain!</i> To
  the guillotine with the <i>Gironde!</i>"</p>

  <p>The deputies still endeavoured to escape from this insane enemy; at one
  point they had almost forced their way out of the gardens of the
  <i>Tuileries</i>, but Marat, with a formidable bodyguard, met them and
  savagely drove them back with the insulting cry: "I order you all to your
  posts, which you have left in so cowardly a fashion!"</p>

  <p>Neither wit, eloquence, elegance nor courage could save the
  <i>Girondists</i>; they became, as unarmed men must become when hustled by
  brute force, ridiculous, humiliated; with Marat yapping like a hell-hound at
  their heels, and amid the bestial laughter of the <i>sans-culottes</i>, they
  were herded back to the Assembly room, where Couthon, babbling with hate, in
  ferocious accents, greeted them with coarse irony and demanded the arrest of
  the twenty-two members.</p>

  <p>A <i>Girondist</i> flung out contemptuously: "Couthon is
  thirsty&mdash;give him a glass of blood!"</p>

  <p>Marat sprang up and gave out, with zest, with joy, with unctuous cruelty,
  the names of the twenty-two deputies; Lanjuinais, Rabaud, Vergniaud,
  Gensonné, Guadet, Isnard, Barbaroux, Pétion, Brissot, Gorsas, Louvet, all
  republicans, ardent disciples of liberty&mdash;the list went on, mouthed over
  by those terrible grimacing lips, livid with pain and fury, to the
  accompaniment of hoarse cries of triumph from the Mountain.</p>

  <p>The twenty-two were sacrificed; while the Left voted their arrest, the
  overawed Centre was silent; the exhausted deputies left at last the
  <i>sénat</i> that had become their prison; with yells of joy the
  <i>sans-culottes</i> withdrew their cannon, insulting the deputies as they
  pushed through the mass.</p>

  <p>The Convention was subverted; the Commune and Marat ruled in Paris; the
  first reign of terror was in sight.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Adam Lux made no attempt to disguise his furious despair; his one wish was
  to die beside the virtuous and heroic deputies of the <i>Gironde</i>. His
  agony was extreme, because he had helped to persuade his own country to join
  this, as it had then seemed to him, great and noble Republic. He had come to
  Paris in joy and triumph, full of zeal for all that was good and sublime,
  expecting to see Rousseau's ideals being followed, the antique models copied,
  and instead&mdash;bloody anarchy! The true Republicans, outraged, insulted,
  dragged to death, while monsters like Couthon and Marat, intriguers like
  Danton and Robespierre, usurped the benches of the <i>sénat!</i></p>

  <p>Private griefs helped to swell the miseries of the young German. He
  learned from the newspapers that his country had been overwhelmed by the
  invaders; the village where he had planted the tree of liberty was in ashes,
  his little home razed to the ground; his family, he could only hope, had
  found a refuge in Mayence, but of this he had no certain news.</p>

  <p>True to that enthusiasm which had always been the mainspring of his
  actions, Adam Lux decided to rush to the bar of the Convention, denounce the
  <i>Mountain</i> in the most bitter terms and then blow out his brains. He
  believed that such an act would recall the country to reason and that the
  justice, common sense and courage of the majority would be roused by his
  sacrifice into turning against the bloody extremists who followed Marat.</p>

  <p>This proposed suicide was not without precedent; in April an Englishman
  named Johnson, after publicly denouncing Marat, had struck himself with a
  dagger, declaring that he would not survive the triumph of anarchy.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, of this friend of Torn Paine that Adam Lux was
  thinking so much as of Curtius, Decius, Brutus, the adored heroes of
  antiquity who had so calmly sacrificed themselves for their country.</p>

  <p>His head on fire, the young German sat down in his poor room and wrote his
  farewell letters, to his wife, to his college friend, Nicolas Vogt, to Jean
  Dumont&mdash;he would await them all "in the sojourn of the immortals."</p>

  <p>This done, Adam Lux hastened out through the horrible disorder of Paris to
  find some members of the <i>Gironde</i> to whom he could confide his
  brilliant project. He was no longer troubled by the agonies of despair, of
  remorse, of disappointment; once he had made up his mind to die he felt calm,
  even joyous, as he had felt on the day when he had received his
  <i>doctorat</i> for the thesis on Enthusiasm, or when, like Cincinnatus, he
  had mused philosophy while guiding the plough. He chose Jérôme Pétion, once
  so popular, and Elie Guadet, the brave secretary of the Convention, for his
  confidants. Both were expecting arrest when the deputy from Mayence read over
  to them the headings of the discourse that he proposed to read to the
  Convention before shooting himself.</p>

  <p>This was a bold, sincere and impassioned attack on the <i>Mountain</i>, a
  warm defence of the <i>Gironde</i>, a warning as to the horrors of anarchy,
  an appeal to reason and justice, a reference to himself as the Curtius who
  would leap into the gulf, a warning as to the civil war likely to be relit in
  the provinces. The only practical suggestion was to make Roland or Brissot
  dictator&mdash;if practical any sane suggestion could be called in such a
  moment. Elie Guadet dissuaded his ardent supporter from suicide. Lux might
  leap into the gulf, but it would not close over him&mdash;if eloquence could
  have stemmed the tide the <i>Gironde</i> would have stemmed it; the
  <i>Mountain</i> would neither listen to Lux's discourse nor take any notice
  of his death&mdash;while his dead body was being dragged away, the sitting
  would continue. Reluctantly the young German relinquished his project, which
  had seemed to him so useful, so sublime, so brilliant. But he was persuaded
  by Pétion and Guadet that an appeal to the Convention, even if sealed by his
  blood, would be useless, and he turned his energies into the project of an
  appeal to the people, which should take the form of the inevitable pamphlet.
  Fired by this new labour of love he returned to his <i>hôtel</i> to compose
  an <i>Avis aux citoyens français</i>.</p>

  <p>While he was thus engaged the Revolution of June and was completed. The
  Commune triumphed. Buzot, Pétion, Guadet, Isnard, Barbaroux, fled secretly
  from Paris (the last already seized and escaping from his guards), and the
  other proscribed <i>Girondists</i> had been arrested; these included Brissot,
  Gensonné and Vergniaud, who disdained flight. With grim rapidity a new and
  wholly democratic constitution was formed, entitled "The Constitution of
  '93," which recognised the sovereignty of the people. So confused and
  shapeless was this hasty effort that the mocking Hérault suggested a search
  in the <i>Bibliothèque</i> for the laws of Minos as a guide; this suggested
  form of government was, however, suspended for a while owing to the unsettled
  state of the country. Barère said, "Its cradle will be its tomb," and a
  Dictatorship, vested in the Committee of Public Safety, of twelve members,
  was set up; each member governed, in theory at least, a twelfth part of
  France. One of the first laws they passed was that against <i>émigrés</i>; it
  was outlawry to attempt to leave the country, death to aid a fugitive. Marat
  became President of the dreadful Committee of the Commune. The principal
  cities of France and more than sixty departments rose against this government
  of the mob, but at first their revolt was only shown by bewildered murmurs
  that scarcely reached Paris.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>While Adam Lux, his long fair hair falling over his earnest brow, was
  seated at his table writing through the long summer day, half through the
  summer night by the light of a cheap candle, his "Advice to the French
  citizens," the spectacle of the "government" (Jacobin dictatorship) that
  speedily became known as <i>La Premiere Terreur</i>, shocked the world and
  drove many sensitive and noble hearts besides that of the young German to
  despair.</p>

  <p>From Paris itself came the voice of a poet, André Chénier, half a Greek
  and a warm lover of Greece, who had been a friend of Condorcet, an ardent
  supporter of '89, not much older than Lux, and as bitterly disillusioned: "It
  is cowardly to share the shame of this immense mob that one abhors so
  intensely in secret, but which, even by silence, one encourages and approves.
  Life is not worth so much disgrace&mdash;some day it shall be said there was
  a certain André Chénier who was one of a few whom neither general frenzy nor
  fear could force to bend the knee before crowned assassins, nor to take a
  seat at the table where the blood of men is drunk."</p>

  <p>From Germany came the violent denunciation of Klopstock, with its vigorous
  image of Clubiofuria, this Alecto, this harpy, who has yet another name, the
  hideous name of Anarchy. Crowned with serpents and armed with a torch which
  scatters sparks of deadly fire, spitting poison, livid and misshapen, this
  fury sits in the French <i>sénat</i>, petrifying all with her ferocious
  menaces. Will, demanded Klopstock, these serpents never cease to hiss? Will
  Liberty ever return? Who will remove this monster, and when?</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday, in her sad room at Caen, asked herself this question.
  Two days later, she read in the papers, <i>Girondist</i>, <i>Jacobin</i>, of
  the events that Adam Lux had seen at first-hand while he was composing his
  pamphlet and rushing it through the press. She was, in the secrecy of her
  chamber, writing on scraps of paper&mdash;"Shall I?"&mdash;"Shall I
  not?"&mdash;tearing them nervously across and throwing them down. Her agony
  of mind was acute, she could hardly command her serenity before the mean fear
  of Madame de Bretteville, the impassive loyalty of the servants.</p>

  <p>She, too, saw the monster, and knew that it must be destroyed, but to her
  it did not have the face of Alecto or Anarchy, but that of Marat&mdash;the
  vile, the filthy, the hideous Marat who had been borne in triumph on the
  shoulders of the mob, Marat who had rung the tocsin inciting to murder and
  chaos, Marat who had yelled at the helpless, disarmed <i>Girondists</i>,
  driving them with insults back into the Assembly room where he had forced
  them to listen to his demand for blood, his demand for their heads as he
  checked them off one by one&mdash;Barbaroux, Lanjuinais, Guadet,
  Gensonné&mdash;</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday took down her Bible and read the story of Judith; as
  Adam Lux thought of Curtius, she thought of the Hebrew heroine whom the Lord
  had made fair for His own purpose, and, with sad resolution, gazed at her own
  lovely face in the dusky glass of the tarnished mirror.</p>

  <p>"Shall I?&mdash;Shall I not?"</p>

  <p>Sleepless, she sat in the dusk, in the dark, her hands folded in her lap;
  none of her little convent-taught arts of sewing, painting, tapestry now
  served to distract her; there was no longer any relief in writing to her
  family, her friends. She was suddenly and utterly alone.</p>

  <p>When, in the vast and sombre <i>salon</i> of her aunt she heard Madame de
  Grandchamp, an agitated visitor, repeat: "How is it these monsters are
  endured, all this excess tolerated? Are there no longer any men?" Charlotte
  de Corday did not reply.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The department of Calvados was one of those that instantly protested
  against the overthrow of the Convention and the government of the Committee
  of Public Safety. At Caen an Assembly to resist this new tyranny was formed,
  and by May 13th, 1793, Marat was already cited as <i>meneur de la
  révolution</i>, and after the arrest of the <i>Girondists</i> a manifesto
  from the Assembly at Caen sternly called upon the Mayor of Paris and all his
  "revolutionaries" to answer with their heads for the safety of the
  representatives of the people. As a further menace they arrested the two
  delegates of the Convention in Caen and ( June 7th) sent ten Commissioners to
  Paris to report on the condition of affairs. When these returned with the
  news of the complete triumph of the extremists, Caen, in the name of the
  department of Calvados, declared utter hostility to this counter-revolution
  and incited the people to revolt against "murderers and brigands." The five
  <i>arrondissements</i> of the town formed a Federation, which met every
  evening to organise the resistance of Caen. As military leader they chose
  General Louis Félix, Baron de Wimpfen, a native of Minfeld, lower Rhine, who
  had distinguished himself in Gibraltar, who had played a moderate part in
  '89, and who, of good family and character, had continued after his
  retirement to reside on his Norman estate. Foremost among the <i>chefs
  civils</i> was Mlle. de Corday's friend, Bougon-Langrais, a true
  <i>Girondist</i> by reason of his delicate, cultured spirit, his integrity,
  his eloquence and his inaction. Two parties distracted Caen, the
  <i>Royalists</i> and the <i>Girondists</i>. They were united only on one
  point&mdash;warm indignation against the <i>Mountain</i>, warm resolve to
  withstand them. For the rest all was scheme, counter-scheme, expectation,
  wonder, talk&mdash;only Mlle. de Corday, closely following her countrymen's
  deliberations, continued to murmur to herself: "Shall I?&mdash;Shall I
  not?"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In this heavy atmosphere of rumour, suspicion, anger and brave resolve,
  came startling news; eighteen of the members of the <i>Gironde</i>, including
  some marked for arrest, had landed at Caen, led by the Norman,
  François-Nicolas-Léonard Buzot, Madame Roland's Saint-Preux. There were among
  the refugees the two deputies Adam Lux had consulted as to his project of
  suicide, Pétion and Guadet, and Lanjuinais, Bergoing, Boutidour, de Cussy,
  Duchâtel, Louvet, Salles, Valazé, Giroust, Lesage, Gorsas, Larivière,
  Meillan, Mallevault. The resplendent Barbaroux joined them later; three young
  journalists, Rouffe, Macherma and Girey-Dupré, accompanied the fugitives.</p>

  <p>General Wimpfen was entrusted with lodging these illustrious refugees; he
  did not altogether trust them, and in order that he might be better able to
  observe them he accommodated them in the handsome <i>hôtel de
  l'Intendance</i> in the <i>rue des Carmes</i>, which opened into the <i>rue
  Saint-Jean</i> directly opposite 148, the house of Madame de Bretteville.</p>

  <p>Wimpfen, a good soldier, but no politician, viewed with the dislike of a
  man of action these too eloquent deputies; his verdict was much the same as
  that of the Paris mob who had thrown them out&mdash;"they are only good to
  make speeches."</p>

  <p>The <i>Girondists</i>, indeed, instantly proceeded to write and to talk;
  they had a proclamation to the people of Caen drawn up, urging a march on
  Paris "to set up again the brilliant statue of Liberty." There was the
  adoption of a device, <i>les lois ou la mort</i>; Salles wrote pamphlets that
  his friends said were worthy of Pascal; diatribes against Marat, Hanriot,
  Robespierre were got together with ease, and one of Brissot's young
  journalists, Girey-Dupré, wrote some new verses for the <i>Marseillaise</i>
  which woefully lacked inspiration. This laboured poetry, which was full of
  laurels, tyrants, antique glory, the august rights of the people, etc.,
  hailed Caen as the <i>Marseille du Nord</i> and sought to rouse Normandy to
  hurl herself on Paris, in order to revenge June 2nd; the refrain was:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Aux Citoyens! Terrassez les brigands!<br>
  La loi, c'est le seul cri, c'est le voeu des Normands!"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>From the window of her aunt's <i>salon</i> Mlle. de Corday could see the
  <i>Girondists</i> haranguing the crowds who gathered beneath the balcony of
  their <i>hôtel</i>; if eloquence, force, quantity, fire and brilliancy of
  words could have restored the Right, these men would have done it; their
  downfall and their peril had not quenched their ardour, had, indeed, given a
  fiery edge to it&mdash;nothing, on the surface, could have been better than
  their cause, nothing more outrageous than their wrongs. It would have been
  difficult, in the heat of events, even to have brought home to them charges
  of incompetence, for if they had failed they could plausibly argue that no
  one could have succeeded in governing France when faced by the treachery,
  violence and self-seeking of the <i>Mountain</i>, who, for party purposes,
  had inflamed and unchained the basest of the populace.</p>

  <p>As for their integrity and their sincerity, there could be no doubt in the
  mind of anyone not consumed by spite or prejudice. These were not spies of
  Coburg or Brunswick, tools of Pitt or the <i>émigrés</i>; they were convinced
  Republicans loyal to their principles, steadfast, brave, and merely
  overwhelmed by the forces of anarchy evoked by a handful of bloodthirsty
  ruffians. Under these favourable colours did the members of the
  <i>Gironde</i> appear not only to their own followers, but to all
  moderate-minded men; in contrast to the party which had overthrown them, they
  represented not only civilisation, but virtue. Their personalities were in
  their favour also; these young, cultured gentlemen, of good manners,
  attractive appearance and noble sentiment, were in sharp contrast to <i>ce
  vil Marat</i>, the spurious affectations of Robespierre, the coarse brutality
  of Danton, the dishevelled fanaticism of Couthon or Desmoulins. Their talents
  of oratory, of wit, of writing, gave them an air of brilliance, and there
  were among them some men, notably Buzot, Vergniaud and Barbaroux, splendidly
  decorative, whose handsome figures would have graced any party.</p>

  <p>The admirers of the <i>Gironde</i> and those quiet, peace-loving people
  for whom they had represented some manners of stable government, were in no
  mood to remember the truth of the starving <i>sans-culottes</i> complaints
  against them, that they had indeed shown no sign of any statesmanlike
  quality.</p>

  <p>Nor was there anyone among the idealists to notice the good qualities of
  the brutal and emphatic government of "monsters," this terrible <i>Comité de
  Salut Public</i>, which by sheer tenacity was not only holding down a
  revolting country, but putting a vast army into the field against the
  invaders. They, too, had their grim heroism, their sombre sincerity, their
  implacable courage: <i>"C'est à coup de canon qu'il faut signifier la
  Constitution à nos ennemis,"</i> cried Danton. <i>"C'est l'instant de faire
  ce grand et dernier serment que nous irons nous vouer tous à la mort ou que
  nous anéantirons les tyrans."</i></p>

  <p>And there was something of the antique grandeur so beloved of the
  <i>Gironde</i> in Barère's image: <i>"La République n'est qu'une grande ville
  assiégée."</i> It was truly with the frenzied energy of men besieged that the
  new government armed, planned, made ready their ragged, famished troops,
  crushed their enemies, prepared to defy all Europe while the fugitive members
  of the disbanded <i>Gironde</i> made their fine speeches and wrote their
  fiery pamphlets.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday knew nothing of the external situation; the peril of
  France before the vast coalition that threatened her frontier had not touched
  the girl's imagination. She allowed no merits to the <i>Mountain</i>, no
  faults to the <i>Gironde</i>; she saw monsters, furies, murderers enthroned
  in Paris, heroes and martyrs haranguing from the balcony of the <i>hôtel de
  l'Intendance</i>.</p>

  <p>From her window she watched eagerly the men whose names were already
  familiar to her from hundreds of newspapers and pamphlets; she saw them
  through the glory of their legend and her own dreams, but she was not
  disillusioned. They pleased her fastidious taste, she thought them worthy of
  their high task as <i>les sauveurs de la Patrie</i>, and the exaltation that
  always burned behind her serenity was heightened by their proximity. For the
  first time she, the obscure provincial who had never left her native country,
  beheld at close quarters some of the great men of her time. Every morning she
  was at her window watching the crowd that came and went excited, agitated,
  uncertain in the street below, or listening to the echoes of the voices of
  the deputies declaiming from their windows.</p>

  <p>As the ferment in the town increased, so did the loneliness of Mlle. de
  Corday; there was no one in whom she could confide; she was a woman and so
  must watch great affairs from a distance, she was without money or
  influence.</p>

  <p>She did not attend the political meetings held by the <i>Girondists</i>;
  in the <i>salons</i> of friends she met some of them: Jérôme Pétion, who had
  given Adam Lux good advice; Jean-Baptiste Louvet, ex-library clerk and author
  of the popular novel, <i>Faublas</i>; she had never read any romances and had
  no interest in Louvet's literary fame; none of these men was anything to her
  but a pillar of her beloved Republic.</p>

  <p>She watched the unfolding of the plans for the Norman-Breton insurrection,
  the schemes of the <i>Fédération</i>, as the revolt of 1793 was called, the
  march on Paris; she read the proclamation of the Assembly of Calvados couched
  in those fiery terms the <i>Gironde</i> knew so well how to employ:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Citizens!<br></p>

  <p class="quote">"In giving us the extraordinary and sacred powers that we
  exercise in your name for the safety of the Republic, you have sworn to
  combat all tyrannies, to march against the triumphant brigands who have
  outraged the People, usurped its power and ruined its fortunes.<br></p>

  <p class="quote">"...Soldiers of Liberty, the moment has come to make these
  brigands feel the full weight of their crimes! Seize your arms! March! All
  Republicans will rise together! Citizens, hasten! the free men of Calvados
  must not be the last at this tryst. The proud Bretons will follow you; their
  battalions are forming, in a few days they will fraternise with you. Already
  those of your brothers who march ahead call to you to join them under the
  banner of Calvados."</p><br>

  <p>On June 13th the United Assembly of the Departments was held in Caen
  (<i>L'Assemblée des départements réunis</i>). Twenty departments had formally
  declared against the government of June 2nd and sworn to be revenged on "the
  tyrants, brigands and monsters." Lyons, in revolt even before the fall of the
  <i>Gironde</i>, had formed a <i>Commission de Salut public du Rhône et
  Loire</i>; Marseilles, Bordeaux, Avignon, Dauphiné, Franche-Comté were ready
  to join Normandy in encircling and marching on Paris.</p>

  <p>The excitement and dissension in Caen became almost insupportable; even
  before the army was raised there was a serious difficulty; the
  <i>Royalists</i> were enrolling in reply to the appeal of the <i>Gironde</i>;
  the Republican Wimpfen found royalists among his officers; at Toulon, Louis
  XVII was proclaimed, and the men of '89 refused to join forces with the
  struggling <i>Monarchists</i> of La Vendée.</p>

  <p>Everywhere was a stream of forceful words, sincere and moving enough; if
  the language was theatrical, so were the events celebrated:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"La majorité vertueuse de vos représentants est forcée de
  délibérer sous la hache des assassins; une municipalité séditieuse, secondée
  par les ministres corrompus et prédateurs, qui s'est entourée d'un amas impie
  de brigands qu'elle soudoye avec les trésors de la République et qu'elle
  alimente du sang du peuple, ose enchaîner la volonté nationale. C'est sur les
  ruines sanglantes de la Patrie que des conspirateurs insensés veulent élever
  la volonté nationale."</p><br>

  <p>In this strain Bayeux strove to rouse the citizens to arms; brave words
  and not an ill-statement of the case, but all this <i>rodomontade</i>, as the
  <i>Jacobins</i> named it, was slow in bearing fruit. General Wimpfen had on
  paper sixty thousand men ready to march on Paris; in reality, Normans and
  Bretons together, there were but two regiments of cavalry and six battalions
  of infantry; some gathered under the <i>Royalist</i> Joseph-Geneviève, Comte
  Puisaye, at Evreux, others under Wimpfen himself at Caen; their main
  drawbacks were those of organisation, a united front, a concerted plan.
  Ardour was soon quenched, enthusiasm soon damped in face of delay, confusion,
  dispute&mdash;the men began to murmur in disgust at the weakness of their
  officers.</p>

  <p>The summer was intensely hot. This extreme of heat added to the general
  enervation, the sense of fever, of excitement, of disarray; driven half-crazy
  by a bombardment of grandiloquence, the hard-headed Normans threw off their
  usual reserve and prudence, their love of peace and gain, and surged here and
  there in the streets of Caen listening to speeches, reading proclamations,
  pamphlets and newspapers, exchanging views. It was an atmosphere in which it
  was difficult to keep the head clear; but Charlotte de Corday remained calm;
  she had taken her resolution before the <i>brouhaha</i> began.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On June 18th there appeared yet another placard in Caen. This was read
  with a peculiar admiration by Mlle. de Corday; it was an attack on Marat and
  held <i>ce monstre</i> up to public execration as the front and symbol of the
  government of the Terror. In cultured, fiery language, the tone of Corneille,
  of Rousseau, of Raynal, with which Charlotte de Corday was so familiar, the
  Normans were passionately incited to rise and march on Paris, to deliver the
  capital from the ruffians who kept it in a stranglehold, to destroy above all
  Marat&mdash;<i>que celui-là périsse, maudit du ciel avec toute sa
  race</i>.</p>

  <p>This fierce manifesto, that did not lack either grace or nobility in the
  style (even Robespierre said of the writer: "He lies with a noble pride"),
  was signed: "Charles-Jean-Marie Barbaroux de Marseille, deputy for the
  department of the Bouches-du-Rhône to the National Convention, expelled by
  force from the post to which the will of the people had elected him."</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday had only, in the quiet retreat of her chamber, to take
  down her Corneille to find sentiments similar indeed to these and couched in
  a language even more sanguinary and lofty. In such terms had Cinna fulminated
  against Augustus:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Si l'on doit le nom d homme à qui n'a rien d'humain,<br>
  A ce tigre altéré de tout le sang romain."</p>

  <p>Marat, the tiger, the monster, the fury&mdash;under that one loathed name
  of <i>le plus vil des hommes</i> was gathered all the wrongs and cruelties
  that oppressed France.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday tore up the last of her papers on which was written:
  "Shall I?&mdash;Shall I not?"</p>

  <p>In the heat of the summer evenings she sat by her open window catching the
  sweet, heavy breeze, the tumult of the day over while men ate and slept or
  argued behind closed doors, the stars making the purple heavens brilliant, in
  the house next door the solitary musician playing his clavecin. She knew what
  must be done; her agony had passed as had the anguish of Adam Lux when he had
  resolved to immolate himself before the Convention. Her noble and innocent
  soul, like his, at first almost overwhelmed by the horror of triumphant evil,
  had found a sure refuge in itself; to be all-sufficient is to disarm the
  world's power to hurt.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"

  <p class="quote">"Ce mélange de tendresse et de mélancolie qu'on nomme

  <hr style="width:25%">
  <br>

  <p class="first">On June 20th, 1793, Mlle. de Corday called at the <i>hôtel
  de l'Intendance</i> and asked for an interview with the citizen deputy
  Barbaroux; she mentioned, as an introduction, that she and the ex-deputy had
  common friends in the Forbin family; she was accompanied by the grave
  steward, Auguste Leclerc; her dress, her manner, her speech were those of a
  highly bred Norman gentlewoman; only her beauty was astonishing, and
  attracted, even in these moments of excitement and confusion, an attention of
  which she was unconscious.</p>

  <p>Followed by her decorous servant she entered the <i>salon</i> of the
  <i>hôtel</i>, which was always full of visitors; Meillan and Guadet were
  there; they retired, leaving her to wait for Barbaroux. When he entered he
  greeted her courteously and there was a little pause of curiosity; she, eager
  to see face to face a man so famous, so admired and so unfortunate, he,
  piqued by the loveliness of the aristocratic stranger.</p>

  <p>She might have easily introduced herself to any of the other deputies, but
  she had chosen Barbaroux because he focused her sympathy and her hatred. He
  had been one of the idealists of '89, he had led the first assault on the
  <i>Tuileries</i>, he had refused to resign to appease the mob, he had issued
  the fiery denunciation against Marat, he had had the address to break prison
  and to rush to rouse Normandy. He had always stood out boldly for his
  principles, and had not hesitated to denounce the massacres of September and
  to fulminate against Marat and Robespierre as murderers; he had been arrested
  on the denunciation of Antoine Saint-Just, the cold correct youth with the
  face of a girl, who was a monster of a different genre from Marat, but a
  monster all the same&mdash;for all these reasons Barbaroux had a claim on the
  sympathy of Mlle. de Corday.</p>

  <p>Nor did his personality disappoint her; to the allure of the cultured
  gentleman he added all the bravura, liveliness and gay charm of the South.
  Madame Roland, even when absorbed by her platonic love affair with the
  courteous and charming Buzot, found Barbaroux "an Antinoüs," and one who know
  him well thus described him: "Greek or Roman countenance, the glance of an
  eagle, personal advantages of every kind&mdash;an orator full of vigour and
  solidity, a gracious speaker enthusiastic for poetry and republicanism."</p>

  <p>Barbaroux possessed, indeed, all the social graces and a personality that
  would have added brilliancy to any career; his talents were obvious, and if
  they were superficial, that was not apparent to those dazzled by his charm.
  He was twenty-six, two years older than Mlle. de Corday, but appeared more
  mature by reason not only of his majestic appearance, but also of his renown.
  With his long black hair cut <i>à la</i> Brutus, his brilliant dark eyes, the
  pure lines of his features, his perfect mouth, his stately carriage, his air
  of restrained fire, he was no ill representative of those heroes of antiquity
  adored by Mlle. de Corday.</p>

  <p>She approved the seductive Provençal, not with her senses, which he had no
  power to touch, but with her mind; because she thought him worthy to grace a
  noble cause.</p>

  <p>On his side Barbaroux was not glorified by a romantic love as was Buzot,
  Vergniaud or Louvet; he was easy in his amours, <i>un homme à filles</i>, but
  his perfect breeding recognised that his young visitor had not called on him
  with any romantic intentions.</p>

  <p>Their conversation was formal, courteous, always in the presence of the
  steward.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday spoke of her former school-fellow, Mlle. de Forbin, whose
  family came from Provence; she had been, before the closing of the convents,
  canoness of the Chapter of Troyes, and had been despoiled of certain
  property&mdash;her sole resource&mdash;which she hoped might be refunded to
  her&mdash;Mlle. de Corday produced all the papers relative to the case.</p>

  <p>The handsome deputy examined them, then said, with that harmonious voice
  and that Southern accent he knew how to use with such effect, that they were
  not in order and that they must be sent to Paris.</p>

  <p>"I shall do what I can to assist Citizeness, but I much fear that the
  recommendation of a proscribed man will not much serve your friend."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have some friends in the Convention to whom you would
  introduce the matter, who would help Mlle. de Forbin?"</p>

  <p>Barbaroux promised to write to one Lauze Deperret, a former colleague,
  also a deputy for <i>Les Bouches-du-Rhône</i>, who was already his
  intermediary with Madame Roland, then a prisoner at the <i>abbaye</i>.</p>

  <p>After no more than this Mlle. de Corday took her leave. Barbaroux kept his
  word and wrote to his friend, mentioning the visit of a citizeness who
  required his assistance, and adding; "All goes well; in a few days friendly
  troops will be outside the walls of Paris."</p>

  <p>After a week, having heard nothing, Mlle. de Corday returned to the
  <i>hôtel de l'Intendance</i>, and again without difficulty obtained an
  interview with Barbaroux; he was attentive, polite, a little curious; he
  promised to give her another letter for Deperret. Mlle. de Corday, who was
  still accompanied by the discreet servant and whose serene demeanour was
  unchanged, said that she was soon leaving Caen. Barbaroux begged her not to
  do so without taking leave of him; she promised this and said she would
  return in another week's time.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday followed closely and with painful interest the events
  which were taking place in Caen, and disclosed herself to none. She made
  preparations (she had few to make) for departure from the sombre dwelling
  that had been her home for two years. She returned some books she had
  borrowed, put aside four volumes of <i>L'Histoire des Chevailers de
  Malte</i>, to be returned to Mme. de Pontécoulant, the former abbess of
  <i>L'abbaye-aux-dames</i>. She gave all her spare time to trying to finish a
  piece of fine needlework which was intended as a present for the servant,
  Anne Bosquaire, who had been kind to her during her stay with Madame de
  Bretteville; but the work was delicate, elaborate and refused to be hurried;
  she therefore took it to a needlewoman and paid in advance for it to be
  finished and delivered to the maid. She visited, with the detached, sad and
  clear sight of one who sees familiar places for the last time, the <i>Buttes
  de Saint-Gilles</i>, where she had tried to keep her father's poor home with
  dignity and decency, the elm walk outside the <i>abbaye</i>, where she had
  walked as a grave child, the <i>abbaye</i> itself, where she had spent six
  years, where she had thought to live for ever as a nun. Massive, sombre, in
  the dark Caen stone, the building, that had housed holy women for seven
  centuries, was despoiled, empty and silent. The churches were still open,
  though in an irregular fashion, but Mlle. de Corday now seldom went into them
  to pray and it was some time since she had taken the Sacraments. She had
  passed beyond the need of ritual; she felt herself in direct communication
  with God; she had no need of any intermediary between herself and the Deity;
  fully aware of her mission, she had no need of symbolism. The purity of her
  soul required no comfort or sympathy from any human being; that of Heaven she
  had already received.</p>

  <p>She typified the device of the Virgin to be found in Evreux Church and on
  several Norman fonts, one with which she was familiar&mdash;<i>Rosa Mystica
  in Horto Incluso</i>&mdash;the mystic rose, the rose of Sharon, in the
  enclosed garden. Her virginity was not only that of the exquisite and
  fastidious body, but also that of the delicate, noble soul. In her aunt's
  dreary <i>salon</i> she was affable and gracious; she might be going, she
  said, to visit her father at Argentan, or even travelling to England. She
  said to some acquaintances: "I have a voyage to make."</p>

  <p>To Madame Paisan she gave a book of lace designs: "I shall have no more
  need of lace."</p>

  <p>Visiting a friend, she found a young girl, Amélie Gautier, in tears
  because she had no ear-rings. "I shall have no more need of these," smiled
  Mlle. de Corday, and took the plain gold rings from her own ears to give to
  the child. She had never had more than these simple ornaments&mdash;in all
  her life no extravagance or luxury.</p>

  <p>On July 5th she went to see her friend, Madame de Villiers, at Verson. It
  was a brilliant day; Madame de Villiers was seated with her maids in the
  garden shelling peas.</p>

  <p>On her arrival Mlle. de Corday ran up impetuously to her friend, clasped
  her in her arms, took the seat beside her; when the servants had gone, she
  said:</p>

  <p>"I have come to bid you farewell&mdash;I have a journey to make&mdash;I
  did not wish to go without embracing you."</p>

  <p>Her voice broke, she took up a handful of peas, crushed them in her
  delicate fingers, cast them down, and hastened away.</p>

  <p>In the evenings she would burn on her wide-hooded hearth the pamphlets,
  speeches and journals of the <i>Gironde</i> that she had collected, read her
  Corneille, or, silent in the hot dusk, listen to the clavecin playing in the
  house next door.</p>

  <p>Taking leave of another friend, Madame Lemoine, she appeared serene and
  gay, but Madame de Bretteville, a little curious about this talk of sudden
  departure, came unexpectedly into her room and found her weeping.</p>

  <p>She quickly excused herself:</p>

  <p>"Who would not weep, dear Aunt, in times such as these? Who knows who may
  not be struck down next? Who is safe while Marat lives?"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On July 6th she packed her smnall trunk; in it she placed her inexpensive
  but well-kept toilet articles, a petticoat in rose-coloured silk, another in
  white cotton, two chemises marked "C.D." (Charlotte Darmont), two pairs of
  cotton stockings, one white, one grey, a little sleeveless dressing-jacket,
  two caps and two fichus in linen, four white handkerchiefs marked "C.D.," a
  fichu of green gauze, a silk fichu with a red border, a packet of
  different-coloured ribbons, several pieces of chiffon, rose, white. This
  modest luggage ready, she had it sent down to the booking-office of the
  diligence service, Caen-Paris, where she had already taken a place in the
  coach leaving Caen at two o'clock on July 9th. The diligences left for the
  capital three times a week for Paris, via Lisieux and Evreux.</p>

  <p>This duty accomplished, she went to her shoemaker, Lecointre, to buy a
  pair of shoes with stout soles and high broad heels, fit for the streets of
  Paris. Lecointre suggested that he should make her a pair, and she replied
  that she was pressed for time and chose some ready-made shoes. To her aunt,
  continually nervous and fearful, she continued to say that she was going to
  visit her father, to others she spoke vaguely of a voyage to England, via
  Paris.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On July 7th Charlotte de Corday was present when General Wimpfen reviewed
  on the <i>Cours-la-Reine</i> the troops who were to chase the monsters and
  brigands from Paris. With banners bearing inscriptions: "War on the tyrants
  and the anarchists"&mdash;"Long live the Republic one and indivisible," the
  battalions paraded before a vast crowd. There were speeches appealing for
  volunteers; there were patriotic songs, new words to old tunes&mdash;to the
  air of "The Old Man in Love" (<i>Vieillard qui d'amour est épris</i>) they
  sang "The Young Republicans' Farewell to their Sweethearts."</p>

  <p>After all this excitement and the flaming eloquence of the
  <i>Girondists</i>, seventeen men volunteered instead of the hundreds
  expected.</p>

  <p>Pétion stood near to Mlle. de Corday. He recalled her visit to Barbaroux
  and was piqued by what seemed to him the disdainful irony of her attitude,
  impassive though her fair face appeared.</p>

  <p>"Would you be vexed if they did not march?" She did not reply.</p>

  <p>On returning to 148, <i>rue Saint-Jean</i>, she saw the wood-turner Lunel
  and his wife playing cards in his workshop and stopped to speak with them;
  some comments were passed on the review; Mlle. de Corday exclaimed suddenly:
  "No! it shall not be said that Marat reigned over France!" and ran upstairs
  to Madame de Bretteville's apartment.</p>

  <p>Later in the day she returned with Auguste Leclerc to wait on
  Barbaroux&mdash;to bid him <i>adieu</i> as he had asked, and to obtain from
  him the second letter in favour of Alexandrine de Forbin that he had
  promised.</p>

  <p>Charles Barbaroux, though exhausted and galled by the events of the day,
  received her with his usual gallantry, but said that he would send the letter
  in the morning; Mlle. de Corday begged that he would give it to her at
  once&mdash;she was going to Paris "on business" and would deliver the letter
  herself.</p>

  <p>Jérôme Pétion was present at this interview; he marked with a light
  amusement the young girl who took such a grave interest in politics.</p>

  <p>She wore an undress of Indian muslin, suitable to the great heat, with a
  little apron with pockets and a fine fichu over her shoulders; her hair was
  arranged in the fashion called "repentance" (<i>repentirs</i>) hanging in
  loose curls almost to the waist, and her mob-cap was the kind then in the
  mode&mdash;"<i>baigneuse</i>"; she carried a green paper fan. This simplicity
  could not disguise her native fineness nor the pride that was neither
  arrogance nor vanity.</p>

  <p>Pétion was interested enough to watch this stranger closely and deeply,
  questioning Barbaroux on details of the government&mdash;when and where were
  the sittings of the Convention held, how could one obtain an entrance there,
  where did that and this deputy live? Would the Feast of Liberty be held as
  usual on the <i>Champ de Mars</i> on July 14th?</p>

  <p>Pétion suspected that, under these excuses, Mlle. de Corday wished to
  attract the attention of the charming Provençal who was so successful with
  women. He began, with irony, to rally "the beautiful aristocrat who was so
  interested in Republicans."</p>

  <p>"Citizen Pétion," replied Charlotte de Corday, "today you judge me in
  ignorance, one day you will know who I am."</p>

  <p>She took her leave; she had other visits to make, and Barbaroux promised
  to send the letter immediately to her house; she left smiling, with what
  seemed a jest on her lips.</p>

  <p>"Adieu, my dear deputy, to-morrow I go to Paris, where I shall see your
  tyrants face to face!"</p>

  <p>She then visited Madame de Pontécoulant, of whom she took affectionate
  leave; her nephew, Gustave Doulcet, Comte de Pontécoulant, was then in Paris,
  as a deputy from Caen.</p>

  <p>"Will you be away long?" asked the ex-abbess.</p>

  <p>"That depends on the turn my business will take."</p>

  <p>In the evening there was a friend to supper. Mlle. de Corday entertained
  him with exquisite urbanity; afterwards there was a drive with Madame de
  Bretteville and the Chevalier de Longueville to see his flowers in his garden
  at Saint-Julien&mdash;she was <i>d'une tranquillité parfaite</i>. She
  appeared saddened by the spectacle of the volunteers who were to march on
  Paris&mdash;those few hundreds, a useless sacrifice! The green-paper fan was
  constantly in her hand; she needed it, for even in the evening there was
  hardly a breath of air. The flowers were superb in the full splendour of the
  height of summer; Mile. de Corday looked at them as if there, too, she left a
  farewell.</p>

  <p>Serenely, almost gaily, she took leave of her friends and returned to the
  chamber that had sheltered her for two years and where she had only two more
  nights to stay.</p>

  <p>She occupied herself with burning the last of the <i>Gironde</i>
  literature, preserving only the current number of the <i>Bulletin de
  Calvados</i>; then she took down her Bible and re-read the story of
  Judith.</p>

  <p>The letter from Charles Barbaroux had arrived enclosed in a civil note to
  herself, asking her to write to him and give him news of her journey.</p>

  <p>With this letter to Lauze Deperret were some pamphlets that Mlle. de
  Corday was to deliver. The soi-disant deputy, who was of a warm, affectionate
  nature, wrote thus:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"My dear, good friend,&mdash;I am sending you some
  interesting works that must be made known. I wrote to you, by way of Rouen,
  to interest you in the business of one of our citizenesses. It is only a case
  of obtaining from the Minister of the Interior some documents that you can
  send me here at Caen. The citizeness who will bring you this letter is so
  interested in this affair&mdash;which seems to me extremely just&mdash;that
  she is ready to take the greatest trouble about it. Farewell, and I embrace
  you and your daughters, Marion and the others. Give me news of your son.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Caen, July 7th, 1793, Year II of the Republic One and
  Indivisible."</p><br>

  <p>This was not signed, but Barbaroux's motto (<i>épigraphe</i>) was added at
  the bottom.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday replied to this courtesy by a little note of gratitude in
  which she said that she would not fail to write to Barbaroux to report "the
  success of her enterprise."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The next day, July 8th, and the last in Caen, there was very little to do;
  she had been so careful, so cool in her preparations that there was leisure
  on her hands. To the young son of Lund she gave her boxes of pencils and
  colours: "I shall not need them again."</p>

  <p>She drove out with a friend Madame de Fauville, for Madame de Bretteville
  was depressed, sick, and would not leave her chair between Minette and Azor;
  the ladies chatted cheerfully in the modest carriage. When they parted
  Charlotte de Corday gave her gauze scarf and her green-paper fan to her
  friend.</p>

  <p>There was one more visit to make&mdash;to Madame Malfilâtre: "I have a
  journey to make. I have come to say farewell."</p>

  <p>She embraced her friend and her young son also, kissing him tenderly.</p>

  <p>There was little more to do. She looked out her money; she had a hundred
  <i>écus</i> in <i>assignats</i> left from her father's allowance; fifty of
  these she put aside for the expenses of her journey.</p><br>

  <p>She then, late at night, wrote a letter to M. de Corday, which she dated
  the day of her departure from Caen.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I owe you obedience, my dear papa, yet I am leaving
  without your permission, without seeing you, because I am too full of grief.
  I am going to England because I do not believe that one can at present live
  for very long happy and tranquil in France. In leaving, I put in the post
  this letter for you and when you receive it I shall no longer be in this
  country. Heaven refuses us the happiness of living together as it has denied
  us so many other blessings. Perhaps it will be more clement towards our
  country. Farewell, my dear papa, embrace my sister for me, and do not forget
  me.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Corday.<br>
  "July 9th."</p><br>

  <p>This written, folded and sealed, there was little else to do. She was so
  absolutely alone; she had, by a supreme effort of will, detached herself from
  all her surroundings, from her affections, her hopes, her fears.</p>

  <p>She was no longer even concerned in the tumults of Caen, which were
  increasing in violence; Buzot, furious at the small number of volunteers for
  the march on Paris, had suggested setting fire to the town and putting the
  blame on the <i>Jacobins</i>. Wimpfen, learning of his intention, hastened to
  prevent him; the <i>hôtel de l'Intendance</i> was thus soon the scene of an
  excitement, a confusion, a debate in which the fair young woman with her
  modest petition for an ex-nun was forgotten; and Charlotte de Corday had
  forgotten them; she had achieved the peace that comes from harmony with God.
  The cries in the streets, the roll of the drums, the music, the singing, the
  violent strains of the <i>Marseillaise</i>, the streams of fiery eloquence,
  the armed men with the huge panaches of tricolour plumes, the excitement of
  Barbaroux, the irony of Pétion: these were no more than a blurred background,
  like the delirium of a fever remembered in health, to her resolve.</p>

  <p>In her lonely leisure, while she listened to the soft melody of the
  clavecin flowing in through the open window, she had embroidered on a scrap
  of silk the sentence that had haunted her&mdash;"Shall I, shall I not?"
  (<i>Le ferai-je? Ne le ferai-je?</i>) This she placed in front of her dim
  mirror, so that she continually saw it as she moved about making her final
  preparations for departure; she had answered the question, but the sight of
  the words, so exquisitely traced by her needle, helped to soothe and sustain
  her resolution.</p>

  <p>By the light of her candle, when the hot summer night at length fell and
  it was quiet in the street, she arranged her room as she had found it when
  she arrived, two years ago, to receive a cold welcome. The sombre apartment,
  furnished with heavy faded pieces, in nothing like the chamber of a young
  girl, had become sanctified to her by her own thoughts and dreams; it was the
  retreat that she had filled with all the visions of her loneliness, where,
  light as a butterfly on a rose, her meditation had turned to the possible
  ideal lover who did not exist, "the pupil of Socrates, the soldier of
  Pericles," beautiful, serene, noble, strong, whom she might have loved. Here,
  too, she had learned to forgo these dreams, almost before they were formed;
  to everyone, to the elegant young noble Boisjugan de Maingré, whose murder
  had torn her heart, to Bougon-Langrais, the grave, handsome magistrate, to
  the fine young officer, M. de Tournélis, to the famous Barbaroux, she had
  said secretly&mdash;"Oh, my soul, this is not the man!" She was resigned to
  this loneliness, she even rejoiced in it, as it helped to make her burden
  lighter. "No one will mourn for my death," she had written. Her father had
  seen little of her for years, her brothers were far away and divided from her
  by war, her sister Eléonore had other friends, to Madame de Bretteville she
  had been a burden and a vexation. She was free.</p>

  <p>All her farewells were taken, her little gifts made; there were some of
  whom she could not take leave: M. de Faudoas and his daughter, the brother of
  her dear Rose Fougeron du Fayot, Boussaton de Belleisle and others of her
  friends&mdash;these were in prison, probably awaiting death, merely for being
  patriots, decent citizens.</p>

  <p>She put away her constant companions, her books, on the shelves at the
  side of her bureau, on the table by her bed, the Raynal, the Rousseau, the
  Corneille, the Bible; she had no longer any need of them, their messages were
  for ever graven in her heart.</p>

  <p>Yet, after all, the sombre room had not had much of her; she was
  indifferent to her surroundings, which had always been austere and poor; she
  took with her all she needed wherever she went:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Rome n' est plus dans Rome, elle est toute où je suis."</p>

  <p>She did not need to read any more of Judith, of Emilie, of Pauline; she
  had absorbed their souls; she did not need to ponder again the words of
  Corneille. Apposite to her own case as if they had been written for her
  inspiration, they rang in her mind:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Le ciel entre mes mains a mis le sort de Rome<br>
  Et son salut dépend de la perte d'un homme."</p>

  <p>She knew the monster who was to blame for:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"Le ravage des champs, le pillage des villes,<br>
  Et les proscriptions et les guerres civiles."</p>

  <p>She could affirm:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Lui mort, nous n'avons plus de vengeur ni de maître,<br>
  Avec la liberté, Rome s'en va renaitre."</p>

  <p>As she put away, carefully, with her money and the few necessaries for her
  long journey, the packet given her by Barbaroux, she recalled the eloquent
  speeches of the brilliant young deputy, his emphasis on the country's peril
  from anarchy&mdash;"without another Jeanne d'Arc, without some deliverer sent
  from Heaven, without some unexpected miracle, what is to become of
  France?"</p>

  <p>Everything was ready and the dawn had come; Charlotte de Corday slept a
  little for the last time on the sombre bed with the faded tapestry curtains
  and the worn coverlets.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Madame de Bretteville was nervous, agitated, too ill to leave her chair,
  full of questions and apprehensions: "Where are you going; will you be
  safe?"</p>

  <p>"Be reassured, I am going to see my father, my dear Aunt, and I shall be
  quite safe."</p>

  <p>The last meal in the gloomy, large <i>salon</i>, with its methodical air
  of home and respectability, with the well-trained servants, with Azor and
  Minette.</p>

  <p>When the leave-taking came Madame de Bretteville was tearful; this girl
  was of her class, her blood, she had been company, her departure added to the
  desolation and the uncertainty of the situation. Mlle. de Corday consoled
  her; she was safe in Caen, all would be well.</p>

  <p>There were warm farewells to the women servants who had received her so
  dryly, but who had come to respect and love her; then Auguste Leclerc
  accompanied her to the starting place of the Paris coach.</p>

  <p>As she passed the Lunels, she said: "Good-bye, you will not see me
  again."</p>

  <p>The day was almost insupportably hot; the dark stone buildings of Caen
  shimmered in a haze of heat; the patriotic flags hung limp upon their
  poles.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday wore a robe of self pin-striped brown pique
  (<i>rayée</i>), with a white muslin fichu; she carried gloves and a fan; her
  hair was unpowdered and arranged in curls on her shoulders; her black hat was
  high-crowned with three black cords and tassels; she wore the stout-soled
  shoes she had bought especially for the journey.</p>

  <p>As she passed the post, she put the letter for her father in the box. Now
  everything was done; the coach was ready at the stage, she took a cheerful
  leave of Auguste Leclerc and stepped into the diligence; punctually, at two
  o'clock, it left for Paris, via Lisieux.</p>

  <p>During these hot July days the diligence with Charlotte de Corday as a
  passenger left Caen and travelled towards Paris, Adam Lux was finishing his
  bold pamphlet, <i>Avis aux citoyens français</i>, in which he challenged
  Marat and the <i>Mountain</i> and supported those brave Normans and Bretons
  whom Charlotte de Corday had seen parading at Caen. He concluded his burning
  denunciation by a fearless defiance to <i>Messeigneurs les
  usurpateurs</i>&mdash;"After what I have written here, no doubt you will do
  me the honours of your prison or your guillotine, but I am ready to brave
  them."</p>

  <p>As Mlle. de Corday came nearer to the capital, travelling by slow stages
  in the clumsy diligence through the exhausting heat, Jean-Paul Marat was
  forced to keep to his apartment, being too ill to drag himself to the
  <i>Comité du Salut Public</i>, where he enjoyed the triumph that he had been
  waiting for all his life. This forced inactivity bitterly galled the sick
  man; his rage helped to increase the poisons that were burning his blood, the
  great heat of the summer added to his torment; his doctor could give him no
  ease; his flesh was corrupting while he lived; death was only a question of
  weeks. But his powerful spirit refused to be daunted; with his head swathed
  in the vinegar-soaked muslin, an old dressing-gown over his shoulders, Marat
  sat in his slipper bath, scribbling on a plank laid across his knees, pouring
  out, with that energy which had once tried to overset the unparalleled genius
  of Newton, idealism, venom, fantasy, fury, for the pages of <i>L'Ami du
  peuple</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The first relay stage of the diligence was at Vimont, three leagues from
  Caen, the second at Saint Aubin; at Lisieux, twenty-five leagues from Caen,
  it was necessary to stay the night. This town was still in the Calvados, in
  the beautiful valley of La Touques; was very ancient, the seat of a bishop
  since the sixth century, composed of handsome brick houses of Renaissance
  style, a noble cathedral and several fine churches; the coach from Caen drew
  up in the evening in the Faubourg Saint Désir at about five o'clock, and
  Mlle. de Corday engaged a room in the inn kept by a certain Delafosse, which
  had been formerly <i>Les Trois Rois</i> and was now <i>Le Dauphin</i>. It was
  a tranquil, charming place, seemingly far removed from terror and tumult,
  since Puisaye's soldiers had left it; opposite the inn was the impressive
  stone and brick mass of the Church of <i>Saint Désir</i>, constructed from
  the old Benedictine convent, with ornaments <i>en rocaille</i>. Mlle. de
  Corday was given a room on the first floor with a gallery overlooking a small
  inner court. After her modest meal, the traveller joined the host, his two
  daughters and another young girl, who were seated in the freshness of the
  evening on a bench in front of the inn.</p>

  <p>The beauty, grace and noble air of the stranger greatly impressed these
  simple people; they were surprised that one so obviously an aristocrat should
  be travelling without servants or escort in times so troublous, but her
  serene demeanour assured them that she was not bound on any difficult or
  dangerous errand.</p>

  <p>She did not mention her business nor did they enquire it, but for a long
  time, while the hot evening deepened into the hot night, she talked with
  them, modestly and quietly, on matters of general interest.</p>

  <p>Her harmonious voice, her charm, something very uncommon about her calm
  bearing, so impressed one of the young girls, who afterwards became a Madame
  Lemaître, that she remembered it all her life, and until she died, very many
  years afterwards, a centenarian, she would continually speak of the stranger
  who had spoken to her with such friendly kindness as they sat in the July
  warmth outside the inn.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>This was, to Charlotte de Corday, a gracious interlude, it recalled to her
  the tranquil days at Mesnil-Imbert, when she had been so happy with her
  companions and her pupils, the leisurely, well-ordered hours, the musings by
  the reeds of the home pond, the walks by the whitened hawthorn hedges, under
  the thick shades of the chestnut trees, the still Sundays, with a hush over
  the quiet fields and the church bells ringing.</p>

  <p>She was glad to breathe, for the last time, in this peaceful company, her
  Norman air&mdash;the air of her native Calvados.</p>

  <p>At six o'clock the next morning she took the coach for Evreux, twenty-five
  leagues from Lisieux; at Evreux she did not stop, but took the night
  diligence for the capital, which was due in Paris at eleven o'clock the next
  morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>There were seven passengers in the coach from Evreux to Paris, two of them
  were young men of coarse and jovial appearance, whom Mlle. de Corday named at
  once and secretly "<i>Montagnards</i>." They tried to relieve the tedium of
  the journey by getting into conversation with the fair passenger; one of them
  declared that he knew her father and gave his name; he was an utter stranger
  and this was only a feint to gain her attention. Courteous, smiling, utterly
  indifferent, she put by these crude courtesies; piqued, the young men
  redoubled their gallantries; amused, she evaded them with ironic mockery.</p>

  <p>So little did their stupidities concern her that as the night drew on and
  the interior of the coach became dark, save for the fluttering light of the
  exterior lanterns, she became weary of their banter and fell asleep in her
  corner; her high-crowned hat was on her knees, and her magnificent hair
  spread over the cushions of the coach; her noble features had, in their
  repose, an extraordinary tranquillity.</p>

  <p>The young gallants ceased the plaintive love songs with which they had
  been trying to distract her and stared in silence at this beauty which
  seemed, they knew not how, so completely beyond their reach; the sparse rays
  of the lantern showed them intermittently the lovely slumber of the young
  woman, so fine, so out of place in this public vehicle.</p>

  <p>One of the men regarded her with desire, with a sudden and violent
  passion; what he had begun in jest he would continue in earnest; he sensed,
  without understanding why, that she was rare and remarkable&mdash;"a mystic
  rose in an enclosed garden."</p>

  <p>He began to plead with her, to sing to her, half arrogant, half humble.
  When, in full daylight, she opened her eyes he pressed his gallantries on
  her&mdash;he asked the name and address of her father, that he might demand
  her hand in marriage; as they approached Paris he became more and more
  importunate, more and more in earnest. Fearing that he would compromise her
  design, she answered him pleasantly, affecting to take it all as a jest. The
  diligence, punctually at eleven o'clock, rattled into the <i>Cour des
  Messageries</i> in <i>la place de la Victoire Nationale (place Notre-Dame des
  Victoires)</i>; the heat was even more stifling than it had been in Normandy;
  Mlle. de Corday was exhausted, shaken from the jolting of the coach, covered
  with dust, dishevelled from sleeping in her clothes, and completely a
  stranger in the capital, she was not only alone, she was abandoned. With
  difficulty she rid herself of her coarse admirer, who was dragged away on his
  business by his companions, and stood solitary, her trunk beside her, in the
  cobbled courtyard. She glanced at the coach from Evreux as it turned away; it
  was the breaking of her last link with Normandy.</p>

  <p>In the courtyard was the booking-office of the coaches, conducted by a
  certain Noël; Mlle. de Corday went there and asked this man if he could
  recommend to her a cheap, decent <i>hôtel</i>?</p>

  <p>He directed her to the <i>hôtel de la Providence</i>, which was quite
  near, No. 19, in the <i>rue des Vieux-Augustins</i>. One, Gilles Vivien, who
  acted as porter to the travellers arriving by diligence, took her trunk on
  his shoulder and she followed him through the hot streets, holding in her
  tired hand the card given her by Noël, which read:</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><i>Madame Grollier,<br>
  tient l'hôtel de la Providence<br>
  Rue des Vieux-Augustins, 19<br>
  près de la place de la Victoire<br>
  Nationale<br>
  On y trouve des appartements meublés<br>
  A tout prix.<br>
  Paris.</i><br></p>

  <p>Madame Grollier, a free-and-easy woman of twenty-six years, had only had
  the <i>hôtel</i> for a few months; it was a stone building that had been
  erected about fifteen years before and furnished for the purpose of a
  hostelry of the cheaper sort.</p>

  <p>The robust hostess, on the arrival of her new client, sent the trunk up by
  the waiter, François Feuillard, to room No. 7 on the first floor, and
  proceeded to take all particulars of herself from Mlle. de Corday&mdash;her
  name, her native town, etc.; all this information was necessary for the
  police, said Madame Grollier.</p>

  <p>When, after having answered these questions, Mlle. de Corday found herself
  in the room assigned to her, she felt overwhelmed by fatigue and asked that
  the bed might be made up. Almost at once she changed her mind; she had
  something to do, she would rest afterwards. She made a hasty toilet, gave the
  waiter some money to buy pens, paper and ink, and asked him the way to the
  <i>rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre</i>.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards, at the very height of the heat of the suffocating July
  day she went out, weary as she was, to find the house of Lauze Deperret. The
  size and strangeness of Paris emphasised her isolation, her loneliness. She
  knew no one in the capital save a certain Sieur Alain, with whom she had
  corresponded on some business while she was at the convent; she had a good
  reason for not seeking him out.</p>

  <p>It was one o'clock when she reached the house of Lauze Deperret; he was
  absent from home, at the Convention. She left the packet and letter given her
  by Barbaroux with the two young daughters who received her, and saying that
  she would call again later, returned to <i>La Providence</i>.</p>

  <p>There she took some food and shut herself in her room to rest; the chamber
  was neither uncomfortable nor displeasing; the walls were hung with
  tapestries, there was a large pier-glass over the mantelpiece; window
  curtains and bed furniture were in crimson damask; there were chairs covered
  in satin, a marble-topped commode, a table with gilt candlesticks; the bed
  had a tester with curtains and several mattresses, the uppermost being of
  feathers; there was accommodation for ablutions, a ewer of fresh water, clean
  water. The window gave on to the corner of the <i>rue Montmartre</i>.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon, having rested, Mlle. de Corday went downstairs and
  entered into conversation with Madame Grollier and Feuillard, the waiter, who
  were both in the <i>bureau</i>. Affecting the artlessness of a raw
  provincial, she tried to obtain news of what was passing in Paris, relating,
  in her turn, the recent events at Caen. The conversation had the air of
  innocent gossip&mdash;the young Norman introduced the name of
  Marat&mdash;what was thought of him in Paris?</p>

  <p>Feuillard answered that the patriots thought a great deal of him, but that
  the aristocrats detested him, and added that he was very ill and would not
  appear on the <i>Champ-de-Mars</i> on July 14th, nor for some time, if ever
  again, take his seat in the Convention.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday continued the casual conversation with an air of
  indifference, but soon broke it off to return to her room. She was profoundly
  disturbed by what she had heard.</p>

  <p>She had come to Paris especially in time for the <i>Fête de la
  Liberté</i>, for she meant there to meet Marat, or, if this failed, to see
  him on the benches of the Assembly.</p>

  <p>Now she was at a loss&mdash;what should she do? Baffled, troubled, she
  mused in the <i>hôtel</i> bedroom, her unpacked trunk on the floor by the
  newly-made bed, her body was enervated by fatigue and heat, but her mind
  remained resolute to her fixed idea&mdash;to kill Jean-Paul Marat.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Vous vous perdez, vous vous perdez, vous dis-je. Votre
  tyrannie touche à sa fin. Après l'usage monstrueux que vous avez fait de
  votre autorité renouvelée ou non, elle finira. Croyez-vous que la nation,
  dont il faudra que la démence et l'ivresse finissent, ne vous demandera pas
  compte de vos vexations?... peut-être l'effusion de votre sang impur
  n'expiera pas vos forfaits!" &mdash; Guillaume-Thomas Raynal. <i>Les Deux
  Indes,</i> Tome II.</p>
  <hr style="width:25%">
  <br>

  <p class="first">Since she had read of the revolution of June end and the
  expulsion of the <i>Girondists</i> from the Convention, Charlotte de Corday
  had resolved to kill Marat.</p>

  <p>Convinced that this duty and this sacrifice had been divinely laid upon
  her, she had achieved the task of detaching herself from all earthly
  considerations and at the same time of making careful preparations so as to
  involve no one but herself in the consequences of her deed and to leave her
  modest affairs in order.</p>

  <p>It was not only to forward the cause of Mlle. de Forbin that she had three
  times sought out Barbaroux. It was also to attract the attention of the
  <i>Girondists</i> to herself, so that, when her deed was accomplished, they
  would be ready to protect her family and her friends. It was to save any
  trouble falling on her father that she had written to him that she was going
  to England. She had asked no help, no counsel from anyone; all who knew her
  would be able to say that she had not breathed a word of her design. Even the
  expenses of her journey she had paid herself out of her pocket-money.</p>

  <p>She had done nothing that she regretted, made no false step, never
  hesitated a second in her resolution&mdash;and now she was, at the last stage
  of her enterprise, frustrated.</p>

  <p>She had planned her deed so exactly, visualised it so clearly; she would
  strike down Marat on the <i>Champ-de-Mars</i> on July 14th, at the moment of
  his gross triumph, and, immediately afterwards, she would be slain by his
  furious supporters. She had no doubts as to her fate. "One cannot attack a
  savage beast without being bitten," she had said in Caen. She had not even
  wished for fame, for glory; she had hoped to be destroyed and never to be
  made known.</p>

  <p>If the 14th of July had, for some reason, not given her the opportunity
  she wanted, then she had planned to gain admission to the <i>Tuileries</i>
  and to strike the tyrant in his seat; there, too, as she visualised it, she
  would, in her turn, have been struck down and no one would ever find out her
  identity.</p>

  <p>Now, what to do?</p>

  <p>Useless now all the information she had carefully gathered from Barbaroux
  how to gain admission to the fête, to the Assembly, useless the introduction
  to Lauze Deperret, who was to have served to introduce her to the
  <i>Champ-de-Mars</i>, to the <i>Tuileries</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Still in an agony of indecision, she went again to the <i>rue Saint
  Thomas</i>. Deperret could, perhaps, help her in the affair of Mlle. de
  Forbin that she had sincerely at heart, he might even be able to help her in
  her great enterprise.</p>

  <p>The deputy was entertaining some friends to dinner; when she arrived they
  sat at dessert. Mlle. de Corday was asked to return in the morning, but
  overcoming her natural reserve and modesty, she begged the servant to implore
  the deputy for a short interview.</p>

  <p>The <i>Girondist</i> had broken the seals of the packet from Barbaroux;
  then, his guests arriving, had placed it, unread, on the chimney-piece.</p>

  <p>However, on receiving the fair stranger's insistent message, he left the
  company to receive her in the small cabinet where she anxiously awaited
  him.</p>

  <p>Lauze Deperret (or Du Perret) was a brave and able man who had made a
  large fortune out of agriculture. Like Barbaroux, he was one of the deputies
  for Bouches-du-Rhône, but owing to his prudence and moderation he had escaped
  the fate that had befallen his more brilliant and more hot-headed colleagues.
  He lived, however, in a state of continual apprehension, and he had, not long
  before, been menaced in the Convention by a Jacobin, who had pointed a pistol
  at him. Deperret had, in return, drawn his sword and been threatened with
  arrest.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday's interview with this deputy did not last more than a few
  minutes. They remained standing while she solicited his interest for her
  friend and briefly gave him news of his colleagues, the refugees at Caen. She
  asked for an introduction to Garat, the Minister of the Interior, and
  Deperret promised to wait on her at her <i>hôtel</i> the following morning.
  Anxious that he should not forget the address, she gave him Madame Grollier's
  card that Noël had given her, and wrote on the back&mdash;Corday.</p>

  <p>With that she took her leave and Deperret returned gaily to his
  friends.</p>

  <p>"A curious business!" he cried lightly. "That young woman seems to me an
  adventuress&mdash;there was something very strange about her; well, perhaps I
  shall find out what it is to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He had been, indeed, deeply impressed by the personality of his visitor;
  she was too beautiful for him to be able to take her austerity, her political
  zeal seriously, too feminine for him to attach much importance to her
  business&mdash;surely all that was only a cloak for some romantic
  intrigue!</p>

  <p>While the genial deputy discussed her lightly over his fruit and wine,
  Mlle. de Corday, almost too fatigued to walk, returned to her <i>hôtel</i>.
  She had solved her problem; she would go to Marat's private house and kill
  him there. But the details, how to find out where he lived, how to gain
  admission, she was too weary to work out.</p>

  <p>When she gained her room she at once went to bed and fell into the sleep
  of profound exhaustion until the next day.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>At twelve o'clock, Lauze Deperret, still amused, curious, a little
  touched, came to the <i>hôtel de la Providence</i> and asked for Mlle. de
  Corday. He accompanied her to the Ministry of the Interior, but Garat was
  absent. On Deperret's insisting on an interview, one was arranged for eight
  o'clock that evening; the deputy returned home, the Norman to her
  <i>hôtel</i>; she was truly anxious to help her friend, and very troubled at
  these delays; it would soon be too late for her to help anyone.</p>

  <p>Later in the day Lauze Deperret returned to <i>la Providence</i> to cancel
  the interview with Garat; affairs were becoming worse and worse for the
  <i>Gironde</i>; he feared immediate arrest&mdash;did not Mlle. de Corday see
  that his help was useless? Besides, in the state that Paris was in it was
  pure waste of time to try to push an affair like that of the ex-canoness;
  anxious, however, to please Barbaroux and still curious as to the mysterious
  stranger, he promised to return on the Saturday morning with messages for the
  refugees, and he asked Mlle. de Corday how long she intended to stay in
  Paris. He supposed that she was soon returning to Caen.</p>

  <p>"You will soon," she replied, "have news of me." Then she added
  earnestly&mdash;"I have some advice to give you. Leave the Convention, rejoin
  your colleagues at Caen."</p>

  <p>"My place is at Paris, I cannot abandon it."</p>

  <p>"You are committing a folly. Once more, leave Paris, I implore you. Listen
  to me, and fly before to-morrow evening."</p>

  <p>Deperret was impressed by the warning, moved by her beauty, her sincerity;
  he no longer thought her an <i>intrigante</i>. Promising to return he left
  her; the name of Marat had not been mentioned between them.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In the <i>hôtel</i> bedroom, using the cheap pen, ink and paper bought for
  her by the waiter, Charlotte de Corday wrote her testament, her
  <i>apologia</i>. Not far away in another <i>hôtel</i> bedroom Adam Lux was
  making ready for distribution copies of his pamphlet to be published the next
  day. Jean-Paul Marat was scribbling in his bath; the intense heat consumed
  all of them like the grip of a fever, but could not check their inexhaustible
  energy.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday entitled her document&mdash;<i>L'Adresse aux Français</i>;
  it was in the same style as Adam Lux's <i>Avis aux citoyens français</i>; it
  might have been by the same hand. She had not read the pamphlet of the young
  German; the similarity in thought and style was due to the likeness of their
  minds and circumstances. Adam Lux had resolved to commit suicide in order to
  shock the country into rejecting the Terrorists. Charlotte de Corday also
  intended to sacrifice herself for the same end, but before giving her own
  life she intended to take that of the tyrant.</p>

  <p>This manifesto, for all its piercing and poignant sincerity, showed little
  individuality, so exactly was it couched in the language of the times, in the
  style of the books that Mlle. de Corday had read so often and with such
  passion and admiration. Not only was it so similar to the pamphlet by Adam
  Lux that was fast leaving the press, it might have been a speech by
  Barbaroux, or an excerpt from the indignant rhapsodies with which the
  <i>abbé</i> Raynal had interrupted his <i>Histoire des Deux Indes</i>.</p>

  <p>The object of this writing was to justify the author's action and to clear
  herself from any criminal intent. She stated that she wished to accept the
  full result of her action, and that she would not, like Paris, the assassin
  of M. Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau, commit suicide after the deed; she wished
  to serve her country, to offer the utmost sacrifice&mdash;perhaps her head,
  carried above the mob, across the capital would serve&mdash;"as a rallying
  point for all the friends of the Law." She hoped to be the last victim of
  anarchy and hoped that the universe she had avenged would declare that she
  had deserved well of humanity by striking down "the savage beast fattened by
  blood."</p>

  <p>In a paragraph that breathed the spirit and the rhythm of Corneille, she
  wrote:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"When Marat, vilest of scoundrels, whose mere name stands
  for numberless crimes, falls under the avenging knife, the <i>Mountain</i>
  will tremble. Danton and Robespierre will pale, and all the other brigands
  seated on their bloody thrones will shiver before the thunder that the gods,
  avengers of humanity, only suspend in order to make their final downfall more
  awful."</p><br>

  <p>When she had finished writing this testament, Mlle. de Corday pinned to
  her act of baptism&mdash;"<i>pour montrer ce que peut la plus faible main
  conduite par un entier dévouement</i>."</p>

  <p>She then placed the two documents with her clothes ready for the morning,
  extinguished her candle which had nearly burnt away, and slept peacefully on
  the hired bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>By six o'clock next morning Mlle. de Corday was in the <i>Palais Egalité,
  ci-devant Palais-Royal</i>, the vast property of the millionaire <i>Citoyen
  Prince</i>, the one man in the Assembly who had the supreme cynicism to seat
  himself next the foul Marat.</p>

  <p>She wore her dress of brown-striped piqué, a white fichu, her black hat
  with the cords and tassels, she carried gloves, a fan, a bag with
  handkerchief, watch, keys, and money.</p>

  <p>The day was beginning in great heat; everything was dry and dusty. Mlle.
  de Corday seated herself on one of the benches in the garden, where the
  plants had long wilted and drooped from the incessant July blaze.</p>

  <p>She had come to buy something and the shops were not yet opened, so she
  waited patiently.</p>

  <p>There were few people abroad; the <i>Palais Egalité</i>, from which the
  <i>ci-devant duc</i> d'Orléans drew a huge revenue, was let out in
  restaurants, shops, flats, gambling hells, houses of ill fame and frequented
  by the vilest purveyors of shameful pleasures and their cynical, desperate
  and idle clients.</p>

  <p>At this hour the ugly traffic of the day had not begun; behind closed
  doors, shuttered windows, in cellars and in garrets, the vicious, the hunted,
  the wretched, the harlot, the pander, the gambler, dozed in exhaustion while
  the traders counted over the night's takings, the foul <i>salons</i> were
  swept clear of dirty cards and broken bottles, and the dining-rooms tidied
  for the coming day.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday knew nothing of this obscure and obscene world hidden
  behind the neat windows of the prim façade or under the shadows of the trim
  gallery. She did not guess at the proscribed nobles resting on the beds of
  the <i>filles publiques</i>, at the debauched rakes asleep in the gambling
  hells, at the vice, misery, lust, greed and bitterness housed in the
  <i>Palais Egalité</i>&mdash;to her it was merely a row of shops where she
  hoped to find what she had to purchase.</p>

  <p>It was extremely hot, she was glad to sit still and rest, there was yet
  some freshness left in the morning air not yet soiled by the city. Several
  churches were open, but it did not occur to her to go to any of them to pray;
  her confession and her absolution were in her complete dedication of herself
  to a sublime purpose.</p>

  <p>While she waited for the morning to creep on, Adam Lux, in the <i>hôtel
  des Patriotes Hollandais</i>, was listening to the reproaches of his
  countryman and colleague, Forster, on the indiscretions of his pamphlet.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," Forster argued, "your intentions are noble, your courage is
  heroic, but it is for us, the deputation from Mayence, to remain
  neutral&mdash;by your rashness you will bring trouble not only on yourself,
  but on us who have not, so far, been molested by the government."</p>

  <p>But the young German was as fixed in his principles as the young Norman
  waiting for the shops to open in the <i>Palais Egalité</i>. He told Forster
  that he was resolved to say what he thought, cost what it would, the idea of
  sacrifice was still uppermost in his exalted mind&mdash;the
  <i>enthousiasme</i> of his doctoral thesis still inspired his actions. But,
  just and generous as Mlle. de Corday had been when she left Caen without
  breathing a word of her intention to anyone, Adam Lux wrote a letter to
  Forster, in which he declared that the pamphlet had been published without
  the knowledge of the other deputies from Mayence.</p>

  <p>While Mlle. de Corday and Adam Lux were thus employed on the warm morning
  of July 13th, a deputation from the Convention waited on Marat to condole
  with him on the ill health that kept him from his seat in the Assembly.</p>

  <p>They found him eaten to the bone by his "leprosy," as they named the
  disease that had attacked him, and hunched in his bath, where he scribbled
  his inflammatory articles; the man was dying and in such frightful torments
  that death could be nothing but a release, but his friends consoled
  themselves that <i>l'ami du peuple</i> was merely suffering from a passing
  indisposition; he was, indeed, slightly more at ease on this morning of July
  13th than he had been for some days, enjoying one of those intervals of
  comparative freedom from distress that come even in the most agonising
  illnesses.</p>

  <p>In these same morning hours the royalist Comte de Puisaye,
  second-in-command to Wimpfen, marched to his fate at Récourt, where his
  defeat ended the rising in Calvados and caused the flight of the
  <i>Girondists</i> from Caen.</p>

  <p>One by one the shops in the open gallery of the <i>Palais Egalité</i>
  opened; shutters were taken down, doors unlocked, the slatternly figure of a
  street woman, the congested face of a drunkard, appeared for a second behind
  the tattered curtains of the flats above the shops, the unclean night-birds
  began to shuffle out of their haunts in search of food.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday did not know that such people existed, she did not even
  see them; the strength of her purpose created a supreme isolation round her;
  she rose, walked along the pavement, already hot, and found among the shops,
  already beginning to display their wares, what she wanted&mdash;at No. 177 in
  the arcade was what she sought; there a certain Bardin sold cutlery; already
  the lad had taken down the shutters and there was in the window a shining
  array of knives.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The cutler was pleased to see this early customer; no doubt a young
  housewife making her own domestic purchases, as so many gentlewomen were now
  forced to do&mdash;but she only required a knife, a cheap kitchen knife. She
  selected one of ordinary size, a flexible blade six inches long, with an
  ebony handle to which were attached two rings to suspend to the cook's waist
  or a shelf.</p>

  <p>She paid forty <i>sous</i> for this common knife and its case and left the
  shop to saunter again up and down the arcade, now gradually filling with
  shoppers and idlers.</p>

  <p>It was too early for her, under any pretext, to try to see Marat, so she
  walked up and down, entirely detached from her strange surroundings, the
  knife in her long pocket with the small amount of money left to her, her gold
  watch, her passport and her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>A newspaper boy came running past with the morning papers; Mlle. de Corday
  bought one for two sous and, returning to her bench in the dusty gardens,
  opened the flimsy sheets. The first item of news that caught her eye was the
  condemnation to death the evening before of nine of the twenty-six citizens
  of Orleans accused of an attempt to murder Bourdon de la Crosnière; they were
  to mount the guillotine, in the red shirts of murderers, this 13th of
  July.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The case was peculiarly revolting and such as sufficed to make an Adam
  Lux, a Charlotte de Corday, wish to quit an earth where such atrocities were
  permitted.</p>

  <p>This Bourdon, a drunken ruffian, was Marat's lieutenant in Orleans
  (<i>Commissaire National près de la Haute-Cour d'Orléans</i>), where he had
  made himself loathed by his debaucheries and cruelties.</p>

  <p>As he passed blind drunk one night before the town hall, the sentinel
  challenged him; Bourdon replied by firing his pistol, the sentinel thrust at
  him with his bayonet and wounded him in the arm.</p>

  <p>Bourdon raised the cry of a plot to assassinate him and twenty innocent
  citizens who had never heard of the incident were dragged before the
  Revolutionary Tribunal of Orleans.</p>

  <p>"This little bleeding (<i>saignée</i>) must be cured by a larger one,"
  said Bourdon.</p>

  <p>Nine men were to die because Marat's creature, by his own fault, had
  received a slight wound.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday left her paper on the bench and hastened on her way; she
  was impatient to accomplish what she had to do; she touched her bodice to
  reassure herself that her testament, folded in eight and pinned with her
  birth certificate inside her dress, was safe.</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock; she made her way to a <i>fiacre</i> stand that she
  had noticed on the <i>place des Victoires</i>, and, calling the first driver,
  asked him to take her to Marat's residence.</p>

  <p>She did not know the address; neither, to her surprise, did the
  <i>cocher</i>; only after some consultation with his fellows did the man
  procure this&mdash;<i>No. 20, rue des Cordeliers</i>, near the <i>rue
  l'Ecole-de-Médecine</i>. Mlle. de Corday in the shabby vehicle, shaken over
  the rough roads, noted on a scrap of paper she had in her pocket this address
  and the way that led there; it might be necessary for her to return and Paris
  was confusing, so much larger than she had imagined.</p>

  <p>She was calm, still detached from everything, still absorbed in what she
  had to do; only, now and then, the strange sights of the great city aroused
  her distant unmoved curiosity; her acute intelligence observed all those
  details that her emotions ignored.</p>

  <p>In the same fashion she thought of her late home in Caen&mdash;Madame de
  Bretteville would be rousing, opening her shutters to the Norman sunshine,
  Azor and Minette stirring, the decorous servants going about their monotonous
  duties, perhaps one of them would find the little silk
  embroidery&mdash;"Shall I do it?&mdash;Shall I not?" which she had forgotten
  to move from behind her mirror.</p>

  <p>She saw this as a dream within a dream&mdash;like the little picture
  revealed by a peep through the wrong end of a perspective glass.</p>

  <p>Marat inhabited No. 20 <i>rue des Cordeliers</i>, a dull humble house,
  known as <i>l'hôtel de Cahors</i>, where he had installed the printing press
  for which Simonne Evrard had paid, and where he lived with her in a squalid
  apartment, of which she paid the rent of 450 <i>francs</i>, and which had
  been taken in her name.</p>

  <p>The <i>porte-cochère</i> was flanked by shops, passing under it Mlle. de
  Corday found herself in a sombre courtyard, with a well in one corner; to the
  right, under an arcade, was a staircase which led to the first floor, which,
  the <i>cocher</i> had told her, was occupied by Marat.</p>

  <p>She was turning up this stairway when the <i>concierge</i>, Marie-Barbe
  Aubain, <i>mariée Pain</i>, who occupied the <i>rez-de-chaussée</i>, stopped
  her, asking her her business.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday turned away without replying and leaving the building
  walked up the street; she returned at about half-past eleven and quickly ran
  up the dismal stone stairway before the woman Aubain saw her; a circular iron
  ramp edged this stone stairway and at the top there was a landing giving on
  the courtyard by two windows.</p>

  <p>In front of the stair-head was the door of Marat's flat; the bell-pull had
  been broken and replaced by an iron curtain rod to which was attached a cheap
  handle.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday rang.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by Catherine Evrard, the sister of Simonne; Marat's
  own devoted sister, Albertine, the maker of watches, had returned to Geneva
  with another brother; but these women waited on the sick man, the two sisters
  and a cook named Jeannette Maréchal. Despite these three attendants, Marat's
  place was carelessly kept; it was one of his affectations to be dirty and
  stinking, like the gutter ruffians whose cause he espoused; he enjoyed the
  distress felt even by the least squeamish of his colleagues at his proximity,
  only Philippe <i>Egalité</i> could sit next him on the benches of the
  Assembly, any other elements of hygiene that he might have learned in his
  medical career were forgotten; nor did the three women who administered to
  him trouble him by any insistence on cleanliness or any observance of
  sanitary precautions; the sombre and neglected apartment was like a foul
  shrine where squatted an obscene idol&mdash;Marat, decaying alive.</p>

  <p>When the door was opened to Mlle. de Corday, she was offended by the
  rancid odour of coarse fish frying in cheap oil, and glimpsed a dismal little
  antechamber, with a rudely-tiled floor and a wall covered with a dirty white
  paper with a design of broken columns; this hall was lit only by the window
  which opened into the kitchen beyond.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday asked for an interview with Marat; she declared that she
  had some "very interesting and very important things to say to him."</p>

  <p>Catherine Evrard replied rudely that Marat was sick, that no one could see
  him, and that the visitor could take herself off.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday asked if she could return&mdash;even in three or four
  days' time?</p>

  <p>Simonne Evrard now came up and supported her sister&mdash;no appointment
  could possibly be made for any day, however distant, for no one could say
  when Marat's health would be re-established. The door was shut in Mlle. de
  Corday's face.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>She returned on foot, through the midday heat, to the <i>hôtel de la
  Providence</i>, retracing her way along the streets she had so carefully
  noted; she did not take a <i>fiacre</i>, as she had to hoard what little
  money she had left.</p>

  <p>Her serene calm was not shaken; but it was more difficult, more horrible
  than she had thought it could be; to slay the beast one had to descend into
  the slime.</p>

  <p>Always, she had imagined the deed being done in the open air, under the
  sky, or in the grave chamber of the Assembly, some venue formal, important,
  where she might meet an instant death that would wipe out even her
  identity.</p>

  <p>But this revolting background, the sordid lodging, the two low women, who
  appeared to her sluts, wretches, Marat's concubines, perhaps his attendant
  furies! Never had she, the fastidious gentlewoman, set foot in such a
  dwelling or spoken to such people, save when, in the blue robe of a
  <i>pensionnaire</i> at the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, she had gone on some
  errand of charity to create herself order and cleanliness.</p>

  <p>And Marat himself! What a foul beast it must be who lurked in such a
  lair.</p>

  <p>What must she see or hear that was repulsive, disgusting, loathsome before
  her task was done?</p>

  <p>But her strength did not falter; when so much had been overcome, shrinking
  nerves, a feminine squeamishness, must be vanquished.</p>

  <p>The rebuff, the delay, first shook, then nerved her; it must be done, and
  done to-day.</p>

  <p>There was yet another sacrifice to make, that of her fastidious integrity;
  she had never yet condescended to a subterfuge, not even to please her father
  and brother last year in the matter of the King's health. But Raynal had
  written&mdash;"One does not owe truth to one's tyrants."</p>

  <p>As she ate her simple meal she revolved with her clear Norman intelligence
  her plan; when the <i>déjeuner</i> was over she went up to her room; the heat
  had exhausted her, the knife was heavy in her pocket, she took it out and
  laid it on the marble-topped commode.</p>

  <p>There was still some of the cheap paper left that the waiter had bought
  for her; she took a sheet and wrote quickly, in her large, masculine
  hand:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I come from Caen. Your love of your country must make you
  wish to know the plots that are hatching here. I await your reply.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Charlotte de Corday. Hôtel de la Providence."</p><br>

  <p>She went out and posted the letter, carefully addressed. How long would it
  take to be delivered? A few hours, she was told.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

    <p class="caption">Jean-Paul Marat. Portrait by Joseph Boze, 1793.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She returned to her <i>hôtel</i> bedroom to wait. The day drew on, late
  afternoon, early evening; she sat down and wrote again:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I wrote to you this morning, Marat, did you receive my
  letter? Can I hope for a moment's interview? If you have received it I hope
  you will not refuse me, seeing how interesting the business is. My great
  unhappiness gives me a right to your protection."</p><br>

  <p>She had employed flattery for the first time in her life; surely this
  sacrifice would not be unavailing? The tyrant's vanity, curiosity, would
  doubtless be touched; the letter went into the <i>petite poste</i>; it would
  arrive, she was informed, at the <i>bureau</i> at the <i>rue des
  Cordeliers</i> about seven o'clock that evening. About seven, then, she would
  return to the sordid apartment. Surely, if she arrived at the same time as
  her letter, he would admit her to that "moment's interview" which would be
  sufficient for her purpose.</p>

  <p>There were, first, other aspects of her pride to be sacrificed; she, who
  had never used even the most delicate coquetry towards any of the high-minded
  gentlemen of her acquaintance, who had not altered her toilette or her manner
  for a De Tournélis, a Bougran-Maingré, a Barbaroux, adorned herself to seduce
  the monster. She remembered the gross admiration of the coarse
  <i>Montagnard</i> in the diligence, she had heard that Marat, black Calvinist
  as he was, was fond of women, she remembered the two sisters who had eyed her
  with instinctive jealousy on the dirty threshold of the apartment, and it
  occurred to her that if he heard her voice at his door and looked out of his
  room, he would, if attracted by her appearance, grant her an audience. Judith
  had curled her hair and poured a delicious perfume over her body in the
  service of the Lord.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday took out her most charming gown, a loose white Indian
  muslin with self-spots, transferred to the pocket her handkerchief, her
  money, her watch; inside the low bodice she pinned her testament and the last
  number of the <i>Bulletin de Calvados</i>. She exchanged the black cords on
  her hat for three bright green ribbons; she asked Madame Grollier to send in
  a hairdresser.</p>

  <p>The assistant Person, a lad of eighteen, came round from the
  <i>perruquier</i> Férieux, whose establishment was near by, in the <i>rue des
  Vieux Augustins</i>.</p>

  <p>He combed, dressed and arranged the brilliant locks in a more fashionable
  manner than they had ever known before, disposing the natural curls loosely
  round the beautiful face and gathering them in a knot behind to fall over the
  shoulders to the waist. On the front he sprayed powder, making the chestnut
  gold tresses <i>blond cendré</i>; he performed his task indifferently, as a
  matter of routine; as he worked he perceived, without interest, a knife in
  its case lying on the marble-topped commode.</p>

  <p>When Mlle. de Corday had paid the hairdresser and he had gone, she took
  off her dressing-jacket and carefully folded over her shoulders a fichu of a
  delicate rose-coloured gauze, which passed round her waist and tied
  behind.</p>

  <p>She then placed the knife in her pocket and left the <i>hôtel</i>, walking
  to the <i>fiacre</i> stand, where she took a vehicle and ordered the man to
  drive to No. 20, <i>rue des Cordeliers</i>; it was seven o'clock when she
  arrived; she told the <i>cocher</i> to wait, and passed between the two shops
  across the courtyard; the porter's box was empty, so that it was without
  being challenged that she reached the door of Marat's dwelling; her
  delicately gloved hand rang the broken bell. Jeannette Maréchal opened the
  door, holding a medicine spoon; behind her the <i>concierge</i> Pain was
  folding copies of <i>L'Ami du peuple</i> ready for the morning sale.</p>

  <p>Before Mlle. de Corday could state her business two other people arrived
  at Marat's door: Pillet, a young man bringing an invoice, and close behind
  him, Laurent Bas, a street porter employed in the distribution of Marat's
  paper; he had come to take some copies of the current issue to the War
  Office, and had brought with him a parcel of paper from the <i>Maison</i>
  Boichard.</p>

  <p>This last issue of <i>L'Ami du peuple</i>, No. 242, dated July 14th, was
  of some importance; it denounced the inaction of the Committee of Public
  Safety and accused Charles Barbaroux of being a royalist and "an enemy of the
  country"; in brief, this popular journal, which appeared under the ill-chosen
  motto, "<i>Ut redeat miseris abeat fortuna superbis</i>," demanded more
  blood.</p>

  <p>The young man Pillet went in to Marat and Mlle. de Corday advanced into
  the passage; the woman Pain, with a lewd grin at the seductive elegance of
  the stranger, stood in her way behind the freshly-folded pile of newspapers;
  having delivered his invoice Pillet came out of Marat's room and left the
  flat; Mlle. de Corday continued to argue with the <i>concierge</i>, who was
  one-eyed; a coincidence as her own mother and uncle had had the same
  defect.</p>

  <p>Tenaciously and with superb tranquillity the Norman stood her ground: had
  her letters been received, could she have an interview?</p>

  <p>The woman Pain could not, she declared, tell, with the huge correspondence
  that came to Marat, what letter had or had not been received, but the visitor
  could not see the citizen deputy, who was ill and in his bath.</p>

  <p>Into this altercation came Simonne Evrard; Mlle. de Corday turned to her,
  imploring an interview:</p>

  <p>"I have some important revelations to make."</p>

  <p>"Now, it is impossible, perhaps in two or three days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Marat, having heard the argument, called out from his room. Simonne went
  into him and Mlle. de Corday remained, resting against the wall covered by
  the paper with the broken columns, staring down at the one-eyed woman folding
  the papers that were to carry the denunciation of Charles Barbaroux all over
  Paris.</p>

  <p>Simonne came out, sullenly obedient to her master; Marat would see the
  citizeness from Caen.</p>

  <p>Jean-Paul Marat was seated in his bath in the tiny room adjoining, by
  means of another little closet, his bedchamber, which gave on to the passage
  and was lit by two windows which opened on to the street; beyond these
  chambers was a <i>salon</i>; these rooms, with the kitchen, composed the poor
  apartment, which was miserably furnished and poorly kept, the ignorant
  mismanagement of stupid women adding to the unavoidable squalor of
  poverty.</p>

  <p>The few pieces of furniture that the place boasted had been bought with
  Simonne Evrard's small capital, added to by what petty pilferings Marat had
  been able to make in the accounts of the <i>Comité de Surveillance</i>; he
  was extremely poor and harassed by debts; <i>L' Ami du people</i> did not
  make much profit from the <i>sous</i> of the <i>sans-culottes</i> and Marat
  had no other means; despite Barbaroux's flamboyant gibes about <i>les
  misérables engorgés d'or dans leurs superbes voitures</i>, the
  <i>Montagnards</i> had not gained worldly wealth by their political triumph,
  not that they were averse from pillage, but by the time they gained power
  there was nothing left to pillage.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday entered the bathroom and the two disciples of Jean-Jacques
  Rousseau, having come by such different ways to this meeting, were face to
  face: the woman of twenty-four, the man of more than twice her age, separated
  by nationality, he the Southerner, she the Norman; by religion, he the
  Calvinist, she the Roman Catholic; he of the people, of obscure and mean
  descent, she of noble blood, untainted and proud for generations; she so fair
  and pure, healthy and delicate as a rose, he dying, foul, corrupt and
  hideous.</p>

  <p>The scene that Mlle. de Corday beheld had all the horror of an
  hallucination; never had she imagined such a spectacle as this; Marat was
  seated in his bath, which was <i>sabot</i> shaped, which had been painted
  fawn colour and was nearly black from dirt; he was nude to the waist, an old
  dressing-gown thrown across his shoulders. Across the bath was a plank of
  wood that served as a desk, on this were paper, a pen, a common bottle of ink
  tilted by a billet of wood. Marat's huge head, so disproportionate to his
  meagre body, was bound by a napkin dripping vinegar that hung in the clotted
  masses of his heavy, greasy black hair.</p>

  <p>The face itself was terrible beyond even what Mlle. de Corday had
  supposed; the features were swollen and crushed, the frightful humid lips and
  the sunken cheeks were the same livid hue, the ghastly tint that the olive
  complexion of a Mediterranean native takes on in mortal sickness; this
  lead-coloured tint was disfigured by scabs and sores, the sparse hairs of
  ragged eyebrows, the coarse stubble of a half-shaven beard, the naked body
  was scaled as if by leprosy, and beneath the shrunken flesh showed the
  pitiful undeveloped frame bent by rickets.</p>

  <p>From this almost inhuman mask looked out two piercing yellow-grey eyes,
  infected with bile and blood, but serene and formidable.</p>

  <p>Behind the bath was a map of France nailed to the wall underneath a shelf
  on which were a pair of pistols, a placard showing the one word <i>Mort</i>;
  on the dirty floor was a copy of <i>L'Ami du peuple</i>; on the sill of the
  small window stood two plates of brains and sweetbreads, ready for
  supper.</p>

  <p>The closet was so small that there was only room for two people; near the
  door into the passage was a kitchen stool; the other door leading into the
  cabinet of the bedroom was open.</p>

  <p>Without replying to Marat's greeting Mlle. de Corday sank down on the
  stool. He surveyed her curiously, wistfully; with her brilliant beauty,
  heightened by a superhuman emotion, her loose white summer dress, her
  rose-coloured gauze over her lovely bust and shoulders, her green ribbons,
  the powdered curls and elegant air, the girl resembled the aristocratic
  ladies with whom he had once mingled when he was in the employ of M.
  d'Artois, and whom he had coveted, and loathed because he coveted. Since he
  had become the demi-god of the mob the grim Calvinist had had his
  gallantries, which had been, however, circumscribed by his person and his
  purse, no such dainty gentlewoman as this had ever entered the lodging
  presided over by Simonne Evrard, no such fragrant creature had ever come to
  one of Marat's rendezvous; and he was not without his appreciation of beauty,
  he had written love verses in his time which were at least as good as those
  composed by the seductive Barbaroux.</p>

  <p>He spoke to her gently, in that sonorous male voice that came oddly from a
  feeble body&mdash;what was her errand and what could he do for her?</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday knew that the supreme moment had come; her energy sank
  down a second before flaring up to the final climax; she turned her blue eyes
  to the map of France to give herself courage&mdash;had not even Judith paused
  to utter a prayer? "Lord God, strengthen me."</p>

  <p>Below the map was the word <i>Death</i> on the placard; she had only to
  think of the massacres committed&mdash;nine innocent men that
  morning&mdash;of the massacres planned, to stifle any rising surge of pity
  for the monster who at near sight was a feeble, sick, defenceless man; but
  the effort to maintain her calm brought a nervous sob to convulse her throat.
  The closet was so disgusting, the air so foul. Marat comforted her, asking
  her to tell him her trouble, her danger; he was flattered that this lovely
  aristocrat should have run to him for protection.</p>

  <p>The sound of her lover's voice using gentle tones to another woman brought
  Simonne Evrard into the room; the excuse for her intrusion was a carafe of
  water flavoured with almond and in which floated small cubes of ice; a
  favourite remedy of Marat's against his feverish thirst; Simonne poured out a
  glass of the mixture and Marat drank; she asked if it was to his taste? He
  replied that she might, next time, increase the flavour.</p>

  <p>With that the woman retired sullenly, taking with her the two plates of
  brains to re-heat; she closed the door behind her; Mlle. de Corday now
  remained alone with Marat, who continued to press her gently as to her
  business. She came from Caen? Well, what was happening at Caen?</p>

  <p>She had recovered from her moment of agony and answered calmly, giving him
  the details he desired on the movements of the <i>Girondists</i>, the rising
  of the citizens, the number of armed men, the names of their leaders.</p>

  <p>Marat pushed aside the proof he was correcting, seized a piece of paper,
  and noted down question and answer.</p>

  <p>He demanded the names of the deputies in Caen, the movements of the
  refugees were not well known in Paris.</p>

  <p>She gave them to him, Pétion, Louvet, Guadet, Buzot, Barbaroux...</p>

  <p>Marat's eyes shone with pleasure; this news came opportunely for his yet
  unpublished article attacking the handsome Provençal; he felt the approach of
  a gratified hate&mdash;an especial hate for men like Buzot and Barbaroux,
  these seductive heroes of romance, these elegant gentlemen, young, healthy,
  charming, who were all that he would have liked to have been.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday had risen and approached him; she had her hand in her
  pocket as if she sought for her handkerchief; her lovely presence was
  soothing to him in his torment.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Buzot, Barbaroux, well, I shall send them all to the guillotine in
  a few days."</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday took her hand from her pocket; Marat, stooping over
  his writing, had allowed the old robe to fall off his shoulders; his bare
  torso was exposed; the girl leaned forward; she had drawn the knife from the
  pocket, from the sheath; with one passionate movement she drove it home,
  straight downwards through the naked breast, up to the hilt, then drew it out
  and cast it down on the plank where lay the list of proscribed
  <i>Girondists</i>.</p>

  <p>With a raucous cry Marat fell backwards; the door was instantly thrown
  open by the three women folding the papers in the passage outside, Simonne
  Evrard, Jeannette Maréchal, the one-eyed woman Pain; they saw Marat stiffened
  in agony, his eyes staring, his tongue protruding and blood gushing from the
  gash above his heart.</p>

  <p>With yells of horror the cook, Maréchal, and Simonne Evrard began to drag
  the dying man from the bath, while Pain, the <i>concierge</i>, rushed
  downstairs, shrieking, to rouse the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday passed through the closet and the antechamber, came
  out into the passage and advanced to the outer door; she had told the
  <i>fiacre</i> to wait, she had thought there might be a chance, a wild
  chance, that she would be able to escape in the confusion, escape at least
  from the first blind fury of the monster's underlings.</p>

  <p>Laurent Bas, the street porter, barred her way; she backed before him and
  he drove her into the <i>salon</i> and knocked her down with a chair, holding
  this over her to keep her prostrate; she struggled to rise, again he knocked
  her down and struck her; another lodger in the building, one Cuisinier, a
  lemonade-seller, came running in at Bas's cries of "Help! Help!"</p>

  <p>These two men tied the girl's hands behind her back with their
  handkerchiefs and mounted guard over her; resigned and impassive, she leant
  against the mantelpiece.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A crowd of howling, struggling people had soon filled the small room, hot
  from the sun of the burning July day; Marat had been carried by the three
  women to his bed; he was dead, even as they lifted him; gouts of blood marked
  his passage; in a vain fury of grief and tenderness Simonne Evrard placed her
  hand over the gaping wound; there was something heart-breaking in her woe,
  which had the unreasoning agony of a dog who has lost his master.</p>

  <p>Police, doctors came pushing through the crowd; the <i>cocher</i> who had
  driven Mlle. de Corday was still waiting at the <i>porte-cochère</i> and
  eagerly directed the surge of curious yelling neighbours and passers-by to
  Marat's apartment; from the <i>rues La Harpe, Haute-feuille, l'Observance,
  des Vieilles-Boucheries</i> the mob pressed. The apartment was soon full, the
  <i>sans-culottes</i> filled the stairway, the courtyard, the street; men and
  women had one desire&mdash;Marat, their friend, their idol had been killed by
  an aristocrat, a virago, a fury; eh, well, kill her, and instantly!</p>

  <p>Through this foul hurly-burly a surgeon-dentist, one Lafondée, forced his
  way; his window overlooked Marat's rooms and he had seen Laurent Bas standing
  over a woman, shouting abuse&mdash;<i>Scélérate! Coquine</i>!</p>

  <p>With an air of authority this educated man Lafondée made his way to the
  bedchamber, which he cleared of all save the shrieking Simonne; he asked the
  other women for hot water, linen for a compress; too late, there was no
  flutter at heart or wrist; with open jaws from which the tongue hung out,
  with staring eyes, Marat lay dead.</p>

  <p>Lafondée sent someone to the near-by School of Surgery to fetch a doctor;
  in a few moments arrived Jacques-Philippe Guellard, commissioner of police of
  the <i>section du Théatre Français</i>, who had chanced to hear the clamour
  in the streets; he was quickly followed by Dr. Pelletan, Surgeon-in-Chief of
  the <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i>, and professor at the School of Medicine.</p>

  <p>These two men, by virtue of their professions, Law, Medicine, and their
  own coolness and weight, were allowed through the cursing, jostling, filthy
  mob that choked the apartment and all entries to it, rendering the heated
  unventilated rooms almost insupportable.</p>

  <p>Guellard and Pelletan found instant traces of the violent end of the man
  who had dealt in violence. The bath was filled with blood-stained water,
  there was a trail of blood through the cabinet across the bed-chamber to the
  bed where Marat lay in a spreading stain that soaked into coarse coverlets
  and sheets.</p>

  <p>Pelletan could only confirm the death of Marat amid <i>une mare de
  sang</i>. With professional coolness he proceeded to draw up his deposition;
  it had been a clean, a skilful blow; death had been as instantaneous as that
  given by the blade of the guillotine; "the knife penetrated by the clavicle
  on the right side, between the first and second ribs, traversed the lung, and
  opened the heart, which accounts for the blood which left the wound in
  torrents..."</p>

  <p class="poem">"Te baigner dans le sang fut tes seuls délices,<br>
  Baigne-toi dans le tien et reconnois les dieux!"<br>
  &mdash;Chénier.</p>

  <p>While the doctor was occupied with the man of blood soaking in his own
  blood, the Commissioner of Police, Guellard, who had been joined by some
  soldiers of the National Guard, entered the <i>salon</i> to arrest the
  assassin; he had to use all his authority to keep in bounds the rage of the
  crowd inflamed by the agonised shrieks of Simonne and the yells of Jeannette
  Maréchal, who brandished the blood-stained knife; several other police
  arrived from the <i>Mairie</i> and helped to keep some order.</p>

  <p>It was nearly eight o'clock; the postman arrived with Mlle. de Corday's
  second letter:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Marat, have you received my letter? Can I hope for a
  moment's interview?"</p>

  <p>The postman pushed through the press; the letter passing from hand to
  hand, reached the Commissioner of Police; he opened it, read it; on the back
  was the address:</p>

  <p>"To the <i>Citoyen Marat, Faubourg Saint-Germain, rue des Cordeliers, à
  Paris.</i>"</p>

  <p>Methodically Guellard wrote underneath:</p>

  <p class="letter">"This letter has not been delivered at the above address;
  it was rendered useless by the admission of the assassin the last time she
  came at half-past seven in the evening, at which hour she committed her
  crime.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Guellard."</p><br>

  <p>The Commissioner, having quelled in some degree the crowd, entered the
  bedroom where Marat lay. The knife, taken from Maréchal, lay beside him,
  Pelletan was in charge, from him Guellard soon learnt the rough outline of
  the murder; Pelletan showed him his certificate attesting the cause of death;
  Guellard sent one of his men to the Committee of Public Safety, another to
  the <i>Conseil de la Commune</i> (Town Council of Paris) with this grave
  news. He then proceeded into the <i>salon</i> to examine the assassin.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Guellard found a fair, serious young gentlewoman, stately and reserved,
  who seemed most grotesquely out of place in these sordid surroundings, in
  this terrible scene; her composure was perfect, without affectation or
  strain. Her hands were tied behind her by a cord that had replaced Bas's
  handkerchief, her delicate white robe, her rose gauze fichu were torn, on the
  floor beside her was her high-crowned hat with the green ribbons, her
  brilliant hair, from which much of the powder had been shaken, hung to her
  waist, her beauty, under these circumstances and in these surroundings, was
  startling.</p>

  <p>She regarded, not with disdain, but with pity, the foul-mouthed women who
  outraged her with indecencies and who were only kept from maltreating her by
  the pikes of the two policemen who guarded her; she glanced with compassion
  at the filthy <i>sans-culottes</i> howling for their overthrown idol.</p>

  <p>She was in no state of hysteric exaltation or mystic trance, she noted all
  that was going on about her with keen intelligence, even with humour; only
  the piercing cries of Simonne saddened her; she winced when these screams of
  agony reached her ears; she had not reckoned on that, that anyone might love
  Marat.</p>

  <p>It was past eight o'clock and the candles were lit as Guellard proceeded
  to question the prisoner; she answered coldly; there was so little to say;
  what she had done, her own identity was easily explained; she was very brief,
  she said nothing of her emotions, her fatigues, her readiness for
  self-sacrifice; she had come to Paris, where she knew no one, to kill
  Marat.</p>

  <p>She was searched; in her pocket a gold watch with the maker's name
  "<i>Duborq de Caen</i>," a silver thimble, a reel of white cotton, her
  passport, a little money, the sheath of the knife, inside her rose fichu the
  testament pinned to her certificate of baptism.</p>

  <p>Guellard quieted the crowd and got them out of the room by telling them
  that if the prisoner was punished on the spot, the plot in which she was
  concerned would never be revealed. It was the only means of saving her life;
  aided by his colleagues he preserved not only this, which she valued so
  little, but her dignity and modesty, which she valued so much. She thanked
  him graciously&mdash;the police were, she said, "brave men above all
  praise."</p>

  <p>Guellard could gain nothing more from her; she was not concealing
  anything; but she had so little to say; she had done what she had to do; she
  wanted the inevitable end.</p>

  <p>"Did you try to escape by the window?" asked Guellard.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of it," she replied, "but I would have left by the door
  if I had not been prevented."</p>

  <p>It was dark and there was little more to be done; the doctors were busy
  with Marat; he must be embalmed, and quickly; the pungent acrid odours of
  aromatics began to overpower the foul smells. Gradually the police pushed the
  people out into the street, where the crowd was suffocating round the
  carriage that Mlle. de Corday had told to wait. Guellard sent out for
  refreshments for his men, and noted the cost, <i>neuf livres</i>.</p>

  <p>Police had been sent to the <i>hôtel de la Providence</i>, to the
  booking-office of the Norman diligence; her few clothes, her parcels of silks
  and chiffons, were turned over&mdash;nothing. On the floor some scraps of
  paper; pieced together they formed a name and address, that of Lauze
  Deperret, friend and defender of Madame Roland, muse and inspiration of the
  <i>Gironde</i>, since June 2nd a prisoner at the <i>abbaye</i>; the waiter at
  <i>la Providence</i> said that a man of about forty, about five foot four,
  wearing yellow trousers and a piqué coat, had called twice on July 12th to
  see the visitor from Caen; the travellers in the coach from Evreux on July
  11th, rounded up by the police, remembered well enough the fair woman
  journeying so strangely alone, with whom the rough gallant had exchanged
  half-serious <i>badinage</i>; she had spoken, these witnesses declared, the
  names of Barbaroux, of Deperret. It was enough; the <i>Gironde</i> had been
  accused of the murder of Lepelletier, of the treason of Dumouriez, they were
  now accused of the murder of Marat&mdash;Charlotte de Corday was the tool of
  the refugees in Caen. Lauze Deperret was arrested.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Four deputies were delegated to examine the prisoner; they arrived,
  hurrying through the hot night, the foul-mouthed crowds, at the lodging of
  Marat, where there was still blood on the floor, in the dirty bath, where the
  doctors were shut in the bedroom doing their best to preserve the hideous
  corpse; it was not easy, the infected flesh corrupted under their hands, the
  poisoned blood rotted, the jaw would not close, the lids would not fall over
  the staring eyes; everything had to be made ready in haste for the embalming;
  J. F. Louis Deschamps, head of the <i>Hôpital de l'Unité</i>, and his
  assistants had a hard task; fearful of their health they burnt large
  quantities of aromatics in every available vessel the women could bring,
  messengers kept running out to buy the costly unguents and spices; never had
  Marat had so much money spent on his neglected body.</p>

  <p>In the <i>salon</i> the prisoner still sat, her hands bound behind her
  back, her dress torn, her glance serene in the light of the candles placed
  lavishly about the room; she had been there several hours, without food or
  water, without change of position, protected by men with pikes, insulted,
  menaced, stared at, sternly questioned, in constant expectation of a savage
  death; the air was foul, the heat intense; it was a martyrdom, but she did
  not wince; she had had time and opportunity to destroy herself, but she did
  not take it; she despised suicide.</p>

  <p>Beside her, on the table, were the modest contents of her pocket, the
  passport, the thimble and reel of cotton, the gold watch, the few pieces of
  money; in front of her were the deputies, her judges, her inquisitors; they
  had nothing to fear from this unarmed girl, so strictly guarded, but they
  kept her bound.</p>

  <p>The spokesman was François Chabot, always the enemy of the <i>Gironde</i>;
  this unfrocked Capuchin, one of Marat's toadies, without ability or presence,
  coarse, vulgar, a low <i>débauché</i>, nick-named because of his red face and
  strutting air, the Turkey, once declared before the Assembly "that the
  citizen Jesus Christ was the first of the <i>sans-culottes</i>; his
  colleagues were men of the same stamp, common, rough;" the prisoner's clear
  glance swept them all, then turned aside indifferently; she had been
  triumphantly justified in her opinion of these men; Marat <i>was</i> the
  leprous horror, these were the low scoundrels the <i>Girondists</i>
  described&mdash;faced by these ignoble enemies, she was completely mistress
  of herself and, in a way, mistress of them by reason of her nobility and her
  calm.</p>

  <p>Chabot at once threatened her with the guillotine, she replied by a smile
  of contempt; astonished, he set himself to question her; she replied briefly,
  with aristocratic detachment: "There is so little to tell and she has told it
  all before;" Chabot found her arrogant, audacious, her courage fascinated
  him; he coveted her brilliant beauty, as so many others coveted it, he
  prolonged his futile questioning in order to gloat over her neck, her bosom,
  her arms, her exquisite face, her scattered hair; he noted in his
  report&mdash;"<i>avec toutes des graces, une taille et un port superbes, elle
  parâit d'un courage à tout entreprendre</i>."</p>

  <p>By this courage, helpless and humiliated as she was, assailed by fatigue,
  she braved and over-awed the lustful ex-monk; when he took up her gold watch,
  greedy of its value, she said, with a smile:</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten that the Capuchins are vowed to poverty?"</p>

  <p>While his colleagues grinned, he asked grimly: "How did you learn to
  strike so well&mdash;direct to the heart of Marat?"</p>

  <p>"The indignation in my heart," she replied, "showed me the way to
  his."</p>

  <p>Chabot was silenced; Legendre took the word, trying to make himself
  important; he wished to show that he also had been in peril from the fury of
  the <i>Gironde</i>.</p>

  <p>"Was it not you who called on me this morning, saying you were a nun?"</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday's glance fell on him in keen contempt.</p>

  <p>"You deceive yourself, citizen," she replied. "A man like you is not big
  enough to be the tyrant of his country, and you are not worth the trouble of
  punishing. Besides, I never had the intention to strike anyone save
  Marat."</p>

  <p>The laugh was turned against Legendre; a young journalist brought his
  bilious face, his dishevelled person, into the room&mdash;Marat's
  pamphleteer, Camille Desmoulins; he noted how this woman made her judges
  ridiculous. Hamard de la Meuse, who contrived to slip into the crowded room,
  observed her demeanour with astonishment and admiration, and noted down every
  detail of what was happening.</p>

  <p>Her testament was read; they had no comment to make, beyond that it was "a
  diatribe."</p>

  <p>What more to do? The prisoner will compromise no one; she insists, with
  great firmness and pride, that no one knew of her purpose, that she has no
  accomplices; she does not mention Barbaroux or Deperret, only by those little
  scraps of paper in her <i>hôtel</i> room do they trace her visit to the
  latter; it is her one error.</p>

  <p>It is nearly two o'clock in the morning; the room is crowded again; Hébert
  is there, the infamous editor of <i>Père Duchêne</i> that the <i>Gironde</i>
  tried in vain to suppress, this sewer rag that is unquotable and should have
  been unprintable, the paper that has covered with obscene abuse all the
  members of the <i>Gironde</i>, Roland and his wife; Hébert, "the vulture with
  the face of a choir-boy"&mdash;ex-lackey, ex-theatre porter&mdash;presses
  forward to stare at this other victim&mdash;two women, the Queen and Madame
  Roland, has he bespattered with that foul language of the gutter, here is a
  third, delivered to his hands; he makes notes for his next issue; <i>Père
  Duchêne</i> will appear to-morrow with these words: "She has the gentleness
  of a cat, which offers a velvet paw in order to scratch better; she appears
  no more troubled than if she had performed the best possible action&mdash;she
  went to prison as tranquilly as if she were going to a ball."</p>

  <p>Hébert, creeping close like a jackal, sees her few coins on the table;
  they suggest to him a libel to inflame the greed and envy of his miserable
  readers; he and Marat were so clever at that, exciting the fury of those who
  have not against those who have&mdash;ah, Marat will write no more articles
  and Hébert is sole master now of the gutter press. "&mdash;her pockets were
  filled with money and several forged <i>assignats</i>."</p>

  <p>Nothing more to do, nothing more to be gained, but Chabot is loth to let
  this astonishing creature, with her voluptuous yet virginal air, escape; he
  sees his chance; a piece of paper shows above the torn fichu, he leans
  forward to thrust his hand into the white bosom; to protect herself from this
  outrage Charlotte de Corday makes a violent movement backwards that breaks
  the fine laces of her bodice; she is exposed, half naked, before her enemies,
  and instantly bends forward so that her long curls hang over her bosom, a
  blush suffusing her face that has been of such a tranquil pallor. In a low
  humble voice she, who has been so proud, asks a favour&mdash;Will they untie
  her hands that she may adjust her dress?</p>

  <p>She achieves the impossible; she awakens, by her innocence, her dignity,
  some chivalry in these men; Drouet, the most decent of the deputies, orders
  her hands to be untied; even Chabot is shamefaced; they occupy themselves
  with the paper she gives them while she knots the broken lace, puts together,
  as best she can, her torn robe, her ragged fichu; this is the first time she
  has been dishevelled in her attire.</p>

  <p>What is this paper? A number of the <i>Bulletin de Calvados</i> relating
  the expulsion of the <i>Girondists</i> of May 3 1st and June 2nd.</p>

  <p>As her hands are untied she may sign her deposition; it is read over; she
  corrects it at several points; her replies have been wrongly reported; she is
  more accurate, cooler than any of them; they make the corrections she
  demands; will she hear it read over again? She thinks this useless; very
  well, let them depart.</p>

  <p>They approach her to tie her hands again; she shows them her wrists,
  cruelly marked by the rough cords pulled so viciously tight; she makes
  another appeal; she has forgotten that this is the Year II of Liberty,
  Equality and Fraternity, she says "<i>Messieurs</i>," she uses very courteous
  the tone of a gentlewoman to inferiors: "If it is indifferent to you,
  <i>Messieurs</i>, whether I suffer or not before I die, I pray you to permit
  that I pull down my sleeves, or put on my gloves under the cords."</p>

  <p>They are abashed; she pulls down her muslin ruffles, she puts on her loose
  gloves, they tie the cords, this time more lightly; Hamard de la Meuse, who
  notes every word she says, "suffocates."</p>

  <p>They take her into the bedroom where, through the fumes of the burning
  pastilles, she can see the corpse of Marat stripped, bandaged.</p>

  <p>"<i>Eh bien</i>, yes, it is I who killed him," she says, and turns aside
  from the horror on the bed; they watch her in vain for pity, regret, remorse;
  she recalls, if they do not, that Marat said, and repeated in the full
  Assembly that two hundred and seventy thousand heads must fall before he was
  satisfied...Outside the crowd seethes in the heavy, hot night, surging round
  the closed doors of the <i>porte-cochère</i>; they gaze keenly, furiously on
  the squares of the lighted window of the <i>salon</i>, where, the rumour
  says, the murderess is being questioned; they stare at that other sinister
  light that flickers from the other window, that of the bedroom, a strong
  light which glows across the street, on the faces of the crowd, which
  illuminates the houses opposite, which is crossed by the dark shadows of
  men&mdash;this leaping glow comes from the bowls of aromatics burnt round the
  corpse of Marat, those shadows are the doctors at their work.</p>

  <p>It is past two o'clock in the morning and at last she appears, surrounded
  by police, followed by Drouet and Chabot, pale, serene, in her summer gown,
  rose and white, which is torn, but on which there is not a single drop of
  blood; her hair has now fallen from the pins, the work of the hairdresser's
  boy is undone, it hangs down to her waist in natural curls.</p>

  <p>There is a violent movement, a violent shout in the crowd; they mean to
  tear her to pieces, she expects, almost wishes that they will do so.</p>

  <p>The <i>fiacre</i> that brought her is still waiting, pressed upon by the
  mob for all those hours; Drouet motions her to enter; she does so, followed
  by the two deputies, it is seven hours since she entered Marat's house; the
  crowd refuses to allow the horse to start&mdash;"To the prison of the
  <i>Abbaye</i>," is the driver's direction, but he cannot obey, the way is
  blocked; the people demand an instant vengeance.</p>

  <p>Drouet has energy and courage; it was he who arrested Louis XVI at
  Varennes; he knows how to make himself obeyed; he stands up in the carriage
  and commands loudly the people to allow the carriage to pass: "In the name of
  the law."</p>

  <p>The mob surrounding the carriage falls back; a way is made, the horse
  proceeds; the prisoner has her first, her only moment of weakness; Drouet
  finds her half fainting in her place.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," she murmurs, "that I am still alive?"</p>

  <p>She is surprised that Drouet should have any authority over the crowd
  which had been represented to her as cannibals; she is astonished that they
  have any respect for the law; twice that day she had been certain of death,
  twice the law had saved her; she recovers her serenity as the doors of the
  <i>Abbaye</i> are reached by the driver of the hired <i>fiacre</i>.</p>

  <p>The news rushes through Paris, "<i>Marat est mort, assassiné</i>!"
  Robespierre, in a panic, rushes to the shelter of the Clubs; armed bands run
  through the streets of Paris yelling, "<i>Marat est mort</i>!"</p>

  <p>In Calvados the Comte de Puisaye falls back with his shamefully routed
  troops who were to have marched on Paris; in Caen, Barbaroux, Buzot and their
  fellows make ready for their last desperate flight with the broken battalions
  of Normandy.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux runs out of his <i>hôtel</i> to learn what, in a city of blood
  and tumult, is this new cause for tumult; the streets are hot, foul, there is
  the rattle of drums, the gleam of bayonets, of pikes; Lux hears the echoing
  shout in the lantern-shot dark: "<i>Marat est mort! Assassiné par une femme
  du Calvados</i>!"</p>

  <p>In the prison of the <i>abbaye</i> Charlotte de Corday is questioned once
  more, then falls asleep on her rude bed in the dismal cell.</p>

  <p>July 13th, 1793, is over; she has achieved her task, she can take her
  rest.</p>

  <p>"Marat is dead! Slain by a woman of Calvados!"</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">July 14th, 1793&mdash;the Festival of Liberty, the fourth
  anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.</p>

  <p>Paris was in a tumult&mdash;a deep-seated plot was feared. The
  <i>Montagnards</i> were alarmed, some of them were afraid&mdash;who might not
  be amongst them the agents of Pitt, of Coburg, of the
  <i>Gironde</i>?&mdash;what enemy at the gates of Paris? The journalists
  scribbled to inflame this Paris mob, which alone stood between the government
  of June and and the hatred of the world. Placards were everywhere exhorting
  the people to vengeance for their destroyed idol; Robespierre urged on
  Fouquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, who wrote to the police to furnish
  him with the <i>procès-verbal</i> of the affair, that "an example as severe
  as prompt" might be made of the author of the death of "the brave and
  generous Republican Marat." When the Convention met that morning, the
  President Saint-André announced at once: "Citizens! A great crime was
  committed yesterday on the person of a deputy. Marat is no more."</p>

  <p>To reassure themselves the <i>Montagnards</i> ordered the armed men of the
  48 sections of Paris to march past the <i>Tuileries</i>; it was to the sound
  of the tramping feet and the drums of the <i>sans-culottes</i> that the
  Terrorists mouthed over their vengeance and the honours due to Marat.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Panthéon!</i>" shrieked one Jacobin. Robespierre opposed this, and
  another yelled: "He'll get there, despite your jealousy!"</p>

  <p>Chabot read Guellard's <i>procès-verbal</i> and denounced Barbaroux and
  Deperret as accomplices of the assassin. Drouet, who had saved Mlle. de
  Corday from the people, sprang up and fanatically denounced her, demanding
  her instant punishment; Hanriot, whose cannon had driven the
  <i>Girondists</i> back into the <i>Tuileries</i> on June 2nd, screamed:
  "Vengeance for the death of the great man!"&mdash;and warned his colleagues
  "to be careful of green ribbons!" Then, weeping and demanding the
  <i>Panthéon</i> for Marat, he declared that Paris was riddled by a huge
  conspiracy. On Marat's door, draped with black crape, a placard, soon covered
  by the names of the faithful, exhorted the people in bad verse to:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Arrête, Citoyen,<br>
  Et vois ton défenseur!<br>
  Il fut ton soutien<br>
  Et to voua son coeur!"</p>

  <p>Hébert, in the pages of <i>Père Duchêne</i>, excelled himself in
  invective; this "<i>garce de Calvados</i>" was sent by Bishop
  Fauchet&mdash;"a fury armed by the priests," and <i>Père Duchêne</i> urged
  his "<i>braves sans-culottes</i>" to demand "a more terrible, a more infamous
  punishment than the guillotine for the murderess." Guirault, the orator,
  extolling in the name of Paris the dead patriot, demanded the most frightful
  tortures for the woman of Calvados; Chabot, who had coveted her, avenged
  himself for his thwarted lust by demanding her instant sacrifice; he inflamed
  his hearers by describing the force and skill of the blow&mdash;"she had been
  well instructed."</p>

  <p>The lame, tormented Georges Couthon, the panther, most savage of the
  <i>Montagnards</i>, accused Deperret of complicity in the murder and declared
  that there was no question but that "this monster in female form" had been
  sent on her bloody errand by Buzot, Barbaroux and Salles and all the other
  conspirators who had taken refuge at Caen.</p>

  <p>These furious denunciations proved the fear and anxiety of the
  <i>Montagnards</i>; they used every means in their power to rouse the fury of
  the people who, half-starved, excited, wholly misled, partly crazed by
  licence and bloodshed, paraded the streets with songs, drums, flags and
  yells.</p>

  <p>Robespierre, always sly and shrewd, strove to profit by the death of his
  rival; with Danton he concocted the tale of a vast plot engineered by the
  <i>Gironde</i> against the government; Camille Desmoulins took the congenial
  work in hand; false witnesses appeared with strange stories; a woman had
  heard two men whispering of the assassination in the street; Chabot found
  public-house keepers, wine-sellers who had seen a carriage with three men and
  two women, one Fauchet, one Mlle. de Corday, descending mysteriously at an
  inn demanding secrecy; Fouquier-Tinville received letters denouncing plots in
  all parts of the country, in particular one from the Mayor of Strasbourg, who
  had impounded, he said, a violent diatribe against "those scoundrels the
  <i>Montagnards</i>, the <i>Jacobins</i>, the members of the
  <i>Commune</i>."</p>

  <p>All this in the course of a few hours&mdash;during the sweltering heat of
  the July day. The gutter press rushed to the attack with their usual weapons
  of mudslinging; the murderess was a coarse virago, blackbrowed, hideous,
  debauched, with the mask of a vixen, with an eruption in her face; hasty
  caricatures of her were scrawled and published, cheap prints showing a fish
  wife with gross features&mdash;"<i>une femme brune, noire, grosse et
  froide"&mdash;"malpropre, sans grâce...la figure dure insolente,
  erysipélateuse et sanguine</i>."</p>

  <p>In proportion to the outrages heaped upon the murderess were the praises
  showered on Marat; he was no less than a demi-god; a sculptor, the deaf and
  dumb Deseine, took that morning of July 14th a death mask of the contorted
  features of Marat, which were also modelled by Bonvallet; Guirault, rising in
  the Assembly, reminded one Jacques-Louis David, member for Paris, that he had
  painted the death of Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau and that here was another
  subject for his brush.</p>

  <p>"I will paint it!" cried the creator of the Graeco-Roman revival, and
  rushed off to collect his models.</p>

  <p>Laurent Bas, the street porter, was brought before the Assembly and
  thanked for knocking down and securing the virago; the police were commended,
  the Clubs of the <i>Cordeliers</i> and the <i>Jacobins</i> disputed the heart
  of Marat; a deputy again demanded that his ashes should take the place of
  those of Mirabeau in the <i>Panthéon</i>; Robespierre asked the Jacobins to
  buy Marat's press; his funeral was to be at the expense of the nation: this,
  owing to the state of the body, had to take place immediately, and in
  consequence the trial of the murderess was postponed.</p>

  <p>Deschamps worked hard at his loathsome task. The Assembly desired that
  Marat's corpse should be preserved as far as possible in order that they
  might show it to the people; it was intended to make a festival, an orgy of
  this funeral of the friend of the people; David, as showman-in-chief to the
  <i>Mountain</i>, was consulted on this 14th day of July as to what was to be
  done with the body, which was to be displayed in the <i>ci-devant</i> church
  of the <i>Cordeliers</i>&mdash;since only parts of it could be exposed;
  Deschamps declared, "<i>Car vous savez qu'il avait une lèpre et que son sang
  était brûlé</i>."</p>

  <p>David thought that it would be "interesting" to show the patriot in the
  position in which he had met his death, seated in his bath and writing "for
  the happiness of the people."</p>

  <p>At midday, July 14th, Deschamps, in an atmosphere heavy with the fumes of
  the aromatics, proceeded to the embalmment; he was assisted by five pupils,
  and he put down his expenses, from the Sunday to the Tuesday (July
  14th-16th), as 6,000 <i>livres</i>&mdash;for all the liquids, aromatics,
  linen employed, and for general out-of-pocket payments; in the garden of the
  <i>ci-devant Cordeliers</i>, Deschamps embalmed the heart of Marat, encased
  it in lead, and placed, in two separate vases, the entrails and the lungs;
  the <i>ci-devant</i> church was draped with the tricolour, with mourning
  scarves of crape, and "<i>le lit triomphal</i>" was prepared.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Commune</i> Hébert pronounced the funeral eulogy of Marat, and
  everywhere, before the town hall, the <i>Tuileries</i>, the Clubs, the
  prisons, the house of Marat, the sweating crowd pressed, cursed, shouted,
  wept; it seemed as if Charlotte de Corday had achieved her end and had indeed
  cast terror and dismay into the midst of the tyrants.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux, breaking from the prudence of his friends, ran the streets for
  news; his pamphlet had, in this hideous frenzy, dropped forgotten from the
  press, but he cared nothing for that, he was on fire with a renewed
  enthusiasm&mdash;who was she, this heroine, was not she also a disciple of
  Rousseau, a reader of Plutarch?</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In the cell of the <i>abbaye</i> the prisoner sat in tranquil meditation;
  she knew nothing of the desperate frenzy that her act had roused; she was
  satisfied that she had done her task and that it would not prove in vain; she
  found the fury of the deceived, ignorant people very natural; while she
  pitied them, she still believed that the death of Marat would be the signal
  for the downfall of anarchy, the salvation of France.</p>

  <p>During that hot Sunday she sat mending the torn white gown; the jailor's
  wife had lent her a needle and thread, her own had been taken from her; she
  had slept, she had been allowed to wash, to repair her dress, the people
  about her were kind; she was almost happy.</p>

  <p>The <i>abbaye</i> was a prison constructed on the monastery of
  <i>Saint-Germain-des-Prés</i> nearly a hundred and fifty years before; Mlle.
  de Corday was given the cell lately occupied by Brissot, the leader of the
  <i>Girondists</i>; it was so small that there was only room for a bed, a
  table, a chair; the walls were filthy, the window heavily grilled, and the
  air was tainted by the odours from a ditch outside which the animals kept in
  the prison constantly fouled; it was, however, considered decent in
  comparison with some of the other cells and usually given to some
  distinguished prisoner.</p>

  <p>On her arrival at the <i>abbaye</i> she had been again examined and faced
  with various witnesses of no importance, such as the people from the <i>hôtel
  de la Providence</i> and her fellow-travellers from Evreux; she was
  distressed that her visit to Deperret had been discovered; if she had
  mentioned his name in the diligence it had been casually; it was natural that
  she, coming from Caen, should speak of Barbaroux; the address of Deperret had
  been on a piece of paper with two other addresses of friends, she thought she
  had destroyed it; for the rest she was resolute to inculpate no one.</p>

  <p>At last she had been allowed to sleep, to wake naturally, to give some
  care to her person; there were two guards at her door continually spying on
  her; of one of them she asked "if the sky was clear?"</p>

  <p>"I do not see a cloud anywhere," he replied.</p>

  <p>"So," said Charlotte de Corday. "It is so with me. I feel most pleasantly
  at peace."</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing to soften her torment, no friend to comfort, to
  console, to strengthen her, she did not know her fate, when or where she was
  to die; she had no news of the Norman expedition that she hoped was marching
  on Paris, she had no means of knowing how her deed was regarded by those
  whose opinion she valued; but now, as always, she was self-sufficient,
  detached from the world, from her surroundings. The couple Delavaquerie who
  guarded her, the police at her door, all who saw her were overawed, almost
  uneasy; they had never seen such a creature before; there was something
  terrible in her innocence, in her beauty, in her gentleness, she seemed a
  saint, an angel.</p>

  <p>The woman Delavaquerie gave her, on her request, some cambric and she made
  herself a bonnet and a plain fichu; her hat had been left behind in Marat's
  <i>salon</i>, gentlewomen did not appear in public bareheaded, her
  rose-coloured fichu was soiled, torn and too <i>coquette</i>; she sewed
  tranquilly, awaiting her fate.</p>

  <p>While she mended her dress she thought of Corneille who had patched his
  own shoes, and a smile touched her lips; at midday she took a little food,
  afterwards she was allowed writing materials in the hope that she would
  compromise some accomplices.</p>

  <p>She used them to request two favours&mdash;first, she begged that she
  might be alone, at least at night, the police were constantly in her cell;
  she had already protested against this; she desired that, as a remembrance
  for her friends, her family, her portrait might be taken; with her ironic
  humour she wrote: "<i>As good citizens are commemorated by their portraits,
  so those of great criminals serve to evoke horror for their crimes, so deign,
  if you please, to pay attention to my request."</i> She concluded on a tone
  of entreaty&mdash;<i>"Je vous prie de m'envoyer demain un peintre en
  miniature, je vous renouvelle celle de me laisser dormir seule, croyez, je
  vous prie, à ma reconnaissance" [sic]</i>.</p>

  <p>This letter was sent to the Committee of Public Safety and was dealt with
  by Chabot; both of the requests were refused, while the <i>Montagnards</i>
  carefully circulated their libellous caricatures of the prisoner.</p>

  <p>Any news that might distress her she was given; in the afternoon she
  learned of the arrest of Deperret and Fauchet; the first troubled her
  profoundly&mdash;ah, if he had only taken her advice and fled! A brave, able
  man, pleasant and gay, with his young daughters, his laughing companions, his
  courtesy...As for Fauchet, she despised him; she had only seen him twice,
  each time from a window; the first occasion had been when, robed in
  rose-coloured silk, she had restrained her brother and M. de Tournélis from
  rushing out to rebuke the insults of the mob who clamoured round Fauchet's
  departure from Caen.</p>

  <p>She wrote down these facts and added: "<i>Fauchet is the last man in the
  world to whom I would have confided my project, if this declaration can serve
  him I declare the truth of it. Corday.</i>"</p>

  <p>The next day, Monday, the 15th, she was informed by her keepers that the
  funeral of Marat would delay her trial; she had, then, still some hours of
  respite. She would, towards evening, she said, write another letter; a candle
  was brought in and she spread out her paper on the dirty table, dating it
  "Second day of the preparation of peace, from the chamber of Bissot."</p>

  <p>It was to Charles Barbaroux she wrote; she had promised him news of her
  "enterprise"; she had made use of him, she owed it, perhaps, to him to
  explain her conduct; it pleased her, too, to think of the young deputy with
  his "Roman look," his noble presence, his impetuous enthusiasm for the cause
  that was her cause, too; writing to this man she seemed to be talking to a
  friend.</p>

  <p>She wrote, easily and with humour, of the incidents of her journey, she
  made an amusing story of the stupid gallant who had tormented her with his
  attentions, gaily she put in the little details&mdash;so grotesque under the
  circumstances&mdash;of this impromptu wooing.</p>

  <p>Then she explained her conduct, using a crystal-clear candour, a superb
  pride. <i>"They are very discontented here to have nothing but a woman
  without importance</i> (une femme sans conséquence) <i>to offer to the manes
  of the great man. Pardon! O human beings! this word dishonours your species!
  This was a ferocious beast who meant to see France devoured by civil
  war!"</i></p>

  <p>She expressed her serene confidence that, the "monster" destroyed, peace
  would return, and she added: <i>"Heaven be thanked, he was not a
  Frenchman."</i></p>

  <p>Then, with a return of ironic humour, her Norman shrewdness, she described
  the scene in Marat's house; <i>"I expected to be killed instantly; some brave
  men, beyond praise, saved my life"</i>; she noted the vanity of Legendre, the
  malice of Chabot&mdash;<i>"who appeared to me a fool."</i> She sighed out on
  the paper&mdash;<i>"Je jouis délicieusement de la paix depuis deux fours, le
  bonheur de mon pays est le mien."</i></p>

  <p>Then the main purpose of the letter appeared&mdash;she recommended her
  father, her friends the "<i>chers amis aristocrates</i>" to
  Barbaroux&mdash;if he was to chance to see any letter she had written to her
  father that contained <i>"quelques plaisanteries sur votre compte"</i> he was
  to take no notice&mdash;<i>"Je suivais la légèreté de mon caractère."</i></p>

  <p>As the coarse candle burnt down, as the fetid odours coming in from the
  fouled yard increased with the heat of the night, Charlotte de Corday's pen
  ran on; she fell, after her gaiety, her humour, into that strain which was
  natural to her, one of melancholy and grandeur: <i>"I have never hated but
  one being and I have shown with what violence, but there are a thousand I
  love more than I hated him. A lively imagination, a sensitive heart, promised
  me a stormy life; let those who regret me consider this and let them rejoice
  to think of me in the Elysian Fields with some other friends. For the
  moderns&mdash;there are few true patriots who know how to die for their
  country; nearly all is egotism. What miserable people to found a Republic! At
  least, whatever government we have it will not be the Mountain...</i></p>

  <p><i>"I am very well in my prison, the gaolers are the best possible
  people&mdash;"</i></p>

  <p>She related the refusal of Chabot to remove her guards at
  night&mdash;<i>"only a Capuchin would have such ideas...I employ my time
  writing songs in which I promise the Parisians that we will arm against
  nothing but the anarchy. It is exactly true."</i></p>

  <p>The candle had burnt down; she folded up the unfinished letter and lay
  down on her rude bed, not knowing that Barbaroux and his friends were
  homeless wanderers in full flight from Caen.</p>

  <p>Monday, July 15th, 1793, was over; throughout the hot night, here and
  there, wandered Adam Lux, trying to piece together the story of the woman
  from Calvados.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>July 16th, the embalmment of Marat, the preparations for his funeral
  proceeded; the unfaltering heat smote down on Paris; the family of Marat,
  represented by the brother and two sisters, Jean-Pierre, Albertine and Marie,
  clamoured for revenge, appealing to the Assembly for "an exemplary
  punishment" for the "traitor who has been arrested" and a vigorous search for
  her accomplices; Chabot was assisting Fouquier-Tinville to get together his
  accusation; as the murder was that of a deputy, all that was necessary was
  the Revolutionary Tribunal, which would act as Judge and Jury; while the
  first formalities were being arranged Charlotte de Corday was moved secretly
  to the <i>Conciergerie</i>, where she was placed in a cell beyond the great
  hall where a barrier divided those condemned to death from the employés of
  the prison.</p>

  <p>Here there was nothing save a solid bench clamped to the wall; the light
  falling from the thick-set windows was dulled by the dark grey of the walls;
  on even this brilliant day a dismal twilight filled the high gloomy chamber
  sheltering those doomed to die.</p>

  <p>While she waited in her cell beyond, in her mended white dress, seated in
  the shadows, the funeral of Marat took place in the blazing sunshine
  outside.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Dr. Deschamps had found it extremely difficult to fulfil the wishes of
  David and to make a presentable display with Marat's remains; nor was his
  zeal increased by the instant refusal of the Assembly to pay him the 6,000
  <i>livres</i> he had demanded; his account was reduced at once to 1,500
  <i>livres</i>, after all the ingredients he had bought had been
  priced&mdash;"the honour of having helped to preserve the remains of so great
  a man should be sufficient payment for a Republican," observed one
  deputy.</p>

  <p>The face and bosom of Marat had not been embalmed, they were turning, as
  Deschamps regretted, "a little black" by the Tuesday morning, but the odour
  was being overcome by aromatics, and it was hoped that the corpse would last
  out the festival.</p>

  <p>It was placed in a lead coffin which was enclosed in a superb sarcophagus
  of purple porphyry taken from the collection of antiquities at the Louvre; a
  huge tricolour drapery, soaked in spirits, was swathed round the body in
  imitation of the old dressing-gown Marat had worn at the time of his death;
  it was hoped, by renewing this moisture from time to time, to arrest the
  decay of the body, already, as David remarked, "far advanced."</p>

  <p>A right arm, the hand closed round a pen, hung over the edge of the bath;
  the filthy black hair was crowned by laurels; but the whole effect was more
  ghastly than imposing; it had been found impossible to shut either the eyes
  or the mouth of Marat, the expression of the last agony was clear on the
  putrefying features and it had been necessary to cut out the lolling
  tongue.</p>

  <p>This repulsive idol was raised on a platform in the <i>ci-devant</i>
  church of the <i>Cordeliers</i>; it was then carried through Paris with all
  the pomp that such mourners and such times could provide. At five o'clock
  this grotesque procession started, the chariot on which Marat was taking his
  last ride being drawn by twelve men, while young girls, robed in white and
  carrying boughs of cypress, walked beside it; <i>sans-culottes</i>,
  <i>Jacobins</i>, the knitting women who counted the heads that fell daily
  from the guillotine, followed howling with grief and for vengeance on
  Charlotte de Corday; behind again, the deputies, officials, the Clubs, the
  crape-veiled drums, the musicians playing their funeral marches, Hanriot with
  the cannon that had quelled the <i>Gironde</i>, all the scum of Paris yelling
  revolutionary hymns; every five minutes there was a discharge of artillery
  from the Pont-Neuf; David, who was in charge of these ceremonies, had striven
  to give a classic air to this rag-tag of modernity which only resulted in a
  tawdry, sinister and bizarre magnificence, no doubt pleasing to the painter
  of <i>The Horatii</i>, the apostle of bad taste.</p>

  <p>As the dark fell torches were lit; at midnight the <i>cortège</i> returned
  to the garden of the <i>Cordeliers</i> where the grave had been prepared;
  blocks of granite under hastily planted trees; the section of Marseilles had
  claimed the honour of this burial in ground belonging to them; the writings
  of Marat were placed in the grave, then the coffin, in which the body had
  been sealed, was lowered.</p>

  <p>One citizen, in rushing to kiss the hand grasping the pen, spoiled one of
  David's stage effects; the arm came off, it did not belong to Marat.</p>

  <p>With cries of vengeance, with patriotic songs, with fervent speches, the
  ceremonies were prolonged until two o'clock in the morning; twenty orators
  praised Marat, the ex-lackey Brochet offered up a prayer: "O heart of Jesus!
  O heart of Marat! If Jesus was a prophet, Marat was a god!" There was no
  dissentient voice.</p>

  <p>On the granite pyramid that formed the tomb was an urn; on the front this
  inscription:</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><i>ICI REPOSE MARAT<br>
  l'ami du peuple assassiné par les<br>
  ennemis du peuple<br>
  Le 13 Juillet 1793</i></p>

  <p>The wretches awaiting death in the jails where Marat had sent them got
  news of these ceremonies and the state of the corpse and composed another
  inscription:</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><i>Ci-gît Marat le bienfaisant<br>
  Qui nous apporta l'anarchie en régnant<br>
  Et la peste en mourant</i></p>

  <p>One deputy wished Marat to be "embalmed again" and carried round the whole
  country; he was calmed by the promise of the later transference of Marat's
  remains to the <i>Panthéon</i>.</p>

  <p>The ceremonies expanded into an orgy that embraced all Paris; there were
  dinners, dancing, <i>rites mystiques</i>, love-feasts, speeches in the
  desecrated churches, an hysteric saturnalia in the great heat, by the
  torch-light, to the sound of drums, cannons, yells and songs.</p>

  <p>Half-maddened by these incredible scenes, unable to sleep or to eat, Adam
  Lux, his shirt unbuttoned, his hair flying, tormented by rage and horror,
  fled from place to place like a pure spirit suddenly cast into a circle of
  the damned.</p>

  <p>Giraud, architect to the department of Paris, in his office, added up the
  accounts; the bankrupt nation had to pay highly for the apotheosis of Marat,
  from 2,400 <i>livres</i> to Martin who had designed the tomb, to 16
  <i>livres</i> for lemonade and 34 <i>livres</i> for vinegar, 35 <i>livres</i>
  for satin tunic, to nearly 2,000 <i>livres</i> for flambeaux and lamps; the
  total was 5,608 <i>livres</i>, 2 <i>sous</i>, 8 <i>deniers</i>.</p>

  <p>In the sombre shade of the <i>Conciergerie</i>, Mlle. de Corday, in her
  small <i>cachot</i>, finished her letter to Barbaroux.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>At eleven o'clock that morning she had been taken to the <i>Palais de
  Justice</i> for the preliminaries of her trial; the witnesses had been
  examined, Marat's women, Laurent Bas, the <i>hôtel</i>-keeper, the waiter,
  the hairdresser; all was simple; she had slain Maratalone, without accomplice
  or encouragement&mdash;she wished to rid France of a ferocious dictator. She
  wrote her testament that she might be known for what she was. She was told to
  choose a lawyer to defend her, and she named the deputy of Calvados whom she
  knew to be in Paris, the Comte Doulcet de Pontécoulant, whom she had known so
  well in Caen.</p>

  <p>Her unfinished letter to Barbaroux had been seized, she asked for its
  return, it was promised, and if she finished it, it should be sent.</p>

  <p>This was a trap, but Mlle. de Corday accepted it as a courtesy.</p>

  <p>Two <i>agents de police</i> were with her in the <i>cachot</i> as she
  wrote rapidly, in her bold handwriting, by the light of the tallow candle
  given her by the couple Richard who kept the women's quarters of the
  jail.</p>

  <p>Everything was nearly over now; her trial was fixed for eight o'clock the
  next morning; the result could not be in doubt; she would not see another
  night.</p>

  <p>As if she spoke to a friend she related the events of the day to
  Barbaroux, evoking, in these hideous surroundings, his brilliancy, his
  courtesy, his enthusiasm.</p>

  <p><i>"I do not think Doulcet will refuse the honour of defending me...all I
  may possess I leave to the women and children of Calvados...I was amazed at
  the moderation of the crowd&mdash;they allowed me to be brought here without
  molesting me...pray do not forget Mlle. de Forbin...to-morrow at eight
  o'clock I am to be judged, probably at midday I shall have lived, to use the
  language of the Romans...there will be some value put on the people of
  Calvados when it is shown that even the women are capable of firmness...no
  one knows how the last moments pass and it is the end that crowns the work. I
  have no need to affect insensibility on my fate, for until this instant I
  have not felt the least fear of death...Fauchet is said to have taken me to
  the Convention to a tribune&mdash;as a deputy he should not have been on the
  tribunes, as a bishop not with a woman...Deperret has nothing to reproach
  himself with...I think Marat will not go to the Panthéon...I hope I have
  helped Wimp f en to gain more than one battle. Farewell, citizen, I recommend
  myself to the true friends of peace. The prisoners here, far from cursing me
  like the people in the street, seem to pity me, unhappiness always brings
  compassion; this is my last reflection.&mdash;Corday. Tuesday, 16th, at 8
  o'clock of the evening."</i></p>

  <p>One other letter to write when this is signed, a letter addressed to M.
  Corday, <i>rue du Bègle</i>, at Argentan, written slowly, firmly, while the
  cannon for Marat sound in the hot night without.</p>

  <p><i>"Pardon me, my dear papa, for having disposed of my existence without
  your permission. I have avenged many innocent victims, I have prevented many
  other disasters. The people one day, being disabused, will rejoice that they
  were delivered of a tyrant. I tried to persuade you that I was going to
  England, for I wished to preserve my incognita, but I found this impossible.
  I hope that you will not be tormented, but in any case I believe that you
  will find defenders at Caen.<br>
  <br>
  "I have taken as advocate</i> (défenseur) <i>Gustave Doulcet. Such a deed
  permits of no defence, it is only a formality. Farewell, dear papa, I beg you
  to forget me, or rather to rejoice at my fate, the cause is so beautiful. I
  embrace my sister whom I love with all my heart, also all my relations.<br>
  <br>
  "Do not forget the verse of Corneille:<br>
  <br>
  "'The crime and not the scoffold brings the disgrace.'<br>
  <br>
  "It is to-morrow at 8 o'clock that I am to be judged. This 16th July.<br>
  <br>
  "Corday."</i></p>

  <p>A line to be added to the letter to Barbaroux.</p>

  <p><i>"I have written a word to papa, I say nothing to my other friends; I
  ask of them nothing but a prompt forgetfulness&mdash;their affliction would
  dishonour my memory."</i></p>

  <p>But elsewhere in her letter she had written: <i>"Break the news of my
  death gently to Bougan-Langrais."</i></p>

  <p>The prison was noisy, echoing with the excitement of Marat's funeral; the
  cannonading was incessant, but when Mlle. de Corday had finished her two
  letters she lay down peacefully for her last sleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The tribunal before which Mlle. de Corday appeared was presided over by
  Montané, a former magistrate; he had two fellow-Judges, Foucault and
  Roussillon; the Jury consisted of fourteen men, none of whom was of any
  distinction; the citizens, Fallot, Lacrampe, Fualdès, Le Roi, Gannay, Sion,
  Guillier, Derbez, Paget, Brochet, Thoumien, Brichet, Godin and Chrétien, and
  Duplain.</p>

  <p>This <i>tribunal révolutionnaire</i> had been established, largely by
  Marat's advice and assistance, to deal with political crimes&mdash;i.e., with
  offences against the government; it was therefore, under the guise of a
  strict legality, a useful instrument of tyranny, as effective as the old
  <i>lettre de cachet</i> of the Kings, since it had absolute power of life or
  death, and since Judges and Jury were always in the government interest. This
  tribunal worked with the swiftness of a drum-head court martial; its death
  sentences were carried out the same day as pronounced and so little chance of
  life had anyone brought before this tribunal that it seemed as if it had been
  instituted merely to provide a spectacle for the people that should whet
  their appetite for the even more terrible drama of the executions.</p>

  <p>This tribunal was under the authority of the Committee of Public Safety,
  of which it was the instrument; both were supposed to represent the
  sovereignty of the people and did, in truth, satisfy the debauched,
  half-crazy blood lust of the Paris mob. But it did not, in truth, in any way
  represent the people of France, but only the section of terrorists who had
  usurped the government.</p>

  <p>The sittings of this tribunal were held in the <i>Palais de Justice
  (Conciergerie)</i> in the old <i>Cour de Cassation</i>&mdash;renamed <i>Salle
  Egalité</i>.</p>

  <p>This chamber was divided by a barrier, half for the public, half for the
  tribunal, which occupied a semicircle of raised seats, the Jury, protected by
  police and ushers in front, the Judges behind, the President seated above
  all, with his table in front of him, and his clerks at the side; to the right
  of this estrade was the Public Prosecutor's place, to the left that of the
  prisoner; the rest of the chamber, the <i>salle des pas perdus</i>, the
  staircase were occupied by a vast, seething crowd, animated by curiosity,
  cruelty, sentimentality and the hysteria bred of anarchy.</p>

  <p>The prisoner, escorted by guards, entered the Court through a door in the
  wall which led to a back staircase from which she had been brought directly
  from her prison; she was taken to her place, which was furnished with a
  chair, and surrounded by armed men; she faced the tribunal.</p>

  <p>It was an imposing array that met the calm gaze of Mlle. de Corday; the
  magistrates wore a costume calculated to overawe, black habits, black mantles
  draped like togas, huge hats turned up from their faces, bound with ribbons
  and rendered more monstrous by high double cockades, one black, one
  tricolour, white cravats, and, on the bosom, a medal suspended from a
  tricolour ribbon, bearing the head of Liberty in the Phrygian bonnet, and the
  emblem of the Roman fasces. The symbols of those antique ages so adored by
  Charlotte de Corday had been adopted by the tyrants whom she abhorred; the
  mania for classicism had spread from the intellectuals to the gutter; Louis
  XVI, to placate the sentiment of the moment, had ordered a <i>Brutus</i> from
  David, and now the <i>sans-culottes</i> who had never heard of Greece twisted
  their red cotton night-caps into a semblance of a head-gear worn in Asia
  Minor three thousand years before, and the bundle of fasces was admired as an
  emblem of democracy by hordes who knew nothing of the haughty rulers before
  whom they had been once borne.</p>

  <p>A deep sound, half hiss, half sigh, rose from the packed crowd jostling in
  the <i>Salle Egalité</i>; the prisoner was placed as if in a pillory, so that
  everyone could see her, and as her white-clad figure appeared, the only woman
  amongst so many men, all the emotions of the people were blended into an
  intense curiosity, everything was subordinated to the greedy desire not to
  lose an instant of this extraordinary drama; even the hostility of the crowd
  sank, they stared, hushed. The heat was almost insupportable, the air stale
  and soon tainted; even at eight o'clock the thermometer showed 30°
  <i>Réaumur</i>.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday remained standing while the Jury were sworn in; she wore
  the white muslin dress that she had selected to please Marat and that she had
  so carefully mended and adjusted, the plain kerchief and cap that she had
  made herself in the prison of the <i>abbaye</i>; there was nothing theatrical
  about her appearance, she had not sought in any way to appear dramatic,
  romantic, touching, a heroine; her majesty, her dignity came from her
  complete sincerity, her unshaken fortitude, what appeared her disdain of men
  came from her complete detachment from the world.</p>

  <p>She was keenly observed, and not only by the eyes of Judges, Jury and the
  curious public; among the press were the terrible spies of the Committee of
  Public Safety, the <i>observateurs</i> who were employed to report on the
  behaviour of everyone, from the President to the prisoner, and to denounce
  anyone suspected of disloyalty to the government.</p>

  <p>One of these trained and indifferent spectators noted and reported "the
  calm and majesty" of the prisoner, her complete lack of remorse, the
  extraordinary effect of her beauty and her courage on this crowd which had
  come to insult her; there was even a movement of sympathy, of admiration, she
  seemed to hold them all in subjection, <i>comme sous pression</i>; only the
  most brutal, used to horrors, hardened by vice, hissed and muttered, half
  mechanically.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The Jury sworn in, the prisoner is allowed to seat herself, her identity
  is established and this formality over, Montané asks her if she has an
  advocate?</p>

  <p>"I chose a friend; apparently he has not had the courage to accept my
  defence."</p>

  <p>President Montané looks round and perceives close to the barriers, among
  the crowd, Claude-François Chauveau-Lagarde, a jurisconsult and magistrate,
  and orders this lawyer to undertake the defence of the prisoner, appointing
  one Grenier to act as his clerk.</p>

  <p>The two men make their way to the dock and seat themselves near Mlle. de
  Corday, who looks at them troubled, mistrustful&mdash;how shall these two of
  her enemies know the defence she would make?</p>

  <p>But Chauveau-Lagarde seems a gentleman, and his air is not without
  distinction, he is about thirty-five, carefully dressed in the gloomy
  impressive republican style; she is a little reassured when the President
  calls her to order; she is to pay attention to the witnesses; she does so
  courteously, though it is all such a senseless formality; have not these
  petty people already made their little clamour? Coachman,
  <i>hôtel</i>-keeper, street porter&mdash;all here again with their tongues
  eager against her; her indifference is broken when Simonne Evrard appears; in
  her letter to Barbaroux she had written: <i>"I was moved by the cries of
  those whom I had made unhappy, but he who serves his country cannot count the
  price"</i>; and now, again, she is moved by the animal grief of this faithful
  woman, and tries to spare her the recital which she breaks with sobs and
  tears; what need for all this? Charlotte de Corday has done it and she is
  willing to pay that price which cannot be counted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was I who killed Marat. I wished to slay him on the summit of the
  <i>Mountain</i>&mdash;I should have preferred this to any other way&mdash;I
  was so sure, in that case, that I should have been instantly the victim of
  the fury of the people. I was supposed to be in London, my name would have
  been unknown."</p>

  <p>Montané reproaches her with the two letters she wrote to Marat, the lies
  she used to gain admittance to his house.</p>

  <p>"I am aware that the means I used were not worthy of me, but they were
  good enough to save the country. Besides, if I had not appeared to esteem him
  I should never have been admitted to his presence; such a man is always
  suspicious."</p>

  <p>She is urged to confess her accomplices&mdash;did not the
  <i>Girondists</i> at Caen inspire her with their fury against Marat?</p>

  <p>"I had no need of the hatred of others. I had sufficient of my own."</p>

  <p>She is questioned about her political opinions&mdash;where did she find
  the courage for this crime?</p>

  <p>"I was a republican before the revolution and I have never lacked
  energy."</p>

  <p>Lauze Deperret and Fauchet are mentioned as her accomplices; to save the
  first she disputes, inch by inch, with Norman shrewdness and tenacity,
  striving to prove that Marat had not even been mentioned between them,
  proving it, indeed, were there justice to listen to her, so obvious are her
  candour, her integrity; Deperret, under arrest, is brought in as witness; his
  story confirms hers, and soon, for lack of evidence, he is released, but he
  is doomed; she can do no more for him&mdash;as for Fauchet, "I despise him,"
  she says quietly.</p>

  <p>In her anxiety to help Deperret she leans forward to address the
  President; her voice is so soft, so touching in its candour, her face is so
  lovely in its entire unconsciousness, she seems so young, almost a child in
  her virginal dignity, her motive is so noble, "to rid the world of a monster,
  to give peace to her wretched country," that everyone there is troubled,
  faintly bewildered.</p>

  <p>How can this tribunal pronounce on such a deed, such a prisoner?</p>

  <p>Claude-François Chauveau-Lagarde is, above all, troubled; her defence has
  been entrusted to him, she has aroused his chivalry, disturbed his
  conscience, and he can do nothing for her; he is seated so near to her that
  he feels the perfume of this terrible purity, sees in every detail this
  beauty no one can disregard; he has taken the place of a friend who has
  failed her&mdash;he has seen her look at him coldly, with distrust;
  Chauveau-Lagarde puts his hand before his eyes as if they ached from the
  acrid sour air, the cruel heat; she is so fragile in her delicate femininity,
  so strong in her unshakable fortitude; her advocate does not care to look
  either at her or at the Public Prosecutor, that man of blood, Antoine-Quentin
  Fouquier-Tinville, farmer's son, ex-police clerk, with his thin-lipped, flat,
  vicious face, ruined by debauchery, with his bantering jests, his black-clad
  figure.</p>

  <p>Chauveau-Lagarde, silent, watchful, notes the three questions that
  distress his client, three only that shake her composure.</p>

  <p>"How many children have you?"</p>

  <p>She blushes deeply as she answers Fouquier-Tinville's brutal question:</p>

  <p>"You know I have never been married."</p>

  <p>Even in that company there is no laughter.</p>

  <p>Her two letters are mentioned; that to Barbaroux has been seized and
  published; that to her father has been read; with emotion she begs that it
  may be sent to M. de Corday.</p>

  <p>"Is this the knife?"</p>

  <p>It is shown to her stained with blood, the knife she had bought for 40
  <i>sols</i> in the early morning in the <i>ci-devant Palais Royal</i>.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Yes! I recognise it! I recognise it!" She turns aside with
  disgust.</p>

  <p>Fouquier-Tinville details the blow; the skill of it, given by a practised
  hand...</p>

  <p>"Ah," cries the prisoner, "does this wretch take me for a murderess?"</p>

  <p>The uneasiness of Chauveau-Lagarde increases; she is being baited,
  insulted; they are trying to disturb all she has, her tranquillity, her
  belief in the righteousness of her deed, to undermine her courage; and they
  all know she is doomed, but they must have some sport out of her first; she
  has been more merciful; with Marat death was <i>foudroyante</i>; "they say he
  spoke after I struck," she wrote to Barbaroux. "I do not think so."</p>

  <p>They try to attack her through her faith&mdash;is not she <i>ci-devant</i>
  noble&mdash;at heart of the old faith which says: "Thou shalt do no
  murder?"</p>

  <p>"Did you confess to a frocked or an unfrocked priest?"</p>

  <p>"To neither. I have no confessor."</p>

  <p>At last, they can think of no more questions; Montané asks her if she has
  anything to say?</p>

  <p>"Only this&mdash;the chief of anarchy is no more&mdash;you have
  peace."</p>

  <p>There is a solemn pause in the court; the heat increases; the air is
  charged with electricity, a storm gathers slowly outside, where sulphurous
  clouds overspread the blazing sun that has shone so brilliantly since
  Charlotte de Corday left Caen.</p>

  <p>Claude-François Chauveau-Lagarde rises, a fair, elegant man profoundly
  distressed; while the Public Prosecutor was speaking he received two notes,
  one from the Jury bidding him say nothing, one from the President bidding him
  plead lunacy; he sees that they wish to humiliate her; but his one thought is
  to please this young woman whom he believes, having watched her and heard her
  speak, he understands; he cannot save her, but perhaps he can please her;
  there is a heavy confused noise, like an expression of stupor, then a silence
  that freezes Chauveau-Lagarde to the heart. He looks at Charlotte de Corday,
  he sees in her face that "she will not be justified."</p>

  <p>She has avowed murder and the proofs are there; legally she is guilty, but
  not according to her conscience nor to that of her defender; her glance gives
  him an inspiration for his hopeless task; he speaks suddenly and briefly.</p>

  <p>"My client admits this murder; she premeditated it, in the very presence
  of death she shows no remorse, nothing but political conviction could have
  armed her hand and given her this calm, this sublime abnegation. I commend
  myself to the prudence of the Jury."</p>

  <p>He sits down and glances at the prisoner; there is an expression of
  satisfaction on her fair face; he has pleased her and he feels a curious
  exaltation.</p>

  <p>"Citizens of the Jury, is it proved that on the 13th July instant, between
  seven and eight in the evening, Jean-Paul Marat, deputy to the National
  Convention, was assassinated in his home, in his bath, by a blow from a
  knife, the said blow having instantly slain him?</p>

  <p>"Is the author of this assassination Marie-Anne Charlotte de Corday,
  <i>ci-devant</i> d'Armont, ex-noble, inhabitant of Caen?</p>

  <p>"Did she do it with premeditation and criminal intention?"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>At twelve o'clock the Jury retired to consider these questions; the last
  had been altered from the form given it by Fouquier-Tinville, who had
  prefixed "Anti-revolutionary" to the words "criminal intention."</p>

  <p>They were absent an hour and a half; there was an amazed feeling in the
  crowd that the impossible had been achieved, that there would be an attempt
  to save Charlotte de Corday. From all sides there had been murmurs of
  sympathy, Chauveau-Lagarde had been obviously moved, Montané had seemed
  troubled and now the Jury were so long absent; the crowd was
  <i>bouleversée</i>; the attitude of the prisoner, calm, noble, after four
  hours of this public exposure, filled them with a sense of panic, as if an
  angel or a goddess had come into their midst; she had seen one of the
  National Guard sketching her features and had courteously posed for him.</p>

  <p>The Jury returned&mdash;the verdict was "Guilty."</p>

  <p>"It is proved."</p>

  <p>They dared say nothing else; their position was farcical, since they were
  at the mercy of the mob outside; they appeared uneasy, cowed.</p>

  <p>President Montané, pale beneath his enormous hat and plumes, read the
  death sentence; the prisoner's superb tranquillity, that was so unforced, so
  free from vanity, affected him and all the members of the tribunal; only
  Fouquier-Tinville remained implacable, demanding blood.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday had one request to make; she asked to be taken to
  Chauveau-Lagarde, who had moved into the body of the hall; her guards took
  her to the young lawyer whose looks betrayed his emotion; Mlle. de Corday
  d'Armont, <i>noble dame</i>, of pure Norman blood, spoke as if she were in
  her own <i>salon</i>.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, I thank you warmly for the courage with which you have defended
  me in a manner worthy of yourself and of me. These gentlemen have confiscated
  all my property, but I can give you a greater proof of my gratitude&mdash;I
  ask you to pay for me what I owe in the prison and I count on your
  generosity."</p>

  <p>He accepted, too touched to say much; she left between her guards for her
  prison; the white-clad figure with the brilliant hair and the noble bearing
  disappeared through the little door in the wall; a sigh, like relief from an
  overwhelming emotion, broke from the crowd; outside the thunder began to
  roll.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The tribunal had risen, Charles Henri-Sanson, the executioner, awaited the
  orders of Fouquier-Tinville, who had drawn Montané into a closet to abuse him
  for suppressing the words "anti-revolutionary."</p>

  <p>Did he, then, wish to save the prisoner by offering her a loophole of
  escape? Why had he told Chauveau-Lagarde to plead lunacy?</p>

  <p>The President replied that he had wished to humiliate the prisoner; the
  argument continued for an hour; when Fouquier-Tinville left the
  <i>cabinet</i> he had decided on the arrest of Montané.</p>

  <p>Sanson was waiting for him; the Public Prosecutor gave him his authority
  for the execution of Charlotte de Corday&mdash;a printed form with the name
  and date filled in by hand; the execution was to take place at five o'clock
  the same day, July 17th, on the <i>place de la Révolution</i>; the necessary
  soldiery were to be at the <i>Conciergerie</i> at three o'clock.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday returned to her cell; with exquisite courtesy she excused
  herself for not having been able to share the <i>déjeuner</i> of the couple
  Richard. When she had left that morning she had said that she would return in
  time, as <i>ces messieurs</i> would be in a hurry.</p>

  <p>A priest, the <i>abbé</i> Lothringer, came to offer her "the consolations
  of religion"; he was an unfrocked priest who attended the prisoners.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Corday had no need of him; she had nothing to confess, she had no
  need of absolution; she dealt direct with the God who had inspired her; her
  pure mystic faith had little need of the Church that had sheltered a Fauchet,
  a Chabot; she had long had her vocation.</p>

  <p>Besides, she wished to be alone, refused to compromise, to involve
  anyone.</p>

  <p>"Thank those who sent you, I am grateful for their good-will, but I have
  no need of your ministrations."</p>

  <p>She took a little food, a little repose, she adjusted her toilette after
  these long hours of heat and fatigue.</p>

  <p>The man who had been sketching her portrait in court had received
  permission to visit her in her <i>cachot</i> and finish his work.</p>

  <p>She was very willing to allow him this favour; she thought still of a
  souvenir for her friends, her family.</p>

  <p>The painter was one Hauer, who had been a pupil of David, and then was a
  captain in the National Guard; his drawing had been done roughly on an odd
  piece of paper, with a poor pencil; as he improved it, the prisoner made
  suggestions and posed for him, gazing in front of her with a gentle
  expression, her beautiful arms and hands folded on her breast.</p>

  <p>As if she had been a well-bred lady at ease in her own <i>salon</i>
  entertaining a guest, she talked of ordinary affairs with Hauer; so sincere
  was she in her self-abnegation, so utterly without any affectation of
  grandeur or any self-display, that the couple Richard and the guards
  themselves felt the kind of panic that had swept over the tribunal, the crowd
  in the <i>Salle Egalité</i>, as if some superhuman creature were among
  them.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Sanson and the chief jailer Fabricus arrived at the lodging of the couple
  Richard; the woman was frightfully livid and trembling.</p>

  <p>"Are you ill?" demanded Sanson.</p>

  <p>"Wait, and perhaps your heart will fail, too," she replied.</p>

  <p>He entered the cell, accompanied by two ushers of the tribunal, Tirraz and
  Monet.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was seated, writing on a piece of paper on a book that rested
  on her knee; a guard stood near; Hauer was sketching her face.</p>

  <p>She looked, paled slightly, and exclaimed: "What! Already!"</p>

  <p>Then she finished her letter and, tranquil again, listened while Monet and
  Tirraz read her sentence.</p>

  <p>She had no comment to make; she folded her letter in eight and gave it to
  Monet; it was addressed to Doulcet de Pontécoulant and contained some words
  of cold rebuke.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"The citizen Doulcet de Pontécoulant is a coward to have
  refused to defend me, when the task was so easy&mdash;he who undertook this
  did it with all the dignity possible. I shall remember him with gratitude
  until my last moment.&mdash;Marie de Corday."</p><br>

  <p>With a sigh for this false friend she had a glow of pleasure in thinking
  of the stranger who had understood her so completely.</p>

  <p>There was no time for delays; it was already late; what must be done was
  explained to her; she set a chair in the middle of the cell and took off her
  bonnet; Sanson cut off the brilliant locks; when he had nearly finished she
  took the scissors from his hands, severed a ringlet herself and gave it to
  Hauer.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, I thank you for what you have done for me, I have nothing to
  offer you but this lock of hair; pray accept it in memory of a poor dying
  creature&mdash;and allow me to beg of you a copy of your portrait for my
  family."</p>

  <p>She also gave a curl to Sanson, and another to Richard for his wife, who
  was sick with emotion and unable to appear.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Marat will go to the <i>Panthéon?</i>" she asked; Richard
  was too overwhelmed to reply.</p>

  <p>The red gown worn by assassins was brought; refusing to accept help she
  passed it over her head herself; it was too large and hung low, having never
  been worn by a woman before; she folded her fichu over her breast.</p>

  <p>"Here is a death toilette made by hands a little rude, but it will lead to
  immortality," she smiled.</p>

  <p>Hauer, who thought her even more beautiful, more touching in this array,
  sketched her again as the executioner tied her hands and feet.</p>

  <p>She was ready; at half-past six the cart was in the courtyard; it
  contained a chair, a stool, some straw; Mlle. de Corday mounted it; she was
  the only person to die that evening; a mighty storm rolled over Paris; the
  rain poured down steadily, the lightning was incessant. The roll of the
  thunder obscured the yells of the crowd that greeted the cart as the gates of
  the <i>Palais de Justice</i> opened and Charlotte de Corday was seen,
  standing erect in her red robe, confronting the storm.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Adam Lux had been in a fever all that day, eating nothing but a little
  bread; he and his friend Forster had read the letter to Barbaroux finished in
  prison the previous evening.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux had been overwhelmed. In the papers hot from the Press, he read
  the proud replies of the prisoner before the tribunal that morning; he had
  not been able to bring himself to go to the trial, but, after an exhausting
  ebb and flow of feeling, he decided to see this extraordinary woman pass to
  her death.</p>

  <p>He had declared that never had there been anything like her
  letter&mdash;it went to his heart like a wound; she was a heroine; yes, in
  the midst of this furious, this incredible anarchy, a heroine had
  appeared.</p>

  <p>He had wished to be a Marcus Curtius, and here was an Iphigenia, an
  Antigone; he heard she was young, fair, not like the libels spread about the
  city; he broke from Forster and plunged into the storm, the press, the chaos
  of traffic, soldiers, police, mob, to see her pass. Forster accompanied him,
  and the two deputies from Mayence forced their way to the rue
  <i>Saint-Honoré</i>.</p>

  <p>The violence of the storm heightened the frenzy of the people, many of
  whom were still drunk from their night-long orgies in celebration of Marat's
  funeral and who were urged on by the four hundred women who had been the
  furies of the September massacres; dazzled by the lightning, soaked by the
  rain, exhausted by the intense heat and their debaucheries, deafened by the
  thunder the mob surged, yelled and fought with the soldiers that Pache, Mayor
  of Paris, had sent to prevent the assassin of Marat from being murdered in
  the streets.</p>

  <p>Jostled by these foul hordes, evading pikes, flags, drums, the two
  Germans, driven onward by the frantic enthusiasm of Lux, arrived at the edge
  of the press, close to the way the soldiers kept for the death-cart.</p>

  <p>It came into view, veiled by the sheets of rain, proceeding slowly, the
  frightened horse rearing and jibbing, soldiers before and behind. Sanson on
  his chair, the prisoner standing.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux saw nothing but this figure; his emotion transported him out of
  himself, it seemed to him as if he stood beside her in the cart.</p>

  <p>Her bearing was not only brave, but noble and gentle. The thin red robe,
  soaked through, clung closely, showing her virginal shape, like that of a
  classic statue; her blue eyes gazed steadfastly, serenely on that hideous
  scene; she did not wince either before the storm or the human curses.</p>

  <p>Lux, shaking off the restraining hand of Forster, shouldered and pushed
  through the crowd, following the cart to the place of execution.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Danton, Robespierre, Desmoulins watched from a window to see how this
  woman could die; from another house André Chénier gazed, his heart on fire; a
  boy took a rose from his coat and cast it into the cart. The prisoner looked
  about her curiously, at this city she had never seen before.</p>

  <p>Once she seemed to sway.</p>

  <p>"You find the way long?" asked Sanson, pitying her exhaustion, her
  courage.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" she replied. "We are sure to arrive some time."</p>

  <p>He offered her his chair, she refused it; she would not betray the least
  weakness, and steadied herself against the stool; it was difficult to keep
  erect with bound hands and the jolting cart.</p>

  <p>The thunder rolled away, the rain ceased, the lightning flickered into the
  distance, the clouds thinned overhead as the cart reached the <i>Place de la
  Révolution, ci-devant</i> Place Louis XV.</p>

  <p>Sanson placed himself so that she should not see the guillotine; she
  evaded him and stared up at the sinister structure rigid against the torn
  clouds.</p>

  <p>"I have a right to be curious, I have never seen it," she smiled.</p>

  <p>Alone she walked up the steps; as an assistant snatched off her fichu,
  showing her bosom, she coloured violently; as she reached the platform she
  was pale and tranquil again.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>A lurid beam of tawny sunlight pierced the dun thunder-clouds that sailed
  away above the city and the river as she stood a second before the plank; she
  wished to speak to the people; this was forbidden; she was tied on the plank,
  it was pushed forward, the angular knife fell.</p>

  <p>A carpenter's man snatched up the head and struck the cheek; a murmur of
  rage arose from the crowd. Sanson angrily rebuked the offender; those who
  stood nearest the scaffold declared that the cheeks of the severed head had
  blushed at this final insult.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux, mad with enthusiasm, fury, exaltation, his long hair hanging wet
  on his haggard cheeks, ran and stumbled back to his <i>hôtel</i> and began to
  write his essay&mdash;"<i>Charlotte Corday</i>."</p>

  <p>His one desire was to die on the scaffold where she had perished&mdash;and
  to die soon.</p>

  <br>
  "The Lord had gifted Judith with a special beauty and fairness."
  &mdash;<i>Old Testament.</i></p>
  <hr style="width:25%">
  <br>

  <p class="first">As Charlotte de Corday had had the one resolve to which
  everything else was subordinated&mdash;to kill the tyrant and to perish
  herself&mdash;so Adam Lux had only one resolve, to honour her memory and to
  die as she had died.</p>

  <p>He did not approve of the murder of Marat; he believed that any deed of
  violence would increase anarchy, and he thought that Marat, monster as he
  might be called, was not an absolute tyrant, but a mouthpiece of a section of
  the people.</p>

  <p>Neither could he share Charlotte de Corday's conviction that peace would
  be given to France by the removal of Marat; he lived too near the heart of
  events; he had, despite his exaltation, too clear a masculine judgment to
  share such an illusion. He saw behind Marat, Danton and his lieutenant,
  Desmoulins, Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just; he knew the power held by
  such petty ruffians as Hebert and Coffinhal, Collot d'Herbois and Chaumette,
  the grip of the gutter press on the gutter bred, the blood-lust that had been
  roused among the base, the vile, the starving. Sudden civil war, threatened
  invasion, the fruits of years of corruption, of a decaying system of
  government had brought about a reign of Terror which could not be stayed even
  by a Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>The blood of Marat was like the dragon's blood: while it yet smoked a
  thousand dragons sprang from it. Marat dead was more powerful than Marat
  alive, and his murder had been one more excuse to pursue the <i>Gironde</i>
  to death, to inflame the people against all that was reasonable, moderate and
  decent.</p>

  <p>The Club of the <i>Cordeliers</i>, the day after the execution of
  Charlotte de Corday, held a <i>fête</i> to celebrate the translation of
  Marat's heart; no artist was considered worthy of designing a casket "for a
  treasure so precious," so a vase, formed of a single agate enriched with
  precious gems, was taken from the royal collections to enshrine the
  relic.</p>

  <p>Scenes of hysteria amounting to dementia took place in the gardens of the
  Luxembourg, where before an altar decorated with palms, cypress boughs and
  tricolour flags, twenty-four members of the <i>Convention</i> and twelve of
  the <i>Commune</i>, gathered to hear frenzied orators again compare Marat to
  Christ and Simonne Evrard to the Virgin Mary&mdash;because <i>"Marie a sauvé
  l'Enf ant Jésus en Egypte, l'autre (Simonne) a sous-trait Marat au glaive de
  Lafayette qui, comme Hérode, l'aurait éngorgé."</i></p>

  <p>This was more than party enthusiasm, it was the cult of an idol which had
  hundreds of thousands throughout France in its grip.</p>

  <p>To Marat had succeeded Robespierre, and the neat lawyer from Arras,
  chaste, moral and precise, was as terrible as the Genevan Calvinist with his
  disease and his rags.</p>

  <p>Had, then, Mlle. de Corday died in vain?</p>

  <p>Adam Lux believed so; many more victims would have to be thrown into this
  gulf before it was closed; the Norman heroine had been wrong, mistaken,
  deluded.</p>

  <p>But Adam Lux could sympathise most deeply with her mistake, her delusion;
  he could see her deed from her point of view, and he believed that from the
  highest standard her sacrifice had not been in vain, for she had shown, amid
  a welter of crime, cowardice and horror, enough to make an Adam Lux despair
  of his fellows, an example of brilliant courage, of what Chauveau-Lagarde had
  dared to call "sublime abnegation"; she had raised humanity to the peak of
  achievement at the very moment when, in the very place where, it had sunk
  into a slough of degradation.</p>

  <p>However useless her sacrifice might seem, it was as well, for the credit
  of mankind, that someone should affirm a noble indignation against anarchy by
  such a deed.</p>

  <p>So argued Adam Lux, as, with the storm still rolling over Paris, the lurid
  skies split by distant lightning, the tawny rays of the setting sun
  glittering on the reddened knife of the guillotine, he proceeded to cast on
  paper his "<i>Charlotte Corday</i>."</p>

  <p>In vain Forster argued with him; this time he was not to be restrained;
  his pen flew over the paper in a glowing panegyric.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Adam Lux was not alone in having been overwhelmed by the grandeur of this
  Norman girl.</p>

  <p>André Chénier, the elegant, the romantic high minded poet, had seen her
  pass and had inscribed to her magnificent verses in which he painted her as
  "young, beautiful, brilliant," going to her death as on a chariot of Hymen,
  and declared that her statue should be placed between those of Harmodius and
  Aristogiton, who delivered Athens from the Pisistratidae and had received the
  honours of immortality.</p>

  <p>Even among those who had stood under the storm inspired by a lewd
  curiosity or a vulgar malice, to watch the assassin of Marat go to her death,
  there had been those who had been touched by her superb fortitude. Many a hat
  had been raised as she had passed, many a tear been shed, some of those who
  had come to see her die turned back, not having the courage to witness her
  death.</p>

  <p>What effect, then, did this woman, so beautiful and so remarkable, not
  have on a generous, a noble soul, already reduced to despair by
  disillusionment!</p>

  <p>Adam Lux refused food and sleep while he poured out his heart on
  paper.</p>

  <p>Forster had admired the magnanimous calm of Charlotte de Corday: "her
  beauty, her charm, the halo of innocence and candour that surrounded her,"
  the purity of her soul manifest in her demeanour, <i>la belle force
  héroïque</i> that she showed in accepting the full consequences of her act,
  without complaint or weakness.</p>

  <p>In writing to his wife of the heroine, Forster described the "serenity of
  her visage, the calm of her attitude" when relating the death of Charlotte de
  Corday; he declared that it was obvious that she loved liberty and the
  Republic with enthusiasm, and that her memory would always live in "the
  hearts of those who admired simple grandeur."</p>

  <p>But he tried to restrain Adam Lux from publicly proclaiming his enthusiasm
  for this "unique and immortal memory"; Paris was in full "Terror"; the cause
  of the <i>Gironde</i> had been hopelessly lost and the heads fell daily on
  the <i>Place de la Révolution</i> and on nearly every market-square in
  France.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux refused to listen; in the intervals between the composition of
  his brochure and his snatched sleep he went about Paris, in the burning July
  heat still sulphurous and sombre, collecting details about Charlotte de
  Corday.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Her story did not end with her death; there were poignant and dreadful
  details to inflame the fury, the enthusiasm of Adam Lux.</p>

  <p>The carpenter's assistant's blow on her dead cheek had raised murmurs of
  rage even from that crowd; Sanson had vehemently denied complicity in this
  infamy; Antoine-François Sergent-Marceau, a deputy, had written to the
  President of the Criminal Court a fiery protest against the outrage, in
  which, while wholly blaming Charlotte de Corday as a "<i>monstre</i>," he had
  remarked on her serenity, the nobility of her conduct, which had silenced her
  enemies, and denounced "the feeble and atrocious outrage" of the man who, in
  showing the head to the crowd, had struck it across the still palpitating
  cheek.</p>

  <p>If this act filled a <i>Maratiste</i> with horror, what rage and despair
  did it not arouse in an Adam Lux, and how unendurable was this added
  detail&mdash;that the severed head had blushed, from pain, said some, from
  indignation, said others; several witnesses who had stood close to the
  scaffold had attested to this terrible blush, and doctors entered into an
  argument as to whether or not it was possible that the severed head was
  capable of sensation? Some said that the wretch's hand was blood-stained and
  it was this sinister red that had coloured the dead face, others that the
  storm light of the sun, then parting the livid clouds, had given this last
  glow of colour to Charlotte de Corday's cheeks. Those who had known her
  remembered her modesty, her pride, and that she had blushed easily and
  frequently.</p>

  <p>Nor was this the only sacrilege; calumny threw mud at her memory; she was
  described in the press as debauched, the mistress of a succession of priests,
  royalists, <i>Girondists</i>&mdash;her pockets had been full of false money,
  she had gloated with fiendish relish over Marat's dead body, she was a virago
  with her mouth full of obscene language, and when she was condemned to death
  she had declared herself four months with child, in order to prolong her life
  until the Federalists should have reached Paris.</p>

  <p>The same lie had been uttered of Jeanne d'Arc.</p>

  <p>The medical evidence refuted these slanders; the body of Charlotte de
  Corday was taken to the <i>Hôpital de la Charité</i>, where an autopsy was
  performed in the presence of several doctors, of the painter David, and
  several other deputies and journalists eager to dishonour the memory of the
  assassin of Marat.</p>

  <p>They were disappointed; one of them exclaimed in disgust: <i>"Le monstre
  fut une fille, vertueuse de la vertu des femmes, c'est-à-dire
  chaste."</i></p>

  <p>An engraving of this scene, hastily executed, showed the body on a plank,
  the head laid to the neck, the white gown put on for the seduction of Marat,
  soaked with blood to the waist and being removed by the hands of malice and
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>What maddening details were these for the sensitive nerves of a man who
  had given up medicine because he could not face the study of anatomy? There
  was but one consolation; she could not have guessed what they would do to
  her; among all the terrors she had faced, she had not faced that. There were
  some suspicions and some curiosities of which mankind was capable of which
  she would never dream.</p>

  <p>When the prying eyes of her enemies had done with her she was buried in
  the cemetery of the Madeleine, <i>rue d'Anjou-Saint-Honoré</i>, in the common
  <i>fosse</i>, her grave being No. 5; that next, No. 4, contained, under a
  heap of quick-lime, the remains of the man whose health she had refused to
  drink that May evening when she had been gay in rose-coloured
  taffetas&mdash;Louis XVI; No. 6 was yet empty; it was filled, a few months
  later, by the body, also decapitated, of <i>Citoyen Prince</i>, Louis
  d'Orléans, in whose vast gallery of shops Charlotte de Corday had bought the
  40-<i>sous</i> knife.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The news reached Caen; Madame de Bretteville's house was besieged by an
  angry crowd; Leclerc hid the silver plate in the back of Lunel's shop where
  Madame de Bretteville cowered, hidden, while her empty apartment was
  searched; the news reached Argentan and the poor dwelling of M. de Corday.
  "She acted contrary to her nature!" he exclaimed, and fainted; exile awaited
  him and Eléonore; he left Normandy for Spain, where he died, refusing to
  discuss Charlotte's act. "What can I say? I do not recognise my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Her friends, the ex-nuns, Mlle. Forbin, Madame de Pontécoulant, refused to
  mention her name&mdash;to them she was a murderess and damned.</p>

  <p>The news reached Charles Barbaroux, in full flight with his friends under
  the protection of the regiment of &mdash;&mdash;, reached Pétion, to whom she
  had said: "Citizen, one day you will know me."</p>

  <p>Barbaroux, hearing that he was accused of being her accomplice, declared:
  "If she had consulted me, and if it had been possible to advise on such an
  act, it would not have been to Marat's heart I should have shown the
  way."</p>

  <p>Jean-Baptiste Salle thought at once of writing a tragedy on the heroine.
  The news reached Mesnil-Imbert, where the faithful Marjotte risked her life
  to preserve that of her master, M. de Corday de Cauvigny, who still lived in
  the moated <i>château</i> where his grandchild had passed so many happy
  hours; the simple servant, the proud old man, wept together the loss of the
  beloved. "She was so gay! <i>une gaîté folle</i>, one had to leave everything
  to play with her!"</p>

  <p>The news reached Louis-Gustave Doulcet, Comte de Pontécoulant, who had
  been four days away from Paris, and overwhelmed him with horror; he had never
  received her letter asking him to be her advocate; by some unaccountable
  mischance it had not been delivered before he left the capital; he was a
  bold, honourable man, this hideous accident had caused one more pang to
  Charlotte de Corday, an endless grief to him. He could never forget that she
  had accused him of cowardice, believed herself forsaken by him; he wrote at
  once to the papers, declaring that if he had known that Mlle. de Corday had
  done him the honour to select him as her advocate he would have hastened to
  her side&mdash;he was her friend, her fellow-citizen, a Norman, of the same
  caste.</p>

  <p>The news reached Klopstock in his study; to him the Norman maiden was a
  heroine, he had her portrait painted, surrounded by laurels; he composed
  verses in her honour; she was not a murderess, but a sublime creature, her
  judges were covered with infamy, but her story would be told with admiration
  by future generations. Knobel also wrote of the French heroine as the angel
  of liberty sent by God to slay the atrocious Marat. Kerner cried, in a
  transport when he read of the deed of Charlotte de Corday in the papers: "She
  has outstripped us all!"</p>

  <p>The news reached Madame Roland, herself so fervent a pupil of Plutarch and
  J. J. Rousseau, six weeks a prisoner and soon to be sent to the obscure and
  infected cell in the <i>abbaye</i> where Charlotte de Corday had passed two
  nights.</p>

  <p>"She was a heroine worthy of a better time," exclaimed the lover of Buzot;
  then, when she heard of the enthusiasm shown at the Marat festivals&mdash;"I
  do not wish to leave this place except to die."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>But on no one did this act, this personality, make the impression that it
  did on Adam Lux; he was wholly consecrated to her memory. Forster took from
  him the sheets of his eulogy and read them with much misgiving. In stiff,
  poor French, with a Teutonic turn, the young German declared the Norman
  virgin sublime, incomparable, superior to anything that Rome or Sparta ever
  produced&mdash;"greater than Brutus, greater than Cato...She was a celestial
  being for whom the earth was not fit, she passed like a flash of lightning,
  but she left her memory."</p>

  <p>Lux declared that he loved better than ever the France for which she had
  died, that he hated more than ever the tyranny she had braved. Careless of
  death, he defied again the <i>Montagnards</i>; he asked them to send him to
  the scaffold. that her blood had sanctified as an altar, to strike off his
  severed head as hers had been struck off&mdash;"It will be another tigerish
  spectacle for your cannibal populace."</p>

  <p>Forster reasoned with him to suppress his feelings; his death would
  benefit no one; good might yet come from the Revolution, the worst might be
  over, to wait quietly was the only prudent course&mdash;his friend was past
  all such arguments; he signed his brochure "Adam Lux, deputy-extraordinary of
  Mayence," and took it to the printer.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>There are some experiences, at once sublime and terrible, that the
  sensitive soul will not endure and live; there are some spectacles, at once
  grand and pitiful, that are intolerable; the enthusiastic agony can be
  assuaged only by death. There are some heights reached by human emotion from
  which there can be no descent; on this peak there must be an end of mortality
  and what is immortal must dissolve into eternity.</p>

  <p>Several people had destroyed themselves during these hideous events in
  France, not from fear or hysteria, but from a disdain to live helpless amid
  anarchy.</p>

  <p>This feeling had animated Adam Lux when he had decided to shoot himself
  before the Convention; to it was now added another, even more powerful, a
  mingled admiration and pity for a noble delicate woman, vainly sacrificed,
  whom he could not save or avenge.</p>

  <p>The sentiment that animated Adam Lux was that which caused men to invent
  chivalry, which is a clumsy symbol for the inexpressible; for this stranger
  he felt all that yearning tenderness of masculinity over femininity which is
  neither love nor lust, but half compassion and half reverence. He was
  agonised by her suffering, humiliated by her courage&mdash;what, a world of
  men, and <i>this</i> allowed to happen to a woman!</p>

  <p>He dwelt on all the pitiful details, her loneliness, her innocence, the
  long rude journey in the great heat, the coarse attentions of her inferiors,
  the rough lodgings, her solitude in Paris, without a friend, advice or
  comfort, her unshaken resolution, the fortitude with which she had overcome
  feminine weakness and timidity, the courage with which she had endured four
  days of moral and physical torture, fatigue and abandonment, still finding at
  the end the fortitude to endure the long progress to the scaffold, not only
  with ordinary decency, but with perfect tranquillity and majestic
  composure.</p>

  <p>He read her letter to Charles Barbaroux, written when she knew she had
  only a few hours to live, and his heart was torn at her serenity, her gaiety,
  her dignity&mdash;nothing forced, no bravado or levity, no theatrical posing,
  no self-pity, only a gentle melancholy under the cool courage, the charming
  jest.</p>

  <p>All her actions were marked by complete sanity&mdash;they were the results
  of the mature decisions of a strong mind; not hysteria nor weak-mindedness,
  not lunacy nor mania had inspired Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>Her guiding forces had been a noble moral indignation, an impulse of
  self-sacrifice, a disdain to live when tyranny ruled.</p>

  <p>All this Adam Lux, himself so much of the same temper, completely
  understood; he had for her that complete sympathy that amounts to a passion.
  Peasant-born himself, he fully realised the fineness of this aristocrat, her
  delicacy, her courtesy, her exquisite refinement&mdash;as every detail of her
  life was revealed and mouthed over by the curious and the malicious, he saw
  it as pure as her prying enemies had found her body. Nothing marred that
  short life, no scandal, no dispute, no weakness, temper or foolishness; all
  her days had been dedicated to the things of the spirit, a gentle childhood,
  a meek maidenhood, a brilliant maturity, a sublime death&mdash;such a life to
  Adam Lux was a noble work of art, like a classic statue of flawless marble, a
  grand poem, a superb piece of music.</p>

  <p>Her beauty moved him to a terrible tenderness. Even her enemies had
  praised her superb shoulders and bosom, her admirable hands and arms, the
  rich outline of her shape, the loveliness of her face&mdash;hers was a beauty
  no one could ignore, and he had seen her going to her death, her
  rain-drenched red robe clinging to her figure so that every curve was
  revealed, her blue eyes, at once proud and tender, searching the crowd with
  looks of compassion, her pose majestic despite the bound hands.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux at this sight had felt emotions rise within him that he did not
  know he was capable of, emotions that he did not know were possible to
  humanity; with all the force of a passionate and noble nature he fell in
  love, not with the woman, but with what she represented.</p>

  <p>She had written to Charles Barbaroux&mdash;"<i>tomorrow, speaking in the
  Roman fashion, I shall have lived</i>"&mdash;and with her death she had taken
  on a new existence; from her mutilated body had sprung her legend, a
  superhuman creature, saint, martyr, heroine, an angel of vengeance armed by
  Divine wrath, lovely beyond the common loveliness of women&mdash;"For the
  Lord had given Judith a special beauty and fairness."</p>

  <p>Her chastity added to her dignity; she had not been inspired by earthly
  love nor tainted by earthly lust, she had put aside even the most delicate
  homage, she had forgone marriage, children, all worldly comfort, safety and
  company&mdash;she was utterly alone; she had really forgone what masculine
  vanity thought no fair young woman could forgo. There was amazement as well
  as anger in the cry of her enemies: <i>"Elle était vierge!"</i></p>

  <p>To Adam Lux this completed her perfection&mdash;was it not always the
  virgin who was sacrificed? Iphigenia, Antigone, Jephthah's daughter&mdash;the
  young, the pure, the lovely, offering all the riches of the untasted future,
  as the plucked blossom offers all the beauty of the fruit.</p>

  <p>Yet Adam Lux did not only see Charlotte de Corday under this angelic
  guise; he understood, he pitied, he yearned over the delicate human being. He
  dwelt on her tedious journey, the heat, the fatigue, the loneliness, the
  hundred horrors of unprotected travel to one bred so finely, used to a
  conventual life, the pitiful overcoming of modesty and timidity in her calls
  on Lauze Deperret, on Marat, the sacrifice represented by the powdered hair,
  the rose gauze scarf, the long agony from the hour she struck Marat at
  half-past seven on July 13th to her own death, at about the same hour, on
  July 17th. He considered, in angry shame, her last day. She had been before
  the Tribunal at eight o'clock, she had sat there till half-past one without
  faltering, she had gone back to her cell to wait, in the company of
  strangers, for the death-cart; she had carried out meekly, even gaily, the
  death toilette, she had stood erect through the long journey to the scaffold,
  drenched by the storm, howled at by the mob, with none but her executioner
  for company&mdash;eight o'clock in the morning until the evening and no trace
  of fatigue or fear on this tender creature, whose weakness should have
  inspired respect, protection and chivalry.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux demanded the right to share her fate; he could do nothing
  else&mdash;he had no means of paying her a tribute save by his pen and his
  life-blood.</p>

  <p>When his pamphlet was printed he sent copies of it to the press and
  everywhere else where he thought it would attract attention to himself and
  his stern demand to die.</p>

  <p>Forster wrote: "Charlotte Corday has turned the head of this fine young
  man, and he sees now no other happiness save that of dying for her and for
  the <i>Gironde</i>, the only party which, according to him, has any right on
  its side. He is so deeply affected, so profoundly dominated by his
  sentiments, that for the past week he has only eaten about a quarter of a
  pound of bread a day."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Most of the Parisian papers found the brochure so daring that they
  suspected the odd Latin name Lux to be a <i>nom de guerre</i>. None took the
  challenge seriously; the <i>Courrier de l'Egalité</i> described the author as
  a maniac who had been electrified by the courage and fortitude of Charlotte
  Corday&mdash;and recommended him to take cold baths.</p>

  <p>The government did not take the affair so lightly. Georges Kerner heard of
  the likely arrest of his friend and hastened to the <i>hôtel des Patriotes
  Hollandais</i> to entreat Adam Lux to fly from Paris. In refusing Adam Lux
  pressed Kerner to leave him and to spare him the agony of involving him in
  his fate.</p>

  <p>His action had not been, he argued, that of a fanatic or a maniac; he had
  been most bitterly deceived and had unintentionally deceived others; he had
  vehemently persuaded his countrymen to join France, which had become an
  outpost of Hell&mdash;he owed his life as an expiation.</p>

  <p>His home was ruined, his family separated from him by a waste of war, he
  was poor, helpless; the party on which he had placed his hopes, the
  <i>Gironde</i>, were defeated, in flight&mdash;what could anyone do but
  die?</p>

  <p>The two young Germans mingled tears with their farewells&mdash;their hopes
  had been so high, their disappointment so cruel; there was only one
  consolation left, that they might be among the vanguard that must perish in
  the first shock of battle, and that those coming after them might pass over
  their dead bodies to liberty.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On July 24th, in the morning, the police entered the <i>hôtel des
  Patrîotes Hollartdais</i>, arrested Adam Lux and seized his papers, which
  consisted of several copies of his two pamphlets, the drafts of his letters
  to Pétion and Guadet and the address he had intended to read before
  destroying himself in front of the Convention.</p>

  <p>The same day he was brought before the Committee of General Safety.</p>

  <p>"Why did you make this insensate project to destroy yourself?"</p>

  <p>"The project was not insensate. A man's death may be of more benefit than
  his life&mdash;however, there is a language of heroism that it is useless to
  use to those who do not even know the grammar."</p>

  <p>"Why did you reveal your design to Guadet and Pétion?"</p>

  <p>"I did not wish to be taken for a madman or one in despair. I wanted it
  known that my suicide was undertaken in cold blood."</p>

  <p>"But why did you think that Guadet and Pétion would encourage you? Did
  they not find it atrocious and did you not falter in your resolution?"</p>

  <p>"I did not falter and patriotism often takes the air of an atrocity."</p>

  <p>"Some people take all manner of means to attract attention to themselves
  and to secure employment. Have you solicited any place since your arrival in
  France?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Have you solicited your travelling expenses?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The Committee was baffled and referred Adam Lux to the Revolutionary
  Tribunal. He was sent to the prison of La Force to await this second trial
  and there forgotten, together with a number of notable men who expected from
  day to day either to be dragged to the guillotine or to be
  <i>septembrisés</i>, as the cant phrase, dating from the massacres in the
  prisons of September, 1790, went.</p>

  <p>Among these prisoners were several members of the <i>Gironde</i>,
  including Pierre-Victorin Vergniaud, Valazé, Miranda, the brilliant, austere
  Spanish soldier, Montané, arrested for favouring Charlotte de Corday when he
  had presided at her trial, and Champagneux, who had been under Roland at the
  Ministry of the Interior and was the intimate friend of this unhappy man,
  then in hiding.</p>

  <p>These men, against whom nothing was alleged save their political
  principles, were not kept with much strictness. They were allowed books,
  writing materials, one another's company, and the liberty to walk under the
  trees of the courtyard; they lived, however, in constant apprehension of a
  horrible death and endured the mental torture of inactivity while their
  country was in a state of anarchy, their goods confiscated, their families in
  hiding, want or danger.</p>

  <p>None of these things could break their spirits; all of them could have
  said with Madame Roland in the <i>abbaye</i>: "I would rather perish here
  than owe my liberty to Prussian or Austrian invaders."</p>

  <p>This ferocious sentiment of patriotism for the country that had already
  destroyed what they held dearer than life, and which, any moment, might take
  life itself, inspired these men with a cheerful fortitude which was fully
  shared by Adam Lux. Only, while they dared to hope to be returned to life, he
  was impatient for death.</p>

  <p><i>Le Batave</i>, the Dutch paper published in Paris for the refugees from
  Holland, thus commented on the arrest of the young deputy from Mayence: "His
  spirit seems to have been carried to the last degree of exaltation from the
  instant that Charlotte Corday perished on the scaffold. He sees death under
  the most smiling colours; he hopes to die for his heroine."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>While Adam Lux waited in La Force, the <i>Maratistes</i> proceeded to the
  formal apotheosis of their hero, the cult of the friend of the people.
  Hundreds of prints showing the formidable and brutal features of Marat poured
  from the Press, while his portrait appeared on tie-pins, fans, book-markers,
  amulets of all kinds, hanging on the breasts of men and round the necks of
  women, in the midst of public trophies and on the wrists of children. There
  were representations of the murder under every possible form, from a
  life-size waxwork shown in the <i>Palais Egalité</i> to a small model
  attached to a calendar of the new months of the Republic. Statues of the
  Virgin were taken down in the streets and replaced by those of Marat, shops
  took as their trade name <i>"Au Grand Marat,"</i> three French theatres
  showed, or had in preparation, dramas on this subject; there were hymns,
  poems, songs in honour of Charlotte de Corday's victim; in the
  <i>ci-devant</i> Chapel at Versailles and the great mansion of the Condés in
  Paris, the <i>ci-devant</i> Palais-Bourbon, a musical <i>scena</i>, "The
  Apotheosis of Lepelletier and Marat," was given.</p>

  <p>The mania spread to the Provinces; not only streets and houses, but twenty
  towns added Marat to their names. Even the greedy vanity of the man whose
  life had been one effort to satisfy ambition would have been gorged could he
  have known of this posthumous fame. On August 19th <i>fêtes</i> were held in
  honour of Marat, to whom a granite column had already been raised at the
  expense of the <i>Jacobins, les vrais sans-culottes</i>, and to whom it was
  proposed to erect an obelisk in the <i>Place de la Réunion (Place du
  Carrousel)</i>.</p>

  <p>On this August day all the deputies of the <i>Convention</i>, the
  <i>Commune</i>, all the members of the clubs and societies, turned out,
  willy-nilly, to do honour to Marat. Four citizens carried a litter on which
  was the filthy old bath in which Marat had died, another four supported in
  the same manner his dirty chair, desk, pen, paper and ink, a third group held
  aloft his bust. The flags, standards and scarves of the tricolour accounted
  for hundreds of yards of bunting; a touch of horror was given to this bizarre
  display by the sanguinary oratory of Roussillon: "Citizens, we do not demand
  laurels for Marat, but blood. Swear to avenge his death in the blood of his
  enemies."</p>

  <p>A battalion of Amazons sent a fiery message to the <i>Jacobins:</i> "And
  we, we also will rise in a body, and we also will find the courage to face
  the dangers of war&mdash;we also are patriotic and weep at the death of
  Marat."</p>

  <p>When the pompous monument in the <i>Place de la Réunion</i> was completed
  it consisted of two tombs behind a grille in a <i>pyramide gothique</i>; this
  monstrosity contained in the interior the famous bath and other personal
  relics of Marat, which, lit by a lamp, could be seen through the grille; the
  other cenotaph was in honour of the Pole Lazouski, whose life and death had
  pleased the people; a sentinel kept guard over this grotesque monument, and
  this honour was continued until one of the ragged, starving guards perished
  of cold.</p>

  <p>In the revolutionary calendar Marat took his place as Saint Marat, one of
  the corridors in the <i>Invalides</i> was named <i>corridor de Marat</i>,
  Montmartre became Montmarat, patriots registered their children as
  Brutus-Marat, Marat-Brutus and Marat la Montange; Marat's bust was placed
  beside that of Brutus in the Assembly.</p>

  <p>David worked hard at his <i>Death of Marat</i>, which was to hang with the
  companion piece, <i>The Death of Lepelletier</i>, who had been murdered for
  voting the death of the King, in the chamber used by the Convention. The
  painter achieved more success with his effort at realism than he had ever
  attained in his frigid classical compositions. This sombre subject, with its
  dreadful fascination, with the vivid beauty of the assassin and the dark face
  and terrible appearance of the victim, with its sordid background, was suited
  to the gloomy brush of David, his hard, stiff technique; under his treatment
  this unique scene lost nothing of its horror. By order of the government the
  painting was to be engraved and a thousand copies distributed about the
  country. David had been promised 24,000 <i>livres</i> for his labour, which
  was to include the cost of the engraving, but he never received more than
  12,000, so that the engraving was abandoned, as was also, for the same
  financial reason, a project to have Marat's death taken as the subject for a
  tapestry to be made at the <i>Gobelins</i>.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the preparations for the <i>panthéonisation</i> of Marat went
  forward and Adam Lux waited in La Force for permission to die for Charlotte
  de Corday.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>This same month of August saw other activities on the part of the
  government of June and; the <i>Federalists</i> (united departments) divided,
  without a central authority, without capable leaders, disheartened,
  bewildered, often apathetic, refusing to make common cause with the Royalists
  or the invaders, were easily dispersed or defeated by the energy of the
  government and suffered terrible reprisals for their defiance of Paris.</p>

  <p>The foreign enemy was not to be so lightly affronted; the men,
  Robespierre, Danton, Couthon, Desmoulins, who exploited the delirium of the
  mob against their opponents under the rule of <i>il faut guillotiner ou
  s'attendre à l'être</i>, undertook the titanic task of leading this country,
  devouring her own entrails, against a Europe in arms&mdash;not against
  France, but against the French Revolution.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mountain</i> had its heroism, its grand words, the strength of its
  own fury: "The Kings of Europe," cried Danton, this giant with the mask of a
  Miltonic Satan, "advance on France! France as gage of battle throws at them
  the head of a King!"</p>

  <p>The defiance was sincere; the <i>Mountain</i> was as savagely patriotic as
  the <i>Gironde</i>. By the end of August the insurrection in the Provinces
  was crushed, save for the two towns of Toulon and Lyons, the first of which
  had admitted the English as allies, the second of which resisted desperately
  the attempt of the Assembly to wipe her off the map of France.</p>

  <p>The government worked like Titans of energy in their dens; the members of
  the Committee of Ten laboured in the Pavilion of Flora day and night,
  throwing themselves on mattresses for a few hours' rest, solid in their
  energy, their implacable force, their resolve to fashion a great nation out
  of the blood and fire of the revolution; other committees took up the work,
  efficiently, vigorously, without pause or pity.</p>

  <p>These men were in all the opposite of the <i>Girondists</i>; they acted
  instead of talking, they did not hesitate, were not squeamish or nice, did
  not despair because they saw anarchy around them, they were hard, cruel,
  coarse, unscrupulous. Where the <i>Gironde</i>, a band of idealists without a
  co-ordinated policy, had failed, these men, one in spirit, inured with
  tireless energy and resolve, succeeded.</p>

  <p>They had their answer ready for advancing Europe "Until the moment that
  the enemy is chased from our territory, every Frenchman will be under
  arms&mdash;the young men to carry weapons, the married men to forge them, the
  women to make tents, the children to cut bandages, the old men to incite the
  people with speeches of hatred against Kings and in praise of the unity of
  the Republic, the levy will be general&mdash;the citizens from eighteen to
  twenty-five will march first...the banners will carry this device: '<i>Le
  peuple français debout contre les tyrans</i>! "</p>

  <p>These words flung at the Assembly on August 23rd by Bertrand Barère would
  not have been disdained by Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>By a decree of that day 200,000 men were to be raised. The first to go
  were the boys&mdash;"these children, rushed by thousands to the frontiers,
  will make Europe tremble."</p>

  <p>Lazare Carnot, brave, implacable, cool, one of the greatest soldiers of
  any age, organised this fury of resistance, brought down to realities this
  national enthusiasm; Commander-in-Chief of these ragged hordes, he patiently
  organised the arming, clothing, feeding of thousands of peasants,
  shopkeepers, clerks, schoolboys, ruffians and adventurers; the Revolution had
  found a great man of action.</p>

  <p>The property of the <i>émigrés</i> was realised to pay for these ardent,
  raw forces; powder was manufactured by the ton, Chappe came forward with his
  new invention of the telegraph, shirts and shoes were taken from the civil
  population; officers arose, Hoche, Jourdan, Moreau, noble instructions were
  given to the famished troops&mdash;"Only by long labours, by privations, by
  fatigues and sufferings can you purchase the honour to fight and die for your
  country."</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday might have allowed some antique virtue to these rude
  patriots; she might have found among them&mdash;these grim, badly armed,
  half-fed, unpaid medley of men who rushed to the menaced frontiers, some
  heroes as worthy of praise as Buzot, Barbaroux, or any of the noble
  ineffectual spirits of the <i>Gironde</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>While France thus with superhuman efforts put her half-million men into
  the field, she did not relax her furies against those whom she considered
  traitors; the whole country was an armed camp, the jails were full, the
  guillotine never lacked victims; side by side, heroism, baseness. While the
  bold energy of Carnot organised the defence of France, while the fiery
  courage of Danton and Barère urged the nation to sacrifice, the elegant hand
  of Hébert traced obscene libels against the <i>Gironde</i> and filthy attacks
  on Madame Roland, which were shouted beneath her prison window, and the
  fugitive deputies from Caen were hunted down like wild beasts from one
  hiding-place to another. Talent, virtue, integrity, innocence, courage, were
  daily destroyed in the persons of men and women of every age and class.</p>

  <p>Under the yellowing trees of the prison courtyard Adam Lux walked day
  after day with Champagneux; like Madame Roland he consoled himself by reading
  Plutarch, like Charlotte de Corday he gave himself enthusiastically to the
  doctrines of Rousseau. He discussed the philosopher with Champagneux, who
  related how Rousseau's friend, Hérault de Séchelles&mdash;who had been
  President of the Convention on the days of the downfall of the
  <i>Gironde</i>&mdash;had been about to give him the manuscript of
  <i>Emile</i> when he had been arrested.</p>

  <p>Lux marvelled that the friend of Rousseau could be the friend of
  Robespierre.</p>

  <p>"Hérault is noble and rich," said Champagneux, "and these two crimes can
  now only be expiated by other crimes. These days one must be executioner or
  victim."</p>

  <p>The shrewd, cultured Frenchman observed the young German with compassion
  and admiration, and considered that he had "the candour, the purity of a man
  who has always lived in the midst of forests, all the private and public
  virtues, with an unshakable firmness and vigour of soul."</p>

  <p>The Terror advanced. By the end of August Lux learned of the execution of
  Adam-Philippe, Comte de Custine, who, triumphant in Mayence, had accepted his
  allegiance in the name of the French Republic.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards Lux was brought before Sullier and Fouquier-Tinville;
  he repeated his tale of his scheme of a suicide to reconcile all parties, and
  to show the courage of "an impartial republican." He was asked his opinion of
  the <i>Girondists</i> who were his fellow-prisoners. Lux gave them warm
  praise and repeated his defiance of anarchy; he was returned to prison and
  his fate was not in doubt.</p>

  <p>The young German was not without friends. Forster had found employment
  under the government and had left Paris, but Georges Kerner frequently
  visited him in prison, and a former professor at the University of Mayence,
  Wedekind, who had received an appointment as <i>médecin-en-chef des armées de
  la République</i>, made a determined attempt to save his fellow-citizen, whom
  he had known in the <i>Convention rhénane</i>. This compassionate doctor sent
  a letter to <i>Le Journal de la Montagne</i>, which was published on
  September 4th; this tactful appeal termed the <i>Girondists</i>
  "<i>monstres</i>" and tried to show Lux as their mere tool.</p>

  <p>Striving by every means to arouse pity, the letter painted the ruined
  home, the broken fortunes of Lux, his intense studies, his melancholy
  dispositions, his love for his far distant wife, his enforced chastity owing
  to his marital fidelity&mdash;all these causes, said the letter, had driven
  Adam Lux absolutely mad. And the climax of his lunacy came with the sight of
  the beauty of Charlotte de Corday, which he had desired with a frenzied
  obsession ever since.</p>

  <p>Should he be punished for lunacy?</p>

  <p>Would it not be better to send him to a hospital or to America? No doubt
  his disease would soon be cured with a cottage, some land and a pretty
  companion, where he would soon learn to put the right value on "the disorders
  and the violent shocks of passion that accompany a great revolution."</p>

  <p>On the day this article appeared, Lux, impatient of the delay in his case,
  wrote to the Public Prosecutor denouncing himself; he used a feigned hand and
  a feigned name, Moschenberg.</p>

  <p>"What, he still lives, this bold man who called Marat a monster, who said
  that Charlotte Corday was greater than Brutus, that her judges were
  executioners?"</p>

  <p>No notice being taken of this letter, he wrote again under his own name,
  demanding to be brought to trial; on September 20th he wrote again&mdash;"I
  have been in prison two months&mdash;cannot my case be dealt with?"</p>

  <p>By chance he obtained a copy of the paper with Wedekind's letter; it threw
  him, who usually showed such a stoic courage, into a state of the liveliest
  emotion; he was deeply wounded at being represented as a madman. Kerner,
  coming to visit him, found him pacing up and down the courtyard, the
  offending paper in his grip.</p>

  <p>His friends tried to persuade him to accept the generous hand held out, to
  use this stratagem to save himself&mdash;"until better times," urged
  Kerner.</p>

  <p>Montané, Vergniaud, Miranda, all of whom felt a warm affection for the
  German so cruelly trapped by his naïve enthusiasm for France, begged him not
  to throw away his life.</p>

  <p>But Adam Lux wrote to the editor of <i>Le Journal de la Montagne</i>,
  sternly denying his own insanity or the intrigues of the
  <i>Gironde</i>&mdash;what he had done had been done coolly, in full
  possession of his senses, and he wished, without excuses, to take the full
  consequences.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>About the date that a dry denial of the plea put forward in Wedekind's
  letter appeared in the same paper&mdash;"Adam Lux pretends not to be
  insane"&mdash;the final triumph of Marat took place, the Assembly voted the
  decrees that made him immortal; though it was the last days of September,
  1794, before Paris saw the translation of his mortal remains from the garden
  of the <i>Cordeliers</i> to the <i>Panthéon&mdash;ci-devant</i> church of
  <i>Sainte Geneviève de Paris</i>. This ceremony took place amid the
  acclamations of the mob; the funeral proceeded with great pomp to the ancient
  church, then changed into a Temple, or <i>Panthéon</i>, after the classic
  taste of the Revolution. The original Pantheon, built by Agrippa in Rome, had
  been at this period long converted into a Christian church, so does man
  juggle with terms in his manifold superstitions.</p>

  <p>The friend of the people was thus left in the company of all the gods,
  while the <i>impurs restes</i> of Mirabeau were at the same time cast out of
  the sacred temple.</p>

  <p>The ceremony was not without dignity; choir-boys sang music composed by
  Etienne-Nicolas Méhul, the young Belgian who had been Gluck's pupil, and who
  was forced to bend his talent to the trend of the times.</p>

  <p>The impartiality of the artist was also shown by Luigi Maria Cherubini,
  afterwards patronised by the restored Bourbons, who wrote the music to the
  words of a chorus written by Marie-Joseph de Chénier, younger brother of the
  poet, André, who had praised Charlotte de Corday in noble verse. This chorus
  celebrated the glory of the martyrs and defenders of Liberty. To these
  strains and to the sound of the eulogy pronounced by the President of the
  Convention, the body of Marat was lowered into the vault; he was now, his
  followers believed, assured of immortality and at rest for ever in the temple
  of fame, over which all the gods watched.</p>

  <p>Adoration could go no further, the apotheosis of Marat was complete,
  Albertine, his sister, and Simonne Evrard embraced each other with tears of
  joy, believing that they had really been in the service of a divine
  being.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>September, 1793, while Marat was being raised by the vote of the
  <i>Mountain</i> to the highest honour the mind of man can conceive, some
  others who had believed themselves apostles of liberty, who were also
  disciples of J. J. Rousseau, republicans and friends of the people, were
  being harried from covert to covert, like hunted vermin. The
  <i>Girondists</i> who had fled to Caen, where Charlotte de Corday had
  listened to their enthusiastic eloquence, had been proscribed. On the 4th of
  September (date of Wedekind's letter in favour of Adam Lux) there had been a
  riot of starving people in Paris; the <i>Gironde</i> had been accused of
  offering the Parisians classic phrases instead of bread, the <i>Mountain</i>
  offered them (as Madame Roland had predicted) corpses instead of loaves, and
  this pleased better. This time it was the heads of the members of the
  <i>Gironde</i> that were offered; the refugees were denounced and pursued.
  These unhappy, brave, honest, high-minded people found themselves reduced to
  the most miserable straits.</p>

  <p>After falling back with the beaten troops of Normandy they separated into
  little groups; the men who had come most under the notice of Charlotte de
  Corday and Adam Lux chanced to keep together, Marguerite-Elie Guadet and
  Jérôme Pétion, who dissuaded the young German from suicide, Jean-Baptiste
  Louvet, the novelist with whom Mlle. de Corday had spoken in Caen, Charles
  Barbaroux, to whom she had written the letter that had inspired Adam Lux,
  fled together on September 20th to Gascony. Spied upon and pursued by the
  agents of the Committee of Public Safety, they hastened on from Bec d'Ambez,
  where they had been recognised, towards Saint Emilion, where Guadet's father
  had a property and where they hoped to find an asylum; while in Gascony they
  had been joined by Jean-Baptiste Salles, who, in furtive leisure, was writing
  his tragedy, "<i>Charlotte de Corday</i>," and Charles Valady.</p>

  <p>On the 29th of September the inhabitants of Saint-Emilion saw seven men
  whom they took to be deserters, and whom no one would shelter, wandering the
  streets, destitute; they were the proscribed deputies thus described to the
  police on their heels&mdash;"seven strangers, some very tall, wearing
  high-crowned hats with white caps beneath, brown coats with red facings, each
  having a swordstick and, under the arm, a canvas clothes-bag."</p>

  <p>Leaving Saint-Emilion they made for the <i>château</i> of Guadet
  <i>père</i>, but learning that Tallien, one of the government commissioners,
  was at Réole, between them and their objective, they dispersed; their
  desperate objective was the Netherlands, whence they hoped to gain
  America.</p>

  <p>Elie Guadet's sister-in-law, Madame Bouquey, with intrepid devotion,
  hurried from Paris to offer her country house as a place of refuge for the
  fugitives; here she sheltered Guadet, Salles, Louvet, Valady, and Barbaroux,
  then Buzot, the lofty-minded, romantic platonic lover of Madame Roland, and
  Jérôme Pétion. These men having been "hidden in seven different places in
  fifteen days, were reduced to the last extremities."</p>

  <p>The heroic Madame Bouquey concealed them in a grotto thirty feet
  underground, at the bottom of a disused well full of decaying refuse and
  droppings of foul water. What Louvet termed the <i>angoisses affreuses</i> of
  this existence, "surrounded by pestiferous odours," was increased by a severe
  shortage of food; provisions were scarce and Madame Bouquey had the greatest
  difficulty in squeezing the bare necessaries of life, haricots, bread, coarse
  meat, out of her housekeeping without rousing suspicions. Under these
  frightful circumstances, Louvet, Barbaroux, Buzot and Pétion tried to finish
  the <i>mémoires</i>, which should serve as their justification to posterity.
  Salles worked at his <i>Charlotte de Corday</i>; Buzot secretly re-read the
  intrepid love letters smuggled to him from Madame Roland in prison; only the
  romantic Louvet was in his confidence. It was Louvet's Lodöiska (Madame
  Cholet, named from the heroine of Louvet's novel <i>Faublas</i> and the title
  of Cherubini's famous opera) who had been the intermediary, visiting Madame
  Roland in prison and forwarding the ardent vows of love and
  fidelity&mdash;there were but five of these letters, for it had not been easy
  to send them to the hunted man, and after he had left Caen the lovers had
  long ceased to be able to communicate one with the other. In the infected
  cell in the <i>abbaye</i> Madame Roland regarded Buzot's portrait, taken in
  the days of his elegance, and sternly considered suicide, in his filthy cave
  Buzot consoled himself by the memory of this ideal love.</p>

  <p>These men, whatever their faults, errors or incapacities, were of perfect
  integrity and courage; they might, earlier in their flight from Paris, have
  joined the royalists in arms or the foreigners on the frontiers and secured
  safety and a chance of reprisals against their enemies, together with an
  opportunity of satisfying the ambitions and the passions common to the young
  and ardent.</p>

  <p>These temptations they had put aside, they remained staunch republicans,
  true Frenchmen.</p>

  <p>Nothing was left them but the sublime and bitter consolations Madame
  Roland had expressed so clearly:</p>

  <p><i>"C'est un phénomène sans exemple que la régénération d'un empire faite
  paisiblement; c'est probablement une chimère. L'adversité est l'école des
  nations comme celle de l'homme et je crois bien qu'il faut être épuré par
  elle pour valoir quelque chose. En nous faisant naitre a l'époque de la
  liberté naissante, le sort nous a placés comme les enfants perdus de l'armée
  qui doit combattre pour elle et la faire triompher; c'est a nous de bien
  faire notre tâche et de préparer ainsi le bonheur des générations
  suivantes."</i></p>

  <p>In the foul obscurity of their retreat which they occupied for the
  terrible month of October, 1793, these <i>enfants perdus</i> discussed
  Charlotte de Corday, the fair young gentlewoman who had visited them with her
  precise escort at Caen, who had watched the scanty groups of volunteers
  enrolling under the banners of Wimpfen.</p>

  <p>"I was moved to see them," she had written to Barbaroux. "I thought so
  many need not be sacrificed&mdash;the hand of a woman without consequence
  should be, I thought, sufficient."</p>

  <p>They discussed her words, her beauty, her tranquillity&mdash;"the time
  will come when you will know me, Citizen Pétion."</p>

  <p>They knew her now; as Salles read over his play, Barbaroux said: "Why do
  you not make Adam Lux one of your characters, he is truly enamoured of
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Crouching in the infected twilight of the foul hiding-place, Jean-Baptiste
  Louvet de Coudray, who, before the Revolution, had been a successful novelist
  and had enjoyed, in his own words, "all that can render a sensible man
  happy," scribbled his desperate <i>Mémoires</i> on odd scraps of paper,
  dating them "<i>Les Grottes de Saint-Emilion, dans la Gironde."</i></p>

  <p>Louvet, fair, blue-eyed, and of such delicacy of make and fineness of
  features that he could easily disguise himself as a woman, full of
  sensibility and emotionalism, was possessed of an undaunted courage and an
  unblemished enthusiasm that was fired by the character of Mlle. de Corday.
  His misery was heightened by his separation from Lodöiska, whom he had deeply
  loved from infancy, whom he knew to be faithful, devoted and in agony as to
  his fate. This love illuminated the foul wretchedness of the Saint-Emilion
  grottoes for Louvet as the love of Madame Roland illuminated them for Buzot;
  this manner of happiness was denied the dissolute Charles Barbaroux.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you," wrote Louvet of his friend, "surrounded by the thousand
  enchantresses your beauty has attracted; envy me my one pure love."</p>

  <p>Under these frightful circumstances, under apprehension of instant death,
  suffering, half-starved, forlorn, animated by a love and a patriotism that
  amounted to an exaltation, Louvet wrote his panegyric of Charlotte de
  Corday.</p>

  <p>"Some time after our arrival at Caen, while we were at the <i>hôtel de
  l'Intendance</i> where we all lodged, a young person presented herself,
  saying she wished to see Barbaroux. She was tall, well made, with a candid
  air and a modest bearing; there was in her face, which was both beautiful and
  charming, and in all her movements, a mingled sweetness and pride that
  announced a celestial soul. She came always accompanied by her servant and
  waited in the <i>salon</i>, where any one of us might pass at any moment.
  Since this young girl has fixed on herself the regards of the universe, we
  have naturally recalled all the circumstances of her visits, for which it is
  clear now that the help she asked for a relative [sic] was only a pretence.
  Her true reason was, without doubt, to make the acquaintance of some of the
  founders of this Republic for which she meant to sacrifice herself; and
  perhaps she was pleased to think that one day they would recall her
  countenance to their memories. It shall never be effaced from mine, O
  Charlotte Corday! In vain the libellous <i>Cordeliers</i> conspire to traduce
  thy charms in words and with the pencil, thou wilt always appear before our
  eyes superb and gentle, modest and beautiful, as thou wert, with thy bearing,
  full of dignified assurance, thy glance of fire tempered by sweetness, this
  fire that shone so brilliantly the day of thy last visit to us, just before
  thy departure to destroy this man whose hideous deformity even his idolators
  cannot render less loathsome. I here declare that she told none of us of her
  design. If such actions could be advised and if she had asked our advice, is
  it Marat we should have told her to strike? Did we not know him to be so
  devoured by a cruel disease that he had only a few days to live?...</p>

  <p>"Few have noticed, in the late tumults, what sub&mdash;limity there was in
  the proud brevity of her replies to the ruffians who judged her; how
  magnificent, too, in thought and expression is the immortal letter she
  addressed, a few hours before her death, to Barbaroux, and which she headed,
  with the delicacy only a great soul could know&mdash;'from the chamber of
  Brissot.'</p>

  <p>"If everything else worthy in the French Revolution perishes, this letter
  will survive the centuries.</p>

  <p>"O my dear Barbaroux, in all thy destiny, which contains so much any man
  might desire, I have only envied thee this&mdash;that thy name was attached
  to this letter! Ah, at least, when she was questioned, she mentioned mine! I
  have then received the reward of all my labours, my sacrifices, my pains, the
  torments that I endure in thy absence, O Lodöiska! Even if the last ill
  befalls and my ferocious persecutors assassinate thee, Lodöiska&mdash;yes,
  arrive what will, I have received my recompense: Charlotte Corday has named
  me! I am then sure of immortality!</p>

  <p>"Charlotte Corday, thou who wilt ever be the idol of the Republicans, in
  the Elysium where thy repose is shared by Vergniaud, Sidney and Brutus, hear
  my last vows! Beg of the Eternal Being that He will spare my wife, that He
  will protect her, that He will return her to me, that He will grant us some
  corner of the earth where, in honourable poverty, I can labour for
  her&mdash;hidden from our enemies&mdash;grant us a few years of happiness and
  love! And if this prayer be not granted, if my Lodöiska must mount the
  scaffold, may I soon learn it so that I can follow her to the sphere where
  thou reignest to meet my wife once more and behold thee again!"</p>

  <p>When the exhausted, wretched man read over this paragraph again, he saw
  how it might impress others&mdash;as the delirium of fanaticism; but he
  refused to abandon his sole possession, his enthusiasm, and, taking up his
  pen again wrote:</p>

  <p>"I have read again the above sentences and I do not disguise from myself
  that many people will say they express fanaticism. Fanaticism be it, then; it
  is not cold men who do great things&mdash;he was also a fanatic, the young
  man&mdash;ah, I regret that I do not know his name! who when he saw the
  beautiful Corday enter prison, offered to take her place and suffer her
  punishment. I need not add that the <i>Cordeliers</i> granted only half his
  request; they did not long allow him to survive the woman for whom he would
  have died."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In La Force Adam Lux waited, tranquil in the autumn sunshine, the October
  winds stripping the trees, casting the leaves at his feet as he paced with
  his Rousseau and his Plutarch, detached from the world.</p>

  <p>The atrocious tortures of the Queen of France were drawing to a close;
  Hébert, whose base venom had been exercised on Charlotte de Corday and Madame
  Roland, slandered the daughter of the Caesars with insinuations so vile that
  even that tribunal recoiled; in the middle of the month Adam Lux learned that
  the Austrian Queen had, with every circumstance of horror, and with imperial
  fortitude, bowed beneath the knife that had slain Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>Preparations were made for the trial of the twenty-two <i>Girondists</i>
  who since June had been in prison. Adam Lux hoped that he might be tried with
  them; Jean-Pierre Brissot de Warville, <i>le roi Brissot</i>, who in '89 had
  seemed such a fiery revolutionary, who had been for long the leader of the
  <i>Gironde</i>, so that members of the Right had been named
  <i>Brissotins</i>, had fled to Chartres, his seat, but had been captured and
  was to share the fate of his colleagues; he had been the object of the
  special hatred of the <i>Mountain</i> and the special focus for the obscene
  furies of <i>Père Duchêne</i>.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux and Madame Roland were moved at the same time to the
  <i>Conciergerie</i>, which had sheltered the last days of Mlle. de Corday,
  and the young German found an opportunity to pass to the woman whom he so
  admired a letter from Champagneux still in La Force.</p>

  <p>He exchanged a few words with Madame Roland, who, in her reply to
  Champagneux, described him as "an excellent man"; he, on his side, paid
  tribute to this Cornelia, this Roman matron, whose beauty, courage and spirit
  were worthy of an antique heroine.</p>

  <p>Neither Adam Lux, who had been their close companion in prison, nor
  Roland's wife, was called as a witness at the trial of the doomed
  <i>Girondists</i>; events pressed one on the other with hideous
  rapidity&mdash;"years in twenty-four hours," Madame Roland had said. The
  Terror flowed over France, which was no other than "a field of carnage where
  the populace devoured one another." Collot d'Herbois, Fouché and Couthon
  carried fire and sword into the provinces, at Caen, at Marseilles, at
  Bordeaux, the guillotine was set up; there was haste, even to die; the
  millionaire renegade Bourbon, Louis d'Orléans, condemned to the knife, begged
  that he might suffer before evening; the flatterer of Marat was flung into
  the ditch beside Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>On October 31st the twenty-two appeared before the Revolutionary Tribunal:
  Brissot de Warville, Pierre Vergniaud, Armand Gensonné, Fonfrède, Ducos,
  Charles-Eléonore Valadé, who had sworn not to die by the hands of an
  underling, La Source, the Marquis de Sillery, husband of that passionate
  disciple of Rousseau, who, as Madame de Genlis, had been the mistress of
  Orléans, Gardien, Carra, Lauze Deperret, compromised by his relations with
  Charlotte de Corday and Madame Roland, Duprat, the poor enthusiastic priest
  Fauchet, whom Charlotte de Corday "despised," Beauvais, Duchâtel, Mainvielle,
  Lacaze, Boileau, Lehardy, Antiboul and Vigée.</p>

  <p>Sixty-three deputies, belonging to the Right and the <i>Marais</i>,
  protested against the judgment of these innocent men; they were themselves
  arrested.</p>

  <p>With a proud and stoic bearing the doomed deputies faced the tribunal, the
  quaker-like Brissot, worn, haggard, but calm, in a threadbare black coat that
  hardly covered him, came last but one. He had always led a Spartan life, of
  poverty and hard work, and had no fault but enthusiasm for abstract ideals
  and harshness in judging the faults of others.</p>

  <p>The golden voice of Pierre Vergniaud was raised for the last time in
  public; it was soon silenced; La Source flung out at his judges as he was
  hustled out&mdash;"I lose my head when the country has gone mad, you will
  lose yours when she recovers her reason."</p>

  <p>Pierre Vergniaud, with his lazy grand manner, stood elegantly at ease as
  the death sentence was being read, when he felt Valazé lean against him, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"What, are you afraid?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am dying." Valazé had concealed a knife among his papers and struck
  himself.</p>

  <p>With a last cry of defiance&mdash;"<i>Vive la République</i>"&mdash;the
  ex-deputies were hurried out; Fauchet returned to the Church, the others died
  with dignity and fortitude in that "philosophy" in which they had lived.
  Valazé's dead body was put in the cart with the others and, like them, cast
  under the knife of the guillotine; he much resembled Adam Lux.</p>

  <p>"<i>Allons au pied du grand autel!"</i> yelled a <i>Jacobin</i> in the
  Convention, <i>"voir célébrer la messe rouge!</i>"</p>

  <p>Girey-Dupré, the young journalist who had worked for Brissot and who had
  followed the fugitives to Caen, and whose gaiety had helped the sufferings of
  the wandering fugitives, rushed before the Tribunal, and declared that the
  murdered men were the equals of Aristides and Algernon Sidney, then was
  dragged, singing the hymn of his own composition, to his death. Many of the
  enthusiasts, including Louvet, wrote death songs, in readiness for their
  executions.</p>

  <p>In their miserable retreat the news of the sacrifice of the <i>Gironde</i>
  came to the fugitives lurking under the protection of Madame Bouquey.</p>

  <p>Disdaining to compromise any further their generous friend, they left
  their filthy hiding-place and separated. Louvet for Paris to find Lodöiska,
  even if he found death, Valady for Périgueux, where he was discovered and
  executed, Guadet and Salles to Montpont; finally, after prolonged miseries,
  they were arrested, sent to Bordeaux and guillotined.</p>

  <p>Barbaroux, Buzot and Pétion wandered uncertainly, vaguely, towards the
  sea; in rags, haggard, filthy, bearded, these three men, the handsome
  Provençal, with the Greek outline, the Roman look, the charming and sensitive
  Buzot, Jérôme Pétion, the orator who had been the "Messiah" of Paris,
  appeared like scarecrows, degraded as the most miserable beggars. They had
  one more misery to endure; as they crept from one hiding-place to another,
  they learned, by casual gossip, of the death of Madame Roland, news which
  threw Buzot into an agony that nearly cost him his reason.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Madame Roland, in a white gown scattered with roses, went with triumphant
  majesty to her death, proud without arrogance, tranquil without bravado; she
  had generously refused the advocacy of Claude-François Chauveau-Lagarde, who
  had defended Charlotte de Corday and the Queen, and died in disdain of her
  judges. She was compared to that other fair victim&mdash;the beautiful
  matron, warm and tender, the lovely virgin, cold and chaste&mdash;they
  seemed, with delicate features and blond locks, like sisters.</p>

  <p>"It is the second edition of Charlotte de Corday," remarked the press,
  furious at the fortitude of these two women. "Where do these wretches find
  their courage?"</p>

  <p>In the <i>Conciergerie</i> Adam Lux still lingered, imploring death in
  vain; a poor hairdresser, Troquart, formerly employed by the family of
  Guadet, sheltered Barbaroux, Buzot and Pétion in his humble house at
  Saint-Emilion; Guadet and Salles had been discovered with Guadet <i>père</i>;
  they were sent to the guillotine at Bordeaux, together with Guadet
  <i>père</i>, his wife, Saint-Brice Guadet, Madame Bouquey and her
  husband.</p>

  <p>In a terrible letter the third brother, an officer of distinction, sent
  the news to Louvet, who had contrived to reach Paris and was in hiding with
  his faithful wife.</p>

  <p><i>"Citizen, you asked me for some details of the deputies who were with
  you in the grottoes of Saint-Emilion, I can only imperfectly satisfy your sad
  impatience. I was, far from all these events, at Sainte-Dominique, where I
  was fighting the enemies of the Republic. After my return to France I have
  been in that unhappy country (the Gironde) where I have learned that not one
  of them has escaped the assassins. My brother (Elie Guadet, the deputy) and
  Salles, were found, after much searching, in my father's house. They were
  taken to Bordeaux, where they perished with all my family. Pétion, Buzot and
  Barbaroux were hidden in a house</i> (Troquart's in Saint-Emilion). <i>The
  house-to-house visits being made by the police, forced them to fly; they
  gained the suburbs of Castillon, where they were pursued. They made a frugal
  repast, which was their last. Barbaroux, believing it impossible to escape,
  tried to blow out his brains; Pétion and Buzot tried to turn the ball which
  wounded him severely. Several people, attracted by the shot, came up and
  recognised him; he was taken to Castillon, then to Bordeaux, where he
  finished his existence. Soon after, Buzot and Pétion, reduced to the last
  extremities, destroyed themselves sooner than fall into the hands of these
  monsters avid for their blood. All those who gave them an asylum at
  Saint-Emilion have perished; they even took to the scaffold everyone who
  chanced to be in my father's house when the refugees were found
  there.</i></p>

  <p><i>"The citizeness Bouquet [sic], her husband, her unhappy father, have
  all been sacrificed. Nothing but ashes can now be found of those estimable
  families who were proud to furnish the first defenders of the Republic. They
  have slain my two brothers, one of whom had contributed to our victories on
  the Rhine, and the other of whom by his eloquence, his wisdom, his energy,
  prepared, founded the Republic, and by his virtues supported it. They have
  slain my father and my mother, at the age of seventy years, who were guilty
  of nothing but of sheltering their innocent son, who would have been the prop
  and honour of their old age. Of all my family, I alone remain. The memoirs of
  Barbaroux, Pétion and Buzot have been taken to the Military Commission,
  where, most likely, every care will be taken to see that they do not come to
  the light of day. But...</i></p>

  <p><i>"Signed, Guadet,<br>
  "Chef de Bataillon au 10e régiment.<br>
  21 Ventôse, III année républicaine."</i></p>

  <p>Some obscurity hangs over the fate of the three refugees and it is
  possible that Colonel Guadet was not accurately informed as to details of
  their miserable ends, of which only the following facts are known.</p>

  <p>Hearing that there was to be a house-to-house search by the police in
  Saint-Emilion, the three ex-deputies left their shelter with Troquart, taking
  no provisions beyond a morsel each of bread and meat.</p>

  <p>Stumbling across the fields of Médoc, they came upon a village fair where
  they believed themselves recognised.</p>

  <p>They escaped into a pine wood, where Charles Barbaroux, who had kept his
  pistol, shot himself in the face. The wound was not mortal, he was seized and
  taken to Bordeaux, where that noble head that Madame Roland had found of an
  antique beauty, that had pleased Charlotte de Corday, and overawed the
  Tribunal, was shown mutilated, disfigured, severed from the body, to the
  jeering crowd in the market place.</p>

  <p>Pétion and Buzot, starving, in despair, wandered across the fields, where
  their bodies, half devoured by wolves, were found a few days after their
  flight from Saint-Emilion. They may have died of exposure, from suicide, or
  from an attack by wild animals.</p>

  <p>When, for the last time, they had left the shelter of Madame Bouquey's
  house, they had enclosed their <i>Mémoires</i>, a few letters, and the play
  on Charlotte de Corday, in a metal box, which had been concealed in a ditch
  or cesspool.</p>

  <p>The police who had arrested the Bouqueys had found this box, and seeing
  that the contents were of no political interest, handed them over to
  Marc-Antoine Jullien, a boy of nineteen, one of the fiercest lieutenants of
  Robespierre, who, Commissioner of Public Safety at Saint-Emilion, had nosed
  out and betrayed the fugitives.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A few days after the death of his wife, Roland stabbed himself to the
  heart on the public way. There was a void round Adam Lux; he was alone amid
  his enemies; on November 2nd he was formally accused by Fouquier-Tinville of
  having tried to foment civil war by his writings, of having suggested Roland
  as a Dictator, of having abused the Club of the <i>Jacobins</i>&mdash;"this
  palladium of the Republic"&mdash;and of having made "a pompous apology for
  Charlotte de Corday" and of having "mingled with this panegyric of the
  assassin of Marat a delirium of tenderness for this execrable monster and a
  desire to join her in the celestial spheres."</p>

  <p>Adam Lux received this written accusation coolly.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said to his fellow-prisoners, when it was delivered to him, "is
  my death-warrant&mdash;the representative of a town that wished to give
  itself to France will be sent to the scaffold. At twenty-eight years of age I
  shall finish a miserable life&mdash;to-morrow or the day after I shall be
  cold as a stone. Tell those who may speak of me as worthy of death that it
  was not among Frenchmen that I ought to have met this end, which I face with
  contempt."</p>

  <p>He said farewell to Kerner&mdash;"You have had experiences that should be
  useful to yourselves and others." He had one sigh:</p>

  <p>"That I might be buried close to Rousseau, at his feet!"</p>

  <p>There was a letter to write; he had already recommended his unfortunate
  family to Jean Dumont; he now wrote to his wife, Sabine.</p>

  <p><i>"I die for Liberty and if Liberty triumphs the French nation will not
  forget the wife and children of Adam Lux. Console yourself, dear heart, what
  can man do against destiny? A chance accident might have killed me and
  Liberty would not have been served, as it is, at least I die with honour and
  this re flexion will certainly console you; you will weep my loss, but you
  will feel that it honours you. I cannot help you to educate our daughters, I
  leave them my sentiments, my life and my death, you will know how one day to
  make them value such a legacy. I give them my paternal benediction, it will
  not be lost on them. Dear Sabine, in a few days I shall be nearer to you than
  I have been these six months, for my spirit, delivered from its earthly body,
  will not delay to join you and our dear children and I shall see you, though
  you, with mortal eyes, will not see me. Very often I shall descend from the
  dwellings of the immortal gods to visit you&mdash;what a joy to behold our
  dear daughters grow in wisdom and innocence until the time that we, after all
  these trials, shall be united again."</i></p>

  <p>Adam Lux entrusted this letter and one to his old friend, Nicolas Vogt, to
  his jailers, who delivered them to the Tribunal. They were never sent to
  Germany, but thrown into the <i>dossier</i> of Adam Lux with this comment by
  the translator: "These letters reveal nothing but a head full of fantasy, a
  man ready to die and full of moral energy."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On November 4th Adam Lux appeared again before the Tribunal; he had said
  farewell to his fellow-prisoners and given his cloak to one of the poorest of
  these unfortunates.</p>

  <p>Intrepid, tranquil and stately in his demeanour, the young German, neatly
  dressed in the summer clothes too light for this season, faced his judges,
  his heavy fair hair falling on his square shoulders, his bloodshot eyes
  steadfast.</p>

  <p>Again he was asked by the Vice-President Dumas:</p>

  <p>"Why did you wish to kill yourself?"</p>

  <p>"To be free."</p>

  <p>"Did you have relations with Guadet and Pétion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How do you regard Roland?"</p>

  <p>"As a virtuous man."</p>

  <p>"In this brochure, <i>Charlotte Corday</i>, you express your opinion that
  the assassin of Marat is greater than Brutus."</p>

  <p>"So I believe."</p>

  <p>"You did not write it yourself, you are sheltering others."</p>

  <p>"It is entirely my own work, I alone was responsible for printing it."</p>

  <p>"Who was the printer?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to say. I will compromise no one."</p>

  <p>Lescot-Fleuriat read the act of accusation, the prisoner's advocate,
  Guillot, said a few formal words in his defence.</p>

  <p>He was condemned to death for offences against the sovereignty of the
  people.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything to say?" demanded Dumas.</p>

  <p>"I submit to your sentence."</p>

  <p>The late autumn day was darkening down; lamps were being lit in the
  corridors of the <i>Palais de Justice</i> as Adam Lux was taken back to the
  prison to await the tumbril.</p>

  <p>Kerner and Forster followed in the press, as Adam Lux had followed the
  cart that bore Charlotte de Corday to the same destination. At five o'clock
  the last twilight had faded; the guillotine was lit by the flare of torches,
  which cast a ragged light on the faces of the crowd who peered between the
  soldiers and the pikes to see who this was&mdash;this foreigner who was dying
  for Charlotte de Corday. A dun haze rose from the river, the air was
  piercing, but Adam Lux did not shiver as he mounted the narrow steps of the
  scaffold and saw the rigid outlines of the guillotine against the obscure
  sky.</p>

  <p>"He goes up as if he mounted the tribunal to speak," said Kerner.</p>

  <p>"He is throwing himself on death&mdash;he is running to it," said
  Forster.</p>

  <p>Adam Lux was triumphant; his coolness was incredible to those who stood
  by; he would have embraced his executioners, but his hands were tied; he
  smiled at his friends, he glanced up at something above and beyond the fog
  and stench of Paris; he was cast on the plank. His fair head fell into the
  basket, and these three disciples of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the young
  gentlewoman from Normandy, the German student from the Rhine, the Sardinian
  quack from Geneva, had destroyed one another, like errant stars darting from
  their courses and meeting to annihilate one another's light then falling
  together in ashes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

  <h3>Echoes</h3>

  <p style="text-align:center"><b>ALBERTINE MARAT</b></p>

  <p>The echoes were not still for twenty-five, for fifty years; brilliant and
  terrible as lightning, memories of these three, Marat, Lux, Charlotte de
  Corday, remained in the hearts of three old women.</p>

  <p>Half a century after she had been called to Paris by the murder of her
  brother, Albertine Marat lived in an attic in the <i>rue de la Barilerie</i>,
  earning her living by making watch-hands and the finest jewellery. Gaunt,
  severe, of simple life and manners, with something formidable in her reserve,
  the old woman resided alone amid her relics of her brother, jealously and
  tenderly guarded. For over thirty years her companion had been Simonne
  Evrard, who called herself <i>la veuve</i> Marat; from their poor garret the
  two women could see the <i>Palais de Justice</i>, where Charlotte de Corday
  had faced her judges.</p>

  <p>In 1824 Simonne died and Albertine Marat lived solitary, enclosed with her
  memories. She alone preserved the cult of Marat, which had once been like a
  frenzy in France; her miserable lodging was a shrine to his honour, her life
  of labour and poverty was barren of everything but devotion to a dead
  man.</p>

  <p>Everyone else had forgotten Marat, or only remembered him with contempt or
  horror; an Empire, a Kingdom, had come and gone, but Albertine Marat, weary
  after her day's toil, still lit her candle and gazed at her precious
  treasures. The son of Philippe <i>Egalité</i> was on the throne of France,
  very few of those whom this old woman had known in 1793 survived; all Marat's
  friends, supporters, toadies had perished; the guillotine had accounted for
  Danton, Robespierre, Desmoulins, Hébert, Couthon, Saint-Just,
  Fouquier-Tinville, Barère, and so many others whose names she could not even
  remember; she looked back on those days across years of war, of falling
  dynasties. Enemies were dead, as well as friends; André Chénier, who had sung
  Charlotte de Corday, had himself been beheaded; Louvet, sole survivor of the
  proscribed <i>Girondists</i>, had died a few years after the fall of
  Robespierre, of illness brought on by his perils and exposures.</p>

  <p>Marat had been in the <i>Panthéon</i> only a year; in February, 1795, the
  Convention had decreed that no citizen should have immortal honours until he
  had been dead ten years; the following day, to the great agony of Simonne and
  Albertine, the busts of Marat and other patriots, the two pictures of David
  showing the death of Marat and Lepelletier, were removed from the chamber,
  leaving the bust of Brutus in solitary glory.</p>

  <p>A Royalist journalist reprinted an extract from an early work by Marat,
  which showed him as a firm believer in monarchy; a pamphlet promptly
  appeared: <i>Les Crimes de J. P. Marat</i>. The grotesque monument with the
  bath was demolished; busts and statues of Marat were hurled from their places
  by the mob; in many cases the bust of Rousseau took the place of the friend
  of the people. In the court of the Jacobins Marat was burnt in effigy, and
  the ashes, stuffed into a chamber-pot, hurled into the sewers with cries of
  <i>"Voilà ton Panthéon, Marat!"</i></p>

  <p>Albertine and Simonne were without means; a <i>Maratiste</i> had given
  them a small income of fifty <i>livres</i> yearly; for the rest they toiled
  with their hands. They could not afford to claim the body of their idol, now
  so cruelly overthrown; when it was taken out of the <i>Panthéon</i> it was
  buried, in a leaden shell, in the cemetery of <i>Sainte Geneviève</i>.</p>

  <p>Even this resting-place had not been permanent; Albertine had seen the
  cemetery turned into gardens, streets and houses; she did not know where her
  brother's bones had been flung; she had also seen the same oblivion cover the
  sepulchre of Charlotte de Corday; the cemetery of the Madeleine had been
  closed in 1794. No one knew where the remains of Marat's assassin lay;
  Albertine had seen half the city rebuilt; the <i>hôtel de la Providence</i>
  was demolished; all the streets which bore any allusion to the Revolution had
  been renamed; the great square where the guillotine had stood was called
  <i>Place de la Concorde</i>.</p>

  <p>Albertine's heart was unchanged; passionately, the stern, swarthy old
  woman dedicated herself to the cult of her brother, to her still a hero, a
  demi-god&mdash;"a martyr to Liberty."</p>

  <p>She had collected with passionate zeal every relic of Marat that she could
  acquire and preserved them through every pinch of grim poverty; she had the
  MS. of a novel, <i>Comte Potowski</i>, written in the style of Rousseau in
  Marat's youth, the proof-sheets that Marat had been correcting in his bath
  when he was struck, a collection of prints and busts of her brother, his
  <i>Political Works</i> in twelve volumes, all the numbers of <i>L'Ami du
  peuple</i> annotated by the editor's own hand, two miniatures of Marat by
  Bosio, mounted prisms, a microscope, his case of medical instruments, a
  package of papers.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the curious, the amateurs of history and of art would seek out
  Albertine Marat, to gaze at these relics of strange, dead times, to persuade
  her to talk of the days of the Terror.</p>

  <p>She was taciturn and would tell nothing; but when she felt her strength
  ebbing with extreme old age, she sent for a young democrat of the day,
  Raspail, and showing him her poor treasury, told him she would make him heir
  to these precious relics.</p>

  <p>"I am the sister of Marat, I follow his cult, I wish this garret to be his
  <i>Panthéon</i>. He always remains dear to me, reverence for him has never
  left my breast&mdash;pray accept and cherish these <i>souvenirs</i> of a
  great man."</p>

  <p>Raspail was moved by the poverty of the garret and of the proud old woman
  around whom such echoes whispered; he promised to return, but the next day he
  was arrested at Nantes. When he returned to Paris he could not trace
  Albertine Marat nor her relics. She had become too infirm to work at watches
  or jewellery and one by one her beloved relics were sold to the curious and
  the compassionate.</p>

  <p>In the month of November, 1841, she died, with two humble neighbours as
  her sole friends, aged eighty-three, in the most utter poverty.</p>

  <p>She was buried in a pauper's grave; a stranger paid <i>6 francs</i> for a
  wooden cross to be placed for a year above her grave.</p>

  <p>With the stilling of this firm heart, this loyal spirit, the echoes of
  Marat's life and death faded into silence.</p>
  <hr>

  <p style="text-align:center"><b>APOLLONIA-TERESA LUX</b></p>

  <p>In Darmstadt lived another old woman, enclosed with her memories; she also
  was a pauper and lived in the alms-houses provided for the worthy poor of the
  city; friendless and alone, she had, even in her eightieth year, an air of
  pride and distinction.</p>

  <p>Across fifty years, across seventy years came to her the echoes of Adam
  Lux; she was his second daughter. Her mother, Sabine Reuter, had died of
  typhus in 1814, faithful to the memory of her husband, whom she always
  praised and admired; soon after her death, the eldest sister was involved in
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>The youngest child had died soon after her father and there were thus only
  Maria Anna and Apollonia-Teresa left out of the little family that Adam Lux
  had parted from so joyously in 1793.</p>

  <p>Enthusiastic, solitary, dreamy, Maria Anna at twenty-five years of age
  read with the deepest excitement the poem by Jean-Paul Richter, in which he
  celebrated Charlotte de Corday and Adam Lux.</p>

  <p>She wrote to the author a letter full of exaltation and mysticism; when no
  answer came she attempted suicide; Apollonia restrained her and two letters
  from Richter slightly consoled the daughter of Adam Lux.</p>

  <p>Her sister married and she was left alone. Richter sent her a lock of his
  hair and asked for a meeting, but Maria Anna was resolute not to belong to
  this world; even this lofty romance was more than her fragile spirit could
  endure. One May night she threw herself into the Rhine; rescued while yet
  alive, she sternly refused all assistance; she declared that she had seen the
  lights of eternity, heard celestial music, and that she would not return to
  earth.</p>

  <p>She was placed in bed, as she had asked, with her crucifix and her open
  Bible; they thought she slept and left her; when they returned she was dead,
  several hours after she had been taken from the river.</p>

  <p>This echoed in the reserved heart of the old woman in Darmstadt, faintly,
  wistfully&mdash;it had been so long ago; she had had a lifetime of
  unhappiness herself, a wretched marriage, poverty, an old age reliant on
  charity. But as she grew older she saw the gulf of time spanned and there was
  present to her failing wits the picture of the young father, whom she had
  never seen, running to the guillotine in the twilight Paris square, for the
  sake of Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>She had no picture of him, no relic, the echoes grew very faint; when her
  eyes closed at last and she was taken to her pauper's grave, the last whisper
  of life and death had faded into nothingness.</p>
  <hr>

  <p style="text-align:center"><b>MARJOTTE</b></p>

  <p>Twenty-five, fifty years, and the echoes were still heavy over the Norman
  meadows, in the deserted chambers of farms and <i>châteaux</i>. Here nothing
  had changed, the leaves were thick on the chestnut trees, the blossom white
  on the hawthorn hedges, the lilies unfolding on the home pond; the modest
  house where Charlotte de Corday d'Armont was born stood unaltered; there was
  no change in the lonely church where she was christened, where, on holiday
  from the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, she would take the Holy Sacrament.</p>

  <p>In the old bakehouse where Mlle. de Corday had gathered her children for
  their lessons, a woman of eighty-two had made her dwelling; a few chairs, a
  plank bed were the sole furnishing, the huge, unused oven served as cupboard
  and table; a high-placed window gave a soft light; all was very clean and
  decent; it was Fanchon Marjot, this little old woman, bent over her spinning
  wheel, muttering to herself, Marjotte, since she was fifteen years old, in
  the service of the noble family of Corday.</p>

  <p>She had done her duty; thanks to her bravery and prudence, M. de Corday de
  Cauvigny had escaped the furies of the Revolution, had died peacefully in his
  <i>château</i>. But it was the grand-daughter whom she remembered most
  clearly; sunk in a stupor she dreamed of her bright young mistress; it was in
  order to evoke this image more clearly that she had returned to
  Mesnil-Imbert, to the old <i>fournil</i>.</p>

  <p>The curious questioned her in her pathetic retreat.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember Charlotte de Corday?"</p>

  <p>The old woman was like one returned to life; at the sound of that name,
  her memories flowed into words.</p>

  <p>"A child, a young maiden," that was how Marjotte always saw Charlotte de
  Corday&mdash;with her chestnut gold hair&mdash;"like a fleece."</p>

  <p>Laughing with pleasure the old servant counted out the golden memories;
  "she was so serious, so modest, so gentle&mdash;and then, suddenly, a madcap!
  Such pleasure in her games! <i>la gaité folle!</i> One had to leave
  everything to play with her!"</p>
  <hr>

  <p style="text-align:center"><i>ALEXANDRINE DE FORBIN D'OPPEDE</i></p>

  <p>In Italy, in France, a pious ex-nun laboured among the poor, in the
  hospitals, in the prisons until her health failed. She was Madame de
  Millière, formerly the Alexandrine de Forbin whose cause Charlotte de Corday
  had recommended in her letter to Charles Barbaroux.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she too was questioned as to whether the echoes of many years
  ago came down to her&mdash;if she remembers Charlotte de Corday, her
  fellow-pupil at the <i>abbaye-aux-dames</i>, her girlhood's friend.</p>

  <p>But the saintly woman would not take this name upon her lips, would not
  easily hear it mentioned; before her implacable piety all echoes fail.</p>

  <p>Of all the old women who remember, Madame de Millière alone maintains
  silence. Without comment the ex-canoness of Troarn allows the life and death
  of Charlotte de Corday to pass into the steadfast twilight of immortal
  legend.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

  <p class="first">The lives of Charlotte de Corday and J. P. Marat are
  extremely well documented; a large mass of contemporary material has been
  carefully and judiciously collected, annotated and classified by zealous
  experts, so that it is now possible to trace, with considerable exactitude,
  the whole careers of these two people; a bibliography of all the works
  written round them would compose a small volume in itself. Adam Lux has been
  less extensively treated; though passing allusions to his death are common;
  his character and life have not been subject to the voluminous treatment
  given to Charlotte de Corday and J. P. Marat; there is, however, no
  difficulty in reconstructing the man and his brief career.</p>

  <p>Among the many admirable writers who have put all subsequent workers on
  this subject into their debt, special gratitude must be accorded to the
  labours of C. Vatel, G. Lenôtre, Cheron de Villiers, Dr. Cabanès and
  Decauville-Lachenée.</p>

  <p>Memoirs, letters, newspapers and legal documents relating to the events of
  1793 exist in abundance; the most important of the first of these are given
  in the brief bibliography that follows this note. The memoirs of the
  <i>Girondists</i>, written while hidden in the <i>grottes de
  Saint-Emilion</i>, appear to have passed into the hostile hands of Saint
  Marc-Antoine Julien and to have been treated as of little value until they
  were sold, as a bundle of old papers, to a bookshop in the Quai Voltaire in
  1863; with them were the letters of Madame Roland to Buzot, the drama of
  Charlotte Corday by Salles and several notes by Charles Barbaroux.</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday's girlhood is largely known from the <i>Souvenirs</i>
  of Mme. de Maromme and from accounts collected long after her death from
  friends of her youth; as there is no discrepancy between these as to the
  appearance, character and behaviour of Mlle. de Corday, no question of their
  general accuracy arises.</p>

  <p>The above particulars are written in order that the reader of my study of
  this remarkable woman that it is <i>une biographe romancée</i>; every detail
  given is either beyond dispute or attested by reliable witnesses and passed
  by competent authorities; reference to the works cited below will give the
  grounds for all the statements I have made. However, the method I have
  adopted of a straightforward narrative, advancing from sequence to sequence
  in these three lives, did not permit of debates, pros and cons, or qualified
  statements on obscure points. I did not feel this to be of much importance,
  as I had no problems to solve, no two sides of a question to give&mdash;the
  tale is clear and presents no mystery and little cause for differences of
  opinion. Here and there small difficulties arise; for instance, there is some
  uncertainty as to who was the first and who was the last of the friends taken
  leave of by Charlotte de Corday at Caen, and even as to the exact date of her
  final interview with Charles Barbaroux (July 7th or 8th); there are two
  different versions of the letter she wrote to her father before leaving
  Caen&mdash;that which I have given is in every way the more likely to be
  genuine; and there is even some possibility that she visited the Convention
  before visiting Marat. The extract from Louvet's <i>memoirs</i>&mdash;written
  under such terrible circumstances&mdash;gives us the one first-hand picture
  of Charlotte de Corday shortly before her departure for Paris&mdash;though
  written in a highly coloured style, it is no doubt accurate save for the
  detail about "the relative." Louvet seems also to have been misinformed as to
  the young man who offered to change places with her, or to have confused the
  story of Adam Lux. The actual arrest of Charlotte de Corday is variously
  related, but the differences are slight and have no bearing on the main
  event; they arise from the confusion of the witnesses in the excitement of
  the moment. The often-repeated story of her having her Plutarch with her in
  Paris does not seem to be true. Nor is there good authority for the story of
  her talk with a child in the <i>Palais-Royal</i>, or her romantic meeting
  with a young Italian in Paris. These and similar legends have not been
  repeated.</p>

  <p>On these and other small points the curious reader may consult the
  original documents and the arguments arising therefrom put forward by the
  French experts.</p>

  <p>All extracts from memoirs or letters of the trials before the Tribunal,
  all conversations, etc., have been translated by myself from the originals;
  all the sources I have used are French. All the sentiments attributed to Adam
  Lux are to be found in his writings. The estimate of Charlotte de Corday in
  Chapter Eight is from his pamphlet. In the spelling of the French names,
  which varies in different documents, Claude Déperret&mdash;Lauze Deperret or
  Du Perret, Péthion&mdash;Pétion, Bretheville&mdash;Bretteville, etc., I have
  adopted the form used by modern writers. Charlotte de Corday signed herself
  "Darmont," "Corday," and "Marie de Corday"; Marie seems to have been the
  baptismal name she was known by to her friends, but Charlotte was so
  universally used, even during the actual progress of her drama, that it would
  be pedantic not to continue to employ a name so famous, even if it be
  incorrect; I have therefore used her full title until she herself dropped
  this on the abolition of titles in 1790. In the address of Montané to the
  jury her correct name is given when she is described as "Marie-Anne-Charlotte
  Corday, <i>ci-devant</i> Darmont, ex-noble." When her name is quoted in
  extracts from contemporary Republican documents, it is given as Charlotte
  Corday&mdash;this was the title of Adam Lux's pamphlet.</p>

  <p>Lux's own name is a Latin form, adopted when he entered the University, of
  his father's name, which was probably either Licht (light) or Luchs (lynx);
  particulars of his last days are to be found in the memoirs of Champagneux
  and Georges Kerner. None of the conversations is invented; they all rest on
  first-hand reports.</p>

  <p>Exhaustive works have been devoted to the portraits of Charlotte de Corday
  and J. P. Marat; none of these is of any outstanding excellence and most take
  the form of sketches taken from memory or made by artists who had not seen
  the originals.</p>

  <p>Dr. Cabanès remarks that out of two hundred portraits of Marat he
  examined, not two were alike. The sketches taken by Hauer during the trial of
  Charlotte de Corday and in the cell lack character and life, the countless
  pictures of the woman and the event made afterwards were either deliberate
  caricatures or conventional productions; the discrepancies in costume and
  background show their inaccuracies. For instance, in the print of "The Arrest
  of Charlotte de Corday," published in 1793, the bath stands in a large
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>The dresses that Charlotte de Corday wore on her visits to Marat, the
  colour of her hair, her height, etc., have been the matter of learned
  discussion. I have read all the evidence and described her appearance and her
  clothes as they undoubtedly were; there seems no question that she was
  <i>blonde</i>, not <i>châtaine</i>, though probably she had hair with reddish
  or deep gold reflections&mdash;<i>the blond cendré</i> impression could arise
  from her habit of lightly powdering. There seems no question but that she was
  tall; the description on her passport would give the impression of a short
  woman, but apart from the likelihood that it may be inaccurate, a <i>pouce
  ancien</i> seems to have been much more than an inch, nearer the standard
  length of a man's thumb. If, however, Charlotte de Corday was only five feet
  three or four, she must have been extremely well-proportioned and had great
  dignity in her carriage, for all eye-witnesses describe her as tall; this is
  strange when we remember her habit, supposed to be common to Norman women, of
  holding her head in a drooping posture.</p>

  <p>David's picture, taken so soon after the event, of the murder of Marat, is
  probably accurate in detail; Hauer also painted this subject.</p>

  <p>There seem to be few portraits of Adam Lux extant; a silhouette is
  prefixed to the study by Borckel, <i>Adam Lux, ein Opfer der
  Schreckenszeit</i>, 1892.</p>

  <p>The extracts given before the chapters have not been chosen for any
  special merit or permanent value, but merely to illustrate the mental
  atmosphere which in late eighteenth-century France it was impossible to
  escape. To a modern mind Rousseau and his school seem intolerably
  sentimental, and the half-understood classicism that deified Brutus and
  continually quoted fabulous heroes like Marcus Curtius or Mucius Scaevola as
  examples to be followed, false and tiresome.</p>

  <p>It is, however, impossible to understand the protagonists of the French
  Revolution without realising to what a height the enthusiasm both for
  Rousseau and for Plutarch rose; the whole of the <i>Gironde</i> created an
  imaginary Sparta and Rome about themselves until they lost sight of their own
  times and their own immediate problems. Vergniaud in particular hardly opened
  his lips without a reference to some classic hero or event; Buzot and Madame
  Roland both, in their <i>mémoires</i>, speak of Rousseau and Plutarch as
  being the most powerful influence of their youth. Letters and memoirs, so
  plentiful at this period, are usually couched in the style of Rousseau or
  Raynal&mdash;a style known to English readers from Richardson and Sterne and
  the unconscious caricatures of Mackenzie. If this tearful, exalted,
  sentimental and verbose manner seems self-conscious, artificial, and even
  foolish to modern ears, it should be remembered that it was absolutely
  sincere, that many of these rhapsodies that seem now pompous, humourless and
  in bad taste were written under terrible circumstances or on the point of
  death; that the writers did know how to suffer, to sacrifice themselves for
  an ideal, to die with extraordinary courage. When the tension, the strain and
  the horror under which these people lived are remembered, and the heroism
  with which they met appalling disasters is recognised, the sentiment, often
  tiresome, and the classic virtue, often false, that supported them may seem
  allowable.</p>

  <p>It is, too, a question of idiom, superb heroism may inspire flamboyant,
  dramatic eloquence, violent action, as well as laconic stoicism. No doubt
  collective hysteria, frenzy and genuine lunacy were behind many of the deeds
  that took place in a period of anarchy unparalleled in modern history, but
  there is no questioning the complete sanity of all the members of the
  <i>Gironde</i>, of Madame Roland, of Adam Lux, to take but that small section
  of the countless actors in that mighty drama dealt with in this study. And no
  one has ever doubted the lucid intelligence, the steady judgment, the noble
  self-abnegation and rigid self-control of Charlotte de Corday. It is notable,
  also, that neither her letters nor her recorded speech shows a trace of
  either the sentimentality or the heroics then more than a fashion, a cult, a
  faith. Pupil as she was of Rousseau, Raynal and Plutarch, her language is
  that of Corneille, grand, direct, concise; she had, also, a charming humour,
  too often absent in her contemporaries. Only in her <i>addressé</i> or
  testament, written under terrible circumstances, does she adopt the
  fashionable style of the moment.</p>

  <p>To those readers who may dislike the practice, I present this excuse for
  some changes of the narrative into the historic present&mdash;some scenes
  seemed to me, as I was reconstructing them, so vivid in their actuality that
  I found it impossible to write of them as if they belonged to the past.</p>

  <p>In presenting this short list, not only of the works I have used, but
  those most likely to illuminate my subject, I may add that the brilliant
  works of Lamartine, Michelet and Mignet should always be balanced against the
  solid modern scholarship of writers like Louis Le Blanc and Louis Madelin,
  and that the hectic, impassioned contemporary letters and memoirs should
  always be checked in the light of modern research.</p>

  <p>I have included in my list the famous classic dictionary that appeared in
  the midst of the French Revolution, as this gives the conception of "antique"
  heroes and heroines common to that period (first edition, 1788&mdash;second,
  1792), and presents a conception of classicism now completely outdated. The
  old-fashioned forms of Greek and Latin names are taken from this source.</p>

  <p>One more observation: such contemporary accounts of the murder of Marat as
  mention where Charlotte de Corday hid the knife, say, <i>in her fichu</i>;
  this does not seem possible, as the fichu was of gauze, worn over a thin
  muslin dress; a heavy object that had to be concealed would certainly have
  been carried in a pocket that was strong enough to hold papers, a watch,
  etc.</p>

  <p>The following brief notes either expand points touched upon above, or give
  information impossible to embody in the narrative; they are only for the
  curious reader.</p>

  <p>All existing documents relating to Charlotte de Corday are in the National
  Collection in France or in private hands in that country; her letters have
  been several times reprinted; English translations of the letter to Charles
  Barbaroux are to be found in Mrs. Van Alstine's biography and in the English
  version of Michel Corday's book (<i>Charlotte Corday</i>), London, 1931.
  There are several relics of Charlotte Corday in the Musée Carnavalet and at
  the Musée de Versailles. In the last named is (or was till recently) David's
  picture of the <i>Death of Marat</i>. It is false in at least one
  particular&mdash;the second letter to the deputy, which he never received, is
  shown on the board that serves as desk. Even Montané seemed to be under the
  impression that Marat received this letter, which was not delivered owing to
  his death. Hauer's portrait is in this same <i>Salle de la Revolution,
  Versailles</i>. The crayon by Brard, sketched during the journey to the
  scaffold, is in the possession of the town of Caen. David's painting of the
  death of Lepeletier Saint-Fargeau was destroyed, but a drawing by this artist
  of the head of the murdered man remains; it is a strong contrast, in its
  dignity and grace, to the hideous likeness, also by David, of Marat's
  bloodless face, taken after his death; the fidelity of this last is attested
  by the similarity of the sketch to the death mask. When David was working
  from nature he was a powerful artist, his sound technique shows to better
  advantage in his drawings than in his pantings. The drawing of Saint-Fargeau
  is in the Hennin Collection, that of Marat is in the Musée Grévin. The
  <i>Typus Mundi</i> mentioned in the text may be seen in the <i>Salle
  Révolutionnaire</i> of the Musée Carnavalet.</p>

  <p>The house of Madame de Bretteville in Caen is frequently referred to as
  <i>Le Grand-Manoir</i>. This mistake seems to have originated with Lamartine;
  it was disposed of as early as 1847 by M. Desniau de Crouzilhac in an article
  in the <i>Revue de Rouen</i>, but has been since repeated; the mansion known
  as <i>le Grand Manoir</i> was situated near to Madame de Bretteville's house
  in the rue Saint-Jean which was partially rebuilt in 1852.</p>

  <p>All that is known about M. Hippolyte Bougon-Longrais, mentioned in
  Charlotte de Corday's letter to Barbaroux, is to his credit; his
  <i>Réflexions sur la Guerre</i>, published in Calvados in 1792, gained much
  applause, and he became deputy-Attorney-General of the Department of
  Calvados; a passport was issued to him on the day of Marat's murder, on which
  he is described as twenty-seven years old, fair, with blue eyes, aquiline
  nose, oval face, five feet three inches in height. He behaved with great
  moderation in his difficult position, but was obliged to fly before the
  victorious army of the Convention marching on Caen. After many adventures he
  joined the <i>Royalists</i> in the Vendée and became secretary to the
  romantic and handsome Antoine Philippe de la Trémouille, Prince de Talmont.
  After the defeat at Mans, these two young men were captured (Jan., 1794).
  Talmont was beheaded at Laval and Bougon-Longrais at Rennes. In the farewell
  letter to his mother, written on the morning of his last day, is a long
  reference to Charlotte de Corday. There is no need to doubt its sincerity,
  because it is written in the emotional style of the period:</p>

  <p><i>"If only, like my beloved Charlotte, I had been able in my last moments
  to lull myself to sleep with a sweet and deceptive illusion that peace and
  order had been restored to my country! But I cannot! I am leaving this world
  tormented by the idea that blood is going to flow in even greater torrents! O
  Charlotte Corday! O my noble and generous friend! The memory of you has never
  ceased to fill my heart and my mind. Wait for me, I am coming to you! The
  desire to avenge you has made me bear with life until this moment. But I
  think that I have now satisfied the demands of this sacred duty. I die happy
  and worthy of you."</i></p>

  <p>The Marquis de Faudoas, his sister-in-law, and his daughter Eléonore,
  friends and neighbours of Charlotte de Corday in Caen, died on the scaffold,
  July 14th, 1794; the Marquis had returned to Paris to take up his place
  beside the King. Madame Lavaillant and her daughter, other close friends of
  Charlotte de Corday, more prudent, withdrew to Rouen, the ancient capital of
  Normandy which remained one of the most peaceful places in France during the
  revolution. The latter, afterwards Madame Loyer de Maromme, left the
  <i>mémoires</i> of her famous friend; these contain some errors, and her
  account of the farewell supper party when Charlotte de Corday refused to
  drink the King's health has been doubted because the writer has confused the
  dates. She says this event took place on Sept. 29th, 1791, on the same day as
  Fauchet's entry into Caen as Constitutional Bishop. This, however, took place
  on May 11th, and Fauchet left for Paris on Sept. 28th, 1791; the anecdote
  bears the appearance of truth and probably the later date is correct and
  Fauchet was leaving Caen. All the letters (save two) Charlotte wrote to this
  friend, Madame de Maromme, at Rouen, were destroyed in fear of persecution
  after Marat's murder; the two that survived were published at the end of
  Madame Maromme's <i>mémoires</i>, published in 1862 by her relative,
  Casimir-Périer, father of the President of France. It is Madame de Maromme
  who is in part responsible for the errors which have been continually
  repeated with regard to Henry de Belzunce. His full name was Belzunce-Macaie
  and he was only a distant relative of the Abbess, Madame de Belzunce de
  Castelmoron, who died on Jan. 30th, 1787, two years before the Vicomte de
  Belzunce joined the garrison at Caen, April 1789. It is not likely he ever
  met Charlotte de Corday, but most probable that she knew of him and was
  profoundly shocked by his murder.</p>

  <p>The famous journal of Marat's editing was termed first <i>Le Publiciste
  Parisien</i> (from 12th September, 1789), then on its revival on 26th
  September, 1792, <i>L'Ami du peuple</i>, then <i>Le Journal de la
  République</i>, and lastly <i>Le Publiciste de la Republique</i>, after March
  14th, 1793. The famous title, <i>L'Ami du peuple</i>, so often applied to
  Marat himself, has been used throughout my text in order to avoid confusion
  and to follow the usage of other writers. For the same reason the famous term
  <i>Girondists</i> has been employed instead of that of <i>Brissotins</i>,
  which was in contemporary use.</p>

  <p>Gustave Doulcet de Pontécoulant, though a member of the <i>Mountain</i>,
  is supposed to have been in hiding when Charlotte de Corday named him as her
  advocate; he came forward, however, with great courage, as has been related,
  to defend himself against the charge of cowardice; he became President of the
  Convention in 1795, of the Five Hundred in the following year, Count and
  Senator of the Empire, <i>a pair de France</i>, after the restoration of the
  Bourbons, and died in 1853.</p>

  <p>Claude-François Chauveau-Lagarde, born in 1756, was a very interesting
  character; a lawyer by profession, he contrived to pass through the
  Revolution in safety, without mingling in politics, and yet he defended with
  tact and dignity many of the most famous victims of the period, Miranda,
  Brissot and Marie Antoinette, as well as Charlotte de Corday. He offered to
  defend Madame Roland, but she generously refused his services. He paid Mlle.
  de Corday's debts the day after her execution. His death took place in 1841
  and it is from the notes he took during the trial of Charlotte de Corday that
  subsequent accounts are derived.</p>

  <p>In his biography of Charlotte de Corday, M. Michel Corday, descended from
  a female cousin of his heroine, gives the following particulars of the Corday
  family:</p>

  <p>"M. de Corday d'Armont was outlawed in 1798 and died soon after at
  Barcelona.</p>

  <p>"Jacques-Adrien-Alexis de Corday, his elder son, served in the Spanish
  Army, fought in La Vendée, survived the Revolution and married in 1803 Mlle.
  Marthe de Hauvel.</p>

  <p>"Charles-Francois-Jacques the younger son, was killed at Quiberon, beside
  his uncle, M. de Corday de Glatigny.</p>

  <p>"Eléonore de Corday d'Armont died, aged thirty-six.</p>

  <p>"Charlotte de Corday's uncle and tutor, the <i>abbé</i> de Corday, fled in
  1792 to Jersey and afterwards to Winchester, returned to France and died,
  Dean of Coulibceuf, in 1825.</p>

  <p>"Madame de Bretteville died in 1799 at her estate at Verson."</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Corday, was the great-granddaughter of Pierre Corneille, not,
  as is often stated, his great-grand niece, i.e., she did not descend from
  Thomas Corneille, as some writers declare, but from Pierre Corneille's
  daughter Marie, who married Jacques de Farcey, and whose daughter, Françoise
  de Farcey, married Adrien de Corday-their son Jacques-Adrien de Corday was
  the grandfather of Charlotte de Corday.</p>

  <p>Two curious items remain to be noted; a skull purporting to be that of
  Charlotte de Corday appeared in 1840 and was exhibited in Paris, 1889. Dr.
  Cabanès has dealt with this relic and all the anecdotes appertaining to it in
  <i>Cabinet secret de l'histoire, troisième série</i>, Paris, N.D. It is not
  likely that the skull is really that of Mlle. de Corday.</p>

  <p>The M. Fauldès, who was one of the jurymen who tried Charlotte de Corday,
  was the victim in the horrible and mysterious murder of 1817, and some
  writers have tried to connect this famous crime with Mlle. de Corday. The
  story goes that Fauldès had undertaken to save Mlle. de Corday, failed, and
  was murdered in revenge twenty-four years later. Nothing could be more
  unlikely. For an excellent account of this extraordinary crime, see
  <i>L'Assassinat de M. Fualdès</i>, by Arman Praviel in the series <i>Drames
  Judiciaires d'Autrefois</i>, published by Perrin et Cie, Paris.</p>
