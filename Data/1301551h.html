<h2><a id="ch-00" name="ch-00"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The history of Frey Tomás de Torquemada is the history of the
establishment of the Modern Inquisition. It is not so much the
history of a man as of an abstract genius presiding over a
gigantic and cruel engine of its own perfecting. Of this engine
we may examine for ourselves to-day the details of the complex
machinery. Through the records that survive we may observe its
cold, smooth action, and trace in this the awful intelligence of
its architect. But of that architect himself we are permitted to
catch no more than an occasional and fleeting glimpse. It is only
in the rarest and briefest moments that he stands clearly before
us, revealed as a man of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>We see him, now fervidly urging a reluctant queen to do her
duty by her God and unsheathe the sword of persecution, now
harshly threatening his sovereigns with the wrath of Heaven when
they are in danger of relenting in the wielding of that same
sword. But in the main he must be studied, not in his actions,
but in his enactments&mdash;the emanations of his relentless
spirit. In these he is to be seen devoutly compassing evil in the
perfervid quest of good.</p>
<p>Untouched by worldly ambitions, he seems at once superhuman
and less than human. Dauntless amid execrations, unmoved by
plaudits, sublimely disdainful of temporal weal, in nothing is he
so admirable as in the unfaltering self-abnegation with which he
devotes himself to the service of his God, in nothing so terrible
and tragically deplorable as in the actual service which he
renders.</p>
<p>"His history," says Prescott, "may be thought to prove that of
all human infirmities there is none productive of more extensive
mischief to society than fanaticism."</p>
<p>To this day&mdash;four centuries after his passing&mdash;Spain
still bears the imprint of his pitiless work, and none may deny
the truth of Rosseuw St. Hilaire's indictment that, after Philip
II, Torquemada was the man who did most harm to the land that
gave him birth.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The materials for this history have been gathered from the
sources cited in the appended bibliography, to all of which the
author acknowledges his profound indebtedness. In particular,
however, are his thanks due&mdash;as must be the thanks of all
men who engage in studies of the Spanish Inquisition&mdash;to the
voluminous, succinct, and enormously comprehensive works of Juan
Antonio Llorente, a historian of unimpugned honesty and
authority, who wrote under circumstances peculiarly advantageous
and with qualifications peculiarly full.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Juan Antonio Llorente was born at Logroño in 1756, and he was
ordained priest in 1779, after a university course of Roman and
Canon law which enabled him to obtain a place among the lawyers
of the Supreme Council of Castile&mdash;i.e. the Council of the
Inquisition. Having graduated as a Doctor of Canon Law, he
discharged the duties of Vicar-General to the Bishop of
Calahorra, and later on became the Commissary of the Holy Office
in Logroño&mdash;for which it was necessary that he should prove
that he was of "clean blood," undefiled by the taint of Jew or
Moor or heretic.</p>
<p>In 1789 he was appointed Secretary-General to the Holy Office,
an appointment which took him to Madrid, where he was well
received by the King, who gave him a canonry of Calahorra.</p>
<p>A profound student of sociological questions, with leanings
towards rationalism, he provoked a certain degree of mistrust,
and when the Liberal party fell from power and dragged with it
many of those who had held offices of consequence, the young
priest found himself not only deposed, but forced to meet certain
minor charges, which resulted in his being sent into retreat in a
convent for a month as a penance.</p>
<p>Thereafter he concerned himself with educational matters until
the coming of Bonaparte's eagles into Spain. When that invasion
took place, he hailed the French as the saviours of his country,
and as a consequence found himself a member of the Assembly of
Notables convoked by Murat to reform the Spanish Government. But
most important of all, from our point of view, is the fact that
when the Inquisition was abolished, in 1809, he accepted the
charge of going through its vast archives, and he spent two years
and employed a number of amanuenses in copying or making extracts
of all that he considered of account.</p>
<p>He held various offices of importance under the French
Government, so that when this was finally expelled from Spain,
he, too, was forced to go. He sought refuge in Paris, and there
he wrote his famous "Historia Critica de la Inquisicion de
España," the crystallization of his vast researches.</p>
<p>It was a very daring thing to have done, and, thanks to the
royalist and clerical Government, he was not suffered to remain
long unpunished. He was inhibited from hearing confession or
celebrating Mass&mdash;practically unfrocked&mdash;and forbidden
to teach the Castilian language in private schools. He hit back
by publishing "The Political Portrait of the Popes," which earned
him orders to leave France immediately. He set out in December of
1822 to return to Spain, and died a few days after reaching
Madrid, killed by the rigours of the journey at his advanced
age.</p>
<p>Although his "Critical History" displays at times a certain
vehemence, in the main it is concerned with the sober
transcription of the musty records he was privileged to
explore.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The Spanish Inquisition has been the subject of much
unrestrained and exaggerated writing, expressing points of view
that are diametrically opposed. From such authors as Garcia
Rodrigo, who laud its work of purification, misrepresent its
scope, and deplore (in our own times) the extinction of that
terrible tribunal, it is a far cry indeed to such writers as Dr.
Rule, who dip their pens in the gall of an intolerance as
virulent as that which they attack.</p>
<p>The author has sought here to hold a course that is
unencumbered by religious partisanship, treating purely as a
phase of history the institution for which Torquemada was so
largely responsible. He has not written in the Catholic interest,
or the Protestant interest, or the Jewish interest, He holds the
view that on the score of intolerance it is not for Christians to
cast a stone at Jews, nor Jews at Christians, nor yet Christians
of one sect at Christians of another. Each will find in his own
history more than enough to answer for at the bar of Humanity.
And when achievement is measured by opportunity, each will
discover that he is entitled to fling at the others no reproaches
which the others are not entitled to fling at him.</p>
<p>If the Spanish Inquisition is here shown as a ruthless engine
of destruction whose wheels drip the blood of mangled
generations, yet it is very far from being implied that religious
persecution is an offence peculiar to the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>"She persecuted to the full extent of the power of her clergy,
and that power was very great. The persecution of which every
Protestant church was guilty was measured by the same rule, but
clerical influence in Protestant countries was comparatively
weak."</p>
<p>Thus Lecky, whom we quote lest any should be tempted to use
anything in these pages as a weapon of unchristian Christian
partisanship. Let any such remember that against Torquemada, who
was unfortunately well served by opportunity, may be set the
bloody-minded John Knox, who, fortunately for humanity, was not;
let him ponder the slaughter of Presbyterians, Puritans, and
Roman Catholics under Elizabeth; let him call to mind the
persecutions of the Anabaptists under Edward VI, and the
Anabaptists' own clamour for the blood of all who were not
re-baptized.</p>

<h2><a id="ch-01" name="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I. EARLY
PERSECUTIONS</h2>
<p>In an endeavour to trace the Inquisition to its source it is
not necessary to go as far back into antiquity as went Paramo;
nor yet is it possible to agree with him that God Himself was the
first inquisitor, that the first "Act of Faith" was executed upon
Adam and Eve, and that their expulsion from Eden is a proper
precedent for the confiscation of the property of heretics.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine et Progressu Sanctae
Inquisitionis," p. 588.]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to go very far back indeed; for
it is in the very dawn of Christianity that the beginnings of
this organization are to be discovered.</p>
<p>There is no more lamentable lesson to be culled from history
than that contained in her inability to furnish a single instance
of a religion accepted with unquestioning sincerity and fervour
which did not, out of those very qualities, beget intolerance. It
would seem that only when a faith has been diluted by certain
general elements of doubt, that only when a certain degree of
indifference has crept into the observance of a prevailing cult,
does it become possible for the members of that cult to bear
themselves complacently towards the members of another. Until
this comes to pass, intolerance is the very breath of religion,
and&mdash;when the power is present&mdash;this intolerance never
fails to express itself in persecution.</p>
<p>Deplorable as this is in all religions, in none is it so
utterly anomalous as in Christianity, which is established upon
tenets of charity, patience, and forbearance, and which has for
cardinal guidance its Founder's sublime admonition&mdash;"Love
one another!"</p>
<p>From the earliest days of its history, persecution has
unfailingly signalized the spread of Christianity, until to the
thoughtful observer Christianity must afford the grimmest, the
saddest&mdash;indeed, the most tragic&mdash;of all the paradoxes
that go to make up the history of civilized man.</p>
<p>Its benign gospel of love has been thundered forth in malign
hatred; its divine lesson of patience and forbearance has been
taught in murderous impatience and bloodthirsty intolerance; its
mild tenets of mercy and compassion have been ferociously
expounded with fire and sword and rack; its precepts of humility
have been inculcated with a pride and arrogance as harsh as any
that the world has known.</p>
<p>It is impossible to deny that at almost any time in the
history of Christianity the enlightened pagan of the second
century would have been justified of his stinging
gibe&mdash;"Behold how these Christians love one another!"</p>
<p>It may even be said of the earliest Christians that it was
largely through their own intolerance of the opinions and beliefs
of others that they brought upon themselves the persecutions to
which through three centuries they were intermittently subjected.
Certain it is that they were the first to disturb the toleration
which in polytheistic Rome was accorded to all religions. They
might have pursued their cult unmolested so long as they accorded
the same liberty to others. But by the vehemence with which they
denounced false all creeds but their own, they offended the
zealous worshippers of other gods, and so disturbed the peace of
the community; by denying obedience to the state in which they
dwelt, by refusing to bear arms for the Empire on the plea of
"Nolo militare; militia mea est ad Dominum!" they provoked the
resentment of the law. When driven, by the beginnings of
persecution, to assemble and celebrate their rites in secret,
this very secrecy became the cause of further and sharper
proceedings against them. Their mysteriousness evoked suspicion,
and surmise sprang up to explain it. Very soon there was levelled
against them the charge from which hardly any cult that
celebrates in secret has been exempt. It was put abroad that they
practised abominations, and that they engaged in the ritual
murder of infants. Public opinion, ever credulous where evil is
the subject, was still further inflamed against them, and fresh
and greater disorders were the result. Thus they came to be
denounced for atheism, insubordination, and subversion of public
order.</p>
<p>The severity dealt out to them by a state hitherto
indifferent&mdash;through the agnosticism prevalent in the ruling
classes&mdash;to the religious opinions of its citizens, was
dictated by the desire to suppress an element that had become
socially perturbative, rather than by any vindictiveness or
intolerance towards this new cult out of Syria.</p>
<p>Under Claudius we see the Nazarenes expelled from Rome as
disturbers of the public peace; under Nero and Domitian we see
them, denounced as <i>hostes publici</i>, suffering their first
great persecution. But that persecution on purely religious
grounds was repugnant to the Roman is shown by the conduct of
Nerva, who forbade delations and oppressions on the score of
belief, and recalled the Christians who had been banished. His
successor, the just and wise Trajan, provoked perhaps by the
fierce insurrection of the Jews which occurred in his reign,
moved against the Nazarenes at first, but later on afforded them
complete toleration. Similarly were they unmolested by the
accomplished Adrian, who, indeed, so far approved of their creed
as to have notions of including Christ in the Roman Pantheon; and
they were left in peace by his successor Antoninus,
notwithstanding that the last was so attached to the faith of his
country and to the service of the gods as to have earned for
himself the surname of Pius.</p>
<p>With the accession of the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius,
who was rendered hostile to the new doctrine not only by his own
stoical convictions, but also because politically he viewed the
Christians with disfavour, came the next great persecution; and
persecution was their portion thereafter for some sixty years,
under four reigns, until the accession of Alexander Severus in
the third decade of the third century of the Christian era.</p>
<p>Alexander's mother, Julia Mannea, is believed to have been
instructed in the new doctrine by Origen, the Alexandrian,
although her conversion to Christianity and her ideas upon it do
not appear to be greatly in advance of those of Adrian, for she
is said to have included an image of Christ in the group of
beneficent deities set up in her <i>lararium</i>.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Possibly the images of the Saviour
prevalent in the third century may have contributed to the
apparent fitness of this. For at this epoch&mdash;and for some
three hundred years after&mdash;these images embodied the Greek
ideas of divinity; they represented Christ as a youth of superb
grace and beauty, and they appear largely to have been founded
upon the conceptions of Orpheus. Indeed, in one representation
which has survived, we see Him as a beardless adolescent, seated
upon a mountain, grasping an instrument with whose music he has
charmed the wild beasts assembled below. Another picture in the
catacombs (included in the illustrations of Didron's
"Iconographie Chrétienne"), representing Him as the Good
Shepherd, depicts a vigorous youth, beardless and with short
hair, in a tunic descending to the knees; His left hand
supporting a lamb which is placed across His shoulders, His right
holding a shepherd's pipe.<br>
<br>
That such pictures were not accepted as portraits by the fathers,
but merely as idealistic representations, is clear from the
disputes which arose in the second century (and were still alive
in the eighteenth) on the subject of Christ's personal
appearance. St. Justin argued that to render His sacrifice more
touching He must have put on the most abject of human shapes; and
St. Cyril, also holding this view, uncompromisingly pronounced
Him "the ugliest of the sons of men." But others, imbued with the
old Greek notions that beauty was in itself a mark of divinity,
protested: "If He is not beautiful, then He is not God."<br>
<br>
St. Augustine formally states that no knowledge existed in his
day (the fourth century) of the features of either the Saviour or
His Mother: "Nam et ipsius Dominicse facies carnis,
innumerabilium cogitationum diversitate vatiatur et fingitur,
quae tamen una erat, quaecumque erat...Neque enim novimus faciem
Virginis Mariae. Nee novimus omnino, nee credimus" ("De
Trinitate," lib. viii. cap. 4).<br>
<br>
It is clear, therefore, that the two miraculous portraits were
not known in St. Augustine's time&mdash;i.e. the Veronica, or the
Holy Face (which is preserved at St. Peter's, Rome), and another
portrait of similar origin, which it was alleged Christ had,
Himself, impressed upon a cloth and sent to Abgarus, Prince of
Edessa (as related by St. John of Damascus, in the eighth
century). To preserve it, Abgarus glued the cloth upon wood, and
thus it came later to Constantinople and thence to Rome, where it
is still believed to be treasured in the Church of St. Sylvester
in Capite.<br>
<br>
These portraits, and still more a letter purporting to have been
written to the Roman Senate by Lentulus (who was pro-consul in
Judea before Herod) and believed to have been forged to combat
the generally repugnant theory that Christ was ugly and deformed
("sine decore et specie "), supply the materials for the
representations with which we are to-day familiar. That letter
contained the following description:<br>
<br>
"At this time there appeared a man who is still living and who is
gifted with great power. His name is Jesus Christ. His disciples
call him the Son of God; others consider him a mighty
prophet...He is tall of stature and his countenance is severe and
full of power, so that to look upon him is to love and to fear
him. The hair of his head is of the colour of wine; as far as the
roots of the ears it is dull and straight, but from the ears to
the shoulders it is curled and glossy; from the shoulders it
falls over the back, divided into two parts, after the manner of
the Nazarenes. His brow is pure and level; his countenance is
without blemish and delicately tinted; his expression is gentle
and gracious; his nose and mouth are of perfect beauty; his beard
is copious, of the colour of his hair, and forked. His eyes are
blue and extremely bright. His face is of marvellous grace and
majesty. None has ever seen him laugh, but rather weeping. Erect
of body, he has long, straight hands and beautiful arms. In
speech he is grave and weighty, and sparing of words. He is the
most beautiful of the sons of men (Pulcherrimus vultu inter
homines satos)."<br>
<br>
It is clear, however, that there was no knowledge either of this
description or of the miraculous portraits mentioned as late as
the fourth and fifth centuries, during which Christ continued to
be represented as the lithe, beardless adolescent. And it is no
doubt by these representations that Michelangelo was inspired to
present Christ in "The Last Judgment" in a manner so unusual and
startling to modern eyes.<br>
<br>
Similarly there were no portraits of the Virgin Mary, and it is
fairly established that none came into existence until after the
Council of Ephesus, and that some seven pictures attributed to
St. Luke&mdash;four of which are in Rome&mdash;are the work of an
eleventh-century Florentine painter named Luca.<br>
<br>
Whilst on the subject it may be added that the crucifix, as the
emblem of Christianity, was not introduced until the seventh
century, when it was established by the Quinisexte Council at
Constantinople. Its nature rendered its earlier adoption
dangerous, if not impossible; since&mdash;as the familiar Roman
gallows&mdash;it was liable to provoke the scorn and derision of
the people.<br>

<p>For twenty years the Christians now knew peace and enjoyed the
fullest liberty. Upon that followed a period of severe
oppression, initiated by Decius, continued by Valerian and
Aurelian, and reaching something of a climax under Diocletian, in
the dawn of the fourth century, when the Christians endured the
cruellest and most ferocious of all these persecutions. But the
end of their sufferings was at hand, and with the accession of
Constantine in 312 a new era began for Christianity. Constantine,
upheld by the Christians as their saviour, in admitting the
inevitable predominance which the new religion had obtained in
rather less than three hundred years, was compelled to recognize
the rights of its votaries not only to existence but to
authority.</p>
<p>Legends surround the history of this emperor. The most popular
relates how, when he was marching against Maxentius, his rival
for the throne, desponding in the consciousness of his own
inferior force, there appeared at sunset a fiery cross in the
heavens with the inscription <b>EN TOTTO NIKA</b>&mdash;IN THIS
SIGN YOU CONQUER. And it is claimed that as a consequence of this
portent, whose injunction he obeyed, he sought instruction in
Christianity, was baptized and made public avowal of that faith.
Others maintain that he was reared in Christianity by his mother,
St. Helena&mdash;she who made an expedition to the Holy Land to
recover the true cross, and who is said to have built the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem; whilst others still assert
that Constantine did not receive baptism until at the point of
death, and that throughout his life, whilst undoubtedly favouring
Christians, he continued in the pagan religion in which he had
been educated by his father.</p>
<p>The truth probably lies midway. During the early years of his
reign Constantine not only pursued a middle course, according
religious liberty to all sects, but, himself, whilst leaning
strongly towards Christianity, retained his imperial dignity of
High-priest of the polytheistic Roman cult, and the title
"Pontifex Maximus," which later&mdash;together with so much else
of pagan origin&mdash;was appropriated by the Christians and
bestowed upon their chief bishop. But in 313-14 he refused to
celebrate the <i>ludi seculares</i>, and in 330 he issued an
edict forbidding temple-worship, whilst the Christian Council of
Nicaea, in 325, was held undoubtedly under his auspices.</p>
<p>From the very moment that the new religion found itself
recognized and invested not only with civil rights but actually
with power, from the very moment that the Christian could rear
his head and go openly and unafraid abroad, from that very moment
do we find him engaging in persecutions against the votaries of
other cults&mdash;against pagan, Jew, and heretic. For although
Christianity was but in the beginning of the fourth century of
its existence, not only had it spread irresistibly and mightily
in spite of the repressive measures against it, but it was
already beginning to know dismemberment and divisions in its own
body. Indeed, it has been computed that the number of schisms in
the fourth century amounted to no less than ninety.</p>
<p>Of these the most famous is that of Arius, a priest of
Alexandria, who denied that Christ was God Incarnate, accounting
Him no more than divinely inspired, the first and the highest of
the sons of men. Although already denounced by the Synod that met
at Alexandria in 321, so great had been the spread of this
doctrine that the Oecumenical Council of Niceea was convoked
especially to deal with it. It was then condemned as heretical,
and the Articles of Faith were defined and set down in the Nicene
Creed, which is recited to this day.</p>
<p>Other famous heresies were the Manichsean, the Gnostic, the
Adamite, the Severist, and the Donatist; and to these were soon
to be added, amongst others, the Pelagian and the
Priscilliantist.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Manichaeans' chief claim to celebrity lies in the
fact that the great St. Augustine of Tagaste, when he abandoned
the disorders of his youth, entered Christianity through this
sect, which professed a form of it vitiated by Sun-worship and
Buddhism.</p>
<p>The other heresies&mdash;with the exception of the
Pelagian&mdash;were, in the main, equally fantastic. The Gnostic
heresy, with its many subdivisions, was made up of mysticism and
magic, and founded upon Zoroastrian notions of dualism, of the
two powers of good and evil, light and darkness. To the power of
evil it attributed all creation save man, whose soul was
accounted of divine substance. The Adamites claimed to be in the
state of original innocency of Adam before the fall; they
demanded purity in their followers, rejected marriage, which they
urged could never have come into existence but for sin, and they
expelled from their Church all sinners against their tenets, even
as Adam and Eve had been expelled from Eden. The Severists denied
the resurrection of the flesh, would not accept the acts of the
apostles, and carried purity to fantastic lengths. The Soldiers
of Florinus denied the Last Judgment, and held it as an
undeniable truth that the resurrection of the flesh lay entirely
in reproduction.</p>
<p>The Pelagians were the followers of Pelagius, a British monk
who settled in Rome towards the year 400, and his heresy at least
was founded upon rational grounds. He denied the doctrine of
original sin, maintained that every human being was born in a
state of innocency, and that his perseverance in virtue depended
upon himself. He found numerous followers, and for twenty years
the conflict raged between Pelagians and the Church, until Pope
Zosimus declared against them and banished Pelagius from
Rome.</p>
<p>From Constantine onwards Christianity steadily maintains her
ascendancy, and her earliest assertion of her power is to bare
the sword of persecution, oblivious of the lofty protests against
it which she, herself, had uttered, the broad and noble advocacy
of tolerance which she had urged in the days of her own
affliction. We find Optatus urging the massacre of the
Donatists&mdash;who claimed that theirs was the true
Church&mdash;and Constantine threatening with the stake any Jew
who should affront a Christian and any Christian who should
become a Jew. We find him demolishing the churches of the Arians
and Donatists, banishing their priests and forbidding under pain
of death the propagation of their doctrines.</p>
<p>The power of Christianity suffered one slight check
thereafter, under the tolerant rule of Julian the Apostate, who
reopened the pagan temples and restored the cult of the old gods;
but it rose again to be finally and firmly established under
Theodosius in 380.</p>
<p>Now we see the pagan temples not only closed, but razed to the
ground, the images broken and swept away, their worship, and even
private sacrifice, forbidden under pain of death. From Libanius
we may gather something of the desolation which this spread among
the pagan peasant-folk. Residing at a distance from the great
centres where doctrines were being expounded, they found
themselves bereft of the old gods and without knowledge of the
new. Their plight is a far more pathetic one than that of the
Arians, Manichseans, Donatists, and all other heretics against
whom there was a similar enactment.</p>
<p>It is now, at this early date, that for the first time we come
across the title "Inquisitor of the Faith," in the first law*
promulgated to render death the penalty of heresy. It is now that
we find the great Augustine of Tagaste&mdash;the mightiest genius
that the Church has brought forth&mdash;denouncing religious
liberty with the question, "Quid est enim pejor, mors animae quam
libertas erroris?"** and strenuously urging the death of heretics
on the ground that it is a merciful measure, since it must result
in the saving of others from the damnation consequent upon their
being led into error. Similarly he applauded those decrees of
death against any one pursuing the polytheism that but a few
generations earlier had been the official religion of the Roman
Empire.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* IX. of the Theodosian Code.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** Epist. clxvi.]</p>
<p>It was Augustine&mdash;of whom it has been truly said that "no
man since the days of the Apostles has infused into the Church a
larger measure of his spirit"&mdash;in his enormous fervour, and
with the overwhelming arguments inspired by his stupendous
intellect, who laid down the principles that governed
persecution, and were cited in justification of it for nearly
1,500 years after his day. "He was," says Lecky, "the most
staunch and enthusiastic defender of all those doctrines that
grow out of the habits of mind that lead to persecution."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "History of Rationalism in Europe," vol.
ii. p. 8.]</p>
<p>So far, however much persecution may have been inspired by the
Church, its actual execution had rested entirely and solely with
the civil authorities; and this aloofness, indeed, is urged upon
the clergy by St. Augustine. But already before the close of the
fourth century we find ecclesiastics themselves directly engaged
in causing the death of heretics.</p>
<p>Priscillian, a Spanish theologian, was led by St. Paul's "Know
ye not that ye are the temple of God?" to seek to render himself
by purity a worthy dwelling. He preached from that text a
doctrine of stern asceticism, and forbade the marriage of the
clergy. This at the time was optional,* and by proclaiming it to
be Christ's law he laid himself open to a charge of heresy. He
was accused of magic and licentiousness, excommunicated in 380
and burnt alive, together with several of his companions, by
order of two Christian bishops. He has been described as the
first martyr burnt by a Spanish Inquisition.**</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The decretal of Siricius, five years after
the execution of Priscillian, strictly enjoined celibacy on all
in holy orders above the rank of a subdeacon, and dissolved all
marriages of the clergy existing at the time. Leo the Great, in
the middle of the fifth century, further extended the rule so as
to include the sub-deacons hitherto excepted. This was largely
the cause of the split that occurred between the Greek and Latin
Churches.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** See E. C. H. Bahut, "Priscillian et le
Priscilliantisme."]</p>
<p>It must be added that the deed excited the profoundest
indignation on the part of the clergy against those bishops who
had been responsible for it, and St. Martin of Tours hotly
denounced the act. But this indignation was not provoked by the
fact that men had suffered death for heresy, but by the
circumstance that ecclesiastics had procured the execution. For
it was part of the pure teaching of the early Church that under
no circumstances&mdash;not as judge, soldier, or
executioner&mdash;should a Christian render himself the
instrument of the death of a fellow-creature; and it was partly
through their rigid obedience to this precept that the Christians
had first drawn attention to themselves and aroused the
resentment of the Roman government, as we have seen. Now, whilst
at no time after the Church's accession to power was this
teaching observed with any degree of strictness, yet there were
limits to the extent to which it might be neglected, and that
limit, it was considered, had been exceeded by those prelates
responsible for the death of the Priscilliantists.</p>
<p>The point, apparently trivial at present, has been insisted
upon here, in view of the important and curious part which it was
destined to play in the procedure of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The Church had now come to identify herself with the State.
She had strengthened her organizations; she had permeated the
State with her influences, until it may almost be said that the
State had lost its capacity for independent existence, and had
become her instrument. The civil laws were based upon her
spiritual laws; the standard of morality was founded upon her
doctrines; the development of the arts&mdash;of painting,
sculpture, literature, and music&mdash;became such as was best
adapted for her service, and, cramped thereby into confines far
too narrow, was partly arrested for a time; sciences and crafts
were stimulated only by her needs and curbed by her principles;
the very recreation of the people was governed by her spirit.</p>
<p>And yet, whilst influencing the State in its every
ramification so profoundly that State and Church appeared welded
into one disintegrable whole, she kept herself independent,
unfettered, and autonomous. So that when that great Empire of the
West upon which she had seemed to lean was laid in ruins by the
invading barbarians, she continued upright, unshaken by that
tremendous cataclysm. She remained to conquer the barbarian far
more subtly and completely than he had conquered. Her conquest
lay in bringing him to look upon her as the natural inheritor of
fallen Rome. Soon she entered upon that splendid heritage,
claiming for her own the world-supremacy that Rome had boasted,
and assuming dominion over the new nations that were building
upon the ruins of the shattered empire.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II. THE INQUISITION
CANONICALLY ESTABLISHED</h2>
<p>For some seven centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire
persecutions for heresy were very rare and very slight. This,
however, cannot be attributed to mercy. Although some of the old
heresies survived, yet they were so sapped of their vitality that
they were no longer openly flaunted in defiance of the
mother-Church, but were practised in such obscurity as, in the
main, to escape observation.</p>
<p>Fresh schisms, on the other hand, do not appear to have sprung
up during that spell. Largely this would be due to the clear
formulation of the Catholic theology by the various oecumenical
councils held in the years that followed upon the Christian
emancipation, and by the intellectual breadth of these doctrines,
which were entirely adequate and all-sufficient to the
intellectual capacity of the time. But this state of things could
only have endured at the cost of arresting man's intellectual
progress. A certain restraint and curb undoubtedly was exerted,
but definitely to check the imaginative and reasoning faculties
of man has never been within the power of any creed, and never
can be. It was in vain that the Church sought to coerce thought
and to stifle the learning that struck at her very foundations
and discovered the error of the cosmic and historical conceptions
upon which her theology was based; in vain that she entrenched
herself within her doctrines, and adhered rigidly to the form she
had adopted.</p>
<p>Upon this uncompromising rigidity of the Catholic Church much
censure has been poured. The present aim is a cold survey of
certain features of history, and in such a task all polemical
matters should be avoided. Yet it may be permissible to say a
word here to elucidate rather than to defend an attitude that has
been unduly abused.</p>
<p>It is admitted that the unyielding policy of the Church was
one that militated seriously against intellectual evolution, and
on that account it is to be deplored. But let the unbiased mind
consider for a moment the alternative. The admission of error is
the commencement of disruption. Where one error is admitted, a
thread is drawn from a weft whose threads are interdependent for
the stability of the whole. Who has yielded once has set up a
precedent that will be urged against him to make him yield again,
and yet again, until he shall have yielded all, and, having
nothing left, must suffer an imperceptible effacement.</p>
<p>When all is considered, there is an indisputable dignity in
the attitude of a Church which, claiming that what she teaches
rests not upon human knowledge but upon divine inspiration,
refuses to cede one jot of her doctrines to man's discoveries;
holding&mdash;and incontestably, so long as the premise is
admitted&mdash;that however certain may appear the truths which
human subtlety has disclosed, however false may appear the
doctrines to which she owes her being, it still remains that the
former are human and the latter divine of origin. Between the two
she proudly holds that there is no disputing; that error possible
to man is impossible to divinity; that man's perception of error
in the divine tenets of the Church is no more than the
manifestation of his own liability to err.</p>
<p>The Church of Rome realized that either she must be entirely,
or entirely cease to be. And it is matter for unprejudiced
consideration whether the spectacle of her immobility is not more
dignified than would have been that of her yielding up her
divinities one by one to the expanding humanities, and thus
gradually undergoing a course of dismemberment which must in the
end remove her last claim to existence. In the attitude she
assumed she remained the absolute mistress of her votaries; had
she departed from it she must have become their abject
servant.</p>
<p>Dr. Rule invites his readers to notice attentively that "no
Church but that of Rome ever had an Inquisition."* But he
neglects to carry the consideration to its logical conclusion,
and to add that in no Christian Church but that of Rome could an
Inquisition be possible. For it would be impossible to offend
heretically against any Church that accommodates itself to new
habits of thought in a measure as these occur, and gives way step
by step before the onslaught of learning.**</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "History of the Inquisition," vol. i. p.
14.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** And yet Dr. Rule's statement is
perilously akin to a truth untruly told, for the persecuting
spirit, which is the impugnable quality of the Holy Office, has
been present in other churches than that of
Rome&mdash;<i>vide</i> the Elizabethan persecution of all who
were not members of the Anglican Church.]</p>
<p>The Church of Rome presented her immutable formularies, her
unchangeable doctrines to the world. "This," she announced, "is
my teaching. By this I hold. This you must accept without
reservations, in its entirety, or you are no child of mine."</p>
<p>With that there could be no cavil. Had she but added the
admission of man's liberty to accept or reject her teaching, had
she but left man free to confess or not her doctrines as his
conscience and intelligence directed, all would have been well.
Unfortunately she accounted it her duty to go further; she used
coercion and compulsion to such an extent that she imbued her
children with the spirit of the eighteenth century Jacobin,
exclaiming, "Be my brother, or I kill you!"</p>
<p>Unable by intellectual means to stem the intellectual
secession from her ranks, she had recourse to physical measures,
and revived the fiercely coercive methods of the first
centuries.</p>
<p>A serious heretical outbreak had been occurring in Southern
France. There, it would seem, all the schisms that had disturbed
the Church since her foundation were gathered
together&mdash;Arians, Manichaeans, and Gnostics&mdash;to which
were added certain more recent sects, such as the Cathars, the
Waldenses, and the Boni Homines, or Good People.</p>
<p>These new-comers deserve a word of explanation.</p>
<p>The Cathars, like the Gnostics, were dualists; indeed, their
creed was little more than a development of Gnosticism. They
believed that the earth was the only hell or purgatory, that it
was given over to the power of the devil, and that human bodies
were no more than the prisons of the angel spirits that fell with
Lucifer. In heaven their celestial bodies still awaited them, but
they could not resume these until they had worked out their
expiation. To accomplish this a man must die reconciled with God;
failing that, another earthly existence awaited him in the body
of man or beast, according to his deserts. It will be seen that,
saving for abundant Christian elements introduced into this
faith, it was little more than a revival of metempsychosis, the
oldest and most fascinating of intelligent beliefs.</p>
<p>The Waldenses, or Vaudois, with whom were allied the Good
People, were the earliest Protestants, as we understand the term.
They claimed for every man the right to interpret the Bible and
to celebrate the sacraments of the Church without the need of
being in holy orders. Further, they denied that the Roman Church
was the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>These sects were known collectively as the Albigenses, so
called because the Council of Lombers, convoked to pronounce
their condemnation, had been held in the Diocese of Albi in
1165.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">ST. PETER THE MARTYR PREACHING.<br>
From the Painting by Berruguete.</p>
<p>Pope Innocent III made an attempt to convert them; with this
aim in view he sent two monks, Peter de Castelnau and one
Rodolfe, to restore order amongst them and induce them to return
to submission. But when they murdered one of his legates the Holy
Father had recourse to those other less legitimate measures of
combating liberty of conscience. He ordered the King of France,
the nobles and clergy of the kingdom, to assume the crusader's
cross, and to proceed to the extirpation of the Albigensian
heretics, whom he described as a worse danger to Christendom than
the Saracens; and he armed them for the fray with the same
spiritual weapons that John VIII had bestowed upon those who went
to war in Palestine in the ninth century. Upon all who might die
in the service of the Church he pronounced a plenary
indulgence.</p>
<p>It is not the present aim to follow the history of the
horrible strife that ensued&mdash;the massacres, pillages,
burnings that took place in the course of the war between the
Albigenses under Raymond of Toulouse and the Crusaders under
Simon de Montfort. For over twenty years did that war drag on,
and in the course of it the original grounds of the quarrel were
forgotten; it passed into a struggle for supremacy between North
and South, and thus, properly speaking, out of the history of the
Inquisition.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See C. Douais, "Les Hérétiques du Midi au
XIII Siècle."]</p>
<p>Now, for all that the title "Inquisitor of the Faith" was
first bestowed by the Theodosian Code, and for all that
persecutions against heretics and others had been afoot since an
even earlier date than that of Theodosius, Innocent III is to be
considered the founder of the Holy Inquisition as an integral
part of the Church. For it is under his jurisdiction that the
faculty of persecuting heretics, which hitherto had belonged
entirely to the secular arm, is now conferred upon the clergy. He
dispatched two Cistercian monks as inquisitors into France and
Spain, to engage in the work of extirpating heretics; and he
strictly enjoined all princes, nobles and prelates to afford
every assistance to these emissaries, and to further them in
every way in the work they were sent to do.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Eymericus, "Directorium Inquisitorum," p.
58.]</p>
<p>Himself, personally, Pope Innocent directed his attention to
the Paterini&mdash;a sect which rebelled against the celibacy
imposed upon the clergy&mdash;who were gaining ground in Italy.
He invoked the secular arm to assist him in their apprehension,
imprisonment, and banishment, in seizing their possessions, which
were confiscated, and in razing their houses to the ground.</p>
<p>In 1209 he assembled a council at Avignon, under the
presidency of his legates, wherein by his directions it was
ordained that every bishop should select such of his subjects,
counts, castellans, and knights as might seem to him proper, and
swear them to undertake the extermination of all excommunicated
heretics.</p>
<blockquote>"And to the end that the bishop may be the better
enabled to purge his diocese of heretical pravity, let him swear
one priest and two, three or more laymen of good repute in every
parish to report to the bishop himself, and to the governors of
cities or to the lords and bailiffs of places, the existence of
any heretics or abettors of heresy wherever found, to the end
that these may be' punished according to the canonical and legal
dispensations, in all cases suffering forfeiture of property. And
should the said governors and others be negligent or reluctant in
the execution of this divine service, let their persons be
severally excommunicated, and their territories placed under the
interdict of the Church."*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* Concilium Avenionense, a.d. 1209.]</p>
<p>In the year 1215 Pope Innocent held a further council at the
Lateran in which he extended the field of ecclesiastical activity
in persecution. He issued an injunction to all rulers, "as they
desired to be esteemed faithful, to swear a public oath that they
would labour zealously to exterminate from their dominions all
those who were denounced as heretics by the Church."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Eymericus, "Directorium Inquisitorum," p.
60.]</p>
<p>This injunction was backed by a bull which menaced with
excommunication and forfeiture of jurisdiction any prince who
should fail to extirpate heretics from his dominions&mdash;so
that at one stroke the Pope asserted his power to an extent that
denied liberty of conscience to people and independence to
princes.</p>
<p>And meanwhile every heretic against the Holy Catholic and
Orthodox Faith, as accepted by the fathers assembled in the
Church of St. John, was excommunicate, and there followed these
provisions:</p>
<blockquote>"When condemned, the secular powers, or their
representatives, being present, they shall be delivered to these
for punishment, the clerics being previously degraded from their
orders. The property of laymen shall be confiscated; that of
clerics bestowed upon their churches. Persons marked with
suspicion only shall, unless they can clear themselves, be
smitten with the sword of anathema, and shunned by all. If they
persist for a year in excommunication, they shall be condemned as
heretics.<br>
<br>
"Secular powers must be moved or led, or at need compelled by
ecclesiastical censure, to make public oath for the defence of
the faith, as they themselves desire to be esteemed faithful,
undertaking to labour with all their power to extirpate from
their dominions those whom the Church shall denounce as
heretics."*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* "Concilium Lateranense IV," A.D.
1215.]</p>
<p>The excommunication that was to wait upon disobedience was no
empty threat, nor yet was it concerned alone with the spiritual
part of man. The Pope's anathema imposed the same penalties upon
those against whom it was launched as the Druid's curse had
imposed of old.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[See Caesar, "De Bello Gallico," p 13. libca
vi.]</p>
<p>Persons under the ban of the Church might hold no office, nor
claim any of the ordinary rights of citizenship, or, indeed, of
existence. In sickness or distress none might show them charity
under pain of incurring the same curse, nor after death should
their bodies be given Christian burial.</p>
<p>By these provisions and injunctions the Inquisition may be
said to have entered upon the second stage of its evolution, and
to have assumed a strictly ecclesiastical character&mdash;in
short, to be canonically established.</p>
<p>It was Pope Innocent III who placed in the hands of the Church
this terrible weapon of persecution, and who, by the awful
severity of his own attitude towards liberty of conscience, of
thought, and of expression, afforded to fanaticism and religious
intolerance an example that was to be their merciless guide
through centuries to come.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-03" name="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III. THE ORDER OF ST.
DOMINIC</h2>
<p><i>"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven; and
come and follow Me."</i></p>
<p>The contrast between the condition thus enjoined by the
Founder of Christianity and the worldly position occupied by His
Vicar on earth was now fast approaching the climax which was to
become absolute with the era of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>From the simple folk foregathering in Rome in the middle of
the first century to discuss and to guide one another in the
practice of the new doctrine of love and humility, conveyed by
word of mouth from the East, in all its pristine simplicity,
unburdened as yet by theological complexities, unfettered by
formularies, it is a far cry indeed to the proud curial
Christians of the Rome of Pope Innocent III.</p>
<p>The successor of Peter, the poor fisherman of Galilee, was
enthroned with a splendour outrivalling that of any other earthly
potentate. Temporally he was lord of considerable dominions;
spiritually he claimed empire over the entire Christian world,
and maintained his supremacy with the thunderbolts of anathema
which he had forged himself. His glittering court was thronged
with rustling, scarlet prelates, with patricians in cloth of gold
and silver, captains in steel, mincing fops and stately senators.
He was arrayed in garments woven of the very finest fleece,
crowned with the triple diadem of white peacock feathers within
three flaming circlets of precious stones. On his coronation
kings served him upon the knee at table; throughout his reign
princes and patricians were his lackeys.</p>
<p>From the steps of the Lateran on the day of his accession he
would fling a handful of money to the Roman crowd, exclaiming:
"Gold and silver are not for me. What I have I give to thee."</p>
<p>Yet his riches were vast, their sources almost inexhaustible.
The luxury in which he lived and moved was the most sumptuous
that wealth could command and art and artifice produce.</p>
<p>Nor was this ecclesiastical magnificence confined to Rome and
the Papal Court. Gradually it had come to permeate the entire
body clerical until it had affected even the monastic orders.
From the simplicity of their beginnings these orders had
developed into baronial institutions. The fathers presided in
noble abbeys over wide tracts of arable and vineyard which they
owned and cultivated, and over rural districts and parishes,
which they governed and taxed as feudal lords rather than served
as priests.</p>
<p>So arrogant and aristocratic was become the spirit of a clergy
whose mission was to preach the sublimest and most ideal of
democratic doctrines, that the Church seemed no longer within the
reach of plebeian and peasant-folk. It was fast becoming an
institution of patricians for patricians.</p>
<p>How long this state of things might have endured, what results
might have attended its endurance, it were perhaps idle to
speculate. That a change was wrought, that provision was made for
the lowly and the poor, is due to the advent of two men as
similar in much as in much else they were dissimilar. They met in
Rome at the foot of the pontifical throne.</p>
<p>Either might have been the founder of a religion had he not
found already in the world an ideal religion which he could
serve. Both were men born into easy circumstances of life; one,
Francesco Bernardone, was the son of a wealthy merchant of
Assisi; the other, Domingo de Guzman, of Calahorra, was a
nobleman of Spain.</p>
<p>To-day the Church includes them in her Calendar as St. Francis
of Assisi and St. Dominic. They are the resplendent twain whom
Dante beheld together in his "Paradise":</p>
<blockquote>"L' un fu tutto serafico in ardore,<br>
L' altro per sapienza in terra fue<br>
Di cherubica luce un splendore."*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* "Paradiso," C. xi. v. 37-39.]</p>
<p>St. Francis&mdash;through the sweetness and tenderness that
emanated from his poetic, mystic nature, the most lovable of all
the saints&mdash;came from his native Assisi to implore the
Father of Fathers to permit him to band together into an order
the barefoot companions he had already gained, to the end that
they should practise Christ's injunction of poverty and
self-abnegation, and minister to the afflicted.</p>
<p>St. Dominic&mdash;and our concern is more with him&mdash;had
been chosen for his eloquence and learning to accompany the
Bishop of Osma upon an inquisitorial journey into Southern
France. There he had witnessed the fierce carnage that was
toward. He had preached to the heretics at Toulouse, and the
burning, passionate eloquence of his oratory had made converts of
many of those who were prepared to resist the cruel arguments of
fire and steel.</p>
<p>In the ardour of his zeal he had flung aside his rank and the
ease and dignity it afforded him. Like St. Francis he went
barefoot, embracing poverty and self-denial; yet, less mystical,
less tender, entirely practical where the propagation of the
Faith was concerned, he had exulted in the bloody victories that
Simon de Montfort had won over the heretical Albigenses.</p>
<p>Yet, if he gloried in the end achieved&mdash;conceiving it the
supremest of all human ends&mdash;he must have been touched with
regret for the means employed.</p>
<p>He has been termed a fierce and cruel zealot. But ferocity and
cruelty do not go hand in hand with such lowly humility as
undoubtedly was his. And the very object of his mission to Rome
permits, if it does not point to, a very different conclusion. He
went deploring the bloodshed he had witnessed, however greatly he
may have prized the fruits of it. Inspired by the success that
had attended his oratory, he aimed at providing other and gentler
means by which in the first instance to seek the attainment of
the same ends. He went to implore Pope Innocent's leave to found
an order of preachers who in poverty and lowliness should go
abroad to win back to the Roman fold the sheep that had strayed
into heretical pastures.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Pope Innocent considered the simultaneous requests of both
these men&mdash;requests which, springing from the same
passionate fervour in both, yet came by different, if similar,
channels to a sort of unity in the end.</p>
<p>He perceived the services which such men as these might render
to the Church, endowed as they were with the magnetic power of
creating followings, of inflaming hearts, and replenishing the
flickering lamp of public zeal.</p>
<p>He detected no heresy, no irony, in the cult of pauperdom
which they would go forth to preach under the sanction and
charter of the luxurious, aristocratic, curial court.</p>
<p>But there existed another obstacle to his granting them their
prayers. So numerous already were the monastic orders that a
Council of the Lateran had decreed that no more should be
created. Favouring these petitioners, however, he was applying
himself to the surmounting of the difficulty when death took
him.</p>
<p>Thus the burden of solving this problem was thrust upon his
successor, Honorius III. And it is said that the new pope was
spurred to discover a solution by a dream&mdash;which has been
made the subject of a fresco by Bennozzo Gozzoli&mdash;in which
he beheld this saintly pair supporting with their hands the
tottering Lateran.</p>
<p>Since he could not establish them and their followers as
monastic fathers, he had recourse to creating brotherhoods for
them. These brotherhoods he affiliated to the order of St.
Augustine, the Dominicans as friars-preachers (<i>fratres
predicatores</i>) and the Franciscans as friars-minors
(<i>fratres minores</i>).</p>
<p>Thus were launched these two mendicant orders, which by the
enormous following they were so soon to win, were destined to
become one of the greatest means of power of the Roman
Church.</p>
<p>In the lifetime of their founders the fundamental laws of
poverty were observed in all their intended purity. But soon
thereafter, being men under their rough habits, and susceptible
to the ambition that is man's, upon the acquisition of power
followed the acquisition of wealth. Their founders had
accomplished a renascence of the original spirit of Christianity.
But soon this began to undergo modification, and to respond to
worldly influences, until the history of the friars-mendicant
repeats and mirrors the history of Christianity itself In a
measure as they spread through Christendom, so they acquired
convents, lands, and property as they went. The personal poverty
of each brother remained, it is true; they still went abroad
barefoot and coarsely garbed, "without staffs or bag, or bread,
or money," as their rule decreed. Individually they kept the vow
of privation; but considered collectively their poverty "remained
outside the convent gate," as Gregorovius says, echoing what
Dante had said before him.*</p>
<p class="footnote">"Ma il suo peculio di nuova vivanda<br>
E' fatto ghiotto si, ch' esser non puote<br>
Che per diversi salti non si spanda;<br>
<br>
"E quanto le sue pecore remote<br>
E vagabonde più da esso vanno,<br>
Più tornano all' ovil di latte vote."<br>
<br>
&mdash;DANTE, "Paradiso," C. xi. v. 124-9.</p>
<p>For the service of the Church the friars-mendicant became a
splendid army, and an army, moreover, whose maintenance made no
draught upon the pontifical treasury, since, by virtue of their
mendicancy, the orders were entirely self-supporting. And whilst
both orders, magnificently organized, grew extremely powerful,
the Dominicans became formidable through their control of that
Inquisition whose early stirrings had inspired St. Dominic to his
task.</p>
<p>His aim had been to found a preaching order whose special
mission should be the overthrow of heresy wherever found. The
brethren were to combat it, employing their eloquence on the one
hand to induce the heretic to abjure his error, on the other to
inflame the faithful against him, so that terror should
accomplish what might not be possible to persuasion.</p>
<p>It may be that this mission which they had made specially
their own, as their founder ordained, peculiarly fitted the
Dominicans to assume the government of an ecclesiastical
establishment whose aim was identical. It was this order of St.
Dominic that was to erect the grim edifice of the Holy Office,
and to develop and assume entire control of the terrible
machinery of the Inquisition. Their persuasion was to be the
ghastly persuasion of the rack; their eloquence was to be the
burning eloquence of the tongues of material flame that should
lick their agonizing victims out of existence. And all for the
love of Christ!<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Although it might be difficult to show&mdash;as has been
attempted&mdash;that Domingo de Guzman himself was actually the
first ordained Inquisitor, nevertheless as early as 1224, within
three years of his death, the Inquisition in Italy and elsewhere
was already entirely in the hands of the Dominicans. This is
shown by a constitution promulgated at Padua in February of that
year by the Emperor Frederic II. It contains the following
announcement;</p>
<p>The Order of St. Dominic 43</p>
<blockquote>"Be it known to all that we have received under our
special protection the preaching friars of the order of
preachers, sent into our Empire on business of the Faith against
heretics, and likewise all who may lend them assistance&mdash;as
much in going as in abiding and returning&mdash;save such as are
already prescribed; and it is our wish that all should give them
favour and assistance; wherefore we order our subjects to receive
benignly any of the said friars whenever and wherever they may
arrive, keeping them secure from the enmity of heretics,
assisting them in every way to accomplish their ministry
regarding the business of the Faith...And we do not doubt that
you will render homage to God and our Empire by collaborating
with the said friars to deliver our Empire from the new and
unusual infamy of heretical pravity.*"</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* Limborch, "Historia Inquisitionis," lib.
i. cap. 12.]</p>
<p>The constitution decreed that heretics when so condemned by
the Church and delivered over to the secular arm should be
condignly punished; that if any, through the fear of death,
should desire to return to the faith, he should receive the
penance that might be imposed canonically and be imprisoned for
life; that if in any part of the Empire heretics should be
discovered by the inquisitors or by other zealous Catholics, the
civil powers should be under the obligation of effecting their
arrest at the request of the said inquisitors or other Catholics,
and of holding them in safe custody until excommunicated by the
Church, when they should be burnt; that the same punishment
should be suffered by <i>fautores</i>&mdash;i.e. those guilty of
concealing or defending heretics; that fugitives be sought for,
and that converts from the same heresy be employed to discover
them.</p>
<p>Odious as was this last enactment, there was yet worse
contained in the Emperor's constitution. It was decreed that "the
sin of <i>lèse-Majesté divine</i> being, as it is, greater than
that of <i>lèse-Majesté humaine</i>, and God being the avenger of
the sins of the fathers on the children, to the end that these
may not imitate the sins of those, the descendants of heretics to
the second generation shall be deemed incapable of honours or of
holding any public office&mdash;<i>excepting the innocent
children who shall denounce the iniquity of their
fathers</i>."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Limborch, "Historia Inquisitionis," lib.
i, cap. 12.]</p>
<p>The barbarous provision here given in italics calls for no
comment.</p>
<p>Within four years of issuing that harsh proclamation against
all rebels from the sway of Rome, Frederic himself, in rebellion
against the pontiff's temporal sway, was to feel the lash of
excommunication. But with that we have no concern. After his
reconciliation with the Pope he renewed the constitution of 1224,
adding a provision concerning blasphemers, who, in common with
heretics of whatever sect, should suffer death by fire; yet if
the bishops should desire to save any such, this could only be
done subject to the offender's being deprived of his tongue, so
that never again should he blaspheme God.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>In the year 1227 Ugolino Conti, who had been a friend of
Dominic and of Francis, ascended the papal throne under the style
of Gregory IX.</p>
<p>It was this pontiff who, carrying forward the work that had
been undertaken in that direction by Innocent III, gave the
Inquisition a stable form. He definitely placed the control of it
in the hands of the Dominican friars, giving them, where
necessary, the assistance of the Franciscans. But the
participation of the latter in the business of that terrible
tribunal is so slight as to be insignificant.</p>
<p>Gregory's bull, given in "Raynaldus,"* is one of
excommunication against all heretics.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* 1231, N. 14, 16-17.]</p>
<p>Further, it ordains that all condemned by the</p>
<p>Church shall be delivered to the secular arm for punishment,
all clerics so delivered being first degraded from their orders;
that should any wish to abjure his heresy and return to the
Church, penance shall be imposed upon him, and he shall suffer
perpetual imprisonment. Abettors, concealers, and defenders of
heretics are similarly excommunicated; and if any such shall
neglect to procure absolution within one year, he shall be
accounted <i>infamous</i>, and shall be neither eligible for any
public office nor the elector of any other, nor act as witness,
testator, inheritor, nor have power to seek justice when wronged.
If a judge, no proceedings shall be laid before him, and his
sentences, where passed, shall be null and void; if an advocate,
he shall not have faculty to plead; if a notary, his deeds shall
be void; if a cleric, he shall be deposed from his office and
benefices.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ban of excommunication shall fall upon those
who hold traffic with any who are excommunicated, and they shall
further be punished with other penalties.</p>
<p>Those who are under suspicion of heresy, unless they see to it
that they overcome the suspicion either by canonical purgation or
otherwise according to the quality of the person and the motives
for the suspicion, shall be excommunicated, and if they do not
give condign satisfaction within one year, they shall be deemed
heretics. Their claims or appeals shall not then be admitted, nor
shall judges, advocates, or notaries exercise their functions in
favour of them; priests shall refuse to administer the sacraments
to them and to admit their alms or oblations, and so shall the
Templars and Hospitallers and other regular orders, under pain of
loss of office, from which naught can save them but a mandate
from the Holy See.</p>
<p>Should any give Christian burial to one who has died under
excommunication, he shall himself incur excommunication, from
which he shall not be delivered until with his own hands he shall
have exhumed the corpse, and so disposed that the place may never
again be used for sepulture.</p>
<p>Should any know of the existence of heretics or of any who
practise secret conventicles or whose ways of living are
uncommon, they are bound under pain of excommunication to divulge
the same to their confessor or other by whom they believe it will
come to the knowledge of their prelate.</p>
<p>Children of heretics and of the abettors or concealers of
heretics shall be deprived until the second generation of holding
any public office or benefice.</p>
<p>To the provisions of this bull, additions were made by the
civil governor of Rome, as representing the secular arm whose
concern it would be to inflict the punishments regarding which
the Church refrained from being explicit&mdash;confining herself
to the promise that they should be "condign."</p>
<p>He provided that: those arrested should be detained in prison
until condemned by the Church, when, after eight days, they
should be punished.</p>
<p>Their property should be confiscated, one-third going to the
delator, one-third to the judge who should pronounce sentence,
and one-third to repair the walls of Rome, or otherwise as might
be considered.</p>
<p>The dwellings of heretics or of any who should consciously
have entertained heretics should be razed to the ground.</p>
<p>If any man should have knowledge of the existence of heretics
and fail to denounce them he should be fined the sum of 20
livres. Should he lack the means to pay, he was to be banished
until he could find them.</p>
<p>Abettors and concealers of heretics should for the first
offence suffer confiscation of one-third of their property, to be
applied to keeping the walls of Rome in repair. If the offence
were repeated, then they should be banished for ever.</p>
<p>All who were elected senators must swear before taking office
that they would observe all laws against heretics; and were any
to refuse this oath his acts as senator would be null and void
and none should be obliged to follow or obey him, whilst those
who might have sworn obedience to him were absolved of their
oath. Should a senator accept this oath but afterwards refuse or
neglect to respect its terms, he must incur the penalties of
perjury, suffer a fine of 200 silver marks, to be applied to the
repairing of the walls, and become ineligible for any public
office.</p>
<p>Two years later&mdash;in 1233&mdash;at a Council held at
Beziers, the papal legate, Gaultier of Tournai, elaborated these
canons by the following provisions:</p>
<blockquote>"All magistrates, nobles, vassals, and others shall
diligently seek to discover, apprehend, and punish heretics
wherever found. Every parish in which a heretic is discovered
shall pay as a penalty for having harboured him one silver mark
to the person who shall have discovered him. All houses in which
heretics may have preached shall be demolished and the property
confiscated, and fire shall be set to all caves and other
hiding-places where heretics are alleged to be concealed. AH the
property of heretics shall be confiscated, and their children
shall inherit nothing. Their abettors, concealers, or defenders
shall be dealt with in the same manner. Any persons suspected of
heresy must make public profession of faith upon oath, under pain
of suffering as heretics; they shall be compelled to attend
divine service on every feast-day, and all who are
<i>reconciled</i> to the Church shall wear as a distinguishing
badge two crosses externally on their garments&mdash;one on the
breast, the other on the back&mdash;both of yellow cloth, three
fingers in width, the vertical limb measuring 2½ hands, the
horizontal one 2 hands.* If a hood is worn, this must bear a
third cross&mdash;all under pain of being deemed heretics and
suffering confiscation of property."**</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* Or, say, 1½ft. by 1 ft.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** Llorente, "Historia Critica," i. p. 135.
Raynaldus 1233.]</p>
<p>These enactments by their uncompromising harshness abundantly
reveal the extent to which heretics were execrated by the Church
in her intolerance and her firm determination to extirpate them.
They also reveal something of the far-reaching, pitiless,
priestly subtlety and craft which were to render so terrible this
tribunal.</p>
<p>The provisions for the punishment of those who should be moved
by Christian charity to succour any of the persecuted were
devised to the end that terror should stifle all such compassion;
whilst the decree that the children of convicted heretics should
suffer disinheritance and become ineligible for any honourable
appointment was calculatedly introduced to forge a further weapon
out of parental love. Where a man might readily, himself, have
endured martyrdom for his convictions, he would be made to pause
before including his children in the same sacrifice, before
suffering them to go destitute and branded.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Church the end in view could not fail to
justify any means that might be employed. The extirpation of
heresy was a consummation so very fervently to be desired that
any steps&mdash;almost any sin&mdash;would be condonable if
conducive to that end.</p>
<p>It has been argued that this crusade against heresy was
political, a campaign waged by the Church to protect herself from
the onslaught of liberty of thought, which was threatening her
overthrow. Such no doubt had been the case in earlier centuries;
but it was so no longer. Roman Catholicism had grown and spread
like a mighty tree, until her shadow lay across the face of
Europe and her roots were thrust far and wide into the soil.
These had taken too firm a hold, they were too full of vigour, to
permit that the withering of an occasional branch should give her
concern for the vitality of the growth itself. She had no such
concern. However abominable, however feral, however unchristian
even, may have been the institution of the Holy Office, it is
difficult to think that the spirit in which it was founded was
other than pure and disinterested.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">ST. DOMINIC<br>
From the Painting in the Prado Gallery, attributed to Miguel
Zittoz.</p>
<p>It may seem bitterly Ironical that men should have been found
who in the name of the meek and compassionate Christ relentlessly
racked and burnt their fellow-creatures. It was&mdash;bitterly,
deplorably, tragically ironical. But they were not conscious of
the irony. In what they did they were sincere&mdash;as sincere as
St. Augustine when he urged the extermination of heretics; and
none can call In question his sincerity or the purity of his
motives.</p>
<p>To understand their attitude it Is but necessary to consider
the absolute belief that was the Catholics' in what Lecky calls
"the doctrine of exclusive salvation." Starting from the premise
that the Church of Rome Is the true and only Church of Christ,
they held that no salvation was possible for any man who was not
a member of It. Nor could Ignorance&mdash;however
absolute&mdash;of the true faith be urged as an excuse for error,
any more than may Ignorance of the law be pleaded In the worldly
courts to-day. Thus, not only did they account irrevocably damned
those who schismatically deserted from the Church, and those who
like Jew and Moslem remained deliberately outside Its walls, but
similarly&mdash;such was man's Indifferently flattering
conception of divine justice and divine Intelligence&mdash;the
savages who had never so much as heard the name of Christ, and
the very babe who died before his heritage of Original Sin could
be washed away by the baptismal waters. Indeed, fathers of the
Church had waged heated wars of controversy concerning the
precise moment at which pre-natal life sets In, and,
consequently, damnation Is Incurred by the soul of the foetus
should it perish in the womb.</p>
<p>When it is considered that such doctrines were held
dogmatically. It will be realized that In the sight of the
Church&mdash;whose business was the salvation of
souls&mdash;there could be no sin so intolerable, so execrable,
as heresy. It will be realized how it happened that the Church
could consider those of her children who were guilty of such
crimes as murder, rape, adultery, and the sin of the Cities of
the Plain, with the tolerance of an indulgent parent, whilst
rising up in intolerant wrath to smite the heretic whose life
might be a model of pure conduct. The former were guilty of only
the sins of weak humanity; and sinners who have the faith may
seek forgiveness, and find it in contrition. But heresy was not
merely the worst of sins, as some have held. In the eyes of the
Church it transcended the realm of sin&mdash;it was infinitely
worse than sin, because it represented a state that was entirely
hopeless, a state not to be redeemed or mitigated by good actions
or purity of life.</p>
<p>Taking this view of heresy, the Church accounted it her duty
to stamp out this awful soul-pestilence so as to prevent its
spreading; and she had St. Augustine's word for it that it was
merciful to be merciless in the attainment of that object. When
viewed, as it were, from within, there is nothing illogical in
the attitude of the Church towards heresy. What is illogical is
the conception of God that is involved in the doctrine of
exclusive salvation.</p>
<p>Even if we survey the case of Galileo&mdash;one of the most
illustrious prisoners ever arraigned before the tribunal of the
Holy Office&mdash;we have no just cause to suppose that, in
demanding his retraction of the theory of the earth's movement
round the sun, the inquisitors were inspired by any motives
beyond the fear lest the spread of a notion&mdash;honestly deemed
by them to be an illusion&mdash;should disturb man's faith in the
Biblical teaching with which it was in conflict.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-04" name="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV. ISABELLA THE
CATHOLIC</h2>
<p>Llorente agrees with the earlier writers on the subject in
considering the Spanish Inquisition as an institution distinct
from that which had been established to deal with the Albigenses
and their coevals in heresy. It is distinct only in that it
represents a further development of the organization launched by
Innocent III and perfected by Gregory IX.</p>
<p>Before entering upon the consideration of this Modern
Inquisition&mdash;as it is called&mdash;it will perhaps be well
to take a survey of the Spain of the Catholic
Sovereigns&mdash;Ferdinand and Isabella&mdash;in whose reign that
tribunal was set up in Castile.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>For seven hundred years, with varying fortune and in varying
degree, the Saracen had lorded it in the Peninsula.</p>
<p>First had come Berber Tarik, in 711, to overthrow the
Visigothic Kingdom of Roderic, to spread the Moslem dominion as
far as the mountains in the north and east and west from sea to
sea. When the Berber tribe, the Syrians, and the Arabs had fallen
to wrangling among themselves, Abdurrahman the Omayyad crossed
from Africa to found the independent amirate, which in the tenth
century became the Caliphate of Cordova.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Christians had been consolidating their forces
in the mountain fastnesses of the north to which they had been
driven, and under Alfonso I they founded the Kingdom of Galicia.
Thence, gradually but irresistibly, presenting a bold front to
the Moorish conqueror, they forced their way down into the plains
of Leon and Castile, so that by the following century they had
driven the Saracens south of the Tagus. Following up their
advantage, they continued to press them, intent upon driving them
into the sea, and they might have succeeded but for the coming of
Yusuf ben Techufin, who checked the Christian conquest, hurled
them back across the Tagus, and, master of the country to the
south of it, founded there the Empire of the Almoravides.</p>
<p>After these came the Almohades&mdash;the followers of the
Mahdi&mdash;and the land rang for half a century with the clash
of battle between Cross and Crescent, Castile, Leon, Aragon, and
the new-born Kingdom of Portugal striving side by side to crush
the common foe at Navas de Tolosa.</p>
<p>In 1236 Leon and Castile&mdash;now united into one
kingdom&mdash;in alliance with Aragon, wrested Cordova from the
Moors; in 1248 Seville was conquered, and in 1265 Diego of Aragon
drove the Saracen from Murcia, and thereby reduced the Moslem
occupation to Granada and a line of Mediterranean seaboard about
Cadiz, in which they remained until Ferdinand of Aragon and
Isabella of Castile, by virtue of their marriage, had united the
two crowns on the death (in 1474) of Henry IV, Isabella's
brother.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Ferdinand brought, with Aragon, Sicily, Sardinia, and Naples;
Isabella brought, with Castile, Leon and the rest of the Spanish
territory, saving Granada and that portion of the coast still in
Moorish hands. And thus was founded, by the welding of these
several principalities into one single state, that mighty Kingdom
of Spain which Columbus was so soon to enrich by a new world.</p>
<p>But though founded by this marriage, this kingdom still
required consolidating and subjecting. Generations of misrule in
Castile, culminating in the lax reigns of John II and Henry IV,
had permitted the spread of a lawlessness so utter that its like
was not to be found in any other state at that time. Anarchy was
paramount mistress of the land, and Pulgar has left us a striking
picture of the impossible conditions that prevailed.</p>
<p>"In those days," he writes, "justice suffered, and was not to
be done upon the malefactors who plundered and tyrannized in
townships and on the highways. None paid debts who did not want
to do so; none was restrained from committing any crime, and none
dreamed of obedience or subjection to a superior. What with
present and past wars, people were so accustomed to turbulence
that he who did not do violence to others was held to be a man of
no account.</p>
<p>"Citizens, peasants, and men of peace were not masters of
their own property, nor could they have recourse to any for
redress of the wrongs they suffered at the hands of governors of
fortresses and other thieves and robbers. Every man would gladly
have engaged to give the half of his property if at that price he
might have purchased security and peace for himself and his
family. Often there was talk in towns and villages of forming
brotherhoods to remedy all these evils. But a leader was wanting
who should have at heart the justice and tranquillity of the
Kingdom."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[Pulgar, "Chronica," Part II. cap. li.]</p>
<p>The nobility, as may be conceived&mdash;and, indeed, as Pulgar
clearly indicates&mdash;were not only tainted with the general
lawlessness, but were themselves the chief offenders, each man a
law unto himself a tyrannical, extortionate ruler of his vassals,
lord of life and death, unscrupulously abusing his power, little
better than a highway robber, caring nothing for the monarchy so
long as the monarchy left him undisturbed, ready to rebel against
it should it attempt to curtail his brigandage.</p>
<p>To crush these and other unruly elements in the state, to
resolve into order the chaos that had invaded every quarter of
the kingdom, was the task which at the outset the young Queen
perceived awaiting her&mdash;a task that must have daunted any
mind less virile, any spirit less vigorous.</p>
<p>And there were other and more pressing matters demanding her
instant attention if she were to retain her seat upon this almost
bankrupt throne of Castile which she had inherited from her
brother.</p>
<p>Alfonso V of Portugal was in arms, invading her frontiers to
dispute, on his niece Juana's behalf, Isabella's right.</p>
<p>Henry IV had left no legitimate issue, but his wife Juana of
Portugal had brought forth in wedlock a daughter of whom she
pretended that he was the father, whilst the King of Portugal, to
serve interests of his own, recognized the girl as his legitimate
niece. Public opinion, however, hesitated so little to proclaim
her bastardy that it had named her La Beltraneja, after Beltran
de la Cueva who notoriously had been her mother's lover. And what
Beltran de la Cueva, himself, thought about it, may be inferred
from the circumstance that in the ensuing struggle he was found
fighting for the honour of Castile under the banner of Queen
Isabella.</p>
<p>The war demanded all the attention and resources of the
Catholic Monarchs, and Isabella's own share in these labours was
conspicuous. They resulted in the rout of the Portuguese
supporters of the pretender at Toro in 1476. By that victory
Isabella was securely seated upon her throne and became joint
ruler with Ferdinand of Castile and Aragon.</p>
<p>She was twenty-five years of age at the time, a fair, shapely
woman of middle height, with a clear complexion, eyes between
green and blue, and a gracious, winsome countenance remarkable
for its habitual serenity. Such, indeed, was her self-control,
Pulgar tells us, that not only did she carefully conceal her
anger when it was aroused, but even in childbirth she could
"dissemble her feelings, betraying no sign or expression of the
pain to which all women are subject." He adds that she was very
ceremonious in dress and equipage, that she was deliberate of
gesture, quick-witted, and ready of tongue, and that in the midst
of the labour of government&mdash;and very arduous labour, as
shall be seen&mdash;she found time to learn Latin, so that she
could understand all that was said in that tongue.</p>
<p>"She was a zealous Catholic and very charitable, yet in her
judgments she inclined rather to rigour than to mercy. She
listened to counsel, but acted chiefly upon her own opinions. Of
a rare fidelity to her word, she never failed to fulfil that to
which she had pledged herself, save where compelled by stress of
circumstance. She was reproached, together with her husband, of
being wanting in generosity, because, seeing the royal patrimony
diminished by the alienation of fiefs and castles, she was always
very careful of such concessions.</p>
<p>"'Kings,' she was wont to say, 'should preserve with care
their dominions, because in alienating them they lose at once the
money necessary to make themselves beloved and the power to make
themselves feared.'"*</p>
<p class="footnote">Pulgar, "Cronica," II. cap. iv.]</p>
<p>Such is the portrait that Pulgar has left us, and considering
that he is writing of a sovereign, it would be no more than
reasonable to suspect flattery and that curious, undiscriminating
enthusiasm which never fails to create panegyrists when it is a
question of depicting a prince, however inept, to his
contemporaries. But if Pulgar has erred in this instance, it has
been on the side of moderation in his portrayal of this gifted,
high-spirited woman.</p>
<p>Her actions speak more eloquently of her character than can
the pen of any chronicler, and it is in the deeds of princes that
we must seek their true natures, not in what may have been
written of them in their own day. The deeds of Isabella's
life&mdash;with one dark exception that is the subject of this
history&mdash;more than bear out all that Pulgar and others have
set down in praise of her.</p>
<p>No sooner had she overthrown those who came from abroad to
dispute her right to the crown than she turned her attention to
the subjugation of those who disputed her authority at home. In
this herculean labour she had the assistance of Alonzo de
Quintanilla, her chancellor, and Juan Ortega, the King's
sacristan. These men proposed to organize at their own risk one
of those brotherhoods which Pulgar mentions as having been so
ardently desired by the country for its protection from those who
preyed upon it. This <i>hermandad</i> was to act under royal
sanction and guidance, with the object of procuring peace and
protection of property in the kingdom. Isabella readily approved
the proposal, and the brotherhood was immediately founded, a tax
to support it being levied upon those in whose interest it was
established, and very willingly paid by them.</p>
<p>Splendidly organized, this association, half military, half
civil, so effectively discharged the functions for which it was
created, that twenty years later&mdash;in 1498&mdash;it was
possible to abolish it, and to replace it by a much simpler and
less costly system of police which then sufficed to preserve the
order that had been restored.</p>
<p>Further to subject the turbulent and insubordinate nobility,
Isabella employed methods similar to those adopted in like case
by her neighbour, Louis XI of France. She bestowed the offices of
state upon men of merit without regard to birth, which hitherto
had been accounted the only qualification. The career of the law
was thrown open to the burgher classes, and every office under
the crown was made accessible to lawyers, who thus became the
staunch friends of the sovereign.</p>
<p>If the nobles did not dare to revolt, at least they protested
in the strongest terms against these two innovations that so
materially affected and weakened their prestige. They represented
in particular that the institution of the <i>hertnandad</i> was
the manifestation of a want of confidence in the "faithful
nobility," and they implored that four members of their order
should be appointed by the Catholic Sovereigns to form a council
of supreme direction of the affairs of State, as under the late
King Henry IV.</p>
<p>To this the Catholic Sovereigns replied that the
<i>hermandad</i> was a tutelary institution which was very
welcome to the country, and which it was their pleasure to
maintain. As for the offices of State, it was for the sovereigns
to appoint such men as they considered best qualified to hold
them. The nobles, they added, were free to remain at Court or to
withdraw to their own domains, as they might see fit; but as for
the sovereigns, themselves, as long as it should please God to
preserve them in the high position in which He had deigned to
place them, it should be their care not to imitate the monarch
who was cited to them as an example, and not to become puppets in
the hands of their "faithful nobility."</p>
<p>That answer gave the nobles pause. It led them to perceive
that a change had taken place, and that the lawless days of Henry
IV were at an end. To have made them realize this was something.
But there was more to be done before they would understand that
they must submit to the altered conditions, and Isabella pursued
the policy she had adopted with an unswerving directness, as the
following story from Pulgar's Chronicle bears witness:</p>
<blockquote>A quarrel had broken out in the Queen's palace at
Valladolid between Don Fadrique Enriquez (son of the Admiral of
Castile) and Don Ramiro de Guzman. Knowledge of it reached the
Queen, and she ordered both disputants to hold themselves under
arrest in their own quarters until she should provide that
judgment be given between them by the Courts. Fadrique, however,
signified his contempt of the royal mandate by disobeying it and
continuing at large. Learning this, Isabella gave the more
obedient Guzman his liberty, and the assurance of her word that
he should suffer no harm.<br>
<br>
A few days later he was riding peacefully through the street,
secure in the Queen's safe-conduct, when he was set upon by three
masked horsemen of the household of Fadrique and severely beaten.
No sooner did the Queen hear of this further affront to her
authority than she got to horse, and rode through torrential rain
from Valladolid to the Admiral's castle at Simancas. In fact, in
such haste did she set out that she rode alone, without waiting
for an escort. This, however, followed presently, but did not
come up with her save under the very walls of the Admiral's
fortress.<br>
<br>
She summoned the Admiral, and commanded him to deliver up his
rebellious son to her justice, and when Don Alonso Enriquez
protested that his son was not there, she bade her followers
search the castle from battlements to dungeons. The search,
however, proved fruitless, and Isabella returned empty-handed and
indignant to Valladolid. Arrived there, she took to her bed, and
to those who came to seek news of her health, she replied; "My
body aches with the blows delivered yesterday against my
safe-conduct by Don Fadrique."<br>
<br>
The Admiral, trembling before the royal wrath, resolved to
deliver up his son and cast him upon the mercy of the Queen. So
the Constable of Castile&mdash;Fadrique's uncle&mdash;undertook
the office of intercessor. He went with Don Fadrique to
Valladolid, and imploring Isabella to consider that the young man
was but in his twentieth year and that he had sinned through the
rashness of youth, begged her to do upon him the justice she
might wish or the mercy that was due.<br>
<br>
The Queen, however, was not to be moved to mercy for offences
that set her royal authority in contempt. She was inexorable. She
refused to see the offender, and submitted him to the indignity
of being taken to prison through the streets of the city by an
alcalde. After a spell of confinement there she banished him to
Sicily, prohibiting his return to Spain under pain of severest
punishment.<br>
<br>
It happened, however, that Don Ramiro de Guzman did not consider
his honour sufficiently avenged by his enemy's exile. One night,
when the Court was at Medina del Campo, he ambushed himself in
his turn with some followers of his own, and attacked the
Admiral, to return him the blows received from his son. From this
indignity the Admiral was saved by his escort. But when Isabella
heard of the affair, she treated Guzman as a rebel, seized his
castles in Leon and Castile, as she would have seized his person,
but that to escape her anger he fled to Portugal for
shelter.*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[Pulgar, "Cronica," II. cap c.]</p>
<p>No less determined was her conduct in the matter of the
Grand-Mastership of Santiago.</p>
<p>There were in Spain three religio-military orders: the Knights
of Alcantara, the celibate Knights of Calatrava&mdash;who were
the successors of the Knights Templars&mdash;and the Knights of
Santiago. This last order had been founded for the purpose of
affording protection to the pilgrims who came into Spain to visit
the shrine at Compostella of St. James the Apostle, who is
alleged to have been the first to bear the message of
Christianity into the Iberian Peninsula.* These pilgrimages,
chiefly from France, were a great source of revenue to the
country, and it became of importance to ensure their immunity
from the predatory hordes that infested the highways. Further,
the Knights of Santiago had found employment for their arms in
the crusade waged on Spanish soil against the Moors, in token
whereof they wore the Crusader's cross in red upon their white
cloaks. They acquired great power and wealth, possessing castles
and convents in every part of Spain, so that the office of Grand
Master of the Order was one of great weight and
importance&mdash;too great, in the opinion of Isabella, to be in
the hands of a subject.</p>
<p class="footnote">[The Jesuit Mariana is among those who doubt
the story of St. James's visit to Spain and the presence of his
body at Compostella, but he considers that "it is not desirable
to disturb with such disputes the devotion of the
people."&mdash;"Hist. General de España."]</p>
<p>This opinion she boldly manifested in 1476, when the death of
Don Rodrigo Manrique left the office vacant. She took horse, as
was her custom, and rode to Huete, where the Chapter of the Order
was assembled upon the business of the necessary election, and
she frankly urged that to an office so exalted it was not fitting
that any but the King should be elected.</p>
<p>The proposal was not received with satisfaction. Ferdinand was
an Aragonese, and despite the union of the two kingdoms which
must be completed when he should succeed to the throne of Aragon,
he was still looked upon as a foreigner by the Castilians. Under
Isabella's insistence, however, a compromise was effected. The
Chapter consented to elect Ferdinand to the office of
Grand-Master on condition that he should nominate a gentleman of
Castile to act as his deputy for the discharge of the duties of
the position. This was done, and Alonso de Cardenas&mdash;a loyal
servant of the Sovereigns&mdash;was chosen as the royal deputy.
Thus Isabella established it that the appointment of Grand-Master
of the Order of Santiago should be a royal prerogative.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Even more strikingly than in either of the instances cited
does the Queen's resolute, spirited nature manifest itself in her
manner of dealing with a revolt that took place in Segovia at the
commencement of her reign.</p>
<p>During the war with Portugal the Catholic Sovereigns had
entrusted their eldest daughter, the Princess Isabella, to the
care of Andres de Cabrera, the Seneschal of the Castle of
Segovia, and his wife, Beatriz de Bobadilla.</p>
<p>Cabrera, a man of stern and rigid equity, had occasion to
depose his lieutenant, Alonso Maldonado, from his office,
conferring this upon his own brother-in-law, Pedro de Bobadilla.
Maldonado conspired to avenge himself. He begged Bobadilla's
permission to remove some stones that were in the castle, upon
the pretext that he required them for his own house, and he sent
some men of his own to fetch them. These men, who were secretly
armed, having gained admission, stabbed the sentry and seized the
person of Bobadilla, whilst Maldonado, with other of his people,
took possession of the castle itself. The inmates of the Alcazar,
hearing the uproar, fled to the Homenaje Tower, taking with them
the Infanta, who was five years of age at the time. Fortified in
this, they defied Maldonado when he attacked it. Finding it
impregnable, the rebel ordered Bobadilla to be brought forward,
and threatened the besieged that unless they admitted him he
would put the prisoner to death.</p>
<p>To this threat Cabrera's dignified reply was that Maldonado
must do as he pleased, but the gates would not be opened to
him.</p>
<p>By this time a multitude of the townspeople had gathered
there, alarmed by the disturbance and armed for any emergency. To
these Maldonado cunningly represented that what he was about was
being done in their interests against the overbearing tyranny of
the Governor, and he invited them to join hands with him in the
cause of liberty to complete the work he had so excellently
begun. The populace largely took sides with him, so that Segovia
was flung into a state of war. There was constant fighting in the
streets, and the gates were in the hands of the rebels, with the
exception of that of St. John, which was held for Cabrera.</p>
<p>It is believed that it was Maria de Bobadilla herself who,
stealing undetected from the Alcazar, escaped from Segovia and
bore to the Queen the news of what was taking place, and the
consequent peril of the royal child.</p>
<p>Upon learning this, Isabella instantly repaired to Segovia.
The leaders of the rebellion had news of her approach, but dared
not carry their insubordination to the length of closing the
gates against her. They went so far, however, as to ride out to
meet her and to attempt to deny admittance to her followers; and
her counsellors, seeing the humour of the populace, urged her to
be prudent and to accede to their wishes. But her proud spirit
flared up under that cautious advice.</p>
<p>"Learn," she cried, "that I am Queen of Castile, that this
city is mine, and that no conditions are to be imposed upon me
before I enter it. I shall enter, then, and with me all those
whom I may judge necessary for my service."</p>
<p>With that she ordered her escort forward, and entered the city
by a gate that was held by her partisans, and so won through to
the Alcazar.</p>
<p>Thither flocked the infuriated mob, and thundered at the
gates, demanding admission.</p>
<p>The Queen, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Cardinal
of Spain and the Count of Benavente, who were with her, ordered
the gates to be thrown open and as many admitted as the place
would hold. The populace surged into the courtyard, clamouring
for the Seneschal. To meet them came the slight, fair young
queen, alone and fearless, and when in their astonishment they
had fallen silent&mdash;</p>
<p>"People of Segovia," she calmly addressed them, "what do you
seek?"</p>
<p>Dominated by her serenity, awed by her majesty, their fury
fell from them. Humbly now they urged their grievance against
Cabrera, accusing him of oppression, and imploring of the Queen's
grace his demission.</p>
<p>Instantly she promised them that their request should be
granted; whereupon the revulsion was complete, and the mob that
but a few moments earlier had been yelling threats and
execrations now raised their voices loyally to acclaim her.</p>
<p>She commanded them to return to their homes and their labours,
and to leave the administration of justice in her hands, sending
her their ambassadors to prefer their complaint against Cabrera,
which she would investigate.</p>
<p>As she commanded so it was done, and when she had examined the
accusations against the Seneschal and satisfied herself that they
were groundless, she announced him free from guilt and reinstated
him in his office, the conquered people bowing submissively to
her ruling.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[Colmenares, "Historia de Segovia," cap.
xxxiv, §§ xii and xiii; Pulgar, "Cronica," II. cap. lix.]</p>
<p>In 1477 Isabella moved into Andalusia, in which province, as
elsewhere, law and order had ceased to exist. She entered Seville
with the proclaimed intention of demanding an account of the
guilty. But at the very rumour of her approach and the business
upon which she came, some thousands of the inhabitants whose
consciences were uneasy made haste to depart the city.</p>
<p>Alarmed by this depopulation, the Sevillans implored the Queen
to sheathe the sword of justice, representing that after the
bloody affrays that for years had been afflicting the district
there was scarcely a family in which some member was not
answerable to the law.</p>
<p>Isabella, gentle and merciful by nature&mdash;which renders
her association with the Inquisition the more
deplorable&mdash;lent an ear to these representations, and
granted an amnesty for all crimes committed since the death of
Henry IV. But she was not so lenient with those who had
prostituted the justice which they administered in her name.
Informed of the judges who were making a trade and extortion of
their judgments, she punished them by deposition, and herself
fixed the scale of legal costs to be observed in future.</p>
<p>Finding a mass of impending law-suits which the misrule of the
past years had put upon the province, she directed her attention
to clearing up this Augean stable. Every Friday, attended by her
Council, she sat in the great hall of the Alcazar of Seville to
hear the plaints of the most humble of her subjects; and so
earnestly and vigorously did she go to work that in two months
she had disposed of litigations that might have dragged on for
years.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Upon her accession she had found the royal treasury exhausted
by the inept administration of the last two reigns and the
prodigal, reckless grants that Henry IV and Juan II had made to
the nobles. This condition of things had seriously embarrassed
the Catholic Sovereigns, and they had been driven to various
expedients to raise the requisite funds for the war with
Portugal. Now that the war was at an end, they found themselves
without the means necessary to maintain the royal state.</p>
<p>Isabella made a close investigation of the grants that had
been made by her brother and father, and she cancelled all those
that were the fruit of caprice and wantonness, restoring to the
Crown the revenues that had been recklessly alienated and the
taxes that the country had hitherto paid to none but the bandits
who oppressed it.</p>
<p>Similarly she found the public credit entirely ruined. Under
the late king such had been the laxity, that in three years no
less than 150 public mints had been authorized, and this
permitted such abuses that a point had been reached where it
almost seemed that every Spaniard minted his own money, or that,
as Rosseeuw St. Hilaire puts it, "coining was the country's chief
industry."</p>

<p style="text-align: center">POPE INNOCENT III. AND ST.

From a Fresco in the Church of the Sacro Speco, Subiaco.</p>
<p>She reduced the number of mints to five, and exercised the
severest control over their output, thereby liberating trade from
the fear of fraud that had been stifling it. An increased and
steadily increasing prosperity was the almost immediate result of
this wise measure.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Having restored order in the country, she turned her attention
to the Court, applied herself to the purification of its morals,
and set about converting it from the disgusting licence that had
prevailed in her brother's time.</p>
<p>Herself of a rigid chastity, she exacted the same purity of
conduct in all the women who approached her, and she submitted
the noble damsels brought up at her Court to the very strictest
surveillance. Loving the King very sincerely, she was notoriously
inclined to jealousy: let him but look too assiduously upon any
lady of her train, and Isabella found a way to remove her from
the Court. She saw to it that the pages who were in waiting upon
her should be given a good education, that thus they might avoid
the idleness which unfailingly leads to waste of character and to
immorality. Finally, according to Bernaldez,* she extended her
moral reforms to the convents, which were no less in need of them
than the Court, and she corrected and punished the great
depravity that was permeating all conventual orders.**</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Cap. cc. Bernaldez was the parish priest
of Palacios at the time of the Queen's death. He has left us a
rather intimate history of the Catholic Sovereigns, fairly rich
in vivid detail.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** "Hizo corrigir y castigar la gran
disolucion y dishonestidad que habian en sus reinos cuando
comenzé de reiuar entre los frailes y monjas de todas las
ordenes, y fizo encerrar las monjas de muchos monasterios que
Vivian muy dishonestas, asi en Castilla como en los reynos de
Aragon y Cataluña."&mdash;Bernaldez, "Historia de los Reyes
Catolicos," cap. cc.]</p>
<p>There is no chronicler of her reign who does not dilate upon
her great piety. Bernaldez compares her to St. Helena, the mother
of the Emperor Constantine,* and describes her as very devoted to
the Holy Faith and very obedient to Holy Church. Bernaldez, of
course, was writing after the establishment of the Inquisition,
of which he, in common with other contemporary and subsequent
chroniclers, very warmly approved; and he may have been very
largely influenced by consideration of the support which she had
unfortunately lent to its introduction into Castile. But that her
piety was extreme and sincere we infer from the moment that we
see her, after the battle of Toro, which definitely gave her the
crown, going barefoot to church to a service of thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="footnote">[St. Helena's memory was prominently before
the public attention just then, owing to the discovery in Rome of
a silver box containing what was alleged to be the label that had
been hung upon the Cross. Its recovery from the Holy Land was, of
course, attributed to St. Helena, and it was supposed that it had
been brought by her to Rome.]</p>
<p>Yet, however ardent her piety, it would not carry her the
length of recognizing in the Pope the temporal over-lord of
Castile.</p>
<p>From the thirteenth century the power of the Church had been
increasing in Spain under the dogma of the spiritual sovereignty
of Rome over all the Catholic churches of the world. The clergy
had amassed enormous wealth with that facility so peculiarly
their own when the occasion is afforded them, and to this end
they had abused the reckless, foolish liberality of Isabella's
predecessors.</p>
<p>Lucius Marinaeus informs us that the incomes of the four
archbishoprics&mdash;Toledo, Santiago, Seville, and
Granada&mdash;amounted to 134,000 ducats,* whilst those of the
twenty bishoprics came to some 250,000 ducats.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The ducat was worth 7s. 6d. of our present
money, with fully five times the purchasing power of that sum; so
that, roughly, this would be equivalent to-day to £200,000.]</p>
<p>Surrounded as she was by priestly counsellors whom she
respected, she nevertheless manifested plainly her impatience of
the clerical usurpation of the rights of the Crown. The chief of
these abuses was no doubt that practised by the Pontiff himself,
in conferring upon foreigners the highest and richest benefices
of the Church of Spain, ignoring that it was the prerogative of
the Crown to name the bishops&mdash;always subject to papal
confirmation. That Isabella, devout and priest-surrounded as she
was, should have dared to oppose the Holy See and the terrible
Pope Sixtus IV, as fearlessly as she had opposed her predatory
nobles, is perhaps the highest proof that history can yield of
her strength of character.</p>
<p>Her smouldering indignation flared out when the Pope, ignoring
her nomination of her chaplain, Alonzo de Burgos, to the vacant
bishopric of Cuenca, appointed his own nephew, Raffaele Riario,
Cardinal of San Sisto, to that vacant see.</p>
<p>Twice already had she sought the pontiff's confirmation of
nominees of her own for other benefices&mdash;the Archbishopric
of Saragoza and the Bishopric of Tarragona&mdash;and on each
occasion her nominee had been set aside in favour of a creature
of the Pope's. But this third contemptuous disregard of her
prerogative was more than her patience could endure. The Catholic
Sovereigns refused to ratify the appointment of Riario, and
begged the Pope&mdash;submissively at first&mdash;to cancel
it.</p>
<p>But the harsh, overbearing Sixtus returned an answer
characteristic of his arrogant nature. It was his, he announced,
to distribute at his pleasure all the benefices of Christendom;
and he condescended to explain that the power which it had
pleased God to confer upon him on earth could not be limited by
any will but his own, and that it was governed only by the
interests of the Catholic Faith, of which he was the sole
arbiter.</p>
<p>But his stubbornness met a stubbornness as great. The Catholic
Sovereigns replied by withdrawing their ambassador from the Papal
Court, and issuing an injunction to all Spanish subjects to leave
Rome.</p>
<p>Matters were becoming strained; an open rupture impended
between Spain and the Vatican. But the Sovereigns had notified
the Pope that it was their intention to summon a general council
of the Church to settle the matter in dispute, and no Pope of
those days could contemplate with equanimity a general council
assembled for the purpose of sitting in judgment upon his
decrees. Whatever the result, since at these councils the papal
authority was questioned, it must follow that thereafter that
authority would be impaired. Therefore this was the stock threat
employed to bring a recalcitrant pontiff to a reasonable frame of
mind.</p>
<p>It made Sixtus realize the strength of purpose that was
opposed to him; and, knowing as he did that this resoluteness
backed an undeniable right which he had violated, he perceived
that he dared carry insistence no further. So, despite his
earlier assertion that the power which he held from God could be
limited by no will but his own and governed by no consideration
but that of the interests of the Faith, he gave way
completely.</p>
<p>The three royal nominees were duly confirmed in the vacant
sees, and Sixtus gave an undertaking that in future he would make
no appointments to the benefices of Spain save of such
ecclesiastics as the Catholic Sovereigns should nominate.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Salazar de Mendoza, "Cronica del Gran
Cardenal," I. cap. lii.]</p>
<p>It is to be added that in acting upon this signal victory
which she had won, Isabella used the faculty it gave her with
such pious wisdom, sincerity, and discretion that had the Pope
but followed her example in the appointment of dignitaries, it
would have contributed to the greater honour and glory of the
Church. For she sternly opposed the granting of benefices upon
any grounds but those of absolute merit.</p>
<p>Having won her way in this, she was the better able to curb
the predatory habits of her clergy by edicts that limited their
power to proper clerical confines.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"It is amazing," comments Pulgar, "that a woman should have
been able, single-handed and in so little time, by her judgment
and perseverance to accomplish what many men and great Icings had
been unable to do in many years."</p>
<p>"Properly to judge the notable improvements," says Rosseeuw
St. Hilaire,* "which this reign effected in industry and
agriculture, it would be necessary to follow year by year the
table of ordinances issued by the Catholic Sovereigns. It would
be seen that in many things the genius of the founders of the
Castilian Monarchy forestalled the work of centuries. The happy
results of these reforms were soon experienced everywhere: the
highways were purged of malefactors, new roads of communication
were opened up, rivers were bridged, consular tribunals
established in commercial centres, consulates created in
Flanders, England, France, and Italy; with maritime commerce
expanding daily and in a measure with the progress of industry,
new buildings sprang up in every city, and the population rapidly
increased. All announced a new era of regeneration in Castile.
Contemporary writers, struck by these prodigies, exalt with one
voice this glorious reign which opens new destinies to
Spain."</p>
<p class="footnote">["Histoire d'Espagne," tom. v. p. 432.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It is certain that in no other country in Europe at this date
were the laws so well maintained and the rights of the individual
so well protected. Justice was rigorously done, there were no
longer arbitrary imprisonments and sequestrations, whilst the
unequal and capricious taxation of the past was abolished for all
time.</p>
<p>"Such," says Marinaeus, "was the strict justice meted out to
each in this happy reign that all men, nobles and knights,
traders and husbandmen, rich and poor, masters and servants, were
treated alike and received equally their share of it."</p>
<p>Where so much was good, where so much stout service was done
to the cause of progress and civilization, it is the more
deplorable to find in this reign the one evil thing that is now
to be considered&mdash;so evil that it must be held to
counterbalance and stultify all the excellences of Isabella's
sway.</p>
<p>The particular praise which so far we have heard their
contemporaries bestowing upon the Catholic Sovereigns, is a
praise which every man in every age must echo.</p>
<p>But there was praise as loud upon another score, as
universally uttered by every contemporary and many subsequent
historians, some no doubt because they were sincere in the deadly
bigotry that inspired it, others because they did not dare to
express themselves in different terms.</p>
<p>"By her," cries Bernaldez, as a climax to his summing-up of
her many virtues and wise provisions, "was burnt and destroyed
the most evil and abominable Mosaic, Talmudic, Jewish
heresy."</p>
<p>And Mariana, the historian, accounts the introduction of the
Inquisition into Spain the most glorious feature of the reign of
Ferdinand and Isabella. He is setting it above all the moral
splendours of that day when he exclaims:</p>
<p>"Still better and happier fortune for Spain was the
establishment in Castile at about this time of a new and holy
tribunal of severe and grave judges for the purpose of inquiring
into and punishing heretical pravity and apostasy..."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia General de España," lib. xxiv.
cap. xvii]</p>
<p>It would be unjust to suppose that there is a man to be found
to-day in the Church of Rome, of which the Spanish Inquisition
was a deplorable and integral part, who can turn with us in other
than regret to consider this black shadow that lies across one of
the brightest pages of history.</p>

<h2><a id="ch-05" name="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V. THE JEWS IN
SPAIN</h2>
<p>You have seen the Catholic Sovereigns instilling order into
that distracted land of Spain, enforcing submissiveness to the
law, instituting a system of police for the repression of
brigandage, curtailing the depredations of the nobles, checking
the abuses and usurpations of the clergy, restoring public
credit, and generally quelling; all the elements of unrest that
had afflicted the State.</p>
<p>But one gravely disturbing element still remained in the
bitter rancour prevailing between Christian and Jew.</p>
<p>"Some clerics and many laymen," says Pulgar,* "informed the
Sovereigns that there were in the Kingdom many Christians of
Jewish extraction who were Judaizing again and holding Jewish
rites in their houses, and who neither believed the Catholic
Faith nor performed the Catholic duties. They implored the
Sovereigns, as they were Christian princes, to punish that
detestable error, because if left unpunished it might so spread
that our Holy Catholic Faith must receive great harm."<br>

the relapse of those who had been converted to Christianity.]</p>
<p>Exactly to realize the position at the time, and the force
behind the arguments employed to induce the Catholic Sovereigns
to complete the ordering of the kingdom by the repression of the
re-Judaizing, or apostasy, of the New-Christians&mdash;as the
baptized Jews and their descendants were termed&mdash;it is
necessary to take at least a brief retrospective survey of the
history of the Israelites in Spain.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>At what period the Jews first appeared in the peninsula it is
not easy to determine with accuracy.</p>
<p>Salazar de Mendoza and other ancient historians, who base
their writings upon the work of Tomis Tamayo de Vargas, put
forward views upon this subject that are curious rather than
important.</p>
<p>They assert that the Kingdom of Spain was founded by Tubal,
the son of Japhet, who had Europe for his portion when the
division was made among the sons of Noah. Hence it was called
Tubalia, and later on Sepharad by the Jews, and Hesperida by the
Greeks. They hold that the first Jews in the Iberian Peninsula
were probably those who came with Nebuchadnezzar II, King of
Chaldea, and that he brought with him, in addition to Chaldeans
and Persians, ten tribes of Israel, who peopled Toledo,* and
built there the most beautiful synagogue that had been theirs
since the temple of Solomon. This synagogue, Mendoza states,
afterwards became the Convent of Santa Maria la Blanca (a
statement which the architecture of Santa Maria la Blanca very
flatly contradicts). He further informs us that they built
another synagogue at Zamora, and that those who worshipped there
always prided themselves&mdash;his point of view, of course, is
narrowly Christian&mdash;that to them had been addressed St.
Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Toledo, Mendoza tells us, was founded by
Hercules, who sailed to Spain in the ship <i>Argo</i>.]</p>
<p>They founded a university at Lucena (near Cordova), and
schools where the law was taught, so that the holy Jewish
religion spread rapidly, and was observed throughout Spain until
the coming of Our Lord into the world. Then, in 37 A.D., the
Apostle St. James came to preach the new gospel in Iberia, "so
that Spain was the first land after Judea to receive the holy law
of grace." Following the writings of Vargas, he goes so far as to
say: "and although to many it has seemed apocryphal that the
Toledo Jews wrote to denounce the Passion of Our Lord, the
assertion is not without good foundation."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Tomás Tamayo de Vargas maintains that the
Jews in Toledo at the time of the Crucifixion sent a letter of
warning and disapproval to their brethren in Jerusalem. This
letter&mdash;which it is alleged was translated into Castihan
when Toledo fell into the hands of Alfonso VI&mdash;the historian
quotes. Amador de los Rios, in his able and exhaustive history of
the Jews in Spain, pronounces the document to have been
manufactured to impose upon the credulity of the ignorant, since
to any one acquainted with the growth and development of the
Castilian language a glance is sufficient to prove its apocryphal
character.<br>
<br>
It is in this letter that the legend of the Jewish incursion into
Spain after the fall of Babylon has its roots. It concludes with
the following statement: "...You know that it is certain your
temple must soon be destroyed, for which reason our forefathers,
upon issuing from the Babylonian captivity, would not return to
Jerusalem, but with Pyrrhus for their captain&mdash;sent by
Cyrus, who gave them many riches taken from Babylon in the year
69 of the captivity&mdash;they came to Toledo and built here a
great aljama."]</p>
<p>Amador de los Rios is probably correct in his opinion that the
Jews made their first appearance in Spain during the Visigothic
dominion, after the fall of Jerusalem; and scarcely had they
settled in the peninsula when they began to experience the
bitterness of persecution. But after they had been delivered from
this by the Saracen invaders, to whom by race and creed they were
fairly sympathetic, they enjoyed&mdash;alike under Moslem and
Christian rule&mdash;a season of prosperity in Spain, which
endured until the close of the thirteenth century. And this
notwithstanding the undercurrent of mutual contempt and hatred,
of Christian for Jew and Jew for Christian, that was invincible
in an age of strong religious feeling.</p>
<p>To the Christian every Jew he encountered was his natural and
hereditary enemy, a descendant of those who had crucified the
Saviour; therefore he was an object of execration, a man upon
whom it must be meritorious to avenge the world's greatest crime
which had been perpetrated by his forbears.</p>
<p>The Jew, on the other hand, held the Christian in a contempt
as thorough. From the standpoint of his own pure and
unadulterated monotheism, he looked scornfully upon a religion
that must appear to him no better than an adaptation of
polytheism, developed upon the doctrines of one whom the Jews had
rejected as an impostor who had attempted to usurp the place of
the promised Messiah. To the truly devout Jew of those days the
Christian religion can have been little better than a blasphemy.
Nor was that the only source of his contempt. Looking back upon
his own splendid ancestry, upon the antiquity of his race and the
high order of its culture&mdash;the fruit of centuries of
intellectual evolution&mdash;what but scorn could he entertain
for these Spaniards of yesterday's hatching, who were just
emerging from the slough of barbarism?</p>
<p>It is clear that mutual esteem between the races was out of
all question in an age of strong religious prejudices.
Toleration, however, was possible, and the Jew applied himself to
win it. To this end he employed at once the vices and the virtues
of the unfortunate, which centuries of tribulation had rendered
inherent in him.</p>
<p>Armed with a stoicism that was almost pitiful, he donned a
mask of indifference to confront expressed hatred and contempt;
to violence he opposed cunning and the long-suffering patience
that is so peculiarly his own&mdash;the patience that is allied
with a high order of intelligence; the patience which,
interpreted into "an infinite capacity for taking pains," has
been urged as the definition of genius, and is the secret of the
Jew's success wherever he is established.</p>
<p>In the cohesion in a foreign land of this people that cannot
keep together as a nation, and in their extraordinary commercial
acuteness, lies the strength of the Jews. They grew wealthy by
their industry and thrift, until they were in a position to
purchase those privileges which in Christendom are the birthright
of every Christian. Their numbers, too, made it difficult in
Spain to treat them with contumely; for upon the reasoned
estimate of Amador de los Rios* there were close upon a million
Jews in Castile at the end of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p class="footnote">["Historia de los Judios en España," vol. i.
pp. 28, 29.]</p>
<p>They formed by their solidarity&mdash;as they always
do&mdash;an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, a state of their own
within the state; they had their own language and customs; they
were governed by their own laws, which were enforced by their
Rabbis and chiefs, and they pursued their own religion
unmolested, for even the observation of the Sabbath was respected
by the Castilians. Thus they came to create for themselves in a
foreign country a simulacrum of their own native land.</p>
<p>It is true that they were afflicted from time to time by
sporadic, local persecutions; but in the main they enjoyed a
tolerance and religious liberty which the poor harried Albigenses
beyond the Pyrenees might well have envied. For the Church, which
had already established the Inquisition, was very far&mdash;for
reasons that shall be considered in the next chapter&mdash;from
instigating any persecution of the Children of Israel. Thus,
Honorius III, whilst carrying forward the policy of Innocent III,
and enjoining the extirpation of heretics in Southern France and
elsewhere, confirmed (November 7, 1217) the privileges accorded
to the Jews by his predecessors upon the throne of St. Peter.
These were that no Jew should be constrained to receive baptism;
that should he incline to embrace the Christian Faith he must be
received in it with love and benevolence; that his feasts and
religious ceremonies must be respected by Christians; that the
whipping or stoning of Jews be forbidden and punished; that their
burial-places be held sacred.</p>
<p>And when King Ferdinand III&mdash;afterwards
canonized&mdash;wrested Seville from the Moors (1224), he made
over one of the best districts of the city to the Jews, and gave
them the four mosques contained in it that they might convert
them into synagogues.</p>
<p>The only restraint placed upon them by the law was that they
must refrain, under pain of death, from attempting to proselytize
among Christians, and that they must show respect for the
Christian religion.</p>
<p>These were the halcyon days of Hebrew prosperity in Spain.
Their distinguished abilities were recognized, and they won to
many positions of importance in the government. The finances of
the kingdom were in their control, and Castile prospered under
their able administration of its commerce. Alfonso VIII, in whose
reign it is estimated there were 12,000 Jews in Toledo alone,
employed a Jew as his treasurer, and did not disdain to take a
Jewess for his mistress&mdash;an interesting little fact in view
of the law that was so soon to be promulgated on that
subject.</p>
<p>Hardly less than their value to the nation's commerce were
their services to science, art, and literature. They excelled
particularly in medicine and chemistry, and the most skilful
doctors and surgeons of the Middle Ages were men of their
race.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century a change unfortunately
set in, and this external harmony so laboriously established was
disturbed by an excrescence of the real feelings that had never
ceased to underlie it. Largely the Jews were themselves to blame.
Deluded by the religious liberty that was conceded them, by the
dignities to which men of their faith had climbed, and by the
prosperity which they had attained, they failed to perceive that
their accumulated wealth was in itself a menace to their
safety.</p>
<p>Emboldened by the consideration shown them, they committed the
imprudence of giving a free rein to their Oriental taste for
splendour; they surrounded</p>
<p>themselves with luxury, and permitted themselves an
ostentatious magnificence in their raiment and equipages, and
thus proclaimed the wealth they had been amassing through
generations of comparative obscurity.</p>
<p>Had they confined themselves to this strictly personal display
all might yet have been well. But being dressed and housed in
princely fashion, they put on princely ways. They grew haughty
and arrogant with the horrible arrogance of wealth. They allowed
their disdain of the less affluent Christians to transpire in
their contemptuous bearing towards them, and being unchecked in
this it was but another step to abuse the privileges which they
enjoyed.</p>
<p>Their parade of wealth had provoked envy&mdash;the most
dangerous and maleficent of the passions implanted in the human
heart. Their arrogance and cavalier bearing stirred that envy
into activity.</p>
<p>Questions arose touching the sources of their wealth. It was
propounded against them that their usurious practices had ruined
many of the Christians whom they now dared to spurn. And although
usury had been sanctioned and it had been proclaimed lawful for
them to charge a rate of interest as high as 40 per centum, it
was suddenly remembered that usury had in all times been
uncompromisingly condemned by the Church&mdash;and by the term
usury the Church then understood any interest, however slight,
paid upon borrowed money.</p>
<p>Fanaticism began to stir uneasily in its slumber, and
presently, under the spur of greed, it roused itself and reared
its horrid head. Public feeling against the Israelites was
increased by the fact that they had practically acquired control
of the ever-unpopular offices for the collection of taxes.</p>
<p>The populace grew menacing. Evil tales concerning them were
put about, and they were accused, among other ritual
abominations, of practising human sacrifices.</p>
<p>Whether there was any real ground for the accusation is one of
those historical mysteries that baffle the student. On the one
hand it seems impossible to collect sufficient data to establish
any single one of the many specific accusations made; whilst on
the other hand, in view of the persistence with which the charge
crops up in different countries and at different epochs,* it
would be presumptuous to dismiss it as groundless.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* A case is at present before the Russian
law courts, arising out of a charge of this nature urged by an
officer of police.]</p>
<p>The first official recognition of the accusation is to be
found in the code known as the <i>Partidas</i>, promulgated by
Alfonso XI (1256-1263), which contains the following clause:</p>
<blockquote>"As we hear that in some places the Jews on Good
Friday make a mocking commemoration of the Passion of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, stealing boys and crucifying them, or making waxen
images and crucifying these when boys are not procurable, we
order that should it become known that hereafter, in any part of
our realm, such a thing is done, all those whom it is ascertained
are connected with the deed shall be arrested and brought before
the King. And when he shall have satisfied himself of the truth
of the charge he shall have them put to death, as many as they
may be."*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* Rios, "Hist, de los Judios," i. cap.
x.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Llorente mentions four specific cases of ritual murder, to
which he appears to attach credit:</p>
<p>1250.&mdash;A choir-boy of the Metropolitan Church of
Zaragoza, named Domingo de Val, crucified by Jews. He was
afterwards canonized and worshipped at Zaragoza as a martyr.</p>
<p>1452.&mdash;A boy crucified by Jews at Valladolid.</p>
<p>1454.&mdash;A boy from the lordship of the Marquess of
Almarza, near Zamora, crucified. His heart was afterwards burnt
and the ashes were consumed in wine by the Jews who attended the
ceremony. The body was afterwards discovered by a dog, and this
led to the arrest of the culprits and their conviction.</p>
<p>1468.&mdash;At Sepulveda, in the Bishopric of Segovia, a boy
was taken on the Thursday of Holy Week, and on Good Friday he was
crowned with thorns, whipped, and finally crucified. The Bishop,
D. Juan Arias, having received intelligence of this crime,
instituted an inquiry which resulted in the arrest of several
men, who, being convicted, were put to death.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Llorente gives as his authority for the third and fourth cases
the "Fortalicium Fidei" of Espina&mdash;by no means an authority
to be unquestioningly accepted. For the second he mentions no
authority whatever; whilst for fuller information upon the first
he refers his readers to the "Historia de Santo Domingo de Val,"
which is of no more authority than most works of this class.* But
the canonization of this victim gives rise to thought; for it was
never the way of the Church of Rome to proceed recklessly and
without due evidence in such matters. Even if it were, however,
it would be necessary in this case to show a motive for such
recklessness. The only motive possible would be the desire to
create justification for a persecution of the Jews. But, as has
been said&mdash;and as shall presently be made abundantly
clear&mdash;it never was the aim of the Church of Rome to engage
in such persecution or to incite to it.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See also Torrejoncillo's "Centinela contra
Judios."]</p>
<p>The famous case of the crucifixion of the "Holy Infant" of La
Gardia, whose trial was directed by Torquemada himself, shall be
considered in its proper place.</p>
<p>As is well known, the practice of human sacrifice is an
extremely old one; and it has been associated in varying forms
with many widely different cults. The earliest absolutely
historical instance of Jews resorting to it is probably that
quoted by Dr. J. G. Frazer (in "The Golden Bough") from the
"Historia Ecclesiastica" of Socrates. The scholiast relates how
in 416, at Imnestar in Syria, a company of Jews during one of
their festivals fell to deriding Christians and their Christ. At
the height of their frenzy they seized a boy, bound him to a
cross, and hung him up. A brawl was the result, and the
authorities intervened to make the Jews pay dearly for their
crime.</p>
<p>Amador de los Rios, in dealing with the spread of this charge
against the Spanish Hebrews in the thirteenth century, attributes
it to the subject's having been made the theme of an exceedingly
dramatic narrative poem in the "Milagros de Nuestra Sehora" by
Gonzalo de Berceo. At the same time he does not go so far as to
urge that the story upon which the ballad was founded may not
have had its roots in fact. On the contrary, he suggests that
such may have been the case, and having chronicled the
persistence of the accusation, he refrains from expressing any
definite opinion on the subject, hesitating either to accept, or
to dismiss as idle calumnies, these charges of ritual murder.</p>
<p>From the able arguments that have been put forward on this
same subject by Frazer and Wendland, it is to be concluded that
in any case the Christians were mistaken in assuming that these
alleged crucifixions held at the Feast of Purim&mdash;whether of
human beings or of effigies&mdash;were intended as a mockery of
the Passion of the Redeemer. Their origin is a far more ancient
one, involving a rite of which the Sacrifice of Golgotha may
itself have been an individual celebration&mdash;the
commemoration of the hanging of Haman&mdash;which, again, was the
continuation of a ritual practised by the Babylonians and
acquired from them by the Jews during their captivity.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* This engrossing subject is exhaustively
treated with great force and suggestiveness by J. G. Frazer in
"The Golden Bough," bk. iii. cap. iii., and also by P. Wendland
in "Jesus als Saturnalien-König."]</p>
<p>Whatever may be the truth of this matter of ritual murder,
there is no doubt that these rumours were diligently spread to
inflame the popular mind against the Jews.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC<br>
From a Painting in the Prado Gallery, attributed to Miguel
Zittoz.</p>
<p>Fanatical monks&mdash;ignoring the papal injunctions of
forbearance and toleration towards the Children of
Israel&mdash;went forth through Castile preaching the iniquity of
the Jews and God's wrath to fall upon the land that harboured
them. Thus incited, and perceiving profit in the business, the
faithful rose to destroy them. Massacres and pillages were the
inevitable result, although as a rule the authorities were prompt
to intervene and repress the populace's combined fanaticism and
quest for plunder.</p>
<p>But when in 1342 the Black Death spread over Europe, the
Dominicans and others renewed their denunciations, and led men to
believe the Jews responsible for the pestilence that afflicted
the land. In Germany they were ruthlessly given to choose between
death and baptism; and they suffered horribly until Pope Clement
VI stepped in to save them. He besought the Emperor to restrain
his murderers; and finding that his pleadings lacked effect, he
launched the thunderbolts of excommunication against all who
should continue to engage in the persecution of the Jews.</p>
<p>Stricken with terror before that awful menace of the Church,
the faithful paused in the carnage, and the voice of denunciation
fell silent.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Thus, for a season, they won a little measure of peace. But
throughout the fourteenth century spurts of persecution broke out
here and there, and massacres took place in Castile, Aragon, and
Navarre. The authorities, too, with the precedent of the Partidas
before them, whilst not going the length of sanctioning, or even
permitting violence where they could repress it, yet practised
upon the Jews the most flagrant and cruel injustices. Of these
the worst instance is that of the tax of 20,000 gold dobles
levied upon the aljamas of Toledo by Henry II on his accession in
1369. To realize this sum he ordered the public sale not only of
the property of the Jews, but actually of their persons into
slavery, as is to be seen by his decree.</p>
<p>The persecutions with which they were visited were chiefly
procured by the monks, who went abroad preaching against them,
fomenting the hatred of the Christians against a people who were
largely their creditors. Even where the religious incentive was
insufficient, the easy way of wiping out debts which this
gratification of their piety afforded proved irresistible to a
people whose flagrant immorality&mdash;in every sense of the
term&mdash;went hand in hand with their perfervid devoutness.</p>
<p>These persecutions, as we have said, the authorities made
haste to quell. But there arose presently a rabid fanatic who
proved altogether irrepressible. His name was Hernando Martinez.
He was a Dominican friar, and Canon of Ecija. Of his sincerity
there can be no doubt; and their sincerity is the most terrible
thing about such men, blinding them to the point of utter
madness. He was ready to suffer any martyrdom sooner than be
silent in a cause in which he considered it his sacred duty to
give tongue. About this sacred duty he went forth, screaming his
denunciations of the Jews, frenziedly inciting the mob to rise up
and destroy this accursed race, these enemies of God, these
crucifiers of the Saviour. Indeed, he could not have shown a more
fierce and frothing hatred of them had they been the very men who
at the throne of Pilate had clamoured for the blood of
Christ&mdash;and for whose pardon the gentle Redeemer had prayed
in His expiring moments: a matter this which escaped the
attention of the Archdeacon of Ecija, being&mdash;like many
another&mdash;too full of piety to find room for Christianity in
his soul.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The decree is quoted by Amador de los Rios
in "Historia de los Judios de España y Portugal," vol. ii. p.
571.]</p>
<p>Appeals against him were made to the Archbishop of Seville,
whose official, or representative, he was. He was ordered by his
Archbishop to desist, and when in flagrant disobedience to his
superior he continued to preach his gospel of blood and hatred,
appeals were made to the King, and even to the Pope; and byKing
and Pope was he commanded to cease his inflammatory sermons.</p>
<p>But he defied them all alike. In his fanatical fury he carried
his contumacy so far as to call in question the papal authority,
and to declare illicit the sanction given by the popes for the
erection and preservation of synagogues. This was perilously akin
to heresy. Men had been sent to the stake for less, and Hernando
Martinez must have been utterly mad if he conceived that the
Church would permit him to continue the diffusion of such
doctrines.</p>
<p>He was brought before the episcopal court to answer for his
words. He answered defiantly&mdash;told them that the breath of
God was in him, and that it was not for men to stop his
mouth.</p>
<p>Thereupon Don Pedro Barroso&mdash;the archbishop&mdash;ordered
that he should stand his trial for contumacy and heresy, and
meanwhile suspended him from all jurisdiction and all duties as
archiepiscopal official.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that Barroso died shortly thereafter,
before the trial could take place; and Martinez contrived to get
himself elected by the Chapter to the position of one of the
provisors of the diocese pending the appointment of a successor
to Barroso. Thus he resumed his power and the faculty to preach;
and he used it so ruthlessly that in December of 1390 several
synagogues in Seville were laid in ruins by the mob acting in
obedience to his incitement.</p>
<p>The Jews appealed to the King for protection, and the
authorities, now thoroughly roused, ordered that Martinez be
deposed from his office and forbidden to preach, and that the
demolished synagogues be rebuilt by the Chapter which had made
itself responsible by electing him.</p>
<p>But Martinez, ever defiant, disregarded both King and Chapter.
He pursued his bloodthirsty mission, stirring up a populace that
was but too ready to perceive&mdash;through his arguments&mdash;a
way to perform an act that must be pleasing to God whilst
enriching itself at the same time. What populace could have been
proof against such reasoning?</p>
<p>Finally, in the summer of 1391, the whole country was ablaze
with fanatical persecution. The fierce flames broke out first in
Seville, under the assiduous fanning of the deposed
archdeacon.</p>
<p>Three years before, in view of the harm that it was urged the
Jews were doing to religion by their free intermingling with
Christians, King John I had ordered them to live apart in
districts appointed for them, which came to be known as Juderias
(Jewries or ghettos). It was commanded that the Christians should
not enter these, and that for purposes of trade the Jews should
come to the public markets and there erect tents, but they must
own no house or domicile beyond the precincts of the Juderias,
and they must withdraw to these at nightfall.</p>
<p>Into the Juderia of Seville the mob now penetrated, wrought by
Martinez to a pitch of frenzy almost equal to his own. They went
armed, and they put the place to sack and slaughter, butchering
its every tenant without discrimination or pity for age or sex.
The number of the slain has been estimated at some four thousand,
men, women, and children.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Ortiz de Zuñiga, "Anales de Sevilla,"
under <i>año</i> 1391.]</p>
<p>From Seville the conflagration spread to the other cities of
Spain, and what had happened there happened in Burgos, Valencia,
Toledo, and Cordova, and further in Aragon, Cataluna, and
Navarre, whilst the streets of Barcelona are said to have run
with the blood of immolated Jews.</p>
<p>Into the Jewry of every town went the infuriated mob to force
Christ&mdash;as these Christians understood Him&mdash;upon the
inhabitants; to offer the terror-stricken Jews the choice between
steel and water&mdash;death and baptism.</p>
<p>So mighty and violent was the outbreak that the authorities
were powerless to quell it, and where they attempted to do so
with any degree of determination they were themselves caught in
the fury of the populace. Nor did the slaughter cease until the
Christians were glutted, and some fifty thousand Jews had
perished.</p>
<p>The churches were now filled with Jews who came clamouring for
baptism, having perceived that through its waters lay the way to
temporal as well as to spiritual life, and having in most
cases&mdash;in the abject state of terror to which they had been
reduced&mdash;more concern for the former than for the latter.
Llorente estimates the number of baptized at over a million, and
this number was considerably swelled by the conversions effected
by St. Vincent Ferrer, who came forth upon his mission to the
Jews in the early years of the fifteenth century, and who induced
thousands to enter the fold of Christianity by his eloquence and
by the marvels which it is said he wrought.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The fury of the mob having spent itself, peace was gradually
restored, and little by little those Jews who had remained
faithful to their religion and yet survived began to come forth
from their hiding-places, to assemble, and, with the amazing,
invincible patience and pertinacity of their race, to build up
once more the edifice that had been demolished.</p>
<p>But if the sword of persecution was sheathed, the spirit that
had guided it was still abroad, and the Jews were made to
experience further repressive measures. Under decrees of 1412-13
they lost most of the few privileges that the late king had left
them.</p>
<p>It was ordained by these that henceforth no Jew should occupy
the position of a judge even in a Hebrew court, nor should any
Jew be permitted to bear witness. All synagogues were to be
closed or converted into Christian temples, with the exception of
one in every town in which Jews should be established. They were
forbidden to continue the practice of the professions of
medicine, surgery, and chemistry, in which they had specialised
with such good results to the community. They were no longer to
occupy the offices of tax-collectors, and all commerce with
Christians was forbidden them. They must neither buy nor sell in
trade with Christians, nor eat with them, nor use their baths,
nor send their children to the same schools. The ghetto was
ordered to be walled round, so as to be enclosed and cut off from
the rest of the city, and they were forbidden to issue from it.
Intercourse between a Jew and a Christian woman was forbidden
under pain of death by burning, even though the woman were a
prostitute. They were forbidden to shave, and compelled to allow
their beards and hair to grow, in addition to which they were
ordered to wear as a distinguishing mark a circle of red cloth
upon the shoulder of their gabardines. They were further
compelled to hear three sermons annually from a Christian
preacher, whose aim it was to pour abuse and contumely upon them,
to inveigh against their accursed race and creed, to assure them
of the certainty of the damnation that awaited them, and to exalt
before them the excellences of the Catholic religion (based, be
it remembered, that we may fully savour the irony, upon Faith,
Hope, and Charity).*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Rosseeuw St. Hilaire, "Hist.
d'Espagne," liv. xix. chap. 1.]</p>
<p>When King John I had established the Juderias in 1388,
curtailing at the same time the privileges which until then the
Jews had enjoyed&mdash;at least by paying for them&mdash;there
had been many who, finding the restraint imposed upon them
altogether intolerable, had abandoned the faith of their fathers
and embraced Christianity. Those who held the affairs of this
world in esteem had sought baptism, and whilst many in doing so
had entirely broken with the past&mdash;and often, as is the way
of converts, become zealots in their observance of the faith
embraced&mdash;many others, whilst outwardly complying with the
obligations of the Christian religion, continued in secret to
observe the law of Moses and their Jewish rites. Similarly these
further decrees against their liberty had the effect of causing
still more numerous conversions to Christianity.</p>
<p>These converts were termed "New-Christians" by the Spaniards.
By those of their own race who had remained faithful they were
called "marranos"&mdash;a contemptuous epithet derived from
<i>Maran-atha</i>, ("The Lord is coming"), but supposed by the
Christians to signify "accursed." It came into general use before
very long.</p>
<p>These New-Christians, as a consequence of their conversion,
gained not merely the privileges recently lost to them as Jews,
but found themselves upon a footing of absolute equality with the
Old-Christians; every profession was open to them, and by
applying themselves to these with all their energy and
intelligence, they found themselves before very long in
possession of some of the highest offices in the land.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile the rigour of the decrees of 141 2 came
to be considerably relaxed; a degree of liberty and of
intermingling with Christians was permitted to the Jews, and many
of the offices which they had occupied of old came once more
under their control, chiefly those concerned with commerce and
finance and the farming of the taxes. Under the deplorable rule
of Henry IV the nobles, whose slave he was, demanded that he
should "expel from his service and States the Jews who,
exploiting public misery, have contrived to return to the
appointments of tax-gatherers."</p>
<p>The weak King agreed, but neglected to execute his promise; it
was presently forgotten, and the Jewish section of the community
was allowed to continue under the conditions of ease we have
described. Under these conditions was it found by Ferdinand and
Isabella upon their accession, nor does it appear that they paid
any particular attention to it until invited to do so by the
"clerics and laymen" who, as Pulgar tells us, represented to them
that in the re-Judaizings that were taking place was matter for
their jurisdiction.</p>

<h2><a id="ch-06" name="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE
NEW-CHRISTIANS</h2>
<p>It must clearly be understood that so far the Inquisition,
which for some three centuries already had been very active in
Italy and Southern France, had not reached Castile.</p>
<p>Even as recently as 1474, when Pope Sixtus IV had ordered the
Dominicans to set up the Inquisition in Spain, and whilst in
obedience to that command inquisitors were appointed in Aragon,
Valencia, Cataluiia, and Navarre, it was not held necessary to
make any appointment in Castile, where no heresy of any account
could be perceived. Trials of such offences against the Faith as
might occur were conducted by the bishops, who were fully
empowered to deal with them; and such offences being rare, the
necessity for a special tribunal did not suggest itself nor did
the Pope press the matter, desirous though he might be to see the
Inquisition universally established.</p>
<p>There was, of course, a large Hebrew population, and also a
considerable number of Moslems, in the peninsula. But these did
not come within the jurisdiction of any ecclesiastical court. The
Inquisition itself could take no cognizance of them, as they did
not offend against the Faith.</p>
<p>Explanation is perhaps necessary. We touch here upon a point
on which the religious persecution known as the Inquisition
compares favourably with any other religious persecution in
history, and in common justice this point should not&mdash;as but
too frequently has been the case&mdash;be obscured. There is too
little to be urged in favour of this tribunal so terribly
inequitable in its practices that we can afford to slur over the
one feature of its constitution that is invested with a degree of
equity.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the case in the course of civil and
popular persecutions, whatever may have been done by a frenzied
populace at the instigation of odd fanatical preachers acting
without the authority of their superiors in giving rein to the
fierce bigotry they had nurtured in their souls, the Church
herself, it must be clearly understood, neither urged nor
sanctioned the persecution of those born into any religion that
was not in itself a heresy of the Roman Faith. The tribunal of
the Inquisition was established solely&mdash;and moved
solely&mdash;to deal with those who apostatized or seceded from
the ranks of the Roman Church, precisely as an army deals with
deserting soldiers. Fanatical, horribly narrow, cruelly bigoted
as was the spirit of the Inquisition, yet the inquisitors
confined their prosecutions to apostates, to the adulterers of a
faith whose purity and incorruptibility they had made it their
mission to maintain.</p>
<p>If the Church repressed liberty of conscience, if she stifled
rationalism and crushed independence of thought, she did so only
where her own children were concerned&mdash;those who had been
born into the Catholic Faith or who had embraced it in
conversion. With those born into any other independent religion
she had no concern. To Jew, Moslem, Buddhist, and Pagan, and to
the savages of the New World, when it came presently to be
discovered, she accorded the fullest religious freedom.</p>
<p>To appreciate this, it is but necessary to consider such
enactments as those of Honorius III for the protection of the
Jews, of Clement VI, who threatened their persecutors with
excommunication, and the action of Pope and Archbishop in the
case of the inflammatory sermons of Hernando Martinez. It is
sufficient to consider that when the Jews were driven out of
Spain&mdash;as shall presently be seen&mdash;they actually found
a refuge in Rome itself, and were received with kindliness by
Pope Alexander VI (Roderigo Borgia), which in itself is one of
the oddest ironies that ecclesiastical history can offer.</p>
<p>And if this is not sufficient, let us for a moment consider
the immunity and comparative peace enjoyed by the Jews who dwelt
in Rome itself, in their district of Trastevere.</p>
<p>They were a recognized section of the community in the Papal
City. On his coronation procession each Pope would pause near the
Campo de' Fiori to receive the company of Jews that came, headed
by the Rabbi, to pay homage to their sovereign&mdash;precisely as
their ancestors had come to pay homage to the emperor.</p>
<p>To the Vicar of Christ the Rabbi would now proffer the rolls
of the Pentateuch, swathed in a cloth . The Pope would take them
into his hands, to show that he respected the law contained in
them, and would then put them behind him, to signify that this
law now belonged to the past. From behind the Pontiff the Rabbi
would receive back his sacred scriptures, and depart with his
escort, usually accompanied by the jeers, insults, and
vituperations of the Roman populace.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Gregorovius, "Geschichte der Stadt
Rom," bk. ix. cap. ii.]</p>
<p>It will be understood, then, that the Inquisition's
establishment in Spain was not urged for the purpose of
persecuting the Jews. It had no concern with Jews, if we confine
the term purely to its religious meaning, signifying the
observers of the law of Moses. Its concern was entirely with the
apostasy of those who, although of the Jewish race, had become
Christians by conversion. By the subsequent secret re-Judaizings,
or return of these New-Christians to the religion of their
fathers (which they had abandoned out of material
considerations), they came within the jurisdiction of the
Inquisition, and rendered themselves liable to prosecution as
heretics, a prosecution which could never have overtaken them had
they but continued in their original faith.</p>
<p>There is no denying that many of those who had been baptized
against their will, as the only means of saving their lives when
the fury of the Christian mob was unleashed against them, had
remained Jews at heart, had continued in secret to practise the
Jewish rites, and were exerting themselves to bring back to the
fold of Israel their apostate brethren. Others, however, upon
receiving baptism may have determined to keep the law to which
they now pledged themselves and to persevere honestly in
Christianity. Yet many of the old Jewish observances were become
habitual with them: the trained&mdash;almost the
hereditary&mdash;repugnance to certain meats, the observance of
certain feast days, and several minor domestic laws that are part
of the Jewish code, were too deeply implanted in them to be
plucked up by the roots at the first attempt. Time was required
in which they could settle into Christian habits; two or three
generations might be necessary in some families before these
habits came to be perfectly acquired and the old ones to be
entirely obliterated. Had those who urged the Sovereigns to
introduce the Inquisition into Castile, or had the Sovereigns
themselves but perceived this and exercised the necessary and
reasonable patience in the matter, Spain might have been spared
the horrors that took root in her soil and sapped the vigour and
intellectual energy of her children, so that in her case
decadence pressed swift and close upon the very heels of supreme
achievement.</p>
<p>Execrable as is the memory of the Inquisition to all the
world, to none should be it so execrable as to Spain, since the
evil that it wrought recoiled entirely upon herself.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It was on the occasion of Isabella's first visit to
Seville&mdash;that punitive visit already mentioned&mdash;that
the establishment of the Holy Office in Spain was first proposed
to her. The King was at the time in Estremadura upon the business
of fortifying his frontiers against Portugal.</p>
<p>The proposal came from Alonso de Ojeda, the Prior of the
Dominicans of Seville, a man who enjoyed great credit and was
reputed saintly ("vir plus ac sanctus," Paramo calls him).</p>
<p>Seeing her zeal to put down lawlessness and to purify and
restore order to the country, Ojeda urged upon her notice the
spread of the detestable Judaizing movement that was toward. He
laid stress upon the hypocrisy that had underlain so many of the
conversions of the Jews. He pointed out&mdash;with some degree of
justice&mdash;that these men had made a mock of the Holy Church,
had defiled her sacraments, and had perpetrated the most
abominable sacrilege by their pretended acceptance of the
Christian faith. He urged that not only must this be punished,
but that the havoc which these Judaizers were working among the
more faithful New-Christians, and the proselytizing which they
went so far as to attempt among OldChristians, must be
checked.</p>
<p>To carry out this urgently-required purification, he implored
the Queen to establish the Inquisition.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Pulgar, "Chronica," II. cap, lxxvi.]</p>
<p>There was a speciousness, and even a justice, in his arguments
which must have impressed that pious lady. But her piety, intense
as it was, did not carry her to the lengths required of her by
her priestly counsellor. The balance of her splendid mind was
singularly true. She perceived that here was matter that called
for a remedy; but she perceived also the fanaticism inspiring the
friar who stood before her, and realized how his fanaticism must
exaggerate the evil.</p>
<p>She was aware also of the extreme malevolence of which the
New-Christians were the object. By their conversion they might
have deflected the religious hostility of the Castilians; but the
more deeply-rooted racial antagonism remained. It not only
remained, but it was quickened by the envy which these
NewChristians were exciting. The energy and intelligence inherent
in men of their race were serving them now, as they had served
them before, to their undoing. There were no offices of eminence
in which New-Christians were not to be found; there were none in
which they did not outnumber the Old-Christians&mdash;the
pure-blooded Castilians.</p>
<p>This the Queen knew, for she was herself surrounded by
converts and the descendants of converts. Several of her
counsellors, her three secretaries&mdash;one of whom was that
chronicler, Pulgar, whose record of the situation has been
quoted&mdash;and her very treasurer were all New-Christians.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* In "Claros Varones de España," Pulgar says
that even in the veins of her sometime confessor, Frey Juan de
Torquemada, Cardinal of San Sisto, there was a strain of Jewish
blood. But the authority is insufficient, and Pulgar, himself a
New-Christian, is perhaps anxious to include as many illustrious
men of his day as possible in the New-Christian ranks. Zurita, on
the other hand, says that the Cardinal's nephew, Fr. Thomas de
Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor, was of "clean blood"&mdash;de
limpia linaje (lib. xx. cap. xlix.). The term "clean" in this
connection arose out of the popular conception that the blood of
a Jew was a dark-hued fluid, distinguishable from the bright red
blood of the Christian.]</p>
<p>These men Isabella knew intimately, and esteemed. Judging the
New-Christians generally by those in her immediate service, she
was naturally led to discount Ojeda's imputations against them.
She perceived the source of these imputations, and she must have
taken into consideration the ineradicable bitterness of the
popular feeling against Jews and the intensity of a prejudice
which extended&mdash;as we have said&mdash;to the New-Christians
to such an extent that they continued to be known as "Judios,"
notwithstanding their conversion, so that often in contemporary
chronicles it is difficult to determine to which class the writer
is referring.</p>
<p>We have said that, in spite of conversions, the racial
hostility remained. The Christian attitude towards the Hebrew had
not changed in the hundred years that were sped since, under the
incitings of the Archdeacon of Ecija, the mob had risen up and
massacred them. They were the descendants of the crucifiers
always.</p>
<p>A vestige of this feeling lingers to this day in the
peninsula. In the vocabulary of the Portuguese lower orders, and
even of the indifferently educated, there is no such word as
"cruel." "Jew" is the term that has entirely usurped its
functions, and as an injunction against cruelty to man or beast,
"Don't be a Jew!" (<i>Não seja judeu!</i>) is still the only
phrase.</p>
<p>No conception of what was the popular feeling at the time can
be conveyed more adequately than by a translation of the passage
from Bernaldez concerning the manners and customs of the Jews.
Bernaldez was a priest, and therefore, to some extent, an
educated man&mdash;as in the main his history bears
witness&mdash;yet a piece of writing so ludicrously stupid and
detestably malicious as this passage can only have emanated from
a mind in which bigotry had destroyed all sense of
proportion.</p>
<p>The only historical value of the passage lies in the
deplorable fact that undoubtedly it may be accepted as a faithful
mirror of the prejudice that existed in Isabella's day.</p>
<p>It runs:</p>
<blockquote>"Just as heretics and Jews have always fled from
Christian doctrines, so they have always fled from Christian
customs. They are great drinkers and gluttons, who never lose the
Jewish habit of eating garbage of onions and garlic fried in oil,
and of meat stewed in oil, which they use instead of lard; and
oil with meat is a thing that smells very badly, so that their
houses and doorways stink vilely of that garbage; and they have
the peculiar smell of Jews in consequence of their food and of
the fact that they are not baptized. And although some have been
baptized, yet the virtue of the baptism having been annulled by
their credulity [i.e. their adherence to their own faith] and by
their Judaizing, they stink like Jews. They will not eat pork
save under compulsion. They eat meat in Lent and on the eve of
feast days...They keep the Passover and the Sabbath as best they
can. They send oil to the synagogues for the lamps. Jews come to
preach to them in their houses secretly&mdash;especially to the
women, very secretly They have Rabbis to slaughter their beasts
and poultry. They eat unleavened bread in the Jewish season. They
perform all their Jewish rites as much in secret as possible, and
women as well as men seek whenever possible to avoid the
sacraments of Holy Church...They never confess truthfully, and it
happened that a priest, once confessing one of these, cut a
fragment of cloth from his garment, saying: 'As you have never
sinned, let me have this as a relic to heal the sick.'...Not
without reason did Our Lord call them <i>generatio prava et
adultera</i>. They do not believe that God rewards virginity and
chastity, and all their endeavour is to multiply. And in the days
of the strength of this heresy many monasteries were violated by
their merchants and wealthy men, and many professed nuns were
ravished and derided, they not believing in or fearing
excommunication, but rather doing this to vituperate Jesus Christ
and the Church. Commonly swindling people by many wiles and
cheats, as in buying and selling, they have no conscience where
Christians are concerned. Never would they undertake agriculture,
ploughing or tilling or raising cattle, nor have they ever taught
their children any office but that of sitting down to earn enough
to eat by as little labour as possible. Many of them have raised
up great estates in a few years, not being sparing of their
thieving and usury, maintaining that they earn it from their
enemies..."*</blockquote>

<p>This atrocious tissue of misrepresentation would be utterly
negligible and contemptible were it not for the fact&mdash;as has
been said&mdash;that it was written in good faith (the good faith
of a bigot) and reflects what was currently believed, fostered by
the envy which is plainly revealed when Bernaldez alludes to the
occupations of the Jews and the New-Christians&mdash;all of whom
he assumes to be false to the faith they have embraced.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">SEVILLE.<br>
From Colmenar's "Délices d'Espagne."</p>
<p>Isabella must have been conscious of this feeling, and she
must have rated it at its proper value. She had received in 1474
a very pitiful narrative poem of the New-Christian Anton Montoro,
which painted with terrible vividness a slaughter of the
<i>conversos</i> and implored justice upon the assassins,
protesting the innocence of the New-Christians and the sincerity
of their conversions. Her gentle nature must have been moved to
compassion by that lament, and her acute mind must have perceived
the evil passions and the envy that were stirring under the fair
cloak of saintly zeal.</p>
<p>All these considerations being weighed, she resisted the
representations of Ojeda.</p>
<p>But weightier than any may have been the reflection of the
power which the tribunal of the Inquisition must place in the
hands of the clergy. Already and very bravely she had expressed
her resentment of clerical usurpation of royal rights in Spain,
and to repress it she had not hesitated to front the Pope himself
If she acceded now to Ojeda's request, she would be permitting
the priesthood to set up a court which, not being subject to any
temporal law, must alienate from her some portion of that
sovereignty which so jealously she guarded.</p>
<p>Thus she came to dismiss the petition of the Dominican, and
there can be little doubt when all the circumstances are
considered&mdash;as presently they shall be&mdash;that in this
she had the entire support of the Cardinal of Spain, Don Pedro
Gonzalez de Mendoza, Archbishop of Seville, who was with her at
the time.</p>
<p>Ojeda withdrew, baffled, but by no means resigned. He awaited
a more favourable season, what time he kept the popular feeling
in a state of ferment. And no sooner had Ferdinand come to rejoin
his Queen in Seville than the Dominican renewed his
importunities.</p>
<p>He hoped to find an ally in the King. Moreover he was now
supported by Fr. Filippo de' Barberi, the Sicilian Inquisitor.
The latter had newly arrived in Spain, where he came to seek at
the hands of the Catholic Sovereigns&mdash;who were rulers of
Sicily&mdash;the confirmation of an ancient decree promulgated in
1223 by the Emperor Frederic II. By virtue of this decree
one-third of the confiscated property of heretics became the
perquisite of the Inquisition; and it also ordained that the
governors of all districts should afford protection to the
inquisitors and assistance in their work of prosecuting heretics
and any Jew who might have contracted marriage with a
Christian.</p>
<p>These privileges the Sovereigns duly confirmed, accounting it
their duty to do so since they related to the Inquisition as
established by Honorius III. But not on that account did Isabella
yet lean towards the introduction of the tribunal into
Castile.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that to the arguments of Ojeda and
Barberi were added the persuasions of the papal legate <i>a
latere</i> at the court of Castile&mdash;Nicolao Franco, Bishop
of Trevisa&mdash;who conceived, no doubt, that the institution of
the Inquisition here would be pleasing to Pope Sixtus IV, since
it must increase the authority of the Church in Spain.</p>
<p>To Ferdinand it is probable that the suggestion was not
without allurement, since it must have offered him a way at once
to gratify the piety that was his, and&mdash;out of the
confiscations that must ensue from the prosecution of so very
wealthy a section of the community&mdash;to replenish the almost
exhausted coffers of the treasury. When the way of conscience is
also the way of profit, there is little difficulty in following
it. But, after all, though joint sovereign of Spain and paramount
in Aragon, Ferdinand had not in Castile the power of Isabella. It
was her kingdom when all was said, and although his position
there was by no means that of a simple prince-consort, yet he was
bound by law and by policy to remain submissive to her will. In
view of her attitude, he could do little more than add his own to
the persuasions of the three priestly advocates, and amongst them
they so pressed Isabella that she gave way to the extent of a
compromise.</p>
<p>She consented that steps should be taken not only to check the
Judaizing of the New-Christians, but also to effect conversions
among the Jews themselves; and she entrusted the difficult task
of enforcing the observance of the Christian faith and the
Catholic dogmas to the Cardinal of Spain&mdash;than whom, from a
Christian and humanitarian point of view, no man of his day could
have been more desirable, which is as much as to say that from
the point of view of his Catholic contemporaries no man could
have been less so.</p>
<p>Isabella's announcement of her determination in the matter
must have come as something of a shock to Ojeda, who conceived
himself on the way to prevail with her. This concession to his
wishes was far from being the concession that he sought, since it
passed over the heads of the preaching friars, who had made such
work&mdash;by their own methods&mdash;their special mission.</p>
<p>The Queen, however, had decided, and there was no more to be
said. The Cardinal of Spain went about his task in that sincere
Christian spirit and with that zeal for truth and justice that is
associated with his name. He compiled for the purpose of his
mission an <i>instrucción</i>, which has not survived, but which
Ortiz de Zuñiga* and Pulgar** inform us was in the form of a
catechism.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Anales," lib. xii. año 1478.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** "Chronica," II. cap. lxxvii.]</p>
<p>In this "he indicates," says Pulgar, "the duties of the true
Christian from the day of his birth, in the sacrament of baptism
as in all other sacraments which it is his obligation to receive,
as well as what he should be taught, what believe and what
perform as a faithful Christian at all times and on all days
until the day of his death."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Mariana, Zurita, and other historians, upon the word of
Paramo* and of Salazar de Mendoza, have ventured to ascribe the
establishment of the Inquisition in Castile to the Cardinal of
Spain. Their object in so doing has been to heap honour and glory
upon his name and memory; for in their opinion he could have had
no greater claim than this to the gratitude and reverence of
humanity. But the justice of a less bigoted age demands that
truth shall prevail in this respect, and that his memory be
deprived of that very questionable honour. The Cardinal's
contemporaries do not justify what Paramo claims for him. And, to
reduce the argument to its lowest plane, it would have been
extremely unlikely that Cardinal Mendoza should advocate the
establishment of a court that must deprive him and the other
Spanish bishops of the jurisdiction in <i>causas de Fé</i>
hitherto vested in themselves.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "De Origine et Progressu Sanctae
Inquisitionis," lib. ii, tit. ii. cap. iii.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The Primate pursued, then, the task imposed upon him, causing
his "catechism" to be expounded and taught by all parish priests
in all pulpits and schools.</p>
<p>But however zealous his methods, they were not the methods
desired by Ojeda and the papal legate. The Dominican, vexed by
the turn of events, and determined to return to the assault as
soon as ever occasion offered, cast about him for fres"h
arguments that should prevail with the Sovereigns.</p>
<p>And then there befell an incident in Seville to supply his
fanatical needs and place in his hands the very weapon that he
sought.</p>
<p>A young nobleman of the famous house of Guzman had engaged in
an amorous intrigue with the daughter of a New-Christian. In the
pursuit of this amour he repaired secretly to her father's house
on the night of Thursday in Holy Week of that year 1478, and was
admitted by the girl. But the lovers being disturbed by voices in
the house, Guzman was driven to conceal himself. From his
concealment he overheard the conversation of several Judaizers
who were being entertained by the father of his mistress. He
heard them vehemently denying the divinity of Christ and as
vehemently blaspheming His name and the Holy Faith.</p>
<p>Having quitted the house, he went straight to the Prior of the
Dominicans to relate what he had overheard and to denounce the
blasphemers.</p>
<p>This young Castilian is so very interesting a type that a
slight digression to consider him more closely may be permitted.
It is of assistance to understand the mental attitude, the crass
complacency of the bigot. He knew that the highest virtue that a
Christian could practise was the virtue of chastity, and,
conversely, that the worst offence against God into which he
could fall was that of unchastity. Or at least he had been taught
these things, and he accepted them in a sub-conscious, automatic
sort of way. Yet since the sin was his own, it gave his
consciousness no uneasiness that he should perpetrate it, that he
should slink like a thief into the house of this New-Christian to
debauch his daughter. But let him hear this NewChristian or his
friends express opinions of disbelief in this God whom he
believed in and&mdash;by his own lights&mdash;insulted, and
behold him outraged in all his feelings against those unspeakable
fellows. Behold him running hot-foot to Prior Ojeda to relate
with horror the tale of this vileness that he had overheard, so
little concerned about the vileness through which he himself had
acquired his knowledge that he makes no effort to conceal it.
And, apparently, the Dominican, in a like horror at the
New-Christians' offence against a God in whom they do not
believe, accounts of little moment the Castilian's offence
against the God in whom he does believe.</p>
<p>It is a nice illumination of the contrast between the theory
and the practice of Christianity.</p>
<p>Upon the young man's information Ojeda instituted an inquiry,
and six Judaizers were arrested. They confessed their guilt, and
begged to be reconciled to the Church. As the Inquisition had not
yet been established, with its terrible decree against
"relapsos,"* their prayer was granted, after the fulfilment of
the penance imposed.**</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The "relapsos"&mdash;of whom we shall hear
more presently&mdash;were those who, having been converted to
Christianity, were guilty of relapsing into Judaism.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," lib. ii. tit. ii.
cap. iii.; Zuñiga, "Anales," 1477.]</p>
<p>With the tale of this "execrable wickedness" Ojeda repaired at
once to Cordova, whither the Sovereigns had by now withdrawn. The
story would lose nothing in its repetition by this pious and
saintly man, and he was in a position to add to it that the good
folk of Seville were almost in revolt from indignation at that
happening in their midst.</p>
<p>Having shown thus how urgently it was required, he once more
implored the Sovereigns to establish the Inquisition. And it is
not to be doubted that his petition would be backed by that of
the legate Franco, who was at the Court.</p>
<p>Yet Isabella still showed repugnance, still hesitated to
consent to the extreme course advocated.</p>
<p>But at this moment, according to Llorente,* another advocate
appears upon the scene to plead the cause of the Faith&mdash;a
figure in the white habit and black cloak of the Dominican
Brotherhood, a man in his fifty-eighth year, tall and gaunt and
stooping slightly at the shoulders, mild-eyed, of a cast of
countenance that is gentle, noble, and benign.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Anales" cap. ii. 10.]</p>
<p>This is Frey Tomás de Torquemada, Prior of the Dominican
Convent of Holy Cross of Segovia, the nephew of the late
illustrious Juan de Torquemada, Cardinal of San Sisto.</p>
<p>His influence with the Queen is vast; his eloquence fiery; his
mental energy compelling. Ojeda looks on, and his hopes grow
confident at last.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-07" name="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII. THE PRIOR OF HOLY
CROSS</h2>
<p>If ever a name held the omen of a man's life, that name is
Torquemada. To such an extraordinary degree is it instinct with
the suggestion of the machinery of fire and torture over which he
was destined to preside, that it almost seems a fictitious name,
a <i>nom de guerre</i>, a grim invention, compounded of the Latin
<i>torque</i> and the Spanish <i>quemada</i>, to fit the man who
was to hold the office of Grand Inquisitor.</p>
<p>It was derived from the northern town of Torquemada (the Turre
Cremata of the Romans), where the illustrious family had its
beginnings. This family first sprang into historical distinction
with the knighting by Alfonso XI of Lope Alonso de Torquemada
(<i>Hijodalgo a los Fueros de Castilla</i>), and thereafter was
maintained in prominence by several members who held more or less
distinguished offices. But the most illustrious bearer of the
name was the cultured Dominican Juan de Torquemada (Lope Alonso's
great-grandson), who was raised to the purple with the title of
Cardinal of San Sisto. He was one of the most learned, eminent,
and respected theologians of his age, an upholder of the dogma of
the Immaculate Conception, and the most ardent champion since
Thomas Aquinas of the doctrine of papal infallibility. He
enriched theological literature by several works, the best known
of which is his "Meditations."</p>
<p>Fr. Tomás de Torquemada was the son of the Cardinal's only
brother, Pero Fernandez de Torquemada. He was born at Valladolid
in 1420, and after a scholastic career of some
distinction&mdash;if Garcia Rodrigo is to be believed in this
particular*&mdash;he followed in his uncle's footsteps,
soliciting the habit of the Order of St. Dominic, which he
assumed in the Convent of St. Paul of Valladolid upon completing
his studies of philosophy and divinity, and receiving a doctor's
degree.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Verdadera de la Inquisicion," by
D. F. J. G. Rodrigo, vol. ii. p. III. This history is to be read
with the greatest caution. It is an attempt to justify the
Inquisition and to combat Llorente's writings; in his endeavours
to achieve this object the author is a little reckless and
negligent of exactitude.]</p>
<p>He filled with distinction the chair of canon law and
theology, and in the fullness of time was elected Prior of the
Convent of Santa Cruz of Segovia. He so distinguished himself in
the discharge of the duties of this office by his piety, his
learning, and his zeal, that he was repeatedly re-elected, there
being at the time no rule of the order to inhibit it. Such was
the austerity of his character that he never ate meat, or used
linen either in his clothing or on his bed.* He observed the rule
of poverty imposed by his order so rigorously that he was unable
to provide his only sister with an endowment suitable to her
station, and could allow her no more than would permit her to

<p>At what epoch the Prior of Holy Cross first became the
confessor of the Infanta Isabella it is not now possible to
ascertain, Jaime Bleda tells us that in the fulfilment of this
office he had extracted from her, during her youth at the Court
of her brother King Henry IV, a promise that should she ever come
to the throne she would devote her life to the extirpation of
heresy from her realm.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Coronica de los Moros de España," p.
879.]</p>
<p>This may be dismissed as one of those popular fictions that
arise concerning the intimate affairs of princes, for it cannot
be said that it is borne out by the circumstances under
consideration.</p>
<p>Isabella's reluctance to proceed to extreme&mdash;or even
vigorous&mdash;measures against those of her subjects accused of
Judaizing is admitted by every serious student of her reign,
however opinions may vary as to the motives that swayed her in
this course.</p>
<p>There remains, however, out of Bleda's anecdote, the fact that
Torquemada had been Isabella's confessor in early
years&mdash;which in itself bears out the statement that the
Dominican had achieved distinction. It follows by virtue of his
having occupied this office that he must have acquired over the
mind of a woman so devout a considerable ascendancy where matters
connected with the Faith were concerned.</p>
<p>This influence he came now to exert.</p>
<p>To support it he brought an indubitable sincerity and
disinterestedness of motives; he brought a reputation for
sanctity derived from the rigid purity of his life and the stern
asceticism which he practised&mdash;a reputation which could not
fail to act upon the imagination of a woman of Isabella's pious
temperament; and, finally, he brought the dominant, masterful
personality and the burning eloquence that were his own.</p>
<p>When all this is taken into account it is not surprising that
the Queen's resistance, weakened already by the onslaughts of
Ojeda and his associates, the King and the papal legate, should
at last have broken down; and that under the compelling
persuasion of the Prior of Holy Cross she should reluctantly have
consented to the establishment of the Holy Office in her
dominions.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Thus it befell that by order of the Catholic Sovereigns their
Orator at the Pontifical Court, D. Francisco de Santillana,
applied to Sixtus IV for a bull that should empower Ferdinand and
Isabella to set up the tribunal of the Inquisition in Castile, to
enable them&mdash;as Bernaldez puts it&mdash;to proceed to the
extirpation of heresy "by the way of fire"&mdash;<i>por via del
fuego</i>.</p>
<p>This bull was duly granted under date of November 7, 1478.</p>
<p>It gave the Sovereigns the faculty of electing three bishops
or archbishops or other God-fearing and upright priests, regular
or secular, of over forty years ot age, who must be masters or
bachelors of divinity and doctors or licentiates of canon law, to
make inquisition throughout the kingdom against heretics,
apostates, and their abettors.</p>
<p>His Holiness accorded to the men so elected the requisite
jurisdiction to proceed according to law and custom, and he
further empowered the Sovereigns to annul such nominations as
they might make and to replace their nominees as they saw
fit.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," cap. ii. § 14.]</p>
<p>The Sovereigns were in Cordova when the bull reached them in
the following month of December. But they did not at once proceed
to act upon it. Before doing so, Isabella made one last effort to
repress the Judaizing and apostatizing movement by the gentler
measures concerted with the Cardinal of Spain in 1477.</p>
<p>To the task of continuing with increased vigour the teachings
of the "catechism" drawn up by Mendoza she now appointed Diego
Alonso de Solis, Bishop of Cadiz, D. Diego de Merlo, Coadjutor of
Seville, and Alonso de Ojeda, to whom these royal orders must
have been a fresh source of disappointment and chagrin.</p>
<p>Torquemada, we must assume, had withdrawn once more to his
convent of Segovia, and perhaps the removal of his stern
influence enabled the Queen to make this last effort to avoid the
course to which he had all but constrained her.</p>
<p>Having concluded these arrangements, the Sovereigns repaired
to Toledo. There, in the spring of the year 1480, the Cortes
assembled to make oath of fealty to the infant Prince of Asturias
to whom Isabella had given birth in June of 1478. Whilst this
oath was the chief motive of the assembly, it was by no means the
only business with which it had to deal. Many other matters
received attention; amongst them the necessity for remedying the
evils arising out of the commerce between Christians and Jews was
seriously considered.</p>
<p>It was decreed that the old laws concerning the Jews, which
lately had been falling into partial desuetude, should be
re-enforced, particularly those which prescribed that all Jews
should wear the distinguishing badge of the circlet of red cloth
on the shoulders of their gabardines; that they should keep
strictly to their Juderias, always retiring to these at
nightfall; that walls to enclose these Juderias should be erected
wherever they might still be wanting, and that no Jew should
practise as a doctor, surgeon, apothecary, or innkeeper.</p>
<p>Beyond that, however, the Cortes did not go; and the
institution of the Inquisition to deal with Judaizers was not so
much as mentioned, which circumstance Llorente accepts as a
further proof of the Queen's antipathy to the Holy Office.</p>
<p>Coming at a time when the Jews were once more beginning to
taste the sweets of freedom, there can be little doubt that these
provisions, which thrust them back into bondage and ignominy,
must have been extremely galling to them. It is possible that
these measures against the men of his race spurred a NewChristian
to the rash step of publishing a pamphlet in which he criticized
and censured the royal action in the matter. Carried away by his
feelings, the writer&mdash;intentionally or not&mdash;fell into
heresy in the course of his writings, to which the Jeronymite
monk, Hernando de Talavera, published a reply.</p>
<p>Rodrigo* assumes that this heretical pamphlet put an end to
the Queen's patience. It may very well have been the case, or at
least it may have afibrded Ferdinand and the others who desired
the Inquisition a final argument whereby to overcome what
reluctance still lingered with her.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Verdadera," ii. p. 71]</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it was very soon after this&mdash;September
27, 1480&mdash;that the Sovereigns, who at the time were at
Medina del Campo, acted at last upon the papal bull which had now
been in their hands for nearly two years, and delegated their
faculty of giving inquisitors to Castile to the Cardinal of Spain
and Fr. Tomás de Torquemada.</p>
<p>Mendoza and Torquemada proceeded at once to carry out the task
entrusted to them, and appointed as inquisitors of the faith for
Seville&mdash;where Judaizing was represented to be most
flagrant&mdash;the Dominican friars Juan de San Martino and
Miguel Morillo. The latter was the Provincial of the Dominicans
of Aragon, and was already a person of experience in such
matters, having acted as inquisitor in Rousillon. To assist them
in the discharge of their office, the secular priest Juan Ruiz de
Medina, a doctor of canon law, and Juan Lopez de Barco, one of
the Queen's chaplains, were appointed, the former to the position
of assessor, the latter to that of fiscal.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It is necessary, in view of the much that has been written,
and although the danger be incurred of labouring the point, to
examine more closely the attitude of the Sovereigns towards the
tribunal which they now sanctioned.</p>
<p>Isabella's zeal, both pious and political, urged her, as has
been said, to proceed in such a way as should set a term to the
unrest arising out of the public feeling against Judaizers and
apostatizing Moriscoes (baptized Moors). Ferdinand not only
shared her feelings, but pious zeal in him went to the lengths of
bigotry, and he aimed essentially at a political unity that
should be inseparably allied and interwoven with religious
unity.</p>
<p>Isabella would have laboured slowly, preferring, even at the
sacrifice of time, to achieve her ends by gentle means and the
exercise of that patience which was so very necessary if good
results were to be obtained. Ferdinand, perhaps less pitiful,
perhaps&mdash;to do him full justice&mdash;less hopeful of the
power of argument and indoctrination, lending an ear to the
priestly assertion "contra negantes veritatis nulla est
disputatio," would have proceeded at once to the introduction
into Castile of the stern repressive measures already being
exerted in his native Aragon.</p>
<p>On the score of their different attitudes the Sovereigns might
have found themselves in conflict, but that in this matter they
had a ground of common interest. Both were agreed that in no case
should Spain be brought under the ecclesiastical sway which the
establishment of the usual form of Inquisition must set up. If
this were to be&mdash;as usual hitherto&mdash;under pontifical
control, its officers would be appointed by the Pope, or,
vicariously, by the Dominican provincials, and a proportion of
the confiscations consequent upon conviction would be gathered
into the pontifical coffers.</p>
<p>For all his bigotry and his desire to see the Holy Office
instituted in Castile, Ferdinand was as averse as Isabella to its
introduction in a form that must restore the clerical usurpations
they had been at such pains to repress.</p>
<p>If Isabella admitted the Inquisition as a last means of
quelling the disturbing elements in her kingdom, it must be an
Inquisition on lines entirely different from those which hitherto
had obtained elsewhere. The appointment of its officers must no
more rest with the Pope than the bestowal of Spanish benefices.
It must be the prerogative of the Sovereigns themselves, and it
must carry with it the power to depose and replace, where
necessary, such inquisitors as they might appoint. Further, Rome
must have no share in the property confiscated from Spanish
subjects, the disposal of this being entirely controlled by the
Sovereigns.</p>
<p>It has been argued that here was the cause of all Isabella's
hesitancy: that greed and statecraft were the mainsprings of her
conduct in the matter, and that humanitarian considerations had
no part in it; that the bull had been applied for earlier than
has been generally supposed, and that the delay had resulted from
the Pope's disinclination to grant any such terms as were
demanded.</p>
<p>The latter statement may not be without foundation. But to say
deliberately that no humanitarian considerations governed the
Queen's conduct is to say a great deal more than the
circumstances warrant. To estabhsh this hypothesis it would be
necessary to advance some adequate reason for her reluctance to
act upon the bull when once it was in her hands. For the bull of
November 1478 conceded all that the Sovereigns demanded, all that
they desired. Yet Isabella allowed nearly two years to pass
before proceeding to exercise the faculties conferred by it, and
during that time Cardinal Mendoza and his cooperators diligently
pursued the work of effecting conversions by means of his
"catechism."</p>
<p>The conclusion that this was dictated by humane considerations
on the part of the Queen is the only one that appears reasonable,
nor is any alternative put forward to account for the delay of
nearly two years.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>When the Cardinal of Spain and the Prior of Holy Cross, acting
jointly on behalf of the Sovereigns, appointed the first
inquisitors for Castile, they instructed these to set up a
tribunal in Seville, which of all the cities of Spain was the one
where Judaizing was alleged to be most flagrantly conducted.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Mendoza, "Monarquia de España," iii. p.
336. Bleda says that there were 100,000 apostates in that diocese
("Coronica de los Moros," p. 880).]</p>
<p>The Sovereigns issued on October 9 a command to all loyal
subjects to afford the two inquisitors every assistance they
might require on their journey to Seville and all facilities
there for carrying out their mission.</p>
<p>The subjects, however, were so little loyal on this occasion
that upon the arrival of the inquisitors at Seville, these found
a reception of all solemnity awaiting them and every respect
accorded to them, but no assistance. To such an extent was this
withheld that they found it quite impossible to set about the
business upon which they came. They complained of this state of
things to the King, and as a result he sent special orders on
December 27 to the Coadjutor of Seville and the civil authorities
of the district, commanding them to lend the inquisitors every
support.</p>
<p>In consequence of this they were at last enabled to establish
their court and proceed to the business upon which they
came.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Zuñiga, "Anales," lib. xii, año 1480.]</p>
<p>The very rumour of their approach had filled the
New-Christians with anxiety, and a glimpse of the gloomy funereal
pageant&mdash;the white-robed, blackhooded inquisitors, with
their attendant familiars and barefoot friars, the procession
headed by a Dominican carrying the white cross&mdash;on its way
to the Convent of St. Paul, where they took up their quarters,
was enough to put to flight some thousands of those who had cause
to fear that they might become the objects of the attention of
that fearful court.</p>
<p>These fugitives sought refuge in the feudal lordships of the
Duke of Medina Sidonia, of the formidable Rodrigo Ponce de Leon,
Marquis of Cadiz, and of the Count of Arcos.</p>
<p>But in all ages it had been the way of the Inquisition not
only to suspect readily, but to allow suspicion to usurp the
place that elsewhere is reserved for proof. And so they proceeded
to construe into evidence of guilt this flight of the timorous,
as is shown by the edict they published on January 2 of 1481.</p>
<p>In this&mdash;having set forth their appointment by the
Sovereigns, and the terms of the bull under which such
appointment had been made&mdash;they announced that, inasmuch as
it had come to their knowledge that many persons had departed out
of Seville in fear of prosecution upon grounds of heretical
pravity, they commanded the Marquess of Cadiz, the Count of
Arcos, and the other nobles of the Kingdom of Castile, that
within fifteen days of the publication of this edict they should
make an exact account of the persons of both sexes that had
sought refuge in their lordships or jurisdictions; that they
should arrest all these and bring them safely to the prison of
the Inquisition in Seville, confiscating their property and
placing this together with an inventory in the hands of some
person of trust, to be held by them at the disposal of the
inquisitors; that none should dare to shelter any fugitive, but
comply exactly with the terms of this edict under pain of greater
excommunication and the other penalties by law established
against abettors of heretics, amongst which penalties was that of
the annulment of their dignities and offices, their subjects and
vassals being absolved of all vassalage and subjection; and the
inquisitors reserved to themselves and their superiors the power
of absolution from the ecclesiastical censure incurred by all who
might fail to obey the terms of this edict.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-08" name="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE HOLY OFFICE
IN SEVILLE</h2>
<p>The stern purpose of the inquisitors and the severity with
which they intended to proceed were plainly revealed by that
edict of January 2, 1481. The harsh injustice that lay in its
call upon the authorities to arrest men and women merely because
they had departed from Seville before departure was in any way
forbidden is typical of the flagrantly arbitrary methods of the
Inquisition. That it should have struck terror into the
New-Christians who had remained in Seville, and that it should
have moved them to take measures to protect themselves against a
court in which justice seemed little likely to be observed, and
to whose cruel mercies the most innocent might find himself
exposed at any moment, is not surprising&mdash;particularly when
it is considered how great was the number of NewChristians who
occupied positions of eminence in Seville.</p>
<p>A group of these prominent citizens assembled at the
invitation of Diego de Susan, one of the wealthiest and most
influential men of Seville, whose fortune was estimated at ten
million maravedis. They came together to consider what measures
should be taken for the defence of themselves, their persons and
property, from the unscrupulous activities of this tribunal, and
they determined that if necessary they would resort to force.</p>
<p>Among those who entered into this conspiracy were some
ecclesiastics, and several who held office under the Crown, such
as the Governor of Triana, Juan Fernandez Abolafio, the Captain
of Justice and farmer of the royal customs, his brother Fernandez
the licentiate, Bartolomé Torralba, and the wealthy and
well-connected Manuel Sauli.</p>
<p>Susan addressed them. He reminded them that they were the
principal citizens of Seville, that they were wealthy not only in
property but in the good-will of the people, and that it but
required resolution and solidarity on their part to enable them
to prevail against the inquisitors in the event of these friars
making any attempt upon them.</p>
<p>All concurring, it was concerted that each of the conspirators
should engage himself to provide a proportion of the men, arms,
and money and what else might be necessary for their purpose.</p>
<p>But Susan to his undoing had a daughter. This girl, whose
beauty was so extraordinary that she was surnamed <i>la hermosa
fembra</i>, had taken a Castilian lover. What motives may have
actuated her, what part the lover may have played in these, does
not transpire. All that is known is that she betrayed the
conspiracy to the inquisitors&mdash;"impiously violating the
natural laws engraved by God's finger upon the human heart."</p>
<p>Susan and his unfortunate confederates were seized as a
consequence of that infamous delation; they were lodged in the
cells of the Convent of St. Paul, which meanwhile did duty as a
prison, and brought to trial before the Court of the Holy Office
sitting in the convent.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Bernaldez, cap. xliv.; Garcia Rodrigo, i.
cap. xx.; Amador de los Rios, "Historia de los Judios," lib. iii.
cap. v.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Amador de los Rios adds in a foot-note, on the score of this
girl: "Don Reginaldo Rubino, Bishop of Tiberiades, informed of
the delation and of the state of la Fermosa Fembra, contrived
that she should enter one of the convents of the city to take the
veil. But dominated by her sensual passions, she quitted the
convent without professing, and bore several children. Her beauty
having been dissipated by age, want overtook the unnatural
daughter of the miUionaire Diego de Susan, and in the end she
died under the protection of a grocer. In her will she disposed
that her skull should be placed over the doorway of the house in
which she had pursued her evil life as an example and in
punishment of her sins. This house is situated in the Calle de
Atatld, opposite to its entrance from the direction of the
Alcazar, and there the skull of la Fermosa Fembra has continued
until our own times."</p>
<p>They were tried for heresy and apostasy, of course; since upon
no other grounds was it possible for the Holy Office to deal with
them. It is unfortunate that Llorente should have unearthed no
record of this trial&mdash;one of the first held by the
Inquisition in Castile&mdash;and that nothing should be known of
what took place beyond the fact that Susan, Sauli, Bartolomé
Torralba, and the brothers Fernandez were found guilty of the
alleged offence of apostasy and were delivered up to the secular
arm for punishment.</p>
<p>Garcia Rodrigo has devoted a couple of pages of his "Historia
Verdadera" to an elaborate piece of fiction in which he asserts
that these men were persistent in their error in spite of the
strenuous efforts made to save them. He invests the fanatical
Ojeda with the character of an angel of mercy, and represents him
hovering round the condemned, exhorting them, almost with tears,
to abjure their error, and he assures us that although the
Dominican persevered in his charitable efforts up to the last
moment, all was vain.</p>
<p>There is not a grain of evidence to support the statement, nor
does Garcia Rodrigo pretend to advance any. As a matter of fact,
Bernaldez, the only available authority who mentions Susan's end,
tells us specifically that he died a Christian. And when it is
considered that Bernaldez is an ardent admirer and champion of
the Inquisition, such a pronouncement from his pen is sufficient
to convict the inquisitors Morillo and San Martin of having
proceeded in a manner that was vindictive and <i>ultra vires</i>.
For at this epoch it was not yet decreed that those who had
relapsed (<i>relapsos</i>) should suffer capital punishment
unless they persisted in their apostasy&mdash;as Rodrigo,
obviously for the purpose of justifying the inquisitors,
unwarrantably asserts did Susan and his confederates.</p>
<p>Llorente considers the blood-lust of the inquisitors
established by these merciless convictions, urging that it is
incredible that all the prisoners should have refused to recant
and to submit themselves to penance&mdash;even assuming that they
were actually guilty of apostasy as alleged. For when all is
considered it must remain extremely doubtful whether they had
Judaized at all, and it is not improbable&mdash;from what we see
of the spirit that actuated the inquisitors&mdash;that Morillo
and San Martin may have construed the action of those men into an
offence against the Faith for the purpose of bringing them within
the jurisdiction of the Holy Office.</p>
<p>They were condemned to be the chief actors in the first Auto
de Fé that was held in Seville. This took place on February
6.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente says "January 6," an obvious
mistake considering that the inquisitors published their first
edict on the 2nd of that month, and that Susan's offence was
subsequent to that publication.]</p>
<p>There was about this Auto comparatively little of that pomp
and ceremonial, that ghastly theatricality that was presently to
distinguish these proceedings. But the essentials were already
present.</p>
<p>Susan and his fellows were led forth barefoot, in the
ignominious, yellow penitential sack, a candle in the hand of
each. Hemmed about by halberdiers, they were paraded through the
streets of a city in which they had won the goodwill and respect
of all, to be gazed upon by a people whose eyes must have been
filled with horror and dismay. To head the procession went a
black-robed Dominican holding aloft the green cross of the
Inquisition, now swathed in a veil of crape; behind him, walking
two by two, came the familiars of the Holy Office, members of the
Confraternity of St. Peter the Martyr; next followed the doomed
men amid their guards; and last came the inquisitors with their
attendants and a considerable body of Dominicans from the Convent
of St. Paul, headed by their prior, the fanatical Ojeda.</p>
<p>The procession headed for the Cathedral, where the sufiferers
were taken to hear Mass and forced to listen to a sermon framed
for the occasion which was preached by Ojeda, and must have
increased the exquisite torment of their protracted agony. Thence
they were conducted&mdash;once more processionally&mdash;out of
the city to the meadows of Tablada. There they were attached to
the stakes that had been erected, fire was set to the faggots,
and thus they perished miserably, to the greater honour and glory
of the Catholic Apostolic Church.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Garcia Rodrigo, vol. i, cap. xx.]</p>
<p>Ojeda may have looked with satisfaction upon that holocaust,
upon those cruel flames which more than any man in Spain he had
been instrumental in kindling, and which being kindled would
continue to cast their lurid glow over that fair land for close
upon four centuries. It was the first burning that Ojeda
witnessed, and it was the last. His own hour was at hand. His
mission, whatever ends it had to serve in the eternal scheme of
things, was completed there on the meadows of Tablada, and he
might now depart. A few days later he lay dead, stricken down by
the plague that was ravaging the south of Spain, and sought him
out for one of its first victims.</p>
<p>And from the pulpits of Seville the Dominicans thundered forth
declarations that this pestilence was a visitation of God upon an
unfaithful city. They never paused to consider that if that were
indeed the case either God's aim must be singularly untrue since
the shafts of His wrath overtook such faithful servants as Ojeda,
or else...</p>
<p>But an incapacity to conduct its reasonings to a logical
conclusion, and an utter want of any sense of proportion, are the
main factors in all fanaticism.</p>
<p>Lest they should themselves be stricken by these bolts of
pestilence launched against the unfaithful, behold next the
inquisitors scuttling out of Seville! They go in quest of more
salubrious districts, and, presumably upon the assumption that
these&mdash;since they remain heahhy&mdash;are escaping divine
attention, the Dominicans zealously proceed to light their fires
that they may repair this heavenly oversight.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Bernaldez tells us (cap. xliv.) that in
the town of Aracena alone, where the Inquisitors sought refuge
from the pestilence, they set up a tribunal and burnt
twenty-three persons alive in addition to the number of bodies
they exhumed for the purpose.]</p>
<p>But that <i>villegiatura</i> of theirs did not take place
until they had transacted a deal more of their horrible business
in Seville. Great had been the results of the edict of January 2.
The nobles, not daring to run the risk of the threatened
ecclesiastical censure, proceeded to effect the arrests demanded,
and gangs of pinioned captives were brought daily into the city
from the surrounding country districts where they had sought
shelter. And in the city itself the familiars of the Holy Office
were busily effecting the capture of suspects and of those
against whom, either out of bigotry or malice, delations had been
made.</p>
<p>So numerous were the arrests that by the middle of the month
of January already the capacity of the Convent of St. Paul was
strained to its utmost, and the inquisitors were compelled to
remove themselves, their tribunal and their prison to the ampler
quarters of the Castle of Triana, accorded to them by the
Sovereigns in response to their request for it.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Bernaldez, cap. xliv.; Zuñiga, "Anales,"
lib. xii. año 1481.]</p>
<p>The edict of January 2 was soon succeeded by a second one,
known as the "Edict of Grace." This exhorted all who were guilty
of apostasy to come forward voluntarily within a term appointed,
to confess their sins and be reconciled to the Church. It assured
them that if they did this with real contrition and a firm
purpose of amendment, they should receive absolution and suffer
no confiscation of property. And it concluded with a warning that
if they allowed the term of grace to expire without taking
advantage of it, and they should afterwards be accused by others,
they would be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law.</p>
<p>Amador de los Rios is of opinion that Cardinal Mendoza was
"instrumental" in having this edict published, in which case it
would hardly be too much to assume that he was the instrument of
Isabella in the matter. Nor is it too much to assume that the
inspiration was purely merciful, and that there was no thought in
the mind of either Queen or Cardinal of the edict's being turned,
as it was, to treacherous account.</p>
<p>The response was immediate. It is estimated that not less than
20,000 <i>conversos</i> who had been guilty of Judaizing came
forward to avail themselves of its promise of amnesty and to
secure absolution for their infidelity to the religion they had
embraced. They discovered to their horror that they had walked
into a trap as cruel as any that smooth-faced, benign-voiced
priestcraft had ever devised.</p>
<p>The inquisitors had thought well to saddle the promised
absolution and immunity from punishment with a condition which
they had not published, a condition which they had secretly
reserved to spring it now upon these self-convicted apostates at
their mercy. They pointed out with infernal subtlety that the
edict provided that the contrition of the self-accused must be
sincere, and that of this sincerity the penitents must give the
only proof possible by disclosing the names of all Judaizers
known to them.</p>
<p>The demand was an infamy; for not even under the seal of
private confession is a priest authorized to impose upon a
penitent as a condition of absolution that he shall divulge the
name even of an accomplice or a partner in guilt. Yet here it was
demanded of these that they should go much further, and denounce
such sinners as they knew; and the demand was framed in such
specious terms&mdash;as the only proof they could offer of the
sincerity of their own contrition&mdash;that none dared have
taxed the inquisitors with malpractice or with subverting the
ends and purpose of this edict they had been forced to
publish.</p>
<p>The wretched apostates found themselves between the sword and
the wall. Either they must perpetrate the infamy of betraying
those of their race whom they knew to be Judaizers, or they must
submit not only to the cruel death by fire, but to the
destitution of their children as a consequence of the
confiscation of their property. Most of them gave way, and
purchased their reconciliation at the price of betrayal. And
there were men like Bernaldez, the parish priest of Palacios, who
applauded this procedure of the Holy Office. "A very glorious
thing" (<i>muy kazañosa cosa</i>), he exclaims, "was the
reconciliation of these people, as thus by their confessions were
discovered all that were Judaizers, and in Seville knowledge was
obtained of Judaizers in Toledo, Cordova, and Burgos."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia de los Reyes Catolicos," cap.
xliv.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Upon the expiry of the term of grace a further edict was
published by Morillo and San Martin, in which they now commanded,
under pain of mortal sin and greater excommunication, with its
attendant penalties, the discovery of all persons known to be
engaged in Judaizing practices.</p>
<p>And that there should be no excuse offered by any on the score
of ignorance of such practices, these were published in
thirty-seven articles appended to the edict, articles whose
malign comprehensiveness left no man secure.</p>
<p>They set forth the following signs by which New-Christians
guilty of Judaizing might be recognized:</p>
<p>I. Any who await the Messiah, or say that he has not yet come,
and that he will come to lead them out of captivity into the
promised land.</p>
<p>II. Any who after baptism have returned expressly to the
Mosaic faith.</p>
<p>III. Any who declare that the law of Moses is as good as that
of Jesus Christ and as efficient for salvation.</p>
<p>IV. Any who keep the Sabbath in honour of the law of
Moses&mdash;of which the proof is afforded by their assuming
clean shirts and more decent garments than on other days, and
clean covers on the table, as well as by their refraining from
lighting fires and from engaging in all work from Friday

<br>
<br></p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the inherent character of
many Jewish customs, which even the most sincere of
New-Christians retained despite themselves; these customs, being
racial rather than religious, were very far from signifying
Judaic apostasy, since they contained nothing that was directly
opposed to the Christian teaching. In the list published by the
Seville inquisitors it will be seen that such customs were
deliberately included as evidences of apostasy.</p>
<p>Consider Articles IV, V, and VII, concerning the assumption of
clean linen on Saturdays and the stripping of fat from beef and
mutton, which nowise offend against the Christian faith, and
might well be the perpetuation of customs acquired before baptism
was received.</p>
<p>Even more flagrant is Article XXXI, which lays it down as
evidence of Judaizing that a man shall turn his face to the wall
when at the point of death; but most flagrant of all is Article
XXVlII, concerning the valedictory meal partaken of before
setting out upon a journey, for it is a custom that at all times
has been as much in vogue among Christians as among men of any
other religion.</p>
<p>Clearly not a New-Christian in Seville was safe from the
delations of the malevolent, since such ridiculously slight
grounds of suspicion were set forth by the tribunal. So
extravagant and absurd are some of these articles that one is
forced to agree with Llorente, that in formulating them the
inquisitors proceeded with deliberate malice. He contends that
deliberately they cast a wide net that by their heavy draught
they should satisfy the Queen that she had heard no more thanUhe
truth as to the extent to which Judaizing was rampant in Castile,
and the urgent need there was for the introduction of the
Inquisition.</p>
<p>Whether in this they proceeded according to instructions
received from Torquemada or Ojeda does not transpire, but there
can be little doubt that the results obtained must have been in
accordance with the wishes of both, since they justified to the
Queen the representations these friars had so insistently made to
her.</p>
<p>And the system of espionage which the inquisitors set up to
increase their haul of victims was as sly and cunning as anything
in the history of spying. Conceive the astuteness of the friar
who climbed to the roof of the Convent of St. Paul on Saturday
mornings to observe and note the houses of New-Christians from
whose chimneys no smoke was to be seen issuing, that he might lay
the information thus obtained before the tribunal, which would
proceed to arrest the inhabitants upon a strong suspicion that
they were Judaizers who would not desecrate the Sabbath by
lighting fires.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Fidel Fita in "Boletin de la Real Academia
de la Historia," xxiii. p. 370]</p>
<p>"What," asks Llorente, "could be expected of a tribunal that
began in this way?" And he at once supplies the answer: "That
which happened&mdash;neither more nor less."</p>
<p>With the methods of procedure that obtained in the trials
conducted by these inquisitors we need not just now concern
ourselves. For the moment it is enough to say that to the vices
inherent in such a judicial system must be added, in the case of
the first inquisitors of Seville, a zeal&mdash;not only to
convict, but actually to be burning heretics&mdash;so ferociously
excessive as to proclaim that they were gratifying their hatred
of these Jews.</p>
<p>This upon the word of that sober chronicler Pulgar, who,
whilst in general terms approving the introduction of the
Inquisition, as has been seen, denounces in the following
particular terms the practices of Morillo and San Martin: "In the
manner in which they conducted their proceedings they showed that
they held those people in hatred."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Chronica," part ii. cap. lxxvii.]</p>
<p>The Auto of February 6 was followed by another on March 26, at
which seventeen victims were burnt on the fields of Tablada. And
now that the fires were lighted, the inquisitors saw to it that
they were well supplied with human fuel. Burnings followed one
another at such a rate that by the month of November&mdash;upon
the word of Llorente&mdash;298 condemned had been sent to the
flames in the town of Seville alone, whilst 79 others by
reconciling themselves to the Church secured the commutation of
their sentence to one of perpetual imprisonment.</p>
<p>Mariana, the historian who gave thanks to God for the
introduction of the Inquisition into Castile, informs us with
flagrant calm that the number of Judaizers burnt in the
Archbishopric during that year 1481 amounted to 8,000, whilst
some 17,000 were submitted to penance.</p>
<p>In addition to those burnt alive, many who had fled the
country were burnt in effigy, having been tried and found guilty
during an absence described as contumacious. And similarly the
court went through the horrible farce of sitting in judgment upon
many who were dead, and, having convicted them, it dug up their
bones and flung these to the flames.</p>
<p>Such was the prodigious activity of the Holy Office, and to
such an extent did its holocausts promise to continue, that the
Governor of Seville ordered the erection on the fields of Tablada
of a permanent platform of stone of vast proportions known as the
Quemadero, or Burning-place. It was adorned by figures of the
four Prophets. At each of its four corners towered one of these
colossal statues of plaster, and Llorente tells us that they were
not merely for ornament. He says that they were hollow and so
contrived that a condemned person might be placed in each and so
die by slow fire.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* This, however, is a statement in which a
misconception seems obvious. If the statues were of plaster (and
it is Llorente himself who says so) they would not have stood the
heat of furnaces placed beneath them. Moreover, since death in
such ovens would have been more lingering and painful than at the
stake, it is difficult to think upon what possible grounds, where
all were equally guilty, any of the condemned should have been
relegated to this further degree of torment,
or&mdash;conversely&mdash;those who died at the stake should have
been spared it. Besides, it is to be remembered that it was
desired, and held desirable, that the victims should Suffer in
full view of the faithful. But the mistake which has crept in can
be indicated. What Bernaldez actually says is: "Ficieron facer
aquel quemadero en Tablado con aquellos quatro profetas de yeso
EN QUE los quemaban." The "en que" may refer either to the
Quemadero generally or to the statues in particular. But there
can be little doubt that it refers to the Quemadero, and that
Llorente was mistaken in assuming it to refer to the statues.<br>
<br>
A curious instance of adapting the shape of a fact so that it
will fit the idea to be conveyed is aiforded in this connection
by Dr. Rule, who calmly alters the substance of the statues,
translating <i>yeso</i> as "limestone." "Hist, of the
Inquisition," vol. i. p. 134.]</p>
<p>This Quemadero remained standing, a monument to religious
intolerance and fanatical cruelty, until the soldiers of Napoleon
demolished it in the nineteenth century.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Garcia Rodrigo tells us that the architect
of this elaborate altar of intolerance was a New-Christian of
such zeal that he fouud employment in the Holy Office as one of
its receivers, but that being discovered in Judaizing practices
he was himself burnt on the Quemadero he had erected. No
authority is furnished for the story, nor does Llorante mention
it, and one is inclined to place it in the category of fables
such as that which relates how the first head to be shorn off by
the guillotine was that of its inventor. Dr. Guillotin.]</p>
<p>So ruthless were Morillo and San Martin, and so negligent of
equity or even the observance of the ordinary rules of judicial
procedure, that in the end we find the Pope himself&mdash;in
January of 1482&mdash;addressing a letter of protest to the
Sovereigns.</p>
<p>The first edict commanding the nobles to arrest all those who
had fled from Seville had had the effect of driving many of these
fugitive New-Christians farther afield in their quest for safety.
Some had escaped into Portugal, others had crossed the
Mediterranean and sought shelter in Morocco, whilst others still
had taken their courage in both hands and sought sanctuary in
Rome itself, at the very feet of the Pontiff Other fugitives
followed presently, when the tribunal had already inaugurated its
terrible work; and these came clamouring their grievances and
protesting that in spite of their innocence they dared no longer
remain in a State where no New-Christian was safe from the hatred
and injustice shown by the inquisitors to men of their race.
Therefore they were driven to seek from Christ's Vicar the
protection to which all Christians and true Catholics were
entitled at his hands.</p>

<p>They informed the Pontiff of the methods that were being
pursued; they set forth how the inquisitors in their eagerness to
secure convictions proceeded entirely upon their own initiative
and without the concurrence of the assessor and diocesan
ordinary, as had been prescribed; how they were departing from
all legal form, imprisoning unjustly, torturing cruelly and
unduly, and falsely stigmatizing innocent men as formal heretics,
thereafter delivering them to the secular arm for punishment, in
addition to confiscating their property so that their children
were left in want and under the brand of infamy.</p>
<p>The Pope gave ear to these plaints, convinced himself of their
truth, and made his protest to Ferdinand and Isabella. He
announced in his brief that he would have deprived the
inquisitors of their office but that he was restrained by
consideration for the Sovereigns who had appointed them;
nevertheless, he was sending them a brief of admonition, and
should they again give cause for complaint he would be
constrained to depose them. In the meantime he revoked the
faculty given the Sovereigns of appointing inquisitors,
protesting that when conceding this he had not sufficiently
considered that already there were inquisitors in the Sovereigns'
dominions and that the General of the Dominicans and the Spanish
provincials of that order had the right to make such
appointments. The bull that he had granted was therefore in
opposition to that right, and would never have been granted had
the matter been sufficiently considered.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 133. Llorente

<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-09" name="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX. THE SUPREME
COUNCIL</h2>
<p>The Sovereigns appear to have submitted without protest to
this papal interference and to the revocation of the faculty
bestowed upon them of nominating the inquisitors in their
kingdom. This submission was hardly to have been expected from
their earlier attitude, but there are two reasons, either or both
of which may possibly account for it.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that there was a considerable number of
New-Christians about the Court and in immediate attendance upon
the Queen, one of whom was her secretary Pulgar. What view Pulgar
took of the Seville proceedings we know, and it is not too much
to assume that his view was the view of all Christians of Jewish
extraction. These New-Christians and others may very well have
urged upon the notice of the Sovereigns the cruelties and
injustices that were being practised, drawing their attention to
the decree that made innocent children suffer for the offences of
which their parents had been convicted&mdash;a decree which,
hideous enough when the parents were actually guilty, became
unspeakably hideous when that guilt was no more than
presumed.</p>
<p>In view of such representations the Sovereigns may have found
the papal rebuke unanswerable and the Pope's action
justified.</p>
<p>Then, again, they may have taken into consideration the
projected war upon Granada, the last province of the peninsula
remaining in Moorish hands. Funds were urgently required for this
campaign, and the confiscations that were daily being effected by
the Holy Office were rapidly supplying these&mdash;for the early
victims of the Inquisition, as we know, were persons of great
wealth and distinction.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "...e fueron aplicados todos sus bienes
para la Camara del Rey y de la Reyna, los cuales fueron en gran
cantidad."&mdash;Pulgar, "Cronica," cap. xcv.]</p>
<p>Now the papal brief, whilst it cancelled the royal prerogative
of appointing inquisitors, did not attempt to divert the course
of this stream of confiscated property, nor, indeed, made any
mention of the matter. So that they may have hesitated to oppose
themselves to measures which they recognized as just and which
continued to supply them with the means for what they looked upon
as a righteous cmsade.</p>
<p>Bigotry and acquisitiveness were again joining forces, and,
united, they must prove, as ever, irresistible.</p>
<p>But on February 11, 1482, the Roman Curia issued another brief
addressed to the Sovereigns, wherein&mdash;entirely ignoring what
already had been written&mdash;it was announced that the General
of the Dominicans, Fr. Alonso de Cebrian, having represented to
the Pope the need to multiply the number of inquisitors in Spain,
his Holiness had resolved to appoint the said Fr. Alonso and
seven other Dominicans to conduct the affairs of the Holy Office
in that kingdom, commanding them to exercise their ministry in
conjunction with the diocesan ordinary and in accordance with the
terms set forth in the briefs that were being addressed to
them.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 136.]</p>
<p>One of the eight Dominicans mentioned by the Pope was Fr.
Tomás de Torquemada, who by now was become confessor to the King
and to the Cardinal of Spain.</p>
<p>This brief, following so rapidly upon that which revoked the
Sovereigns' power, may have caused Ferdinand and Isabella to look
upon it as the second move in an intrigue whose aim was to
strengthen the ecclesiastical arm in Spain to the detriment of
the royal authority.</p>
<p>On April 17 Sixtus sent the promised instructions to the
inquisitors of Aragon, Cataluna, Valencia, and Mallorca. These
indicated a procedure in matters of faith so contrary to common
law, that no sooner did the inquisitors attempt to carry them
into execution than there was an uproar which afforded Ferdinand
grounds upon which to indite a protest to the Holy Father.</p>
<p>A reply came in the following October. Sixtus wrote that the
briefs of last April had been drawn up after conference with
several members of the Sacred College; that these cardinals were
now absent from Rome, but that on their return the matter should
be further considered. Meanwhile, however, in view of the results
that had attended those briefs, he was informing the inquisitors
that they were exempt from acting upon the terms set forth in
them and instructing them to proceed, as formerly, in
co-operation with the diocesan ordinaries.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, for all the Pope's protest against the
excessive severity of the Seville tribunal, this severity
continued so undiminished, not only in Seville but also in the
districts under the jurisdiction of other inquisitors, that there
was a continuous emigration from Spain of the wealthy
New-Christian families. Many of these repaired to Rome to appeal
to the Pontifical Courts and to procure there an absolution which
should accord them immunity from the Spanish tribunals of the
Holy Office.</p>
<p>But even when this absolution was procured a large number of
these emigrants never thought of returning to Spain, considering
it wiser to settle in a country in which they were in less danger
of persecution.</p>
<p>Although it is certain that the Sovereigns can have had no
prevision of what actually was to happen as a
consequence&mdash;though not in their own day, nor for some time
afterwards&mdash;although they may have been very far from
foreseeing that by driving out these energetic, industrious,
intelligent men they were depriving the country of the
financially able, wealth-producing element of the
community&mdash;still they did undoubtedly perceive what was
immediately before them; and they began to fear the possibility
of their country's being drained of its present wealth if these
emigrations were to continue.</p>
<p>So Isabella wrote to the Pope entreating him to establish a
court of appeal in Spain, and thus dispose that proceedings
started within the kingdom could there be carried to their
conclusion without the need for these appeals to Rome. To this
the Pope replied in affectionate terms on February 23, 1483,
promising to give the matter every consideration.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See letter quoted in Appendix to
Llorente's "Memoria Historica."]</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter he held a conference of the Spanish
Cardinals, the principal of whom in wealth, importance, and
distinction was Roderigo Borgia, Cardinal of Valencia. At this
conference several provisions were agreed upon, and these were
embodied in the briefs dispatched from the Vatican on May 25
following.</p>
<p>The first of these was to the Sovereigns. It contained a
gracious assent to their petition, and exhorted them to be
zealous in this matter of the Faith, reminding them that Jehu had
consolidated his kingdom by the destruction of idolatry, and that
the Sovereigns would meet with the same good fortune, as already
God was giving them many victories over the Moors to reward their
piety and the purity of their faith.</p>
<p>The second was to Inigo Manrique, Archbishop of Seville
(having succeeded in this see to the Cardinal of Spain, who was
now Archbishop of Toledo), appointing him judge of appeal in
<i>Causas de Fé</i>.</p>
<p>The remaining briefs were addressed to the Archbishop of
Toledo and the other Spanish archbishops, commanding them, to the
end that the functions of the Inquisition should be discharged
with integrity, that in the event of there being in their
ecclesiastical provinces any bishops who were of Jewish descent,
they should suavely admonish these not to intervene in person in
the proceedings of the Holy Office, but to allow themselves to be
represented by their principal officials, provisors, and diocesan
vicars-general&mdash;always provided that none of these was of
Jewish blood.</p>
<p>This decree was natural enough, and there was some occasion
for it, considering the number of Spanish families of Jewish
consanguinity as a consequence of marriages between Christians
and <i>conversos</i>&mdash;many of these marriages having been
contracted between Castilians of good birth and the daughters of
wealthy baptized Jews. It is a decree that entirely contradicts
Pulgar's assertion that Torquemada was of Jewish extraction.</p>
<p>The appointment of Manrique as judge of appeal was a very
brief one, nor did it work satisfactorily and accomplish what the
Queen desired. In the following August came another papal brief,
stating that, notwithstanding that appointment, fugitive
New-Christians from the Archbishopric of Seville continued to
arrive in Rome and to make their appeals to the Apostolic Courts,
protesting that they dared not address these to the appointed
tribunal in Seville, for fear of being treated with excessive
rigour.</p>
<p>Many stated that, by virtue of the ban against them for having
left the city, they were fearful of being flung into prison
unheard. Many, again, had already been tried during their absence
and burnt in effigy, and they were apprehensive that if they
returned their appeals would be refused a hearing, and they would
be sent at once to the flames in execution of the sentence
already pronounced against them.</p>
<p>Therefore the Pope now ordered Manrique to admit to
reconciliation all who might seek it, in despite of any judgment
or sentence already passed upon them.</p>
<p>Had these commands prevailed, the destruction wrought by the
Inquisition would have been considerably reduced, since none
could have suffered but the persistent apostate. The brief,
however, does not appear to have been even dispatched. No sooner
was its merciful decree indited than it was regretted and
retracted. Eleven days later Sixtus wrote to Ferdinand
acquainting him with the terms of that brief which had been
intended for Manrique, but explaining that these had not been
sufficiently considered, and that, therefore, he was retaining it
whilst fresh measures were deliberated.</p>
<p>The position must have been growing intolerable to the
Sovereigns, for the Holy Office in Spain, directed in this
fashion from Rome, was governed by unstable and ever-shifting
elements that were eminently disturbing to the
State&mdash;particularly now that the Inquisition was growing
rapidly in importance. Therefore Isabella wrote again, imploring
the Holy Father to give that institution a settled form. To this
the Pope acceded, perhaps himself aware of the necessity for the
thing requested. A head was necessary for the consolidated
institution it was now proposed to form, and Frey Tomás de
Torquemada, from what was known of his life, his character, and
his ability, was judged to be the man to fill this important
office. Accordingly he was recommended to Sixtus by the
Sovereigns, and he received his appointment from the Pope, first
as Grand Inquisitor for Castile, and soon after (by the bull of
October 17, 1483) his jurisdiction was extended to include
Aragon; so that he found himself at the head of the Holy Office
in Spain, and invested with the fullest powers. It was his to
elect, depose, and replace subaltern inquisitors at his will, and
the jurisdiction of all those he appointed was subject to and
dependent upon himself.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The bull of nomination is quoted in full
by Paramo, "De Origine," p. 137]</p>
<p>Llorente says of him: "The result accredited the election. It
seemed almost impossible that there should be another man so
capable of executing the intentions of King Ferdinand to multiply
confiscations, the intentions of the Roman Curia to propagate its
jurisdiction and pecuniary maxims, and the intentions of the
projectors of the Inquisition and its Autos de Fé to inspire
terror."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Hist. Critica," tom. i. art. i. §.
2.]</p>
<p>With his elevation to that important position&mdash;a position
whose importance his own energy and determination were to
increase until his power in the land should almost rival that of
the Sovereigns themselves&mdash;the Spanish Inquisition enters
now upon a new phase. Under the jurisdiction and control of that
stern-souled, mild-eyed ascetic, the entire character of the Holy
Office is transformed.</p>
<p>Immediately upon his appointment he set about reconstituting
it so that it should be in harmony with the wishes of the
Sovereigns. To assist him he appointed as his assessors the
jurisconsults Juan Gutierrez de Lachaves and Tristan de Medina,
and he proceeded to establish four permanent tribunals: one in
Seville, under Morillo and San Martin, whom he left undisturbed
in their office, but subject to the new rules which he laid down
for the transaction of affairs; one in Cordova, under Pedro
Martinez de Barrio and Anton Ruiz Morales, with Fr. Martin de
Caso as assessor; one in Jaen, under Juan Garcia de Cañas and Fr.
Juan de Yarza; and one in Villa Real,* which shortly afterwards
was transferred to Toledo, under Francisco Sanchez de la Fuente
and Pedro Dias de Costana.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Afterwards Ciudad Real.]</p>
<p>In addition to these he appointed other inquisitors who,
without being attached to any permanent tribunal, were to proceed
wherever he should direct them as occasion arose to set up
temporary courts.</p>
<p>In Toledo, Valladolid, Avila, Segovia, and other cities there
were inquisitors already of the Pope's, appointing. Some of these
failed to show the complete submission to his orders which
Torquemada demanded, with the result that they were promptly
deposed and their places filled by others whom he nominated.
Those who manifested obedience to his rule he confirmed in their
appointments, but usually he sent a nominee of his own to act in
conjunction with them.</p>
<p>Torquemada himself remained at Court; for now that the
Inquisition was established upon its new footing it became
necessary that he should be in constant communication with the
Sovereigns for whom he acted. Consultations were necessary on the
score of the measures to be taken for the administration of what
was rapidly become a corporation of great importance in the
realm. From this it presently resulted that to the four royal
councils already in existence for the conduct of the affairs of
the kingdom, a fifth was added especially to deal with
inquisitorial matters. Whether the suggestion emanated from the
Sovereigns or from Torquemada, there are no means of
ascertaining, nor does it greatly signify.</p>
<p>This Supreme Council of the Inquisition was established in
1484. It consisted of three royal councillors: Alonso Carillo,
Bishop of Mazzara, Sancho Velasquez de Cuellar, and Poncio de
Valencia, all doctors of laws, and of Torquemada's two assessors.
To preside over this "Suprema"&mdash;as the council came to be
called&mdash;Torquemada was appointed, thus enormously increasing
the power and influence which already he wielded.</p>
<p>The three royal councillors had a definite vote in all matters
that appertained to the jurisdiction of the Sovereigns; but in
all matters of spiritual jurisdiction, which was vested entirely
in the Grand Inquisitor by the papal bull, their votes were
merely consultative&mdash;amounting to no more than an expression
of opinion.</p>
<p>It was Torquemada's desire that his subordinates should act
with absolute uniformity in the discharge of the duties entrusted
to them, and that the courts of the Holy Office throughout Spain
should one and all be identical in their methods of procedure,
the instruments of his will and the expression of his
conceptions. With this end in view he summoned the inquisitors by
him appointed to the Tribunals of Seville, Cordova, Jaen, and
Villa Real to confer with him and his assessors and the royal
councillors.</p>
<p>The assembly took place in Seville on October 29, and its
business was the formulation of the first instructions of
Torquemada for the guidance of all inquisitors.</p>
<p>In the library of the British Museum there is a vellum-bound
copy of the edition of this code, which was subsequently
published at Madrid in 1576.* It contains, in addition to
Torquemada's articles of 1484 and subsequent years, others added
by his successors, and there are marginal notes giving the
authorship of each. The work is partly printed, partly in
manuscript, and a considerable number of pages remain in blank,
that further instructions may be filled in as the need occurs.
The printed matter is frequently underscored by the pen of one or
another of the inquisitors through whose hands this copy passed
during its active existence.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Copilacion de las Instrucciones hechas,
etc." Press-mark C. 61. e. 6.]</p>
<p>The twenty-eight articles compiled by Torquemada at the
assembly of 1484, and constituting his first "Instructions for
the Governance of the Holy Office," demand a chapter to
themselves.</p>

<h2><a id="ch-10" name="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X. THE JURISPRUDENCE
OE THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE FIRST "INSTRUCTIONS" OF
TORQUEMADA</h2>
<p>The first manual for the use of inquisitors was probably
written somewhere about 1320. It was the work of the Dominican
friar Bernard Gui&mdash;"Practica Inquisitionis Heretice
Pravitatis&mdash;Bernardo Guidonis, Ordinis Fratrum Predicatorum
"&mdash;and it summarised the experience gathered during a
hundred years by the inquisitors of Southern France.</p>
<p>It is divided into five parts. The first three are directly
concerned with procedure, and the formulae are given for every
occasion&mdash;citation, arrest, pardon, commutation, and
sentence&mdash;with the fullest particulars for the guidance of
inquisitors. The fourth part treats of the powers vested in the
tribunal of the Inquisition, and cites the authorities&mdash;i.e.
the decrees of pontiffs and of councils. The fifth part surveys
and defines the various heretical sects of Gui's day, gives
particulars of the doctrines, rites, and ceremonies by which each
one may be known, and lays down methods by which heretical guile
may be circumvented in examination.</p>
<p>The work was used by French inquisitors in general and those
of Toulouse in particular, and it is more than probable that it
inspired Nicolaus Eymeric to compile his voluminous "Directorium
Inquisitorum" towards the middle of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>Nicolaus Eymeric was Grand Inquisitor of Aragon, and he
prepared his directory, or manual of procedure, as a guide for
his confreres in the business of prosecuting those guilty of
heretical pravity.</p>
<p>The work circulated freely in its manuscript form, and it was
one of the first to be printed in Barcelona upon the introduction
of the printing-press, so that in Torquemada's day copies were
widely diffused, and were in the hands of all inquisitors in the
world.</p>
<p>The bulk of the "Directorium" is little more than a
compilation. It is divided into three parts. The first lays down
the chief Articles of the Christian Faith; the second is a
collection of the decretals, bulls, and briefs of the popes upon
the subject of heretics and heresies, and the decision of the
various councils held to determine matters connected with
heretics and their abettors, sorcerers, excommunicates, Jews and
infidels; the third part, which is Eymeric's own contribution to
the subject, deals with the manner in which trials should be
conducted, and gives a detailed list of the offences that come
under the jurisdiction of the Holy Office.</p>
<p>It may be well before proceeding further to give a résumé of
the grounds upon which the Inquisition instituted proceedings, as
set forth in the "Directorium."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>All heretics in general are subject to the animadversions of
the Holy Office; but there are, in addition, certain offenders
who, whilst not exactly guilty of heresy, nevertheless render
themselves justiciable by the Inquisition. These are:</p>
<p>BLASPHEMERS who in blaspheming say that which is contrary to
the Christian Faith. Thus, he who says, "The season is so bad
that God Himself could not give us good weather," sins upon a
matter of faith.</p>
<p>SORCERERS AND DIVINERS, when in their sorceries they perform
that which is in the nature of heresy&mdash;such as re-baptizing
infants, burning incense to a skull, etc. But if they confine
their sorceries to foretelling the future by chiromancy or
palmistry, by drawing the short straw, or consulting the
astrolabe, they are guilty of simple sorcery, and it is for the
secular courts to prosecute them.</p>
<p>Amongst the latter are to be placed those who administer
love-philtres to women.</p>
<p>DEVIL-WORSHIPPERS: Those who invoke devils. These are to be
divided into three classes:</p>
<p>(a) Those who worship the devil, sacrificing to him,
prostrating themselves, singing prayers and fasting, burning
incense or lighting candles in his honour.</p>
<p>(b) Those who confine themselves to offering a <i>Dulie</i> or
<i>Hyperdulie</i> cult to Satan, introducing the names of devils
into the litanies.</p>
<p>(c) Those who invoke the devil by tracing magic figures,
placing an infant in a circle, using a sword, a bed, or a mirror,
etc.</p>
<p>In general it is easy to recognize those who have dealings
with devils on account of their ferocious aspect and terrible
air.</p>
<p>The invocation in any of the three manners cited is always a
heresy. But if the devil should only be asked to do things that
are of his office&mdash;such as to tempt a woman to the sin of
luxury&mdash;provided that this is done without adoration or
prayer, but in terms of command, there are authors who hold that
in such cases the person so proceeding is not guilty of
heresy.</p>
<p>Amongst those who invoke devils are astrologers and
alchymists, who when they do not succeed in making the
discoveries they seek never fail to have recourse to the devil,
sacrificing to him and invoking him expressly or tacitly.</p>
<p>JEWS AND INFIDELS: The first when they sin against their
religion in any of the articles of faith that are the same with
them as with us&mdash;i.e. that are common alike to Jew and to
Christian&mdash;or when they attack dogmas that are, similarly,
common to both creeds.</p>
<p>As for infidels, the Church and the Pope, and consequently the
Inquisition, may punish them when they sin against the laws of
nature&mdash;the only laws they know.</p>
<p>Jews and infidels who attempt to pervert Christians are also
regarded as abettors or <i>fautores</i>.</p>
<p>In spite of the prohibition to succour a heretic, a man would
not be regarded as an abettor who gave food to a heretic dying of
hunger, since it is possible that if spared the latter might yet
come to be converted.</p>
<p>EXCOMMUNICATES who remain in excommunication during a whole
year, by which are to be understood not merely those who are
excommunicate as heretics, or abettors of heretics, but
excommunicate upon any grounds whatsoever. In fact, the
indifference to excommunication renders them suspect of
heresy.</p>
<p>APOSTATES.&mdash;Apostate Christians who become Jews or
Mohammedans (these religions not being heresies), even though
they should have apostatized through fear of death. The fear of
torture or death not being one that can touch a person who is
firm in the Faith, no apostasy is to be excused upon such
grounds.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Eymeric, "Directorium," pars iii. Qusest,
xli. <i>et seq</i>.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>With the "Directorium" of Eymeric before him, Torquemada set
to work to draw up the first articles of his famous code.
Additions were to be made to it later, as the need for such
additions came to be shown by experience; but no subsequent
addition was of the importance of these original twenty-eight
articles. They may be said to have given the jurisprudence of the
Spanish Inquisition a settled form, which continued practically
unchanged for over three hundred years after Torquemada's
death.</p>
<p>A survey of these articles and of the passages from Eymeric
that have a bearing upon them, together with some of the
annotations of the scholiast Francesco Pegna,* should serve to
convey some notion of the jurisprudence of the Holy Office and of
the extraordinary spirit that inspired and governed it&mdash;a
spirit at once crafty and stupid, subtle and obvious, saintly and
diabolical, consistent in nothing&mdash;not even in cruelty, for
in its warped and dreadful way it accounted itself merciful, and
not only represented but believed that its aims were charitable.
It practised its abominations of cruelty out of love for the
human race, to save the human race from eternal damnation; and
whilst it wept on the one hand over the wretched heretic it flung
to the flames, it exulted on the other in the thought that by
burning one who was smitten with the pestilence of heresy it
saved perhaps a hundred from infection and from purging that
infection in an eternity of hell-fire.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The compendious tome including these very
ample annotations and commentaries was published first in Rome,
1585.]</p>
<p>They are rash who see hypocrisy in the priestly code that is
to follow. Hypocrites there may have been, there must have been,
and many; such a system was a very hotbed of hypocrisy. Yet the
system itself was not hypocritical. It was sincere, dreadfully,
tragically, ardently sincere, with the most hopeless,
intolerable, and stupid of all sincerity&mdash;the sincerity of
fanaticism, which destroys all sense of proportion, and distorts
man's intellectual vision until with an easy conscience he makes
of guile and craft and falsehood the principles that shall enable
him to do what he conceives to be his duty by his fellow-man.</p>
<p>The doctrine of exclusive salvation was the source of all this
evil. But that doctrine was firmly and sincerely held. Torquemada
or any other inquisitor might have uttered the words which an
inspired poet has caused to fall from the lips of Philip II.:</p>
<p class="poem">"The blood and sweat of heretics at the stake<br>
Is God's best dew upon the barren field."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Tennyson's "Queen Mary," Act V. sc.
i.]</p>
<p>And he would have uttered them with a calm and firm
conviction, assured that he did no more than proclaim an obvious
truth which might serve him as a guide to do his duty by man and
God. For all that he did he could find a commandment in the
Scriptures. Was burning the proper death for heretics? He
answered the question out of the very mouth of Christ, as you
shall see. Should a heretic's property be confiscated? Eymeric
and Paramo point to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden as a
consequence of their disobedience&mdash;the first of all
heresies&mdash;and ask you what was that but confiscation. Is it
proper to impose a garment of shame upon those convicted of
lesser heresies, or upon penitents who are reconciled? Paramo
will answer you that Adam and Eve wore skins after their fall,
and implies that this is a proper precedent for the infamous
<i>sanbenito</i>.</p>
<p>And so on: Moses, David, John the Baptist, and the gentle
Saviour Himself are made to afford reason for this course and for
that, as the need arises, and each reason is more grotesque than
the other, until you are stunned by the blows of these clumsy
arguments. You cease to wonder that the translation of the Bible
was forbidden, that its study was inhibited. If those who were
learned in theology could interpret it so extravagantly, what
might not the unlearned achieve?</p>

PRINTED EDITION OF THE "INSTRUCTIONS" OF TORQUEMADA</small><br>
<br></p>
<hr>
<p>But let us pass on to the consideration of Torquemada's
code.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article I</b></p>
<p>Whenever inquisitors are appointed to a diocese, city,
village, or other place which hitherto has had no inquisitors,
they shall&mdash;after having presented the warrants by which
they are empowered to the prelate of the principal church and to
the governor of the district&mdash;summon by proclamation all the
people and convoke the clergy. They shall appoint a Sunday or
holiday upon which all are to assemble in the cathedral or
principal church to hear a sermon of the Faith.</p>
<p>They shall contrive that this sermon is delivered by a good
preacher or by one of the actual inquisitors, as they deem best.
Its aim shall be to expound the capacity in which they are there,
their powers, and their intentions.</p>
<p>Upon the conclusion of this sermon the inquisitors shall order
all faithful Christians to come forward and make oath upon the
Cross and the Gospels to favour the Holy Inquisition and its
ministers, and to offer them no impediment directly or indirectly
in the prosecution of their mission.</p>
<p>This oath shall be specially imposed upon the governors or
other justiciaries of the place, and it shall be witnessed by the
notaries of the inquisitors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article II</b></p>
<p>After the conclusion of the said sermon the inquisitors shall
order to be read and published an admonition with censures
against those who are rebellious or who contest the power of the
Holy Office.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article III</b></p>
<p>After the conclusion of the said sermon the inquisitors shall
publish an edict granting a term of grace, of thirty or forty
days&mdash;as they may deem proper&mdash;so that all persons who
have fallen into the sin of heresy or apostasy, who have observed
Jewish rites or any other that are contrary to the Christian
Religion, may come forward to confess their sins, assured that if
they do so with a sincere penitence, divulging all that is known
to them or that they remember, not only of their own sins but
also of the sins of others, they shall be received with
charity.</p>
<p>They shall be subjected to a salutary penance, but they shall
not suffer death, imprisonment, or confiscation of their
property, nor shall they In any way be mulcted unless the
inquisitors, in consideration of the quality of the penitents and
of the sins they confess, should think well to impose some
pecuniary penance upon them.</p>
<p>Concerning this grace and mercy that their Highnesses consider
well to accord to those who are reconciled, the Sovereigns order
the delivery of letters-patent, bearing the royal seal, whose
tenor shall be included in the published edict.</p>
<p class="footnote">It is sufficiently plain, from the terms of
this article, that the edict of grace was published by royal
command, and that it was not, as Garcia Rodrigo represents it, a
merciful dispensation spontaneouslyemanating from the Holy
Office.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article IV</b></p>
<p>Self-delators shall present their confessions in writing to
the inquisitors and their notaries with two or three witnesses
who shall be officers of the Inquisition or other upright
persons.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of this confession by the inquisitors, let the
oath be administered to the penitents in legal form, not only
concerning the matters confessed but concerning others that may
be known to them and upon which they may be questioned. Let them
be asked how long it is since they Judaized or otherwise sinned
against the Faith, and how long it is since they abandoned their
false beliefs, repented, and ceased to observe those ceremonies.
Next let them be examined upon the circumstances of the matters
confessed, that the inquisitors may satisfy themselves that these
confessions are true. Especially let them be questioned as to
what prayers they recite, where they recite them, and with whom
they have been in the habit of assembling to hear the law of
Moses preached.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article V</b></p>
<p>Self-delators who seek reconciliation to Holy Mother Church
shall be required publicly to abjure their errors, and, penance
shall publicly be imposed upon them at the discretion of the
inquisitors, using mercy and kindness as far as it is possible
for them to do so with an easy conscience.</p>
<p>The inquisitors shall admit none to secret penance and
recantation unless his sin shall have been so secret that none
else knows or could know of it save his confessor; such a one all
inquisitors may reconcile and absolve in secret.</p>
<p class="footnote">Llorente says that the admission to secret
penance was a source of much gold to the Roman Curia, as
thousands appealed to the Pope offering a secret confession and
firm purpose of amendment if secretly absolved, for which a papal
brief was necessary.<br>
<br>
A word must here be said on the score of ABJURATION. It was the
amende provided by Eymeric (See Eymeric, "Directorium," pars iii.
p. 315 <i>et seq</i>.) for those who by their speech or conduct
should have fallen into suspicion of heresy; those, for instance,
who abstained from the sacraments imposed by Mother Church being
liable to this suspicion.<br>
<br>
There were three degrees of suspicion into which a man might
fall: light, vehement, and violent. The abjuration required was
practically the same in all three cases, but the punishment
imposed upon the abjurer varied according to the degree. This
abjuration must be publicly made in church before the assembled
people, the suspects being placed&mdash;like all penitents or
convicts of heresy&mdash;upon a raised platform in full view of
the assembled faithful. The inquisitor would read out the
Articles of the Christian Faith, and a list of the principal
errors against it, laying particular stress upon those errors of
which the penitents were suspected, and which they were required
to abjure with both hands upon the Gospels, and according to the
formula laid down by Eymeric.<br>
<br>
Those who are suspected lightly (<i>leviter</i>) are admonished
that should they again fall into error they will be abandoned to
the secular arm for punishment. With that admonition, and the
imposition of a penance which may take the form of fasts,
prayers, or pilgrimages, they are dismissed.<br>
<br>
Those suspected vehemently (<i>vehementer</i>) are similarly
admonished, but in addition they may be sent to prison for a
time, whereafter they must undergo a heavy penance, such as
standing on certain days at the door of the principal church or
near the altar during the celebration of Mass holding a
candle&mdash;but not wearing a <i>sanbenito</i>, as, properly
speaking, they are not heretics&mdash;or they may be sent upon a
pilgrimage.<br>
<br>
He who is violently suspected (<i>violenter</i>) shall be
absolved of the excommunication incurred, but as his crime may
not go unpunished, and to the end that he may suffer less
severely in the next world, he is sentenced to a term of
imprisonment, whereafter he shall be condemned to stand at the
church door during the great feasts of the year wearing the
penitential scapulary known as the <i>sanbenito</i>, that all may
be made aware of his infamy.<br>
<br>
After passing sentence, the inquisitor shall admonish the
penitent in these terms:<br>
<br>
"My dear Son, be patient and do not despair; if we observe in you
the signs of contrition we shall soften your penance; but beware
of departing from what we have prescribed for you; should you do
so you shall be punished as an impenitent heretic."<br>
<br>
The punishment for the impenitent was, of course, the fire.<br>
<br>
The inquisitor shall conclude the ceremony by granting an
indulgence of forty days to all who have attended it and an
indulgence of three years to those who shall have taken part in
it.<br>
<br>
The sentence of prison, with its bread-and-water diet, might be
relaxed; but never that of the <i>sanbenito</i>, which is
considered by Eymeric&mdash;and inquisitors generally&mdash;as
the most salutary of penances for him that undergoes it and the
most edifying to the public generally.<br>
<br>
The self-delators admitted by Torquemada to abjuration were
treated as suspects of the first degree&mdash;<i>leviter</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article VI</b></p>
<p>Inasmuch as heretics and apostates (although they return to
the Catholic Faith and become reconciled) are infamous at law,
and inasmuch as they must perform their penances with humility
and sorrow for having lapsed into error, the inquisitors shall
order them not to hold any public office or ecclesiastical
benefice, and they shall not be lawyers or brokers, apothecaries,
surgeons or physicians, nor shall they wear gold or silver,
coral, pearls, precious stones or other ornaments, nor dress in
silk or camlett, nor go on horseback nor carry weapons all their
lives, under pain of being deemed relapsed (<i>relapsos</i>) into
heresy, as must all be considered who after reconciliation do not
carry out the penances imposed upon them.</p>
<p class="footnote">This decree was no more than the revival of
the enactment made a century and a half earlier by Alfonso XI in
the code known as the Partidas, which had mercifully been allowed
to fall into desuetude. It was, Llorente tell us, a considerable
source of wealth to the Roman Curia. Frequent appeals for
"rehabilitation" were made in consequence, and accorded under an
apostolic brief whose heavy charges the appellants were required
to defray.<br>
<br>
Torquemada mercifully stops short of ordering the self-delators
to wear the <i>sanbenito</i>. Even so, however, by decreeing that
they must wear no garments of silk or wool, and therefore none
but the very plainest raiment, unadorned by any precious metal or
jewel&mdash;not to mention the prohibition to use weapons or go
on horseback&mdash;he imposed upon them a garb that was only some
degrees removed from the penitential sack and served the same
purpose of marking them out for infamy.<br>
<br>
The wearing of the <i>sanbenito</i>, too, was a custom that had
fallen somewhat into desuetude. But the ascetic Torquemada was
not the man to allow a form of penance accounted so very salutary
to continue neglected. He revived and extended the use of it,
adding innovations of his own, so that it came to be imposed not
only upon condemned heretics, but upon the reconciled&mdash;other
than self-delators&mdash;and upon suspects, who were required to
wear it during the abjuration ceremony.<br>
<br>
This odious garment, its origin and history, shall presently be
more fully considered.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article VII</b></p>
<p>As the crime of heresy is a very heinous one, it is desired
that the reconciled may realize by the penances imposed upon them
how gravely they have offended and sinned against Our Lord Jesus
Christ. Yet, as it is our aim to treat them very mercifully and
kindly, pardoning them from the pain of fire and perpetual
imprisonment, and leaving them all their property should they, as
has been said, come to confess their errors within the appointed
time of grace, the inquisitors shall, in addition to the penances
imposed upon the said reconciled, order them to bestow as alms a
certain portion of their property, according to the position of
the penitent and the gravity of the crimes confessed. These
pecuniary penances shall be applied for the Holy War which the
most serene Sovereigns are making upon the Moors of Granada,
enemies of our Holy Catholic Faith, and to other pious works that
may be undertaken. For just as the said heretics and apostates
have offended against Our Lord and His Holy Faith, so, after
re-incorporation in the Church, it is just that they should bear
pecuniary penances for the defence of the Holy Faith.</p>
<p>These pecuniary penances shall be at the discretion of the
inquisitors; but they shall be guided by the tariff given them by
the Reverend Father Prior of Holy Cross (i.e. by Torquemada).</p>
<p class="footnote">It was no inconsiderable proportion of their
property that was required of them, as may be seen from the
penance of "alms" for the war against Granada imposed upon those
who were reconciled in Toledo two years later; one-fifth of their
property being demanded.(See Fidel Fita in "Boletin de la Real
Academia de la Historia," vol. xi. p. 296.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article VIII</b></p>
<p>Should any person guilty of the said crime of heresy fail to
present himself within the appointed period of grace, but come
forward voluntarily after its expiry and make his confession in
due form before having been arrested or cited by the inquisitors,
or before the inquisitors shall have received testimony against
him, such person shall be received to abjuration and
reconciliation in the same manner as those who presented
themselves during the term of the said edict, and he shall be
submitted to penances at the discretion of the inquisitors. But
such penances shall not be pecuniary because his property is
confiscate [<i>so that his admission to abjuration is not quite
upon the same terms</i>].</p>
<p>But if at the time of his coming to confess and seek
reconciliation, the inquisitors should already be informed by
witnesses of his heresy or apostasy, or should already have cited
him to appear before the Court to answer the charge, in such a
case the inquisitor shall receive the penitent to
reconciliation&mdash;if he entirely confesses his own errors and
what he knows of the errors of others&mdash;and shall impose upon
him heavier penances than upon the former, even up to perpetual
imprisonment should the case demand it</p>
<p class="footnote">This is merely one of those quibbles that
permeate this jurisprudence. The article in this last respect is
so framed as to make it appear that under such circumstances the
inquisitors would be acting more mercifully than against an
accused heretic; but the latitude of punishment is such that they
need display no such mercy&mdash;perpetual imprisonment being the
punishment prescribed for any heretic (who is not "relapsed )
seeking reconciliation.</p>
<p>But no persons who shall come to confess after expiry of the
period of grace shall be subjected to pecuniary
penances&mdash;unless their Highnesses should mercifully
condescend to remit all or portion of the confiscation incurred
by those so reconciled.</p>
<p class="footnote">This last clause seems rather in the nature
of a provision against any merciful weakness on the Sovereigns'
part.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article IX</b></p>
<p>If any children of heretics having fallen into the sin of
heresy by indoctrination of their parents, and being under twenty
years of age, should come to seek reconciliation and to confess
the errors they know of themselves, their parents and any other
persons, even though they should come after the expiry of the
term of grace, the inquisitors shall receive them kindly,
imposing penances lighter than upon others in like case, and they
shall contrive that these children be tutored in the Faith and
the Sacraments of Holy Mother Church, as they are to be excused
upon the grounds of age and education.</p>
<p class="footnote">They are not, however, to be excused to the
extent of enjoying any of their parents' property. That is
confiscate by virtue of the parents' heresy; and by virtue of
that same heresy on the part of their parents these children and
their own children must remain under the ban of infamy, inhibited
from wearing gold or silver, etc., and from holding any office
under the crown or any ecclesiastical benefice. It seems almost
ironical to talk of imposing light penances upon wretches who are
automatically subject to such penalties as these. But by that
"light penance" Llorente conceives would be meant their wearing a
<i>sanbenito</i> for a couple of years, appearing in it at Mass
and being paraded in it in processions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article X</b></p>
<p>Persons guilty of heresy and apostasy, by the fact of their
having fallen into these sins, incur the loss of all their
property and the administration of it, counting from the day when
first they offended, and their said property is confiscate to
their Highnesses' treasury. But in the matter of ecclesiastical
pains in the case of those reconciled, the inquisitors in
pronouncing upon them shall declare them to be heretics,
apostates, or observers of the rites and ceremonies of the Jews;
but that since they seek conversion with a pure heart and true
faith, and they are ready to bear the penances that may be
imposed, they shall be absolved and reconciled to Holy Mother
Church.</p>
<p class="footnote">The object of this article is really to make
the act of confiscation retrospective where necessary, so as to
circumvent any who should attempt, by alienation of his property,
to avoid its confiscation. Since the confiscation was incurred
upon the date of the first offence against the Faith, the
inquisitors were to trace any property that might subsequently
have been disposed of by the delinquent, and even should it have
gone to the paying of debts or the endowment of a daughter
married to one who was an old and "clean" Christian, the Holy
Office must seize and confiscate it to the Royal Treasury.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XI</b></p>
<p>If any heretic or apostate who shall have been arrested upon
information laid against him should say that he desires
reconciliation and confess all his faults, what Jewish ceremonies
he may have observed, and what is known to him of the faults of
others, entirely and without reservations, the inquisitors shall
admit him to reconciliation subject to perpetual imprisonment as
by law prescribed. But should the inquisitors, in conjunction
with the diocesan ordinary, in view of the contrition of the
offender and the quality of his confession, think well to commute
this penance to another lighter one, they shall have faculty so
to do.</p>
<p>It seems that this should take place chiefly if the heretic at
the first sitting of the court, or upon his first appearance
before it, without awaiting the declaration of his offences,
should announce his desire to confess and abjure; and such
confession should be made before there is any publication of
witnesses or of the matters urged by them against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XII</b></p>
<p>Should the prosecution of an accused have been conducted to
the point of the publication of witnesses and their depositions,
but should he then confess his faults and beg to be admitted to
reconciliation, desiring formally to abjure his errors, the
inquisitors shall receive him to the said reconciliation subject
to perpetual imprisonment, to which they shall sentence
him&mdash;save if in view of his contrition and other attendant
circumstances the inquisitors should have cause to consider that
the reconciliation of such a heretic is simulated; in such case
they must declare him an impenitent heretic and abandon him to
the secular arm: all of which is left to the conscience of the
inquisitors.</p>
<p class="footnote">"Abandonment to the secular arm" is, as shall
presently be considered, the ecclesiastical equivalent to a
sentence of death by fire.<br>
<br>
The term "publication of witnesses" must not be accepted
literally. What it really meant will become clear upDn reading
Article XVI, which was specially framed by Torquemada to modify
and limit this time-honoured custom of civil and ecclesiastical
courts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XIII</b></p>
<p>If any of those who are reconciled during the period of grace
or after its expiry should fail to confess all their own sins and
all that they know of the sins of others, especially in grave
cases, and should such omission arise not from forgetfulness but
from malice, as may afterwards be proved by witnesses, since it
is clear that the said reconciled have perjured themselves, and
it must be presumed that their reconciliation was simulated,
although they may have been absolved let them be proceeded
against as impenitent heretics as soon as the said fiction and
perjury are discovered.</p>
<p>Similarly if any person reconciled at the time of the edict of
grace or afterwards, shall boast himself in public in such a
manner that this can be proved, saying that he did not commit the
sins to which he confessed, he must be deemed impenitent and a
simulated convert, and the inquisitors shall proceed against him
as if he were not reconciled.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XIV</b></p>
<p>If any, upon being denounced and convicted of the sin of
heresy, shall deny and persist in his denial until sentence is
passed, and the said crime shall have been proved against him,
although the accused should confess the Catholic Faith and assert
that he has always been and is a Christian, the inquisitors must
declare him a heretic and so sentence him, for juridically the
crime is proved, and by refusing to confess his error the convict
does not permit the Church to absolve him and use him
mercifully.</p>
<p>But in such cases the inquisitors should proceed with great
care in their examination of the witnesses, closely
crossquestioning them, gathering information on the score of
their characters, and ascertaining whether there exist motives
why they should depone out of hatred or ill-will towards the
prisoner.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XV</b></p>
<p>If the said crime of heresy or apostasy is half-proven
(<i>semiplenamente provado</i>) the inquisitors may deliberate
upon putting the accused to the torture, and if under torture he
should confess his sin, he must ratify his confession on one of
the following three days. If he does so ratify he shall be
punished as convicted of heresy; if he does not ratify, but
revokes his confession as the crime is neither fully proved nor
yet disproved, the inquisitors must order, on account of the
infamy and presumption of guilt of the accused, that he should
publicly abjure his error; or the inquisitors may repeat the
torture.</p>
<p class="footnote">There is nothing in this article that may be
considered as a departure from or an enlargement upon any of the
rules laid down by Eymeric in his "Directorium," as we shall see
when we come to deal with this gruesome subject of torture.<br>
<br>
It is urged by apologists that, when all is said, the torture to
which the inquisitors had recourse, and, similarly, the
punishment of death by fire, were not peculiarly ecclesiastical
institutions; that they were the ordinary civil methods of
dealing with offenders, and that in adopting them the Church had
simply conformed, as was her custom, with that which was by law
prescribed.<br>
<br>
It is quite true that originally these were the methods by which
the secular tribunals proceeded against those who sinned against
the Faith. But it must also be borne in mind that if the civil
authorities so proceeded they implicitly obeyed the bull "ad
extirpanda" of Sixtus IV, which imposed this duty upon them under
pain of excommunication.<br>
<br>
Owing to the inconvenience that attended this procedure in so far
as torture and questions upon matters of Faith were concerned, it
was later accounted desirable that the inquisitors themselves
should take charge of it. They were enjoined, however, to see to
it that there should be no shedding of blood or loss of life,
since it was against the Christian maxims that a priest should be
guilty of such things. So that when by misadventure it happened
that blood was shed or a patient died under the hands of the
torturers, the inquisitor conducting the examination became
guilty of an irregularity. For this he must seek absolution at
the hands of a brother cleric; and the inquisitors were
informed&mdash;to make matters easier for them and to spare them
anxieties in this matter&mdash;that they had the right to absolve
one another under such circumstances.<br>
<br>
But even if we fully admit that the use of torture&mdash;and
similarly of fire&mdash;had been secular institutions of which
the Church had simply availed herself as the only methods that
commended themselves in such an age, it must still be held
against the inquisitors that these methods were by no means
tempered or softened in their priestly hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XVI</b></p>
<p>It being held that the publication of the names of witnesses
who depone upon the crime of heresy might result in great harm
and danger to the persons and property of the said
witnesses&mdash;since it is known that many have been wounded and
killed by heretics&mdash;it is resolved that the accused shall
not be supplied with a copy of the depositions against him, but
that he shall be informed of what is declared in them, whilst
such circumstances as might lead to the identification of the
deponents shall be withheld.</p>
<p>But the inquisitors must, when proof has been obtained from
the examination of the witnesses, publish these depositions,
withholding always the names and such circumstances as might
enable the accused to learn the identity of the witnesses; and
the inquisitors may give the accused a copy of the publication in
such form [i.e. truncated] if he requires it.</p>
<p>If the accused should demand the services of an advocate, he
shall be supplied. The advocate must make formal oath that he
will faithfully assist the accused, but that if at any stage of
the pleadings he shall realize that justice is not on his side,
he shall at once cease to assist the delinquent and shall inform
the inquisitors of the circumstance.</p>
<p>The accused shall pay out of his own property, if he have any,
the services of the advocate; if he have no property, then the
advocate shall be paid out of other confiscations, such being the
pleasure of their Highnesses.</p>
<p class="footnote">It is extremely doubtful if a more flagrant
departure from all the laws of equity would be possible than that
which is embodied in Torquemada's enactment on the subject of
witnesses.<br>
<br>
The notion of an accused hearing nothing of what is deposed
against him, of his not even being informed of the full extent of
such depositions nor yet confronted with his accusers, is beyond
a doubt one of the most monstrously unjust features of this
tribunal. And by taking the fullest advantage of that enactment
and reducing the proceedings to a secrecy such as was never known
in any court, the inquisitors were able to inspire a terror which
was even greater than that occasioned by the fires they fed with
human fuel at their frequent Autos.<br>
<br>
Torquemada based this enactment upon the caution laid down by
Eymeric on the score of divulging the names of witnesses. But
Eymeric went no further than to say that these names should be
suppressed where a possibility of danger to the delators lay in
their being divulged. The accused, however, might have the full
record of the proceedings read to him, and he might infer for
himself who were his accusers. There was no question in Eymeric
of any truncations.<br>
<br>
Torquemada's aim is perfectly clear. It was not based, as is said
in the article, upon concern for any danger that the delators
might incur. For, after all, it shall be made plain before we
conclude the survey of inquisitorial jurisprudence, that the
wounding or even the death of those witnesses would be regarded
(professedly, at least) as an enviable thing; they would be
suffering for the Faith, and thus qualifying for the immortal
crown of martyrdom. Rather was Torquemada's object to remove all
fear that might trammel delators and stifle delations. The
delator must be protected solely to the end that other delators
might come forward with confidence to inform against secret
heretics and apostates, so that the activities of the Holy Office
should suffer no curtailment.<br>
<br>
Trasmiera, a later inquisitor, in the course of an eulogium of
secrecy, speaks of it as "the pole upon which the government of
the Inquisition is balanced, calling for the veneration of the
faithful; it facilitates the delations of witnesses, and it is
the support and foundation of this tribunal; once deprived of it,
the architecture of the edifice must undoubtedly give way."*<br>
<br>
<small>[* "Vida de Arbués," p, 56.<br>
<br>
It is interesting to turn to modern writers who defend this
secrecy&mdash;such, for instance, as the Rev. Sidney Smith, S.J.,
whose good faith there is no cause to doubt. He writes as
follows: "To pass over the question of injury often done to the
reputation of third parties, it has occasionally been forced on
public attention that crimes cannot be put down because witnesses
know that by giving evidence they expose themselves to great
risks, the accused having powerful friends to execute vengeance
in their behalf. This was exactly the case with the Inquisition.
The Marranos had great power through their wealth, position, and
secret bonds of alliance with the unconverted Jews. These would
certainly have endeavoured to neutralize the efforts of the Holy
Office had the trials been open. Torquemada, in his statutes of
1484, gives expressly this defence of secrecy, etc."&mdash;"The
Spanish Inquisition," p. 17, in "Historical Papers."<br>
<br>
The argument is specious, and it is fundamentally true. But when
it is considered that the delator, so carefully screened from all
danger, was protected entirely at the expense of the accused, it
becomes clear that such a procedure must argue a reckless
eagerness to accumulate convictions. It suffices to reflect that,
whilst all the arguments advanced to justify this secrecy could
with equal justice have been urged by the contemporary civil
courts of Europe, it is impossible to point to a single one that
had recourse to so inequitable a measure. The inquisitorial point
of view may be appreciated, even with a certain sympathy, by the
extremely tolerant. It cannot be justified.]</small><br>
<br>
The clause relating to advocates is founded upon the ancient
ecclesiastical law which forbade an advocate to plead for
heretics. His being enlisted under the present clause would
clearly serve to increase the peril of the accused.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XVII</b></p>
<p>The inquisitors shall, themselves, examine the witnesses, and
not leave such examinations to their notaries or others, unless a
witness should be ill or unable to come before the inquisitor and
the inquisitor similarly unable to go to the witness, in which
case he may send the ordinary ecclesiastical judge of the
district with another upright person and a notary to take the
depositions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XVIII</b></p>
<p>When any person is put to the torture the inquisitors and the
ordinary should be present&mdash;or, at least, some of them. But
when this is for any reason impossible, then the person entrusted
to question should be a learned and faithful man (<i>hombre
entendido y fiel</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XIX</b></p>
<p>The absent accused shall be cited by public edict afifixed to
the door of the church of the district to which he belongs, and
after thirty days' grace the inquisitors may proceed to try him
as contumaciously absent. If there is sufficient evidence of his
guilt, sentence may be passed upon him. Or, if evidence is
insufficient, he may be branded a suspect and commanded&mdash;as
is due of suspects&mdash;to present himself for canonical
purgation. Should he fail to do so within the time appointed, his
guilt must be presumed.</p>
<p>Proceedings against the absent may be taken in any of the
following three ways:</p>
<p>(i) In accordance with the chapter "Cum contumatia de
hereticis," citing the accused to appear and defend himself upon
certain matters concerning the Faith and certain sins of heresy,
under pain of excommunication;. if he does not respond, he shall
be denounced as a rebel, and if he persists in this rebellion for
one year he shall be declared a formal heretic. This is the
safest and least rigorous course to adopt.</p>
<p>(2) Should it seem to the inquisitors that a crime against any
absent can be established, let him be cited by edict to come and
prove his innocence within thirty days&mdash;or a longer period
may be conceded if such is necessary to permit him to return from
wherever he may be known to be. And he shall be cited at every
stage of the proceedings until the passing of sentence, when,
should he still be absent, let him be accused of rebellion, and
should the crime be proved he may be condemned in his absence
without further delay.</p>
<p>(3) If in the course of inquisitorial proceedings there is
presumption of heresy against an absent person (although the
crime is not clearly proved) the inquisitors may summon him by
edict commanding him to appear within a given time to clear
himself canonically of the said error, on the understanding that
should he fail to appear, or, appearing, should fail to clear
himself, he shall be deemed convicted and the inquisitors shall
proceed to act as by law prescribed.</p>
<p>The inquisitors, being learned and discriminating, will belect
the course that seems most certain and is most practicsale under
the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="footnote">Any person condemned as contumacious became
an outlaw, whom it was lawful for any man to kill.<br>
<br>
CANONICAL PURGATION, which is mentioned in this article, differs
considerably from ABJURATION, and the difference must be
indicated.<br>
<br>
It is applicable only to those who are accused by the public
voice&mdash;i.e. who have acquired the "reputation" of
heresy&mdash;without yet having been detected in any act or
speech that might cause them to be suspected of heresy in any of
the defined degrees of such suspicion.<br>
<br>
It almost amounts to a distinction without a difference, and is
an excellent instance of the almost laboured equity in which this
tribunal indulged in matters of detail whilst flagrantly
outraging equity in the main issues.<br>
<br>
For Canonical Purgation, says Eymeric, ("Directorium," pars iii.
p. 312,) the accused must find a certain number of sureties or
<i>contpurgatores</i>, the number required being governed by the
gravity of the (alleged) offence. They must be persons of
integrity and of the same station in life as the accused, with
whom they must have been acquainted for some years. The accused
shall make oath upon the Gospels that he has never held or taught
the heresies stated, and the <i>contpurgatores</i> shall swear to
their belief that this is the truth. This Purgation must be made
in all cities where the accused has been defamed.<br>
<br>
The accused shall be given a certain time in which to find his
<i>contpurgatores</i>, and should he fail to find the number
required he shall at once be convicted and condemned as a
heretic.<br>
<br>
And Pegna adds, in his commentary upon this, that any who shall
be found guilty of heresy after having once been in this position
is to be regarded as a "relapso" and delivered to the secular
arm. For this reason he enjoins that Canonical Purgation should
not lightly be ordered, as it is so largely dependent upon the
will of third parties.<br>
<br>
Eymeric adds, further, that sometimes Canonical Purgation may be
ordered to those who are defamed by the public voice but who are
not in the hands of the inquisitors. Should they refuse to
surrender, the inquisitors shall proceed to excommunicate them,
and if they persist in their excommunication for one year they
shall be deemed heretics, and subject to the penalties entailed
by such a sentence.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XX</b></p>
<p>If any writings or trials should bring to light the heresy of
a person deceased, let proceedings be taken against
him&mdash;even though forty years shall have elapsed since the
offence&mdash;let the fiscal accuse him before the tribunal, and
if he should be found guilty the body must be exhumed.</p>
<p>His children or heirs may appear to defend him; but should
they fail to appear, or, appearing, fail to establish his
innocence, sentence shall be passed upon him and his property
confiscated.</p>
<p class="footnote">It will, of course, be obvious that since no
good or useful purpose could be served by instituting proceedings
against the dead, nothing but cupidity can have inspired so
barbarous a decree as this. The avowed object of the
Inquisition&mdash;and very loudly and insistently
avowed&mdash;was the uprooting of heresies to prevent their
spread, and the inquisitors maintained that it was a painful
necessity thrust upon them by their duty to God to destroy those
who persisted in heresy, lest these, by their teaching and
example, should contaminate and imperil the souls of others. Thus
the Inquisition justified itself, and removed all doubt as to the
purity of its motives.<br>
<br>
But how should this justification apply to the trial of the
dead&mdash;even though they should have been dead for over forty
years?<br>
<br>
The provision, however, was not Torquemada's own. He followed in
the footsteps of earlier inquisitors. He found his precedent in
the 120th question propounded by Eymeric&mdash;"Confiscatio
bonorum haeretici fieri potest post ejus mortem." In this the
author of the "Directorium" lays it down that although in civil
law legal action against a criminal ceases with his death, such
is not to be the case where heresy is concerned, on account of
the enormity of the crime. (It may seem that, had he been quite
honest, he would have said, "on account of the profits that may
accrue from the prosecution.")<br>
<br>
Heretics, he pursues, may be proceeded against after their death,
and, if convicted, their property may be confiscated&mdash;and
this within forty years of their decease&mdash;depriving the
heirs of all enjoyment of it, even though the third generation
should be in possession.<br>
<br>
All that Torquemada did was to extend the term of procedure
beyond the forty years to which Eymeric had limited it.<br>
<br>
And to the foregoing Eymeric adds that, should the heirs at any
time have acquired knowledge that the deceased was a heretic,
they shall be censured for having acted in bad faith and kept the
matter secret! By this he actually puts it upon men to come
forward voluntarily and accuse their dead fathers or grandfathers
of heretical practices, to the end that they themselves may be
rendered destitute and infamous to the extent of being
incapacitated from holding any public office or following any
honourable profession&mdash;and this though they themselves
should be the most faithful of Catholics, untouched by the
faintest breath of suspicion!<br>
<br>
It is beyond words a monstrous and inequitable enactment. Yet,
Hke all else, they can justify it. If there is one thing in which
the inquisitors were truly admirable, it is in the deftness with
which they could justify and reconcile with their conscience the
most inhuman practice. They would answer questions as to the
lawfulness of this proceeding by urging that they did it with the
greatest reluctance, but that their duty demanded it to the end
that the living should beware how they failed in fidelity to the
Faith, lest punishment should overtake them in their descendants
after they themselves had passed beyond the reach of human
justice. Thus would they represent the act as salutary and to the
advantage of the Faith. And since there is at least a scintilla
of truth in this, who shall say that they did not tranquillize
their consciences and delude themselves that the confiscations
were a mere incident which nowise swayed their judgment?<br>
<br>
That proceedings against persons deceased were by no means rare
is shown by the frequent records of corpses burnt&mdash;one of
the purposes for which they were exhumed; the other being that
they must cease to defile consecrated ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXI</b></p>
<p>The Sovereigns desiring that inquisition be made alike in the
domains of the nobles as in the lands under the Crown,
inquisitors shall proceed to effect these, and shall require the
lords of such domains to make oath to comply with all that the
law ordains, and to lend all assistance to the inquisitors.
Should they decline to do so, they shall be proceeded against as
by law established.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXII</b></p>
<p>Should heretics who are delivered to the secular arm leave
children who are minors and unmarried, the inquisitors shall
provide and ordain that they be cared for and reared by some
persons who will instruct them in our Holy Faith. The inquisitors
shall prepare a memorial of such orphans and the circumstances of
each, to the end that of the royal bounty alms may be provided to
the extent necessary, this being the wish of the Sovereigns when
the children are good Christians, especially in the case of
girls, who should receive a dower sufficient to enable them to
marry or enter a convent.</p>
<p class="footnote">Llorente tells us that although he went
through very many records of old proceedings of the Inquisition,
in no single instance did he discover a record of any such
provision in favour of, the child of a condemned heretic.
("Historia Critica," vol. ii. p. 15.)<br>
<br>
Harsh as were the decrees of the Inquisition in all things, in
nothing were they so harsh as in the enactments concerning the
children of heretics. However innocent themselves of the heresy
for which their parents or grandparents might have suffered, not
only must they go destitute, but further they must be prevented
from ever extricating themselves appreciably from that condition,
being inhibited&mdash;to the second generation&mdash;from holding
any office under the Crown, or any ecclesiastical benefice, and
from following any honourable or lucrative profession. And, as if
that were not in itself sufficient, they were further condemned
to wear the outward signs of infamy, to go dressed in serge,
without weapons or ornaments, and never ride on horseback, under
pain of worse befalling them. One of the inevitable results of
this barbarous decree was the extinction of many good Spanish
families of Jewish blood in the last decade of the fifteenth
century.<br>
<br>
This the inquisitors understood to be the literal application to
practical life of the gentle and merciful precepts of the sweet
Christ in Whose name they acted.<br>
<br>
Eymeric and his commentator Pegna make clear, between them, the
inquisitorial point of view. The author of the "Directorium"
tells us that commiseration for the children of heretics who are
reduced to mendicity must not be allowed to soften this severity,
since by all laws, human and divine, it is prescribed that the
children must suffer for the sins of the fathers. (Pars iii.
quaest. cxiv. and cxv.)<br>
<br>
The scholiast expounds at length the justice of this measure. He
says that there have been authors, such as Hostiensis, who
pretend that it lacks the equity of the ancient laws, which
admitted Catholic children to inheritance. But he assures us that
they are wrong in holding such views, that there is no injustice
in the provision, and that it is salutary, since the fear of it
is calculated to influence parents and to turn them&mdash;out of
love for their offspring&mdash;from the great crime of
heresy.<br>
<br>
To minds less dulled by bigotry it must have been clear that by
this, as, for that matter, by many other of their decrees, all
that was achieved was to put a premium upon hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
Another consideration that escaped their notice&mdash;being, as
they were, capable of perceiving one thing only at a
time&mdash;was that if this precious measure was prescribed by
all laws, human and divine, it should have been unavoidable. Yet
they themselves provided the means of avoiding it&mdash;as we
know&mdash;for the child vile enough to lay information of his
parents' heresy. By what laws, human or divine, did they dare to
encourage such an infamy? By no law but their own&mdash;a law
whose chief aim, it is obvious at every turn, was to swell the
number of convictions.<br>
<br>
What opinion was held of children who informed against their
parents to avert the awful fate that awaited them should their
parents' heresy be discovered by others, is apparent in the case
of the daughter of Diego de Susan&mdash;who, very possibly, was
actuated by just such motives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXIII</b></p>
<p>Should any heretic or apostate who has been reconciled within
the term of grace be relieved by their Highnesses from the
punishment of confiscation of his property, it is to be
understood that such relief applies only to that property which
by their own sin was lost to them. It does not extend to property
which the person reconciled shall have the right to inherit from
another who shall have suffered confiscation. This to the end
that a person so pardoned shall not be in better case than a pure
Catholic heir.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXIV</b></p>
<p>As the King and Queen in their clemency have ordained that the
Christian slaves of heretics shall be freed, and even when the
heretic is reconciled and immune from confiscation, this immunity
shall not extend to his slaves; these shall be manumitted in any
case, to the greater honour and glory of our Holy Faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXV</b></p>
<p>Inquisitors and assessors and other officers of the
Inquisition, such as fiscal advocates, constables, notaries, and
ushers, must excuse themselves from receiving gifts from any who
may have or may come to have affairs with the Inquisition, or
from others on their behalf; and the Father Prior of Holy Cross
orders them not to receive any such gifts under pain of
excommunication, of being deprived of office under the
Inquisition and compelled to make restitution and repay to twice
the value of what they may have received.</p>
<p class="footnote">Eymeric's "Directorium" permitted the
reception of gifts by inquisitors, provided that these gifts were
not too considerable, but he enjoined inquisitors not to show too
much avidity&mdash;not, it would seem, on account of the sin that
lurks in avidity, but so as not to give scandal to the laity.
(See "Directorium," pars iii. p. 387.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXVI</b></p>
<p>Inquisitors shall endeavour to work harmoniously together; the
honour of the office they hold demands this, and inconveniences
might result from discords amongst them. Should any inquisitor be
acting in the place of the diocesan ordinary, let him not on that
account presume that he enjoys preeminence over his colleagues.
If any difference should arise between inquisitors and they be
unable themselves to adjust it, let them keep the matter secret
until they can lay it before the Prior of Holy Cross, who, as
their superior, will decide it as he considers best.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXVII</b></p>
<p>Inquisitors shall endeavour to contrive that their officers
treat one another well and dwell in harmony and honourably.
Should any officer commit an excess, let them punish him
charitably, and should they be unable to cause an officer to
fulfil his duty, let them advise the Prior of Holy Cross thereof,
and he will at once deprive such a one of his office and make
such an appointment as may seem best for the service of Our Lord
and their Highnesses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>Article XXVIII</b></p>
<p>Should any matter arise for which provision has not been made
by this code, the inquisitors shall proceed as by law prescribed,
it being left to them to dispose as their consciences show them
to be best for the service of God and their Highnesses.</p>
<p class="footnote">To these tvirenty-eight articles Torquemada
was to make further additions&mdash;in January of the following
year, in October of 1488 and in May of 1498. We shall indicate to
them, but for the moment it is sufficient to say
that&mdash;saving some of those of 1498&mdash;they are of
secondary importance, being mainly in the nature of corollaries
upon those we have dealt with, and chiefly concerned with the
internal governance of the Inquisition rather than with its
relations to the outside world.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-11" name="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI. THE JURISPRUDENCE
OF THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE MODE OF PROCEDURE</h2>
<p>No complete notion of the jurisprudence of the HolyOffice can
be formed without taking a glance at this tribunal at work and
observing the methods upon which it proceeded in its dealings
with those who were arraigned before it.</p>
<p>Its scope has already been considered, and also the offences
that came within its pitiless jurisdiction at the time of
Torquemada's appointment to the mighty office of Grand Inquisitor
and President of the Suprema. It remains to be added that in his
endeavours to cast an ever-wider net he sought to increase the
jurisdiction of the Inquisition beyond matters immediately
concerned with the Faith and to include certain offences whose
connection with it was only constructive.</p>
<p>Whether he succeeded to the full extent of his aims we do not
know. But we do know that he contrived that bigamy should become
the concern of the Holy Office, contending that it was primarily
an offence against the laws of God and a defilement of the
Sacrament of Marriage. Adultery, which is no less an offence
against that sacrament, and which is not punishable by civil law,
he passed over; but he contrived that sodomy should be brought
for the first time within inquisitorial jurisdiction and that
those convicted of it should be burnt alive.</p>
<p>Himself a man of the most rigid chastity, he must have been
moved to anger by the unchastity so prevalent among the clergy.
It was, however, beyond his power to deal with it without special
authority from Rome, and he would have been bold indeed to have
sought such authority at the hands of that flagrant paterfamilias
Giovanni Battista Cibo, who occupied the Chair of St. Peter with
the title of Pope Innocent VIII.</p>
<p>The most scandalous form of this unchastity was that known as
"solicitation"&mdash;<i>solicitatio ad turpia</i>&mdash;or the
abuse of the confessional for the purpose of seducing female
penitents. It was a matter that greatly vexed the Church as a
body, since it placed a terrible weapon in the hands of her
enemies and detractors. It was admittedly rampant, and it is more
than probable that it was directly responsible for the
institution of the confessional-box&mdash;enforced in the
sixteenth century&mdash;which effectively separated confessor
from penitent, and left them to communicate through a grille.</p>
<p>The matter, like all other offences of the clergy, was
entirely within the jurisdiction of the bishops, who would
vigorously have resisted any attempts on the part of Torquemada
to encroach further upon their province. So the Church was left
to combat that evil as best she might; and, with the exception of
an odd bishop who assumed a stern attitude and dealt with it as
became his own dignity and the honour of the priesthood, the
utmost lenience appears to have prevailed,* as we may judge by
the penances imposed upon convicted offenders.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Llorente's "Historic Critica," I, cap.
xxviii.]</p>
<p>The perils and temptations to which a priest was exposed in
the course of the intimate communications that must pass between
him and his penitents were given full recognition and allowed
full weight in the balance against the offence itself.</p>
<p>Later on, however, this matter which Torquemada had considered
beyond his power was actually thrust within the jurisdiction of
the Inquisition by a Church resolved, for the very sake of its
existence, that the evil should cease.</p>
<p>Vexatious as this crime of "solicitation" had always been, it
became most urgently and perilously so after the Reformation,
when it provided those who denounced the confessional with an
apparently unanswerable reason for their denunciations. It was
wisely thought that the methods of the Holy Office were best
calculated to deal with it, and the matter was relegated to the
inquisitors. The defilement of the sacrament was the link that
connected solicitation with heresy. Moreover, in some cases there
might be heresy of a more positive kind; as when, for instance,
the priest assured the penitent that her consent was not a sin.
And the woman accusing a priest of solicitation before the Holy
Office was always questioned closely upon this particular
point.</p>
<p>In the later editions of the "Cartilla," or Manual for the
guidance of I nquisitors&mdash;all of which publications were
issued by the private press of the Inquisition&mdash;are to be
found under the heading "Causas de Solicitacion" instructions for
the examination of a woman who denounces a priest upon these
grounds.*</p>

Press pf the Holy Office, Valencia, 1736.]</p>
<p>Even so, however, it could not be in the interests of the
Church to parade these offenders, and thus expose the sore places
in her own body.</p>
<p>Limborch urges that delinquents be sent to the galleys, or
even delivered to the secular arm. But for that&mdash;as Llorente
points out&mdash;it would have been necessary to include them in
an Auto de Fé, of which there could be no question on account of
the scandal which must ensue in view of the character of the
offence. This is very true, and none can doubt the desirability
of avoiding publicity for such a matter, or suppose that the
Church was in the least blameworthy for so proceeding. At the
same time, however justifiable we may account this secrecy, it is
almost impossible to justify the lenience of the sentences that
were passed. It is above all extraordinary that the usual
punishment did not even go so far as to unfrock these offenders.
The inquisitors confined themselves to depriving the convicted
priest of the faculty of hearing confessions in future, and
imposed a penance of some years' residence in the seclusion of a
convent.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that this punishment was heavier than
may at first appear. For&mdash;to their credit be it
said&mdash;the regulars into whose convent the penanced cleric
was sent undertook that this penance should be anything but
easy.</p>
<p>This comes to light in the course of a case of which Llorente
cites the full particulars from the records he unearthed.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Pistoria Critica," I. cap. xxviii.]</p>
<p>It is the case of a Capuchin brother tried in the eighteenth
century by the Grand Inquisitor Rubin de Cevallos; and as much in
the quality and extent of the offence as in the brazenly
ingenious defence set up by the friar, the record reads like one
of the least translatable stories from Boccaccio's "Decameron."
He was sentenced to go into retreat for five years in a convent
of his order; and so great a dread did that sentence strike into
the Capuchin that he besought of the inquisitors the mercy of
being allowed to serve the sentence in one of the dungeons of the
Inquisition. Questioned as to his reasons for a request that
sounded so extraordinary, he protested that he knew too well the
burden his brethren were wont to impose upon a friar penanced as
was he.</p>
<p>His petition was dismissed, the Grand Inquisitor refusing to
alter the sentence; and Llorente adds that the Capuchin died
three years later in the convent to which he was sent.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>How far the crime was rampant when the Inquisition was
entrusted with its prosecution may be gathered from the
statistics given by H. C. Lea.* It appears from these that in the
city of Toledo alone, during the first thirty-five years that the
matter was in the hands of the Holy Office, fifty-two sentences
were passed upon priests found guilty of "solicitation," and it
is not to be supposed, as Lea very shrewdly observes, that
delations were forthcoming in more than a proportion of the cases
that occurred, or that more than a proportion of these delations
could lead to conviction&mdash;since, to avert scandal as much as
possible, no action would be taken save where the indications of
guilt were very clear.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "History of the Spanish Inquisition," vol.
iv. p. 135.]</p>
<p>This view is certainly supported by the injunction of caution
and the other instructions in the Manual under the heading
"Causas de Solicitaciones," already cited.</p>
<p>Finally on this subject, Llorente's statistics show that the
offenders were chiefly friars; the proportion of secular priests
convicted being only one in ten. This does not, however, signify
greater chastity on the part of secular priests. Llorente offers
the obvious explanation&mdash;an explanation too obvious to need
repeating here.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Ciitica," I. cap. xxviii).]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Another offence that came later to be added to those within
the jurisdiction of the Holy Office was that of usury. But in
Torquemada's day neither this nor solicitation was allowed to be
the concern of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>In its methods of procedure the tribunal of the Holy Office
under the zealous rule of the Prior of Holy Cross followed
closely upon the lines laid down by Eymeric. Indeed in the
"Cartilla" or "Manual" that was issued later for the use of
inquisitors&mdash;of which several editions are in existence
to-day&mdash;these rules taken bodily from the "Directorium" were
incorporated as a supplement to the code promulgated by
Torquemada, consisting of the articles already considered and of
others to be added later.</p>
<p>These methods we will now consider.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The accused was brought before the tribunal sitting in the
audience-chamber of the Holy Office&mdash;or Holy House (<i>Casa
Santa</i>) as the premises of the Inquisition came to be
styled.</p>
<p>The court was composed of at least one of the inquisitors
delegated by Torquemada, the diocesan ordinary, the fiscal
advocate, and a notary to take down all that might transpire.
They were seated about a table upon which stood a tall crucifix,
between two candles, and the Gospels upon which the accused was
to be sworn.</p>
<p>The oath being administered, the prisoner was asked his name,
birthplace, particulars of his family, and the diocese in which
he resided. Next he was vaguely questioned as to whether he had
heard speak of such matters as those upon which he was
accused.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Eymeric, pars iii. p. 286&mdash;"Modus
interrogandi reum accustum."]</p>
<p>Pegna warns inquisitors against being too precise in their
questions, lest they should suggest answers to the accused.*
Another reason for this vagueness was that being precisely
questioned the accused might in his answers confine himself to
the matter of those questions, whilst where the inquiry was
conducted in vague, general terms, he might in his reply betray
matters or persons hitherto unsuspected.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Directorum," pars. iii. Schol, xix.]</p>
<p>Obviously with the same end in view, the scholiast suggests
that the accused be asked whether he knows why he has been
arrested, and whom he suspects of having accused him; whilst as a
means of instantlytesting whether he is an observer of his
Catholic duties the inquisitors are instructed to ask him who is
his confessor and when he was last at confession. The answer of
one who was secretly an apostate, or even who had neglected to
comply with his religious duties as prescribed, must necessarily
be enormously incriminating. It would justify violent suspicion
of heresy against him, which has already been considered,
together with its consequences.</p>
<p>Pegna further enjoins inquisitors to be careful that they do
not afford the accused any means of evading their questions, and
not to be imposed upon by protestations or tears, heretics being,
he assures them, of an extreme cunning in dissembling their
errors.</p>
<p>Eymeric specifies ten different methods employed by heretics
to trick inquisitors. These are not of any real importance, nor
do they leave us in the least convinced that any such ruses were
actually employed. They are obviously based upon an intimate
acquaintance with priestly guile rather than upon any experience
of the craftiness of actual heretics. They may, in short, be said
to be just such ruses as the inquisitors themselves might employ
if they found the tables turned upon themselves and the heretic
sitting in the seat of justice.</p>
<p>He urges the inquisitors to meet guile with guile: "ut clavus
clavo retundatur." He justifies recourse to hypocrisy and even to
falsehood, telling the inquisitors that thus they will be in a
position to say: "Cum essem astutus dolo vos cepi," and to the
ten evasive methods which he asserts are adopted by heretics, he
bids their paternities oppose ten specified rules by which to
capture and entrap them.</p>
<p>These rules and Pegna's commentaries upon them are worth
attention for the sake of the intimate glimpse they afford us of
the mediaeval ecclesiastical mind.</p>
<p>The accused is to be compelled by repeated examinations to
return clear and precise answers to the questions asked.</p>
<p>If the accused heretic is resolved not to confess his fault,
the inquisitor should address him with great sweetness (<i>blande
et mansuete</i>), giving him to understand that all is already
known to the court, speaking as follows:</p>
<p>"Look now, I pity you who are so deluded in your credulity,
and whose soul is being lost; you are at fault, but the greater
fault lies with him who has instructed you in these things. Do
not, then, take the sin of others upon yourself, and do not make
yourself out a master in matters in which you have been no more
than a pupil. Confess the truth to me, because, as you see, I
already know the whole affair. And so that you may not lose your
reputation, and that I may shortly liberate and pardon you and
you may go your ways home, tell me who has led you&mdash;you who
knew no evil&mdash;into this error."</p>
<p>By similar kind words (<i>bona verba</i>), always
imperturbable (<i>sine turbatione</i>), let the inquisitor
proceed, assuming the main fact to be true and confining his
questions to the circumstances.</p>
<p>Pegna adds another formula, which he says was employed by Fr.
Ivonet. Thus:</p>
<p>"Do not fear to confess all. You will have thought they were
good men who taught you so-and-so; you lent ear to them freely in
that belief, etc...You have behaved with credulous simplicity
towards people whom you believed good and of whom you knew no
evil. It might very well happen to much wiser men than you to be
so mistaken."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. xxvii (pars iii.).]</p>
<p>Thus was the wretch coaxed to self-betrayal, caressed and
stroked by the velvet glove that muffled and dissembled the iron
hand within.</p>
<p>In the case of a heretic against whom the witnesses have not
supplied matter for complete conviction, let him be brought
before the inquisitor and let the inquisitor question him at
random. When the accused shall have denied something (<i>quando
negat hoc vel illud</i>) that has been put to him, let the
inquisitor take up the minutes of the preceding examinations,
turn the leaves and say:</p>
<p>"It is clear that you conceal the truth; cease to employ
dissimulation."</p>
<p>Thus the accused may suppose that he is convicted, and that
the minutes supply proof against him.</p>
<p>Or let the inquisitor hold a document in his hand, and when
the accused denies, let him feign astonishment and exclaim:</p>
<p>"How can you deny such a thing? Is it not clear to me?" He
will then peruse his document anew, making changes, and then
reading once more, let him say, "I was right! Speak, then, since
you perceive that I know."</p>
<p>The inquisitor must be careful not to enter into any details
that might betray his ignorance to the accused. Let him keep to
generalities.</p>
<p>If the accused persists in his denial, the inquisitor may tell
him that he is about to set out upon a journey and that he
doesn't know when he will be returning. Thus:</p>
<p>"Look now, I pity you, and I wanted you to tell me the truth,
for I am anxious to expedite the affair and yourself But since
you are obstinate in refusing to confess, I must leave you in
prison and in irons until I return; and I am sorry, because I do
not know when I shall return."</p>
<p>If the accused persists in denial, let the inquisitors
multiply examinations and questions; then either the accused will
confess, or (becoming confused) will contradict himself If he
contradicts himself that will suffice to put him to torture, that
thus the truth may be extracted from his mouth. But frequent
interrogations should not be employed save with one of extreme
stubbornness, because to frequent questions upon the same matter
it is easy to obtain variable answers; there is hardly anybody
who would not be surprised into a contradiction.</p>

From Colmenar's "Délices d'Espagne."<br>
<br></p>
<p>Here we have a glimpse of the extraordinary flexibility of the
inquisitorial conscience. The letter of the law must ever be
observed in all proceedings; but its spirit must by all means be
circumvented where it is expedient to do so. Certain conditions,
presently to be examined, must be present before an accused could
be put to torture. One of these was that under examination he
should contradict himself. This rule they scrupulously observed;
but they had no qualms on the score of bringing about the
requisite condition by a trick&mdash;of compelling the accused to
contradict himself by repeated questions upon the same subject.
And Eymeric himself admits that hardly anybody could avoid
varying in his answers under such a test.</p>
<p>It may be uncharitable to suppose that the last paragraph of
this rule is intended as a hint rather than as the warning it
pretends to be. But it is a suspicion which the further
consideration of the inquisitorial conscience must inspire in
every thoughtful mind. It is so much of a piece with the
inquisitors' extraordinary attitude towards the letter of the law
to proceed in that way.</p>
<p>If the accused still persists in denial, the inquisitor should
now soften his conduct; let him contrive that the prisoner has
better food, and that worthy people visit him and win his
confidence; these shall then advise him to confess, promise that
the inquisitor will pardon him (<i>faciet sibi gratiam</i>), and
that they themselves will act as mediators.</p>
<p>The inquisitor himself may in the end go so far as to join
them, and promise to accord grace (i.e. pardon) to the accused,
and grant him this grace in effect, since all is grace that is
done in the conversion of heretics; penances being themselves
graces and remedies. When the accused, having confessed his
crime, demands the promised "grace," let him be answered in
general terms that he shall receive even more than he could ask,
so that the whole truth maybe discovered and the heretic
converted*&mdash;"and his soul saved, at least," adds
Pegna.**</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Directorium," iii. p. 293.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. xxix. (lib. iii.).]</p>
<p>Thoroughly to appreciate the deliberate duplicity here
practised, it is necessary to take into account the double or
even treble meaning of the term grace&mdash;"gratia
"&mdash;employed by Eymeric, and having in Spanish (i.e. its
equivalent "gracia") precisely the same meanings as in Latin.</p>
<p>Although not so popularly used in these various meanings, the
English term "grace" can also signify (a) the prerogative of
mercy exercised as a complete pardon, (b) the same prerogative
exercised to relieve part of the penalty incurred, or (c) a state
of acceptance with God.</p>
<p>The accused was deliberately led to suppose that "gratia" was
employed in the sense of a complete pardon. It remained with the
inquisitor to quiet his conscience for this <i>suggestio
falsi</i> by preferring the letter to the spirit of his promise;
he would enlighten the accused that by "grace" no more was meant
than a remission of part of the penalty incurred (an
insignificant remission usually), or even that all that he had in
mind was the grace of divine favour into which his soul would
enter&mdash;so that this might be saved at least, as Pegna
explains.</p>
<p>Pegna has a good deal more to say on the same subject, and all
of it is extremely interesting.</p>
<p>He propounds the questions: "May an inquisitor employ this
ruse to discover the truth? If he enters into such a promise is
he not obliged to keep it?" By this latter question he means, of
course, the promise to pardon which the prisoner was given to
understand was made him.</p>
<p>He proceeds to tell us that Dr. Cuchalon decided the first of
these questions by approving the use of dissimulation, justifying
it by the instance of Solomon's judgment between the mothers.</p>
<p>It really seems as if there is nothing that theologians cannot
justify by inversion, subversion, or perversion of some precedent
(more or less apocryphal in itself) to suit their ends.</p>
<p>The scholiast himself agrees with the reverend doctor, and
considers that although jurisconsults may disapprove of such
methods in civil courts, it is quite fit and proper to use them
in the courts of the Holy Office; explaining that the inquisitor
has ampler powers than the civil judge [which seems to be an
extraordinary reason for justifying his abuse of them].</p>
<p>Thus, Pegna pursues, in this edifying treatise upon the uses
of hypocrisy, provided that the inquisitor does not promise the
offender absolute impunity, he may always promise him "grace"
(which by the offender is taken to signify "absolute impunity")
and keep his promise by diminishing somewhat the <i>canonical</i>
pains that depend upon himself.</p>
<p>In actual practice this would mean that a heretic who has
incurred the stake may be promised pardon if he will confess to
the sins of which it is necessary to convict him before he can be
burnt. And when, having confessed and delivered himself into the
hands of the inquisitor, he claims his pardon, he is to be
satisfied with the answer that the pardon meant was pardon for
his sins&mdash;absolution, that his soul may be saved when they
burn his body.</p>
<p>On the score of the second question propounded by the
scholiast&mdash;"If the inquisitor enters into such a promise is
he not obliged to keep it?"&mdash;he answers it by telling us
that many theologians do not consider there is any such
obligation on the part of the inquisitor. This attitude they
explain by urging that such a fraud is salutary and for the
public good; and, further, that if it is licit to extract the
truth by torture, it is surely much more so to accomplish it by
dissimulation&mdash;<i>verbis fictis</i>.</p>
<p>This is the general but by no means the universal opinion, we
gather. There are some writers who are opposed to it. And now the
scholiast becomes more extraordinary still. Hear him:</p>
<blockquote>"These two divergent opinions may be reconciled by
considering that whatever promises the inquisitors make, they are
not to be understood to apply to anything beyond the penalties
whose rigour the Inquisition has the right to
lessen&mdash;namely, canonical penances, and not those by law
prescribed."</blockquote>
<p>He writes this knowing that these promises are understood by
the prisoner to mean something very different&mdash;that the
prisoner is desired so to understand them, made so to understand
them.</p>
<p>The honesty of Pegna's reasoning is not to be suspected. He is
not an apologist of the Holy Office writing for the world in
general, and employing bad arguments perforce because he must
make the best of the only ones available, even though he should
lapse into suspicion of bad faith. He is writing, as a preceptor,
for the private eye of the inquisitor. Therefore we can only
conclude that these learned casuists who plunge into such
profundities of thought and pursue such labyrinthine courses of
reasoning had utterly failed to grasp the elementary moral fact
that falsehood does not lie in the word uttered, but in the idea
conveyed.</p>
<p>"However little," he continues, in the course of polishing
this gem of casuistry, "may be the remission granted by the
inquisitor, it will always be sufficient to fulfil his
promise."</p>
<p>You see what a stickler he is for the letter of the law. You
shall see a good deal more of the same sort of thing before we
have gone much further.</p>
<p>But here the scholiast begins to labour. His conscience is
stirring; possibly a ray of doubt penetrates his gloomy
confidence that right is wrong and wrong is right. And so, we
fancy, to quiet these uneasy stirrings comes the last paragraph
on this subject:</p>
<p>"However, for greater safety of conscience, inquisitors should
make no promises save in very general terms, and never promise
more than they can fulfil."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Directorium," iii. Schol. xxix.]</p>
<p>There is one more of Eymeric's ruses for combating the guile
of stubborn heretics:</p>
<p>Let the inquisitor obtain an accomplice of the accused, or
else a person esteemed by the latter and in the inquisitor's
confidence, and engage him to talk often to the accused and
extract his secret from him. If necessary, let this person
pretend to be of the same heretical sect, to have abjured through
fear, and to have declared all to the inquisitor.</p>
<p>Then one evening, when the accused shall have gained
confidence in this visitor, let the latter remain until he can
say that it is too late to return home and that he will spend the
night in the prison. Let persons be suitably placed to hear the
conversation of the accused and if possible a notary to take down
in writing the confessions of the heretic, who should now be
drawn by the spy into relating all that he has done.</p>
<p>Upon this subject Pegna moralizes* for the benefit of the spy,
pointing out how the latter may go about his very turpid task
without involving himself in falsehood or besmirching in the
least the delicate, sensitive soul that we naturally suppose must
animate him.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Directorium," iii, Schol. xxvi.]</p>
<blockquote>"Be it noted that the spy, simulating friendship and
seeking to draw from the accused a confession of his crime, may
very well pretend to be of the sect of the accused, but" [mark
the warning] "he must not say so, because in saying so he would
at least commit a venial sin, and we know that such must not be
committed upon any grounds whatever."</blockquote>
<p>Thus the scholiast. He makes it perfectly clear that a man may
simulate friendship for another for the purpose of betraying that
other to his death; that to make that betrayal more certain he
may even pretend to hold the same religious convictions; all this
may he do and yet commit no sin&mdash;not even a venial
sin&mdash;so long as he does not actually clothe his pretence in
words. What a store the casuist sets by words!</p>
<p>It is just such an argument as Caiaphas might have employed
with Judas Iscariot one evening in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It is a cherished thesis with apologists of the Holy Office
that in its judicial proceedings it did neither more nor less
than what was being done in its day in the civil courts; that if
its methods were barbarous&mdash;if they shock us now&mdash;we
are to remember that they were the perfectly ordinary judicial
methods of their time.</p>
<p>But there was no secular court in Europe in the fifteenth
century&mdash;steeped as that century was in dissimulation and
bad faith&mdash;that would not have scorned to have made such
dishonourable and dishonouring methods as these an acknowledged,
regular and integral part of its procedure.</p>
<p>Pegna himself reveals the fact, when he finds it necessary
further to justify these practices precisely because they were
not in use in the civil courts:</p>
<blockquote>"Perchance the authority of Aristoteles&mdash;who out
of the bosom of Paganism condemned all manner of
dissimulation&mdash;may be opposed to us, as well as that of the
jurisconsults who disapprove of artifices of which judges may
make use to extract the truth. But there are two forms of
artifice: one addressed to an evil end, which must not be
permitted; the other aiming at discovering truth, which none
could blame."*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. xxvi. lib. iii.]</p>
<p>When confession has been obtained it would be idle, Eymeric
points out, to grant the delinquent a defence. "For although in
civil courts the confession of a crime does not suffice without
proof, it suffices here." The reason advanced for this is as
specious as any in the "Directorium": "Heresy being a sin of the
soul, confession may be the only evidence possible."</p>
<p>Where an advocate was granted to conduct the defence of an
accused, we have seen in Art. XVI of Torquemada's "Instructions"
that he was under the obligation to relinquish such defence the
moment he realized the guilt of his client, since by canon law an
advocate was forbidden to plead for a heretic in any court, civil
or ecclesiastical, or in any cause whatsoever&mdash;whether
connected with heresy or any other matter.</p>
<p>On the subject of witnesses, it should be added to what
already has been said in the previous chapter that the
Inquisition, whilst admitting the testimony of any man, even
though he should be excommunicate or a heretic, so long as such
testimony was adverse to the accused, refused to admit witnesses
for the defence who were themselves tainted with heresy.</p>
<p>Since to bear witness in defence of a person charged with
heresy might result in the witness himself becoming suspect, it
will be understood that witnesses for the defence were not easily
procured by the accused.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-12" name="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. THE JURISPRUDENCE
OF THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE AUDIENCE OF TORMENT</h2>
<p>Eymeric's cold-blooded directions for leading an accused who
refused to confess into contradictions that should justify his
being put to torture have already been considered.</p>
<p>The inquisitors could not proceed to employ the
question&mdash;as the torture was euphemistically
called&mdash;save under certain circumstances prescribed by law;
and the strict letter of the law, as you have seen, and as you
shall see further, was a thing inviolable to these very subtle
judges.</p>
<p>These circumstances, as expounded by Eymeric in his
"Directorium,"* are (a) the inconsistence of the accused's
replies upon matters of detail whilst denying the main fact; (b)
the existence of semi-plenal proof of his offence.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Pars iii. quaest. lxi.]</p>
<p>This semi-plenal proof is considered forthcoming&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>(a) When an accused is "reputed" to be a heretic and
there is but one witness against him who can depone to having
seen or heard him do or say that which is against the Faith. (Two
witnesses were by law required to establish his guilt.)<br>
<br>
(b) When in the absence of witnesses there are grounds for
vehement or violent suspicion.<br>
<br>
(c) When there is no evil "reputation" attaching to the accused,
but one witness against him and <i>grounds</i> for vehement or
violent suspicion&mdash;i.e. not actual suspicion but indications
of it; a suspicion of suspicion, as it were. The distinction is
most elusively fine.</blockquote>
<p>The scholiast Pegna adds in his commentaries that this
combination of "reputation" (or grounds for suspicion) and one
witness is not necessary to justify submitting the accused to the
question&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>(a) When to evil reputation are added evil morals,
which lead easily to heresy&mdash;thus those who are incontinent
and very greatly addicted to women persuade themselves that this
incontinence is not in itself a sin. (Such an opinion if
proclaimed would amount to heresy, therefore one who acts as if
he held it lays himself open to suspicion of heresy.)<br>
<br>
(b) When the accused who has incurred evil reputation shall have
fled. (The circumstance of his flight is accepted as evidence of
evil conscience.)*</blockquote>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. cxviii.; lib. iii.]</p>
<p>Eymeric further enjoins that the question shall be employed
only when all other means of obtaining the truth shall have
failed, and he recommends the use of exhortation, gentleness, and
ruse to draw the truth from the prisoner.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Directorium," pars iii. p. 313 <i>et
seq</i>.]</p>
<p>He observes that, after all, not even the torture can be
depended upon always to extract the truth. There are weak men who
under the first torments confess even what they have not done;
and there are others so stubborn and vigorous that they can
suffer the greatest pains; there are those who having already
undergone torture are able to endure it with greater fortitude,
knowing how to adapt themselves to it; and there are others still
who, by having recourse to sorcery, remain almost insensible to
the pain and would die before divulging anything.</p>
<p>These last, he warns inquisitors, use passages from the Gospel
curiously inscribed upon virgin parchment, intermingling in these
the names of angels that are unknown, designs of circles, and
magic characters. These charms they bear about their bodies.</p>
<p>"I don't yet know," he confesses, "what remedies are available
against these sorceries; but it will be well to strip and closely
to examine the patient before putting him to the question."</p>
<p>He recommends that when the accused has been sentenced to
torture, and whilst the executioners are making ready to perform
it, the inquisitor should continually endeavour to induce the
accused to confess. The torturers should strip him with
precipitation, but with a sorrowful air and almost as if troubled
for him (<i>quasi turbati</i>). When stripped, he should be taken
aside and once more exhorted to confess. His life may be promised
him, provided that the crime of which he is accused is not such
as to make it forfeit.</p>
<p>If all proves vain the inquisitor shall proceed to the
question, beginning by interrogating him upon the more trivial
matters of which he is accused, as he would naturally acknowledge
these more readily (and when acknowledged they can be made the
steppingstones to more), the notary being at hand to write down
all that is asked and answered.</p>
<p>If he persists in his denials he is to be shown further
implements of torture, and assured that he will have to undergo
them all unless he speaks the truth.</p>
<p>If he still denies, the question may be <i>continued</i> on
the second or third day, but not <i>repeated</i>.</p>
<p>Here again we have them observing the letter and flagrantly
violating the spirit of the law. Torture must not be repeated
because it is by law forbidden to put an accused to the question
more than once, unless in the meantime fresh evidence has been
forthcoming; but it is not forbidden to continue it&mdash;not
forbidden because those who formulated that law never dreamt of
such a quibble being raised.</p>
<p>It is almost incredible that men should juggle with words in
this way. But here is the passage itself:</p>
<p>"Ad continuandum non ad iterandum, quia iterari non debent,
nisi novis supervenientibus indiciis, sed continuari non
prohibentur."</p>
<p>Lest they should be in danger of having to repeat the torture,
they took care to suspend it as soon as the patient was at the
limit of his endurance, and merely resumed or continued it two or
three days later, to suspend again and continue again as often as
they might deem necessary.</p>
<p>That it can have made no difference to the wretched patient
whether they described the procedure by one verb or the other
does not appear to have weighed with them. There was a
difference&mdash;an important verbal difference.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Upon this point the apologist Garcia Rodrigo, in his "Historia
Verdadera de la Inquisicion," very daringly draws attention to
the meekness of the courts of the Inquisition as compared with
the civil tribunals. He contrasts the methods of the two, and to
make out a case in favour of the former, to prove to us that
those who preached a gospel of mercy knew also how to practise
mercy, he tells us, rather disingenuously, that whilst in civil
courts a prisoner might be ordered three times to the torture, in
the courts of the Inquisition this could not be imposed upon him
more than once&mdash;<i>its rules forbidding repetition</i>.</p>
<p>He does not consider it worth while to add that the
"Directorium" in which he found that rule points out, as we have
seen, how it may be circumvented.</p>
<p>It is much easier to set up a case for the other side, to show
that the greater mercy in the matter of torture was practised by
the secular courts. In these, for instance, a nobleman was immune
from torture. Not so in the courts of the Inquisition, which
proceeded, no doubt, upon the grounds that all are equals in the
sight of God. No exception was made there in favour of any man.
And in Aragon, where the torture was never applied in civil
trials, it was none the less resorted to by the inquisitors.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>When the accused shall have endured torture without
confessing, the inquisitors may order his re ease by sentence,
stating that after careful examination they are unable to find
anything against him on the score of the crime of which he is
accused&mdash;which, of course, is no acquittal, since he may at
any time be re-arrested and put upon his trial once more.</p>
<p>In his commentaries Pegna tells us* that there are five
degrees of torture. He does not mention them in detail, saying
that they are sufficiently well known to all. These five degrees
are given in Limborch.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. cxviii.; lib. iii.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Inquisitionis," p. 332.]</p>
<p>The first four are not so much torture as terror&mdash;or
mental torture; it is only in the fifth degree that this becomes
physical. The conception is of an almost fiendish subtlety; and
yet its aim, we must believe, was merciful, since they accounted
it more merciful to torture and terrify the mind than to bruise
the flesh.</p>
<p>Eymeric's directions are the basis of this, although Eymeric
himself does not break up the procedure into degrees. These
are:</p>
<p>(1) The threat of torture.</p>
<p>(2) Being conducted to the torture-chamber and shown the
implements and their functions.</p>
<p>(3) Stripping and preparing for the ordeal.</p>
<p>(4) Laying and binding upon the engine.</p>
<p>(5) The actual torture.</p>
<p>The actual torture was of various kinds, any of which the
inquisitor might employ as he considered most suitable and
effective, but Pegna admonishes him not to resort to unusual
ones. Marsilius, the scholiast informs us, mentions fourteen
different varieties, and adds that he had imagined others, such
as that of depriving a prisoner of sleep. In this he appears to
have received the approval of other authors, but he does not
receive Pegna's. Even the scholiast is shocked at an
ecclesiastic's fertility of invention in this branch, and
confesses that such researches are better suited to executioners
than theologians.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that the records show none of that
fiendish invention which is so widely believed to have been
exercised. The cruel subtleties of the inquisitors were spiritual
rather than physical, and we have just seen Pegna's censure of an
inquisitor who gave his attention to the devising of novel and
ingenious torments.</p>
<p>It is very clear, from the records we have, that the Holy
Office must have been content to depend upon the engines already
in existence, or, rather, upon a limited number of the most
efficacious. There were exceptions, of course. The torture of
fire&mdash;which consisted in toasting the feet of the patient
after anointing them with fat&mdash;appears upon rare occasions
to have been employed; and a barbarous piece of supererogative
cruelty was practised at a great Auto de Fé held at Valladolid in
1636: ten Jews convicted of having whipped a crucifix were made
to stand with one hand nailed to an arm of a St. Andrew's cross
whilst sentence of death was being read to them.</p>
<p>As a rule, however, both in torturing and in punishing the
inquisitors avoided novelties. For the question they usually
resorted to one of three methods: the rack; the <i>garrucha</i>,
which is the torture of the hoist, the <i>tratta di corda</i> of
the Italians; and the <i>escalera</i>, or <i>potro</i>, or
ladder, or water torture.</p>
<p>The inquisitors attended in person&mdash;as prescribed by
Torquemada&mdash;to question the patient, accompanied by their
notary, who wrote down in fullest detail an account of the
proceedings.</p>
<p>The hoist was the simplest of all engines; it consisted of no
more than a rope running through a pulleyattached to the ceiling
of the torture-chamber.</p>
<p>The patient's wrists were pinioned behind him, and one end of
the rope was attached to them. Slowlythen the executioners drew
upon the other end, gradually raising the patient's arms behind
him as far as they would go, backwards and upwards, and
continuing until they brought him to tip-toe and then slowly off
the ground altogether, so that the whole weight of his body was
thrown upon his straining arms.</p>
<p>At this point he was again questioned and desired to confess
the truth.</p>
<p>If he refused to speak, or if he spoke to no such purpose as
his questioners desired, he was hoisted towards the ceiling, then
allowed to drop a few feet, his fall being suddenly arrested by a
jerk that almost threw his arms out of their sockets. Again was
the question put, and if he continued stubborn he was given a
further drop, and so on until he had come to the ground once
more, or until he had confessed. If he reached the ground without
confessing, weights were now attached to his feet, thus
increasing the severity of the torture, which was resumed. And so
it continued. The weights were increased, the drops were
lengthened&mdash;or else he might be left hanging&mdash;until
confession was extracted, or until with dislocated shoulders the
patient had reached the limit of his endurance.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See, <i>inter alia</i>, Melgares Marin,
"Procedimientos de la Inquisicion," i. p. 253. This author says
that sometimes the patient would be left hanging for as long as
three hours.]</p>
<p>In the latter case the torture might be suspended, as we have
seen, to be continued two or three days later, when the prisoner
should sufficiently have recovered.</p>
<p>The notary made a scrupulous record of the
<i>audiencia</i>&mdash;the weights attached, the number of hoists
endured, the questions asked and the answers delivered.</p>
<p>The potro, or water-torture, was more complex, far more cruel,
and appears to have been greatly favoured by the Holy Office.</p>
<p>The patient was placed upon a short narrow engine, in the
shape of a ladder, and this was slanted a little so that his head
was below the level of his feet, for reasons that will soon be
apparent. His head was now secured by a metal or leather band
which held it rigidly in position, whilst his arms and legs were
lashed to the sides of the ladder so tightly that any movement on
his part must cause the whipcord to cut into his flesh.</p>
<p>In addition to these bindings garrotes were applied to his
thighs and legs and arms. This was a length of cord tied firmly
about a limb&mdash;upon occasion round the whole torso over the
arms; a stick was thrust between the cord and the flesh, and by
twisting this stick a tourniquet was formed; first strangury,
then the most agonizing pain was thus occasioned, whilst if the
twisting was carried far enough the cords would sink through
nerve and sinew until they reached the bone.</p>
<p>The mouth of the patient was now distended and held so by a
prong of iron&mdash;called a bostezo. His nostrils were plugged,
and a long strip of linen was placed across his jaws, and carried
deep into his throat by the weight of water poured into his
gaping mouth. Down this <i>toca</i>&mdash;as the strip was
called&mdash;water continued to be slowly poured. As this water
filtered through the cloth, the patient was subjected to all the
torments of suffocation, the more cruel because he was driven by
his instincts to make futile efforts to ease his condition. He
would constantly exert himself to swallow the water, hoping thus
to clear the way for a little air to pass into his bursting
lungs. A little would and did pass in&mdash;just enough to keep
him alive and conscious, but not enough to mitigate the horrible
sufferings of asphyxiation, for the cloth was always wet and
constantly charged with water.</p>
<p>From time to time the <i>toca</i> was brought up, and the
gasping wretch would be invited to confess. Further to combat
stubbornness on his part, and also, it would seem, to revive him
when he was failing, the executioners would give an agonizing
turn or two to the garrotes upon his&mdash;or her&mdash;limbs;
for the Holy Office did not discriminate between the sexes in
these matters.</p>
<p>To prevent the vomiting which any form of torture might
produce, and the <i>potro</i> in particular, the inquisitors,
with their never-failing attention to detail, provided that no
patient should be given food for eight hours before the question
was applied. The notary present at this <i>audiencia de
tormento</i> was required to set down, in addition to questions
asked and answers returned, the fullest details of the torture
applied, and particularly how many jars of water were
administered, these being the measure of the severity of the
ordeal.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Melgares Marin, "Procedimientos," i.
p. 256.]</p>
<p>The rack is too well-known to need describing here, having in
its time been used in all European countries. Cruel as it was, it
was perhaps one of the least cruel engines of torture that have
been employed.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It was required by law that any confession extracted under
torture should afterwards be ratified by the prisoner. This was
one of the prescriptions of Alfonso XI in the Partidas code. It
recognizes that a man might be driven by pain to say that which
is not true, and therefore it forbids the courts to accept as
evidence what might be declared under torture.</p>
<p>Therefore on one of the three days after the question had been
applied&mdash;as soon, presumably, as the prisoner was
sufficiently recovered to attend&mdash;the prisoner was brought
once more into the audience-chamber.</p>
<p>His confession, reduced to writing by the notary, was placed
before him, and he was invited to sign it&mdash;the act being
necessary to convert that confession into admissible evidence. If
he signed, the proceedings now ran swiftly and uninterruptedly to
their end. If he refused to sign, repudiating the statements
made, the inquisitors proceeded upon the lines laid down by
Torquemada in Article XV of his "Instructions" to meet the
case.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Pegna warns inquisitors against delinquents who feign madness
to avoid the torture. They should not, he says, delay on that
account, for the torture may be the best means of ascertaining
whether the madness is real or simulated.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. cxviii. lib. iii.]</p>
<p>Finally let it be added upon this gruesome subject that it was
not only the accused who was liable to be put to the question. A
witness suspected of falsehood, or one who had lapsed into
contradictions in the course of his evidence, might be put to
torture <i>in caput alienum</i>?</p>

<h2><a id="ch-13" name="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. THE
JURISPRUDENCE OF THE HOLY OFFICE&mdash;THE SECULAR ARM</h2>
<p>The comparatively light sentences imposed upon those who came
forward to abjure heresies which they were suspected of
harbouring, and upon those who submitted to canonical purgation
to cleanse them of "evil reputation," have already been
considered.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the Holy Office dealt with
<i>negativos</i>&mdash;i.e. those who persisted in refusal to
confess a first offence of heresy or apostasy after their guilt
had been established to the satisfaction of the court&mdash;and
with <i>relapsos</i>&mdash;i.e. those who were convicted of
having relapsed into error after once having been penanced and
pardoned.</p>
<p>Offenders in either of these two classes were to be abandoned
to the secular arm&mdash;the ecclesiastical euphemism for death
by fire. The same fate also awaited impenitent heretics and
contumacious heretics.</p>
<p>He who after having been convicted by sufficient witnesses
persisted in denying his guilt should, says Eymeric, be abandoned
to the secular arm upon the ground that he who denies a crime
which has been proved against him is obviously impenitent.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Directorium," pars ii. quaest.
xxxiv.]</p>
<p>The impenitence is by no means obvious. It is possible, after
all, that the accused might deny because he was innocent and a
good Catholic. And whilst, as we shall see, this possibility is
not altogether ignored, yet it is given very secondary
consideration. It was the inquisitor's business to assume the
guilt of any one brought before him.</p>
<p>It is true, however, that Eymeric urges the inquisitors to
proceed very carefully in the examination of the witnesses
against such a man; he recommends them to give the accused time
in which to resolve himself to confess, and to employ every
possible means to obtain such confession.</p>
<p>He counsels them to confine the prisoner in an uncomfortable
dungeon, fettered hand and foot; there to visit him frequently
and exhort him to confess. Should he ultimately do so, he is to
be treated as a penitent heretic*&mdash;in other words he is to
escape the fire but suffer perpetual imprisonment.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Directorium," iii. p. 338.]</p>
<p>The term perpetual imprisonment, or perpetual immuration, is
not to be accepted too literally. It lay at the discretion of the
inquisitors to modify and commute part of such sentences, and
this discretion they exercised so far as the imprisonment was
concerned. But the confiscation of the prisoner's property and
the infamy attaching to himself, his children, and his
grandchildren&mdash;by far the heavier part of the
punishment&mdash;could not in any way be commuted.</p>
<p>However tardily confession might come from the
<i>negativo</i>, the inquisitors must accept and recognize it.
Even if he were already bound to the stake, and, at last, being
taken with the fear of death, he turned to the friar who never
left him until the faggots were blazing, admitted his guilt and
offered to abjure his heresy, his life would be spared. And this
for all that they recognized that a confession in such extremes
was wrung from him by "the fear of death rather than any love of
truth."</p>
<p>It must naturally occur to any one that, conducted in secret
as were the examinations of the witnesses, and no opportunity
being afforded the accused of demolishing the evidence offered
against him, since he was rarely informed of its extent, many a
good Catholic, or, at least, many a man innocent of all heretical
practices, must have gone to his death as a <i>negativo</i>. For
the methods of the Holy Office opened the door extraordinarily
wide to malevolence; and human nature being such as it
is&mdash;and such as it was in the fifteenth century&mdash;it is
not to be supposed that malevolence never seized the chance, that
it never slunk in through that gaping door to vent itself in such
close and sheltered secrecy&mdash;to strike in the back, in the
dark, with almost perfect immunity to itself, at the man who was
hated, or envied, or whom it was desired to supplant.</p>
<p>It was not sufficient for the prisoner to protest his
innocence. He must prove it categorically. An innocent man might
be unable to furnish categorical proof; witnesses for the defence
were extremely difficult to obtain by one who was charged with
heresy; it was a dangerous thing to testify in favour of such a
man; should his conviction none the less follow, the witness for
the defence might find himself prosecuted as a befriender, or
<i>fautor</i>, of heretics. Yet, even when testimony for the
defence was obtained, the judges leaned upon principle to the
side of the accusers; and since they considered it their mission
to convict rather than to judge, they would always assume that
the accusers were better informed than the defenders.</p>
<p>Therefore this danger of death to the innocent existed. The
inquisitors themselves did not lose sight of it, for they lost
sight of nothing. But how did they provide for it? Pegna has a
great deal to say upon the subject. He tells us that some
authorities pretend that when a <i>negativus</i> protests that he
staunchly believes all that is taught by the Roman Catholic
Church such a man should not be abandoned to the secular arm.</p>
<p>But this is an argument mentioned by the scholiast merely that
he may demolish it. It is indefensible, he says with confidence;
and, as indefensible, it is almost universally rejected.</p>
<p>Torquemada most certainly did not favour it. He lays it down
clearly in Art. XXIV of his first "Instrucciones" that a
<i>negativo</i> must be deemed an impenitent heretic, however
much he may protest his Catholicism. The accused will not satisfy
the Church, which demands confession of his fault solely that she
may pardon it; and she cannot pardon it until it is confessed.
That is the inquisitorial view of the matter.</p>
<p>It is evident that the danger of occasionally burning an
innocent man did not perturb the inquisitorial mind. In fact,
Pegna reveals to the full the equanimity with which it could
contemplate such an accident.</p>
<p>"After all," says he, "should an innocent person be unjustly
condemned, he should not complain of the sentence of the Church,
which was founded upon sufficient proof, and which cannot judge
of what is hidden. If false witnesses condemned him, he should
receive the sentence with resignation, and rejoice in dying for
the truth."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Sed si fortassis per iniquos testis est
convictus, ferat id aequo animo ac Isetatur quod pro veritatem
patiatur." "Directorium," pars iii. Schol. lxvi.]</p>
<p>He is also, we are to suppose, to rejoice with the same
lightheartedness at the prospect of his children's destitution
and infamy.</p>
<p>Anything, it seems, is possible to argument, and the craziest
argument may be convincing to him who employs it. Pegna makes
this abundantly clear.</p>
<p>An innocent man might be tempted to save his life by a
falsehood, by making the desired confession; and many a man may
so have escaped burning. This also the scholiast duly weighs. He
propounds the question whether a man convicted by false witnesses
is justified in saving his life by a confession of crimes which
he has not committed.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Schol. lxviii. pars iii.]</p>
<p>He contends that, reputation being an external good, each is
at liberty to sacrifice it to avoid torments that are hurtful, or
to save his life, which is the most precious of all
possessions.</p>
<p>In this contention the scholiast lacks his usual speciousness.
He has entirely overlooked that whether an innocent man confesses
or not, whether he is burnt or sent to perpetual imprisonment,
his reputation is equally blasted. The inquisitors see to that.
His silence is interpreted as impenitence.</p>
<p>But it is evident that Pegna himself is not quite satisfied
with what he urges. He vacillates a little. Strong swimmer though
he is, these swirling waters of casuistry begin to give him
trouble. He seems here to turn in an attempt to regain the shore.
"Who thus accuses himself," he concludes, "commits a venial sin
against the love which he owes himself and a falsehood in
confessing a crime which he has not committed. This falsehood is
particularly criminal when uttered to a judge who examines
juridically, for it then becomes a mortal sin. And even though it
were no more than venial, it would not be permitted to commit it
for the sake of avoiding death or torture."</p>
<p>"Therefore," he sums up, "however hard it may seem for an
innocent man condemned as a <i>negativus</i> to die under such
circumstances, his confessor must exhort him not to accuse
himself falsely, reminding him that if he suffers death with
resignation he will obtain the martyr's immortal crown."</p>
<p>In short, to burn at the stake for crimes never committed is a
boon, a privilege, a glory to be enjoyed with a profound
gratitude towards the inquisitors who vouchsafed it. One cannot
help a pang of regret at the thought that the scholiast himself
should have been denied that glory.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>A person was considered <i>relapsus</i>&mdash;relapsed into
heresy&mdash;not only if, as in the case of the self-delator who
availed himself of the edict of grace, he had once been pardoned
an avowed heresy, but if he had once abjured a heresy of which he
had been suspected either vehemently or violently. And it was of
no account whether the heresy of which he was now convicted was
that particular one of which formerly he had been suspected, or
an entirely fresh one. Moreover, to convict as a relapsed heretic
one who had already abjured, it was sufficient to show that he
held intercourse with heretics.</p>
<p>Further, a person would be dealt with as <i>relapsus</i> in
the event of formal proof appearing that he had actually
committed the heresy which he had abjured as suspect, although
his conduct since abjuration might have been entirely blameless.
For it was argued that these fresh proofs, although acquired
after abjuration, revealed the person's real guilt, and showed
that he had been judged too leniently in being allowed to abjure
merely upon suspicion.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Eymeric, lib. ii.; qusest. lviii. and
Pegna, lib. ii.; Schol. lxiv.]</p>
<p>In fact, it was held that he had acted in bad faith towards
the inquisitors; that he had neglected to confess his sin when he
was given the opportunity; that he had attempted to defraud the
treasury of his property, which was due to it by confiscation.
Since he had not made an open and complete confession, it was
argued that he was clearly an impenitent heretic, for whom there
could be no mercy&mdash;or only a very slight one, as we shall
see.</p>
<p>Canonical purgation entailed the same sequel as abjuration for
one against whom proofs of heresy were afterwards forthcoming.
Thus, to quote an instance given by Pegna: if a man should be
suspected of thinking that heretics should be tolerated, and if
after being canonically purged of the offence against the Faith
contained in that sentiment of which he was suspected, it should
be proved against him that his acts or words had actually
expressed that sentiment, he must be considered a relapsed
heretic.</p>
<p>Torquemada further decreed that any who after reconciliation
should fail to fulfil the penance imposed upon him, or any part
of it, must be deemed relapsed. The argument, obviously, was that
a neglect of this penance showed a want of proper contrition,
which could only be explained in one way.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>A relapsed heretic, once his guilt was thoroughly established,
must be "abandoned to the secular arm," and this notwithstanding
any repentance he might manifest or any promises he might make
for the future. "<i>Sine audientia quacumque</i>," says Eymeric.*
"In effect," adds his commentator, "it is enough that such people
should once have defrauded the Church by false
confession"*&mdash;a statement this, diametrically opposed to the
injunction of the Founder of Christianity on the score of
forgiveness.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lib. iii. p. 331.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lib. ii. Schol. lxiv.]</p>
<p>All the mercy they vouchsafed a relapsed heretic who confessed
and expressed repentance was the mercy of being strangled at the
stake before his body was burnt.</p>
<p>Eymeric instructs inquisitors to see that the prisoner is
visited and entertained on the subject of contempt for this
world, the miseries of this life and the joys of Paradise. He
should be given to understand that there is no hope of his
escaping temporal death, and he should be induced to put the
affairs of his conscience in order. He is to be accorded the
sacraments of Penitence and the Eucharist if he solicits them
with humility. Further, the inquisitor is advised not to visit
him personally, lest the sight of him should excite the sin of
anger in the doomed man, and so turn him from the sentiments of
patience and penance which are to be inspired in him.</p>
<p>It would seem at least that the inquisitors had no delusions
as to the sentiments which the sight of them inspired in their
victims, just as it seems that they were able to endure these
with Christian resignation&mdash;perhaps even with that sense of
martyrdom of him who accounts himself misunderstood or
misjudged.</p>
<p>After some days thus employed in preparing the prisoner for
death, the inquisitor should advise the secular justices of the
day and hour and place when and where he would abandon to them a
heretic. At the same time an announcement should be made to the
people inviting them to attend, as the inquisitor is to preach a
sermon of the Faith, and those who are present will gain the
usual indulgences.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Eymeric, lib. iii. p. 331.]</p>
<p>It is not necessary at present to enter into particulars of
the dread ceremonial, the ghastly, almost theatrical, solemnities
that went to compose the greatest horror that has sprung from the
womb of Christianity: the Auto de Fé.</p>
<p>"An Asiatic," says Voltaire, "arriving in Madrid on the day of
an Auto de Fé, would doubt whether here was a festival, a
religious celebration, a sacrifice, or a massacre. It is all of
these. They reproach Montezuma with sacrificing human captives to
God. What would he have said had he witnessed an Auto de
Fé?"*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Essai sur les Moeurs."]</p>
<p>Occasion to enter into these details will occur later. We are
more concerned at the moment with the words of the inquisitors
than with their acts, and it is necessary on the subject of the
laws that governed the Auto de Fé to touch upon quite the most
extraordinary of all the quibbles by means of which the Holy
Office avoided&mdash;in the letter&mdash;committing an
irregularity.</p>
<p>Nothing in the whole of its jurisprudence savours more rankly
of hypocrisy than this matter of abandoning a heretic to the
secular arm. It is the very last word in that science which it is
the fashion to call "Jesuitism," but which we think might quite
as aptly and justly be termed "Dominicanism." Yet it would be
very rash to say that these men were prompted by conscious
hypocrisy. Such is certainly not the inference to be drawn from
their jurisprudence. Stupidity&mdash;the stupidity of the man of
one idea, of the man who is able to perceive but one thing at a
time&mdash;was, rather than hypocrisy, responsible for what they
did.</p>
<p>They were imbued with a passion for formality, for procedure
that should be scrupulously correct, scrupulously in accordance
with the letter of the law; and they justified their
circumvention, their perversion of its spirit, with crazy
arguments that must at least have been convincing to themselves,
obfuscated as they were by the fanaticism that bubbled through
their extraordinary intelligences.</p>
<p>We say that these arguments must have been convincing to
themselves, because we find them in books that were never
intended to be perused by any but inquisitors and ecclesiastics.
Since these books were never meant to be placed before the world,
no suspicion can attach to them of having deliberately and
hypocritically resorted to sophistries for the purpose of
hoodwinking the lay mind.</p>
<p>It was themselves they hoodwinked&mdash;by the arguments they
themselves conceived&mdash;and although it is undeniable that
they practised a deception which must provoke the scorn of every
thoughtful man, yet it must be remembered that this deception was
the selfdeception that lies in wait for every fanatic, whatever
the subject of his fanaticism. By staring too long and too
intently at one object, that object itself becomes blurred and
indistinct.</p>
<p>"<i>Ecclesia abhorret a sanouine</i>."</p>
<p>That was the principle that governed them. Conceive it!</p>
<p>The tenet that a Christian must not be guilty of shedding
blood or causing the death of a fellow-creature has been touched
upon more than once in these pages. It has been seen how in the
very dawn of Christianity the Christian's refusal to bear arms in
the service of the State gave rise to friction with the Roman
authorities, and, being construed into insubordination, was one
of the causes of the persecutions to which Christians were
subjected in the first and second centuries. As time went on,
under stress of the necessities of this world, the Christian was
forced to abandon that fine and loftily humanitarian ideal. Soon
he had not only abandoned it under pressure of expediency, but he
had forgotten it altogether; so that he donned the cross of the
crusader, and went forth sword in hand, exultantly, to shed the
blood of the infidel in the name of that tender Founder Whose
disciple had brought to Rome the great Message of
Forbearance.</p>
<p>But however much it might be accounted justifiable and even
necessary for the Christian layman to wield the sword, the priest
still continued under the prohibition to shed blood or compass
the death of any man. And if a priest lay under such an
injunction, so must a tribunal that was controlled by
priests.</p>
<p>Therefore it follows that not only was it admittedly illicit
for the inquisitor to pass a capital sentence, to send a man to
his death, but even to be in any way a party to such an act.</p>
<p>This was the letter of the law, and, happen what might, that
letter must suffer no violence. Nor did it. When the accused was
found guilty of heresy, when he was impenitent, or relapsed, the
inquisitor was careful that the sentence he passed contained no
single word that could render him responsible for the
delinquent's death. Far from it. The inquisitors earnestly
implored the secular justiciaries to whom they abandoned him not
to do him any hurt whatever.</p>
<p>But consider the actual formula of the sentence as prescribed
by Eymeric. It concluded thus:</p>
<blockquote>"The Church of God can do no more for you, since you
have already abused its goodness...Therefore we cast you out from
the Church, and we abandon you to the secular justice, beseeching
it none the less, and earnestly, so to moderate its sentence that
it may deal with you without shedding your blood or putting you
in danger of death."*</blockquote>

<p>They were careful not so much as to say that they
<i>delivered</i> him to the secular arm; for delivery suggests
activity in a matter in which they must remain absolutely
passive. They merely <i>abandoned</i> him. Pilate-like, they
washed their hands of him. If the secular justiciaries chose to
bear him away and burn him at the stake in spite of their
"earnest intercessions" to the contrary, that was the secular
justiciaries' affair.</p>
<p>Thus was the letter of the law most scrupulously observed, and
the inquisitor displayed in his intercession on the heretic's
behalf the benignity proper to his sacerdotal office. His
conscience was entirely at peace.</p>
<p>For the rest, he knew, of course, that there was a bull of
Innocent IV, known as "ad extirpanda," which compelled the
secular justiciaries, under pain of greater excommunication, and
of being themselves prosecuted as heretics and <i>fautores</i>,
to put to death within a term of not more than five days any
convicted heretic taken within their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Francesco Pegna recommends inquisitors to be careful not to
omit the intercession on the prisoner's behalf, lest they should
render themselves guilty of an irregularity. At the same time he
raises the interesting question whether an inquisitor can
reconcile this intercession with his conscience&mdash;not, as you
might suppose, upon the score of the dissimulation it entails;
but purely on the ground that it is most strictly forbidden to
intercede on behalf of heretics; to do so, indeed, is to incur
suspicion of being a befriender of heretics&mdash;an offence as
punishable as heresy itself.</p>
<p>This question he has no difficulty in answering. Thus:</p>
<p>"In truth it would not be permitted to employ for a heretic an
intercession that would be of any advantage to him, or which
tended to hinder the justice which is to be executed upon his
crime, but only an intercession whose aim it is to relieve the
inquisitor of the irregularity he might otherwise incur."</p>
<p>He goes on to say that when the heretic has been abandoned to
the secular justiciaries, the latter must pronounce their own
sentence and conduct him to the place of execution, permitting
him to be accompanied by pious men, who will pray for him and not
leave him until he shall have delivered up his soul. And he
reminds the inquisitors&mdash;though it hardly seems
necessary&mdash;that should the magistrates delay in putting to
death a heretic who has been abandoned to them, they must be
regarded as <i>fautores</i> and themselves prosecuted.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Innocent IV, as we have seen, allowed the magistrates a term
of five days in which to do their duty in this matter, and in
Italy it was usual to take the heretics back to prison after
sentence, and bring them forth again upon a week-day&mdash;always
within the prescribed term&mdash;to be burnt. In Spain, however,
the custom was that the magistrates having pronounced their own
sentence&mdash;as soon as the heretic was abandoned to
them&mdash;should immediately proceed to execute it.</p>
<p>According to some authorities the sentence, by which was meant
the Auto de Fé generally, should not take place in church. Pegna
agrees with these, but not upon the score of the desecration of
sanctuary, which was their reason. He agrees because in a large
open space higher scaffolds can be erected for the Auto, and
greater multitudes can assemble to witness this uplifting
spectacle of the triumph of the Faith. On the same grounds does
he belittle those who maintain that heretics should not be put to
death on Sundays. He considers it quite the best day of the week,
and excellent the Spanish custom that appoints it for the Auto,
"for," he says, "it is good that large multitudes should attend,
so that fear may turn them from evil ways; the spectacle being
one that inspires the attendance with terror and presents a
fearful image of the last judgment."</p>
<p>That it is expedient to put heretics to death no pious
authority has ever ventured to dispute. But there have been
differences of opinion on the subject of the means by which this
should be done. The scholiast is entirely on the side of the
large majority that considers fire the proper instrument, and
actually cites the Saviour's own authority for this: "If a man
abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch that is withered;
and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are
burned" (John XV. 6).<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>If the accused should happen to be a cleric, he must be
unfrocked and degraded by a bishop before being arrayed in the
hideous <i>sanbenito</i> and abandoned to the secular arm, whilst
those convicted of contumacy were&mdash;if still absent at the
time of the sentence&mdash;to be burnt in effigy pending their
capture, when, without further trial, they would be burnt
alive.</p>
<p>In effigy also were burnt those convicted after death, these
effigies being cast into the flames together with the remains of
the dead man, which were exhumed for the purpose.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Reference has several times been made here to the
<i>sanbenito</i>, which was imposed upon all whom the Holy Office
found guilty of heresy, whether reconciled or abandoned, and also
upon those who were suspected in the degree <i>violenter</i>.</p>
<p>In this garment they attended the Auto de Fé, and went to
execution if they were abandoned; or they might be required to
wear it for varying periods after reconciliation, and in some
instances for as long as they lived, to advertise their
infamy.</p>
<p>It was the perversion into a garb of shame and disgrace of the
penitential garment originally prescribed by St. Dominic; for
whereas once it&mdash;or, rather, that from which it was
derived&mdash;had been worn even by princes as an outward mark of
contrition for the sins into which they had fallen, it was now
imposed that it might subject its wearer to opprobrium and
contempt.</p>
<p>St. Dominic's instructions were that it should be a sackcloth
habit, of the kind worn by his own brotherhood, and that its
colour might be at the discretion of the wearer so long as it was
sombre. As it had ever been the custom of the Church to bless the
"sack" or tunic worn by members of religious confraternities or
by those upon whom it had been imposed as a penance, such a
garment was called a <i>saco bendito</i>, which in course of time
was contracted into <i>sanbenito</i>, though also known by its
proper Spanish name oi <i>zamarra</i>.</p>
<p>When the crusade against the Albigensian heretics was at its
height in Southern France, not only did the crusaders wear the
cross upon their garments, but all faithful Catholics assumed it
for their protection; for&mdash;as on the night of the St.
Bartholomew, some four centuries later&mdash;no man's life was
safe if he did not display that device. St. Dominic desired that
the penitent should enjoy the same protection, but so that his
penance should still be proclaimed, he was ordered to wear two
crosses, one on each breast.</p>
<p>Later, when the wars of religion had ceased, and the general
wearing of the cross was abandoned, the Council of Toulouse
decreed, in 1229, that these penitential crosses should be
yellow, whilst the Council of Beziers, four years later, going
further into the matter, ordained that they should be two and a
half hands long (vertical) by two hands wide (horizontal), and
that they should be made of cloth of the width of three fingers.
Instead of being worn upon the breast, as hitherto, they were now
placed one on the breast and one on the back, with a third on the
hood or veil if hood or veil were worn.</p>
<p>For abettors of heresy the following solemn penance was
enjoined by the Council of Tarragona in 1242:</p>
<blockquote>"On All Saints', on the First Sunday in Advent, on
the feasts of Christmas, the Circumcision, the Epiphany, St. Mary
of February (Purification), St. Mary of March, and all Sundays in
Lent, the penitents shall go to the Cathedral to take part in the
procession. They shall be dressed only in their shirts, barefoot,
their arms crossed, and they shall be whipped in the procession
by the bishop or parish priest. Similarly shall they repair to
the Cathedral on Ash Wednesday in their shirts, barefoot, their
arms crossed, and submit to banishment from church for all Lent;
so that during that season they must remain at the church door
and hear the service thence. On Thursday in Holy Week they shall
come to the church to be reconciled in accordance with the
canonical provisions, it being understood that this penance of
remaining out of the church through Lent and of being whipped in
procession on the days appointed shall be performed yearly for
the remainder of the penitents' lives."</blockquote>
<p>At first, and down to Eymeric's day, the <i>sanbenito</i>
preserved its original form&mdash;a tunic similar to that worn by
the members of regular orders. But in the fourteenth century it
was altered to a scapulary or tabard, with an opening at the top
through which the head was passed; it was to be of the full width
of the body, and to descend no lower than the knees, lest it
should too closely resemble the scapulary which the regulars wore
in addition to their tunic. Soon after it was resolved that it
should be of yellow sackcloth, and that the crosses should be
red.</p>
<p>Once this stage was reached, it may be said that the
transition from a garment solely of penitence into a garment
chiefly of shame and infamy was complete.</p>
<p>We have said that the imposition of the <i>sanbenito</i> had
been falling into desuetude during the fifteenth century. But for
Torquemada it might indeed have become entirely obsolete. It
happened, however, that the Prior of Holy Cross perceived the
virtues of it, the salutary results to be obtained from parading
the victims of the Holy Office in that hideous garb. Therefore he
revived it, and strongly enjoined its use by all offenders save
those against whom there was no more than evil reputation, and
who submitted themselves to be purged of this canonically.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center">PROCESSION TO AUTO DE FÉ<br>
From Limborch's "Historia Inquisitionis."</p>
<p>It was not, however, until the famous Ximenes de Cisneros, who
became Grand Inquisitor some ten years after Torquemada's
death&mdash;that the <i>sanbenito</i> attained its full
development, the form which it was to preserve until the
extinction of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Cisneros substituted for the ordinary rectangular cross worn
on back and breast of the <i>sanbenito</i> an aspa, or St.
Andrew's cross, and he otherwise disposed that the
<i>sanbenito</i> might proclaim the offence and sentence of its
wearer. Three varieties were devised for those who were abjuring
a heresy of which they had incurred suspicion: the suspect of the
degree <i>leviter</i> wore a perfectly plain <i>sanbenito</i>
without any cross or other device; the suspect <i>vehementer</i>
wore upon back and breast one arm only of the St. Andrew's cross;
the suspect <i>violenter</i> was made to wear the full cross.</p>
<p>Those actually convicted of heresy wore in addition to the
<i>sanbenito</i> a tall mitre, or pyramidal cap, made of
cardboard and covered with yellow sackcloth; and that their
precise condition might be distinguished, the following
differentiations were prescribed: the heretic who repented before
the passing of sentence, and who&mdash;not being a
relapsed&mdash;was not to die by fire, bore upon the breast and
back of his <i>sanbenito</i> and upon the front and back of his
<i>coroza</i>, as the mitre was called, a full St. Andrew's
cross; the relapsed heretic who had repented before the Auto
bore, in addition to the crosses, the device of a bust upon
burning faggots on the nether part of his <i>sanbenito</i>;
further his <i>sanbenito</i> and <i>coroza</i> were flecked with
tongues of flame, which pointed downwards to signify that he was
not to die by fire, although his body was to be burnt. He had
deserved the charity of being strangled at the stake before the
faggots were ignited. And this mercy, be it added, the Holy
Office conceded to any heretic who at the eleventh hour confessed
his guilt and desired to make his peace with the Church and die,
as it were, upon her loving bosom. To this end the condemned was
accompanied from the Auto to the stake by two friars, who never
ceased to exhort him to make confession, save his body from the
temporal torment of physical fire, and his soul from the eternal
torment of spiritual fire.</p>
<p>Finally, the impenitent heretic bore the same devices as the
relapsed penitent, but in his case the tongues of flame pointed
upwards to show that he was to die by them, and his
<i>sanbenito</i> was further daubed with crude paintings of
devils&mdash;horrible, grotesque caricatures&mdash;to advertise
the spirits ruling over his soul.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Something should by now have been gathered of the spirit of
the Inquisition as reflected in the pages of Eymeric and his
commentator Pegna in that "Directorium" upon which such copious
draught has been made for these chapters upon the Jurisprudence
of the Holy Office. It is worth while, before proceeding, to cite
another author's views upon Justice and Mercy as understood by
the Inquisition, and to consider an illuminating passage from the
pen of Garcia de Trasmiera.</p>
<p>This Trasmiera&mdash;to whom reference has been made
already&mdash;was an Aragonese, an inquisitor who lived in the
seventeenth century&mdash;nearly two hundred years after the
epoch with which we are here concerned. We might go to a score of
other sources, from Paramo downwards, for very similar
sentiments, and the only reason for choosing this particular
passage from Trasmiera is that it is almost in the nature of an
epitome.</p>
<p>He seems to summarize the very arguments with which Torquemada
and his delegates convinced themselves not merely of the
righteousness, but of the inevitability&mdash;if they were to do
their duty by God and man, and fulfil the destinies for which
they had been sent into this world&mdash;of the task to which
they had set their hands.</p>
<p>"These two virtues of Mercy and Justice," says the Aragonese
writer, with all the authority of an Evangelist, "are so closely
united in God, although we imperfectly judge them to be opposed,
that Divine Wisdom but avails Itself of the one, the more
gloriously to exercise the other. The most proper effect of the
Divine Mercy, none doubts, is the salvation of souls, and who can
doubt that what in this court of the Inquisition appears to be
rigour of Justice is really medicine prescribed by Mercy for the
good of the delinquents? Just as it would be a barbarous judgment
to attribute to cruelty on the part of the surgeon the cautery of
fire which he employs to destroy the contagious cancer of the
patient, so it would be crass ignorance to suppose that these
laws which appear to be severities are prescribed for any purpose
other than that which governs the surgeon in curing his patient,
or a father in punishing his child. Says the Holy Ghost: 'Who
does not use the rod hates the child,' and elsewhere: 'God
punishes whom He loves.'"*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Vida de Arbués," p. 57.]</p>
<p>Could perversity of interpretation go further? In Rome, in
Torquemada's day, the Father of Christianity was granting
absolutions, commuting the punishment of hanging to pecuniary
penances where such penances were solicited, and justifying such
commutation by reminding Christianity that God does not desire
the death of a sinner, but rather that he should live and be
converted.</p>
<p>It would seem as if Inquisitor and Pontiff did not see eye to
eye in this matter of Mercy and Justice. To the credit of the
Pontiff be it said.</p>
<p>Trasmiera, echoing the inquisitorial casuistry of centuries,
holds that the rigour of Justice is prescribed by Mercy for the
good of the delinquents. The impenitent Judaizer was sent to the
stake. How could that redound to his good in this world or the
next? We could admit a certain logical consummation of their
arguments if the inquisitors had confined themselves to burning
those who repented, or those who were innocent even; by burning
these whilst they were in a state of grace they would have
ensured their salvation by abstracting them from all perils of
future sin. But to burn the impenitent upon such grounds as they
themselves urged, believing, as they did, that just as surely as
his mortal part was burnt there at the stake, just so surely
would his immortal part burn through all eternity in
hell&mdash;that was, clearly, by their own lights, to perpetrate
the murder of his soul.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-14" name="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. PEDRO ARBUES DE
EPILA</h2>
<p>There is no difficulty in believing Llorente's
statement&mdash;based upon extracts from contemporary
chronicles&mdash;to the effect that the Inquisition was not
looked upon with favour in Castile. It was impossible that a
civilized and enlightened people should view with equanimity the
institution of a tribunal whose methods, however based
fundamentally upon those of the civil courts, were in the details
of their practice so opposed to all conceptions of equity.</p>
<p>In no Catholic country does the cherishing of a fervent faith,
in itself, imply respect for the clergy. Nor, for that matter,
does the respect of any religion in itself signify respect for
those who administer it. It appears to do so; it is even
prescribed that it should; but in point of fact it seldom does,
other than with simple peasant classes. The ministers, after all,
are men; but by virtue of their office they labour under
disadvantages greater than the ordinary man's. When they display
the failings to which all men are subject, these failings wear a
much graver aspect by virtue of the office they hold and the
greater purity which that office implies. Holiness is looked upon
as the priest's trade, and it is expected that he should conduct
that trade honestly, as any layman conducts the affairs by which
he earns his livelihood. The only test of honesty in the priest,
of whatever denomination, lies in his own conduct; and when this
falls short of that high standard in which he claims to deal, he
earns a contempt akin to that which overtakes the trader who
defrauds his creditors. It is remembered then, to his
disadvantage, that under his cassock the cleric is a man, and so
subject to all the faults that are man's heritage. But it happens
that in addition to these he is subject to other failings that
are peculiarly of the cassock, failings which the world has never
been slow to discern in him. The worst of these is the
ecclesiastical arrogance, the sacerdotal pride which has been
manifested by priests of all cults, but which in none is so
intolerable as in the Christian, who expounds a gospel of
humility and self-abnegation. He is akin to a feudal tyrant who
grinds the faces of his serfs whilst he lectures them upon the
glories of democracy.</p>
<p>Of such priests Spain of the fifteenth century had an abundant
share. She knew them and mistrusted them, and hence she
mistrusted any organization of theirs which should transcend the
strict limits of their office.</p>
<p>Now, the tribunal of the Inquisition laid itself peculiarly
open to this mistrust in consequence of the secrecy of its
proceedings&mdash;a secrecy, as we know, greatly increased by the
enactments of Torquemada. Its trials were not conducted in open
court; the examination of witnesses took place in secret and
under the veil of anonymity, so that the world had no assurance
of the honesty of the proceedings. When it happened that a man
was arrested, the world, as a rule, knew him no more until he
came forth, candle in hand, arrayed in a <i>sanbenito</i> to play
his tragic part in an Auto.</p>
<p>By virtue of this secrecy the Inquisition had invested itself
with a power far greater, more subtle, and farther-reaching than
that of any civil court. The might of the Grand Inquisitor was
almost boundless, and he was unanswerable to any temporal
authority for the arbitrariness with which he exercised it.
Rivalling the sovereign power in much, in much else the Grand
Inqjuisitor's went above and beyond it, for not even the King
himself could interfere in matters of the Faith with one who held
his office directly from the Pope.</p>
<p>The net which Torquemada cast was of the very widest; the
meshes of that net were of the closest, so that no man, however
humble, could account himself safe; its threads were of the
strongest, so that no man, however powerful, could be sure of
breaking through were he once brought within its scope.</p>
<p>What, then, but terror could Torquemada and his grim machinery
inspire? It is not difficult to believe the sometime secretary of
the Inquisition when he assures us that the Holy Office was not
favourably viewed in Spain. The marvel is that whilst the
Castilians were chilled by awe into inactivity and meek
submission, it should have remained for Aragon, which already had
known an inquisition for a century, to rise up in rebellion.</p>
<p>And yet what may seem at first glance a reason why Aragon
should have submitted to Torquemada's rule in matters of the
Faith, may be the very reason of its rash and futile rebellion.
For a hundred years already the court of the Holy Office had been
operating there; but its operations, never vigorous, had become
otiose. In this inactive form Aragon had suffered it to continue.
But of a sudden it was roused from that lethargy by Torquemada.
It was bidden to enforce its stern decrees and other sterner
decrees which he added to those already in existence, and to
follow the course of arbitrary procedure which he laid down.
Never welcome in Aragon, it now became intolerable. The
New-Christians, who knew the fate of their Castilian brethren,
went with fear in their countenances, and despair and its fierce
courage in their hearts.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1484 Ferdinand held his Cortes at Tarragona.
He was attended on the occasion by Torquemada, and he seized the
opportunity to present to his kingdom the gaunt Prior of Holy
Cross, its pontifically-appointed Grand Inquisitor.</p>
<p>Torquemada's activity matched his boundless zeal. At once he
convened a council composed of the ViceChancellor of Aragon,
Alonso de Caballeria&mdash;himself a New-Christian&mdash;the
Royal Councillor Alonso Carillo, and some doctors of canon law,
that they might decide upon the course to be adopted in Aragon to
the end that the Inquisition might be conducted with absolute
uniformity there, as in Castile. This done, he proceeded to
appoint inquisitors to the Archbishopric of Zaragoza, and his
choice fell upon Frey Caspar Yuglar and Frey Pedro Arbués de
Epila, Master of Theology and Canon of the Metropolitan Church of
Zaragoza.</p>
<p>After the publication of the "Instructions" drawn up that same
year in Seville, Torquemada further appointed to the Holy Office
of Zaragoza a fiscal advocate, an apparitor, notaries, and
receivers, whereupon that office began immediately to exercise
its functions under the new system.</p>
<p>At once the courage of despair roused the NewChristians to
opposition. Amongst them were many who held high positions at
court, persons of great influence and esteem, and these
immediately determined to send a deputation to the Vatican and
another to the Sovereigns to voice their protests against the
institution of this tribunal in Aragon, and to beseech that it be
abolished, or at least curtailed in its powers and inhibited from
proceeding to confiscation, which was contrary to the law of the
land.</p>
<p>This last was a shrewd request, based no doubt upon the
conviction that, deprived of the confiscations upon which it
battened, the tribunal must languish and very soon return to its
former inoperative condition.</p>
<p>Nor were the <i>converses</i> the only ones to denounce the
procedure of the Holy Office. Zurita records that many of the
principal nobles of Aragon rebelled against it, protesting that
it was against the liberties of the kingdom to confiscate the
property of men who were never allowed to learn the names of
those who bore witness against them.</p>
<p>As well might they have appealed against death&mdash;for death
itself was not more irresistible or inexorable than Torquemada.
All the fruit borne by their labours was that those who had lent
their names to the petition were ultimately prosecuted as
hinderers of the Holy Office. But this did not immediately
happen.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Torquemada's delegates, Arbués and Yuglar,
went about the business entrusted to them with that
imperturbability which the "Directorium" enjoins. They published
their edicts, ordered arrests, carried out confiscations, and
proceeded with such thoroughness that it was not long before
Zaragoza began to present the same lurid, ghastly spectacles that
were to be witnessed in the chief cities of Castile.</p>
<p>In the following May (1485) they celebrated with great
solemnity the first Auto de Fé, penancing many and burning some.
This was followed by a second Auto in June.</p>
<p>The despair and irritation of the New-Christians mounted
higher at these spectacles. It is believed to have reached its
climax with the sudden arrest of Leonardi Eli, one of the most
influential, wealthy, and respected <i>converses</i> of
Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Those who had put the petition afoot, abandoning now all hope
of obtaining any response either from the Sovereigns or from
Rome, met to concert other measures. Their leader was a man of
influence named Juan Pedro Sanchez. He had four brothers in
influential positions at Court, who had lent their services in
the matter of the petition to the Sovereigns.</p>
<p>A meeting took place in the house of one Luis de Santangel,
and Sanchez urged a desperate remedy for their desperate ills.
They must strike terror into their terrorizers. He proposed no
less than the slaughter of the inquisitors, urging with
confidence that if they were slain no others would dare to fill
their places. In this he seems to have underestimated the
character of Torquemada.</p>
<p>The proposal was adopted, an oath of secrecy was pledged,
plans were laid, measures were taken, and funds were collected to
enable these plans to be executed. Six assassins were chosen,
among whom were Juan de Abadia and his Gascon servant Vidal de
Uranso, and Juan de Esperandeu. This last was the son of a
<i>converso</i> then lying in the prisons of the Inquisition,
whose property had already been confiscated; so that he was
driven by the added spur of personal revenge. There was, too, the
further incentive of a sum of five hundred florins promised by
the conspirators to the slayer of Arbués, and deposited by them
for that purpose with Juan Pedro Sanchez.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," vol. i. p. 116.]</p>
<p>Several early attempts to execute this project were baffled by
circumstances. It would seem, moreover, that Arbués had received
some warning of what was in store for him&mdash;or else he was
simply conscious of the general hatred he had incurred&mdash;for
he exercised the greatest prudence, took to wearing body armour,
and was careful not to expose himself in any way; all of which
does not suggest in him that eagerness for the martyr's crown
with which his biographer Trasmiera would have us believe that he
was imbued.</p>
<p>At last, however, the assassins found their opportunity. Late
on the night of September 15 of that year, 1485, they penetrated
into the Metropolitan Church to lie in wait for their victims
when these should come to the midnight office imposed by the rule
of their order.</p>
<p>Juan de Abadia, with his Gascon servant Uranso and another,
entered by the main door. Esperandeu and his companions gained
admittance through the sacristy.</p>
<p>About the pillars of the vast church, in the gloom that was
scarcely relieved by the altar-lamp, they waited silently, "like
bloody wolves," says Trasmiera, "for the coming of that gentle
lamb."</p>
<p>Towards midnight there was a stir overhead; lights beat
faintly upon the darkness; the canons were assembling for matins
in the choir.</p>
<p>A note of the organ boomed through the silence, and then
Arbués entered the church from the cloisters.</p>
<p>It seemed that even now chance did not favour them, for Arbués
came alone, and their aim was to take both the inquisitors.</p>
<p>The dominican was on his way to join his brethren in the
choir. He carried a lantern in one hand and a long bludgeon in
the other. Nor did his precautions end in this. He wore a shirt
of mail under his white habit, and there was a steel lining to
his black velvet skull-cap. He must indeed have gone in fear,
that he could not trust himself to matins save armed at all
points.</p>
<p>He crossed the nave on his way to the staircase leading to the
choir. But as he reached the pulpit on the left he halted and
knelt to offer up the prescribed prayer in adoration of the
Sanctissimum Sacramentum. He set the lantern down upon the ground
beside him, and leant his club against a pillar.</p>
<p>Now was the assassins' opportunity. He was at their mercy. And
although to strike now was to leave half their task undone, they
must have resolved that rather than postpone the matter again in
the hope of slaying both inquisitors, they had better take the
one that was delivered up to them.</p>
<p>The chanting overhead muffled the sound of their steps as they
crept up behind Arbués, out of the blackness into the faint wheel
of yellow light cast by his lantern.</p>
<p>Esperandeu was the first to strike, and he struck clumsily,
doing no more than wound the inquisitor in the left arm. But
swift upon that blow followed another from Uranso&mdash;a blow so
violent that it smashed part of the steel cap, and, presumably
glancing off, opened a wound in the inquisitor's neck, which is
believed to have been the real cause of his death.</p>
<p>It did not, however, at that moment incapacitate him. He
staggered up, and turned to the staircase that led to the choir.
But now Esperandeu returned to the assault, and drove at the
Dominican so furiously with his sword that, despite the shirt of
mail with which Arbués was protected, the blade went through him
from side to side.</p>
<p>The inquisitor fell, and lay still. The organ ceased abruptly,
and the assassins fled.</p>
<p>There was confusion now in the choir. Down the stairs came the
friars with their lanterns, to discover the unconscious and
bleeding inquisitor. They took him up and carried him to bed. He
died forty-eight hours later at midnight on Saturday, September
17, 1485.*</p>

<p>By morning all the town had heard of the deed, and the effect
which it produced was very different from that for which its
perpetrators had hoped. The Old-Christians, some moved by
religious zeal, some by a sense of justice, snatched up weapons
and went forth to the cry of "To the fire with the
<i>converses</i>!"</p>
<p>The populace&mdash;an uncertain quantity, ever ready to be
swayed by the first voice that is loud enough, to follow the
first leader who points the way&mdash;took up the cry, and soon
Zaragoza was in turmoil. Through every street rang the clamours
of the multitude, which threatened to offer up one of those
hecatombs in which fire disputes with steel the horrid laurel of
the day.</p>
<p>The uproar penetrated to the Palace of Alfonso of Aragon, the
seventeen-year-old Archbishop of Zaragoza. It roused that bastard
of Catholic Ferdinand from his slumbers. A high-spirited lad, he
summoned the grandees of the city and the officers of justice,
and rode out at their head to meet and quell the rioters. But
only by a promise that the fullest justice should be done upon
the murderers did he succeed in dispersing them and restoring
order to that distracted city.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"Divine Justice," says Trasmiera, "permitted the deed, but not
its impunity."</p>
<p>Rash indeed had been the action of the New-Christians, and
terrible was the penalty exacted, terrible the price they were
made to pay for the life they had taken. In conceiving that they
could intimidate by such an act a man of Torquemada's mettle,
they displayed a lamentable want of judgment, as was speedily
proved. To fill the place of the dead inquisitor, and to set
about the stern business of avenging him, Torquemada instantly
dispatched to Zaragoza Fr. Juan Colvera, Fr. Pedro de Monterubio,
and Dr. Alonso de Alarcon. For the greater security of themselves
and their prisoners, these delegates set up their tribunal in the
royal alcazar of the Castle of Aljaferia, and proceeded to
institute an active search for the culprits. Several were seized,
amongst whom was Abadia's servant, Vidal de Uranso. He was put to
the question, and an admission of his own guilt extracted from
him. He was tortured further in the endeavour to wring from him
the names of his associates in the deed, and finally he was
promised "grace" if he would divulge them.</p>
<p>At this price the unfortunate Gascon consented to speak,
betraying all whom he had known to be in the plot and all whom he
had known to sympathize with it. And Llorente, who saw the
records of the proceedings, tells us that when Uranso claimed the
promised grace, he was benignly answered that he should receive
the grace of not having his hands hacked off&mdash;as must the
others&mdash;before being hanged, drawn, and quartered.</p>
<p>Amongst those taken were Juan de Abadia, Juan de Esperandeu,
and Luis de Santangel.</p>
<p>Esperandeu and Uranso suffered together at the Auto' of June
30, 1486&mdash;the seventh held in Zaragoza that year. Esperandeu
was dragged through the city on a hurdle, his hands were hacked
off on the steps of the Cathedral, whereafter he was hanged,
drawn, and quartered. Five other conspirators suffered in the
same Auto, being abandoned to the secular arm and burnt alive.
Two others, who had escaped, were burnt in effigy, and one of
these was that Juan Pedro Sanchez who had been the leading spirit
in the affair. And together with these living men and the
grotesque effigies of straw arrayed in <i>sanbenito</i> and
<i>coroza</i> they burnt the corpse of Juan de Abadia. He had
cheated in part the Justice of the Holy Office. He had committed
suicide in prison by eating a glass lamp.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," vol. i. p. 181.]</p>
<p>Autos succeeded one another at such a rate now in Zaragoza
that no less than fourteen were held in that year 1486; 42
persons were burnt alive, 14 in effigy, and 134 were penanced in
varying degrees from perpetual imprisonment to public whippings.
And to the end that the publicity of these Autos might be
increased and the salutary lesson inculcated by them might be as
far-reaching as possible, Torquemada ordered that a fortnight
before the holding of each it should be announced by public
proclamation, with great solemnity and parade of mounted
familiars of the Holy Office&mdash;a matter which upon this
precedent became customary throughout Spain.</p>
<p>In his allusion to these Autos Trasmiera* advances one of the
usual sophistries employed by the Inquisition to justify its
constant claim that its proceedings were dictated by mercy.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Vida de Arbués," p. 82.]</p>
<p>He assures us that it was a happiness (<i>dicha</i>) for the
culprits to die so soon, and he explains that to have allowed
them to live would have shown a greater rigour of justice&mdash;"
as witnesseth Cain, upon whom God placed a sign ordering that
none should kill him since by the prolongation of his life, his
nature being what it was, he must commit more sins, and thus more
surely deserve greater degrees of punishment in his eternal
damnation."</p>
<p>It is a priest who puts forward this blasphemous assertion
that God desires the damnation of a sinner, and suggests that by
burning that sinner betimes, God is to be cheated&mdash;at least
in part&mdash;of His unspeakable purpose. It serves excellently
to show to what desperate shifts of argument men could be urged
in the attempt to justify the practices of the Holy Office.</p>
<p>With precisely the same degree of authority does he assure us
that all the murderers died penitent&mdash;in consequence of the
affectionate prayers offered up for them by Arbués in the hour of
his death.</p>
<p>Vidal de Uranso's confession had yielded up to the inquisitors
the names not only of participators in the murder of Arbués, but
of those who were believed by the Gascon to be in sympathy with
the deed. By pursuing the methods peculiarly their own to cause a
prosecution to spread like an oil-stain, slowly and surely
covering an ever-widening area, the inquisitors were able to
cause the indictment of many whose connection with the crime was
of the remotest, and of others who, moved by a very Christian
pity, had afforded shelter to New-Christians fleeing in terror
before the blind vengeance of the Holy Office. Among the latter
many were prosecuted where there was no proof that the fugitives
they had sheltered were Judaizers or unfaithful. It is believed
that sheer panic had driven many perfectly innocent
New-Christians to depart from a city where no New-Christian might
account himself secure. But in consequence of the clause
introduced by the merciless Torquemada into his "Instructions," a
man's flight was in itself a sufficient reason for the
presumption of his guilt.</p>
<p>A reign of terror was established in Zaragoza. The tribunal of
that city became one of the busiest in Spain, and it is computed
that altogether some two hundred victims paid in one way and
another for the death of Pedro Arbués, so that there was hardly a
family, noble or simple, that was not plunged into mourning by
the Justice of the Faith.</p>
<p>Amongst those against whom proceedings were instituted were
men of the very first importance in the kingdom. One of these was
that Alonso de Caballeria, Vice-Chancellor of Aragon, who had
been prominent in the council summoned by Torquemada to determine
the details of the introduction of the Inquisition into Aragon.
Nor did they confine their attention to New-Christians. Amongst
those they summoned to render to the Holy Office an account of
their deeds we find no less a person than Don Jaime de Navarre,
known as the Infante of Navarre or the Infante of Tudela, the son
of the Queen of Navarre, and King Ferdinand's own nephew.</p>
<p>A fugitive New-Christian coming to Tudela cast himself upon
the mercy of the prince, and found shelter in Navarre for a few
days until he could escape into France. The inquisitors, whom
nothing escaped, had knowledge of this, and such was their might
and arrogance that they did not hesitate to arrest the Infante in
the capital of his mother's independent kingdom. They haled this
prince of the blood-royal to Zaragoza to stand his trial upon the
charge of hindering the Holy Office. They cast him into prison,
and subjected him to the humiliating penance of being whipped
round the Metropolitan Church by two priests in the presence of
his bastard cousin, the seventeen-year old Archbishop, Alfonso of
Aragon. Thereafter he was made to stand penitentially, candle in
hand, in view of all during High Mass, before he could earn
absolution of the ecclesiastical censure he had incurred.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Alonso de Caballeria is one of the few men in history who was
able successfully to defy and withstand the terrible power of
that sacerdotal court.</p>
<p>This Vice-Chancellor was a man of great ability, the son of a
wealthy baptized Hebrew nobleman. whose name had been Bonafos,
but who had changed this to Caballeria upon receiving baptism, in
accordance with the prevailing custom. He was arrested not only
upon the charge of having given shelter to fugitives, but also
upon suspicion of being, himself, a Judaizer.</p>
<p>Presuming upon his high position, and also upon the great
esteem in which he was held by his king, Caballeria showed the
Inquisition an intrepid countenance. He refused to recognize the
authority of the court and of Torquemada himself, appealing to
the Pope, and including in his appeal a strong complaint of the
conduct of the inquisitors.</p>
<p>.This appeal was of such a character and the man's own
position was so strong that on August 28, 1488, Innocent VIII
dispatched a brief inhibiting the inquisitors from proceeding
further against the Vice-Chancellor, and avocating to himself the
case. But such was Torquemada's arrogance by now that he was no
longer to be intimidated by papal briefs. Under his directions
the inquisitors of Zaragoza replied that the allegations
contained in Caballeria's appeal were false. The Pope, however,
was insistent, and he compelled the Holy Office to bow to his
will and supreme authority. On October 20 of that year the
minutes of the case were forwarded to the Vatican. As a result of
their perusal His Holiness must have absolved Caballeria, for not
only was he delivered of the peril in which he had stood, but he
continued to rise steadily in honour and consequence until he
became Chief Judge and head of the Hermandad of Aragon.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Memoria Historica," p. 112, and
"Historia Critica," vol. i, p. 205.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Llorente informs us* that he perused the records of some
thirty trials in connection with the Arbués affair, and that the
publication of any one of them would suffice to render the
Inquisition detested, were it not sufficiently detested already
in all civilized countries, including Spain.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Critica," vol. ii. cap. vi.]</p>
<p>He mentions, however, two cases of interest and Importance,*
to show how arbitrary was the spirit of the Inquisition, and how
far-reaching its arm.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Critica," vol. ii. cap. vi.]</p>
<p>Juan Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the affair, having fled to
Toulouse, was, as we have seen, sentenced as contumacious and
burnt in effigy pending the seizure of his person.</p>
<p>In Toulouse at this time there was a student named Antonio
Agustin, a member of an illustrious family of Aragon and a man
destined to rise to great dignity and honour. Under the impulse
of fanaticism, and acting in conjunction with several other
Spaniards in Toulouse, he petitioned for the arrest of Sanchez.
When this had been effected, he indited a letter to the
inquisitors of Aragon, and forwarded it to his brother Pedro in
Zaragoza for delivery.</p>
<p>Pedro, however, first discussed the matter with Guillerme
Sanchez, brother of the fugitive, and three friends, and all were
opposed to Agustin's purpose. They decided not to deliver the
letter, and they wrote to Agustin begging him to withdraw his
plea against Sanchez and consent to the fugitive's being restored
to liberty.</p>
<p>Agustin was persuaded, and replied informing his brother that
he had done as they had requested. Once Pedro Agustin in Zaragoza
was assured of this, he delivered the letters to the
inquisitors&mdash;though why he should have done so is not by any
means clear. Possibly he conceived that this was the wisest
course to pursue, lest it should afterwards transpire that he had
suppressed such a communication. But from what follows it will be
seen how ill-advised he was.</p>
<p>The Holy Office having received the letters, and supposing
Juan Pedro Sanchez still under arrest in Toulouse, ordered him to
be brought to Zaragoza. The courts of Toulouse replied that he
had alreadybeen released and that his whereabouts were now
unknown.</p>
<p>, The inquisitors inquired into the matter with that terrible
thoroughness of which they commanded the means. They controlled
the most wonderful police system that the world has ever seen. A
vast civilian army was enrolled in the service of the Holy
Office, as members of the tertiary order of St. Dominic. These
were the lay brothers of the family, and as the position
conferred upon those who held it certain signal benefits, of
which immunity from taxation was one,* it will be understood that
their number had to be limited, so very considerable were the
applications for enrolment.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Another advantage was that any member of
this confraternity was entitled to plead benefit of clergy, so
that no civil court could take proceedings against him.]</p>
<p>Originally this had been a penitential order, but very quickly
it came to be known as the Militia Christi, and its members as
familiars of the Holy Office&mdash;i.e. part of the family of St.
Dominic. They dressed in black, and wore the white cross of St.
Dominic upon their doublets and cloaks, and they were made to
join the Confraternity of St. Peter Martyr. The inquisitors
seldom went abroad without an escort of these armed
lay-brothers.</p>
<p>In the ranks of the Militia .Christi were to be found men of
all professions, dignities, and callings. They formed the secret
police of the Inquisition, they were the eyes and ears of the
Holy Office, ubiquitous in every stratum of social life.</p>
<p>Through these agents the inquisitors were not long in
ascertaining what had taken place in the matter of Juan Pedro
Sanchez, and soon the five friends were under arrest and forced
to answer the serious charge of hindering the Holy Office.</p>
<p>They were paraded in public in the Auto of May 6, 1487, as
suspects&mdash;<i>leviter</i>&mdash;of Judaizing; they were
penanced to stand in full view of the people, candle in hand and
wearing the <i>sanbenito</i>, during Mass, and they were
thereafter disqualified from holding any office or benefice or
pursuing any honourable profession during the good pleasure of
the inquisitors.</p>
<p>As it was, they escaped lightly. That they were suspected
<i>leviter</i> of Judaising ng, shows us how easily that
suspicion might be incurred. It was purely constructive in this
instance&mdash;an inference to be drawn from the fact that they
had befriended a Judaizer who was under sentence.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The other case is far more horrible. It shows in operation
Torquemada's decree regarding the children of heretics, and
reveals in the fullest measure its appalling inhumanity.</p>
<p>Another who had fled to Toulouse, fearing implication in the
affair of the murder of Arbués, was one Caspar de Santa Cruz. It
happened that he died there, after having been sentenced as
contumacious and burnt in effigy at Zaragoza. It came to the ears
of the inquisitors that he had been assisted in his flight by his
son; and not content with the heavy punishment of infamy that
must fall automatically upon that son for sins that were not his
own, not content with having reduced him to destitution by
confiscating his inheritance and by disqualifying him from
office, benefice, or honourable employment, they now seized his
person and indicted him for hindering.</p>
<p>Arrayed in a yellow <i>sanbenito</i>, this son, who had
discharged by his father the sacrosanct duty which nature and
humanity impose, was exhibited to scorn in an Auto, and further
penanced by being compelled tc come before the court of the Holy
Office and testify to his father's contumacious flight. Nor did
that ghoulish tribunal count itself satisfied even then. It was
further imposed upon him that he must repair to Toulouse, exhume
his father's remains, and publicly burn them, returning to
Zaragoza with a properly attested report of the performance, when
he should receive absolution of the censures incurred.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz carried out that barbarous command, as the only
means of saving his liberty and perhaps his life. For it is
certain that had he refused, it would have been argued that he
had rejected the offered means of reconciliation with the Church
he had so grievously offended, and he would have been prosecuted
as impenitent; whilst had he availed himself of the only
alternative and fled, he must have been sentenced as contumacious
and would have gone to the stake if he were ever taken.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>From the hour of his death Pedro Arbués de Epila was looked
upon as a saint and martyr, the notion being carefully fostered
by the members of his order in the minds of the faithful.</p>
<p>And, as is usual in such cases, miraculous manifestations of
his sanctity are alleged to have begun in the very hour of his
death. Trasmiera tells us that the bells rang of themselves when
he died, and he opines that this serves to approve their use in a
time when Luther and others were condemning them as vain.</p>
<p>The blood of the inquisitor, we learn from the same source,
boiled upon the stones of the church where it had fallen, and
continued to do so for a fortnight afterwards; whilst on any of
the twelve days immediately following the night of his murder, a
handkerchief pressed to the stones upon which his blood had been
shed, when removed, was found to be blood-stained.</p>
<p>These, says Trasmiera, were miracles of which all were
witnesses. There is much more of the same kind&mdash;including an
account of the inquisitor's apparitions after death, as testified
by Mosen Blanco, to whom the ghost appeared, and with whom it
conversed at length&mdash;to be found in Trasmiera's "Vida y
Muerte del Venerable Inquisidor, Pedro Arbués."</p>
<p>The sword with which he was slain was preserved in the
Metropolitan Church of Zaragoza, a relic sanctified by the blood
that had embrued it.</p>
<p>He was buried in the same church, and on the spot where he
fell Isabella raised a beautiful monument to his memory in 1487.
Part of its inscription ran: "Happy Zaragoza! Rejoice that here
is buried he who is the glory of the martyrs."</p>
<p>He was beatified two hundred years later by Alexander VII,
largely in consequence of the efforts of the Spanish inquisitors,
who perceived what an added prestige it would give their order if
one of its members were worshipped as a martyr. His canonization
followed in the nineteenth century. It was effected by Pope Pius
IX, and was the subject of much derisory comment in the Rome of
that day, which had just broken the shackles of clerical
government that had trammelled it for some fifteen hundred
years.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-15" name="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV. TORQUEMADA'S
FURTHER "INSTRUCTIONS"</h2>
<p>The intrepid but ineffectual resistance offered by Zaragoza to
the Inquisition was emulated by the principal cities of Aragon;
one and all protested against the institution of this tribunal
under the new form which Torquemada had given it.</p>
<p>But nowhere was resistance of the least avail against the iron
purpose of the Grand Inquisitor, armed with the entire force of
civil justice to constrain the people into submission to the
ecclesiastical will.</p>
<p>Teruel had been thrown into open revolt by the proposal to
appoint inquisitors there; and so fierce and determined was the
armed resistance, that not until the King's troops made their
appearance in the streets of that city, in March 1485, were order
and obedience restored.</p>
<p>In Valencia, too, there was a vigorous opposition led by the
nobles, and throughout Cataluna the resistance was so resolute
that it was not until two years later that the Sovereigns were
able to reduce the people to submission.</p>
<p>Barcelona urged an ancient right to appoint her own
inquisitors, and refused persistently and angrily to recognize
the authority of Torquemada or his delegates, in spite of any
bulls that might have been issued by Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII,
Nor was this city's obstinacy conquered until 1487, after Pope
Innocent had issued his second bull, confirming Torquemada in the
office of Grand Inquisitor of Castile, Leon, Aragon, and
Valencia, and further extending his jurisdiction so that it
included all the Spains&mdash;in which bull he formally cancelled
the ancient rights of Barcelona to appoint her own
inquisitors.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It should be sufficiently clear from this that,
notwithstanding the racial antipathy between Spaniard and Jew,
notwithstanding the religious spirit so very ardent in the people
of Spain, serving to aggravate beyond all reason that hatred of
the Israelite, the Inquisition&mdash;as Torquemada understood and
controlled it&mdash;was very far from being desired by them. That
this grim institution should have contrived so firmly to
establish itself upon Spanish soil and to wield there a power
such as it wielded in no other Catholic country of Europe, was
due entirely to the brothers of St. Dominic and the fanaticism of
Torquemada playing upon the bigotry and acquisitiveness of the
Sovereigns.</p>
<p>Assailants of the Roman Church have urged that the Inquisition
was a religious institution. Defenders of that same Church, in
their endeavour to shift so terrible a burden from her shoulders,
have sought to show that the Inquisition was a political machine.
It was neither, and at the same time it was both. But chiefly and
primarily it was just a clerical weapon. And clericalism in the
Iberian Peninsula, pervaded by the spirit of Torquemada,
converted that institution into an instrument far more dreadful
and oppressive than was its character in Italy, or France, or any
other Roman Catholic country of the world in which the Holy
Office held jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In Spain it had set up in the evening of the fifteenth century
an absolute reign of terror, depriving men of all liberty of
conscience and of speech and spreading a network of espionage
over the face of the land.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, practice having brought to light certain
shortcomings in the decrees which he had aheady issued,
Torquemada added a further eleven articles in 1485. In the main,
however, these are concerned with the internal affairs of the
Holy Office rather than with its attitude towards offenders.</p>
<p>Articles I and II provide for the payment of officers of the
Inquisition, and decree that no officer shall receive gifts of
any nature under pain of instant dismissal.</p>
<p>Article III disposes that the inquisitors shall keep a
permanent agent in Rome, who shall be skilled in the law, so that
he may attend to matters appertaining to the Holy Office.</p>
<p>From this it is to be inferred that appeals to the Vatican
continued to be numerous, notwithstanding the provisions made by
the Pope to constitute Torquemada the supreme arbiter in matters
of the Faith.</p>
<p>Articles V to XI are entirely concerned with details relating
to confiscations. These would be of no particular interest, but
that they serve to show how vast by now was the business of
confiscation, since the manner of conducting it and disposing of
confiscated property should demand so many decrees to govern
it.</p>
<p>Article IV is the only one that may be said to concern the
actual jurisprudence of the Holy Office. This is intended not so
much to soften the rigour as to remove the inconveniences that
might arise out of Article X of the "Instructions" of 1484.</p>
<p>By that article it was decreed that confiscation should be
retrospective&mdash;i.e. that a heretic's property should be
confiscate not from the day of the discovery of his heresy, but
from the date of the offence itself. So that any property that
might in the meantime have been alienated&mdash;whether in the
ordinary way of commerce or otherwise&mdash;must be considered as
the property of the Holy Office, and was to be seized by the Holy
Office, no matter into whose hands it might meanwhile have
passed.</p>
<p>Such a decree, as will be seen, was proving a serious
hindrance to trade; for it became unsafe to purchase anything
from any one, since should either party to the transaction
subsequently be discovered to have fallen into the sin of heresy
prior to ihat transaction, the other would be stripped of the
acquired property, and might be subjected to the entire loss.
Moreover, as proceedings were taken against the dead, and as
there was no limit imposed upon the retrospection allowed to
inquisitors, no man could account himself safe from confiscations
incurred through the sin of some other from whom he or his
forbears had acquired the property.</p>
<p>The vagueness of this article urgently demanded amending, and
this was the purpose of Article IV of the "Instructions" of 1485.
It decreed that all contracts concluded before 1479 should be
accounted valid, although it might come to be discovered against
either of the contracting parties that he was guilty of heresy at
the time of such contract.</p>
<p>This is the only instance in which we find Torquemada
promulgating a decree to soften the rigour of any previous
enactment, and it is very clear that it is a decree dictated not
by clemency but by expediency.</p>
<p>In the event of fraud, or of any one being a party to a fraud
to abuse the privilege conferred by this article, Torquemada
provided that the offender, if reconciled, should receive a
hundred lashes and be branded on the face with a hot iron;
whilst, if not reconciled&mdash;even though he should be a good
Catholic&mdash;he must suffer confiscation of all his
property.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Instrucciones hechas en 1485, etc.,"
in the "Copilacion de las Instrucciones."]</p>
<p>To justify the punishment of branding on the face, the case of
Cain is urged as a proper precedent, and so modern a historian as
Garcia Rodrigo does not hesitate to put this seriously
forward.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Verdadera," vol. iii. p.
165.]</p>
<p>Three years later&mdash;in 1488&mdash;Torquemada found it
necessary to add a further fifteen articles to his
"Instructions," and we may anticipate a little by briefly
surveying their provisions at this stage.</p>
<p>Complaints to Rome of the injustices and the excessive rigour
of the inquisitors&mdash;a constant feature of Torquemada's
Grand-Inquisitorship&mdash;had by that time become so numerous
that the Pope found it necessary to order Torquemada to re-edit
what Amador de los Rios very aptly terms his "Code of
Terror."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia de los Judios," vol. iii. p.
272.]</p>
<p>The chief ground of these complaints had concerned the delays
that so commonly occurred in bringing an accused to trial. When a
prisoner's acquittal ultimately chanced to take place, it was
after a long term of imprisonment for which there was no
compensation or redress; and when the person so treated was a man
of position and influence, it is natural that he would protest
strongly against the treatment to which he had been subjected
before it was discovered that no charge could be sustained
against him. The real reason of these delays must not be supposed
to lie in dilatoriness or sluggishness on the part of the
inquisitors. Indeed, the excessive dispatch with which they
conducted the affairs of their tribunal is a matter to the
scandal of which Llorente draws attention more than
once&mdash;and particularly in the course of chronicling the fact
that in the year of its introduction into Toledo this court
dealt&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;with no less than some 3,300
cases, 27 of the accused being burnt and the remainder penanced
in various degrees. He protests with reason that it is utterly
impossible that at such a rate of procedure evidence can properly
have been sifted and any sort of justice done.</p>
<p>Where delays took place they were the result of the extreme
reluctance on the part of the Holy Office to allow any to go free
upon whom its talons had once fastened. Thus, when even the
slight degree or evidence necessary to enable the inquisitors to
convict was lacking, they would delay in the daily hope that such
evidence might be forthcoming, and by repeated examinations they
would meanwhile seek to force the unfortunate prisoner into
contradictions that should justify them in resorting to
torture.</p>
<p>In view of the explicit pontifical command, Torquemada was
compelled to amend this state of things, at least in theory, by
decreeing (Article III) that there should be no delays in
proceeding to trial through lack of proof Where proof was
lacking, the accused should at once be restored to liberty, since
he could at any time&mdash;when fresh proof was
forthcoming&mdash;be rearrested.</p>
<p>Similarly, with a view of expediting trials, he ordered
(Article IV) that since in all the courts of the Inquisition
there were not the necessary lawyers, henceforth, when a case was
completed, the <i>dossier</i> of the proceedings should be sent
to the Grand Inquisitor himself, and he would then submit it to
the lawyers of the Suprema, who would advise upon it.</p>
<p>But he amply made up for what softening of rigour might be
contained in these articles by the greater severity enjoined in
some of the other decrees which he embodied in these
"Instructions" of 1488.</p>
<p>Finding that the inquisitors of Aragon had been departing from
certain of his enactments of 1484, diluting them with the weaker
rules that had obtained under the old Inquisition in that
kingdom, he commanded that all inquisitors should proceed in
strict obedience to the statutes contained in the past
"Instructions."</p>
<p>He provided (Article V) that the inquisitors should themselves
visit the prisons once in every fortnight, but that no outsiders
should be permitted to communicate with the prisoners, save of
course the priests who would go to comfort them. To the end that
a still greater secrecy should be observed in the trials, he
commanded (Article VI) that when the depositions of the witnesses
were being taken none should be present other than those who were
by law absolutely necessary; and he enjoined (Article VII) the
safe and secret custody of all documents relating to the cases
tried.</p>
<p>We are left to gather that the harshness of his enactment
concerning the children of heretics had been tempered a little by
a natural humane pity which did not at all commend itself to the
pitiless Grand Inquisitor; for we now find him (Article XI)
enjoining inquisitors to take care that the decree forbidding
those unfortunates the use of gold and silver and fine garments,
and disqualifying them from honourable employment, should be
rigorously enforced.</p>
<p>He provided (Article XIII) that all the expenses of the Holy
Office&mdash;which must have been enormous by now, considering to
what vast proportions he had developed that
organization&mdash;should be defrayed out of confiscated property
before this was surrendered to the Royal treasury; and further
(Article XV), that all appointed notaries, fiscals, and
constables should discharge their functions in person and not by
deputy.</p>
<p>The most interesting of these statutes of 1488, in consequence
of the information it conveys on the subject of the activities of
the Inquisition and the enormous scale of the prosecutions upon
which it was engaged, is contained in Article XIV. The prisons of
Spain were becoming so crowded, and the expense of maintaining
the prisoners was imposing so heavy a tax upon the Holy Office,
that it had become urgently necessary to make some fresh
provision that would relieve this burden. Therefore, as this
article sets forth, Torquemada enjoined the Sovereigns to order
the building in every district of the Inquisition of a
quadrangular enclosure of small houses (casillas) for the
residence of those sentenced to the penance of imprisonment.
These houses were to be so contrived that the penitents might
pursue in them their business or trade and earn their own
livelihood, thus relieving the Inquisition of the heavy expense
of supporting them. Each of these quadrangular
penitentiaries&mdash;for this is the origin of the term&mdash;was
to be equipped with its own chapel.*</p>

<h2><a id="ch-16" name="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. THE INQUISITION
IN TOLEDO</h2>
<p>Llorente, the historian of the Spanish Inquisition, and M.
Fidel Fita, the distinguished contributor to the "Boletin de la
Real Academia de la Historia," both had access to and both made
use of a record left by the licentiate Sebastian de Orozco, an
eyewitness of the establishment of the Inquisition in Toledo.
This has been printed verbatim by M. Fidel Fita.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin de la Real Academia," xi p. 296
et seq., which see, and also Llorente, "Anales," ii. 110 et
seq.]</p>
<p>The details afforded by Orozco are so circumstantial that it
is worth while to follow them closely, since they may be said to
afford a typical picture of what was happening not only in the
city with which they are concerned, but throughout the whole of
Spain.</p>
<p>It was in May of the year 1485 that the Inquisition was first
set up in Toledo, that noble city erected upon a rock that rises
sheer from the swirling waters of the Tagus, and is crowned by
the royal palace which still bears the Moorish name of Alcazar.
It was transferred thither, by Torquemada's orders, from Villa
Real, where it had been operating for some months.</p>
<p>"To the end that our Infinite Redeemer Jesus Christ be praised
in all that He does, and for the greater power of His Holy
Catholic Faith," writes Orozco, "know all who shall come after us
that in the year 1485, in the month of May, the Holy Inquisition
against heretical pravity was sent to this very noble City of
Toledo by our very enlightened Sovereigns, Don Fernando and Donna
Isabella...Of this Inquisition were administrators Vasco Ramirez
de Ribera, Archdeacon of Talavera, and Pedro Dias de la Costana,
Licentiate of Theology, and with them one of the Queen's
Chaplains as fiscal and prosecutor, and one Juan de Alfaro, a
patrician of Seville, as chief constable (alguazil), and two
notaries."</p>
<p>The licentiate Pedro Dias de la Costana preached to the people
on the third day of Pentecost (Tuesday, May 24), notifying them
of the papal bull under which the inquisitors were acting and of
the power vested in these inquisitors to deal with matters of
heresy; pronouncing greater excommunication against any who by
word or deed or counsel should dare to oppose the Inquisition in
the execution of its duty.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his announcement the Gospels and a
crucifix were brought, and upon these all were required to make
solemn oath of their desire to serve God and the Sovereigns, to
uphold the Catholic Faith, and to defend and shelter the
administrators of the Holy Inqi sition.</p>
<p>Lastly the licentiate published the usual edict of grace for
self-delators. He summons all Judaizers to return to the Faith
and become reconciled to the Church within a term of forty days,
as set forth by the edict itself which by his orders was nailed
to the door of the Cathedral.</p>
<p>A week elapsed without any response to this summons. The
<i>conversos</i> of Toledo had been preparing to resist the
introduction of the Inquisition to their city, and under the
guidance of one De la Torre and some others they had already
matured their plans and laid down the lines which this resistance
was to take.</p>
<p>The plot was&mdash;according to Orozco, who, you will have
gathered, was an ardent partisan of the Holy Office&mdash;that on
the feast of Corpus Christi, which fell that year on June 2, the
conspirators should be armed to lie in wait for the procession,
falling upon it as it was advancing through the streets, and
slaying the inquisitors and their defenders. That done, they were
to seize the gates of the city and hold Toledo against the
King.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center">THE AUTO DE FÉ<br>
From Limborch's "Historia Inquisitionis."</p>
<p>The fine strategic position of the city might have lent itself
to so daring a scheme, and presumably the aim of the
New-Christians would have been to hold it rebelliously until
accorded terms of capitulation that should guarantee the immunity
of the rebels from all punishment, and the immunity of Toledo
itself from the jurisdiction of the Holy Office. But, on the
whole, it was so very crack-brained a conspiracy that we are more
than justified in doubting whether it ever had any real
existence.</p>
<p>"It pleased our Redeemer," says Orozco, "that this conspiracy
was discovered on the eve of Corpus Christi." He does not satisfy
our curiosity as to how the discovery was made, and the omission
increases our doubts.</p>
<p>The details, we are told, were derived from several of the
plotters who were arrested on that day by the Corregidor of
Toledo, Gomes Manrique. In view of the information thus obtained,
Manrique proceeded to capture De la Torre and four of his
friends, One of these captives, a cobbler named Lope Maurigo, the
Corregidor hanged out of hand on the morning of the festival,
before the procession had issued from the Cathedral. The act may
have been intended as a deterrent to any who still entertained
the notion of putting the plot into execution.</p>
<p>The procession passed off without any disturbances; and having
hanged another of his prisoners Manrique subjected the remainder
to heavy fines, whereby they escaped far more lightly than if
they had been tried by the court of the Holy Office. Fortunately
for themselves, it was deemed that their offence was one that
came within the jurisdiction of the secular courts.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, possibly because they now realized that they
had nothing left to hope for, self-delators began to come before
the inquisitors to solicit reconciliation.</p>
<p>But when the term of the edict had expired, it was found that
the indefatigable Torquemada had prepared a second one to
supplement it. He ordered the publication of an entirely fresh
measure, commanding that all who knew of any heretics, apostates,
or Judaizers, must, under pain of excommunication and of being
deemed heretics themselves, divulge to the inquisitors the names
of such offenders within a term of sixty days.</p>
<p>There was already in existence an enactment of the
Inquisition, which instead of offering, as in all times has been
done by secular tribunals, a reward for the apprehension of
fugitives from justice, imposed upon those who neglected
spontaneously to set about that catchpoll work when the occasion
arose, a fine of 500 ducats in addition to excommunicating them.
But Torquemada's fresh measure went even beyond that. Nor did it
end with the edict we have mentioned. When the sixty days
expired, he ordered the prolongation of the term by another
thirty days&mdash;not only in Toledo, but also in Seville, where
he had commanded the publication of the same edict&mdash;and now
came the cruellest measure of all. He commanded the inquisitors
to summon the Rabbis of the synagogues and to compel them to
swear according to the Mosaic Law that they would denounce to the
inquisitors any baptized Jew whom they found returning to the
Jewish cult, and he made it a capital offence for any Rabbi to
keep such a matter secret.</p>
<p>Not even now did he consider that he had carried far enough
this infamous measure of persecution. He ordained that the Rabbis
should publish in their synagogues an edict of excommunication by
the Mosaic Law against all Jews who should fail to give
information to the inquisitors of any Judaizing whereof they
might have knowledge.</p>
<p>In this decree we catch a glimpse of the intensity of the
fanatical, contemptuous hatred in which Torquemada held the
Israelites. For nothing short of blended hatred and contempt
could have inspired him so to trample upon the feelings of their
priests, and to compel them under pain of death to a course in
which they must immolate their self-respect, violate their
consciences, and render themselves odious in the esteem of every
right-thinking Jew.</p>
<p>By this unspeakable enactment the very Jews themselves were
pressed into the secret service of the Inquisition, and compelled
by the fear of spiritual and physical consequences to turn
informers against their brethren.</p>
<p>"Many," says Orozco, who no doubt considered it a measure as
laudable as it was fiendishly astute, "were the men and women who
came to bear witness."</p>
<p>Arrests commenced at once, and were carried on with an
unprecedented activity revealed by the records of the Autos that
were held, which Orozco has preserved for us.</p>
<p>And already fire had been set to the faggots piled at the
stake of Toledo, for the first victims had soon fallen into the
eager hands of the Inquisitors of the Faith.</p>
<p>These were three men and their three wives, natives of Villa
Real, who had fled thence when first the inquisitors had set up
their tribunal there. They reached Valencia safely, purchased
there a yawl, equipped it, and set sail. They were on the seas
for five days, when, of course, "it pleased God to send a
contrary wind, which blew them back into the port from which they
had set out"&mdash;and thus into the hands of the benign
inquisitors, so solicitous for the salvation of their souls. They
were arrested upon landing, and brought to Toledo, whither the
tribunal had meanwhile been transferred. They were tried; their
flight confirmed their guilt; and so&mdash;<i>Christi nomine
invocato</i>&mdash;they were burnt by order of the
inquisitors.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>As a result of the self-delations the first great Auto de Fé
was held in Toledo on the first Sunday in Lent (February 12),
1486. The reconciled of seven parishes, numbering some 750 men
and women, were taken in procession and submitted to the penance
known as <i>verguenza</i>&mdash;or "shame"&mdash;which, however
humiliating to the Christian, was so hurtful to the pride of the
Jew (and no less to that of the Moor) that he would almost have
preferred death itself. It consisted in being paraded through the
streets, men and women alike, bareheaded, barefooted, and naked
to the waist.</p>
<p>At the head of the procession, preceded by the white cross,
and walking two by two, went a section of the Confraternity of
St. Peter the Martyr&mdash;the familiars of the Holy
Office&mdash;dressed in black, with the white cross of St.
Dominic displayed upon their cloaks. After them followed the
horde of half-naked penitents, cruel physical discomfort being
added to their mental torture, for the weather was so raw and
cold that it had been considered expedient to provide them with
sandals, lest they should have found it impossible to walk.</p>
<p>In his hand each carried a candle of green
wax&mdash;unlighted, to signify that as yet the light of the
Faith did not illumine his soul. Anon, when they should have been
admitted to reconciliation and absolution, these candles would be
lighted, to signify that the light of the Faith had once more
entered their hearts&mdash;light being the symbol of the Faith,
just as "light" and "faith" have become almost convertible
terms.</p>
<p>Orozco informs us that among the penitents were many of the
principal citizens of Toledo, many persons of eminence and
honour, who must deeply have felt their shame at being paraded in
this fashion through crowded streets, that they might afford a
salutary spectacle to the multitude which had assembled in Toledo
from all the surrounding country districts. To ensure this good
attendance the Auto had been proclaimed far and wide a fortnight
before it was held.</p>
<p>The chronicler of these events tells us that many and loud
were the lamentations of these unfortunates. But it is very plain
that their condition did not move his pity, for he expresses the
opinion that their grief was rather at the dishonour they were
suffering than&mdash;as it should have been&mdash;because they
had offended God.</p>
<p>The procession wound its way through the principal streets of
the city, and came at last to the Cathedral. At the main doors
stood two chaplains, who with their thumbs made the sign of the
cross on the brow of each penitent in turn, accompanying the
action by the formula: "Receive the Sign of the Cross which you
denied, and which, being deluded, you lost."</p>
<p>Within the Cathedral two large scaffolds had been erected. The
penitents were led to one of these, where the reverend
inquisitors waited to receive them. On the other an altar had
been raised, surmounted by the green cross of the Inquisition,
and as soon as all the penitents were assembled, the crowd of
holiday-makers being closely packed about the scaffolds. Mass was
celebrated and a sermon of the Faith was preached.</p>
<p>This being at an end, the notary of the Holy Office rose and
called over the long roll of the penitents, each answering to his
name and hearing his particular offence read out to him.
Thereafter the penance was announced. They were to be whipped in
procession on each of the following six Fridays, being naked to
the waist, bareheaded and barefooted; they were to fast on each
of those six Fridays, and they were disqualified for the rest of
their lives from holding office, benefice, or honourable
employment, and from using gold, silver, precious stones, or fine
fabrics in their apparel.</p>
<p>They were warned that if they relapsed into error, or failed
to perform any part of the penance imposed, they would be deemed
impenitent heretics and abandoned to the secular arm; and upon
that grim warning they were dismissed.</p>
<p>On each of the following six Fridays of Lent they were taken
in procession from the Church of San Pedro Martir to a different
shrine on each occasion, and when at last they had completed this
humiliating penance it was further ordained that they should give
"alms" to the extent of one-fifth of the value of their property,
to be applied to the holy war against the infidels of
Granada.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Scarcely are the penitents of this Auto disposed of&mdash;the
last procession took place on March 23&mdash;than the second Auto
was held.</p>
<p>This occurred on the second Sunday in April, and 486 men and
women were penanced on this occasion, the procedure and the
penance imposed being the same.</p>
<p>At Whitsuntide of that year a sermon of the Faith was preached
by the inquisitor Costana, whereafter an edict was publicly read
and nailed to the Cathedral door, summoning all who had fled to
surrender themselves to the Holy Office within ninety days, under
pain of being sentenced as contumaciously absent. Among those
cited there were, we learn, several clerics, including three
Jeronymite friars.</p>
<p>Finally, on the second Sunday in June&mdash;the nth of that
month&mdash;we have the last Auto within the period of grace. In
this the penitents of four parishes, numbering some 750 persons,
were conducted to reconciliation under precisely the same
conditions as had already been observed in the two previous
Autos.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-17" name="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. AUTOS DE FÉ</h2>
<p>The Inquisition of Toledo had now to deal with heretics who
must be considered impenitent, since they had not availed
themselves of the benign leniency of the Church and spontaneously
sought the reconciliation offered. From this moment the
proceedings assume a far more sinister character.</p>
<p>The first Auto under these altered conditions was held on
August 16, 1486. Among the accused brought up for sentence were
twenty men and five women, whose offences doomed them to be
abandoned to the secular arm, and one of these was no less a
personage than the Regidor&mdash;'Or Governor&mdash;of Toledo, a
Knight-Commander of the Order of Santiago.</p>
<p>They were brought forth from the prison of the Inquisition at
a little before six o'clock on that summer morning, arrayed in
the yellow <i>sanbenito</i> and <i>coroza</i>. Each
<i>sanbenito</i> bore an inscription announcing the name of the
wearer and the nature of his offences against the Faith, and they
were smeared in addition with grotesque red images of dragons and
devils. A rope was round the neck of each prisoner, and his hands
were pinioned with the other end of it. In his hands, thus bound,
he carried the unlighted candle of green wax.</p>
<p>Thus they were led in procession through the streets, the
procession being headed as usual by a posse of familiars of the
Confraternity of St. Peter the Martyr&mdash;the Soldiers of the
Faith&mdash;and preceded now by the green cross of the
Inquisition, which was shrouded in a mourning veil of black
crape.</p>
<p>The green cross did not merely symbolize, by its colour,
constancy and eternity, but it was fashioned as if of freshly-cut
boughs, to represent living wood, the emblem of the true faith in
contradistinction to the withered branches that are to be flung
into the fire.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Quia si in virido ligno haec faciunt, in
arido quid fiet?" (Luke xxiii. 31). See Garcia Rodrigo, "Hist.
Verdadera," i. p. 373.]</p>
<p>Following the Soldiers of the Faith, under a canopy of scarlet
and gold, borne by four acolytes and preceded by a bell-ringer,
came the priest who was to celebrate the Mass, in the crimson
chasuble prescribed by the liturgy for these dread solemnities.
He bore the Host, and as he advanced the multitude sank down upon
their knees, beating their breasts to the clang of the bell.</p>
<p>Behind the canopy walked another posse of familiars, and after
these again followed the doomed prisoners, each attended by two
Dominican brothers in their white cassocks and black cloaks,
fervently exhorting those who had not yet confessed to do so even
at this late hour.</p>
<p>The constables of the Holy Office and the men-atarms of the
secular authorities flanked this section of the procession,
shouldering their glittering halberts.</p>
<p>They were closely followed by a group of men who bore aloft,
swinging from long green poles, the effigies of those who were to
be sentenced as contumaciously absent&mdash;horribly grotesque
mannequins of straw with painted faces and bituminous eyes,
tricked out in the <i>sanbenitos</i> and <i>corozas</i> that
should have adorned the originals had not these remained
fortunately at large.</p>
<p>Next, mounted upon mules in trailing funereal trappings, rode
the reverend inquisitors, attended by a group of mounted
gentlemen in black, the white cross upon their breasts announcing
them as familiars of the Holy Office, the officers of the
tribunal.</p>
<p>They were immediately preceded by the banner of the
Inquisition, displaying in an oval medallion upon a sable ground
the green cross between an olive-branch (dexter) and a naked
sword (sinister). The olive-branch, emblem of peace, symbolized
the readiness of the Inquisition to deal mercifully with those
who by true repentance and confession were disposed to reconcile
themselves with Holy Mother Church. The mercy of which so much
parade was made might consist, as we know, of strangulation
before burning, or, at best, of perpetual imprisonment, the
confiscation of property, and infamy extending to the children
and grandchildren of the condemned.</p>
<p>The sword, on the other hand, announced the alternative.
Garcia Rodrigo says that it proclaimed the Inquisition's
tardiness to smite. If so, it is a curious symbol to have chosen
for such a purpose; but in any case the tardiness is hardly
perceptible to the lay vision.</p>
<p>The procession was closed by the secular justiciary and his
<i>alguaziles</i>.</p>
<p>In this order that grim cortege advanced to the Cathedral
Square. Here two great scaffolds were draped in black for the
ceremony&mdash;blasphemously called an Act of Faith.</p>
<p>The prisoners were conducted to one of these scaffolds and
accommodated upon the benches that rose from it in tiers, the
highest being always reserved for those who were to be abandoned
to the secular arm&mdash;to the end, we suppose, that they should
be fully in the view of the multitude below. Each of the accused
sat between two Dominican friars. The poles bearing the effigies
were placed so that they flanked the benches.</p>
<p>On the other scaffold, on which an altar had been raised and
chairs set for the inquisitors, these now made their appearance,
accompanied by the notaries and fiscal and attended by their
familiars.</p>
<p>The shrouded green cross was placed upon the altar, the tapers
were lighted, the thurible kindled, and as a cloud of incense
ascended and spread its sweetly pungent odour the Mass began.</p>
<p>At the conclusion a sermon of the Faith was preached, wherein
the sins of the accused were denounced, and those who had
incurred the penalty of being abandoned to the secular arm were
exhorted fervently to repent and make their peace with Holy
Mother Church that they might save their souls from the damnation
into which, otherwise, it was the Inquisition's business to hurry
them.</p>
<p>As the preacher ceased, the notaries of the Holy Office of
Toledo proceeded to the business of reading out the crime of each
accused, dwelling in detail upon the particular form which his
Judaizing was known to have taken. As the name of each was
called, he was brought forward, and placed upon a stool,* whilst
the reading of the lengthy sentence took place.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Later on a cage was substituted for the
stool.]</p>
<p>It requires no great imaginative effort to form a mental
picture of these proceedings, and of the poor livid wretch,
horror-stricken and bathed in the sweat of abject terror which
that long-drawn agony must have extorted from the stoutest,
sitting there, perhaps half-dazed already by the merciful hand of
Nature, in the glaring August sun, under the stare of a thousand
eyes, some pitiful, some hateful, some greedy of the offered
spectacle. Or it might be some poor halfswooning woman, steadied
by the attendant Dominicans, who seek to support her fainting
courage, to mitigate her unutterable anguish with comfortless
words that hold out the promise of pitiless mercy.</p>
<p>And all this, <i>Christi nomine invocato!</i></p>
<p>The reading of the sentence is at an end. It concludes with
the formula that the Church, being unable to do more for the
offender, casts him out and abandons him to the secular arm.
Lastly comes the mockery of that intercession,
<i>efficaciter</i>&mdash;to preserve the inquisitors from
irregularity&mdash;that the secular justice shall so deal with
him that his blood may not be shed, and that he may suffer no
hurt in life or limb.</p>
<p>Thereupon the doomed wretch is removed from the scaffold; the
<i>alguaziles</i> of the secular justiciary seize him; the
Regidor mutters a few brief words of sentence, and he is thrust
upon an ass and hurried away, out of the city to the
burning-place of La Dehesa.</p>
<p>A white cross has been raised in this field, where twenty-five
stakes are planted with the faggots piled under each, and a mob
of morbid sightseers surges, impatient to have the spectacle
begin.</p>
<p>The condemned is bound to the stake, and the Dominicans still
continue their exhortations. They flaunt a crucifix before his
dazed, staring eyes, and they call upon him to repent, confess,
and save his soul from Eternal Hell. They do not leave him until
the fire is crackling and the first cruel little tongues of
bluish flame dart up through the faggots to lick the soles of his
naked feet.</p>
<p>If he has confessed, wrought upon by spiritual or physical
terror, the Dominican makes a sign, and the executioner steps
behind the stake and rapidly strangles the doomed man. If his
physical fears have not sufficed to conquer his religious
convictions, if he remains firm in his purpose to die
lingeringly, horribly, a martyr for the faith that he believes to
be the only true one, the Dominican withdraws at last, baffled by
this "wicked stubbornness," and the wretch is left to endure the
terrible agony of death by slow fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under that limpid sky&mdash;<i>Christi nomine
invocato</i>&mdash;the ferocious work of the Faith goes on;
accused succeeds accused to hear his or her sentence read, until
the last of the twenty-five victims has been surrendered to the
tireless arm of the secular justice. In the meadows of La Dehesa
there is such a blaze of the fires of the Faith, that it might
almost seem that the Christians have been avenging upon their
enemies those human torches which an enemy of Christianity is
alleged to have lighted once in Rome.</p>
<p>Six mortal hours, Orozco informs us, were consumed in that
ghastly business,* for the Court of the Holy Office must in all
things proceed with stately and pompous leisureliness, with that
calm equanimity enjoined by the
"Directorium"&mdash;<i>simpliciter et de piano</i>&mdash;lest by
haste it should fall into the unpardonable offence of
irregularity.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Boletin," xi. p. 310 et seq.]</p>
<p>Not until noon did the proceedings conclude with the hurrying
away to La Dehesa of the last of those twenty-five.</p>
<p>The inquisitors and their followers descended at length from
their scaffold, and withdrew to the Casa Santa to rest them from
these arduous labours of propagating Christianity.</p>
<p>There was more to be done upon the morrow&mdash;very important
business, demanding an entirely different ceremonial, wherefore
it had been set apart and allotted a day to itself</p>
<p>The accused on this occasion were only two, but they were two
clerics. One was the parish priest of Talavera; the other
occupied the distinguished position of a royal chaplain. Both had
been found guilty of Judaizing. They were conducted to the Auto
in full canonicals, as if about to celebrate Mass, each carrying
his veiled chalice. Led to the scaffold of the condemned, they
found themselves confronted from the other scaffold not only by
the inquisitors and their attendants and familiars, but further
by the Bishop, who was attended by two Jeronymites&mdash;the
Abbot of the Convent of St. Bernard and the Prior of the Convent
of Sisla.</p>
<p>The notary of the Holy Office read out the crimes of the
accused, and pronounced them cast out from the Church. Thereupon
each was brought in turn before the Bishop, who proceeded to
degrade him, since the law could not without sacrilege lay
violent hands upon an ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>Beginning by depriving each of his chalice, the Bishop passed
on to divest the priestly offender of his chasuble; stole,
maniple, and alb were removed in succession, the Bishop
pronouncing the prescribed formula for each stage of the
degradation, and defacing the tonsure by clipping away a portion
of the surrounding fringe of hair.</p>
<p>At last the doomed clerics stood stripped of all insignia of
their office. And now the <i>sanbenito</i>&mdash;that chasuble of
infamy&mdash;was flung upon the shoulders of each; their heads
were crowned with the tragically grotesque <i>coroza</i>, a rope
was put about each neck, and their hands were pinioned. The
sentence was fulfilled at last by their being abandoned to the
secular authorities, who seized them and bore them away to the
stake.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>On Sunday, October 16, a proclamation was read in the
Cathedral, pronouncing several deceased persons to have been
heretics, and setting forth that, although dead themselves, their
reputations lived as those of Christians. Therefore it became
necessary to publish their heresy, and their heirs were summoned
to appear within twenty days and render to the inquisitors an
account of their inheritances, from the enjoyment of which they
were disqualified, since all property that had belonged to the
deceased was, by virtue of Torquemada's decree, confiscate to the
royal treasury.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>On December 10 900 persons were admitted to public
reconciliation. They were self-delators from remote country
districts who had responded to a recent edict of grace published
in those districts.</p>
<p>The notary announced the forms of Judaizing of which each had
been guilty and proclaimed it as their intention henceforth to
live and die in the faith of Christ. He then read out the
Articles of Faith, and they were required to say "I believe"
after each, and lastly to make oath upon the Gospels and the
crucifix never again to fall into the error of Judaism, to
denounce any whom they knew to be Judaizers, and ever to favour
and uphold the Holy Inquisition and the Holy Catholic faith.</p>
<p>The penance imposed was that they should be scourged in
procession for seven Fridays, and thereafter on the first Friday
of every month for a year. This in their own districts. In
addition, they were required to come to Toledo and be scourged in
procession on the Feast of St. Mary of August and on the Thursday
of Holy Week. Two hundred of them were further ordered to wear a
<i>sanbenito</i> over their ordinary garments for a year from
that date, and never to appear in public without it under pain of
being deemed impenitent and punished as relapsed.</p>
<p>Another 700 came to be reconciled on January 15, 1487, and yet
another 1,200 on March 10. These last, Orozco says, were from the
districts of Talavera, Madrid, and Guadalajara; and he adds that
some amongst them were penanced to the extent of being condemned
to wear the <i>sanbenito</i> for the remainder of their
lives.</p>
<p>In the Auto of May 7 fourteen men and nine women were burnt.
Amongst the former was a Canon of Toledo who was accused of
horrible heresies, and who, writes Orozco, had confessed under
torture to abominable subversions of thewords of the Mass.
Instead of the prescribed formula of the consecration, he had
stated that he was in the habit of uttering the absurd and almost
meaningless gibberish&mdash;" Sus Periquete, que mira la
gente."</p>
<p>On the following day there was held a supplementary Auto,
especially for the purpose of dealing with deceased and fugitive
heretics, conducted with a ceremony of an unusual and singularly
theatrical order, which is not so much typical&mdash;as are the
other Autos described&mdash;of what was taking place throughout
Spain, as indicative of a morbid inventiveness on the part of the
Toledan inquisitors.</p>
<p>On the scaffold usually occupied by the accused a sepulchral
monument of wood had been erected and draped in black. As each
accused was cited by the notary, the familiars opened the
monument and drew out the effigy of the dead man dressed in the
graveclothes peculiar to the Jews.</p>
<p>To this dummy of straw the detailed account of his crimes and
the sentence of the court whereby he was condemned as a heretic
were solemnly read out. When all the condemnations had thus been
proclaimed, the effigies were flung into a bonfire that had been
kindled in the square; and together with the effigies went the
bones of the deceased, which had been exhumed to that end.</p>
<p>After that the next Auto of importance was held on July 25,
1488, when twenty men and seventeen women were sent to the stake,
with a supplementary Auto upon the morrow in which they burnt the
effigies of over a hundred dead and fugitive heretics.</p>
<p>And so it goes on, as recorded by the licentiate Sebastian
Orozco, and cited by Llorente* and Fidel Fita.* From now onwards
the burnings increase in number. Indeed, all edicts of grace
having expired, and no new ones being permissible, sentencing to
the flames&mdash;through the medium of the secular arm&mdash;and
to perpetual imprisonment becomes the chief business of the
Inquisition in Toledo and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Anales" under the dates given.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** "Boletin de la Academia, etc.," vol. xi.

<p>The <i>sanbenito</i>s of the burnt were preserved in the
churches of the parishes where they had lived. They were hung in
these churches as banners won in battle are hung&mdash;trophies
of victory over heresy.</p>

<h2><a id="ch-18" name="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. TORQUEMADA AND
THE JEWS</h2>
<p>During that first year of the Inquisition's establishment in
Toledo, twenty-seven persons there convicted of Judaizing were
burnt and 3,300 were penanced. And what was taking place in
Toledo was taking place in every other important city in
Spain.</p>
<p>Numerous now and vehement were the protests against the
terrible and excessive rigour of Torquemada. Already, upon the
death of Pope Sixtus IV, a vigorous attempt had been made by some
Spaniards of eminence to procure the deposition of the Prior of
Holy Cross from the office of Grand Inquisitor. It was argued
that as his appointment had been made by Sixtus, so it was
automatically determined by that Pope's decease. But whatever
hopes may have been founded upon such an argument were very
quickly overthrown. Innocent VIII, as we have already seen, not
only confirmed Torquemada in his office, but considerably
increased his powers and the scope of his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Indeed, not only was he given jurisdiction over all the
Spains, but Innocent's bull of April 3, 1847, <i>motu
proprio</i>, commanded all Catholic princes that, upon being
requested by the Grand Inquisitor so to do, they should arrest
any fugitives he might indicate and send them captive to the
Inquisition under pain of excommunication.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lumbreras, quoted by Llorente, "Anales,"
i. p. 132. The bull is quoted in full by M. Fidel Fita,
"Boletin," xvi. p. 315.]</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>Torquemada and the Jews 257</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the threat by which it was backed, this
command from the Vatican appears to have been generally
disregarded by the Governments of Europe.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Historia Critica," tom, ii, p.
118.]</p>
<p>That such a bull should have been solicited gives us yet
another glimpse of the terrible rancour against the Jews which
fanaticism had kindled in the soul of Torquemada. Had his aim
been merely, as expressed, to weed the tares of heresy from the
Catholic soil of Spain, the self-imposed exile of those wretched
fugitives would fully have satisfied him, and he would not have
thought it necessary to hound them out of such shelter as they
had found abroad that he might have the satisfaction of hurling
them into the bonfire he had kindled.</p>
<p>His position being so greatly strengthened by the wider and
ampler powers accorded to him by the new Pontiff, Torquemada gave
a still freer rein to the terrible severity of his nature, and
thus occasioned those frequent and very urgent appeals to the
Vatican.</p>
<p>Many New-Christians who secretly practised Jewish rites, being
repelled from taking advantage of the edict of grace by the
necessity it imposed of undergoing the horrible <i>verguenza</i>
already described, applied now to the Pontiff for secret
absolution. This required special briefs. Special briefs brought
money into the papal coffers, and procured converts to the Faith.
Two better reasons for granting these requests it would have been
impossible to have urged, and so the Curia acceded.</p>
<p>But the result of this curial interference with the autonomous
jurisdiction of the Holy Office in Spain was to provoke the
resentment of Torquemada. Wrangles ensued between the Grand
Inquisitor and the Pontifical Court&mdash;wrangles which may be
likened to those of two lawyers over a wealthy client.</p>
<p>Torquemada arrogantly demanded that this Roman protection of
heretics should not only cease in future but be withdrawn where
already it had been granted in the past, and his demand had the
full support of Catholic Ferdinand, who did not at all relish the
spectacle of the gold of his subjects being poured into any
treasury other than his own. Rome, having meanwhile pocketed the
fees, was disposed to be amenable to the representations of the
Catholic Sovereigns and their Grand Inquisitor; and the Pope
proceeded flagrantly to cancel the briefs of dispensation that
had been granted.</p>
<p>There was an outcry from the swindled victims. They protested
appealingly to the Pope that they had confessed their sins
against the Faith, and that absolution had been granted them.
Very rightly they urged that this absolution could not now be
rescinded&mdash;for not even the Pope had power to do so
much&mdash;and they argued that, being in a state of grace, they
could not now be prosecuted for heresy.</p>
<p>But they overlooked the retrospective power
which&mdash;however unjustifiable by canon or any other
law&mdash;the Inquisition had arrogated to itself. By virtue of
this, as we have seen, the inquisitors could take proceedings
even against one who had died in a state of grace, at peace with
Holy Mother Church, if it were shown that an offence of heresy
committed at some stage of his life had not been expiated in a
manner that the Holy Office accounted condign.</p>
<p>These protests of the unfortunate Judaizers, who by their own
action had achieved&mdash;as they now realized&mdash;no more than
self-betrayal, were met by the priestly answer that their sins
had been absolved in the tribunal of conscience only, and that it
still remained for them to seek temporal absolution in the
tribunal of the Holy Office. This temporal absolution would
accord them, as we know&mdash;and as they knew&mdash;the right to
live in perpetual imprisonment after the confiscation of their
property and the destitution and infamy of their children.</p>
<p>The answer, crafty and sophistical as it was, did not suffice
to silence the protests. Clamorously these continued, and the
Pope, unable to turn a deaf ear upon them, fearful lest a scandal
should ensue, effected a sort of compromise. With the royal
concurrence, Innocent VIII issued several bulls, each commanding
the Catholic Sovereigns to admit fifty persons to secret
absolution with immunity from punishment. These secret
absolutions were purchased at a high price, and they were granted
upon the condition that in the event of the re-Judaizing of a
person so absolved, he would be treated as relapsed, the secret
absolution being then published.</p>
<p>These absolutions were particularly useful in the case of
persons deceased, several of whom, at the petition of the heirs,
were included among the secretly reconciled&mdash;the inheritance
being thereby secured from confiscation.</p>
<p>Altogether Pope Innocent granted four of these bulls in 1486.*
In the last one issued he left it at the discretion of the
Sovereigns to indicate those who should be admitted to this
grace, and they were permitted to include the names even of
persons against whom proceedings had already been initiated.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lumbreras, quoted by Llorente, "Anales,"
vol. i. p. iii.]</p>
<p>With what degree of equanimity Torquemada viewed these bulls
of absolution we do not know. But very soon we shall see him
vexed by papal interference of a fresh character.</p>
<p>Simoniacal practices were never more rampant in Rome than
under the rule of Innocent VIII. His greed was notorious and
scandalous, and a number of alert baptized Jews bethought them
that this might be turned to account. They slyly submitted to the
Holy Father that although they were good Catholics, such was the
harshness of the Grand Inquisitor towards men of their blood that
they lived in constant dread and anxiety lest the mere
circumstance of their having originally been Jews should be
accounted a sufficient reason to bring them under suspicion or
should lay them open to the machinations of malevolent enemies.
Hence they implored his Holiness to grant them the privilege of
exclusion from inquisitorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>At a price this immunity was to be obtained; and soon others,
seeing the success that had attended the efforts of the
originators of this crafty idea, were following their example and
setting a drag upon the swift wheels of Torquemada's justice.</p>
<p>That it stirred him to righteous anger is not to be doubted,
however subservient and injured the tone in which he addressed
his protest to the Pontiff.</p>
<p>Innocent replied by a brief of November 27, 1487, that
whenever the Grand Inquisitor found occasion to proceed against
one so privileged, he should inform the Apostolic Court of all
that might exist against the accused, so that his Holiness should
determine whether the privilege was to be respected.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lumbreras, quoted by Llorente in "Anales,"
vol. i. p. 138.]</p>
<p>It follows inevitably that if there was heresy, or the
suspicion of it, the Pope must allow the justice of the Holy
Office to run its course. So that the Jews who had purchased
immunity must have realized that they were dealing with one who
understood the science of economics (and the guile to be
practised in it) even better than did they, famous as they have
always been for clear-sightedness in such matters.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the power that was vested in him, Torquemada
was amassing great wealth from the proportion of the
confiscations that fell to his share. But whatever his faults may
have been, he was perfectly consistent in them, just as he was
perfectly, terribly sincere.</p>
<p>Into the sin of pride he may have fallen. We see signs of it.
And, indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a man climbing from
the obscurity of the monastic cell to the fierce glare of his
despotic eminence and remaining humble at heart. Humble he did
remain; but with that aggressive humility which is one of pride's
worst forms and akin to self-righteousness&mdash;the sin most
dreaded by those who strive after sanctity.</p>
<p>We know that he unswervingly followed the stern path of
asceticism prescribed by the founder of his order. He never ate
meat; his bed was a plank; his flesh never knew the contact of
linen; his garments were the white woollen habit and the black
mantle of the Dominican. Dignities he might have had, but he
disdained them. Paramo says* that Isabella sought to force them
upon him, and that, in particular, she would have procured his
appointment to the Archbishopric of Seville when this was vacated
by the Cardinal of Spain. But he was content to remain the Prior
of Holy Cross of Segovia, as he had been when he was haled from
his convent to direct the affairs of the Holy Office in Spain.
The only outward pomp he permitted himself was that whenever now
he went abroad he was attended by an escort of fifty mounted
familiars and two hundred men on foot. This escort Llorente
admits** was imposed by the Sovereigns. It is possible, as is
suggested, that it was to defend him from his enemies, since the
death of Arbués had shown to what lengths the New-Christians were
prepared to go. But it is more probable that this escort was
accepted as an outward sign of the dignity of his office, and
perhaps also to serve the terrorizing purpose which Torquemada
considered so very salutary.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "De Origine," p. 276.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Critica," tom. ii. p. 146.]</p>
<p>That he practised the contempt for worldly riches which he
preached is beyond all doubt. We cannot discover that any of the
wealth that accrued to him was put to any worldly uses or went in
any way to benefit any member of his family. Indeed, we have
already seen him refusing suitably to dower his sister, allowing
her no more than the pittance necessary to enable her to enter a
convent of the Tertiary Order of St. Dominic.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 157.]</p>
<p>He employed the riches which his ofifice brought him entirely
to the greater honour and glory of the religion which he served
with such terrible zeal. He spent it lavishly upon such works as
the rebuilding of the Dominican Convent of Segovia, together with
the contiguous church and offices. He built the principal church
of his family's native town of Torquemada and half of the great
bridge over the River Pisuerga.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See H. del Castillo, "Historia General de
Santo Domingo."]</p>
<p>Fidel Fita quotes an interesting letter of Torquemada's, dated
August 17, 1490, in which he thanks the gentry of Torquemada for
having sent him a sumpter-mule, but rather seems to rebuke the
gift.</p>
<p>"To me," he writes, "it was not, nor is necessary to send such
things; and it is certain that I should have sent back the gift
but that it might have offended you; for I, praised be our Lord,
possess nine sumpter-mules, which suffice me."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* " Boletin de la Academia," vol. xxiii. p.
413.]</p>
<p>In sending the gift they had asked him for assistance towards
the work being carried out in the church of Santa Ollala, the
contribution he had already made not having proved sufficient. He
replies regretting that he can do nothing at the moment, as he is
not with the Court, but promises that upon his return thither he
will do the necessary with the Sovereigns so as to be able to
send them the further funds they require."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Castillo. "Historia de Sto. Domingo," pt.
i. p. 486]</p>
<p>As early as 1482 he began to build at Avila the church and
monastery of St. Thomas. This pleasant little country town,
packed within its narrow red walls and flanked with towers so
that it presents the appearance of a formidable castle, stands
upon rising ground in the fertile plain that is watered by the
River Adaja. Torquemada built his magnificent monastery beyond
the walls, upon the site of a humbler edifice that had been
erected by the pious D. Maria de Avila. It was completed by the
year 1493, and what moneys came to him thereafter appear to have
gone to the endowment of this vast convent&mdash;a place of
handsome, spacious, cloistered courts and splendid
galleries&mdash;which became at once his chief residence,
tribunal, and prison.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Ariz, "Historia de Avila," vol. i. p.
46.]</p>
<p>Again his fanatical hatred of the Israelites displays itself
in the condition he laid down&mdash;and whose endorsement he
obtained from Pope Alexander VI&mdash;that no descendant of Jew
or Moor should ever be admitted to these walls, upon which he
engraved the legend:</p>
<p align="center">PESTEM FUGAT HERETICAM.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 158.]</p>
<p>In this monastery the amplest provisions were made, not only
for the tribunal of the Inquisition, but also for the
incarceration of its prisoners.</p>
<p>Garcia Rodrigo, anxious to refute the widespread belief that
the prisons of the Inquisition were unhealthy subterranean
dungeons, draws attention to the airy, sunny chambers here set
apart for prisoners.* It is true enough in this instance, as
transpires from certain records that are presently to be
considered.** But it is not true in general, and it almost seems
a little disingenuous of Garcia Rodrigo to put forward a striking
exception as an instance of the rule that obtained.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Verdadera," vol. ii. p.
115.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** The case of the "Santo Niño of La
Guardia."]</p>
<p>Whatever the simplicity of Torquemada's life, and whatever his
personal humility, it would be idle to pretend that he was not
imbued with the pride and arrogance of his office, swollen by the
increase of power accorded him, until in matters of the Faith he
did not hesitate to dictate to the Sovereigns themselves, and to
reproach them almost to the point of menace when they were slow
to act as he dictated, whilst it was dangerous for any under
Sovereign rank to come into conflict with the Grand
Inquisitor.</p>
<p>As an instance of this, the case of the CaptainGeneral of
Valencia may be cited. The Inquisition of Valencia had arrested,
upon a charge of hindering the Holy Office, one Domingo de Santa
Cruz, whose particular offence, in the Captain-General's view,
came rather within the jurisdiction of the military courts.
Acting upon this opinion, he ordered his troops to take the
accused from the prison of the Holy Office, employing force to
that end if necessary.</p>
<p>The inquisitors of Valencia complained of this action to the
Suprema, whereupon Torquemada imperiously ordered the
Captain-General to appear before that council and render an
account of what he had done. He was supported in this by the
King, who wrote commanding the offender and all who had aided him
in procuring the release of Santa Cruz to submit themselves to
arrest by the officers of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Not daring to resist, that high dignitary was compelled humbly
to sue for absolution of the ecclesiastical censure incurred, and
he must have counted himself fortunate that Torquemada did not
subject him to a public humiliation akin to that undergone by the
Infante of Navarre.</p>
<p>The brilliant and illustrious young Italian, Giovanni Pico,
Count of Mirandola, had a near escape of falling into the hands
of the dread inquisitor. When Pico fled from Italy before the
blaze of ecclesiastical wrath which his writings had kindled.
Pope Innocent issued a bull, December 16, 1487, to Ferdinand and
Isabella, setting forth that be believed the Count of Mirandola
had gone to Spain with the intention of teaching in the
universities of that country the evil doctrines which he had
already published in Rome, notwithstanding that, having been
convinced of their error, he had abjured them. (Another case of
the "<i>e pur si muove</i>" of Galileo.) And since Pico was
noble, gentle, and handsome, amiable and eloquent of speech
(<i>Pseudopropheta est; dulcia loquitur et ad modicum
placet</i>), there was great danger that an ear might be lent to
his teachings. Wherefore his Holiness begged the Sovereigns that
in the event of his suspicions concerning Pico's intentions being
verified, their highnesses should arrest the Count, to the end
that the fear of corporal pains might deter him where the fear of
spiritual ones had proved insufficient.</p>
<p>The Sovereigns delivered this bull to Torquemada that he might
act upon it. But Pico, getting wind of the reception that awaited
him, and having sufficient knowledge of the Grand Inquisitor's
uncompromising methods to be alarmed at the prospect, took refuge
in France, where he wrote the apologia of his Catholicism, which
he dedicated to Lorenzo de Medici.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Fidel Fita in "Boletin," vol, xvi, p.
315.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>We have said, on the subject of the Inquisition's introduction
into Spain, that to an extent and after a manner this must be
considered the most justifiable&mdash;by which we are to be taken
to mean the least unjustifiable&mdash;of religious persecutions,
inasmuch as it had no concern save with deserters from the fold
of the Roman Church. Liberty was accorded to all religions that
were not looked upon as heretical&mdash;i.e. that were not in
themselves secessions from Roman Catholicism&mdash;and Jew and
Moslem had nothing to fear from the Holy Office. It was only
when, after having received baptism, they reverted to their
original cults, that they rendered themselves liable to
prosecution, being then looked upon as heretics, or, more
properly speaking, as apostates.</p>
<p>But this point of view, which satisfied the Roman See, did not
at all satisfy the Prior of Holy Cross. His bitter, fanatical
hatred of the Israelites&mdash;almost rivalling that of the Dean
of Ecija in the fourteenth century&mdash;urged him to violate
this poor remnant of equity, drove him to overstep the last
boundary of apparent justice, and carry the religious war into
the region of complete and terrible intolerance.</p>
<p>The reason he advanced was that as long as the Jews remained
undisturbed in the Peninsula, so long would a united Christian
Spain be impossible. Despite penances, imprisonments, and
burnings, the Judaizing movement went on. New-Christians were
seduced back into the error of the Mosaic Law, whilst conversion
amongst the Jews was checked by respect for the feelings of those
who remained true to their ancient faith. Nor did the Hebrew
offences against Christianity end there. There were the
indignities to which holy things were subjected at their hands.
There were criminal sacrileges in which&mdash;according to
Torquemada&mdash;they vented their hatred of the Holy Christian
Faith.</p>
<p>Such, for instance, was the outrage upon the crucifix at Casar
de Palomero in 1488.</p>
<p>On Holy Thursday of that year, in this village of the diocese
of Coria, several Jews, instead of being at home with closed
doors at such a season, as the Christian law demanded, were
making merry in an orchard, to the great scandal of a man named
Juan Caletrido, who there detected them.</p>
<p>The spy, moved to horror at the mere thought of these
descendants of the crucifiers daring to be at play upon such a
day as that, went to inform several others of what he had
witnessed. A party of young Spaniards, but too ready to combine
the performance of a meritorious act with the time-honoured sport
of Jewbaiting, invaded the privacy of the orchard, set upon the
Jews, and compelled them to withdraw into their houses.</p>
<p>Smarting under this indignity&mdash;for, when all is said,
they had been more or less private in their orchard, and they had
intended no offence by their slight evasion of the strict letter
of the law&mdash;they related the event to other members of the
synagogue, including the Rabbi.</p>
<p>From what ensued it seems plain that they must there and then
have determined to avenge the honour of their race, which they
conceived had been affronted.</p>
<p>Llorente, basing himself upon the chronicler Velasquez and the
scurrilous anti-Jewish writings of Torrejoncillo, supposes that
their aim was to repeat as nearly as possible the Passion of the
Nazarene upon one of His Images. That, indeed, may have been the
prejudiced view of the Grand Inquisitor.</p>
<p>But it is far more likely that, to spite these Christians who
had added this insult to the constant humiliations they were
putting upon the Israelites, the latter should simply have
resolved to smash one of the public symbols of Christianity. The
details of what took place do not justify the supposition that
their intentions went any deeper.</p>
<p>On the morrow, which was Good Friday, the circumstance of the
day contributing perhaps to the more popular version of the
story, whilst the Christians were in church for the service of
the Passion, a party of Jews repaired to an open space known as
Puerto del Gamo, where stood a large wooden crucifix. This image
they shattered and overthrew.</p>
<p>It is alleged that before finally breaking it they had
indulged in elaborate insult, "doing and saying all that their
rage dictated against the Nazarene."</p>
<p>An Old-Christian, named Hernan Bravo, having watched them, ran
to bear the tale of their sacrilegious deed. The Christians
poured tumultuously out of church, and fell upon the Jews. Three
of the latter were stoned to death on the spot; two others, one
of whom was a lad of thirteen, suffered each the loss of his
right hand; whilst the Rabbi Juan, being taken as an inciter, was
put to the question with a view to inducing him to confess. But
he denied so stoutly the things he was required to admit, and the
inquisitors tortured so determinedly, that he died upon the
rack&mdash;an irregularity this for which each inquisitor
responsible would have to seek absolution at the hands of the
other.</p>
<p>All those who took part in the sacrilege suffered confiscation
of their property, whilst the pieces of the crucifix, which had
become peculiarly sanctified by the affair, were gathered up and
conveyed to the Church of Casar, where, upon being repaired, the
image was given the place of honour.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," vol. i. p. 168, and
Torrejoncillo, "Centinela contra Judios."]</p>
<p>It is extremely likely that the story of this outrage,
exaggerated as we have seen, would be one of the arguments
employed by Torquemada when first he began to urge upon the
attention of the Sovereigns the desirability of the expulsion of
the Jews. He would cite it as a flagrant instance of the Jewish
hatred of Christianity, which gave rise to his complaint and
which he contended rendered a united Spain impossible as long as
this accursed race continued to defile the land. Further, there
can be very little doubt that it would serve to revive and to
lend colour to the old stories of ritual murder practised by the
Jews and provided for by one of the enactments in the "Partidas"
code of Alfonso XI.</p>
<p>The reluctance of the Sovereigns to lend an ear to any such
arguments is abundantly apparent. Not Ferdinand in all his
bigotry could be blind to the fact that the chief trades of the
country were in the hands of the Israelites, and to the
inevitable loss to Spanish commerce, then so flourishing, which
must ensue on their banishment. Of their ability in matters of
finance he had practical and beneficial experience, and the
admirable equipment of his army in the present campaign against
the Moors of Granada was entirely due to the arrangements he had
made with Jewish contractors. Moreover, there was this war itself
to engage the attention of the Sovereigns, and so it was not
possible to lend at the moment more than an indifferent attention
to the fierce pleadings of the Grand Inquisitor.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, in 1490 an event came to light, to throw
into extraordinary prominence the practice of ritual murder of
which the Jews were suspected, and to confirm and intensify the
general belief in the stories that were current upon that
subject. This was the crucifixion at La Guardia, in the province
of La Mancha, of a boy of four years of age, known to history as
"the Holy Child of La Guardia."</p>
<p>A stronger argument than this afforded him for the furtherance
of his aims Torquemada could not have desired. And it is probably
this circumstance that has led so many writers to advance the
opinion that he fabricated the whole story and engineered the
substantiation of a charge that so very opportunely placed an
added weapon in his hands.</p>
<p>Until some thirty years ago all our knowledge of the affair
was derived from the rather vague "Testimonio" preserved in the
sanctuary of the martyred child, and a little history of the
"Santo Niño," by Martinez Moreno, published in Madrid in 1786.
This last&mdash;like Lope da Vega's drama upon the same
subject&mdash;was based upon a "Memoria" prepared by Damiano de
Vegas of La Guardia in 1544, at a time when people were still
living who remembered the incident, including the brother of a
sacristan who was implicated in the affair.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Fidel Fita in "Boletin," vol. xi p.
160.]</p>
<p>Martinez Moreno's narrative is a queer jumble of possible fact
and obvious fiction, which in itself may be responsible for the
opinion that the whole story was an invention of Torquemada's to
forward his own designs.</p>
<p>But in 1887 the distinguished and painstaking M. Fidel Fita
published in the "Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia" the
full record, which he had unearthed, of the proceedings against
Yucé (or José) Franco, one of the incriminated Jews.</p>
<p>A good deal still remains unexplained, and must so remain
until the records of the trials of the other accused are brought
to light. It may perhaps be well to suspend a final judgment
until then. Meanwhile, however, a survey of the discovered record
should incline us to the opinion that, if the story is an
invention, it is one for which those who were accused of the
crime are responsible&mdash;an unlikely contingency, as we shall
hope to show&mdash;and in no case can the inventor have been Frey
Tomás de Torquemada.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-19" name="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. THE LEGEND OF THE
SANTO NINO</h2>
<p>The extravagant story related by Martinez Moreno, the parish
priest of La Guardia, in his little book on the Santo Niño, is
derived, as we have said, partly from the "Testimonio "and partly
from the "Memoria" by de Vegas; further, it embodies all those
legendary, supernatural details with which the popular
imagination had embellished the theme.</p>
<p>Either it is one of those deliberate frauds known as "pious,"
or else it is the production of an intensely foolish mind. When
we consider that the author was a doctor of divinity and an
inquisitor himself, we prefer to incline to the former
alternative.</p>
<p>This mixture of fact and fiction sets forth how a party of
Jews from the townships of Quintana, Tenbleque, and La Guardia,
having witnessed an Auto de Fé in Toledo, were so filled with
rage and fury, not only against the Holy Tribunal, but against
all Christians in general, that they conspired together to
encompass a complete annihilation of the Faithful.</p>
<p>Amongst them was one Benito Garcia, a woolcomber of Las
Mesuras, who was something of a traveller, and who had learnt
upon his travels of a piece of sorcery attempted in France for
the destruction of the Christians, which had miscarried owing to
a deception practised upon the sorcerers.</p>
<p>The story is worth repeating for the sake of the light it
throws upon the credulity of the simple folk of Spain in such
matters, a credulity which in remote districts of the peninsula
is almost as vigorous to-day as it was in Moreno's century.</p>
<p>The warlocks, in that earlier instance of which Benito had
knowledge, were alleged to be a party of Jews who had fled from
Spain on the first institution of the Inquisition in Seville in
1482. They had repaired to France bent upon the destruction of
all Christians, to the end that the Children of Israel might
become lords of the land, and that the Law of Moses might
prevail. For the sorcery to which they proposed to resort they
required a consecrated wafer and the heart of a Christian child.
These were to be reduced to ashes to the accompaniment of certain
incantations, and scattered in the rivers of the country, with
the result that all Christians who drank the waters must go mad
and die.</p>
<p>Having obtained the wafer, they now approached an impoverished
Christian with a large family, and tempted him with money to sell
them the heart of one of his numerous children. The Christian, of
course, repudiated the monstrous proposal. But his wife, who
combined cunning with cupidity, drove with the Jews the bargain
to which her husband refused to be a party, and having killed a
pig she sold them the heart of the animal under obviously false
pretences.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the enchantment which the deluded Jews
proceeded to carry out had no such effect as was desired and
expected.</p>
<p>Armed with his full knowledge of what had happened, Benito now
proposed to his friends that they should have recourse to the
same enchantment in Spain, making sure, however, that the heart
employed was that of a Christian boy. He promised them that by
this means, not only the inquisitors, but all the Christians
would be destroyed, and the Israelites would remain undisputed
lords of Spain.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">BANNER OF THE INQUISITION<br>
From Limborch's "Historia Inquisitionis."</p>
<p>Amongst those who joined him in the plot was a man named Juan
Franco, of a family of carriers of La Guardia. This man went with
Benito to Toledo on the Feast of the Assumption, intent upon
finding a child for their purpose. They drove there in a cart,
which they left outside the city while they went separately about
their quest.</p>
<p>Franco found what he sought in one of the doorways of the
Cathedral, known as the Puerta del Perdon&mdash;the door, adds
Moreno, through which the Virgin entered the church when she came
from heaven to honour with the chasuble her votary St. Ildefonso.
The Jew beheld in this doorway a very beautiful child of three or
four years of age, the son of Alonso de Pasamontes. His mother
was near at hand, but she was conveniently blind&mdash;i.e.
conveniently for the development of Moreno's story, this
blindness serving not only the purpose of rendering the child's
undetected abduction easily possible, but also that of affording
the martyred infant scope for the first miraculous manifestation
of his sanctity.</p>
<p>Juan Franco lured the boy away with the offer of sweetmeats.
He regained his cart with his victim, concealed the latter
therein, and so returned to La Guardia. There he kept the child
closely and safely until Passion Week of the following year, or,
rather, until the season of the Passover, when the eleven
Jews&mdash;six of whom had received Christian
baptism&mdash;assembled in La Guardia. They took the child by
night to a cave in the hills above the river, and there they
compelled him to play the protagonist part in a detailed parody
of the Passion, scourging him, crowning him with thorns, and
finally nailing him to a cross.</p>
<p>On the subject of the scourging, Moreno tells us that the Jews
carefully counted the number of lashes, aiming in this, as in all
other details, at the greatest historical fidelity. But when the
child had borne without murmuring upwards of five thousand
strokes, he suddenly began to cry. One of the Jews&mdash;finding,
we are to suppose, that this weeping required
explanation&mdash;asked him: "Boy, why are you crying?"</p>
<p>To this the boy replied that he was crying because he had
received five lashes more than his Divine Master.</p>
<p>"So that," says this doctor of divinity quite soberly, "if the
lashes received by Christ numbered 5,495, as computed by Lodulfo
Cartujano in his 'In Vita Christi,' those received by the Holy
Child Christoval were 5,500."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia del Santo Niño," p. 40.]</p>
<p>He mentions here the child's name as "Christoval," to which he
informs us that it was changed from "Juan," to the end that the
former might more aptly express the manner of his death. There is
no doubt that some such consideration weighed when the child was
given that suggestive name; but the real reason for it was that
no name was known (for the identity ot the boy did not
transpire), and it was necessary to supply him with one by which
he might be worshipped.</p>
<p>When he was crucified, his side was opened by one of the Jews,
who began to rummage* for the child's heart. He failed to find
it, and he was suddenly checked by the child's
question&mdash;"What do you seek, Jew? If you seek my heart, you
are in error to seek it on that side; seek on the other, and you
will find it."</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Rummage" is the only word that does
justice to the original; "Eljudio andaba buscando el corazon,
revolviendo las entrafSas con su mano carniciera, y no lo
hallando, le pergunté: 'Que buscas, Judio? Si buscas el corazon
yerras buscandolo en esa parte, buscalo al otro lado y lo
incontraras.'"&mdash;"Historia del Santo Niño," p. 50.]</p>
<p>In the very moment of his death, Moreno tells us, the Santo
Niño performed his first miracle. His mother, who had been blind
from birth, received the gift of sight in the instant that her
child expired.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia del Santo Niño," p. 95.]</p>
<p>This interpolation appears to be entirely Moreno's own, and it
is one of the justifications of our assumption that the work is
to be placed in the category of pious frauds. But he is, of
course, mistaken, by his own narrative, in announcing this as the
first of the child's miracles. He overlooks the miracle entailed
in the capacity to count displayed by a boy of four years of age,
and the further miracle of the speech addressed by the crucified
infant to the Jew who had opened his side.</p>
<p>Benito Garcia was given the heart, together with a consecrated
wafer which had been stolen by the sacristan of the Church of
Sta. Maria de La Guardia, and with these he departed to seek out
the mage who was to perform the enchantment. It happened,
however, that in passing through Astorga, Benito&mdash;who was
himself a <i>converso</i>&mdash;pretending that he was a faithful
Catholic, repaired to church, and, kneeling there, the more
thoroughly to perform this comedy of devoutness, he pulled out a
Prayer Book, between the leaves of which the consecrated wafer
had been secreted.</p>
<p>A good Christian kneeling some little way behind him was
startled to see a resplendent effluence of light from the book.
Naturally he concluded that he was in the presence of a miracle,
and that this stranger was some very holy man. Filled with
reverent interest, he followed the Jew to the inn where he was
lodged, and then went straight to the father inquisitors to
inform them of the portent he had witnessed, that they might
investigate it.</p>
<p>The inquisitors sent their familiars to find the man, and at
sight of them Benito fell into terror, "so that his very face
manifested how great was his crime." He was at once arrested, and
taken before the inquisitors for examination. There he
immediately confessed the whole affair.</p>
<p>Upon being desired to surrender the heart, he produced the box
in which it had been placed, but upon opening the cloth that had
been wrapped round it, the heart was discovered to have
miraculously vanished.</p>
<p>Yet another miracle mentioned by Moreno is that when the
inquisitors opened the grave . where it was said that the infant
had been buried, they found the place empty, and the Doctor
considers that since the child had suffered all the bitterness of
the Saviour's Passion, it was God's will that he should also know
the glories of the Resurrection, and that his body had been
assoomed into heaven.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The "Testimonio" from the archives of the parochial church of
La Guardia, printed on tablets preserved in the Sanctuary of the
Santo Niño, is quoted by Moreno,* and runs as follows:</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia del Santo Niño," p. 98 et
seq.]</p>
<p>"We, Pedro de Tapia, Alonso Doriga and Matheo Vazquez,
secretaries of the Council of the Holy and General Inquisition,
witness to all who may see this that by certain proceedings taken
by the Holy Office in the year 1491, the Most Reverend Frey Tomás
de Torquemada being Inquisitor-General in the Kingdoms of Spain,
and the inquisitors and judges by him deputed in the City of
Avila being the Very Reverend Dr. D. Pedro de Villada, Abbot of
San Marcial and San Millan in the Churches of Leon ,and Burgos,
the Licentiate Juan Lopez de Cigales, Canon of the Church of
Cuenca, and Frey Fernando de Santo Domingo of the Order of
Preachers, inquisitors as is said against heretical pravity, and
with power and special commission from the Very Reverend D. Pedro
Gonzalez de Mendoza, Cardinal of Santa Cruz, Archbishop of
Toledo, Primate of Spain, Grand Chancellor of Castile, and Bishop
of Siguenza.</p>
<p>"It transpires that the said inquisitors proceeding against
certain Jews and some New-Christians converted from Jews, of the
neighbourhood of La Guardia, Quintanar, and Tenbleque,
ascertained that amongst other crimes by these committed was
that: one of the said Jews and one of the newly-converted being
in Toledo and witnessing a burning that was being done by the
Holy Office in that city, they were cast down by this execution
of justice. The Jew said to the convert that he feared the great
harm that might come and did come to them from the Holy
Inquisition, and having treated of various matters germane to
this subject, the Jew said that if they could obtain the heart of
a Christian boy all could be remedied. And so, after his wide
practice in this matter, the Jew from the neighbourhood of
Quintanar undertook to procure a Christian boy for the said
purpose.</p>
<p>"And it was agreed that the said New-Christian should go to
Quintanar as soon as bidden by the Jew; and upon this
understanding each of the aforesaid left the City of Toledo and
returned to his own district.</p>
<p>"A few days later the said Jew summoned the New-Christian to
come to him in the village of Tenbleque, where he awaited him in
his father's house. There they foregathered, and agreed upon a
day when they should meet at Quintanar, whither the New-Christian
now returned, and informed, as he had agreed, a brother of his
own, who like himself was also a New-Christian, and he related
fully all that had been arranged, his brother being of the same
mind.</p>
<p>"The better to execute their accursed project, they arranged a
place to which the child should be brought, and what was to be
done&mdash;that this should be in a cave near La Guardia, on the
road to Ocaña, on the right-hand side. And thus to execute the
matter, the said New-Christian went to Quintanar on the day
arranged together with the said Jew.</p>
<p>"The better to dissemble, he went to a tavern, where presently
he was able to communicate with the Jew, and as a result of what
passed between them, the New-Christian went out to await him on
the road to Villa Palomas in a ravine, where presently he was
joined by the said Jew on an ass with the child before
him&mdash;of the age of three or four years.</p>
<p>"They went on together, and arrived after nightfall at the
said cave, whither came, as was arranged, the brother of the
New-Christian, and with him other newly-converted Jews, with whom
it appears that the aforesaid matter had been treated.</p>
<p>"Being all assembled in the cave, they lighted a candle of
yellow wax, and so that the light should not be seen they hung a
cloak over the mouth of the cave. They seized the boy, whom the
said Jew had taken from the Puerta del Perdon in
Toledo&mdash;which boy was named Juan, son of Alonso Pasamontes
and of Juana La Guindera. The said New-Christians now made a
cross out of the timbers of a ladder which had been brought from
a mill. They threw a rope round the boy's neck and they set him
on the cross, and with another rope they tied his legs and arms,
and they nailed his feet and hands to the cross with nails.</p>
<p>"Being thus placed (<i>puesto</i>), one of the NewChristians
from the neighbourhood of La Guardia bled the child, opening the
veins of his arms with a knife, and he caught the blood that
flowed in a cauldron; and with a rope in which they had tied
knots some whipped him, whilst others set a crown of thorns upon
his head. They struck him, spat upon him, and used opprobrious
words to him, pretending that what they were saying to the said
child was addressed to the Person of Christ. And whilst they
whipped him, they said: '<i>Betrayer, trickster, who, when you
preached, preached falsehood against the Law of God and Moses;
now you shall pay here for what you said then. You thought to
destroy us and to exalt yourself But we shall destroy you.' And
further: 'Crucify this betrayer who once announced himself King,
who was to destroy our temple</i>...' etc. etc.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* There is a great deal more of this, but
the alleged insults become too obscene for translation.]</p>
<p>"After the ill-treatment and vituperation, one of the
New-Christians from La Guardia opened the left side of the child
with a knife and drew out his heart, upon which he threw some
salt; and so the child expired upon the cross. All of which was
done in mockery of the Passion of Christ; and some of the
New-Christians took the body of the child and buried it in a
vineyard near Sta. Maria de Pera.</p>
<p>"A few days later the said Jew and NewChristians met again in
the cave and attempted certain enchantments and conjurations with
the heart of the child and a consecrated Host obtained through a
sacristan who was a New-Christian. This coniuration and
experiment they performed with the intention that the inquisitors
of heretical pravity and all other Christians should enrage and
die raging (<i>rabiendo</i>), and the Law of Jesus Christ our
Redeemer should be entirely destroyed and superseded by the Law
of Moses.</p>
<p>"When they saw that the said experiment did not operate nor
had the result they hoped, they assembled again elsewhere, and
having treated of all that they desired to effect, by common
consent one of them was sent with the heart of the said child and
the consecrated Host to the Aljama of Zamora, which they
accounted the principal Aljama in Castile, to the end that
certain Jews there, known to be wise men, should with the said
heart and Host perform the said experiment and sorcery that the
Christians might enrage and die, and thus accomplish what they so
ardently desired.</p>
<p>"And for the greater ascertaining of the crime and
demonstration of the truth, the said inquisitors having arrested
some of the said offenders, New-Christians and Jews, they set the
accused face to face, so that in the confession of their crimes
there was conformity, and these confessions consisted of what has
been here set down. In addition other further steps were taken to
verify the places where the crimes were committed and the place
where the child was buried; and they took one of the principal
accused to the place where the child was buried, and there they
found signs and demonstration of the truth of all.* Some of the
said accused, and some already deceased, being prosecuted, they
were sentenced and abandoned to the secular arm, all that we have
set down being in accordance with the records of the proceedings
to which we refer.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* But they did not find the body&mdash;a
circumstance which appears to be here slurred over.]</p>
<p>"The said 'Testimonio' written upon three sheets bearing our
rubrics, we the said secretaries deliver by request of the
Procurator-General of the village of La Guardia, by order of the
Very Illustrious Senores of His Majesty's Council of the Holy
Inquisition in the City of Madrid in the Diocese of Toledo, on
the 1 9th day of September of the year of the birth of our Lord
Jesus Christ, 1569.</p>

In cujus fide foedera consistunt. PEDRO DE TAPIA."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>This "Testimonio" does not afford us the name of any one of
the offenders&mdash;presumably that the holy place in which the
tablets were exposed should not be desecrated. When it is
compared with the account left by Moreno and the discrepancies
between the two become apparent, when, further, the extravagances
of Moreno's story are considered, it is not surprising that the
conclusion should have been reached that the whole affair was
trumped up to forward that campaign against the Jews to which
Torquemada was employing his enormous energies.</p>
<p>But the records of the trial of Yucé Franco discovered by
Fidel Fita throw a very different light upon the matter. And
whilst we know that Torquemada did avail himself to the utmost of
this affair of the Santo Niño to encompass the banishment of the
Jews from Spain, we must consider all notion that he himself
simply invented the story to that end as completely dispelled by
the evidence that is now to be examined.</p>
<p>From the records of the trial of Yucé Franco we are to-day not
only able very largely to reconstruct the event, but also to
present a complete instance of the application of the
jurisprudence of the Inquisition. Indeed, had the archives of the
Holy Office been ransacked for an entirely typical prosecution,
embodying all the features peculiar to that terrible court, no
better instance than this could have been forthcoming.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-20" name="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XX. THE ARREST OF YUCÉ
FRANCO</h2>
<p>In May or June of 1490&mdash;the time of year being
approximately determined by the events that follow&mdash;a
baptized Jew of Las Mesuras named Benito Garcia put up at an inn
in the northern village of Astorga. He was an elderly man of some
sixty years of age, a wool-comber by trade and a considerable
traveller in the course of his trading.</p>
<p>In the common-room of the tavern where he sat at table were
several men of Astorga, who, either in a drunken frolic or
because they were thieves, went through the contents of his
knapsack, and discovered in it some herbs and a communion wafer,
which they at once assumed to be consecrated (and which it was
grossest sacrilege for a layman so much as to touch).</p>
<p>Uproar followed the announcement of the discovery. With cries
of "Sacrilege!" these thieving drunkards fell upon the Jew. They
beat him. They flung a rope about his neck, dragged him from the
inn and haled him into the presence of the Provisor of Astorga,
Dr. Pedro de Villada. The reverend doctor discharged there the
functions of an agent of the Holy Office. He was fully
experienced in inquisitorial affairs, and he was upon the eve of
being promoted to the dignity of inquisitor in the court of
Avila.</p>
<p>Villada received the wafer, heard the accusation, and took a
short way with Benito when the latter refused to explain himself.
He ordered him two hundred lashes, and finding the man still
obdurate after this punishment, he submitted him to the
watertorture. Under this the wretched fellow at last betrayed
himself. Of precisely what he said we have no record taken at the
time; but we have his own word for it&mdash;as reported
afterwards by Yucé Franco to whom he uttered it&mdash;that "he
had said more than he knew, and enough to burn him."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Fidel Fita in "Boletin de la Real
Academia," vol. xi. p. 35. "Mas de lo que sabia" is the actual
and rather ambiguous phrase. It may mean either that he had
related more than was known to him at the time of the
torture&mdash;i.e. more than was actually true; or that he had
said more than he knew&mdash;i.e. more than he could
recall&mdash;now, at the time of his conversation with Yucé
Franco.]</p>
<p>Having, as is clear, obtained from him an admission of his own
guilt, Villada now proceeded, as prescribed by the "Directorium,"
to induce him to incriminate others. We know the methods usually
employed; from these and from what follows it is quite reasonable
to assume that recourse was had to them now.</p>
<p>Following Eymeric's instructions, Villada would, no doubt,
admonish him with extreme kindness, professing to cast no blame
upon Benito himself but rather upon those evil ones who had
seduced him into error, and he would exhort the prisoner to save
himself by showing a true penitence, pointing out that the only
proof of his penitence he could advance would be a frank and free
delation of those who had led him so grievously astray.</p>
<p>From the occasional glimpses of this Benito Garcia vouchsafed
us in the records of the trial of Yucé Franco, we perceive a
rather reckless personality, of a certain grim, sardonic humour,
gleams of which actually pierce through the dehumanization of the
legal documents to ensnare our sympathy.</p>
<p>He is imbued with contempt for these Christians whose religion
he embraced forty years ago, in what he accounts a weak moment of
his youth, and from which he secretly seceded again some five
years before his arrest. He is weighed down by remorse for having
been false to the Jewish faith in which he was born; he believes
himself overtaken by the curse which his father launched upon him
when he took that apostatizing step; he is out of all conceit
with Christianity; since seeing the bonfires of the Faith he has
come to the conclusion that as a religion it is an utter failure;
it has been his habit to sneer at Jews who were inclining to
Christianity.</p>
<p>"Get yourselves baptized," was the gibe he flung at them, "and
go and see how they burn the New-Christians."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See this upon his own word, as related in
Yucé Franco's depositions ("Boletin," xi. p. 35 et seq.) and
admitted by himself.]</p>
<p>In the prison of Avila&mdash;when he gets there&mdash;his one
professed aim is to die in the faith of his fathers.</p>
<p>But it would seem that when first taken in the toils of the
Inquisition, and having experienced in his own person the horrors
of its methods, he realizes the sweetness of life, and eagerly
avails himself of the false loophole so alluringly exposed by the
reverend doctor.</p>
<p>In his examination of June 6 he betrays to Villada the course
of his re-Judaizing. He relates that five years ago, whilst in
talk with one Juan de Ocaña, a converso whom he believes to be a
Jew at heart under an exterior of Christianity, the latter had
urged him to return to the Jewish faith, saying that Christ and
the Virgin were myths, and that there is no true law but that of
Moses. Lending an ear to these persuasions, Benito had done many
Jewish things, such as not going to church (although he whipped
his children when they stayed away, lest their absence should
betray his own apostasy) nor observing holy-days, eating meat on
Fridays and fast-days at the house of Mosé Franco and Yucé
Franco&mdash;Jews of the neighbourhood of Tenbleque&mdash;and
wherever else he could eat it without being detected. Indeed, for
the past five years, he admits, he has been a Jew at heart, and
if during that time he did not more completely observe Jewish
rites and practices, it was because he dared not for fear of
being discovered; whilst all the Christian acts he had performed
had been merely a simulation, that he might appear to be a
Christian still. The confessions he had made to the priest of La
Guardia had been false ones, and he had never gone to
Communion&mdash;"believing that the Corpus Christi was all a
farce (<i>creyendo que todo era burla el Corpus Christi</i>)!' He
even added that whenever he saw the Viaticum carried through the
streets, it was his habit to spit and to make higas (a gesture of
contempt).*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* " Boletin," xi. p. 60.]</p>
<p>In these last particulars his confession is of an extreme
frankness, and we can only suppose that he is merely repeating
what the torture had already extracted from him. Completely to
elucidate the matter as it concerns Benito Garcia, we should
require to be in possession of the full records of his own trial
(which have not yet been discovered), whereas at present we have
to depend upon odd documents from that <i>dossier</i> which are
introduced in Yucé Franco's as relating to the latter.</p>
<p>Questioned more closely concerning these Jews he has
mentioned&mdash;Mosé and Yucé Franco&mdash;Benito states that
they lived with their father, Ça Franco, at Tenbleque, that he
was in the habit of visiting them upon matters of business, and
that he had frequently eaten meat at their house on Fridays and
Saturdays and other forbidden days, and had often given them
money to purchase oil for the synagogue lamps.</p>
<p>We know that, as a consequence of these confessions, Ça
Franco, an old man of eighty years of age, and his son Yucé, a
lad of twenty who was a cobbler by trade, were arrested on July
i, 1489, for proselytizing practices&mdash;i.e. for having
induced Benito Garcia to abandon the Christian faith to which he
had been converted.</p>
<p>Ça's other son, Mosé, was either dead at the time or else he
died very shortly after arrest and before being brought to
trial.</p>
<p>Juan de Ocaña, too, was arrested upon the same grounds.</p>
<p>They were taken to Segovia, and thrown into the prison of the
Holy Office in that city. In this prison Yucé Franco fell so
seriously ill that he believed himself at the point of death.</p>
<p>A physician named Antonio de Avila, who spoke either Hebrew or
the jargon of Hebrew and Romance that was current among the Jews
of the Peninsula, went to attend to the sick youth. Yucé implored
this doctor to beseech the inquisitors to send a Jew to pray with
him and to prepare him for death&mdash;"<i>que le dixiese las
cosas que disen los Judios quando se quieren morir</i>."</p>
<p>The physician, who, like all the family of the Inquisition,
was himself a spy, duly conveyed the request to the inquisitors.
They seized the chance to put into practice one of the
instructions advanced by Eymeric. They sent a Dominican, one Frey
Alonso Enriquez, disguised as a Jew, to minister to the supposed
moribund. The friar had a fluent command of the language spoken
by the Jews of Spain. He introduced himself to the lad as a Rabbi
named Abraham, and completely imposed upon him and won his
confidence.</p>
<p>He pressed Yucé to confide in him, and in his manner of doing
so he proceeded along the crafty lines advocated by the
"Directorium."</p>
<p>Eymeric, as will be remembered, enjoins that when a prisoner
is examined, the precise accusation against him should not be
disclosed; rather he should be questioned as to why he conceives
that he has been arrested and by whom he supposes himself to have
been accused, with the object of perhaps discovering further and
hitherto unsuspected matters against him. Against Yucé Franco and
the other prisoners there was at this stage no charge beyond
that&mdash;serious enough in itself&mdash;of having induced
Benito Garcia to re-Judaize. But the disguised friar now pressed
him with probing questions, asking him what he had done to get
himself arrested.</p>
<p>Yucé&mdash;who did not yet know what was the
charge&mdash;entirely duped, and believing that his visitor was a
Rabbi of his own faith, replied that "<i>he had been arrested on
account of the</i> mita of a nahar, <i>which had been after the
manner of Otohays</i>."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "...estava alli sobre una MITA de NAHAR
que avido sido como de la manera de OTOHAYS."]</p>
<p>We have left the Hebrew words untranslated to illustrate the
unintelligibility of the phrase to the general.</p>
<p><b>Mita</b> means "killing," <i>nahar</i> means "a boy,"
whilst <i>Otohays</i>&mdash;literally "that man"&mdash;is
startling because it is identical with the term used in St. Luke
(xxiii. 4) and in the Acts of the Apostles (v. 28) to designate
Christ.</p>
<p>Yucé begged the false Rabbi Abraham to go to the Chief Rabbi
of the Synagogue of Segovia,* a man of very considerable
importance and influence, and to inform him of this fact, but
otherwise to keep the matter very secret.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Loeb in "Revue des Etudes Juives,"
vol. xv. p. 218.]</p>
<p>The Dominican repaired to the inquisitors who had sent him
with this very startling piece of information, which was
corroborated by the physician, who had remained well within
earshot during the entire interview.</p>
<p>By order of the inquisitors Frey Alfonso Enriquez returned to
Yucé's prison a few days later to attempt to elicit from the
young Jew further particulars of the matter to which he had
alluded. But the lad&mdash;probably considerably recovered by
now, and therefore more alert&mdash;evinced the greatest mistrust
of the physician Avila, who was hovering near them, and would not
utter another word on the subject.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* This is not only in the depositions of
Frey Alfonso Enriquez and the physician Avila ("Boletin," xi. pp.
56 and 57), but it is also admitted and corroborated in detail by
Yucé Franco himself in his examination of September 16, 149 1
(<i>ibid</i>. p. 58).]</p>
<p>The matter was of such gravity that we are quite safe in
assuming&mdash;and we have evidence to warrant the
assumption&mdash;that it was instantly communicated to
Torquemada, who at the time was at his convent of Segovia,
practically upon the spot.</p>
<p>We know&mdash;as will presently transpire&mdash;that it was by
order of Torquemada that Yucé Franco and the others came to be in
the prison of the Holy Office at Segovia, instead of in that of
the extremely active Inquisition of Toledo, within whose
jurisdiction the accused dwelt and the crime had been committed.
We are unable to give an absolutely authentic reason for this.
But we gather that the examination of Ça Franco, or of Ocaña, or
perhaps of Benito himself&mdash;who had said "more than he
knew"&mdash;must have yielded disclosures of such a nature that
upon learning them the Grand Inquisitor had desired that the
trial should be conducted immediately under his own
direction.</p>
<p>The Sovereigns, who had been in Andalusia since May of the
previous year, about the war upon Granada, now wrote to
Torquemada&mdash;in July 1490&mdash;bidding him join them
there.</p>
<p>From Segovia the Grand Inquisitor replied, urging very
pressing business to which he proposed to give his personal
attention, wherefore he begged them to permit him to postpone his
response to their summons.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," vol. xxiii. p. 413.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>He quitted Segovia at about this time to repair to Avila,
where the work upon the church and monastery of St. Thomas was
well advanced; so well advanced, indeed, that already he was able
to take up his residence in the monastery.</p>
<p>We may assume that the pressing business he had urged to the
Sovereigns as an excuse for postponing his journey into Andalusia
was the business of inquiring into the alleged crimes of these
Hebrew prisoners. For we know that he had intended having them
brought before himself at Avila, but that being unable to dispose
of the matter before tlie end of August or to postpone beyond
that time his departure to rejoin the Court, he was compelled to
entrust the matter to his delegates&mdash;the Dominican Frey
Fernando de Santo Domingo, and the sometime Provisor of Astorga,
Dr. Pedro de Villada, with whom, no doubt, he would
leave&mdash;as he says himself&mdash;the fullest
instructions.</p>
<p>So much we are justified in assuming from the tenor of the
following letter, which he delivered to them under date of August
27, to serve them as their warrant to remove the prisoners from
Segovia and bring them to Avila for trial.</p>
<p>He wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We, Frey Tomás de Torquemada, Prior of the Monastery of Holy
Cross of Segovia, of the Order of Preachers, Confessor and
Councillor to the King and Queen, our Sovereign lords,
Inquisitor-General of heretical pravity and apostasy in the
Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon and all other Dominions of their
Highnesses, so deputed by the Holy Apostolic See,</p>
<p>"Make known to you. Reverend and Devout Fathers, D. Pedro de
Villada, Doctor of Canon Law...Juan Lopes de Cigales, Licentiate
of Holy Theology...and to you, Frey Fernando de Santo Domingo...
Inquisitors of heretical pravity in the said City and Bishopric
of Avila,</p>
<p>"That we, by certain and legitimate information received,
ordered the arrest of the persons and bodies of Alonso Franco,
Lope Franco, Garcia Franco, and Juan Franco of the neighbourhood
of La Guardia in the Archbishopric of Toledo, and of Yucé Franco,
a Jew of the neighbourhood of Tenbleque, and of Mosé Abenamias, a
Jew of the City of Zamora, and of Juan de Ocaña and Benito
Garcia, of the neighbourhood of the said place of La Guardia, and
the sequestration of all their property for having practised
heresy and apostasy and for having perpetrated certain deeds,
crimes, and offences against our Holy Catholic Faith, and we
ordered them to be taken to and held in the prison of the Holy
Inquisition of the City of Segovia until their cases should be
fully known to and decided by us or by such person or persons to
whom we consign them upon being so acquainted.</p>
<p>"But inasmuch as we are now occupied with other and arduous
matters, and therefore may not personally acquaint ourselves with
the said cases or with any one of them, trusting in the legality,
learning, experience, and sound conscience of you, the said
Reverend Father Inquisitors and of each of you, and that you are
such persons as will well and faithfully discharge what we
entrust to you by these presents we commit to you, the said
Reverend Father Inquisitors, and to each of you, <i>in
solidum</i>, the said proceedings against and trials of the
aforementioned and of any of them, whether they may have been
participators or accessories before or after the fact of the said
crimes and offences in any way committed against our Holy
Catholic Faith, and likewise of the abettors, counsellors,
defenders, concealers, those who had knowledge of the facts and
offenders of whatsoever degree, to the end that concerning them
you may receive and obtain any information from any part of the
said Kingdoms, and seize and examine any witness, and inquire,
learn, proceed, imprison, sentence, and abandon to the secular
arm such as you may find guilty, absolve and liberate those
without guilt, and do concerning them all things and any thing
that we ourselves should do being present...</p>
<p>"And by these presents we order the Father Inquisitors of the
City of Segovia and each and any of them in whose power are the
said prisoners to deliver them immediately in safe custody to
you.</p>
<p>"Given in the Monastery of St. Thomas of the said Order of
Preachers, which is beyond and near the walls of the said City of
Avila."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p, 9.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>At what stage of the affair the four brothers Franco of La
Guardia&mdash;Alonso, Lope, Garcia, and Juan&mdash;had been
arrested, and upon whose information, we do not know. But we do
know&mdash;for the <i>dossier</i> of Yucé's trial is
complete&mdash;that they were not betrayed by Yucé.</p>
<p>That their names had been divulged is a confirmation of the
surmise that the examinations of Ocaña, or Ça Franco, or even
Benito Garcia, had already yielded further information on the
subject of the affair of La Guardia.</p>
<p>It must be understood that the record of any examination of
these prisoners in which the name of Yucé Franco was not
mentioned would find no place in the <i>dossier</i> of the
latter's trial.</p>
<p>The four Francos of La Guardia were brothers, as we have said;
but they were nowise related to the Francos of Tenbleque&mdash;Ça
and Yucé. They were dealers in cereals&mdash;possibly
millers&mdash;as we shall see, and they owned a number of carts
which they appear to have further employed in a carrier's
business. They were baptized Jews, as is already made clear in
Torquemada's letter by the fact that he does not describe
them&mdash;as he does the others&mdash;as Jews.</p>
<p>All concerned in the affair, with the exception of one Ribera,
who does not at present enter into consideration, were men drawn
from a humble class of life&mdash;a class which through ignorance
has always been credulous and prone to belief in sorcery and
enchantments.</p>
<p>A curious circumstance is the omission in Torquemada's letter
of all mention of the octogenarian Ça Franco, whom we know to
have been already under arrest.</p>
<p>Having thus entrusted the conduct of the affair to his
subordinates, the Grand Inquisitor set out to join the Sovereigns
in Andalusia.</p>
<p>The prisoners were soon afterwards brought to Avila, secrecy
being so well observed that each remained in ignorance of the
arrest of the others. But before being transferred from Segovia
Yucé was taken before the Holy Office there for examination on
October 27 and 28. And from the nature of the questions&mdash;as
revealed by the depositions made&mdash;we are left to assume that
the inquisitors aimed at further incriminating the Francos of La
Guardia, proceeding upon information extracted from them, or else
obtained from one of the other prisoners.</p>
<p>In answer to the questions set him, Yucé Franco deponed that
some three years earlier he had gone to La Guardia to buy wheat
for the unleavened bread of the Passover from Alonso Franco,
having been told that the latter had wheat of good quality for
sale. He sought Alonso in the market, and thence accompanied him
to his house. Talking as they went, Alonso asked him why they
made this unleavened bread, to which Yucé replied that it was to
commemorate God's deliverance of the Children of Israel out of
Egypt.</p>
<p>The question may certainly seem an odd one from a man who had
been born a Jew. But it should be remembered that ignorance and
lack of education might easily account for it.</p>
<p>Yucé further deponed that in the pursuit of this conversation
Alonso not only betrayed nostalgic leanings towards his original
faith, but actually admitted that together with some of his
brothers he had crucified a boy one Good Friday in the manner
that the Jews had crucified Christ.</p>
<p>Continuing, he said that Alonso had asked him whether the
Paschal lamb eaten by the Jews at the time of leaving Egypt had
been <i>terefa</i> (slaughtered and bled in the Jewish manner),
to which Yucé had replied that it had not, as at that time the
Law had not yet been made.</p>
<p>These replies were construed by the inquisitors into
admissions of proselytizing on the part of Yucé, and when
subsequently at Avila (January 10, 1491) he was reminded of what
he had said at Segovia concerning what had passed between Alonso
Franco and himself, and asked whether he could remember anything
further, he confirmed all that he had already deponed, but could
only add a question on the subject of circumcision which had been
addressed to him by Alonso.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 29.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The fiscal advocate, or prosecutor of the tribunal, prepared
his case against Yucé Franco, and on December 17, 1490, he came
before the court at the audience of vespers to open the
prosecution.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-21" name="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI. THE TRIAL OF YUCÉ
FRANCO</h2>
<p>The Fiscal, D. Alonso de Guevára, announces to their Reverend
Paternities that his denunciation of Yucé Franco is prepared, and
he solicits them to order the prisoner to be brought into the
audience-chamber that he may hear it read.</p>
<p>The apparitor of the court introduces the accused into the
presence of the inquisitors and their notary, to whom GuevcLra
now hands his formal accusation. This the notary proceeds to
read. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Most Reverend and Virtuous Sirs,&mdash;I, Alonso de Guevára,
Bachelor of Law, Fiscal Prosecutor of the Holy Inquisition in
this City and Diocese of Avila, appear before your Reverend
Paternities in the manner by law prescribed, to denounce Yucé
Franco, Jew, of the neighbourhood of Tenbleque, who is
present.</p>
<p>"Not content that, in common with all other Jews, he is
humanely permitted to abide and converse with the faithful and
Catholic Christians, he did induce and attract some Christians to
his accursed Law with false and deceptive doctrines and
suggestions, telling them that the Law of Moses is the true one,
in which there is salvation, and that the Law of Jesus Christ is
a false and fictitious Law never imposed or decreed by God.</p>
<p>"And with infidel and depraved soul he went with some others
to crucify a Christian boy, one Good Friday, almost in the manner
and with that hatred and cruelty with which the Jews, his
ancestors, crucified our Redeemer Jesus Christ, mocking and
spitting upon him, striking and wounding him with the aim of
vituperating and deriding our Holy Catholic Faith and the Passion
of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>"Item, he contrived, as principal, together with others, to
obtain a consecrated Host to be outraged and mocked in
vituperation and contempt of our Holy Catholic Faith, and because
amongst the other Jews&mdash;accomplices in the said
crime&mdash;there were certain sorcerers who on the day of their
Passover of unleavened bread were to commit enchantments with the
said Host and the heart of a Christian boy. And if this were
done, as said, all Christians were to enrage and die. The
intention moving them was that the Law of Moses should be more
widely kept and honoured, its rites and precepts and ceremonies
more freely solemnized, that the Christian Religion should perish
and be subverted, and that they, themselves, should become
possessed of all the property of the Catholic and Faithful
Christians, and there should be none to interfere with their
perverse errors, and their generation should grow and multiply
upon the earth, that of the Faithful Christians being entirely
extirpated.</p>
<p>"Item, he committed other crimes concerning the Holy Office of
the Holy Inquisition, as I shall state and allege in the course
of these proceedings as far as I may consider necessary.</p>
<p>"Wherefore I beg you. Reverend Sirs, that you pronounce the
said Yucé Franco, for the said crimes, to be a malefactor,
abettor of heretics, and a subverter and destroyer of the
Catholic and Christian Law; and that he shall be deemed to have
fallen Into and incurred all the penalties and censures
prescribed by canon and civil law for those who commit these
crimes, and the confiscation and loss of all his property, which
shall be applied to the royal treasury, and that he may be
abandoned to the secular arm and justice that it may do with him
as by law befits with a malefactor, an.. abettor of heretics, and
an extirpator of the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>"Wherefore I petition your Reverences to proceed against the
said Yucé Franco <i>simpliciter et de piano et sine estrepitu
judicii</i>, as runs the formula prescribed by law in such
cases,* to the end that justice may be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* By Eymeric in the "Directorium."]</p>
<p>"And I swear to God on this Cross on which I set my hand, that
this petition and denunciation which I bring against Yucé Franco
I do not bring maliciously, but because I believe him to have
committed all that I have stated, and to the end that justice may
be done and the wicked and the abettors of heretics be punished,
that the good men may be known and that our Holy Catholic Faith
may be exalted."</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," vol, xi. p. 13.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It will be seen presently that at this stage of the
proceedings Yucé had not the slightest suspicion that the
pretended Rabbi Abraham who had visited him in his prison of
Segovia when he lay sick was other than he had announced himself.
Nor did the accusation afford him the least hint that any of his
associates had been taken, or that Benito Garcia had been
examined under torture. So carefully had they managed things that
he was not even aware of the arrest of his old father.</p>
<p>Therefore it must have come as something of a shock to him to
hear this matter of the crucifixion of the child at La Guardia
included in the indictment. Nevertheless he unhesitatingly
pronounced the denunciation to be the "greatest falsehood in the
world."</p>
<p>Guevára answered this denial by petitioning the court to
receive the proofs which he was prepared to present.</p>
<p>Being asked whether in the preparation of his defence he would
require the services of counsel, Yucé replied in the affirmative,
and the tribunal appointed as his attorney the Bachelor Sanç,*
and as his advocate Juan de Pantigoso. The usual form of oath was
imposed upon these lawyers, and Yucé empowered them to act for
him within the narrow limitations imposed by the Holy Office,
which afforded them no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses
for the prosecution or even to be present at their
examination.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Such is the consistent but obviously
inaccurate spelling of the name.]</p>
<p>The notary of the court was ordered to supply the defendant
with a copy of the indictment, and Yucé was allowed a term of
nine days within which to prepare his answer.</p>
<p>Five days later the accused successfully petitions the court
that to the advocate appointed him be added one Martin Vazquez,
to whom he gives the necessary powers. And it is this same Martin
Vazquez who on that very day&mdash;December 22,
1490&mdash;presents to the court the written repudiation of the
indictment, prepared by the Bachelor San9 in his client's
name.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The advocate begins by respectfully submitting that this court
has no jurisdiction over his client on the score of the crimes
alleged against him, since their Paternities are inquisitors
appointed&mdash;<i>Auctoritate Apostolica</i>&mdash;for the
Diocese of Avila only, and only over persons of that diocese.
Yucé is of the Diocese of Toledo, where there are inquisitors of
heretical pravity, before whom he is ready to appear to answer
any charges. Therefore his case should have been referred to that
court of Toledo, and their Paternities should never have received
Guevára's denunciation.</p>
<p>He proceeds to reprove their Paternities for having done so
upon sounder grounds, when he protests that the accusation is too
vague and general and obscure. It does not state place or year or
month or day or hour in which, or persons with whom, it is
alleged that his client committed the crimes set forth.</p>
<p>Further, he objects that since his client is a Jew, he cannot
with justice be accused of having fallen into the crime of heresy
or apostasy; and therefore it is not right that&mdash;as may be
done in the case of a heretic&mdash;the full expression and
elucidation of what is charged against him should be withheld,
since thus it is impossible for his client to defend himself, not
knowing what precisely are the charges made.</p>
<p>The advocate very rightly denounces it as against all equity
that the Fiscal should thus prejudice Yucé without
particularizing his accusation, and he warns their Paternities
that it may prove hurtful to their consciences if, as a result of
Guevára's generalizations, Yucé should come to suffer and die
undefended.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It is very unsatisfactory equity which says to a man, "You are
accused of such-and-such crimes. Prove your innocence of them, or
we punish you." But it is not equity at all that can say, "You
are accused of something; no matter what. Prove to us that you
are innocent of all the offences for which this tribunal may
proceed against you, or we find you guilty and send you to
death."</p>
<p>This, however, was precisely the method of the Holy Office,
and being aware of it, the advocate is forced to confess that in
a case of heresy secretly committed the Inquisition may admit an
accusation that does not specify time or place of the alleged
offence.</p>
<p>But this, he insists, does not apply to his client, who, being
a Jew and not having a baptized soul, may not truly be denounced
as a heretic. He appeals to the consciences of the inquisitors
not to admit the accusation, and finally he threatens that if
they do so, he will lodge a complaint where by right he may.</p>
<p>From all this it appears that so completely&mdash;as
completely as his client&mdash;is the advocate in ignorance of
the mainsprings of the prosecution that he does not even know
that the trial has been ordered by Torquemada, himself, to take
place in Avila. That warrant-letter of the Grand Inquisitor's has
not been divulged to the defendant, lest in learning the names of
his fellow-accused he should learn too much, be put upon his
guard, and equipped to set up a tenable defence.</p>
<p>But in any case, and to be on the safe side, the advocate
offers a categorical and eloquent denial of every count in the
Fiscal's indictment.</p>
<p>He scoffs at the absurdity of accusing Yucé Franco of seeking
to seduce Christians into embracing the Law of Moses. He urges
the lad's youth, his station in life, his general ignorance (even
of that same Law of Moses by which he lives), and the fact that
he has to work hard to make a living by his cobbler's trade; and
he adduces that his client has neither the time nor the knowledge
necessary to attempt any such proselytizing as that with which he
is charged.</p>
<p>He declares that if at any time Yucé did expound any part of
the Mosaic Law in answer to questions addressed to him (this
being obviously inspired by Yucé's recollection of the statements
he has made under examination concerning Alonso Franco) he did so
simply and frankly, with no thought of proselytizing, nor could
it so be construed. In fact, save for the answers returned by him
to questions asked by Alonso Franco, the lad does not remember
ever to have done even so much, which would have been no real
offence in any case.</p>
<p>Full and formal, too, is the denial of Yucé's participation in
the crucifixion of any boy, and of having procured or attempted
to procure a Host. The advocate ridicules the notion of this
cobbler-lad being a sorcerer, or having knowledge of, or interest
in, sorcery.</p>
<p>Finally&mdash;burrowing ever in the dark, and seeking to
undermine possibilities, since he is given no facts that he may
demolish&mdash;he suggests that the depositions received against
Yucé are perhaps susceptible of being interpreted in different
ways, and may refer equally to good or evil, and that since he is
accused and arrested the things he has, himself, deponed (i.e.
concerning Alonso Franco's Judaizing tendencies) should be
interpreted in his favour, and not against him.</p>
<p>Therefore he petitions their Reverend Paternities to order the
witnesses to declare with whom, where, when, and how Yucé
committed these things which are deponed against him. Failing
that, he begs them to declare his client acquitted, to release
him, restoring him his good fame and all property that may have
been confiscated by order of their Paternities or any other
judges of the Inquisition.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi, p. l6.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The court commanded the notary to prepare a copy of this plea,
and to deliver it to the Fiscal, who was instructed to reply to
it within three days. And they further commanded that at the time
of the delivery of the said reply, Yucé Franco should again be
brought before them that he might learn what was determined
concerning him.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The only matter of interest in the next sitting*&mdash;and
this from the point of view of the illustration which these
proceedings afford us of inquisitorial methods&mdash;is the
Fiscal's repudiation of any obligation on his part to precise the
time or place of the crimes with which Yucé Franco is accused,
and his insistence that, in spite of all that has been advajiced
by the defendant, the case must be considered one of heresy.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 21.]</p>
<p>The court evidently takes the same view, for it commands both
parties to the action to proceed to advance proof of their
respective contentions within thirty days. Meanwhile, to clear up
the matter of the venue, the court communicates with the Cardinal
of Spain. The Primate very promptly grants the requisite
permission to transfer the action to Avila from his own
Archbishopric of Toledo within whose jurisdiction it had lain.
This was the merest formality; for considering the explicit
commands in the matter left by the supreme arbiter, Torquemada,
the Cardinal could hardly have proceeded otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The methods now adopted by the Fiscal to obtain the proofs
which he requires, or at least to build a more complete and
overwhelming case&mdash;for we cannot but suppose that already he
had sufficient material upon which to have obtained a
conviction&mdash;are eminently typical.</p>
<p>We know that Ça Franco, Benito Garcia, Juan de Ocaña, and the
four Francos of La Guardia were all at this time in the hands of
the inquisitors; and it is not to be doubted that these men would
be undergoing constant examination. But it is obvious, from the
absence in the <i>dossier</i> with which we are concerned of any
document relating to this particular period, that no avowals were
made by his fellowprisoners to increase the incrimination of
Yucé.</p>
<p>Without wishing to set up too many hypotheses to bridge the
<i>lacunae</i> that result from the absence of the records of the
proceedings against the other accused, we would tentatively
suggest that in preparing that portion of his denunciation
relating to the crucifixion of the child, Guevára had simply
adapted details extracted from Benito to Yucé's vague admission
in the prison of Segovia. This conclusion is eminently
justifiable. It is based upon the fact that Guevára altogether
overstepped the limits of any evidence brought to light in the
whole course of the proceedings when he said that Yucé "contrived
as <i>principal</i>...to obtain a consecrated Host." Further it
is based upon the circumstance already mentioned that if in any
deposition of Benito or of any other of the accused, Yucé's
slightest participation in the affair of La Guardia had been
mentioned, such a deposition&mdash;or at least the respective
extract from it&mdash;must have found a place in the
<i>dossier</i> of his trial. And we know that no such document is
present.</p>
<p>Still further, we have the fact that the month prescribed by
the court for the submission of proof was allowed to expire and
another month after that, and still Guevára had no proofs to lay
before their Reverend Paternities, beyond the depositions we have
already seen. Meanwhile, Yucé continued to languish in
prison.</p>
<p>And here the following question suggests itself: In view of
the admission made by Yucé to the false Rabbi in Segovia, why was
he not closely and directly questioned upon that matter? and in
the event of his withholding details, why was he not put to
torture as by law prescribed?</p>
<p>Instead of that direct method of procedure, he was left in
complete ignorance of his self-betrayal and of the source whence
the inquisitors had derived their knowledge ot his association
with the afiair of La Guardia.</p>
<p>The only answer that suggests itself is that Torquemada
desired the matter to be very fully elucidated, that the net
should be very fully and carefully spread&mdash;as we shall
see&mdash;so that nothing and no one should escape. And yet this
answer is hardly entirely satisfactory.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>If Guevára allowed months to pass without being able to lay
the required proofs of Yucé's guilt before the court, on the
other hand Yucé himself had been similarly unable to supply his
counsel with any proof of his innocence&mdash;as indeed was
impossible in the absence of all particulars of the charges
against him.</p>
<p>Thus for a season the case remains in suspense.</p>
<p>Attempts to extract incriminating evidence from the other
prisoners having meanwhile failed by ordinary judicial methods,
the tribunal now has recourse to other means. Having failed to
compel or induce the prisoners into betraying one another, the
inquisitors now seek to lure them into selfbetrayal.</p>
<p>A well-known scheme is employed.</p>
<p>Benito is moved into a chamber immediately under Yucé's. To
while away the tedium of his imprisonment, and with a
light-heartedness that is a little startling in a man in his
desperate position, Yucé sits by his window thrumming a viol or
guitar one day towards the end of March or in early April. The
instrument may have been left with him by the gaoler who was in
the plot.</p>
<p>What was no doubt expected comes to pass. Yucé's music is
abruptly interrupted by a voice from below, which asks:</p>
<p>"Can you give me a needle, Jew?"</p>
<p>Yucé replies that he has no needle other than a
cobbler's.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p 32.]</p>
<p>The speaker is Benito Garcia, and it is certain that spies
have been set to overhear what passes. We know that their
conversation took place through a hole in the floor contrived by
the gaoler, who was acting upon the instructions of the
inquisitors.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 46.]</p>
<p>Yucé is very circumspect in all that he says; but Benito is
entirely reckless during those first days of their intercourse.
And yet, whilst he admits that he considers himself lost already
through what "that dog of a doctor" (by which he means the
Reverend Inquisitor, Dr. Villada) extracted from him under
torture in Astorga, he shows himself at other times not without
hope of regaining his freedom.</p>
<p>He mentions a man named Pena, who is the Alcalde of La
Guardia. This man, he says, is interested in him, and
has&mdash;or so Benito fancies&mdash;influence at Court which he
would exert on Benito's behalf did he but know of the latter's
position.</p>
<p>At another time he vows that, if ever he gets out of prison,
he will quit Spain and take himself off to Judea. He is convinced
that all this trouble has come upon him as a punishment for
having abandoned the Law of Moses and denied the true God to
embrace the rehgion of the Begotten God (<i>Dios Parido</i>).</p>
<p>But apart from these, there are no lamentations from him; more
usually he is sardonic in his grievances, as when he complains
that all he got in return for the money he gave for the souls in
purgatory were the fleas and lice that all but devoured him alive
in the prison of Astorga; or that all the recompense he enjoyed
for having presented the Church with a holy-water font was to be
subjected to the water-torture by "that dog of a doctor in
Astorga."</p>
<p>He vows that he will die a Jew, though he should be burnt
alive. He inveighs bitterly against the inquisitors, dubbing them
Antichrists, and Torquemada the greatest Antichrist of all; and
he alludes derisively to what he terms the frauds and
buffooneries of the Church.</p>
<p>It was from Benito that Yucé, to his surprise, received news
of his father's arrest and of the fact that Ça Franco lies in
that same prison of Avila. He was informed of this during their
first talk, when Benito reproved his music.</p>
<p>"Don't thrum that guitar," Benito had said, "but take pity on
your father who is here and whom the inquisitors have promised to
burn."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 32 et seq.]</p>
<p>In the course of another later conversation between the
prisoners Yucé asks Benito what has brought about the latter's
arrest. And when Benito has related the happening in the inn at
Astorga, Yucé questions him on the subject of the consecrated
wafer&mdash;and his questions certainly betray the fact that the
young Jew had previous knowledge of it and generally of the
affair that was afoot. He becomes so importunate in his questions
that Benito&mdash;perhaps finding them awkward to answer without
betraying the extent to which he has incriminated his
associates&mdash;sharply bids Yucé to leave the matter alone,
assuring him at the same time that he has never mentioned Yucé's
name to the inquisitors.</p>
<p><a id="pic-13" name="pic-13"></a><br></p>
<div align="center"><img src=

"Illustration" title="Illustration"></div>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center">SANBENITO OF PENITENT ADMITTED TO
RECONCILIATION<br>
From Limborch's "Historia Inquisitionis."</p>
<p>At first glance this statement appears untrue. But it is
obvious that Benito means that he has never mentioned Yucé's name
in connection with the Host or in any other way that could
incriminate him. And in this he is truthful enough as far as he
knows, for he could not suppose that what he had said about his
own offences against the Faith committed in Yucé's house at
Tenbleque could in any way be construed against the lad or his
father.</p>
<p>Passing on to other matters, they refer to a certain widow of
La Guardia, of whom Benito says that he knows her to be a
Judaizer, because she never ate anything containing lard or ham,
and he has frequently seen her eat <i>adafinas</i> (the Jewish
food prepared on the Friday for the Sabbath) and drink
<i>Caser</i> wine.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 46.]</p>
<p>In the <i>dossier</i> of Yucé Franco there are no depositions
of the spy set to overhear his conversations with Benito. But it
is probable that some such depositions will be found in the
record of the trial of the latter, where they must belong, since
from the frankness which he used he incriminated himself to an
extraordinary degree and Yucé not at all. And it is not to be
doubted that the inquisitors made use of information thus
obtained when they came to examine Yucé Franco on April 9 and 10*
and in a subsequent examination of August 1,** when they drew
from him a deposition which embodies all the foregoing.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 32.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** <i>Ibid</i>. p. 46.]</p>
<p>On the margin of the last of these depositions there is a note
drawing attention to what was said by Benito concerning the widow
of La Guardia, which shows that the inquisitors do not intend
that this piece of chance information shall be wasted.</p>
<p>Acting no doubt upon the report of the spy, and having at last
obtained information upon which they could go to work, the
inquisitors, Villada and Lopes, accompanied by their notary, pay
Yucé Franco a surprise visit in his cell on the morning of
Saturday, April 9. Having obtained his ratification of what he
has already deponed at Segovia and in this prison of Avila, they
draw from him by vague and subtle questionings the following
additions to those admissions:</p>
<p>About three years ago he was told by a Hebrew physician, named
Yucé Tazarte, since deceased, that the latter had begged Benito
Garcia to obtain him a consecrated wafer, and that Benito had
stolen the keys of the church of La Guardia and so contrived to
obtain a Host; that in consequence of that theft, Benito was
arrested&mdash;upon suspicion, we suppose&mdash;two years ago
last Christmas (i.e. 1488), and detained in prison for two
days.</p>
<p>Tazarte told Yucé that the wafer was required "to make a cord
with certain knots," which cord, together with a letter, Tazarte
gave the witness for delivery to the Rabbi Peres of Toledo, with
which request Yucé had complied.</p>
<p>But beyond this, he adds, he has no knowledge of what became
of the Host, nor did Tazarte tell him; and that not only Tazarte,
but also Benito Garcia, Mosé Franco&mdash;his own brother, since
deceased&mdash;and Alonso Franco of La Guardia, were mixed up in
the affair, according to what had been related by Mosé to his
wife Jamila. In this last particular he presently corrected
himself: it was not, he says upon reflection, to Jamila that Mosé
had related this, but to Yucé himself.</p>
<p>It is a curious statement, and would no doubt be made in
answer to the trend of the questions set him as to what he knew
of a certain Host that had been used for purposes of magic. And
there is reason to believe that&mdash;as we shall see
presently&mdash;Yucé was deliberately lying, in the hope of
putting the inquisitors off the scent of the real affair.</p>
<p>But it is noteworthy that in this, as in other depositions, he
is careful to betray no Jews whom his evidence can hurt. His
brother and Tazarte are dead; Alonso and Benito Garcia are
already under arrest, and the latter has admitted to Yucé that he
has already said enough to burn him. Moreover, they are
Christians&mdash;having received baptism&mdash;and their betrayal
cannot be to Yucé as serious a matter as would that of a faithful
Jew. Particularly is this emphasized by his retraction of what he
had said concerning the slight connection of his sister-in-law
Jamila with the affair, having perhaps bethought him that even so
little might incriminate her&mdash;as undoubtedly it would have
done.</p>
<p>The inquisitors withdraw, obviously dissatisfied, and later on
that same day they order Yucé to be brought before them in the
audience-chamber. There they recommence their questions, and they
succeed in extracting from him a considerable portion of what
passed between him and Benito in prison&mdash;matters of which,
beyond all doubt, they would be already fully informed.</p>
<p>Twice on the following day, which was Sunday, was he haled
before their Reverend Paternities. At the first audience his
statement of yesterday is read over to him, and when he has
ratified it he is again pressed with stealthy questions to add a
little more of what passed in those conversations with Benito.
But in the course of the second examination on that Sunday, Yucé
is at last induced or betrayed into supplying the inquisitors
with information nearer their requirements.</p>
<p>He says that four years ago he was told by his brother Mosé
that the latter, with Tazarte, Alonso Franco, Juan Franco, Garcia
Franco, and Benito Garcia had obtained a consecrated wafer, and
that by certain incantations they were to contrive that the
justice of the Christians and the inquisitors should not have
power to touch them. Mosé invited him to join in the affair, but
he refused to do so, having no inclination, and being, moreover,
on his way to Murcia at the time. And he knows, from what Mosé
told him, that about two years ago the same men repeated the same
enchantment with the same Host.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. pp. 30-38.]</p>
<p>We do not know whether Yucé is now left in peace for a whole
month, but we cannot suppose it. And we have to explain the
absence of any report of an examination during that period by the
assumption that whatever examinations did take place were
entirely fruitless and brought no fresh particulars to light. As
the <i>dossier</i> does not anywhere contain a single record of a
fruitless examination, this assumption&mdash;although we admit
its negative character&mdash;does not seem unreasonable.</p>
<p>Anyway, on May 7 it is Yucé himself who begs to be taken
before the inquisitors to tell them that he remembers having
asked Mosé where he and his associates assembled to do what they
did, so that the wives of the latter&mdash;who were Christian
women&mdash;should have no knowledge of the affair, and Mosé had
answered him that they assembled in the caves between Dosbarrios
and La Guardia, on the road to Ocaña.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>.]</p>
<p>It is difficult to suppose such a statement to be entirely
spontaneous as following upon depositions made a month earlier.
Much rather does it appear to be the result of some fruitless
questionings such as we suggest may have taken place in the
interval. Similarly we assume that the examinations steadily
continue, but another month passes before we get the next
recorded one, and this&mdash;on June 9*&mdash;contains a really
important admission.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 31.]</p>
<p>He says that <i>he doesnt remember whether</i> he has
mentioned that some four years ago, being ill at Tenbleque and
the physician Tazarte having come to bleed him, he overheard a
conversation between his brother and Tazarte, from which he
learnt that the latter, together with the Francos of La Guardia,
had performed an enchantment with a Host and the heart of a
Christian boy, by virtue of which the inquisitors could take no
proceedings against them in any way, or, if they did, the
inquisitors themselves would die.</p>

<p>His statement that he doesn't remember whether he had
mentioned a matter of so grave a character is either a foolish
attempt to simulate guilelessness, or else, in itself, it
suggests a bewildered state of mind resulting from the
multiplication of examinations in which this matter of the heart
of a Christian boy&mdash;contained, as we know, in Guevára's
indictment&mdash;has been persistently thrust forward.</p>
<p>He is asked whether he heard tell whence they procured the
Host, and where they killed the boy to obtain the heart. But he
denies having overheard anything, or having otherwise obtained
any knowledge of these particulars.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>We have seen Eymeric's prescription for visiting a prisoner
and assuring him that the inquisitors will pardon him if he makes
a frank and full confession of his crime and of all that is known
to him of the crimes of others. Although it is not positively
indicated, there is reason to suppose from what follows that this
course was now being pursued in the case of Yucé Franco. To play
the part of the necessary mediator, the inquisitors have at hand
the gaoler who must have been on friendly terms with the
prisoner, having contrived for him a means of communication with
Benito at the time when the latter had occupied the cell
immediately beneath Yucé's. That Benito no longer occupies this
cell may safely be assumed; for having served his turn, he would
of course be removed again.</p>
<p>Whatever the steps that were taken to bring it about, on July
19&mdash;a little over a year after his arrest&mdash;Yucé is
brought before Villada and Lopes,* at his own request, for the
purpose of making certain additions to <i>what he has already
deponed</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 39.]</p>
<p>He begins by begging their Paternities to forgive him for not
having earlier confessed all that he knew, protesting that such
is now his intention, provided that they will pass him their word
assuring him of pardon and immunity for himself and his father
for all errors committed.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "E que lo diesen palabra e seguro de
perdón e seguridad de todos sus errores e de su persona e de su
padre."]</p>
<p>It certainly seems that without previous assurance that some
such consideration was intended towards him, he would never have
ventured to prefer a request of this nature, at once
incriminating&mdash;since it admitted his possession of knowledge
hitherto withheld&mdash;and impudent in its assumption that such
information would be purchased at the price he named.</p>
<p>The inquisitors benignly answered him that they agreed to do
so upon the understanding that in all he should tell them the
entire truth, and they warned him that they would soon be able
more or less to perceive whether he was telling the truth.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Que les plasia con tanto que en todo
dixiese enteramente la verdad, porque ellos bien conoscerian poco
más ó menos si la diria."]</p>
<p>(This pretence of being already fully informed is the ruse
counselled by Eymeric to persuade the person under examination of
the futility of resorting to subterfuge.)</p>
<p>Reassured by this answer, and deluded no doubt by the apparent
promise of pardon conditional upon a full confession, Yucé begins
by offering, as an apology for his past silence upon the matters
he is about to relate, the statement that this has been due to an
oath which he swore not to divulge anything until he should have
been in prison for a year.</p>
<p>Thereupon he is sworn in the Jewish manner to speak the entire
truth without fraud or evasions or concealment of anything known
by him to concern the Holy Office of the Inquisition, and he
addresses himself to the task of amplifying and rectifying what
he has previously said.</p>
<p>His confession is that once some three years ago he had been
in a cave situated a little way back from the road that runs from
La Guardia to Dosbarrios, on the right-hand side as you go
towards the latter place, and midway between the two villages.
There were present, in addition to himself, his father, Ça
Franco, his brother Mosé, since deceased, the physician Yucé
Tazarte and one David Perejon&mdash;both deceased&mdash;Benito
Garcia, Juan de Ocaña, and the four Francos of La
Guardia&mdash;Juan, Alonso, Lope, and Garcia.</p>
<p>Alonso Franco had shown him a heart, which he said had been
cut out of a Christian boy, and from its condition Yucé judged
that this had been lately done. Further, Alonso had shown him a
wafer, which he said was consecrated. This wafer and the heart
Alonso enclosed together in a wooden box which he delivered to
Tazarte, and the latter took these things apart, saying that he
went to perform an enchantment so that the inquisitors could not
hurt any of them, or, if they attempted to do so, they must
themselves go mad and die within a year.</p>
<p>At this point the inquisitors interpolate two questions:</p>
<p>"Does he know whence the Host was obtained?"</p>
<p>"Does he know whether they sacrificed any boy to procure the
heart?"</p>
<p>His answer to the first is in the negative&mdash;he has no
knowledge.</p>
<p>To the second question he replies that he remembers hearing
Alonso Franco state that he and some of his brothers crucified a
Christian boy whose heart this was.</p>
<p>Resuming his statement, he says that some two years ago all
the above-mentioned assembled again between La Guardia and
Tenbleque, and that on this occasion it was agreed to send a
consecrated wafer to Mosé Abenamias of Zamora, and that such a
Host was delivered to Benito Garcia enclosed in parchment tied
with red silk. This, Benito was to take to Abenamias, together
with a letter which had first been written in Hebrew, but
which&mdash;lest this should excite suspicion in the event of the
letter's being discovered&mdash;was replaced by another one
written in Romance.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The interpretation to place upon this seems to be that, doubts
having arisen as to the efficacy of the enchantments performed by
Tazarte, it was deemed expedient to have recourse to a magician
of greater repute, and to send a consecrated wafer to Abenamias
in Zamora, that he might accomplish with it the desired
sorcery.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The inquisitors press Yucé to say whether he knows if Benito
did actually deliver the wafer to Abenamias. He replies that he
doesn't know what Benito did with it; but that he has been told
by Benito [in the course of their conversations in the prison of
Avila] that he went upon a journey to Santiago, and that in
passing through Astorga he was arrested by order of Dr. Villada,
who was the provisor there at the time.</p>
<p>As for the heart, he doesn't know what happened to it; but he
beUeves that it remained in the possession of Tazarte, who
performed his enchantments with it.</p>
<p>Questioned as to who was the leading spirit in the affair, he
replies that Tazarte invited him together with his father and his
brother Mosé, and that they all went together to the cave, whilst
he believes that the Christians (i.e. Ocaña, the Francos, and
Benito Garcia) and David Perejon from La Guardia were also
summoned by Tazarte.</p>
<p>Finally he is asked whether Tazarte received any money for his
sorceries, and whether Benito Garcia was paid to convey the Host
to Zamora; and he answers that money was given by Alonso Franco
to Tazarte, and that Benito too would be paid for his
trouble.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>From a ratification on the next day (July 20) of a confession
made by the octogenarian Ça Franco, it becomes clear that
immediately upon dismissing Yucé, his father was introduced into
the audiencechamber for examination.</p>
<p>The inquisitors are now possessed of the information that Ça
was present in the cave when Alonso Franco produced the heart of
a Christian child. Working upon this and upon the other details
obtained from Yucé, they would now be able, by a clever parade of
these&mdash;and a seemingly intentional reticence as to the
rest&mdash;convincingly to feign the fullest and completest
knowledge of the affair. Thus does the "Directorium" enjoin the
inquisitor to conduct his examination.</p>
<p>Believing that all is betrayed, and that further concealment
will, therefore, be worse than useless, Ça at last speaks out. He
not only confirms all that his son has already admitted, but he
adds a great deal more. He confesses that he himself, his two
sons and the other Jews and Christians mentioned, assembled in a
cave on the right-hand side of the road that runs from La Guardia
to Dosbarrios, and he says that some of them brought thither a
Christian boy who was there crucified upon two timbers
rectangularly crossed, to which they bound him. Before proceeding
to do this, the boy was stripped by the Christians, who whipped
and otherwise vituperated him.</p>
<p>He protests that he, himself, took no part in this beyond
being present and witnessing all that was done. Pressed as to
what part was taken by his son Yucé, he admits that he saw the
latter give the boy a light push or blow.</p>
<p>It is to this mention of Yucé that we owe the inclusion in the
present <i>dossier</i> of this extract from Ca's ratification of
his confession, which reveals to us so clearly the method pursued
by the tribunal.</p>
<p>Çaa is removed, and Yucé is forthwith brought back again.
Questions recommence, shaped now upon the further information
gained, and betraying enough of the extent of that information to
compel Yucé to amplify his admissions.</p>
<p>No doubt they would question him directly upon the matter of
the crucifixion of the boy, insisting upon this&mdash;now the
main charge&mdash;and depending upon Yucé's replies to supply
them with further details than they already possess, so as to
enable them to probe still deeper.</p>
<p>Unable to persist in denial in the face of so much obvious
knowledge on the part of his questioners, Yucé admits having
witnessed the actual crucifixion in the cave some three or four
years ago. He says (as his father had said) that it was the
Christians who crucified the child, and that they whipped him,
struck him, spat upon him, and crowned him with thorns.</p>
<p>So far he merely confirms what is already known. But now he
adds to the sum of that knowledge. He states that Alonso Franco
opened the veins of the boy's arms and left him to bleed for over
half an hour, gathering the blood in a cauldron and a jar; that
Juan Franco drew a Bohemian knife (i.e. a curved knife) and
thrust it into the boy's side, and that Garcia Franco took out
the heart and sprinkled it with salt.</p>
<p>He admits that all who were present took part in what was
done, and he is able to indicate the precise part played by each,
with the exception of his father: he doesn't remember having seen
his father do anything beyond just standing there while all this
was going on; and Yucé reminds the inquisitors that his father is
a very old man of over eighty years of age, whose sight is so
feeble that he couldn't so much as see clearly what was being
done.</p>
<p>When the child was dead, he continues, they took him down from
the cross. (They untied him, he says.) Juan Franco seized his
arms, and Garcia Franco his legs, and thus they bore him out of
the cave. Yucé didn't see where they took him, but he heard Juan
Franco and Garcia Franco informing Tazarte that they had buried
him in a ravine by the river Escorchon.</p>
<p>The heart remained in the possession of Alonso until their
next meeting in the cave, when he gave it, together with the
consecrated wafer, to Tazarte.</p>
<p>"Did this," they ask him, "take place by day or by night?"</p>
<p>"By night," he answers, "by the light of candles of white wax;
and a cloak was hung over the mouth of the cave that the light
might not be seen outside."</p>
<p>He is desired to say when precisely was this; but all that he
can answer is that he thinks it was in Lent, just before Easter,
three or four years ago.</p>
<p>They ask whether he had heard any rumours of the loss of a
child at about that time in that district, and he says that he
heard rumours of a child lost in Lillo and another in La Guardia;
the latter had gone to a vineyard with his uncle, and had never
been seen again. But he adds that, in any case, the Francos came
and went between La Guardia and Murcia, and that on one of their
journeys they might easily have found a child and carried it off,
because they had sardine barrels in their carts, and some of
those would be empty&mdash;by which he means that they could have
concealed the child in one of these barrels.</p>
<p>Urged to give still further details, he protests that he can
remember no more at present, but promises to inform the court if
he does succeed in recalling anything else.</p>
<p>He is dismissed upon that with an injunction from Dr.
Villada&mdash;which may have been backed by a promise or a
threat&mdash;to reflect and to confess all that he knows to be
the business of the Holy Office concerning himself or any
others.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-22" name="ch-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII. THE TRIAL OF
Yucé FRANCO (Continued)</h2>
<p>It is not difficult to conjecture with what fresh energies the
court&mdash;armed with such information as it now
possessed&mdash;proceeded to re-examine the other seven prisoners
accused of complicity in the crime of La Guardia, pressing each
with the particular share he was himself alleged to have borne in
the affair, and continuing to play off one accused against
another.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that the records of these proceedings should
not at present be available, so that all conjecture might be
dispensed with in reconstructing step by step this extraordinary
case. And it is to be hoped that M. Fidel Fita's expectations
that these records will ultimately be brought to light may come
to be realized.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>A week later, on July 28, Yucé is again brought into the
audience-chamber for further examination. But he has nothing more
to add on the subject of the actual crime. All that he has
contrived to remember in the interval are scraps of conversation
that took place when the culprits assembled&mdash;on that later
occasion&mdash;for the purpose of sending the consecrated wafer
to Abenamias. Nevertheless, what he says is, from the point of
view of the inquisitors, as damaging to those who uttered the
things which he repeats as their actual participation in the
crucifixion of the boy, and it is hardly less damaging to Yucé
himself, since it shows him to have been a <i>fautor</i>, or
abettor of heretics&mdash;a circumstance which he may very well
entirely have failed to appreciate.</p>
<p>He depones that Alonso Franco had said that the letter they
were dispatching to Abenamias was better than the letters and
bulls [of indulgence] that came from Rome and were offered for
sale. Ocaña agreed by launching an imprecation upon all who
should spend money on such bulls, denouncing such things as sheer
humbug (<i>todo es burla</i>), and protesting that there is no
saviour other than God. But Garcia Franco reproved him with the
reminder that it was good policy to buy one now and then, as it
gave them the appearance of being good Catholics.</p>
<p>On this same subject of appearances, Alonso grumbled at the
trouble to which they were put by the fact of their being married
to Old-Christian women who would not even permit the circumcision
of their children.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Three days later Yucé has remembered that it was Benito who
crowned the child with thorns. He is again questioned as to what
he knows about the boy, and he admits having heard Tazarte say
that the child was obtained "from a place whence it would never
be missed."</p>
<p>They press him further on the subject, but he can only repeat
what he has already said&mdash;that as the Francos travel a great
deal with their carts, they may have found the boy on one of
their journeys.</p>
<p>As no more is to be extracted from him on the subject, they
now change the line of examination, and seek information
concerning other Judaizing practices of the Francos of La
Guardia, asking Yucé what he knows upon this matter.</p>
<p>He answers that about six years ago the Francos, to his own
knowledge, kept the Feast of the Tabernacles and gave the beggar
Perejon money to buy a trumpet which was to be sounded on the
seventh day of the feast, as is proper. He knows, further, that
they sit down to meat prepared in the Jewish manner, over which
they utter Jewish prayers&mdash;the <i>Berakà</i> and the
<i>Hamoçi</i>&mdash;and that they are beheved to have kept the
great fast and to give money for the purchase of oil for the
synagogue.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 26.]</p>
<p>Asked further to explain the oath of secrecy which he says was
imposed upon him and to which he has said that his past silence
has been due, he states that all were solemnly sworn by Tazarte
that under no circumstances would they utter a word of what was
done in the cave between Dosbarrios and La Guardia until they
should have been one year in the prison of the Inquisition, and
that even should the torture betray them into infidelity to their
oath, they must refuse to ratify afterwards, and deny what they
might have divulged.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>M. Isidore Loeb clung so tenaciously to the theory that the
affair of the "Santo Niño" was trumped up by Torquemada that he
would not permit his convictions to be shaken by the revelations
contained in these records of Yucé's trial when they came to
light. He fastens upon this statement of Yucé's and denounces
such an oath as a flagrant absurdity, concluding thence that
here, as elsewhere, Yucé is lying.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Revue des Etudes Juives," vol. xv. p.
232.]</p>
<p>M. Loeb's criticisms of this <i>dossier</i> are worthy of too
much attention to be lightly passed over, and we shall return
presently to the consideration of them.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile we may permit ourselves a digression here to
consider just this point upon which he bases so much argument for
the purpose of proving false the rest of the story.</p>
<p>If we were to agree with M. Loeb that Yucé is lying in this
instance, that would still prove nothing as to the rest&mdash;and
it would be very far from proving that Torquemada is the inventor
of the whole affair. Assuming that this tale of an oath of
silence to endure for one year after arrest is a falsehood, it
may very well be urged that it is employed by Yucé in the hope
that it will excuse his having hitherto withheld information and
that it will induce the inquisitors to deal leniently with him
for that same silence. Let it be observed that he prefaces his
confession with that excuse at the time of asking the inquisitors
to give him an undertaking that they will pardon him if he
divulges all that he knows.</p>
<p>But is he really lying?</p>
<p>It seems to us that in arriving at this conclusion, M. Loeb
has either overlooked or else not sufficiently weighed the
following statement in Yucé's confession: "<i>Yucé Tazarte...went
to perform an enchantment so that the inquisitors could not hurt
any of them, or if they attempted to do so they must, themselves,
go mad and die</i> within a year." This means, of course, within
a year of attempting to hurt any of them, which again means
<i>within a year of the arrest of any of them</i>.</p>
<p>Now, the fact of our not believing to-day in the efficacy of
Tazarte's incantations and in the power of his magic spells with
the heart and the Host to accomplish the things he promised, is
no reason to suppose that Tazarte himself was not firmly
persuaded that his enchantments would take effect. Indeed, he and
his associates must firmly have believed it, or they would never
have gone the length of imperilling their lives in so dangerous a
business.</p>
<p>Tazarte's belief was that these sorceries would invest them
all with an immunity from inquisitorial persecution, and that
should any inquisitors attempt to violate that immunity, such
inquisitors must go mad and die within a year of arresting any of
Tazarte's associates. Therefore in the event of arrest, all that
would be necessary to procure ultimate deliverance would be
stubbornly to withhold from the inquisitors all information on
the subject of this enchantment until the period within which it
was to work should have expired.</p>
<p>When this is sufficiently considered, it seems to us that such
an oath as Yucé says was imposed by Tazarte becomes not only
likely but absolutely inevitable. Some such oath must have been
imposed to ensure the efficacy of the enchantment in the event of
the arrest of any of them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to think that Tazarte was a mere charlatan
performing this business with his tongue in his cheek for the
sake of the money he could extract from his dupes; difficult,
because he was dealing with comparatively poor people, from whom
the remuneration to be obtained would be out of all proportion to
the risk incurred. But even if we proceed upon that assumption,
are we not to conclude that, being a deliberate charlatan,
Tazarte would be at great pains to appear sincere and to impose
an oath which he must have imposed if he were sincere?<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>It is rather singular and it seems to ask some explanation,
which it is not in our power to afford, that not until now do the
inquisitors make any use of that grave admission of Yucé's to the
supposed Rabbi Abraham in Segovia. It is true that it was
extremely vague, but in Ça's admissions of July 19&mdash; if not
before&mdash;they had obtained the connecting link required.</p>
<p>But not until September 16, when they pay Yucé a visit in his
cell, do they touch upon the matter. They then ask him whether he
recollects having talked when under arrest in Segovia, upon
matters concerning the Inquisition, and with whom.</p>
<p>His answer certainly seems to show that even now he has no
suspicion that the "Rabbi Abraham" was an emissary of the Holy
Office. He says that being sick in prison and believing that he
was about to die, he asked the physician who tended him to beg
the inquisitors to allow him to be visited by a Jew to pray with
him, and his further admissions as to what passed between himself
and the "Rabbi" entirely corroborate the depositions of Frey
Alonso Enriquez and the physician Antonio de Avila.</p>
<p>The inquisitors ask him to explain the three Hebrew words he
used on that occasion: <i>mita</i>, <i>nahar</i>, and
<i>Otohays</i>. He replies that they referred to the crucifixion
of the boy, as related by him in his confession.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. 52.]</p>
<p>At this stage it would almost seem to transpire that Benito's
admissions under torture at Astorga, when, as he has said, he
admitted enough to burn him, must have been confined to matters
concerning the Host found upon him, and that until now he has
said nothing about the crucifixion of the boy.</p>
<p>This assumption is one that deepens the mysterious parts of
the affair rather than elucidates them, for it leaves us without
the faintest indication of how the Fiscal Guevára was able to
incorporate in his indictment nine months ago the particulars of
"enchantments with the said Host and heart of a Christian
boy."</p>
<p>From what Benito has said to Yucé in prison we might be
justified in supposing that the former is the delator; but in
view of the turn now taken by the proceedings this supposition
seems to become untenable. It is of course possible that the
particulars in question may have been wrung out of one of the
other prisoners, or it is possible that Benito himself may have
confessed and afterwards refused to ratify. But beyond indicating
these possibilities we cannot go.</p>
<p>The fact remains that on September 24 the inquisitors found it
necessary to put Benito Garcia to torture that they might obtain
his evidence relating to the crucifixion.</p>
<p>And on the rack he confesses that he and Yucé Franco and the
others crucified a boy in one of the caves on the road to
Villapalomas on a cross made of a beam and the axle of a cart
lashed together with a rope of hemp; that first they tied the boy
to the cross and then nailed his hands and feet to it; and that
as the boy was screaming they strangled or stifled him (<i>lo
ahogaron</i>); that all was done at night, by the light of a
candle which Benito himself had procured from Santa Maria de la
Pera; that the mouth of the cave was covered with a cloak, so
that the light should not be seen outside; that the boy was
whipped with a strap and crowned with thorns&mdash;all in mockery
and vituperation of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that they took the
body away and buried it in a vineyard near Santa Maria de la
Pera.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 55.]</p>
<p>There are some slight discrepancies between the details of the
affair afforded by Benito and those given by Yucé. The latter has
not mentioned that the child's hands and feet were nailed to the
cross; according to him they were merely tied. Nor has he said
that the boy was strangled; his statement seems to be that the
child was bled to death, as a consequence of opening the veins of
his arms&mdash;a matter which Benito does not mention. But on the
score of the strangling, it is possible that by the word
employed&mdash;<i>ahogaron</i>&mdash;Benito merely means that the
boy's cries were stifled, a detail which would be confirmed by
Yucé's statement that the child was gagged.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The prisoners are evidently permitted to learn that Benito has
been tortured. Very possibly they are given the information to
the end that it may strike terror into them and so induce them to
betray themselves without more ado. But it does not seem that
they are very greatly frightened by the prospect of having to
undergo the same suffering, if we are to judge by Garcia Franco.
This prisoner is permitted on the following day (which is
Sunday), by contrivance of the Holy Office, to get into
communication with Yucé. In the course of their conversation
Garcia strongly urges a policy of denial under torture, should
they be subjected to it,* from which it seems plain that he has
no notion of the extent to which Yucé's tongue has been loosened
already.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 50.]</p>
<p>On the following Wednesday it is Juan Franco's turn to be put
to the torture.</p>
<p>Under it he gives a general confirmation of what has already
been extracted from the others. He confesses that he and Yucé
Franco and the other Christians and Jews crucified a boy in the
cave of Carre Ocaña, which is on the right going from La Guardia
to Ocaña; that they crucified him on a cross made of two beams of
olive-wood lashed together by a rope of hemp; that they whipped
him with a rope; and that Yucé was present when the deponent
himself cut out the boy's heart&mdash;as is more fully contained
in the deponent's confession (of which, again, this is no more
than an extract relating to Yucé's share in the crime). He states
that an enchantment was performed with the heart, so that the
Inquisition might not proceed against them.</p>
<p>This confession was duly ratified upon the morrow.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 52.]</p>
<p>On the Friday of the same week they torture Juan de Ocaña and
extract from him a confession that is, in the main, in agreement
with those already obtained. He relates how he and the others
crucified a boy in the caves of Carre Ocaña; that they whipped
him with ropes when he was crucified; that they cut out his heart
and caught his blood in a cauldron; that it was night and that
they had a light; and that when they took the body down they
buried it near Santa Maria de la Pera, as fully set forth in his
confession.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>.]</p>
<p>As a consequence of his having in the course of this
confession spoken of the Host that was sent to Zamora for
delivery to Abenamias, Ocaña is questioned again&mdash;on October
1 1&mdash;touching this particular. He is asked how he knows that
this was done. He replies that he heard Alonso Franco and the
Jews&mdash;i.e. Ça Franco and his sons (Yucé and Mosé), Tazarte
and Perejon&mdash;say that such was the intention, but he doesn't
know whether the Host was actually delivered or otherwise
disposed of.</p>
<p>The persistence with which this apparently trivial question
arises&mdash;particularly when it is remembered that the
inquisitors were, themselves, in possession of the Host found
upon Benito at the time of his arrest&mdash;leads us to suppose
that they were probing to discover whether this consecrated wafer
was the identical one dispatched upon the occasion to which the
confessions refer. Considering the lapse of time between the
dispatch of that wafer and Benito's arrest, they may reasonably
have been concluding that the Host found upon the latter relates
to some similar, later affair. Such an impression is confirmed by
the fact that no letter&mdash;such as was addressed to Abenamias
&mdash;had been discovered upon Benito.</p>
<p>The question again crops up in an examination to which Yucé is
submitted on that same day.</p>
<p>"Did any of the Jews or Christians," he is asked, "go to
Zamora to Abenamias in this matter?"</p>
<p>He answers precisely as he has answered before: that he
doesn't know what became of the Host beyond the fact that he saw
them dispatching it together with a letter to the said Abenamias,
as deponed, and that all were present when this took place.</p>
<p>They seek to learn who was the instigator of the affair, but
Yucé cannot answer with certainty on that point. What he knows he
tells them&mdash;that Tazarte meeting him when he was on his way
to Murcia, the physician asked him would he join in a matter to
be performed with a consecrated wafer to ensure that the
Inquisition could not harm the Christians in question. Before
they met to crucify the boy, Tazarte told the deponent and his
brother Mosé that he had arranged for it; and although Yucé
protests that he had no inclination to have anything to do with
the affair, he and his brother allowed themselves in the end to
be persuaded to be present, and they went with Tazarte that same
night to the cave. There they were joined by the Christians, who
brought the child with them.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>So far, it will be seen, the evidence collected from Yucé's
fellow-prisoners, whilst admitting that he had been present in
the cave when the boy was crucified-an admission in itself grave
enough and quite sufficient to procure his being abandoned to the
secular arm&mdash;did not charge him with any active
participation in the proceedings. In his own depositions Yucé had
insisted that he and his father had been no more than spectators
and that they had gone to the cave more or less in ignorance, as
if hardly understanding what they were to witness.</p>
<p>Moreover before relating the happenings in that cave of Carre
Ocaña, Yucé had made a sort of bargain with the inquisitors that
his confession should not be used against himself or his father.
And it is noteworthy that the other Jews whom he incriminated
were all dead, and that he suppressed the name of the only
surviving Jew&mdash;Hernando de Ribera&mdash;who had taken part
in the affair. Of betraying the New-Christians he would, as we
have already said, have less concern, as these by their apostasy
must have become more or less contemptible in the sight of a
faithful Jew.</p>
<p>Whether the inquisitors conceived that in view of his
passivity in the matter, combined with the promise they had made
him before obtaining his confession, they were not justified in
proceeding to extremes with him, we do not know. It is difficult
to suppose any such hesitation on their part. Whatever their
object, it is fairly clear that they did not account themselves
satisfied yet, and for the purpose of probing this matter to the
very bottom they now adopted a fresh method of procedure which
appears particularly to aim at the further incrimination of
Yucé.</p>
<p>Just as the court was in the habit of suppressing evidence
entirely or in part, or the names of witnesses, when this course
best served its purposes, so, when the depositions were obtained
from co-accused, there must obviously come a moment when the
publication of the evidence and of the witnesses by confrontation
must further the aims of the tribunal.</p>
<p>The anger aroused in each prisoner by the discovery that his
betrayer is one of his associates must spur him to reprisals, and
drive him to admit anything he may hitherto have concealed. There
is, of course, the danger that he may be urged to embark upon
inventions to damage in his turn the man who has destroyed him.
But inquisitorial justice was not deterred by any such
consideration. Pegna&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;tells us plainly
enough that the point of view of the Holy Office was that it was
better that an innocent man should perish than that a guilty one
should escape.</p>
<p>In pursuit of this policy, then, Benito Garcia is brought
before the inquisitors on October 12, and he is asked whether in
the matter of the crucifixion and the Host he will repeat in the
presence of any of the participators in the crime what he has
already deponed. He replies in the affirmative. Thereupon he is
taken out. Yucé Franco is introduced and asked the same question
with the same result. Benito is brought in again, and, the two
being confronted, each repeats in the presence of the other the
confession he has already made.</p>
<p>They are now asked whether they will repeat these statements
once more, in the presence of Juan de Ocaña, and they announce
themselves ready to do so. They are removed. Ocaña is introduced,
and having similarly obtained his agreement to repeat before
others whom he has accused of complicity what he has already
confessed, the inquisitors order the other two to be brought
back.</p>
<p>The notary records that they actually manifest pleasure at
seeing one another.</p>
<p>Ocaña now repeats his confession, and Yucé and Benito again go
over theirs. The three agree one with the other, and it is now
further eUcited that it was six months after the crucifixion,
more or less, when they assembled between Tenbleque and La
Guardia to give Benito the letter and the Host which he was to
convey to Abenamias in Zamora.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>On October 17 there is another confrontation&mdash;of Juan
Franco with Ça and Yucé Franco. In this each repeats what he has
already confessed, which we now learn for the first time. Juan
Franco admits that it was he himself who opened the boy's side
and took out his heart, and in this as in other particulars the
depositions agree one with another.</p>
<p>Juan Franco goes on to say that they next met in the cave some
time after the crucifixion, and that his brother Alonso brought
the heart and the Host in a box which he gave to Tazarte, who
withdrew with them to a corner of the cave to carry out his
enchantments. Later on they assembled between Tenbleque and La
Guardia&mdash;at a place which, according to this witness, was
called Sorrostros&mdash;and gave Benito a letter to take to
Zamora, this letter being tied with a coloured thread.</p>
<p>So far he is completely in accord with the other deponents;
but now there occurs a startling discrepancy. He says that at
this last meeting (which, we are told, took place some six months
after the crucifixion), in addition to the consecrated wafer and
the letter for Abenamias, they also gave Benito the heart to take
to Zamora.</p>
<p>Now all the other depositions lead us to suppose that the
heart and the first wafer were employed&mdash;presumably consumed
in some way&mdash;by Tazarte in the enchantment performed at the
first meeting after the crucifixion, and that as doubts
afterwards arose touching the efficacy of the spells performed by
the physician, another Host was obtained some six months later,
which they forwarded to Zamora.</p>
<p>Is the explanation the simple one that Juan Franco is mistaken
on the subject of the heart? It seems possible, because he adds
that he did not actually see the Host (on this particular
occasion), but that he understood that it was given to Benito.
Similarly he may have understood&mdash;erroneously taking it for
granted&mdash;that the heart accompanied it.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>And now you may see the confrontation bearing fruit, and
yielding the results which we must suppose are sought by the
inquisitors&mdash;the further incrimination of Yucé Franco.</p>
<p>Juan de Ocaña is examined again on October 20 and questioned
as to Yucé's participation in the crime. He now adds to his
former confession that Yucé and the others used great
vituperations to the child, which vituperations were really aimed
at Jesus Christ; he cites the expressions, and in the main they
are those we have already quoted from the Testimonio*; these, he
says, were used by Ça Franco and his two sons. He says that they
all whipped the boy, and that it was Yucé himself who drew blood
from the arms of the victim with a knife.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Which was framed upon the sentence
ultimately passed.]</p>
<p>"Whence was the child?" they ask him.</p>
<p>He replies that it was the dead Jew Mosé Franco who had
brought the boy from Quintanar to Tenbleque on a donkey, and
that, according to Moss's story, he was the son of Alonso Martin
of Quintanar.* From Tenbleque several of them, amongst whom were
Yucé and his father, brought him on the donkey to the cave where
he was crucified, and it was Yucé who went to summon the brothers
Franco of La Guardia, Benito Garcia, and the witness himself.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* All this is contradicted by Juan Franco's
later confession that he himself procured the child from Toledo,
and brought him to the cave. The name of the child's father is as
much a fiction as the rest of this vindictive deposition.]</p>
<p>So that from having been a more or less passive spectator of
the scene, Yucé is suddenly&mdash;by what we are justified in
accounting the vindictiveness of Ocaña&mdash;thrust into the
position of one of the chief actors, indeed, almost one of the
instigators of the crime.</p>
<p>On the same day Benito Garcia is re-examined. His former
depositions are read over to him, and he is asked if he has
anything to add to them. He has to add, he finds, that
Yucé&mdash;whom he has hardly mentioned hitherto&mdash;had
whipped and struck the boy, and that he was an active participant
in all that was done, his avowed aim being the destruction of
Christianity, which he spoke of as buffoonery and idolatry.</p>
<p>On the morrow Ocaña is brought back to ratify his statements
of yesterday. He is asked if he has anything to add that concerns
the participation of Yucé, and his answer is so very much in the
terms of the latest additions made by Benito that one is left
wondering whether, departing from their usual custom, the
inquisitors put their questions in a precise and definite
form&mdash;founded upon what Benito has said&mdash;and obtained
affirmative replies from Ocaña. For Ocaña, too, remembers that
Yucé said that Christianity was all buffoonery and that
Christians were idolaters.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-23" name="ch-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII. THE TRIAL OF
YUCÉ FRANCO&mdash;(Concluded)</h2>
<p>It might now be said that, thanks to the patient efforts which
the inquisitors themselves have been exerting for close upon a
year, the prosecutor is at last furnished with the evidence
necessary to support his original charge against Yucé Franco.</p>
<p>To this end he appears before the court on that same October
21, 1 491, to present in proof of his denunciation the entire
<i>dossier</i>, as taken down by the notary of the tribunal. He
begs that Yucé be brought into the audience-chamber to hear the
additions which he has to make to the original charge. These
additions are the matters lately extracted from Ocaña and Benito
Garcia: that Yucé used vituperative words to the child when he
was being crucified, and that these vituperations were really
aimed at our Lord Jesus Christ and His Holy Catholic Faith; that
he struck the boy many times, and that he drew blood from the
boy's arm with a penknife. Wherefore, he begs the inquisitors to
abandon the prisoner to the secular arm, as is right and
proper.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* " Boletin," xi. p. 24, 331]</p>
<p>He does not, however, add that Yucé's brother had procured the
child, and that Yucé was one of those who brought him to the cave
and who summoned the Francos to attend&mdash;an omission which
shows the credit attached to Ocaña's statement and its lack of
corroboration.</p>
<p>Yucé's answer is a denial of all that is alleged and added by
the Fiscal, the lad protesting that he never did or said anything
beyond what he has, himself, confessed.</p>
<p>Guevára, thereupon, petitions the court to permit him to
submit his proofs of the matters of which he accuses the
prisoner, and the court having accorded him this petition, he
puts in as evidence the entire <i>dossier</i> from which we have
drawn these pages on the subject.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 26.]</p>
<p>Five days later both parties are again before the court,
Guevára now petitioning their Reverend Paternities to pass to the
publication of witnesses, that the trial may be brought to its
conclusion. Dr. Villada announces his readiness to do so, but
accords the defendants three days within which to lodge any
objection to any of the matter contained in the depositions.</p>
<p>Yucé begs through his advocate that copies be given him of all
the depositions of those who were present at the crucifixion,
with the name of each hostile witness and a statement of the day,
month, year, and place in which anything alleged against him is
said to have taken place.</p>
<p>But Guevára immediately objects, urging that in the copies of
the depositions to be given defendant, no names shall appear of
any of the witnesses who had deponed, and no circumstances shall
be included which might enable Yucé to conjecture the names. It
seems a purely formal objection; for after the confrontations
there have been it appears to serve very little purpose. But some
purpose it does serve, because those confrontations after all
were limited to Ocaña and Benito, and from the moment that it was
not considered necessary to proceed to confrontation with any of
the other prisoners it would seem that they had needed no such
spur to drive them into depositions hostile to Yucé.</p>
<p>However, the reverend inquisitor replies loftily enough that
he will do what justice demands, and he orders the notary to
deliver to Yucé copies of all the depositions against him. But
from Yucé's advocate's plea on October 29&mdash;upon the expiry
of the three days appointed&mdash;it is plain that the
particulars claimed have been withheld.</p>
<p>From the fact that the advocate San9 has drawn up so strong an
objection on behalf of his client, it is perfectly clear that
even at this date Yucé's guilt of heresy cannot be considered as
established. If that were the case, Sang, in obedience to the
oath imposed upon him when entrusted with the defence, would have
been compelled to lay down his brief and withdraw.</p>
<p>Yucé denies all the allegations against him which charge him
with having taken any active part in the crucifixion of the boy,
and he protests that he is unable properly to defend himself
because the copies of the depositions supplied him do not mention
time or place of the alleged offences nor yet the names of the
witnesses by whom these allegations are made. Upon the
assumption, however, that these deponents are Benito Garcia, Juan
Franco, and Juan de Ocaña, he proceeds to answer the charges as
best he can.</p>
<p>This answer consists of a repudiation of those depositions as
inadmissible upon the grounds that they do not agree one with
another, and that each refers to a separate circumstance, no two
confirming any one particular accusation, and all being contrary
to what the same witnesses had stated in confrontation with the
defendant, when each had acknowledged that Yucé's relation of the
events was the true one. Hence it is established that on one or
the other of these occasions they must have lied, from which it
follows that they are perjured and unworthy of faith.</p>
<p>Further, he claims that they may not be admitted as witnesses
because they were, themselves, participators in the crime
committed. Finally, he declares that their implication of himself
is an act of spite and vengeance upon him. It is his full and
faithful confession which has placed the inquisitors in
possession of the facts of the case and the names of the
offenders, and the latter are determined that since they
themselves must die, Yucé shall die with them&mdash;out of which
malice and enmity they have accused him.</p>
<p>Upon these grounds, and insisting that he has told them the
utter and complete truth, and that he himself was no more than a
witness of the events, and in no way a participator, Yucé bases
his defence, and begs that the depositions should cease to weigh
against him.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 72.]</p>
<p>Guevára's answer, if it inclines to the grotesque, is quite
typical, and is certainly more to the taste of the court.</p>
<p>He denies that the witnesses are inspired by any such
animosity as Yucé suggests, and he asserts that they have deponed
"with devout zeal of faith, and to deliver their souls from
peril." And amongst these, be it remembered, was Benito Garcia,
who conceived that the worst thing he had ever done in his life
had been to get himself baptized a Christian, and who continued
firm in his resolve to die a Jew at all costs. Only at the very
stake itself&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;did he recant again,
that he might earn the mercy of strangulation. Yet Guevára does
not hesitate to say&mdash;what he must know to be
untrue&mdash;that these men have confessed "with devout zeal of
faith."</p>
<p>On these grounds Guevira urges that the depositions must be
admitted as made in good faith and as proof; and since the said
Yucé Franco would not spontaneously confess all that he had done,
their Reverend Paternities should put him to the question of
torture, as by law prescribed in such circumstances as the
present.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 78.]</p>
<p>The court agrees with its Fiscal and proceeds to draw up a
list of fifteen questions to be put to the accused.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Idid. p. 80.]</p>
<p>With this list the inquisitors Villada and Santo Domingo,
accompanied by their notary, go down into the prisons of the
Inquisition on November 2, and order Yucé Franco to be brought
before them.</p>
<p>"Very lovingly and humanely" they admonish him to tell the
whole truth of the things known to him that are the business of
the Holy Office, and particularly in answer to the questions they
have prepared. These questions being summed up amount to the
following: Whence was the child that was crucified? Whose child
was it? Who brought it to the cave? Who first set on foot this
affair?</p>
<p>They promise him that if he makes truthful answer they will
use him as mercifully as the law and their consciences
permit.</p>
<p>Yucé has cause to mistrust any such promises. His first
confession was made three months ago under a promise of pardon,
and he has every reason to suppose that it has been the ruin of
him.</p>
<p>He says, however, that being in the cave on the occasion when
they foregathered there for the enchantment&mdash;about fourteen
days after the crucifixion&mdash;he heard Tazarte Inquire whence
was the child, and Juan Franco replied before all that it was
from a place whence it would never be missed, "as stated in his
confession."</p>
<p>(When last asked this question&mdash;at the time of making his
confession&mdash;he had attributed these words to Tazarte.)</p>
<p>He protests that he can remember no more than he has already
confessed.</p>
<p>Their Reverend Paternities deplore his stubbornness. They tell
him that since he will not speak the entire truth of what he
knows&mdash;as they have proof&mdash;they must proceed to other
measures. They summon Diego Martin, the torturer, and into his
hands they deliver the prisoner, with orders to take him to the
torture-chamber, strip him naked, and bind him to the
<i>escalera</i>&mdash;intending, if necessary, to proceed to the
water-torture.</p>
<p>This is done, and Yucé is stretched naked and cruelly bound
with ropes that bite into his flesh as a foretaste of the
<i>garrote</i> by which his torments will commence. The
inquisitors enter&mdash;possibly after a delay sufficient to
allow the mental torture of anticipation to terrorize the patient
into a more amenable frame of mind.</p>
<p>Again they admonish him for his own sake to speak what he
knows, and they even point out to him that it is his duty as a
God-fearing Jew to speak the truth. Again they promise to deal
mercifully with him if he will answer their questions fully and
truthfully; and lastly they protest that if his blood is shed in
the course of what is to follow, or should he suffer any other
harm, or mutilation of limb, or even death, the blame must fall
entirely upon himself and nowise upon their reverences.</p>
<p>Fully intimidated by this skilful accumulation of terrorizing
agents, Yucé implores them to repeat their questions, which he
will do his best to answer.</p>
<p>"Whence," they ask him again, "was the boy who was crucified
at La Guardia?"</p>
<p>"Juan Franco," he replies, "brought him from Toledo." He adds
that Juan Franco announced this before them all, and told them
that he had kept the child concealed in La Hos de La Guardia for
a day before bringing him to the cave to be crucified.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: center">SANBENITO OF PENITENT RELAPSED<br>
From Limborch's "Historia Inquisitionis."</p>
<p>What is not to be explained is why Yucé should have waited
until he was strapped to the <i>escalera</i> before making this
statement. Why did he not make it when the question was asked him
at his last examination&mdash;if not in his original confession?
It cannot be pretended that he was endeavouring to screen Juan
Franco, because he has very amply betrayed him in other ways. Is
the explanation that under fear of torture he felt the need to
invent an answer likely to satisfy the inquisitors? It can hardly
be that, because Juan Franco himself is to admit&mdash;as we
shall see&mdash;the truth of this detail. It only remains to be
supposed that the lively fear of torture had sharpened the young
Jew's memory. But that again seems hardly satisfactory as an
explanation.</p>
<p>"Where," they ask him next, "is La Hos?"</p>
<p>"It is," he replies, "a meadow by the River Algodor," and he
goes on to explain that Juan Franco had told them all that he had
taken a load of wheat to Toledo to sell, and that, having sold
it, he went to an inn, and later on he found the boy in a doorway
and coaxed him away with <i>nuégados</i> (a sweetmeat composed of
flour, honey, and nuts&mdash;nougat). Thus he got him into his
cart and brought him to La Guardia.</p>
<p>Yucé doesn't know who were the child's parents, nor in what
street of Toledo he was taken by Juan Franco, as the latter did
not mention those particulars.</p>
<p>"Who were the first to propose the affair? Did the Jews engage
the Christians in it, or the Christians engage the Jews?"</p>
<p>He answers that the Francos of La Guardia, fearing the
Inquisition, performed an enchantment in the first instance with
a consecrated wafer, as he has already confessed (October ii),
and then repaired to Tazarte asking him to do something more
efficacious, as the sorcery with the wafer had had no result.
Tazarte agreed, and bade them procure a Christian boy for the
purpose. When Juan Franco brought him, it was decided to cut out
his heart, that with this heart and a wafer a stronger
enchantment might be performed.</p>
<p>"Why was he done to death by crucifixion rather than in any
other way?"</p>
<p>Yucé believes that the crucifixion was preferred in
vituperation of Jesus Christ. But again he protests that his own
share was no more than he has confessed already.</p>
<p>"What were the particular vituperations used to the child, and
by whom?"</p>
<p>His answer to this question incriminates all those who were
present at the affair; the vituperations which he tells the
inquisitors were employed were rather indecent, and include a
scurrilous version of the Incarnation which would, no doubt, be
current at the time among Jews and other enemies of Christianity
in Spain and elsewhere&mdash;a story, it is needless to add,
entirely idle and foolish, and rather the obvious thing to be
conceived in those days against any historical character who
might be detested.</p>
<p>He says that Tazarte was the leader in all the vituperations
(which sounds likely enough, as Tazarte was the celebrant), that
the others uttered them after him, and he admits that he himself
said some of the things which he has mentioned, but he doesn't
enter into particulars.</p>
<p>"For what purpose were the heart and the Host required, and
what good purpose was expected to be served by these
sorceries?"</p>
<p>He replies that these things were done to the end that the
inquisitors or any others who should aim at molesting these
Christians concerned should die of rabies.</p>
<p>"What advantage did the Jews look to gain?"</p>
<p>He states that Tazarte had assured them that as a consequence
of the enchantment all Christians in the land must either perish
or become Jews, so that the Law of Moses should triumph and
prevail.</p>
<p>"To whom were the heart and the Host to be delivered for the
said enchantment?"</p>
<p>"To Mosé Abenamias at Zamora."</p>
<p>"Was Abenamias himself to perform the enchantment?"</p>
<p>"No; he was to give orders for its performance to a wizard of
Zamora."</p>
<p>"Does he, or do any of the others, know the said wizard, and
what is his name?"</p>
<p>He cannot answer the question, beyond telling them that he had
heard Tazarte say that he knew Abenamias and the wizard, and that
he had been to school with the latter.</p>
<p>"How many times did they assemble to decide upon the
crucifixion?"</p>
<p>He knows that all (with the exception of himself) assembled in
the same cave to perform an enchantment with a Host on an
occasion previous to that of the boy's crucifixion. He knows this
because he was invited to the gathering; he did not wish to go,
and so stayed away, but he was told afterwards by the others what
had been done.</p>
<p>"What Christians does he know to have kept the Sabbath, the
Passover, and to have performed Jewish rites?"</p>
<p>He says that Benito once came to their house at Tenbleque and
spent a Sabbath with them, doing no work, eating <i>adafinas</i>
and drinking <i>Caser</i> wine; and that he came upon another
occasion and asked them when was the fast of <i>Tisabeaf</i> (the
eve of Purim), and that he believes that, being informed of this,
he kept that fast.</p>
<p>He can remember no others, excepting one Diego de Ayllon and
three of his daughters and a son, all of whom kept the Sabbath
and observed the law of Moses in secret; and the widow of one
Juan de Origuela, deceased, who sometimes kept Jewish fasts; and
Juan Vermejo of Tenbleque, whom he knows once to have kept the
great fast.</p>
<p>These names are duly noted on the margin of the notary's
document as matters of importance which need inquiring into.</p>
<p>"Whence was the wafer procured, and how does he know that it
was consecrated?"</p>
<p>He answers that when they assembled, a fortnight after the
crucifixion, he heard Alonso Franco say that he had taken it from
the monstrancje in the Church of Romeral, replacing it by an
unconsecrated wafer.</p>
<p>"Was this the wafer given to Tazarte with the heart?"</p>
<p>He believes so, but he is oot sure, nor does he know what
became of it.</p>
<p>"Who brought the other wafer given to Benito, and whence was
it obtained?"</p>
<p>Alonso brought it, and said that he had obtained it in the
church of La Guardia, and that it was consecrated. But Yucé
doesn't know if anyone gave it to him.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletn," xi. p. 80.]</p>
<p>This confession Yucé ratified two days later, adding now that
Juan and Garcia Franco together had brought the boy, and that one
had remained at La Hos with him whilst the other had come to La
Guardia. Further, he adds that the letter to Abenamias at Zamora
bore six signatures&mdash;Tazarte's, Alonso Franco's, Benito
Garcia's, Yucé Franco's own, his brother's, and one other which
he can't recall.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 87.]</p>
<p>We have already indicated that a mystery attaches to this
letter. What has become of it? We are told that Benito bore it
together with the Host. How does it happen that it was not taken
together with the Host when he was arrested at the inn at
Astorga? Possibly it was. But in that case, and since it bore
Yucé's signature, why is it not included in the <i>dossier</i>,
and why can we find no trace of any use having been made of it by
the inquisitors? The only plausible explanation&mdash;and it may
be forthcoming when the <i>dossiers</i> of the other accused are
discovered&mdash;is that the Host found upon Benito Garcia was
not the one sent with the letter by his hand some time in 1487 or
1488.</p>
<p>On November 3 the octogenarian Ça is examined in the
torture-chamber, strapped, as was his son, to the
<i>escalera</i>. But the mere fear of torture is not sufficient
to loosen the tongue of this aged Jew. He resists their
questions, and will add nothing to what he has confessed, until
the executioner has submitted him to that frightful torment and
given him one jar of water. He then affords them, at last, the
further information they require, telling them the precise
vituperations that were addressed to the crucified boy, and
admitting that this was done in mockery of the Passion of Jesus
Christ. He says that Tazarte uttered the insults, and that the
others&mdash;first the Jews, and after them the
Christians&mdash;repeated them. Further, he confesses that the
child was crucified and the sorceries performed that the
inquisitors and all Christians should enrage and die.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 91.]</p>
<p>On the same day Juan Franco was tied to the <i>escalera</i>,
beyond which it was not necessary to proceed with him, for he
there satisfied the inquisitors by confessing to the
vituperations employed against the crucified boy.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 91.]</p>
<p>On the 4th further confirmation of this is obtained from Juan
de Ocaña, who confesses to the vituperations, and says that they
were first uttered by the Jews, who then compelled the Christians
to repeat them. He does not remember the terms used, nor would he
ever have known them but for the Jews.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 90.]</p>
<p>Benito is next examined, and warned by the inquisitors to
answer truthfully, as the truth is already fully known to them.
He admits that many vituperations were used; he cites them, and
in the main they agree with what has already been deponed.</p>
<p>"Who," he is asked, "were the first to utter these
things?"</p>
<p>He replies that Ça Franco, his sons, and Tazarte (i.e. the
Jews) were the first, and that he and the other Christians
repeated them afterwards.</p>
<p>Lastly, on November 5, Alonso Franco affords the fullest
confirmation to all this that has been confessed by the other
accused.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 89.]</p>
<p>The trial is now rapidly drawing to a close. On the 7th Yucé
is again before the court, and&mdash;sinister feature&mdash;this
time he comes alone. His counsel has vanished, in acknowledgment
of the fact that it is no longer tenable with his duty to God
that he should continue to defend one of whose "heresy" he is
himself convinced. Yucé himself, in view of this, must realize
that he is lost, and must abandon his last shred of hope.</p>
<p>Guevára, the prosecutor, is there, and Dr. Villada announces
that additional proof is now before the court. He orders copies
of the latest depositions, obtained in the torture-chamber, to be
delivered to the defendant, and he accords the latter three days
within which he must lodge any objection to anything contained in
them.</p>
<p>But Yucé does not require so long. He realizes that all is
lost, and he forthwith confesses that what has been deponed by
the witnesses against him concerning the vituperations he used is
true with certain exceptions, and these were the most blasphemous
and insulting.</p>
<p>Upon that the fiscal Guevára formally petitions the court to
pass sentence. The inquisitor Santo Domingo declares the trial to
be at an end, and dismisses both parties, requiring them to come
before the court again in three days' time to hear the
sentence.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin, xi. p. 97.]</p>
<p>Yet, before proceeding to this, on the 14th day of that month
of November, the inquisitors ordered all the prisoners (with the
exception of Juan Franco) to be introduced together into the
audience-chamber. There, in the presence of his co-accused, each
was bidden to recite what he had already confessed, this being
done with the aim of obtaining a greater unanimity upon
details.</p>
<p>Last of all, Juan Franco is brought in, and he now admits that
it is true that he brought the boy from Toledo, that they had
crucified him as he has confessed, that he himself had opened the
boy's side and taken out his heart, and that his brother Alonso
had opened the veins of the child's arms, etc.&mdash;all as
confessed&mdash;and further that it is true that he and his
brother Alfonso had afterwards buried their victim.</p>
<p>He now corroborates Benito's statement that on the day they
stole the child he and Benito went together to Toledo, and that
they agreed that one should seek in one quarter of the city
whilst the other sought in another. And further, he says that he
found the child in the doorway'&mdash;known as the Puerta del
Perdon&mdash;of the cathedral, as he has already stated in his
confession (which is not before us).</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 94.]</p>
<p>On the next day Guevára appears before the inquisitors to
petition that in view of what has been deponed against the
deceased Mosé Franco, Yucé Tazarte, and David Perejon, their
Paternities should order it to be recorded <i>ad perpetuam rei
memoriam</i>, to enable the execution of the deceased in effigy,
the confiscation of their property, and the infamy of their
heirs.</p>
<p>That is on November 15. On the 16th the last scene of this
protracted trial is played in the marketsquare of Avila.</p>
<p>There, near the church of St. Peter, the scaffolds have been
erected for the Auto de Fé. On one, in their hideous yellow
<i>sanbenitos</i>, are grouped the eight prisoners and the three
effigies. On the other are the inquisitors, Dr. Pedro de Villada
and Prey Antonio de Santo Domingo, with all the <i>personnel</i>
of the Holy Office, their notaries, the fiscal Guevára,
familiars, and apparitors. Round the scaffolds thronged the
greater part of the inhabitants of Avila and many who had come in
from the surrounding country districts, whence it is clear that
the Auto had been announced some days before. The popular feeling
against the Jews runs high, and it is an angry, turbulent mob
that witnesses the Auto. Avila, indeed, is in uproar, and no Jew
dare show himself abroad without risk of being insulted or
assaulted in the street.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 421.]</p>
<p>The sentences are read by the notary Antonio Gongales,
commencing with a very full narrative of the crimes of each of
the accused, which we need not render here as it is a summary of
all that has been gone through and practically a repetition of
the matter contained in the "Testimonio."</p>
<p>They are sentenced all to be abandoned to the secular arm of
the Corregidor Don Alvaro de Sant' Estiban, who, advised some
days before, is in attendance with his lieutenants and
<i>alguaziles</i>.</p>
<p>The usual exhortation being duly pronounced, they are seized
by the men of the Corregidor and led away out of the city to the
burning-place. The inquisitors order their notaries to accompany
the doomed men, that they may record their final confessions at
the stake.</p>
<p>In Yucé's <i>dossier</i> are included not only his own
confession&mdash;made at the last moment&mdash;but also Benito
Garcia's, Juan de Ocaña's, and Juan Franco's, all recorded by the
notary Gonçales. Further, this <i>dossier</i> contains a letter
written on the morrow of the event by the same notary of the Holy
Office to the authorities of La Guardia, accompanying a relation
of the crime and the sentences pronounced, for publication in La
Guardia, where the offences were committed.</p>
<p>From this we learn that Benito, in spite of his protestations
that he would die a Jew betide what might, accepted at the stake
the spiritual comforts of the Church, and thus earned the mercy
of being strangled before the faggots were fired.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 113.]</p>
<p>Similarly Juan de Ocaña and Juan Franco accepted the
ministrations of the attendant friars and returned to the Church
from which they had secretly seceded. But the Jews&mdash;the
stalwart old man of over eighty and his son&mdash;held staunchly
to their faith, and refused to avoid by apostasy any part of the
agony prepared them. Wherefore, in a spite that seems almost
satanic, their flesh was torn with red-hot pincers before they
were consumed over slow fires.</p>
<p>"They refused," writes the reverend notary, "to call upon God
or the Virgin Mary or to make so much as a sign of the Cross. Do
not pray for them," he concludes, impatiently it seems to us,
"for they are buried in Hell."</p>
<p>Finally, the notary begs the authorities of La Guardia not to
permit that the place where Juan Franco said that the Holy Child
was buried should be ploughed over, but to see that it is left
intact. Their Highnesses and the Cardinal of Spain, he adds, may
desire to visit it, and he prays that God "may reveal to us the
bones of the infant." It is expedient to mark the spot, he
concludes, because, in view of the merits of such a place, he
hopes that it may please God that the earth of it will work
miracles.</p>
<p>The sentence is sent, it should be added, with order that it
shall be read from the pulpit of La Guardia on the following
Sunday, and this under pain of excommunication.</p>
<p>In Avila the popular feeling against the Jews as a consequence
of this affair was so bitter that their lives were not safe, and
it is on record that one was stoned to death in the streets. It
became necessary for the Aljama of that city to petition the
Sovereigns for protection, and M. Fidel Fita quotes a royal
letter commanding such protection to be extended, with threats of
rigour against any who should molest them.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xi. p. 421.]</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-24" name="ch-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV. EPILOGUE TO THE
AFFAIR OF THE SANTO NINO</h2>
<p>The evidence given by Yucé Franco as to whence the consecrated
wafers had been obtained is hearsay evidence, and very vague even
then. But it would appear that from Benito Garcia or Alfonso
Franco the inquisitors have been able to obtain something more
definite, for whilst the trial of the eight accused has been
drawing to a close, the familiars of the Holy Office have been
about the apprehension of the sacristan of the church of La
Guardia.</p>
<p>On November 18, 1491&mdash;two days after the Auto&mdash;this
sacristan is brought before the court at Avila, and admonished to
tell the truth of this matter, being promised mercy if he will do
so.</p>
<p>He states that about two years ago his uncle, Alonso Franco,
besought him on two separate occasions to let him have two
consecrated wafers, promising him a cloak and money and much else
if he would so. Ultimately, in response to these requests, and in
accordance with the instructions he received from Alonso, he
delivered a consecrated wafer to Benito Garcia, who came for it
on the other's behalf</p>
<p>He remembers that it was winter-time, but he cannot recall the
day or even the month. He explains that he took the Host from the
pyx in the sanctuary of the Church of Santa Maria, having
obtained the keys from the earthenware pot in which they were
kept. He pays that he begged Benito to tell him what it was
wanted for, but that he could not induce him to say. He was
assured, however, that no harm was intended.</p>
<p>He is able to fix the date more closely by remembering that
the Francos were arrested about five months later.</p>
<p>Under fiarther examination he declares that he believes in the
True Presence, and always did, and that when he urged this upon
Alfonso Franco and Benito Garcia they admitted that his act was a
sin, but they assured him that it was not a heresy, and that no
heresy was involved, and that for the sin his confessor would
absolve him.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Boletin," xii. p. 169.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>One man who is alleged to have had a share in the affair of La
Guardia escaped all mention at the time in the depositions of the
accused, and was, consequently, entirely overlooked. This was one
Hernando de Ribera, a man of a station in life very much above
that of the others, and it is said that in consequence of this to
him had been assigned the aristocratic röle of Pilate in that
parody of the Passion.</p>
<p>Not until nearly thirty years later was he arrested,
self-betrayed, it is said, the man having boasted of his share in
that affair. He was convicted of that crime, and also of flagrant
Judaizing, for in the meanwhile he had accepted baptism to avoid
expulsion from Spain when the decree of banishment of all Jews
was published.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Now, whilst the publication by M. Fidel Fita ot the records of
the trial of Yucé Franco has shed a good deal of light upon the
affair, it is not to be denied that much still remains to be
explained, and that until such explanations are
forthcoming&mdash;until the records of the proceedings against
Yucé's co-accused are brought to light and we are able to compare
them one with another&mdash;the affair of the Holy Infant of La
Guardia must to a certain extent continue in the category of
historic mysteries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, in spite of the glaring contradictions
contained in the evidence at present available, in spite of the
incongruities which refuse to fit into the general scheme, we
cannot hold that M. Loeb is justified of his conclusion that the
Holy Infant of La Guardia&mdash;and consequently the crime with
which we have dealt&mdash;never had any real existence.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Revue des Etudes Juives," vol. xv. p.
232,]</p>
<p>M. Loeb makes a twofold contention:</p>
<p>(a) If the crime of La Guardia ever did take place, then upon
the evidence itself, it was not ritual murder at all, but a case
of sorcery in which Christians were concerned as well as
Jews.</p>
<p>(b) No such crime ever did take place.</p>
<p>He bases his somewhat daring final conclusion upon three
premises:</p>
<p>(a) The depositions ot the witnesses, obtained under torture
or the threat of it, are full of contradictions, of
improbabilities, and of facts materially impossible.</p>
<p>(b) The judges made no inquest to discover the truth.</p>
<p>(c) The Inquisition is unable to fix the date of the crime; it
did not verify the disappearance or discover the remains of any
child.</p>
<p>The first of these premises is the most worthy of attention.
The other two appear to us to overlook the fact that our present
knowledge is confined to the record of the trial of one of the
accused, and this one a youth who was guilty of participating in
the crime in a comparatively minor degree.</p>
<p>No one is in a position to say that the judges made no inquest
to discover the truth. All that we know is that it does not
transpire from Yucé's trial that any such efforts were made. But
then such efforts may not so much concern Yucé's trial as the
trials of some of the ringleaders, and it is very possible that
the records of the latter may divulge some such inquest. It is
more than possible. The compiler of the résumé of seven of the
trials distinctly shows that this was done.* He cites the fact
that when Juan Franco had confessed that he and his brother
Alonso buried the boy, the inquisitors took him to the place
where he stated that the body had been inhumed, and made him
point out the exact spot, "and they discovered the truth and
demonstration of all this.**</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Boletin," xiii. p. 113.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Y se halló la verdad y demonstracion de
todo ello."]</p>
<p>This, of course, does not mean that the body was found. It
simply means&mdash;as we are told&mdash;that the place indicated
by Juan Franco presented the appearance of having lately served
the purpose of a grave. The failure to find the body is
undoubtedly one of the unexplained mysteries of this affair. But
it does not justify the statement that no inquest was
made&mdash;a statement which in itself implies that the
inquisitors knew the whole story to be false, and therefore
deliberately avoided inquiries which should expose that
falseness.</p>
<p>The vagueness and confusion that appear to exist on the
subject of the date when the crime was committed certainly call
for comment.</p>
<p>The contradictions on this score appear to be flagrant, and it
is impossible to reconcile the date of the crucifixions with that
of Benito Garcia's arrest in Astorga. It seems to be established
by Yucé that the crucifixion took place at the end of Lent 1488;
and he and others tell us that about six months later they all
assembled again to dispatch the Host to Zamora by the hand of
Benito. Yet Benito is arrested in Astorga in May or June of
1490&mdash;more than eighteen months after setting out for
Zamora&mdash;and the wafer is still in his possession,
undelivered. That is what <i>seems</i> to be established. But it
is possible that a very simple explanation may dispose of this
discrepancy. We are not justified by our present knowledge in
saying that the inquisitors were unable to dispose of it. We may
not assume that there is not, in the records of the trials of the
other accused, matter that will clear up this question.</p>
<p>The date supplied by the sacristan, for instance, does not
seem to be so very inconsistent with that of the event in the inn
at Astorga. He said, it will be remembered, that he had delivered
the wafer to Benito some five months before the arrest of the
Francos. This tends strongly to confirm the impression we have
already formed that the wafer discovered upon Benito at the time
of his arrest was not the one that he had set out to take to
Zamora some two years earlier. The Host, together with the letter
for Abenamias, may very well have reached its destination. If
this is admitted&mdash;and there is nothing in the evidence to
forbid its admittance&mdash;much that is irreconcilable in the
depositions at once disappears.</p>
<p>M. Loeb, of course, has proceeded upon the assumption that it
is pretended that the Host dispatched from La Guardia in 1488 and
the Host found upon Benito at Astorga in 1490 are one and the
same. It may appear to be the obvious thing to assume. Yet it is
a hasty assumption, which nothing in the evidence before us will
justify.</p>
<p>As for the other discrepancies which M. Loeb points out, when
all is said, they refer to matters of detail, upon which mistakes
are not impossible.</p>
<p>Benito states that the child's hands and feet were nailed to
the cross in addition to being tied, whilst Yucé makes no mention
of nails.</p>
<p>According to the statements of Yucé and of Juan Franco, it is
the latter's brother who opened the veins in the boy's arms,
whereas Ocaña said that this was done by Yucé. We have already
drawn attention to the circumstances under which Ocaña so accused
Yucé, and we have suggested the vindictiveness that may have
inspired him.</p>
<p>Juan Franco confessed that he himself cut open the boy's side
and drew out the heart, whilst Yucé's statement was to the effect
that Juan had opened the wound and Garcia Franco had torn out the
heart.</p>
<p>Mainly the evidence seems to say that the child bled to death.
Yet Benito states that he was strangled(?), and Yucé in one of
his statements says that they gagged him because he was crying.
We have already suggested that by the expression "<i>lo
ahogaron</i>" so much as "strangling" may not necessarily have
been meant.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>These are, after all, the principal discrepancies; and it is
to be remembered that these men were referring to things done at
least two years before; that confusion on the score of
particulars is not only possible but more or less inevitable; and
that, despite contradictions in these details, the main facts
stated are always the same in the depositions of each. M. Loeb
more than suggests that this unanimity was contrived by the
inquisitors. He puts it forward as more than probable that the
prisoners were left alone together on the occasions of the
confrontations, to the end that they might agree upon the same
tale.</p>
<p>There is not the slightest warrant for such an assumption. In
the records the notary very clearly states that the inquisitors
were present throughout those confrontations, and it is of
importance to remember that these records were not prepared for
publication, but were to be consigned to the secret archives of
the Inquisition&mdash;so that any notion of a fraud having been
deliberately perpetrated may once for all be dismissed as
entirely idle.</p>
<p>But even were it not the recorded fact that the inquisitors
were present at the confrontations, and that the prisoners were
afforded no opportunity of coming to any understanding, it would
still be extremely difficult to believe that they should have
come to an understanding to get themselves all burnt.</p>
<p>M. Loeb's attempt to make this appear reasonable is the least
convincing thing in a very able but quite unconvincing article.
It certainly seems to display his own want of confidence in the
general acceptance of such a situation.</p>
<p>"We could understand," he says, "that guilty men should come
to an understanding to deny the crime committed, or to attenuate
the fault, or to cast it upon others. But what should be the
meaning of an understanding whose object, as would be the case
here, is to make truthful avowals of a real crime? The accused
would be taking unnecessary trouble. But all is explained if, on
the contrary, they prepared confessions of a crime that was never
committed."</p>
<p>M. Loeb has vitiated his argument by the absolute assumption
that an understanding did take place. This we cannot admit upon
the evidence before us. But if we do, is the position materially
altered? M. Loeb says that "all is explained if they prepared
confessions of a crime that was never committed." To our mind,
nothing is explained by such a procedure. What possible object
could have induced them to come to an understanding to make an
uncommitted crime the subject of a unanimous confession that must
infallibly send them to the stake? What possible advantage could
they hope to derive from a falsehood of that description ?</p>
<p>One of the chief obstacles to the rejection of the story as a
fabrication is Yucé's confession to "the Rabbi Abraham" in the
prison of Segovia. M. Loeb recognizes it, and although he makes a
determined attempt to overcome it, his arguments are too
arbitrary and do not materially affect the point even if they are
admitted.</p>
<p>But if M. Loeb is entirely unconvincing in his attempts to
prove that the crucifixion of the boy is a fable, nothing could
be more convincing than his first contention: that even if we
account the story true as contained in Yucé's <i>dossier</i>, the
deed is not to be looked upon as ritual murder, but purely as an
operation in magic.</p>
<p>It is a conclusion with which you must come to agree, although
at first glance you may be tempted to form the opinion that the
crucifixion of the child served both purposes. Some such opinion
had been formed by the inquisitors when they asked why the boy
had been crucified rather than put to death in some other
fashion, since his heart was all that was required for the
enchantment.</p>
<p>The answer was that crucifixion was chosen in derision and
vituperation of the Passion of Jesus Christ. But this is a very
different thing from ritual murder or "the hanging of Haman." If
we turn to the actual vituperative phrases employed,* we find the
expression of a desire to wound the Redeemer Himself, through
that form of magic, common in all ages, known as
<i>envoûtement</i>. Instead of the waxen or wooden effigy usually
employed, a living body is used in this case. For the rest the
immolation of a child plays its part in the magic ritual of other
than Jews. We need mention but the notorious instance of the
Black Masses celebrated by the infamous Abbé Gribourg in the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See the phrases quoted in the
"Testimonio."]</p>
<p>There seems, indeed, no doubt at all that we are justified in
rejecting the theory that the crucifixion of the Holy Child of La
Guardia is to be accepted as an instance of Jewish ritual murder.
So far we can accompany M. Loeb, but no farther. We cannot say
with him that no such crime was ever committed. To convince us of
that it would be necessary to show that the whole of the
<i>dossier</i> we have considered is a forgery to serve the
purposes of Torquemada. And this we have proof that it is not.
Had it been that, had it been manufactured for popular
consumption, it would not have lain concealed for four centuries
in the secret archives of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>That Torquemada exploited the matter and turned it to the
fullest account is admitted. But this merely shows him to be an
opportunist; it is very far from proving him a forger. The very
sentence was couched in terms calculated to excite&mdash;as it
did&mdash;popular indignation against the Jews. Nor did the
publication of the sentence end in La Guardia, whither copies
were sent. We may infer that Torquemada scattered those copies
broadcast through Spain, since we actually find a Catalan
translation which was specially prepared for publication in
Barcelona.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The cult of the Holy Child of La Guardia sprang up at once,
and developed rapidly. Numerous shrines were set up in his
honour, the first and chief of these being on the site of the
house of Juan Franco, which had been razed to the ground. Here an
altar was erected in the cellar of the house, on the spot where
it was believed that the child's sufferings had begun; it was
surmounted by a figure of a child pinioned to a column.</p>
<p>Over this subterranean shrine a church sprang rapidly into
existence.</p>
<p>Another hermitage was erected near Santa Maria de Pera, on the
spot where the child was alleged to have been buried, and yet
another in the cave where he was believed to have suffered
crucifixion. "In all times since," says Moreno,* "the three
sanctuaries have been frequented by those who come to pray to the
Niiio as to a saint."</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia del Martirio," p. 83.]</p>
<p>The first of these sanctuaries was erected by 1501&mdash;at
which date records of it are to be found. It was called the
Sanctuary of the Holy Innocent, and Moreno adds that this has
always received the approval of Popes and Bishops, and that
plenary and partial indulgences have been granted to the faithful
visiting these shrines.</p>
<p>The people of La Guardia elected him their patron saint, and a
fast was appointed for the eve of his feastday, which at first
was March 25, but was afterwards changed to September 25. Moreno
includes in his book the prayers prescribed and a litany to the
Niño.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia," p. 146.]</p>
<p>But it is not without a certain significance that
Rome&mdash;ever cautious, as we have already had occasion to say,
in the matter of canonization&mdash;has not yet recognized the
Holy Child of La Guardia as one of the saints of the Church.</p>
<p>Yepes chronicles four miracles performed by the child after
his death, beginning with his mother's obtaining sight. All
these, with other very interesting and purely romantic details,
are to be found in that piously fraudulent work&mdash;the "Life
of the Holy Child," by Martinez Moreno.</p>

<p>It was, as we have already suggested, the very opportuneness
with which the trial and sentence ot those concerned in the
affair of La Guardia came to afford Torquemada an additional
argument to plead with the Sovereigns his case against the Jews,
which has led so many historians&mdash;prior to M. Fidel Fita's
discovery&mdash;to reject the story as an invention. Another
reason to discredit it lay in the circumstance that it was
circulated in Spain together with a number of other stories that
were obviously false and obviously invented expressly for the
purpose of defaming the Jews and exciting popular indignation
against them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ferdinand and Isabella pressed triumphantly forward
on their conquering progress through Andalusia. Lucena, Coin,
Ronda, and scores of other Moorish strongholds in the southern
hills had fallen before the irresistible arms of the Christians;
and the Sovereigns, aided by Jewish gold&mdash;not merely the
gold extorted by confiscations, but moneys voluntarily
contributed by their Hebrew subjects&mdash;pushed on to the
reduction of Malaga, as the prelude to the leaguer of Granada
itself, the last bulwark of Islam in Spain. This fell on January
2, 1492, and with it fell the Moslem dominion, which had endured
in the peninsula, with varying fortunes, for nearly 800
years.</p>
<p>It might well have seemed to the Catholic Sovereigns that the
conquest ot Spain and the victory there of Christianity were at
last accomplished, had not Torquemada been at their elbow to
point out that the triumph of the Cross would never be complete
in that land as long as the Jews continued to be numbered among
its inhabitants.</p>
<p>He protested that the evils resulting from intercourse between
Christian and Jew were notorious and unconquerable. He declared
that in spite of the Inquisition, and in spite of all other
measures that had been taken to keep Christian and Jew apart, the
evil persisted and was as rampant as ever. He urged that the Jews
continued unabatedly to pervert the Christians, and that they
must so continue as long as they were tolerated to remain in the
peninsula. Particularly was this notorious in the case of the
Marranos or New-Christians, to whom the Israelites gave no peace
until&mdash;by indoctrination or by the scorn and abuse they
heaped upon them&mdash;they had seduced them back into error.</p>
<p>And in proof of what he urged he was able to point to the
affair of La Guardia, to the outrage to the crucifix at Casar de
Palomero, and to other matters of a kindred nature that had
lately been brought to light.</p>
<p>He called upon the Sovereigns to redeem the promise they had
made to give consideration to this matter&mdash;a consideration
which, in answer to his earlier pleadings, they had postponed
until the war against Granada should have been brought to its
conclusion.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Jews themselves had fought strenuously
against the banishment with which they saw themselves threatened.
Eloquent had been their appeals to the Sovereigns. And the
Sovereigns could hardly turn a deaf ear to the intercessions of
subjects to whom they owed so much. For was it not the very Jews
who had supplied the Spanish crown with the sinews for this
campaign against the enemies of the Cross? Was it not owing to
wonderful Hebrew administration&mdash;an administration
gratefully surrendered to them&mdash;that the army of the Cross
was equipped, maintained, and paid out of moneys that the Jews
themselves had provided?</p>
<p>They found means to bring this to the attention of the
Sovereigns, as a proof of the loyalty of their devotion, as a
proof of their value to the Spanish nation. And the Sovereigns
had other experiences of the loyalty and affection which had ever
been manifested towards them by their long-suffering Hebrew
subjects. When, for instance, their son, the Infante Don Juan was
proclaimed in Aragon, after the Cortes of Toledo, the Jews had
been foremost in the jubilant and loving receptions that
everywhere met their Highnesses in the course of their progress
through the kingdom of Ferdinand. Whilst the Spaniards were
content to greet their Sovereigns with acclamations, the Jews
went to meet them with valuable gifts.* Bernaldez tells us** of
the splendid offering made to their Highnesses by the Aljama of
Zaragoza. It consisted ot twelve calves, twelve lambs, and a
curious and very beautiful service of silver borne by twelve
Jews, a rich silver cup full of gold castellanos*** and a jar of
silver&mdash;"all of which the Sovereigns received and prized,
returning many thanks."</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Amador de los Rios, "Historia de los
Judios," vol. iii. p. 292.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** "Cronica," cap. xlvi.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[*** The castellano was worth 480
maravedis.]</p>
<p>Loyalty so tangibly manifested, of which this is but an
instance, must have some weight in the scales against fanaticism;
further, it seems impossible that the Sovereigns should have been
altogether blind to the possible jeopardizing of the industrial
prosperity of the kingdom if those chiefly responsible for it
were driven out.</p>
<p>So they had put off their decision in the matter, urging that
the present war demanded their full attention. But now that the
conquest of Granada was accomplished, they were forced to look
the matter in the face. For Torquemada was giving them no peace.
Hard-driven by his fanatical hatred of the Israelites, the Grand
Inquisitor had resolved upon his course and was determined that
nothing should turn him aside.</p>
<p>Constantly were his arguments&mdash;all founded upon the love
of Christ&mdash;poured into the ears of the Sovereigns, and to
prove the soundness of these arguments he was able to bring
forward concrete facts&mdash;or, at least, matters upon which the
courts of the Inquisition had pronounced&mdash;prominent among
which would be the affair of La Guardia.</p>
<p>And what Torquemada was doing by the Sovereigns; the brethren
of his order were doing by Spain. Popular indignation against the
Jews, so easy to arouse, already inflamed by the outrage at Casar
de Palomero and the crucifixion at La Guardia, was further and
unscrupulously excited by false stories that were set in
circulation. It was even alleged that the illness of the Prince
Don Juan was the result of Hebrew infamy, and to explain this a
foolish, wicked story was invented, put about and universally
accepted.</p>
<p>Llorente quotes this story from the "Anonymo de Zaragoza.* It
is to the effect that the prince coveted a golden pomander-ball
worn by his physician, who was of a Jewish family, and this
gewgaw the physician ended by relinquishing to his patient. One
day, moved by youthful curiosity, the boy wished to see what the
pomander contained. Opening it, he discovered an indecent and
blasphemous picture, insulting to the divinity of Christ. The
sight of it inspired the princeling with such horror and grief
that he fell sick. Nor would he divulge the origin of his illness
until the instances of his father succeeded in drawing the secret
from him, whereupon "it was resolved to take proceedings against
the physician and to sentence him to the fire."</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Anales," vol. i. p. 199.]</p>
<p>This trivial, scurrilous, and obviously untruthful story would
not be worth repeating did it not serve the purpose of showing
the sort of rumours that were being propagated to the hurt of the
Israelites.</p>
<p>Another story that was circulated alleged that in Valencia
there had also been an attempt by a number of Jews to crucify a
Christian boy. This is recorded in that scurrilous, infamous
publication, "Centinela contra Judios," by Frey Francisco de
Torrejoncillo. We have already referred to it more than once. It
was first printed in 1676, and is the book of a friar of the
Order of St. Francis, a disgraceful work which proves its author
to have been as barefaced as he was barefooted. It is a
collection of stupid lies and forgeries, and, it is scarcely an
exaggeration to add, obscenities; it may be another instance of
those frauds termed pious, but it is scarcely to the credit of a
Church exercising, by means of the "Index Expurgatorius," a
censorship of the press&mdash;to have permitted the circulation
of a work of this order from the pen of a churchman.</p>
<p>This, however, is by the way.</p>
<p>The story here to be recorded is taken, Torrejoncillo tells
us, from the "Sermon de la Cruz" by Frey Felipe de Salazar.* On a
Good Friday evening a youth who was in a street of Valencia
observed several men entering a house. Considering this to be
strange&mdash;although no suspicious circumstance is
mentioned&mdash;he approached the door and listened. He heard
them say, "There seems to be some one at the door." Fearing that
a brawl might be the result if he were discovered there when they
opened, he drew his sword and fled. (How the drawing of his sword
was calculated to assist his flight the author does not think it
worth while to inform us.) As he was running he came upon a
patrol, which seized him, demanding to know whither he was
hurrying in this fashion with a naked sword in his hand. He
related what he had witnessed, whereupon the officer, not only
for the purpose of testing the truth of the story but also that
he might ascertain to what end so many men should be assembling,
went to the house and knocked.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Centinela," p. 153.]</p>
<p>The door was opened by a Jew, who began to make obvious
excuses to him. Suddenly the officer heard a child's voice within
the house, crying, "These men want to crucify me."</p>
<p>The Jews were taken, the house demolished, and on the site of
it was built the Church of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In this collection of lies and forgeries are included the
"letter of Christ to Abgarus," another letter of Pontius Pilate
to Tiberius dilating upon the miracles of the Saviour, and a
letter from the Jews of Constantinople to those of Toledo, which
played an important part in this anti-semitic campaign.</p>
<p>It was the Cardinal-Archbishop Juan Martinez Siliceo who was
alleged to have discovered this letter in Toledo. We are to
suppose that he also found in Toledo the letter to the Jews of
Constantinople to which this is a reply, for the chroniclers are
able to supply us with the texts of both,* a circumstance which
no one at the time appears to have considered strange.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See Llorente, "Anales," vol. i. p. 196,
and "Centinela," p. 86.]</p>
<p>The letter to Constantinople ran as follows:<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"THE JEWS OF SPAIN <i>to</i> THE JEWS OF CONSTANTINOPLE</p>
<p>"Honoured Jews, health and grace.&mdash;Know that the King of
Spain compels us to become Christians, deprives us of property
and of life, destroys our synagogues and otherwise oppresses us,
so that we are uncertain what to do.</p>
<p>"By the Law of Moses we beseech you to assemble, and to send
us with all speed the declaration made in your assembly.</p>
<p>"CHAMARRO, Prince of the Jews of Spain."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>To this the answer received from Constantinople was in the
following terms:<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"THE JEWS OF CONSTANTINOPLE <i>to</i> THE JEWS OF SPAIN</p>
<p>"Beloved Brethren in Moses,&mdash;We have your letter in which
you tell us of the travail and suffering you are enduring
there...The opinion of the Rabbis is that' since the King of
Spain attempts to make you Christians, you should become
Christians; since he deprives you of your goods and property, you
should make your children merchants, that they may deprive the
Christians of theirs; since you say that they deprive you of your
lives, make your sons apothecaries and physicians to deprive the
Christians of theirs; since they destroy your synagogues, make
your sons clerics that they may destroy the Christian temples;
since you say that you suffer other wrongs, make your sons enter
public offices that thus they may render the Christians subject
to them.</p>
<p>"Do not depart from these orders, and you will see that from
oppressed you will come to be held of great account.</p>
<p>"HUSÉE, Prince of the Jews of Constantinople."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The matter of these letters&mdash;so very obviously
forged&mdash;was freely circulated. Being accepted, public
indignation was suddenly increased by fear. Imaginations were
stimulated, and stories based upon these injunctions of Prince
Husee became current, nothing being ever too flagrant for popular
consumption. It was related that a Jewish physician in Toledo
carried poison in one of his finger-nails, and that with this he
touched the tongues of the patients he visited, thus killing
them. Of another physician it was reported that be deliberately
poisoned the woundg he was desired to heal.* And that there were
many other such stories current is beyond all doubt.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See "Centinela," p. 153.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>What use, if any, Torquemada made of those forged letters and
the stories that were their offspring, we do not know. But it
would be strange if the circulation and acceptance of such
matters displeased him, since they were plainly calculated to
forward his aims and compel the Sovereigns to lend an ear to his
insistent denunciations of the Jews.</p>
<p>Incessantly he preached the need for religious unity in a
united Spain. Indeed, Spain, he urged, never could be united,
never could deserve the blessing of Heaven, until all men in that
land were the children of God, true believers In the Holy Roman
Catholic Apostolic Faith. God had greatly favoured Ferdinand and
Isabella, the friar continued. He had collected the various
elements of the peninsula Into one mighty kIngdom,which Hehad
subjected to their sceptre. Let them fuse those elements into a
solid whole, rejecting all those who resist this fusion&mdash;and
this for the honour and glory of God and of their own
kingdom.</p>
<p>Before this terrific gospel of Religious Unity nothing could
stand. Humanitarian considerations, principles of equity,
indebtedness and gratitude are mere trifles to be swept away by
that hurricane ot religious argument.</p>
<p>The Sovereigns found themselves face to face with an issue of
such a magnitude that no temporal considerations could be allowed
to weigh. And to the pressure of Torquemada's fierce arguments
was added now the pressure of public opinion, cunningly excited
by his lieutenants. To the voice of God from the lips of the
Grand Inquisitor was added now the <i>vox populi</i>&mdash;the
voice of God from the lips of the people.</p>
<p>And so clamorous was this popular voice, so insistent were the
accusations which it levelled against the Israelites, of ritual
Infamies and of seducing back to the Law of Moses their apostate
brethren, that the Jews were warned of the storm that was about
to break over their luckless heads.</p>
<p>Torquemada's demand was that they must receive baptism or
go.</p>
<p>The Sovereigns hesitated still. In Isabella perhaps the voice
of humanity was too strong to be entirely stifled by the dictates
of bigotry.</p>
<p>But Torquemada's strength of purpose was the greater and more
irresistible by virtue of its purity and singleness of aim.
Obviously he was no selfseeker. Obviously he had no worldly ends
to serve. What he demanded, he demanded in the name of the
religion which he served&mdash;solely for the greater honour and
glory of his God; and to sovereigns of the temper of Ferdinand
and Isabella demands so inspired are not easily resisted.</p>
<p>And although it was clear that he sought no worldly advantage
for himself, he did not scruple to use the prospect of the
Sovereigns' worldly advantage as a weapon to combat their
reluctance; he did not hesitate to dangle before their eyes
temporal advantages that must result from the banishment of the
Israelites. To arguments upon religious grounds he added
arguments of worldly expediency, arguments which cannot have
failed of effect upon the acquisitive nature of the King.</p>
<p>Never, urged the Grand Inquisitor, would Spain know
tranquillity whilst she harboured Jews. They were predatory; they
were untrustworthy; their sole objective was the satisfaction of
their pecuniary interest&mdash;the only interest they knew; and
their acquisitiveness would always dispose them to serve any
enemy of the crown so that it should profit them to do so.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," vol. i. p. 182.]</p>
<p>But Torquemada was not the only advocate before the royal
court. The Jews were there, too, pleading on their own behalf,
with an eloquence that seemed for a moment on the point of
prevailing&mdash;for the seductive chink of gold was persuasively
intermingled with their protestations.</p>
<p>They urged their past services to the crown, and promised even
greater services in the future; they swore that henceforth they
would be more observant of the harsh laws formulated by Alfonso
XI&mdash;that they would keep to their ghettos as prescribed,
withdrawing to them at nightfall, and abstaining rigorously from
all such intercourse with Christians as was by law forbidden.
Last and most eloquent argument of all, they offered through
Abraham Seneor and Isaac Abarbanel&mdash;the two Jews who had
undertaken and so admirably effected the equipment of the
Castilian army for the campaign against Granada&mdash;that in
addition to giving this undertaking they would subscribe 30,000
ducats towards the expenses of the war against the Moslem.</p>
<p>Ferdinand's hesitation was increased by this offer. Ever in
need of money as the Sovereigns were, the consideration of this
gold not only tempted them, but it would undoubtedly have
conquered them had not Torquemada been at hand. But for his
violent intervention it is more than probable that the cruel
edict of banishment would never have been promulgated.</p>
<p>The Dominican, learning what was afoot, thrust himself into
their Highnesses' presence to denounce their hesitation, and to
put upon it the name which in his opinion it deserved.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to picture him in that supreme moment. It
is one of those rare occasions on which this being whom we have
compared to a <i>Deus ex machina</i>, a cold stern spirit ruling
and guiding the terrible organization of the Inquisition which he
has himself established, steps forth in the flesh, a living,
throbbing man.</p>
<p>You behold him pale, a little breathless in the excitement and
anger by which he is possessed. His deep-set eyes glow sombrely
with the fever ot fanatical zeal and indignation. He draws his
lean old frame erect. In his shrivelled, sinewy old hands he
flaunts aloft a crucifix.</p>
<p>It is an intense moment. Everything contributes to it: the
long-drawn duel between religion and humanity, between
clericalism and Christianity, of which this is at last the
climax; and nothing so much as the figure offered by the Jews.
This <i>thirty</i> thousand is unfortunately reminiscent. It
permits the Prior of Holy Cross to draw a very daring
parallel.</p>
<p>"Judas," he cries, "once sold the Son of God for thirty
pieces. Your Highnesses think to sell Him again for thirty
thousand. Here you have Him. Sell Him, then, but acquit me of all
share in the transaction."</p>
<p>And, crashing the crucifix upon the table before their
startled Highnesses, he abruptly leaves the chamber.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 143; Llorente,"
Historia Critica," ii. p. 114.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Thus Torquemada conquered.</p>
<p>The edict of expulsion was signed at Granada on March 31 of
that year 1492&mdash;that glorious year in which Spain finally
completed the erection of her monarchy upon the ruins of the old
Visigothic kingdom, and in which the navigator Columbus laid a
new world at the foot of the throne of the Catholic
Sovereigns.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The edict is quoted in full in Appendix
IV. of Amador de los Rios' "Historia de los Judios."]</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-26" name="ch-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI. THE EXODUS FROM
SPAIN</h2>
<p>It was solemnly declared in the edict of expulsion that this
decree was promulgated solely in obedience to the pressing need
to cut off at the roots, once for all time, the evils arising out
ot the intercourse between Christians and Jews, since all other
efforts hitherto undertaken with the same intent had proved
fruitless.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* See the text of the edict in Rios'
"Historia de los Judios," Appendix IV.]</p>
<p>By this edict all Jews of any age and either sex who should
refuse to receive baptism must quit Spain within three months,
and never return, under pain of death and the confiscation of
their property.</p>
<p>The cruelty of this expatriation calls for little exposition.
Spain was the motherland of these Jews. For centuries it had been
the home of their ancestors, and they held it in the affection
implanted in the heart of each of us for the country which is his
own. They must depart out of it, into exile in some foreign land,
and the only terms upon which they could obtain immunity from
that harsh decree was by the sacrifice of something dearer still,
something as dear to them as honour itself. They must be false to
the faith of their fathers and forswear the God of Israel.</p>
<p>That was the choice forced upon the Children of
Judah&mdash;the choice which the arrogant Christian Church had
been forcing upon all men from the moment that she had found
herself mistress of the power to do so.</p>
<p>It was decreed that after the expiry of the three months
allowed them in which to settle their affairs and be gone no
Christian would be suffered to befriend or assist them, to give
them food or shelter, under pain of being called to account as an
abettor of heretics.</p>
<p>Until their departure the persons and property of the exiled
were nominally under the protection of the Sovereigns. They were
permitted to dispose of what property they possessed, and to take
the proceeds with them in bills of exchange* or in merchandise,
but not in gold, which it was forbidden to carry out of the
country.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Amador de los Rios (iii. p. 310) very
reasonably questions their being permitted to take money in bills
of exchange, although the statement is contained in Bernaldez'
"Chronicle," and is mentioned by other contemporaries.]</p>
<p>Little greater would have been the injury done them if their
property had been confiscated outright. For being compelled to
dispose of it at such short notice, and the buyers knowing that
it must be sold, and eager to take advantage of these forced
sales, what chance had the Jews of realizing anything that should
approach its value? How could they avoid the pitiless Christian
exploitation of their miserable position?</p>
<p>"The Christians obtained," says Bernaldez, "much property and
many very rich houses and estates for little money; the Jews went
about offering these, and could not find any buyers, so that they
were forced to barter here a house for an ass, there a vineyard
for a piece of cloth."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia," tom. i. cap. cx.]</p>
<p>From just this passage in the chronicle of an author whose
detestation of the Jews we have earlier considered may be
conceived how terrible was their distress, and how mercilessly
was advantage taken of it by the Christians.</p>
<p>Amador de los Rios adds that entire ghettos entered into the
sacrifice, and that, the Jews being utterly unable to dispose of
such communal property, they were forced to make gifts of it to
the municipalities that had shown them so little pity.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia de los Judios," vol. iii. p.
311.]</p>
<p>Torquemada in his great zeal for the Faith was not content to
leave matters there. His chief aim, after all, was not the
expulsion of the Jews, but their conversion and the effacement of
their creed. As a means to that end was it that he had wrung the
edict of banishment from the Sovereigns.</p>
<p><a id="pic-15" name="pic-15"></a><br></p>
<div align="center"><img src=

<br>
<p style="text-align: center">SANBENITO OF IMPENITENT<br>
From Limborch's "Historia Inquisitionis."</p>
<p>Upon this campaign of conversion he now sent forth his army of
Dominicans. He published an edict, with the royal sanction, in
which he exhorted the Israehtes to receive baptism, laying stress
upon the fact that those who should do so before the expiry of
the three months appointed for their emigration would be entitled
to remain.</p>
<p>In every city, in every village, in every hamlet, in churches,
in market-places, and at street-corners his black-and-white
Dominicans sought by exhortation and argument to induce the Jews
to receive the waters of baptism, thereby securing their
well-being and prosperity in this world and their eternal
salvation in the next. The preachers penetrated to the very
synagogues in their zeal, and exerted themselves even in the
Jewish temples, by the promises they held out of temporal
advantage, to lead the Jews into the fold of Christianity. No
place was sacred from the friars-preachers. In Segovia, when the
hour of departure approached, the Jews spent three days in their
cemetery weeping over the graves of their dead, which they were
abandoning. And there were zealous Dominicans who intruded upon
that sorrow, and seized Ihe opportunity to preach conversion to
that piteous assembly.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Colmenares, "Hist. Segovia," cap. xxxv. §
ix.]</p>
<p>But the response to all these sermons was only slight. If
Torquemada's friars were preaching Christianity on the one hand,
and attempting by argument and bribery to induce the Hebrews to
embrace it, the Rabbis, on the other, were no less energetic in
their efforts to encourage the Israelites to stand firm in their
fidelity to their God, to resist the temptations of corruption,
and to remember that even as God had delivered them out of Egypt
and led them into the Land of Plenty, so in leading them out of
Spain would He see that His children did not suffer loss of
honour or of worldly goods.</p>
<p>Whether the Israelites believed or not, the great body of them
remained staunch, and sooner than accept ease and advancement at
the price of baptism, they firmly envisaged exile and the loss of
their property, which the royal decree inspired by Torquemada
rendered inevitable.</p>
<p>Bernaldez tells us that, notwithstanding the law against
taking gold out of Spain, many of the exiles did take it in large
quantities concealed about them&mdash;which is extremely
probable. Not quite so probable is the common rumour which he
reports, that they reduced many gold ducats to pellets with their
teeth, and then swallowed them upon arriving at seaports or other
places where they were to be searched, thus carrying the gold
away in their stomachs. The women in particular, he says, were
great offenders in this respect, and&mdash;again reporting the
voice of common rumour&mdash;he informs us that some women
contrived to swallow as many as thirty ducats each.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* " Historia," tom. i. cap. cx.]</p>
<p>The story of this swallowed gold evidently got abroad, to add
to their affliction; and we are told that some who sailed from
Cadiz to Fez, and who fell into the hands of Moors upon landing
on the coast of Barbary, were not only plundered of their
belongings, but were in several cases ripped open by these
brigands in their quest for gold.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," vol. i. p. 190.]</p>
<p>Within the little period of three months appointed them, the
Israelites sold or bartered what they could, and abandoned that
for which they found no buyers. All boys and girls of the age of
twelve or more they married, so that each nubile female should
set out under the protection of a husband.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Bernaldez, "Histona," tom. i. p. 339.]</p>
<p>The exodus from Spain began in the first week in July of 1492.
Those amongst the exiles who were wealthy supported their poorer
brethren, in pursuance of the custom that had ever prevailed in
their ghettos. Many who had been very wealthy and masters of
thriving trades abandoned their prosperity, and trusting to what
Bernaldez terms "the vain hope of their blindness," they took the
harsh road into banishment.</p>
<p>The parish priest of Palacios has left us a vivid picture of
this emigration.* It is a picture over which Christianity must
weep in shame.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia," tom. i. cap. cx.]</p>
<p>On foot, on horseback, on donkeys, in carts, young and old,
stalwart and feeble, healthy and ailing, some dying and some
being born, and many falling by the way, they formed forlorn
processions toiling onwards in the heat and dust of that July. On
every road that led out of the country&mdash;on those that went
southwards to the sea, or westwards to Portugal, or eastwards to
Navarre&mdash;these straggling human droves were to be met, and
they presented a spectacle so desolate that there was no
Christian who did not pity them.</p>
<p>Succour them none dared, by virtue of the decree of the Grand
Inquisitor; but on every hand they were exhorted to accept
baptism and thus set a term upon their tribulations. And some,
unable to endure more in their utter exhaustion and hopelessness,
gave way and forswore the God of Israel.</p>
<p>But these were comparatively few. The Rabbis were at hand to
encourage and stimulate them. The women and the young men were
bidden to sing as they marched, and timbrels were sounded to
hearten these wretched multitudes.</p>
<p>The Andalusians made for Cadiz, where it was their intention
to take ship. Those of Aragon also turned towards the coast,
repairing to Cartagena; whilst many Catalans sailed for Italy,
where&mdash;singular anomaly!&mdash;a Catalan Pope (Roderigo
Borgia) was to afford them shelter and protection in the very
heart of the system that was oppressing and persecuting them.</p>
<p>Of those who arrived at Cadiz, Bernaldez says that at sight of
the sea there was great clamour amongst them. Their imaginations
fired by the recent sermons of the Rabbis, in which they had been
likened to their forefathers departing out of the Egyptian
captivity, they confidently expected to behold here a repetition
of the miracle of the Red Sea, and that the waters would separate
to allow them a dry-shod passage into Barbary.</p>
<p>Those who went westwards were permitted by King John of
Portugal to enter his kingdom and abide there for six months upon
payment of a small tax of one cruzado each.* Of these many
settled in Portugal and engaged there in trade, which they were
permitted to do subject to a tribute of l00 cruzados levied on
each family.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* The cruzado is of the value of a florin,
but with the purchasing power then of at least five times that
sum.]</p>
<p>It is no part of our present task to follow the Israelites
into exile and observe the miserable fate that overtook so many
of them, alike at the hands ot the followers of the gentle Christ
and at those of the Children of the Prophet. Many sages and
rabbis were amongst those who abandoned Spain, and in their
number was Isahak Aboab, the last Prince of the Castilian Jews,
and Isaac Abarbanel, the sometime farmer of the royal taxes.</p>
<p>"The expulsion," writes this last, "was accompanied by pillage
on land and sea; and amongst those who, stricken and sorrowful,
set out for foreign lands, was I. With great trouble I contrived
to reach Naples, but I was unable to find any repose there in
consequence of the French invasion. The French were masters of
the city, the very inhabitants having abandoned their Government.
All rose against our congregation, expelling rich and poor, men
and women, fathers and sons of the Children of Zion, and reducing
them to the greatest ruin and misery. Several abandoned their
religion, fearing lest their blood should be shed as water, or
that they might be sold into slavery; for men and women, young
and old, were being carried off in ships without pity for their
lamentations, compelled to abandon their Law and continue in
captivity."</p>
<p>France and England received some of the exiles, others went to
settle in the Far East. Most wretched, perhaps, were those who
landed on the coast of Africa and attempted by way of the desert
to reach Fez, where there was a Jewish colony. They were beset by
a horde of plundering tribesmen, who pillaged them of their
belongings, treated them with the utmost cruelty and inhumanity,
ravished their women under their very eyes, and left them
stripped and utterly broken. Their sufferings had reached the
limit of their endurance. The survivors sought baptism at the
first Christian settlement they reached, and many of these
returned to their native Spain, having thus qualified themselves
for readmission.</p>
<p>There were many otherwise who, similarly unable to endure the
hardships which they met abroad, broke down at last, accepted
baptism and returned, or else returned clamouring for the baptism
that should enable them to dwell in peace in the land of their
birth.</p>
<p>For three years, says Bernaldez, there was a constant stream
of returning Jews, who having abandoned all for their faith, had
now abandoned their faith itself, and came back to make a fresh
start. They were baptized in grouDS, all at once, by the
sprinkling of hyssop over them.* Bernaldez himself baptized a
hundred of them at Palacios, and from what he beheld, "I
considered fulfilled," he writes, "the prophecy of
David&mdash;'Covertentur ad vesperam et famen patiuntur ut canes
et circundabunt civitatem.'"</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia," tom. i. p. 344.]</p>
<p>The priest of Palacios estimates at 36,000 the Jewish families
that accepted banishment,* which would represent some 200,000
souls. But Salazar de Mendoza and Zurita set the total exiles at
twice that number,** whilst Mariana carries it as high as
800,000.*** More reliable perhaps than any of these is the
estimate left by the Jewish writers, who say that in the year
5252 of the Creation 300,000 Jews left Spain, the land in which
their forbears had dwelt for close upon 2,000 years.****</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. p. 338.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[** Zurita, "Anales," lib. i. cap. iv.;

<p class="footnote">[*** "Historia," lib. xxvi. cap. i.]</p>
<p class="footnote">[**** See Amador de los Rios, "Historia de
los Judios," vol. iii. p. 316.]</p>
<p>These figures bring home to us the gravity ot the step taken
by the Sovereigns when they consented to the banishment of the
Jews; and if anything had been wanting to make us appreciate the
irresistible quality of Torquemada and of the fanaticism for
which he stood, these figures would supply it.</p>
<p>The proposed expulsion must fully have been discussed in
council before the edict was promulgated;* and it must have been
obvious that Spain could not fail to be left materially the
poorer if some 40,000 industrious families were driven out. It is
unthinkable that king or councillor should not have raised the
question of the inexpediency, of the positive danger attaching to
such a measure. Yet certain it is that neither councillor nor
king could stand against the stern, uncompromising friar, in whom
they saw the representative of a God that was not to be trifled
with&mdash;a God whom their conceptions transformed into some
vindictive pagan deity.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo states that it was. See "De
Origine," p. 143, and also Salazar de Mendoza, "Monarquia de
España," iii. p. 337.]</p>
<p>Torquemada's crucifix so dramatically flung into the scales
had definitely settled the question.</p>
<p>The Sultan Bajazet, who welcomed and sheltered not a few of
the fugitives in Turkey, was overcome with amazement at this
blunder of statecraft, so that he is reported to have asked
whether this king were seriously to be taken for a great
statesman who impoverished his kingdom to enrich another's.</p>
<p>What the Grand Turk perceived so readily, priestridden
Ferdinand dared not perceive.</p>
<p>In banishing Jew and Moslem from her soil&mdash;for the Moor
was soon to follow, though temporarily permitted to remain by
virtue of the terms of the capitulation of Granada&mdash;Spain
banished her merchants and financiers on the one hand, and her
agriculturists and artisans on the other; in short, she banished
her workers, the productive section of her community. It is
accounted by many that she did so with the fullest consciousness
of the consequences&mdash;an act of heroic sacrifice to principle
and to religious convictions. And it may be that she accounted
herself God-rewarded by the gift of a new world for this
sacrifice to God.</p>
<p>The arts, the industries, manufactures, agriculture, and
commerce have been bewailing for four hundred years the lack of
hands to serve them. The New World proved but an illusory and
transient compensation. Its gold could not furnish Spain with the
workers that she lacked. On the contrary, it increased that lack.
The New World repaid herself with interest for what she gave. In
return for the gifts she poured into the lap of Spain she took to
herself the very children of Spain, luring them overseas with the
fabulous tales of riches easily to be acquired. Driven by this
greed of gold, multitudes of families emigrated to increase the
depopulation of their country. And when, in the course of time,
those children of Spain in the New World had grown to a
sufficient strength to claim their emancipation, they threw off
the yoke of the motherland and distributed among themselves her
vast possessions. They left her bare indeed, who by her own act
was without home-resources, to realize perhaps at last what
manner of service had been rendered her by the Prior of Holy
Cross.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The Moors of Granada, meanwhile, had obtained from Ferdinand a
promise that the Inquisition should not be set up in Granada
within the followingforty years, nor yet any prosecution
instituted of Moriscoes (baptized Moslems) for the observance of
Mohammedan customs.</p>
<p>The term, however, set too great a strain upon priestly
patience. In 1526&mdash;long before the expiry of the period
marked&mdash;the Holy Office crept slyly into Granada upon the
pretext that it was requisite to watch the many suspected
Marranos who had gone to reside there in the shelter of the
immunity enjoyed by the Moriscoes. That it was the merest pretext
is shown by the circumstance that already, as early as 1505, the
Holy Office of Cordova had been moving in Granada and instituting
there, when occasion arose, proceedings against Judaizers.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="ch-27" name="ch-27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII. THE LAST
"INSTRUCTIONS" OF TORQUEMADA</h2>
<p>The expulsion of the Jews may be considered the supreme and
crowning work of Torquemada's life. It marks the high meridian of
his achievement. Hereafter his career dwindles gradually in
importance in a measure as it sinks slowly to its setting.</p>
<p>In Rome, meanwhile, in that year 1492, a new
Pontiff&mdash;Roderigo Borgia&mdash;had ascended the throne of
St. Peter under the title of Alexander VI, and from this Pontiffs
hands Torquemada received his confirmation in the great office
which he held&mdash;a confirmation which, being couched in the
otiose terms of affection not uncommon in papal bulls, seems to
have led many to believe that Alexander viewed Torquemada and the
Holy Office of Spain with particular fondness. As a matter of
fact, this Pope's attempts to curb the excessive rigour of the
Grand Inquisitor were less lethargic&mdash;we dare not say more
energetic&mdash;than those exerted by Sixtus IV and Innocent
VIII; and it was Alexander VI who, weary of complaints, finally
contrived the retirement of the Prior of Holy Cross.</p>
<p>But that was not yet. Before that came to pass, the scandals
of secret absolutions sold and subsequently rescinded by the Holy
See were now repeated. Vigorous appeals were made to the Holy
Father against the procedure of the Grand Inquisitor, and the
Holy Father, acting upon the advice of the Apostolic Court,
dispatched his briefs of absolution. Torquemada, incensed once
more by this fresh interference with his jurisdiction, made his
appeal to the Sovereigns, and jointly with them laid his protests
before the Pope, who complacently cancelled the briefs that had
been paid for&mdash;or rather that part of the absolution which
concerned the temporal courts. For the moneys received it could
be shown that full value had been given, since these absolutions
still held good in the tribunal of conscience. We are familiar by
this time with the argument.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Torquemada's enemies in Spain were increasing now at an
alarming rate. But, secure in the royal protection, this old man
steadily and ruthlessly advanced along the path of intolerance,
undismayed by ill-will. Conscious of the hatred he provoked, he
may have gloried in the maledictions hurled against him by the
persecuted, conceiving that the malevolence of the infidel would
render his deeds the more acceptable in the sight of his God. But
whatever the equanimity with which he may have confronted
spiritual hostility, he took his measures to secure himself from
its temporal manifestations. That he went in dread of attack is
evinced not only by the fact that he was never seen abroad
without his numerous escort of armed familiars, but further by
the circumstance that he never sat down to dine without a horn of
unicorn upon his table as a charm against poison.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 156.]</p>
<p>So arbitrarily and arrogantly did he widen the sphere of
autocratic jurisdiction accorded him that soon he was usurping
the functions of the civil courts, thereby provoking a still
deeper resentment. He conducted the business of the Holy Office
in such a manner that all other courts of the kingdom became
subservient to it, and where the magistrates, resenting these
encroachments, attempted to withstand him, or even to question
his authority, they were&mdash;as had happened in the case of the
Captain-General of Valencia&mdash;promptly charged with lack of
zeal and even impeached as hinderers of the Holy Office. They
were compelled to submit to humiliating penances, which in the
case of magistrates entailed a total loss of dignity and
prestige. And such was the ascendancy this man had gained by now
that complaints or appeals to the Sovereigns were useless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, and by his own act, his enemies at home
had found two powerful mediators with the Pope, two powerful
advocates to plead their cause before the Apostolic Court. These
were Juan Arias Davila, Bishop of Segovia, and Pedro de Aranda,
Bishop of Calahorra.</p>
<p>Torquemada's frenzied intolerance of men of Jewish blood was
by no means confined to those who practised the Law of Moses. It
extended to those who had accepted baptism and to their
descendants, and it kept alive his mistrust of them.</p>
<p>Very markedly is this exhibited in the proceedings he
instituted against the two bishops mentioned, notwithstanding the
Papal decree which inhibited inquisitors from proceeding against
prelates save by special pontifical authority.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Segovia&mdash;Juan Arias Davila&mdash;was the
grandson of a Jew who had received baptism in the reign of Henry
IV, and had held an honourable position at the court of that king
by whom he had been ennobled. Considering the ecclesiastical
eminence attained by his grandson&mdash;now a very old
man&mdash;one would imagine that the latter should have been
secure from inquisitorial attacks on the score of alleged
offences committed by his ancestor against the Faith. But the
terrible Torquemada contrived to rake up some matters against the
long-deceased converso, accused him of having re-Judaized before
his death, and instituted proceedings which must have resulted in
the destitution, degradation and infamy of the bishop, his
descendant.</p>
<p>"It sufficed," says Llorente on this subject,* "that a
deceased Jew should have been fortunate and wealthy to seek cause
of suspicion upon his faith and religion, such was the ill-will
against those of Jewish blood, such the desire to mortify them,
and such the covetousness to absorb their property."</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Critica," tom. ii. p. 125.]</p>
<p>To these proceedings Davila set up a stout resistance and made
appeal to the Pope, whereupon Torquemada experienced his first
serious check. The Pope ordered him to stick to the letter of the
law, and to lay the matter before the Apostolic Court, as was
due. Thither went the Bishop also, to defend his grandfather's
bones from the accusation lodged. He was well received by the
Pontiff, who ultimately gave him the victory over Torquemada, for
when the case was tried his father's memory was cleared of all
guilt.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Colmenares, "Hist Segovia," cap. xxxv.,
and Paramo, "De Origine," lib. ii. cap. iv. Paramo says that the
Bishop had "causa propria" as well as the defence of his
grandfather's bones to take him to Rome.]</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, however, Davila had not only received a very
kindly welcome at the Vatican, but, pending his trial, he was
given a position of honour, and he was associated with Cardinal
Borgia of Monreale (Alexander's nephew) when the latter went as
papal legate to Naples, to crown Alfonso II of Aragon.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Burchard, "Diarium" (Thuasne Ed.), ii. p.
163.]</p>
<p>Less fortunate was Pedro de Aranda, the other accused Bishop.
In his case, too, the proceedings instituted were based upon the
alleged Judaizing of his deceased father&mdash;a Jew who had been
baptized in the time of St. Vincent Ferrer.</p>
<p>His case was tried at Valladolid, but the inquisitors and the
diocesan ordinary disagreed in their findings, and in 1493 the
Bishop, accompanied by his bastard son Alfonso Solares, set out
for Rome, to present in person his appeal to the Pontiff Him,
too, the Pope received with the utmost kindliness. His Holiness
issued a brief inhibiting the inquisitors, and relegating the
case to the Bishop of Cordova and the Prior of the Benedictines
of Valladolid.</p>
<p>The case being tried by them, a verdict entirelyfavourable to
the Bishop was obtained, and his father's memory was acquitted of
the charge preferred against it. But the tribulations of the
living son were not permitted to end there. Torquemada would not
suffer that his prey should escape so easily.</p>
<p>Already in 1488 the Bishop had been defamed by a suspicion of
judaizing, and the Grand Inquisitor now pressed that he should be
called to answer to that charge, forwarding the indictment under
seal to Rome.</p>
<p>Pending the solution of the matter by the Apostolic Court,
Alexander not only treated Aranda well, but heaped honours and
favours upon him and his son. The Bishop was sent to Venice as
papal legate, he was appointed Master of the Sacred Palace,
whilst upon his offspring was conferred the position of apostolic
prothonotary.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Burchard, "Diarium" (Thuasne Ed,), ii. pp.
409 and 494. ]</p>
<p>But despite the papal favour which he enjoyed, and
notwithstanding the fact that he called upwards of a hundred
witnesses to testify in his defence, he was found guilty. It is
said that his own witnesses helped to bring about his conviction.
The Pontifical Court was obliged to sentence him to loss of all
ecclesiastical dignities and benefices, to degrade him and reduce
him to the lay estate, whereafter he was imprisoned in Sant'
Angelo, and there he died a few years later.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Limborch, lib. xiv. cap. 41; Llorente,
"Historia Critica," tom. ii p. 126; Burchard, "Diarium," ii. 494,
iii. 13&mdash;.]</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the sentence of the Apostolic Court, Llorente
finds it impossible to believe that Aranda was really guilty of
Judaizing. "It seems incredible that it should have been so,
considering that he had preserved the reputation of good Catholic
for so long and with such applause that the Queen Donna Isabella
should have named him President of the Council of Castile. His
celebrating the Synodal Council in his bishopric argues zeal for
the purity of religion and its dogmas. That the witnesses called
should have deponed to any words or actions of his that were
contrary to this does not signify as much as may at first appear,
for we know, from a multitude of instances, that to fast on
Sunday, to abstain from work on Saturday, to refuse to eat pork,
to dislike the blood of animals, and other similar matters,
sufficed as grounds upon which to declare a man a Judaizing
heretic, and this notwithstanding that, as any one knows to-day,
these are circumstances not at all at issue with a firm adherence
to the Catholic dogmas."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Hist. Critica," ii. p. 126. It
was alleged against Aranda that in the course of his Judaizing,
when praying he would always say "Gloria Patri" purposely
omitting the "Filio et Spiritu Sancto," that he took food before
celebrating Mass, that he ate meat on Good Fridays and other days
of abstinence, that he denied the efficacy of indulgences, and
did not believe in Hell or Purgatory, and much else. See
Burchard, "Diarium," iii. p. 14.]</p>
<p>His sentence, however, was not pronounced until 1498. Until
then he enjoyed, as we have seen, great favour at the Papal
Court. Taking advantage" of this, he and the Bishop of Segovia
not only acted as mediators to lay their countrymen's grievances
against Torquemada before the Pope, but, in their very natural
resentment at the injustice of the prosecutions instituted
against themselves, they went so far as to urge the Pope to
depose the Grand Inquisitor from his office. And
Llorente&mdash;who states this upon the authority of
Lumbreras&mdash;adds that these petitions would, of themselves,
have prevailed but for the royal protection which Torquemada
continued to enjoy.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Anales," tom. i. p. 214.]<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>But the complaints of the Grand Inquisitor's abuse of his
power continued to pour into Rome. They multiplied to isuch an
extent, they were of such a nature, and they were presented by
Spaniards of such eminence at the court of the Spanish Pontiff
that thrice was Torquemada forced to send an advocate to defend
him before the Holy See.* And in the end Alexander considered it
necessary to take measures to circumvent the royal protection
which continued to oppose the deposition of the Prior of Holy
Cross.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo "De Origiue," p. 156]</p>
<p>Since to depose him were too aggressive a course to adopt
towards the Sovereigns, with whom the Pontiff desired to preserve
the friendliest relations, at least Torquemada's power must be
curtailed. And so, by a brief of June 23, 1494, indited with all
the craft and diplomacy of which Roderigo Borgia was a master, a
brief in which he assures the Grand Inquisitor that *' he
cherishes him in the very bowels of affection for his great
labours in the exaltation of the Faith," and charged with tender
solicitude for Torquemada's failing health, the Pontiff puts
forward these infirmities as a reason for assuming him no longer
equal to discharge single-handed the heavy duties of his office.
Therefore His Holiness considers it desirable to appoint him
assistants who will lighten the labour of his declining
years.</p>
<p>The assistants appointed by Alexander were Martin Ponce de
Leon, a Castilian nobleman who was Archbishop of Messina, Don
Inigo Manrique, Bishop of Cordova (nephew of the prelate of the
same name who was Archbishop of Seville), Don Francisco Sanchez
de la Fuente, Bishop of Avila, sometime Dean of Toledo and
Councillor of the Suprema, and Don Alonso Suarez de Fuentelsaz,
Bishop of Mondonedo, who had also held the position of
inquisitor.</p>
<p>These assistants were equipped by the Pontiff with the amplest
powers&mdash;powers as ample as Torquemada's own&mdash;so that
they were in no sense subservient to the Prior of Holy Cross. The
term "assistant" was a papal euphuism, serving thinly to veil the
fact that Torquemada's autocratic rule was virtually at an
end.</p>
<p>Such was the absolute equality of the authority of each of the
five Grand Inquisitors now in existence, that it was explicitly
set forth that any one of them had power singly to determine any
matter, or singly to conclude any case that might have been
initiated by one of the other four.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lumbreras, quoted by Llorente, "Anales,"
tom. i. p. 215.]</p>
<p>But of the four assistants appointed only two accepted office
jointly with Torquemada. These were the Bishop of Avila and the
Archbishop of Messina, who at once took up their duties.</p>
<p>The Pope went a step further on November 4 following, when by
a supplementary brief he appointed Sanchez de la Fuente (Bishop
of Avila) to be Judge of Appeal in cases of the Faith. And from
now onwards it is to Sanchez de la Fuente that the Pope addresses
his briefs concerning the conduct of the affairs of the Holy
Office. It was to him personally that Alexander gave orders that
when a bishop was unable or unwilling to perform upon an
offending cleric of his diocese the ceremony of degradation, this
should be undertaken by the Bishop of Avila himself, or else by a
bishop by him appointed.</p>
<p>Thus it would seem that Torquemada had virtually been
superseded, and that Sanchez de la Fuente had been rendered his
superior. If so, that superiority cannot have been more than
nominal. In spite ot it, Torquemada remained the guiding spirit
of the Holy Office in Spain, the supreme arbiter and lawgiver, as
we shall see when we come to consider his last "Instructions,"
published in 1498.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>In spite of these measures taken by the Pope with a view to
softening inquisitorial severity and bringing it within more
reasonable bounds, complaints to Rome seem to have continued
unabatedly.</p>
<p>Far from restricting inquisitorial jurisdiction&mdash;as was
intended&mdash;the appointment of these assistant Grand
Inquisitors appears to have widened it. They now went so far as
themselves to sell and dispose of confiscated property&mdash;a
matter which hitherto had been conducted by the officers of the
royal treasury. And this was more than Ferdinand could stomach.
Where humanitarian considerations, where arguments of political
expediency had failed to curb his bigotry, acquisitiveness seems
easily to have carried the victory. So that at last we see the
King himself turning in appeal to the Pope against this despotism
of a court upon which he had conferred the power to become
mightier than himself in his own kingdom.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">SPAIN AND PORTUGAL<br>
From Colmenar's "Délices d'Espagne."</p>
<p>The response to his appeal was the bull of February 1495,
commanding the inquisitors under pain of excommunication to
desist from their course, and never to resort to it again save
under royal sanction. The power to proceed against inquisitors in
case of fraud or irregularity in this matter was vested in the
famous Francisco Ximenes de Cisneros.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," tom. i. p. 222.]</p>
<p>This man, who has been called the Richelieu of Spain, had
risen from very humble beginnings, as a barefoot friar-mendicant,
to the very splendid eminence of Primate of Spain&mdash;in which
office he had just succeeded Cardinal Mendoza, who died in that
year (1495).<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>In the following year Torquemada made his exit from the Court,
where for a decade he had been a figure of an importance second
only to that of the Sovereigns themselves.</p>
<p>Crippled by gout, he withdrew to his monastery at Avila.*
There he now dwelt in retirement, an emaciated old man in his
seventy-sixth year, debilitated and racked with bodily
infirmities, but with all his vigour and energy of mind
unimpaired, his severity as uncompromising as of old, his
conscience entirely at peace in the conviction that he had given
of his best&mdash;indeed, his all&mdash;to the service of his
God.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 159.]</p>
<p>But even now his retirement can have been little more than
physical. His attention continued focussed upon the Inquisition
and engrossed by it. To the last do we find him actively
directing the procedure of that tribunal of the Faith.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1498 he summoned the principal inquisitors of
the kingdom to the monastery of St. Thomas of Avila, to the end
that with himself they might concert the promulgation of further
decrees to check abuses which had crept into the administration
of the justice of the Holy Office, proving inadequate his
enactments of 1484, 1485, and 1488.</p>
<p>These, the fourth "Instructions" of Torquemada, were published
on May 25, 1498. They contain a good deal that seems calculated
to soften the rigour of the earlier decrees, yet much of this is
more or less illusory.</p>
<p>Let us very briefly consider the sixteen articles of which
they consist.</p>
<p>The first three provide: (I) that of the two inquisitors
appointed to each court one shall be a jurist and the other a
theologian, and that they shall not proceed other than jointly to
decree prison, torture, or publication of witnesses; (II) that
the inquisitors shall not permit their officers to bear weapons
in those places where the bearing of weapons is forbidden; (III)
that no one shall be arrested save upon sufficient proof of his
guilt, and that all cases be disposed of with dispatch and not
delayed in the hope of discovering increased justification to
sentence.</p>
<p>This last clause merely repeats an earlier one that we have
already seen, and from this repetition we are led to suppose that
the former expression of the same command had not received proper
attention and obedience. The stipulation that no arrest should be
made save where there was sufficient proof of guilt is not as
generous as it sounds. It is dependent upon what the inquisitors
would consider "sufficient proof"; this is revealed by the
jurisprudence of the Holy Office: the accusation of a spiteful or
malevolent person, or a delation wrung from some wretch under
torture, would be accounted "sufficient proof" to justify the
arrest and its sequel. To abolish the inequitable character of
this it would have been necessary to have rescinded the decree
which accounted "semiplenal proof" sufficient ground for taking
action.</p>
<p>Very merciful in its terms is Article IV, which sets forth
that in proceedings against the dead the inquisitors must absolve
promptly where complete proof of crime is not forthcoming, and
not delay in the hope of obtaining further proof, as legal delays
are very injurious to the children, who are unable to contract
marriage whilst such matters are <i>sub judice</i>. But it comes
a little late in the day. It comes when the great harvest from
the wealthy dead has been safely garnered. Besides, no conditions
imposed could mitigate the horrible rigour of the enactment to
exhume and burn the bones of the dead together with their
effigies, and to reduce the children or grandchildren to
destitution and infamy, even when the person convicted was known
to have died penitent and comforted by the sacraments of the
Church&mdash;in consequence of which, by their own Faith, the
inquisitors believed him to be saved.</p>
<p>Article V provides that when the tribunal shall be short of
money for salary, no further pecuniary penances be imposed than
would be the case if the court had funds in hand.</p>
<p>Conceive, if you can, the notions of equity prevailing in a
tribunal which needed to have it decreed that fines were to be
governed by the offence committed, and not by the court's need of
money at the time!</p>
<p>Similarly illumining is Article VI, which sets forth that
imprisonment or other corporal penances must not be commuted to
fines, and that only the inquisitorsgeneral shall have power to
dispense an offender from wearing the <i>sanbenito</i> and to
rehabilitate the children of heretics so that they shall have
liberty in the matters of apparel and employment.</p>
<p>As Llorente points out,* the very existence of this decree
shows of what abuses of power the inquisitors were guilty for the
purpose of increasing their already considerable profit.</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Historia Critica," tom. ii. p. 77.]</p>
<p>Article VII is thoroughly imbued with the inquisitorial spirit
of mercilessness. It warns inquisitors to be cautious in the
matter of admitting to reconciliation those who confess their
fault after arrest, since, considering how many years have passed
since the institution of the Inquisition, the contumacy of such
offenders may be taken as established.</p>
<p>On the subject of Article VIII, which enjoins inquisitors to
punish false witnesses with public pains, Llorente is
particularly interesting in a commentary:</p>
<p>"Properly to understand this article, it is necessary to
realize that there were two ways of being a false witness: one by
calumniating, another by denying knowledge of heretical words or
deeds upon which a person might be questioned in the course of
proceedings against an accused. I have seen many records of
proceedings against those of this second class, but very rarely
(<i>rarissima vez</i>) any against those of the first. Nor could
it be easy to prove that a calumniator has borne false witness,
for the unfortunate accused would have to guess his identity, and
though he were to guess correctly the court would not admit
it."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* <i>Ibid</i>. ii. p. 78.]</p>
<p>Article IX provides that in no tribunal shall there be two
persons who are related or one who is the servant of another,
even though their respective offices should be entirely different
and separate.</p>
<p>Articles X, XI, and XVI are calculated to increase the secrecy
of inquisitorial proceedings. The first makes provision for the
secret custody of all documents and for punishing any notary who
shall betray his trust; the second enacts that a notary must not
receive the depositions of witnesses save in the presence of the
inquisitor; the last decrees that after the witnesses shall have
been sworn by the inquisitors in the presence of the fiscal, the
latter must withdraw so as not to be present when the delations
are made.</p>
<p>The remaining four articles are concerned with such matters as
the setting up of courts of the Inquisition where these have not
yet been established, the submission of difficult questions that
may arise to the Suprema for decision, the provision of separate
prisons for women and for men, and the stipulation that officers
of the court shall work six hours daily.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing sixteen articles, he promulgated
in that same year special instructions concerning the
<i>personnel</i> of the Holy Office. They speak for themselves,
and very vividly suggest the abuses they were framed to
suppress.</p>
<p>For governors of prisons and constables he decreed that they
must permit no one to visit the prisoners with the exception of
the persons appointed to bear them food, and that these must be
bound by oath to preserve the "secrecy" inviolate, and to examine
all food to ascertain that no written matter is concealed in it.
Food, it is added, shall be conveyed to the prisoners by persons
specially appointed for that duty, and never by a constable or
gaoler.</p>
<p>All officers are to be sworn to preserve inviolate secrecy
upon all things they may see or hear.</p>
<p>Receivers are commanded that in the event of the acquittal of
a person whose property has been sequestered, they must restore
the property according to the inventory drawn up at the time of
effecting the sequestration&mdash;but if there are debts to be
satisfied by such a person, these may be paid by order of the
inquisitors without awaiting the consent of the debtor.</p>
<p>If amongst confiscated property there should be any that is in
litigation, the matter is to be judicially decided; and if it is
found that any property which should have formed part of a
confiscation shall have passed into the hands of third parties,
action Is to be taken to recover it.</p>
<p>Confiscated property is to be sold after thirty days, and the
receivers are not to purchase any under pain of greater
excommunication and a fine of lOO ducats. Each receiver is
authorized to give vouchers for property up to the value of
300,000 maravedis.</p>
<p>For the inquisitors themselves it is provided that upon
assuming office they shall be bound by oath to discharge their
duties well and faithfully and to observe the secrecy; that no
inquisitor or officer of the Inquisition shall receive any gift
of whatsoever nature from a prisoner, under pain of loss of
office and a fine of twice the value of the gift plus 100,000
maravedis, whilst any who shall have knowledge of such matter and
fail to divulge it shall be subject to the same penalty.</p>
<p>Inquisitors are to make oath never to be alone with a
prisoner, and neither an inquisitor nor any officer of the court
shall hold two offices or receive two salaries. Lastly, in any
district where the Inquisition's tribunal is established, the
inquisitors must pay for their own lodgings, and must never
receive any hospitality from <i>conversos</i>.*</p>

<p>We have seen Torquemada's efforts strained to obtain the
fullest possible control over subjects of inquisitorial
jurisdiction in Spain, and to establish himself the sole arbiter
in matters concerning heresies there committed. And we have seen
his frequent conflicts with Rome in consequence of what he
accounted undue interference on the part of the Holy See in
affairs which he considered purely within his own province.
Despite repeated protests which had resulted in the annulment of
absolutions granted by the Apostolic Court, the Holy See had ever
continued to receive those who fled thither from Spain in quest
of a reconciliation that was procurable in Rome upon terms far
easier than were accorded by Torquemada's delegates.</p>
<p>Never, however, had the fugitives to Rome been so numerous as
they were now in the reign of Alexander VI. Never before had so
many Judaizers&mdash;who were liable, if discovered in Spain, to
perpetual prison or the fire&mdash;sought at the hands of the
Pontiff the absolution which, subject to penitence and penance,
the Holy Father was willing and ready to accord them.</p>
<p>On July 29, 1498, an Auto de Fé was held in Rome in the vast
square before St. Peter's, when 180 Spanish Judaizers came to be
reconciled to the Church.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* This is the figure given by Burchard, and
is the most authoritative ("Diarium," ii. 492). Llorente says
"250," and Sanuto ("Diario," i. col. 1029) "zercha 300
marrani."]</p>
<p>It is worth while to take a glance at this, and to mark the
difference between the Act of Faith in the very heart of
Christendom, and the spectacles provided under the same title by
Spanish bigotry and fanaticism.</p>
<p>There were present the Governor of Rome, Juan de Cartagena,
the Spanish Orator at the Vatican, the Apostolic auditors, and
the Master of the Sacred Palace, whilst the Pope himself surveyed
the scene from the balcony above the steps of St. Peter's.</p>
<p>The penitents received the <i>sanbenitos</i>, which were put
on over their ordinary garments, and arrayed in these they
entered St. Peter's. There all were assembled and reconciled,
whereafter they were taken in procession to the Church of Santa
Maria della Minerva. In this temple they put off their
<i>sanbenitos</i>, and each one withdrew to his home without
further bearing the insignia of shame and infamy.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Llorente, "Anales," tom. i. p. 238;
Burchard, "Diarium," ii. pp. 491-2. Sanuto the Venetian diarist
reports the matter from letters received from Rome with a sarcasm
entirely characteristic: "The Pontiff sent some 300 marranos in
penitence to the Minerva, dressed in yellow, candle in iiand:
this was their public penance; the secret one would be of their
money..." ("Diario," i. col. 1029).]</p>
<p>The view taken by Torquemada of a Pope who so Httle understood
what the former considered to be the duties of Christ's earthly
Vicar is to be gathered from the attitude of the Sovereigns in
the matter of these reconciliations, and their
protests&mdash;protests which, beyond doubt, would be inspired by
the Grand Inquisitor.</p>
<p>Alexander advised the Sovereigns in reply&mdash;by a brief of
October 5&mdash;that in according these absolutions one of the
pains imposed upon the penanced was that they must never return
to Spain without the special sanction of the Catholic
Sovereigns.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Lumbreras, quoted by Llorente, "Anales,"
tom. i. p. 238.]</p>
<p>In this manner, clearly, there was no infringement by the
Pontiff of the power relegated to the Spanish inquisitors, since
as long as the penitents remained abroad they were beyond the
jurisdiction of the Holy Office of Spain. As for the prohibition
to return being a part of the penance imposed, it was surely
supererogative, for we cannot think that any of those who had so
fortunately obtained absolution would easily incur the risk of
coming within reach of the talons of a court that would
disregard, or else find a way to cancel or circumvent, the Roman
reconciliation.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>But by the time the brief reached Spain, Frey Tomás de
Torquemada, the arch-enemy of the Jews, had breathed his last in
his beautiful monastery of St. Thomas at Avila.</p>
<p>He passed away in peace, laying down the burden of life and
sinking to sleep with the relief and thankfulness of the
husbandman at the end of a day of diligent, arduous, and
conscientious toil. His honesty of purpose, his integrity, his
utter devotion to the task he had taken up are to be weighed in
the balance of historic judgment against the evil that he wrought
so ardently in the unfaltering conviction that his work was
good.</p>
<p>His name has been execrated and revered at once. He has been
vituperated as a fiend of cruelty, and all but worshipped as a
saint; and there is bias in both judgments&mdash;both are no
better than gratifications of prejudice.</p>
<p>Perhaps Prescott is nearest the truth when he says that
"Torquemada's zeal was of so extraordinary a character that it
may almost shelter itself under the name of insanity.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "History of Ferdinand and Isabella," vol.
i. p. 286.<br>
<br>
Llorente estimates the number of Torquemada's victims at 8,800
burnt, 6,500 burnt in effigy, and 90,000 penanced in various
degrees. These figures, however, are unreliable and undoubtedly
exaggerated, although they are in themselves a correction of his
earlier estimate, which fixes the number of burnt at upwards of
10,000&mdash;an estimate flagrantly preferred by Dr. Rule and
other partisan writers on the subject.]</p>
<p>Garcia Rodrigo speaks of the barbarians of the nineteenth
century who desecrated the monastery of St. Thomas, and whose
"revolutionary hammers" smashed so many of the sepulchral and
other marbles. He turns the medal about for us when he pours his
fierce invective upon anti-religious fanaticism and speaks of
these broken marbles as evidences of "perversity, intolerance,
and want of enlightenment."*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* "Hist. Verdadera," vol. ii, p. 113.]</p>
<p>The anti-religious fanaticism and intolerance must be
admitted. But it must be admitted that they are the inevitable
fruits that fanaticism and intolerance produce. Men reap as they
sow. And what but thistles shall be yielded by the seed of
thistles?</p>
<p>The same author inveighs against the political fanaticism of
Spanish Liberalism, which in the hour of reaction sought fiercely
for the bones of the first Grand Inquisitor. He denounces it
indignantly for disturbing the peace of sepulture. In the main we
share his feelings; and yet can we avoid perceiving here a
measure of retributive justice? Can we fail to see in this
fanatical act the vengeance of humanity for the almost obscene
violation of a thousand graves by that same Grand Inquisitor's
fanaticism?</p>
<p>He was laid to rest in the chapel of his monastery, and his
tomb bore the following simple inscription:</p>
<p align="center">HIC JACET REVERENDUS P. F. THOMAS DE
TURRE-CREMATA<br>
PRIOR SANCTAE CRUCIS, INQUISITOR GENERALIS<br>
HUJUS DOMUS FUNDATOR. OBIIT ANNO DOMINI<br>
MCDLXLVIII, DIE XVI SEPTEMBRIS.*</p>
<p class="footnote">[* Paramo, "De Origine," p. 159.]</p>
<p>But his work survived him. His spirit&mdash;through his
enactments&mdash;continued for three centuries after his death to
be the guiding spirit of the Inquisition, executor of the stern
testament he left inscribed upon the walls of his
monastery&mdash;</p>
