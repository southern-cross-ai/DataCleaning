<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">1. &mdash;A SPORTING PROPOSITION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">OUTSIDE a gilt-lettered door on the seventeenth
floor of a New York office building, a tall young man in a
fur-lined coat stood shivering.</p>

<p>Why did he shiver in that coat? He shivered because he was
fussed, poor chap. Because he was rattled, from the soles of his
custom-made boots to the apex of his Piccadilly hat. A painful,
palpitating spectacle, he stood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the door, the business of the
American branch of that famous marine insurance firm, Lloyds, of
London&mdash;usually termed in magazine articles "The Greatest
Gambling Institution in the World"&mdash;went on oblivious to the
shiverer who approached.</p>

<p>The shiverer, with a nervous movement, shifted his walking-stick
to his left hand, and laid his right on the door-knob. Though he is
not at his best, let us take a look at him. Tall, as has been
noted, perfectly garbed after London's taste, mild and blue as to
eye, blond as to hair. A handsome, if somewhat weak face. Very
distinguished&mdash;even aristocratic&mdash;in appearance.
Perhaps&mdash;the thrill for us democrats here!&mdash;of the
nobility. And at this moment sadly in need of a generous dose of
that courage that abounds&mdash;see any book of familiar
quotations&mdash;on the playing fields of Eton.</p>

<p>Utterly destitute of the Eton or any other brand, he pushed open
the door. The click of two dozen American typewriters smote upon
his hearing. An office boy of the dominant New York race demanded
in loud indiscreet tones his business there.</p>

<p>"My business," said the tall young man weakly, "is with Lloyds,
of London."</p>

<p>The boy wandered off down that stenographer-bordered lane. In a
moment he was back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thacker'll see you," he announced.</p>

<p>He followed the boy, did the tall young man. His courage began
to return. Why not? One of his ancestors, graduate of those playing
fields, had fought at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker sat in plump and genial prosperity before a polished
flat-top desk. Opposite him, at a desk equally polished, sat an
even more polished young American of capable bearing. For an
embarrassed moment the tall youth in fur stood looking from one to
the other. Then Mr. Thacker spoke:</p>

<p>"You have business with Lloyds?"</p>

<p>The tall young man blushed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope to have&mdash;yes." There was in his speech that
faint suggestion of a lisp that marks many of the well-born of his
race. Perhaps it is the golden spoon in their mouths interfering a
bit with their diction.</p>

<p>"What can we do for you?" Mr. Thacker was cold and
matter-of-fact, like a card index. Steadily through each week he
grew more businesslike&mdash;and this was Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The visitor performed a shaky but remarkable juggling feat with
his walking-stick.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

<p>Oh, come, come, thought Mr. Thacker impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well," said the tall young man desperately, "perhaps it would
be best for me to make myself known at once. I am Allan, Lord
Harrowby, son and heir of James Nelson Harrowby, Earl of Raybrook.
And I&mdash;I have come here&mdash;"</p>

<p>The younger of the Americans spoke, in more kindly fashion:</p>

<p>"You have a proposition to make to Lloyds?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Lord Harrowby, and sank with a sigh of relief
into a chair, as though that concluded his portion of the
entertainment.</p>

<p>"Let's hear it," boomed the relentless Thacker.</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby writhed in his chair.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will pardon me," he said, "if I preface
my&mdash;er&mdash;proposition with the statement that it is
utterly&mdash;fantastic. And if I add also that it should be known
to the fewest possible number."</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker waved his hand across the gleaming surfaces of two
desks.</p>

<p>"This is my assistant manager, Mr. Richard Minot," he announced.
"Mr. Minot, you must know, is in on all the secrets of the firm.
Now, let's have it."</p>

<p>"I am right, am I not," his lordship continued, "in the
assumption that Lloyds frequently takes rather unusual risks?"</p>

<p>"Lloyds," answered Mr. Thacker, "is chiefly concerned with the
fortunes of those who go down to&mdash;and sometimes down
into&mdash;the sea in ships. However, there are a number of
nonmarine underwriters connected with Lloyds, and these men have
been known to risk their money on pretty giddy chances. It's all
done in the name of Lloyds, though the firm is not financially
responsible."</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby got quickly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Then it would be better," he said, relieved, "for me to take my
proposition to one of these non-marine underwriters."</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker frowned. Curiosity agitated his bosom.</p>

<p>"You'd have to go to London to do that," he remarked. "Better
give us an inkling of what's on your mind."</p>

<p>His lordship tapped uneasily at the base of Mr. Thacker's desk
with his stick.</p>

<p>"If you will pardon me&mdash;I'd rather not," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," sighed Mr. Thacker.</p>

<p>"How about Owen Jephson?" asked Mr. Minot suddenly.</p>

<p>Overjoyed, Mr. Thacker started up.</p>

<p>"By gad&mdash;I forgot about Jephson. Sails at one o'clock,
doesn't he?" He turned to Lord Harrowby. "The very man&mdash;and in
New York, too. Jephson would insure T. Roosevelt against another
cup of coffee."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand," asked Harrowby, "that Jephson is the man
for me to see?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," beamed Mr. Thacker. "I'll have him here in fifteen
minutes. Richard, will you please call up his hotel?" And as Mr.
Minot reached for the telephone, Mr. Thacker added pleadingly: "Of
course, I don't know the nature of your proposition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," agreed Lord Harrowby politely.</p>

<p>Discouraged, Mr. Thacker gave up.</p>

<p>"However, Jephson seems to have a gambling streak in him that
odd risks appeal to," he went on. "Of course, he's scientific. All
Lloyds' risks are scientifically investigated.
But&mdash;occasionally&mdash;well, Jephson insured Sir Christopher
Conway, K. C. B., against the arrival of twins in his family.
Perhaps you recall the litigation that resulted when triplets put
in their appearance?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say I do not," said Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot set down the telephone. "Owen Jephson is on his way
here in a taxi," he announced.</p>

<p>"Good old Jephson," mused Mr. Thacker, reminiscent. "Why, some
of the man's risks are famous. Take that shopkeeper in the
Strand&mdash;every day at noon the shadow of Nelson's Monument in
Trafalgar Square falls across his door. Twenty years ago he got to
worrying for fear the statue would fall some day and smash his
shop. And every year since he has taken out a policy with Jephson,
insuring him against that dreadful contingency."</p>

<p>"I seem to have heard of that," admitted Harrowby, with the
ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>"You must have. Only recently Jephson wrote a policy for the
Dowager Duchess of Tremayne, insuring her against the unhappy event
of a rainstorm spoiling the garden party she is shortly to give at
her Italian villa. I understand a small fortune is involved. Then
there is Courtney Giles, leading man at the West End Road Theater.
He fears obesity. Jephson has insured him. Should he become too
plump for Romeo roles, Lloyds&mdash;or rather Jephson&mdash;will
owe him a large sum of money."</p>

<p>"I am encouraged to hope," remarked Lord Harrowby, "that Mr.
Jephson will listen to my proposition."</p>

<p>"No doubt he will," replied Mr. Thacker. "I can't say
definitely. Now, if I knew the nature&mdash;"</p>

<p>But when Mr. Jephson walked into the office fifteen minutes
later Mr. Thacker was still lamentably ignorant of the nature of
his titled visitor's business. Mr. Jephson was a small wiry man,
crowned by a vast acreage of bald head, and with the immobile
countenance sometimes lovingly known as a "poker face." One felt he
could watch the rain pour in torrents on the dowager duchess,
Courtney Giles' waist expand visibly before his eyes, the statue of
Nelson totter and fall on his shopkeeper, and never move a muscle
of that face.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to meet your lordship," said he to Harrowby.
"Knew your father, the earl, very well at one time. Had business
dealings with him&mdash;often. A man after my own heart. Always
ready to take a risk. I trust you left him well?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you," Lord Harrowby answered. "Although he will
insist on playing polo. At his age&mdash;eighty-two&mdash;it is a
dangerous sport."</p>

<p>Mr. Jephson smiled.</p>

<p>"Still taking chances," he said. "A splendid old gentleman. I
understand that you, Lord Harrowby, have a proposition to make to
me as an underwriter in Lloyds."</p>

<p>They sat down. Alas, if Mr. Burke, who compiled the well-known
Peerage, could have seen Lord Harrowby then, what distress would
have been his! For a most unlordly flush again mantled that British
check. A nobleman was supremely rattled.</p>

<p>"I will try and explain," said his lordship, gulping a plebeian
gulp. "My affairs have been for some time in rather a chaotic
state. Idleness&mdash;the life of the town&mdash;you gentlemen will
understand. Naturally, it has been suggested to me that I exchange
my name and title for the millions of some American heiress. I have
always violently objected to any such plan. I&mdash;I couldn't
quite bring myself to do any such low trick as that. And
then&mdash;a few months ago on the Continent&mdash;I met a
girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I'm not a clever chap&mdash;really," he went on. "I'm afraid I
can not describe her to you. Spirited&mdash;charming&mdash;" He
looked toward the youngest of the trio. "You, at least,
understand," he finished.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot leaned back in his chair and smiled a most engaging
smile. "Perfectly," he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you," went on Lord Harrowby in all seriousness. "It was
only incidental&mdash;quite irrelevant&mdash;that this young woman
happened to be very wealthy. I fell desperately in love. I am still
in that&mdash;er&mdash;pleasing state. The young lady's name,
gentlemen, is Cynthia Meyrick. She is the daughter of Spencer
Meyrick, whose fortune has, I believe, been accumulated in
oil."</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker's eyebrows rose respectfully.</p>

<p>"A week from next Tuesday," said Lord Harrowby solemnly, "at San
Marco, on the east coast of Florida, this young woman and I are to
be married."</p>

<p>"And what," asked Owen Jephson, "is your proposition?"</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby shifted nervously in his chair.</p>

<p>"I say we are to be married," he continued. "But are we? That is
the nightmare that haunts me. A slip. My&mdash;er&mdash;creditors
coming down on me. And far more important, the dreadful agony of
losing the dearest woman in the world."</p>

<p>"What could happen?" Mr. Jephson wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Did I say the young woman was vivacious?" inquired Lord
Harrowby. "She is. A thousand girls in one. Some untoward
happening, and she might change her mind&mdash;in a flash."</p>

<p>Silence within the room; outside the roar of New York and the
clatter of the inevitable riveting machine making its points
relentlessly.</p>

<p>"That," said Lord Harrowby slowly, "is what I wish you to insure
me against, Mr. Jephson."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean the awful possibility of Miss Cynthia Meyrick's changing
her mind."</p>

<p>Again silence, save for the riveting machine outside. And three
men looking unbelievingly at one another.</p>

<p>"Of course," his lordship went on hastily, "it is understood
that I personally am very eager for this wedding to take place. It
is understood that in the interval before the ceremony I shall do
all in my power to keep Miss Meyrick to her present intention.
Should the marriage be abandoned because of any act of mine, I
would be ready to forfeit all claims on Lloyds."</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker recovered his breath and his voice at one and the
same time.</p>

<p>"Preposterous," he snorted. "Begging your lordship's pardon, you
can not expect hardheaded business men to listen seriously to any
such proposition as that. Tushery, sir, tushery! Speaking as the
American representative of Lloyds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Mr. Jephson. In his eyes shone a queer
light&mdash;a light such as one might expect to find in the eyes of
Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up. "One moment, please. What sum
had you in mind, Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;say one hundred thousand pounds," suggested his
lordship. "I realize that my proposition is fantastic. I really
admitted as much. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One hundred thousand pounds." Mr. Jephson repeated it
thoughtfully. "I should have to charge your lordship a rather high
rate. As high as ten per cent."</p>

<p>Lord Harrow by seemed to be in the throes of mental
arithmetic.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he said finally, "I could not afford one hundred
thousand at that rate. But I could afford&mdash;seventy-five
thousand. Would that be satisfactory, Mr. Jephson?"</p>

<p>"Jephson," cried Mr. Thacker wildly. "Are you mad? Do you
realize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I realize everything, Thacker," said Jephson calmly. "I have
your lordship's word that the young lady is at present determined
on this alliance? And that you will do all in your power to keep
her to her intention?"</p>

<p>"You have my word," said Lord Harrowby. "If you should care to
telegraph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your word is sufficient," said Jephson. "Mr. Minot, will you be
kind enough to bring me a policy blank?"</p>

<p>"See here, Jephson," foamed Thacker. "What if this thing should
get into the newspapers? We'd be the laughing-stock of the business
world."</p>

<p>"It mustn't," said Jephson coolly.</p>

<p>"It might," roared Thacker.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot arrived with a blank policy, and Mr. Jephson sat down
at the young man's desk.</p>

<p>"One minute," said Thacker. "The faith of you two gentlemen in
each other is touching, but I take it the millennium is still a few
years off." He drew toward him a blank sheet of paper, and wrote.
"I want this thing done in a businesslike way, if it's to be done
in my office." He handed the sheet of paper to Lord Harrowby. "Will
you read that, please?" he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly." His lordship read: "I hereby agree that in the
interval until my wedding with Miss Cynthia Meyrick next Tuesday
week I will do all in my power to put through the match, and that
should the wedding be called off through any subsequent direct act
of mine, I will forfeit all claims on Lloyds."</p>

<p>"Will you sign that, please?" requested Mr. Thacker.</p>

<p>"With pleasure." His lordship reached for a pen.</p>

<p>"You and I, Richard," said Mr. Thacker, "will sign as witnesses.
Now, Jephson, go ahead with your fool policy."</p>

<p>Mr. Jephson looked up thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Shall I say, your lordship," he asked, "that if, two weeks from
to-day the wedding has not taken place, and has absolutely no
prospect of taking place, I owe you seventy-five thousand
pounds?"</p>

<p>"Yes." His lordship nodded. "Provided, of course, I have not
forfeited by reason of this agreement. I shall write you a check,
Mr. Jephson."</p>

<p>For a time there was no sound in the room save the scratching of
two pens, while Mr. Thacker gazed open-mouthed at Mr. Minot, and
Mr. Minot light-heartedly smiled back. Then Mr. Jephson reached for
a blotter.</p>

<p>"I shall attend to the London end of this when I reach there
five days hence," he said. "Perhaps I can find another underwriter
to share the risk with me."</p>

<p>The transaction was completed, and his lordship rose to go.</p>

<p>"I am at the Plaza," he said, "if any difficulty should arise.
But I sail to-night for San Marco&mdash;on the yacht of a friend."
He crossed over and took Mr. Jephson's hand. "I can only hope, with
all my heart," he finished feelingly, "that you never have to pay
this policy."</p>

<p>"We're with your lordship there," said Mr. Thacker sharply.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you have been very kind," replied Lord Harrowby. "I
wish you all&mdash;good day."</p>

<p>And shivering no longer, he went away in his fine fur coat.</p>

<p>As the door closed upon the nobleman, Mr. Thacker turned
explosively on his friend from oversea.</p>

<p>"Jephson," he thundered, "you're an idiot! A rank unmitigated
idiot!"</p>

<p>The Peter Pan light was bright in Jephson's eyes.</p>

<p>"So new," he half-whispered. "So original! Bless the boy's
heart. I've been waiting forty years for a proposition like
that."</p>

<p>"Do you realize," Thacker cried, "that seventy-five thousand
pounds of your good money depends on the honor of Lord
Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"I do," returned Jephson. "And I would not be concerned if it
were ten times that sum. I know the breed. Why, once&mdash;and you,
Thacker, would have called me an idiot on that occasion,
too&mdash;I insured his father against the loss of a polo game by a
team on which the earl was playing. And he played like the
devil&mdash;the earl did&mdash;won the game himself. Ah, I know
the breed."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," sighed Thacker, "I won't argue. But one thing is
certain, Jephson. You can't go back to England now. Your place is
in San Marco with one hand on the rope that rings the wedding
bells."</p>

<p>Jephson shook his great bald head.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I must return to-day. It is absolutely
necessary. My interests in San Marco are in the hands of
Providence."</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker walked the floor wildly.</p>

<p>"Providence needs help in handling a woman," he protested. "Miss
Meyrick must not change her mind. Some one must see that she
doesn't. If you can't go yourself&mdash;" He paused, reflecting.
"Some young man, active, capable&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Minot had risen from his chair, and was moving
softly toward his overcoat. Looking over his shoulder, he beheld
Mr. Thacker's keen eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"Just going out to lunch," he said guiltily.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Richard," remarked Mr. Thacker with decision.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot sat, the dread of something impending in his
heart.</p>

<p>"Jephson," said Mr. Thacker, "this boy here is the son of a man
of whom I was very fond. His father left him the means to squander
his life on clubs and cocktails if he had chosen&mdash;but he
picked out a business career instead. Five years ago I took him
into this office, and he has repaid me by faithful, even brilliant
service. I would trust him with&mdash;well, I'd trust him as far as
you'd trust a member of your own peerage."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Mr. Jephson.</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker wheeled dramatically and faced his young
assistant.</p>

<p>"Richard," he ordered, "go to San Marco. Go to San Marco and see
to it that Miss Cynthia Meyrick does not change her mind."</p>

<p>A gone feeling shot through Mr. Minot in the vicinity of his
stomach. It was possible that he really needed that lunch.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said faintly. "Of course, it's up to me to do
anything you say. If you insist, I'll go, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, Richard?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a rather big order? Women&mdash;aren't they like
an&mdash;er&mdash;April afternoon&mdash;or something of that sort?
It seems to me I've read they were&mdash;in books."</p>

<p>"Humph," snorted Mr. Thacker. "Is your knowledge of the ways of
women confined to books?"</p>

<p>A close observer might have noted the ghost of a smile in Mr.
Minot's clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"In part, it is," he admitted. "And then again&mdash;in part,
it isn't."</p>

<p>"Well, put away your books, my boy," said Mr. Thacker. "A nice,
instructive little vacation has fallen on you from heaven. Mad old
Jephson here must be saved from himself. That wedding must take
place&mdash;positively, rain or shine. I trust you to see that it
does, Richard."</p>

<p>Mr. Minot rose and stepped over to his hat and coat.</p>

<p>"I'm off for San Marco," he announced blithely. His lips were
firm but smiling. "The land of sunshine and flowers&mdash;and
orange blossoms or I know the reason why."</p>

<p>"Jephson trusts Harrowby," said Mr. Thacker. "All very well. But
just the same if I were you I'd be aboard that yacht to-night when
it leaves New York harbor. Invited or uninvited."</p>

<p>"I must ask," put in Mr. Jephson hurriedly, "that you do nothing
to embarrass Lord Harrowby in any way."</p>

<p>"No," said Thacker. "But keep an eye on him, my boy. A keen and
busy eye."</p>

<p>"I will," agreed Mr. Minot. "Do I look like Cupid, gentlemen?
No? Ah&mdash;it's the overcoat. Well, I'll get rid of that in
Florida. I'll say good-by&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook hands with Jephson and with Thacker.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Richard," said the latter. "I'm really fond of old
Jephson here. He's been my friend in need&mdash;he mustn't lose. I
trust you, my boy."</p>

<p>"I won't disappoint you," Dick Minot promised. A look of
seriousness flashed across his face. "Miss Cynthia Meyrick changes
her mind only over my dead body."</p>

<p>He paused for a second at the door, and his eyes grew suddenly
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she's like?" he murmured.</p>

<p>Then, with a smile toward the two men left behind, he went out
and down that stenographer bordered lane to San Marco.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">2. &mdash;AN EVENING IN THE RIVER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH San Marco is a particularly gaudy tassel on
the fringe of the tourist's South, it was to the north that Mr.
Richard Minot first turned. One hour later he made his appearance
amid the gold braid and dignity of the Plaza lobby.</p>

<p>The young man behind the desk&mdash;an exquisite creature done
in Charles Dana Gibson's best manner&mdash;knew when to be affable.
He also knew when not to be affable. Upon Mr. Minot he turned the
cold fishy stare he kept for such as were not guests under his
charge.</p>

<p>"What is your business with Lord Harrowby?" he inquired
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Since when," asked Mr. Minot brightly, "have you been in his
lordship's confidence?"</p>

<p>This was the young man's cue to wince. But hotel clerks are
notoriously poor wincers.</p>

<p>"It is customary&mdash;" he began with perfect poise.</p>

<p>"I know," said Mr. Minot. "But then, I'm a sort of a friend of
his lordship."</p>

<p>"A sort of a friend?" How well he lifted his eyebrows!</p>

<p>"Something like that. I believe I'm to be best man at his
wedding."</p>

<p>Ah, yes; that splendid young man knew when to be affable.
Affability swamped him now.</p>

<p>"Boy!" he cried. "Take this gentleman's card to Lord
Harrowby."</p>

<p>A bell-boy in a Zenda uniform accepted the card, laid it upon a
silver tray, glued it down with a large New York thumb, and strayed
off down gilded corridors shouting, "Lord Harrowby."</p>

<p>Whereat all the pretty little debutantes who happened to be
decorating the scene at the moment felt their pampered hearts go
pit-a-pat and, closing their eyes, saw visions and dreamed
dreams.</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby was at luncheon, and sent word for Mr. Minot to
join him. Entering the gay dining-room, Minot saw at the far end
the blond and noble head he sought. He threaded his way between the
tables. Although he was an unusually attractive young man, he had
never experienced anything like the array of stares turned upon him
ere he had gone ten feet. "What the devil's the matter?" he asked
himself. "I seem to be the cynosure of neighboring eyes, and then
some." He did not dream that it was because he was passing through
a dining-room of democrats to grasp the hand of a lord.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I'm delighted, I assure you&mdash;" Really,
Lord Harrowby's face should have paid closer attention to his
words. Just now it failed ignominiously in the matter of backing
them up.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Mr. Minot replied. "Your lordship is no doubt
surprised at seeing me so soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;not at all. Shall I order luncheon?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I had a bite on the way up." And Mr. Minot dropped
into the chair which an eager waiter held ready. "Lord Harrowby, I
trust you are not going to be annoyed by what I have to tell
you."</p>

<p>His lordship's face clouded, and worry entered the mild blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope there's nothing wrong about the policy."</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever. Lord Harrowby, Mr. Jephson trusts
you&mdash;implicitly."</p>

<p>"So I perceived this morning. I was deeply touched."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;er&mdash;touching." Minot smiled a bit cynically.
"Understanding as you do how Mr. Jephson feels toward you, you will
realize that it is in no sense a reflection on you that our office,
viewing this matter in a purely business light, has decided that
some one must go to San Marco with you. Some one who will protect
Mr. Jephson's interests."</p>

<p>"Your office," said his lordship, reflecting. "You mean Mr.
Thacker, don't you?"</p>

<p>Could it be that the fellow was not so slow as he seemed?</p>

<p>"Mr. Thacker is the head of our office," smiled Mr. Minot. "It
has been thought best that some one go with you, Lord Harrowby.
Some one who will work night and day to see to it that Miss Meyrick
does not change her mind. I&mdash;I am the some one. I hope you are
not annoyed."</p>

<p>"My dear chap! Not in the least. When I said this morning that I
was quite set on this marriage, I was frightfully sincere." And now
his lordship's face, frank and boyish, in nowise belied his words.
"I shall be deeply grateful for any aid Lloyds can give me. And I
am already grateful that Lloyds has selected you to be my
ally."</p>

<p>Really, very decent of him. Dick Minot bowed.</p>

<p>"You go south to-night?" he ventured.</p>

<p>"Yes. On the yacht <i>Lileth</i>, belonging to my friend, Mr.
Martin Wall. You have heard of him?"</p>

<p>"No. I can't say that I have."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I understood he was very well-known here. A big, bluff,
hearty chap. We met on the steamer coming over and became very good
friends."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"You will enjoy meeting Mr. Wall," said his lordship meaningly,
"when I introduce you to him&mdash;in San Marco."</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby," said Minot slowly, "my instructions are to go
south with you&mdash;on the yacht."</p>

<p>For a moment the two men stared into each other's eyes. Then
Lord Harrowby pursed his thin lips and gazed out at Fifth Avenue,
gay and colorful in the February sun.</p>

<p>"How extremely unfortunate," he drawled. "It is not my boat, Mr.
Minot. If it were, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to
extend an invitation to you."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Minot. "But I am to go&mdash;invited or
uninvited."</p>

<p>"In my interests?" asked Harrowby sarcastically.</p>

<p>"As the personal conductor of the bridegroom."</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot&mdash;really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no wish to be rude, Lord Harrowby. But it is our turn to
be a little fantastic now. Could anything be more fantastic than
boarding a yacht uninvited?"</p>

<p>"But Miss Meyrick&mdash;on whom, after all, Mr. Jephson's fate
depends&mdash;is already in Florida."</p>

<p>"With her lamp trimmed and burning. How sad, your lordship, if
some untoward event should interfere with the coming of the
bridegroom."</p>

<p>"I perceive," smiled Lord Harrowby, "that you do not share Mr.
Jephson's confidence in my motives."</p>

<p>"This is New York, and a business proposition. Every man in New
York is considered guilty until he proves himself
innocent&mdash;and then we move for a new trial."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless"&mdash;Lord Harrowby's mouth hardened&mdash;"I
must refuse to ask you to join me on the <i>Lileth</i>."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me where the boat is anchored?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the North River, I believe. I don't know,
really."</p>

<p>"You don't know? Won't it be a bit difficult&mdash;boarding a
yacht when you don't know where to find it?"</p>

<p>"My dear chap&mdash;" began Harrowby angrily.</p>

<p>"No matter." Mr. Minot stood up. "I'll say au revoir, Lord
Harrowby&mdash;until to-night."</p>

<p>"Or until we meet in San Marco." Lord Harrowby regained his good
nature. "I'm extremely sorry to be so impolite. But I believe we're
going to be very good friends, none the less."</p>

<p>"We're going to be very close to each other, at any rate," Minot
smiled. "Once more&mdash;au revoir, your lordship."</p>

<p>"Pardon me&mdash;good-by," answered Lord Harrowby with
decision.</p>

<p>And Richard Minot was again threading his way between awed
tables.</p>

<p>Walking slowly down Fifth Avenue, Mr. Minot was forced to admit
that he had not made a very auspicious beginning in his new role.
Why had Lord Harrowby refused so determinedly to invite him aboard
the yacht that was to bear the eager bridegroom south? And what was
he to do now? Might he not discover where the yacht lay, board it
at dusk, and conceal himself in a vacant cabin until the party was
well under way? It sounded fairly simple.</p>

<p>But it proved otherwise. He was balked from the outset. For two
hours, in the library of his club, in telephone booths and
elsewhere, he sought for some tangible evidence of the existence of
a wealthy American named Martin Wall and a yacht called the
<i>Lileth</i>. City directories and yacht club year books alike
were silent. Myth, myth, myth, ran through Dick Minot's mind.</p>

<p>Was Lord Harrowby&mdash;as they say at the Gaiety&mdash;spoofing
him? He mounted to the top of a bus, and was churned up Riverside
Drive. Along the banks of the river lay dozens of yachts,
dismantled, swathed in winter coverings. Among the few that
appeared ready to sail his keen eye discerned no <i>Lileth</i>.</p>

<p>Somewhat discouraged, he returned to his club and startled a
waiter by demanding dinner at four-thirty in the afternoon. Going
then to his rooms, he exchanged his overcoat for a sweater, his hat
for a golf cap. At five-thirty, a spy for the first time in his
eventful young life, he stood opposite the main entrance of the
Plaza. Near by ticked a taxi, engaged for the evening.</p>

<p>An hour passed. Lights, laughter, limousines, the cold moon
adding its brilliance to that already brilliant square, the winter
wind sighing through the bare trees of the park&mdash;New York
seemed a city of dreams. Suddenly the chauffeur of Minot's taxi
stood uneasily before him.</p>

<p>"Say, you ain't going to shoot anybody, are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;you needn't be afraid of that."</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid. I just thought I'd take off my license number
if you was."</p>

<p>Ah, yes&mdash;New York! City of beautiful dreams!</p>

<p>Another hour slipped by. And only the little taxi meter was
busy, winking mechanically at the unresponsive moon.</p>

<p>At eight-fifteen a tall blond man, in a very expensive fur coat
which impressed even the cab starter, came down the steps of the
hotel. He ordered a limousine and was whirled away to the west. At
eight-fifteen and a half Mr. Minot followed.</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby's car proceeded to the drive and, turning, sped
north between the moonlit river and the manlit apartment-houses. In
the neighborhood of One Hundred and Tenth Street it came to a stop,
and as Minot's car passed slowly by, he saw his lordship standing
in the moonlight paying his chauffeur. Hastily dismissing his own
car, he ran back in time to see Lord Harrowby disappear down one of
the stone stairways into the gloom of the park that skirts the
Hudson. He followed.</p>

<p>On and on down the steps and bare wind-swept paths he hurried,
until finally the river, cold, silvery, serene, lay before him.
Some thirty yards from shore he beheld the lights of a yacht
flashing against the gloomy background of Jersey. The
<i>Lileth</i>!</p>

<p>He watched Lord Harrowby cross the railroad tracks to a small
landing, and leap from that into a boat in charge of a solitary
rower. Then he heard the soft swish of oars, and watched the boat
draw away from shore. He stood there in the shadow until he had
seen his lordship run up the accommodation ladder to the
<i>Lileth</i>'s deck.</p>

<p>He, too, must reach the <i>Lileth</i>, and at once. But how? He
glanced quickly up and down the bank. A small boat was tethered
near by&mdash;he ran to it, but a chain and padlock held it firmly.
He must hurry. Aboard the yacht, dancing impatiently on the bosom
of Hendrick Hudson's important discovery, he recognized the
preparations for an early departure.</p>

<p>Minot stood for a moment looking at the wide wet river. It was
February, yes, but February of the mildest winter New York had
experienced in years. At the seashore he had always dashed boldly
in while others stood on the sands and shivered. He dashed in
now.</p>

<p>The water was cold, shockingly cold. He struck out swiftly for
the yacht. Fortunately the accommodation ladder had not yet been
taken up; in another moment he was clinging, a limp and dripping
spectacle, to the rail of the <i>Lileth</i>.</p>

<p>Happily that side of the deck was just then deserted. A row of
outside cabin doors in the bow met Minot's eye. Stealthily he
swished toward them.</p>

<p>And, in the last analysis, the only thing between him and them
proved to be a large commanding gentleman, whose silhouette was
particularly militant and whose whole bearing was unfavorable.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wall, I presume," said Minot through noisy teeth.</p>

<p>"Correct," said the gentleman. His voice was sharp, unfriendly.
But the moonlight, falling on his face, revealed it as soft,
genial, pudgy&mdash;the inviting sort of countenance to which,
under the melting influence of Scotch and soda, one feels like
relating the sad story of one's wasted life.</p>

<p>Though soaked and quaking, Mr. Minot aimed at nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you might be good enough to tell Lord Harrowby
that I've arrived."</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I'm a friend of his lordship. He'll be delighted, I'm sure.
Just tell him, if you'll be so kind."</p>

<p>"Did he invite you aboard?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But he'll be glad to see me. Especially if you
mention just one word to him."</p>

<p>"What word?"</p>

<p>Mr. Minot leaned airily against the rail.</p>

<p>"Lloyds," he said.</p>

<p>An expression of mingled rage and dismay came into the pudgy
face. It purpled in the moonlight. Its huge owner came
threateningly toward the dripping Minot.</p>

<p>"Back into the river for yours," he said savagely.</p>

<p>Almost lovingly&mdash;so it might have seemed to the casual
observer&mdash;he wound his thick arms about the dripping Minot. Up
and down the deck they turkey-trotted.</p>

<p>"Over the rail and into the river," breathed Mr. Wall on Minot's
damp neck.</p>

<p>Two large and capable sailormen came at sound of the
struggle.</p>

<p>"Here, boys," Wall shouted. "Help me toss this guy over."</p>

<p>Willing hands seized Minot at opposite poles.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;" counted the sailormen.</p>

<p>"Well, good night, Mr. Wall," remarked Minot.</p>

<p>"Three!"</p>

<p>A splash, and he was ingloriously in the cold river again. He
turned to the accommodation ladder, but quick hands drew it up.
Evidently there was nothing to do but return once more to little
old New York.</p>

<p>He rested for a moment, treading water, seeing dimly the tall
homes of the cave dwellers, and over them the yellow glare of
Broadway. Then he struck out. When he reached the shore, and
turned, the <i>Lileth</i> was already under way, moving slowly down
the silver path of the moon. An old man was launching the padlocked
rowboat.</p>

<p>"Great night for a swim," he remarked sarcastically.</p>

<p>"L-lovely," chattered Minot. "Say, do you know anything about
the yacht that's just steamed out?"</p>

<p>"Not as much as I'd like ter. Used ter belong to a man in
Chicago. Yesterday the caretaker told me she'd been rented fer the
winter. Seen him to-night in a gin mill with money to throw to the
birds. Looks funny to me."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Man came this afternoon and painted out her old name. Changed
it t' <i>Lileth</i>. Mighty suspicious."</p>

<p>"What was the old name?"</p>

<p>"The Lady Evelyn. If I was you, I'd get outside a drink, and
quick. Good night."</p>

<p>As Minot dashed up the bank, he heard the swish of the old man's
oars behind. He ran all the way to his rooms, and after a hot bath
and the liquid refreshment suggested by the waterman, called Mr.
Thacker on the telephone.</p>

<p>"Well, Richard?" that gentleman inquired.</p>

<p>"Sad news. Little Cupid's had a set-back. Tossed into the Hudson
when he tried to board the yacht that is taking Lord Harrowby
south."</p>

<p>"No? Is that so?" Mr. Thacker's tone was contemplative. "Well,
Richard, the Palm Beach Special leaves at midnight. Better be on
it. Better go down and help the bride with her trousseau."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'll do that. And I'll see to it that she has her
lamp trimmed and burning. Considering that her father's in the oil
business, that ought not to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't hear you, Richard. What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Thacker. Look up a yacht called the
Lady Evelyn. Chicago man, I think&mdash;find out if he's rented it,
and to whom. It's the boat Harrowby went south on."</p>

<p>"All right, Richard. Good-by, my boy. Write me whenever you need
money."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can't write as often as that. But I'll send you
bulletins from time to time."</p>

<p>"I depend on you, Richard. Jephson must not lose."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me. The Palm Beach Special at midnight. And after
that&mdash;Miss Cynthia Meyrick.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">3. &mdash;JOURNEYS END IN&mdash;TAXI
BILLS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NO matter how swiftly your train has sped through
the Carolinas and Georgia, when it crosses the line into Florida a
wasting languor overtakes it. Then it hesitates, sighs and creeps
across the flat yellow landscape like an aged alligator. Now and
again it stops completely in the midst of nothing, as who should
say: "You came down to see the South, didn't you? Well, look about
you."</p>

<p>The Palm Beach Special on which Mr. Minot rode was no exception
to this rule. It entered Florida and a state of innocuous desuetude
at one and the same time. After a tremendous struggle, it gasped
its way into Jacksonville about nine o'clock of the Monday morning
following. Reluctant as Romeo in his famous exit from Juliet's
boudoir, it got out of Jacksonville an hour later. And San Marco
was just two hours away, according to that excellent book of light
fiction so widely read in the South&mdash;the time-table.</p>

<p>It seemed to Dick Minot that he had been looking out of a car
window for a couple of eternities. Save for the diversion at
Jacksonville, nothing had happened to brighten that long and
wearisome journey. He wanted, now, to glance across the car aisle
toward the diversion at Jacksonville. Yet it hardly seemed
polite&mdash;so soon. Wherefore he continued to gaze out at the
monotonous landscape.</p>

<p>For half a mile the train served its masters. Then, with a
pathetic groan, it paused. Still Mr. Minot gazed out the window. He
gazed so long that he saw a family of razor-backs, passed a quarter
of a mile back, catch up with the train and trot scornfully by.
After that he kept his eyes on the live oaks and evergreens, to
whose topmost branches hung gray moss like whiskers on a western
senator.</p>

<p>Then he could stand it no longer. He turned and looked upon the
diversion at Jacksonville. Gentlemen of the jury&mdash;she was
beautiful. The custodian of a library of books on sociology could
have seen that with half an astigmatic eye. Her copper-colored hair
flashed alluringly in that sunny car; the curve of her cheek would
have created a sensation in the neighborhood where burning Sappho
loved and sang. Dick Minot's heart beat faster, repeating the
performance it had staged when she boarded the train at
Jacksonville.</p>

<p>Beautiful, yes&mdash;but she fidgeted. She had fidgeted madly in
the station at Jacksonville during that hour's wait; now even more
madly she bounced about on that plush seat. She opened and shut
magazines, she straightened her pleasant little hat, she gazed in
agony out the window. Beauty such as hers should have been framed
in a serene and haughty dignity. Hers happened to be framed in a
frenzy of fidget.</p>

<p>In its infinite wisdom, the train saw fit to start again. With a
sigh of relief, the girl sank back upon her seat of torture. Mr.
Minot turned again to the uneventful landscape. More yellow sand,
more bearded oaks and evergreens. And in a moment, the family of
razor-backs, plodding along beside the track with a determined
demeanor that said as plainly as words: "You may go ahead&mdash;but
we shall see what we shall see."</p>

<p>Excellent train, it seemed fairly to fly. For a little while.
Then another stop. Beauty wildly anxious on the seat of ancient
plush. Another start&mdash;a stop&mdash;and a worried but musical
voice in Dick Minot's ear:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;but what should you say are this
train's chances for reaching San Marco by one o'clock?"</p>

<p>Minot turned. Brown eyes and troubled ones looked into his. A
dimple twitched beside an adorable mouth. Fortunate Florida,
peopled with girls like this.</p>

<p>"I should say," smiled Mr. Minot, "about the same as those of
the famous little snowball that strayed far from home."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you're right!" Why would she fidget so? "And I'm in a
frightfully uncomfortable position. I simply must reach San Marco
for luncheon at one. I must!" She clenched her small hands. "It's
the most important luncheon of my life. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>Mr. Minot glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"It is now twenty minutes of twelve," he said. "My advice to you
is to order lunch on the train."</p>

<p>"It was so foolish of me," cried the girl. "I ran up to
Jacksonville in a friend's motor to do a little shopping. I should
have known better. I'm always doing things like this."</p>

<p>And she looked at Dick Minot accusingly, as though it were he
who always put her up to them.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, really," Minot said. He felt quite
uncomfortable about it.</p>

<p>"And can't you suggest anything?"&mdash;pleadingly, almost
tearfully.</p>

<p>"Not at this moment. I'll try, though. Look!" He pointed out the
window. "That family of razor-backs has caught up with us four
times already."</p>

<p>"What abominable service," the girl cried. "But&mdash;aren't
they cunning? The little ones, I mean."</p>

<p>And she stood looking out with a wonderful tenderness in her
eyes, which, considering the small creatures upon which it was
lavished, was almost ludicrous.</p>

<p>"Off again," cried Minot.</p>

<p>And they were. The girl sat nervously on the edge of her seat,
with the expression of one who meant to keep the train going by
mental suggestion. Five cheerful minutes passed in rapid transit.
And then&mdash;another abrupt stop.</p>

<p>"Almost like a football game," said Minot blithely to the
distressed lady across the aisle. "Third down&mdash;five yards to
go. Oh, by jove, there's a town on my side."</p>

<p>"Not a trace of a town on mine," she replied.</p>

<p>"It's the dreariest, saddest town I ever saw," Minot remarked.
"So of course its name is Sunbeam. And look&mdash;what do you
see&mdash;there beside the station!"</p>

<p>"An automobile!" the girl cried.</p>

<p>"Well, an automobile's ancestor, at any rate," laughed Minot.
"Vintage of 1905. Say&mdash;I have a suggestion now. If the
chauffeur thinks he can get you&mdash;I mean, us&mdash;to San Marco
by one o'clock, shall we&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the girl was already on her way.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Her eyes were bright with excitement. "We&mdash;oh,
dear&mdash;the old train's started again."</p>

<p>"No matter&mdash;I'll stop it!" Minot reached for the bell
cord.</p>

<p>"But do you dare&mdash;can't you be arrested?"</p>

<p>"Too late&mdash;I've done it. Let me help you with those
magazines. Quick! This way."</p>

<p>On the platform they met an irate conductor, red and
puffing.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;who stopped this train?" he bellowed.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;who usually stops it?" Minot replied, and he
and the girl slid by the uniform to the safety of Sunbeam.</p>

<p>The lean, lank, weary native who lolled beside the passe
automobile was startled speechless for a moment by the sight of two
such attractive visitors in his unattractive town. Then he
remembered.</p>

<p>"Want a taxi, mister?" he inquired. "Take you up to the Sunbeam
House for a quarter apiece&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, we do want a taxi&mdash;" Minot began.</p>

<p>"To San Marco," cried the girl breathlessly. "Can you get us
there by one o'clock?"</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to&mdash;say, lady," stammered the rustic chauffeur.
"That train you just got off of is going to San Marco."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it isn't," Minot explained. "We know better. It's going
out into the country to lie down under a shade tree and rest."</p>

<p>"The train is too slow," said the girl. "I must be in San Marco
before one o'clock. Can you get me&mdash;us&mdash;there by then?
Speak quickly, please."</p>

<p>The effect of this request on the chauffeur was to induce even
greater confusion.</p>

<p>"T &mdash;to&mdash;to San Marco," he stumbled. "W&mdash;well,
say, that's a new one on me. Never had this car out o' Sunbeam
yet."</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;please!" the girl pleaded.</p>

<p>"Lady," said the chauffeur, "I'd do anything I could, within
reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you get us to San Marco by one o'clock?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I ain't no prophet, lady." A humorous gleam came into his eye.
"But ever since I got this car I been feelin' sort o reckless. If
you say so, I'll bid all my family and friends good-by, and we'll
take a chance on San Marco together."</p>

<p>"That's the spirit," laughed Minot. "But forget the family and
friends."</p>

<p>He placed his baggage in the front of the car, and helped the
girl into the tonneau. With a show of speed, the countryman went
around to the front of the car and began to crank.</p>

<p>He continued to crank with agonized face. In the course of a few
minutes, sounds of a terrific disturbance came from inside the car.
Still, like a hurdy-gurdy musician, the man cranked.</p>

<p>"I say," Minot inquired, "has your machine got the Sextette from
Lucia?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's been a lot of things wrong with it," the man
replied, "but I don't think it's had that yet."</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and such a laugh, Dick Minot was sure, had
never been heard in Sunbeam before. At that moment the driver
leaped to his seat, breathing hard, and had it out with the
wheel.</p>

<p>"Exeunt, laughingly, from Sunbeam," said Minot in the girl's
ear.</p>

<p>The car rolled asthmatically from the little settlement, and out
into the sand and heat of a narrow road.</p>

<p>"Eight miles to San Marco," said the driver out of the corner of
his mouth. "Sit tight. I'm going to let her out some."</p>

<p>Again Dick Minot glanced at the girl beside him. Fate was in a
jovial mood to-day to grant him this odd ride in the company of one
so charming! He could not have told what she wore, but he knew she
was all in white, and he realized the wisdom of white on a girl who
had, in her hair and eyes, colors to delight the most exacting.
About her clung a perfume never captured in a bottle; her chin was
the chin of a girl with a sense of humor; her eyes sparkled with
the thrill of their adventure together. And the dimple, in repose
now, became the champion dimple of the world.</p>

<p>Minot tried to think of some sprightly remark, but his usually
agile tongue remained silent. What was the matter with him? Why
should this girl seem different, somehow, from all the other girls
he had ever met? When he looked into her eyes a flood of
memories&mdash;a little sad&mdash;of all the happy times he had
ever known overwhelmed him. Memories of a starlit sea&mdash;the red
and white awnings of a yacht&mdash;the wind whispering through the
trees on a hillside&mdash;an orchestra playing in the
distance&mdash;memories of old, and happy, far-off things&mdash;of
times when he was even younger, even more in love with life. Why
should this be? He wondered.</p>

<p>And the girl, looking at him, wondered, too&mdash;was he
suddenly bereft of his tongue?</p>

<p>"I haven't asked you the conventional question?" she said at
last. "How do you like Florida?"</p>

<p>"It's wonderful, isn't it?" Minot replied, coming to with a
start. "I can speak of it even more enthusiastically than any of
the railroad folders do. And yet, it's only recent&mdash;my
discovery of its charms."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I was surveying it on that stopwatch of a train, my
impression of it was quite unfavorable. It seemed so monotonous. I
told myself nothing exciting could ever happen here."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;something has happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;something certainly has happened."</p>

<p>She blushed a little at his tone. Young men usually proposed to
her the first time they saw her. Why shouldn't she blush&mdash;a
little?</p>

<p>"Something very fine," Minot went on. "And I am surely very
grateful to fate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you mind looking at your watch&mdash;please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. A quarter after twelve. As I was saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think we can make it?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"You see, it is so very important. I want so very much to be
there by one o'clock."</p>

<p>"And I want you to."</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;if you really knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Knew what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I wish you would, please&mdash;but you just did look
at your watch, didn't you?"</p>

<p>They rattled on down that road that was so sandy, so
uninteresting, so lonely, with only a garage advertisement here and
there to suggest a world outside. Suddenly the driver ventured a
word over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, lady," he said. "We'll get there sure."</p>

<p>And even as he spoke the car gave a roar of rage and came to a
dead stop.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear&mdash;what is it now?" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"Acts like the train," commented Minot.</p>

<p>The driver got out and surveyed the car without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she's up to now?" he remarked. "Fifteen years I
drove horses, which are supposed to have brains, but this machine
can think of things to do to me that the meanest horse never
could."</p>

<p>"You promised, driver," pleaded the girl. "We must reach San
Marco on time. Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;your watch?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five past twelve," smiled Minot.</p>

<p>The native descended to the dust and slid under the car. In a
moment he emerged, triumphant.</p>

<p>"All O. K." he announced. "Don't you worry, lady. It's San Marco
or bust."</p>

<p>"If only something doesn't bust," Minot said.</p>

<p>Again they were plowing through the sand. The girl sat anxiously
on the edge of the seat, her cheeks flaming, her eyes alight. Minot
watched her. And suddenly all the happy, sad little memories melted
into a golden glow&mdash;the glow of being alive&mdash;on this
lonesome road&mdash;with her! Then suddenly he knew! This was the
one girl, the girl of all the world, the girl he should love while
the memory of her lasted, which would be until the eyes that looked
upon her now were dust. A great exultation swept through
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you mean," he asked, "when you said you were always
doing things like this?"</p>

<p>"I meant," she answered, "that I'm a silly little fool. Oh, if
you could know me well&mdash;" and her eyes seemed to question the
future&mdash;"you'd see for yourself. Never looking ahead to
calculate the consequences. It's the old story of fools rushing
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean of angels rushing in, don't you? I never was good at
old saws, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And once more, please&mdash;your watch?"</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes of one."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear&mdash;can we"&mdash;</p>

<p>A wild whoop from the driver interrupted.</p>

<p>"San Marco," he cried, pointing to where red towers rose above
the green of the country. "It paid to take a chance with me. I sure
did let her out. Where do you want to go, lady?"</p>

<p>"The Hotel de la Pax," said the girl, and with a sigh of deep
relief, sank back upon the cushions.</p>

<p>"And Salvator won," quoted Mr. Minot with a laugh.</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"Don't try," said Minot. "That is&mdash;I mean&mdash;try, if you
will, please."</p>

<p>"It meant so very much to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you'd better not, after all. It makes me feel guilty.
For I did nothing that doesn't come under the head of glorious
privilege. A chance to serve you! Why, I'd travel to the ends of
the earth for that."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it was good of you. You can hardly realize all it
meant to me to reach this hotel by one o'clock. Perhaps I ought to
tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," Minot replied. "That you have reached here
is my reward." His cheeks burned; his heart sang. Here was the one
girl, and he built castles in Spain with lightening strokes. She
should be his. She must be. Before him life stretched, glorious,
with her at his side&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think I will tell you," the girl was saying. "This is to be
the most important luncheon of my life because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" smiled Mr. Minot.</p>

<p>"Because it is the one at which I am going to announce my
engagement!"</p>

<p>Minot's heart stopped beating. A hundred castles in Spain came
tumbling about his ears, and the roar of their falling deafened
him. He put out his hand blindly to open the door, for he realized
that the car had come to a stop.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, please," he said dully.</p>

<p>And even as he spoke a horrible possibility swept into his heart
and overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," he stammered, "but would you mind
telling me one thing?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. But I really must fly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The name of&mdash;the happy man."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Allan, Lord Harrowby. Thank you so much&mdash;and
good-by."</p>

<p>She was gone now&mdash;gone amid the palms of that gorgeous
hotel courtyard. And out of the roar that enveloped him Minot heard
a voice:</p>

<p>"Thirty-five dollars, mister."</p>

<p>So promptly did he pay this grievous overcharge that the
chauffeur asked hopefully:</p>

<p>"Now could I take you anywhere, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Minot bitterly. "Take me back to New York."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if I had a new front tire I might try it."</p>

<p>Two eager black boys were moving inside with Minot's bags, and
he followed. As he passed the fountain tinkling gaily in the
courtyard:</p>

<p>"What was it I promised Thacker?" he said to himself. "'Miss
Cynthia Meyrick changes her mind only over my dead body.' Ah,
well&mdash;the good die young."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">4. &mdash;MR. TRIMMER LIMBERS UP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT the desk of the De la Pax Mr. Minot learned
that for fifteen dollars a day he might board and lodge amid the
splendors of that hotel. Gratefully he signed his name. One of the
negro boys&mdash;who had matched coins for him with the other boy
while he registered&mdash;led the way to his room.</p>

<p>It proved a long and devious journey. The Hotel de la Pax was a
series of afterthoughts on the part of its builders. Up hill and
down dale the boy led, through dark passageways, over narrow
bridges, until at length they arrived at the door of 389.</p>

<p>"My boy," muttered Minot feelingly, "I congratulate you. Henry
M. Stanley in the flower of his youth couldn't have done any
better."</p>

<p>"Yes, suh." The boy threw open the door of a narrow cell, at the
farther end of which a solitary window admitted the well-known
Florida sunshine. Minot stepped over and glanced out. Where the gay
courtyard with its green palms waving, its fountain tinkling? Not
visible from 389. Instead Minot saw a narrow street, its ancient
cobblestones partly obscured by flourishing grass, and bordered by
quaint, top-heavy Spanish houses, their plaster walls a hundred
colors from the indignities of the years.</p>

<p>"We seem to have strayed over into Spain," he remarked.</p>

<p>The bell-boy giggled.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh. We one block and a half from de hotel office."</p>

<p>"I didn't notice any taxis in the corridors," smiled Minot.
"Here&mdash;wait a minute." He tossed the boy a coin. "Your fare
back home. If you get stranded on the way, telegraph."</p>

<p>The boy departed, and Minot continued to gaze out. Directly
across from his window, looking strangely out of place in that dead
and buried street, stood a great stone house that bore on its front
the sign "Manhattan Club and Grill." On the veranda, flush with the
sidewalk and barely fifteen feet away, a huge red-faced man sat
deep in slumber.</p>

<p>Many and strange pursuits had claimed the talents of old Tom
Stacy, manager of the Manhattan Club, ere his advent in San Marco.
A too active district attorney had forced the New York police to
take a keen interest in his life and works, hence Mr. Stacy's
presence on that Florida porch. But such troubles were forgot for
the moment. He slumbered peacefully, secure in the knowledge that
the real business of the club would not require his attention until
darkness fell. His great head fell gradually farther in the
direction of his generous waist, and while there is no authentic
evidence to offer, it is safe to assume that he dreamed of
Broadway.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Stacy's head took another tilt downward, and his
Panama hat slipped off to the veranda floor. To the gaze of Mr.
Minot, above, there was revealed a bald pate extensive and
gleaming. The habitual smile fled from Minot's face. A feeling of
impotent anger filled his soul. For a bald head could recall but
one thing&mdash;Jephson.</p>

<p>He strode from the window, savagely kicking an innocent
suit-case that got in his way. What mean trick was this fate had
played him as he entered San Marco? To show to him the one girl in
all her glory and sweetness, to thrill him through and through with
his discovery&mdash;and then to send the girl scurrying off to
announce her engagement to another man! Scurvy, he called it. But
scurvier still, that it should be the very engagement he had
hastened to San Marco to bring to its proper close&mdash;"I do,"
and Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>He sat gloomily down on the bed. What could he do? What save
keep his word, given on the seventeenth floor of an office building
in New York? No man had yet had reason to question the good faith
of a Minot. His dead father, at the beginning of his career, had
sacrificed his fortune to keep his word, and gone back with a smile
to begin all over again. What could he do?</p>

<p>Nothing, save grit his teeth and see the thing through. He made
up his mind to this as he bathed and shaved, and prepared himself
for his debut in San Marco. So that, when he finally left the hotel
and stepped out into San Sebastian Avenue, he was cheerful with a
dogged, boy-stood-on-the-burning-deck cheerfulness.</p>

<p>A dozen negroes, their smiles reminiscent of tooth powder
advertisements, vainly sought to cajole him into their shaky
vehicles. With difficulty he avoided their pleas, and strolled down
San Marco's main thoroughfare. On every side clever shopkeepers
spread the net for the eagle on the dollar. Jewelers' shops
flashed, modistes hinted, milliners begged to present their latest
creations.</p>

<p>He came presently to a narrow cross street, where humbler
merchants catered to the Coney instinct that lurks in even the most
affluent of tourists. There gaudy souvenir stores abounded. The
ugly and inevitable alligator, fallen from his proud estate to
fireside slipper, wallet, cigar case, umbrella stand, photograph
album and Lord-knows-what, was head-lined in this street. Picture
post-cards hung in flocks, tin-type galleries besought,
news-stands, soda-water fountains and cheap boarding-houses stood
side by side. And, every few feet, Mr. Minot came upon "The Oldest
House in San Marco."</p>

<p>On his way back to the hotel, in front of one of the more
dazzling modiste's shops, he saw a limousine drawn up to the curb,
and in it Jack Paddock, friend of his college days. Paddock leaped
blithely from the machine and grasped Dick Minot by the hand.</p>

<p>"You here?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Foolish question," commented Mr. Minot.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Mr. Paddock. "Been here so long my brain's a
little flabby. But I'm glad to see you, old man."</p>

<p>"Same here." Mr. Minot stared at the car. "I say, Jack, did you
earn that writing fiction?"</p>

<p>Paddock laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm not writing much fiction now," he replied. "The car belongs
to Mrs. Helen Bruce, the wittiest hostess in San Marco." He came
closer. "My boy," he confided, "I have struck something essentially
soft. Some time soon, in a room with all the doors and windows
closed and the weather-strips in place, I'll whisper it to you.
I've been dying to tell somebody." "And the car&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Part of the graft, Dick. Here comes Mrs. Bruce now. Did I
mention she was the wittiest&mdash;of course I did. Want to meet
her? Well, later then. You're at the Pax, I suppose. See you
there."</p>

<p>Mr. Minot moved on from the imminence of Mrs. Bruce. A moment
later the limousine sped by him. One seat was generously filled by
the wittiest hostess in San Marco. Seated opposite her, Mr. Paddock
waved an airy hand. Life had always been the gayest of jokes to Mr.
Paddock.</p>

<p>Life was at the moment quite the opposite to Dick Minot. He
devoted the next hour to sad introspection in the lobby. It was not
until he was on his way in to dinner that he again saw Cynthia
Meyrick. Then, just outside the dining-room door, he encountered
her, still all in white, lovelier than ever, in her cheek a flush
of excitement no doubt put there by the most important luncheon of
her life. He waited for her to recognize him&mdash;and he did not
wait in vain.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Minot."</p>

<p>"Of course. In the hurry of this noon I quite overlooked an
introduction. I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Cynthia Meyrick. I happen to know because I met his
lordship in New York. May I ask&mdash;was the luncheon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite without a flaw. So you know Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;slightly. May I offer my very best wishes?"</p>

<p>"So good of you."</p>

<p>Formal, formal, formal. Was that how it must be between them
hereafter? Well, it was better so. Miss Meyrick presented her
father and her aunt, and that did not tend to lighten the
formality. Icicles, both of them, though stocky puffing icicles.
Aunt inquired if Mr. Minot was related to the Minots of Detroit,
and when he failed to qualify, at once lost all interest in him.
Old Spencer Meyrick did not accord him even that much
attention.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;all was not formal, as it happened. For as Cynthia
Meyrick moved away, she whispered: "I must see you after
dinner&mdash;on important business." And her smile as she said it
made Minot's own lonely dinner quite cheery.</p>

<p>At seven in the evening the hotel orchestra gathered in the
lobby for its nightly concert, and after the way of orchestras, it
was almost ready to begin when Minot left the dining-room at eight.
Sitting primly in straight backed chairs, an audience gathered for
the most part from the more inexpensive hostelries waited
patiently. Presumably these people were there for an hour with
music, lovely maid. But it was the gowns of more material maids
that interested the greater number of them, and many drab little
women sat making furtive mental notes that should while away the
hours conversationally when they got back to Akron or Terre
Haute.</p>

<p>Minot sat down in a veranda chair and looked out at the
courtyard. In the splendor of its evening colors, it was indeed the
setting for romance. In the midst of the green palms and blooming
things splashed a fountain which might well have been the one old
Ponce de Leon sought. On three sides the lighted towers and turrets
of that huge hotel climbed toward the bright, warm southern sky. A
dazzling moon shamed Mr. Edison's lamps, the breeze came tepid from
the sea, the very latest in waltzes drifted out from the gorgeous
lobby. Here romance, Minot thought, must have been born.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="1301841h-images/LoveInsurance-02.jpg"

</div>
<br>

<p>"Mr. Minot&mdash;I've been looking everywhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was beside him now, a slim white figure in the
dusk&mdash;the one thing lacking in that glittering picture. He
leaped to meet her.</p>

<p>"Sitting here dreaming, I reckon," she whispered, "of somebody
far away."</p>

<p>"No." He shook his head. "I leave that to the newly
engaged."</p>

<p>She made no answer. He gave her his chair, and drew up another
for himself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot," she said, "I was terribly thoughtless this noon.
But you must forgive me&mdash;I was so excited. Mr. Minot&mdash;I
owe you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated. Minot bit his lip savagely. Must he hear all that
again? How much she owed him for his service&mdash;for getting her
to that luncheon in time&mdash;that wonderful luncheon&mdash;</p>

<p>"I owe you," finished the girl softly, "the charges on that
taxi."</p>

<p>It was something of a shock to Minot. Was she making game of
him?</p>

<p>"Don't," he answered. "Here in the moonlight, with that waltz
playing, and the old palms whispering&mdash;is this a time to talk
of taxi bills?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we must talk of something&mdash;oh, I mean&mdash;I
insist. Won't you please tell me the figure?"</p>

<p>"All the time we were together this morning, I talked
figures&mdash;the figures on the face of a watch. Let us find some
pleasanter topic. I believe Lord Harrowby said you were to be
married soon?"</p>

<p>"Next Tuesday. A week from to-morrow."</p>

<p>"In Sail Marco?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It breaks auntie's heart that it can't be in Detroit. Lord
Harrowby is her triumph, you see. But father can't go north in the
winter&mdash;and Allan wishes to be married at once."</p>

<p>Minot was thinking hard. So Harrowby was auntie's triumph? And
was he not Cynthia Meyrick's as well? He would have given much to
be able to inquire.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with the engaging frankness of a child, the girl
asked:</p>

<p>"Has your engagement ever been announced, Mr. Minot?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;not to my knowledge," Minot laughed.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"I was just wondering&mdash;if it made everybody feel queer. The
way it makes me feel. Ever since one o'clock&mdash;I ought never to
say it&mdash;I've felt as though everything was over. I've seemed
old! Old!" She clenched her fists, and spoke almost in terror. "I
don't want to grow old. I'd hate it."</p>

<p>"It was here," said Minot softly, "Ponce de Leon sought the
fountain of youth. When you came up I was pretending the one
splashing out there was that very fountain itself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it only were," the girl cried. "Oh&mdash;you could never
drag me away from it. But it isn't. It's supplied by the San Marco
Water Works, and there's a meter ticking somewhere, I'm sure. And
now&mdash;Mr. Minot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. You mean the thirty-five dollars I paid our driver. I
wish you would write me a check. I've a reason."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I wanted to&mdash;so much. I'll bring it to you
soon."</p>

<p>She was gone, and Minot sat staring into the palms, his lips
firm, his hands gripping the arms of his chair. Suddenly, with a
determined leap, he was on his feet.</p>

<p>A moment later he stood at the telegraph counter in the lobby,
writing in bold flowing characters a message for Mr. John Thacker,
on a certain seventeenth floor, New York.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I resign. Will stay on the job until a
substitute arrives, but start him when you get this.</p>

<p class="letter">"Richard Minot."</p>
<br>

<p>The telegram sent, he returned to his veranda chair to think.
Thacker would be upset, of course. But after all, Thacker's claim
on him was not such that he must wreck his life's happiness to
serve him. Even Thacker must see that. And the girl&mdash;was she
madly in love with the lean and aristocratic Harrowby? Not by any
means, to judge from her manner. Next Tuesday&mdash;a week. What
couldn't happen in a&mdash;Minot stopped. No, that wouldn't do,
either. Even if a substitute arrived, he could hardly with honor
turn about and himself wreck the hopes of Thacker and Jephson. He
lost, either way. It was a horrible mix-up. He cursed beneath his
breath.</p>

<p>The red glow of a cigar near by drew closer as the smoker
dragged his chair across the veranda floor. Minot saw behind the
glow the keen face of a man eager for talk.</p>

<p>"Some scene, isn't it?" said the stranger. "Sort of makes the
musical comedies look cheap. All it needs is seven stately chorus
ladies walking out from behind that palm down to the left, and it
would have Broadway lashed to the mast."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Minot absently. "This is the real thing."</p>

<p>"I've been sitting here thinking," the other went on. "It
doesn't seem to me this place has been advertised right. Why, there
are hundreds of people up north whose windows look out on sunset
over the brewery&mdash;people with money, too&mdash;who'd take the
first train for here if they realized the picture we're looking at
now. Get some good hustler to tell 'em about it&mdash;" He paused.
"I hate to talk about myself, but say&mdash;ever hear of Cotrell's
Ink Eraser? Nothing ever written Cotrell can't erase. Will not soil
or scratch the paper. If the words Cotrell has erased were put side
by side&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Selling it?" Minot inquired wearily.</p>

<p>"No. But I made that eraser. Put it on every desk between New
York and the rolling Oregon. After that I landed Helot's Bottled
Sauces. And then Patterson's Lime Juice. Puckered every mouth in
America. Advertising is my specialty."</p>

<p>"So I gather."</p>

<p>"Sure as you sit here. Have a cigar. Trimmer is my
name&mdash;never mind the jokes. Henry Trimmer. Advertising
specialist. Is your business flabby? Does it need a tonic? Try
Trimmer. Quoting from my letter-head." He leaned closer. "Excuse a
personal question, but didn't I see you talking with Miss Cynthia
Meyrick a while back?" "Possibly."</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer came even closer.</p>

<p>"Engaged to Lord Harrowby, I understand."</p>

<p>"I believe so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Young fellow," Mr. Trimmer's tone was exultant, "I can't keep
in any longer. I got a proposition in tow so big it's bursting my
brain cells&mdash;and it takes some strain to do that. No, I can't
tell you the exact nature of it&mdash;but I will say
this&mdash;to-morrow night this time I'll throw a bomb in this
hotel so loud it'll be heard round the world."</p>

<p>"An anarchist?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life. Advertiser. And I've got something to
advertise this hot February, take it from me. Maybe you're a friend
of Miss Meyrick. Well, I'm sorry. For when I spring my little
surprise I reckon this Harrowby wedding is going to shrivel up and
fade away."</p>

<p>"You mean to say you&mdash;you're going to stop the
wedding?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say nothing. Watch me. Watch Henry Trimmer. Just a
tip, young fellow. Well, I guess I'll turn in. Get some of my best
ideas in bed. See you later."</p>

<p>And Mr. Trimmer strode into the circle of light, a fine
upstanding figure of a man, to pass triumphantly out of sight among
the palms. Dazed, Dick Minot stared after him.</p>

<p>A voice spoke his name. He turned. The slim white presence
again, holding toward him a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"The check, Mr. Minot. Thirty-five dollars. Is that
correct?"</p>

<p>"Correct. It's splendid. Because I'm never going to cash
it&mdash;I'm going to keep it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Minot, I must say good&mdash;"</p>

<p>He came closer. Thacker and Jephson faded. New York was far
away. He was young, and the moon was shining&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;going to keep it&mdash;always. The first letter you ever
wrote me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the last, Mr. Minot. Really&mdash;I must go. Good
night."</p>

<p>He stood alone, with the absurd check in his trembling fingers.
Slowly the memory of Trimmer came back. A bomb? What sort of a
bomb?</p>

<p>Well, he had given his word. There was no way out&mdash;he must
protect old Jephson's interests. But might he not wish the
enemy&mdash;success? He stared off in the direction the advertising
wizard had gone.</p>

<p>"Trimmer, old boy," he muttered, "here's to your pitching
arm!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">5. &mdash;MR. TRIMMER THROWS HIS
BOMB</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MISS Cynthia Meyrick was a good many girls in one.
So many, indeed, that it might truthfully be added that while most
people are never so much alone as when in a crowd, Miss Meyrick was
never so much in a crowd as when alone. Most of these girls were
admirable, a few were more mischievous than admirable, but rely
upon it that every single one of them was nice.</p>

<p>It happened to be as a very serious-minded girl that Miss
Meyrick opened her eyes on Tuesday morning. She lay for a long time
watching the Florida sunshine, spoken of so tenderly in the
railroad's come-on books, as it danced across the foot of her bed.
To-day the <i>Lileth</i> was to steam into San Marco harbor! To-day
her bridegroom was to smile his slow British smile on her once
more! She recalled these facts without the semblance of a
thrill.</p>

<p>Where, she wondered, was the thrill? The frivolous girl who had
met Lord Harrowby abroad, and dazzled by dreams of social triumphs
to come had allowed her aunt to urge her into this betrothal, was
not present at the moment. Had she been, she would have declared
this Cynthia Meyrick a silly, and laughed her into gaiety
again.</p>

<p>Into the room toddled the aunt who had stood so faithfully on
the coaching line abroad. With heavy wit, she spoke of the coming
of Lord Harrowby. Miss Cynthia did not smile. She turned grave eyes
on her aunt.</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," she confessed. "Was it the thing to do, after
all? Shall I be so very happy?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Ninety-nine out of a hundred engaged girls have
doubts. It's natural." Aunt Mary sat down on the bed, which groaned
in agony. "Of course you'll be happy. You'll take precedence over
Marion Bishop&mdash;didn't we look that up? And after the airs
she's put on when she's come back to Detroit&mdash;well, you ought
to be the happiest of girls."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but&mdash;" Miss Meyrick continued to gaze
solemnly at her aunt. She was accustomed to the apparition. To any
one who knew Aunt Mary only in her public appearances, a view of
her now would have been startling. Not to go too deeply into the
matter, she had not yet been poured into the steel girders that
determined her public form. Her washed-out eyes were puffy, and her
gray hair was not so luxurious as it would be when she appeared in
the hotel dining-room for lunch. There she sat, a fat little lump
of a woman who had all her life chased will-o'the-wisps.</p>

<p>"But what?" she demanded firmly.</p>

<p>"It seems as if all my fun were over. Didn't you feel that way
when you became engaged?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. But then&mdash;I hadn't enjoyed everything money will
buy, as you have. I've always said you had too much. There,
dear&mdash;cheer up. You don't seem to realize. Why, I can remember
when you were born&mdash;in the flat down on Second
Street&mdash;and your father wearing his old overcoat another year
to pay the doctor's bill. And now that little fluffy baby is to
marry into the peerage! Bless you, how proud your mother would be
had she lived&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Aunt Mary?"</p>

<p>"Positive." Aunt Mary's eyes filled, and with a show of real, if
clumsy affection, she leaned over and kissed her niece. "Come,
dear, get up. I've ordered breakfast in the rooms."</p>

<p>Miss Cynthia sat up. And as if banished by that act, the serious
little mouse of a girl scampered into oblivion, and in her place
appeared a gay young rogue who sees the future lying bright
ahead.</p>

<p>"After all," she smiled, "I'm not married&mdash;yet." And
humming brightly from a current musical comedy&mdash;"Not just
yet&mdash;just yet&mdash;just yet&mdash;" she stretched forth one
slim white arm to throw aside the coverlet. At which point it is
best discreetly to withdraw.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot, after a lonesome if abundant breakfast, was at this
moment strolling across the hotel courtyard toward yesterday
morning's New York papers. As he walked, the pert promises of Mr.
Trimmer filled his mind. What was the proposition Mr. Trimmer had
in tow? How would it affect the approaching wedding? And what
course of action should the representative of Jephson pursue when
it was revealed? For in the sensible light of morning Dick Minot
realized that while he remained in San Marco as the guardian of
Jephson's interests, he must do his duty. Adorable Miss Meyrick
might be, but any change of mind on her part must be over his dead
body. A promise was a promise.</p>

<p>With this resolve firm, he proceeded along the hot sidewalk of
San Sebastian Avenue. On his right the rich shops again, a
dignified Spanish church as old as the town, a rambling
lackadaisical "opera-house." On his left the green and sand colored
plaza, with the old Spanish governor's house in the center, now
serving Uncle Sam as post-office. A city of the past was this;
"other times, other manners" breathed in the air.</p>

<p>At the news-stand Minot met Jack Paddock, jaunty, with a
gardenia in his buttonhole and the atmosphere of prosperity that
goes with it.</p>

<p>"Come for a stroll," Paddock suggested. "I presume you want the
giddy story of my life I promised you yesterday? Been down to the
old Spanish fort yet? No? Come ahead, and there on the ramparts
I'll impart."</p>

<p>They went down the narrow and very modern street of the souvenir
venders. Suddenly the street ended, and they walked again in the
past. The remnants of the old city gates restored, loomed in the
sunlight. They stepped through the portals, and Minot gave a
gasp.</p>

<p>There in the quiet morning stood the great gray fort that the
early settlers had built to protect themselves from the gay dogs
who roamed the seas. Its massive walls spoke clearly of romance, of
bloody days of cutlass and spike, of bandaged heads and ready arms.
Such things still stood! Still stood in the United
States&mdash;land of steam radiators and men who marched in
suffrage parades!</p>

<p>The old caretaker let them in, and they went up the stone steps
to stand at last on the parapet looking down on the shimmering sea.
To Minot, fresh from Broadway, it all seemed like a colorful dream.
They climbed to the highest point and sat, swinging their legs over
the edge. Far below the bright blue waters broke on the lower
walls.</p>

<p>"It's a funny country down here," Paddock said slowly. "A sort
of too-good-to-be-true, who-believes-it place. Bright and gay and
full of green palms, and so much like a musical comedy you keep
waiting all the time for the curtain to go down and the male
population to begin its march up the aisle. I've been here three
months, and I don't yet think it's really true."</p>

<p>He shifted on the cold stones.</p>

<p>"Ever since white men hit on it," he went on, "it's sort of kept
luring them here on fool dream hunts&mdash;like a woman. Along
about the time old Ponce de Leon came over here prospecting for the
fountain that nobody but Lillian Russell has located yet, another
Spaniard&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;had a pipe dream, too. He
came over hot-foot looking for a mountain of gold he dreamed was
here. I'm sorry for that old boy."</p>

<p>"Sorry for him?" repeated Minot.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;sorry. He had the right idea, but he arrived several
hundred years too soon. He should have waited until the yellow rich
from the North showed up here. Then he'd have found his
mountain&mdash;he'd have found a whole range of them."</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm to infer," Mr. Minot said, "that where he failed,
you've landed."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick. I am right on the mountain with my little alpenstock
in hand."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," replied Minot frankly. "You might have amounted to
something if you'd been separated from money long enough."</p>

<p>"So I've heard," Paddock said with a yawn. "But it wasn't to be.
I haven't seen you since we left college, have I? Well, Dick, for a
couple of years I tried to make good doing fiction. I turned them
out by the yard&mdash;nice quiet little tea-table yarns with snappy
dialogue. Once I got eighty dollars for a story. It was hard
work&mdash;and I always did yearn for the purple, you know."</p>

<p>"I know," said Minot gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, I've struck it, Dick. I've struck the deep purple with a
loud if sickening thud. Hist! The graft I mentioned yesterday." He
glanced over his shoulder. "Remember Mrs. Bruce, the wittiest
hostess in San Marco?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Well, I write her repartee for her."</p>

<p>"Her&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Her repartee&mdash;her dialogue&mdash;the bright talk she
convulses dinner tables with. Instead of putting my smart stuff
into stories at eighty per, I sell it to Mrs. Bruce at&mdash;I'd be
ashamed to tell you, old man. I remarked that it was essentially
soft. It is."</p>

<p>"This is a new one on me," said Minot, dazed.</p>

<p>A delighted smile spread over Mr. Paddock's handsome face.</p>

<p>"Thanks. That's the beauty of it. I'm a pioneer. There'll be
others, but I was the first. Consider the situation. Here's Mrs.
Bruce, loaded with diamonds and money, but tongue-tied in company,
with a wit developed in Zanesville, Ohio. Bright, but struggling,
young author comes to her&mdash;offers to make her conversation the
sensation of the place for a few pesos."</p>

<p>"You did that?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I ask posterity to remember it was I who invented the
graft. Mrs. Bruce fell on my fair young neck. Now, she gives me in
advance a list of her engagements, and for the important ones I
devise her line of talk. Then, as I'm usually present at the
occasion, I swing things round for her and give her her cues. If
I'm not there, she has to manage it herself. It's a great
life&mdash;only a bit of a strain on me. I have to remember not to
be clever in company. If I forget and spring a good one, she jumps
on me proper afterward for not giving it to her."</p>

<p>"Jack," said Minot slowly, "come way from here with me. Come
north. This place will finish you sure."</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man," laughed Paddock, "but I've had a nip of the
lotus. This lazy old land suits me. I like to sit on a veranda
while a dusky menial in a white coat hands me the tinkle-tinkle in
a tall cool glass. Come away? Oh, no&mdash;I couldn't do that."</p>

<p>"You'll marry down here," sighed Minot. "Some girl with money.
And the career we all hoped you'd make for yourself will go up in a
golden cloud."</p>

<p>"I met a girl," Paddock replied, half closing his eyes and
smiling cynically at the sea&mdash;"little thing from the Middle
West, stopping at a back street boarding-house&mdash;father in the
hardware business, nobody at all&mdash;but eyes like the sea there,
hands like butterflies&mdash;sort of&mdash;got me&mdash;That's how
I happen to know I'll never marry. For if I married anybody it
would have to be her&mdash;and I let her go home without saying a
word because I was selfish and like this easy game and intend to
stick to it until I'm smothered in rose-leaves. Shall we wander
back?"</p>

<p>"See here, Jack&mdash;I don't want to preach"&mdash;Minot tried
to conceal his seriousness with a smile&mdash;"but if I were you
I'd stick to this girl, and make good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And leave this?" Paddock laughed. "Dick, you old idiot, this is
meat and drink to me. This nice old land of loiter in the sun. Nay,
nay. Now, I've really got to get back. Mrs. Bruce is giving a tango
tea this afternoon&mdash;informal, but something has to be
said&mdash;These fellows who write a daily humorous column must
lead a devil of a life."</p>

<p>With a laugh, Minot followed his irresponsible friend down the
steps. They crossed the bridge over the empty moat and came through
the city gates again to the street of the alligator.</p>

<p>"By the way," Paddock said as they went up the hotel steps, "you
haven't told me what brought you south?"</p>

<p>"Business, Jack," said Minot. "It's a secret&mdash;perhaps I can
tell you later."</p>

<p>"Business? I thought, of course, you came for pleasure."</p>

<p>"There'll be no pleasure in this trip for me," said Minot
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, won't there?" Paddock laughed. "Wait till you hear Mrs.
Bruce talk. See you later, old man."</p>

<p>'At luncheon they brought Mr. Minot a telegram from a certain
seventeenth floor in New York. An explosive telegram. It read:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"NONSENSE NOBODY HERE TO TAKE YOUR PLACE, SEE
IT THROUGH, YOU'VE GIVEN YOUR WORD.THACKER."</p>
<br>

<p>Gloomily Mr. Minot considered. What was there to do but see it
through? Even though Thacker should send another to take his place,
could he stay to woo the lady he adored? Hardly. In that event he
would have to go away&mdash;never see her again&mdash;never hear
her voice&mdash;If he stayed as Jephson's representative he might
know the glory of her nearness for a week, might thrill at her
smile&mdash;even while he worked to wed her to Lord Harrowby. And
perhaps&mdash;Who could say? Hard as he might work, might he not be
thwarted? It was possible.</p>

<p>So after lunch he sent Thacker a reassuring; message, promising
to stay. And at the end of a dull hour in the lobby, he set out to
explore the town.</p>

<p>The Mermaid Tea House stood on the waterfront, with a small
second-floor balcony that looked out on the harbor. Passing that
way at four-thirty that afternoon, Minot heard a voice call to him.
He glanced up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Minot&mdash;won't you come into my parlor?" Cynthia
Meyrick smiled down on him.</p>

<p>"Splendid," Minot laughed. "I walk forlorn through this old
Spanish town&mdash;suddenly a lattice is thrown wide, a fair hand
beckons. I dash within."</p>

<p>"Thanks for dashing," Miss Meyrick greeted him, on the balcony.
"I was finding it dreadfully dull. But I'm afraid the Spanish
romance is a little lacking. There is no moonlight, no lattice, no
mantilla, no Spanish beauty."</p>

<p>"No matter," Minot answered. "I never did care for Spanish
types. They flash like a skyrocket&mdash;then tumble in the dark.
Now, the home-grown girls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And nothing but tea," she interrupted. "Will you have a
cup?"</p>

<p>"Thanks. Was it really very dull?"</p>

<p>"Yes. This book was to blame." She held up a novel.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;it's one of those books in which the hero and heroine
are forever 'gazing into each other's eyes.' And they understand
perfectly. But the reader doesn't. I've reached one of those gazing
matches now."</p>

<p>"But isn't it so in real life&mdash;when people gaze into each
other's eyes, don't they usually understand?" "Do they?"</p>

<p>"Don't they? You surely have had more experience than I."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" she smiled.</p>

<p>"Because your eyes are so very easy to gaze into."</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot&mdash;you're gazing into them&mdash;brazenly.
And&mdash;neither of us 'understand,' do we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;we're both completely at sea."</p>

<p>"There," she cried triumphantly. "I told you these authors were
all wrong."</p>

<p>Minot, having begun to gaze, found difficulty in stopping. She
was near, she was beautiful&mdash;and a promise made in New York
was a dim and distant thing.</p>

<p>"The railroad folders try to make you believe Florida is an
annex to Heaven," he said. "I used to think they were lying.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>She blushed.</p>

<p>"But what, Mr. Minot?"</p>

<p>He leaned close, a strange light in his eyes. He opened his
mouth to speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly he glanced over her shoulder, and the light died from
his eyes. His lips set in a bitter curve.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said. A silence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot&mdash;you've grown awfully dull."</p>

<p>"Have I? I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Must I go back to my book&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the shrill triumphant cry of a yacht's
siren at her back. She turned her head.</p>

<p>"The <i>Lileth</i>," she said.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Minot. "The bridegroom cometh."</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"You'll want to go to meet him," Minot said, rising. He stood
looking at the boat, flashing gaily in the sunshine. "I'll go with
you as far as the street."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you know Lord Harrowby. Meet him with me."</p>

<p>"It seems hardly the thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm not sentimental. And surely Allan's not."</p>

<p>"Then I must be," said Minot. "Really&mdash;I'd rather
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>They went together to the street. At the parting of the ways,
Minot turned to her.</p>

<p>"I promised Lord Harrowby in New York," he told her, "that you
would have your lamp trimmed and burning."</p>

<p>She looked up at him. A mischievous light came into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;have you a match?" she asked.</p>

<p>It was too much. Minot turned and fled down the street. He did
not once look back, though it seemed to him that he felt every step
the girl took across that narrow pier to her fiance's side.</p>

<p>As he dressed for dinner that night his telephone rang, and Miss
Meyrick's voice sounded over the wire.</p>

<p>"Harrowby remembers you very pleasantly. Won't you join us at
dinner?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure an outsider&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Mr. Martin Wall is to be there."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;thank you&mdash;I'll be delighted," Minot replied.</p>

<p>In the lobby Harrowby seized his hand.</p>

<p>"My dear chap&mdash;you're looking fit. Great to see you again.
By the way&mdash;do you know Martin Wall?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Mr. Wall and I met just before the splash," Minot
smiled. He shook hands with Wall, unaccountably genial and beaming.
"The Hudson, Mr. Wall, is a bit chilly in February."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Wall, "can you ever forgive me? A
thousand apologies. It was all a mistake&mdash;a horrible
mistake."</p>

<p>"I felt like a rotter when I heard about it," Harrowby put in.
"Martin mistook you for some one else. You must forgive us
both."</p>

<p>"Freely," said Minot. "And I want to apologize for my suspicions
of you, Lord Harrowby."</p>

<p>"Thanks, old chap."</p>

<p>"I never doubted you would come&mdash;after I saw Miss
Meyrick."</p>

<p>"She is a ripper, isn't she?" said Harrowby
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Martin Wall shot a quick, almost hostile glance at Minot.</p>

<p>"You've noticed that yourself, haven't you?" he said in Minot's
ear.</p>

<p>At which point the Meyrick family arrived, and they all went in
to dinner.</p>

<p>That function could hardly be described as hilarious. Aunt Mary
fluttered and gasped in her triumph, and spoke often of her horror
of the new. The recent admission of automobiles to the sacred
precincts of Bar Harbor seemed to be the great and disturbing fact
in life for her. Spencer Meyrick said little; his thoughts were far
away. The rush and scramble of a business office, the click of
typewriters, the excitement of the dollar chase&mdash;these things
had been his life. Deprived of them, like many another exile in the
South, he moved in a dim world of unrealities and wished that he
were home. Minot, too, had little to say. On Martin Wall fell the
burden of entertainment, and he bore it as one trained for the
work. Blithely he gossiped of queer corners that had known him and
amid the flow of his oratory the dinner progressed.</p>

<p>It was after dinner, when they all stood together in the lobby a
moment before separating, that Mr. Henry Trimmer made good his
promise out of a clear sky.</p>

<p>Cynthia Meyrick stood facing the others, talking brightly, when
suddenly her face paled and the flippant words died on her lips.
They all turned instantly.</p>

<p>Through the lobby, in a buzz of excited comment, a man walked
slowly, his eyes on the ground. He was a tall blond Englishman, not
unlike Lord Harrowby in appearance. His gray eyes, when he raised
them for a moment, were listless, his shoulders stooped and weary,
and he had a long drooping mustache that hung like a weeping willow
above a particularly cheerless stream.</p>

<p>However, it was not his appearance that excited comment and
caused Miss Meyrick to pale. Hung over his shoulders was a pair of
sandwich boards such as the outcasts of a great city carry up and
down the streets. And on the front board, turned full toward Miss
Meyrick's dinner party, was printed in bold black letters:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">I<br>
AM<br>
THE<br>
REAL<br>
LORD<br>
HARROWBY</p>
<br>

<p>With a little gasp and a murmured apology, Miss Meyrick turned
quickly and entered the elevator. Lord Harrowby stood like a man of
stone, gazing at the sandwich boards.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the hotel detective sufficiently
recovered himself to lay eager hands on the audacious sandwich man
and propel him violently from the scene.</p>

<p>In the background Mr. Minot perceived Henry Trimmer, puffing
excitedly on a big black cigar, a triumphant look on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer's bomb was thrown.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">6. &mdash;TEN MINUTES OF AGONY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ALL I ask, Mister Harrowby, is that you consent to
a short interview with your brother."</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer was speaking. The time was noon of the following
day, and Trimmer faced Lord Harrowby in the sitting-room of his
lordship's hotel suite. Also present&mdash;at Harrowby's
invitation&mdash;were Martin Wall and Mr. Minot.</p>

<p>His lordship turned his gray eyes on Trimmer's eager face. He
could make those eyes fishy when he liked&mdash;he made them so
now.</p>

<p>"He is not my brother," he said coldly, "and I shall not see
him. May I ask you not to call me Mr. Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"You may ask till you're red in your noble face," replied
Trimmer, firm in his disrespect. "But I shall go on calling you
'Mister' just the same. I call you that because I know the facts.
Just as I call your poor cheated brother, who was in this hotel
last night between sandwich boards, Lord Harrowby."</p>

<p>"Really," said his lordship, "I see no occasion for prolonging
this interview."</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer leaned forward. He was a big man, but his face was
incongruously thin&mdash;almost ax-like. The very best sort of face
to thrust in anywhere&mdash;and Trimmer was the very man to do the
thrusting without batting an eye.</p>

<p>"Do you deny," he demanded with the air of a prosecutor, "that
you had an older brother by the name of George?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do not," answered Lord Harrowby. "George ran off to
America some twenty-two years ago. He died in a mining camp in
Arizona twelve years back. There is no question whatever about
that. We had it on the most reliable authority."</p>

<p>"A lot of lies," said Trimmer, "can be had on good authority.
This situation illustrates that. Do you think, Mr. Harrowby, that
I'd be wasting my time on this proposition if I wasn't dead sure of
my facts. Why, poor old George has the evidence in his possession.
Incontrovertible proofs. It wouldn't hurt you to see him and look
over what he has to offer."</p>

<p>"Your lordship," Minot suggested, "you know that I am your
friend and that my great desire is to see you happily married next
week. In order that nothing may happen to prevent, I think you
ought to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This impostor," cut in his lordship haughtily. "No, I can not.
This is not the first time adventurers have questioned the Harrowby
title. The dignity of our family demands that I refuse to take any
notice whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Go on," sneered Trimmer. "Hide behind your dignity. When I get
through with you you won't have enough left to conceal your
stick-pin."</p>

<p>"Trimmer," said Martin Wall, speaking for the first time, "how
much money do you want?"</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer kept his temper admirably.</p>

<p>"Your society has not corrupted me, Mr. Wall," he said sweetly.
"I am not a blackmailer. I am simply a publicity man. I'm working
on a salary which Lord Harrowby&mdash;the real Lord
Harrowby&mdash;is to pay me when he comes into his own. I've
handled successfully in publicity campaigns prima donnas, pills,
erasers, perfumes, holding companies, race horses, soups and
society leaders. It isn't likely that I shall fall down on this
proposition. For the last time, Mr. Allan Harrowby, will you see
your brother?"</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby, if I were you&mdash;" Minot began.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow." His lordship raised one slim hand. "It is
quite impossible. Which, I take it, terminates our talk with Mr.
Trimmer."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Trimmer, rising. "Except for one thing. Our
young friend here, when he urges you to grant my request, is giving
a correct imitation of a wise head on youthful shoulders. He's an
American, and he knows about me&mdash;about Henry Trimmer. I guess
you never heard, Mr. Harrowby, what I did for Cotrell's Ink
Eraser&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on," said Mr. Wall militantly, "erase yourself."</p>

<p>"For the moment, I will," smiled Mr. Trimmer. "But I warn you,
Mr. Harrowby, you are going to be sorry. You aren't up against any
piker in publicity&mdash;no siree. That little sandwich-board stunt
of mine last night was just a starter. I'm going to take the public
into partnership. Put it up to the people&mdash;that's my
motto."</p>

<p>"Good day, sir," snapped Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>"Put it up to the people. And when I pull off the little trick I
thought of this morning, you're going to get down before me on your
noble knees, and beg off. I warn you. Good day, gentlemen. And may
I add one simple request on parting? Watch Trimmer!"</p>

<p>He went out, slamming the door behind him. Mr. Wall rose and
walked rapidly toward a decanter.</p>

<p>"Rather tough on you, Lord Harrowby," he remarked, pouring
himself a drink. "Especially just now. The fresh bounder! Ought to
have been kicked out of the room."</p>

<p>"An impostor," snorted Harrowby. "A rank impostor."</p>

<p>"Of course." Mr. Wall set down his glass. "But don't worry. If
Trimmer gets too obstreperous, I'll take care of him myself. I
guess I'll be going back to the yacht."</p>

<p>After Wall's departure, Minot and Harrowby sat staring at each
other for a long moment.</p>

<p>"See here, your lordship," said Minot at last. "You know why I'm
in San Marco. That wedding next Tuesday must take place without
fail. And I can't say that I approve of your action just
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear boy," Harrowby interrupted soothingly, "I appreciate
your position. But there was nothing to be gained by seeing Mr.
Trimmer's friend. The Meyricks were distressed, naturally, by that
ridiculous sandwich-board affair last evening, but they have made
no move to call off the wedding on account of it. The best thing to
do, I'm sure, is to let matters take their course. I might be able
to prove that chap's claims false&mdash;and then again I mightn't,
even if I knew they were false. And&mdash;there is a third
possibility."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"He might really be&mdash;George."</p>

<p>"But you said your brother died, twelve years ago.</p>

<p>"That is what we heard. But&mdash;one can not be sure. And,
delighted as I should be to know that George is alive, naturally I
should prefer to know it after next Tuesday."</p>

<p>Anger surged into Minot's heart.</p>

<p>"Is that fair to the young lady who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is to become my wife?" Lord Harrowby waved his hand. "It
is. Miss Meyrick is not marrying me for my title. As for her father
and aunt, I can not be so sure. I want no disturbance. You want
none. I am sure it is better to let things take their course."</p>

<p>"All right," said Minot. "Only I intend to do every thing in my
power to put this wedding through."</p>

<p>"My dear chap&mdash;your cause is mine," answered his
lordship.</p>

<p>Minot returned to the narrow confines of his room. On the
bureau, where he had thrown it earlier in the day, lay an
invitation to dine that night with Mrs. Bruce. Thus was Jack
Paddock's hand shown. The dinner was to be in Miss Meyrick's honor,
and Mr. Minot was not sorry he was to go. He took up the invitation
and reread it smilingly. So he was to hear Mrs. Bruce at her own
table&mdash;the wittiest hostess in San Marco&mdash;bar none.</p>

<p>The drowsiness of a Florida midday was in the air. Mr. Minot lay
down on his bed. A hundred thoughts were his: the brown of Miss
Meyrick's eyes, the sincerity of Mr. Trimmer's voice when he spoke
of his proposition, the fishy look of Lord Harrowby refusing to
meet his long lost brother. Things grew hazy. Mr. Minot slept.</p>

<p>On leaving Lord Harrowby's rooms, Mr. Martin Wall did not
immediately set out for the <i>Lileth</i>, on which he lived in
preference to the hotel. Instead he took a brisk turn about the
spacious lobby of the De la Pax.</p>

<p>People turned to look at him as he passed. They noted that his
large, placid, rather jovial face was lighted by an eye sharp and
queer, and a bit out of place amid its surroundings. Mr. Wall
considered himself the true cosmopolite, and his history rather
bore out the boast. Many and odd were the lands that had known him.
He had loaned money to a prince of Algiers (on excellent security),
broken bread with a sultan, organized a baseball nine in Cuba, and
coming home from the East via the Indian ports, had flirted on
shipboard with the wife of a Russian grand duke. As he passed
through that cool lobby it was not to be wondered at that middle
west merchants and their wives found him worthy of a second
glance.</p>

<p>The courtyard of the Hotel de la Pax was fringed by a series of
modish shops, with doors opening both on the courtyard and on the
narrow street outside. Among these, occupying a corner room was the
very smart jewel shop of Ostby and Blake. Occasionally in the
winter resorts of the South one may find jewelry shops whose stock
would bear favorably competition with Fifth Avenue. Ostby and Blake
conducted such an establishment.</p>

<p>For a moment before the show-window of this shop Mr. Wall
paused, and with the eye of a connoisseur studied the brilliant
display within. His whole manner changed. The air of boredom with
which he had surveyed his fellow travelers of the lobby
disappeared; on the instant he was alert, alive, almost eager.
Jauntily he strolled into the store.</p>

<p>One clerk only&mdash;a tall thin man with a sallow complexion
and hair the color of a lemon&mdash;was in charge. Mr. Wall asked
to be shown the stock of unset diamonds.</p>

<p>The trays that the man set before him caused the eyes of Mr.
Wall to brighten still more. With a manner almost reverent he
stooped over and passed his fingers lovingly over the stones. For
an instant the tall man glanced outside, and smiled a sallow smile.
A little girl in a pink dress was crossing the street, and it was
at her that he smiled.</p>

<p>"There's a flaw in that stone," said Mr. Wall, in a voice of
sorrow. "See&mdash;"</p>

<p>From outside came the shrill scream of a child, interrupting.
The tall man turned quickly to the window.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;" he moaned.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Mr. Wall sought to look over his shoulder.
"Automobile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My little girl," cried the clerk in agony. He turned to Martin
Wall, hesitating. His sallow face was white now, his lips trembled.
Doubtfully he gazed into the frank open countenance of Martin Wall.
And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I leave you in charge," he shouted, and fled past Mr. Wall to
the street.</p>

<p>For a moment Martin Wall stood, frozen to the spot. His eyes
were unbelieving; his little Cupid's bow mouth was wide open.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;come back&mdash;" he shouted, when he could find his
voice.</p>

<p>No one heeded. No one heard. Outside in the street a crowd had
gathered. Martin Wall wet his dry lips with his tongue. An
unaccountable shudder swept his huge frame.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;" he cried in a voice of terror, "I'm alone!"</p>

<p>For the first time he dared to move. His elbow bumped a hundred
thousand dollars' worth of unset diamonds. Frightened, he drew
back. He collided with a show-case rich in emeralds, rubies and
aquamarines. He put out a plump hand to steady himself. It rested
on a display case of French, Russian and Dutch silver.</p>

<p>Mr. Wall's knees grew weak. He felt a strange prickly sensation
all over him. He took a step&mdash;and was staring at the finest
display of black pearls south of Maiden Lane, New York.</p>

<p>Quickly he turned away. His eyes fell upon the door of a huge
safety vault. It was swinging open!</p>

<p>Little beads of perspiration began to pop out on the forehead of
Martin Wall. His heart was hammering like that of a youth who sees
after a long separation his lady love. His eyes grew glassy.</p>

<p>He took out a silk handkerchief and passed it slowly across his
damp forehead.</p>

<p>Staggering slightly, he stepped again to the trays of unset
stones. The glassy eyes had grown greedy now. He put out one huge
hand as the lover aforesaid might reach toward his lady's hair.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Wall shut his lips firmly, and thrust both of his hands
deep into his trousers pockets. He stood there in the middle of
that gorgeous room&mdash;a fat figure of a man suffering a cruel
inhuman agony.</p>

<p>He was still standing thus when the tall man came running back.
Apprehension clouded that sallow face.</p>

<p>"It was very kind of you." The small eyes of the clerk darted
everywhere; then came back to Martin Wall. "I'm obliged&mdash;why,
what's the matter, sir?"</p>

<p>Martin Wall passed his hand across his eyes, as a man banishing
a terrible dream.</p>

<p>"The little girl?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hardly a scratch," said the clerk, pointing to the smiling
child at his side. "It was lucky, wasn't it?" He was behind the
counter now, studying the trays unprotected on the show-case.</p>

<p>"Very lucky." Martin Wall still had to steady himself. "Perhaps
you'd like to look about a bit before I go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. Everything's all right, I'm sure. You were looking
at these stones&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some other time," said Wall weakly. "I only wanted an idea of
what you had."</p>

<p>"Good day, sir. And thank you very much."</p>

<p>"Not at all." And the limp ex-guardian passed unsteadily from
the store into the glare of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. Tom Stacy, of the Manhattan Club, half dozing on the veranda
of his establishment, was rejoiced to see his old friend Martin
Wall crossing the pavement toward him.</p>

<p>"Well, Martin&mdash;" he began. And then a look of concern came
into his face. "Good lord, man&mdash;what ails you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wall sank like a wet rag to the steps.</p>

<p>"Tom," he said, "a terrible thing has just happened. I was left
alone in Ostby and Blake's jewelry shop."</p>

<p>"Alone?" cried Mr. Stacy. "You&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely alone."</p>

<p>Mr. Stacy leaned over.</p>

<p>"Are you leaving town&mdash;in a hurry?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gloomily Mr. Wall shook his head.</p>

<p>"He put me on my honor," he complained. "Left me in charge of
the shop. Can you beat it? Of course after that,
I&mdash;well&mdash;you know, somehow I couldn't do it. I tried, but
I couldn't."</p>

<p>Mr. Stacy threw back his head, and his raucous laughter smote
the lazy summer afternoon.</p>

<p>"I can't help it," he gasped. "The funniest thing I ever
&mdash;you&mdash;the best stone thief in America alone in charge of
three million dollars' worth of the stuff!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man," whispered Wall. "Not so loud!" And well
might he protest, for Mr. Stacy's indiscreet and mirthful tone
carried far. It carried, for example, to Mr. Richard Minot,
standing hidden behind the curtains of his little room
overhead.</p>

<p>"Come inside, Martin," said Stacy. "Come inside and have a
bracer. You sure must need it, after that."</p>

<p>"I do," replied Mr. Wall, in heartfelt tones. He rose and
followed Tom Stacy.</p>

<p>Cheeks burning, eyes popping, Mr. Minot watched them disappear
into the Manhattan Club.</p>

<p>Here was news indeed. Lord Harrowby's boon companion the ablest
jewel thief in America! Just what did that mean?</p>

<p>Putting on coat and hat, he hurried to the hotel office and
there wrote a cablegram:</p>

<p class="telegram">"Situation suspicious are you dead certain H.
is on the level?"</p>

<p>An hour later, in his London office, Mr. Jephson read this
message carefully three times.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">7. &mdash;CHAIN LIGHTNING'S COLLAR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Villa Jasmine, Mrs. Bruce's winter home, stood
in a park of palms and shrubbery some two blocks from the Hotel de
la Pax. Mr. Minot walked thither that evening in the resplendent
company of Jack Paddock.</p>

<p>"You'll enjoy Mrs. Bruce to-night," Paddock confided. "I've done
her some rather good lines, if I do say it as shouldn't."</p>

<p>"On what topics?" asked Minot, with a smile.</p>

<p>"International marriage&mdash;jewels&mdash;by the way, I don't
suppose you know that Miss Cynthia Meyrick is to appear for the
first time wearing the famous Harrowby necklace?"</p>

<p>"I didn't even know there was a necklace," Minot returned.</p>

<p>"Ah, such ignorance. But then, you don't wander much in feminine
society, do you? Mrs. Bruce told me about it this morning. Chain
Lightning's Collar."</p>

<p>"Chain Lightning's what?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy&mdash;" Mr. Paddock lighted a cigarette. "You should
go round more in royal circles. List, commoner, while I relate. It
seems that the Earl of Raybrook is a giddy old sport with a
gambling streak a yard wide. In his young days he loved the Lady
Evelyn Holloway. Lady Evelyn had a horse entered in a derby about
that time&mdash;name, Chain Lightning. And the Earl of Raybrook
wagered a diamond necklace against a kiss that Chain Lightning
would lose."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that giving big odds?" inquired Minot.</p>

<p>"Not if you believe the stories of Lady Evelyn's beauty. Well,
it happened before Tammany politicians began avenging Ireland on
Derby Day. Chain Lightning won. And the earl came across with the
necklace. Afterward he married Lady Evelyn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To get back the necklace?"</p>

<p>"Cynic. And being a rather racy old boy, he referred to the
necklace thereafter as Chain Lightning's Collar. It got to be
pretty well known in England by that name. I believe it is
considered a rather neat piece of jewelry among the English
nobility&mdash;whose sparklers aren't what they were before the
steel business in Pittsburgh turned out a good thing."</p>

<p>"Chain Lightning's Collar," mused Minot. "I presume Lady Evelyn
was the mother of the present Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"So 'tis rumored," smiled Paddock. "Though I take it his
lordship favors his father in looks."</p>

<p>They walked along for a moment in silence. The story of this
necklace of diamonds could bring but one thing to Minot's
thoughts&mdash;Martin Wall drooping on the steps of the Manhattan
Club while old Stacy roared with joy. He considered. Should he tell
Mr. Paddock? No, he decided he would wait.</p>

<p>"As I said," Paddock ran on, "you'll enjoy Mrs. Bruce to-night.
Her lines are good, but somehow&mdash;it's really a great problem
to me&mdash;she doesn't sound human and natural when she gets them
off. I looked up her beauty doctor and asked him if he couldn't put
a witty gleam in her eye, but he told me he didn't care to go that
far in correcting Mrs. Bruce's Maker."</p>

<p>They had reached the Villa Jasmine now, a great white palace in
a flowery setting more like a dream than a reality. The evening
breeze murmured whisperingly through the palms, a hundred gorgeous
colors shone in the moonlight, fountains splashed coolly amid the
greenery.</p>

<p>"Act Two," muttered Minot. "The grounds surrounding the castle
of the fairy princess."</p>

<p>"You have to come down here, don't you," replied Paddock, "to
realize that old Mother Nature has a little on Belasco, after
all?"</p>

<p>The whir of a motor behind them caused the two young men to
turn. Then Mr. Minot saw her coming up the path toward
him&mdash;coming up that fantastic avenue of palms&mdash;tall,
fair, white, a lovely figure in a lovely setting&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, yes&mdash;Lord Harrowby! He walked at her side, nonchalant,
distinguished, almost as tall as a popular illustrator thinks a man
in evening clothes should be. Truly, they made a handsome couple.
They were to wed. Mr. Minot himself had sworn they were to wed.</p>

<p>He kept the bitterness from his tone as he greeted them there
amid the soft magic of the Florida night. Together they went
inside. In the center of a magnificent hallway they found Mrs.
Bruce standing, like stout Cortez on his Darien peak, triumphant
amid the glory of her gold.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot thought Mrs. Bruce's manner of greeting somewhat
harried and oppressed. Poor lady, every function was a first night
for her. Would the glare of the footlights frighten her? Would she
falter in her lines&mdash;forget them completely? Only her sisters
of the stage could sympathize with her understandingly now.</p>

<p>"So you are to carry Cynthia away?" Minot heard her saying to
Lord Harrowby. "Such a lot of my friends have married into the
peerage. Indeed, I have sometimes thought you English have no other
pastime save that of slipping engagement rings on hands across the
sea."</p>

<p>A soft voice spoke in Minot's ear.</p>

<p>"Mine," Mr. Paddock was saying. "Not bad, eh? But look at that
Englishman. Why should I have sat up all last night writing lines
to try on him? Can you tell me that?"</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby, indeed, seemed oblivious of Mrs. Bruce's little
bon mot. He hemmed and hawed, and said he was a lucky man. But he
did not mean that he was a lucky man because he had the privilege
of hearing Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce slipped out of the shadows into the weariness of
another formal dinner. Mrs. Bruce glittered, and he wrote the
checks. He was a scraggly little man who sometimes sat for hours at
a time in silence. There were those unkind enough to say that he
sought back, trying to recall the reason that had led him to marry
Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>When he beheld Miss Cynthia Meyrick, and knew that he was to
take her in to dinner, Mr. Bruce brightened perceptibly. None save
a blind and deaf man could have failed to. Cocktails consumed, the
party turned toward the dining-room. Except for the Meyricks,
Martin Wall, Lord Harrowby and Paddock, Dick Minot knew none of
them. There were a couple of colorless men from New York who, when
they died, would be referred to as "prominent club men," a horsy
girl from Westchester, an ex-ambassador's wife and daughter, a
number of names from Boston and Philadelphia with their respective
bearers. And last but not least the two Bond girls from
Omaha&mdash;blond, lovely, but inclined to be snobbish even in that
company, for their mother was a Van Reypan, and Van Reypans are
rare birds in Omaha and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot took in the elder of the Bond girls, and found that
Cynthia Meyrick sat on his left. He glanced at her throat as they
sat down. It was bare of ornament. And then he beheld, sparkling in
her lovely hair, the perfect diamonds of Chain Lightning's Collar.
As he turned back to the table he caught the eye of Mr. Martin
Wall. Mr. Wall's eye happened to be coming away from the same
locality.</p>

<p>The girl from Omaha gossiped of plays and players, like a
dramatic page from some old Sunday newspaper.</p>

<p>"I'm mad about the stage," she confided. "Of course, we get all
the best shows in Omaha. Why, Maxine Elliott and Nat Goodwin come
there every year."</p>

<p>Mr. Minot, New Yorker, shuddered. Should he tell her of the many
and active years in the lives of these two since they visited any
town together? No. What use? On the other side of him a sweet voice
spoke:</p>

<p>"I presume you know, Mr. Minot, that Mrs. Bruce has the
reputation of being the wittiest hostess in San Marco?"</p>

<p>"I have heard as much." Minot smiled into Cynthia Meyrick's
eyes. "When does her act go on?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce was wondering the same thing. She knew her lines; she
was ready. True, she understood few of those lines. Wit was not her
specialty. Until Mr. Paddock took charge of her, she had thought
colored newspaper supplements humorous in the extreme. However, the
lines Mr. Paddock taught her seemed to go well, and she continued
to patronize the old stand.</p>

<p>She looked up now from her conversation with her dinner partner,
and silence fell as at a curtain ascending.</p>

<p>"I was just saying to Lord Harrowby," Mrs. Bruce began, smiling
about her, "how picturesque our business streets are here. What
with the Greek merchants in their native costumes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bandits, every one of them," growled Mr. Bruce, bravely
interrupting. His wife frowned.</p>

<p>"Only the other day," she continued, "I bought a rug from a man
who claimed to be a Persian prince. He said it was a prayer-rug,
and I think it must have been, for ever since I got it I've been
praying it's genuine."</p>

<p>A little ripple of amusement ran about the table. The
redoubtable Mrs. Bruce was under way. People spoke to one another
in undertones&mdash;little conversational nudges of
anticipation.</p>

<p>"By the way, Cynthia," the hostess inquired, "have you heard
from Helen Arden lately?"</p>

<p>"Not for some time," responded Miss Meyrick, "although I have
her promise that she and the duke will be here&mdash;next
Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Splendid." Mrs. Bruce turned to his lordship. "I think of
Helen, Lord Harrowby, because she, too, married into your nobility.
Her father made his money in sausage in the Middle West. In his
youth he'd had trouble in finding a pair of ready-made trousers,
but as soon as the money began to roll in, Helen started to look
him up a coat of arms. And a family motto. I remember suggesting at
the time, in view of the sausage: 'A family is no stronger than its
weakest link.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce knew when to pause. She paused now. The ripple became
an outright laugh. Mr. Paddock sipped languorously from his
wine-glass. He saw that his lines "got over."</p>

<p>"Went into society head foremost, Helen did," Mrs. Bruce
continued. "Thought herself a clever amateur actress. Used to act
often for charity&mdash;though I don't recall that she ever got
it."</p>

<p>"The beauty of Mrs. Bruce's wit," said Miss Meyrick in Mr.
Minot's ear, "is that it is so unconscious. She doesn't appear to
realize when she has said a good thing."</p>

<p>"There's just a chance that she doesn't realize it," suggested
Minot.</p>

<p>"Then Helen met the Duke of Lismore," Mrs. Bruce was speaking
once more. "Perhaps you know him, Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;er&mdash;sorry to say I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A charming chap. In some ways. Helen was a Shavian in
considering marriage the chief pursuit of women. She pursued.
Followed Lismore to Italy, where he proposed. I presume he thought
that being in Rome, he must do as the Romeos do."</p>

<p>"But, my dear lady," said Harrowby in a daze, "isn't it the
Romans?"</p>

<p>"Isn't what the Romans?" asked Mrs. Bruce blankly.</p>

<p>"Your lordship is correct," said Mr. Paddock hastily. "Mrs.
Bruce misquoted purposely&mdash;in jest, you know.
Jibe&mdash;japery."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;pardon me," returned his lordship.</p>

<p>"I saw Helen in London last spring," Mrs. Bruce went on. "She
confided to me that she considers her husband a genius. And if
genius really be nothing but an infinite capacity for taking
champagnes, I am sure the poor child is right."</p>

<p>Little murmurs of joy, and the dinner proceeded. The guests bent
over their food, shipped to Mrs. Bruce in a refrigerating car from
New York, and very little wearied by its long trip. Here and there
two talked together. It was like an intermission between the
acts.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot turned to the Omaha girl. Even though she was two
wives behind on Mr. Nat Goodwin's career, one must be polite.</p>

<p>It was at the close of the dinner that Mrs. Bruce scored her
most telling point. She and Lord Harrowby were conversing about a
famous English author, and when she was sure she had the attention
of the table, she remarked:</p>

<p>"Yes, we met his wife at the Masonbys'. But I have always felt
that the wife of a celebrity is like the coupon on one's railway
ticket."</p>

<p>"How's that, Mrs. Bruce?" Minot inquired. After all, Paddock had
been kind to him.</p>

<p>"Not good if detached," said Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>She stood. Her guests followed suit. It was by this bon mot that
she chose to have her dinner live in the gossip of San Marco. Hence
with it she closed the ceremony.</p>

<p>"Witty woman, your wife," said one of the colorless New Yorkers
to Mr. Bruce, when the men were left alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce only grunted, but Mr. Paddock answered brightly:</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;really&mdash;" Mr. Paddock blushed. Modest
author, he.</p>

<p>A servant appeared to say that Lord Harrowby was wanted at once
outside, and excusing himself, Harrowby departed. He found his
valet, a plump, round-faced, serious man, waiting in the shadows on
the veranda. For a time they talked together in low tones. When
Harrowby returned to the dining-room, his never cheerful face was
even gloomier than usual.</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick and Bruce, exiles both of them, talked joyously
of business and the rush of the day's work for which both longed.
The New York man and a sapling from Boston conversed of chamber
music. Martin Wall sat silent, contemplative. Perhaps had he spoken
his thoughts they would have been of a rich jewel shop at
noon&mdash;deserted.</p>

<p>A half-hour later Mrs. Bruce's dinner-party was scattered among
the palms and flowers of her gorgeous lawn. Mr. Minot had fallen
again to the elder girl from Omaha, and blithely for her he was
displaying his Broadway ignorance of horticulture. Suddenly out of
the night came a scream. Instantly when he heard it, Mr. Minot knew
who had uttered it.</p>

<p>Unceremoniously he parted from the Omaha beauty and sped over
the lawn. But quick as he was, Lord Harrowby was quicker. For when
Minot came up, he saw Harrowby bending over Miss Meyrick, who sat
upon a wicker bench.</p>

<p>"Cynthia&mdash;what is it?" Harrowby was saying.</p>

<p>Cynthia Meyrick felt wildly of her shining hair.</p>

<br>

<p>"Your necklace," she gasped. "Chain Lightning's Collar. He took
it! He took it!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. A man!"</p>

<p>"A man!" Reverent repetition by feminine voices out of the
excited group.</p>

<p>"He leaped out at me there&mdash;by that tree&mdash;pinioned my
arms&mdash;snatched the necklace. I couldn't see his face. It
happened in the shadow."</p>

<p>"No matter," Harrowby replied. "Don't give it another thought,
my child."</p>

<p>"But how can I help&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall telephone the police at once," announced Spencer
Meyrick.</p>

<p>"I beg you'll do nothing of the sort," expostulated Lord
Harrowby. "It would be a great inconvenience&mdash;the thing wasn't
worth the publicity that would result. I insist that the police be
kept out of this."</p>

<p>Argument&mdash;loud on Mr. Meyrick's part&mdash;ensued.
Suggestions galore were offered by the guests. But in the end Lord
Harrowby had his way. It was agreed not to call in the police.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot, looking up, saw a sneering smile on the face of
Martin Wall. In a flash he knew the truth.</p>

<p>With Aunt Mary calling loudly for smelling salts, and the whole
party more or less in confusion, the return to the house started.
Mr. Paddock walked at Minot's side.</p>

<p>"Rather looks as though Chain Lightning's Collar had choked off
our gaiety," he mumbled. "Serves her right for wearing the thing in
her hair. She spoiled two corking lines for me by not wearing it
where you'd naturally expect a necklace to be worn."</p>

<p>Minot maneuvered so as to intercept Lord Harrowby under the
portico.</p>

<p>"May I speak with you a moment?" he inquired. Harrowby bowed,
and they stepped into the shadows of the drive.</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby," said Minot, trying to keep the excitement from
his voice, "I have certain information about one of the guests here
this evening that I believe would interest you. Your lordship has
been badly buffaloed. One of our fellow diners at Mrs. Bruce's
table holds the title of the ablest jewel thief in America!"</p>

<p>He watched keenly to catch Lord Harrowby's start of surprise.
Alas, he caught nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said his lordship nonchalantly. "You mustn't let
your imagination carry you away, dear chap."</p>

<p>"Imagination nothing! I know what I'm talking about." And then
Minot added sarcastically: "Sorry to bore you with this."</p>

<p>His lordship laughed.</p>

<p>"Right-o, old fellow. I'm not interested."</p>

<p>"But haven't you just lost&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A diamond necklace? Yes." They had reached a particularly dark
and secluded spot beneath the canopy of palm leaves. Harrowby
turned suddenly and put his hands on Minot's shoulders. "Mr.
Minot," he said, "you are here to see that nothing interferes with
my marriage to Miss Meyrick. I trust you are determined to do your
duty to your employers?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. That is why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then," replied Harrowby quickly, "I am going to ask you to take
charge of this for me."</p>

<p>Suddenly Minot felt something cold and glassy in his hand.
Startled, he looked down. Even in the dark, Chain Lightning's
Collar sparkled like the famous toy that it was.</p>

<p>"Your lordship!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can not explain now. I can only tell you it is quite
necessary that you help me at this time. If you wish to do your
full duty by Mr. Jephson."</p>

<p>"Who took this necklace from Miss Meyrick's hair?" asked Minot
hotly.</p>

<p>"I did. I assure you it was the only way to prevent our plans
from going awry. Please keep it until I ask you for it."</p>

<p>And turning, Lord Harrowby walked rapidly toward the house.</p>

<p>"The brute I" Angrily Mr. Minot stood turning the necklace over
in his hand. "So he frightened the girl he is to marry&mdash;the
girl he is supposed to love&mdash;"</p>

<p>What should he do? Go to her, and tell her of Harrowby's amiable
eccentricities? He could hardly do that&mdash;Harrowby had taken
him into his confidence&mdash;and besides there was Jephson of the
great bald head, the Peter Pan eyes. Nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel from Mrs. Bruce's villa, he found
awaiting him a cable from Jephson. The cable assured him that
beyond any question the man in San Marco was Allan Harrowby and,
like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.</p>

<p>Yet even as he read, Lord Harrowby walked through the lobby, and
at his side was Mr. James O'Malley, house detective of the Hotel de
la Pax. They came from the manager's office, where they had
evidently been closeted.</p>

<p>With the cablegram in his hand, Minot entered the elevator and
ascended to his room. The other hand was in the pocket of his top
coat, closed tightly upon Chain Lightning's Collar&mdash;the bauble
that the Earl of Raybrook had once wagered against a kiss.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">8. &mdash;AFTER THE TRAINED SEALS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MR. MINOT opened his eyes on Thursday morning with
the uncomfortable feeling that he was far from his beloved New
York. For a moment he lay dazed, wandering in that dim borderland
between sleep and waking. Then, suddenly, he remembered.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, by jove," he muttered, "I've been knighted. Groom of
the Back-Stairs Scandals and Keeper of the Royal
Jewels&mdash;that's me."</p>

<p>He lifted his pillow. There on the white sheet sparkled the
necklace of which the whole British nobility was proud&mdash;Chain
Lightning's Collar. Some seventy-five blue-white diamonds,
pear-shaped, perfectly graduated. His for the moment!</p>

<p>"What's Harrowby up to, I wonder?" he reflected. "The dear old
top! Nice, pleasant little party if a policeman should find this in
my pocket."</p>

<p>Another perfect day shone in that narrow Spanish street. Up in
Manhattan theatrical press agents were crowning huge piles of snow
with posters announcing their attractions. Ferries were held up by
ice in the river. A breeze from the Arctic swept round the Flatiron
building. Here lazy summer lolled on the bosom of the town.</p>

<p>In the hotel dining-room Mr. Minot encountered Jack Paddock,
superb in white flannels above his grapefruit. He accepted
Paddock's invitation to join him.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Mrs. Bruce's jester, holding up a small,
badly printed newspaper, "have you made the acquaintance of the
<i>San Marco Mail</i> yet?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>"A morning newspaper&mdash;by courtesy. Started here a few weeks
back by a noiseless little Spaniard from Havana named Manuel
Gonzale. Slipped in here on his rubber soles, Gonzale did
&mdash;dressed all in white&mdash;lovely lemon face&mdash;shifty,
can't-catch-me eyes. And his newspaper&mdash;hot stuff, my boy. It
has Town Topics looking like a consular report from Greenland."</p>

<p>"Scandals?" asked Mr. Minot, also attacking a grapefruit.</p>

<p>"Scandals and rumors of scandals. Mostly hints, you know.
Several references this morning to our proud and haughty friend,
Lord Harrowby. For example, Madame On Dit, writing in her column on
page one, has this to say: 'The impecunious but titled Englishman
who has arrived in our midst recently with the idea of connecting
with certain American dollars has an interesting time ahead of him,
if rumor speaks true. The little incident in the lobby of a local
hotel the other evening&mdash;which was duly reported in this
column at the time&mdash;was but a mild beginning. The gentleman in
charge of the claimant to the title held so jealously by our
British friend promises immediate developments which will be rich,
rare and racy.'"</p>

<p>"Rich, rare and racy," repeated Minot thoughtfully. "Ah,
yes&mdash;we were to watch Mr. Trimmer. I had almost forgot him in
the excitement of last evening. By the way, does the <i>Mail</i>
know anything about the disappearance of Chain Lightning's
Collar?"</p>

<p>"Not as yet," smiled Mr. Paddock, "although Madame On Dit claims
to have been a guest at the dinner. By the way, what do you make of
last night's melodramatic farce?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of it," answered Minot truthfully. He
was suddenly conscious of the necklace in his inside coat
pocket.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say, my dear Watson," replied Mr. Paddock with
burlesque seriousness, "is that you are unmistakably lacking in my
powers of deduction. Give me a cigarette, and I'll tell you the
name of the man who is gloating over those diamonds to-day."</p>

<p>"All right," smiled Minot. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock, reaching for a match tray, spoke in a low tone in
Minot's ear.</p>

<p>"Martin Wall," he said. He leaned back. "You ask how I arrived
at my conclusion. Simple enough. I went through the list of guests
for possible crooks, and eliminated them one by one. The man I have
mentioned alone was left. Ever notice his eyes&mdash;remind me of
Manuel Gonzale's. He's too polished, too slick, too good to be
true. He's traveled too much&mdash;nobody travels as much as he has
except for the very good reason that a detective is on the trail.
And he made friends with simple old Harrowby on an Atlantic
liner&mdash;that, if you read popular fiction, is alone enough to
condemn him. Believe me, Dick, Martin Wall should be watched."</p>

<p>"All right," laughed Minot, "you watch him."</p>

<p>"I've a notion to. Harrowby makes me weary. Won't call in a
solitary detective. Any one might think he doesn't want the
necklace back."</p>

<p>After breakfast Minot and Paddock played five sets of tennis on
the hotel courts. And Mr. Minot won, despite the Harrowby diamonds
in his trousers pocket, weighing him down. Luncheon over, Mr.
Paddock suggested a drive to Tarragona Island.</p>

<p>"A little bit of nowhere a mile off-shore," he said. "No man can
ever know the true inwardness of the word lonesome until he's seen
Tarragona."</p>

<p>Minot hesitated. Ought he to leave the scene of action? Of
action? He glanced about him. There was less action here than in a
Henry James novel. The tangle of events in which he was involved
rested for a siesta.</p>

<p>So he and Mr. Paddock drove along the narrow neck of land that
led from the mainland to Tarragona Island. They entered the kingdom
of the lonely. Sandy beach with the ocean on one side, swamps on
the other. Scrubby palms, disreputable foliage, here and there a
cluster of seemingly deserted cottages&mdash;the world and its
works apparently a million miles away. Yet out on one corner of
that bleak forgotten acre stood the slim outline of a wireless, and
in a little white house lived a man who, amid the sea-gulls and the
sand-dunes, talked daily with great ships and cities far away.</p>

<p>"I told you it was lonesome," said Mr. Paddock.</p>

<p>"Lonesome," shivered Minot. "Even God has forgot this place.
Only Marconi has remembered."</p>

<p>And even as they wandered there amid the swamps, where
alligators and rattlesnakes alone saw fit to dwell, back in San
Marco the capable Mr. Trimmer was busy. By poster and by hand-bill
he was spreading word of his newest coup, so that by evening no one
in town&mdash;save the few who were most concerned&mdash;was
unaware of a development rich, rare and racy.</p>

<p>Minot and Paddock returned late, and their dinner was
correspondingly delayed. It was eight-thirty o'clock when they at
last strolled into the lobby of the De la Pax. There they
encountered Miss Meyrick, her father and Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>"We're taking Harrowby to the movies," said Miss Meyrick. "He
confesses he's never been. Won't you come along?"</p>

<p>She was one of her gay selves to-night, white, slim, laughing,
irresistible. Minot, looking at her, thought that she could make
even Tarragona Island bearable. He knew of no greater tribute to
her charm.</p>

<p>The girl and Harrowby led the way, and Minot and Paddock
followed with Spencer Meyrick. The old man was an imposing figure
in his white serge, which accentuated the floridness of his face.
He talked of an administration that did not please him, of a
railroad fallen on evil days. Now and again he paused and seemed to
lose the thread of what he was saying, while his eyes dwelt on his
daughter, walking ahead.</p>

<p>They arrived shortly at the San Marco Opera House, devoted each
evening to three acts of "refined vaudeville" and six of the newest
film releases. It was here that the rich loitering in San Marco
found their only theatrical amusement, and forgetting Broadway,
laughed and were thrilled with simpler folk. A large crowd was
fairly fighting to get in and Mr. Paddock, who volunteered to buy
the tickets, was forced to take his place at the end of a long
line.</p>

<p>Finally they reached the dim interior of the opera-house, and
were shown to seats far down in front. By hanging back in the dusk
Minot managed to secure the end seat, with Miss Meyrick at his
side. Beyond her sat Lord Harrowby, gazing with rapt British
seriousness at the humorous film that was being flashed on the
screen.</p>

<p>Between pictures Harrowby offered an opinion.</p>

<p>"You in America are a jolly lot," he said. "Just fancy our best
people in England attending a cinematograph exhibition."</p>

<p>They tried to fancy it, but with his lordship there, they
couldn't. Two more pictures ran their filmy lengths, while Mr.
Minot sat entranced there in the half dark. It was not the pictures
that entranced him. Rather, was it a lady's nearness, the flash of
her smile, the hundred and one tones of her voice&mdash;all, all
again as it had been in that ridiculous automobile&mdash;just
before the awakening.</p>

<p>After the third picture the lights of the auditorium were turned
up, and the hour of vaudeville arrived. On to the stage strolled a
pert confident youth garbed in shabby grandeur, who attempted
sidewalk repartee. He clipped his jests from barber-shop
periodicals, bought his songs from an ex-barroom song writer, and
would have gone to the mat with any one who denied that his act was
"refined." Mr. Minot, listening to his gibes, thought of the
Paddock jest factory and Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>When the young man had wrung the last encore from a kindly
audience, the drop-curtain was raised and revealed on the stage in
gleaming splendor Captain Ponsonby's troupe of trained seals. An
intelligent aggregation they proved, balancing balls on their small
heads, juggling flaming torches, and taking as their just due lumps
of sugar from the captain's hand as they finished each feat. The
audience recalled them again and again, and even the peerage was
captivated.</p>

<p>"Clever beasts, aren't they?" Lord Harrowby remarked. And as
Captain Ponsonby took his final curtain, his lordship added:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;what follows the trained seals?"</p>

<p>The answer to Harrowby's query came almost immediately, and a
startling answer it proved to be.</p>

<p>Into the glare of the footlights stepped Mr. Henry Trimmer. His
manner was that of the conquering hero. For a moment he stood
smiling and bowing before the approving multitude. Then he raised a
hand commanding silence.</p>

<p>"My dear friends," he said, "I appreciate this reception. As I
said in my hand-bill of this afternoon, I am working in the
interests of justice. The gentleman who accompanies me to your
delightful little city is beyond any question whatsoever George
Harrowby, the eldest son of the Earl of Raybrook, and as such he is
entitled to call himself Lord Harrowby. I know the American people
well enough to feel sure that when they realize the facts they will
demand that justice be done. That is why I have prevailed upon Lord
Harrowby to meet you here in this, your temple of amusement, and
put his case before you. His lordship will talk to you for a time
with a view to getting acquainted. He has chosen for the subject of
his discourse The Old Days at Rakedale Hall. Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the honor to introduce&mdash;the real Lord Harrowby."</p>

<p>Out of the wings shuffled the lean and gloomy Englishman whom
Mr. Trimmer had snatched from the unknown to cloud a certain
wedding day. The applause burst forth. It shook the building. From
the gallery descended a shrill penetrating whistle of acclaim.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot glanced at the face of the girl beside him. She was
looking straight ahead, her cheeks bright red, her eyes flashing
with anger. Beyond, the face of Harrowby loomed, frozen,
terrible.</p>

<p>"Shall we&mdash;go?" Minot whispered.</p>

<p>"By no means," the girl answered. "We should only call attention
to our presence here. I know at least fifty people in this
audience. We must see it through."</p>

<p>The applause was stilled at last and, supremely fussed, the
"real Lord Harrowby" faced that friendly throng.</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;er&mdash;people," he said. "As Mr. Trimmer has told
you, we seek only justice. I am not here to argue my right to the
title I claim&mdash;that I can do at the proper time and place. I
am simply proposing to go back&mdash;back into the past many
years&mdash;back to the days when I was a boy at Rakedale Hall. I
shall picture those days as no impostor could picture
them&mdash;and when I have done I shall allow you to judge."</p>

<p>And there in that crowded little southern opera-house on that
hot February night, the actor who followed the trained seals
proceeded to go back. With unfaltering touch he sketched for his
audience the great stone country seat called Rakedale Hall, where
for centuries the Harrowbys had dwelt. It was as though he took his
audience there to visit&mdash;through the massive iron gates up the
broad avenue bordered with limes, until the high chimneys, the
pointed gables, the mullioned windows, and the walls half hidden by
ivy, creeping roses and honeysuckles were revealed to them. He took
them through the house to the servants' quarters&mdash;which he
called "the offices"&mdash;out into the kitchen gardens, thence to
the paved quadrangle of the stables with its arched gateway and the
chiming clock above. Tennis-courts, grape-houses, conservatories,
they visited breathlessly; they saw over the brow of the hill the
low square tower of the old church and the chimneys of the vicar's
modest house. And far away, they beheld the trees that furnished
cover to the little beasts it was the Earl of Raybrook's pleasure
to hunt in the season.</p>

<p>Becoming more specific, he spoke of the neighbors, and a bit of
romance crept in in the person of the fair-haired Honorable Edith
Townshend, who lived to the west of Rakedale Hall. He described at
length the picturesque personality of the "racing parson," neighbor
on the south, and in full accord with the ideas of the sporting
Earl of Ray brook.</p>

<p>The events of his youth, he said, crowded back upon him as he
recalled this happy scene, and emotion well-nigh choked him.
However, he managed to tell of a few of the celebrities who came to
dinner, of their bon mots, their preferences in cuisine. He
mentioned the thrilling morning when he was nearly drowned in the
brook that skirted the "purple meadow"; also the thrilling
afternoon when he hid his mother's famous necklace in the biscuit
box on the sideboard, and upset a whole household. And he narrated
a dozen similar exploits, each garnished with small illuminating
details.</p>

<p>His audience sat fascinated. All who listened felt that his
words rang true&mdash;even Lord Harrowby himself, sitting far
forward, his hand gripping the seat in front of him until the white
of his knuckles showed through.</p>

<p>Next the speaker shifted his scene to Eton, thrilled his hearers
with the story of his revolt against Oxford, of his flight to the
States, his wild days in Arizona. And he pulled out of his pocket a
letter written by the old Earl of Raybrook himself, profanely
expostulating with him for his madness, and begging that he return
to ascend to the earldom when the old man was no more.</p>

<p>The "real Lord Harrowby" finished reading this somewhat pathetic
appeal with a little break in his voice, and stood looking out at
the audience.</p>

<p>"If my brother Allan himself were in the house," he said, "he
would have to admit that it is our father speaking in that
letter."</p>

<p>A rustle of interest ran through the auditorium. The few who had
recognized Harrowby turned to stare at him now. For a moment he sat
silent, his face a variety of colors in the dim light. Then with a
cry of rage he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"You stole that letter, you cur," he cried. "You are a liar, a
fraud, an impostor."</p>

<p>The man on the stage stood shading his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, Allan," he answered, "so you are here, after all? Is that
quite the proper greeting&mdash;after all these years?"</p>

<p>A roar of sympathetic applause greeted this sally. There was no
doubt as to whose side Mr. Trimmer's friend, the public, was on.
Harrowby stood in his place, his lips twitching, his eyes for once
blazing and angry.</p>

<p>Dick Minot was by this time escorting Miss Meyrick up the aisle,
and they came quickly to the cool street. Harrowby, Paddock and
Spencer Meyrick followed immediately. His lordship was most
contrite.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons," he pleaded. "Really I can't tell you how
sorry I am, Cynthia. To have made you conspicuous&mdash;what was I
thinking of? But he maddened me&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Allan," said Miss Meyrick gently. "I like you the
better for being maddened."</p>

<p>Old Spencer Meyrick said nothing, but Minot noted that his face
was rather red, and his eyes were somewhat dangerous. They all
walked back to the hotel in silence.</p>

<p>From the hotel lobby, as if by prearrangement, Harrowby followed
Miss Meyrick and her father into a parlor. Minot and Paddock were
left alone.</p>

<p>"My word, old top," said Mr. Paddock facetiously, "a rough night
for the nobility. What do you think? That lad's story sounded like
a little bit of all right to me. Eh, what?"</p>

<p>"It did sound convincing," returned the troubled Minot. "But
then&mdash;a servant at Rakedale Hall could have concocted it."</p>

<p>"Mayhap," said Mr. Paddock. "However, old Spencer Meyrick looked
to me like a volcano I'd want to get out from under. Poor old
Harrowby! I'm afraid there's a rift within the loot&mdash;nay, no
loot at all."</p>

<p>"Jack," said Minot firmly, "that wedding has got to take
place."</p>

<p>"Why, what's it to you?"</p>

<p>"It happens to be everything. But keep it under your hat."</p>

<p>"Great Scott&mdash;does Harrowby owe you money?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain just at present, Jack."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," replied Mr. Paddock. "But take it from me, old
man&mdash;she's a million times too good for him."</p>

<p>"A million," laughed Mr. Minot bitterly. "You
underestimate."</p>

<p>Paddock stood staring with wonder at his friend.</p>

<p>"You lisp in riddles, my boy," he said.</p>

<p>"Do I?" returned Minot. "Maybe some day I'll make it all
clear."</p>

<p>He parted from Paddock and ascended to the third floor. As he
wandered through the dark passageways in search of his room, he
bumped suddenly into a heavy man, walking softly. Something about
the contour of the man in the dark gave him a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Wall," he said.</p>

<p>The scurry of hurrying footsteps, but no answer. Minot went on
to 389, and placed his key in the lock. It would not turn. He
twisted the knob of the door&mdash;it was unlocked. He stepped
inside and flashed on the light.</p>

<p>His small abode was in a mad disorder. The chiffonier drawers
had been emptied on the floor, the bed was torn to pieces, the rug
thrown in a corner. Minot smiled to himself.</p>

<p>Some one had been searching&mdash;searching for Chain
Lightning's Collar. Who? Who but the man he had bumped against in
that dark passageway?</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">9. &mdash;"WANTED: BOARD AND ROOM"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Dick Minot bent over to pick up his scattered
property, a knock sounded on the half-open door, and Lord Harrowby
drooped in. The nobleman was gloom personified. He threw himself
despondently down on the bed.</p>

<p>"Minot, old chap," he drawled, "it's all over." His eyes took in
the wreckage. "Eh? What the deuce have you been doing, old
boy?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been doing anything," Minot answered. "But others
have been busy. While we were at the&mdash;er&mdash;theater, fond
fingers have been searching for Chain Lightning's Collar."</p>

<p>"The devil! You haven't lost it?"</p>

<p><a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a>
</p>
<br>

<div align="center"><img src="1301841h-images/LoveInsurance-04.jpg"

</div>
<br>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet, I believe." Minot took the envelope from his
pocket and drew out the gleaming necklace. "Ah, it's still
safe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harrowby leaped from the bed and slammed shut the door.</p>

<p>"Dear old boy," he cried, "keep the accursed thing in your
pocket. No one must see it. I say, who's been searching here? Do
you think it could have been O'Malley?"</p>

<p>"What is O'Malley's interest in your necklace?"</p>

<p>"Some other time, please. Sorry to inconvenience you with the
thing. Do hang on to it, won't you? Awful mix-up if you didn't. Bad
mix-up as it is. As I said when I came in, it's all over."</p>

<p>"What's all over?"</p>

<p>"Everything. The marriage&mdash;my chance for
happiness&mdash;Minot, I'm a most unlucky chap. Meyrick has just
postponed the wedding in a frightfully loud tone of voice."</p>

<p>"Postponed it?" Sad news for Jephson this, yet as he spoke Mr.
Minot felt a thrill of joy in his heart. He smiled the pleasantest
smile he had so far shown San Marco.</p>

<p>"Exactly. He was fearfully rattled, was Meyrick. My word, how he
did go on. Considers his daughter humiliated by the antics of that
creature we saw on the stage to-night. Can't say I blame him,
either. The wedding is indefinitely postponed, unless that impostor
is removed from the scene immediately."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;unless," said Minot. His heart sank. His smile
vanished.</p>

<p>"Unless was the word, I fancy," said Harrowby, blinking
wisely.</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby," Minot began, "you intimated the other day that
this man might really be your brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Harrowby broke in. "Impossible. I got a good look at the
chap to-night. He's no more a Harrowby than you are."</p>

<p>"You give me your word for that?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. Even after twenty years of America no Harrowby
would drag his father's name on to the vaudeville stage. No, he is
an impostor, and as such he deserves no consideration whatever. And
by the by, Minot&mdash;you will note that the postponement is
through no fault of mine."</p>

<p>Minot made a wry face.</p>

<p>"I have noted it," he said. "In other words, I go on to the
stage now&mdash;following the man who followed the trained seals. I
thought my role was that of Cupid, but it begins to look more like
Captain Kidd. Ah, well&mdash;I'll do my best." He stood up. "I'm
going out into the soft moonlight for a little while, Lord
Harrowby. While I'm gone you might call Spencer Meyrick up and ask
him to do nothing definite in the way of postponement until he
hears from me&mdash;us&mdash;er&mdash;you."</p>

<p>"Splendid of you, really," said Harrowby enthusiastically, as
Minot held open the door for him. "I had the feeling I could fall
back on you."</p>

<p>"And I have the feeling that you've fallen," smiled Minot. "So
long&mdash;better wait up for my report."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, seated in a small rowboat on the starry
waters of the harbor, Minot was loudly saluting the yacht
<i>Lileth</i>. Finally Mr. Martin Wall appeared at the rail.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what d'you want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"A word with you, Mr. Wall," Minot answered. "Will you be good
enough to let down your accommodation ladder?"</p>

<p>For a moment Wall hesitated. And Minot, watching him, knew why
he hesitated. He suspected that the young man in the tiny boat
there on the calm bright waters had come to repay a call earlier in
the evening&mdash;a call made while the host was out. At last he
decided to let down the ladder.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," he announced genially as Minot came on
deck.</p>

<p>"Awfully nice of you to say that," Minot laughed. "Reassures me.
Because I've heard there are sharks in these waters."</p>

<p>They sat down in wicker chairs on the forward deck. Minot stared
at the cluster of lights that was San Marco by night.</p>

<p>"Corking view you have of that tourist-haunted town," he
commented.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes," Mr. Wall's queer eyes narrowed. "Did you row out
here to tell me that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"A deserved rebuke," Minot returned. "Time flies, and my errand
is a pressing one. Am I right in assuming, Mr. Wall, that you are
Lord Harrowby's friend?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Good. Then you will want to help him in the very serious
difficulty in which he now finds himself. Mr. Wall, the man who
calls himself the real Lord Harrowby made his debut on a vaudeville
stage to-night."</p>

<p>"So I've heard," said Wall, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby's fiancee and her father are greatly disturbed.
They insist that this impostor must be removed from the scene at
once, or there will be no wedding. Mr. Wall&mdash;it is up to you
and me to remove him."</p>

<p>"Just what is your interest in the matter?" Wall inquired.</p>

<p>"The same as yours. I am Harrowby's friend. Now, Mr. Wall, this
is the situation as I see it&mdash;wanted, board and room in a
quiet neighborhood for Mr. George Harrowby. Far from the
street-cars, the vaudeville stage, the wedding march and other
disturbing elements. And what is more, I think I've found the quiet
neighborhood. I think it's right here aboard the
<i>Lileth</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes. A simple affair to arrange, Mr. Wall. Trimmer and his live
proposition are just about due for their final appearance of the
night at the opera-house right now. I will call at the stage door
and lead Mr. Trimmer away after his little introductory speech. I
will keep him away until you and a couple of your sailors&mdash;I
suggest the two I met so informally in the North River&mdash;have
met the vaudeville lord at the stage door and gently, but firmly,
persuaded him to come aboard this boat."</p>

<p>Mr. Wall regarded Minot with a cynical smile.</p>

<p>"A clever scheme," he said. "What would you say was the penalty
for kidnaping in this state?"</p>

<p>"Oh, why look it up?" asked Minot carelessly. "Surely Martin
Wall is not afraid of a backwoods constable."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, my boy?" said Wall, with an ugly
stare.</p>

<p>"What do you think I mean?" Minot smiled back. "I'd be very glad
to take the role I've assigned you&mdash;I can't help feeling that
it will be more entertaining than the one I have. The difficulty in
the way is Trimmer. I believe I am better fitted to engage his
attention. I know him better than you do, and he trusts
me&mdash;begging your pardon&mdash;further."</p>

<p>"He did give me a nasty dig," said Wall, flaming at the
recollection. "The noisy mountebank! Well, my boy, your young
enthusiasm has won me. I'll do what I can."</p>

<p>"And you can do a lot. Watch me until you see me lead Trimmer
away. Then get his pet. I'll steer Trimmer somewhere near the
beach, and keep an eye on the <i>Lileth</i>. When you get George
safely aboard, wave a red light in the bow. Then Trimmer and I
shall part company for the night."</p>

<p>"I'm on," said Wall, rising. "Anything to help Harrowby.
And&mdash;this won't be the first time I've waited at the stage
door."</p>

<p>"Right-o," said Minot. "But don't stop to buy a champagne supper
for a trained seal, will you? I don't want to have to listen to Mr.
Trimmer all night."</p>

<p>They rowed ashore in company with two husky members of the
yacht's crew, and ten minutes later Minot was walking with the
pompous Mr. Trimmer through the quiet plaza. He had told that
gentleman that he came from Allan Harrowby to talk terms, and
Trimmer was puffed with pride accordingly.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Harrowby has come to his senses at last," he said.
"Well, I thought this vaudeville business would bring him round.
Although I must say I'm a bit disappointed&mdash;down in my heart.
My publicity campaign has hardly started. I had so many lovely
little plans for the future&mdash;say, it makes me sad to win so
soon."</p>

<p>"Sorry," laughed Minot. "Lord Harrowby, however, deems it best
to call a halt. He suggests&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interrupted Mr. Trimmer grandiloquently. "As the
victor in the contest, I shall do any suggesting that is done. And
what I suggest is this&mdash;to-morrow morning I shall call upon
Allan Harrowby at his hotel. I shall bring George with me, also
some newspaper friends of mine. In front of the crowd Allan
Harrowby must acknowledge his brother as the future heir to the
earldom of Raybrook."</p>

<p>"Why the newspaper men?" Minot inquired.</p>

<p>"Publicity," said Trimmer. "It's the breath of life to
me&mdash;my business, my first love, my last. Frankly, I want all
the advertisement out of this thing I can get. At what hour shall
we call?"</p>

<p>"You would not consider a delay of a few days?" Minot asked.</p>

<p>"Save your breath," advised Trimmer promptly.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I feared it," laughed Minot. "Well then&mdash;shall we
say eleven o'clock? You are to call&mdash;with George
Harrowby."</p>

<p>"Eleven it is," said Trimmer. They had reached a little park by
the harbor's edge. Trimmer looked at his watch. "And that being all
settled, I'll run back to the theater."</p>

<p>"I myself have advised Harrowby to surrender&mdash;" Minot
began.</p>

<p>"Wise boy. Good night," said Trimmer, moving away.</p>

<p>"Not that I have been particularly impressed by your standing as
a publicity man," continued Minot.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," went on Minot. "I never heard of you or
any of the things you claim to have advertised, until I came to San
Marco."</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer came slowly back up the gravel walk.</p>

<p>"In just what inland hamlet, untouched by telegraph, telephone,
newspaper and railroad," he asked, "have you been living?"</p>

<p>Minot dropped to a handy bench, and smiled up into Mr. Trimmer's
thin face.</p>

<p>"New York City," he replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer glanced back at the lights of San Marco,
hesitatingly. Then&mdash;it was really a cruel temptation&mdash;he
sat down beside Minot on the bench.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," he inquired, "that you lived in New.
York two years ago and didn't hear of Cotrell's Ink Eraser?"</p>

<p>"Such was my unhappy fate," smiled Minot.</p>

<p>"Then you were in. Ludlow Street jail, that's all I've got to
say," Trimmer replied. "Why, man&mdash;what I did for that eraser
is famous. I rigged up a big electric sign in Times Square and all
night long I had an electric Cotrell's erasing indiscreet
sentences&mdash;the kind of things people write when they get
foolish with their fountain pens&mdash;for instance&mdash;'I hereby
deed to Tottie Footlights all my real and personal
property'&mdash;and the like. It took the town by storm. Theatrical
managers complained that people preferred to stand and look at my
sign rather than visit the shows. Can you look me in the eye and
say that you never saw that sign?"</p>

<p>"Well," Minot answered, "I begin to remember a little about it
now."</p>

<p>"Of course you do." Mr. Trimmer gave him a congratulatory slap
on the knee. "And if you think hard, probably you can recall my
neat little stunt of the prima donna and the cough drops. I want to
tell you about that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He spoke with fervor. The story of his brave deeds rose high to
shatter the stars apart. A half-hour passed while his picturesque
reminiscences flowed on. Mr. Minot sat enraptured&mdash;his eyes on
the harbor where the <i>Lileth</i>, like a painted ship, graced a
painted ocean.</p>

<p>"My boy," Trimmer was saying, "I have made the public stop, look
and listen. When I get my last publicity in the shape of an 'In
Memoriam' let them run that tag on my headstone. And the story of
me that I guess will be told longest after I am gone, is the one
about the grape juice that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. His audience was not listening; he felt it
intuitively. Mr. Minot sat with his eyes on the <i>Lileth</i>. In
the bow of that handsome boat a red light had been waved three
times.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trimmer," Minot said, "your tales are more interesting than
the classics." He stood. "Some other time I hope to hear a
continuation of them. Just at present Lord Harrowby&mdash;or Mr. if
you prefer&mdash;is waiting to hear what arrangement I have made
with you. You must pardon me."</p>

<p>"I can talk as we walk along," said Trimmer, and proved it. In
the middle of the deserted plaza they separated. At the dark stage
door of the opera-house Trimmer sought his proposition.</p>

<p>"Who d'yer mean?" asked the lone stage-hand there.</p>

<p>"George, Lord Harrowby," insisted Mr. Trimmer.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;that bum actor. Seen him going away a while back with
two men that called for him."</p>

<p>"Bum actor!" cried Trimmer indignantly. He stopped. "Two
men&mdash;who were they?"</p>

<p>The stage-hand asked profanely how he could know that, and Mr.
Trimmer hurriedly departed for the side-street boarding-house where
he and his fallen nobleman shared a suite.</p>

<p>About the same time Dick Minot blithely entered Lord Harrowby's
apartments in the Hotel de la Pax.</p>

<p>"Well," he announced, "you can cheer up. Little George is
painlessly removed. He sleeps to-night aboard the good ship
<i>Lileth</i>, thanks to the efforts of Martin Wall, assisted by
yours truly." He stopped, and stared in awe at his lordship.
"What's the matter with you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>Harrowby waved a hopeless hand.</p>

<p>"Minot," he said, "it was good of you. But while you have been
assisting me so kindly in that quarter, another&mdash;and a
greater&mdash;blow has fallen."</p>

<p>"Good lord&mdash;what?" cried Minot.</p>

<p>"It is no fault of mine&mdash;" Harrowby began.</p>

<p>"On which I would have gambled my immortal soul," Minot
said.</p>

<p>"I thought it was all over and done with&mdash;five years ago. I
was young&mdash;sentimental&mdash;calcium-light and grease paint
and that sort of thing hit me hard. I saw her from the
stalls&mdash;fell desperately in love&mdash;stayed so for six
months&mdash;wrote letters&mdash;burning letters&mdash;and
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and now?"</p>

<p>"Now she's here. Gabrielle Rose is here. She's here&mdash;with
the letters."</p>

<p>"Oh, for a Cotrell's Ink Eraser," Minot groaned.</p>

<p>"My man saw her down-stairs," went on Harrowby, mopping his damp
forehead. "Fifty thousand she wants for the letters or she gives
them to a newspaper and begins to sue&mdash;at once
&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Minot, "she is the usual Gaiety girl."</p>

<p>"Not the usual, old chap. Quite a remarkable woman. She'll do
what she promises&mdash;trust her. And I haven't a farthing.
Minot&mdash;it's all up now. There's no way out of this."</p>

<p>Minot sat thinking. The telephone rang.</p>

<p>"I won't talk to her," cried Harrowby in a panic. "I won't have
anything to do with her. Minot, old chap&mdash;as a favor to
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The old family solicitor," smiled Minot. "That's me."</p>

<p>He took down the receiver. But no voice that had charmed
thousands at the Gaiety answered his. Instead there came over the
wire, heated, raging, the tones of Mr. Henry Trimmer.</p>

<p>"Hello&mdash;I want Allan Harrowby&mdash;ah, that's Minot
talking, isn't it? Yes. Good. I want a word with you. Do you know
what I think of your methods? Well, you won't now&mdash;telephone
rules in the way. Think you're going to get ahead of Trimmer, do
you? Think you've put one over, eh? Well&mdash;let me tell you,
you're wrong. You're in for it now. You've played into my hands.
Steal Lord Harrowby, will you? Do you know what that means?
Publicity. Do you know what I'll do to-morrow? I'll start a cyclone
in this town that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night," said Minot, and hung up.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" Harrowby wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Our friend Trimmer, on the war-path," Minot replied. "It seems
he's missed his vaudeville partner." He sat down. "See here,
Harrowby," he said&mdash;it was the first time he had dropped the
prefix, "it occurs to me that an unholy lot of things are happening
to spoil this wedding. So I'm going to ask you a question."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Harrowby"&mdash;Minot looked straight into the weak, but noble
eyes&mdash;"are you on the level?"</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;I'm not very expert in your astounding
language&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you straight&mdash;honest&mdash;do you want to be married
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why, Minot, my dear chap! I've told you a thousand
times&mdash;I want nothing more&mdash;I never shall want anything
more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," said Minot, rising. "Then go to bed and sleep the
sleep of the innocent."</p>

<p>"But where are you going? What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to try and do the same."</p>

<p>And as he went out, Minot slammed the door on a peer.</p>

<p>Sticking above the knob of the door of 389 he found a telegram.
Turning on his lights, he sank wearily down on the bed and tore it
open.</p>

<p>"It rained in torrents," said the telegram, "at the dowager
duchess's garden party. You know what that means."</p>

<p>It was signed "John Thacker."</p>

<p>"Isn't that a devil of a night-cap?" muttered Minot
gloomily.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">10. &mdash;TWO BIRDS OF PASSAGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ON the same busy night when the <i>Lileth</i>
flashed her red signal and Miss Gabrielle Rose arrived with a
package of letters that screamed for a Cotrell, two strangers
invaded San Marco by means of the eight-nineteen freight south.
Frayed, fatigued and famished as they were, it would hardly have
been kind to study them as they strolled up San Sebastian Avenue
toward the plaza. But had you been so unkind, you would never have
guessed that frequently, in various corners of the little round
globe, they had known prosperity, the weekly pay envelope, and the
buyer's crook of the finger summoning a waiter.</p>

<p>One of the strangers was short, with flaming red hair and in his
eye the twinkle without which the collected works of Bernard Shaw
are as sounding brass. He twinkled about him as he walked&mdash;at
the bright lights and spurious gaiety under the spell of which San
Marco sought to forget the rates per day with bath.</p>

<p>"The French," he mused, "are a volatile people, fond of light
wines and dancing. So, it would seem, are the inhabitants of San
Marco. White flannels, Harry, white flannels. They should encase
that leaning tower of Pisa you call your manly form."</p>

<p>The other&mdash;long, cadaverous, immersed in a gentle
melancholy&mdash;groaned.</p>

<p>"Another tourist hothouse! Packed with innocents abroad, and
everybody bleeding 'em but us. Everything here but a real home,
with chintz table-covers and a cold roast of beef in the ice-chest.
What are we doing here? We should have gone north."</p>

<p>"Ah, Harry, chide me no more," pleaded the little man. "I was
weak, I know, but all the freights seemed to be coming south, and I
have always longed for a winter amid the sunshine and flowers. Look
at this fat old duffer coming! Alms! For the love of Allah,
alms!"</p>

<p>"Shut up," growled the thin one. "Save your breath till we stand
hat in hand in the office of the local newspaper. A job! Two jobs!
Good lord, there aren't two newspaper jobs in the entire South.
Well&mdash;we can only be kicked out into the night again. And
perhaps staked to a meal, in the name of the guild in which we have
served so long and liquidly."</p>

<p>"Some day," said the short man dreamily, "when I am back in the
haunts of civilization again, I am going to start something. A
Society for Melting the Stone Hearts of Editors. Motto: 'Have a
heart&mdash;have a heart!' Emblem, a roast beef sandwich rampant,
on a cloth of linen. Ah, well&mdash;the day will come."</p>

<p>They halted in the plaza. In the round stone tub provided, the
town alligator dozed. Above him hung a warning sign:</p>

<p>"Do not feed or otherwise annoy the alligator."</p>

<p>The short man read, and drew back with a tragic groan.</p>

<p>"Feed or otherwise annoy!" he cried. "Heavens, Harry, is that
the way they look at it here? This is no place for us. We'd better
be moving on to the next town."</p>

<p>But the lean stranger gave no heed. Instead he stepped over and
entered into earnest converse with a citizen of San Marco. In a
moment he returned to his companion's side.</p>

<p>"One newspaper," he announced. "The <i>Evening Chronicle</i>.
Suppose the office is locked for the night&mdash;but come along,
let's try."</p>

<p>"Feed or otherwise annoy," muttered the little man blankly. "For
the love of Allah&mdash;alms I"</p>

<p>They traversed several side streets, and came at last to the
office of the <i>Chronicle</i>. It was a modest structure, verging
on decay. One man sat alone in the dim interior, reading exchanges
under an electric lamp.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the short man genially. "Are you the
editor?"</p>

<p>"Uh, huh," responded the <i>Chronicle</i> man without
enthusiasm, from under his green eye-shade.</p>

<p>"Glad to know you. We just dropped in&mdash;a couple of
newspaper men, you know. This is Mr. Harry Howe, until recently
managing editor of the Mobile <i>Press</i>. My own name is Robert
O'Neill&mdash;a humble editorial writer on the same sheet."</p>

<p>"Uh, huh. If you had jobs for God's sake why did you leave
them?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you may well ask." The red-haired one dropped, uninvited,
into a chair. "Old man, it's a dramatic story. The chief of police
of Mobile happened to be a crook and a grafter, and we happened to
mention it in the <i>Press</i>. Night before last twenty-five armed
cops invaded the peace and sanctity of our sanctum. Harry and
I&mdash;pure accident&mdash;landed in the same general heap at the
foot of the fire-escape out back. And here we are! Here we
are!"</p>

<p>"My newspaper instinct," said the <i>Chronicle</i> man, "had
already enabled me to gather that last."</p>

<p>Sarcasm. It was a bad sign. But blithely Bob O'Neill
continued.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said, "two experienced newspaper men, down and
out. We thought there might possibly be a vacancy or two on the
staff of your paper&mdash;"</p>

<p>The editor threw off his eye-shade, revealing a cynical
face.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, "I thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I've
been running this alleged newspaper for two long dreary years, and
this laugh you've just handed me is the first I've had during that
time. Vacancies! There is one&mdash;a big one. See my pocket for
particulars. Two years, boys. And all the time
hoping&mdash;praying&mdash;that some day I'd make two dollars and
sixty cents, which is the railroad fare to the next town."</p>

<p>Howe and O'Neill listened with faces that steadily grew more
sorrowful.</p>

<p>"I'd like to stake you to a meal," the editor went on. "But a
man's first duty is to his family. Any burglar will tell you
that."</p>

<p>"I suppose," ventured O'Neill, most of the flash gone from his
manner, "there is no other newspaper here?"</p>

<p>"No, there isn't. There's a weird thing here called the <i>San
Marco Mail</i>&mdash;a morning outrage. It's making money, but by
different methods than I'd care to use. You might try there. You
look unlucky. Perhaps they'd take you on."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair, and gave them directions for reaching
the <i>Mail</i> office.</p>

<p>"Good night, boys," he said. "Thank you for calling. You're the
first newspaper men I've seen in two years, except when I've looked
in the glass. And the other day I broke my looking-glass. Good
night, and bad luck go with you to the extent of jobs on the
<i>Mail</i>."</p>

<p>"Cynic," breathed O'Neill in the street. "A bitter tongue maketh
a sour face. I liked him not. A morning outrage called the
<i>Mail</i>. Sounds promising&mdash;like smallpox in the next
county."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Howe, "that which meets our vision.
Forward, march!"</p>

<p>"The alligator and I," muttered O'Neill, "famished, perishing.
For the love of Allah, as I remarked before, alms!"</p>

<p>In the dark second-floor hallway where the <i>Mail</i> office
was suspected of being, they groped about determinedly. No sign of
any nature proclaimed San Marco's only morning paper. A solitary
light, shining through a transom, beckoned. Boldly O'Neill pushed
open the door.</p>

<p>To the knowing nostrils of the two birds of passage was wafted
the odor they loved, the unique inky odor of a newspaper shop.
Their eyes beheld a rather bare room, a typewriter or two, a desk.
In the center of the room was a small table under an electric lamp.
On this table was a bottle and glasses, and at it two silent men
played poker. One of the men was burly and bearded; the other was
slight, pale, nervous. From an inner room came the click of
linotypes&mdash;lonesome linotypes that seemed to have strayed far
from their native haunts.</p>

<p>The two men finished playing the hand, and looked up.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said O'Neill, with a smile that had drawn news
as a magnet draws steel in many odd corners. "Gentlemen, four
newspaper men meet in a strange land. I perceive you have on the
table a greeting unquestionably suitable."</p>

<p>The bearded man laughed, rose and discovered two extra glasses
on a near-by shelf.</p>

<p>"Draw up," he said heartily. "The place is yours. You're as
welcome as pay-day."</p>

<p>"Thanks." O'Neill reached for a glass. "Let me introduce
ourselves." And he mentioned his own name and Howe's.</p>

<p>"Call me Mears," said the bearded one. "I'm managing editor of
the <i>Mail</i>. And this is my city editor, Mr. Elliott."</p>

<p>"Delighted," breathed O'Neill. "A pleasant little haven you have
found here. And your staff&mdash;I don't see the members of your
staff running in and out?"</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Neill," said Mears impressively, "you have drunk with the
staff of the <i>Mail</i>."</p>

<p>"You two?" O'Neill's face shone with joy. "Glory be&mdash;do you
hear that, Harry? These gentlemen all alone on the premises." He
leaned over, and poured out eloquently the story of the tragic
flight from Mobile. "I call this luck," he finished. "Here we are,
broke, eager for work. And we find you minus a&mdash;"</p>

<p>O'Neill stopped. For he had seen a sickly smile of derision
float across the face of the weary city editor. And he saw the
bearded man shaking his great head violently.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," said the bearded man firmly. "Sorry to dash
your hopes&mdash;always ready to pour another drink.
But&mdash;there are no vacancies here. No, sir. Two of us are
plenty and running over, eh, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Plenty and running over," agreed the city editor warmly.</p>

<p>Into their boots tumbled the hearts of the two strangers in a
strange land. Gloom and hunger engulfed them. But the managing
editor of the <i>Mail</i> was continuing&mdash;and what was this he
was saying?</p>

<p>"No, boys&mdash;we don't need a staff. Have just as much use for
a manicure set. But&mdash;you come at an opportune time.
<i>Wanderlust</i>&mdash;it tickles the soles of four feet to-night,
and those four feet are editorial feet on the <i>Mail</i>.
Something tells us that we are going away from here. Boys&mdash;how
would you like our jobs?"</p>

<p>He stared placidly at the two strangers. O'Neill put one hand to
his head.</p>

<p>"See me safely to my park bench, Harry," he said. "It was that
drink on an empty stomach. I'm all in a daze. I hear strange
things."</p>

<p>"I hear 'em, too," said Howe. "See here"&mdash;he turned to
Mears&mdash;"are you offering to resign in our favor?"</p>

<p>"The minute you say the word."</p>

<p>"Both of you?"</p>

<p>"Believe me," said the city editor, "you can't say the word too
soon."</p>

<p>"Well," said Howe, "I don't know what's the matter with the
place, but you can consider the deal closed."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a sport!" The bearded man stood up. "You can draw
lots to determine who is to be managing editor and who city editor.
It's an excellent scheme&mdash;I attained my proud position that
way. One condition I attach. Ask no questions. Let us go out into
the night unburdened with your interrogation points."</p>

<p>Elliott, too, stood. The bearded man indicated the bottle. "Fill
up, boys. I propose a toast. To the new editors of the <i>Mail</i>.
May Heaven bless them and bring them safely back to the North when
Florida's fitful fever is past."</p>

<p>Dizzily, uncertainly, Howe and O'Neill drank. Mr. Mears reached
out a great red hand toward the bottle.</p>

<p>"Pardon me&mdash;private property," he said. He pocketed it. "We
bid you good-by and good luck. Think of us on the choo-choo,
please. Riding far&mdash;riding far."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;see here&mdash;" cried O'Neill.</p>

<p>"But me no buts," said Mears again. "Nary a question, I beg of
you. Take our jobs, and if you think of us at all, think of
gleaming rails and a speeding train. Once more&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>The door slammed. O'Neill looked at Howe.</p>

<p>"Fairies," he muttered, "or the D. T's. What is this&mdash;a
comic opera or a town? You are managing editor, Harry. I shall be
city editor. Is there a city to edit? No matter."</p>

<p>"No," said Howe. He reached for the greasy pack of cards. "We
draw for it. Come on. High wins."</p>

<p>"Jack," announced Mr. O'Neill.</p>

<p>"Deuce," smiled Howe. "What are your orders, sir?"</p>

<p>O'Neill passed one hand before his eyes.</p>

<p>"A steak," he muttered. "Well done. Mushroom sauce. French fried
potatoes. I've always dreamed of running a paper some day. Hurry up
with that steak."</p>

<p>"Forget your stomach," said Howe. "If a subordinate may make a
suggestion, we must get out a newspaper. Ah, whom have we
here?"</p>

<p>A stocky, red-faced man appeared from the inner room and stood
regarding them.</p>

<p>"Where's Mears and Elliott?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"On a train, riding far," said O'Neill. "I am the new managing
editor. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"You can give me four columns of copy for the last page of
to-morrow's <i>Mail</i>," said the stocky man calmly. "I'm foreman
of something in there we call a composing-room. Glad to meet
you."</p>

<p>"Four columns," mused O'Neill. "Four columns of what?"</p>

<p>The foreman pointed to a row of battered books on a shelf.</p>

<p>"It's been the custom," he said, "to fill up with stuff out of
that encyclopedia there."</p>

<p>"Thanks," O'Neill answered. He took down a book. "We'll fix you
up in ten minutes. Mr. Howe, will you please do me two columns
on&mdash;er&mdash;mulligatawny&mdash;murder&mdash;mushrooms. That's
it. On mushrooms. The life-story of the humble little mushroom. I
myself will dash off a column or so on the climate of Algeria."</p>

<p>The foreman withdrew, and Howe and O'Neill stood looking at each
other.</p>

<p>"Once," said O'Neill, "I ran an editorial page in Boston, where
you can always fill space by printing letters from citizens who
wish to rewrite Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and do it right. But
I never struck anything like this before."</p>

<p>"Me either," said Howe. "Mushrooms, did you say?"</p>

<p>They sat down before typewriters.</p>

<p>"One thing worries me," remarked O'Neill. "If we'd asked the
president of the First National Bank for jobs, do you suppose we'd
be in charge there now?"</p>

<p>"Write, man, write," said Howe. The clatter of their fingers on
the keys filled the room.</p>

<p>They looked up suddenly ten minutes later to find a man standing
between them. He was a little man, clad all in white, suit, shoes,
stockings. His sly old face was a lemon yellow, and his eyes
suggested lights flaming in the dark woods at night.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," said the little man.</p>

<p>"Ah, and what can we do for you?" inquired O'Neill.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Mr. Mears? Mr. Elliott?"</p>

<p>"Gone. Vamoosed. You are now speaking to the managing editor of
the <i>Mail</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah. Indeed?"</p>

<p>"We are very busy. If you'll just tell me what you
want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I merely dropped in. I am Manuel Gonzale, owner of the
<i>Mail</i>."</p>

<p>"Good lord!" cried O'Neill.</p>

<p>"Do not be disturbed. I take it you gentlemen have replaced
Mears and Elliott. I am glad. Let them go. You look like bright
young men to me&mdash;quite bright enough. I employ you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," stammered the managing editor.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it. Here is Madame On Dit's column for to-morrow.
It runs on the first page. As for the rest of the paper, suit
yourselves."</p>

<p>O'Neill took the copy, and glanced through it.</p>

<p>"Are there no libel laws down here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The material in that column," said the little man, his eyes
narrowing, "concerns only me. You must understand that at
once."</p>

<p>"The Madame writes hot stuff," ventured O'Neill.</p>

<p>"I am the Madame," said the owner of the <i>Mail</i> with
dignity.</p>

<p>He removed the copy from O'Neill's hand, and glided with it into
the other room. Scarcely had he disappeared when the door was
opened furiously and a panting man stood inside. Mr. Henry
Trimmer's keen eye surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>"Where's Mears&mdash;Elliott?" he cried.</p>

<p>"You're not the cashier, are you?" asked O'Neill with
interest.</p>

<p>"Don't try to be funny," roared Trimmer. "I'm looking for the
editor of this paper."</p>

<p>"Your search is ended," O'Neill replied. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"You mean you&mdash;Say! I've got a front-page story for
to-morrow's issue that will upset the town."</p>

<p>"Come to my arms," cried O'Neill. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"The real Lord Harrowby has been kidnaped."</p>

<p>O'Neill stared at him sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Have you been reading the Duchess again?" he asked. "Who the
hell is Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you don't know? Where have you been buried
alive?"</p>

<p>Out of the inner room glided Manuel Gonzale, and recognizing
him, Mr. Trimmer poured into his ear the story of George's
disappearance. Mr. Gonzale rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>"A good story," he said. "A very good story. Thank you, a
thousand times. I myself will write it."</p>

<p>With a scornful glance at the two strangers, Mr. Trimmer went
out, and Manuel Gonzale sat down at his desk. O'Neill and Howe
returned to their encyclopedic despatches.</p>

<p>"There you are," said Gonzale at last, standing. "Put an eight
column head on that, please, and run it on the front page. A very
fine story. The paper must go to press"&mdash;he looked at a
diamond studded watch&mdash;"in an hour. Only four pages. Please
see to the make-up. My circulation manager will assist you with the
distribution." At the door he paused. "It occurs to me that your
exchequer may be low. Seventy-five dollars a week for the managing
editor. Fifty for the city editor. Allow me&mdash;ten dollars each
in advance. If you need more, pray remind me."</p>

<p>Into their hands he put crinkling bills. And then, gliding still
like the fox he looked, he went out into the night.</p>

<p>"Sister," cried O'Neill weakly, "the fairies are abroad
to-night. I hear the rustle of their feet over the grass."</p>

<p>"Fairies," sneered Howe. "I could find another and a harsher
name for them."</p>

<p>"Don't," pleaded O'Neill. "Don't look a gift bill in the
treasury number. Don't try to penetrate behind the beyond. Say
nothing and let us eat. How are you coming with the mushroom
serial?"</p>

<p>An hour later they sent the paper to press, and sought the grill
room of the Hotel Alameda. As they came happily away from that
pleasant spot, O'Neill spied a fruit-stand. He stopped and made a
few purchases.</p>

<p>"Now," said Howe, "let us go over and meet the circulation
manager. Here&mdash;where are you going, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," O'Neill shouted back. "Come along, Harry. I'm
going over to the plaza! I'm going over to feed that
alligator!"</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">11. &mdash;TEARS FROM THE GAIETY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FRIDAY morning found Mr. Minot ready for whatever
diplomacy the day might demand of him. He had a feeling that the
demand would be great. The unheralded arrival of Miss Gabrielle
Rose and her packet of letters presented no slight complication.
Whatever the outcome of any suit she might start against Harrowby,
Minot was sure that the mere announcement of it would be sufficient
to blast Jephson's hopes for all time. Old Spencer Meyrick, already
inflamed by the episode of the elder brother, was not likely to
take coolly the publication of Harrowby's incriminating
letters.</p>

<p>After an early breakfast, Minot sent a cable to Jephson telling
of Miss Rose's arrival and asking for information about her. Next
he sought an interview with the Gaiety lady.</p>

<p>An hour later, in a pink and gold parlor of the Hotel de la Pax,
he stood gazing into the china-blue eyes of Miss Gabrielle Rose. It
goes without saying that Miss Rose was pretty; innocent she seemed,
too, with a baby stare that said as plainly as words: "Please don't
harm me, will you?" But&mdash;ah, well, Lord Harrowby was not the
first to learn that a business woman may lurk back of a baby
stare.</p>

<p>"You come from Lord Harrowby?" And the smile that had decorated
ten million postcards throughout the United Kingdom flashed on Mr.
Minot. "Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>"Thanks." Minot fidgeted. He had no idea what to say.
Time&mdash;it was time he must fight for, as he was fighting with
Trimmer. "Er&mdash;Miss Rose," he began, "when I started out on
this errand I had misgivings. But now that I have seen you, they
are gone. Everything will be all right, I know. I have come to ask
that you show Lord Harrowby some leniency."</p>

<p>The china-blue eyes hardened.</p>

<p>"You have come on a hopeless errand, Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Minot.
Why should I show Harrowby any consideration? Did he show me
any&mdash;when he broke his word to me and made me the
laughingstock of the town?"</p>

<p>"But that all happened five years ago&mdash;" "Yes, but it is as
vivid as though it were yesterday. I have always intended to demand
some redress from his lordship. But my art&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr.
Minot&mdash;you have no idea how exacting art can be. Not until now
have I been in a position to do so."</p>

<p>"And the fact that not until now has his lordship proposed to
marry some one else&mdash;that of course has nothing to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot!" A delightful pout. "If you knew me better you could
not possibly ask that."</p>

<p>"Miss Rose, you're a clever woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't. I hate clever women, and I'm sure you do,
too. I'm not a bit clever, and I'm proud of it. On the contrary,
I'm rather weak&mdash;rather easily got round. But when I think of
the position Allan put me in&mdash;even a weak woman can be firm in
the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Have it your own way," said Minot, bowing. "But you are at
least clever enough to understand the futility of demanding
financial redress from a man who is flat broke. I assure you Lord
Harrowby hasn't a shilling."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. He can get money somehow. He always could.
The courts can force him to. I shall tell my lawyer to go ahead
with the suit."</p>

<p>"If you would only delay&mdash;a week&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible." Miss Rose spoke with haughty languor. "I begin
rehearsals in New York in a week. No, I shall start suit to-day.
You may tell Lord Harrowby so."</p>

<p>Poor Jephson! Minot had a mental picture of the little bald man
writing at that very moment a terribly large check for the Dowager
Duchess of Tremayne&mdash;paying for the rain that had fallen in
torrents. He must at least hold this woman off until Jephson
answered his cable.</p>

<p>"Miss Rose," he pleaded, "grant us one favor. Do not make public
your suit against Harrowby until I have seen you again&mdash;say,
at four o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>Coldly she shook her head.</p>

<p>"But you have already waited five years. Surely you can wait
another five hours&mdash;as a very great favor to me."</p>

<p>"I should like to&mdash;since you put it that way&mdash;but it's
impossible. I'm sorry." The great beauty and business woman leaned
closer. "Mr. Minot, you can hardly realize what Allan's unkindness
cost me&mdash;in bitter tears. I loved him&mdash;once. And&mdash;I
believe he loved me."</p>

<p>"There can not be any question about that."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;flattery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;spoken from the heart."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"My dear lady&mdash;I should like to be your press agent. I
could write the most gorgeous things about you&mdash;and no one
could say I lied."</p>

<p>"You men are so nice," she gurgled, "when you want to be." Ah,
yes, Gabrielle Rose had always found them so, and had yet to meet
one not worth her while to capture. She turned the baby stare full
on Minot. Even to a beauty of the theater he was an ingratiating
picture. She rose and strolled to a piano in one corner of the
room. Minot followed.</p>

<p>"When Harrowby first met me," she said, her fingers on the keys,
"I was singing Just a Little. My first dear song&mdash;ah, Mr.
Minot, I was happy then."</p>

<p>In another minute she began to sing&mdash;softly&mdash;a
plaintive little love-song, and in spite of himself Minot felt his
heart beat faster.</p>

<p>"How it brings back the old days," she whispered. "The lights,
and the friendly faces&mdash;Harrowby in the stalls. And the
little suppers after the show&mdash;"</p>

<p>She leaned forward and sang at Minot as she had sung at Harrowby
five years before:</p>

<p>"You could love me just a little&mdash;if you tried&mdash;You
could feel your heart go pit-a-pat inside..."</p>

<p>Really, she had a way with her!</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Dear, it's easy if you try;<br>
Cross your heart and hope to die&mdash;<br>
Don't you love me just a little&mdash;now?"</p>
<br>

<p>That baby stare in all its pathos, all its appealing
helplessness, was focused full on Minot. He gripped the arms of his
chair. Gabrielle Rose saw. Had she made another captive? So it
seemed. She felt very kindly toward the world.</p>

<p>"Promise." Minot leaned over. His voice was hoarse. "You'll meet
me here at four. Quite aside from my errand&mdash;quite aside from
everything&mdash;I want to see you again."</p>

<p>"Do you really?" She continued to hum beneath her breath. "Very
well&mdash;here at four."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" he hesitated, fearing to break the spell. "In the
meantime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the meantime," she said, "I'll think only of&mdash;four
o'clock."</p>

<p>Minot left that pink and gold parlor at sea in several respects.
The theory was that he had played with this famous
actress&mdash;wound her round his finger&mdash;cajoled a delay. But
somehow he didn't feel exactly as one who has mastered a delicate
situation should. Instead he felt dazed by the beauty of her.</p>

<p>Still more was he at sea as to what he was going to do at four
o'clock. Of what good was the delay if he could not make use of it?
And at the moment he hadn't the slightest notion of what he could
do to prepare himself for the afternoon interview. He must wait for
Jephson's cable&mdash;perhaps that would give him an idea.</p>

<p>Minot was walking blankly down the street in the direction of
his morning paper when a poster in a deserted store window caught
his eye. It was an atrocious poster&mdash;red letters on a yellow
background. It announced that five hundred dollars reward would be
paid by Mr. Henry Trimmer for information that would disclose the
present whereabouts of the real Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>As Minot stood reading it, a heavy hand was laid upon his
shoulder. Turning, he looked into the lean and hostile face of
Henry Trimmer himself.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Mr. Trimmer.</p>

<p>"Good morning," replied Minot.</p>

<p>"Glad to number you among my readers," sneered Trimmer. "What do
you think&mdash;reward large enough?"</p>

<p>"Looks about the right size to me," Minot answered.</p>

<p>"Me, too. Ought to bring results pretty quick. By the way, you
were complaining last night that you never heard of me until you
came here. I've been thinking that over, and I've decided to make
up to you in the next few days for all those lonely
years&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the morning had been too much for Minot. Worried,
distressed, he lost for the moment his usual smiling urbanity.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil!" he said, and walked away.</p>

<p>Lunch time came&mdash;two o'clock. At half past two, out of
London, Jephson spoke. Said his cable:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"KNOW NOTHING OF G.R. EXCEPT THAT SHE'S BEEN
MARRIED FREQUENTLY. DO BEST YOU CAN."</p>
<br>

<p>And what help was this, pray? Disgustedly Minot read the cable
again. Four o'clock was coming on apace, and with every tick of the
clock his feeling of helplessness grew. He mentally berated Thacker
and Jephson. They left him alone to grapple with wild problems,
offering no help and asking miracles. Confound them both!</p>

<p>Three o'clock came. What&mdash;what was he to say? Lord
Harrowby, interrogated, was merely useless and frantic. He couldn't
raise a shilling. He couldn't offer a suggestion. "Dear old chap,"
he moaned, "I depend on you."</p>

<p>Three-thirty! Well, Thacker and Jephson had asked the
impossible, that was all. Minot felt he had done his best. No man
could do more. He was very sorry for Jephson, but&mdash;golden
before him opened the possibility of Miss Cynthia Meyrick free to
be wooed.</p>

<p>Yet he must be faithful to the last. At a quarter to four he
read Jephson's cablegram again. As he read, a plan ridiculous in
its ineffectiveness occurred to him. And since no other came in the
interval before four, he walked into Miss Rose's presence
determined to try out his weak little bluff.</p>

<p>The Gaiety lady was playing on the piano&mdash;a whispering,
seductive little tune. As Minot stepped to her side she glanced up
at him with a coy inviting smile. But she drew back a little at his
determined glare.</p>

<p>"Miss Rose," he said sharply, "I have discovered that you can
not sue Lord Harrowby for breach of contract to marry you."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why not?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"Because," said Minot, with a triumphant smile&mdash;though it
was a shot in the dark&mdash;"you already had a husband when those
letters were written to you."</p>

<p>Well, he had done his best. A rather childish effort, but what
else was there to attempt? Poor old Jephson!</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the Gaiety lady, and continued to play.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," Minot replied. "Why, I can produce the
man himself."</p>

<p>Might as well go the limit while he was about it. That should be
his consolation when Jephson lost. Might as well&mdash;but what was
this?</p>

<p>Gabrielle Rose had turned livid with anger. Her lips twitched,
her china-blue eyes flashed fire. If only her lawyer had been by
her side then! But he wasn't. And so she cried hotly:</p>

<p>"He's told! The little brute's told!"</p>

<p>Good lord! Minot felt his knees weaken. A shot in the
dark&mdash;had it hit the target after all?</p>

<p>"If you refer to your husband," said Minot, "he has done just
that."</p>

<p>"He's not my husband," she snapped.</p>

<p>Oh, what was the use? Providence was with Jephson.</p>

<p>"No, of course not&mdash;not since the divorce," Minot answered.
"But he was when those letters were written."</p>

<p>The Gaiety lady's chin began to tremble.</p>

<p>"And he promised me, on his word of honor, that he wouldn't
tell. But I suppose you found him easy. What honor could one expect
in a Persian carpet dealer?"</p>

<p>A Persian carpet dealer? Into Minot's mind floated a scrap of
conversation heard at Mrs. Bruce's table.</p>

<p>"But you must remember," he ventured, "that he is also a
prince."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the woman, "that's what I thought when I married
him. He's the prince of liars&mdash;that's as far as his royal
blood goes."</p>

<p>A silence, while Miss Gabrielle Rose felt in her sleeve for her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Minot suggested, "you will abandon the
suit&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at him. Oh, the pathos of that baby stare!</p>

<p>"You are acting in this matter simply as Harrowby's friend?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Simply as his friend."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;so far&mdash;only you know of
my&mdash;er&mdash;ex-husband?"</p>

<p>"Only I know of him," smiled Minot. The smile died from his
face. For he saw bright tears on the long lashes of the Gaiety
lady. She leaned close.</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot," she said, "it is I who need a friend. Not Harrowby.
I am here in a strange country&mdash;without funds&mdash;alone.
Helpless. Mr. Minot. You could not be so cruel."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm sorry," said Minot uncomfortably.</p>

<p>The lady was an actress, and she acted now, beautifully.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I feel so desolate," she moaned, dabbing daintily at
her eyes. "You will help me. It can not be I am mistaken in you. I
thought&mdash;did I imagine it&mdash;this morning when I sang for
you&mdash;you liked me&mdash;just a little?"</p>

<p>Nervously Minot rose from his chair and stood looking down at
her. He tried to answer, but his voice seemed lost.</p>

<p>"Just a very little?" She, too, rose and placed her butterfly
hands on his shoulders. "You do like me&mdash;just a little, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Her pleading eyes gazed into his. It was a touching scene. To be
besought thus tenderly by a famous beauty in the secluded parlor of
a southern hotel! The touch of her hands on his shoulders thrilled
him. The odor of Jockey Club&mdash;</p>

<p>It was at this instant that Mr. Minot, looking past the Gaiety
lady's beautiful golden coiffure, beheld Miss Cynthia Meyrick
standing in the doorway of that parlor, a smile on her face. She
disappeared on the instant, but Gabrielle Rose's "big scene" was
ruined beyond repair.</p>

<p>"My dear lady"&mdash;gently Minot slipped from beneath her
lovely hands&mdash;"I assure you I do like you&mdash;more than a
little. But unfortunately my loyalty to Harrowby&mdash;no, I won't
say that&mdash;circumstances are such that I can not be your friend
in this instance. Though, if I could serve you in any other
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gabrielle Rose snapped her fingers.</p>

<p>"Very well." Her voice had a metallic ring now. "We shall see
what we shall see."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. I bid you good day."</p>

<p>As Minot, somewhat dazed, walked along the veranda of the De la
Pax he met Miss Meyrick. There was a mischievous gleam in her
eye.</p>

<p>"Really, it was so tactless of me, Mr. Minot," she said. "A
thousand apologies."</p>

<p>He pretended not to understand.</p>

<p>"My untimely descent on the parlor." She beamed on him. "I
presume it happened because romance draws me&mdash;like a magnet.
Even other people's."</p>

<p>Minot smiled wanly, and for once sought to end their talk.</p>

<p>"Oh, do sit down just a moment," she pleaded. "I want to thank
you for the great service you did Harrowby and me&mdash;last
night."</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what service?" asked Minot, sinking into a chair.</p>

<p>She leaned close, and spoke in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Your part in the kidnaping. Harrowby has told me. It was sweet
of you&mdash;so unselfish."</p>

<p>"Damn!" thought Minot. And then he thought two more.</p>

<p>"To put yourself out that our wedding may be a success!" Was
this sarcasm, Minot wondered. "I'm so glad to know about it, Mr.
Minot. It shows me at last&mdash;just what you think is"&mdash;she
looked away&mdash;"best for me."</p>

<p>"Best for you? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Can't you understand? From some things you've said I have
thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you didn't just approve of
my&mdash;marriage. And now I see I misconstrued you&mdash;utterly.
You want me to marry Harrowby. You're working for it. I shouldn't
be surprised if you were on that train last Monday just to make
sure that&mdash;I'd&mdash;get here&mdash;safely."</p>

<p>Really, it was inhuman. Did she realize how inhuman it was? One
glance at Minot might have told her. But she was still looking
away.</p>

<p>"So I want to thank you, Mr. Minot," she went on. "I shall
always remember your&mdash;kindness. I couldn't understand at
first, but now&mdash;I wonder? You know, it's an old theory that as
soon as one has one's own affair of the heart arranged, one begins
to plan for others?"</p>

<p>Minot made a little whistling sound through his clenched teeth.
The girl stood up.</p>

<p>"Your thoughtfulness has made me very happy," she laughed. "It
shows that perhaps you care for me&mdash;just a
little&mdash;too."</p>

<p>She was gone! Minot sat swearing softly to himself, banging the
arm of his chair with his fist. He raged at Thacker, Jephson, the
solar system. Gradually his anger cooled. Underneath the raillery
in Cynthia Meyrick's tone he had thought he detected something of a
serious note&mdash;as though she were a little wistful&mdash;a
little hurt.</p>

<p>Did she care? Bitter-sweet thought! In the midst of all this
farce and melodrama, had she come to care?&mdash;just a
little?&mdash;</p>

<p>Just a little! Bah!</p>

<p>Minot rose and went out on the avenue.</p>

<p>Prince Navin Bey Imno was accustomed to give lectures twice
daily on the textures of his precious rugs, at his shop in the
Alameda courtyard. His afternoon lecture was just finished as Mr.
Minot stepped into the shop. A dozen awed housewives from the
Middle West were hurrying away to write home on the hotel
stationery that they had met a prince. When the last one had gone
out Minot stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Prince&mdash;I've dropped in to warn you. A very angry woman
will be here shortly to see you."</p>

<p>The handsome young Persian shrugged his shoulders, and took off
the jacket of the native uniform with which he embellished his
talks.</p>

<p>"Why is she angry? All my rugs&mdash;they are what I say they
are. In this town are many liars selling oriental rugs. Oriental!
Ugh! In New Jersey they were made. But not my rugs. See! Only in my
native country, where I was a prince of the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. But this, lady is not coming about rugs. I refer to
your ex-wife."</p>

<p>"Ah. You are mistaken. I have never married."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have. I know all about it. There's no need to lie.
The whole story is out, and the lady's game in San Marco is
queered. She thinks you told. That's why she'll be here for a
chat."</p>

<p>"But I did not tell. Only this morning did I see her first. I
could not tell&mdash;so soon. Who could I tell&mdash;so soon?"</p>

<p>"I know you didn't tell. But can you prove it to an agitated
lady? No. You'd better close up for the evening."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;you are right. I am innocent&mdash;but what does
Gabrielle care for innocence? We are no longer married&mdash;still
I should not want to meet her now. I will close. But first&mdash;my
friend&mdash;my benefactor&mdash;could I interest you in this rug?
See! Only in my native country, where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prince," said Minot, "I couldn't use a rug if you gave me
one."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I would do. You are my friend. You serve
me. I give you this. Fifty dollars. That is giving it to you. Note
the weave. Only in my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night," interrupted Minot. "And take my advice.
Hurry!"</p>

<p>Gloomy, discouraged, he turned back toward his own hotel. It was
true, Gabrielle Rose's husband at the time of the letters was in
San Marco. The emissary of Jephson was serving a cause that could
not lose. That afternoon he had hoped. Was there anything
dishonorable in that? Jephson and Thacker could command his
service, they could not command his heart. He had hoped&mdash;and
now&mdash;</p>

<p>At a corner a black man gave him a hand-bill. He read:</p>
<br>

<p class="cp">WHO HAS KIDNAPED<br>
THE REAL<br>
LORD HARROWBY?<br>
AT THE OPERA-HOUSE TO-NIGHT!!<br>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Henry Trimmer Will Appear in<br>
Place Of His Unfortunate Friend, Lord<br>
Harrowby, And Will Make A Few</span><br>
WARM AND SIZZLING<br>
REMARKS.<br>
NO ADVANCE IN PRICES.</p>
<br>

<p>Mr. Minot tossed the bill into the street. Into his eyes came
the ghostlike semblance of a smile. After all, the famous Harrowby
wedding had not yet taken place.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">12. &mdash;EXIT A LADY, LAUGHINGLY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER dinner Minot lighted a cigar and descended
into the hotel gardens for a stroll. Farther and farther he strayed
down the shadowy gravel paths, until only the faint far suggestion
of music at his back recalled the hotel's lights and gaiety. It was
a deserted land he penetrated; just one figure did he encounter in
a fifteen minutes' walk&mdash;a little man clad all in white
scurrying like a wraith in the black shade of the royal palms.</p>

<p>At a distant corner of the grounds near the tennis-courts was a
summer-house in which tea was served of an afternoon. Into this
Minot strolled, to finish his cigar and ponder the day's
developments in the drama he was playing. As he drew a comfortable
chair from moonlight into shadow he heard a little gasp at his
elbow, and turning, beheld a beautiful vision.</p>

<p>Gabrielle Rose was made for the spotlight, and that being
absent, moonlight served as well. Under its soft merciful rays she
stood revealed&mdash;the beauty thousands of playgoers knew and
worshiped. Dick Minot gazed at her in awe. He was surprised that
she held out her hand to him, a smile of the utmost friendliness on
her face.</p>

<p>"How fortunate," she said, as though -speaking the cue for a
lovely song. "I stand here, the wonder of this old Spanish night
getting into my very, blood&mdash;and the only thing lacking in the
picture is&mdash;a man. And then, you come."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to be of service," said Minot, tossing away his
cigar.</p>

<p>"What an unromantic way to put it! Really, this chance
meeting&mdash;it was a chance meeting, I suppose?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lucky chance," he agreed.</p>

<p>She pouted.</p>

<p>"Then you did not follow? Unromantic to the last! But as I was
saying, this chance meeting is splendid. My train goes in an
hour&mdash;and I wanted so very much to see you&mdash;once
again."</p>

<p>"You flatter me."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you don't understand." She dropped into a chair. "I
wanted to see you&mdash;to put your conscience at rest. You were so
sorry when you had to be&mdash;cruel&mdash;to me to-day. You will
be so glad to know that it has all turned out happily, after
all."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Minot, new apprehensions rising in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Alas, if I could only tell you." She was laughing at him
now&mdash;an experience he did not relish. "But&mdash;my lips are
sealed, as we say on the stage. I can only give you the hint. You
thought you left me a broken vanquished woman. How the thought did
pain you! Well, your victory was not absolute. Let that thought
console you."</p>

<p>"You are too kind," Minot answered.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you are glad I am not leaving San Marco quite
beaten?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I'm wild with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;that is sweet of you. I am so sorry we must part.
The moonlight, the palms, the distant music&mdash;all so romantic.
But&mdash;we shall meet again?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Don't know? How unkind&mdash;when it all depends on you. You
will look me up in New York, won't you? New York is not so romantic
&mdash;but I shall try to make it up to you. I shall sing for you.
Just a Little."</p>

<p>She stood up, and held out a slim white hand.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Minot." Still she laughed. "It has been so good to
know you."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;good-by," said Minot. He took the hand. He heard her
humming beneath her breath&mdash;humming Just a Little. "I've
enjoyed your singing immensely."</p>

<p>She laughed outright now&mdash;a silvery joyous laugh. And,
refusing the baffled Minot's offer to take her back to the hotel,
she fled away from him down the dark path.</p>

<p>He fell back into his chair, and lighted another cigar. Exit the
Gaiety lady, laughing merrily. What was the meaning of that? What
new complication must he meet and solve?</p>

<p>For his answer, he had only to return to the hotel. On the steps
he was met by Lord Harrowby's man, agitated, puffing.</p>

<p>"Been looking all about for you, sir," he announced. "'Is
lordship wishes to see you at once&mdash;most h'important."</p>

<p>"More trouble, Minot," was Lord Harrowby's gloomy greeting. "Sit
down, old chap. Just had a very nasty visitor."</p>

<p>"Sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>"Little brown monkey of a man&mdash;Manuel Gonzale, proprietor
of the <i>San Marco Mail</i>. I say, old boy, there's a syllable
missing in the name of that paper. Do you get me?"</p>

<p>"You mean it should be the San Marco Blackmail? Pretty good,
Harrowby, pretty good." And Minot added to himself "for you."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I do mean. Gabrielle has sold out her bunch
of letters to Mr. Gonzale. And it appears from the chap's sly hints
that unless I pay him ten thousand dollars before midnight, the
best of those letters will be in tomorrow's <i>Mail</i>."</p>

<p>"He's got his nerve&mdash;working a game like that," said
Minot.</p>

<p>"Nerve&mdash;not at all," replied Harrowby. "He's as safe as a
child in its own nursery. He knows as well as anybody that the last
thing I'd do would be to appeal to the police. Too much publicity
down that road. Well?"</p>

<p>"His price is a bit cheaper than Gabrielle's."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not cheap enough. I'm broke, old boy. The governor and
I are on very poor terms. Shouldn't think of appealing to him."</p>

<p>"We might pawn Chain Lightning's Collar," Minot suggested.</p>

<p>"Never! There must be some way&mdash;only three days before the
wedding. We mustn't lose on the stretch, old boy." A pause. Minot
sat glumly.</p>

<p>"Have you no suggestion?" Harrowby asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I have not," said Minot, rising. "But I perceive clearly that
it now devolves on little Dicky Minot to up and don his fighting
armor once more."</p>

<p>"Really, old boy, I'm sorry," said Harrowby. "I'm hoping things
may quiet down a bit after a time."</p>

<p>"So am I," replied Minot with feeling. "If they don't I can see
nervous prostration and a hospital cot ahead for me. You stay here
and study the marriage service&mdash;I'm going out on the broad
highway again."</p>

<p>He went down into the lobby and tore Jack Paddock away from the
side of one of the Omaha beauties. Mr. Paddock was resplendent in
evening clothes, and thoughtful, for on the morrow Mrs. Bruce was
to give an important luncheon.</p>

<p>"Jack," Minot said, "I'm going to confide in you. I'm going to
tell you why I am in San Marco."</p>

<p>"Unbare your secrets," Paddock answered.</p>

<p>Crossing the quiet plaza Minot explained to his friend the
matter of the insurance policy written by the romantic Jephson in
New York. He told of how he had come south with the promise to his
employer that Miss Cynthia Meyrick would change her mind only over
his dead body. Incredulous exclamations broke from the flippant
Paddock as he listened.</p>

<p>"Knowing your love of humor," Minot said, "I hasten to add the
crowning touch. The moment I saw Cynthia Meyrick I realized that if
I couldn't marry her myself life would be an uninteresting blank
forever after. Every time I've seen her since I've been surer of
it. What's the answer, Jack?"</p>

<p>Paddock whistled.</p>

<p>"Delicious," he cried. "Pardon me&mdash;I'm speaking as a rank
outsider. She is a charming girl. And you adore her! Bless my soul,
how the plot does thicken! Why don't you resign, you idiot?"</p>

<p>"My first idea. Tried it, and it wouldn't work. Besides, if I
did resign, I couldn't stick around and queer Jephson's
chances&mdash;even supposing she'd listen to my pleading, which she
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Children, see the very Christian martyr! If it was me I'd chuck
the job and elope with&mdash;oh, no, you couldn't do that, of
course. It would be a low trick. You are in a hole, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Five million fathoms deep. There's nothing to do but see the
wedding through. And you're going to help me. Just now, Mr. Manuel
Gonzale has a packet of love-letters written by Harrowby in his
salad days, which he proposes to print on the morrow unless he is
paid not to tonight. You and I are on our way to take 'em away from
him."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;but if I help you in this I'll be doing you a mean
trick. Can't quite make out, old boy, whether to stand by you in a
business or a personal way."</p>

<p>"You're going to stand by me in a business way. I want you along
to-night to lend your moral support while I throttle that little
blackmailer."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir. I've been hearing some things about Gonzale
myself. Go to it!"</p>

<p>They groped about in a dark hallway hunting the <i>Mail</i>
office.</p>

<p>"Shady are the ways of journalism," commented Paddock. "By the
way, I've just thought of one for Mrs. Bruce to spring to-morrow.
In case we fail and the affinity letters are published, she might
say that Harrowby's epistles got into the <i>Mail</i> once too
often. It's only a rough idea&mdash;ah&mdash;I see you don't like
it. Well, here's success to our expedition."</p>

<p>They opened the door of the <i>Mail</i> office. Mr. O'Neill sat
behind a desk, the encyclopedia before him, seeking lively material
for the morrow's issue. Mr. Howe hammered at a typewriter. Both of
the newspaper men looked up at the intrusion.</p>

<p>"Ah, gentlemen," said O'Neill, coming forward. "What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Minot asked.</p>

<p>"What? Can it be? Is my name not a household word in San Marco?
I am managing editor of the <i>Mail</i>." His eyes lighted on Mr.
Paddock's giddy attire. "We can't possibly let you give a ball here
to-night, if that's what you want."</p>

<p>"Very humorous," said Minot. "But our wants are far different. I
won't beat around the bush. You have some letters here written by a
friend of mine to a lady he adored&mdash;at the moment. You are
going to print them in tomorrow's <i>Mail</i> unless my friend is
easy enough to pay you ten thousand dollars. He isn't going to pay
you anything. We've come for those letters&mdash;and we'll get them
or run you and your boss out of town in twenty-four hours&mdash;you
raw little blackmailers!"</p>

<p>"Blackmailers!" Mr. O'Neill's eyes seemed to catch fire from his
hair. His face paled. "I've been in the newspaper business
seventeen years, and nobody ever called me a blackmailer and got
away with it. I'm in a generous mood. I'll give you one chance to
take that back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. It happens to be true&mdash;" put in Paddock.</p>

<p>"I'm talking to your friend here." O'Neill's breath came fast.
"I'll attend to you, you lily of the field, in a minute.
You&mdash;you liar&mdash;are you going to take that back?"</p>

<p>"No," cried Minot.</p>

<p>He saw a wild Irishman coming for him, breathing fire. He
squared himself to meet the attack. But the man at the typewriter
leaped up and seized O'Neill from behind.</p>

<p>"Steady, Bob," he shouted. "How do you know this fellow isn't
right?"</p>

<p>Unaccountably the warlike one collapsed into a chair.</p>

<p>"Damn it, I know he's right," he groaned. "That's what makes me
rave. Why didn't you let me punch him? It would have been some
satisfaction. Of course he's right. I had a hunch this was a
blackmailing sheet from the moment my hot fingers closed on
Gonzale's money. But so long as nobody told us, we were all
right."</p>

<p>He glared angrily at Minot.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you killjoy," he cried. "You skeleton at the feast.
You've put us in a lovely fix."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry," said Minot, "but I don't understand these
heroics."</p>

<p>"It's all up now, Harry," moaned O'Neill. "The free trial is
over and we've got to send the mattress back to the factory. Here
in this hollow lotus land, ever to live and lie reclined&mdash;I
was putting welcome on the mat for a fate like that. Back to the
road for us. That human fish over in the <i>Chronicle</i> office
was a prophet&mdash;'You look unlucky&mdash;maybe they'll give you
jobs on the <i>Mail</i>.' Remember."</p>

<p>"Cool off, Bob," Howe said. He turned to Minot and Paddock. "Of
course you don't understand. You see, we're strangers here. Drifted
in last night broke and hungry, looking for jobs. We got
them&mdash;under rather unusual circumstances. Things looked
suspicious&mdash;the proprietor parted with money without screaming
for help, and no regular newspaper is run like that. But
&mdash;when you're down and out, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," said Minot, smiling. "And I'm sorry I called you
what I did. I apologize. And I hate to be a&mdash;er&mdash;a
killjoy. But as a matter of fact, your employer is a blackmailer,
and it's best you should know it."</p>

<p>"Yes," put in Paddock. "Do you gentlemen happen to have heard
where the editor of Mr. Gonzale's late newspaper, published in
Havana, is now?"</p>

<p>"We do not," said O'Neill, "but maybe you'll tell us."</p>

<p>"I will. He's in prison, doing ten years for blackmail. I
understand that Mr. Gonzale prefers to involve his editors, rather
than himself."</p>

<p>O'Neill came over and held out his hand to Minot.</p>

<p>"Shake, son," he said. "Thank God I didn't waste my strength on
you. Gonzale will be in here in a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About those letters?" Howe inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Minot. "They were written to a Gaiety actress by a
man who is in San Marco for his wedding next Tuesday&mdash;Lord
Harrowby."</p>

<p>"His ludship again," O'Neill remarked. "Say, I always thought
the South was democratic."</p>

<p>"Well," said Howe, "we owe you fellows something for putting us
wise. We've stood for a good deal, but never for blackmailing. As a
matter of fact, Gonzale hasn't brought the letters in yet, but he's
due at any minute. When he comes&mdash;take the letters away from
him. I shan't interfere. How about you, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I'll interfere," said O'Neill, "and I'll interfere strong
&mdash;if I think you fellows ain't leaving enough of little Manuel
for me to caress&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened, and the immaculate proprietor of the
<i>Mail</i> came noiselessly into the room. His eyes narrowed when
they fell on the strangers there.</p>

<p>"Are you Manuel Gonzale?" Minot demanded.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am." The sly little eyes darted everywhere.</p>

<p>"Proprietor of the <i>Mail</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The gentleman who visited Lord Harrowby an hour back?"</p>

<p>"Man! Man! You're wasting time," O'Neill cried.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," smiled Minot. "Unintentional, I assure you." He
seized the little Spaniard suddenly by the collar. "We're here for
Lord Harrowby's letters," he said. His other hand began a rapid
search of Manuel Gonzale's pockets.</p>

<p>"Let me go, you thief," screamed the proprietor of the
<i>Mail</i>. He squirmed and fought. "Let me go!" He writhed about
to face his editors. "You fools! What are you doing, standing
there? Help me&mdash;help&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're waiting," said O'Neill. "Waiting for our turn. Remember
your promise, son. Enough of him left for me."</p>

<p>Minot and his captive slid back and forth across the floor. The
three others watched, O'Neill in high glee.</p>

<p>"Go to it!" he cried. &bull; "That's Madame On Dit you're
waltzing with. I speak for the next dance, Madame."</p>

<p>Mr. Minot's eager hand came away from the Spaniard's inner
waistcoat pocket, and in it was a packet of perfumed letters, tied
with a cute blue ribbon. He released his victim.</p>

<p>"Sorry to be so impolite," he said. "But I had to have these
to-night."</p>

<p>Gonzale turned on him with an evil glare.</p>

<p>"Thief!" he cried. "I'll have the law on you for this."</p>

<p>"I doubt that," smiled Minot. "Jack, I guess that about
concludes our business with the <i>Mail</i>." He turned to Howe and
O'Neill. "You boys look me up at the De la Pax. I want to wish you
bon voyage when you start north. For the
present&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>And he and Paddock departed.</p>

<p>"You're a fine pair," snarled Gonzale, when the door had closed.
"A fine pair to take my salary money, and then stand by and see me
strangled."</p>

<p>"You're not strangled yet," said O'Neill. He came slowly toward
his employer, like a cat stalking a bird. "Did you get my emphasis
on the word yet?"</p>

<p>Gonzale paled beneath his lemon skin, and got behind a desk.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," he pleaded, "I didn't mean anything. I'll be frank
with you&mdash;I have been a little indiscreet here. But that's all
over now. It would be dangerous to try any
more&mdash;er&mdash;deals at present. And I want you to stay on
here until I can get new men in your places."</p>

<p>"Save your breath," said O'Neill through his teeth.</p>

<p>"Your work has been excellent&mdash;excellent," went on Gonzale
hastily. "I feel I am not paying you enough. Stay on with me until
your week is up. I will give you a hundred each when you
go&mdash;and I give you my word I'll attempt nothing dangerous
while you are here."</p>

<p>He retreated farther from O'Neill.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Bob," said Howe. "No blackmailing stunts while
we stay?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I shouldn't call them that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No blackmailing stunts?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I promise."</p>

<p>"Harry," wailed the militant O'Neill. "What's the matter with
you? We ought to thrash him&mdash;now&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go back on the road?" Howe inquired. "A hundred dollars each,
Bob. It means New York in a parlor car."</p>

<p>"Then you will stay?" cried Gonzale.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;we'll stay," said Howe firmly.</p>

<p>"See here&mdash;" pleaded O'Neill. "Oh, what's the use? This
dolce far niente has got us."</p>

<p>"We stay only on the terms you name," stipulated Howe.</p>

<p>"It is agreed," said Gonzale, smiling wanly. "The loss of those
letters cost me a thousand dollars&mdash;and you stood by. However,
let us forgive and forget. Here&mdash;Madame On Dit's copy for
to-morrow." Timidly he held out a roll of paper toward O'Neill.</p>

<p>"All right." O'Neill snatched it. "But I'm going to edit it from
now on. For instance, there's a comma I don't like. And I'm going
to keep an eye on you, my hearty."</p>

<p>"As you wish," said Gonzale humbly. "I&mdash;I am going out for
a moment." The door closed noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>Howe and O'Neill stood looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you had your way," said O'Neill, shamefacedly. "I
don't seem to be the man I was. It must be the sunshine and the
posies. And the thought of the road again."</p>

<p>"A hundred each," said Howe grimly. "We had to have it, Bob. It
means New York."</p>

<p>"Yes." O'Neill pondered. "But&mdash;that good-looking young
fellow, Harry&mdash;the one who apologized to us for calling us
blackmailers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I'd hate to meet him on the street to-morrow. Five days. A lot
could happen in five days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are your orders, Chief?" asked Howe.</p>

<p>At that moment Minot, followed by Paddock was rushing
triumphantly into the Harrowby suite. He threw down on the table a
package of letters.</p>

<p>"There they are!" he cried. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lord Harrowby wildly.</p>

<p>"Thanks a thousand times. My dear Minot&mdash;we need you. My
man has been to the theater&mdash;Trimmer is organizing a mob to
board the <i>Lileth</i>!"</p>

<p>"Board the <i>Lileth</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to search for that creature who calls himself Lord
Harrowby."</p>

<p>"Come on, Jack," Minot said to Paddock. They ran down several
flights of stairs, through the lobby, and out into the street.</p>

<p>"Where to?" panted Paddock.</p>

<p>"The harbor!" Minot cried.</p>

<p>As they passed the opera-house they saw a crowd forming and
heard the buzz of many voices.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">13. &mdash;AND ON THE SHIPS AT SEA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MR. PADDOCK knew of a man on the water-front who
had a gasoline launch to rent, and fortunately it happened to be in
commission. The two young men leaped into it, Paddock started the
engine, and they zipped with reassuring speed over the dark waters
toward the lights of the <i>Lileth</i>.</p>

<p>The accommodation ladder of the yacht was down, and leaving a
member of the crew to make fast the launch, Minot and Paddock
climbed hurriedly to the deck. Mr. Martin Wall was at the moment in
the main cabin engaged in a game of German whist, and his opponent
was no less a person than George Harrowby of the peerage. Upon this
quiet game the two young men rushed in.</p>

<p>"Unexpected visitors," said Wall. "Why&mdash;what's the matter,
boys?"</p>

<p>"Come out on deck a minute," said Minot rapidly. Wall threw down
his cards and followed. Once outside, Minot went on: "No time to
waste words. Trimmer is collecting a mob in front of the
opera-house, and they are coming out here to search this boat. You
know who they're looking for."</p>

<p>With exaggerated calmness Wall took out a cigar and lighted
it.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" he remarked. "I told you it might be advisable to look
up the penalty for kidnaping. But you knew best. Ah, the
impetuosity of youth!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;this is no time to discuss that," replied Minot.
"We've got to act, and act quickly!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Mr. Wall drawled. "What would you suggest? Shall we drown
him? I've come to like George mighty well, but if you say the
word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My plan is this," said Minot, annoyed by Wall's pleasantries.
"Turn George over to us. We'll bundle him into our launch and run
off out of sight behind Tarragona Island. Then, let Trimmer search
to his heart's content. When he gets tired and quits, signal us by
hanging a red lantern in the bow."</p>

<p>Martin Wall smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"Not bad for an amateur kidnaper," he said. "Will I turn George
over to you? Will a duck swim? A good idea."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, hurry!" cried Minot. "Look!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the largest of San Marco's piers. The moon was
lost under clouds now, but the electric lights on the water-front
revealed a swarming shouting crowd of people. Martin Wall stepped
to the door of the main cabin.</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby!" he cried. He turned to Minot and Paddock. "I
call him that to cheer him in captivity," he explained. The tall
weary Englishman strode out upon the deck.</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby," said Wall, "these two gentlemen have come to
take you for a boat ride. Will you be kind enough to step into that
launch?"</p>

<p>Poor old George pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"If you'll pardon my language, I'll be damned if I do," he said.
"I take it Mr. Trimmer is on his way here. Well, gentlemen, the
first to grasp his hand when he boards the boat will be the chap
who now addresses you."</p>

<p>They stood gazing doubtfully at George in revolt. Then Minot
turned, and saw a rowboat putting off from the pier.</p>

<p>"Come on," he cried, and leaped on the shoulders of the aspirant
to the title. Paddock and Wall followed. Despite his discouraged
appearance, George put up a lively fight. For a time the four men
struggled back and forth across the deck, now in moonlight, now in
shadow. Once George slipped and fell, his three captors on top of
him, and at that moment Mr. Minot felt a terrific tugging at his
coat. But the odds were three to one against George Harrowby, and
finally he was dragged and pushed into the launch. Again Paddock
started the engine, and that odd boat load drew away from the
<i>Lileth</i>.</p>

<p>They had gone about ten feet when poor old George slipped out
from under Minot and leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;Trimmer&mdash;it's me&mdash;it's George&mdash;" he
thundered in a startlingly loud tone. Minot put his hand over
George's lips, and they locked in conflict. The small launch danced
wildly on the waters. And fortunately for Minot's plans the moon
still hid behind the clouds.</p>

<p>With a stretch of Tarragona's rank vegetation between them and
the <i>Lileth</i>, Mr. Paddock stopped the engine and they stood
still on the dark waters. Paddock lighted a cigarette, utilizing
the same match to consult his watch.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock," he said. "Can't say this is the jolliest little
party I was ever on."</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Minot cheerfully. "It won't take Trimmer
fifteen minutes to find that his proposition isn't on board. In
twenty minutes we'll slip back and look for the signal."</p>

<p>The "proposition" in question sat up and straightened his
collar.</p>

<p>"The pater and I split," he said, "over the matter of my going
to Oxford. The old boy knew best. I wish now I'd gone. Then I might
have words to tell you chaps what I think of this damnable
outrage."</p>

<p>Minot and Paddock sat in silence.</p>

<p>"I've been in America twenty odd years," the proposition went
on. "Seen all sorts of injustice and wrong&mdash;but I've lived to
experience the climax myself."</p>

<p>Still silence from his captors, while the black waters swished
about the launch.</p>

<p>"I take it you chaps believe me to be an impostor, just as Allan
does. Well, I'm not. And I'm going to give you my little talk on
the old days at Rakedale Hall. When I've finished&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you're not," said Minot. "I've heard all that once."</p>

<p>"And you weren't convinced? Why, everybody in San Marco is
convinced. The mayor, the chief of police, the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear George," said Minot with feeling. "It doesn't make the
slightest difference who you are. You and Trimmer stay separated
until after next Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Yes. And rank injustice it is, too. We'll have the law on you
for this. We'll send you all to prison."</p>

<p>"Pleasant thought," commented Paddock. "Mrs. Bruce would have to
develop lockjaw at the height of the social season. Oh, the
devil&mdash;I'd better be thinking about that luncheon."</p>

<p>All thought. All sat there silent. The black waters became a
little rougher. On their surface small flecks of white began to
appear. Minot looked up at the dark sky.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two after," said Paddock finally, and turned toward the
engine. "Heaven grant that red light is on view. This is getting on
my nerves."</p>

<p>Slyly the little launch poked its nose around the corner of the
island and peeped at the majestic <i>Lileth</i>. Paddock
snorted.</p>

<p>"Not a trace of it."</p>

<p>"I must have underestimated the time," said Minot.
"Wha&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>"That? That's only thunder. Oh, this is going to be a pretty
party!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the heavens blazed with lightning. The swell of the
waters increased. Hastily Paddock backed the boat from the range of
the <i>Lileth</i>'s vision.</p>

<p>"Trimmer must go soon," cried Minot.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed in eloquent silence. The lightning and
the thunder continued.</p>

<p>"Try it again," Minot suggested. Again they peeped. And still no
red light on the <i>Lileth</i>.</p>

<p>And even as they looked, out of the black heavens swept a sheet
of stinging rain. It lashed down on that frail tossing boat with
cruel force; it obscured the <i>Lileth</i>, the island, everything
but the fact of its own damp existence. In two seconds the men
unprotected in that tiny launch were pitiful dripping figures, and
the glory of Mr. Paddock's evening clothes departed never to
return.</p>

<p>"A fortune-teller in Albuquerque," said poor old George, "told
me I was to die of pneumonia. It'll be murder,
gentlemen&mdash;plain murder."</p>

<p>"It's suicide, too, isn't it?" snarled Paddock. "That ought to
satisfy you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Minot through chattering teeth.</p>

<p>No answer. The downfall continued.</p>

<p>"The rain is raining everywhere," quoted Paddock gloomily. "It
falls on the umbrellas here, and on the ships at sea. Damn the
ships at sea."</p>

<p>"Here, here," said poor old George.</p>

<p>A damp doleful pause.</p>

<p>"Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life
for a friend," continued Paddock presently.</p>

<p>"A thousand apologies," Minot said. "But I'm running the same
chances, Jack."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but it's your party&mdash;your happy little party,"
replied Paddock. "Not mine."</p>

<p>Minot did not answer. He was as miserable as the others, and he
could scarcely blame his friend for losing temporarily his good
nature.</p>

<p>"It's after eleven," said Paddock, after another long pause.</p>

<p>"Put in closer to the <i>Lileth</i>," suggested Minot.</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock fumbled about beneath the canvas cover of the
engine, and they put in. But still no red light aboard the
yacht.</p>

<p>"I'd give a thousand dollars," said Paddock, "to know what's
going on aboard that boat."</p>

<p>The knowledge would hardly have been worth the price he offered.
Aboard the <i>Lileth</i>, on the forward deck under a protecting
awning, Mr. Trimmer sat firmly planted in a chair. Beside him, in
other chairs, sat three prominent citizens of San Marco&mdash;one
of them the chief of police. Mr. Martin Wall was madly walking the
deck near by.</p>

<p>"Going to stay here all night?" he demanded at last.</p>

<p>"All night, and all day to-morrow," replied Mr. Trimmer, "if
necessary. We're going to stay here until that boat that's carrying
Lord Harrowby comes back. You can't fool Henry Trimmer."</p>

<p>"There isn't any such boat!" flared Martin Wall.</p>

<p>"Tell it to the marines," remarked Trimmer, lighting a fresh
cigar.</p>

<p>Just as well that the three shivering figures huddled in the
launch on the heaving bosom of the waters could not see this
picture. Mr. Wall looked out at the rain, and shivered himself.</p>

<p>Eleven-thirty came. And twelve. Two matches from Mr. Paddock's
store went to the discovery of these sad facts. Soaked to the skin,
glum, silent, the three on the waters sat staring at the
unresponsive <i>Lileth</i>. The rain was falling now in a fine
drizzle.</p>

<br>

<p>"I suppose," Paddock remarked, "we stay here until morning?"</p>

<p>"We might try landing on Tarragona," said Minot.</p>

<p>"We might try jumping into the ocean, too," responded Paddock,
through chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"Murder," droned poor old George. "That's what it'll be."</p>

<p>At one o'clock the three wet watchers beheld unusual things.
Smoke began to belch from the <i>Lileth</i>'s funnels. Her siren
sounded.</p>

<p>"She's steaming out!" cried Minot. "She's steaming out to
sea!"</p>

<p>And sure enough, the graceful yacht began to move&mdash;out past
Tarragona Island&mdash;out toward the open sea.</p>

<p>Once more Paddock started his faithful engine, and, hallooing
madly, the three set out in pursuit. Not yet had the <i>Lileth</i>
struck its gait, and in fifteen minutes they were alongside. Martin
Wall, beholding them from the deck, had a rather unexpected attack
of pity, and stopped his engines. The three limp watchers were
taken aboard.</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what does this mean?" chattered Minot.</p>

<p>"You poor devils," said Martin Wall. "Come and have a drink.
Mean?" He poured. "It means that the only way I could get rid of
our friend Trimmer was to set out for New York."</p>

<p>"For New York?" cried Minot, standing glass in hand.</p>

<p>"Yes. Came on board, Trimmer did, searched the boat, and then
declared I'd shipped George away until his visit should be over. So
he and his friends&mdash;one of them the chief of police, by the
way&mdash;sat down to wait for your return. Gad&mdash;I thought of
you out in that rain. Sat and sat and sat. What could I do?"</p>

<p>"To Trimmer, the brute," said Paddock, raising his glass.</p>

<p>"Finally I had an idea. I had the boys pull up anchor and start
the engines. Trimmer wanted to know the answer. 'Leaving for New
York tonight,' I said. 'Want to come along?' He wasn't sure whether
he would go or not, but his friends were sure they wouldn't. Put up
an awful howl, and just before we got under way Mr. Trimmer and
party crawled into their rowboat and splashed back to San
Marco."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what now?" asked Minot.</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind," said Wall. "Been intending to go back
north for some time, and now that I've started, I guess I'll keep
on going."</p>

<p>"Splendid," cried Minot. "And you'll take Mr. George Harrowby
with you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wall seemed in excellent spirits. He slapped Minot on the
back.</p>

<p>"If you say so, of course. Don't know exactly what they can do
to us&mdash;but I think George needs the sea air. How about it,
your lordship?"</p>

<p>Poor old George, drooping as he had never drooped before, looked
wearily into Wall's eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he said. "Fight's all gone out of me. Losing
interest in what's next. Three hours on that blooming ocean with
the rain soaking in&mdash;I'm going to bed. I don't care what
becomes of me."</p>

<p>And he sloshed away to his cabin.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I'm afraid we'll have to put you off," said Martin
Wall. "Glad to have met both of you. Sometime in New York we may
run into each other again."</p>

<p>He shook hands genially, and the two young men dropped once more
into that unhappy launch. As they sped toward the shore the
<i>Lileth</i>, behind them, was heading for the open sea.</p>

<p>"Sorry if I've seemed to have a grouch tonight," said Paddock,
as they walked up the deserted avenue toward the hotel. "But these
Florida rain-storms aren't the pleasantest things to wear next to
one's skin. I apologize, Dick."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Minot answered. "Old Job himself would have frowned
a bit if he'd been through what you have to-night. It was my fault
for getting you into it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it," Paddock said. "Well, it looks like a wedding, old
man. The letters home again, and George Harrowby headed for New
York&mdash;a three days' trip. Nothing to hinder now. Have you
thought of that?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to think," said Minot gloomily. "Good night, old
man."</p>

<p>Paddock sped up the stairs to his room, which was on the second
floor, and Minot turned toward the elevator. At that moment he saw
approaching him through the deserted lobby Mr. Jim O'Malley, the
house detective of the De la Pax.</p>

<p>"Can we see you a minute in the office, Mr. Minot?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Minot answered. "But&mdash;I'm soaked
through&mdash;was out in all that rain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too bad," said O'Malley, with a sympathetic glance. "We won't
keep you but a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>He led the way, and wondering, Minot followed. In the tiny
office of the hotel manager a bullet-headed man stood waiting.</p>

<p>"My friend, Mr. Huntley, of the Secret Service," O'Malley
explained. "Awful sorry that this should happen, Mr. Minot,
but&mdash;we got to search you."</p>

<p>"Search me&mdash;for what?" Minot cried.</p>

<p>And in a flash, he knew. Through that wild night he had not once
thought of it. But it was still in his inside coat pocket, of
course. Chain Lightning's Collar!</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's what they all say," grunted Huntley. "Come here, my boy.
Say, you're pretty wet. And shivering! Better have a warm bath and
a drink. Turn around, please. Ah&mdash;"</p>

<p>With practised fingers the detective explored rapidly Mr.
Minot's person and pockets. The victim of the search stood limp,
helpless. What could he do? There was no escape. It was all up
now&mdash;for whatever reason they desired Chain Lightning's
Collar, they could not fail to have it in another minute.</p>

<p>Side pockets&mdash;trousers pockets&mdash;now! The inner coat
pocket! Its contents were in the detective's hand. Minot stared
down. A little gasp escaped him.</p>

<p>The envelope that held Chain Lightning's Collar was not among
them!</p>

<p>Two minutes longer Huntley pursued, then with an oath of
disappointment he turned to O'Malley.</p>

<p>"Hasn't got it!" he announced.</p>

<p>Minot swept aside the profuse apologies of the hotel detective,
and somehow got out of the room. In a daze, he sought 389. He
didn't have it! Didn't have Chain Lightning's Collar! Who did?</p>

<p>It was while he sat steaming in a hot bath that an idea came to
him. The struggle on the deck of the <i>Lileth</i>, with Martin
Wall panting at his side! The tug on his coat as they all went down
together. The genial spirits of Wall thereafter. The sudden start
for New York.</p>

<p>No question about it&mdash;Chain Lightning's Collar was well out
at sea now.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;why had Wall stopped to take the occupants of the
launch aboard?</p>

<p>After his bath, Minot donned pajamas and a dressing-gown and
ventured out to find Lord Harrowby's suite. With difficulty he
succeeded in arousing the sleeping peer. Harrowby let him in, and
then sat down on his bed and stared at him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he inquired sleepily.</p>

<p>Briefly Minot told him of the circumstances preceding the start
of the <i>Lileth</i> for New York, of his return to the hotel, and
the search party he encountered there. Harrowby was very wide awake
by this time.</p>

<p>"That finishes us," he groaned. "Wait a minute," Minot said.
"They didn't find the necklace. I didn't have it. I'd lost it."
"Lost it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And if you want my opinion, I think Martin Wall stole it
from me on the <i>Lileth</i> and is now on his way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harrowby leaped from bed, and seized Minot gleefully by the
hand.</p>

<p>"Dear old chap. What the deuce do I care who took it. It's gone.
Thank God&mdash;it's gone."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. But you can understand this much. Everything's all right.
Nothing in the way of the wedding now. It's splendid!
Splendid!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the necklace was stolen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Good! Very good! My dear Minot, the luckiest thing that
can happen to us will be&mdash;never, never to see Chain
Lightning's Collar again!"</p>

<p>As completely at sea as he had been that night&mdash;which was
more or less at sea&mdash;Minot returned to his room. It was after
three o'clock. He turned out his lights and sought his bed. Many
wild conjectures kept him awake at first, but this had been the
busiest day of his life. Soon he slept, and dreamed thrilling
dreams.</p>

<p>The sun was bright outside his windows when he was aroused by a
knock.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried.</p>

<p>"A package for you, sir," said a bell-boy voice.</p>

<p>He slipped one arm outside his door to receive it&mdash;a neat
little bundle, securely tied, with his name written on the
wrappings. Sleepily he undid the cord, and took out&mdash;an
envelope.</p>

<p>He was no longer sleepy. He held the envelope open over his bed.
Chain Lightning's Collar tumbled, gleaming, upon the white
sheet!</p>

<p>Also in the package was a note, which Minot read
breathlessly.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Minot</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">"I have decided not to go north after all, and am
back in the harbor with the <i>Lileth</i>. As I expect Trimmer at
any moment I have sent George over to Tarragona Island in charge of
two sailormen for the day.</p>

<p class="letter">"Cordially,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Martin Wall</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">"P.S. You dropped the enclosed in the scuffle on
the boat last night."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">14. &mdash;JERSEY CITY INTERFERES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT ten o'clock that Saturday morning Lord Harrowby
was engrossed in the ceremony of breakfast in his rooms. For the
occasion he wore an orange and purple dressing-gown with a floral
design no botanist could have sanctioned&mdash;the sort of
dressing-gown that Arnold Bennett, had he seen it, would have made
a leading character in a novel. He was cheerful, was Harrowby, and
as he glanced through an old copy of the London <i>Times</i> he
made strange noises in his throat, under the impression that he was
humming a musical comedy chorus.</p>

<p>There was a knock, and Harrowby cried: "Come in." Mr. Minot,
fresh as the morning and nowhere near so hot, entered.</p>

<p>"Feeling pretty satisfied with life, I'll wager," Minot
suggested.</p>

<p>"My dear chap, gay as&mdash;as&mdash;a robin," Harrowby
replied.</p>

<p>"Snatch your last giggle," said Minot. "Have one final laugh,
and make it a good one. Then wake up."</p>

<p>"Wake up? Why, I am awake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;you're dreaming on a bed of roses. Listen! Martin
Wall didn't go north with the impostor after all. Changed his mind.
Look!"</p>

<p>And Minot tossed something on the table, just abaft his
lordship's eggs.</p>

<p>"The devil! Chain Lightning's Collar!" cried Harrowby.</p>

<p>"Back to its original storage vault," said Minot. "What is this,
Harrowby? A Drury Lane melodrama?"</p>

<p>"My word. I can't make it out."</p>

<p>"Can't you? Got the necklace back this morning with a note from
Martin Wall, saying I dropped it last night in the scrap on the
deck of the <i>Lileth</i>."</p>

<p>"Confound the thing!" sighed Harrowby, staring morosely at the
diamonds.</p>

<p>"My first impulse," said Minot, "is to hand the necklace back to
you and gracefully withdraw. But of course I'm here to look after
Jephson's interests&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naturally," put in Harrowby quickly. "And let me tell you that
should this necklace be found before the wedding, Jephson is
practically certain to pay that policy. I think you'd better keep
it. They're not likely to search you again. If I took it&mdash;dear
old chap&mdash;they search me every little while."</p>

<p>"You didn't steal this, did you?" Minot asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not." Harrowby flushed a delicate pink. "It belongs
in our family&mdash;has for years. Everybody knows that."</p>

<p>"Well, what is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain it all later. There's really nothing
dishonorable&mdash;as men of the world look at such things. I give
you my word that you can serve Mr. Jephson best by keeping the
necklace for the present&mdash;and seeing to it that it does not
fall into the hands of the men who are looking for it."</p>

<p>Minot sat staring gloomily ahead of him. Then he reached out,
took up the necklace, and restored it to his pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he said. "If I'm sent to jail, tell Thacker I
went singing an epithalamium." He rose.</p>

<p>"By the way," Harrowby remarked, "I'm giving a little dinner
to-night&mdash;at the Manhattan Club. May I count on you?"</p>

<p>"Surely," Minot smiled. "I'll be there, wearing our
necklace."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow&mdash;ah, I see you mean it pleasantly. Wear it,
by all means."</p>

<p>Minot passed from the eccentric blooms of that dressing-gown to
the more authentic flowers of the Florida outdoors. In the plaza he
met Cynthia Meyrick, rival candidate to the morning in its
glory.</p>

<p>"Matrimony," she said, "is more trouble than it seems on a
moonlit night under the palms. I've never been so busy in my life.
By the way, two of my bridesmaids arrived from New York last night.
Lovely girls&mdash;both of them. But I forget!"</p>

<p>"Forget what?"</p>

<p>"Your young heart is already ensnared, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Minot fervently. "It is. But no matter. Tell me
about your preparations for the wedding. I should like to enjoy the
thrill of it&mdash;by proxy."</p>

<p>"How like a man&mdash;wants all the thrill and none of the
bother. It's dreadfully hard staging a wedding, way down here a
thousand miles from everything. But&mdash;my gown came last night
from Paris. Can you imagine the thrill of that!"</p>

<p>"Only faintly."</p>

<p>"How stupid being a man must be."</p>

<p>"And how glorious being a girl, with man only an
afterthought&mdash;even at wedding time."</p>

<p>"Poor Harrowby! He keeps in the lime-light fairly well,
however." They walked along a moment in silence. "I've wondered,"
she said at length. "Why did you kidnap&mdash;Mr. Trimmer's
&mdash;friend?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"&mdash;eagerly.</p>

<p>Minot looked at her, and something rose in his throat to choke
him.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," he said. "It is the fault of&mdash;the
Master of the Show. I'm only the pawn&mdash;the baffled, raging,
unhappy little pawn. That's all I can tell you. You&mdash;you were
speaking of your wedding gown?"</p>

<p>"A present from Aunt Mary," she answered, a strange tenderness
in her tone. "For a good little girl who's caught a lord."</p>

<p>"A charming little girl," said Minot softly. "May I say
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" Her brown eyes glowed. "I'm&mdash;glad&mdash;to
have you&mdash;say it. I go in here. Good-by&mdash;Mr.
Kidnaper."</p>

<p>She disappeared into a shop, and Minot walked slowly down the
street. Girls from Peoria and Paris, from Boise City and London,
passed by. Girls chaperoned and girls alone&mdash;tourist girls in
swarms. And not a few of them wondered why such a good-looking
young man should appear to be so sorry for himself.</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel at noon, Minot met Martin Wall on the
veranda.</p>

<p>"Lucky I put old George on Tarragona for the day," Wall
confided. "As I expected, Trimmer was out to call early this
morning. Searched the ship from stem to stern. I rather think we
have Mr. Trimmer up a tree. He went away not quite so sure of
himself."</p>

<p>"Good," Minot answered. "So you changed your mind about going
north?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Think I'll stay over for the wedding. By the way, wasn't
that Chain Lightning's Collar you left behind you last night?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Thought so. You ought to be more careful. People might suspect
you of being the thief at Mrs. Brace's."</p>

<p>"If you think that, I wish you'd speak to his lordship."</p>

<p>"I have. Your innocence is established. And I've promised
Harrowby to keep his little mystery dark."</p>

<p>"You're very kind," said Minot, and went on into the hotel.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day passed lazily. Dick Minot felt lost
indeed, for seemingly there were no more doughty deeds to be done
in the name of Jephson. The Gaiety lady was gone; her letters were
in the hands of the man who had written them. The claimant to the
title languished among the alligators of Tarragona, a prisoner.
Trimmer appeared to be baffled. Bridesmaids arrived. The wedding
gown appeared. It looked like smooth sailing now.</p>

<p>Jack Paddock, met for a moment late in the afternoon, announced
airily:</p>

<p>"By the way, the Duke and Duchess of Lismore have come. You
know&mdash;the sausage lady and her captive. My word&mdash;you
should see her! A wardrobe to draw tears of envy from a theatrical
star. Fifty costly necklaces&mdash;and only one neck!"</p>

<p>"Tragic," smiled Minot.</p>

<p>"Funny thing's happened," Paddock whispered. "I met the duchess
once abroad. She sent for me this noon and almost bowled me over.
Seems she's heard of Mrs. Bruce as the wittiest woman in San Marco.
And she's jealous. 'You're a clever boy,' says her ladyship to me.
'Coach me up so I can outshine Mrs. Bruce.' What do you know?"</p>

<p>"Art&mdash;but you were the pioneer," Minot reminded him.</p>

<p>"Well, I was, for that matter," said Mr. Paddock. "But I know
now it wasn't a clever idea, if this woman can think of it,
too."</p>

<p>"What did you tell her?"</p>

<p>"I was shocked. I showed it. It seemed deception to me.
Still&mdash;she made me an offer that&mdash;well, I told her I'd
think it over."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Jack! You wouldn't try to sell 'em both
dialogue?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Play one against the other&mdash;make 'em keener for
my goods. I've got a notion to clean up here quick and then go back
to the real stuff. That little girl from the Middle West&mdash;I've
forgot all about her, of course. But speaking of cleaning
up&mdash;I'm thinking of it, Dick, my boy. Yes, I believe I'll take
them both on&mdash;secretly, of course. It means hard work for me,
but when one loves one's art, no service seems too tough."</p>

<p>"You're hopeless," Minot groaned.</p>

<p>"Say not so," laughed Paddock, and went away humming a frivolous
tune.</p>

<p>At a quarter before seven, for the first time, Minot entered Mr.
Tom Stacy's Manhattan Club and Grill. To any one who crossed Mr.
Stacy's threshold with the expectation of immediately encountering
lights and gaiety, the first view of the interior came as a
distinct shock. The main dining-room of the Manhattan Club was dim
with the holy dimness of a cathedral. Its lamps, hung high, were
buried in oriental trappings, and shone half-heartedly. Faintly
through the gloom could be discerned white table-cloths, gleaming
silver. The scene demanded hushed voices, noiseless footsteps. It
got both.</p>

<p>The main dining-room was hollowed out of the center of the great
stone building, and its roof was off in the dark three stories
above. On each side of the entrance, stairways led to second and
third-floor balconies which stretched around the room on three
sides. From these balconies doors opened into innumerable
rooms&mdash;rooms where lights shone brighter, and from which the
chief of police, when he came to make certain financial
arrangements with Mr. Stacy, heard frequently a gentle
click-click.</p>

<p>It may have been that the furnishings of the main dining-room
and the balconies were there before Mr. Stacy's coming, or again
they may have set forth his own idea of suitable decoration.
Looking about him, Mr. Minot was reminded of a play like Sumurun
after three hard seasons on the road. Moth-eaten rugs and musty
tapestries hung everywhere. Here and there an atrocious cozy corner
belied its name. Iron lanterns gave parsimonious light. Aged
sofa-pillows lay limply. "Oriental," Mr. Stacy would have called
the effect. Here in this dim, but scarcely religious light, the
patrons of his "grill" ate their food, being not without misgivings
as they stared through the gloom at their plates.</p>

<p>The long tables for the Harrowby dinner were already set, and
about them hovered waiters of a color to match the room. Most of
the guests had arrived. Mr. Paddock made it a point to introduce
Mr. Minot at once to the Duchess of Lismore. This noble lady with
the packing-house past was making a commendable effort to lighten
the Manhattan Club by a wonderful display of jewels.</p>

<p>"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet
swims into his ken," whispered Minot, as the duchess moved
away.</p>

<p>Paddock laughed.</p>

<p>"A dowdy little woman by day, but a pillar of fire by night," he
agreed. "By the way, I'm foreman of her composing-room, beginning
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Jack," Minot warned.</p>

<p>"A double life from now on," Paddock replied, "but I think I can
get away with it. Say, for ways that are dark this man Stacy seems
to hold a better hand than the heathen Chinee."</p>

<p>In one corner the portly Spencer Meyrick was orating to a circle
of young people on the evils of gambling. Minot turned away,
smiling cynically. Meyrick, as everybody knew, had made a large
part of his fortune in Wall Street.</p>

<p>The dinner was much larger than Mrs. Bruce's. Minot met a number
of new people&mdash;the anemic husband of the jewels, smug in his
dukedom, and several very attractive girls thrilled at being
present in Mr. Stacy's sinful lair. He bestowed a smile upon Aunt
Mary, serene among the best people, and discussed with Mrs.
Bruce&mdash;who wasted no boughten wit on him&mdash;the Florida
climate. Also, he asked the elder of the Omaha girls if she had
heard of Mr. Nat Goodwin's latest wife.</p>

<p>For once the dinner itself was a minor event. It sped rapidly
there in the gloom, and few so much as listened to the flashes of
Mrs. Bruce's wit&mdash;save perhaps the duchess, enviously. It was
after the dinner, when Harrowby led his guests to the entertainment
above, that interest grew tense.</p>

<p>No gloom in that bright room overhead. A cluster of electric
lights shed their brilliance on Mr. Stacy's pet roulette tables,
set amid parlor furnishings of atrocious plush. From one corner a
faro lay-out that had once flourished on Fifty-eighth Street, New
York, beckoned. And on each side, through open doors, might be seen
rooms furnished for the game of poker.</p>

<p>Mr. Stacy's assistant, a polished gentleman with a face like
aged ivory, presided over the roulette table. He swung the wheel a
few times, an inviting smile on his face. Harrowby, his eyes
bright, laid a sum of money beside a row of innocent figures. He
won. He tried again, and won. Some of the young women pushed close
to the table, visibly affected. Others pretended this sort of thing
was an old story to them.</p>

<p>A few of the more adventurous women borrowed coins from the men,
and joined in the play. Arguments and misunderstandings arose,
which Mr. Stacy's assistant urbanely settled. More of the
men&mdash;Paddock among them&mdash;laid money on the table.</p>

<p>A buzz of excited conversation, punctuated now and then by a
deathly silence as the wheel spun and the little ball hovered
heart-breakingly, filled the room. Cheeks glowed red, eyes
sparkled, the crush about the table increased. Spencer Meyrick
himself risked from his endless store. Mr. Tom Stacy's place was in
full swing.</p>

<p>Dick Minot caught Cynthia Meyrick's glance as she stood close
beside Lord Harrowby. She seemed another girl to-night, grave
rather than gay, her great brown eyes apparently looking into the
future, wondering, fearing. As for Harrowby, he was a man
transformed. Not for nothing was he the son of the sporting Earl of
Raybrook&mdash;the peer who never failed to take a risk. The
excitement of the game was reflected in his tall tense figure, his
flaming cheeks. This was the Harrowby who had made Jephson that
gambling proposition on a seventeenth floor in New York.</p>

<p>And Harrowby won consistently. Won, until a fatal choice of
numbers with an overwhelming stake left him poor again, and he saw
all his winnings swept to swell Tom Stacy's store. Quickly he
wormed his way out of the crowd and sought Minot.</p>

<p>"May I see you a moment?" he asked. "Out here." And he led the
way to the gloom of the balcony.</p>

<p>"If I only had the cash," Harrowby whispered excitedly, "I could
break Stacy to-night. And I'm going to get it. Will you give me the
necklace, please."</p>

<p>"You forget," Minot objected, "that the necklace is supposed to
have been stolen."</p>

<p>"No. No. That's no matter. I'll arrange that. Hurry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget, too, that you told me this morning that should this
necklace be found now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot&mdash;the necklace belongs to me. Will you kindly let
me have it."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Minot coldy. And, much annoyed, he returned to
the room amid the buzz and the thrill of gambling.</p>

<p>Harrowby ran quickly down the stairs. In the office of the club
he found Tom Stacy in amiable converse with Martin Wall. He threw
Chain Lightning's Collar on the manager's desk.</p>

<p>"How much can you loan me on that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>With a grunt of surprise, Mr. Stacy took up the famous collar in
his thick fingers. He gazed at it for a moment. Then he looked up,
and caught Martin Wall's crafty eye over Harrowby's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Not a cent," said Mr. Stacy firmly.</p>

<p>"What! I don't understand." Harrowby gazed at him blankly. "It's
worth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a cent," Stacy repeated. "That's final."</p>

<p>Harrowby turned appealingly to Martin Wall.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" he pleaded.</p>

<p>"I'm not investing," Wall replied, with a queer smile.</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby restored the necklace to his pocket and,
crestfallen, gloomy, went back to the room above.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't loan me anything on it," he whispered to Minot. "I
don't understand, really."</p>

<p>Thereafter Harrowby suffered the pain of watching others play.
And while he watched, in the little office down-stairs, a scene of
vital bearing on his future was enacted.</p>

<p>A short stocky man with a bullet-shaped head had pushed open the
door on Messrs. Stacy and Wall. He stood, looking about him with a
cynical smile.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom," he said.</p>

<p>"Old Bill Huntley!" cried Stacy. "By gad, you gave me a turn. I
forgot for a minute that you can't raid me down here."</p>

<p>"Them happy days is past," returned Mr. Huntley dryly. "I'm
working for Uncle Sam, now, Tom. Got new fish to fry. Used to have
some gay times in New York, didn't we? Oh, hello, Craig."</p>

<p>"My name is Martin Wall," said that gentleman stiffly.</p>

<p>"Ain't he got the lovely manners," said Huntley, pretending
admiration. "Always did have, too. And the swell friends. Still
going round in the caviar crowd, I hear. What if I was to tell your
friends here who you are?"</p>

<p>"You won't do that," said Wall, outwardly unshaken, but his
breath came faster..</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you're sure of that, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who I am isn't one of your worries in your new line of
business. And you're going to keep still because I can do you a
favor&mdash;and I will."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Craig. Excuse me&mdash;Martin Wall. Sort of a strain
keeping track of your names, you know."</p>

<p>"Forget that. I say I can do you a favor&mdash;if you'll promise
not to mix in my affairs." "Well&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"You're down here looking for a diamond necklace known as Chain
Lightning's Collar."</p>

<p>"Great little guesser, you are. Well&mdash;what about it?"</p>

<p>"Promise?"</p>

<p>"You deliver the goods, and I'll see."</p>

<p>"All right. You'll find that necklace in Lord Harrowby's pocket
right now. And you'll find Lord Harrowby in a room up-stairs."</p>

<p>Mr. Huntley stood for a moment staring at the man he called
Craig. Then with a grunt he turned away.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, in the bright room above, that same rather
vulgar grunt sounded in Lord Harrowby's patrician ear. He turned,
and his face paled. Hopelessly he looked toward Minot. Then without
a word he followed Huntley from the room.</p>

<p>Only two of that excited crowd about the wheel noticed. And
these two fled simultaneously to the balcony. There, half hidden
behind an ancient musty rug, Cynthia Meyrick and Minot watched
together.</p>

<br>

<p>Harrowby and Huntley descended the soft stairs. At the bottom,
Martin Wall and Stacy were waiting. The sound of voices pitched low
could be heard on the balcony, but though they strained to hear,
the pair above could not. However, they could see the plebeian hand
of Mr. Huntley held out to Lord Harrowby. They could see Harrowby
reach into his pocket, and bring forth a white envelope. Next they
beheld Chain Lightning's Collar gleam in the dusk as Huntley held
it up. A few low words, and Harrowby went out with the
detective.</p>

<p>Martin Wall ascended the stair. On the dim balcony he was
confronted by a white-faced girl whose wonderful copper hair had
once held Chain Lightning's Collar.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she asked, her voice low and tense.</p>

<p>"Mean?" Martin Wall laughed. "It means that Lord Harrowby must
go north and face a United States Commissioner in Jersey City. It
seems that when he brought that necklace over he quite forgot to
tell the customs officials about it."</p>

<p>"Go north! When?"</p>

<p>"To-night. On the midnight train. North to Jersey City."</p>

<p>Mr. Wall went into the bright room where the excitement buzzed
on, oblivious. Cynthia Meyrick turned to Minot.</p>

<p>"But he can't possibly get back&mdash;" she cried.</p>

<p>"No. He can't get back. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"And my wedding dress&mdash;came last night."</p>

<p>She stood clutching a moth-eaten tapestry in her slim white
hand. In the gloom of that dull old balcony her eyes shone
strangely.</p>

<p>"Some things aren't to be," she whispered. "And"&mdash;very
faintly&mdash;"others are."</p>

<p>A thrill shot through Minot, sharp as a pain, but glorious. What
did she mean by that? What indeed but the one thing that must not
happen&mdash;the thing he wanted most of all things in the world to
happen&mdash;the thing he had come to San Marco to prevent. He came
closer to her&mdash;and closer&mdash;the blood was pounding in his
brain. Dazed, exulting, he held out his arms.</p>

<p>"Cynthia!" he cried.</p>

<p>And then suddenly behind her, on the stairs, he caught sight of
a great bald head ascending through the dusk. It was an ordinary
bald head, the property of Mr. Stacy in fact, but to Minot a
certain Jephson seemed to be moving beneath it. He remembered. His
arms fell to his sides. He turned away.</p>

<p>"We must see what can be done," he said mechanically.</p>

<p>"Yes," Cynthia Meyrick agreed in an odd tone, "we must see what
can be done."</p>

<p>And a tear, unnoticed, fell on Mr. Stacy's aged oriental
tapestry.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">15. &mdash;A BIT OF A BLOW</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MISS Meyrick turned back toward the room of chance
to find her father. Minot, meanwhile, ran down the steps, obtained
his hat and coat, and hurried across the street to the hotel. He
went at once to Harrowby's rooms.</p>

<p>There he encountered a scene of wild disorder. The round-faced
valet was packing trunks against time, and his time-keeper, Mr.
Bill Huntley, sat in a corner, grim and silent, watch in hand. Lord
Harrowby paced the floor madly. When he saw Minot he held out his
long, lean, helpless hands.</p>

<p>"You've heard, old boy?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard," said Minot sharply. "A fine fix, Harrowby.
Why the deuce didn't you pay the duty on that necklace?"</p>

<p>"Dear boy! Was saving every cent I had for&mdash;you know what.
Besides, I heard of such a clever scheme for slipping it
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that! Mr. Huntley, this gentleman was to have been
married on Tuesday. Can't you hold off until then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," said Mr. Huntley firmly. "I got to get back to
New York. He'll have to postpone his wedding. Ought to have thought
of these things before he pulled off his little stunt."</p>

<p>"It's no use, Minot," said Harrowby hopelessly. "I've gone all
over it with this chap. He won't listen to reason. What the deuce
am I to do?"</p>

<p>A knock sounded on the door and Spencer Meyrick, red-faced,
flirting with apoplexy, strode into the room.</p>

<p>"Lord Harrowby," he announced, "I desire to see you alone."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;step into the bedroom," Harrowby suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. Huntley rose promptly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Nix," he said. "There's a door out of that room leading into
the hall. If you go in there, I go, too."</p>

<p>Mr. Meyrick glared. Harrowby stood embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Meyrick through his teeth. "We'll stay here.
It doesn't matter to me. I simply want to say, Lord Harrowby, that
when you get to Jersey City you needn't trouble to come back, as
far as my family is concerned."</p>

<p>A look of pain came into Harrowby's thin face.</p>

<p>"Not come back," he said. "My dear sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what I said. I'm a plain man, Harrowby. A plain
American. It doesn't seem to me that marrying into the British
nobility is worth all the trouble it's costing us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It may be, but it doesn't look that way to me. I prefer a
simple wedding to a series of vaudeville acts. If you think I'm
going to stand for the publicity of this latest affair, you're
mistaken. I've talked matters over with Cynthia&mdash;the marriage
is off&mdash;for good!"</p>

<p>"But my dear sir, Cynthia and I are very fond of each
other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn if you are!" Meyrick fumed. "This is the
last straw. I'm through with you. Good night, and good-by."</p>

<p>He stamped out as he had come, and Lord Harrowby fell limply
into a chair.</p>

<p>"All over, and all done," he moaned.</p>

<p>"And Jephson loses," said Minot with mixed emotions.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'm sorry." Harrowby shook his head tragically.
"Sorrier than you are, old chap. I love Cynthia
Meyrick&mdash;really I do. This is a bit of a blow."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" cried Mr. Huntley. "I'm not going to miss that
train while you play-act. We've only got half an hour, now."</p>

<p>Harrowby rose unhappily and went into the inner room, Huntley at
his heels. Minot sat, his unseeing eyes gazing down at the old copy
of the London <i>Times</i> which Harrowby had been reading that
morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>Gradually, despite his preoccupation, a name In a head-line
forced itself to his attention. Courtney Giles. Where had he heard
that name before? He picked up the <i>Times</i> from the table on
which it was lying. He read:</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"<i>The Ardent Lover</i>, the new romantic comedy
in which Courtney Giles has appeared briefly at the West End Road
Theater, will be removed from the boards to-night. The public has
not been appreciative. If truth must be told&mdash;and bitter truth
it is&mdash;the once beloved matinee idol has become too fat to
hold his old admirers, and they have drifted steadily to other,
slimmer gods. Mr. Giles' early retirement from the stage is
rumored."</p>
<br>

<p>Minot threw down the paper. Poor old Jephson! First the rain on
the dowager duchess, then an actor's expanding waist&mdash;and
to-morrow the news that Harrowby's wedding was not to be. Why, it
would ruin the man!</p>

<p>Minot stepped to the door of the inner room.</p>

<p>"I'm going out to think," he announced. "I'll see you in the
lobby before you leave."</p>

<p>Two minutes later, in the summer-house where he had bid good-by
to the sparkling Gaiety lady, he sat puffing furiously at a cigar.
Back into the past as it concerned Chain Lightning's Collar he
went. That night when Cynthia Meyrick had worn it in her hair, and
Harrowby, hearing of the search for it&mdash;had snatched it in the
dark. His own guardianship of the valuable trinket&mdash;Martin
Wall's invasion of his rooms&mdash;the "dropping" of the jewels on
shipboard, and the return of them by Mr. Wall next morning. And
last, but not least, Mr. Stacy's firm refusal to loan money on the
necklace that very night.</p>

<p>All these things Minot pondered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Harrowby, having finished his packing, descended to
the lobby of the De la Pax. In a certain pink parlor he found
Cynthia Meyrick, and stood gazing helplessly into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Cynthia&mdash;your father said&mdash;is it true?"</p>

<p>"It's true, Allan."</p>

<p>"You too wish the wedding&mdash;indefinitely postponed?"</p>

<p>"Father thinks it best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you?" He came closer. "You, Cynthia?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. There has been so much trouble,
Allan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. And I'm fearfully sorry about this latest. But,
Cynthia&mdash;you mustn't send me away&mdash;I love you. Do you
doubt that?"</p>

<p>"No, Allan."</p>

<p>"You're the most wonderful girl who has ever come into my
life&mdash;I want you in it always&mdash;beside me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At any rate, Allan, a wedding next Tuesday is impossible
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm afraid it is. And after that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After that&mdash;I don't know, Allan."</p>

<p>Aunt Mary came into the room, distress written plainly in her
plump face. No misstep of the peerage was beyond Aunt Mary's
forgiveness. She took Harrowby's hand.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, your lordship," she said. "Most unfortunate. But
I'm sure it will all be cleared away in time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Huntley made it a point to interrupt. He stood at the door,
watch in hand.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said. "We've got to start."</p>

<p>Harrowby followed the ladies from the room. In the lobby Spencer
Meyrick joined them. His lordship shook hands with Aunt Mary, with
Mr. Meyrick&mdash;then he turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Cynthia," he said unhappily. He took her slim white
hand in his. Then he turned quickly and started with Huntley for
the door.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Mr. Minot, his cigar and his
cogitations finished, entered upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," he said to Mr. Huntley.</p>

<p>"Not another minute," remarked Huntley with decision. "Not for
the King of England himself. We got just fifteen of 'em left to
catch that train, and if I know San Marco hackmen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got time to answer one or two questions." Impressed by
Minot's tone, the Meyrick family moved nearer. "There's no doubt,
is there, Mr. Huntley, that the necklace you have in your pocket is
the one Lord Harrowby brought from England?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Now, get out of the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you a good judge of jewels, Mr. Huntley?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've got a little reputation in that line. But
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I suggest," said Minot impressively, "that you examine
Chain Lightning's Collar closely."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the suggestion," sneered Mr. Huntley. "I'll follow
it&mdash;when I get time. Just now I've got to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd better follow it now&mdash;before you catch a train.
Otherwise you may be so unfortunate as to make a fool of
yourself."</p>

<p>Mr. Huntley stood, hesitating. There was something in Minot's
tone that rang true. The detective again looked at his watch. Then,
with one of his celebrated grunts, he pulled out the necklace, and
stood staring at it with a new expression.</p>

<p>He grunted again, and stepped to a near-by writing-desk, above
which hung a powerful electric light. The others followed. Mr.
Huntley laid the necklace on the desk, and took out a small
microscope which was attached to one end of his watch-chain. With
rapt gaze he stared at the largest of the diamonds. He went the
length of the string, examining each stone in turn. The expression
on Mr. Huntley's face would have made him a star in the
"movies."</p>

<p>"Hell!" he cried, and threw Chain Lightning's Collar down on the
desk.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Minot smiled.</p>

<p>"Glass," snarled Huntley. "Fine old bottle glass. What do you
know about that?"</p>

<p>"But really&mdash;it can't be&mdash;" put in Harrowby.</p>

<p>"Well it is," Mr. Huntley glared at him. "The inspector might
have known you moth-eaten noblemen ain't got any of the real stuff
left."</p>

<p>"I won't believe it&mdash;" Harrowby began, but caught Minot's
eye.</p>

<p>"It's true, just the same," Minot said. "By the way, Mr.
Huntley, how much is that little ornament worth?"</p>

<p>"About nine dollars and twenty-five cents." Mr. Huntley still
glared angrily.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you can't take Lord Harrowby back for not declaring
that, can you?"</p>

<p>"No," snorted Huntley. "But I can go back myself, and I'm
going&mdash;on that midnight train. Good-by."</p>

<p>Minot followed him to the door.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to thank me?" he asked. "You know, I saved
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you! Hell!" said Huntley, and disappeared into the
dark.</p>

<p>When Minot returned he found Harrowby standing facing the
Meyricks, and holding the necklace in his hand as though it were a
bomb on the point of exploding.</p>

<p>"I say, I feel rather low," he was saying, "when I remember that
I made you a present of this thing, Cynthia. But on my honor, I
didn't know. And I can scarcely believe it now. I know the governor
has been financially embarrassed&mdash;but I never suspected him of
this&mdash;the associations were so dear&mdash;really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It may not have been your father who duplicated Chain
Lightning's Collar with a fake," Minot suggested.</p>

<p>"My word, old boy, who then?"</p>

<p>"You remember," said Minot, addressing the Meyricks, "that the
necklace was stolen recently. Well&mdash;it was returned to Lord
Harrowby under unusual circumstances. At least, this collection of
glass was returned. My theory is that the thief had a duplicate
made&mdash;an old trick."</p>

<p>"The very idea," Harrowby cried. "I say, Minot, you are clever.
I should never have thought of that."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Minot dryly. He sought to avoid Miss Cynthia
Meyrick's eyes.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;by the way," said Harrowby, looking at Spencer
Meyrick. "There is nothing to prevent the wedding now."</p>

<p>The old man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I leave that to my daughter," he said, and turned away.</p>

<p>"Cynthia?" Harrowby pleaded.</p>

<p>Miss Meyrick cast a strange look at Minot, standing forlorn
before her. And then she smiled&mdash;not very happily.</p>

<p>"There seems to be no reason for changing our plans," she said
slowly. "It would be a great disappointment to&mdash;so many
people. Good night."</p>

<p>Minot followed her to the elevator.</p>

<p>"It's as I told you this morning," he said miserably. "I'm just
one of the pawns in the hands of the Master of the Show. I can't
explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is there to explain?" the girl asked coldly. "I
congratulate you on a highly successful evening."</p>

<p>The elevator door banged shut between them.</p>

<p>Turning, Minot encountered Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"You clever boy," she cried. "We are all so very grateful to
you. You have saved us from a very embarrassing situation."</p>

<p>"Please don't mention it," Minot replied, and he meant it.</p>

<p>He sat down beside the dazed Harrowby on one of the lobby
sofas.</p>

<p>"I'm all at sea, really, old chap," Harrowby confessed. "But I
must say&mdash;I admire you tremendously. How the devil did you
know the necklace was a fraud?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know&mdash;I guessed," said Minot. "And the thing that
led me to make that happy guess was Tom Stacy's refusal to loan you
money on it to-night. Mr. Stacy is no fool."</p>

<p>"And you think that Martin Wall has the real Chain Lightning's
Collar?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way to me. There's only one thing against my
theory. He didn't clear out when he had the chance. But he may be
staying on to avert suspicion. We haven't any evidence to arrest
him on&mdash;and if we did there'd be the customs people to deal
with. If I were you I'd hire a private detective to watch Wall, and
try to get the real necklace back without enlisting the arm of the
law."</p>

<p>"Really," said Harrowby, "things are happening so swiftly I'm at
a loss to follow them. I am, old boy. First one obstacle and then
another. You've been splendid, Minot, splendid. I want to thank you
for all you have done. I thought to-night the wedding had gone
glimmering. And I'm fond of Miss Meyrick. Tremendously."</p>

<p>"Don't thank me," Minot replied. "I'm not doing it for
you&mdash;we both know that. I'm protecting Jephson's money. In a
few days, wedding-bells. And then me back to New York, shouting
never again on the Cupid act. If I'm ever roped into another job
like this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has been a trying position for you," Harrowby said
sympathetically. "And you've done nobly. I'm sure your troubles are
all out of the way now. With the necklace worry gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. For across the lobby toward them walked Henry
Trimmer, and his walk was that of a man who is going somewhere.</p>

<p>"All&mdash;Mister Harrowby," he boomed, "and Mr. Minot. I've
been looking for you both. It will interest you to know that I had
a wireless message from Lord Harrowby this noon."</p>

<p>"A wireless?" cried Minot.</p>

<p>"Yes." Trimmer laughed. "Not such a fool as you think him, Lord
Harrowby isn't. Managed to send me a wireless from Tarragona
despite the attentions of your friends. So I went out there this
afternoon and brought George back with me."</p>

<p>Silently Minot and Harrowby stared at each other.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Trimmer went on, "George is back again&mdash;back
under the direction of little me, a publicity man with no grass
under the feet. I've come to give you gentlemen your choice. You
either see Lord Harrowby to-morrow morning at ten o'clock and
recognize his claims, or I'll have you both thrown into jail for
kidnaping."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning at ten," Harrowby repeated gloomily.</p>

<p>"That's what I said," replied Mr. Trimmer blithely. "How about
it, little brother?"</p>

<p>"Minot&mdash;what would you advise?"</p>

<p>"See him," sighed Minot.</p>

<p>"Very well." Harrowby's tone was resigned. "I presume I'd
better."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;coming to your senses, aren't you?" said Trimmer. "I
hope we aren't spoiling the joyous wedding-day. But then, what I
say is, if the girl's marrying you just for the title&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harrowby leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"You haven't been asked for an opinion," he said.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Don't get excited. I'll see you both in the
morning at ten." And Mr. Trimmer strolled elegantly away.</p>

<p>Harrowby turned hopefully to Minot.</p>

<p>"At ten in the morning," he repeated. "Old chap, what are we
going to do at ten in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," smiled Minot. "But if past performances mean
anything, we'll win."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">16.&mdash;WHO'S WHO IN ENGLAND</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHAT'S the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Seated in the lobby of the De la Pax on Sunday morning, Mr.
Trimmer turned a disapproving eye upon the lank Englishman at his
side as he made this query. And his question was not without good
foundation. For the aspirant to the title of Lord Harrowby was at
the moment a jelly quaking with fear.</p>

<p>"Fawncy meeting you after all these years," said poor old George
in an uncertain treble.</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried Mr. Trimmer, "put a little more authority
into your voice. You can't walk up and claim your rights with your
knees dancing the tango. This is the moment we've been looking
forward to. Act determined. Walk into that room up-stairs as though
you were walking into Rakedale Hall to take charge of it."</p>

<p>"Allan, don't you know me&mdash;I'm your brother George," went
on the Englishman, intent on rehearsing.</p>

<p>"More like it," said Trimmer. "Put the fire into it. You're not
expecting a thrashing, you know. You're expecting the title and
recognition that belongs to you. I wish I was the real Lord
Harrowby. I guess I'd show 'em a thing or two."</p>

<p>"I wish you was," agreed poor old George sadly. "Somehow, I
don't seem to have the spirit I used to have."</p>

<p>"A good point," commented Trimmer. "Years of wrong and suffering
have made you timid. I'll call that to their attention. Five
minutes of ten, your lordship."</p>

<p>His lordship groaned.</p>

<p>"All right, I'm ready," he said. "What is it I say as I go in?
Oh, yes&mdash;" He stepped into the elevator&mdash;"Fawncy seeing
you after all these years."</p>

<p>The negro elevator boy was somewhat startled at this greeting,
but regained his composure and started the car. Mr. Trimmer and his
"proposition" shot up toward their great opportunity.</p>

<p>In Lord Harrowby's suite that gentleman sat in considerable
nervousness, awaiting the undesired encounter. With him sat Miss
Meyrick and her father, whom he had thought it necessary to invite
to witness the ordeal. Mr. Richard Minot uneasily paced the floor,
avoiding as much as possible the glances of Miss Meyrick's brown
eyes. Ten o'clock was upon him, and Mr. Minot was no nearer a plan
of action than he had been the preceding night.</p>

<p>Every good press agent is not without a live theatrical sense,
and Mr. Trimmer was no exception. He left his trembling claimant in
the entrance hall and strode into the room.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said brightly. "Here we are, on time to the
minute. Ah&mdash;I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby performed brief introductions, which Mr. Trimmer
effusively acknowledged. Then he turned dramatically toward his
lordship.</p>

<p>"Out here in the hallway stands a poor broken creature," he
began. "Your own flesh and blood, Allan Harrowby." Obviously Mr.
Trimmer had prepared speeches for himself as well as for poor old
George. "For twenty odd and impecunious years," he went on, "this
man has been denied his just heritage. We are here this morning to
perform a duty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," broke in Harrowby wearily, "why should you
inflict oratory upon us? Bring in
this&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman."</p>

<p>"That I will," replied Trimmer heartily. "And when you have
heard his story, digested his evidence, I am sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Bring him in."</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer stepped to the door. He beckoned. A very reluctant
figure shuffled in. George's face was green with fright. His knees
rattled together. He made, altogether, a ludicrous picture, and Mr.
Trimmer himself noted this with sinking heart.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Trimmer theatrically. "George, Lord
Harrowby."</p>

<p>George cleared his throat, but did not succeed in dislodging his
heart, which was there at the moment.</p>

<p>"Fawncy seeing you after all these years," he mumbled weakly, to
no one in particular.</p>

<p>"Speak up," said Spencer Meyrick sharply. "Who is it you're
talking to?"</p>

<p>"To him," explained George, nodding toward Lord Harrowby. "To my
brother Allan. Don't you know me, Allan? Don't you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped. An expression of surprise and relief swept over his
worried face. He turned triumphantly to Trimmer.</p>

<p>"I don't have to prove who I am to him," he announced.</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" demanded Trimmer in alarm.</p>

<p>"Because he can't, I fancy," put in Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>"No," said George slowly, "because I never saw him before in all
my life."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you admit it," cried Allan Harrowby with relief.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," replied George. "I never saw you before in my
life."</p>

<p>"And you've never been at Rakedale Hall, have you?" Lord
Harrowby demanded.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;" shouted Trimmer, in a
panic.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I've been at Rakedale Hall," said the claimant
firmly. "I spent my boyhood there. But you've never been there."
here. Let's go over to London now and see the pater."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've never been at Rakedale Hall. Why? Because you're not
Allan Harrowby! That's why."</p>

<p>A deathly silence fell. Only a little traveling clock on the
mantel was articulate.</p>

<p>"Absurd&mdash;ridiculous&mdash;" cried Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>"Talk about impostors," cried George, his spirit and his courage
sweeping back. "You're one yourself. I wish I'd got a good look at
you sooner, I'd have put a stop to all this. Allan Harrowby, eh? I
guess not. I guess I'd know my own brother if I saw him. I guess I
know the Harrowby features. I give you twenty-four hours to get out
of town&mdash;you blooming fraud."</p>

<p>"The man's crazy," Allan Harrowby cried. "Raving mad. He's an
impostor&mdash;this is a trick of his&mdash;" He looked helplessly
around the circle. In every face he saw doubt, questioning. "Good
heavens&mdash;you're not going to listen to him? He's come here to
prove that he's George Harrowby. Why doesn't he do it?"</p>

<br>

<p>"I'll do it," said George sweetly, "when I meet a real Harrowby.
In the meantime, I give you twenty-four hours to get out of town.
You'd better go."</p>

<p>Victorious, George turned toward the door. Trimmer, lost between
admiration and doubt, turned also.</p>

<p>"Take my advice," George proclaimed. "Make him prove who he is.
That's the important point now. What does it matter to you who I
am? Nothing. But it matters a lot about him. Make him prove that
he's Allan Harrowby."</p>

<p>And, with the imperious manner that he should have adopted on
entering the room, George Harrowby left it. Mr. Trimmer, eclipsed
for once, trotted at his side.</p>

<p>"Say," cried Trimmer in the hall, "is that on the level? Isn't
he Allan Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"I should say not," said George grandly. "Doesn't look anything
like Allan."</p>

<p>Trimmer chortled in glee.</p>

<p>"Great stuff," he cried. "I guess we tossed a bomb, eh? Now,
we'll run him out of town."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said George. "We've done our work here. Let's go over
to London now and see the pater."</p>

<p>"That we will," cried Trimmer. "That we will. By gad, I'm proud
of you to-day, Lord Harrowby."</p>

<p>Inside Allan Harrowby's suite three pairs of questioning eyes
were turned on that harassed nobleman. He fidgeted in his
chair.</p>

<p>"I say," he pleaded. "It's all his bluff, you know."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said old Spencer Meyrick, rising. "But
Harrowby&mdash;or whatever your name is&mdash;there's altogether
too much three-ring circus about this wedding to suit me. My
patience is exhausted, sir&mdash;clean exhausted. Things look queer
to me&mdash;have right along. I'm more than inclined to believe
what that fellow said."</p>

<p>"But my dear sir&mdash;that chap is a rank impostor. There
wasn't a word of truth in what he said. Cynthia&mdash;you
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;I suppose so," the girl replied. "You are Allan
Harrowby, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"My dear girl&mdash;of course I am."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Spencer Meyrick with decision, "I'm going
to call the wedding off again. Some of your actions haven't made
much of a hit with me. I'm going to call it off until you come to
me and prove that you're Allan Harrowby&mdash;a lord in good and
regular standing, with all dues paid."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;confound it, sir&mdash;a gentleman's
word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Meyrick," put in Minot, "may I be allowed to say that I
consider your action hasty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And may I be allowed to ask what affair this is of yours?"
demanded Mr. Meyrick hotly.</p>

<p>"Father!" cried Miss Meyrick. "Please do not be harsh with Mr.
Minot. His heart is absolutely set on my marriage with Lord
Harrowby. Naturally he feels very badly over all this."</p>

<p>Minot winced.</p>

<p>"Come, Cynthia," said Meyrick, moving toward the door. "I've had
enough of this play-acting. Remember, sir&mdash;the wedding is
off&mdash;absolutely off&mdash;until you are able to establish your
identity beyond question."</p>

<p>And he and his daughter went out. Minot sat for a long time
staring at Lord Harrowby. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>"Say, Harrowby," he inquired, "who the devil are you?"</p>

<p>His lordship sadly shook his head.</p>

<p>"You, too, Brutus," he sighed. "Haven't I one friend left? I'm
Allan Harrowby. Ask Jephson. If I weren't, that policy that's
causing you so much trouble wouldn't be worth the paper it's
written on."</p>

<p>"That's right, too. Well, admitting you're Harrowby, how are you
going to prove it?"</p>

<p>"I've an idea," Harrowby replied.</p>

<p>"Everything comes to him who waits. What is it?"</p>

<p>"A very good friend of mine&mdash;an old Oxford friend&mdash;is
attached to our embassy at Washington. He was planning to come down
for the wedding. I'll telegraph him to board the next train."</p>

<p>"Good boy," said Minot. "That's a regular idea. Better send the
wire at once."</p>

<p>Harrowby promised, and they parted. In the lobby below Mr. Minot
met Jack Paddock. Paddock looked drawn and worried.</p>

<p>"Working up my stuff for the dinner the little Lismore lady is
giving to the bridal party tomorrow night," he confided. "Say, it's
no cinch to do two of them. Can't you suggest a topic that's liable
to come up."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Minot. "I can suggest one. Fake noblemen." And he
related to Mr. Paddock the astounding events of the morning.</p>

<p>That Sunday that had begun so startlingly progressed as a Sunday
should, in peace. Early in the afternoon Harrowby hunted Minot up
and announced that his friend would arrive Monday noon, and that
the Meyricks had agreed to take no definite step pending his
arrival.</p>

<p>Shortly after six o'clock a delayed telegram was delivered to
Mr. Minot. It was from Mr. Thacker, and it read:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"HAVE LOCATED THE OWNER OF THE YACHT 'LILETH'
ITS REAL NAME THE 'LADY EVELYN' STOLEN FROM OWNER IN NORTH RIVER HE
IS ON HIS WAY SOUTH WILL LOOK YOU UP ON ARRIVAL."</p>
<br>

<p>Minot whistled. Here was a new twist for the drama to take.</p>

<p>At about the same time that Minot received his message, a
similar slip of yellow paper was put into the hands of Lord
Harrowby. Three times he read it, his eyes staring, his cheeks
flushed.</p>

<p>Then he fled to his rooms. The elevator was not quick enough; he
sped up the stairs. Once in his suite he dragged out the nearest
traveling-bag and began to pack like a mad man.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot was finishing a leisurely and lonely dinner about an
hour later when Jack Paddock ran up to his table. Mr. Paddock's
usual calm was sadly ruffled.</p>

<p>"Dick," he cried, "here's news for you. I met Lord Harrowby
sliding out a side door with a suit-case just now."</p>

<p>Minot leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" he wondered aloud.</p>

<p>"Mean ?"'answered Mr. Paddock. "It means just one thing. Old
George had the right dope. Harrowby is a fake. He's making his
get-away."</p>

<p>Minot threw down his napkin.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is, is he?" he cried. "Well, I guess not. Come on,
Jack."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going down to the station and stop him. He's caused me too
much trouble to let him slide out like this. A fake, eh? Well, I'll
have him behind the bars to-night."</p>

<p>A negro cab driver was, by superhuman efforts, roused to hasty
action. He rattled the two young men wildly down the silent street
to the railway station. They dashed into the drab little waiting
room just as a voice called:</p>

<p>"Train for the north! Jacksonville! Savannah! Washington! New
York!"</p>

<p>"There he is!" Paddock cried, and pointed to the lean figure of
Lord Harrowby slipping out the door nearest the train-shed.</p>

<p>Paddock and Minot ran across the waiting room and out into the
open. In the distance they saw Harrowby passing through the gate
and on to the tracks. They ran up just in time to have the gate
banged shut in their faces.</p>

<p>"Here," cried Minot. "I've got to get in there. Let me
through!"</p>

<p>"Where's your ticket?" demanded the great stone face on
guard.</p>

<p>"I haven't got one, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too late anyhow," said the face. "The train's started."</p>

<p>Through the wooden pickets Minot saw the long yellow string of
coaches slipping by. He turned to Paddock.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he cried, exulting. "Let him go. Come on!"</p>

<p>He dashed back to the carriage that had brought them from the
hotel, the driver of which sat in a stupor trying to regain his
wits and nonchalance.</p>

<p>"What now?" Paddock wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Get in!" commanded Minot. He pushed his friend on to the musty
seat, and followed.</p>

<p>"To the De la Pax," he cried, "as fast as you can go."</p>

<p>"But what the devil's the need of hurrying now?" demanded
Paddock.</p>

<p>"All the need in the world," replied Minot joyously. "I'm going
to have a talk with Cynthia Meyrick. A little
talk&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Paddock softly, "love's young dream."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">17. &mdash;THE SHORTEST WAY HOME</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE moon was shining in that city of the
picturesque past. Its light fell silvery on the narrow streets, the
old adobe houses, the listless palms. In every shadow seemed to
lurk the memory of a love long dead&mdash;a love of the old
passionate Spanish days. A soft breeze came whispering from the
very sea Ponce de Leon had sailed. It was as if at a signal&mdash;a
bugle-call, a rose thrown from a window, the boom of a cannon at
the water's edge&mdash;the forgotten past of hot hearts, of arms
equally ready for cutlass or slender waist, could live again.</p>

<p>And Minot was as one who had heard such a signal. He loved. The
obstacle that had confronted him, wrung his heart, left him
helpless, was swept away. He was like a man who, released from
prison, sees the sky, the green trees, the hills again. He loved!
The moon was shining!</p>

<p>He stood amid the colorful blooms of the hotel courtyard and
looked up at her window, with its white curtain waving gently in
the breeze. He called, softly. And then he saw her face, peering
out as some senorita of the old days from her lattice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've news&mdash;very important news," he said. "May I see you a
moment?"</p>

<p>Far better this than the telephone or the bellboy. Far more in
keeping with the magic of the night.</p>

<p>She came, dressed in the white that set off so well her hair of
gleaming copper. Minot met her on the veranda. She smiled into his
eyes inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Do you mind&mdash;a little walk?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Whereto?"</p>

<p>"Say to the fort&mdash;the longest way."</p>

<p>She glanced back toward the hotel.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I ought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that will only make it the more exciting.</p>

<p>Please. And I've news&mdash;real news."</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and they crossed the</p>

<p>courtyard to the avenue. From this bright thoroughfare they
turned in a moment into a dark and unkempt street.</p>

<p>"See," said Minot suddenly, "the old Spanish churchyard. They
built cities around churches in the old days. The world do move.
It's railroad stations now."</p>

<p>They stood peering through the gloom at a small chapel dim amid
the trees, and aged stones leaning tipsily among the weeds.</p>

<p>"At the altar of that chapel," Minot said, "a priest
fell&mdash;shot in the back by an Indian's arrow. Sounds unreal,
doesn't it? And when you think that under these musty stones lies
the dust of folks who walked this very ground, and loved, and
hated, like you and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but isn't it all rather gloomy?" Cynthia Meyrick
shuddered.</p>

<p>They went on, to pass shortly through the crumbling remains of
the city gates. There at the water's edge the great gray fort
loomed in the moonlight like a historical novelist's dream. Its
huge iron-bound doors were locked for the night; its custodian home
in the bosom of his family. Only its lower ramparts were left for
the feet of romantic youth to tread.</p>

<p>Along these ramparts, close to the shimmering sea, Miss Meyrick
and Minot walked. Truth to tell, it was not so very difficult to
keep one's footing&mdash;but once the girl was forced to hold out
an appealing hand.</p>

<p>"French heels are treacherous," she explained.</p>

<p>Minot took her hand, and for the first time knew the thrill
that, encountered often on the printed page, he had mentally
classed as "rubbish!" Wisely she interrupted it:</p>

<p>"You said you had news?"</p>

<p>He had, but it was not so easy to impart as he had expected.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "if it should turn out that what poor old
George said this morning was a fact&mdash;that Allan Harrowby was
an impostor&mdash;would you feel so very badly?"</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>"You have no right to ask that," she replied.</p>

<p>"Forgive me. Indeed I haven't. But I was moved to ask it for the
reason that&mdash;what George said was evidently true. Allan
Harrowby left suddenly for the north an hour ago."</p>

<p>The girl stood still, looking with wide eyes out over the
sea.</p>

<p>"Left&mdash;for the north," she repeated. There was a long
silence. At length she turned to Minot, a queer light in her eyes.
"Of course, you'll go after him and bring him back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No." Minot bowed his head. "I know I must have looked rather
silly of late. But if you think I did the things I've done because
I chose to&mdash;you're wrong. If you think I did them because I
didn't love you&mdash;you're wrong, too. Oh, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I know it's indecently soon&mdash;I've got to
tell you just the same. There's been so much in the way&mdash;I'm
wild to say it now. I love you."</p>

<p>The water breaking on the ancient stones below seemed to be
repeating "Sh&mdash;sh," but Minot paid no heed to the warning.</p>

<p>"I've cared for you," he went on, "ever since that morning on
the train when we raced the razor-backs&mdash;ever since that
wonderful ride over a God-forsaken road that looked like Heaven to
me. And every time since that I've seen you I've known that I'd
come to care more&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl stood and stared thoughtfully out at the soft blue sea.
Minot moved closer, over those perilous slippery rocks.</p>

<p>"I know it's an old story to you," he went on, "and that I'd be
a fool to hope that I could possibly be anything but just another
man who adores you. But&mdash;because I love you so
much&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>"And in spite of all this," she said slowly, "from the first you
have done everything in your power to prevent the breaking off of
my engagement to Harrowby."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Weren't you overly chivalrous to a rival? Wouldn't
what&mdash;what you are saying be more convincing if you had
remained neutral?"</p>

<p>"I know. I can't explain it to you now. It's all over, anyway.
It was horrible while it lasted&mdash;but it's over now. I'm never
going to work again for your marriage to anybody&mdash;except one
man. The man who is standing before you&mdash;who loves
you&mdash;loves you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for the girl was smiling. And it was not the sort of
smile that his words were entitled to.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, really," she said. "But I can't help it. All I can
see now is your triumphant entrance last night&mdash;your masterly
exposure of that silly necklace&mdash;your clever destruction of
every obstacle in order that Harrowby and I might be married on
Tuesday. In the light of all that has happened&mdash;how can you
expect to appear other than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Foolish? You're right. And you couldn't possibly
care&mdash;just a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, embarrassed. Poorly chosen words, those last. He saw
the light of recollection in her eye.</p>

<p>"I should say," he went on hastily, "isn't there just a faint
gleam of hope&mdash;for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If we were back on the train," she said, "and all that followed
could be different&mdash;and Harrowby had never been&mdash;I
might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"I might not say what I'm going to say now. Which
is&mdash;hadn't we better return to the hotel?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," remarked Minot. "Sorry I had the bad taste to say
what I have at this time&mdash;but if you knew and could
understand&mdash;which you can't of course&mdash;Yes, let's go back
to the hotel&mdash;the shortest way."</p>

<p>He turned, and looked toward the towers of the De la Pax rising
to meet the sky&mdash;seemingly a million miles away. So Peary
might have gazed to the north, setting out for the Pole.</p>

<p>They went back along the ramparts, over the dry moat, through
the crumbling gates. Conversation languished. Then the ancient
graveyard, ghastly in the gloom. After that the long lighted street
of humble shops. And the shortest way home seemed a million times
longer than the longest way there.</p>

<p>"Considering what you have told me of&mdash;Harrowby," she said,
"I shall be leaving for the north soon. Will you look me up in New
York?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," Minot said. "It will be a very great
privilege."</p>

<p>Cynthia Meyrick entered the elevator, and out of sight in that
gilded cage she smiled a twisted little smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Minot beheld Mr. Trimmer and his "proposition" basking in
the lime-light of the De la Pax, and feeling in no mood to listen
to the publicity man's triumphant cackle, he hurried to the
veranda. There he found a bell-boy calling his name.</p>

<p>"Gen'lemun to see you," the boy explained. He led the way back
into the lobby and up to a tall athletic-looking man with a ruddy,
frank, attractive face.</p>

<p>The stranger held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot, of Lloyds?" he asked. "How do you do, sir? I'm very
glad to know you. Promised Thacker I'd look you up at once. Let's
adjourn to the grill-room."</p>

<p>Minot followed in the wake of the tall breezy one. Already he
liked the man immensely.</p>

<p>"Well," said the stranger, over a table in the grill, "what'll
you have? Waiter? Perhaps you heard I was coming. I happen to be
the owner of the yacht in the harbor, which somebody has
rechristened the <i>Lileth</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I thought so," Minot replied. "I'm mighty glad you've
come. A Mr. Martin Wall is posing as the owner just at
present."</p>

<p>"So I learned from Thacker. Nervy lad, this Wall. I live in
Chicago myself&mdash;left my boat&mdash;Lady Evelyn, I called
her&mdash;in the North River for the winter in charge of a
caretaker. This Wall, it seems, needed a boat for a month and took
a fancy to mine. And since my caretaker was evidently a crook, it
was a simple matter to rent it. Never would have found it out
except for you people. Too busy. Really ought not to have taken
this trip&mdash;business needs me every minute&mdash;but I've got
sort of a hankering to meet Mr. Martin Wall."</p>

<p>"Shall we go out to the boat right away?"</p>

<p>"No need of that. We'll run out in the morning with the proper
authorities." The stranger leaned across the table, and something
in his blue eyes startled Minot. "In the meantime," he said, "I
happen to be interested in another matter. What's all this talk
about George Harrowby coming back to life?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's a chap here," Minot explained, "who claims to be
the elder brother of Allan Harrowby. His cause is in the hands of
an advertising expert named Trimmer."</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw a story in a Washington paper."</p>

<p>"This morning George Harrowby, so-called, confronted Allan
Harrowby and denounced Allan himself as a fraud."</p>

<p>The man from Chicago threw back his head, and a roar of
unexpected laughter smote on Minot's hearing.</p>

<p>"Good joke," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"No joke at all. George was right&mdash;at least, so it seems.
Allan Harrowby cleared out this evening."</p>

<p>"Yes. So I was told by the clerk in there. Do you happen to
know&mdash;er&mdash;Allan?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Very well indeed."</p>

<p>"But you don't know the reason he left?"</p>

<p>"Why," answered Minot, "I suppose because George Harrowby gave
him twenty-four hours to get out of town."</p>

<p>Again the Chicago man laughed.</p>

<p>"That can't have been the reason," he said. "I happen to
know."</p>

<p>"Just how," inquired Minot, "do you happen to know?"</p>

<p>Leaning far back in his chair, the westerner smiled at Minot
with a broad engaging smile.</p>

<p>"I fancy I neglected to introduce myself," he said. "I make
automobiles in Chicago&mdash;and my name's George Harrowby."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;" Minot's head went round dizzily. "Oh,
no," he said firmly. "I don't believe it."</p>

<p>The other's smile grew even broader.</p>

<p>"Don't blame you a bit, my boy," he said. "Must have been a bit
of a mix-up down here. Then, too, I don't look like an Englishman.
Don't want to. I'm an American now, and I like it."</p>

<p>"You mean you're the real Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean&mdash;take it slowly, Mr. Minot. I'm George,
and if Allan ever gets his eyes on me, I won't have to prove who I
am. He'll know, the kid will. But by the way&mdash;what I want now
is to meet this chap who claims to be me&mdash;also his friend, Mr.
Trimmer."</p>

<p>"Of course you do. I saw them out in the lobby a minute ago."
Minot rose. "I'll bring them in. But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind. I believe you."</p>

<p>Trimmer and his proposition still adorned the lobby, puffed with
pride and pompousness. Briefly Minot explained that a gentleman in
the grill-room desired to be introduced, and graciously the two
followed after. The Chicago George Harrowby rose as he saw the
group approach his table. Suddenly behind him Minot heard a
voice:</p>

<p>"My God!" And the limp Englishman of the sandwich boards made a
long lean streak toward the door. Minot leaped after him, and
dragged him back.</p>

<p>"Here, Trimmer," he said, "your proposition has chilblains."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" Mr. Trimmer glared about him.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Minot. "Sir&mdash;our leading vaudeville actor
and his manager. Gentlemen&mdash;Mr. George Harrowby, of
Chicago!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, boys," said Mr. Harrowby genially. He indicated a
chair to Mr. Trimmer, but that gentleman stood, his eyes frozen to
the face of his proposition. The Chicago man turned to that same
proposition. "Brace up, Jenkins," he said. "Nobody will hurt
you."</p>

<p>But Jenkins could not brace. He allowed Minot to deposit his
limp body in a chair.</p>

<p>"I thought you was dead, sir," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"A common mistake," smiled George Harrowby. "My family has
thought the same, and I've been too busy making automobiles to tell
them differently. Mr. Trimmer, will you have a&mdash;what's the
matter, man?"</p>

<p>For Mr. Trimmer was standing, purple, over his proposition.</p>

<p>"I want to get this straight," he said with assumed calm. "See
here, you cringing cur&mdash;what does this mean?"</p>

<p>"I thought he was dead," murmured poor Jenkins in terror.</p>

<p>"You'll think the same about yourself in a minute&mdash;and
you'll be <i>right</i>," Trimmer predicted.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said George Harrowby pacifically. "Sit down, Mr.
Trimmer. Sit down and have a drink. Do you mean to say you didn't
know Jenkins here was faking?"</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't," said Trimmer. He sat down on the extreme
edge of a chair, as one who proposed to rise soon. "All this has
got me going. I never went round in royal circles before, and I'm
dizzy. I suppose you're the real Lord Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"To be quite correct, I am. Don't you believe it?"</p>

<p>"I can believe anything&mdash;when I look at him," said Trimmer,
indicating the pitiable ex-claimant to the title. "Say, who is this
Jenkins we hear so much about?"</p>

<p>"Jenkins was the son of my father's valet," George Harrowby
explained. "He came to America with me. We parted suddenly on a
ranch in southern Arizona."</p>

<p>"Everybody said you was dead," persisted Jenkins, as one who
could not lose sight of that fact.</p>

<p>"Yes? And they gave you my letters and belongings, eh? So you
thought you'd pose as me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," confessed Jenkins humbly.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer slid farther back into his chair.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's unbelievable, but Henry Trimmer has been
buncoed. I met this able liar in a boarding-house in New York, and
he convinced me he was Lord Harrowby. It was between jobs for me,
and I had a bright idea. If I brought this guy down to the wedding,
established him as the real lord, and raised Cain generally, I
figured my stock as a publicity man would rise a hundred per cent.
I'd be turning down fifty-thousand-dollar jobs right and left. I
suppose I was easy, but I'd never mixed up with such things before,
and all the dope he had impressed me&mdash;the family coat of arms,
and the motto&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chicago man laughed softly.</p>

<p>"<i>Credo Harrowby</i>," he said.</p>

<p>"That was it&mdash;trust Harrowby," said Trimmer bitterly.
"Lord, what a fool I've been. And it's ruined my career. I'll be
the laughing-stock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cheer up, Mr. Trimmer," smiled George Harrowby. "I'm sure
you're unduly pessimistic about your career. I'll have something to
say to you on that score later. For the present&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the present," broke in Trimmer with fervor, "iron bars for
Jenkins here. I'll swear out the warrant myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Harrowby, "Jenkins is the most harmless
creature in the world. Led astray by ambition, that's all. With any
one but Allan his claims wouldn't have lasted five minutes. Poor
Allan always was a helpless youngster."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Jenkins," broke in Minot suddenly. "What was the idea
this morning? I mean your calling Allan Harrowby an impostor?"</p>

<p>Jenkins hung his head.</p>

<p>"I was rattled," he admitted. "I couldn't keep it up before all
those people. So it came to me in a flash&mdash;if I said Allan was
a fraud maybe I wouldn't have to be cross-examined myself."</p>

<p>"And that was really Allan Harrowby?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that was Allan, right enough."</p>

<p>Mr. Minot sat studying the wall in front of him. He was
recalling a walk through the moonlight to the fort. Jephson and
Thacker pointed accusing fingers at him over the oceans and lands
between.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;let Jenkins go," continued the genial western
Harrowby, "provided he returns my property and clears out for good.
After all, his father was a faithful servant, if he is not."</p>

<p>"But," objected Trimmer, "he's wasted my time. He's put a crimp
in the career of the best publicity man in America it'll take years
to straighten out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," said Harrowby. "I was coming to that. I've
been watching your work for the last week, and I like it. It's
alive&mdash;progressive. We're putting out a new car this spring
&mdash;an inexpensive little car bound to make a hit. I need a man
like you to convince the public&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer's eyes opened wide. They shone. He turned and
regarded the unhappy Jenkins.</p>

<p>"Clear out," he commanded. "If I ever see you again I'll wring
your neck. Now, Mr. Harrowby, you were saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," said Harrowby. "This man has certain letters
and papers of mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't," Trimmer replied. "I got 'em. Right here in my
pocket." He slid a packet of papers across the table. "They're
yours. Now, about&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jenkins was slipping silently away. Like a frightened wraith he
flitted gratefully through the swinging doors.</p>

<p>"A middle-class car," explained Harrowby, "and I want a live man
to boost it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," interrupted Minot, rising, "I'll say good night.
We'll get together about that other matter in the morning. By the
way, Mr. Harrowby, have you any idea what has become of Allan?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. I sent him a telegram this afternoon saying that
I was on my way here. Must' have run off on business. Of course,
he'll be back for his wedding."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;of course," Minot agreed sadly, "he'll be back
for his wedding. Good night, gentlemen."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he stood at the window of 389, gazing out at
the narrow street, at the stately Manhattan Club, and the old
Spanish houses on either side.</p>

<p>"And she refused me!" he muttered. "To think that should be the
biggest piece of luck that's come to me since I hit this accursed
town!"</p>

<p>He continued to gaze gloomily out&mdash;moon was still
shining.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">18. &mdash;A ROTTEN BAD FIT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MINOT rose early on Monday morning and went for a
walk along the beach. He had awakened to black despair, but the sun
and the matutinal breeze elevated his spirits considerably. Where
was Allan Harrowby? Gone, with his wedding little more than
twenty-four hours away. If he should not return&mdash;golden
thought. By his own act he would forfeit his claim on Jephson, and
Minot would be free to&mdash;</p>

<p>To what? Before him in the morning glow the great gray fort rose
to crush his hopes. There on those slanting ramparts she had smiled
at his declaration. Smiled, and labeled him foolish. Well, foolish
he must have seemed. But there was still hope. If only Allan
Harrowby did not return.</p>

<p>Mr. Trimmer, his head down, breathing hard, marched along the
beach like a man with a destination. Seeing Minot, he stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said, holding out his hand, with a smile. "No
reason why we shouldn't be friends, eh? None whatever. You're out
early. So am I. Thinking up ideas for the automobile campaign."</p>

<p>Minot laughed.</p>

<p>"You leap from one proposition to another with wonderful
aplomb," he said.</p>

<p>"The agile mountain goat hopping from peak to peak," Trimmer
replied. "That's me. Oh, I'm the goat all right. Sad old Jenkins
put it all over me, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he did. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Ask of the railway folder. He lit out in the night.
Say&mdash;he did have a convincing way with him&mdash;you know
it."</p>

<p>"He surely did."</p>

<p>"Well, the best of us make mistakes," admitted Mr. Trimmer. "The
trouble with me is I'm too enthusiastic. Once I get an idea, I see
rosy for miles ahead. As I look back I realize that I actually
helped Jenkins prove to me that he was Lord Harrowby. I was so
anxious for him to do it&mdash;the chance seemed so gorgeous. And
if I'd put it over&mdash;but there. The automobile business looks
mighty good to me now. Watch the papers for details. And when you
get back to Broadway, keep a lookout for the hand of Trimmer
writing in fire on the sky."</p>

<p>"I will," promised Minot, laughing. He turned back to the hotel
shortly after. His meeting with Trimmer had cheered him mightily.
With a hopeful eye worthy of Trimmer himself, he looked toward the
future. Twenty-four hours would decide it. If only Allan failed to
return!</p>

<p>The first man Minot saw when he entered the lobby of the De la
Pax was Allan Harrowby, his eyes tired with travel, handing over a
suit-case to an eager black boy.</p>

<p>What was the use? Listlessly Minot relinquished his last hope.
He followed Harrowby, and touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said drearily. "You gave us all quite a turn
last night. We thought you'd taken the advice you got in the
morning, and cleared out for good."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly," Harrowby replied. "Come up to the room, old man.
I'll explain there."</p>

<p>"Before we go up," replied Minot, "I want you to get Miss
Meyrick on the phone and tell her you've returned. Yes&mdash;right
away. You see&mdash;last night I rather misunderstood&mdash;I
thought you weren't Allan Harrowby after all&mdash;and I'm afraid I
gave Miss Meyrick a wrong impression."</p>

<p>"By gad&mdash;I should have told her I was going," Harrowby
replied. "But I was so rattled, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went into a booth. His brief talk ended, he and Minot entered
the elevator. Once in his suite, Harrowby dropped wearily into a
chair.</p>

<p>"Confound your stupid trains. I've been traveling for ages. Now,
Minot, I'll tell you what carried me off. Yesterday afternoon I got
a message from my brother George saying he was on his way
here."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Seems he's alive and in business in Chicago. The news excited
me a bit, old boy. I pictured George rushing in here, and the word
spreading that I was not to be the Earl of Raybrook, after all. I'm
frightfully fond of Miss Meyrick, and I want that wedding to take
place to-morrow. Then, too, there's Jephson. Understand
me&mdash;Cynthia is not marrying me for my title. I'd stake my life
on that. But there's the father and Aunt Mary&mdash;and
considering the number of times the old gentleman has forbidden the
wedding already&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You saw it was up to you, for once." "Exactly. So for my own
sake&mdash;and Jephson's&mdash;I boarded a train for Jacksonville
with the idea of meeting George's train there and coming on here
with him. I was going to ask George not to make himself known for a
couple of days. Then I proposed to tell Cynthia, and Cynthia only,
of his existence. If she objected, all very well&mdash;but I'm sure
she wouldn't. And I'm sure, too, that George would have done what I
asked&mdash;he always was a bully chap. But&mdash;I missed him.
These confounded trains&mdash;always late. Except when you want
them to be. I dare say George is here by this time?"</p>

<p>"He is," Minot replied. "Came a few hours after you left. And by
the way, I arranged a meeting for him with Trimmer and his
proposition. The proposition fled into the night. It seems he was
the son of an old servant of your father's&mdash;Jenkins by
name."</p>

<p>"Surely! Surely that was Jenkins! I thought I'd seen the chap
somewhere&mdash;couldn't quite recall&mdash;Well, at any rate, he's
out of the way. Now the thing to do is to see good old George at
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went to the telephone, and got his brother's room.</p>

<p>"George!" A surprising note of affection crept into his
lordship's voice. "George, old boy&mdash;this is Allan. I'm waiting
for you in my rooms."</p>

<p>"Dear old chap," said his lordship, turning away from the
telephone. "Twenty-three years since he has seen one of his own
flesh and blood! Twenty-three years of wandering in this
Godforsaken country&mdash;I beg your pardon, Minot. I wonder what
he'll say to me. I wonder what George will say after all those
years."</p>

<p>Nervously Allan Harrowby walked the floor. In a moment the door
opened, and the tall, blond Chicago man stood in the doorway. His
blue eyes glowed. Without a word he came into the room, and gripped
the hand of his brother, then stood gazing as if he would never get
enough.</p>

<p>And then George Harrowby spoke.</p>

<p>"Is that a ready-made suit you have on, Allan?" he asked
huskily.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;yes, George."</p>

<p>"I thought so. It's a rotten bad fit, Allan. A rotten bad
fit."</p>

<p>Thus did George Harrowby greet the first of his kin he had seen
in a quarter of a century. Thus did he give the lie to fiction, and
to Trimmer, writer of "fancy seeing you after all these years"
speeches.</p>

<p>He dropped his younger brother's hand and strode to the window.
He looked out. The courtyard of the De la Pax was strangely misty
even in the morning sunlight. Then he turned, smiling.</p>

<p>"How's the old boy?"he asked.</p>

<p>"He's well, George. Speaks of you&mdash;now and then. Think he'd
like to see you. Why not run over and look him up?"</p>

<p>"I will." George Harrowby turned again to the window. "Ought to
have buried the hatchet long ago. Been so busy&mdash;but I'll
change all that. I'll run over and see him first chance I
get&mdash;and I'll write to him to-day."</p>

<p>"Good. Great to see you again, George. Heard you'd shuffled
off."</p>

<p>"Not much. Alive and well in Chicago. Great to see you."</p>

<p>"Suppose you know about the wedding?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Fine girl, too. Had a waiter point her out to me at
breakfast&mdash;rather rude, but I was in a hurry to see her.
Er&mdash;pretty far gone and all that, Allan?"</p>

<p>"Pretty far gone."</p>

<p>"That's the eye. I was afraid it might be a financial
proposition until I saw the girl."</p>

<p>Allan shifted nervously.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;of course, you're Lord Harrowby," he
said.</p>

<p>George Harrowby threw back his head and laughed his hearty
pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"Sit down, kid," he said. And the scion of nobility, thus
informally addressed, sat.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd come at me with the title," said George
Harrowby, also dropping into a chair. "Don't go, Mr. Minot&mdash;no
secrets here. Allan, you and your wife must come out and see us.
Got a wife myself&mdash;fine girl&mdash;she's from Marion, Indiana.
And I've got two of the liveliest little Americans you ever saw.
Live in a little Chicago suburb&mdash;homey house, shady street,
neighbors all from down country way. Gibson's drawings on the
walls, George Ade's books on the tables, phonograph in the corner
with all of George M. Cohan's songs. Whole family wakes in the
morning ready for a McCutcheon cartoon. My boys talk about nothing
but Cubs and White Sox all summer. They're going to a western
university in a few years. We raised 'em on James Whitcomb Riley's
poems. Well, Allan"</p>

<p>"Well, George"</p>

<p>"Say, what do you imagine would happen if I went back to a home
like that with the news that I was Lord Harrowby, in line to become
the Earl of Raybrook. There'd be a riot. Wife would be startled out
of her wits. Children would hate me. Be an outcast in my own
family. Neighbors would turn up their noses when they went by our
house. Fellows at the club would guy me. Lord Harrowby, eh! Take
off your hats to his ludship, boys. Business would fall off."</p>

<p>Smilingly George Harrowby took a cigar and lighted it.</p>

<p>"No, Allan," he finished, "a lord wouldn't make a hell of a hit
anywhere in America, but in Chicago, in the automobile
business&mdash;say, I'd be as lonesome and deserted as the
reading-room of an Elks' Club."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand "Allan began.</p>

<p>"No," said George, turning to meet Minot's smile, "but this
gentleman does. It all means, Allan, that there's nothing doing.
You are Lord Harrowby, the next Earl of Raybrook. Take the title,
and God bless you."</p>

<p>"But, George," Allan objected, "legally you can't"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Allan," said the man from Chicago, "there's
nothing we can't do in America, and do legally. How's this? I've
always been intending to take out naturalization papers. I'll do it
the minute I get back to Chicago&mdash;and then the title is yours.
In the meantime, when you introduce me to your friends here, we'll
just pretend I've taken them out already."</p>

<p>Allan Harrowby got up and laid his hand affectionately on his
brother's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're a brick, old boy," he said. "You always were. I'm glad
you're to be here for the wedding. How did you happen to come?"</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;you don't know, do you? I came in response
to a telegram from Lloyds, of New York."</p>

<p>"From&mdash;er&mdash;Lloyds?" asked Allan blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Allan. That yacht you came down here on didn't belong to
Martin Wall. It belonged to me. He made away with it from North
River because he happened to need it. Wall's a crook, my boy."</p>

<p>"The <i>Lileth</i> your ship! My word!"</p>

<p>"It is. I called it the Lady Evelyn, Allan. Lloyds found out
that it had been stolen and sent me a wire. So here I am."</p>

<p>"Lloyds found out through me," Minot explained to the dazed
Allan.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I'm beginning to see," said Allan slowly. "By the way,
George, we've another score to settle with Wall."</p>

<p>He explained briefly how Wall had acquired Chain Lightning's
Collar, and returned a duplicate of paste in its place. The elder
Harrowby listened with serious face.</p>

<p>"It's no doubt the Collar he was trailing you for, Allan," he
said. "And that's how he came to need the yacht. But when finally
he got his eager fingers on those diamonds, poor old Wall must have
had the shock of his life."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't Wall who had the duplicate made. It
was&mdash;father&mdash;years ago, when I was still at home. He
wanted money to bet, as usual&mdash;had the duplicate
made&mdash;risked and lost."</p>

<p>"But," Allan objected, "he gave it to me to give to Miss
Meyrick. Surely he wouldn't have done that"</p>

<p>"How old is he now? Eighty-two? Allan, the old boy must be a
little childish by now&mdash;he forgot. I'm sure he forgot. That's
the only view to take of it."</p>

<p>A silence fell. In a moment the elder brother said:</p>

<p>"Allan, I want you to assure me again that you're marrying
because you love the girl&mdash;and for no other reason."</p>

<p>"Straight, George," Allan answered, and looked his brother in
the eye.</p>

<p>"Good kid. There's nothing in the other kind of
marriage&mdash;all unhappiness&mdash;all wrong. I was sure you must
be on the level&mdash;but, you see, after Mr. Thacker&mdash;the
insurance chap in New York&mdash;knew who I was and that I wouldn't
take the title, he told me about that fool policy you took
out."</p>

<p>"No? Did he?"</p>

<p>"All about it. Sort of knocked me silly for a minute. But I
remembered the Harrowby gambling streak&mdash;and if you love the
girl, and really want to marry her, I can't see any harm in the
idea. However, I hope you lose out on the policy. Everything O. K.
now? Nothing in the way?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing," Lord Harrowby replied. "Minot here has been a
bully help&mdash;worked like mad to put the wedding through. I owe
everything to him."</p>

<p>"Insuring a woman's mind," reflected George Harrowby. "Not a bad
idea, Allan. Almost worthy of an American. Still&mdash;I could have
insured you myself after a fashion&mdash;promised you a good job as
manager of our new London branch in case the marriage fell through.
However, your method is more original."</p>

<p>Allan Harrowby was slowly pacing the room. Suddenly he turned,
and despite the fact that all obstacles were removed, he seemed a
very much worried young man.</p>

<p>"George&mdash;Mr. Minot," he began, "I've a confession to make.
It's about that policy." He stopped. "The old family trouble,
George. We're gamblers to the bone&mdash;all of us. Last Friday
night&mdash;at the Manhattan Club&mdash;I turned over that policy
to Martin Wall to hold as security for a five thousand dollar
loan."</p>

<p>"Why the devil did you do that?" Minot cried.</p>

<p>"Well "And Allan Harrowby was in his old state of helplessness
again. "I wanted to save the day. Gonzale was hounding us for
money&mdash;I thought I saw a chance to win"</p>

<p>"But Wall! Wall of all people!"</p>

<p>"I know. I oughtn't to have done it. Knew Wall wasn't altogether
straight. But nobody else was about&mdash;I got
excited&mdash;borrowed&mdash;lost the whole of it, too.
Wha&mdash;what are we going to do?"</p>

<p>He looked appealingly at Minot. But for once it was not on
Minot's shoulders that the responsibility for action fell. George
Harrowby cheerfully took charge.</p>

<p>"I was just on the point of going out to the yacht, with an
officer," he said. "Suppose we three run out alone and talk
business with Martin Wall."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the two Harrowbys and Minot boarded the
yacht which Martin Wall had christened the <i>Lileth</i>. George
Harrowby looked about him with interest.</p>

<p>"He's taken very good care of it&mdash;I'll say that for him,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>Martin Wall came suavely forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wall," said Minot pleasantly, "allow me to present Mr.
George Harrowby, the owner of the boat on which we now stand."</p>

<p>"I beg our pardon," said Wall, without the quiver of an eyelash.
"So careless of me. Don't stand, gentlemen. Have chairs&mdash;all
of you."</p>

<p>And he stared George Harrowby calmly in the eye.</p>

<p>"You're flippant this morning," said the elder Harrowby. "We'll
be glad to sit, thank you. And may I repeat what Mr. Minot has told
you&mdash;I own this yacht."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Mr. Wall's face beamed. "You bought it from Wilson, I
presume."</p>

<p>"Just who is Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;he's the man I rented it from in New York."</p>

<p>"So that's your tale, is it?" Allan Harrowby put in.</p>

<p>"You wound me," protested Mr. Wall. "That is my tale, as you
call it. I rented this boat in New York from a man named Albert
Wilson. I have the lease to show you, also my receipt for one
month's rent."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you have," commented Minot.</p>

<p>"Bet anything you like. You come from a betting institution, I
believe."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Wall, I did not buy the yacht from Wilson," said George
Harrowby. "I've owned it for several years."</p>

<p>"How do I know that?" asked Martin Wall.</p>

<p>"Glance over that," said the elder Harrowby, taking a paper from
his pocket. "A precaution you failed to take with Albert
Wilson."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear." Mr. Wall looked over the paper and handed it back.
"Can it be that Wilson was a fraud? I suggest the police, Mr.
Harrowby. I shall be very glad to testify."</p>

<p>"I suggest the police, too," said Minot hotly, "for Mr. Martin
Wall. If you thought you had a right on this boat, Wall, why did
you throw me overboard into the North River when I mentioned the
name of Lloyds?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wall regarded him with pained surprise.</p>

<p>"I threw you overboard because I didn't want you on my boat," he
said. "I thought you understood that fully."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Minot cried. "You stole this boat by bribing the
caretaker, and when I mentioned Lloyds, famous the world over as a
marine insurance firm, you thought I was after you, and threw me
over the rail. I see it all very clearly now."</p>

<p>"You're a wise young man"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wall," George Harrowby broke in, "it may interest you to
know that we don't believe a word of the Wilson story. But it may
also interest you to know that I am willing to let the whole matter
drop&mdash;on one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"My brother Allan here borrowed five thousand dollars from you
the other night, and gave you as security a bit of paper quite
worthless to any one save himself. Accept my check for five
thousand and hand him back the paper."</p>

<p>Mr. Wall smiled. He reached into his inner coat pocket.</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure," he said. "Here is
the&mdash;er&mdash;the document." He laughed. Then, noting the
check book on the elder Harrowby's knee, he added: "There was a
little matter of interest"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" George Harrowby looked up. "The interest is
forfeited to pay wear and tear on this yacht."</p>

<p>For a moment Wall showed fight, but he did not much care for the
light he saw in the elder Harrowby's eyes. He recognized a vast
difference in brothers.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;very well," he said. The check was written, and the
exchange made.</p>

<p>"Since you are convinced I am the owner of the yacht," said
George Harrowby, rising, "I take it you will leave it at once?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I can remove my belongings," Wall said. "A most
unfortunate affair all round."</p>

<p>"A fortunate one for you," commented Mr. Minot.</p>

<p>Wall glared.</p>

<p>"My boy," he said angrily, "did any one ever tell you you were a
bad-luck jinx?"</p>

<p>"Never," smiled Minot.</p>

<p>"You look like one to me," growled Martin Wall.</p>

<p>George Harrowby arranged to keep the crew Wall had engaged, in
order to get the Lady Evelyn back to New York. It was thought best
for the owner to stay aboard until Wall had gathered his property
and departed, so Allan Harrowby and Minot alone returned to San
Marco. As they crossed the plaza Allan said:</p>

<p>"By gad&mdash;everything looks lovely now. Jenkins out of the
way, good old George side-stepping the title, the policy safe in my
pocket. Not a thing in the way!"</p>

<p>"It's almost too good to be true," replied Minot, with a very
mirthless smile.</p>

<p>"It must be a great relief to you, old boy. You have worked
hard. Must feel perfectly jolly over all this?"</p>

<p>"Me?" said Minot. "Oh, I can hardly contain myself for joy. I
feel like twining orange blossoms in my hair"</p>

<p>He walked on, kicking the gravel savagely at each step. Not a
thing in the way now. Not a single, solitary, hopeful, little
thing.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">19. &mdash;MR. MINOT GOES THROUGH
FIRE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Duchess of Lismore elected to give her dinner
and dance in Miss Meyrick's honor as near to the bright Florida
stars as she could. On the top floor of the De la Pax was a private
dining-room, only partially enclosed, with a picturesque view of
the palm-dotted courtyard below. Adjacent to this was a sun-room
with a removable glass roof, and this the duchess had ordered
transformed into a ballroom. There in the open the newest society
dances should rise to offend the soft southern sky.</p>

<p>Being a good general, the hostess was early on the scene,
marshaling her forces. To her there came Cynthia Meyrick, radiant
and lovely and wide-eyed on the eve of her wedding.</p>

<p>"How sweet you look, Cynthia," said the duchess graciously. "But
then, you long ago solved the problem of what becomes you."</p>

<p>"I have to look as sweet as I can," replied the girl wearily.
"All the rest of my life I shall have to try and live up to the
nobility."</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"To think," remarked the duchess, busy over a great bowl of
flowers, "that to-morrow night this time little Cynthia will be
Lady Harrowby. I suppose you'll go to Rakedale Hall for part of the
year at least?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I, too, have had my Rakedale Hall. Formal, Cynthia dear,
formal. Nothing but silly little hunts, silly little
shoots&mdash;American men would die there. As for American
women&mdash;nothing ever happens&mdash;the hedges bloom in neat
little rows&mdash;the trees blossom&mdash;they're bare
again&mdash;Cynthia, sometimes I've been in a state where I'd give
ten years of my life just to hear the rattle of an elevated
train!"</p>

<p>She stood looking down at the girl, an all too evident pity in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"It isn't all it might be, I fancy&mdash;marrying into the
peerage," Cynthia said.</p>

<p>"My dear," replied the duchess, "I've nearly died at times. I
never was exactly what you'd call a patriot, but&mdash;often I've
waked in the night and thought of Detroit. My little car rattling
over the cobblestones&mdash;a new gown tried on at Madame
Harbier's&mdash;a matinee&mdash;and chocolate afterward at that
little place&mdash;you remember it. And our house on Woodward
Avenue&mdash;the good times there. On the veranda in the evening,
and Jack Little just back from college in the east running across
the lawns to see me. What became of Jack, dear?"</p>

<p>"He married Elise Perkins."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I know&mdash;and they live near our old
house&mdash;have a box when the opera comes&mdash;entertain the
Yale glee club every Christmas&mdash;oh, Cynthia, maybe it's crude,
maybe it's middle-class in English eyes&mdash;but it's home! When
you introduced that brother of Lord Harrowby's this
afternoon&mdash;that big splendid chap who said America looked
better than a title to him&mdash;I could have thrown my arms about
his neck and kissed him!" She came closer to the girl, and stood
looking down at her with infinite tenderness in her washed-out
eyes. "Wasn't there&mdash;any American boy, my dear?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;hundreds of them," answered Cynthia Meyrick,
trying to laugh.</p>

<p>The duchess turned away.</p>

<p>"It's wrong of me to discourage you like that," she said.
"Marrying into the peerage is something, after all. You must come
home every year&mdash;insist on it. Johnson&mdash;are these the
best caviar bowls the hotel can furnish?"</p>

<p>And the Duchess of Lismore, late of Detroit, drifted off into a
bitter argument with the humble Johnson.</p>

<p>Miss Meyrick strolled away, out upon a little balcony opening
off the dining-room. She stood gazing down at the waving fronds in
the courtyard six stories below. If only that fountain down there
were Ponce de Leon's! But it wasn't. To-morrow she must put youth
behind. She must go far from the country she loved&mdash;did she
care enough for that? Strangely enough, burning tears filled her
eyes. Hot revolt surged into her heart. She stood looking down</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other members of the dinner-party were gathering
with tender solicitude about their hostess in the ballroom beyond.
Dick Minot, hopeless, glum, stalked moodily among them. Into the
crowd drifted Jack Paddock, his sprightly air noticeably lacking,
his eyes worried, dreadful.</p>

<p>"For the love of heaven," Minot asked, as they stepped together
into a secluded corner, "what ails you?"</p>

<p>"Be gentle with me, boy," said Paddock unhappily. "I'm in a
horrible mess. The graft, Dick&mdash;the good old graft. It's over
and done with now."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It happened last night after our wild chase of Harrowby&mdash;I
was fussed&mdash;excited I prepared two sets of repartee for my two
customers to use to-night"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I always make carbon copies to refer to myself just before the
stuff is to be used. A few minutes ago I took out my copies. Dick!
I sent the same repartee to both of them!"</p>

<p>"Good lord!"</p>

<p>"Good lord is meek and futile. So is damn. Put on your little
rubber coat, my boy. I predict a hurricane."</p>

<p>In spite of his own troubles, Minot laughed.</p>

<p>"Mirth, eh?" said Paddock grimly. "I can't see it that way. I'll
be as popular as a Republican in Texas before this evening is over.
Got a couple of hasty rapid-fire resignations all ready. Thought at
first I wouldn't come&mdash;but that seemed cowardly. Anyway, this
is my last appearance on any stage as a librettist. Kindly omit
flowers."</p>

<p>And Mr. Paddock drifted gloomily away.</p>

<p>While the servants were passing cocktails on gleaming trays,
Minot found the door to the balcony and stepped outside. A white
wraith flitted from the shadows to his side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot," said a soft, scared little voice.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;Miss Meyrick," he cried.</p>

<p>Merciful fate this, that they met for the first time since that
incident on the ramparts in kindly darkness.</p>

<p>"Miss Meyrick," began Minot hurriedly, "I'm very glad to have a
moment alone with you. I want to apologize&mdash;for last
night&mdash;I was mad&mdash;I did Harrowby a very palpable wrong.
I'm very ashamed of myself as I look back. Can I hope that you
will&mdash;forget&mdash;all I said?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, but stood looking down at the palms far
below.</p>

<p>"Can I hope that you will forget&mdash;and forgive?"</p>

<p>She glanced up at him, and her eyes shone in the dusk.</p>

<p>"I can forgive," she said softly. "But I can't forget.
Mr.&mdash;Mr. Minot"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;is&mdash;woman's greatest privilege?"</p>

<p>Something in the tone of her voice sent a cold chill sweeping
through Minot's very soul. He clutched the rail for support.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if you'd answer," said the girl, "it would make it
easier for"</p>

<p>Aunt Mary's generous form appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, Cynthia! You are keeping the duchess' dinner
waiting."</p>

<p>Cynthia Meyrick joined her aunt. Minot stayed behind a moment.
Below him Florida swam in the azure night. What had the girl been
about to say?</p>

<p>Pulling himself together, he went inside and learned that he was
to take in to dinner a glorious blond bridesmaid. When they were
seated, he found that Miss Meyrick's face was hidden from him by a
profusion of Florida blossoms. He was glad of that. He wanted to
think&mdash;think.</p>

<p>'A few others were thinking at that table, Mrs. Bruce and the
duchess among them. Mrs. Bruce was mentally rehearsing. The duchess
glanced at her.</p>

<p>"The wittiest woman in San Marco," thought the hostess.
"Bah!"</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock, meanwhile, was toying unhappily with his food. He
had little to say. The attractive young lady he had taken in had
already classified him as a bore. Most unjust of the attractive
young lady.</p>

<p>"It's lamentable, really." Mrs. Bruce was speaking. "Even in our
best society conversation has given way to the turkey trot. Our
wits are in our feet. Where once people talked art, music,
literature&mdash;now they tango madly. It really seems&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything you say is true," interrupted the duchess blandly.
"I sometimes think the race of the future will be&mdash;a trotting
race."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce started perceptibly. Her eyes lighted with fire. She
had been working up to this line herself, and the coincidence was
passing strange. She glared at the hostess. Mr. Paddock studied his
plate intently.</p>

<p>"I for one," went on the Duchess of Lismore, "do not dance the
tango or the turkey trot. Nor am I willing to take the necessary
steps to learn them."</p>

<p>A little ripple ran round the table&mdash;the ripple that up to
now had been the exclusive privilege of Mrs. Bruce. That lady paled
visibly. She realized that there was no coincidence here.</p>

<p>"It seems too bad, too," she said, fixing the hostess firmly
with an angry eye. "Because women could have the world at their
feet&mdash;if they'd only keep their feet still long enough."</p>

<p>It was the turn of the duchess to start, and start she did. As
one who could not believe her ears, she stared at Mrs. Bruce. The
"wittiest hostess in San Marco" was militantly under way.</p>

<p>"Women are not what they used to be," she continued. "Either
they are mad about clothes, or they go to the other extreme and
harbor strange ideas about the vote, eugenics, what not. In fact,
the sex reminds me of the type of shop that abounds in a small
town&mdash;its specialty is drygoods and notions."</p>

<p>The duchess pushed away a plate which had only that moment been
set before her. She regarded Mrs. Bruce with the eye of Mrs.
Pankhurst face to face with a prime minister.</p>

<p>"We are hardly kind to our sex," she said, "but I must say I
agree with you. And the extravagance of women! Half the women of my
acquaintance wear gorgeous rings on their fingers&mdash;while
their husbands wear blue rings about their eyes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brace's face was livid.</p>

<p>"Madam!" she said through her teeth".</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the duchess sweetly.</p>

<p>They sat glaring at each other. Then with one accord they
turned&mdash;to glare at Mr. Jack Paddock.</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock, prince of assurance, was blushing furiously. He
stood the combined glare as long as he could&mdash;then he looked
up into the night.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how close the stars seem," he murmured faintly.</p>

<p>It was noted afterward that Mrs. Bruce maintained a vivid
silence during the remainder of that dinner. The duchess, on the
contrary, wrung from her purchased lines every possibility they
held.</p>

<p>And in that embattled setting Mr. Minot sat, deaf to the
delicious lisp of the debutante at his side. What was woman's
greatest privilege? Wasn't it</p>

<p>His forehead grew damp. His knees trembled beneath the table.
"Jephson&mdash;Thacker, Jephson&mdash;Thacker," he said over and
over to himself.</p>

<p>After dinner, when the added guests invited by the duchess for
the dance crowded the ballroom, Minot encountered Jack Paddock. Mr.
Paddock was limp and pitiable.</p>

<p>"Ever apologize to an angry woman?" he asked. "Ever try to
expostulate with a storm at sea? I've had it out with Mrs.
Bruce&mdash;offered to do anything to atone&mdash;she said the best
thing I could do would be to disappear from San Marco. She's right.
I'm going. This is my exit from the butterfly life. And I don't
intend to say good-by to the duchess, either."</p>

<p>"I wish I could go with you," said Minot sadly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;come along."</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;I'll stick it out. See you later."</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock slipped unostentatiously away in the direction of
the elevator. On a dais hidden by palms the orchestra began to play
softly.</p>

<p>"You haven't asked to see my card," said Cynthia Meyrick at
Minot's side.</p>

<p>He smiled a wan smile, and wrote his name opposite number five.
She drifted away. The music became louder, rising to the bright
stars themselves. The dances that had furnished so much bitter
conversation at table began to break out. Minot hunted up the
balcony and stood gazing miserably down at fairy-land below.</p>

<p>There Miss Meyrick found him when the fifth dance was
imminent.</p>

<p>"Is it customary for girls to pursue their partners?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said weakly. "Shall we go in?"</p>

<p>"It's so&mdash;so glorious out here."</p>

<p>He sighed&mdash;a sigh of resignation. He turned to her.</p>

<p>"You asked me&mdash;what is woman's greatest privilege," he
said. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;to change her mind?" She looked timidly into his
eyes. "It&mdash;is," she whispered faintly. The most miserably
happy man in history, he gasped.</p>

<p>"Cynthia! It's too late&mdash;you're to be married to-morrow. Do
you mean&mdash;you'd call it all off now&mdash;at the last
minute?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head, her eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>"My God!" he moaned, and turned away.</p>

<p>"It would be all wrong&mdash;to marry Harrowby," she said
faintly. "Because I've come to&mdash;I&mdash;oh, Dick, can't you
see?"</p>

<p>"See! Of course I see!" He clenched his fists. "Cynthia, my
dearest"</p>

<p>Below him stretched six stories of open space. In his agony he
thought of leaping over the rail&mdash;of letting that be his
answer. But no&mdash;it would disarrange things so&mdash;it might
even postpone the wedding!</p>

<p>"Cynthia," he groaned, "you can't understand. It mustn't
be&mdash;I've given my word. I can't explain. I can never explain.
But&mdash;Cynthia&mdash;Cynthia"</p>

<p>Back in the shadow the girl pressed her hands to her burning
cheeks.</p>

<p>"A strange love&mdash;yours," she said. "A love that blows hot
and cold."</p>

<p>"Cynthia&mdash;that isn't true&mdash;I do love you"</p>

<p>"Please! Please let us&mdash;forget." She stepped into the
moonlight, fine, brave, smiling. "Do we&mdash;dance?"</p>

<p>"Cynthia!" he cried unhappily. "If you only understood."</p>

<p>"I think I do. The music has stopped. Harrowby has the next
dance&mdash;he'd hardly think of looking for me here."</p>

<p>She was gone! Minot stood alone on the balcony. He was dazed,
blind, trembling. He had refused the girl without whom life could
never be worth while! Refused her, to keep the faith!</p>

<p>He entered upon the bright scene inside, slipped unnoticed to
the elevator and, still dazed, descended to the lobby. He would
walk in the moonlight until his senses were regained. Near the main
door of the De la Pax he ran into Henry Trimmer. Mr. Trimmer had a
newspaper in his hand.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the women nowadays?" he demanded
indignantly. Minot tried in vain to push by him. "Seen what those
London suffragettes have done now?" And Trimmer pointed to a
head-line.</p>

<p>"What have they done?" asked Minot.</p>

<p>"Done? They put dynamite under the statue of Lord Nelson in
Trafalgar Square and blew it sky-high. It fell over into the
Strand"</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Minot wildly. "Good! I hope to hell it smashed the
whole of London!" And, brushing aside the startled Trimmer, he went
out into the night.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o'clock when Mr. Minot, somewhat calmer of
mind, returned to the De la Pax. As he stepped into the courtyard
he was surprised to see a crowd gathered before the hotel. Then he
noticed that from a second-floor window poured smoke and flame, and
that the town fire department was wildly getting into action.</p>

<p>He stopped&mdash;his heart almost ceased beating. That was her
window! The window to which he had called her on that night that
seemed so far away&mdash;last night! Breathlessly he ran
forward.</p>

<p>And he ran straight into a group just descended from the
ballroom. Of that group Cynthia Meyrick was a member. For a moment
they stood gazing at each other. Then the girl turned to her
aunt.</p>

<p>"My wedding dress!" she cried. "I left it lying on my bed. Oh, I
can't possibly be married to-morrow if that is burned!"</p>

<p>There was a challenge in that last sentence, and the young man
for whom it was intended did not miss it. Mad with the injustice of
life, he swooped down on a fireman struggling with a wabbly ladder.
Snatching away the ladder, he placed it against the window from
which the smoke and flame poured. He ran up it.</p>

<p>"Here!" shouted the chief of the fire department, laying angry
hands on the ladder's base. "Wot you doing? You can't go in
there."</p>

<p>"Why the devil can't I?" bellowed Minot. "Let go of that
ladder!"</p>

<p>He plunged into the room. The smoke filled his nostrils and
choked him. His eyes burned. He staggered through the smoky dusk
into another room. His hands met the brass bars of a bed&mdash;then
closed over something soft and filmy that lay upon it. He seized
the something close, and hurried back into the other room.</p>

<p>A fireman at another window sought to turn a stream of water on
him. Water&mdash;on that gown!</p>

<p>"Cut that out, you fool!" Minot shouted. The fireman, who had
suspected himself of saving a human life, looked hurt. Minot
regained his window. Disheveled, smoky, but victorious, he half
fell, half climbed, to the ground. The fire chief faced him.</p>

<p>"Who was you trying to rescue?" the chief demanded. His eyes
grew wide. "You idiot," he roared, "they ain't nobody in that
dress."</p>

<p>"Damn it, I know that," Minot cried.</p>

<p>He ran across the lawn and stood, a panting, limp, battered,
ludicrous figure before Cynthia Meyrick.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope it's the right one," he said, and held out the
gown.</p>

<br>

<p>She took his offering, and came very close to him.</p>

<p>"I hate you!" she said in a low tone. "I hate you!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was afraid you would," he muttered.</p>

<p>A shout from the firemen announced that the blaze was under
control. To his dismay, Minot saw that an admiring crowd was
surrounding him. He broke away and hurried to his room.</p>

<p>Cynthia Meyrick's final words to him rang in his ears. Savagely
he tore at his ruined collar.</p>

<p>Was this ridiculous farce never to end?</p>

<p>As if in answer, a distant clock struck twelve. He
shuddered.</p>

<p>To-morrow, at high noon!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20">20. &mdash;"PLEASE KILL"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">EARLY Tuesday morning, while Mr. Minot still slept
and mercifully forgot, two very wide awake gentlemen sat alone
together in the office of the <i>San Marco Mail</i>. One was Manuel
Gonzale, proprietor of that paper, as immaculate as the morn; the
other was that broad and breezy gentleman known in his present
incarnation as Mr. Martin Wall.</p>

<p>"Very neat. Very neat indeed," said Mr. Wall, gazing with
evident approval at an inky smelling sheet that lay before him. "It
ought to do the work. If it does, it will be the first stroke of
luck I've had in San Marco."</p>

<p>Gonzale smiled, revealing two even rows of very white teeth.</p>

<p>"You do not like San Marco?" he ventured.</p>

<p>Mr. Wall snorted angrily.</p>

<p>"Like it? Does a beheaded man like the ax? In a long and golden
professional career, I've never struck anything like this town
before for hard luck. I'm not in it twenty-four hours when I'm left
alone, my hands tied, with stuff enough to make your eyes pop out
of your head. That's pleasant! Then, after spending two months and
a lot of money trailing Lord Harrowby for the family jools, I
finally cop them. I give the crew of my borrowed boat orders to
steam far, far away, and run to my cabin to gloat. Do I gloat? Ask
me. I do not gloat. I find the famous Chain Lightning's Collar is a
very superior collection of glass, worth about twenty-three cents.
I send back the glass, and stick around, hoping for better days.
And the best I get is a call from the owner of my yacht, with
orders to vacate at once. When I first came here I swore I'd visit
that jewelry store again&mdash;alone. But&mdash;there's a jinx
after me in this town. What's the use? I'm going to get out."</p>

<p>"But before you go," smiled Manuel, "one stroke of luck you
shall have."</p>

<p>"Maybe. I leave that to you. This kind of thing"&mdash;he
motioned toward the damp paper&mdash;"is not in my line." He bent
over a picture on the front page. "That cut came out pretty well,
didn't it? Lucky we got the photograph before big brother George
arrived."</p>

<p>"I have always found San Marco lucky," replied Gonzale.
"Always&mdash;with one trifling exception." He drummed
reminiscently on his desk.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;who's this?" Mr. Wall pointed to a line just
beneath the name of the paper. "Robert O'Neill, Editor and
Proprietor," he read.</p>

<p>Manuel Gonzale gurgled softly somewhere within, which was his
cunning, non-committal way of indicating mirth.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;my very virtuous managing editor," he said. "One of
those dogs who dealt so vilely with me&mdash;I have told you of
that. Manuel Gonzale does not forget." He leaned closer. "This
morning at two, after O'Neill and Howe had sent to-day's paper to
press as usual, Luypas, my circulation manager, and I arrived. My
virtuous editors had departed to their rest. Luypas and I stopped
the presses, we substituted a new first-page form. O'Neill and
Howe&mdash;they will not know. Always they sleep until noon. In
this balmly climate, it is easy to lie abed."</p>

<p>Again Manuel Gonzale gurgled.</p>

<p>"May their sleep be dreamless," he said. "And should our work of
the morning fail, may the name of O'Neill be the first to concern
the police."</p>

<p>Wall laughed.</p>

<p>"A good idea," he remarked. He looked at his watch.
"Nine-fifteen. The banks ought to be open now."</p>

<p>Gonzale got to his feet. Carefully he folded the page that had
been lying on his desk.</p>

<p>"The moment for action has come," he said. "Shall we go down to
the street?"</p>

<p>"I'm in strange waters," responded Martin Wall uneasily. "The
first dip I've ever taken out of my line. Don't believe in it
either&mdash;a man should have his specialty and stick to it.
However, I need the money. Am I letter perfect in my part, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>The door of the <i>Mail</i> office opened, and a sly little
Cuban with an evil face stepped in.</p>

<p>"Ah, Luypas," Gonzale said, "you are here at last? Do you
understand? Your boys they are to be in the next room&mdash;yes?
You are to sit near that telephone. At a word from my friend, Mr.
Martin Wall, to-day's edition of the <i>Mail</i> is to flood the
streets&mdash;the news-stands. Instantly. Delay might be fatal. Is
that clear?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Luypas.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Gonzale. He turned to Martin Wall. "Now is the
time," he added.</p>

<p>The two descended to the street. Opposite the Hotel de la Pax
they parted. The sleek little Spaniard went on alone and mounted
boldly those pretentious steps. At the desk he informed the clerk
on duty that he must see Mr. Spencer Meyrick at once.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Meyrick is very busy to-day," the clerk objected.</p>

<p>"Say this is&mdash;life and death," replied Gonzale, and the
clerk, wilting, telephoned the millionaire's apartments.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour Gonzale was kept waiting. Nervously he paced
the lobby, consuming one cigarette after another, glancing often at
his watch. Finally Spencer Meyrick appeared, pompous, red-faced, a
hard man to handle, as he always had been. The Spaniard noted this,
and his slits of eyes grew even narrower.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?" he asked suavely. "It is most
important."</p>

<p>He led the way to a summer-house in a far forgotten corner of
the hotel grounds. Protesting, Spencer Meyrick followed. The two
sat down.</p>

<p>"I have something to show you," said Gonzale politely, and
removed from his pocket a copy of the <i>San Marco Mail</i>, still
damp from the presses.</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick took the paper in his own large capable hands.
He glanced casually at the first page, and his face grew somewhat
redder than its wont. A huge headline was responsible:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">HARROWBY WASN'T TAKING ANY CHANCES.</p>
<br>

<p>Underneath, in slightly smaller type, Spencer Meyrick read:</p>
<br>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">Remarkable Foresight Of
English Fortune<br>
Hunter Who Weds Miss Meyrick To-day<br>
Took Out A Policy For Seventy-five<br>
Thousand Pounds With Lloyds.<br>
Same To Be Payable in Case The<br>
Beautiful Heiress Suffered<br>
A Change Of Heart</p>
<br>

<p>Prominent on the page was a large photograph, which purported to
be "An Exact Facsimile of the Policy." Mr. Meyrick examined it. He
glanced through the story, which happened to be commendably brief.
He told himself he must remain calm, avoid fireworks, think
quickly. Laying the paper on his knee, he turned to the little
white-garbed man beside him.</p>

<p>"What trick is this?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"It is no trick, sir," said Gonzale pleasantly. "It is the
truth. That is a photograph of the policy."</p>

<p>Old Meyrick studied the cut again.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to annoy," Gonzale went on. "But&mdash;there
are five thousand copies of to-day's <i>Mail</i> at the office
ready to be distributed at a signal from me. Think, sir! Newsboys
on the street with that story at the very moment when your daughter
becomes Lady Harrowby."</p>

<p>"I see," said Meyrick slowly. "Blackmail."</p>

<p>Manuel Gonzale shuddered in horror.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg of you," he protested. "That is hardly it. A business
proposition, I should call it. It happens that the men back of the
Star Publishing Company, which issues the <i>Mail</i>, have grown
tired of the newspaper game in San Marco. They are desirous of
closing out the plant at once&mdash;say this morning. It occurs to
them that you might be very glad to purchase the
<i>Mail</i>&mdash;before the next edition goes on the street."</p>

<p>"You're a clever little dog," said Meyrick, through his
teeth.</p>

<p>"You are not exactly complimentary. However&mdash;let us say for
the argument&mdash;you buy the <i>Mail</i> at once. I am, by the
way, empowered to make the sale. You take charge. You hurry to the
office. You destroy all copies of to-day's issue so far printed.
You give orders to the composing-room to kill this first-page
story&mdash;good as it is. 'Please kill,' you say. A term with
newspaper men."</p>

<p>"You call yourself a newspaper man?"</p>

<p>"Why not? The story is killed. Another is put in its
place&mdash;say, for example, an elaborate account of your
daughter's wedding. And in its changed form the
<i>Mail</i>&mdash;your newspaper&mdash;goes on the street."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;and your price?"</p>

<p>"It is a valuable property."</p>

<p>"Especially valuable this morning, I take it," sneered
Meyrick.</p>

<p>"Valuable at any time. Our presses cost a thousand. Our
linotypes two thousand. And there is that other thing&mdash;so hard
to estimate definitely&mdash;the wide appeal of our paper. The
price&mdash;well&mdash;fifteen thousand dollars. Extremely
reasonable. And I will include&mdash;the good will of the retiring
management."</p>

<p>"You contemptible little&mdash;" began Spencer Meyrick.</p>

<p>"My dear sir&mdash;control yourself," pleaded Gonzale. "Or I may
be unable to include the good-will I spoke of. Would you care to
see that story on the streets? You may at any moment. There is but
one way out. Buy the newspaper. Buy it now. Here is the
plan&mdash;you go with me to your bank. You procure fifteen
thousand in cash. We go together to the <i>Mail</i> office. You pay
me the money and I leave you in charge."</p>

<p>Old Meyrick leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Very good," he cried. "Come on."</p>

<p>"One thing more," continued the crafty Gonzale. "It may pay you
to note&mdash;we are watched. Even now. All the way to the bank and
thence to the office of the <i>Mail</i>&mdash;we will be watched.
Should any accident, now unforeseen, happen to me, that issue of
the <i>Mail</i> will go on sale in five minutes all over San
Marco."</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick stood glaring down at the little man in white.
His enthusiasm of a moment ago for the journey vanished. However,
the head-lines of the <i>Mail</i> were staring up at him from the
bench. He stooped, pocketed the paper, and growled:</p>

<p>"I understand. Come on!"</p>

<p>There must be some escape. The trap seemed absurdly simple.
Across the hotel lawn, down the hot avenue, in the less hot plaza,
Meyrick sought a way. A naturally impulsive man, he had difficulty
restraining himself. But he thought of his daughter, whose
happiness was more than money in his eyes.</p>

<p>No way offered. At the counter of the tiny bank Meyrick stood
writing his check, Gonzale at his elbow. Suddenly behind them the
screen door slammed, and a wild-eyed man with flaming red hair
rushed in.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" Gonzale screamed.</p>

<p>"Out of my way, Don Quixote," cried the red-topped one. "I'm a
windmill and my arms breathe death. Are you Mr. Meyrick? Well, tear
up that check!"</p>

<p>"Gladly," said Meyrick. "Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Notice the cat-birds down here?" went on the wild one. "Noisy
little beasts, aren't they? Well, after this take off your hat to
'em. A catbird saved you a lot of money this morning."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't follow&mdash;" said the dazed Spencer
Meyrick.</p>

<p>"No? I'll explain. I have been working on this man's paper for
the last week. So has a very good friend of mine. We knew he was
crooked, but we needed the money and he promised us not to pull off
any more blackmail while we stayed. Last night, after we left the
office, he arranged this latest. Planned to incriminate me. You
little devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>Manuel, frightened, leaped away.</p>

<p>"We usually sleep until noon," went on O'Neill. "He counted on
that. Enter the catbird. Sat on our window-sill at ten A. M. and
screeched. Woke us up. We felt uneasy. Went to the office, broke
down a bolted door, and found what was up."</p>

<p>"Dog!" foamed Manuel. "Outcast of the gutter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Save your compliments! Mr. Meyrick, my partner is now at the
<i>Mail</i> office destroying today's issue of the <i>Mail</i>.
We've already ruined the first-page form, the cut of the policy,
and the negative. And we're going north as fast as the Lord'll let
us. You can do what you please. Arrest our little lemon-tinted
employer, if you want to."</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick stood, considering.</p>

<p>"However&mdash;I've done you a favor." O'Neill went on. "You can
do me one. Let Manuel off&mdash;on one condition."</p>

<p>"Name it."</p>

<p>"That he hands me at once two hundred dollars&mdash;one hundred
for myself, the other for my partner. It's legitimate salary money
due us&mdash;we need it. A long walk to New York."</p>

<p>"I myself&mdash;" began Meyrick.</p>

<p>"Don't want your money," said O'Neill. "Want Gonzale's."</p>

<p>"Gonzale's you shall have," agreed Meyrick. "You&mdash;pay
him!"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"Then it's the police&mdash;" hinted O'Neill.</p>

<p>Gonzale took two yellow bills from a wallet. He tossed them at
O'Neill.</p>

<p>"There, you cur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Careful," cried O'Neill. "Or I'll punch you yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He started forward, but Gonzale hastily withdrew. O'Neill and
the millionaire followed to the street.</p>

<p>"Just as well," commented Meyrick. "I should not have cared to
cause his arrest&mdash;it would have meant country-wide publicity."
He laid a hand on the arm of the newspaper man. "I take it," he
said, "that your fortunes are not at the highest ebb. You have done
me a very great service. I propose to write two checks&mdash;one
for you, one for your partner&mdash;and you may name the
amounts."</p>

<p>But the red-haired one shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "Nix on the anticlimax to virtue on a rampage.
We can't be paid for it. It would sort of dim the glory. We've got
the railroad fare at last&mdash;and we're going away from here.
Yes&mdash;away from here. On the choo-choo&mdash;riding
far&mdash;riding north."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," answered Spencer Meyrick, "if I can ever do
anything for you in New York, come and see me."</p>

<p>"You may have to make good on that," laughed O'Neill, and they
parted.</p>

<p>O'Neill hastened to the <i>Mail</i> office. He waved yellow
bills before the lanky Howe.</p>

<p>"In the nick of time," he cried. "Me, the fair-haired hero. And
here's the fare, Harry&mdash;the good old railroad fare."</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised," said Howe. "I've finished the job, Bob. Not
a trace of this morning's issue left. The fare! North in parlor
cars! My tobacco heart sings. Can't you hear the
elevated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Music, Harry, music."</p>

<p>"And the newsboys on Park Row&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Caruso can't touch them. Where can we find a time-table, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a corner of the plaza, Manuel Gonzale spoke sad
words in the ear of Martin Wall.</p>

<p>"It's the jinx," moaned Wall with conviction. "The star player
in everything I do down here. I'm going to burn the sand
hot-footing it away. But whither, Manuel, whither?"</p>

<p>"In Porto Rico," replied Gonzale, "I have not yet plied my
trade. I go there."</p>

<p>"Palm Beach," sighed Wall, "has diamonds that can be observed to
sparkle as far away as the New York society columns. But alas, I
lack the wherewithal to support me in the style to which my victims
are accustomed."</p>

<p>"Try Porto Rico," suggested Gonzale. "The air is mild&mdash;so
are the police. I will stake you."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Porto Rico it is. How the devil do we get there?"</p>

<p>Up the main avenue of San Marco Spencer Meyrick walked as a man
going to avenge. With every determined step his face grew redder,
his eye more dangerous. He looked at his watch. Eleven.</p>

<p>The eleventh hour! But much might happen between the eleventh
hour and high noon!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21">21. &mdash;HIGH WORDS AT HIGH NOON</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the Harrowby suite the holder of the title, a
handsome and distinguished figure, adorned for his wedding, walked
nervously the rather worn carpet. His brother, hastily pressed into
service as best man, sat puffing at a cigar with a persistency
which indicated a somewhat perturbed state of mind on his own
part.</p>

<p>"Brace up, Allan," he urged. "It'll be over before you realize
it. Remember my own wedding&mdash;gad, wasn't I frightened? Always
that way with a man&mdash;no sense to it, but he just can't help
it. Never forget that little parlor, with the flower of Marion
society all about, and me with my teeth chattering and my knees
knocking together."</p>

<p>"It is a bit of an ordeal," said Allan weakly. "Chap feels all
sort of&mdash;gone&mdash;inside&mdash;"</p>

<p>The telephone, ringing sharply, interrupted. George Harrowby
rose and stepped to it.</p>

<p>"Allan? You wish Allan? Very well. I'll tell him."</p>

<p>He turned away from the telephone and faced his brother.</p>

<p>"It was old Meyrick, kid. Seemed somewhat hot under the collar.
Wants to see you in their suite at once."</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what do you imagine he wants?"</p>

<p>"Going to make you a present of Riverside Drive, I fancy. Go
ahead, boy. I'll wait for you here."</p>

<p>Allan Harrowby went out, along the dusky corridor to the Meyrick
door. Not without misgivings, he knocked. A voice boomed "Come!" He
pushed open the door.</p>

<p>He saw Spencer Meyrick sitting purple at a table, and beside him
Cynthia Meyrick, in the loveliest gown of all the lovely gowns she
had ever worn. The beauty of the girl staggered Harrowby a bit;
never demonstrative, he had a sudden feeling that he should be at
her feet.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you sent for me?" he asked, coming into the room. As
he moved closer to the girl he was to marry he saw that her face
was whiter than her gown, and her brown eyes strained and
miserable.</p>

<p>"We did," said Meyrick, rising. He held out a paper. "Will you
please look at that."</p>

<p>His lordship took the sheet in unsteady hands. He glanced down.
Slowly the meaning of the story that met his gaze filtered through
his dazed brain. "Martin Wall did this," he thought to himself. He
tried to speak, but could not. Dumbly he stared at Spencer
Meyrick.</p>

<p>"We want no scene, Harrowby," said the old man wearily. "We
merely want to know if there is in existence a policy such as the
one mentioned here?"</p>

<p>The paper slipped from his lordship's lifeless hands. He turned
miserably away. Not daring to face either father or daughter, he
answered very faintly:</p>

<p>"There is."</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick sighed.</p>

<p>"That's all we want to know. There will be no wedding,
Harrowby."</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what!" His lordship faced about. "Why, sir&mdash;the
guests must be&mdash;downstairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;unfortunate. But there will be no wedding." The old
man turned to his daughter. "Cynthia," he asked, "have you nothing
to say?"</p>

<p>"Yes." White, trembling, the girl faced his lordship. "It seems,
Allan, that you have regarded our marriage as a business
proposition. You have gambled on the stability of the market. Well,
you win. I have changed my mind. This is final. I shall not change
it again."</p>

<p>"Cynthia!" And any who had considered Lord Harrowby unfeeling
must have been surprised at the anguish in his voice. "I have loved
you&mdash;I love you now. I adore you. What can I say in
explanation&mdash;of this. We gamble, all of us&mdash;it is a
passion bred in the family. That is why I took out this absurd
policy. My dearest&mdash;it doesn't mean that there was no love on
my side. There is&mdash;there always will be, whatever happens.
Can't you understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl laid her hand on his arm, and drew him away to the
window.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Allan," she said, for his ears alone. "Perhaps I
could have forgiven&mdash;but somehow&mdash;I don't care&mdash;as I
thought I did. It is better, embarrassing as it may be for us both,
that there should be no wedding, after all."</p>

<p>"Cynthia&mdash;you can't mean that. You don't believe me. Let me
send for my brother&mdash;he will tell you of the passion for
gambling in our family&mdash;he will tell you that I love you,
too&mdash;"</p>

<p>He moved toward the telephone.</p>

<p>"No use," said Cynthia Meyrick, shaking her head. "It would only
prolong a painful scene. Please don't, Allan."</p>

<p>"I'll send for Minot, too," Harrowby cried.</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot?" The girl's eyes narrowed. "And what has Mr. Minot
to do with this?"</p>

<p>"Everything. He came down here as the representative of Lloyds.
He came down to make sure that you didn't change your mind. He will
tell you that I love you&mdash;"</p>

<p>A queer expression hovered about Miss Meyrick's lips. Spencer
Meyrick interrupted.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he cried. "There is no need to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment." Cynthia Meyrick's eyes shone strangely. "Send for
your brother, Allan. And&mdash;for&mdash;Mr. Minot."</p>

<p>Harrowby stepped to the telephone. He summoned his forces. A
strained unhappy silence ensued. Then the two men entered the room
together.</p>

<p>"Minot&mdash;George, old boy," Lord Harrowby said helplessly.
"Miss Meyrick and her father have discovered the existence of a
certain insurance policy about which you both know. They have
believed that my motive in seeking a marriage was purely
mercenary&mdash;that my affection for the girl who
is&mdash;was&mdash;to have become my wife can not be sincere. They
are wrong&mdash;quite wrong. Both of you know that. I've sent for
you to help me make them understand&mdash;I can not&mdash;"</p>

<p>George Harrowby stepped forward, and smiled his kindly
smile.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," he said. "I regret that policy very
deeply. When I first heard of it I, too, suspected Allan's motives.
But after I talked with him&mdash;after I saw you&mdash;I was
convinced that his affection for you was most sincere. I thought
back to the gambling schemes for which the family has been
noted&mdash;I saw it was the old passion cropping out anew in
Allan&mdash;that he was really not to blame&mdash;that beyond any
question he was quite devoted to you. Otherwise I'd have done
everything in my; power to prevent the wedding."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Miss Meyrick's eyes flashed dangerously. "And&mdash;your
other witness, Allan?"</p>

<p>The soul of the other witness squirmed in agony. This was too
much&mdash;too much!</p>

<p>"You, Minot&mdash;" pleaded Harrowby. "You have
understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have felt that you were sincerely fond of Miss Meyrick,"
Minot replied. "Otherwise I should not have done&mdash;what I have
done."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Minot," the girl inquired, "you think I would be
wrong to give up all plans for the wedding?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I do," writhed Minot.</p>

<p>"And you advise me to marry Lord Harrowby at once?"</p>

<p>Mr. Minot passed his handkerchief over his damp forehead. Had
the girl no mercy?</p>

<p>"I do," he answered miserably.</p>

<p>Cynthia Meyrick laughed, harshly, mirthlessly.</p>

<p>"Because that's your business&mdash;your mean little business,"
she said scornfully. "I know at last why you came to San Marco. I
understand everything. You had gambled with Lord Harrowby, and you
came here to see that you did not lose your money. Well, you've
lost! Carry that news back to the concern you work for! In spite of
your heroic efforts, you've lost! At the last moment Cynthia
Meyrick changed her mind!"</p>

<p>Lost! The word cut Minot to the quick. Lost, indeed! Lost
Jephson's stake&mdash;lost the girl he loved! He had failed
Jephson&mdash;failed himself! After all he had done&mdash;all he
had sacrificed. A double defeat, and therefore doubly bitter.</p>

<p>"Cynthia&mdash;surely you don't mean&mdash;" Lord Harrowby was
pleading.</p>

<p>"I do, Allan," said the girl more gently. "It was
true&mdash;what I told you&mdash;there by the window. It is
better&mdash;father! Will you go down and&mdash;say&mdash;I'm not
to be married, after all?"</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick nodded, and turned toward the door.</p>

<p>"Cynthia," cried Harrowby brokenly. There was no reply. Old
Meyrick went out.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," his lordship said. "Sorry I made such a mess of
it&mdash;the more so because I love you, Cynthia&mdash;and always
shall. Good-by."</p>

<p>He held out his hand. She put hers in it.</p>

<p>"It's too bad, Allan," she said. "But&mdash;it wasn't to be.
And, even now, you have one consolation&mdash;the money that Lloyds
must pay you."</p>

<p>"The money means nothing, Cynthia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Meyrick is mistaken," Minot interrupted. "Lord Harrowby
has not even that consolation. Lloyds owes him nothing."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the girl defiantly.</p>

<p>"Up to an hour ago," said Minot, "you were determined to marry
his lordship?"</p>

<p>"I should hardly put it that way. But&mdash;I intended to."</p>

<p>"Yes. Then you changed your mind. Why?"</p>

<p>"I changed it because I found out about this ridiculous, this
insulting policy."</p>

<p>"Then his lordship's taking out of the policy caused the calling
off of the wedding?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"It may interest you to know&mdash;and it may interest Lord
Harrowby to recall&mdash;that five minutes before he took out this
policy he signed an agreement to do everything in his power to
bring about the wedding. And he further promised that if the
wedding should be called off because of any subsequent act of his,
he would forfeit the premium."</p>

<p>"By gad," said Lord Harrowby.</p>

<p>"The taking out of the policy was a subsequent act," continued
Minot. "The premium, I fancy, is forfeited."</p>

<p>"He's got you, Allan," said George Harrowby, coming forward,
"and I for one can't say I'm sorry. You're going to tear up that
policy now&mdash;and go to work for me."</p>

<p>"I for one am sorry," cried Miss Meyrick, her flashing eyes on
Minot. "I wanted you to win, Allan. I wanted you to win."</p>

<p>"Why?" Minot asked innocently.</p>

<p>"You ought to know," she answered, and turned away.</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby moved toward the door.</p>

<p>"We're not hard losers," he said blankly.
"But&mdash;everything's gone&mdash;it's a bit of a smash-up.
Good-by, Cynthia."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Allan&mdash;and good luck."</p>

<p>"Thanks." And Harrowby went out with his brother.</p>

<p>Minot stood for a time, not daring to move. Cynthia Meyrick was
at the window; her scornful back was not encouraging. Finally she
turned, saw Minot and gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you're still here?"</p>

<p>"Cynthia, now you understand," he said. "You know why I acted as
I did. You realize my position. I was in a horrible fix&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at him coldly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I do understand. You were gambling on me. You
came down here to defend your employer's cash. Well, you have
succeeded. Is there anything more to be said?"</p>

<p>"Isn't there? On the ramparts of the old fort the other
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please do not make yourself any more ridiculous than is
necessary. You have put your employer's money above my happiness.
Always. Really, you looked rather cheap to-day, with your
sanctimonious advice that I marry Harrowby. Aren't you beginning to
realize your own position&mdash;the silly childish figure you cut?"
"Then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night when you came staggering across the lawn to me with
this foolish gown in your arms&mdash;I told you I hated you. Do you
imagine I hate you any less now. Well, I don't." Her voice became
tearful. "I hate you! I hate you!"</p>

<p>"But some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned away from him, for she was sobbing outright now.</p>

<p>"I never want to see you again as long as I live," she cried.
"Never! Never! Never!"</p>

<p>Limp, pitiable, worn by the long fight he had waged, Minot stood
staring helplessly at her heaving shoulders.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;I can only say I'm sorry," he murmured.
"And&mdash;good-by."</p>

<p>He waited. She did not turn toward him. He stumbled out of the
room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22">22. &mdash;"WELL, HARDLY EVER"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MINOT went below and sent two messages, one to
Jephson, the other to Thacker. The lobby of the De la Pax was
thronged with brilliantly attired wedding guests who,
metaphorically, beat their breasts in perplexity over the tidings
that had come even as they craned their necks to catch the first
glimpse of that distinguished bridal party. The lavishly decorated
parlor that was to have been the scene of the ceremony stood
tragically deserted. Minot cast one look at it, and hurried again
to his own particular cell.</p>

<p>He took a couple of time-tables from his desk, and sat down in a
chair facing the window. All over now. Nothing to do but return to
the North, as fast as the trains would take him. He had won, but he
had also lost. He felt listless, weary. He let the time-tables fall
to the floor, and sat gazing out at that narrow
street&mdash;thinking&mdash;wondering&mdash;wishing&mdash;</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the clamor of his telephone
recalled him to himself. He leaped up, and seized the receiver.
Allan Harrowby's voice came over the wire.</p>

<p>"Can you run down to the room, Minot?" he inquired. "The last
call, old boy."</p>

<p>Minot went. He found both the Harrowbys there, prepared to say
good-by to San Marco forever.</p>

<p>"Going to New York on the Lady Evelyn," said George Harrowby,
who was aggressively cheerful. "From there I'm taking Allan to
Chicago. Going to have him reading George Ade and talking our
language in a week."</p>

<p>Lord Harrowby smiled wanly.</p>

<p>"Nothing left but Chicago," he drawled. "I wanted to see you
before I went, Minot, old chap. Not that I can thank you for all
you did&mdash;I don't know how. You stood by me like&mdash;like a
gentleman. And I realize that I have no claim on Lloyds&mdash;it
was all my fault&mdash;if I'd never let Martin Wall have that
confounded policy&mdash;, But what's the use of if-ing? All my
fault. And&mdash;my thanks, old boy." He sighed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Minot. "A business proposition, solely, from my
point of view. There's no thanks coming to me."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said George Harrowby, "that as the only victor
in this affair, you don't exhibit a proper cheerfulness. By the
way, we'd be delighted to take you north on our boat. Why
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Minot shook his head.</p>

<p>"Can't spare the time&mdash;thank you just the same," he
replied. "I'd like nothing better&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amid expressions of regret, the Harrowbys started for the
elevator. Minot walked along the dusky corridor with them.</p>

<p>"We've had a bit of excitement&mdash;what?" said Allan. "If
you're ever in London, you're to be my guest. Old George has some
sort of a berth for me over there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a berth, Allan," objected George, pressing the button for
the elevator. "You're not going to sleep. A job. Might as well
begin to talk the Chicago language now. Mr. Minot, I, too, want to
thank you&mdash;"</p>

<p>They stepped into the elevator, the door slammed, the car began
to descend. Minot stood gazing through the iron scroll work until
the blond head of the helpless Lord Harrowby moved finally out of
sight. Then he returned to his room and the time-tables, which
seemed such dull unhappy reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack Paddock appeared to invite Minot to take dinner with
him. His bags, he remarked, were all packed, and he was booked for
the seven o'clock train.</p>

<p>"I've slipped down the mountain of gold," he said in the course
of the dinner. "But all good things must end, and I certainly had a
good thing. Somehow, I'm not so gloomy as I ought to be."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Jack?" Minot asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock leaned over confidentially.</p>

<p>"Did I say her father was in the plumbing business?" he
inquired. "My error, Dick. He owns a newspaper&mdash;out in Grand
Rapids. Offered me a job any time I wanted it. Great joke
then&mdash;pretty serious now. For I'm going out to apply."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it."</p>

<p>"So am I, Dick. I was a fool to let her go back like that. Been
thinking it all over&mdash;and over&mdash;one girl in&mdash;how
many are there in the world, should you say? The other day I had a
chill. It occurred to me maybe she'd gone and married the young man
with the pale purple necktie who passes the plate in the Methodist
Church. So I beat it to the telegraph counter. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's heart whole and fancy free?"</p>

<p>"O. K. in both respects. So it's me for Grand Rapids. And say,
Dick, I&mdash;er&mdash;I want you to know I'd sent that telegram
before the accident last night. As a matter of fact, I sent it two
days ago."</p>

<p>"Good boy," said Minot. "I knew this game down here didn't
satisfy you. May I be the first to wish you joy?"</p>

<p>"You? With a face like a defeated candidate? I say, cheer up!
She'll stretch out eager arms in your direction yet."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, Jack."</p>

<p>"Well, while there's life there's still considerable hope lying
loose about the landscape. That's why I don't urge you to take the
train with me."</p>

<p>An hour later Mr. Paddock spoke further cheering words in his
friend's ear, and departed for the North. And in that city of
moonlight and romance Minot was left (practically) alone.</p>

<p>He took a little farewell walk through that quaint old town,
then retired to his room to read another chapter in the time-table.
At four-twenty in the morning, he noted, a small local train would
leave for Jacksonville. He decided he would take it. With no parlor
cars, no sleepers, he would not be likely to encounter upon it any
of the startled wedding party bound north.</p>

<p>The call he left did not materialize, and it was four o'clock
when he awoke. Hastily in the chill dawn he bade farewell to town
and hotel. In fifteen minutes he had left both behind, and was
speeding toward the small yellow station set on the town's edge. He
glanced feverishly at his watch. There was need of haste, for this
train was made up in San Marco, and had had as yet no chance to be
late.</p>

<p>He rushed through the gate just as it was being closed, and
caught a dreary little train in the very act of pulling out. Gloomy
oil lamps sought vainly to lessen the dour aspect of its two
coaches. Panting, he entered the rear coach and threw himself and
his bag into a seat.</p>

<p>Five seconds later he glanced across the aisle and discovered in
the opposite seat Miss Cynthia Meyrick, accompanied by a very
sleepy-eyed family!</p>

<p>"The devil!" said Minot to himself. He knew that she would see
in this utter accident nothing save a deliberate act of following.
What use to protest his innocence?</p>

<p>He considered moving to another seat. But such a theatric act
could only increase the embarrassment. Already his presence had
been noted&mdash;Aunt Mary had given him a glare, Spencer Meyrick a
scowl, the girl a cloudy vague "where have I seen this person
before?" glance in passing.</p>

<p>Might as well make the best of it. He settled himself in his
seat. Once again, as on another railroad car, he sought to keep his
eyes on the landscape without&mdash;the dim landscape with the
royal palms waving like grim ghosts in the half light. The train
sped on.</p>

<p>A most uncomfortable situation! If only it would grow light! It
seemed so silly to be forced to find the view out the window
entrancing while it was still very dark.</p>

<p>Spencer Meyrick went forward to the smoker. Aunt Mary, weary of
life, slid gently down to slumber. Her unlovely snore filled the
dim car.</p>

<p>How different this from the first ride together! The faint pink
of the sky grew brighter. Now Minot could see the gray moss hanging
to the evergreens, and here and there a squalid shack where human
beings lived and knew nothing of life. And beside him he heard a
sound as of a large body being shaken. Also the guttural protest of
Aunt Mary at this inconsiderate treatment.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary triumphed. Her snore rose to shatter the smoky roof.
Three times Minot dared to look, and each time wished he hadn't.
The whole sky was rosy now. Somewhere off behind the horizon the
good old sun was rising to go to work for the passenger department
of the coast railroad.</p>

<p>Some sense in looking out now. Minot saw a shack that seemed
familiar&mdash;then another. Next a station, bearing on its sad
shingle the cheery name of "Sunbeam." And close to the station,
gloomy in the dawn, a desiccated chauffeur beside an aged
automobile.</p>

<p>Minot turned quickly, and caught Cynthia Meyrick in the act of
peering over his shoulder. She had seen the chauffeur too.</p>

<p>The train had stopped a moment, but was under way again. In
those brown eyes Minot saw something wistful, something
hurt,&mdash;saw things that moved him to put everything to a sudden
test. He leaped to his feet and pulled madly at the bell cord.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what have you done?" Startled, she stared at
him.</p>

<p>"I've stopped the train. I'm going to ride to Jacksonville as I
rode to San Marco&mdash;ages ago. I'm not going alone."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Quick. The conductor will be here in a minute. Here's a card
and pencil&mdash;write a note for Aunt Mary. Say you'll meet them
in Jacksonville! Hurry, please!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Minot!" With great dignity.</p>

<p>"One last ride together. One last chance for me to&mdash;to set
things right if I can."</p>

<p>"If you can."</p>

<p>"If&mdash;I admit it. Won't you give me the chance? I thought
you would be game. I dare you!"</p>

<p>For a second they gazed into each other's eyes. The train had
come to a stop, and Aunt Mary stirred fretfully in her sleep. With
sudden decision Cynthia Meyrick wrote on the card and dropped it on
her slumbering relative.</p>

<p>"I know I'll be sorry&mdash;but&mdash;" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Hurry! This way! The conductor's coming there!"</p>

<p>A moment later they stood together on the platform of the
Sunbeam station, while the brief little train disappeared
indignantly in the distance.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have made me do that!" cried the girl in dismay.
"I'm always doing things on the spur of the moment&mdash;things I
regret afterward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. You explained that to me once. But you can also do
things on the spur of the moment that you're glad about all your
life. Oh&mdash;good morning, Barney Oldfield."</p>

<p>"Good morning," replied the rustic chauffeur with gleeful
recognition. "Where's it to this time, mister?"</p>

<p><a id="pic9" name="pic9"><!--Image Anchor--></a>

<br>

<div align="center"><img src="1301841h-images/LoveInsurance-09.jpg"

<br>

<p>"Jacksonville. And no hurry at all." Minot held open the door
and the girl stepped into the car.</p>

<p>"The gentleman is quite mistaken," she said to the chauffeur.
"There is a very great hurry."</p>

<p>"Ages of time until luncheon," replied Minot blithely, also
getting in. "If you were thinking of
announcing&mdash;something&mdash;then."</p>

<p>"I shall have nothing to announce, I'm sure. But I must be in
Jacksonville before that train. Father will be furious."</p>

<p>"Trust me, lady," said the chauffeur, grinding again at his
hooded music-box. "I've been doing stunts with this car since I saw
you last. Been over a hundred miles from Sunbeam. Begins to look as
though Florida wasn't going to be big enough, after all."</p>

<p>He leaped to the wheel, and again that ancient automobile
carried Cynthia Meyrick and the representative of Lloyds out of the
town of Sunbeam. But the exit was not a laughing one. The girl's
eyes were serious, cold, and with real concern in his voice Minot
spoke:</p>

<p>"Won't you forgive me&mdash;can't you? I was only trying to be
faithful to the man who sent me down here&mdash;faithful through
everything&mdash;as I should be faithful to you if you gave me the
chance. Is it too late&mdash;Cynthia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was a time," said the girl, her eyes wide, "when it was
not too late. Have you forgotten? That night on the balcony, when I
threw myself at your feet, and you turned away. Do you think that
was a happy moment for me?"</p>

<p>"Was it happy for me, for that matter?" "Oh, I was humiliated,
ashamed. Then your silly rescue of my gown&mdash;your advice to me
to marry Harrowby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you have had me throw over the men who trusted
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I only know that I can't forgive what has
happened&mdash;in a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was that last?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"You said in a minute."</p>

<p>"Your ears are deceiving you."</p>

<p>"Cynthia&mdash;you're not going to punish me because I was
faithful&mdash;Don't you suppose I tried to get some one in my
place?"</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"The day I first rode in this car with you. And then&mdash;I
stopped trying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I realized that if some one came in my place I'd have
to go away and never see you again&mdash;and I couldn't do that. I
had to be near you, dear girl&mdash;don't worry, he can't hear, the
motor's too noisy&mdash;I had to be where I could see that little
curl making a question mark round your ear&mdash;where I could hear
your voice&mdash;I had to be near you even if to do it I must break
my heart by marrying you to another man. I loved you. I love you
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>A terrific crash interrupted. Dolefully the chauffeur descended
from the car to make an examination. Dolefully he announced the
result.</p>

<p>"Busted right off," he remarked. "Say, I'm sorry. I'll have to
walk back to the garage at Sunbeam and&mdash;and I'm afraid you'll
have to jest sit here until I come back."</p>

<p>He went slowly down the road, and the two sat in that ancient
car in the midst of sandy desolation.</p>

<p>"Cynthia," Minot cried. "I worship you. Won't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl gave a strange little cry.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be cross with you a little longer," she said almost
tearfully. "But I can't. I wonder why I can't. I cried all night at
the thought of never seeing you again. I wonder why I cried. I
guess&mdash;it's because&mdash;for the first time&mdash;I'm
really&mdash;in love."</p>

<p>"Cynthia!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick&mdash;don't let me change my mind
again&mdash;ever&mdash;ever!"</p>

<p>"Only over my dead body I"</p>

<p>With one accord they turned and looked at that quaint southern
chauffeur plodding along through the dust and the sunshine. It did
not seem to either of them that there was any danger of his looking
back.</p>

<p>And, happily, he didn't.</p>
