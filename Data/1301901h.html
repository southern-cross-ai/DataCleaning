<h2><a id="rev"></a>A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW</h2>


<h3>A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE</h3>

<h3><i>The West Australian</i>, Perth, September 29, 1928</h3>

<p class="first">OF recent years, after a long period of neglect,
the historical novel seems to have come into its own once more.
Quite recently we have had such wonderful examples of historical
romance as Feuchtwanger's "Jew Suss" and "The Ugly Duchess;"
while now Mr. George Preedy has entered the lists with an
exceptionally well-written and finely conceived story of
eighteenth century Europe, when by virtue of the agreement, or
treaty, commonly spoken of as the Pragmatic Sanction, Maria
Theresa, the daughter of the Emperor Charles VI., bound nearly
all the European Powers to uphold her claim to the Austrian
Succession. This claim was disputed by the Elector of Bavaria, on
whose behalf Frederick II., the young King of Prussia, and the
French King, who was before all else desirous of weakening
Germany, took up arms, sublimely regardless of the Pragmatic
Sanction. Only England and Holland stood by their promises to
Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>This is the period Mr. Preedy has chosen for the historical
background of his stirring romance, in which fact and fiction are
so skilfully interwoven that it is not always easy to tell where
the one begins and the other ends. The central figure of the
story is General Crack, a mercenary soldier of great military
talents and a European reputation as a successful fighter.
General Crack&mdash;an anagram of his baptismal names, Christian
Rudolph Augustus Christopher Ketlar&mdash;is of illegitimate
birth by the Duke of Kurland and a Viennese actress, but as a
Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, he has a right to call himself
Prince Christian of Kurland, and to become Prince of Kurland in
truth as well as in a titular sense, is General Crack's supreme
ambition in life. Supreme, that is, until he meets the little
German Princess Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau and falls madly in love
with her. The whole issue of the story turns on this
infatuation.</p>

<p>Very ably the author leads up to the tragic results of General
Crack's hasty marriage with the Princess&mdash;a girl hardly out
of the school-room, without experience or the capacity for any
very strong emotions, and only conscious of the knowledge that
she has already conceived a school-girl's luke-warm passion for
the handsome young Elector of Bavaria, whom she has met at the
Duchess of Schönbuchel's castle, when he was visiting there
"incognito," under the name of Captain Leopold.</p>

<p>The visit has far-reaching consequences, for it is at
Schönbuchel that the wily old Austrian diplomat, Count Hensdorff,
who has been entrusted with the important mission of at all costs
engaging General Crack and his mercenaries on behalf of the young
Elector, finally strikes a bargain that, as the price of the
Princess's hand, General Crack shall undertake to do his utmost
to win for the Elector the Imperial throne of Austria. How
General Crack carries out his compact to the letter, and this
despite the fact, made known to him through an outside agency of
Leopold's base ingratitude and treachery at the very moment when
his powerful adherent was striking so decisive a blew in his
favour that his kingdom was assured to him; and how, immediately
his obligations have been fulfilled, General Crack, not only
throws off his allegiance to the puppet Emperor, but
deliberately sets himself the simple task of pulling Leopold
from the insecure throne on which he has placed him, is related
by the author in a narrative of extraordinary interest and
unusual dramatic power.</p>

<p>The three characters in the book that stand out most vividly,
and on whom Mr. Preedy has expended the greatest pains, are
General Crack, Leopold and Count Hensdorff. Very marked is the
contrast between the bold, imperturbable soldier of fortune,
gifted with uncommon beauty and also with uncommon gifts,
seemingly invulnerable save in the one weak spot at which
Leopold, unfortunately for himself, as well as for his
commander-in-chief, strikes a dastardly blow, and the weak,
irresolute young Elector, whose unenviable destiny it is to be
always a tool, in the hands of stronger men, and always to see
himself despised by those whose loyalty to the House of Bavaria
is hardly strong enough to support them in their fidelity to
their vacillating master and liege lord. Admirable, too, is the
portrait of Count Hensdorff, whose diplomacy is seldom at fault,
whose sagacity is as far-sighted as it is profound, and whose
patience and forbearance fail after innumerable trials, so that
the old man forsakes Leopold and throws in his lot with General
Crack, though the regard and esteem which the latter feels for
him will not permit the final sacrifice of his becoming one in
that last, wild ride into Kurland, with its inevitable but
glorious ending.</p>

<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>PROEM</h2>

<p class="first">THE guide knew little&mdash;or would not speak.
He seemed to be a man who had been so long silent that words were
difficult. When I asked him about the portraits, he sullenly
pointed to the names written in the corner of the ornate frame,
where huge acanthus leaves scrolled amidst split fruits and
massive grapes.</p>

<p>"But I am a foreigner," I protested, "and these names mean
nothing to me."</p>

<p>A chilly sun made a faint refulgence in the immense room,
falling clearly through the high, deep windows, which looked upon
a tranquil and dusky garden, where heroic statues guarded, with a
pensive air, parterres which for many a summer had borne no
flowers.</p>

<p>The guide pointed to a candelabra in gilded bronze, and
reluctantly extolled its merits as the finest piece of work in
the vast room. It seemed as if he wished to distract me from
these portraits of which he knew nothing. The candelabra was
formed of grinning masks, gleaming snakes, and stiff, unearthly
blooms, well suited to the rigid metal. I wondered how long since
orange scarlet flowers of fire had also bloomed there, from the
white stems of scented candles. A long while, no doubt...</p>

<p>"No one comes here but yourself, I suppose, and any traveller
to whom you may chance to show the Château?"</p>

<p>"No one," he replied. "It is impossible to live in a place
like this nowadays, and every one has forgotten it, and all that
it is about, and every one who lived here. Even the pictures," he
grumbled, "are not very good, and badly require cleaning."</p>

<p>"One of them," I said, "appears to be an emperor; but it has
no name."</p>

<p>"The name is there if you look," replied the old man,
sullenly, "and it is an emperor; but there were a great many of
them in those days, and none of them lasted very long."</p>

<p>The portrait to which I referred was, indeed, blackened, and
nothing showed clearly except the long, pale face of the young
man, and his blond or powdered hair, tied with a cerulean ribbon.
He had those marked features which we associate with the most
important Imperial Dynasty, and his eyes were large, blue and
appealing. He appeared to be wearing royal robes, and under his
slender right hand was a purple cushion, on which rested an
opulent diadem, richly embellished with enamel and jewels, but
all, now, coated with dirt and dust; in many places cracked
beneath the decayed varnish.</p>

<p>The companion picture was that of a girlish woman, very
elaborately dressed; but this, also, had been much defaced by
time.</p>

<p>"She was too plump," grumbled the guide, looking up at the
pictured face, "and very stupid."</p>

<p>But I could discern little of the portrait&mdash;only that it
was that of a soft, blonde creature, tightly laced into elaborate
brocades, and feeding, from a golden chalice, an eagle delicately
crowned. The lady, however, regarded neither the gilded eagle nor
the gilded chalice, but gazed straight before her with light,
mournful eyes. Her tresses were dressed high, and there was a
braid of jasmine round her candid brow.</p>

<p>The frame of this picture was enriched by coats of arms, one
above the other, mounting to the top, where the Imperial Eagle
and the Imperial Diadem rose in a swirl of sumptuous pretension
to an apex of gaudy splendour.</p>

<p>"She was related," remarked the surly guide, not without a
certain pride, "to nearly all the noble houses of the empire."
But he could tell me no more about her than that, and her name
was Eleanora, which already, for myself, I had seen written on
the frame in scrolling letters.</p>

<p>I lingered before these two pictures, which were set on either
side of a ponderous ebony cabinet, emblazoned with Italian marble
of rose, amber and orange hues. The guide told me, with sullen
impatience, that there was nothing more to see in the Château,
and he rattled the heavy keys, which he was longing to turn
behind my back.</p>

<p>"Very few people come to see the Château," he added,
reluctantly, "and, after all, why should they?"</p>

<p>The palace, I knew, had long ago been abandoned, and there was
little left in it worthy of curiosity.</p>

<p>I was beset by many moods, and would have stayed in the
mingling shadow and sunlight of that vast, arrogant and abandoned
chamber; but the guide hastened me away.</p>

<p>"All these people are dead and forgotten," he grumbled. "What
does it matter about them now?" He pointed out a basalt, lustrous
black crucifix, and asked me if I had seen the golden bed of the
Emperor in the Prince Palatine's residence at Oud-Buda?</p>

<p>"There, too," he continued, "is the regalia of St. Stephen,
and his gilt crozier, and in the garden are silver tortoises and
a marble cannon ball; but here we have no such treasures," he
added, with sullen mournfulness. "There used to be a collection
of medals, antiquities and Grecian coins; but they were sold some
time ago. And now," he repeated, glancing at me with hostility,
"there is nothing more to see."</p>

<p>But precisely at this moment I had observed yet another
picture, which hung close to the opulent entrance door, and, with
its back to the window, was in a sombre and gloomy light which
rendered it barely distinguishable.</p>

<p>This was an official portrait, on a grand scale, of a
gentleman in a dark grey velvet coat, lined with fur, over which
was some light armour padded with orange satin.</p>

<p>Round his shoulders was a Polish pelisse lined with leopard
skin, fastened by heavy gilt cords; and on his breast were
several orders, some of which even I, a foreigner, could
recognize, so famous were they: the Eagle of Poland, the Eagle of
Prussia, and The Golden Fleece. In a delicate right hand, half
hidden by elaborate ruffles of lace, he grasped a baton,
sprinkled with <i>fleurs de lis</i>; the other hand, resting on
the huge silk knot of the dark orange sash at the hip, was hidden
in a military gauntlet, fringed and embroidered.</p>

<p>These details were those of many a grandiloquent and imposing
picture of this period.</p>

<p>The man had been a prince and a general. I looked curiously at
his face, and thought it the most vital countenance I had ever
seen gaze from any canvas. Whether this was due to the skill of
the artist or the personality of the sitter, I do not know; but
the effect was remarkable&mdash;as if some one alive, eager and
arrogant, had entered the lofty, deserted room.</p>

<p>The hair was arranged fantastically, after some transient
fashion: full curls on the shoulders, and from a buckle behind,
pomaded and powdered to a silver hue; but the man's face was
dark, almost Oriental in dusky bloom. He was young, and handsome
to an almost foppish degree. The short, regular features were
composed and smooth, yet expressed an unconquerable energy,
inflexible purpose and immutable will. How this was achieved in a
face almost masklike in its serenity, I do not know. It seemed to
emanate from the mere stare of the black eyes, the mere curl of
the full lips, the mere pose of the erect head.</p>

<p>In the sombre, murky background, where there was the usual
flaming fort and the usual charge of cavalry, bursting bombs and
falling banners in a sulphurous gloom of tempestuous battle, I
saw a coat of arms unknown to me, and a ducal coronet.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" I asked&mdash;but more of myself than of the
guide, already fumbling at the door. A Polish or a Hungarian
prince, for there was something Eastern about the man, despite
the Western luxury of his elaborate and elegant attire.</p>

<p>"The House of Kurland," muttered the guide, impatiently; "of
the House of Ketlar, which has long been extinct; but he had no
name; he was an adventurer, a mercenary soldier. But everything
about him has been forgotten." And with a sudden leer, the old
man asked me if I had seen the vaults in the Church of the
Capucine at Vienna&mdash;the Impedal vaults&mdash;"where," he
said, "you will find ashes with stupendous titles writ above, and
splendid coffins bearing the Imperial Crown and Sceptre, and
adorned with scrolls of laurel and palm leaves."</p>

<p>I had seen them, and knew the heavy, classic elegance that
adorned these gorgeous coffins in the damp vaults of the Capucine
Church at Vienna. Yes, I had seen them&mdash;but lingered there a
brief moment only, passing no further than the massive bronze
door at the entrance to the vaults, glimpsing the immense
sarcophagi within, behind railings and gates of iron, each
sumptuously housing an Imperial tenant. While they were alive
they filled the world with their fame; now they are dead, it is
not good to visit them.</p>

<p>I asked the guide why he had reminded me of a charnel house,
at this moment and in this place? And I was glad of the pale,
insistent sunshine, and the airy freedom behind the lofty
windows, though it was but the airy freedom of a ruined park with
broken alleys and decayed statues. Then I looked again at the
haughty and flourishing portrait, and saw now, beneath the hand
that held the baton, a map upon a cushion&mdash;a map of
Kurland.</p>

<p>"He seems to interest you," grinned the withered guide. "He
was nobody."</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe that," I mused. It seemed to me as if
the portrait would not allow me to depart, but stared me down,
keeping me where I stood.</p>

<p>Yet I left it, in its emblazoned magnificence, and passed the
great windows one by one, walking slowly down that long,
deserted, sumptuous room. Faint, lustrous clouds were collecting
in the translucent heavens; shadows were sailing lightly over the
bleached hues of the garden; a watery wind had arisen&mdash;it
came from the river, which I could not see, but knew to be quite
near, beneath the hanging terraces which had once been so
lavishly embellished with all the richness of exotic blossoms,
and all the grandeur of elaborate trees.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" I asked. "A fop, a dandy, a courtier?"</p>

<p>"A great soldier," said the old man, as he descended the wide,
painted, tattered staircase before me. "He won many victories,
and took many towns."</p>

<p>"I should like to know his story," I said.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is no story," he replied. "I told you he was nothing
and no one knows anything about him."</p>

<p>I knew better: elegant, insolent, brave, superb, with his high
pretension to chains, orders and coronet, sumptuously armed and
gorgeously bedizened, and by all forgotten!</p>

<p>I feed the man at the entrance to the Château, and prepared to
take my departure. His sunken eyes gleamed with satisfaction at
seeing the last of me.</p>

<p>I had been a troublesome visitor, who had asked too many
questions and overstayed my time; and still I lingered, glancing
up at the huge and florid facade, which had something monstrous
in its flaunting show of pride.</p>

<p>"What was his name?" I asked. "What did they call him?"</p>

<p>The old man asked, suspiciously:</p>

<p>"Who? Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That portrait," I insisted; "the portrait in the corner."</p>

<p>The old man, hobbling away, rattling his keys, answered, over
his shoulder:</p>

<p>"They called him General Crack."</p>

<p>Then he hesitated, and, with a flash of malice, called me
back, and said that there was one more object in the Château that
I might care to see, and he returned to that mournful desertion
of the Château and entered a room on the ground floor which was
dark and damp. The guide pulled back tarnished, heavy curtains
and pointed to an old stained print hanging on the panelled
wall.</p>

<p>A funeral procession, black with lugubrious solemnity,
mourning sable robes, weepers, a coach with eight horses whose
trappings touched the ground, whose plumes rose, monstrous, above
the cortege, a pall bedizened with the arms I had seen in the
portrait, and underneath:</p>

<p><i>The Pompous Obsequies of His Highness Prince Christian
Rudolph Augustus Christopher Ketlar, Maréchal de France, Prince
of The Holy Roman Empire, Knight of the Orders of Poland and
Saxony.</i></p>

<p>The guide made no remark, and his sunken eyes seemed to dare
me to question him; I left the Château for the last time, looking
back at it as one looks back at a place one is never likely to
see again. By the scrolled rusty iron gates that enclosed this
neglected domain, I saw through the litter of mouldering pine
needles beneath a gaunt, black fir, one small bright green
leaf.</p>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN he arrived at the gates of the Château, the
messenger remarked with scorn on the sumptuous prospect.</p>

<p>"All very well," he muttered, "when one's father has been
Paymaster General and Viceroy of Naples&mdash;oh, yes, we all
know what that means&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not relish his errand and with a rather bitter eye
viewed the obvious beauties of the scene.</p>

<p>An avenue of lofty trees stretched before him, trees so lofty
that they seemed to shake their airy plumes in the clouds which,
rosy and gauzy, softened the August cerulean of the high
Heavens.</p>

<p>Beneath these trees the rich thick sward showed an unblemished
green, and beyond these trees stood the Château of Ottenheim
behind terraces with statues and balustrades and vases of
handsome leaved plants, all white in the clear, hot, thin
sunlight.</p>

<p>The messenger passed through the gilded iron gates, which
stood open and unguarded as if contemptuous of intruders, and
rode slowly up the straight entrance road.</p>

<p>Glancing to left or right as he went reluctantly on his way,
he saw pleasant vistas and noble <i>allées</i> of an imposing
park with here and there a glimpse of the smooth outlines of a
classic temple or the silver jets of a stately fountain.</p>

<p>"All very well," he repeated. "All very fine, if it were
honestly come by&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herds of curious striped and spotted deer wandered in the
distant azure glades, and exotic, long-tailed birds flew among
the foliage, adding to the fantastic air of the prospect; a
keeper in a besilvered livery was in charge of these odd
ornaments, which were so delicate and seldom lived long in
Europe. The messenger, with a more decided sneer, reflected on
the expense of menageries, which should be, of course, luxuries
reserved for monarchs.</p>

<p>When he reached the terraces and the winged staircases, he was
dazzled by the brightness of the sun reflected from so much white
stone. The gleam of the great pompous façade made him blink, the
tall and massive statues of heroes and gods in their curled
draperies seemed scornful of his mere humanity.</p>

<p>Despite himself he was impressed.</p>

<p>He was also hot and tired, and his horse drooped as soon as
the rein was slackened; he whistled and two tall grooms came from
one of the long low wings that housed the stables.</p>

<p>The messenger dismounted and asked, drily, for the master of
the Château.</p>

<p>He added that he was expected.</p>

<p>One of the grooms directed him to the great door at the top of
the terraces, where he would find some one to attend to his
business, and led away his horse. The messenger pursed up his
face as one who has expected more honour than he finds, and
unwillingly mounted the unshaded steps, so grand and shallow
between the flourishing stone figures with wreaths, crowns and
trophies; when he reached the top he was hot and breathless, for
he was oldish and of a stout habit.</p>

<p>Two footmen in glittering liveries were behind the glass
doors; their colours, like those of the keepers and the grooms,
were blackish green and silver, like a parody of the colours of
the House of Austria, and their badge, three collared goats'
heads: these footmen admitted the messenger at once, and took his
dusty cloak and his stiff hat.</p>

<p>"I am expected?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monseigneur. Colonel Pons waits for you."</p>

<p>"I do not want to see Colonel Pons, I want to see your
master."</p>

<p>"That is impossible, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"He is not here?"</p>

<p>"You cannot see him, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>Frowning with vexation, the messenger produced a letter from
his pocket; it was garnished with dangling seals of black wax
that bore imposing eagles.</p>

<p>"Here are my credentials&mdash;I wish to hand them to your
master."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, we have our orders. Colonel Pons waits for
you."</p>

<p>The messenger had been warned of such a possible reception;
there was nothing possible but patience and diplomacy.</p>

<p>To gain an entrance to the Château was some advantage; to
satisfy the necessities of his fatigue and hunger would be
another gain.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied haughtily, "I will see Colonel
Pons."</p>

<p>The servants at once preceded him down a lofty marble corridor
full of light from the many windows opening on the terrace, to a
noble <i>salon</i> that gave on to the side of the Château. This
room was high and grand, gilded and decorated with rich
voluptuous pictures and elegant pieces of furniture; the tall
window displayed an enchanting prospect of park and fountains; on
the tulipwood table by this window a choice collation was
spread.</p>

<p>Despite the messenger's ill humour he was cheered by this
sight; shown into an anteroom to refresh his appearance and
attire he marked the silver ewer, the fine damask towel, the
crystal flasks of Hungary and orange water; he murmured "ill
gotten gains" and was sure that all this display was to impress
him with the wealth and elegance of the Château of Ottenheim and
the master of the Château of Ottenheim.</p>

<p>When he returned to the <i>salon</i>, Colonel Pons was
awaiting him and saluted him in a cordial and respectful
manner.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said this gentleman, "to fob you off with
myself&mdash;but I act as secretary here and I shall be able to
conduct your affair."</p>

<p>The messenger looked as sarcastic as he dare; he did not wish
to give things an ill turn by carrying matters with too high a
hand, nor yet to creep too low; he produced again the letter with
the lustrous, black, dangling seals adorned by scowling
eagles.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons bowed.</p>

<p>"You are Count Michael Hensdorff, no doubt?" he remarked, and
the messenger said he was indeed that personage.</p>

<p>They sat down to table, covering by commonplaces a keen
scrutiny of each other.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons had a very amusing appearance; he was a trim,
dapper little man of about fifty with a stiff military air; his
prominent eyes were a violent blue in a full crimson face, his
mouth was crescent shaped, his features good; all his clothes
seemed a little tight, his wig was well curled and powdered in
the front; he had a fine hand. Though his temperament was
obviously plethoric, he did not lack good nature and
breeding.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff was about the same age but heavier and taller;
his complexion was a yellowish red and his eyes blue, but these
were sunk in his head and faded; his nose was large and
pendulous, his mouth harsh. He was rather carelessly dressed, but
he had a manner of authority and was clearly a nobleman. He
despised Colonel Pons as soon as he saw him, but went warily
nevertheless; he was an old campaigner and an old intriguer;
there was nothing of worldly affairs that he did not know and he
had found most of his knowledge sour to his taste.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons played the host with precise courtesy. This was
easy, as food and service were excellent; Count Hensdorff
calculated the cost of everything from trout and truffles to
pineapple and peaches, and ate grossly, satisfying a brisk
appetite.</p>

<p>When he looked out of the window before him, on those long
stretches of sward, on the fountains falling into the lake, and
the aerial distances, so silver azure, he was thinking of the
cost of all that&mdash;of bringing the water up and rolling the
grass&mdash;of planting so many trees and trellises.</p>

<p>When the cloth was drawn, Tokay was placed on the table and
Colonel Pons filled the two greenish glasses; Count Hensdorff had
been careful how he indulged in the light German wines, but he
could not refuse the Imperial vintage.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons had drunk heartily, with the air of a man who can
count on himself and his discretion, even after deep potations.
He now rose and gave a toast, holding out his glass:</p>

<p>"General Crack."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff was taken by surprise; the other added:</p>

<p>"General Crack&mdash;our host."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff could not refuse to rise and pledge the
name.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;General Crack." He drank and then laughed,
"But&mdash;between you and me&mdash;"</p>

<p>They reseated themselves.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Colonel Pons, whose vivid bulging eyes seemed
now to blaze in his flushed face, "between you and me&mdash;" He
finished his wine.</p>

<p>"This is all very splendid," smiled the messenger. "I am duly
impressed."</p>

<p>"I thought you would be."</p>

<p>"But I know the real value of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Many million kronen," finished Colonel Pons. "Of course,
you've seen nothing yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, I mean the real value of all this
display&mdash;it might go where it came from, you know&mdash;into
other people's pockets."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Colonel Pons, taking another glass of Tokay.</p>

<p>"I dare say you get a pretty good salary."</p>

<p>Colonel Pons did not think this worth a reply; he wiped his
narrow purple lips with a very delicate handkerchief.</p>

<p>"And he treats you well, no doubt," added Hensdorff, taking
out a curved pipe finished with a head of Caesar Augustus.</p>

<p>"As one soldier to another."</p>

<p>"But will it last?"</p>

<p>"What a ridiculous question," returned the Colonel blandly.
"Will you, or I, or anything last? Flesh is grass, my dear
Count."</p>

<p>"Don't put me off with quips, Colonel, for I've very little
time to waste. I've to be back in Vienna on Friday, and a damned
tedious journey it is, I can tell you; my lackey fell sick on the
way and I had to come alone."</p>

<p>"With pious thoughts for company, eh?"</p>

<p>The Colonel had also his pipe, but it was a more elegant
affair than that of his guest; pale wreaths of smoke began
tentatively to ascend to the gilt ceiling; the two gentlemen
relaxed comfortably into the rich satin chairs with the
well-rounded backs and stout arms and big bow legs.</p>

<p>"With this thought&mdash;to see General Crack himself."</p>

<p>"You won't," Pons assured him. "You'll see no one but myself.
You can stay as long as you like, but you won't see General
Crack."</p>

<p>"You know from whom I come?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;it's because of whom you come from that he
won't see you."</p>

<p>"I've orders to see him&mdash;positive orders."</p>

<p>Colonel Pons grimaced.</p>

<p>"It's absolutely no use, my dear fellow!"</p>

<p>"He's here, I suppose, in this little paradise of his?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, can't you tell him&mdash;one soldier to
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. You've got to transact your business with
me."</p>

<p>Hensdorff could not control a flare of temper; saw no great
reason why he should control a flare of temper.</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I will."</p>

<p>"Just as you please," replied the Colonel with a slight
deepening of the violet in his cheeks. "You know best what
they'll say in Vienna when you tell them you wouldn't treat with
me."</p>

<p>"They're not so desperate," declared Hensdorff sullenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, they aren't, aren't they?" snapped Colonel Pons. "Oh,
aren't they indeed? No, I suppose not&mdash;with <i>you</i>
sitting <i>here</i>, oh, of course not!"</p>

<p>Hensdorff writhed.</p>

<p>"Things look black," he admitted.</p>

<p>"I should think they do." Colonel Pons leaned forward in some
excitement. "How many are in this, eh? All the old gang, one on
top of another&mdash;England, France, Spain, Holland? We hear the
news here, I can tell you. General Crack is well informed; that
conference in Brussels is a farce&mdash;any minute it will break
up&mdash;and the Allies are ready, while you aren't. Lorraine,
Hungary and Prussia&mdash;all straining at the leash, eh?"</p>

<p>"I've no doubt that General Crack is well informed of all
that," sneered Michael Hensdorff. "He'd keep his eye on his
market&mdash;but if this pot boils over he'll get scalded, like
the rest of us."</p>

<p>"What is your offer?" asked Pons. "We may as well come to
that."</p>

<p>"I'm not prepared to make one. Don't fly too high. Who, after
all, <i>is</i> General Crack?"</p>

<p>Pons was silent; he smoked, like a man at ease.</p>

<p>"You can't bluff me," added Hensdorff, who was bluffing
himself by this display of assurance. "His position is
precarious, his fortune unstable, and we all know how he got
it&mdash;his father had a finger in every pocket in the
Empire&mdash;Viceroy of Naples and Paymaster General!"</p>

<p>"Why rake up all this ancient history? What can it matter how
he made his money?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;his reputation&mdash;you can't play fast and loose
with every one forever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you're clever enough," declared Pons, "you can."</p>

<p>"Bah! If you follow your man so blindly he'll lead you into a
ditch; you won't be able to scramble out of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what about your man?" cried the Colonel with popping
eyes. "Isn't he in the ditch already?"</p>

<p>"You mean the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you call him the Emperor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, and you'd better be careful; if I was to report
this in Vienna&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Report it in Hell," cried the Colonel, inflamed. "What do we
care about Vienna?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't flourish too much," sneered Hensdorff. "You're
not so secure&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel Pons interrupted by striking the table with his open
hand.</p>

<p>"Words, words!" he cried. "You came here to make an offer for
the services of General Crack&mdash;make it!"</p>

<p>Hensdorff was not thus to be domineered over; he retorted
vigorously:</p>

<p>"I shall not. My offer is for the ears of General Crack
alone."</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that?" asked Pons softly.</p>

<p>Hensdorff, though cornered, continued to bluff: "Not at all. I
merely follow my instructions. Your General Crack is not so
invaluable&mdash;to any one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know," put in Colonel Pons quietly, "that his name is
worth twenty-five thousand men&mdash;raised and put into the
field to-morrow&mdash;that he has Pomerania and Kurland by
crooking his finger&mdash;and that every Power in Europe is
making an offer to him."</p>

<p>At this last cunningly devised bait Hensdorff was forced to
jump, though he saw the hook.</p>

<p>"No one can offer what the Emperor can offer."</p>

<p>"When he <i>is</i> the Emperor&mdash;the Elector of Bavaria,
your master, <i>isn't</i>&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Hensdorff. "With France behind him? General Crack
is too wise not to know which way to jump. He likes the winning
side."</p>

<p>"He makes the winning side," corrected Pons. "I don't think
he's very temptable just now; he's had all the fame and money he
wants; he is very well here; he dislikes your master; he is as
hard as this"&mdash;and Colonel Pons touched the white marble
panel in the window place. "A few points against you,
Hensdorff."</p>

<p>"If this had been an easy mission I wouldn't have been sent on
it," replied the Imperial messenger. "General Crack is for the
highest bidder, of course; one expects no more from a mercenary
soldier&mdash;a man of no nationality, enriched by plunder and
corruption&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold there," said Pons. "He thinks a great deal of his
honour, he is very nice on all questions of punctilio&mdash;you
must put these things delicately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But not with you, my dear fellow. We can't waste time in
talking of honour and honesty and that sort of nonsense. Will
General Crack take service with the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Not with your Emperor," replied the Colonel, and Hensdorff
pulled his big under lip nervously. "No tricks with me,
Count&mdash;just look round you. Plenty of money, eh? Plenty of
everything that money can buy, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried the other impatiently, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But nothing. Your master is wobbling like a cork at sea, his
pockets are empty and his head not much better. General Crack
doesn't believe in him; <i>in fine</i>, he has nothing to
offer."</p>

<p>Hensdorff pulled out the letter with the Imperial seal and
flung it on the table.</p>

<p>"He has, he has, Colonel Pons, and here it is under his own
seal&mdash;something higher than anything any one else could
offer."</p>

<p>Pons was slightly impressed by this manifest earnestness; he
felt, though he did not confess, a prick of faint curiosity.</p>

<p>"General Crack has The Golden Fleece," he remarked drily.</p>

<p>"So have a lot of rogues," said Hensdorff, bitterly. "This is
more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More?"</p>

<p>"May I not carry it to General Crack himself?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>Hensdorff accepted defeat on this point.</p>

<p>"Well, it's the hand of the Archduchess Maria Luisa."</p>

<p>"The devil it is!" grinned Pons. "Well, that's something!"</p>

<p>"The Emperor's sister&mdash;with the title of Archduke," added
Hensdorff stiffly.</p>

<p>The Colonel laughed, recovering from his surprise.</p>

<p>"Eighteen and a blooming young woman," snapped Hensdorff,
grimmer and grimmer.</p>

<p>"As plain as a Puritan's smock," commented Pons. "With two
left feet by her walk&mdash;no use, Count, no use."</p>

<p>And he flicked at the Imperial letter.</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear General Crack's opinion on that point."
Hensdorff was stubborn. "Carry it as you will, it's not an offer
of every day&mdash;an Imperial Princess and an Imperial
title."</p>

<p>"Imperial fiddle-dee-dee&mdash;why, her picture's been hawked
through all the courts of Europe, touched up too. I'm well
informed, you observe; the poor girl will never go down without a
dowry, and that's what she'll never get. Clap her in a convent,
Count, and save yourself trouble."</p>

<p>Hensdorff had expected all this, so contrived to keep his
temper.</p>

<p>"My dear Colonel, you have of course learnt all this insolence
from your master. I take no notice of it&mdash;there is the offer
and you have till to-morrow to think it over."</p>

<p>He rose, with an air of finality, putting away the pipe that
had long since got chilled.</p>

<p>"You're welcome to wait till to-morrow," replied Pons unmoved,
"but it's <i>no use</i> spreading birdlime for General
Crack&mdash;he was in the trenches at twelve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And frightening nurses with cannon from his cradle," sneered
Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"Exactly. He knows his way through any intrigue and any
battle. He won't have your Archduchess."</p>

<p>"Ask him," said Hensdorff laconically.</p>

<p>"Certainly." Pons gave his gurgling laugh; his staring blue
eyes sparkled with amusement. "But I'll tell you this&mdash;" He
rose also, straightening his tight waistcoat, "General Crack has
his eye on another lady&mdash;you're too late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He may have his eye on a dozen," replied Hensdorff coldly.
"My offer stands."</p>

<p>"But he intends matrimony," said Pons, enjoying the grossness
of the other's surprise, "for the lady is one whom he will get no
other way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has at last set his mind on marriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at last, I'd never have thought it, but there we
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Hensdorff sharply, suspecting something
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Anhalt-Dessau's daughter&mdash;Eleanora."</p>

<p>This was worse than Hensdorff had anticipated. He cried out
furiously, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"But she is destined for the Emperor himself!"</p>

<p>"Precisely," grinned Colonel Pons, "but General Crack is more
likely to get her."</p>

<p>This was really a swinging blow for the Imperial messenger; he
did not know whether to treat the statements of Colonel Pons as
mere impertinence or to give them serious attention. He bowed
stiffly and said he would take a turn in the park, the sun being
declined from the heavens and the shade pleasant.</p>

<p>And he placed, with a gesture not without hauteur, a miniature
case on the table next the letter, saying that it contained a
likeness of the Archduchess Maria Luisa.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="first">COUNT HENSDORFF, having nothing better to do,
wandered over the Château, inspecting with a covert sneer the
splendours of this admirable dwelling.</p>

<p>He thought it detestable that a man like General Crack should
have been able to inherit and amass so much money, when he, after
working so hard in the service of so many princes, should have
accumulated nothing but debts, and he envied his host the gift he
himself lacked, the gift of knowing the winning side before it
won; whereas he, Hensdorff, had wasted his time in trying to
bolster up failures.</p>

<p>He was not quite sure that even now&mdash;well, what had that
hateful Pons said? "Empty pockets and a head little better." He
wavered in his allegiance towards his Emperor and began to wonder
if he could not strike a bargain with General Crack; but pride
forbade&mdash;to any other man he might have offered his
services, but not to General Crack.</p>

<p>Gloomily he wondered if he could bring off the bargain he had
come to make; Pons had been so rudely discouraging, and that
outrageous suggestion about the Princess Eleanora!</p>

<p>A mere feint, no doubt, but the very hint had stung because
Hensdorff knew that there had been recently a hitch in the
Imperial negotiations with Anhalt-Dessau. Was it possible that
the shifty prince was bargaining secretly with General Crack?</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau was important, not in himself (a fussy little
pedant, thought Hensdorff) but because he represented the
Protestant interest in Germany, one so necessary for the Emperor,
in his present precarious position, to conciliate, and he had
many powerful connections and relations with whom he had
contrived to keep on good terms, and his daughter was heiress to
many of these childless families; a marriage with her would add
many tempting appanages to the Imperial Crown.</p>

<p>Hensdorff cursed the Archduchess Maria Luisa for not being
more beautiful; even in the miniature he had left with Pons, with
all the help of roses, pearls and gauze, she made no very
creditable figure.</p>

<p>Only two portions of the Château were disused; the chapel and
the theatre; the first because General Crack, bred a Romanist,
and recently under the influence of Jesuits, had now become a
Lutheran (though he paid small attention to any faith and
occupied the scant time he gave to spiritual affairs with
astrologers) and the second because his morals had lately become
austere, and the coquettish actresses and elegant dancers that
had lately adorned his Château had been packed off to Paris, not
without some regrets and many spoils.</p>

<p>Hensdorff put these two facts together; he thought they
indicated a serious bid for the hand of a Protestant and modest
princess.</p>

<p>Morosely he gazed down into the chapel; he had opened a small
door in a corridor and found himself in a box handsomely
furnished with red damask and mirrors, and enclosed with windows
of greenish glass hung with blue silk curtains; these looked
directly down onto the altar and provided a comfortable retreat
against the dullest of sermons or the longest of prayers.</p>

<p>The chapel was empty and rather dusty; the Romish appointments
had not been removed. Hensdorff peered down onto vacant tasselled
chairs, black and livid pictures of martyrdoms, an altar loaded
with tarnished silver, the whole lit by rather fine windows
filled with pillaged glass of considerable antiquity.</p>

<p>A gloomy spectacle for Count Michael Hensdorff, who, if a
lukewarm Romanist, loathed the Lutherans and was prepared any
moment to be fiercely zealous for the Pope, if it might mean a
chance of doing a mischief to the Protestants.</p>

<p>He was touched on the shoulder, and turned suspiciously to see
a young officer in a fantastic Croatian uniform behind him; he
knew this youth to be a Captain Banning high in favour with
General Crack, and, despite his Eastern finery, a Swede.</p>

<p>Hensdorff detested foreigners and it seemed to him that he
never met any one else.</p>

<p>"This is a very melancholy spot," remarked Captain Banning
civilly. "I have been sent to find you and offer you some
entertainment, my dear Count&mdash;seeing the door open I looked
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing entertains me," replied Hensdorff truthfully. "I'm
here on business, which I daresay you know all about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel Pons told me," smiled the Swede. He was a heavy,
plain young man, on whom the extravagant uniform sat rather ill,
and so fair that his eyebrows were the same colour as his
powdered hair. "Would you not care to visit the menagerie, or the
fish ponds, or the stables, the music gallery, or the
theatre?"</p>

<p>"No," refused Hensdorff bluntly. "I'm too old for toys; and
never had much interest in such things."</p>

<p>"Well, after all, what else is there in life?" asked Captain
Banning genially. "These toys, as you call them, are but
evidences of power, and if you do not care for power you must he
either a saint or a fool."</p>

<p>Hensdorff continued to peer down into the deserted chapel.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think General Crack a great man?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You also think him a great man, or you would not be
here."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Hensdorff drily. "My master thinks him a
successful man and therefore deigns to notice him; as for me, I
am a mere messenger. I would rather," he added harshly, "be a
menial in the Imperial service, than the favourite of a mercenary
adventurer."</p>

<p>Captain Banning did not appear offended at this frankness.</p>

<p>"Well, take care it <i>is</i> the Imperial service," he said.
"If your man falls, he'll be no better than an adventurer
himself. Come, this is a dusty, melancholic place; we may employ
the time till supper more profitably. There are eighty horses in
the stables, Germans, Ukraines and English&mdash;the gardens have
been designed by Bibbiena, though we have had them brought up to
date&mdash;the house, like Mölk, is by Prandauer&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hensdorff interrupted:</p>

<p>"I understand that you have been sent to distract and dazzle
me, Captain Banning, but pray spare your pains. I am here with an
ill will and not to be coaxed into a good humour."</p>

<p>Captain Banning laughed.</p>

<p>"If you dislike my master so much, how will you tolerate him
flourishing in Vienna if he becomes the Emperor's
brother-in-law?"</p>

<p>"God knows," said Hensdorff.</p>

<p>The Swede regarded him keenly.</p>

<p>"You remember Wallenstein?" he said. "He drove a bargain with
an Emperor. A hard bargain. He saved the Empire on his own
terms."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, what about this musty story?" asked Hensdorff,
moving impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well," added Captain Banning, "when the Emperor had no longer
need of him he had him murdered in his camp. As a revenge for
that hard bargain."</p>

<p>Hensdorff's face was immovable; just a shade too
immovable.</p>

<p>"Bah, those were barbarous days," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I've always understood," said Captain Banning, "that your
master and my master hated each other&mdash;so if the Emperor, as
you call him, offers his sister to General Crack, he must be in
great need of his services&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Admitted," snarled Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and, one may well suspect, will try not to pay for
them," finished the Swede. "But I can tell you this," he
instantly added, "General Crack is not the man to stir without
full payment in advance."</p>

<p>"This Château is evidence of as much," sneered Hensdorff.</p>

<p>They left the box in the chapel and Captain Banning took the
Count to see the theatre, which was a charming little structure,
wreathed round and round with gilt garlands, masks and ribbons,
and looped satin curtains in glittering cascades of tinsel
frivolity.</p>

<p>Hensdorff sank yawning into one of the stalls; he did not try
to get any information out of Captain Banning, for he knew that
however stupid that young man looked, he would not say a word
that General Crack did not wish him to say, or do anything that
he had not been instructed to do.</p>

<p>The reference to Wallenstein, now, he had been told to make
that; it meant that General Crack suspected treachery.</p>

<p>Well, of course&mdash;</p>

<p>Hensdorff, bored, yawned in his stall while Banning fidgeted
with the blue satin curtain, pulling it back from the empty stage
set with a scene by Burnacini and lamenting the delicious
<i>troupe</i> that enlivened last spring with <i>opera bouffe</i>
and <i>comédie Italienne</i>&mdash;the Leilas, Silvias and
Fiorinettas...</p>

<p>One of the dancers, he said, a Mlle. Foulché, was really
entrancing&mdash;like a snowdrop, as you saw them glittering
through the air at Småland, where he had lived in his youth.</p>

<p>"And melting as soon, no doubt," suggested Hensdorff. "You
must miss these diversions, Captain Banning; it seems a very idle
life here."</p>

<p>"Oh, we keep in good practice, and I suppose we shall be soon
fighting again; if not on your side, the other," and the Swede
idly caressed a tattered tinsel Pulchinello he had found tossed
on the dusty stage.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hensdorff, "if your master is hoping to make a
party for himself by joining the Lutherans and marrying the
Anhalt-Dessau girl, he's deceived, for matters there are settled
with the Emperor."</p>

<p>After having uttered this round lie, Hensdorff yawned again;
he felt a sudden sense of futility amounting to mental nausea;
the deserted chapel, the empty theatre, had affected him with
gloom; he dwelt on all this buying and selling of tarnished
commodities with disgust; every one was base and dealt in base
coin, and how stupid the prizes were for which all contended!</p>

<p>He almost resolved to leave the stale game and retire to his
estates in Moldavia, but he knew the while that he never would do
so; he was caught up in the inconstant whirlpool and must go
round and round till he died of weariness.</p>

<p>To be kicking his heels here, waiting the pleasure of General
Crack, he with his hundred quarterings and his pure descent!
Never had there been such a time when everything was so upside
down.</p>

<p>He tried to fix his thoughts on something agreeable: the
Emperor had promised him The Golden Fleece if he succeeded in
winning over General Crack, and even, if he made a very good
bargain, to create him a Count of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<p>But even these promised rewards did not afford Hensdorff much
pleasure.</p>

<p>The empty theatre oppressed him; that barren stage, the
trophies of Scaramuccia, that pale daylight which filtered
through the glass cupola, the vacant chairs, and the young man in
his ostentatious uniform fooling with a grinning bauble, all
these things annoyed Count Hensdorff.</p>

<p>His heavy face, that looked sickly in the gloom, drooped into
an expression of sullen mockery.</p>

<p>"We might go into the air," he suggested, "it's heavy here.
I'm sorry to keep your master shut up, as I suppose he must be
shut up for fear of meeting me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he is in bed," replied Captain Banning, leading the way
out of the theatre. "He twisted his foot getting out of his
coach, and yesterday he was bled twice&mdash;on these occasions
he lives on barley broth and cider and gets very low."</p>

<p>"I've come at an ill moment, then," sneered Hensdorff,
suspecting a trick.</p>

<p>"To-day he is nearly recovered, and no doubt in the best of
tempers&mdash;but yesterday he was very angry with Pons."
Hensdorff was glad to hear that.</p>

<p>"And he ordered one of the Uhlans to be hanged for
insubordination," added Banning. "But we waited till to-day for
the execution in case he changes his mind."</p>

<p>Hensdorff said that he did not care if all the Uhlans were
hanged and all the Croats and Heydukes, too; it would be only so
many the less rogues to plague the world with. Captain Banning
agreed, but reasoned that there were not so many stout fellows,
well trained, that one could afford to lose even one.</p>

<p>They came out onto one of the terraces at the back of the
Château and looked across a noble rolling champaign, watered by
the Danube and bounded by low mountains, now tinged with a tender
purple against a translucent sunlit sky of faint green, like sea
water in a calm.</p>

<p>Immediately below the terraces was the shell-shaped basin of a
fountain, where the water was thrown up like a tossing plume of
silver feathers, and fell, in a glittering cascade, over the lip
of the basin, like a silver veil.</p>

<p>By this fountain three Nubian pages were chattering, while
they sucked sugar sticks so that their blubber lips glistened
with melted sweetness; one held a stand on which was a snowy
cockatoo that raised continually a sweeping crest of sulphur
yellow, as the negroes annoyed it with their quick gabble.</p>

<p>"A lovely prospect," said Captain Banning.</p>

<p>But Hensdorff wanted to know why General Crack did not live in
Pomerania, or Kurland, countries which were so devoted to him,
and Banning pointed to one of the valleys opposite and said that
the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau often stayed there with the Duchess
of Schönbuchel.</p>

<p>"I daresay you would now relish your supper," he added, "and
then you may early to bed, to shorten your period of waiting.
Lieutenant Ferdinand Gabor will be of our company; he always
speaks of you with kindness and is well affected to your
Emperor."</p>

<p>Hensdorff felt more and more suspicious at all this; Gabor was
a Transylvanian, a descendant on the left hand of Prince Bethlen
Gabor, very much reduced in circumstances and entirely damaged in
character; an able and a perilous, a cynic and a subtle man.
Hensdorff had thought of buying him, but reflected that he was
too untrustworthy, too fickle to be worth any money.</p>

<p>"I have got," he thought, "into a fine nest of
scoundrels."</p>

<p>Colonel Pons welcomed them at the supper table, which was set
in the pleasant evening light by the window where they had
dined.</p>

<p>He was sorry that he had not yet been able to see General
Crack, he declared, but promised an answer by the morning.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor, who claimed a princely rank but who appeared
to prefer the simple title of Lieutenant ("Of what army?"
Hensdorff asked himself.) was seated on the left of the Imperial
messenger.</p>

<p>He was a thin, swarthy, handsome man, faultlessly dressed, but
he had a look of ruin; his eyes were, in an odd way, ashy in hue;
his spirits seemed spent. He fawned on Hensdorff, but dully, as
if he was too used to fawn mechanically on everybody.</p>

<p>Glibly he wished success to the Count's mission, and suavely
he drank the health of the young Archduchess. Colonel Pons, who
appeared to dislike him, rather brusquely changed the subject,
speaking of a hunting party arranged for the next Tuesday which
he hoped Count Hensdorff would honour with his presence.</p>

<p>"Nay," replied that gentleman, "I must take my answer and
begone."</p>

<p>"With a picture of General Crack for the Archduchess," smiled
Gabor slily, at which his colleagues laughed derisively, but
Hensdorff kept his gloomy countenance.</p>

<p>"It is all very well for you to laugh," he sneered, "but
things change very rapidly these times. You are all snug now, but
the time may come when you will be glad of a word from me to the
Emperor."</p>

<p>"Well, we shan't get it, I know," answered Colonel Pons. "And
I, for one, shan't ask for it. I mean to die in my last
battle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How," asked Hensdorff, "will you know it is your last battle?
In every encounter you will save yourself for the next till you
are too decrepit to stir abroad."</p>

<p>"I hope," remarked Gabor smoothly, licking his lean lips,
"that we shall be all fighting on the same side, Count
Hensdorff."</p>

<p>The Transylvanian bowed over his wine; Hensdorff looked at him
with disgust; it would be revolting if he ever had to league with
such creatures. Gabor affected not to see the disdainful glance
and enquired after the Emperor, as he made no ado to call him;
his health, temper and activities.</p>

<p>"He is well enough," said Hensdorff, "but fretful at times,
being so beset."</p>

<p>"General Crack is never fretful," remarked Captain Banning,
"but always preserves his composure."</p>

<p>"That is no sign of greatness, as you seem to think," replied
Hensdorff, "but a mere affectation intended to impress the meaner
sort, 'tis a trick to keep a cold countenance, and requires no
other attribute than a hard conscience. The Emperor is a man of
feeling, of honour and delicacy, it is to his credit that he is
often disturbed."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Pons. "It is to his credit, I suppose, that he is
a ninny? Come, Count, let us talk sense the little time we are
together. I took a peep at your Archduchess; the artist was
skilful."</p>

<p>"For my part," declared Gabor, "I always thought Maria Luisa a
very charming princess."</p>

<p>But he made the compliment in such a manner that the other two
soldiers laughed grossly, and Hensdorff felt a tingle of angry
blood in his cheek.</p>

<p>At this dangerous point in the conversation a lackey entered
and respectfully told Colonel Pons that General Crack wished to
see him immediately.</p>

<p>The Colonel hastily left his unfinished supper and hurried
away without apology. Hensdorff sat sullen between Banning and
Gabor and occupied himself with his food.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="first">THE apartments of General Crack were in the left
of the Château beyond the theatre, on the ground floor; they were
approached by a guardroom with stars of bayonets on the walls and
a design of pistols on the ceiling, where four Uhlans sat in
full-fed leisure.</p>

<p>Beyond was an antechamber from which opened a laboratory, for
General Crack was of a scientific turn, and then another room
full of maps, terrestrial and celestial globes, small models of
forts and a miniature park of artillery, together with a library
of military books from Xenophon to Cartelius.</p>

<p>Here sat Herr Lippmann, the astrologer and alchemist, who
looked like an unfrocked priest.</p>

<p>This was exactly what he was; he had been expelled from the
Order of Jesuits for some reason so trivial that he never
troubled to mention it; he had a great deal of skill in his
present profession, and was of an amiable disposition; he had
been useful to General Crack in several capacities and considered
himself well provided for life with a comfortable
position&mdash;as far as one ever could consider oneself provided
for in these decayed times.</p>

<p>He kept on agreeable terms with the other favourites of his
master and had been able, at one time or another, to make
himself, in one way or another, useful to most of the inmates of
the Château; for he refused no work and his fees were low.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons passed him, with a quick greeting, and hurried,
with his strutting way and important air, into the next room.</p>

<p>This was the bedchamber of General Crack, and very luxuriously
appointed; the ceiling was painted with a cloud of goddesses
whose charms were by no means obscured by the flowery vapours
through which they floated, and the tapestries on the walls
represented a series of heroic engagements where the victors were
generously rewarded with laurels, rushed from an approving Heaven
by amiable angels, and more substantial pleasures obligingly
dispensed by earthly charmers with loosened robes and enticing
gestures.</p>

<p>These agreeable battle pieces were interspersed with female
portraits fancifully bedecked; between the two windows was an
alabaster statue of a Saint, that had been preserved even after
the reformation in the religion of her master, not because she
was that rather fabulous creature, <i>A Virgin Martyr</i>, but
because she was a very pretty woman with a very shapely
figure.</p>

<p>There was a profusion of mirrors scrolled round with gold,
chairs with satin covers that gleamed into posies of silk
blossoms, curtains with rich fringes, a carpet that was a very
summer of roses, and hanging crystal lamps that glittered like
constellations on a frosty night.</p>

<p>There was present a doctor, a page, a barber and two very
elegant apes, but these were all silent in their several places
for the brocade curtains of General Crack's bed remained
closed.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Colonel Pons discreetly paused; he knew that his
master, like all great men, had his moods and humours and was not
afraid to indulge them; if, in public, he cultivated, with great
effect, a dark and icy indifference of demeanour, his intimates
and dependents were familiar with a more human aspect of his
character.</p>

<p>"His Highness," said the doctor with decorum, "prefers to lie
in the dark, but he is awake and you may speak to him through the
curtains."</p>

<p>"I was sent for," replied Colonel Pons, eyeing the bed with
respect. "I hope my presence is still required&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is," conceded the doctor. "Pray be seated; when His
Highness desires to do so, he will speak to you."</p>

<p>Colonel Pons rather gingerly took one of the frail looking
chairs, folded his hands on his rotund person, turned his bulging
blue eyes towards the bed, and waited.</p>

<p>This bed was in the centre of the room and closely curtained
on all four sides with rose cloth of gold; at each corner a
panache of azure plumes brushed the rosy bodies of the goddesses
on the ceiling; the two bed steps were of polished chestnut
wood.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons waited; he was inured to this sort of thing;
moods, whims, caprices&mdash;"like a girl," he thought viciously,
"lying there, sulking, I suppose, because he's sick&mdash;"</p>

<p>But whatever his thoughts, he held himself very humbly, for he
did not know that General Crack might not be looking at him
through a chink in the bed curtains.</p>

<p>The page cuffed the apes, who dared to chatter on their
cushions, and the barber crept into the adjoining closet where he
began to mix hair lotions in a marble basin; faintly came the
sound of the bottles clinking one against the other.</p>

<p>"Is Your Highness awake?" ventured the doctor, fingering a
phial of rich thick medicine.</p>

<p>A voice answered from the bed:</p>

<p>"Yes, but I want no more of that concoction, Doctor."</p>

<p>Pons congratulated himself on the correctness of his
expression, since it was now obvious that General Crack could see
everything in the room.</p>

<p>"It is an excellent and potent physic," remarked the doctor
regretfully, "containing fifty rare ingredients&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And all of them devilish in taste and action," replied the
voice. "I'll have no more plasters, bleedings, doses or pills for
a mere wrenched ankle&mdash;Pons, what did Hensdorff say?"</p>

<p>"Shall I draw the curtain, sir?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"No, I prefer the dark. I can hear you and you can hear me,
and what more is required for a conversation?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir," replied Pons; he attributed this whim to
vanity; General Crack was suspected of thinking a great deal of
his appearance and probably did not wish to be seen when this was
at a disadvantage; his accident had not been severe, but he had
been something reduced by potions, bleedings, and close
confinement.</p>

<p>His voice, however, sounded amiable enough. It was a most
agreeable voice, though rather expressionless, with a French
accent.</p>

<p>"Hensdorff," said Colonel Pons, "has come with a very
desperate offer from the Elector of Bavaria, whom he calls 'the
Emperor,' and requires an immediate answer."</p>

<p>"He shall have it&mdash;no offer of his is likely to require
thinking over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. I expect, sir, you'll be a little
surprised."</p>

<p>"Shall I, Pons?"</p>

<p>"He offers his sister, the Archduchess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The lame one?"</p>

<p>"Maria Luisa. With the title of Archduke as dowry."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Your Highness knows they've got nothing else." Silence from
behind the bed curtains.</p>

<p>"Of course, <i>if</i> they succeeded, the thing would be very
handsome, no doubt. On the steps of the throne&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice interrupted:</p>

<p>"When I'd smashed the Allies they'd find an excuse for backing
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naturally the marriage would take place before the campaign
opened," said Pons. "Hensdorff is as full of tricks as ever; he
told Banning one round lie at least. He said the Emperor had
settled with Anhalt-Dessau."</p>

<p>"For his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has, behind my back. Anhalt-Dessau is <i>capable
de tout</i>."</p>

<p>"And so, sir, is Hensdorff. I told him you were sure of the
lady."</p>

<p>"And that," said the voice with sudden weariness, "was another
lie, Pons."</p>

<p>"Not so deep a one as his, I daresay, Monseigneur. Well,
that's his offer, neither more nor less. And I was to give Your
Highness the picture of the Archduchess, as they name her, and a
letter from her brother."</p>

<p>"I believe I saw her once, Pons, but not thinking of her in
this way, did not notice her. Give me her picture&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It does more credit to the painter than the sitter, but if
you took her it would hardly be for her beauty, so it is less
matter."</p>

<p>A hand, half hidden in a lace ruffle tied with a black ribbon,
came out between the folds of brocade and took box and letter; it
was then withdrawn, and Pons heard the curtains being pulled
apart on the far side of the bed.</p>

<p>"They have made the best of a plain woman," remarked General
Crack. "A bitter contrast to the others, eh, Pons? It's
no&mdash;and no&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew the curtains together, letting miniature and letter
fall on the bed step while he sank back on his pillows in
darkness again.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons, despite his bravado to Hensdorff, was slightly
alarmed at this summary rejection of the Imperial offer, because
he knew that his master had received nothing so solid from any
one else and that the Anhalt-Dessau affair was in a very dubious
condition; Pons believed, in fact, that it was really much more
likely that the disputed girl would be given to the Emperor than
to the mercenary soldier&mdash;to General Crack&mdash;Captain
Fracasse!</p>

<p>"I am to say 'no' to Hensdorff, then, sir?" he asked
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Say 'no,'" repeated the weary voice from the bed. "I will not
fight under Hensdorff's Emperor&mdash;rather, I will make my own
Caesar."</p>

<p>"That will be a defiance."</p>

<p>"So I mean it. We always disliked each other, more than once
he slighted me&mdash;at Belgrade, for instance. Neither do I
trust weak men."</p>

<p>Pons screwed up his mouth.</p>

<p>"Who are we to fight for, then?" he asked. "It is true that
there are two other emperors in the field, but neither so likely
as this one. Your Highness never cared for the Queen of Hungary's
husband nor for the King of Spain."</p>

<p>"We can wait. Let every one declare his play; I will reserve
mine. It's too early yet to wager on the winning side, Pons."</p>

<p>"Your Highness will not reflect on it till the morning?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Pons came round the bed and picked up the rejected miniature
and the letter that was unopened.</p>

<p>He admired his master for this arrogant attitude, but it made
him rather nervous. Although he followed rocketing fortunes, he
was a cautious man; he would have liked to have tormented
Hensdorff to the last but in that last he would have accepted his
offer, which was, after all, something clear and definite, while
everything else was a mass of chaotic intrigue; and though Pons
sneered at the Emperor, he was secretly impressed by the man the
King of France had recognized as Imperial Caesar.</p>

<p>On this pause the doctor offered a scrap of his wisdom.</p>

<p>"His Highness is probably fatigued, and now inclined for his
physic."</p>

<p>General Crack laughed behind the curtains.</p>

<p>"Give it to the apes, my dear Doctor, their contortions may
amuse you. And good night, Pons. Show that fox Hensdorff all
civility, and don't leave him alone with Gabor."</p>

<p>"Gabor knows nothing."</p>

<p>"But he might invent something dangerous. Hensdorff must leave
early to-morrow. Where is his Emperor?"</p>

<p>"At Vienna&mdash;the Hofburg."</p>

<p>"Well, some day I may be at Vienna&mdash;the Hofburg. Good
night, Pons."</p>

<p>The Colonel bowed to the bed curtains and then to the doctor,
and left the room. In the antechamber he lingered by the table of
the astrologer, who was neatly working out a table of
gibberish.</p>

<p>Pons, having no belief in anything, was always ready to be
credulous of everything, and cautiously sinking his voice, he
asked Herr Lippmann if he had recently consulted the stars on
behalf of General Crack.</p>

<p>"Regularly," replied the sage, "though His Highness doesn't
take the interest that he used to take&mdash;a pity."</p>

<p>"You don't find any threatened fall in his fortunes?"
whispered Pons, lowering his purple face close to Herr Lippmann's
flaccid countenance. "For he seems to me to presume rather beyond
prudence&mdash;"</p>

<p>The astrologer was not to be betrayed into revealing the
verdict of the stars; he gave a vacant look at the diagram before
him and remarked:</p>

<p>"A very extraordinary man, not for a moment to be
doubted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so," said Pons. "I admire him greatly,
myself; still, these times, and he carries it rather
flourishingly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Herr Lippmann, "watch me. When I leave this
place you'll know I've found a better one&mdash;as long as I stay
here you may doubt if there is any such thing."</p>

<p>Colonel Pons returned to the <i>salon</i>, where he had left
his three companions.</p>

<p>The supper was now over, the candles lit, the room full of
smoke. Banning was on the green silk sofa, pulling at his pipe;
he appeared to be too intoxicated to care to talk, and seemed to
be failing asleep. Michael Hensdorff and Gabor were talking
earnestly together at the table; the lean Transylvanian was alert
and keen, Hensdorff playing with his polished signet ring.</p>

<p>Pons, recalling the command not to leave these two alone
together, glanced indignantly at Banning, who smiled fatuously in
return. Pons could not think what his master saw in the
Swede.</p>

<p>He sat down deliberately between Hensdorff and Gabor, who
seemed quite at ease.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got your answer," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have?" The Imperial messenger stroked his pendulous
nose. "And a disagreeable one, no doubt."</p>

<p>"What I told you to expect. No."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was calm, but his yellow face expressed bitter
contempt.</p>

<p>"No compliments?" he asked. "No courtesies? That one bare
word?"</p>

<p>"As many compliments and courtesies as you care to invent, but
that's the sum of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put the miniature box and the letter on the table; when he
saw that the last was unopened, Hensdorff scowled: "This is
insolence&mdash;a base-born&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gabor lightly seized his arm.</p>

<p>"My dear Count! That fool on the sophy, who appears so drunk,
will report every word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And who are you to warn him of it?" asked Pons heatedly.</p>

<p>"And what do I care if he does?" cried Hensdorff, rising
violently. "My one regret is that I cannot tell your master to
his face my opinion of him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Gabor endeavoured to restrain him.</p>

<p>"A question of management, surely a question of management,
you heard my little suggestions just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Gabor!" cried Pons. "Keep out of this. His Highness
said that Hensdorff was to be treated with all civility. There's
nothing more to be said."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" sneered Hensdorff. "You'll all have something to say
about it, some day, I expect."</p>

<p>Gabor, who paid no attention to Pons, handed the miniature to
Hensdorff with a bow.</p>

<p>"Not the least slight is intended to the lady," he smiled.
"Pray make that clear&mdash;we all hold her in the highest
respect, General Crack himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be damned to your General Crack&mdash;he had another name in
Poland&mdash;General&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Gabor lightly put his lean fingers over the offending
mouth of Hensdorff, and Pons touched his sword with an offended
air.</p>

<p>"You don't wan't a fracas, my dear Count, I'm sure," said the
Transylvanian quickly. "That is such a stupid way of settling
matters."</p>

<p>Hensdorff controlled himself and returned the letter and
picture to the big flap pocket in which they had travelled from
Vienna.</p>

<p>"I'll leave early in the morning," he announced with a
reaction to deep weariness. "After all, what does any of it
matter? Colonel Pons, if I might have a lackey to show me to my
chamber?"</p>

<p>He looked round at the three of them; a man defeated and at
bay, but not a man humbled&mdash;indeed, they felt him to be
their superior.</p>

<p>With ceremony he took his leave, and, by the time he had
reached his magnificent bedroom, he had begun to take heart
again, for he had turned with approval to the suggestion made by
Lieutenant Gabor.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">HENSDORFF, a man of sedentary habits, fatigued
by an uncommon journey and a vexatious day, slept late, so there
was no early departure; he breakfasted in his chamber, with
luxury and discontent, reflecting on his three companions of last
night.</p>

<p>Pons, the Hanoverian, and Banning, the Swede, were useless to
him, he knew; for one reason or another they were entirely
attached to General Crack; but it was impossible for Gabor to be
faithful to any one&mdash;he was nervous and jibbing at the
effrontery of his master; adroit and subtle as he was, he might
be of some service.</p>

<p>The suggestion that he had made, last night was by no means a
bad one; not something to be acted upon at once, but something
that might come in very well later on; it would be worth while
making a little present to Gabor to encourage him. Hensdorff had
just that small scrap of comfort to take back to his
master&mdash;that Ferdinand Gabor might be useful.</p>

<p>He thought that he would delay his going in the hope of seeing
Gabor, and seeing him alone; Banning, of course, drunk or sober,
acted as a spy, but if the Transylvanian had any wits he would
surely make an opportunity of seeing him; so Hensdorff left his
room and proceeded cautiously through the large empty chambers of
the Château. There was no one about save lackeys, but the
Imperial messenger knew that it was very likely that he was being
watched.</p>

<p>He looked round quickly to see if he could discover Gabor
lurking in any of the corridors or cabinets, but was
disappointed; at length, however, he saw, across a stately
chamber, the figure of a man on the terrace beyond, leaning on
the balustrade that overlooked the valley of the Danube; this
figure was very erect and slender, and though Hensdorff could not
see the face, he believed that he had found his man.</p>

<p>He advanced across the polished floor, lifted the brocade
curtains, and stepped through the tall windows onto the
terrace.</p>

<p>The man turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>It was not Gabor.</p>

<p>It was a young man, very elaborately attired, who stared
blankly at Hensdorff; a young man who was not only extremely
handsome, but who had taken the greatest pains to make himself
appear more so. Very finely was he appointed with a multitude of
dark ringlets, lightly powdered and buckled with diamonds behind
his neck, with cascades of lace on his bosom, with sash and sword
belt fringed and tasselled and a coat exquisitely cut to show off
his admirable figure.</p>

<p>His features were remarkable for a rare perfection of line and
colour; his full curls, that hung in front of his ears, on his
breast, were carefully arranged to set off his oval face. His
expression was blank; only his eyes, faintly lined beneath,
showed a slight insolence. His air was too austere for a fop, but
for this he would have seemed no more.</p>

<p>Hensdorff surveyed this man, in his magnificent frippery, with
deep contempt; he coldly returned the blank stare with which he
was greeted, and inclining his head, sarcastically said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, General Crack."</p>

<p>"I thought," replied the young man drily, "that you had left
for Vienna."</p>

<p>"Your Highness," remarked Hensdorff with a wry smile, "is
surely better informed of the doings of your guests."</p>

<p>"I am informed only of what interests me," was the cold reply.
"You had your answer, I suppose, Count Hensdorff?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the messenger; he folded his arms, leant
against the window frame and seemed in no hurry to be gone; he
was wondering if this meeting was accidental, and if it was not,
why he had been granted an audience to-day when it had been
refused yesterday; he thought of Gabor with gratitude.</p>

<p>Playing for time, he remarked: "I am sorry that my journey has
been fruitless."</p>

<p>"Your mission was not a happy one," replied General Crack; he
also seemed in no hurry to be gone, but lounged against the
balusters and glanced idly towards the Danube.</p>

<p>Hensdorff was not deceived by his impeccable appearance, so
imposing and stately; he knew that beneath this impressive
interior was the most vulnerable of mortals who bore always at
least one cruel wound.</p>

<p>"There's something in this business I can get him on," thought
Hensdorff. "He's nibbling at something. Gabor has approached
him."</p>

<p>General Crack spoke, with an appearance of cold candour.</p>

<p>"Your terms were not agreeable. You must have seen for
yourself that I lack nothing that your master could give me."</p>

<p>"It was considered," said Hensdorff carefully, "that the hand
of an Archduchess was not such a usual offer to a&mdash;to one
not of royal birth."</p>

<p>General Crack perfectly understood the allusion in this
altered sentence, but his icy look did not falter; he was, in
every way, a man of high courage.</p>

<p>"I was not tempted, Count Hensdorff," he answered in a level
voice. "Pons will have told you that I intend an alliance with
Anhalt-Dessau."</p>

<p>"So does the Emperor, as Your Highness is aware," smiled
Hensdorff. "With deference, I believe he has the better
chance."</p>

<p>The young man moved and Hensdorff saw that the wrenched ankle
had not been a lying tale, for he limped.</p>

<p>"What you said to Gabor he has repeated to me&mdash;as you
intended."</p>

<p>Hensdorff bowed; he felt triumphant&mdash;the fish was
swimming into the net; this interview had not been by chance.</p>

<p>General Crack had waited for him, knowing that he would be
searching for Gabor.</p>

<p>"He said that you hinted the Emperor might withdraw his suit
in exchange for my services."</p>

<p>"Ah, that tempts, does it?" thought Hensdorff. "Now why, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>The young man continued, in the same level voice, with the
French accent slightly emphasized.</p>

<p>"I might consider that&mdash;if I found it true that the
Emperor had the better chance."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Hensdorff suavely. "I spoke without my
master's opinion, he has earnest reasons for desiring that
match&mdash;he also desires your services, and no doubt he could
find some other matrimonial alliance&mdash;there was talk of the
King of England's daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt, but England takes the other side, I think. And as
for the political advantages of the match, if I entered the
Emperor's service, I should bring with me all the Anhalt-Dessau
interest."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was silent, puzzled.</p>

<p>"So, by withdrawing," added General Crack coolly, "your master
would gain me, and all the advantages he would have had by
marrying the Princess Eleanora&mdash;besides, he would be free to
contract some powerful alliance elsewhere."</p>

<p>This was very smooth and agreeable; Hensdorff did not doubt
that he could bring his master round to such terms; but where was
the trick, the snare?</p>

<p>The man who made this offer was not one to do anything for the
advantage of others. Hensdorff decided on that frankness which is
sometimes the most wily diplomacy.</p>

<p>"I do not see the count of Your Highness in this," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"My count is the Anhalt-Dessau marriage."</p>

<p>"But that is not comparable to the marriage you have just
refused."</p>

<p>"It happens that I prefer it."</p>

<p>Hensdorff knew that he would say no more than this, and was
therefore sparing of his own arguments.</p>

<p>"I am, then, to tell the Emperor that if he withdraws from the
Anhalt-Dessau match, your services and the services of the
Lutherans who will be your relations will be at his
disposal?"</p>

<p>"By no means," returned the young man coldly, "for I am not
yet convinced that your master's rivalry is worth buying
off&mdash;I should not take <i>your</i> word for that,
Monseigneur. If it should prove to be so, that is the price I
should offer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But no delay is possible," replied Hensdorff, further soured
by this wariness on the part of his opponent. "The Allies may be
in Flanders in a few weeks and in the Empire in a few months. You
must take your part, sir, at once."</p>

<p>"Anhalt-Dessau is at Dürsheim," said General Crack, glancing
across the silvery valley. "I am going there tomorrow. Do you
care to wait here till I return, within the week? I shall know
then whether I have an offer to make your master or no."</p>

<p>Hensdorff saw that he meant to force Anhalt-Dessau to "yes" or
"no" to the offer for his daughter. Rapidly resolving to use all
influence to make it "no," Hensdorff replied:</p>

<p>"I will wait, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the young man negligently, and saluting
the Imperial messenger briefly, he turned into the grand room and
walked away, stately and indifferent, halting slightly.</p>

<p>Count Michael Hensdorff was both elated and puzzled. He would
regard it as a fine stroke of policy to obtain the services of
the famous soldier and not have to sacrifice the Archduchess, and
he was sure that the Emperor, with whom it had gone ill enough to
have to offer his sister, would be glad to spare his pride at the
price of withdrawal from the Anhalt-Dessau market&mdash;who,
after all, was Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau?</p>

<p>No great prize, surely; of no value at all if General Crack
could bring in the Lutherans.</p>

<p>But where was the spring, the pit?</p>

<p>Why should that ambitious, bold, restless and insatiable young
man refuse the Imperial marriage for a union with a little German
princess? He could have made a better match than that, again and
again, but had always held back in the hope of something more
important.</p>

<p>Hensdorff could not understand the mystery; it would be very
politic in the Emperor to ally himself with the Lutherans through
the Anhalt-Dessau girl, but to a man like General Crack it would
not mean very much; he had, since his conversion, already found
favour with the Lutherans; he had very little to gain from that
marriage, but everything from that with Maria Luisa&mdash;why,
then, had he rejected the one and was prepared to pay a high
price for the other, he who had never sought anything but his own
advantage?</p>

<p>Hensdorff was baffled, and he was not often baffled; he
usually found that a knowledge of human nature was sufficient to
explain most mysteries; a little patience, a little observation,
and there would be revealed the mere humanity at the bottom of
the most acute problem, the ordinary emotion or instinct or lust
of some ordinary man.</p>

<p>And some such simple explanation there must be for this
preference for the Anhalt-Dessau marriage, but Hensdorff could
not find it. That General Crack was in earnest he did not doubt,
for otherwise he would not have made this concession of an
interview, rising and adorning himself for the occasion and
waiting about terraces to make the meeting appear casual so as to
save his pride from suggesting an interview.</p>

<p>And now he, Hensdorff, had to do some waiting about on his own
part, hanging round this dull place for the best part of a week
with men like Banning and Pons; he felt both flat and irritated,
and it was with some relief that he saw Gabor crossing a corridor
with his light and rather stealthy step.</p>

<p>"I've seen your master," Hensdorff greeted him. "And so have
you&mdash;I suppose you made him the suggestion; you hinted last
night&mdash;about the Anhalt-Dessau affair?"</p>

<p>"No need," replied Gabor, flickering his ashy eyes. "Banning
repeated the whole conversation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, he's bitten&mdash;he's off to Dürsheim, and if
he can't get the girl he's prepared to serve the Emperor, if he
can have the field clear."</p>

<p>"I told you that he would," smiled Gabor.</p>

<p>"What's behind it?" whispered Hensdorff; but the Transylvanian
merely laughed; he had a gross and evil laugh. Hensdorff
disgustedly gave up that point and hurried to another. "If you
want this alliance, you must do your best to make Anhalt-Dessau
decide in favour of the Emperor, so that your master will have to
'buy him off.'"</p>

<p>He looked round, afraid of a spying interruption, but Gabor
answered easily:</p>

<p>"That won't be as difficult as you think. I've some news for
you&mdash;your man is coming to Dürsheim <i>incognito</i>."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"True. You see, I am better informed than you are&mdash;His
Imperial Majesty has a strong desire to see the damsel for
himself and press his suit in person."</p>

<p>"Don't fool," cried Hensdorff impatiently. "You really know
this?"</p>

<p>"I have my information from Vienna. I am General Crack's
newsmonger and have many reliable agents."</p>

<p>"With matters as they are, with war breaking, the Empire in
confusion, he leaves Vienna for a flimsy, trashy,
adventure&mdash;but it is like him," added Hensdorff, changing
his violent speech to a tone of deep bitterness;&mdash;"these
Jacks in the saddle, these boys in office! Curse his father for
dying and leaving him on my hands!"</p>

<p>"But this serves well," Gabor suggested. "Anhalt-Dessau will
hardly resist Caesar in person&mdash;and the two will meet on
neutral ground and can surely come to a bargain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you anxious that they should?" demanded Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"Yes. I would rather follow both together than either
separately. I think if they unite we may see a solid
empire&mdash;if they don't, well, ruin, and the foreigners
getting all the spoils."</p>

<p>"That is exactly the case," urged Hensdorff. "Men like Banning
and Pons can't see it. They think their master can stand alone.
He can't. And I don't think the Allies will bid for him."</p>

<p>Gabor, able scoundrel as he was, was not to be drawn when he
did not wish to be drawn.</p>

<p>"That is not my province. But you can rely on me to help you
in the Anhalt-Dessau business&mdash;and I hope the Emperor will
remember it when General Crack is advancing at the head of his
armies."</p>

<p>"You'll not be left out," sneered Hensdorff. "You never have
been, have you? But I have my spies, too, Prince; I'll soon know
if you side-step."</p>

<p>Gabor merely smiled; behind him was a coat of arms on a florid
shield, carved in the blue-veined marble; three collared goats'
heads as crest. Gabor's dry finger traced the name carved on a
ribbon round this escutcheon: Christian Rudolph Augustus
Christopher Ketlar.</p>

<p>"If you trust me as far as I trust you, we shall get on very
well together," he remarked, then bowed and passed on.</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not, of course, trust him at all; but he
believed the piece of information Gabor had just given him,
because there would have been no sense in the invention of that
bit of news.</p>

<p>It was rather humiliating to discover that General Crack had
such an excellent service of espionage that he could find out a
thing like that; but then, the Emperor was not very
skilful&mdash;at anything.</p>

<p>When all was in such a critical condition, to abandon alike
the cabinet and the field, and go wandering off to Dürsheim like
a romantic idiot of a student...</p>

<p>Hensdorff was disgusted; he thought that he, too, would go,
under some excuse, to Dürsheim, to keep his eye on the unstable
youth he called master and to clinch the bargain between him and
General Crack.</p>

<p>He agreed with Gabor; if the Emperor and General Crack did not
work together, there was an end of the Empire, if indeed there
was not an end already; Leopold might have been elected at
Frankfurt and approved by France, but where were his
dominions?</p>

<p>Even his native patrimony of Bavaria was overrun; after eight
years' war the Allies were everywhere in the ascendant. The late
Emperor had clearly died of vexation and being harried from place
to place; he had had a brief period of success when he had
seduced General Crack from the French to fight for him, but that
adventurer had soon deserted the Imperial cause and joined the
Queen of Hungary&mdash;he, Hensdorff reflected sourly, was the
only person who had made anything out of the war; he had been
crammed with bribes and spoils, besides inheriting a vast fortune
from his father, a prince who had been fortunate enough to be
Viceroy of Naples and Paymaster of the Imperial forces.</p>

<p>Yes, it looked very unpleasant for the Empire, Hensdorff
thought; but, at the same time, the Allies were exhausted too,
Holland had always been reluctant to fight and the war was
unpopular in England. If they could hold out a little longer,
give them one or two smashing lessons like Haberfeldt&mdash;</p>

<p>Hensdorff ventured to dream of Leopold on a secure throne,
with himself as first Minister, a solid place where he could
exercise power and pick up plunder; surely he had waited long
enough!</p>

<p>He dined with Pons and Banning, and asked them both, flatly,
why their master was set on the Anhalt-Dessau marriage?</p>

<p>Of course he did not expect the truth from them, even if they
knew the truth, which was doubtful, but he often got something
useful out of the lies people told and the way they told
them.</p>

<p>The bulging blue eyes of Pons expressed vacuity.</p>

<p>"I suppose it secures a large interest," he answered.</p>

<p>"There are so many connections, and all powerful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah," interrupted Hensdorff, "there's nothing there that will
help <i>him</i>; the Archduchess is the biggest prize <i>he</i>
could have hoped for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Banning interrupted.</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?"</p>

<p>"Seen her?"</p>

<p>"The Princess Eleanora."</p>

<p>"No." Hensdorff took no interest in the personalities of these
poor little pieces in the game he played; they had no wills of
their own, no choice in their destinies, why trouble about them?
"I ascertained that she was healthy," he added. "What about
her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing about her," answered Banning indifferently. "I only
wondered if you had seen her."</p>

<p>"Has she any influence over her father?" asked Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"Not in the least, she is terrified of him."</p>

<p>"Then it is no use taking any notice of her," said Hensdorff
impatiently, believing that Banning had spoken thus to lead him
away from his question; to which, however, he returned:</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't know, Captain Banning, why your master is
set on this match?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Swede, with an odd look and smile. "Oh,
no!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">HERR LIPPMANN sat at his window; it was a clear
night, and he was supposed to be observing the stars, which made
a magnificent sparkle in the pellucid dark heavens; in his black
gown and flat velvet hat, with his large-featured face composed
to gravity and his straight grey locks, he looked very imposing
and grand, the image of a meditating philosopher. He was, indeed,
sufficiently a philosopher to know that nothing could be gained
by stargazing and that while on this planet it was wiser to be
occupied with this planet's affairs.</p>

<p>So, while he blinked up through his horn glasses at the
clustering constellations, with his elbow on sheets of complex
diagrams and symbols, a globe before him and a skull behind him
on the window shelf, he was wondering what he could do to
stimulate General Crack's interest in astrology, which appeared
to be waning; also, if he could persuade the General to give him
more comfortable quarters, for this corner room, supposed to be
very suitable to a sage, was lonely and draughty.</p>

<p>His impressive attitude was due to the fact that he was
expecting a visit from Colonel Pons, who had suddenly discovered
an interest in the stars, on a broad hint from Herr Lippmann that
something very fortunate for himself had been read in the vast
chart of the heavens.</p>

<p>Midnight, the astrologer declared, would be the correct time
to explain and demonstrate the Colonel's horoscope, which he had
been lately casting. He hoped, while thus amusing the soldier,
skilfully to extract from him some information about the moods
and projects of his master, so that he might trim his conduct
accordingly; of late His Highness had ignored him, and seldom had
he had a chance of an interview with General Crack.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, considerably, if agreeably, surprised when
the door opened to admit, not Colonel Pons, but His Highness
himself.</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann hastily rose, and bowed respectfully. General
Crack threw himself into the worn leather chair near the window;
he was silent, and seeing his lowering glance, the astrologer did
not speak either.</p>

<p>The room was dark and lofty, hung with grey serge and fitted
with odd gloomy paraphernalia of mummied birds, sills, retorts, a
low furnace, and some maps, which appeared to be of the infernal
regions; the light came from a dim lamp and from the stars that
showed in such a sweep of splendour through the wide-open
window.</p>

<p>The young man who had just entered wore his chamber robe over
a shirt open at the throat; his hair hung neglected. He bore the
signs of much disorder, and appeared absorbed in disturbing
thoughts.</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann observed him covertly, and was impressed, as he
never failed to be impressed, by his beauty, so complete, so
virile and magnificent.</p>

<p>General Crack looked up, supporting his face in his right
hand.</p>

<p>"Pons is not coming," he remarked. "I stopped his
folly&mdash;to indulge in it myself."</p>

<p>"Your Highness has come to consult the stars?" asked the
astrologer with deference.</p>

<p>"No. All about me are rogues, but I think you are the wisest
rogue," mused the young man.</p>

<p>The astrologer bowed again.</p>

<p>"Lippmann," asked His Highness, and his words rose to his lips
in a surge of passion, "who am I?"</p>

<p>"Prince Christian of Kurland," was the ready reply.</p>

<p>"You are well schooled. Who calls me that behind my back?
Banning heard another name on Hensdorff's lips&mdash;Gabor
stopped it, but what's the use? They all think it&mdash;I heard
it in Poland&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," said Herr Lippmann, "you are surely one of the
most fortunate of men. Why dwell on your few displeasures?"</p>

<p>"I could not sleep to-night, and it is not the first night
either, this ankle and the physician's brews have had me much
reduced&mdash;I toss and dream while yet awake. I have been
fevered, Lippmann."</p>

<p>The astrologer greatly marvelled at these confidences but
resolved to make his profit from them. Well he knew the rankling
wound that galled the young man&mdash;every one knew
it&mdash;this famous soldier, this handsome cavalier was base
born; he had no name save such as was accorded him by the
courtesy or the fear of men. Son of a prince and a strolling
wanton&mdash;a poor Columbine of the <i>Comédie</i> at
Naples&mdash;there in a sentence was his tragedy; never mentioned
to his face, but ever present in the minds of all who dealt with
him; ever present in his own mind, too, through all his fame, his
power, his success.</p>

<p>His father, after two fruitless marriages, had acknowledged
him, had doted on his bravery and beauty, had left him all he
could leave him&mdash;but not the throne of Kurland. The young
man might call himself Ketlar, but the ancient heritage of the
Ketlars was not his; Kurland had been annexed by Russia; the
family of Ketlar was regarded as extinct.</p>

<p>Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, he had the right to call
himself Prince Christian of Kurland, but scornfully refused to
use the name half Europe scornfully denied him, and bore the
title under which he had made his great renown, General Crack, an
anagram of his baptismal names, Christian Rudolph Augustus
Christopher Ketlar.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," reflected Herr Lippmann, "has the power to
make yourself what you please."</p>

<p>"I have not the power," was the reply, "to make myself born in
marriage."</p>

<p>The astrologer wondered that he should speak of this and felt
a little afraid; disgrace and dismissal might be the result of
being the recipient of the confidences of General Crack, but the
moment would not be denied. As the other continued speaking with
obvious if transient sincerity, Herr Lippmann lost the sense of
their mutual relationship; he, too, became sincere; it was a
young man opening his heart to an old man in the quiet of the
night, amid a sleeping household, with the stars seeming very
near through that wide-set window.</p>

<p>General Crack had dependents, flatterers, companions, but no
friends; he was a born leader of men and his influence was
powerful on all who knew him, but his position had made him
arrogant in self-defence; his inferiors were jealous of his good
fortune and his superiors disdained his pretensions; nor was he,
by nature, affable. Therefore, a long loneliness had always
surrounded his anguished pride.</p>

<p>Now, weakened by illness and confinement, the need of one to
take the place of a friend had brought him secretly to a man he
despised.</p>

<p>"You must have seen a great deal in your time, Herr Lippmann,"
he remarked with a brooding air. "And known many kinds of
men."</p>

<p>"That is so&mdash;I am seventy years old and have perpetually
travelled from place to place. Yes, Monseigneur, I have made some
study of mankind."</p>

<p>"And what, in the end, seems most worth while to you?"</p>

<p>"A comfortable place from which to watch the game&mdash;which
is now over for me."</p>

<p>"You find, then, human antics amusing?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Herr Lippmann, "surely Your Highness finds
them so?"</p>

<p>"People do not much concern me," answered the young man
simply. "I admire danger, the perilous attempt, the difficult
conquest, Lippmann, and power. All the power in the world would
hardly satisfy me."</p>

<p>"You have a great deal," smiled Herr Lippmann. "You are
spoiled, Sir, by good fortune."</p>

<p>"I am twenty-eight," was the moody reply, "and have yet no
establishment. What I have gotten I have gotten by selling my
sword, fighting for other men."</p>

<p>"If you hoist this Leopold to the purple," said Herr Lippmann,
"he will give you, no doubt, Kurland or another kingdom."</p>

<p>The mention of the Emperor seemed to cast deeper shade over
Christian's sombre face.</p>

<p>"He slighted me, Lippmann, deliberately&mdash;at Belgrade and
in Poland. Of all men, I detest him."</p>

<p>"Pull him down then."</p>

<p>"I doubt if I can. I tell you, though, it was pleasant when he
had to come cringing to me with the offer of his sister."</p>

<p>"You should have taken her, Sir, and put yourself above
reproach."</p>

<p>"Nothing could do that," replied Christian passionately, "not
marriage with an empress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But all your interests point to a union with Leopold," said
the astrologer, curiously wondering what was at the bottom of all
this.</p>

<p>"You think so? Give me your frank advice."</p>

<p>Seeing no advantage in any trickery, the astrologer
complied.</p>

<p>"I think the Allies would never trust you or treat you well;
they are gross peoples, hating foreigners. The French are behind
Leopold, and you, Sir, are French by education. You have many
friends in Paris; they admire you, value you; they and Leopold
will give you much honour and advancement."</p>

<p>"I want a throne," said Christian, rising with a restless
movement. "What satisfaction is it to me to put crowns on the
heads of other men?"</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann smiled, not without compassion; this sounded to
him like a child lamenting for a toy; yet children got toys and
this young man might get a throne.</p>

<p>Christian leant in the window space and glanced up at the
stars glittering above the valley of the Danube.</p>

<p>"Tell me, have you really ever seen anything in the heavens?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing anywhere, yet everything everywhere," replied the
sage.</p>

<p>"As well in the stars as in a church, or in a book, or on the
lips of another man," mused Christian. "To see those other worlds
so indifferently bright, so far away, gives me more sense of God
than a Mass or a sermon&mdash;in any tongue, in any creed."</p>

<p>"If I could read your destiny there," asked Herr Lippmann,
also looking up into the sparkling sky, "would you care to hear
it?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the young man scornfully, "since I must take
what comes, Lippmann, and cannot clutch back or push forward any
detail that is ordained&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But some say we make our own destiny."</p>

<p>"As far as man may, I will make mine," said Christian. "But
how far? Tell me that, my wise astrologer."</p>

<p>"I think I could tell you," replied the old man, "not,
Monseigneur, from the stars, but from your face, your
bearing&mdash;some have their fortunes truly written on their
brows. Yes, from that, and what I know of your career and
character, I could make a guess."</p>

<p>"So," said Christian, "my hangers-on are always judging me,
eh? I know," he added scornfully, "how many appraising glances
follow me. Well, tell me your guess."</p>

<p>"You will attain almost all you desire."</p>

<p>"Almost, eh?"</p>

<p>"And you will die, by violence, while still young."</p>

<p>Christian glanced quickly over his shoulder at the speaker; in
that wan starlight his face looked pallid and hollowed in the
cheeks, his brows frowned beneath the disordered hair; the night
breeze blew the laces of his shirt open on his breast. Herr
Lippmann reflected calmly that a great many people would pay him
very well if he made his prediction come instantly true and
slipped that useful little knife he always carried into the bare
bosom of General Crack.</p>

<p>"It is likely enough," pondered the young man. "Any one could
have ventured as much. What do I care when I die, if first I
attain my end?"</p>

<p>"But you would like some time in which to enjoy it," smiled
the astrologer.</p>

<p>"Enjoy it?"</p>

<p>"Your ambition&mdash;your success, Monseigneur. The fruition
of all your desires."</p>

<p>"My desires?" whispered Christian softly; he still looked at
the old man; "listen to me," he added rapidly, "I shall take you
to Dürsheim to-morrow&mdash;and there you will play a certain
part." He paused; frowned. "Anhalt-Dessau is
superstitious&mdash;if you can persuade him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann waited, pleased to think that his services were
required. He felt quite able to persuade Anhalt-Dessau anything;
but Christian did not finish the sentence; he seemed in the
deepest trouble and agitation.</p>

<p>"Leopold is coming to Dürsheim," he broke out. "Gabor found
that out&mdash;I shall have to meet him there&mdash;Lippmann, you
must frighten Anhalt-Dessau&mdash;anything&mdash;he must give the
girl to me."</p>

<p>"I will use any means," agreed the astrologer readily. "But
will you tell me, frankly, Monseigneur, as you have been frank so
far, what this marriage means to you?"</p>

<p>Christian rose and began to pace up and down the dismal room,
clutching his brocade robe together nervously on his breast.</p>

<p>"If I do not get her," he declared on a quick breath, "I shall
destroy myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it, is it?" said the old man softly. "I thought as
much. You love her."</p>

<p>"Love? I do not know if that is the word," replied the other
fiercely. "I want her. It must come to this with every
man&mdash;to want some woman beyond reason&mdash;beyond sense. If
everything else goes, Lippmann, my dearest hopes, I must have
her. If Anhalt-Dessau favours Leopold, I'll buy her from him by
offering him the empire he'll never get without me&mdash;and
that's a good price," he added bitterly, "for a little piece like
that."</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann thought so too, but it was useless to admonish
or argue in such a case; he could remember some such moods of his
own, combined of passion and phantasy, though they seemed so long
ago and were overlaid with subsequent philosophy; he knew, too,
that only the weak and emasculate dare to sneer at the power of
love; so he was silent, curious, but not surprised; unmoved, but
faintly sympathetic.</p>

<p>Christian continued to walk up and down; he was raging at what
he considered his own weakness; at what, to him, was the irony of
his destiny.</p>

<p>"That she should have been so hedged in, so high placed!" he
complained fiercely. "Why was she not a wayside wench, whom I
might have bought for a couple of ducats, and likely tired of in
a night?"</p>

<p>"Ay," agreed the astrologer, "you may tire of her,
Monseigneur. I've heard that she is stupid and likely to grow
fat."</p>

<p>"It may well be. Until I have her I cannot tell if I shall
grow so fond that she becomes a noble passion, or if I shall
weary. What do I know of her? She dare not show her mind or her
heart; never do I see her alone. They know her value and set it
up, and up. Lippmann, how often have I sworn that never would I
be so entangled?&mdash;and here I am, trapped."</p>

<p>The old man knew that what he said was true. Christian had
ever put his ambition first; his amours had never been
scandalous, he had never lost himself in low intrigues, or
offended a powerful woman by surrendering to the fascinations of
a meaner rival. In brief, with unlimited opportunities for folly
and licence, the young man had never been shaken from his dignity
and his prudence; he had pleasant memories of many women, regrets
for none.</p>

<p>"Well, marry her, Sir, and be at ease," advised Herr
Lippmann.</p>

<p>"But it is against my advantage," replied Christian gloomily.
"I shall gain nothing and may lose much. I fear Anhalt-Dessau
will give her to Leopold. He is going awooing himself, Lippmann,
and he is personable and ready-tongued&mdash;with his diadem and
his pedigree!"</p>

<p>"But it is your intention to buy him off?"</p>

<p>"I do not want to. I do not want to fight for him; I detest
him."</p>

<p>"Yet you would do so, to get the lady?" asked the
astrologer.</p>

<p>"Such is the depth of my infatuation," replied Christian,
bitterly. "I hope none know it, but no doubt they do&mdash;I am
so spied upon, and grossly watched. Lippmann, I know not how this
thing got me. I went to Schönbuchel out of spite, hearing she was
destined for Leopold, to see her. I saw her, and it was
done."</p>

<p>"You should go there at once, Sir, before the Emperor gets the
field," suggested the astrologer.</p>

<p>"I would have been there before but for this accident. And
you, Lippmann, will get Anhalt-Dessau with the shewglass or the
crystal. He is shallow and superstitious. Tell him what you will,
as long as you tell him it is ordained by Heaven that he give his
daughter to me."</p>

<p>"I will do my utmost," said the astrologer, but now without
much hope of success; he reflected that his visions and
predictions, jumping so with his master's desires, would be too
glaring an imposure even for a credulous man; and in these wild
commands he marked how a deep passion may sow seeds of folly in a
powerful mind.</p>

<p>Christian sank into the worn leather chair and watched the
stars again. The beamy constellations were paling in a sky
vaguely flushed with light; the pure illumination of the dawn
penetrated the dark chamber, and Herr Lippmann rose, and gently
put out the rank flame of the lamp.</p>

<p>The young man seemed exhausted; his foot ached from his
reckless pacing up and down, his hair hung damp on his forehead;
his face&mdash;pale, dark, clear&mdash;was tormented; his full
lips quivered, as if he were going to weep over his own
weakness.</p>

<p>Looking at him thus, and knowing his immense arrogance, Herr
Lippmann felt depressed. How might not the spectator of this
moment of self-revelation be punished?</p>

<p>Christian, in the commonplace light of the morning, would
surely not care to remember how he had displayed an outraged
heart, a tempestuous mind, and all the poor weaknesses to which
any humble man might own. And Herr Lippmann remembered
uncomfortably the Uhlan now under sentence of death.</p>

<p>Christian appeared to have forgotten his presence, and to be
drawn into some inner phantasy arising from the fumes and heats
of his passion; he leant his brow in his fine hand, and the angry
tears gathered in his eyes.</p>

<p>The astrologer rose; it was a dangerous occupation to look on
this emotion; he trod warily about the chamber, then paused to
gaze into a convex mirror set in one corner in a stone frame.</p>

<p>Here he could see a minute and vivid reflection of the great
light square of the window, the remote sky curdling into
brightness, the last flicker of the stars into brief
invisibility, and set before this cold display of fathomless
distance the bowed and troubled figure of the young man in his
transient human beauty, his transient human pain.</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann found himself moved, even startled by this
little picture. He continued to gaze into the convex mirror as if
he could indeed see there what he had often pretended to
see&mdash;supernatural wonders.</p>

<p>He saw, in this distorted reflection, Christian move and lean
from the window, the delicate breeze ruffling his hair; the
fading stars, the flushing heavens, a background for his head and
bust, which expressed all that mortality could express of grace
and strength.</p>

<p>And by his brocade sleeve the skull showed, cracked and
yellow.</p>

<p>"He is looking across the valley and the river to Dürsheim,"
thought the astrologer, "where his girl is abed. And a lovely
scene, with the sky like dropping gold and the river like a track
of quicksilver&mdash;"</p>

<p>Christian moved abruptly from the window.</p>

<p>"What do you look at in your mirror?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Yourself," replied Herr Lippmann.</p>

<p>"Look no more," said the young man. "Get to bed."</p>

<p>His tone had changed to that inflexible coldness to which Herr
Lippmann was too well used. There was not now any trace of tears
in his eyes. Summoning all his effrontery, the astrologer said
boldly:</p>

<p>"I pray Your Highness not to remember against me this
uninvited confidence."</p>

<p>Christian did not at once comprehend him; he was too absorbed
in the tumult of his own soul.</p>

<p>"But I," added Herr Lippmann, "need hardly fear you would be
less than generous."</p>

<p>He spoke sincerely; his fears vanished as he reflected that
never had he known the young man commit a meanness; placed above
restraints and petty fears, Christian had never had need to be
revengeful.</p>

<p>"You have not offended me," he now said quietly. "It is your
<i>métier</i> to read men."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir," replied the alchemist, relieved, "it is also my
<i>métier</i> to keep my mouth shut."</p>

<p>Christian looked at him reflectively, and even slightly
smiled.</p>

<p>"I do weary," he said, "at so many being afraid of me. It
heightens my pity of myself."</p>

<p>He went, slow and halting, from the room. Herr Lippmann,
yawning and a little cold, opened wide cupboards in a search for
hoarded food and drink; he was a constant and a coarse
feeder.</p>

<p>When he had ransacked out his breakfast the stars had all
disappeared; the whole aspect of the valley had altered with the
appearance of the sun above the distant hills.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="first">COUNT MICHAEL HENSDORFF always felt less sour,
less forlorn when he had some definite work on hand, especially
when the work was inspired by hope, as in the present case it was
inspired. He had already fitted the Anhalt-Dessau intrigue into
his schemes, taken in all its bearings, and settled his handling
of the matter; he foresaw no great difficulties, but the
vexatious question was that of time.</p>

<p>An effete congress was sitting at Brussels; when the supine
diplomats who were gathered there had finally disagreed, the war,
lulled for the moment, would break out again; and Hensdorff did
not wish to weary through a winter before opening the campaign;
he wanted the Imperialists, before the last peace protocols were
torn up, to take the field in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands,
and harry the Allies before they had had time to rally and
consolidate their immense forces.</p>

<p>To attain this end everything must be sacrificed to gain the
services of Prince Christian; and here the procedure was simple
enough; Anhalt-Dessau must be persuaded to give his daughter to
Leopold, and then Leopold must give her up to the invaluable
general in return for his invaluable services.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff foresaw no trouble with Leopold, who had never
been ardent for this match but wished to marry one of his own
Faith, and but little with Anhalt-Dessau, if the surrender of his
daughter to an adventuring mercenary was sufficiently gilded by
honours and titles for himself.</p>

<p>Hensdorff wrote letters to the Prince Palatinate with the
object of securing his daughter, Bernardine Charlotte, for the
Emperor, and was vexed that he had no means of dispatching them;
but Lieutenant Gabor was able to help him there, and supply him
with a messenger; the Transylvanian, who appeared to be at the
head of a very efficient service of espionage, was also able to
inform him that the Emperor had proceeded as far as the monastery
of Mölk where he intended to pass the next twenty-four hours
before proceeding to Dürsheim, where the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau
was at present residing with his ancient relative, the Duchess of
Schönbuchel, in her château of that name.</p>

<p>Leopold himself had a residence near: the grand Castle of
Bosenberg on the dangerous and lordly sweep of the Danube to the
south, not far from the little town of Yps. Hensdorff believed
that it was to rival Leopold that Christian had purchased and
embellished this estate of Ottenheim, whose splendour now
certainly eclipsed that of the Imperial château.</p>

<p>Leopold, however, was not going to Bosenberg but to Mölk, and
there Hensdorff decided to join him, both to reprimand him for
his lightness in undertaking such an adventure at such a moment,
and to unfold to him how matters were with regard to General
Crack.</p>

<p>Gabor applauded this plan; he seemed eager to help Hensdorff
in every way in which he could to bring Christian and Leopold
together; in that union he saw ultimate rewards for himself;
besides, his restless, cunning nature delighted in a complicated
intrigue.</p>

<p>In the early morning, while Christian was wearily returning to
his room from the astrologer's tower, Hensdorff and Gabor had met
and talked out their plans; the Austrian disclosed as little as
possible of his intentions to Gabor, while finding him extremely
useful at the moment.</p>

<p>He was careful to say nothing to him that he did not wish
repeated to General Crack; Gabor would, of course, tell him that
Leopold was at Mölk, and that he, Hensdorff, was going to meet
him there, and Christian would be fully aware of the efforts made
to obtain Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau in order to sell her back
again, while he would use all his wits to obtain her without
paying for her at all; it would be a keen and close struggle.
Hensdorff had no doubt of ultimate success; but he wished he knew
why Christian was so desirous of the marriage.</p>

<p>Standing by one of the wreathed and curled statues on the
colonnade, Hensdorff watched Christian and his suite depart for
Schönbuchel.</p>

<p>It was a very imposing display; no king could have set out
with greater dignity. Hensdorff smiled sourly to see the valets
and grooms in Kurland liveries, dark green and silver, the Uhlans
in their laced and braided uniforms beplumed and bespangled,
swaggering up and down the winged marble steps or clattering in
the forecourt at the bottom. Colonel Pons and Captain Banning
strutted and flourished as became the favourite officers of this
flashing array. Hensdorff appeared eclipsed in his civilian
attire; he had left the army some time since; none of the
soldiers took any notice of him, even Gabor appeared absorbed in
the spectacle of the moment.</p>

<p>The Austrian was forced to admit that everything was very well
done; the horses were splendid, and handsomely appointed; the
uniforms new and fine, most of them of Polish fashion. There were
three troops, Uhlans, Croatians and Black Cuirassiers, attended
by Heyducks oriental servants; a certain number of each were
mustered to escort their General.</p>

<p>"I daresay," thought Hensdorff, "that all this bravery will be
very pleasing to the young lady, but I doubt if her careful
relatives will care to house so many rufflers."</p>

<p>When all was in exact order, General Crack appeared at the
door by which Hensdorff had entered two days before, booted and
wearing the ornate uniform of the Uhlans; he looked at Hensdorff
in his usual dry, impassive way, and remarked that the day
promised great heat, while he pulled on fringed gloves with a
silver star on the back. Hensdorff returned his insolent stare
and inwardly observed that he was pale, for all his careful pose
of invulnerability.</p>

<p>The Austrian admitted, however, that he appeared very
magnificent; Leopold, though well drilled to make a fine show,
could not rival this sumptuous appearance.</p>

<p>General Crack just touched his hat and passed on slowly down
the steps.</p>

<p>"He may thank his God and his tailor for doing very well by
him," thought the Austrian cynically; but despite this reflection
he was awed.</p>

<p>There was something grand about that handsome figure,
something implacable and pitiless and arrogant, but something
heroic too, even something awful, as if he was already gloomed by
the faint foreshadowing of a terrible destiny; that slight halt
gave that effect, perhaps; he was not yet walking with great
sureness.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," thought Hensdorff, and brushed aside the
impression.</p>

<p>When General Crack had mounted his great bay horse with the
stiff braided saddle cloth, there was a slight delay; Colonel
Pons had reminded him that it was the hour for the execution of
the Uhlan he had condemned to death, and ventured to ask a
respite.</p>

<p>"I cannot alter it," replied Christian. "It is better that one
man lose his life than discredit come on all of you. How can I
keep discipline if there be no punishment for licence?"</p>

<p>The man had abducted, from a neighbouring village, a girl who
had persistently refused him her favours, and the parents had
come clamouring to Ottenheim for redress.</p>

<p>"Well," said Colonel Pons, regretfully, "he is a very useful
fellow, for whom I had some liking. And the girl speaks for
him."</p>

<p>"The girl speaks for him?" repeated Christian curiously,
holding in the impetuous horse.</p>

<p>"She has been complaining past reason, and swears that if he
is to hang she will split her heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you account for that?" asked Christian, with
animation.</p>

<p>"It is past my province," grumbled Pons. "But it seems that if
the fellow is likely enough the wooing can't be too
rough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is past my province, too, I think," smiled Christian, who
seemed suddenly in a good humour. "Let the man go and make it up
with his sweetheart."</p>

<p>Hensdorff inquisitively watched this episode to which he had
not the clue; he looked indifferently down at the cavalcade, with
tossing plumes, rigid cockades, gilded ribbons and flashing
steel, and watched them wheel round in the forecourt and canter
off down the long avenue of high trees, the sun gleaming in the
shining flanks of the horses, in the metallic shoulder knots, in
the basket hilts of the long swords, and in the clasps of the
agraffes of feathers in the laced hats.</p>

<p>At a discreet distance, Herr Lippmann followed on a mule, with
his assistant trudging behind; his civilian aspect would have
spoilt the military splendour of General Crack's gorgeous escort,
and he had been warned by Pons to keep well behind.</p>

<p>Hensdorff greeted him ironically.</p>

<p>"You, too, for Dürsheim?" he asked, leaning over the low white
balustrade.</p>

<p>"I follow my fortune," replied the alchemist, who was an adept
at noncommittal phrases; he paused, considering what Hensdorff
would give to know the secret that Christian had confided to him
last night; he was a thrifty man who looked ahead to the days
when he should be too old to play for the favour of princes.</p>

<p>Hensdorff saw his hesitation and came down the steps; the
alchemist sent on his assistant to trudge ahead.</p>

<p>"Have you guessed why there is all this to-do?" he asked
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Why he is set on the marriage? No."</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you. And expect a reward later. My news
can't harm him, and may be useful to you."</p>

<p>"I'm curious," said the Austrian, "for it is against his
interest, which is all I ever heard he considered."</p>

<p>"He knows that," whispered Herr Lippmann slily. "But he's in
love. He wants the girl."</p>

<p>At this Hensdorff could not refrain from laughter; the
explanation was so simple and yet the last explanation that he
had thought of; had he not always said that behind every mystery
was some ordinary human passion?</p>

<p>So General Crack, with his invincible air, was most vulnerable
after all. Hensdorff was indeed amused.</p>

<p>"Interesting to see her," he remarked. "I should not have
thought him easily pleased."</p>

<p>"He isn't," smiled the alchemist, "but he may be easily
deluded by a fit of fantastic passion."</p>

<p>And he touched up his mule and hurried down the long avenue
from which the brilliant cavalcade had just disappeared.</p>

<p>Hensdorff at once felt sure of General Crack, and began to
cast up the terms he would force on him before he relinquished
the desired lady.</p>

<p>Stimulated by these reflections he set off at once for Mölk,
which was not far distant on the road to Vienna; by midday he saw
the majestic domes and spires and open colonnade of the monastery
rising imposingly from the right bank of the Danube.</p>

<p>Mölk rose on a jutting dark porphyry rock round which were
clustering mean and squalid huts and the mouldering walls of some
ancient castle that had once dominated this magnificent
position.</p>

<p>The Benedictine monastery was a new building in the Grecian
style or Eastern style, by Prandauer, the fashionable architect,
on the site of an old Gothic building, opulently adorned with
gilding, frescoes and statues, and rising bold and massive into
the bright summer sky and higher than the distant hills that
edged the windings of the Danube.</p>

<p>The cupola-crowned church, the commanding sweep of the walls,
set off with the dark woods beyond the rock on which they were
built, gave the edifice an air of towering grandeur, impressive
to the casual traveller.</p>

<p>But Hensdorff was not moved by the rich beauty of the scene,
the noble, winding river crowned with islets, the violet hills
melting into the horizon, or the ostentatious monastery; he
blamed the steepness of the ascent and the exhausting heat of the
day as he laboriously rode up the rough road to the gates of
Mölk.</p>

<p>To crown this vexatious travelling he had some altercation
with the porter at the splendid gates who was disposed to deny
that the Abbot or Brothers entertained any guests.</p>

<p>But Count Hensdorff persisted in his demands for admittance;
he asked for Captain Leopold, for he knew that this name, his own
and that of the titular saint of Austria, was the name under
which his master usually travelled.</p>

<p>He was, however, considerably fatigued before he obtained an
entrance and persuaded the Benedictine who was called to attend
to him that his errand was of importance; he was finally
conducted, courteously enough, to the Königsaal, which was one of
the splendours of the newly finished building, and hence to the
blue and gold library.</p>

<p>This harmonious apartment, a hundred feet long, of dovetailed
walnut wood and profusely gilt, well furnished with expensive
books and overlooking the majestic sweep of the Danube at the
base of the rock below and the superb woods beyond, was in every
way imposing, and Hensdorff, as he drank the coffee thoughtfully
provided, reflected that, considering the pinch of the times, the
ruin of a confused war, and the general misery of the Empire,
Holy Church was wonderful to have yet the means to raise this
lofty and rich edifice, which surpassed even the magnificence
which General Crack was able to display from the accumulated
plunder of two successful and unscrupulous careers.</p>

<p>After some delay Hensdorff was joined by Father St. Nikola,
Leopold's confessor, and was not at all pleased to see that his
master had chosen this travelling companion, for the politician
was as mistrustful of the priest as the priest was disdainful of
the politician; it seemed to Hensdorff a stupid action to bring a
Jesuit into a Lutheran household.</p>

<p>But Father St. Nikola explained that he was remaining at Mölk
until Leopold should require his presence at Bosenberg.</p>

<p>"Bosenberg!" exclaimed Hensdorff impatiently. "As soon as this
affair is settled he must get back to Vienna or the headquarters
of the army&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has a pious fit," said the Jesuit, "and has spent many
hours in the church here, he is much for solitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Hensdorff, his harsh face wrinkling with
annoyance. "Do you want to make a monk of him that you encourage
these humours?"</p>

<p>"I have done my best to animate him with interest in worldly
concerns," replied the confessor. "But you, as I, Count, must
take notice of this melancholic strain in him. Is this marriage
concluded?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that it will be," replied Hensdorff, who had
no intention of letting the priest into the intrigue he had on
hand. "But do not let it vex your delicate conscience, Father,
the lady will leave her heresy."</p>

<p>He could easily promise this, since he never intended the
marriage to take place, and it gave him a certain pleasure to
deceive the keen and energetic priest.</p>

<p>Father St. Nikola let this pass; he remarked on the
gorgeousness of the commodious monastery, the pulpit of sheer
gold in imitation of Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome, the wine
cellars where a horse and carriage could be turned with ease.</p>

<p>"It seems," remarked Hensdorff drily, "a flaunting to spend so
much in the midst of starvation and ruin."</p>

<p>But the priest replied, with justice, that the great building
with its sumptuous decorations had employed many hundreds of
people and given a certain impetus to the Arts which had here
been so liberally employed; to say nothing of the much needed
lustre cast on the Imperial family.</p>

<p>At this point a young man entered the library and stood,
rather reluctantly, within the cornice of the pilastered
door.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">COUNT MICHAEL HENSDORFF rose as Leopold stood
hesitant, and the confessor discreetly withdrew to the far end of
the immense gallery where he occupied himself by glancing over
the titles of the learned books so nicely set out on the gilt
shelves.</p>

<p>"I did not know," said Leopold rather sullenly, "that you were
aware I was here."</p>

<p>"You might as well have informed me yourself, Sire," replied
Hensdorff, "for I only had to learn of it from one of General
Crack's spies."</p>

<p>Leopold blushed; he had thought his journey a profound secret;
he disliked Hensdorff for having discovered it; he did not, in
any case, love his minister though he considerably relied on him;
he began now to defend himself without having been blamed, and
this in a nervous manner.</p>

<p>"There was nothing for me to do in Vienna," he declared.
"Everywhere I turn I find chaos and contradiction. I'm plagued to
pieces. I thought," he added defiantly, "that I would settle at
least one thing for myself. I've some interest in my marriage, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Hensdorff, "as it turns out, it is fortunate
that you have come, Sire, though these adventures are unsuitable
to the times. We do not, Sire, live in the age of chivalry."</p>

<p>Leopold replied bitterly that this was an unnecessary
reminder; he leant against the lofty window frame and gazed
moodily across the intervening river at the vast and sweeping
forests that bounded the horizon; Hensdorff noted with annoyance
that he was carelessly dressed, and would make, on a stranger, a
poor impression; there was nothing about him of that sense of a
blaze of a great presence that one felt on meeting General
Crack.</p>

<p>Leopold was, however, quite charming, very finely bred, with a
fastidious air; in his childhood he had been spoilt as the only
son of the Elector of Bavaria, greatest of German princes; in his
youth he had borne the empty honours of King of the Romans during
the vicissitudes of a cruel war which had given his father the
title of Emperor and cost him everything else; he was now
twenty-four years of age and had not shown any special gifts,
though he had played a difficult part with dignity; during his
father's lifetime he had been overshadowed, and since his
father's death he had had little chance to distinguish himself;
the French, briefly dominant in Austria, had forced his election
and pledged themselves to his coronation, but his fortunes were
still in a dangerous state of ebb and flow&mdash;mostly, as
Hensdorff reflected, ebb.</p>

<p>His disposition was romantic; he had not yet shown any violent
emotion of any kind; he was a learned dilettante in the Arts and
had acquitted himself with credit as a soldier if he had cut no
great figure as a general. His mother had been a Spanish
princess; twice through the female side he had inherited that
Hapsburg blood which gave him his perilous claim to Imperial
honours, and showed in his too full lower lip and in a melancholy
strain in his character. He had no sense of the humour of life;
he saw his own comedy, but was not amused by it; he was
continually afraid of being ridiculous in his own estimation.</p>

<p>In appearance he was pleasing if not notable, elegant, light
blond, with a long countenance and arched nose very suitable for
medals and triumphal arches, soft blue eyes and a pure
complexion; most of what he did had a touch of uncertainty, but
on occasion he had displayed a manly energy.</p>

<p>He asked now about the success of the mission to Prince
Christian, as he scrupulously called the great mercenary
soldier.</p>

<p>For answer Hensdorff drily produced the unopened letter with
the Imperial seals.</p>

<p>Leopold coloured fiercely (to his own intense annoyance, he
blushed too easily) and tore his own missive indignantly
across.</p>

<p>"I believe that you slighted him once," said Hensdorff. "At
Belgrade&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never," replied Leopold hotly. "He was always indifferent to
me. Slighted? At Belgrade? You mean because I did not ask him to
my table? I had forty ruling princes to entertain."</p>

<p>"It was the more slight to leave him out," remarked Hensdorff.
"His achievements should blot out his birth."</p>

<p>"Insolent!" cried Leopold, tearing the letter again.</p>

<p>"He certainly is," agreed Hensdorff grimly. "Most men are who
know they have a high value&mdash;he omits nothing to enhance his
prestige. Ottenheim can rival Bosenberg."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Leopold peevishly. "Both he and his father
were rapacious thieves. I did not think he had refused my
sister," he added bitterly.</p>

<p>"Nor did I," admitted Hensdorff, "but he is engaged on another
affair. And through that we shall get him yet."</p>

<p>"Let him go," cried Leopold. "I wish to owe nothing to
him&mdash;we will find another general."</p>

<p>Hensdorff took no heed of these brave words; he briefly
outlined the Anhalt-Dessau intrigue and the necessity of
relinquishing the Princess to General Crack.</p>

<p>"Why then," exclaimed Leopold in disgust, "I will go back to
Vienna. Make your bargain, Hensdorff. I am glad to be out of a
marriage with a Lutheran."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was irritated at this obtuseness.</p>

<p>"How can you sell what you haven't got?" he asked. "You must
get Anhalt-Dessau to seal and sign the girl to you before you can
assign her to Christian, Sire&mdash;he sees that, he's off to-day
to get her for himself, and will, unless we put in with a higher
price."</p>

<p>Leopold refused hotly to be party to any such design.
"Bargaining about women with a man like that, I get lower with
every day of this business&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you could offer your sister," Hensdorff reminded him, "you
might countenance this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was overpersuaded to it," replied Leopold with tears of
humiliation in his eyes. "And where has it led me?"</p>

<p>"To a point where you may get what you desire," snapped
Hensdorff. "If he has refused your offer, at least we know of
what he won't refuse."</p>

<p>"I dislike the whole business," protested Leopold. "I shall
certainly return to Vienna and have no hand in it."</p>

<p>Hensdorff knew why he was so anxious now he was vexed to
return to Vienna; there was a certain Countess Carola for whom he
had a sentimental and platonic affection and who contrived to
combine a philosophical coquetry with Leopold and a decorous
fidelity to an elderly husband; Leopold rather fancied her as his
Aspasia and confided to her his worldly troubles. Hensdorff
thought it a fruitless and tiresome affair, and judged the arch
Countess a boring <i>bas bleu</i>; he had no mind that Leopold
should drift back to this virtuous pedant at such a crucial
moment.</p>

<p>"If you throw up this, Sire," he said harshly, "you might as
well throw up the whole thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have a mind to," replied Leopold peevishly. "I never wanted
this place, I doubt if I am suited to it, I meet nothing but
vexation and tedium."</p>

<p>"That is the cry of most men," interrupted Hensdorff. "Who
want the places they find themselves in? Very few. To be an
emperor should be as amusing as most <i>metiers</i>."</p>

<p>"But to be an emperor without an empire&mdash;that is not
amusing."</p>

<p>"I should have thought it might have been," retorted Hensdorff
drily. "But Your Imperial Majesty is rather unamusable."</p>

<p>"I am too often the butt of the joke at which I am asked to
laugh," said Leopold. "In this business now, into which you would
thrust me, I cut the figure of a fool."</p>

<p>"Not at all," urged Hensdorff. "You can make Christian the
fool&mdash;you dislike him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Leopold candidly, "I do not, I have admired him;
when I have seen him after a victory I have envied him: there is
something impelling and grand about the fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why did you make him hate you?" demanded Hensdorff,
exasperated. "All this difficulty is due to your slight of
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have explained that," put in Leopold rather haughtily. "I
treated him as what he was. And really his arrogance was
intolerable."</p>

<p>"It still is," was the dry comment, "and none the less easy to
bear from his having the whip hand. But if, Sire, you will deign
to use a little tact, it will be he, not you, who will look the
fool."</p>

<p>Leopold declared that he could not see that, and added
fretfully that this parcel of ill news might have been kept till
after dinner.</p>

<p>"It cannot wait a moment," answered the inexorable Hensdorff.
"Christian is already ruffling it at Schönbuchel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I," cried Leopold, "will not go there to compete with
him!"</p>

<p>Hensdorff endeavoured to be patient.</p>

<p>"Why not use the fellow? Give him this little Princess for
whom he has this infatuation, trust me to drive a hard bargain
with him, let him give you this Empire, the lack of which you say
makes you feel ridiculous, and then, when you want him no more,
get rid of him&mdash;he will look foolish enough then, with
nothing for his reward but a wife of whom he will probably have
tired&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is odd," remarked Leopold, "that he should be so set on
the lady. I had not thought him romantic or easily moved by
sentiment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is not, I think, either romance or sentiment about
it&mdash;but we have him on this unreasonable passion as we could
have him on nothing else and I pray Your Majesty to take
advantage of it."</p>

<p>Leopold began to feel weary of the argument; he never could
withstand Hensdorff for long; he was always too eager to get back
to his books, or his pictures, or his music or his mere idleness;
he often dreamt of some delicious existence in which he could
indulge these pleasures without vexations and where people like
Hensdorff could never intrude.</p>

<p>Annoyed by his minister's persistency he now again spoke of
resigning his tiresome dignities and going into some peaceful
retreat.</p>

<p>"A monastery?" asked Hensdorff harshly. "I do not know where
else Your Majesty would find a refuge, seeing that even your own
Bavaria is in the hands of the enemy."</p>

<p>Leopold, stung by this, blushed, and walked away down the long
gallery; he felt beset and cornered. Hensdorff was like a gadfly,
with his urgent schemes&mdash;and yet, as he had just so crudely
pointed out, where was the alternative?</p>

<p>To give up his pretensions seemed to be to give up life; he
had his back to the wall, and must fight or be slain.</p>

<p>He approached Father St. Nikola, who was diligently reading
the self-confident titles of the ponderous tomes on the gilded
shelves; here was enough of polemics to have founded a dozen
creeds and destroyed a dozen others&mdash;or would have been
enough if any one had troubled to read these laborious
arguments.</p>

<p>The Jesuit had the greatest respect for these works for the
purpose of making the brain elastic and subtle in the arguments
so useful to confuse the ignorant, but he had long passed the
need of them, and eyed their grandiloquent array with the
reflection that any one who saw this library must know that the
good Brothers had another one not so publicly displayed.</p>

<p>"Father St. Nikola," asked Leopold uncertainly, "do you
consider it would be worth any sacrifice to secure the services
of Prince Christian?"</p>

<p>The Jesuit had thought that question decided long since; else
why the Hensdorff mission, and the offer of the Archduchess?</p>

<p>"I certainly do, Sire," he replied at once.</p>

<p>"Every one seems agreed to put a high value on this man,"
sighed Leopold. "Remember, Father, he is now a renegade."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty must use such instruments as come to your hand,"
said the Jesuit glibly. "I should use every effort, Sire, to gain
and retain a soldier like Prince Christian."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I must do as Hensdorff suggests," answered
Leopold reluctantly. "It is difficult to deal with Prince
Christian, Father; a very overbearing, high-handed, insolent
adventurer."</p>

<p>"No one is so arrogant as a successful soldier," admitted the
priest, "and the Prince has been glutted with fame. But disregard
all that, Sire, and use him while you need him, and leave him
when you do not. There are ways," added the Jesuit, thoughtfully,
"of removing those who cease to be of use."</p>

<p>Leopold glanced at him sharply.</p>

<p>"But one must be powerful to employ them," he answered.</p>

<p>"Let Prince Christian make Your Majesty powerful, and then
punish him for any presumption in which he may now indulge."</p>

<p>This advice ran with that of Hensdorff, though it was more
courteously offered; it was still, however, far from agreeable to
Leopold, who wanted to be clear of the whole intrigue and never
hear again of Anhalt-Dessau, the Princess Eleanora, or General
Crack.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned longingly to the pale boudoir of the
Countess Carola, where that graceful lady so often sat at her
harp and listened with such deferential sympathy to his rather
mournful meditations.</p>

<p>Father St. Nikola saw the expression of distress and
hesitation on the fair face; he did not know the details of
Leopold's interview with Hensdorff, but he shrewdly guessed that
the former was tempted, in a fit of disgust at some of the
minister's proposals, to give over all effort on behalf of his
own rather doubtful cause.</p>

<p>"Sire," urged the Jesuit quickly, "no man of spirit
and&mdash;conscience would lightly resign&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he pointed to the beautiful country, river, wood, hill,
lying, in all the pomp of summer loveliness, beyond the windows
of the long gallery.</p>

<p>Leopold was always sensitive to such suggestions; beneath his
flickering uncertainties was a constant, if baffled ambition; a
lively, if fitful sense of birth and nationality.</p>

<p>"It is not for Your Majesty," smiled the Jesuit, quietly, "to
be put out of your way by any one like Prince Christian."</p>

<p>The young man rallied to the pride of that; he felt that he
ought, as Hensdorff had said, to use Christian for his own ends,
despise him and cast him off when he had no need of
him&mdash;surely the Imperial gesture.</p>

<p>"I suppose that I had better go to Schönbuchel," he admitted,
"but it is very distasteful."</p>

<p>Hensdorff now strolled up, stroking his long, sour face with a
wrinkled hand; Leopold felt hemmed in by these two personalities;
he knew that he should do what they wished him to do, and, more,
that what they wished him to do would be what he ought to do, so
he mustered the best possible grace with which to submit.</p>

<p>They were wiser than he, he confessed, and infinitely
stronger; right, of course, but if they had been wrong he could
scarcely have resisted them.</p>

<p>So Leopold, with a gesture of resignation, permitted himself
to be persuaded into the Anhalt-Dessau intrigue.</p>

<p>But he put off the journey till the afternoon under the excuse
of the heat of the day and lounged, after dinner, in one of the
alcoves of the library, exasperating Hensdorff by the delay while
he strove to compose a paper of verses for the Countess Carola;
but his mind had been so vexed that he got no further
than:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Like a dark rose opening to a heart of gold&mdash;<br>
Like a deep river widening to the seas&mdash;"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">AMELIA, Duchess of Schönbuchel, had been twice
widowed and reached the age of seventy without finding life at
all unpleasant; she continued to feel her own affairs very
satisfactory, and those of others very diverting. There were many
varieties of lunacy in her family, but she herself was extremely
sane; she knew her confused pedigree and her hundreds of
relations by heart, and could have recited, without pausing for
breath, their multitudinous quarterings; for the rest, she did
not trouble about them much. She had lately retired to
Schönbuchel, at Dürsheim on the Danube, and there flourished in a
comfortable solitude that she easily filled with small, but
exciting, interests.</p>

<p>Here she occasionally endured the company of her second
cousin, the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, for the sake of that of his
daughter, of whom she was exceedingly fond and in whose future
she was sincerely interested.</p>

<p>She thought that the girl had been harshly brought up, and was
altogether too dutiful, poor motherless creature, to her tiresome
pedantic father, who tyrannized without stint over his only
child. Eleanora endured his harshness with dutiful affection; she
had an extremely sweet disposition.</p>

<p>From her cradle she had been a matrimonial prize, and the fit
disposition of her hand had been a constant preoccupation with
her father, who finally, after much debate, had leaned to Leopold
of Bavaria when that prince's career had seemed more successful;
since then, however, Prince Christian had come forward, with very
definite advantages, and Leopold had suffered considerable
reverses; so Anhalt-Dessau hesitated; he was a bigoted
Protestant, and had been immensely moved in favour of Christian
by his ready renunciation of Catholicism, whereas to achieve the
Imperial diadem his daughter would have to leave her hereditary
faith.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Schönbuchel watched all these manoeuvres with
zest; when she had a favourable opinion on them she was silent,
but she gave her cousin the benefit of all her adverse criticism;
he was not, therefore, very ready to stay at Dürsheim, but found
it temptingly convenient to Vienna and Ottenheim.</p>

<p>War or peace seemed to make little difference to the revenues
of the Duchess; the expectations of her heirs might be pinched
but her expenses were not; she contrived to keep up all the state
to which she had always been accustomed.</p>

<p>She had a passion for clothes and pet animals, and was very
popular with her dependents, for she liked to see her inferiors
enjoying themselves as long as they did their duties, and these
they were very ready to discharge in the service of such a
good-natured mistress.</p>

<p>She was, at present, a rigid prude, more from the advantage
such an attitude gave her in censuring others than from any deep
conviction, but she enjoyed a scandalous story in the right
company (that of virtuous matrons) and was supposed to have
afforded the theme for several such herself in the days of her
active youth; she was able, however, to despise such rumours by a
reflection on the lack of human charity which she had always
found so conspicuous and at which she could scarcely wonder, for
she admitted that to think the worst was generally to hit the
truth.</p>

<p>All such cynical maxims, however, she kept from Eleanora, in
whom she tried to inculcate those lefty ideals which she had
always felt so dubious about herself.</p>

<p>Eleanora cared nothing about cynicism or ideals; she lived
cheerfully from day to day, doing her lessons, reading her
homilies, running about the house peeping into this and that,
playing a little and dreaming a little; she was seventeen and had
not a care in the world; she liked very much to come to
Schönbuchel, the castle on the rocks overhanging the Danube
opposite a small island so dark and lovely that it was surely
inhabited by fairies, and ringed round by beautiful hills that
had an air of enchantment; she liked also to hear the stories of
the Danube, the legends of Kriemhild and Siegfried, of knights
and dragons and magic.</p>

<p>The Duchess did not encourage this taste; she knew the age to
be practical and material, and no period for one whose head was
filled with fairy tales.</p>

<p>Eleanora's father was also severely set against this romantic
tendency, but for another reason; his strict Lutheranism thought
such literature corrupting. Enervating tales of passion, crime
and folly, he said, should have no place in the education of a
Christian maiden.</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried the Duchess, when she heard him say this; and
promptly became a party to smuggled books in her private
chambers. "The child can't always be reading sermons," she said,
glancing across at Eleanora in the window seat with a great
volume found in the old library, and her keen old face, withered,
sharpened and bleached, softened into a look of love.</p>

<p>Eleanora, in her deep absorption, appeared indeed a child; she
was small, and her limbs very curved and delicate; in a catalogue
of charms hers had not appeared so notable, but there was in her
air, her movement, her gesture, her look, like a perfume, like a
melody, some indefinable and potent fascination. Her grace and
fragrance were not to be explained; there was something touching
about her innocent liveliness, something moving about her
delicious gaiety. She wore now a cambric dress and a sarcenet
sash of saffron colour, while in the waves of her pale soft hair
she had placed a knot of silvered ribbon given her by the
Duchess, who delighted in making her these frivolous little
gifts.</p>

<p>"What are you reading of?" asked the Duchess.</p>

<p>Eleanora glanced up, smiling; she could not say, the images in
the old book moved in a confused impression across her mind,
rich, brilliant and nameless.</p>

<p>"You must not stoop over books too much," added the old woman,
"you will grow round-shouldered and you must not always have
sweets in your pocket or you will spoil your teeth."</p>

<p>"How you look after me," smiled Eleanora, stretching like a
little cat. "The sweets are only for when I do my Latin and
Divinity. It helps me, when the words are hard, to have something
pleasant to taste&mdash;" But she dutifully untied the silk bag
at her waist and tossed it to the Duchess.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go out now, Eleanora, with Charlotte and take a
walk in the woods? You might find some strawberries."</p>

<p>"It is too hot."</p>

<p>The day was indeed warm; a golden haze lay over the valley,
the azure sky shimmered with heat; the Danube blazed in the sun;
but in this. chamber it was cool with dark green <i>male
fleurs</i> tapestry, and long mirrors that held shadows like
water. There were two green parrots in ebony rings, white dogs in
baskets, and a monkey asleep by a dish of fruit.</p>

<p>The Duchess, most comfortably disposed on a large sofa, was
embroidering a chair back with her very complicated quarterings.
She wore an old-fashioned robe of stiff brocade and a great deal
of jewellery; hard, sparkling, heavily set.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Prince Christian?" she asked suddenly.

<p>"I saw him on the terrace below this morning, walking with
father," replied the girl indifferently.</p>

<p>"Do you think him at all like your Siegfried?" demanded the
Duchess.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Siegfried was fair."</p>

<p>"Well, he is a very handsome man. Don't you like him?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen much of him," said Eleanora, from whom all
her matrimonial prospects had been carefully kept. "No, I don't
think I do like him; he is overbearing, and stares so. He never
says anything to me but 'good day,' and yet he makes me feel
little and silly. Why do you ask him here. Aunt Amelia?"</p>

<p>"Your father wants to see him, about some of those dull
affairs men get interested in&mdash;he is a great soldier, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl, who saw no enchantment in her own
times, "but that isn't what it used to be, is it?"</p>

<p>"He certainly isn't a knight errant, if that is what you
mean." The Duchess could hardly forbear a smile. "But he must be
very interesting to talk to. I should like to have a conversation
with him, I must say."</p>

<p>Eleanora did not answer; Christian hardly touched her little
enclosed world; she had grown up in the midst of wars and
confusions of politics, knowing nothing of either.</p>

<p>"I daresay we shall dine with him to-night," continued the
Duchess. "And you shall wear that new pink dress with the
sapphires&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, can I? It is so pretty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But skimped. The man cabbaged some of the stuff. But
Charlotte will set it out very well, no doubt."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go down to dinner," said Eleanora, to whom
these formal meals were periods of dull restraint and long
conversations about subjects that she did not understand.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it is usually very tedious, and your father so
disagreeable. However, I suppose we must go, or it would seem a
slight to Prince Christian."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Eleanora idly.</p>

<p>The Duchess, who was usually so ready with every one's
genealogy, was rather confused by this childish question.</p>

<p>"He is a Prince of Kurland," she answered, "and in all these
ridiculous wars he has lost his kingdom."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't the Emperor give it back to him?"</p>

<p>"Because he is in trouble himself. It is all more than you or
I will ever understand," said the Duchess briefly. "What you will
have to be concerning yourself about," she added, "is your
settlement in life&mdash;your father expects to see you married
soon, so don't be dreaming too much of beautiful knights with
yellow hair, for there are no longer any such creatures."</p>

<p>"As if I did!" laughed Eleanora. "And father says that I'm not
to be married yet nor need think of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old woman gazed at her with furtive tenderness; she did
not wish the girl soon married, for that would mean that she
would lose the brightest and sweetest of her companions and she
felt a yearning over the childish happiness so soon to be
exchanged for a state by no means certain to be happy but sure to
be full of care and trouble; to be the wife of any German prince
would not, these tumultuous times, be too easy.</p>

<p>She was glad that Eleanora was indifferent to Christian, for
in her heart she leant towards the Imperial match; though she had
a shrewd knowledge of the value of these high-sounding honours,
she could not resist the desire to see them worn by her
favourite.</p>

<p>While the old woman and the girl were both drowsily silent, in
the heat of the day, one with her needle, the other with her
book, the door opened brusquely and the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau
entered. Eleanora rose in a fright and could scarce make a
reverence in her hurry to throw her frilled skirts over the
forbidden book.</p>

<p>Even though she was successful in this she did not escape
censure.</p>

<p>"What have you got in your hair, child?" asked her father
sternly.</p>

<p>"A knot of ribbon that I gave her, Frederic," said the
Duchess, while Eleanora pulled the offending string from her
curls.</p>

<p>"Keep such adornments till you are out of tutelage," remarked
the Prince, and taking the gaudy knot threw it out of the open
window. "You, Madam, are too fond of making her a peacock and a
popinjay."</p>

<p>"Frederic," said the Duchess acidly, "your temper and your
manners are atrocious&mdash;you have no business to burst in like
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was too well aware that Eleanora was idling here. Herr
Pfiffer is looking for her, for her music."</p>

<p>Eleanora rose dutifully, contrived to cast a cushion over the
book of legends, and ran out after two deep curtsies to her
elders.</p>

<p>"You will make the girl a sickly <i>bas bleu</i>," remarked
the duchess, "with your pedants and tutors. Cannot you come here
for a week or two without bringing these creatures with you?"</p>

<p>"If she does not occupy her mind with study it will be with
worse things," replied the Prince. "She is inclined to dream and
idle and you encourage her."</p>

<p>He was a small, lean, fair, faded man, with a dry, pompous
manner of fussy self-importance; he was now secretly elated, for
he had just received Leopold and Hensdorff, a visit which he
considered very flattering. He did not intend to confide to the
Duchess, who had never seen Leopold, the identity of the young
guest; far less to his daughter; and he found the possession of
this important secret very agreeable.</p>

<p>Walking up and down the room he began talking, rather at
random, to hide his excitement. He had a harsh voice that made
the parrots restless and started the dogs growling and snapping
as he passed their baskets.</p>

<p>The Duchess, yawning, pulled him up.</p>

<p>"Have you given Prince Christian his dismissal?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but I shall. He was most insistent and high-handed,
though I must say he offered the handsomest settlements and asks
no dowry."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course one can see why&mdash;he is anxious to
connect himself with our family to cover up his own
birth&mdash;and that's what sticks with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A man like that, though, it hardly matters."</p>

<p>"Oh, doesn't it? Besides, I dislike him."</p>

<p>"Eleanora is for the Emperor, then?" asked the Duchess, with a
little pang for the heavy uncertainties that Imperial destiny
involved.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so; yes, really I think so&mdash;his cause looks
very good&mdash;and if he were really established&mdash;well, one
could hardly ask for a better match, eh?"</p>

<p>The Duchess secretly agreed, but could not resist pointing out
the weak spot in the arrangement.</p>

<p>"She will have to leave the Lutheran Church."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Prince, pettishly, "we will see about
that&mdash;perhaps not, and anyhow we shall be able to wring
large concessions for the Protestants from Hensdorff. It will
give us all a great deal of influence in affairs."</p>

<p>And he proceeded to tell of the visit of Count Hensdorff with
a young Bavarian officer, who had been urging him, in the most
flattering manner, to conclude the alliance.</p>

<p>"Rather difficult having him here at the same time with Prince
Christian, eh?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they seem on good terms. I should say that they have
concluded some bargain, and, of course, if Christian takes up the
Emperor's side again that will give him a tremendous
chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But will he," asked the old lady, shrewdly, "if Leopold gets
Eleanora? Is not that likely to send him over to the Allies in a
rage?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. He is a man of sense&mdash;there are many other
princes who would gladly give him their daughters, as I must say
I would have done myself if this other offer had not been so
tempting."</p>

<p>He smiled cunningly to himself and added:</p>

<p>"Let Eleanora come down to dinner to-night, and set her out in
the finery you are both so fond of. I want Hensdorff to take a
good report to Vienna."</p>

<p>While these two people were discussing her immediate future,
Eleanora was seated in a lower room, practising with a wizened
music master, for whom she had little taste; she had no thought
in her head but the heat of the afternoon, and how delicious it
would be, when her task was over, to coax old Charlotte to take
her into the cool, dark, green, still woods.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="first">LEOPOLD was pleased when he was able to escape
from Anhalt-Dessau and Hensdorff, and get away by himself out of
the Château of Schönbuchel, which must be, for him, a place of
restraint and humiliation. He dreaded the evening, when there
would be a formal supper and he must meet the two ladies; but he
was relieved to think that they would not know his identity, and
that, so far, he had avoided encountering Christian.</p>

<p>He passed quickly through the small park and lawns of
Schönbuchel and came out into the beautiful woods of
Dürsheim.</p>

<p>It was the hour of sunset, and an exquisite ethereal light
suffused the gorgeous scene&mdash;the majestic expanse of the
river below, the rich sweeps of forests, the undulating hills,
the hues of hyacinth and violets; the warm air was pure and soft,
and full of the clean fragrance of the trees; the whole prospect
so wide and high, so broad and lofty, with such a great expanse
of scene and sky that Leopold felt that he was standing at the
edge of the world surrounded by celestial space.</p>

<p>He entered the wood, so dark and hushed amid this last
brilliance of the day, and had not gone many paces in on the
forest path before he saw a girl seated beneath a beech
tree&mdash;Eleanora, free, happy, and singing because the tasks
of the day were over. By her side was a pottle of wild
strawberries; her wide hat hung by a ribbon on her shoulders, and
her hands were clasped round her knees; her pale, frilled dress
was dappled with shade, and she was gazing up to follow the
movements of a bird who moved through the flat clear foliage
above.</p>

<p>Leopold stood still at some distance from her, but almost
instantly she was aware of him and looked round; a glance was
sufficient to approve him as agreeable to the scene. She stopped
singing, but she did not go away.</p>

<p>A lovely hour, a lovely meeting; the young man forgot all his
vexations as if an enchantment had banished them from his mind.
Uncovering, he asked:</p>

<p>"Where do these woods lead, Fräulein, and can I continue on
this path?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," she smiled, "for I am never allowed to go
very far."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," he answered, "desire to go any further."</p>

<p>"It is delightful here," said Eleanora. "I would like to live
in the woods." She was so full of these thoughts that she could
not avoid expressing them to this stranger, who seemed so gentle
and courteous. "Is it not cool under the trees? And here, you can
see the Danube, far below."</p>

<p>He came closer to her, and stooped to see the view she pointed
out between the tree trunks; the last dance of the sunbeams
through the leaves flashed on his light hair, and Eleanora looked
at him with sudden pondering gravity.</p>

<p>"You are, sir, a stranger here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am sorry for it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not live here but I often come&mdash;here is Charlotte,
she will tell you where the woods lead."</p>

<p>The elderly lady-in-waiting, who had been some paces behind
the light walking of her mistress, now came along the narrow path
and was agitated to see the stranger. Leopold wore an
undistinguished civilian dress and she thought him some student
on his holidays. Her worldly fluster reminded Leopold who he was;
the brief magic of the moment had gone as he answered the
unspoken enquiry of her look.</p>

<p>"I am staying at Schönbuchel," he explained, "with Count
Hensdorff, and I was asking my way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Charlotte became very civil and gave long directions as to
where the paths branched and where they led. Leopold did not hear
this, though he appeared to listen; the girl's song still
troubled his mind, and he was very conscious of her presence.</p>

<p>When Charlotte had finished her directions, she spoke</p>

<p>"I hope, sir, you will have a pleasant stroll&mdash;no doubt I
shall see you again, for I, too, come from Schönbuchel."</p>

<p>"You are not," asked Leopold impulsively, "the Princess
Eleanora?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she smiled, "I am indeed she. Have you, sir, heard of
me?" she added, for she considered herself a schoolgirl and was
surprised that any one should know of her existence.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," replied Leopold, blushing
violently.</p>

<p>"Come," said Charlotte, gently drawing the girl's arm through
her own, "we shall be late&mdash;and you, sir, do not go too far,
if they expect you at supper."</p>

<p>"I shall not go at all," replied Leopold gravely. "Where could
I find a more delightful scene?"</p>

<p>He leant against the beech tree where the girl had been
sitting, and watched the two women pass between the trees towards
the Château; Eleanora looked back and smiled with gracious
candour, and Leopold felt the world enlarge, open out and bloom,
like a flower breaking from the confinement of the bud into the
completion of a rich blossom.</p>

<p>Everything about him appeared of an impossible beauty; the air
rang with the cry of birds, each separate leaf of each tree, each
blade of grass, appeared loaded with heavenly light; he could not
believe that the river winding below was an earthly stream.</p>

<p>It was strange that never before had he noticed the surpassing
loveliness of a common woodland scene, and he wondered, as he had
never wondered before, at all the hurried circumstance and noisy
incident of his short life that had so long prevented him from
coming at a moment like this.</p>

<p>"How I have been led by other people," he reflected curiously,
"been forced to this and that against my will&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sun had sunk behind the hills and the wood was suddenly
full of shadows, deeper and lesser shadows crossing into distant
dark as the trees closed in; the sky beyond seemed hollow with
the withdrawing of the sun, the earth also a vague emptiness,
even the Danube faded into an ashy greyness.</p>

<p>Leopold sighed and turned slowly back towards Schönbuchel. As
he turned into the park, doubtful of his mood and conscious of a
tremulous exaltation, he heard a low voice which broke most
rudely into his humour.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Caesar."</p>

<p>Leopold started, and looking up, for his glance had been
downcast, saw Christian mocking, lolling on a splendid marble
bench beneath a twisted, leering statue of Silenus with pipes,
that crowned a glade.</p>

<p>"Good evening, General Crack," replied Leopold coldly, stung
by the disagreeableness of this meeting.</p>

<p>Christian leaned forward and laughed; he did not rise; his hat
was on the seat beside him; he had not doffed it for Leopold.</p>

<p>"You seem in a pensive mood, Monseigneur," he remarked. "The
scene is romantic, is it not?"</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir," answered Leopold stiffly, "respect my
incognito. I would not have my presence here bruited about."</p>

<p>"Caesar's commands shall be respected," said Christian with
ironic deference. "They have my sympathy. No one," he added,
"would know Caesar without his purple&mdash;how easily is
Imperial Majesty disguised!"</p>

<p>"But not so easily offended, Highness," said Leopold
haughtily. "I shall not notice any of your
provocation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no wish to provoke you," smiled Christian. "I say,
sir, you have my sympathy&mdash;my position is much as yours, you
are Emperor of the West in the same fashion that I am Duke of
Kurland."</p>

<p>Leopold bit his full lip, and retorted as indifferently as he
could:</p>

<p>"And there the likeness ends."</p>

<p>"It does," admitted Christian. "There could hardly be two men
more unlike than you and I."</p>

<p>Leopold wished to be gone, but could not; to walk away seemed
like turning his back on an adversary; the other man held him by
his challenging air as powerfully as if he gripped him by the
hand.</p>

<p>Against his will, then, Leopold lingered; against his will he
was impressed by this bold presence in front of which he felt
insignificant. He looked, fascinated, at the gorgeous figure
adorned with military finery, the dark resolute face, with the
brilliant eyes that never seemed to falter or droop, the smooth
cheek that never seemed to change colour, the haughty lips that
never seemed to quiver; he wished that he was such an unfaltering
man, so superbly sure of himself, so contemptuous of others.</p>

<p>General Crack returned his reluctant scrutiny with a level
gaze of indifference, lounging forward on the seat and swinging
the great bullion tassels from his sword belt.</p>

<p>"We are oddly met here," he remarked.</p>

<p>"You speak," said Leopold with an effort, "as if I had
offended you. I have never been conscious of doing so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied Christian. "I, like Caesar, am above
offence."</p>

<p>Never had Leopold known any one take with him a tone so bold
as to touch insolence, and he felt his rather scornful
indifference for this man become tinged with dislike, a definite
dislike. Even the appearance of Christian repelled him; he
thought that he looked as hard and gross as the grinning, massive
figure of the sensual god behind him, and that there was
something terrible in his calm, ironic aspect; in his steady
look, so amused and penetrating.</p>

<p>"I can never work with this man," he thought. "Hensdorff does
not know what he is about to suggest it&mdash;"</p>

<p>With aversion he recalled the intrigue that revolved round the
innocent figure of the Princess Eleanora, and he walked away
quickly, resolved to ignore Christian during the short time they
should be together at Schönbuchel. He did not want to hate him,
he had always had a nervous dread of hating any one, and how
foolish to hate Christian, when there was nothing, for good or
evil, between them; yet he feared that if he saw too much of him
he would hate him; his mind, which had been so serene in the
forest a few moments ago, became confused and uncertain; his
surroundings looked ordinary in the cold last glow of
twilight.</p>

<p>He could not resist glancing back at Christian, immovable and
implacable, seated lonely beneath the stone satyr.</p>

<p>The formal supper that evening was a simple meal; the Duchess,
who did not know whom she entertained, had not put herself out
very much; the appointments were modest, but she herself flaunted
in a bespangled dress that she had worn, years ago, in Vienna at
the Hofburg and her towering wig was garnished with strings of
gems. She had also taken the trouble to set out Eleanora
prettily, but the girl was awkward, because her hair was powdered
for the first time, her dress was low and pinchingly laced, and
the necklace of square sapphires seemed heavy on her neck. The
company, too, oppressed her; every one was so much older than
herself; every one save Leopold, and he, too, seemed embarrassed
and silent. She ventured to glance at him with timid sympathy and
thought how much pleasanter it would have been if they could have
remained in the woods with Charlotte, quite late, as sometimes
they did remain, and there have watched the moon rise till it was
reflected in the waters of the Danube below.</p>

<p>Count Michael Hensdorff did not trouble to make himself very
amiable to his neighbour, the useful and plain Baroness
Charlotte, and the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau appeared in the rather
foolish light of a dull man endeavouring to disguise flattered
excitement.</p>

<p>Christian alone was at his ease; ignoring the rest of the
company, he made himself so obliging to the Duchess that she half
regretted he was not destined for Eleanora, and she began to
laugh and talk quite loudly, recalling anecdotes of her
youth.</p>

<p>As the meal proceeded, Leopold and Eleanora glanced at each
other more and more frequently across the table. A branch of
candles stood between them that cast a glow over them, that
brought them out, fair and pale, with a clear radiance against
the dark background of the room. When the dessert was brought,
Leopold leant forward and rather shyly asked Eleanora if these
were the strawberries that she had gathered in the woods? He saw
Christian looking at him.</p>

<p>"So you met in the woods?" asked Anhalt-Dessau, pleased.</p>

<p>"For a moment," said Leopold. He leant back in his chair and
gazed out of the window at the end of the room, which stood open
on the wide dark. The evening was very hot; Eleanora felt weary
in the heavy metallic brocades, in the hoops and panniers to
which she was not accustomed; she also glanced towards the
window, like one unconsciously glancing at an avenue of
escape.</p>

<p>A pause fell in the talk; even the rapid tongue of the Duchess
was silent; she was flushed and sleepy with her own good food and
her own generous wine; she made the signal for the ladies to
rise. Eleanora got up eagerly, but she was remorseful, when she
saw the mournful look in Leopold's blue eyes, to think that she
was leaving him to a boredom that she had herself escaped.</p>

<p>With the departure of the women, Anhalt-Dessau felt slightly
embarrassed; he did not know quite how to manage the situation
between these two pretenders to his daughter's hand. Leopold
seemed equally awkward and sat silent, crumbling his bread into
balls on the cloth.</p>

<p>Christian surveyed them all calmly, as if he found them
diverting, for Anhalt-Dessau was forcing a conversation about
indifferent matters on Hensdorff, who could scarcely disguise his
tedium.</p>

<p>And in the air of Leopold, in his droop and silence and
nervous fidgeting with the bread, was profound confusion and
distress.</p>

<p>Christian rose at length and carelessly begged for leave to
depart; he had, he said, letters to dictate for Pomerania and
Kurland.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he added, "I must go back to Ottenheim."</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" exclaimed Hensdorff, who thought that matters
could hardly be settled so soon.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," repeated Christian as if delivering a fiat, and
left them to themselves.</p>

<p>Sensitive to the manner of these words and this exit, Leopold,
colouring, turned to his host. There was something modest and
anxious in his manner that annoyed Hensdorff as much as it
flattered Anhalt-Dessau.</p>

<p>"I, too, must return to-morrow," he murmured. "I hope that
you, Monseigneur, will make a conclusion of the business we have
in hand."</p>

<p>"Sire, it is made," replied Anhalt-Dessau, who had been
hurried already by Hensdorff. "As to the details, those have not
yet been all decided&mdash;but," he added, both flurried and
pompous, "for my daughter, that is settled. I am deeply honoured
to give my consent to the marriage&mdash;you, may, Sire, have my
word on that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you told Prince Christian this?" asked Leopold
nervously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I gave him his reply this afternoon, Sire. I was as
courteous as possible and he took it in good humour."</p>

<p>"No doubt," thought Hensdorff drily, "with the winning card up
his sleeve."</p>

<p>"And she, the Princess Eleanora, she does not know?"
Anhalt-Dessau was surprised at this question.</p>

<p>"How should she know, who knows nothing, Sire?"</p>

<p>"Of course," murmured Leopold, "of course."</p>

<p>There was a restraint, both about him and Hensdorff, that was
noticeable even to the dull perceptions of their host, and he
thought with annoyance that perhaps this young man had not liked
his daughter, who had seemed to him to look so charming to-night
in her first grown-up dress; but he reflected that her usual
vivacity and grace had been eclipsed and that she might have made
a poor impression.</p>

<p>Stammeringly he began to excuse her, to talk of her docility,
her learning, her sweet temper; Leopold stared at him as if he
could not understand what he was saying, then rose suddenly,
which brought the other two men to their feet.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not need this," he stammered. "Of course
she&mdash;it is unnecessary to discuss her," he added abruptly,
and remained standing there, diffident and troubled, looking away
from both of them. "Hensdorff will tell you all my mind&mdash;he
understands it very well&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bowed nervously to his host and left them; Hensdorff
shrugged as the door closed.</p>

<p>"It is a boy," he remarked. "Still unstable and
capricious."</p>

<p>"He is in an awkward position," replied Anhalt-Dessau, who saw
Leopold glorified by his honours. "I find him most gracious and
affable. I am delighted, my dear Count, at this alliance," and he
could not forbear indulging a vision of himself at Vienna,
important, at his daughter's court, pompous at the Hofburg.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, so excited now he had made this great
resolution that he could not resist asking his daughter, as he
came into her little boudoir to bid her good night, whether she
liked Captain Leopold?</p>

<p>"That poor young man whom no one took any notice of?" said
Eleanora. "Yes, I liked him quite well."</p>

<p>She was puzzled by her father's sly, agitated manner and by
his question; she answered with instinctive flippancy to disguise
the fact that she had indeed been impressed favourably by the
stranger, so urbane and courteous, so elegant and modest. She
felt happy when she thought of him, and happy because her father
seemed pleased with her, and kissed her with greater affection
than usual, and never chid her about the book of legends on her
dressing table. She went to bed so, in the gayest of spirits, to
dream of the woods at sunset, and the Danube gliding away beyond
the hills.</p>

<p>But Leopold did not sleep; he had called Hensdorff into his
room and was talking with him violently and tempestuously, though
in hushed tones, remembering that he was in a stranger's
house.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="first">NEVER had Hensdorff known the young man so
difficult. He violently and positively refused to be party to the
intrigue that his minister had mapped out for him, or to make any
sacrifices to gain the services of General Crack.</p>

<p>"Let him go where he pleases&mdash;I care not at all. What I
cannot get without him I will forgo. This will lead to nothing
but disaster; I will not be so persuaded against myself."</p>

<p>"What is, then, your intention?" asked Hensdorff wearily.
"What game, sir, do you expect me to play?"</p>

<p>"None at all," replied Leopold. "Let the matter be
straightforward. I will keep my engagement with Anhalt-Dessau and
try to carry my own fortunes to success."</p>

<p>Brave, flourishing words, but Hensdorff smiled.</p>

<p>"Does, then, Your Majesty intend to marry the Princess
Eleanora?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Leopold impetuously. "It is the alliance you,
sir, found for me."</p>

<p>"But Prince Christian is more important than the lady,"
explained the minister, with an air of fatigue. "When shall I be
able to persuade Your Majesty that he is <i>essential</i> to your
cause?"</p>

<p>"Never," replied Leopold, "for I do not believe it."</p>

<p>Hensdorff cast about in his mind for some means to end this
tiresome argument; he had believed that he and Father St. Nikola
had mastered Leopold's obstinacy, and now it had started up
afresh. He looked sharply at the young man, who seemed very
flushed and agitated, who walked about and sat down and rose up
in restless nervousness; in the plainness of his dress and the
disorder of his blond locks he did not look either distinguished
or imposing, and Hensdorff, glancing him up and down, struggled
with a sick desire to drop this rebellious puppet, and with him
the whole disjointed show.</p>

<p>If only there had been something else!</p>

<p>But there was nothing.</p>

<p>Useless for one who did not believe in Heaven to renounce the
World: that would be to fall into a void.</p>

<p>"Is Your Majesty's change of mind due to the acquaintance of
the Princess?" he asked, for he had remembered Herr Lippmann's
words about Prince Christian, and if one young man, why not
another? She was, too, a pretty little creature.</p>

<p>Leopold vehemently denied this.</p>

<p>"I have hardly seen her, hardly spoken to her&mdash;it is
manifest that she is well bred and docile, but she has nothing to
do with my resolution."</p>

<p>"To what, then, is that due?"</p>

<p>"To disgust of the whole affair, to dislike of this
bargaining, intriguing&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sat down by the lamp and put his blond head in his white
hands.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Count, I am sick of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So am I," interrupted the minister drily. "Shall we then,
Sire, give everything up and become hermits?"</p>

<p>Leopold blushed at his rebuke, which he saw was intended to
turn him into ridicule.</p>

<p>"There is no other alternative," continued Hensdorff. "If you
live in the world you must live on the world's terms. I myself
have no illusions&mdash;often I ask myself, 'What is the use?'
but I go on because I do not know how to stop, because there is
nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"That is a dreadful doctrine," murmured Leopold. He thought of
the wood, the singing girl with the basket of strawberries, the
heavenly beauty of that evening hour, and he thought of this like
a way of escape from the hard, cynical, hopeless existence that
Hensdorff spoke of and in which he, too, seemed involved.</p>

<p>"You may, Sire, if you will," added Hensdorff, "consider our
obligations to your family and your Allies&mdash;while you amuse
yourself with fastidious scruples, these others hang with
harrowing anxiety on the turn of events. Hourly I expect news
that the congress has broken up and the enemy is on the move.
What, in that case, do you intend to do? Fly into the marshes of
Styria?"</p>

<p>"I shall not fly," replied Leopold hotly.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will submit to the Queen of Hungary and do
homage to her husband as Emperor? Or go to Paris and join Prince
Charles Edward as a pensioner of the French?"</p>

<p>"I do not know why you seek to inflame me!" cried Leopold
bitterly.</p>

<p>"I do not," replied Hensdorff, dispassionately and wearily. "I
merely seek to know your mind."</p>

<p>"I do not know it myself," admitted the baffled, distressed
and baited young man, "but at least I will not give up this
marriage to bribe Prince Christian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the Empire is to be sacrificed to that!" exclaimed
Hensdorff scornfully. "It is as well, Sire, that your father is
dead before he could see his policies and his efforts thrown to
the winds."</p>

<p>And he thought to himself, "The romantic young fool is taken
with the girl, and out of jealousy will not give her up."</p>

<p>Leopold read this thought in the dull, sunken eyes of
Hensdorff; he saw himself summed up as a facile, irresolute,
sentimental boy, and he put again his hands before his sensitive
face, wincing at the truth in this judgment.</p>

<p>Hensdorff rose and yawned; it was useless to prolong the
dispute; if Leopold was to fail like this he must set about
making his pact with the Queen of Hungary and that would be
difficult, for he had gone very far in services to the House of
Bavaria.</p>

<p>"I will leave Your Majesty," he remarked, and his emphasis on
the title sounded like mockery to Leopold, "to consider that by
to-morrow all must be decided."</p>

<p>"It is decided now," replied Leopold defiantly.</p>

<p>Hensdorff paused by the door.</p>

<p>"Do you recall," he asked, "all the councils and disputes, all
the advice and anxious consultations in Vienna before the
resolution was come to that at all costs Prince Christian must be
secured? Even at the cost of your sister, Sire?"</p>

<p>Leopold writhed; he did indeed remember those hideous days in
Vienna, the tedium, the boredom, the confusion, the pressure
brought on him on all sides to do what he loathed to do, the
alarms and fears&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I suppose all that," added Hensdorff, "goes for nothing.
The resolution so painfully taken is to be thrown over for a
whim?"</p>

<p>Leopold had no answer, and Hensdorff, as he departed, had one
last dry reproach to fling behind him:</p>

<p>"It is useless to dispute an empire if you are to be put out
of your way by a girl."</p>

<p>Leopold, left alone, raged at this, but the truth of it was
forced into his soul like a dart; he had been unsettled, made
irresolute, wretched, by the sight of a strange girl in a
romantic setting.</p>

<p>Until he had seen the Princess Eleanora he had been prepared
to give her up; now, even though he denied to himself that she
fascinated him, he had decided not to do so.</p>

<p>He passed a miserable night, tossing, distracted, angry with
everything; he would have been yet further discomposed had he
known that his host sat up almost to the dawn with Herr Lippmann,
absorbed in the glasses, mirrors, charts and diagrams the
astrologer expounded to him, and by that worthy's glib and
flowing talk.</p>

<p>The Prince of Anhalt-Dessau combined a rigid Lutheranism with
a vast love of the marvellous; he continually murmured,
"incredible," "impossible" to the wonders that Herr Lippmann
unfolded, but he was secretly impressed and delighted.</p>

<p>The alchemist was too acute to venture on any crude
predictions in favour of Prince Christian, but he did not fail to
work into his discourse some considerable eulogies of his
master.</p>

<p>He declared that he had, from the first, foretold the
extraordinary success of Christian, and now saw in the future a
yet brighter destiny for this favourite of fortune.</p>

<p>"And what of Leopold?" asked Anhalt-Dessau. "What is there in
store for him?"</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann snatched at this opportunity; he shrugged his
shoulders and pulled down his mouth.</p>

<p>"Disaster," he said briefly.</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau was startled.</p>

<p>"Oh?" he cried, "but his prospects look fair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do they?" smiled the alchemist, who could guess by the
other's consternation that he had promised his daughter to the
Emperor. "And what do you think of the man himself?" he added
confidentially. "I see he is here, incognito; now one of the
penetration of Your Highness must have observed his weakness, his
vacillation, his immaturity, his lack of all manly
qualities."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Anhalt-Dessau, alarmed. "I saw nothing of the
sort, I was favourably impressed by him&mdash;Count Hensdorff
told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann calmly took up the word.</p>

<p>"Count Hensdorff is an old fox, he knows how to give a turn to
things! Naturally he makes the best of Leopold. But believe me,
it will be all for nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For nothing, eh, for nothing?"</p>

<p>"He has not the material to deal with. Think, instead, of
Christian&mdash;there's a man for you! Why, he could pitch
Leopold off the throne and mount it himself if he wanted
to&mdash;he might have been Czar of all the Russias if he had
cared to marry Olga Petronova who was madly enamoured of
him&mdash;there's nothing he can't do. And his wealth! He's more
money than any one in the Empire."</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau felt uncomfortable; he mentally contrasted
Leopold and Christian, not to the advantage of the former. "It is
a pity his birth is base," he murmured.</p>

<p>"There is a doubt about that," said the alchemist boldly and
darkly. "It may yet be disclosed that he is really a Ketlar and
the Duke of Kurland."</p>

<p>"No! How is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I am not allowed to say," replied Herr Lippmann mysteriously.
"But there was a mystery and investigations are being made."</p>

<p>He spoke a half truth; some years before, Christian had
employed him to search into the painful story of his birth, but
without any result save that of confirming the fact that he was
undoubtedly the son of the Italian Columbine and possibly not the
son of the Duke of Kurland; only, by chance, had he thought of
this now as something with which to impress Anhalt-Dessau who was
plainly discomposed and lost interest in the mirrors and
telescopes, for which the alchemist was heartily thankful, as he
was weary of explaining marvels to a flaccid and credulous
mind.</p>

<p>"Of course, there is nothing in any of this," said the Prince
nervously. "One must not pay any attention to this sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"Well, Monseigneur," interrupted the astrologer, "just let me
give you this advice&mdash;if you want to put faith in either of
those men, put it in General Crack."</p>

<p>When his tedious visitor had gone, Herr Lippmann congratulated
himself on having done a good stroke of work for his master,
which he had achieved with the better will since he sincerely had
little enough faith in Leopold and a very honest admiration for
General Crack.</p>

<p>There were, however, more powerful aids than the predictions
of an astrologer coming to the assistance of Christian, whose
affairs at that moment seemed under the protection of a special
Providence.</p>

<p>With the morning came a messenger, sent on from Mölk, who had
come from Vienna almost on the heels of Leopold. He brought the
worst of news; the congress at Brussels had flown asunder in
bitter disagreement, and the well-prepared armies of the Allies
were already in movement.</p>

<p>Maréchal De Lisle, Governor of Frankfurt and now at Prague, in
command of the French forces in the Netherlands, had sent an
urgent message for Imperial assistance, and an entreaty, which
was almost a command, that Leopold would engage General Crack, to
whom, for their part, the French were ready to offer considerable
bribes.</p>

<p>With these dispatches were two feeble feminine notes for
Leopold, one from Maria Luisa, his sister, and one from the
Countess Carola.</p>

<p>Hensdorff took them all to Leopold's bedside, threw them down
on the coverlet, and stood over the dismayed young man, bidding
him read them.</p>

<p>"You see, Sire, it is exactly as I warned you."</p>

<p>Leopold spitefully tore up the Countess Carola's note without
reading it; he thought of her with distaste, and her gushing
alarms came very ill just now; irritating, too, was his sister's
timid letter, talking of the panic in the capital, begging for
his return, and asking if she were indeed to be betrothed to
Prince Christian?</p>

<p>"I do not know how to move!" he exclaimed. "Is there not any
one else, besides this man, to whom we can turn?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff had answered this protest so often that now he
received it in silence. Useless to go again through the miserable
list of the discredited, defeated generals, who were all who were
left to lead the Imperial ranks; formal, arrogant fools like
Fürth and Olivenza.</p>

<p>Leopold had risen out of bed and put on his chamber robe; he
had scarcely slept all night and under this ill news felt giddy;
he turned to the window to be rid of Hensdorff's yellow sour
face, and the loveliness of the morning blooming on the river and
the valley seemed like a reproach. Again he thought of the wood,
and the girl beneath the beech tree; and the dispatches shook in
his hand.</p>

<p>But the keen, inquisitive gaze of Hensdorff, his tormentor,
nerved him; he made an effort to control his confusion, his fear
of, and repugnance to, his task.</p>

<p>"I will," he declared, "see this man myself. Ask him to come
here, now&mdash;I must overlook his insolence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ask whom, Sire?"</p>

<p>"This General Crack&mdash;ask him to come."</p>

<p>In half an hour Christian was there, facing Leopold in the
small anteroom to the bedchamber that had been given him in the
Château Schönbuchel; the windows had been set wide open on the
valley, and the apartment was full of the pure thin Austrian air
and the bright light of early morning.</p>

<p>Leopold, in his black with the silver shoulder
knot&mdash;black and silver, the colours of the House of
Hapsburg&mdash;leaned against the wall by the windows with the
dispatches in his hand. He was, as usual, carelessly attired and
his blond hair was undressed&mdash;he had brought but one body
servant with him and was impatient of his
administrations&mdash;but Christian was set out as if he were
going on parade, with every braid, buckle and button gleaming,
his clothes without a wrinkle or a speck of dust, fresh from the
barber and the hairdresser, and as stiff and expressionless,
Leopold thought, as a wooden soldier.</p>

<p>"We have come, Highness," the Bavarian said with dignity, "to
a point when we do not need a go-between. What there is to
settle, we can settle ourselves."</p>

<p>"No doubt," answered Christian. "It is, Sire, one to me who
settles the matter. But it must be to-day that it is
settled."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," replied Leopold, tolerating him with an effort,
"you know how I am pressed. And my advisers think you are the man
I need."</p>

<p>"Sire, I have heard all this from Count Hensdorff and gave him
my answer."</p>

<p>"Not too civilly, I think," said Leopold, firing up. "By
Heaven, Monseigneur, you make it difficult for me!"</p>

<p>"Circumstance, not I, makes the difficulty," remarked
Christian unmoved. "It is not easy to beg favours of one, Sire,
you dislike&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have not disliked you," protested Leopold.</p>

<p>"You have disregarded me," replied Christian. "You do not
willingly turn to me now; you may as well, Sire, have matters
clear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you as well keep courteous," interrupted Leopold
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Remembering that I speak to Caesar? But it is not my courtesy
you want to buy, Sire."</p>

<p>"No," replied Leopold, mustering all his patience. "I bargain
with you for your sword, Highness. If you will take command of
all my forces&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want Anhalt-Dessau's daughter," said Christian, coldly. "I
go neither up nor down from that demand."</p>

<p>"I will not give it," replied Leopold, with a shuddering
resolution.</p>

<p>"Then I daresay that we shall meet on the battlefield, Sire,
for I go at once to join the Queen of Hungary's husband."</p>

<p>He turned as if to leave the room; only the sight of the fatal
dispatches in his hand gave Leopold the resolution to speak any
words to stay his going.</p>

<p>"Why are you so set on this lady?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why are you so set on withholding her?" counter-demanded
Christian.</p>

<p>"Anhalt-Dessau has already refused her to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will withdraw that refusal if you bid him&mdash;when
Caesar is out of the lists, General Crack may be good
enough."</p>

<p>Leopold looked away, out of the window, to refresh himself by
that exquisite expanse of sunny landscape, and to be rid of the
sight of that cold showy face General Crack bent on him.</p>

<p>"I," continued the implacable soldier, "am no more eager to
serve under you, Sire, than you are eager to employ me. But since
I must set some man up, it may as well be you if you will pay my
price."</p>

<p>"Any price but the price you ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have nothing else to offer that I care about," smiled
Christian. "Neither your honours, Sire, nor your sister tempt
me."</p>

<p>This was too much for Leopold; he threw down the dispatches
into the window seat.</p>

<p>"Then you must go," he declared hotly, "for I see we can
conclude no business."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell Count Hensdorff so?" asked Christian mockingly.
"Come, Sire, do not make all this delay and question. I do not
ask what you should grudge."</p>

<p>The words made Leopold ashamed of the weight he had given to
his own speech; he felt insignificant before the other's irony;
this time yesterday he had not seen her&mdash;a girl in a wood!
he might so soon forget; he felt exhausted by his own effort at
strength and resolution.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff and Father St. Nikola (who had accompanied the
dispatch rider) entered showing grave faces; neither of them had
trusted Leopold to bring this momentous interview to a
satisfactory climax. At sight of them Leopold felt himself hemmed
in, forced, overwhelmed as usual when they together bore down on
him.</p>

<p>He sank in the window seat and put a trembling hand to his
forehead. He thought, "She was destined for me, she was almost
mine, and they will take her away."</p>

<p>"His Imperial Majesty," said Christian, "refuses my
terms."</p>

<p>At that, Leopold heard the two others, minister and priest,
talking together; harshly, impatiently, persuading him,
reproaching him, pelting him with State arguments till his head
ached and his heart sickened.</p>

<p>And what had he to oppose to all this wisdom? A few moments in
a wood at sunset.</p>

<p>His two tormentors persisted, to the limit of the endurance of
his nerves; they seemed to him to be bearing down on him,
enclosing him with their dark figures, their old, harsh faces,
their insistent voices; and, worse than them even, he was
conscious of General Crack, silent, assured, waiting with the
sleek patience of a beast certain of its prey.</p>

<p>After half an hour of this torture, Leopold gave way, with a
shudder of disgust for himself, with a quiver of hatred for
them.</p>

<p>"Settle it, then!" he cried to Hensdorff. "Only let me begone.
Ay, you are all very cunning, but this may be a bad day's work
for some of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Christian's dark eyes, void of all expression, turned slowly
on him as he gave this threat, which he himself felt to be
futile. It was the last humiliation for Leopold that his rival
showed no sign of triumph; now that Christian had gained his
point he preserved the same icy indifference that he had shown
while it was in debate; a hateful pose, this, of godlike
calm!</p>

<p>Passionately, Leopold wished that he could emulate such
serenity; as he left them he was swearing hotly to himself, "If I
ever have any power I will break that man&mdash;God, how I will
break him."</p>

<p>He wished to leave Schönbuchel without being observed, but he
was not so fortunate as to achieve this. While he was hurriedly
having his horse out (for he meant to ride at once and alone to
Vienna) Eleanora came out on one of the little bowed balconies
over the forecourt. She had been much petted that morning, for
her father had told the Duchess the secret of Captain Leopold's
identity and of the betrothal.</p>

<p>She smiled candidly at the young man, for she had been assured
that he had come to be her companion and that she might walk with
him in the woods and along the banks of the Danube, for they
wished her to know her destined husband.</p>

<p>"Now, to-day, when Charlotte is ready, we can take that walk
in the forest," she said, as she tied the wide ribbons of her
straw hat under her chin. "It is so beautiful! And we can picnic
in the woods."</p>

<p>These words were like a blow over the heart to Leopold. He
stared at her so strangely that she thought him ill, and a tender
concern clouded her gaiety.</p>

<p>"Something has happened?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"I must go back to Vienna," he answered. "I shall never be
able to walk in those woods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go!" cried Eleanora, piteously (she had dreamt of
him all night). "Back to the city, when here it is so
lovely?"</p>

<p>"It is not for me," said Leopold in bitter distress. He could
not bring himself to say "good-bye" but mounted and rode
away.</p>

<p>But he must pause again, for by the gates was the Duchess,
leaning on her stick, alarmed at his departure, at his hurried
looks. He saluted her mechanically and she dropped a trembling
curtsy.</p>

<p>"Sire," she stammered, "they tell me that you are the
Emperor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They tell you wrong, Madam," he replied, "for I am nothing,
nothing."</p>

<p>He rode away, alone.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">LEOPOLD rode slowly along the banks of the
Danube towards Vienna. He did not pause till he had reached the
grandiose edifice of Mölk, forty miles from the capital. He had
not brought with him his modest baggage or his one body servant;
save for a few crowns in his pocket he was unequipped for the
journey; he lingered now, wretched, undecided, thinking of his
destination with vexation and bitter distaste.</p>

<p>He halted at the rough inn which was one of the cluster of
miserable houses at the foot of the bold jutting rock from which
rose the sweeping walls and lordly cupolas of Mölk. Dismounting,
he ordered food; to be served outside, for he could not endure
the filthy interior of the inn. By the rude table under the
rusty, withered vine he watched the flies buzzing in and out of
the soiled beer mugs, while by his feet the starving fowls
scratched in the dust; a melancholy, a sordid scene scarcely
redeemed even by the grand beauty of the landscape.</p>

<p>He overheard two peasants drinking near him talk about the
hermit who lived the other side of the gorge. This word "hermit"
attracted him&mdash;he remembered what Hensdorff had said when he
suggested he would "throw it all up and become a hermit."</p>

<p>Leopold wondered idly what a hermit really was. He would
snatch at any delay if he could only put off the moment of his
arrival in Vienna&mdash;the moment when the dull formality of the
Hofburg would close over him again.</p>

<p>The figure of the Princess Eleanora continued to dance before
his eyes like a spark of gold. He could not believe he had
actually seen her standing on the balcony, saying "Don't go,
don't go away." Or had she really said that or had it merely been
a cry, an appeal in her blue eyes, not on her trembling lips? He
could see her beneath the beech with her pottle of strawberries.
It might have been a dream for all the unearthly ravishment of
beauty it held, that picture; but he knew that she was left
behind in Schönbuchel, wondering why he had ridden away, at this
moment, probably wondering that ...</p>

<p>He asked the ragged landlord, who seemed to consider him the
same quality as the other travellers, where this hermit lived?
The fellow stupidly replied that it was the other side of the
gorge, he believed.</p>

<p>"If you cross the ravine at the bridge you will see the
hermit's cave."</p>

<p>Leopold left his horse in the wretched stable and went out in
search of this bridge; a hermit seemed an odd, fantastic
personage; he might be full of good advice; Leopold was always
searching for good advice.</p>

<p>By mid afternoon, in the great blaze of the heat, he had
discovered the bridge. He was tired; the scenery seemed to
overpower him, the rocks were too high, too brightly coloured,
the sky too blue, the sun too fierce in the thin air. He was glad
of the shadow that lay on the ravine; he was glad of those darker
shadows in the recesses of the jutting rocks and of that cool
steady swirl of water beneath the slender bridge and of the paler
shade of the trees beyond bridge and rocks.</p>

<p>Soon he found the hermit; the man lived in a cave that had
been partially hollowed out by human hands. It was overhung with
clusters of bright, clear, sharp-fronded ferns; in front of this
rude habitation was a little plot of cultivated ground in which
grew vegetables and a few apple trees.</p>

<p>Leopold paused, sat down on a smooth stone, and looked at this
little remote garden, so different from any garden he had seen
before. It was very beautiful, sheltered from the sun by the
enormous boughs of the trees that grew high up the rock and with
those beautiful knots and clusters of all manner of plumy, airy
ferns, vivid and gorgeous; the dripping of the crystal waters
which slid down from the upper rock cast a silver lustre over the
dark surface of the stone.</p>

<p>Leopold was not wishful to disturb the hermit, he felt
fatigued and strange sitting here in this out-of-the-way spot. It
seemed impossible that this very morning he had flung out of
Schönbuchel in such hot, dull fury.</p>

<p>Presently the hermit himself appeared leading a couple of
white goats. There was nothing fantastic about his appearance; he
was dressed like any peasant in a rude coat girdled round the
waist; a battered hat protected his head from the sun, a ragged
beard descended to his waist.</p>

<p>He greeted Leopold without surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you," asked the young man negligently, "the hermit?"</p>

<p>"Yea," replied the other, smiling, "that is what they call me
round about here. You know the odd words people use?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leopold. "Words do not mean very much to me, but I
am forced very often to regard them. You, then, are the
hermit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and who are you?"</p>

<p>Leopold replied as he had replied to the Duchess, "I am
nothing," and with an echo of that deep bitterness.</p>

<p>"Nothing then speaks to nothing," replied the other man.

<p>"Why," asked Leopold, curiously, "do you live here retired
from the world?"</p>

<p>"And why," was the reply, "do you live in the world?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Leopold.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," smiled the other. "Will you come in and have a
meal?"</p>

<p>Leopold answered that he had already partaken of wine and
refreshment in the atrocious inn below.</p>

<p>"What made you come up here?" asked the recluse.

<p>"Curiosity," admitted Leopold.</p>

<p>The hermit remarked that no other reason ever brought any one
up to these lonely defiles; Leopold, leaning forward with his
long face in his hand, and his elbow on his knee, demanded why
this man had discarded the world, why he lived in this curious
spot?</p>

<p>The hermit did not seem wishful to answer these questions; he
tethered his goats to the stump of an old tree, seated himself on
one of the smooth boulders ringed with ferns close to
Leopold.</p>

<p>"The place," remarked the young man, "is extraordinarily
beautiful."</p>

<p>"I do not know," smiled the hermit, "that beauty makes very
much difference to anything. I cease to notice the beauty, and
the peace; both have become commonplace to me."</p>

<p>"You might as well, then," pondered Leopold, "live in a
city."</p>

<p>The hermit said that he might as well, save that in the city
one must spend money, and he had never had money nor the capacity
to earn any; here he was freed of that anxiety; at best, able to
let life slip through his fingers as the fine sand slipped
through the hour glass, without sound. Leopold was pleased by
this simile, soothed by the way it was given; he wondered if this
state of mind was more easily achieved in these solitudes than in
those grand halls where he repined so fretfully.</p>

<p>"I," he said, wistfully, "have often wished to retire from the
world; it seems impossible&mdash;I am hemmed in all
directions."</p>

<p>"Every one says that," replied the hermit. "There is no one so
mean or so poor or so insignificant that he does not believe
himself chained down by some circumstance."</p>

<p>"Supposing," asked Leopold, smiling at this misreading of him,
"that you were the Emperor?"</p>

<p>The hermit replied mildly that he could not suppose any such
thing. "I have forgotten," he admitted, "that there is such a
person as the Emperor, and I pity him."</p>

<p>"So," said Leopold, "do I." and then he asked suddenly: "What
do you think of hatred? Is not it a terrible thing&mdash;hatred?
It is worse to hate than it is to be hated."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed the hermit. "You may avoid the hatred
given out by some one else but you cannot avoid the hatred that
you give out."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by avoid?" asked Leopold. "What is it that I
should avoid?"</p>

<p>"Hatred," answered the old man placidly.</p>

<p>"Hatred, then," mused Leopold, "is a disaster. I thought so, I
felt that, but I cannot control it; I must and I do hate."</p>

<p>"That," said the hermit, "is very terrible; worse for you than
for the person you hate."</p>

<p>"I know," said Leopold. "It is unavoidable; I hate because I
am weak&mdash;I have no courage to defend myself openly therefore
I revenge myself secretly."</p>

<p>He dropped his slender right hand from his cheek and clasped
it in his left across his knee. The hermit noted the grace and
fineness of those hands.</p>

<p>"You are very young and elegant to deal in such deep matters,"
he observed.</p>

<p>"I am," sighed Leopold, "both young and foolish, and extremely
distressed; I go here and there to find comfort."</p>

<p>"You think you might discover it in my retreat?" suggested the
hermit.</p>

<p>"It is possible, but not, I think, very probable."</p>

<p>"You look to me like one of those worldly men who will only
find consolation from worldly disasters in worldly affairs."</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me of the world," said Leopold, "for there I
have been utterly defeated."</p>

<p>Against the grand and jocund landscape he saw the slight
figure of a dreaming girl standing on the balcony in the early
sunshine, her eyes, or her lips, or her whole being, saying,
"Don't go away,"&mdash;and he had gone; ridden away, shamed.</p>

<p>"What is your station in life," asked the hermit, "who are
already so young and so troubled?"</p>

<p>"My station in life," said Leopold, "is my greatest trouble. I
want to escape from it and I can't."</p>

<p>"It is yourself you cannot escape from," said the hermit, "not
your station. If you were to live up here with me you would not
be able to escape either."</p>

<p>"You, then," urged Leopold, "are as unhappy here as you were
in the world?"</p>

<p>The hermit replied that he had never been unhappy
anywhere.</p>

<p>Leopold gazed forlornly round the luxurious landscape.</p>

<p>"Yesterday this seemed magic to me," he complained, "but
to-day it seems all tarnished, the bloom rubbed off, the trees look rusty and the water foul, the sky void."</p>

<p>"You, I suppose," remarked the hermit, "think that Nature
takes the colour of men's moods. Nature, of course, is quite
indifferent as to whether you admire her or don't admire her;
whether she is beautiful or ugly in your sight."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Leopold gloomily. "Yesterday, as I said,
I felt that I was in a paradise; now I seem to see grim rocks, a
dreadful whirl of purposeless water, expanses of haunted
forests."</p>

<p>"You speak very extravagantly," smiled the hermit. "I think
you are one of those fantastic young men who are rather fond of
indulging in fabling dreams and the grotesque and unlikely."</p>

<p>"My story," replied Leopold, "is most commonplace. There is
nothing grotesque or unlikely about it. I am merely weak and
foolish&mdash;overweighted by my own cowardice, my own failure,
the sense that I shall be driven to do something mean and
vile&mdash;yes, I feel I shall commit some dreadful action!"</p>

<p>The old, dry man received these outbursts placidly. He did not
seem in the least moved either by the stranger's presence or by
his emotion; he occupied himself in gazing at his goats and
rearranging their ropes round the stump of the tree where he had
fastened them.</p>

<p>"You seem," remarked Leopold, ironically, "to find those
animals more interesting than myself."</p>

<p>"They are certainly," smiled the hermit, "more peaceful
companions."</p>

<p>"Well," said Leopold, "I'll go on my way. I am bound for
Vienna."</p>

<p>"Vienna is no doubt a beautiful city&mdash;I was there once in
my youth."</p>

<p>"Whether it is beautiful or not, I don't know," said Leopold.
"I see very little of it. I spend my time in one vast house
surrounded by dull and tiresome people who plague me to do this
and that, things that I detest doing, things that I don't even
wish to hear of."</p>

<p>"I don't know how I can help you."</p>

<p>"I thought," sighed the young man, "that you might tell me the
secret of peace."</p>

<p>"How can I tell you that? It's like talking to a general who
wants to know how to set various troops in order. If you have not
the power of authority, no one can give it to you. If you can't
command your own soul, how can I give you enlightenment how to do
so?"</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Leopold, desperately, "if I were to live
as you live here, retired to some cave, some grotto overlooking
the Danube, with a couple of goats and my fruit trees and my
little bit of garden&mdash;live here, I could forget?"</p>

<p>"Forget what?"</p>

<p>"Forget my own weakness."</p>

<p>"No, because that very weakness would drive you back into the
world, and you would fret and fume here as much as you do in a
palace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know that I have anything to do with palaces?"
demanded Leopold.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the hermit, "but I guessed; you have a
strange air that does not fit into any occupation that I know of.
I put you down as one who does live in&mdash;well, grand houses,
one who has always been waited on, pampered, flattered, spoiled,
eh? Why is Vienna so particularly detestable to you? Why do you
go there? There are other places even in Austria. Though I hear
that everywhere there is tumult and war, there must be a corner
of the earth for a young man like you, comely enough and I
suppose rich enough to find a little pleasure."</p>

<p>"To find pleasure," said Leopold, "is not exactly what I
wish."</p>

<p>"What do you exactly wish?" asked the hermit. "Though, of
course, that is a foolish question. No man knows his own
mind."</p>

<p>"I know mine," answered Leopold at once. "I wish to be noble;
I wish to act with grandeur."</p>

<p>"That," said the hermit, "is not a very likely thing for you
to accomplish. I don't read you as one likely to be either grand
or noble. Still, who knows? You are very young."</p>

<p>"I am not," remarked Leopold, "perhaps so young as you think.
It seems to me that I have lived a hundred years and every one of
them boring."</p>

<p>He felt infinitely lonely and forlorn; there was no help to be
got here; he stared at the hermit with a sense of hostility; the
man's face looked sinister, mocking, imbecile as one of his own
goats or that statue of Pan under which Christian had
lounged.</p>

<p>It now seemed impossible to him that he could face again
Hensdorff, or Prince Christian, whose services he had bought at
such a terrible price&mdash;the price of his own
character&mdash;his own soul. He had committed before many
actions which seemed even to himself weak and foolish; but never
before had he committed such an action as that in which he had
abandoned Princess Eleanora to Christian.</p>

<p>He could not defend himself, nor explain himself; he viewed
the events of the last few days with complete misery: misery
which seemed to him degrading. But he had not even the strength
left to turn aside, to abandon everything and remain with this
man even for a few days in this lonely place. He was afraid of
Hensdorff finding him, afraid of Father St. Nikola coming down
from Mölk to argue with him; afraid of the whole pack of them on
his trail, hunting and hounding him. He would rather go to Vienna
and face them than that they should follow him, track him down,
round him up, bear him away&mdash;for he was utterly unable to
resist them.</p>

<p>"Did you ever," he cried, "hear a more grotesque title than
that of Caesar Augustus?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," remarked the hermit, "it is founded on truth, and
one day meant something."</p>

<p>"To-day," said Leopold, "it means nothing." And he asked,
miserably: "Don't you think we've got to the end of things? Do
you think that things can really go on any further? Everything
seems to me stale&mdash;worse than stale, rotten, done for,
corrupt, falling to pieces with decay."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'everything'?" asked the hermit
cautiously.</p>

<p>"I mean the world, our civilization&mdash;corrupt,
rotten!"</p>

<p>"You don't think," mused the hermit, "that there is anything
more to come&mdash;that we can go any further&mdash;that good,
perhaps, is coming out of all this evil, new life out of the
rotting ground?"</p>

<p>"New life?" cried Leopold. "I don't. I think that everything
is done for, finished. I see no hope in any direction,
anywhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hermit said he was not talking about a resurrection, but
of something new coming from something old. What it was, he
declared, it was impossible to see, but surely something out of
corruption, a new life...</p>

<p>Leopold saw nothing of this. He saw everything round him as he
had said: decayed, stinking.</p>

<p>"You must have been very unfairly treated," smiled the hermit,
"to have come to this conclusion so soon in your career. You
bother and disturb me, sitting there looking so gloomy, with your
pale face and downcast eyes. I wish you'd go on your way and
leave me to myself."</p>

<p>"You are not, then, sufficient of a philosopher," said Leopold
with some irony, "to contemplate the misery of another with
equanimity?"</p>

<p>"I have no philosophy at all," remarked the hermit. "I am
merely getting through life somehow&mdash;as best I can, I
suppose."</p>

<p>Leopold rose. He found no more consolation here than he had
found with the Jesuits or with the monks, with Hensdorff or with
Christian. All the whole world seemed to have become distorted,
he remarked&mdash;even the landscape, which was stale, tawdry,
ugly, brutal.</p>

<p>"I believe I could have been saved from all this," he
remarked, "but I threw my chance away. Yesterday in a wood I saw
something that seemed as if it were going to save me."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the hermit, waiting.</p>

<p>"I hadn't the courage to follow it up. I hadn't the courage to
take it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would not have helped you had you done so. Very
often these are delusions&mdash;these supposed chances."</p>

<p>"This was no deception," declared Leopold. "If I had been left
alone, and if I had had the strength to do what I wanted to do:
if I had followed her&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hermit pounced on the word.</p>

<p>"Her! It's a woman, then, at the bottom of it all? Just a
commonplace love affair!"</p>

<p>"No," cried Leopold, violently, "no! I don't love any one or
anything; there's no love affair in this. I am thinking of
myself&mdash;of my own character&mdash;what happened to me; what
I lost yesterday and shall never get again."</p>

<p>He drew his cloak round him and walked rapidly away down the
ravine, following the path made by the hermit in his comings to
and fro.</p>

<p>He felt now that this fantastic conversation had proved a
further act of folly on his part; no good had been gained by
it&mdash;in fact, only further confusion. There was no way out
for him. If he could not face breaking away from life, he must
face life, or&mdash;</p>

<p>He paused on the crazy little wooden bridge which had been
built by the monks over the ravine, and looked down into the
bubbling floods below. He would really have liked to end
everything that way, but a certain cowardice held him back. He
had been brave enough in battle on several occasions, but he
could not face the sudden plunge into the black waters which
foamed beneath the bridge. Sighing, he thought of Eleanora; he
thought of her with tenderness and sentiment. He believed, if he
preserved his own life, he might be useful to her one of these
ugly days. He might be able to be of some service to her,
secretly, just as in the same way he might be able to be of some
disservice to Christian, also secretly. What had Hensdorff
hinted? When he had done with the mercenary soldier he might be
revenged on him, in the same way that Ferdinand of Styria had
been revenged on Wallenstein.</p>

<p>This was a cruel thought from which the fastidious mind of
Leopold shrank; yet it came again and again, and he almost
encouraged it. Yes, it was the sole pleasure that for the moment
he knew: the thought that one day he might be revenged on
Christian. Revenge! That was a very stupid and childish word! Yet
he liked to turn it over and over. It would be pleasant if one
day he could make a mock of Christian, see him down beneath him,
be able to show him mercy or compassion, or hardness or justice,
just as he chose! How scornful, how insolent Christian had been!
How he had flouted him, sneered at him, humiliated him! And worse
than that: how he had most violently got him into a corner and
pinned him down to a mean, despicable action!</p>

<p>Leopold, staring at the dark water below and the dark rocks
above, the bright, pale sky high above the precipice, thought
that he would like to live, not so much in the thought of proving
one day of service to Eleanora, but in avenging
himself&mdash;yes, he could think of no other word than
revenge&mdash;on Christian.</p>

<p>Well he knew the hurt of hatred; well he knew that he, and not
Christian, would be hurt by this passionate loathing. But he
could not control it, much less cast it off. He could not help
indulging the hope that one day he might see that dark, beautiful
face flushed with shame or rage, see that erect, dandified figure
bent in misery or pain, see the superb, insolent, arrogant
base-born adventurer completely and absolutely at his mercy&mdash;the mercy of Imperial Caesar.</p>

<p>He brooded over these hot thoughts as he returned to the inn.
After all, Hensdorff was confident that Christian would put him
on the Imperial throne and make him Emperor indeed. Hensdorff was
shrewd enough; he might be right.</p>

<p>Emperor Caesar! Well, that would mean some power&mdash;even in
these days&mdash;the most splendid of pretensions yet. Meanwhile,
Eleanora must suffer, as he had no doubt she had already
suffered&mdash;and the thought of this suffering was unbearable.
There was his sister, too: another forsaken woman on his
conscience; he had to tell her how Christian had rejected her
hand. She would not take that easily, he knew: proud and
sensitive, as he was proud and sensitive; weak and foolish as he
was weak and foolish. She would ill be able to endure the
atrocious slight.</p>

<p>Well, he had paid Christian his price; there was always that
to remember. Now he would have what he had paid for: no doubt the
man was a great general; if he was able to hold back the Allies
now sweeping across the Empire, Leopold might indeed be Emperor
at last. And once he was Emperor he would be able to adjust these
things, the affairs of Eleanora, the affairs of his sister, the
affairs of Christian himself; he might, he brooded, even be
avenged on all of them&mdash;even on Father St. Nikola, who, he
felt, had betrayed him; even on Hensdorff, who, he <i>knew</i>,
had betrayed him; even on that miserable weakling, Anhalt-Dessau,
the old ruffian! He thought with desperate irritation of all
these people. No one had stood by him&mdash;no one had tried to
strengthen him. They had all been against him, in a conspiracy
against him and his honour. Well, perhaps one day he might be
able to form a conspiracy against them! For he would have power
when he had conquered the Allies, when he was Emperor, and
Christian had been paid...</p>

<p>"I," mused Leopold, half aloud, "when I am Emperor, will have
no more pity on them than they will have pity on me! They have no
pity on my weakness and folly: I will have no pity on their greed
and their treachery."</p>

<p>He returned to the inn, fetched his horse, and turned
reluctantly towards his ostentatious capital. Slower and slower
he rode; everything oppressed him&mdash;even the magnificence of
the scenery and the brightness of the sunshine.</p>

<p>He lost the sense of his own identity&mdash;felt as one of the
meanest of those who, Hensdorff declared, were his subjects; felt
fellowship with the wretched peasantry whom he saw by the
roadside, working in the fields heavy with the harvest, or
wandering by the river banks.</p>

<p>He slept that night in another poor inn, and with the dawn was
on the road again. Linger as he would, he must at last see the
towers of Vienna in the distance, rising golden and glorious in
the suffuse and glowing evening light.</p>

<p>How alien and hateful the city was to him! How he wished he
were returning to the pleasant squares and noble streets of
Munich, on his native plain of Bavaria.</p>

<p>He cursed the remote and hateful connection with the
Hapsburgs, which had given him the dangerous destiny of honour to
which he was so unsuited. A man like Christian should have worn
the diadem...There was the type needed, there was the hard
cruelty, the cold arrogance of one who should assume the
dictatorship of mankind.</p>

<p>Leopold muffled his cloak round his shoulders and pulled down
his hat, fearful lest one of the now more frequent passers-by
should recognize him for what he was&mdash;the Emperor.</p>

<p>He enjoyed a vague and elusive popularity in Vienna. A gay and
light-hearted people did homage to his charm and his youth and
sincerity. But he was now in no mood for popular acclamation. The
nearer he approached to the gates, the more he began nervously to
worry over his meeting with his sister and the Countess Carola.
On the one he had to inflict a disappointment, and on the other a
slight, for he did not intend to renew any intimacy with the
woman for whom he had so long indulged in a sentimental
friendship.</p>

<p>That glimpse of Eleanora had made him loathe the image of the
Countess Carola. He was, too, shudderingly sensitive on the
subject of his sister; hateful as it had been to offer her to
Christian, how much more hateful to have to tell her that she had
been refused. She would, no doubt, be relieved by her escape, but
she would detest the manner of her escape.</p>

<p>He was fond of his sister; he wished to protect her, yet,
because she was like himself, she irritated him: she had the same
faults, the same failings, the same weaknesses, the same facile
charm and delicate grace. Looking at her he felt as if he were
looking into a mirror. He wished she had been different: to
correct her was to correct himself, to chide her was to chide
himself.</p>

<p>He passed into the crowded streets, where the people went
cheerfully to and fro beneath the florid palaces as if there were
no such things as war or politics.</p>

<p>No one recognized him. Indeed, he looked travel-stained and
weary enough, and his notable face was hidden.</p>

<p>"If I had never returned from this secret journey," he
thought, bitterly, "what would they have done? Found another
puppet, I suppose! At least I can hardly believe that I would
have been missed!"</p>

<p>But he had returned. He had not had the strength to stay away.
His impressionable nature seemed to receive a stimulus from the
gaiety of the beautiful town. The images of Eleanora and
Christian seemed to fade away under the influence of gay and
opulent streets&mdash;the traffic of coaches, people on horse and
foot.</p>

<p>He rode slowly and unobserved past the arid stiff magnificence
of his own overpowering palace, the Hofburg, and into the Court
of Honour&mdash;blank and bleak beneath the blank, bleak
facade.</p>

<p>The lackeys lounging in the great doorway were the first to
recognize him; the Imperial Hussars had failed to do so. He put
them aside impatiently and went direct to his own apartments
through tedious, glittering corridors. He was weary, and had a
headache; his limbs were fatigued by three days' riding.</p>

<p>After hastily and carelessly adjusting his toilet in the
alien, pompous room, he sent for the Archduchess, as the Princess
Maria Luisa was named since her father's brief and precarious
elevation.</p>

<p>This agitated, expectant lady came at once, with a pale face
and a look of alarm, which further vexed the despondent Leopold.
They embraced each other with nervous and timid affection.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, hysterically, "how delighted I am to have
you back! How long it has seemed since you have been away! Was it
any use? Have you had any success? It is so dull here!"</p>

<p>"Success!" he echoed, bitterly. "Well, I don't know; I've
struck a bargain with Christian of Kurland, as he calls
himself."</p>

<p>"A bargain?" she repeated, timidly, biting her full lip.

<p>"Yes; but you are out of that pact."</p>

<p>The words sounded brutal. He wished he could recall them; but
how else put the matter?</p>

<p>She flushed hotly&mdash;she had his defect of easy
blushing&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Leopold? This is grossly put."</p>

<p>"I mean I have been able to spare you. It is another woman's
sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Sacrifice?" replied Maria Luisa, bewildered. "Who has been
sacrificed?"</p>

<p>Leopold could not mention the name of the Princess Eleanora.
He replied impatiently, and with a touch of temper:</p>

<p>"It does not matter to you; the bargain has been made. Prince
Christian is going to command my armies. It was Hensdorff's
affair, not mine. You must ask him for the tale."</p>

<p>"The tale, what do you mean, Leopold?" she asked, blushingly
hesitant and nervous. "Did you go to Prince Christian with an
offer of my hand?" she added with faltering insistence.</p>

<p>"I was able," replied Leopold, "to spare you; at least we have
not come to that degradation. Prince Christian will take charge
of my armies without the price of your hand."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa turned away abruptly; she appeared extremely
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she murmured. "And you, and your marriage?"

<p>Leopold laughed, almost hysterically.</p>

<p>"I and my marriage!" he cried. "Well, I did not come to that,
either."</p>

<p>"You mean," asked his sister, "that nothing has been arranged?
What was the sense, then, of your visit to Anhalt-Dessau?"</p>

<p>"There was no sense," sneered Leopold. "There's no sense in
any of us. We're just whirled along, like leaves in a wind.
<i>Sense</i>? What do you expect sense for, from me, my dear
sister?"</p>

<p>She looked at him apprehensively, with, he thought, temper and
fear; and he resented this though he knew she had been badly
treated.</p>

<p>"You'd better ask Hensdorff that," he replied in vexation. "I
can't talk now; I've been riding all day, and my head aches. I'm
exhausted."</p>

<p>"I, too, am exhausted. The tension here has been intolerable;
the situation impossible. I wish we had remained in Munich, and
not undertaken any of this!"</p>

<p>"Don't voice my own weakness!" he cried, in yet deeper
vexation. "That, too, is what I wish. But what is the use of it?
Here we are, and we haven't the strength to get out; therefore
we've got to find the strength to go on."</p>

<p>"Where's Hensdorff?" she asked, lost and bewildered.</p>

<p>"Where's Hensdorff? Hensdorff is coming; and, as I say, you'd
better ask him all about these things&mdash;about Eleanora, about
Christian, about our marriages, about everything. I believed he
had found a wife for me and a husband for you. Ask him!"</p>

<p>"You're overwrought," murmured the Archduchess. "Something has
gone wrong!"</p>

<p>He did not deny this.</p>

<p>"It has been dreadful here," she went on, trembling.
"Dreadful. I haven't known where to turn or what to do."</p>

<p>He frowned, with pity for her and contempt for himself, and
compassion for both of them.</p>

<p>"Christian will save us, no doubt," he exclaimed. "We must
both rely on Christian, this Kurland upstart."</p>

<p>She winced before the bitterness of this sneer; she was
altogether dismayed, undone, frightened.</p>

<p>"How will you have any hold over Christian?" she asked him, on
a half sob.</p>

<p>Leopold took a desperate turn or two about the splendid,
over-furnished long and lofty <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>"Because he has been paid!" he cried with violence. "I've paid
him all he asked. A fine price, too."</p>

<p>"What price?" asked Maria Luisa, still more startled. "What
price have you paid him?"</p>

<p>She spoke in a low, agitated voice, but it echoed horribly in
the veering heart of Leopold. The question made him aghast; it
was one he could not answer; in his own dismay he felt a random
impulse of pity for his sister, standing there so childlike and
distressed in her tight-laced heavy gown and ponderous headdress.
He put his arm round her slender shoulders, and looked at her
affectionately with wrinkled brows above his blue eyes. She clung
to him immediately with an instant response to his affectionate
caress; they stood close together in this magnificent void as if
for protection against the assaults of destiny; they stared into
the vast mirror in front of them, reflecting so many other
mirrors, so many tall doors&mdash;reflections and exits encircled
them; and in each of those long, pale faces, with those Imperial
features showing in the glass like drowned shadows in a lake, was
apprehension leaping into alarm.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>

<p class="first">COUNT MICHAEL HENSDORFF'S ally, Lieutenant
Gabor, had watched with delight the hasty departure of Leopold.
From an upper window his ashy, sunk eyes, cunning in his lean,
swarthy face, had watched the Emperor ride away in
discomfiture.</p>

<p>The defeat of Leopold and the triumph of Christian were in
every way to the Transylvanian's satisfaction. The scheme had
been of his own suggesting and of his own promoting, and he stood
to gain greatly from it. He had served General Crack for several
years, at great advantage to himself, but most reluctantly, for
he disliked Christian, and he was quite aware that Christian
despised him.</p>

<p>This was the first time that he had observed any weakness in
his master. That implacable face and erect figure had never
before given any sign whatever of any emotion, either of
exaltation after a victory or of discomfiture after defeat, in
the presence of his jackal.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor had watched him closely&mdash;spied upon
him&mdash;hoping to discover in him some trace of feebleness,
some trace of emotion by which he could get a mastery over him.
Such faults as Christian possessed were not those that Gabor
could profit by; arrogance and vanity were impervious alike to
flattery and servility. Now, under his superb mask of superhuman
indifference to mundane affairs, he had betrayed a very
considerable weakness, a stupid infatuation for a silly little
girl in whom Gabor could see nothing but mere voluptuous charm,
and Gabor had been quick to seize the chance.</p>

<p>He had intrigued with Hensdorff on the subject; he had played
for Christian and had snared him; he had made him buy, at a quite
ridiculous price, this useless ordinary creature. Marriage, and
service to Leopold! Christian had actually paid that monstrous
price&mdash;monstrous for such a man to pay for a woman like
Eleanora. Gabor had often seen him pass slightly by brighter and
more resplendent beauties. Now, leaning out of the ornate window,
he jeered to himself about Christian and about Leopold.</p>

<p>"That cock crew very loud, and flew away at the first clap of
hands!" he muttered to himself. "Well, we'll see whether even
General Crack can make a Caesar of that popinjay!"</p>

<p>But, if he could do so it would no doubt be a very fine thing,
both for Christian and all his hangers-on. Gabor was pleased that
he had been allowed to remain behind at Dürsheim, while Banning
and Pons had returned with the Uhlans to Ottenheim. He saw in
this a chance to ingratiate himself as the main favourite of his
master. He wondered whether it would be wise to reveal to him
that he had been at the bottom of the intrigue whereby Hensdorff
had been induced to offer him the hand of the Princess Eleanora;
one never knew...</p>

<p>He had spied on the girl standing on the balcony below, and
had heard her poignant exclamation as Leopold rode away. He had
seen her stretch out her hands, with her muslin gown fluttering
in the breeze and the sunshine, billowing against the curved gilt
rails of the balustrade.</p>

<p>He was very much amused to think that possibly she had
conceived a romantic fancy for the blond young man with his
mournful, romantic air. That really did add a peculiarly piquant
spice to the whole affair; not only he was diverted, but he hoped
to make his own considerable count in that; he knew he was
clever, and he believed he was fascinating to women. Although
there were several illegitimate alliances in his pedigree, he
was, he reflected with a sneer, at least as well born as
Christian, for all his magnificent and unsurpassed airs of
majesty. He relished the thought that, in a way, the arranging of
this match had put Christian in his power; he had a hold on him,
both because he had helped in bringing the marriage about, and
because he knew of this extraordinary infatuation for Eleanora;
this schoolgirl already languishing for another man!</p>

<p>He leaned down and peered at her as she stood below;
disconsolate: yes, he was sure that was the word to express her
attitude; she was disconsolate&mdash;gazing across the empty
courtyard, wondering why Leopold had run away&mdash;scared away,
mocked Gabor in his narrow heart, poor miserable coward!</p>

<p>The disputed maiden was certainly of a plump and seductive
type, with voluptuous arms and shoulders like a piece of
Nymphenburg porcelain, and in delicate contrast an engaging air
of girlish innocence. To those whose taste really leant in that
direction she was no doubt delicious, but Gabor could not see any
quality in her which justified the undoubted passion which Prince
Christian entertained for her; a passion that made Gabor think
the less of his master, whom he had reluctantly admired for being
quite impervious to any human weakness. Prince Christian might,
he had believed, have done anything for power, for towns, for
territory, for money, for crowns; but he would not have believed
he would have done anything for a girl&mdash;especially for a
girl like this one standing below him in the bright sunshine of
the summer morning: just an ordinary, young and foolish girl, who
would probably be too plump quite soon.</p>

<p>Gabor preferred the dark, flashing, sophisticated charmers
with whom Christian had been wont to amuse his brief
leisure&mdash;even the savage Russian who had an empire as her
dowry.</p>

<p>The Château at Dürsheim was very silent. Hensdorff, Christian
and Anhalt-Dessau were closeted together. There was considerable
agitation and confusion on the part of two of them, at least,
Gabor knew; Hensdorff would have to play with a high, firm hand,
and must be wondering if, even so, he could bring the business
off; Anhalt-Dessau would be irritated, rather desperate, his back
against the wall, wondering what it all meant. General Crack
would be sitting there as usual, with his sleek and dandified
air, rather like&mdash;and Gabor pictured the same image as
Leopold had pictured&mdash;a glossy, neat beast of prey, waiting
for his victim: quite sure of his victim, too. It would not be
very easy for Hensdorff, for all his experience and astuteness,
to persuade Anhalt-Dessau immediately into this change of
bridegrooms: not easy to make him relinquish the Emperor and
accept the mercenary; he would have to be frightened, overawed,
no doubt. That would be rather a difficult matter, even for
Hensdorff.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor wished he could have been present at the
scene, which would be, no doubt, most interesting and
instructive, and certainly lively; but since this was impossible,
he began to prowl lightly round the Château, hesitating behind
doors, peeping through windows, peering down corridors. He had no
difficulty in discovering the room where Christian, Anhalt-Dessau
and Hensdorff were closeted, for there was a page outside who
warned him away, saying that his master was engaged on the most
important and pressing business, and could by no means be
disturbed.</p>

<p>Gabor turned off with a leer, but not before he had heard
voices coming from behind that closed door: the voice of
Hensdorff, raucous, menacing; the voice of Anhalt-Dessau, scared,
worried and resentful. General Crack's silence was, of course,
ominous: he was silent because he was quite sure of himself.</p>

<p>Gabor wandered away and asked a valet, "Where is the Duchess?"
She also, it seemed, had retired, discomfited and in disarray;
retreating to her chamber as to a citadel. The whole household
seemed in disorder and confusion; the sudden departure of Leopold
had startled every one; there was a sense of great affairs being
about to happen&mdash;great affairs of not a very pleasant
order.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor, mischievous, restless, idle, lingered a while
in the house, then went out into the Court of Honour, then into
the villa garden. And there he was surprised and delighted to see
the coveted Eleanora, walking uncertainly under the shade of the
high, clipped hornbeam hedges. He followed her, but at a careful
distance; he did not wish to frighten her, and he thought, with a
sneer, that she was very likely most easily frightened, silly
little puss! It was an odd and pleasing chance that had left her
alone&mdash;the confusion of the household, no doubt, was
responsible for her escape, without even the inevitable company
of the good Baroness Charlotte.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor thought this was an opportunity of which he
must not fail to take advantage; it would be both amusing,
agreeable and useful for him to make friends with the future wife
of his master. It would be quite easy to impress, and even to
lead, a little thing like that; and if he could influence the
woman who influenced Christian, why, there would be no limit to
his power! With Christian ruling the Empire, and he ruling
Christian through his wife&mdash;a very glittering vision flashed
through the tawdry brain of Gabor.</p>

<p>And why not? He believed that he was just as engaging as his
master, and more adroit with women; surely, too, he had more
experience, for he knew from his own observation that Christian
had never continued any connection with any woman long enough to
know much about them. He had been too indifferent in his love
affairs, thought Gabor, to be able to manage one of the most
difficult type&mdash;a little silly, ignorant, scared girl with
her head full of romantic follies.</p>

<p>Eleanora turned hesitatingly across the garden towards the
beech woods. She had an air of escaping from all of them. Once or
twice she glanced behind, but Gabor was swift enough to step
behind the hornbeam hedges and the elaborate statues that edged
the avenue from the Château to the forest; this sort of pursuit
was his <i>metier</i>.</p>

<p>The girl exactly retraced her steps of yesterday and came out
into the beech shade where Leopold had met her, and sat down
under the same tree where that young man had first seen her with
her wild strawberries.</p>

<p>The light was different now. It had less of magic; the morning
sun had not penetrated the fastnesses of the foliage as the
evening light had penetrated them yesterday. All was shadowed
although fragrant with the rich and luscious fragrance of
August.</p>

<p>Gabor, lightly tripping into this shade, spied Eleanora from a
distance, though she did not perceive him, for she seemed deep in
a pensive mood, leaning against the silver trunk of the robust
tree and looking down at the ground. He tiptoed elegantly through
the wood, prepared his most gracious smile and manner, bowing low
and doffing his cockaded tricorne, and addressed her with
courteous freedom and airy graceful assurance.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Madame," he greeted her; "good morning,
Princess. I am your father's guest."</p>

<p>She stared up, bewildered and flushed, not knowing at all what
to make of him; not liking him. She drew further away from him
behind the tree, so that she just looked at him round the shining
trunk, like a frightened faun, curious, but ready to fly.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor was attractive and of good address. He carried
himself with an air of one used to courts and wore the Uhlan
uniform trimly&mdash;an aristocrat clearly labelled, yet sinister
in his mocking affectations.</p>

<p>"I saw you last night, I think," returned Eleanora. "I do not
know who <i>is</i> my father's guest, or who all these people are
staying at Dürsheim."</p>

<p>"I think," smiled Gabor, "that you will know; in fact there
are a great many things just about to be revealed, Princess. A
great many very interesting things. Perhaps you would care to
take my arm, and we could walk a little through the woods and I
could discover to you what these matters will be."</p>

<p>"I must return to the Château," said Eleanora, who had never
been so boldly addressed by a man. "I really have no right to be
here. I just wandered a little way to be alone. My father is shut
up with Prince Christian and Count Hensdorff. I do not know what
they do, what they talk about; but I think it is something very
important, and they all seem very agitated. My father said he
wanted to speak to me presently. I, too, feel agitated, and so I
have come out here to be away from it all, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>All this was pantingly delivered in childlike awkwardness.
"Because you have recently been in this spot before?" asked
Gabor, quickly. "Because you remember something very agreeable
that happened here, under, perhaps, this very tree?"</p>

<p>This was only a shot in the dark, but she winced and hung her
head, humiliated, and feeling she had been spied upon. Her fright
gave him an immense advantage.</p>

<p>"Where is the Duchess?" he smiled. "Is she, too, one with the
confusion that seems to reign at Dürsheim?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," protested Eleanora, piteously on her guard, "I
don't know; you really mustn't ask me. Please go away."</p>

<p>"But I," persisted Gabor, with his most insinuating air,
"could tell you so much that you would be very glad to know. It
seems to me you've been left in complete ignorance about a great
number of things which intimately concern yourself, have you not,
Princess?"</p>

<p>"That may be so," replied the girl with some spirit; "but
surely it is for my father to enlighten me, and not for you,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>"That young man," smiled Gabor, unmoved, "who left so suddenly
just now: do you by any chance know who he is?"</p>

<p>"He is Captain Leopold," said Eleanora, with a flush. "He's
gone away; he seems in trouble. I think," she added, timidly,
"that he will come back."</p>

<p>"Well," said her tormentor, "I daresay you'll see him again,
if that's what you mean; but as for his coming back to Dürsheim,
I rather doubt it, I must confess." He came a step nearer, and
asked slily: "Do you wish to see Captain Leopold again,
Princess?"</p>

<p>At this the distracted maiden fell into a deeper reserve and
bewilderment, and drew back with palpable alarm.</p>

<p>"I am going now," she pleaded. "I am returning to the Château;
please don't importune me any more. I must not discuss these
things, they are not for me. I must leave them to my father.
Captain Leopold is a young soldier, I suppose. There is no more
to be said."</p>

<p>"There is a great deal more to be said," returned Gabor.
"Shall I&mdash;would you like me to tell you? Why not? We are all
alone in the woods. There is no one spying here. You haven't got
your grandmother to correct you, or your father to chide you.
Come, Princess, you must grow up, you know You can't live in a
fairy tale."</p>

<p>This cynical remark sounded hateful to Eleanora, who had heard
so often the same sort of rebuke from her father. She had always
resented it from him, and resented it still more from this
stranger, whose aspect she detested and whose words she
distrusted, who stood there so inflexible and covertly
insolent.</p>

<p>"I don't want to live in a fairy tale," she answered, with
what pride she could muster. "I am perfectly happy in my own
life."</p>

<p>She shivered, thinking that he seemed to impersonate something
horrible, stalking after her in the lonely woods&mdash;woods that
had been so enchanting and so delicious yesterday, and now seemed
submerged in hideous shadow, in some way changed and hateful,
very different from their ancient gloom and splendour.</p>

<p>But Gabor persisted in his unwelcome attentions. He was a very
self-confident man. He had always dealt with women who
appreciated his cynical, chill addresses. He did not believe that
he would be long in impressing this simple young girl; he wanted
to gain her confidence, to make her believe he was her friend; he
knew that she would be very dismayed and alone in her new life,
and in that dismay, and perhaps terror, he would like her to turn
to him, to consider him as a help and as a support. That would be
most agreeable and most convenient to Prince Gabor.</p>

<p>He did not, therefore, feel inclined to relinquish this
opportunity of occupying her mind and impressing his image on her
memory and assuring her of his good offices and his friendship;
he knew that he was going rather far in his advances, but he
could not resist her foolishness, her inexperience; she was too
easy a prey to be relinquished lightly, and more lovely than he
had thought. He began to endorse Prince Christian's taste.</p>

<p>"Your father," he smiled, with what he meant to be a charming
smile, "is arranging your marriage, now, this very minute;
presently he will call you, send for you into his cabinet to tell
you so. I think you should be obliged to me, Princess. I warn you
of this in advance, so that you may put a good face on the
matter. At least your cue is a decent resignation."</p>

<p>He tried to give this a jesting sound, and yet his ashy eyes
looked at her as if he did not mean her to take it as a jest.</p>

<p>"My marriage?" said the girl, faintly, nervously clasping her
hands. "Oh, yes, perhaps. I suppose so! I don't know why
<i>you</i> should tell me of it&mdash;my father will do so. My
marriage to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your marriage to General Crack," said Gabor, briefly, with an
insulting intonation on the name.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried Eleanora. "Oh, no! I think you are wrong!"</p>

<p>He relished her deep distress.</p>

<p>"Will you please let me pass now? I want to go back to the
Château," she implored.</p>

<p>"Not," said Gabor, "in this disarray and confusion! Compose
yourself, my dear Princess! Behave like a lady of sense, and
listen to what I have to say. It certainly <i>is</i> your
marriage with General Crack that your father is at this moment
arranging&mdash;and a very fine marriage, too, I've no doubt
people would say. He is, I suppose," added the Transylvanian,
with a sneer, "the greatest man of his time. He will, very
likely, be greater still. Nay, he may even stand on the steps of
the Imperial throne! Who knows? He may even sit on the Imperial
throne itself! They say he can hold the Empire together or pull
it asunder as he wishes."</p>

<p>Eleanora did not know what all this meant. She looked
bewildered, almost like a child about to cry; and plucked at her
muslins vaguely.</p>

<p>"Come!" urged Gabor, with an air of encouragement, "prepare
yourself for the splendid part you are about to play. Think what
the future holds for you as this great man's wife! Have I not
told you what you may expect&mdash;perhaps the Imperial Diadem
itself!"</p>

<p>She heard the obvious crude sneer in these words and was
affronted, hurt and frightened. She could not understand what
this swarthy, evil-looking man with the ash-coloured eyes meant.
She began to hurry away through the trees, but he followed her,
lightly and adroitly, picking a path over last year's leaves and
through the brambles.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to marry Prince Christian?" he urged. "Don't
you think he is a very pleasant gentleman&mdash;a very notable
and famous general&mdash;a wonderful husband for any girl who is
fortunate enough to captivate him?"</p>

<p>The poor child paused to listen, fascinated and repelled.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps," continued Gabor, enjoying his advantage, "you
think him hateful, implacable, hard, cruel...well, perhaps that
is true. Perhaps even you have heard certain tales&mdash;but I
suppose not, no&mdash;not yet. But I am afraid, my dear Princess,
whether you like it or no you will have to make the best of it,
for at any moment you will be summoned to the house and be
introduced to him as your husband. Come, I am his intimate friend
and confidant, and I should like to be <i>your</i> friend, too.
Won't you rely on me? Perhaps I may be able to help you if you
are in any difficulty or trouble."</p>

<p>He had brought his dark presence close to Eleanora, and stood
so, smiling, and mockingly barring her way.</p>

<p>"I know Prince Christian rather better than you ever will," he
added.</p>

<p>"Please," she replied, struggling for self-control in vain, "I
don't want to hear any of it. I don't need a friend, I'm sure.
There's the Duchess and my father&mdash;that's quite enough. I
have friends, too, at home in Anhalt-Dessau. Please!" And she
tried to avoid him; and did succeed in passing him and in
reaching again the shelter of the high hornbeam hedges.</p>

<p>Gabor allowed her to escape down those narrow paths, but he
followed her, knowing she was his prisoner here, and walked
beside her shut in by that high wall of clipped leaves, talking,
insinuating, trying to ingratiate himself with her, half servile,
half impertinent, encouraged more and more in his persistency by
her obvious distaste, terror and disgust. He was resolved that,
if he could not ingratiate himself with the girl, at least he
would terrorize her; Christian's future wife was too obvious and
tempting a victim, too easy a morsel, for one like Gabor to leave
unattempted. Surely he, with all his adroitness in all manner of
complicated intrigues, was not going to be bested by this stupid
young girl?</p>

<p>But all his arts only served to increase the bewildered terror
of Eleanora. She hurried, trying to get out of the hornbeam walk,
out of the shadow, out of the company of this man. She almost
ran, but he was still beside her, talking rapidly, using all his
powers of persuasion and argument to make her believe in him, to
trust in him, to favour him. What pleasure there was in this
gross pursuit of his master's treasure!</p>

<p>In her misdirected flight she had involved herself in a
quidnunc, where the tall sharp cut blocks of hornbeam shut her
out from the Château and forced her to retrace her frightened
steps and brought her face to face with her odious pursuer near a
stucco fountain crested with stone lilies and circled by a sedate
parterre starred with living lilies; here she pantingly
hesitated, not knowing which way to fly, and looking seductive
enough to the cold eyes that surveyed her&mdash;more than ever a
Nymphenburg shepherdess, dishevelled with her flight from a swain
too importunate!</p>

<p>Gabor took her wrist, and then her waist&mdash;both so small
and tempting, and asked her, enjoying her mute horror, why she
was so frightened?</p>

<p>Then he stooped, plucked a cluster of the lily buds and tried
to place this nosegay in her bosom.</p>

<p>"Do not go unadorned to your lord!" he smiled, and endeavoured
to fasten the innocent flowers into the heaving ruffles on that
innocent breast.</p>

<p>She twisted away with more dexterity than he would have
credited her with, and the flowers fell beneath them onto the lip
of the basin. Gabor was about to snatch at her again, for he had
given full rein to his malice, when his flickering glance saw
Christian coming through the narrow opening in the hornbeam
hedge. Gabor, adept at control, bowed to Eleanora in the most
formal manner and begged to take leave of her since His Highness
had so opportunely arrived. He did not have time to finish this
sentence, for Christian, glancing from him to the girl cowering
with her fingers to her lips, demanded, "Your business in the
company of the Princess?"</p>

<p>These words, spoken with the utmost insolence, were more than
Gabor's discretion could withstand; he permitted himself a
swagger as he replied that he was escorting the lady for a stroll
in the woods.</p>

<p>Christian glanced from him to the knot of flowers dripping
beneath the jet of water and then to the distressed girl who had
no wit or judgment with which to deal with this, to her, most
terrifying situation.</p>

<p>"What are these flowers?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Eleanora put her fingers before her face.</p>

<p>"Monsieur was trying to give them to me," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Pick them up!" Christian commanded Gabor. The Transylvanian
hesitated, for Christian spoke as if he were ordering a cur to a
kennel, but his habit of obedience was too strong; he stooped
easily, and negligently handed the lilies to the other man,
remarking slily:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Highness, I had not understood that my poor
gallantries were unwelcome."</p>

<p>One step brought Christian close to him, one second sufficed
for him to dash the wet lily bells into his face; even as Gabor
shrank back he noted with gratified malice how Christian had at
length lost the languid indifference, the serene calm he had so
painfully learnt in France; in gesture, in inflexion he was all
Italian as he struck his hand across that grinning mouth and
cried:</p>

<p>"Begone! Immediately! If I see you again I will have you
thrashed!"</p>

<p>Then he recovered his composure instantly and turned his back,
with unutterable contempt, on Gabor. The Transylvanian had
staggered into the hornbeam hedge; the heavy faceted bezel of
Christian's ring had cut his lip and blood mingled with water
trickled down to his spruce uniform; he pulled out his
handkerchief and pressed it to his twisted mouth; his soul
quivered one agony of hate, but he dared risk no second insult;
he slipped swiftly away through the tall hedges of the
quidnunc.</p>

<p>Christian gazed sternly at Eleanora; he was most bitterly
amazed and annoyed by this scene, most of all by his own flaunt
of rage.</p>

<p>"Why were you alone?" he frowned.</p>

<p>Eleanora was prepared for reproach; she knew that an indecorum
on her part had led to all this unpleasantness; it had been wrong
for her to slip away like that&mdash;if her father was to
know!</p>

<p>She wrung her hands in silence and with terrified eyes pleaded
for pity.</p>

<p>"Gabor, of all men!" mused Christian in deep rage; it was
incredible. "Did he follow you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," whispered Eleanora, looking ready to sink on
her knees before this stern scrutiny. "I met him in the woods,
Monseigneur&mdash;only a little way in the
woods&mdash;if&mdash;if you would not tell my father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is no longer your father's business, but mine," he replied
curtly, and set his heel on the lilies Gabor had profaned. "Come,
I have been asked to bring you to the Château&mdash;I have looked
for you&mdash;some while&mdash;in vain."</p>

<p>Eleanora wished to say something to placate him, but knew of
nothing; she thought him even more foreboding punishment and
anger than her father; how horrible his dark face had been in
that flash of time when he had struck the other man&mdash;a
grinning mask of fury!</p>

<p>"This is the first time that we have been alone together," he
remarked moodily and with an accent of deep disappointment that
she could not understand. "An ill occasion! Mademoiselle," he
added sharply, "will you come to the house?"</p>

<p>She walked beside him dutifully between those fragrant high
hedges and he took no heed of her, absorbed in the thought of
Gabor; the man must be cashiered; the competent scoundrel had
been useful, no doubt, extremely useful, and might be difficult
to replace; but he had now offended beyond forgiveness; General
Crack never retained in his service those who had once offended;
and no one had offended as this blackguard had offended.</p>

<p>As Christian and Eleanora went into the Château, Gabor, still
wiping his bleeding lip, was staring at them from behind the
statue of Silenus, against the florid plinth of which he leant
his trembling body.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor had done with Christian, as completely as
Christian had done with him. A long-contained, an envious and
jealous hatred had now broken into complete and utter loathing
and detestation; as he watched the elegant and rigid figure of
General Crack, escorting the reluctant girl into the Château, a
complete plan of vengeance flashed into his inflamed mind: a
scheme of delicate, atrocious vengeance, not too difficult to
accomplish; even in his pain and writhing humiliation this
thought thrilled him with exquisite jubilation; the passions of
these people set them at his mercy. It had long been worth while
for him to take a great deal from General Crack for material
reasons; it was not now worth while to take this&mdash;those
words, that blow in front of that silly woman.</p>

<p>Always rapid and direct in action, he left the Château and
rode after Leopold towards Vienna; through all that journey the
unstaunchable bleeding of his lip kept fresh his determined
hate.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">CHRISTIAN was not aware of the girl's
repugnance, of her straining away from him as they walked down
the long, cool white corridors of the Château; indeed, he was
scarcely conscious of her presence at all. He still was too
absorbed by his utter astonishment at the incredible behaviour of
Gabor. It seemed to him exactly as if one of his favourite and
most cringing spaniels had suddenly flown at his hand and bitten
him. For years the Transylvanian had been in his service and had
always shown the most servile submission; Christian was deeply
infuriated by this sudden presumptuous insolence. That he should
have dared in any way to disturb the girl; that he should have
ventured to follow Eleanora into the gardens, forced on her his
addresses, frightened her, intimidated her, offered her
flowers&mdash;Christian could scarcely believe this although it
had been the evidence of his own eyes and ears. His strong
fingers tingled to clench again as if he was a second time about
to raise his hand to strike that cringing blackguard.</p>

<p>Gabor had been extremely capable and clever, and might be
extremely dangerous. Christian thought of neither of these
things; he resolved that the Transylvanian must be instantly, and
with the greatest indignity, dismissed his service.</p>

<p>He was therefore so occupied in controlling the anger which
these amazing reflections gave him that he did not observe that
Eleanora was shrinking from him against the wall, that she was
regarding him with very little less dread than the dread with
which she had regarded the man from whom he had rescued her, the
insolent jackal, Gabor. It was, however, with a different manner
of dread that Eleanora glanced up at Prince Christian. She was
not, she could not be, impervious to the brilliant attraction of
his self-assurance and his self-confidence, of his dramatic good
looks, his superb carriage and dandified splendour.</p>

<p>When they reached the door of the room where Hensdorff and
Anhalt-Dessau were closeted he turned and spoke to her, suddenly
realizing her part in this.</p>

<p>"I was impetuous," he remarked, frowning in some distress, "I
should not have struck that rascal&mdash;it was not the moment.
Perhaps I frightened you. You must put it all out of your mind
now. You will never see him again. He shall not trouble you any
more."</p>

<p>And she noted and was soothed by the extreme softness of his
voice. She did not want to enter the room, she did not want to
face the two men whom she knew were there, neither Hensdorff nor
her father; she drew away and made as if to run down the
corridor, but Christian took and retained her hand gently, at the
same time with a certain insistent strength.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you must not run away, you must come with me
to your father, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>She would not look at him and did not want to listen to him,
but he forced her, though very graciously and courteously,
through the tall door which he had opened, and she found herself
in the small private closet of the Duchess, now occupied by
Anhalt-Dessau and Hensdorff. She sensed at once a gloomy and
sombre atmosphere, full of agitation and fear. Hensdorff looked
grim and sarcastic, biting his lower lip and stroking his long,
eloquent and pendulous nose. Anhalt-Dessau appeared flustered,
frightened, agitated; he was indeed cornered, and hardly knew
what to say or do; he very much resented this exchange of
bridegrooms and on every count would have preferred Leopold. But
Leopold had fled, Leopold had left him in the lurch, at the mercy
of these two men. He was scared, and Hensdorff meant he should be
scared, by those fatal despatches from Vienna, the account of the
break-up of the conference at Brussels, the march of the Allies
across the frontier. Across <i>his</i> frontier by now, for all
he knew; Hensdorff had said as much. Anhalt-Dessau would be one
of the first places to be fallen on. And to whom could he look to
defend his territory? Only to General Crack. How could he secure
the services of General Crack? Only by giving him his daughter!
Otherwise, that mighty soldier would join, not the forces of
Leopold, but those of the Allies. Anhalt-Dessau was severely
frightened.</p>

<p>Hensdorff had spoken rapidly and argued swiftly, with a
certain dry bitterness and fury. He had also promised great
rewards&mdash;the Golden Fleece, a Countship of the Holy Roman
Empire, the favour of Leopold, the friendship and protection of
Christian&mdash;"all," he had remarked with irony, "a fair price
for your little daughter, Prince Anhalt-Dessau."</p>

<p>And Christian had sat there all the while throughout the
degrading interview, serene, implacable; saying a word now and
then in his soft voice, but mostly staring out of the window at
the beautiful view of the beautiful river. Christian liked the
river; he liked the river, that silent power which seemed to have
so much of his own nature, better than he liked most men. And at
last Anhalt-Dessau had given in: Christian should have his
daughter. He had indeed little choice. There was, as he reminded
himself bitterly, no other suitor in the field. Leopold had gone.
He thought with loathing of Leopold, a weakling and a coward, and
he suggested sarcastically to Hensdorff that Christian might have
a heavy task in making this weakling puppet really Emperor; a
flimsy Caesar there, he sneered. And Hensdorff had replied drily
that it did not matter how flimsy the Caesar if he had General
Crack in his service.</p>

<p>When he looked up with agitated glance to see his daughter
entering the room with Prince Christian, the personal aspect of
the matter occurred to Anhalt-Dessau for the first time. He
wondered stupidly why this successful man was prepared to pay
such a stupendous price for Eleanora. It seemed a very
extraordinary thing to him that this little girl, as Hensdorff
had called her, was worth so much in the eyes of a man like
General Crack, and he looked, in the midst of all his dismay,
bewilderment and excitement, curiously at his own child, as if
trying to discover in her some charm or attraction which hitherto
he had neglected or ignored. But he could see nothing but a
blonde, pale, dismayed-looking maiden in a simple muslin dress
with a simple straw hat, who seemed as if she wished to run away
or cry; and this was indeed exactly what Eleanora did wish.</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau made an effort to preserve his dignity and
importance before the daughter whom he had so continually
bullied. He rose and sternly motioned her to one of the brocade
chairs against the wall, and she sat stiffly, alarmed, her eyes
downcast, her hands trembling in her lap. Prince Christian
remained standing beside her, and smiled from one to the other of
the agitated men. He smiled at the girl. Behind that mask of
indifference which he had for so long carefully cultivated, and
which he could now so successfully preserve, he was still
thinking of the incredible insolence of that hound Gabor, and
wondering in what most effective way he could punish the audacity
of the Transylvanian.</p>

<p>"Eleanora," said Anhalt-Dessau with an effort, "I have been
discussing your marriage with these gentlemen, Count Hensdorff
and Prince Christian, both of whom are, I think, known to
you."</p>

<p>He was making words to cover his own agitation. He went on
talking in a rambling sort of way, a preamble to the marriage
project, simply because he really did not know what to say. He
knew, of course, what he had to say, but could not tell quite in
what sentences to clothe the matter of his decision. At length
Hensdorff broke in impatiently. Those despatches were in his
pocket; there was really no time to waste. He said, brusquely,
turning his jaded eyes upon the girl:</p>

<p>"Princess Eleanora, your father is telling you that we have
just made a matrimonial contract between you and Prince
Christian. I hope this will be pleasing to you as it is to His
Highness. It is in every way a favourable contract to
yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what we have decided," added Anhalt-Dessau
hastily. "These are times of stress, Eleanora, and there has been
no space for long negotiations or delicate breakings to you of
these affairs. They are settled now."</p>

<p>He paused; it was as if he would have added: "And you must
make the best of them." Hensdorff caught up the clumsily broken
sentence.</p>

<p>"Prince Christian will tell you of the settlements if you wish
to know of them," he remarked, "but I expect, Princess, you are
used to leave those things to your father. He is satisfied, and
therefore we have taken it that you will be so."</p>

<p>Eleanora was further bewildered; she hardly understood the
import of what they said. Her eyes wandered idly to the clock.
How late it was&mdash;nearly midday! What a long time these men
had been talking in this close room! What a long time ago it was
since Leopold had ridden away! This morning, this very morning
early, in the first pure golden sunshine, he had ridden away; and
here she was now, sitting here, and they were talking of her
marriage to some one else, to this man standing close to her, at
whose magnificent presence she hardly dared to glance. More and
more she was frightened; she felt her throat dry and her hands
cold; tears stinging her eyes. She rose timidly to her feet and
made a curtsy to her father and whispered:</p>

<p>"Can I go away now, please? Can I go and find the Duchess?
I've rather a headache and I don't feel very well. I'd like to
talk to you about these things presently but not now."</p>

<p>"There is no talking to be done," said Hensdorff grimly. "We
are finished with the talking, Princess. It was merely to inform
you of the fact of your approaching marriage with Prince
Christian that we asked you to come here. I really do not think
there's anything more to be said."</p>

<p>But Prince Christian bent softly towards her and said in his
low voice, with almost simple tenderness:</p>

<p>"There is a great deal more to be said, Eleanora. You and I
will say it together presently. There is nothing about which you
need trouble now. If you wish to go to the Duchess you may do so.
I will myself escort you to her apartment."</p>

<p>But Anhalt-Dessau could not let the interview end like this.
He felt that he had cut a miserable figure in his daughter's eyes
and must somehow assert his authority and importance.</p>

<p>"I hope you understand, Eleanora," he said sternly. "You
mustn't be childish or foolish over this. I've had an idea lately
that your head's been filled by fairy tales and dreams and
childish things. I'm trying to make an end of all that now. We're
at war&mdash;yes, war's broken out again, more fiercely than
before, I'm afraid. Prince Christian will be in charge of the
Imperial troops. He is fighting for Leopold, our Emperor." He
could not forbear to sneer. "Yes, our Emperor Leopold. Your
husband will crown him, Eleanora, if he is ever crowned."</p>

<p>"But this," murmured Eleanora, "has nothing to do with me. I
don't understand."</p>

<p>She had always been kept well outside the affairs of men, and
war and politics were but two words to her ignorance. Prince
Anhalt-Dessau interrupted harshly:</p>

<p>"It's absurd to say you don't understand, child. It doesn't
matter whether you understand or not, as long as you understand
this: you are to marry Prince Christian."</p>

<p>How long since Captain Leopold had ridden away? Centuries
surely! She put her hand over her hot eyes and dropped another
curtsy.</p>

<p>"Very well, father; of course I shall do exactly as you wish.
And now might I go away? I really am tired and I really have a
headache."</p>

<p>"She has been frightened," remarked Christian, turning to
Anhalt-Dessau with sudden haughtiness. "Why don't you look after
her more closely? Where is her lady? She was alone in the garden
when I went to find her, and there some abominable wretch
frightened her. Monseigneur, you should have seen that this did
not happen."</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau stammered with rage and humiliation, excusing
himself incoherently, talking about the Baroness Charlotte and
the Duchess. He did not know how it was that his daughter was
alone in the garden. It had never, he said, happened before.
Hensdorff interrupted with harsh and growing impatience.</p>

<p>"All these things are trivialities, Anhalt-Dessau, and I beg
Your Highness to keep to the matter in point. Princess Eleanora
has been advised of her approaching marriage, and I think we have
no more business with the lady. Let us then get to other
affairs."</p>

<p>"Will you, then," said Christian in the gentlest tone of
command, "take your daughter to the Duchess, Anhalt-Dessau? And
will Your Highness then return here to this closet and finish the
discussion with me and Hensdorff?"</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau bowed, and took his daughter's hand with what
dignity he could muster. He had already in a few hours fallen
into the habit of obeying Prince Christian.</p>

<p>Eleanora gave yet another timid curtsy to Prince Christian and
Hensdorff and left the room, fluttering and half crying, on her
father's arm.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Hensdorff, as the door closed, "finished! I
hope Your Highness is satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," replied Christian. "I have got exactly what
I asked for on my own terms, haven't I? I hope that you, my dear
Count, are equally pleased with your share of our morning's work.
Your Emperor has not played the most noble of parts, nor behaved
in the most regal of manners; but no doubt he will mend by
experience, and learn to put a better front on his vanity and
youthfulness."</p>

<p>"It's all very well," protested Hensdorff grimly, "for Your
Highness to sneer, but when you quarrel with a man and drive him
with his back to the wall, he is not apt to behave very
finely."</p>

<p>"I did not know," smiled Christian, "that this marriage was a
great matter with His Imperial Majesty. You told me, or rather
you told Gabor, my creature, that Leopold would be delighted to
relinquish the Princess as the price of my services."</p>

<p>"No matter for that," said Hensdorff keenly. "Since Your
Highness is to set him on the Imperial throne it is best that you
should know something of his character. He's a flyaway; difficult
and tactless; very nice about his honour, as I believe Your
Highness is nice, and he did not care for this bargaining about a
woman, especially since he had seen the woman and found her only
a simple girl."</p>

<p>Christian frowned down that comment.</p>

<p>"All that is beside the mark," he replied. "That affair is
settled. But I would warn you to tell your Emperor to put a
better face on things. It is ill, methinks, fighting for a
whining boy. It is more ill to dream of putting the Imperial
Diadem on the head of a weakling. I have sworn to fight for your
man, and I shall fight for him to the best of my ability, but it
would give a better flourish to the whole affair if you should
tell him to cut a finer figure."</p>

<p>Hensdorff bowed; his heavy face was ironic; his voice
mocking.</p>

<p>"Doubtless it is now for Your Highness to give commands and
for the Emperor to obey. I shall not fail to remind His Imperial
Majesty to make his deportment worthy of one who commands General
Crack."</p>

<p>Christian remained indifferent to the sneer.</p>

<p>"Where has he gone now?"</p>

<p>"Vienna, I presume," said Hensdorff. "Where else should he
go?"</p>

<p>"It would have become him better if he had gone towards the
frontier. There are many garrison towns there that would be
enlivened by his presence," said Christian. "Also, am I to have
no orders from him? Is it all left to me?" he added with a smile.
"This is a strange master to serve, who flies without giving one
single word."</p>

<p>"You," asserted Hensdorff, "would not have taken his commands
had he given any."</p>

<p>"No," admitted Christian, "I should not have taken his
commands, but it would have given a better colour to the whole
affair had he issued them."</p>

<p>With lean, knotted hands Hensdorff gathered up his papers and
tied them round with tape; he was weary with vehement
talking.</p>

<p>"When does Your Highness mean to take command of the
army?"</p>

<p>"The army?" said Christian mockingly. "Have you got one? I
thought I had to provide the army before I could take command of
it. I must consult Maréchal De Lisle in Prague. I am not too well
informed in your affairs, Count Hensdorff. For the last few
months Imperial matters have been in a state of flux and reflux.
It seems to me that I must make, out of confusion and chaos, some
sort of order and strength. Your Leopold will do nothing. The
first thing is to clinch our bargain."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Hensdorff. "Does Your Highness wish to be
married at once?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Christian. "I do not mistrust either you or
Anhalt-Dessau, but the times are full of chances and accidents.
Before I leave to take command of Leopold's army I should like to
know that Princess Eleanora is my wife and under my protection.
That demand, I think, is just."</p>

<p>"Just or no," replied Hensdorff, "it is not for me to decide.
You must ask Anhalt-Dessau. I see no objection to your marriage
taking place to-night, and your escorting the Princess to your
Château immediately. You have adequate means at Ottenheim for her
protection, far more adequate than they have here; and, for
myself, I can have no objection."</p>

<p>All this seemed oddly trivial to Hensdorff; the affairs of
empire appeared petty when they had been the occasion of so much
shrewish dispute; yet he admired, and more and more, the man with
whom he now spoke.</p>

<p>He was silent for a second, looking on the ground; he had made
an excellent bargain, he should have been elated. Then he said
curiously:</p>

<p>"And the lady? I suppose Your Highness will have no difficulty
there?"</p>

<p>"Difficulty, Monseigneur?" said Christian with a blank look.
He then added, in a tone of supreme indifference:</p>

<p>"I had better tell you, Hensdorff, that Gabor has left my
service&mdash;my Uhlans and my employ. I believe you have been
conducting some negotiations with him, negotiations regarding
this affair. He was much in my confidence, but that is over now:
he has gone, where I don't know, and anything he may say to you
about me, or purporting to be from me, is without my authority.
Take no notice of it. He is a villain, an insolent villain."</p>

<p>"That I knew," said Hensdorff simply; "but I thought
nevertheless that he was well in the favour of Your
Highness."</p>

<p>"In my favour?" said Christian. "No. In my employ, yes. I have
used him frequently and found him adroit, subtle and clever. He
was my agent, as you knew, in Vienna, and employed there other
agents. But that, as I say, is over. The man has shown himself
presumptuous to an incredible degree, and he is gone. For me he
exists no more unless I seek him out to punish him. And I warn
you, Hensdorff, to take no heed of anything he says. He may find
other work with other men, but never more with me."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was startled and inquisitive. He ventured to
ask:</p>

<p>"And how has Gabor so suddenly offended Your Highness? You are
not, I think, fastidious or particular where your lesser servants
are concerned."</p>

<p>"I am fastidious in some things," replied Christian, "and in
one of those things has Gabor offended me. No more of the matter,
Hensdorff. I have spoken entirely for your guidance."</p>

<p>There was a pause; the two men seated either side the table
looked at each other easily. Hensdorff was exhausted, but he had
made a superb bargain&mdash;not by trickery, the famous mercenary
well understood the value of what he paid; the old minister
respected him for his lavish munificence; he no longer regarded
him as a tawdry adventurer but saw in him a man with a certain
grandeur of soul; Hensdorff could not recall having met this
quality before in any one.</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau, flustered and agitated, re-entered the room,
biting his forefinger and glancing furtively from one man to the
other; both of them his masters, he knew; one of them, Hensdorff,
his enemy, he was sure. He hated Hensdorff, who had played him up
and down, first offering the Emperor, then forcing Prince
Christian on him at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Hensdorff now proceeded to abruptly break the project of an
immediate marriage; explained in a few dry words that Christian's
presence was required immediately with the armies far away from
Dürsheim, and that before he left to take up his arduous command
he wished to know that the Princess Eleanora was his wife, and,
to use his own words (rather ironically), in his own protection;
Anhalt-Dessau was further scared and agitated at this but he
could find no good reason to argue for delay. After a little
reflection it seemed to him that here was a good chance to shift
all responsibility, to end the matter, to have done with it, to
have the girl safely in some one else's keeping. Here he was in
Dürsheim, a long way from his home, with no soldiers and only a
few servants, and it would not be too easy in the present state
of affairs to ensure the safety of a couple of women. He did not
dare argue against the marriage, but agreed that it should take
place that evening in the court chapel of the Château. He would,
he promised, at once go and tell the chaplain to make all
preparations and also bid his daughter prepare herself.</p>

<p>"She is to leave for Ottenheim to-night, I take it?" he added,
in some confusion and bewilderment. "It is all very abrupt to me,
Prince Christian, but I acknowledge that the times are difficult
and full of confusion."</p>

<p>He looked at the papers in Hensdorff's hands and drew some
consolation from them. The settlements had been princely; he had,
after all, done very well for his daughter. If it hadn't been for
that blot on Christian's birth&mdash;but, after all, other men
had the same blot and had even risen to wear the Imperial purple.
If Christian saved the Empire for Leopold of Bavaria, no one
would trouble very much about the fact that his mother had been
an Italian Columbine&mdash;no one except Christian himself,
perhaps, in his own heart; and who would care about his private
pangs? Before the world he would be able to carry it with a high
hand; he had enough audacity, enough insolence for any
pretension, the Devil knew. Perhaps, Anhalt-Dessau reflected,
Leopold would give him Pomerania and Kurland, and he would be
able to call himself a reigning Duke, and his daughter would be
able to call herself a reigning Duchess. Not quite so splendid
perhaps as being the Empress, but then, the weak man argued in
his mean soul, if Leopold had fallen she would not anyhow have
been Empress. It was a case of making the best of a rather
desperate situation.</p>

<p>"And I?" he asked. "What am I to do? Where am I to go?"</p>

<p>"You can come with me," said Christian. "I have a sufficiently
powerful escort. The Princess, I shall leave in my Château of
Ottenheim. And now, if you please, I must have some time to
myself. I have a great number of letters to write and a great
many matters to settle. I wish to send one of my Uhlans back to
my Château to fetch Banning and Pons. There is a good deal of
preparation to be made before my departure to-morrow, a departure
that must be as soon as possible. You will please go,
Anhalt-Dessau, and apprise your daughter of the ceremony
to-night."</p>

<p>His amiable smile and level look dismissed them both; he
retired into the inner closet which had been placed at his
disposal, where two secretaries waited his dictation.</p>

<p>Hensdorff made ready to return to Vienna, for his business was
now to get the ear of Leopold and make him behave in some manner
worthy of the enterprise he had undertaken; soothe and spur and
encourage him into making some sort of a kingly figure before the
assembled thousands who would soon shout for him and fight in his
cause. He felt utterly disgusted at Leopold's behaviour, and he
had no doubt that Leopold felt equally disgusted with him. These
things would have to be passed over. They were pledged now to a
certain mutual line of action and must make the best of it, if
Leopold did not feel like an Emperor, he must in some way be
induced to assume the appearance of an Emperor.</p>

<p>Hensdorff had appreciated General Crack's advice on that point
and agreed with his recommendation. Much as he still resented the
arrogance and disliked the presumption of Prince Christian, he
wished secretly that the two men could change places, that
Christian could be the Emperor and Leopold the hired soldier;
then, he remarked to himself, we should have somebody worth
fighting for...</p>

<p>Hensdorff reflected too on the case of the Archduchess Maria
Luisa. There might be some difficulty there. She had been
desperately affronted&mdash;more desperately affronted than
Leopold. Her hand had been offered and refused. It might not be
very easy to make her gracious to Prince Christian, and gracious
she certainly must be, or pretend to be, as long as he fought for
her brother; as long as her brother leant on him as the man who
must place the Imperial crown upon his head.</p>

<p>Hensdorff had plenty of leisure for these reflections, for
during the whole hot day he saw none of the other inmates of the
Château, neither Anhalt-Dessau nor Christian nor the women; but
in the evening, about seven o'clock, he was summoned to the
chapel to witness the hasty marriage of Prince Christian and
Princess Eleanora, and he went, not unwillingly; he thought that,
after all, the ceremony would be rather an amusing one; an ironic
comedy.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">THE Lutheran chapel at Château Schönbuchel was
simple in structure but rather gaudily adorned. Angels in bright
blue and crude red robes, waved gilt hair, and immense haloes
stood with fantastic musical instruments on the top of the gaudy
little gold organ. There were other little glittering angels
above the altar, and coloured glass in the arched windows.
Through this streamed a plenitude of evening sunshine when
Hensdorff entered the chapel to be present at the wedding of
General Crack.</p>

<p>Count Michael Hensdorff was tired and full of many affairs,
which were of the most extreme importance to himself and his
master; but he could not forbear being both interested in and
amused by the scene at which he was to assist.</p>

<p>Punctually to the appointed hour Prince Christian arrived with
Colonel Pons and Captain Banning in attendance. The Lutheran
pastor was already in his place. Hensdorff remarked, with mingled
vexation and admiration, that the bridegroom maintained that
superb calm which had been so long his pose. He was resplendent
in the extreme of exotic uniform, that of his own Uhlans,
handsome with tassel, scarf and sash, fringed gauntlet and
embroidered sword-belt. He wore several stars and orders,
including The Golden Fleece, the coveted White Eagle of Poland
and the White Eagle of Prussia. Despite the fact that he had been
working hard in his closet all day, he was exceedingly dandified
in his appearance, as usual freshly powdered, shaved and curled,
and might even have appeared, except for his inherent magnificent
virility, foppish, so careful had he been with every detail of
his gorgeous appearance.</p>

<p>The experienced eye of Hensdorff recognized in him a splendid
figure to be a leader of men, a magnificent personality to guide
and inspire armies, a proper prince to symbolize the hopes and
glories of a great nation. It was a pity, he reflected sourly,
that chance had not put him in the legitimate line of a throne.
The Neapolitan actress mother had certainly lent a certain
theatricality to his appearance. His very remarkable good looks,
Hensdorff reflected, were perhaps scarcely the good looks of a
grandee, but these were glossed over by a very finished air of
high breeding acquired at the Court of Versailles. Not often did
he betray the blot on his birth.</p>

<p>With no less eager curiosity, Hensdorff regarded the Princess
Eleanora, who entered on the arm of her father, followed by the
Duchess and the Baroness Charlotte. Women of the type of the
Princess and the Duchess were a closed book to Hensdorff, an
unmarried man; he knew little or nothing about them, their lives
or their hopes or their feelings, nay, scarcely that they had any
such emotions and were not mere pawns or counters in the
masculine game. He had never concerned himself much about them
either; they had never come his way, or in any manner bothered
him; but now, when he had nothing better to do and was actually
brought face to face with them, he regarded with a cold
inquisitiveness these three women now proceeding to the altar. He
wondered what Eleanora had been thinking about all day, what sort
of a tale had been told her, the silly child. The Duchess seemed
agitated, though she carried her old head very high and there was
a certain gallantry, as well as a certain resignation, in her
carriage. She was dressed and adorned with almost fantastic
splendour, covered with jewels, rosettes of diamonds, necklaces
of pearls, and dragged a long brocade train. The little bride,
too, was hung with jewellery, mostly old-fashioned, heavy and
unsuitable. Her hair had been powdered and strained back from her
pure brow. She wore a white dress and a silver train, hastily, no
doubt, put together by the Baroness Charlotte and the maids.</p>

<p>She did not look at her bridegroom, and Hensdorff noticed that
the hand on her father's arm was continually fluttering up and
down on his cuff. She seemed more terrified, if such a thing was
possible, than she had been that morning when she had been
brought before them in the cabinet. "A creature," thought
Hensdorff, "without spirit, or, I suspect, education; certainly
pretty enough, but I would swear that by this time next year he
has left her." All very well now, here in Dürsheim or in Prince
Christian's Château on the Danube, but if they came to Vienna or
Paris or any of the great cities when the troops are in winter
quarters, this little maiden would have a great deal of
difficulty in holding her own with the haughty beauties who
usually competed for the transient favours of General Crack.
Hensdorff could not imagine her even making the attempt; he saw
her fading away into the quiet obscurity which had absorbed so
many colourless wives of great men; well, never mind, she had
served her turn...</p>

<p>The Baroness Charlotte seemed to have been crying, and all the
women stood closely together, rather tense and on the defensive,
as if they hated and distrusted all the men. Even the cold heart
of Hensdorff was moved to a certain pity. A sacrifice, he thought
to himself, it really seemed like a sacrifice; and he wondered if
this delicate young creature would have been happier with an
idealistic type, weak but charming, like Leopold. But if it was a
sacrifice, the victim was unresisting. Princess Eleanora, still
with her blue glance carefully downwards, put her hand meekly
enough in that of her future husband.</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau was at once flustered and important. He had by
now reconciled himself to the marriage, and even began to see his
own part, and a very considerable part, in it. He was very much
impressed by Christian; by Christian's obvious power and obvious
cold self-assurance which seemed to prophesy the most brilliant
success in everything which he undertook. Anhalt-Dessau saw
himself being swept along to the most glittering of destinies in
the train of his gorgeous son-in-law. He already thought of the
Allies as whipped from the field, and himself as one of the
principal figures at the coronation of Leopold, when Christian
should have succeeded in placing the Imperial Diadem on the head
of the Electoral Prince. In short, he began to feel that he had
done very well for his daughter and that he had every reason to
congratulate himself on his worldly wisdom. In this manner he was
able to gloss over in his own mind his weakness in giving way to
Hensdorff, and the rapidity with which, at that statesman's
dictation, he had changed his plans for Eleanora. It was, too, no
inconsiderable thing, from his point of view, that his daughter
was marrying a Lutheran, and that he would be able to say that
this Lutheran had become one at his suggestion&mdash;nay, as he
might put it, at his command. He had not, after all, given
Eleanora to a Papist: he could make a great point of that. He
might even say to the other Lutheran princes that he had refused
the hand of the Emperor rather than allow his daughter to wed
outside the circle of the Reformed Faith.</p>

<p>The Duchess, on the other hand, had no consolation for the
loss of her favourite relative. She was very dubious indeed about
this marriage, very much dismayed and disarranged. Hensdorff,
looking at her, wondered what had passed between her and the
girl, for he knew that Eleanora had been closeted with the old
woman ever since the morning. She had managed to soothe her, at
least, managed to make her appear with some sort of dignity and
serenity. No doubt she had a considerable influence over the
child. But that she was uneasy herself there could be no doubt.
Her sunken eyes glanced constantly and furtively at Christian,
and with deep contempt at Anhalt-Dessau.</p>

<p>The ceremony proceeded. It was soon over&mdash;religious and
civil&mdash;over before the last light had faded from the bright
windows, while a faint glow of after-sunset colouring filled the
little square of the chapel. Eleanora had become Christian's
wife. Hensdorff licked his lips with satisfaction. The price had
been paid, and now the service for which it had been paid could
be exacted.</p>

<p>Eleanora turned from the altar and at once left the chapel
beside the Duchess, the Baroness Charlotte behind them.</p>

<p>Christian lingered, and with his own hands very handsomely
fee'd the pastor. There was no change whatever in his demeanour,
and yet to him the moment must be one of most supreme and
delicious triumph. Hensdorff respected a man who could be so far
master of all his emotions; he knew it more difficult to conceal
elation than despair.</p>

<p>Pons and Banning seemed lively and satisfied. They were
rejoicing, no doubt, at the prospect of another war, in which
they might gain both fame and plunder. Delightful as the life was
at Prince Christian's villa on the Danube, they soon wearied of
it; they were made for war, and rejoiced when it came their way
and the languid intervals of peace were over.</p>

<p>Hensdorff followed the magnificent bridegroom and spoke to him
in the corridor outside the chapel. After all, he had every right
to emphasize the bargain.</p>

<p>"I hope, Monseigneur," he remarked, "that you are now
completely satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Completely satisfied," repeated Christian, with a smile which
had no particular meaning.</p>

<p>"And I hope that you will make no delay fulfilling your
contract," added Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"I start to-morrow," said Christian, "for Prague. I have had
much to consider to-day. There is Italy and Flanders to take into
mind. I do not much rely on Olivenza. I think that many of your
biggest towns are very poorly fortified. I have a great deal to
do: you need not fear that I shall hesitate."</p>

<p>"Remember," smiled Hensdorff, almost as if he spoke in jest,
"that you have sworn to crown Leopold of Bavaria. And remember
that all the rest of Europe has sworn that he shall not be
crowned."</p>

<p>"I remember very well. I do not know why, my dear Count, you
trouble to remind me. Is it because you think I shall try to get
out of my bargain?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff thought, but dared not say: "Well, a mercenary
soldier fights for the highest bidder, his fortune is founded on
plunder, bribery and corruption. It's all very well to take a
high hand but I should like to bind him, hard and fast."</p>

<p>Aloud he said: "I suppose Your Highness will not object to
swearing allegiance to the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Christian lightly. "I will certainly
swear allegiance to him while I am in his service, though oaths
would make but little difference since I have already given my
word of honour."</p>

<p>Hensdorff bowed. The soldier was proud and perhaps might be
trusted on that count; though he had so often changed sides, he
had a fastidious personal honour and had not yet been known to
betray any one. But then, considered the minister, perhaps he had
not been ever tempted to betray any one. Now the Allies might
offer a very fine price indeed for his services, and he, having
secured his wife, might accept it&mdash;one never knew, these
decayed times. So he detained Christian in the white passage,
full of clear sunshine, debating how he might bind him to the
service of Leopold.</p>

<p>Christian waited patiently; he quite well read his thoughts
and felt compassionate towards the overworked, anxious man.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he remarked at length with an unusual simplicity
that was wholly charming, "you may trust me. I hope to do your
business for you in one campaign."</p>

<p>"I believe you will," responded the old man, suddenly feeling
reassured.</p>

<p>"But if not in one campaign, at least in two or three. All I
ask is a free hand, that for which I asked this
morning&mdash;undisputed command&mdash;no interference from your
good self, who are, Monseigneur, an able statesman but no
soldier, I take it, or from the Emperor, whom I know to be
totally inexperienced in warfare. It is as well, though," added
Christian, "that he should show himself at headquarters, and
sometimes with the army during its engagements, so that the men
may see that they do not fight for a puppet. Tell him," he added,
"as I reminded you this morning, to behave himself with every
dignity he can command. It is extraordinary how impressive a fine
air is to the troops&mdash;he must come at once to Prague."</p>

<p>Christian bowed with an amiable smile and so dismissed
Hensdorff, then passed again down the long white corridor. But
once more he was detained: the old Duchess stepped out from the
door of a small anteroom and asked him for a few moments'
speech.</p>

<p>"I wish for your company," she said nervously, "for just a
little while, Monseigneur. Perhaps you may have that amount of
patience with an old woman. Eleanora and Charlotte are making
ready their equipage, since, I understand, they accompany you
to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, Madame," answered Christian, courteously, "they
accompany me to-night. There is no manner of hurry; I am entirely
at your service."</p>

<p>He followed her into the little room, which was light and
bright, stocked with elegant Meissen china in all manner of
satin-lined cabinets. A circle of candles had already been lit,
and the bright rays of these blended with the last rays of the
setting sun, which penetrated the delicate closet.</p>

<p>The old woman and the young man, surrounded by all this pretty
porcelain, sat down formally opposite each other; the Duchess
allowed herself a little space in which to collect her wits,
while her slightly reddened, dim eyes stared at Christian.</p>

<p>She admired him sufficiently though his birth had greatly
prejudiced her against him; had she been young she would have
been flattered by his notice; she would have known how to manage
him&mdash;forty years ago.</p>

<p>She had heard many tales of him, some of which she believed
and all of which had been impressive. According to his
detractors, he had many glaring faults, but she could vouch for
it that he was extremely well-bred&mdash;he had the air of
Versailles.</p>

<p>To-day, now, he had shown an admirable patience and serenity
in a most difficult position that would have overwhelmed many
men; he had carried the whole thing off with an air wholly
splendid, the old woman thought, and with what courtesy and
reserve he sat, waiting for her pleasure&mdash;an old woman who
was of no use or interest to him; still that did not alter the
atrocity of this hurried marriage, the disgusting behaviour of
Anhalt-Dessau, the paltry cowardice of Leopold, the cynical
hardness of Hensdorff. The Duchess raged against all of them; she
knew what an effort it had cost her to bring the poor child in
some serenity to the altar&mdash;without any preparation, with
hardly a fit gown to her back!</p>

<p>She still stared at Christian in the yellow lustre of the
candles; she knew that he must possess intense passions and
violent emotions&mdash;and how notably he had controlled them
all; he had a finer air of Parisian insolence than any German
prince she knew, and all the while he presented this exalted
front to the world he was enduring the burning rancour of an
incurable wound.</p>

<p>Even now, while she gazed at him, she knew that he was aware
of her thoughts of him; how she was judging him, his birth ever
present in her mind; and he endured this, with immutable
patience; gorgeous, arrogant, glittering with the spoils of his
insolent career, all the sumptuous ornaments he had snatched from
a reluctant world.</p>

<p>The old woman knew something of his enterprise and pride, the
circumstance of his plunder and gain from the devastation and
waste of war, the many occasions of his increased grandeur
wrenched from ruin and blood; high indeed had he risen on piled
fragments of dismembered States, this man whose mother had
flaunted gutter-bred seductions on a tinsel stage.</p>

<p>The sum of her scrutiny was admiration for a difficult feat
accomplished with excellence. Her heavily veined hands trembled
on the cane where they rested; then she laughed; she was so old
that the world could not long seem to her anything but
comedy.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!" she grinned, nodding her head. He smiled also,
understanding her perfectly.</p>

<p>"Madame, my thanks for your congratulations," he said,
speaking French, which was native to him and became him well.</p>

<p>"You don't need them," she replied, relishing his appreciation
of her applause, speaking the same language, which gave her
agreeable memories of youthful visits to Paris. "Eh, Monseigneur,
you have done very well for yourself&mdash;very, very well, have
you not?"</p>

<p>"I have always endeavoured to make the most of advantages," he
smiled, with more than his usual vivacity. She knew that she had
not got within his guard, but that he was more at ease with her
than with the men, with the Germans at least; less haughtily and
insolently on the defensive; and this encouraged her in the
effort she had set herself. She nodded again, agreeing with his
statement; seeing him there in the rich play of light between the
newly lit candles and the expiring beams of the sun, she could
admit that he had indeed neglected nothing to set himself off
finely; he appeared in all his costly and tasteful fopperies, in
his overemphasized dark beauty, a very emblem of worldly grandeur
and power.</p>

<p>"So you, Monseigneur," she said, "are again in the flame of
battle, entering in broils of dubious issue, and yet you have
only enjoyed a brief respite from labour."</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Christian, "I am not one of those who can
live in confined comfort, solving all perplexities by housing in
warm seclusion, like carnations under glasses."</p>

<p>"You prefer the storms of fate in the open, eh?"</p>

<p>"I was bred to arms," smiled Christian. "But I hope to build
up as well as to destroy before my span is over. I do not fight
for the sake of brawling but to obtain a realm to administer,
Madame&mdash;I believe I could do that very well: to plant, to
build, to govern, to found a kingdom and renew a family, that
were not unambitious."</p>

<p>The old woman kindled to these soaring words.</p>

<p>"You'll do it, Monseigneur. You refer to Kurland?"</p>

<p>"Ay, to Kurland and the House of Ketlar."</p>

<p>"This Leopold must give it to you if you crown him&mdash;as I
have no doubt you will crown him. I wish I were a little younger,
to be there. Yet a pity it is a moody boy&mdash;he may frustrate
you, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Madame, one cannot expect a task without impediment or
obstacle&mdash;one must be grateful that it is no worse than
Leopold of Bavaria&mdash;if he cannot be commanded, he may be
ignored. And with Count Michael Hensdorff I have a stable
understanding."</p>

<p>"And now you are at an end of your patience with me," remarked
the Duchess, "but it is the last time that I shall detain you,
Monseigneur. I doubt if I shall survive the winter of your
endeavour to the spring of your triumph. Monseigneur, I am
seventy years old."</p>

<p>"Your years become you," smiled Christian with a certain
tender courtesy which she had not expected. "You are, Madame, an
encouragement to ladies who fear that, in losing their bloom,
they lose everything."</p>

<p>"Do not encourage <i>me</i> too much," she replied, "for,
after all, I brought you here to ask a favour of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It can scarcely be one that I should deny."</p>

<p>"Yet it is one I can scarcely ask."</p>

<p>He said at once: "You wish to speak of Eleanora?"</p>

<p>She was amazed by his swift intuition; yet she might have
guessed that he had read her from the first.</p>

<p>"I might have spared my poor diplomacy," she said rather
pitifully, "since I am an open book to you&mdash;yes, it is of
Eleanora. You have paid a high price for that simple young
woman."</p>

<p>"Madame, that has been done before."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, that is why I speak to you&mdash;passion will
pay&mdash;and reason afterwards neglect. Is Eleanora on the level
of merchandise&mdash;to be bought and used as you will?"</p>

<p>"Madame, I have married her."</p>

<p>"Perforce," the Duchess smiled wryly.</p>

<p>"Madame, I have your meaning&mdash;but men do not marry where
they despise."</p>

<p>"I have known it done&mdash;where pride was high enough and
desire hot enough&mdash;fling down the fee and snatch the
gratification! How will you consider Eleanora next year? She has
neither brains nor wit to match with yours, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>Christian did not reply; he was gazing past the Duchess at the
cabinet of silvered porcelain, where the last lingering rays of
the sun gave a lustre-like life to the figures of Nymphenburg and
Miessen&mdash;so many little Eleanoras, frolicking in
porcelain.</p>

<p>"I," added the Duchess, "love the child&mdash;she is all I
have had to love this many a year&mdash;so much a child to me it
is hard to think her married. She never knew her mother and her
father has regarded her harshly&mdash;if I do not speak to you,
no one will."</p>

<p>"Say what you will, Madame."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, I hope you love her."</p>

<p>"You do not think I have proved it?" he smiled.</p>

<p>"I said love, Monseigneur." As he did not immediately answer,
she added; "I hope you do love her."</p>

<p>Christian rose; at that moment the last sunbeams had faded
from the room and the candles alone dispersed the summer
dusk.</p>

<p>"I hope I do love her," he replied gravely.</p>

<p>"You spoke just now of Kurland&mdash;of your kingdom you
believed would emerge from these wars and of establishing there
again the name of Ketlar. Had you Eleanora in your
mind&mdash;throned beside you, Monseigneur? Is she to be your
partner in your future glories? I speak plainly."</p>

<p>"I will answer plainly. Eleanora is my choice to share the
highest fortune I may achieve."</p>

<p>The Duchess sighed with relief.</p>

<p>"Then I can have little more to say&mdash;if this,
Monseigneur, is your design&mdash;this and no vulgar passion or
impetuous whim, you can afford to wait."</p>

<p>"I have learnt how to wait," he replied, thinking of
Kurland.</p>

<p>"This," continued the Duchess, "has been a marriage most
strange and sudden for one of her quality&mdash;she is
unprepared, dismayed&mdash;and you, Monseigneur, are a stranger
to her, she cannot see you with my eyes. Monseigneur, remember
you have your wooing to do, it is not likely that you will fail
in it&mdash;but now you have no time&mdash;let it be
deferred."</p>

<p>"This is your request?" asked Christian directly.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, love forced is love slain&mdash;and she is a
child, kept most ignorant, knowing only women and pedants."</p>

<p>Christian was silent and the Duchess trembled lest he, so
acute and swift in his penetration, should see the bottom of all
this&mdash;Eleanora's romantic preoccupation with another man,
her childish fancy already involved in dreams in which Christian
did not figure. If he asked about this point she would have to
lie to him for her loyalty was to Eleanora and to the secret she
had so easily wrested from the agitated girl, and she did not
want to lie to him. Her fear was groundless, the question she
dreaded did not remotely come into Christian's mind. He
answered:</p>

<p>"I am pleased that you care enough for Eleanora to speak like
this&mdash;and I understand all that you have not said. It was my
intention to be her guardian before I was her lover&mdash;I can
afford to wait for the prize I hope to gain. When the campaign is
over, in the spring&mdash;for it is my intention to keep the
field all this winter&mdash;I shall return to Ottenheim." He
paused a second and then added in a slightly whimsical tone:
"Will you keep her for me, Madame? Will you forego Vienna and
remain at Ottenheim with her?"</p>

<p>The old woman's dull-coloured, heavy face was suffused with a
flush of pleasure; she rose and curtsied. "Monseigneur, I am very
honoured."</p>

<p>And in her grateful heart she vowed to make Eleanora forget
that fool's fancy for Leopold.</p>

<p>"I," said Christian, negligently, but as one not wishing to
shirk an obvious point, "have no family to whom to entrust
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Duchess stopped and countered this proud admission.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," she said, grandly, "never have I so much
regretted not having had a son as since I met you&mdash;for my
possible heir might have been like you. Though you are too young
for that post, think of me as an old woman of your family,
jealous of your honour."</p>

<p>Christian had never had such a compliment paid him by a woman
of her rank and haughtiness; nothing could have pleased him more;
he valued the approval of this withered lady more highly than the
shouts of troops or the flatteries of sycophants to which he was
too well accustomed. Seldom had he been so well understood; she
had completely won his confidence; he trusted his highly priced
treasure to her without a doubt or a regret.</p>

<p>That evening the Duchess sat beside Eleanora in the
<i>berline</i> that proceeded slowly under the unsullied fire of
the stars to Ottenheim. Prince Christian, out of compliment to
the occasion, accompanied them in the coach, but effaced his
presence as much as such a presence could be effaced by reading
over the notes his secretaries had written out for him, which he
had folded into a copy of Maréchal de Montecuculi's memoirs.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">IT was no affectation that made Prince Christian
absorbed in the sheaf of notes within the pages of Montecuculi as
the <i>berline</i> proceeded slowly under the starlight from
Schönbuchel in Dürsheim to Château Ottenheim; he had never been a
man to triumph over his achievements; the coveted Eleanora was
his, and he could afford to put her out of his mind. He was also
satisfied by the understanding he had come to with the Duchess
and by her presence in Ottenheim, fellow watchdog with Pons; so
at ease he read between the covers of the little red,
leather-covered book. He took no heed whatever either of the Duchess or
of Eleanora, but left them to the rather artificial, if hearty,
gallantries of the other occupant of the coach, Colonel Pons, to
whose conversation the old woman responded in a lively, if rather
nervous manner, while the hooded girl remained silent in her
corner, looking down at her white hands folded on her silken lap
above a paper of comfits.</p>

<p>Christian keenly regarded the facts and figures before him. He
was an able engineer and an expert mathematician besides being a
leader of men; that is to say, he knew his business thoroughly
from beginning to end; no pleasure, no intrigue had ever come
before his strenuous studies. He was decidedly pleased that he
could now begin to put again into exercise his ardent powers;
through his mind went rapidly the plans for the proceeding
campaign already mapped out and co-ordinated. He had no doubt the
Allies would wish to take the field only for a month or so, and
then, according to usual custom, retire into winter quarters, but
he did not intend to follow this tedious practice: he meant to
force the enemy to continue the campaign throughout the winter,
however rigorous that might be. It was by no means to his liking
that they should escape him for the whole period of the severe
months; before the snows and frosts came he meant to be in
Brussels. Yes, as near as that; to have the Allies pushed right
across their own frontiers, well back into Hanover and Holland.
At present they held the whole line of the Marne, Huy, Liége,
Namur, but he would soon get them out of their imposing forts.
There was Bavaria too: they had their claws on that, and that
must be released and almost first of all, for it was the
Elector's own peculiar patrimony, and not to his honour or to
that of his commander that it should remain in the hands of the
enemy.</p>

<p>There was Anhalt-Dessau too, and Christian smiled when he
visualized the smallness of Anhalt-Dessau on the map. That must
be protected: that little speck of land that had suddenly become
of such vast importance to himself. Behind Vienna, of course,
there was little to be done. Hungary held fast to the queen who
called herself Empress; and behind Hungary, Bulgaria and her Czar
was steady to the same cause. But forward&mdash;forward the whole
of the Empire must be cleared; those Lowlanders must be taught
their manners too. Christian foresaw himself at the gates of
Bergen-op-Zoom and even at those of Breda.</p>

<p>He had already sent many couriers off from Schönbuchel, and
meant to send out more from Ottenheim. Maréchal De Lisle, the
French commander, held headquarters at Prague. Christian meant to
effect a juncture with him as soon as possible. He was glad that
he would have to work with De Lisle, a courteous and an able man,
an accomplished if not a great soldier, one who, he knew, admired
him and would be delighted to work with him as Commander-in-Chief
of the Imperial Forces. There was no difficulty about the French,
though there might be some with the Austrian, Spanish and Italian
generals, such as Fürth, Arroya, Olivenza, Knittelfeldt and
Guastalla, especially the two first; but these incompetent and
flourishing men would soon be mastered by arrogance and force, if
not by fear and diplomacy.</p>

<p>As many troops as possible must be got into the field, and as
soon as possible. Christian knew that the power of his name would
raise many thousands, both in Kurland and Pomerania, indeed in
all parts of the Empire, who would otherwise have remained
inactive or reluctant. He did not believe in forced levies, and
never had been obliged to use them. Whenever he gave the call to
arms, his name promised both pay and plunder and all manner of
soldiers had willingly responded; he believed he could crown his
man in Frankfurt before Christmas. Nay, not only in Frankfurt, he
smiled to himself, but perhaps in Aix-la-Chapelle, the old city
of Carlo Magnus. That would be amusing, to flaunt the Allies so
far as that. He wondered if Hensdorff would think the bargain
fulfilled then, if Leopold of Bavaria was doubly crowned at
Frankfurt and Aix-la-Chapelle, and so, twice robed in the purple,
escorted back to Vienna&mdash;swept by a conquering army to the
very gates of the Hofburg.</p>

<p>The English were most to be feared, both for their courage and
their organization; but they were fighting under princes alien to
them, and had engaged in the war with reluctance. Christian knew
full well that soldiers ill-supported at home seldom made a good
figure on the field; at the first reverse the English Parliament
would force a peace.</p>

<p>Early on the morrow he, Hensdorff and Anhalt-Dessau would ride
to Prague with the regiments of Uhlans, Hussars and Croats that
he had now at Ottenheim&mdash;his own regiments. A few troops
would be left behind to guard the women, but not many, because
Ottenheim was safe enough so far away, miles behind the line
Austria still held, and would be much farther still when
Christian had pushed the Imperial fortunes nearer to the enemy's
frontiers.</p>

<p>Christian wondered if the battalions from Italy, Lombardy and
Mantua had come up yet; it was time; Guastalla deserved to be
cashiered for being so long on the way; he had been sent for in
the spring; it had not been for him to take advantage of this
foolish truce to linger; the longer the conference sat in
Brussels, the quicker should have been his progress across the
Alps. There was a great deal in every way to do, but it could be
done; there were a great many towns to take, but they could be
taken; there were a great many miles to march, but they could be
marched; there were a great many men to muster, but they could be
raised; there were a great many different personalities to
conciliate, but Christian could conciliate them. In complete
self-confidence, in serene self-assurance he closed his book as
they turned into the straight avenue which led to the Château
Ottenheim. His thoughts turned to his own land on the
Baltic&mdash;Kurland, where he would be lord indeed when Leopold
was Emperor, a part, and only a small part, of his reward; the
future glittered.</p>

<p>Christian smiled at the Duchess as if he had suddenly realized
her presence, and asked her, in his soft, indifferent-sounding
voice, if she had found the drive at all tedious? She answered,
hurriedly, no; that it had been very pleasant, talking with
Colonel Pons and looking out upon the stars, which shone so
pleasantly and so brightly over the valley; it was like noontide
for the radiance of the river.</p>

<p>Christian, in the same impersonal tone, then asked Eleanora if
she felt fatigued after a day which, he added, must have been of
a certain agitation. He hoped, he said, that she would find all
she wished in the Château, and was sorry that his sudden
departure prevented him from more personally and immediately
being at her service.</p>

<p>Eleanora glanced at him in a frightened way and did not
answer, though her lips moved as if to form some words of apology
or acquiescence.</p>

<p>"She will be very well," said the Duchess hastily.
"Monseigneur, I assure you that Eleanora will be very well. And
of course we are, both of us, slightly fatigued, and if we could
at once retire to our apartments we should be indebted to your
courtesy."</p>

<p>An adroit <i>maitre d'hôtel</i> had hastily adjusted these
same apartments for the reception of the ladies. The voluptuous
tapestries, amorous pictures, and coquettish statues had been
removed from Prince Christian's rooms, his bedchamber draped with
a more decorous fabled arras, and a considerable number of books
in the library exchanged for those more fitting the perusal of a
lady. All this on receipt of a message sent from Christian at
Schönbuchel. He did not keep inefficient people in his service;
his commands were always immediately and swiftly obeyed;
everything was now in order, and his own quick glance round the
Château saw that his least wish had been quickly put into
execution.</p>

<p>A delicious supper was prepared for the ladies, but when they
declared that they did not wish for this, and would rather at
once go to their rooms, they were immediately escorted with the
celerity of a fairy service to the beautiful apartments at the
back of the Château overlooking the Danube. Here was more
splendour than Eleanora, educated austerely and brought up
strictly, had ever in her life beheld before. The lamplight
revealed to her a shining and gorgeous room, in the most
extravagant and cultured French taste, furnished in every detail
with sophisticated beauty. The Duchess was hardly less
magnificently housed; she could scarcely restrain an ironic grin,
ay, one did oneself magnificently out of pay and plunder, rout
and spoil!</p>

<p>Christian, with indifferent courtesy, took leave of them and
retired into his private cabinet with Count Hensdorff and Colonel
Pons. There was a great deal that he still wished to learn from
Hensdorff; for the time being this minister was in the position
of an ally, ready with necessary information and loyal service.
He did not doubt Hensdorff; their interests were now identical,
and there was a certain quality about the statesman that
Christian respected. He never gave a thought, as a lesser man
might have done, to the possibility of Hensdorff deceiving him,
betraying him or in any way playing him false. He really rather
liked Hensdorff, and he thought that Hensdorff rather liked him;
between them, he knew they would have to do everything.</p>

<p>The long-disputed bargain had been at length settled. There
was nothing more to argue about, and they might be quite good
friends. So much was said in Christian's smile as he glanced
across at Hensdorff over the maps and documents with which the
Russian malachite table was strewn.</p>

<p>"You and I, my dear Count," he remarked, "must now get things
clear. It seems to me that we've got very little time in which to
consider anything. This is my plan of campaign, and I shall be
glad to know if it has your approval. As to the assent of the
Emperor, I suppose we need not trouble to send a courier to
Vienna to demand that. You and I, I take it, my dear Count, can
decide these matters between us."</p>

<p>"It was understood," agreed Hensdorff, "that you were to have
supreme command. There is no question of referring to Leopold or
even to me."</p>

<p>He said this, knowing that Christian had only spoken out of
courtesy, and that he would certainly act on his own initiative
and without any regard to any one.</p>

<p>Christian bowed, accepting the return compliment, and
remarked:</p>

<p>"I am afraid there may be trouble with the other
generals&mdash;not with De Lisle, of course, or with any of the
Frenchmen, but perhaps with Guastalla, Arroya and Olivenza."</p>

<p>"You will be able to see to that," remarked Hensdorff
drily.</p>

<p>Christian brought out his maps and his fine hand went up and
down over them, pointing out this place to be taken, that place
to be avoided, this fort which must fall, that city which must
surrender, that village which must be occupied. Hensdorff
listened with the deepest admiration and even with a certain
growing excitement. In the presence of this man, so long
accustomed to full command, so supreme in his own self-assurance,
the Count felt a growing confidence in his own doubtful cause, a
growing certainty that Leopold would indeed be the Emperor and he
his first Minister. All that had been vague, confused, undecided,
now seemed strong, definite, straightforward.</p>

<p>In a few hours Christian had mapped out the whole campaign,
foreseen everything, arranged everything, made out a list of his
requirements&mdash;men, money, horses, artillery&mdash;and
suggested names for the posts of Paymaster General and
Quartermaster General. Hensdorff could find no flaw in anything
he suggested; here was experience and great talent working
together.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the question of the money, but for the
moment the treasury was not so badly replenished. Hensdorff
thought he could answer for the cash for the next few months at
least, and Christian had very ample private resources which no
doubt he would be glad to call upon in a cause which was
practically his own cause; in any case he would equip and pay his
own regiments.</p>

<p>When he had briefly and clearly explained himself, he pushed
aside his maps and notes and rose swiftly.</p>

<p>"I must get a little sleep," he said, "for I have promised to
ride early to Prague. Nothing quite definite can be decided upon
until I have spoken to De Lisle, until I am quite sure of the
French&mdash;they are fatigued and disheartened, I know. It is
now," he added, pulling back the curtain and looking from the
window, "nearly dawn."</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, Hensdorff recalled for the first time that
this was Christian's wedding night. Odd, thought Hensdorff; odd,
from first to last; the whole business odd. But it was no matter
of his, and he, too, would be glad of a little repose before
setting out on the long journey tomorrow. So he bade his host a
cordial good night and left him in the little cabinet, curious,
but satisfied about that day's business.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons also soon left. He had his orders and asked
nothing more than the chance to carry them out; he was soured
that he was to remain at Ottenheim but gratified at the trust
shown him; he admitted there was no one else worthy of this
trust.</p>

<p>Christian, alone in the cabinet, pulled the curtains farther
apart from the window and again looked out at the paling sky. He
delighted in that noble prospect of the Danube. It was because of
the Danube, and not to rival Leopold at Bosenberg, that he built
his Château at Ottenheim.</p>

<p>An eventful day for him, he mused, this past day, a day in
which he had gained what men called a heart's desire; he hoped
that he had been able to conceal from every one that it was his
heart's desire, that no one had been able to get behind the
barrier of his smiling gravity. He thought that by now he had had
good practice in that; surrounded always by people watching and
spying, ready to sneer and grin, he was well used to concealing
his feelings behind a serene insolent mask. The Duchess had
probed and he had allowed her to know his mind, but this brought
no rankle; he was glad she understood him; he was safe in his
house, his wife under his roof, surrounded by his guards, in
every way his, to be kept for him till he should return.</p>

<p>He thought of her with an overwhelming tenderness from which
all gross passion had been purged. No tumultuous emotion now
disturbed him as he dwelt on the image of Eleanora; he had
achieved her; she was his, and he could afford to wait, as he had
so long waited, as he had promised he would wait. He could wait a
little longer now before indulging in even the raptures of the
mind. She was safe with the loyal, cynical, valiant old woman,
with her own attendants around her, in this splendid house, far
away from all possible danger; and he, with a quiet heart, could
set about paying the price that he had sworn to pay for her, that
he was in honour bound to pay for her; that it was his choice and
pride to pay.</p>

<p>He wondered with a compassionate irony if she disliked him;
that she did not like him he was sure: he had noticed that she
turned away from him with quivering frowns; but he was too used
to success in every direction to doubt success in this direction.
It did not seem possible to the valiant arrogant, self-reliant
man that he could in time fail to win this girl. He could not
recall having failed with any other woman, and why should he fail
here? He would give her everything she wished&mdash;nay, more
than she could possibly wish, more than she could ever even have
dreamt of. He knew quite well that she had not led a very soft or
easy life with her disagreeable, pedantic old father, who had
fussed and fumed and fretted over her, who had treated her as a
schoolgirl and scorned her for childish fancies and dreaming
ways. He, her husband, would allow her all the fancies and all
the dreams that she could possibly yearn for; all the toys and
trifles, too.</p>

<p>Christian smiled to himself again to think how little she knew
of him, how little she ever would know of him, and how he knew,
and always would know, everything about her, she who was as
transparent as crystal. He pictured her in his superb bed in his
beautiful room, surrounded by all the delicious and splendid
things that expressed his own refined and sophisticated taste,
things he had bought as the rewards of his victories. How had she
slept on this night, which must be to her so strange a night?</p>

<p>Perhaps now with the dawn she found her first sleep; or
perhaps she had slept and was now awake; in any case it would be
as well that he should say good-bye to her before leaving
her&mdash;perhaps for months leaving her. He had no wish to leave
on her mind the impression of a severe master, but rather that of
a friend, a benefactor.</p>

<p>He had the keys of her chamber in his desk, and his steady
heart leapt as he touched them. He took off his sword and belt
and the chains and orders which he had worn all day, and turned
down the long, ornate, quietly lit corridors of Ottenheim.</p>

<p>She slept alone; only a little black boy lay curled up at her
door on the green satin cushion in the anteroom. The old Duchess
was on the floor above and Charlotte in the rooms beyond. In all
these great, gorgeous chambers the Princess Eleanora slept alone
with a little black page curled up at her door, in the room where
the guards used to wait.</p>

<p>Christian entered his bedchamber without waking the child; he
could step lightly. The two long windows of the large apartment
were open and the curtains pulled apart; he could see the gilt
swelling balustrade of the balcony, the blue landscape meltingly
sweet beyond. The summer dawn filled the room with pearly light;
with silver, unearthly light.</p>

<p>The newly hung glittering draperies of the bed were drawn to,
and she lay in the attitude in which the page had lain, huddled
up under the tumbled, rich bedclothes, her soft hand nestling
under her soft cheek. She had cried herself to sleep; her lashes
were sticky still with tears.</p>

<p>Christian sat down cautiously on the end of the bed and looked
at her; she was fully revealed in the radiance of the breaking
day. The place, the moment, were to him holy and full of an
almost unbearable delight; he visualized the future, full of a
rapture that seemed incredible for this world. He certainly loved
her, he told himself, and so tremendous was this love that when
it ceased he felt his life would cease too; surely there could be
no further existence when there was no Eleanora to love. In this
silence, in this remote room, in this still, early hour, he
seemed to feel a touch of eternity in looking at her lovely
youth; he seemed to feel the immortal in the transient, the
certainty of the radiant and everlasting soul in the frail and
doomed clay.</p>

<p>His love for her could not be of a piece with passing time,
but must have root in a past and throw blooming branches into a
future that was beyond all mortal computation with lean words
like "death" and "time." She was his now, given to him, in his
power now and forever; his and in his power; and not for twice
the value of that diadem which he had sworn to put on Leopold of
Bavaria's brow would he have harmed her or frightened her in any
way, even by telling her his adoration. The Duchess need not have
warned him, though he honoured her for that warning; a proof of
affection indeed which had made him decide to ask her to
Ottenheim to leave Eleanora in her care. He would so leave her
with a good heart, admiring the old woman for the courage with
which she had spoken to him; for her appreciation of his
motives.</p>

<p>"I hope you love Eleanora," she had said, and he had answered,
uncertain how to put so great a matter into words: "I hope I do
love her."</p>

<p>And now he knew; certainly he loved her; his long-subdued
passion could not have been stilled to this reverence had he not
loved her.</p>

<p>She stirred in her sleep and threw out her hand. He touched it
delicately, curiously, and at that touch she started and woke,
for her slumbers had been full of unkind dreams. Not for long had
she known oblivion; the tears on her cheeks were still wet, as
was the pillow from which she raised her head.</p>

<p>At sight of him she started up in panting alarm and pulled the
bedclothes to her chin. Christian smiled in tender amusement.</p>

<p>"A little liberty," he said, "is permitted before one's
husband, Madame, but probably you have not yet realized that I am
your husband. I admit the ceremony was very hurried, but in a few
hours I shall ride away and leave you your freedom for months,"
he added with formality, rising.</p>

<p>She looked relieved, but he was not hurt by that; he had so
long before him. She pulled her lace cap under her chin and
nervously tied the blue strings.</p>

<p>"You are mistress here," he reminded her. "The Duchess is with
you, and Charlotte, and your own maids, and all the rest are your
guards or your servants. I shall leave Colonel Pons in command;
he is a loyal man and you may trust him. Whatever you say he will
do, whatever you want you shall have."</p>

<p>But Eleanora continued to look at him in fright and seemed
unable to speak; rosy, rounded and plump, she nestled into the
coverlet and cushions.</p>

<p>"I am going to the war," added Christian, "but it will not be
long before I am back. Perhaps you will sometimes write to me?
Perhaps you will sometimes think of me? Who knows?" And he
laughed lightly to himself, happy in the thought of the
future.</p>

<p>"You are going to the war?" whispered Eleanora. The Duchess
had told her something of that. "What are you going to fight for,
Monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"I am going," he smiled, "to put the diadem on the head of
Leopold of Bavaria. Perhaps you have heard of that dispute for
the Imperial Crown?"</p>

<p>Eleanora had heard from the Duchess of the renewal of the war,
when she had been told who Captain Leopold was, and she looked at
Christian now with a more lively interest, with even a
forgetfulness of her fear. She did not regard him as her husband
or her possible lover, but as the man who was going to uphold the
fortune of Leopold, who was going to crown him and make him to be
indeed the Emperor.</p>

<p>"You saw Leopold," added Christian, "two nights ago. He sat at
your father's table. Did you notice him?" ("He is but a slight
creature, but I must make the best of him," was on his lips to
add, but he repressed this out of loyalty.)</p>

<p>Eleanora did not answer this: she did not want to talk about
Leopold, least of all to Christian, but she cherished in her
heart the prospect of his being made Emperor, and she looked with
admiration at Christian, who was to accomplish this glorious end.
She had asked the Duchess why Leopold had ridden away and why he
had come in disguise to Dürsheim. She had not been answered and
had not been able to guess. She did not know anything of the
bargain which had been made about her hand, or of the real cause
of Leopold's incognito and of his discomfited withdrawal.</p>

<p>Christian, leaning on the side of the splendid bed, was
suddenly speaking to her with a deep, with a passionate, with a
fastidious tenderness.</p>

<p>"What is it you would like? I do not think you have often had
what you would like. But I can give you anything. What do you
want? A chariot with white ponies, toy dogs, jewels? See, I have
a jewel for you here&mdash;something I have brought for you,
something I had made for you a long time ago, soon after I first
saw you. I have been carrying it about with me for days, waiting
for an opportunity to give it to you, Eleanora."</p>

<p>He brought from under the laces on his bosom a small
tortoise-shell case and, opening it, showed a fine gold chain on
which hung two green diamonds. He dropped these on the coverlet.
One of these diamonds came from the regalia of Kurland; Christian
had worn it as a hat clasp; since he had met Eleanora he had
scoured Europe and Asia for another and found it, though it was
not of so perfect a colour as the first which his father had
bought from the King of Poland with a regiment of Hussars, and
which was named Mitau. These two diamonds, in and out of which
the blue and green light slipped in long beams, were cupped in
minute filigree gold shaped like curling opening buds; the chain
was gossamer fine.</p>

<p>"There is a pretty toy for you," Christian said. "Wear it
sometimes, will you not? They have dressed you very badly with
all those old-fashioned, clumsy jewels; with all those stiff
Venetian brocades. You must get your clothes in Paris in the
Palais Royal. I will see that you get them there. I will send you
a French dressmaker and a French hairdresser&mdash;I want you to
look very beautiful, Eleanora; you must not let them spoil you
with their heavy German taste."</p>

<p>Eleanora listened to him as if she did not comprehend what he
said, or the value of his gift; she shrank farther away into her
pillows. She looked, indeed, like a pink pearl in this delicious
brightening light of the dawn. She was impressed by his
extravagant, dark splendour, by his vital, triumphant air, by the
force and power in his eyes and words; but she was thinking all
the while of Leopold, and of how these qualities might serve
Leopold. She did not touch the diamonds.</p>

<p>"Oh, lovely, lovely, lovely!" thought Christian, gazing at
her. "Like a flower, like a shell, like a star! And mine, mine,
mine!" His to be kept and guarded for him, his to be won in a
long and delicious leisure. All his pulses seemed to swing to the
rhythm of a triumphal march; proud melodies filled the air, the
waving of banners and the shouts of battle went by the placid
window light against the background of the Danube.</p>

<p>He was glad, he rejoiced that he had had to pay a noble price
for this noble prize; that victorious campaigns and fallen cities
must go to pay for the Princess Eleanora. Not for any less thing
than the winning of a diadem for another man would have bought
her. And she, too, should be crowned, robed and crowned in her
beauty; Duchess of Kurland she should be&mdash;ay, and of other
lands besides, before he had completed his career; it would take
more than Kurland to quench his ambition.</p>

<p>"You are safe here," he assured her, "utterly safe. Do not be
alarmed about anything. I lead the Emperor's armies, and I shall
push them back even farther than they are now from Ottenheim. And
you will not be lonely here, and it will not be long before the
spring&mdash;and my return."</p>

<p>He paused and stood looking down at her with infinite
affection, with infinite pity, compassion, and delight. His
rapture had passed beyond material passion and become a spiritual
emotion; he did not want to possess her yet other than with his
soul. It was no forbearance on his part to leave her thus, but an
acknowledgment of the radiant quality of his love. He would not
even kiss her hand for fear of profaning this perfect moment, so
gilded with exquisite triumph.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Eleanora," he said. "Farewell, my love!" he added
under his breath.</p>

<p>Eleanora's vague dreads and alarms had been soothed; she saw
that he was going to leave her and she was reassured; she wanted
to be alone to indulge her lulling dreams of the other man.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Monseigneur," she trembled in reply, "and may good
fortune attend you and His Imperial Majesty!"</p>

<p>Christian only heard a touching formality in these words; he
did not know how sincere were her good wishes for Leopold. How
could he guess that she looked more kindly on him because he was
the champion of the young man who had so invaded her enclosed
fancy; he dared not linger, the perfect moment must not dissolve,
like a bubble too vivid to endure; already the common glow of day
was invading the chamber. With a hundred rapturous farewells
unspoken on his lips he left her; Eleanora peered round the
curtains to see him go.</p>

<p>When the door was closed on him she picked up the green
diamond called Mitau and its lesser fellow, and set this twin
lustrous sparkle in delight against her bare bosom; forgetting
everything as she viewed her own whiteness set off by the
splinters of azure and emerald radiance.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">PRINCE CHRISTIAN and his cavalcade left the
banks of the Danube, and went as directly as the roads permitted
towards Nuremberg, on the route to Prague, where they were to be
joined by the Imperial troops garrisoning that town. At the hot
midday they halted, and Christian, in a chance room of the best
house in a wayside village, took the first repose that he had
known for hours.</p>

<p>He was, however, scarcely conscious of fatigue; his robust
body was borne up by his robust thoughts; his powerful mind,
active and acute, required little rest or pause in its constant
occupation of deliberate and courageous thought. He sat down at
once to his travelling desk and wrote to Linx, the famous
engineer, now sulking in Turin, whose services he was eager to
regain for the Imperial Cause; then to the King of Prussia who
had left every party in turn, but who favoured General Crack.
These dispatched, he put business out of his mind.</p>

<p>The day was bright with the last hot radiancy of summer, the
whole landscape outlined in gold, the poor village gilded.
Christian paused now to consider, not the formidable task in
front of him, but the ravishment of the relinquished delights
that he had left behind. Not Prague, or even Brussels, was in his
mind, but Ottenheim, and the chamber of Eleanora, shining as a
rainbow in the dawn.</p>

<p>He had sent Hensdorff to Vienna, bidding him bring the Emperor
without any delay to Prague, there to meet the French and assume
the nominal command of the Imperial Forces. It was imperative,
Christian had insisted, that Leopold should at once assume at
least the appearance of the Caesar; such pretensions as his, the
mercenary had smiled, required at least a definite posture of
rigid royalty.</p>

<p>Now that Christian had entered the service of Leopold, he was
scrupulous always to give him his full titles; there was no
slight or sneer in the manner in which he referred to
Leopold&mdash;as if the fact of his being his master dignified
him to the height of the uttermost claim.</p>

<p>Hensdorff had noted and approved this attitude. He had also
approved the insistence of Christian on the presence of Leopold
at the French headquarters; and, afterwards, in the forefront of
the war. The old Count wished that Leopold had had the courage
and the fortitude to remain at Dürsheim, instead of flying like a
defeated creature back to his detested capital; he had therefore
gone willingly to Vienna.</p>

<p>From this mean village room, Christian, checking his reserves,
sent out courier after courier to the Spanish general, Olivenza,
the Italian general, Guastalla, and to Maréchal De Lisle,
apprising them that he was now the Commander-in-Chief of the
Imperial Forces, begging them to inform him of their dispositions
and plans as quickly as possible, and naming Prague as the
instant rendezvous for the junction of all the Emperor's
troops.</p>

<p>It was late in the languid afternoon before he had finished
dictating these dispatches, but he no longer felt any desire for
sleep. A certain fatigue had assailed him when he had dismounted
at the door of the tree-shadowed house; but now that was gone, an
inner fire of exaltation supported him; to think of victory and
Eleanora was sufficient refreshment for his arduous soul; to
sleep would be to miss some hours of triumphant reflections.</p>

<p>He sent for Herr Lippmann, the astrologer, who on his own
entreaty had accompanied him on this martial progress.</p>

<p>"Well, Herr Lippmann," he asked, smiling, "what do you think
of my destiny now?"</p>

<p>And the subtle astrologer, bowing, said:</p>

<p>"No doubt it is still somewhat in the balance; but it swings
very well to the advantage of Your Highness."</p>

<p>"The stars?" cried Christian, on a note of exultation. "I feel
that I could throw up my hat and catch them in it! A fig for your
stars, Herr Lippmann, and all your prophecies!"</p>

<p>"Your Highness," replied Herr Lippmann, curiously, "seems well
pleased!" And he looked with a certain amazement at the superb
figure, whose splendour the meanness of the room was unable in
any way to efface. Christian, walking up and down this village
parlour, seemed like the master of any destiny in the watching
eyes of Herr Lippmann and the two secretaries, gathering up their
dispatches from the rough, wooden table, stained from many a
homely meal.</p>

<p>"Do you not think I shall succeed, Lippmann?" asked the
magnificent soldier. "Do you not think that I look like
success?"</p>

<p>"I think Your Highness seems success itself," replied the old
man. "The flaw in your scheme is the man you fight for: if
Caesar, now, were of another quality!"</p>

<p>But Christian brushed that aside: as a man who sees all
obstacles as mist before the sun of his endeavours. "Leopold is
well enough!" he said. "I trust to make a fine, flourishing
figure of him yet."</p>

<p>He dismissed the astrologer and the secretaries and sat down
to write in his own hand a letter to the Princess Eleanora, and
another to the Duchess of Schönbuchel; it was characteristic of
his direct and energetic spirit that every scrap and shred of
business had been disposed of before he set himself this amiable
task. No personal affairs had ever interfered with public affairs
where Christian was concerned, and they would not interfere now,
rapt as he was in a profound and arduous emotion.</p>

<p>He was a soldier even before he was the lover of Eleanora;
never would she come between him and his work. He wrote for an
hour or so in a flowing fashion, relieving in graceful words the
concealed pent ardours of months; and when he had finished,
without reading the paper he tore it up and cast it down behind
the stove. The moment had not yet arrived for him to risk
frightening her with the elegant violence of even these written
declarations; she would not understand.</p>

<p>The formal note to the Duchess was sealed. In it he told
her&mdash;what he had told her by word of mouth&mdash;that he
trusted her, and hoped to receive her frequent reports as to the
health and happiness of his wife; he asked her to write to the
headquarters at Prague, and assured her with tactful discretion
that all his goods and wealth and power were at her disposal, for
the moment at least. He knew that these attractions would appeal
to the worldly old woman; although he could rely on her to look
after Eleanora for the girl's own sake; he had learnt never to
rely too much on abstract virtues.</p>

<p>And then, sitting there in superb bravery and flamboyant
bedecked attire, sitting there alone in the mean and squalid
room, his thoughts went oddly far away&mdash;far away even from
Eleanora, and back to his own childhood and that one glimpse he
had had of his mother's picture: his Italian Columbine mother,
whose violent Southern blood had so flavoured his own.</p>

<p>He recalled how his father had one day asked him into the
library in the palace of Mitau and had taken out a case of red
leather from a tortoise-shell and brass cabinet, and shown him
this woman's face, painted on a square of ivory&mdash;a dark,
lively woman whose vivacious eyes, whose curling red lips,
laughed from the picture. Swarthy she had been, with a profusion
of dark curls&mdash;a profusion of dark curls like his own; with
black eyes like his own, too; with the same joy of life looking
through the same arrogance; too vivid, too bright, too swift for
these slow, dull times.</p>

<p>Christian had never seen that miniature again, nor been able
to find it when his father died and he had been briefly master of
the palace, and the library, and the books, and had searched for
it, not once, but many times. He knew nothing about his mother
save her nationality and profession; his father had always barred
that subject, only alluding to it on this one occasion&mdash;and
then not by words, but by the mere silent showing of the picture,
with a cold hand and a scornful lip. He wondered now if his
father had loved his mother as perversely as he loved Eleanora,
and he thought, "No; this could not have been so, or some way or
other he would have contrived to marry her, and spared me a
lifetime of secret shame and bitter disappointment."</p>

<p>His musing thus coming round to his hidden wound, he raged,
and walked restlessly up and down the room. He felt a sudden
fatigue grow on his limbs, and wished to lose himself in
dreams.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the evening, but there was nothing to be
done; he had accomplished all his business. Nor was there any
special need for desperate haste. The country all round was firm
for Leopold, and it was unlikely that the Allies had even begun
to move as yet. Even if he took two or three days on the road, he
would be at Prague before they had begun to stir. Well he knew
their lethargic habits, and the dissensions in their ranks; their
reluctance to recommence the war, and the disputes among the
Commanders.</p>

<p>He meant, before they had decided on any definite line of
action, to have their fortresses rattling round their
ears&mdash;to have them pushed back over the frontiers into
Hanover and the farthest ends of the Low Countries. He must
inspire De Lisle with more energy than he had yet shown, and urge
those elegant French troops into a more energetic display of
vigour.</p>

<p>But he was capable of doing this: he knew that his name would
run like wildfire through the men, inspiring them to more than
they had dreamed of undertaking since he left their command. The
war had languished sorely since he had served the Queen of
Hungary and afterwards retired from the fight, having swept up
all the rewards and plunder for the moment offering.</p>

<p>"I ought to end it by the spring," he said to himself, pacing
about; "I ought to have them beaten back and asking for peace
before the spring."</p>

<p>Captain Banning came to tell him that a more decent lodging
had been found; but Christian refused to move. He was, he said,
very well in the cottage, and had no wish for more sumptuous
quarters. Yet into this same cottage he crowded his valets and
barbers, and in the morning had preserved his usual appearance of
unsullied elegance; powdered, perfumed, close-shaved, he appeared
in a uniform admirably fitting and admirably adorned with every
device of luxurious military appointment.</p>

<p>"I dreamt well last night," he told Banning, with his
brilliant smile; and indeed the night had passed for him like a
rapturous vision.</p>

<p>He reviewed his immaculate troops in the field beyond the
village; this was a formality, as Christian always kept his men
in the prime of condition, and as he rode between the precise
ranks, his trained eye was considering the village and the
country; he had no interest in boors, but as he surveyed the
prospect, prosperous and well ordered despite the war, he was
thinking of Kurland, of how he would plan, build up, administer,
improve agriculture, lay out towns, found universities, erect
palaces&mdash;have done with war, construct instead of destroy.
He set no confines to those bold designs which occupied his mind
as he again took the road to Nuremberg with his magnificent,
invincible air, riding in front of the banners of Austria and
Kurland, the Lions of Ketlar and Hapsburg.</p>

<p>While General Crack was thus advancing on Prague, Ferdinand
Gabor was reaching Vienna, where he tried to obtain an audience
of Leopold. Not succeeding in this, he got into touch with
Hensdorff, and put before him his claims for recognition and
reward, stating how he had been cashiered from Christian's
regiment.</p>

<p>"This whole matter," he reminded the statesman, "is my doing.
<i>I</i> told you the bait at which Christian would jump, even if
<i>you</i> put it on the hook."</p>

<p>This was true, and Hensdorff had no wish to ignore the
obligation; but he wanted to understand what the trouble had been
between Christian and the Transylvanian. He remembered with what
impetuous coldness Christian had told him that Gabor was no
longer in his service. Something rather serious must have
happened for Christian to talk like that, with such keen
decision; for Hensdorff knew that Christian was not so particular
or fastidious in his choice of instruments nor in the character
of his officers. What, then, had Gabor done to have been so
summarily and so instantly dismissed?</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff, closeted at last with Gabor in a cabinet in
the Hofburg, asked this.</p>

<p>"Why," he demanded, "did Christian dismiss you? What is this
secret trouble?"</p>

<p>"There was none," replied the Transylvanian, suavely; "nothing
but the ill-regulated temper of an arrogant man&mdash;the
swelling presumption of an upstart."</p>

<p>"But that," Hensdorff sharply reminded him, "you have been
able to put up with for a good many years, in the same way that
Prince Christian has put up with you. There must be something
more, and you had better tell me if we are to be of any use to
each other."</p>

<p>Gabor shrugged his lean narrow shoulders, and his sallow face
took on a look of dark irony.</p>

<p>"You do not know Christian as I know him," he sneered. "He is
a spoilt darling of fortune, and indulges every whim and caprice
that crosses his proud mind. His caprice then was to be tired of
me. I suppose that he was rather elated by his triumph and
overwrought by the effort to conceal this excitement. I at least
was the scapegoat for his mood; I have been before&mdash;it is
always his endeavour to conceal in public those gross vulgar
passions he indulges in private."</p>

<p>But Hensdorff was not deceived; he knew that there was
something behind all this spite and he demanded impatiently:</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell me what it is, Gabor? You are no longer in
Prince Christian's service, and therefore not very much use to
me. What do you want? A reward? Well, you shall have it; but let
us not make too much ado about it, for I have many matters on
hand."</p>

<p>"I do not desire a reward," answered Gabor; "I want service
with the Emperor. You know well enough what I am worth. For years
I have been Christian's secret service agent and spy and
newsmonger; and I am well used to all the backwaters of intrigue.
He owes to me a great deal of the success that he flaunts."</p>

<p>"I dare say," agreed Hensdorff, negligently.</p>

<p>"And you," Gabor repeated, "certainly owe to me the compact
you have just sealed."</p>

<p>But Michael Hensdorff insisted:</p>

<p>"The Prince is not the man to dismiss any one without a good
reason&mdash;especially a man like you, whom he has found
supremely useful."</p>

<p>Observing that the astute Hensdorff was not to be satisfied,
Gabor then admitted, with another shrug and a malicious sneer,
that he had been found talking with the Princess Eleanora between
the hornbeam hedges of the quidnunc at Dürsheim.</p>

<p>"Escorting her back to the Château," he said, "and Monseigneur
took offence at this&mdash;was affronted that I should have dared
to talk to or look at the lady! And struck me, Count
Hensdorff&mdash;struck me on the face! The gutter manners of his
mother, you perceive they come to the surface, after years of
Versailles."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff understood now; he could visualize the scene
accurately. His sympathies were with Christian; had he been the
betrothed or the husband of Princess Eleanora, or of any woman,
he would not have cared to see her speaking to Gabor, or such as
Gabor, behind any hornbeam hedge.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked drily, "no more; no need to go any further
into that. What is it you want of me? I dare say some manner of
post can be found for you where your peculiar talents will be
useful."</p>

<p>But Gabor wanted more than this; he wanted an audience with
the Emperor; nothing else would satisfy him save that peculiar
favor.</p>

<p>"With Leopold?" asked Hensdorff, bored. "But why? He is the
last man to have any interest in such an affair as this. Let him
alone: he is already sufficiently agitated and disarrayed. This
whole matter has gone hardly with him, and I have had
considerable difficulty in schooling him for his part."</p>

<p>"No matter for that," persisted Gabor; "perhaps what I have to
say or suggest to him will put him into better spirits."</p>

<p>Hensdorff considered that such a villain could have nothing to
say that would put any man into good spirits, least of all one as
sensitive and nervous as Leopold and, at present, as
ill-tempered; and so he refused to arrange the interview; but Gabor
was not disheartened; he beat upon his point and finally his
persistency bore down the wearied reluctance of Hensdorff, who
did finally arrange for him to speak to the Emperor, the hour
after the audience given by His Majesty to the Ambassador of
France.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor waited patiently in the gilded lofty corridor
for this opportunity; he did not mind how long the delay if the
plan which was maturing in his mind could be brought to success;
he was a patient and a concentrated man.</p>

<p>At length the Frenchman took his leave, and Gabor had his
chance at last; for Hensdorff opened the tall scrolled door and
sourly beckoned him within. And there was Leopold, looking
discontented and sad, seated in the window-place and staring over
the Court of Honour&mdash;the bleak, grey, enormous square that
bounded the monstrous facade of the dreary Hofburg.</p>

<p>Leopold did not in any particular appear more the Emperor than
he had appeared at Dürsheim, but Gabor bowed very low, as if he
saw him robed and crowned at Frankfurt, and contrived to throw a
deep reverence into his servile obeisance.</p>

<p>Leopold eyed him with peevish indifference; he knew nothing
whatever about this man's wish with him for Hensdorff had been
careful not to relate the reason of his dismissal from Dürsheim.
All that Leopold knew of Gabor was that he was some manner of
secret agent or spy who had been employed by Christian, and,
having left that service, wished to serve him in some secret way.
So he asked languidly, and not without contempt:</p>

<p>'"What is this matter on which you wish to speak to me, Prince
Gabor? I have been greatly loaded and plagued with business
to-day, and if you could speak briefly I should be obliged."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor answered humbly:</p>

<p>"Your Majesty shall not complain that I am not brief; what I
have to say is soon said. Not, perhaps, so soon understood or
acted upon. I cannot hope that Your Majesty will at first take it
kindly: you may even be affronted; but I speak as one man of the
world to another, if Your Majesty will pardon that amount of
presumption." And he could not keep a leer from his lean, ruined
face.</p>

<p>But the harassed Leopold was in no mood to pardon any man's
presumption, and he did not answer, but looked indifferently upon
the ground, frowning and playing with his ruffles.</p>

<p>"What I have to say," insinuated Gabor, "concerns the Princess
Eleanora."</p>

<p>And at that name Leopold did look up, and sharply, while a
lively colour overspread his long pale face.</p>

<p>"What can <i>you</i> have to do with the Princess Eleanora?"
he demanded impetuously.</p>

<p>"Very little indeed, Sire," smiled Gabor; "but I did see and
hear something when I was at Dürsheim which should be of some
interest to you. But perhaps I am mistaken; and if so, I take my
leave, saying no more."</p>

<p>"You are not mistaken," replied Leopold, indiscreetly in his
hurried passion. "If it concerns the Princess Eleanora it
<i>is</i> of interest to me. So much you seem to know: speak,
then."</p>

<p>"I was dismissed the service of Prince Christian," said Gabor
deliberately, "because I was found speaking to the Princess
Eleanora&mdash;nay, rather because the Princess Eleanora spoke to
me&mdash;contrived to make an occasion, Sire, and spoke to
me."</p>

<p>"Spoke to you?" cried Leopold. "What is your meaning? Come to
it quick!"</p>

<p>"My meaning is, Sire," continued Gabor, in a hurried, low
tone, "the Princess Eleanora spoke to me about Your Majesty. She
begged me to step aside, to come with her into the woods, to walk
with her there, while she asked about Your Majesty. She had
discovered your identity from the Duchess, and she asked me why
you had ridden away&mdash;why you had not persevered in your suit
for her hand."</p>

<p>"She knew as much?" cried Leopold, aghast, absolutely off his
guard; "she knew as much as that?"</p>

<p>He had stepped at once into the trap that the astute
Transylvanian had set for his ingenuous simplicity.</p>

<p>"Yes, she knew as much as that, and she begged me to convey a
message to Your Majesty&mdash;to ask you to rescue her from her
marriage with Prince Christian of Kurland, a desperate, urgent,
personal message from a lady hemmed in and distressed."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" cried Leopold. "Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"It is very possible, Sire, but I was interrupted in the midst
of this frantic confidence. Prince Christian, suspecting that
there was no good to his interests in our conference, spied on
us, struck me and dismissed me. I had to fly from Dürsheim."</p>

<p>Leopold put his hand to his full trembling lips to smother a
fierce exclamation. All this was too late now; she was married;
two or three days ago married. He knew as much as that from
Hensdorff. What was the use of Gabor talking now?</p>

<p>And then he reflected, in his enormous bewilderment, that this
might be a trap&mdash;a trick; it seemed hardly likely that
Eleanora (simple as he knew her), would have so expressed herself
to a man like Gabor; and so he hesitated, biting his lips behind
his fingers, looking down on the ground, paling and then
flushing&mdash;an object for the scorn of the astute eyes of the
wily observer; pacing up and down the room, wondering and
debating, in his agitated and invaded heart. What could he do?
Anyhow, it was too late! And he repeated to himself those two
most fatal words: "Too late! Too late!"</p>

<p>"I thought," murmured Gabor, insidiously, "that your Imperial
Majesty would like to know that the Princess Eleanora has a
lively interest in you. She spoke of her prayers, of her hopes
for your success, fears for your possible failure; her whole
heart, her perpetual interest is yours, Sire!"</p>

<p>In this he went too far, as a coarse-grained man may go in
dealing with a fine personality; his contempt for all of them was
too apparent in his cringing tones.</p>

<p>Leopold turned on him, outraged and indignant.</p>

<p>"I believe none of this!" he said in a tone of sharp censure.
"And if it is true, you should not have repeated it to me. The
Princess Eleanora is the wife of Prince Christian, my
Commander-in-Chief; and I do not know what manner of mischief you
are trying to make with these base and vile insinuations. If you
were dismissed the service of the Prince of Kurland," he added,
with dignity, "I do not doubt he had his good and just reasons;
and they would none of them touch the name of the Princess
Eleanora."</p>

<p>Gabor was taken aback by this onslaught. He had, then, for all
his cleverness, ill estimated his man. He had not believed that
Leopold would take this tone; be so apt with the manner of
Caesar.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, then, does not credit my tale?" he asked; "I
have waited on you in the greatest soberness to relate to you
facts which I thought it would be to your advantage to hear, and
to your merit to consider. I am prone, supine in apology, in
regret."</p>

<p>"I will listen to none of it!" cried Leopold, violently, but
more agitated than became him. "I should not have seen you; I do
not know why Hensdorff suggested that I <i>should</i> see
you."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor caught at that complaint.</p>

<p>"Count Hensdorff suggested that Your Majesty should see me
because he can vouch for the truth of what I say. Question
<i>him</i> as to the attitude of the Princess Eleanora on the eve
of her forced marriage!"</p>

<p>"Forced?" stammered Leopold. "Forced?"</p>

<p>"She was forced," persisted Gabor. "Your Majesty rode away and
allowed her to be forced." He ventured that, he was reckless.</p>

<p>"No more of this!" cried Leopold, in extreme dismay. "You must
not mention these things, nor I listen to them. Prince Christian
is my General&mdash;the Commander-in-Chief of my Army; and behind
his back I cannot listen to gossip and scandal about him, and
from the mouth of his dismissed spy."</p>

<p>"Spy!" exclaimed Gabor, bitterly stung. "Did Your Majesty say
'spy'?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" retorted Leopold, his blue eyes dark with rage, "I said
'spy'! And get you gone, Prince Gabor! I have no place for you in
my service&mdash;not even in my service of the baser kind."</p>

<p>Gabor had not expected this defiance. He had thought that the
weak and flighty Leopold would be an easy prey to his intrigue; a
facile means to ruin Christian and Eleanora, one of whom had
insulted him and the other of whom had been the witness of that
insult; yes, it had not seemed difficult&mdash;the device of
snaring these three in their passions.</p>

<p>And now he stood, dark and amazed, looking with anger at the
Emperor.</p>

<p>"Get you gone!" cried Leopold trembling. "Never come into my
presence again. And keep those names off your lips. Remember, if
you speak of them, anywhere and anyhow, I shall hear of it; and
when I hear I shall punish."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," sneered Gabor, suavely, "carries matters with
a very high hand. All I have said, I have said out of a wish to
be of service to you. One of these days you may regret that you
so dismissed me. If such a day comes, send for me, and I may be
able to be of some use to you in your desires&mdash;your constant
desires, Sire!"</p>

<p>"Insolence!" cried Leopold, beside himself. "Insolence! Get
you gone, Prince Gabor, before I also strike you."</p>

<p>"No," smiled Gabor, his dark face very pale. "No!" he added,
bowing, "there will be no need for that. I, Sire, am gone. But I
do not think Your Majesty will be so easily able to forget what I
have said&mdash;the news I brought and the picture I have
evoked."</p>

<p>With that, he took himself gracefully from the room, bowing
again as he went backwards through the tall, open door into the
antechamber.</p>

<p>His bitter faded face did not change as he left the Hofburg,
but there were many changes in his heart. He had not relinquished
his scheme of revenge on Christian; but to the victims of that
scheme of revenge he had added the Emperor; he rolled that title
in mockery; Leopold and Christian should fall now, and fall
together, if one man's wish and endeavours could make them;
Eleanora, too, that artless chit, that frivolous puss who had
been the cause of all this trouble: she should share their common
ruin; all Gabor's world whirled into potent hatred of these
three.</p>

<p>Already he had lit on a scheme that promised fairly to ripen
to such an end; he thought that he could still catch these two
men, fool and knave, in the springs of their own lusts and in
this manner make them destroy each other. He was clever; he had
some influence and some friends; he did not fear failure; he was
experienced in this manner of intrigue, he knew all the devices
of vileness.</p>

<p>Power!</p>

<p>They shouted for power, that hysterical weakling who claimed a
throne, that flaunting base-born adventurer, but he could show
who had the power; it would be the most amusing as well as the
most gratifying thing he had ever accomplished to show them that,
to prove to them what common clay they were and that he was their
master, to snap his fingers at them and laugh in their faces at
the end of this ironic little comedy.</p>

<p>Gabor walked lightly through the noble streets of Vienna,
twisting towards the usual haunts of his kind, while his adroit
and clear mind dexterously put together, link by link, the chain
of circumstance that was to trip up and throw headlong the
objects of his cold, implacable hate.</p>

<p>There were many Hapsburg flags in the city, many emblazonings
of the Imperial Eagle; every time Gabor passed one of these he
saluted the haughty emblem with icy mockery.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">MARÉCHAL DE LISLE welcomed Christian at Prague
with every circumstance of respect and honour. He delighted to
put everything in the hands of the Imperial Commander-in-Chief,
and to defer to his judgment in every possible way. The Frenchman
augured success from the fact that Christian had now the control
of the fluctuating fortunes of Leopold, and looked forward with
confidence to the ensuing campaign.</p>

<p>The two soldiers had known and liked each other well in Paris;
they were friends of long standing, and Christian was at home
with the native graces of the Frenchman; graces that glossed over
all that was unpleasant, notably General Crack's own birth; that
incurable wound the Germans always must probe.</p>

<p>There was never any hint, when he was in the company of De
Lisle or the other French General, that he was any other than
what, on the surface, he purported to be: a Prince, of unstained
lineage, pure descent and blotless birth. They all gave him full
honours, without any secret innuendoes, smile or sneer; he was in
every way at home among the French; by education and taste
himself a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Rapidity was the very heart of his plans, and he decided not
to wait for Leopold, who lingered on the way from
Vienna&mdash;as, Christian thought, he would always linger on the
way from anywhere to anywhere. It was hardly in His Majesty's
disposition to come directly to a given point.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff had sent despatches, declaring the Emperor was
on the way; but still he did not arrive, and weeks had gone by
since Christian and his troop of Uhlans had left Ottenheim for
their swift march to Prague.</p>

<p>It was true that the Allies had not moved either, and seemed
most sluggish and reluctant to do so; it was true that Christian
had been able to work in many other ways&mdash;he had raised
considerable levies, manoeuvred large bodies of troops, and kept
up communication with all the other Imperial generals: Spanish,
Austrian, French and Italian.</p>

<p>But he wished to do more than this: he wished to make a
definite advance on the Allied lines, and attack those great
fortresses which protected the line of the Marne. Linz was with
him, eager to be at work.</p>

<p>Christian was impatient to be at Brussels and Frankfurt, to
see the crown put on Leopold's head; he was impatient to flick
the Allies away from his path, impatient to be back at Ottenheim
with Eleanora and the spring.</p>

<p>She had not written, and he was not for that greatly
disappointed. He lived in his dreams&mdash;his ravishing dreams
of the future. He could afford to wait: to wait yet longer; but
not too long. And as the days passed one into another, he became
more and more impatient that Leopold did not arrive in
Prague.</p>

<p>"Advance without him!" suggested De Lisle; although he knew
that this was a bad precedent, and most disheartening to the
troops, as well as heartening to their enemies. "Surely Your
Highness is sufficient; these men do not know or love Leopold.
None of them, save the Bavarians, will miss him. In his father's
lifetime he was not greatly regarded, nor do I think that he will
make much of a reputation as a soldier."</p>

<p>"He will make a show," urged Christian; "he will be
there&mdash;the Emperor, the symbol of what they are fighting
for. I," he added with a smile, "am, after all, but a mercenary
commander; a hired soldier, and not the man for whom these troops
must shout."</p>

<p>"But why does he daily?" asked the Frenchman; and Christian
wondered indeed why; he knew that Leopold was averse to camps and
of no martial disposition, but it was hard to understand why he
should linger in his distant capital, when all his fortunes were
at stake on the front of war.</p>

<p>Christian had not thought the Bavarian without pride and
dignity; Hensdorff's excuses were hollow. He said that Leopold
was ill; that the Archduchess was ill; that the heat was great in
the capital; that the plague was rife; and such trivial evasions
of the central fact that Leopold did not come to Prague.</p>

<p>The Princes and Electors gathered there began to comment upon
his absence; not that they cared much, as long as Christian was
in command, but they were inclined to feel themselves slighted.
If they thought it worth while to come to Prague to meet Leopold,
they thought he should have felt it worth his while to come to
meet them.</p>

<p>Christian, so prompt and so energetic, so full of superb
self-confidence, giving evidence every day of his powerful mind
and his habit of full and supreme command, gained all the respect
and admiration that Leopold missed while he stayed away; with the
men, he had always been popular; and he now became, if not
popular with the Princes, at least an object of their trust and
confidence. Even the Germans were able to forget the slur upon
his birth in trusting to his good qualities, his good fortune,
and the obvious brilliancy of his destiny, to which they had now
so definitely linked their various destinies.</p>

<p>Prince Frederic of Anhalt-Dessau, in particular, was pleased
that he had attached himself to this triumphantly successful man,
and wrote not infrequently to Eleanora, telling her how fortunate
she was in such a husband, and bidding her send dutiful epistles
to Prague. He was irritated that no heed was taken of his
command, but appeased when the Duchess wrote and said that
Eleanora was not wilful or sulky, but merely shy, and had
attempted several letters to her husband which she had torn
up.</p>

<p>"She has been trained, you know," the Duchess wrote, "in much;
but never how to address a husband&mdash;or, indeed, any man. You
kept her, you will remember, like a schoolgirl, and you must not
be surprised if like a schoolgirl she now behaves."</p>

<p>Anhalt-Dessau would have liked to take these excuses to
Christian, but as that Prince never mentioned his wife,
Anhalt-Dessau did not care to do so either; Eleanora was never
named between them. But Christian always treated his
father-in-law with a fine, if cold, deference&mdash;with an
obvious, if mannered, respect.</p>

<p>By October he had mapped out every detail of the coming
campaign; every detail of the coming battle. He was in touch with
all the garrisons; he only waited for Olivenza and Guastalla to
come up from Italy, to begin his movements, for though his very
active, able and audacious preparations were now complete he
wanted the Italian troops who still lingered so unaccountably on
the way. He and De Lisle had resolved that Guastalla and Olivenza
should, under one excuse or another, be dismissed their important
commands when they reached Prague, so dilatory and languid had
been their progress from Lombardy. They had under their command
some of the best troops at the disposal of Leopold&mdash;the
Black Cuirassiers, the Spanish Veterans, the Croats, and many of
the heavy North Italian Cavalry.</p>

<p>"This is the pitch to which things have got," declared
Christian at a Council of War. "These generals do not care
whether they obey orders or no. For so long everything has been
slackened that they do not ever believe it can be tightened
again. But I, gentlemen, will wait no longer. I intend to advance
on the enemies' lines. It is obvious that they hope to escape
this season without any definite action, and to go into winter
quarters avoiding battle, in the hope of another futile
conference to amuse the winter months; and, in the spring, some
manner of patched-up peace. But this is not my wish, nor, I
think, gentlemen, yours. We want prompt action, and everything
settled now and forever. Or," he added, with irony for his own
statement, "if not forever, at least for a month or so."</p>

<p>He put before them his brief plan of campaign.</p>

<p>"The plan of campaign demands a superiority of troops on our
part, the presence of the Emperor will augment this force; as the
enemy is on the defensive and must keep his forts well garrisoned
he will not be able to put many men into the field. I must insist
on as much cavalry as possible&mdash;all the movements of the
troops must be regulated by the date at the general rendezvous at
Tournay, where the Emperor will go by November 1; on the second a
troop of cavalry will advance towards Mons, another towards Saint
Ghislain; on the third, the Emperor, encamped at Maubeuge, will
in two movements reach the river, where the bridges will have
been prepared on the second; on the fourth Tournay will be
invested; the heavy artillery will leave Douai on the fourth to
arrive, the same day, at the park before Tournay; the heavy
equipages of the Emperor will pass by Valenciennes and arrive on
the sixth before Tournay, where the Emperor will establish his
general quarters on the left of the Scheldt...<i>resolutions</i>
to take Ath and Mons, keys of the Low Countries; these two places
cannot hold out longer than seventeen to eighteen days&mdash;the
first twelve or thirteen, the second three or five. I know both
well, particularly Mons, where I was besieged four years ago; Ath
I relieved with fifteen hundred men, under the orders of M. le
Maréchal de Dauvet after the affair of Winterfeldt...</p>

<p>"Mons, Tournay and Ath reduced, there will easily follow
Quesnoy, Landrecies, Philippeville...Brabant will submit...one
must note that there is only ten leagues from Mons to
Brussels...needless to besiege Oudenarde as the Imperial Forces
will occupy the Low Countries&mdash;these forts will surrender
without a shot...as to Charleroi and Namur, it is not necessary
to beleaguer them&mdash;they will be cut off and our line of
communication solid forever; to keep their garrisons in order
three posts will be needful, at Soignies, at Braine-le-Comte, at
Notre Dame de Halle, occupied by grenadiers, dragoons and
hussars.</p>

<p>"Nymwegen, absolutely the key of Holland, is only eleven miles
from Utrecht, which is unfortified."</p>

<p>The Frenchmen warmly agreed; they also did not wish to go into
winter quarters without having furthered the Imperial Cause; the
war had dragged on long enough, from their point of view; long,
ponderous campaigns had been followed by long, dreary winters in
foreign cities. They were anxious to have the whole dispute done
with, and to be able to return to Paris. Prague, Brussels, even
Vienna&mdash;these were provincial cities to the Frenchmen, and
they were weary of them.</p>

<p>Christian had now, encamped outside the walls of Prague, in an
entrenchment four miles square, over a hundred thousand troops,
besides the garrisons in the city; and he believed that this was
a sufficient force with which to march upon the enemy, who,
sluggish and doubtful, would not be prepared to meet him. They
believed that his plan was the same as theirs&mdash;to daily and
linger till the winter weather became too severe for the troops
to remain in the field. Too severe for the Allies, perhaps; but
Christian intended to fight through the winter.</p>

<p>It was, then, agreed to advance by forced marches on Dresden,
then heavily garrisoned by Knittelfeldt for the Elector of
Saxony. From Dresden, Anhalt-Dessau was to advance to his own
little principality, and put that in a position of defence, while
Christian's troops were to divide&mdash;some to go on to Berlin
and some to stretch out at the left to Westphalia, Hanover,
Nassau and the Palatinate; and so face the Allies on their own
frontiers.</p>

<p>Fürth was holding the Palatinate with a considerable force,
but he had lately sent to ask for reinforcements, and Christian
was anxious above everything that he should have them. He was a
long way from the main body of the army, and the position was
most important; and though Christian did not think that the
Allies would make any active attempt to dislodge him, he did not
wish the Palatinate to be for a moment in jeopardy; nor did he
greatly trust General Fürth.</p>

<p>On the eve of the departure of the Imperialists from Prague,
Leopold came up from Vienna with Count Hensdorff and a small
escort.</p>

<p>Prince Christian was glad to see him, and the two men met with
every appearance of friendship and amiable courtesy in a room of
the noble house where Leopold lodged. Christian, as a matter of
form, coolly explained to His Majesty all his plans and all his
preparations, asking, with a courteous indifference, if all this
was agreeable to Imperial desires.</p>

<p>"The final decision," he added, "rests, of course, with Your
Majesty."</p>

<p>And Leopold gave no hint that he saw the irony behind these
words&mdash;no sign that he knew he was indeed a puppet in the
hands of Hensdorff and of Christian, his able minister and his
brilliant general.</p>

<p>Gravely he approved, gravely he commented; and at the finish
declared himself, in conventional language, well satisfied with
the industry and the genius of his Commander-in-Chief, with the
superb organization of his troops, and with the dashing courage
and magnificent sweep of the proposed daring, bold and yet
prudent campaign suggested to him in those few dry words.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said Christian as if he commanded, "will no
doubt wish to accompany the army. We had hoped for your presence
sooner in Prague."</p>

<p>"I hope that has not delayed you," replied Leopold, with
smiling coldness; "I have been indisposed, and so has the
Archduchess. It was impossible for me to leave the capital
sooner." He could not forbear finishing his sentence by saying:
"I do not believe Your Highness has found my absence a very great
drawback to the progress of your plans."</p>

<p>"No," replied Christian; "I have indeed been waiting for other
things&mdash;for Guastalla and Olivenza to come up from Italy;
they are an unaccountable time on the road, and I shall not delay
any longer for them, but proceed at once to Dresden and Berlin,
as here"&mdash;and he touched the papers between them&mdash;"I
have pointed out to Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Leopold inclined his head; there was no more to be said. But
he did not dismiss Christian, but stood looking at him
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>For days Leopold had been dreading this interview, and he had
only put it through by a strong effort of will; Christian could
not guess what he had endured at Vienna, nor what it had cost
Hensdorff and Father St. Nikola to urge him on this journey to
Prague, to force him to take up the place they had decided he
must fill.</p>

<p>He would have resigned, as he had often threatened to resign,
if he could have thought of any other means of living, of any
possible retreat from the tumult of his grand and miserable life.
But there was nowhere; he had remembered the monastery at Mölk,
as he had remembered the hermit's grotto above the ravine on the
Danube; and he had remembered both with despair. Not in these
places was any retreat to be found; he found that it was true
enough that he who has not the courage to carry on his life in
its appointed place has not the courage to escape. Much better to
go on with some show of fortitude than wretchedly to desert. The
Archduchess, too, had pleaded with him feverishly. She had asked
him what <i>her</i> fate would be if he should resign the Crown.
They had not Bavaria to which to retire; that was in the hands of
the enemy. And if he deserted the cause of the French and the
Imperialists, would they wrench back Bavaria for them? No! He
could not resign from the Imperial purple to take up the robes of
the Elector of Bavaria! He would be nothing&mdash;a mere,
wandering adventurer; and what would <i>she</i> be, the delicate
woman had asked. She who now had no father or mother&mdash;no
other relatives; for whom there was no husband, no protector in
prospect. What would she be, if she was not the Archduchess Maria
Luisa, the sister of the Emperor?</p>

<p>And it had seemed to Leopold that he could not think of
resigning till, at least, he had provided for her; while she and
her fortunes were dependent on him, he was not free; and so he
had finally, and after infinite pain and inward struggles, braced
himself to play his part, and here he was now in this dark alien
room in Prague, facing Christian; in his handsome uniform, all
besilvered and bespangled with gold and silver cord, with stars
and medals and silken sashes, with his hat plumed and set
jauntily, with his side curls powdered and one of the crown
diamonds, a solitaire, in his black ribbon: here he was playing
the Emperor, and trying to stare down Christian of Kurland, who
looked at him with that inscrutable, mask-like, too handsome face
which he had learned to know and hate so well.</p>

<p>He felt confidence enough in the superb and insolent soldier;
no doubt Christian would set him on the throne&mdash;no doubt he
would have to give him Kurland and other places as a reward, as
well as the reward he had already given him. And still he stared
at Christian, not dismissing him, but allowing him to stand
there, bareheaded, superb and indifferent, awaiting his
pleasure.</p>

<p>If he was the master, or going to pretend to be the master, to
play the part of master, at least he would sometimes have a
master's privileges; and so he stood there, making Christian wait
his command.</p>

<p>And then Christian spoke, in his soft voice, with his very
courtly air:</p>

<p>"I hope Your Majesty left the Archduchess recovered of her
sickness?" he asked; he too stared.</p>

<p>And Leopold flushed; it seemed to him an insolence for
Christian to take this name in his speech; and he answered,
stiffly:</p>

<p>"Her Highness is very well, I thank you." And, as a
counterthrust, he added, haughtily: "You have left the Princess
Eleanora safe in Ottenheim?"</p>

<p>He had not thought that he would have been able to mention
this name, but, because Christian had spoken of his sister, the
sister he had slighted and refused, Leopold found it easy to
mention Eleanora, a name that had been continuously in his heart,
but not on his lips since the day he had ridden away from the
Château of Schönbuchel in Dürsheim.</p>

<p>"She is well and safe," replied Christian; "I have frequent
news of her."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Leopold, "when you write again, that I
remember my brief visit to Dürsheim; and beg her to accept my
humble duties. I did not yet send her a wedding gift, but that
shall not be forgotten."</p>

<p>He spoke, not only in defiance of Christian, but in defiance
of himself, of his own pain and shame and remorse, of his own
bitter and insistent memories.</p>

<p>But Christian knew nothing of this; he was unaware that
Eleanora meant anything to Leopold&mdash;that she ever had meant
anything but a pawn in the game he was playing. There had been
many rumours as to the probable marriage of the Emperor; many
women's names had been mentioned, and most people had forgotten
by now that one of the first of these names, only a few weeks
ago, had been that of Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau: so quickly does
time pass in intrigue and war, when men's minds are disturbed by
increasing tumult of heavy events.</p>

<p>Christian, of course, remembered, but attached no importance
to the memory. He thought that Leopold spoke so because he meant
to flatter him, and bowed, accepting the flattery as part of the
bargain between him and Leopold of Bavaria.</p>

<p>"Will Your Majesty review the troops to-morrow?" he asked. "I
wish to start immediately."</p>

<p>"I think there is no need for me to review them," answered
Leopold, icily, "since no doubt Your Highness has done so."</p>

<p>"There is every need for Your Majesty to show yourself to the
men," said Christian, "and I shall be greatly indebted if you
will review them to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>It was more like a command than a request, and so Leopold took
it. But still he would not say "Yes" and dismiss Christian, but
kept him standing there, staring him down.</p>

<p>Leopold made a fine figure now; his essential weakness was
disguised; he looked handsome, imposing, grand, in all the
cunning and judicious fripperies of his array; in all the glitter
of his stars and orders, in the sparkle of the diamonds on his
sword-hilt, at his throat and on his bosom. If he was not an
emperor, he made a very good symbol of an emperor; a show, a
pageant, enough to satisfy the unthinking. And so Christian
regarded him, and with indifferent approval; he had no feeling
for Leopold but one of friendly contempt. He was quite unaware
that Leopold hated him; and he was incapable of hating Leopold;
but he could not resist a faint smile that broke his famous
composure when Leopold asked him to come to his table that night
for supper. For he remembered the day in Belgrade, at the camp,
when Leopold, then only King of the Romans, had invited all the
other generals to his tent and omitted Prince Christian of
Kurland. Now he was not only asked, but asked as if acceptance
would be an honour.</p>

<p>Leopold saw that smile, and knew what it meant; and he smiled
too, to cover his humiliation.</p>

<p>"At supper we will talk further, Your Highness," he remarked.
"No doubt you will like to speak to Count Hensdorff. He keeps
public affairs better in mind than I can do; he is my memory and
my conscience, Highness; as such regard him."</p>

<p>"An able and a courageous man," said Christian. "I respect
Count Hensdorff; and in matters of politics, for which I care, as
a rule, not a fig, I shall put myself unreservedly in his hands.
Your Majesty, no doubt, does not care to be fatigued with such
prosaic details."</p>

<p>And Leopold could not yet let him go, but must stand there and
gaze at him, and reconstruct in his mind that scene that Gabor
had told him&mdash;the Princess Eleanora speaking to the
Transylvanian, under those beech trees where he had seen her with
her strawberry basket and her dreams, between those hornbeam
hedges at Dürsheim, in the mellow evening sunshine; speaking to
the Transylvanian, and appealing to him against her fate; against
Christian, this man who stood here now so grand, so impressive,
so cool and splendid. And, dwelling on that scene as Gabor had
told it to him, he could not resist asking:</p>

<p>"Is it true that you have dismissed from your service the
Transylvanian, Ferdinand Gabor?"</p>

<p>Christian was taken by surprise; but he was well schooled in
never showing surprise, and he answered indifferently: "Sire, it
is quite true. I found him to be a villain."</p>

<p>"But I thought," said Leopold, "that you had always known him
to be a villain."</p>

<p>"Some sort of a villain, no doubt," agreed Christian; "but I
found him to be a villain in another manner&mdash;an intolerable
one to me, Your Majesty. Yes, I have dismissed him."</p>

<p>"And he came to me in Vienna and wished to have
employment."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty might do worse than give it him," smiled
Christian; "he is a most useful, subtle and adroit manner of
scoundrel, and well versed in all kinds of intrigue."</p>

<p>"I refused him," remarked Leopold, coldly, "because he spoke
ill of you."</p>

<p>Christian was again surprised, and again did not show
surprise.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is very courteous," he replied. "But for me, I
take no account of what dismissed servants may say."</p>

<p>"I took no account either, and therefore did not engage him;
but I wondered what his offence had been."</p>

<p>"He did not tell you, I suppose?" asked Christian.</p>

<p>"He merely said that you had struck him," answered Leopold.
"Impossible, surely, but he said you had struck him."</p>

<p>"And so I did strike him," said Christian, coolly; "but for
what reason I have forgot."</p>

<p>And they stared at each other across the darkening room,
where, in the stillness, was a sense of mute gathering
conflict.</p>

<p>"I have forgot," repeated Christian, "and let not Your Majesty
trouble your mind about such a detail as Gabor."</p>

<p>He spoke now with some meaning, and Leopold believed he knew
what was behind this speech, and that on his lips was the name of
Eleanora; on his lips and in his heart, but never to be breathed
or spoken between them. It was impossible for him, Leopold, to
get behind the guard of a man like this. He must go on; play his
part and wait his time.</p>

<p>At last he dismissed Christian, saying:</p>

<p>"I am sure Your Highness has many affairs to attend to; and as
for me, I will rest a little, having," he added, with bitter
irony, "nothing else to do."</p>

<p>When Christian had left him, he stood motionless in his
tricked-up magnificence, staring at the spot where Christian had
faced him, as if he still defied that resplendent figure.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">PRINCE GABOR leaned from an upper window in a
main street in Berlin, and watched the gaudy, transient stars of
the fireworks break among the clear, immortal planets. The night
was brilliant, flushed with the first frost of the winter; Gabor
was glad of the cool, sweet air on his face. He had been smoking
and drinking all day; his attire was dishevelled. Though
ironically decorous in public, often in private he amused himself
with low debaucheries. Though dismissed from the service of
Christian, and rejected by Leopold, he had found work, and
congenial work, with Count Hensdorff, who could not bring himself
to reject the services of one so able, in his own peculiar way,
as Ferdinand Gabor. It was largely owing to his underground
influence and subtle intrigue that the King of Prussia had been
induced to support the Imperial cause; and with him had come a
whole train of lesser German potentates to strengthen the army of
Leopold.</p>

<p>The name and prestige of General Crack, the soldier who had
never lost a battle nor failed to take a town, had rendered
Gabor's task an easy one. All the German princelings were eager
to be on the winning side, and they believed that the winning
side would be that championed by Christian. Also, they were much
impressed and flattered by his joining the Lutheran faith and
marrying the heiress to so many of their admired dignities.</p>

<p>Yet, without Gabor and his spies and agents, the work would
have been longer. He had been of considerable value to Hensdorff;
but Hensdorff had had to keep his services secret, knowing that
he was out of favour with Leopold and in disgrace with Christian.
The reason of these double dislikes Hensdorff did not enquire
into; he accepted them with a shrug and a sneer. Christian could
be violent, and Leopold was capricious; Hensdorff was neither: he
took any instrument for any end, as it suited his judgment and
his aims.</p>

<p>Gabor was well paid, both to do his work and to keep in the
background. He lounged now from the upper window, feeling that
the triumphs of this evening were largely due to his endeavours.
Without him&mdash;the concealed, the despised man&mdash;this
triumph would have lost something of its gloss.</p>

<p>A pageantry was passing through the narrow street below, a
street picked out into fantastic shapes by the crossing of lights
and shadows; lights of lanterns, of flambeaux, of torches, of
fireworks; shadows of houses, of people, of masses of people
passing to and fro, in and out alley and square. Gabor, from his
high-placed gable, could see over the town, black spires rising
into the falsely illuminated gloom of the night. He liked to see
the rockets swing up, break and expire; he thought of General
Crack as he stared sarcastically at the vault of the heavens,
where these transient glories of sparkling colour so brightly
flashed and so immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>The Imperial Forces were entering the capital of Prussia with
all the splendour of a royal welcome. Gabor could see them
passing below. There was all the clatter and bravery of the
Uhlans and Cuirassiers, the Poles and Saxons, the Kurlanders and
Pomeranians; all the bold, wanton train of them, flushed with
hope, almost with certainty of success; proud and impatient, they
passed between the narrow houses with mean-lit windows. The King
of Prussia was there, with his own picked troops; a slight young
man, who stooped, whose uniform wrinkled on his shoulders, who
made no great show. A cleverer man, though, thought Gabor, than
either Leopold or Christian, or even Hensdorff; a reddish, foxy
slip of a man, with his eye on success.</p>

<p>"What a show!" sneered Gabor, hanging out of the window with
his pipe in his mouth. "What a show even a poor laggard fool can
make with stars and crosses and ribbons, bedecked, besilvered and
adorned!" He spoke of Leopold, who rode on a great white horse,
and held himself with an air of rigorous pride.</p>

<p>The young man achieved, indeed, an Imperial appearance in his
showy uniform, his beplumed hat, the stars that glittered on his
breast&mdash;in the whole magnificence of the collar of The
Golden Fleece, his silken sashes, the imposing appointments that
adorned his graceful youth, he made a figure to impress the
populace.</p>

<p>Leopold was affable, too; he had those easy and pleasant
graces that never fail to receive a vague but general admiration.
Both the people of the baser sort gathered in the street and
those who looked from adorned windows admired the young Emperor,
who knew how to beam elegantly from his saddle, and smile and
salute; whose blue eyes looked with amiable majesty at the
adoring crowd, whose face was so elegant and comely, whose
blushes did not unbecome his manly modesty.</p>

<p>He rode before a troop of resplendent horsemen; nothing was
lacking to give the extreme of glittering pomp to his retinue; he
seemed himself elated by the glories that surrounded him&mdash;as
if he were already a conqueror, already robed and crowned at
Frankfurt or Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>"Ay!" sneered Gabor, as he watched the noble and charming
figure disappear into the interlaced shadows of the prepared
road, "ay! To-day you seem the sum of all the graces. You are a
brave show to make the people shout; but to-morrow, and the day
after to-morrow, and next week, my fine young man&mdash;"</p>

<p>He folded his arms on the window sill, and smiled to
himself&mdash;smiled with real pleasure and satisfaction, not in
the contemplation of all this careful and imposing pomp, but in
the thought of how soon it would be snuffed out like a smear of
dust, which is all that is left from a pinched candle flame.
Behind Leopold rode Prince Christian, at the head of his own
Uhlans. Keenly Gabor gazed at that familiar and now loathed
figure; in this hour of outward triumph, Christian appeared the
same as he had appeared in his choicest, quietest
leisure&mdash;unmoved and unregardful of anything but his own
pride; how Gabor detested that pose, so difficultly achieved, so
carefully maintained! General Crack appeared a man without
passions; Gabor, who knew so differently, hated him for the mute
arrogance with which he preserved his cold equanimity.</p>

<p>Beneath those cold, frosty skies, gemmed with planets and
flared with fireworks, which rose above the dark steeples and the
clustered gables, General Crack rode. Gabor noted the precise
neatness of his appearance&mdash;the trim coat, the exact cravat,
the carefully arranged scarves and badges, the glittering of the
foreign orders on his breast, the tassels of his gloves, the
exact fit of his boots, all the gleams and polish and wrought
delicacies of his horse's harness.</p>

<p>"How many hours have you spent with the tailor and the
barber?" sneered Gabor. "And to what end, eh? All this careful
parade is but so much lavish waste to hide the man you are. But I
will make you betray yourself!"</p>

<p>He leant far out on the window ledge and for a brief second's
space he saw the countenance of Christian turn upwards, attracted
by some glare in an upper window&mdash;by some delicate voice,
some woman's voice, acclaiming him; and Gabor looked down at him,
at the dark, cold face, so precisely set off by plume and
curl.</p>

<p>"I'll blast your shining face," he smiled; "I'll blast it for
you!"</p>

<p>General Crack rode on indifferently. He had not seen
Gabor&mdash;was not thinking of Gabor nor likely to think of him
again. To him this was all nothing but a marking of time; he was
eager to be in action. His reception in Berlin was but an episode
on the way. He glanced round carelessly, and heard the people
shouting for Leopold, and he was gratified. This was part of his
task&mdash;to make people shout for Leopold. And with the same
calm indifference he regarded the figure riding ahead of him, and
approved that agreeable display. Hensdorff had taken his advice;
Leopold was making an Imperial appearance; that was all that
Christian asked.</p>

<p>The rest he could leave, he believed, to his own well-tuned
destiny. He rode on out of the sight of Gabor, and soon all the
soldiers had passed, and left the street empty.</p>

<p>But the fireworks continued to rise from the market square,
and Gabor remained at his window, watching these, flying up high,
making their brief and violent display of clustered blue and
purple constellations, then vanishing into nothingness.</p>

<p>Prince Gabor had, with a cold heart and an unscrupulous mind,
a great deal of subtlety and delicacy in his perceptions. He
could judge&mdash;more than judge, he could understand&mdash;the
finest feelings of better men than himself, feelings that he
despised. He could read Christian. He remembered Eleanora in the
woods at Dürsheim&mdash;how soft and warm and foolish that girl,
with her knot of light hair, her frail muslin bodice straining
across her bosom; a muslin bodice so easily unlaced, a knot of
light hair so easily tumbled down!</p>

<p>Almost he had, cold and jaded as he was, almost he had desired
her himself, as both Christian and Leopold had desired her; he
knew that now; it had been underlying his pursuit of her, his
compliments, his bowings and bendings, his insinuations into her
confidence; and she had felt it, and drawn back&mdash;felt it
without knowing what it was. Well, Christian held her now. Gabor
thought of that, and licked his lip where there was a little scar
where Christian had struck him: struck him in front of her; he
could remember her face, her expression of horror and contempt.
She had seen him struck; well, she would see some one else
struck: Gabor meant to bring them both down; he revelled in the
sense of power that thought gave him&mdash;to bring them both
down.</p>

<p>He was an adept at procuring information by backstair means;
following with Hensdorff in the train of Leopold and Christian,
unseen by them but always spying on them, he knew pretty well
both the actions and the mind of his late employer.</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann had told him something; Lippmann was never
averse to gossip. He had found out things from servants, even
from Christian's servants. The girl had been left alone on her
bridal night. Christian had visited her; yes, for half an hour,
fully dressed in his uniform, all but his sword and belt; he had
given her the green diamond called Mitau and left her, not
disturbing her maiden heart by any declarations of love, not
troubling her untarnished fidelity with any protestations of
faith. His wish had been short of his desire; wrapped in
fantastical dreams of love, he had left love itself to slumber
till the appointed time, hoarding up in his heart the
anticipation of all life's sweet pleasure to come; waiting until
he had the leisure to rouse in his lady mutual answering
fires.</p>

<p>Gabor could understand all this; understand the fineness and
delicacy of the inmost recesses of Christian's soul: those costly
diamonds, and the leaving of her...</p>

<p>"He'll win the war and go back to her," sneered Gabor; "he's
to fight and conquer, and she, his best of dears, is to wait for
him. How much would Leopold give to know that&mdash;that she is
there, a maiden, waiting for love! That would give his pride's
aspiring some good object for its goal! That would enlarge his
narrow wish&mdash;to think that sparkling beauty waits for his
gathering."</p>

<p>A little chill wind blew out of the brilliant night sky, and
fanned the heated forehead of Gabor. He put out his hands as if
this wind were a substance, and he could weigh it in his
palm.</p>

<p>"Light wind, light air," he smiled, "and her heart more light
than either! What will she do in Ottenheim? It will not be of
Christian she will think. It was that fair fool that took her
fancy."</p>

<p>Gabor yawned and stretched; then, dishevelled as he was, went
down into the town, where all the houses were lit, where all the
people were lively and excited by the entry of the Imperial Army;
by the gathering in their city of so many notables, by the
presence of the Emperor himself.</p>

<p>Everywhere there were flags and wreaths, and still the rockets
rose from the market place. Gabor went to the palace, to the back
door, where he <i>always</i> found ready admittance in any
palace; he had his agents everywhere. How excited every one was!
How they boasted and shouted!</p>

<p>"The campaign is not begun yet," remarked Gabor. He sought out
Banning, who had kept on good terms with one who might be either
useful or very dangerous, according to the case. Banning did not
know or care why he had been disgraced; it was not so unusual for
Christian to dismiss his attendants or to change his
officers.</p>

<p>The Swede was elated by the pomp and splendour of the entry
into Berlin, by this notable gathering of all the potentates that
had come to serve under the Eagles, and again Gabor sneered:</p>

<p>"The campaign is not yet begun."</p>

<p>"But we know," grinned Banning, "how it will end."</p>

<p>"I wonder," remarked Gabor, "if you do!"</p>

<p>He turned the conversation onto Princess Christian, as he
spitefully named Eleanora.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he bring her here? Other women are
flocking&mdash;the Archduchess Maria Luisa and the Countess
Carola Borgonie, they are coming to-morrow, I hear&mdash;agog for
the show."</p>

<p>"He keeps her apart," smiled Banning; "he keeps her for
himself. She is for him alone, you understand, not even to be
glimpsed from common eyes."</p>

<p>"He did not use to be so nice," commented Gabor, ironically.
"This lady seems to have fairly caught him."</p>

<p>The Swede answered that he could see very little in his
master's wife. She seemed to him a foolish little
thing&mdash;just plump and pretty, and no more; scared if you
looked at her. "Not the sort of creature that you would expect a
man like Christian to pay such a price for, eh?"</p>

<p>And they gossiped about her and about Christian, going over
his leaving of her in Ottenheim, the installation of the old
Duchess, the altering of the apartments, the taking away of the
pictures of seductive ladies and coquettish nymphs; and they
laughed and mocked together at the forbearance of Christian
towards this treasured prize.</p>

<p>Banning coarsely put down Christian as a man besotted and
infatuate; but Gabor, with his more subtle conceptions, knew
better. He could enter into all the involved delicacies of
Christian's behaviour; but he pretended that he took Banning's
point of view, and jeered crudely at the behaviour of the man he
detested, for this gave him a certain pleasure.</p>

<p>"They are banqueting now," remarked Banning, "he and Leopold,
under a canopy, he with the Emperor on one side and the King of
Prussia on the other. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I say," replied Gabor, "that it must be a very amusing
spectacle."</p>

<p>Presently, when it was late in the festival, Gabor crept into
the music gallery of the banqueting room, unobserved in his plain
civilian dress behind the liveried musicians of the King of
Prussia; the continuous light music fell like a veil between him
and the scene in the spick, new, brilliant room below; yes, there
they were under the dais, glittering together, surrounded by
gorging, flushed princes. Gabor's sharp scrutiny observed some
dispatches handed to a lackey at the door, passed from hand to
hand and finally reaching Leopold, where he was pledging his
Allies, rising, with his glass in his hand. Leopold nervously
tore open the letters and had not sufficient self-control to
conceal the disastrous contents; he read a passage aloud. In a
second it was round the room that the Emperor had received bad
news; in a moment it was round the room that both Guastalla and
Olivenza had been defeated, one by the Hungarians, the other by
the English. Gabor, standing secretly in the recesses behind the
muted orchestra, rubbed his hands and licked his lips.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>

<p class="first">LEOPOLD stood at bay, with the fatal dispatches
in his hand; the moment had utterly overwhelmed him; his
humiliation was extreme. He was abashed, not so much by the
extent of the disaster, as by his own powerlessness to meet this
same disaster. From the first moment that the papers had been put
into his hands he had done the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Already agitated, and at the limit of nervous tension, he had
not possessed the presence of mind to glance at the news and put
the dispatches in his pocket, setting aside with a smile the
disastrous communications until a proper moment for their
revelation to the proper people.</p>

<p>"This news would have kept," the King of Prussia had remarked,
more angry with Leopold's reception of the letters than with what
the letters had contained. To every one Leopold had betrayed his
essential weakness; he felt sick and disheartened; he did not
know what to say or do to put a gloss upon this ugly moment. He
glanced round at consternated and vexed faces; he heard disturbed
mutterings and scornful whisperings; he looked at Hensdorff and
saw the gloom upon that minister's tired countenance; he looked
at his Commander-in-Chief and saw the soldier's superb, supreme
indifference, which seemed to mask a faint amusement, for
Christian sat immobile&mdash;his expression had not changed; he
offered no comment; he alone, of all about the sumptuous table,
had nothing to say; his fine hands played with the sparkling stem
of his wineglass, but he drank no wine.</p>

<p>A pause; Leopold began to stammer. Half turning in his seat,
he tried to make excuses to the King of Prussia, who was making
his bread into pellets and nervously flicking them across the
tablecloth.</p>

<p>"Guastalla and Olivenza both?" murmured Leopold. "This takes
me by surprise."</p>

<p>"Whom, Sire," asked the King of Prussia, "are those dispatches
from? Strange that you should get ill news," he added, with a wry
smile, "in this double dose!"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Leopold, confusedly. "I will recall
the messenger."</p>

<p>But the King of Prussia interposed:</p>

<p>"Surely, Sire, we have had enough of this for the moment," he
suggested grimly. "The rest of the matter may wait till we have
finished our dinner."</p>

<p>Leopold blushed, and loathed himself for blushing; he had been
rebuked by the King of Prussia&mdash;he, the Emperor! The moment
was bitter on his lips; the flavour was acrid in his nostrils; he
cast his eyes down; the glitter and sparkle of The Golden Fleece
and the diamonds and gold stars and crosses on his bosom further
vexed and humiliated him; he felt a painted puppet, for all men
to stare and mock at; the fringes of the purple canopy, even the
gilded Imperial Crown above them, seemed to him like so many
ridiculous, trifling toys, set up to bait him. And, apart from
this sense of personal failure, even of personal degradation, his
mind was full of the ghastly pictures evoked by those brief
lines.</p>

<p>"Cut to pieces like sheep," one of the sentences read. And
Leopold could not think Imperially; he could not think of the
loss to the cause or to the Empire; his fastidious mind must go
over the horrible details of slaughtered men, even of slaughtered
horses; of all those dead and dying, maimed and stricken, calling
out against him, cursing him for whom they died...The dark
picture haunted him, oppressed him, even more than those
disturbed and slightly contemptuous faces of all his generals,
marshals and princes there gathered to condemn his folly and his
weakness.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia lapsed into silence, his narrow face
overcast; he had nothing more to say to the Emperor; but he was
thinking rapidly.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff spoke to the man next him, talking about the
inefficiency of Guastalla, of the incompetence of Olivenza; then
the King of Prussia, rousing himself from sour reflection as to
whether or no he had, after all, chosen the wrong side, made an
angry signal for the orchestra to recommence; and from the
musicians' gallery, where Gabor in his shadow watched and mocked,
floated out a thin, melting dance melody across the low hubbub of
agitated conversation from the ruined festival below.</p>

<p>And still General Crack said nothing, nor seemed in the least
disturbed; only his dark glance travelled round and round the
table secretly, watching all those flushed and agitated faces;
and always they came back, those dark, keen eyes, to Leopold on
his Imperial dais, just a step higher than even kings and
princes; Leopold, under the scrolling of the gaudy magnificence
of the Imperial Diadem. Once the Bavarian caught that quiet, that
almost ironic, glance; a glance that was judging and condemning
him for failure; that was sneering at his weakness. Why could he
not have concealed those dispatches? Why, rather, had they all
forced him into this position that he did not want, that he could
not fill?</p>

<p>Leopold could have cried out in protest before them all, and
flung down these tawdry and flimsy dignities, the meaningless,
gaudy honours that they poured on him for their own
ends&mdash;not for his! Only because they could not find another
man to fill the odious position of figurehead.</p>

<p>His gaze fell to his hands, and he noted how they shook behind
the lace points; he noticed, too, how The Golden Fleece, all
diamonds, steel and gold, glittering on his bosom rose and fell,
sparkled and flashed with the tumultuous beating of that heart he
could not control. Every one must be seeing it as he saw it
himself; he was a target for all their glances of
displeasure.</p>

<p>The supper was over; the gorgeous gathering broke up; there
was talk of a Council of War; but Leopold said, nervously: "Not
to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Even as he made this evasion, he knew that they would hold
their Council without him.</p>

<p>They all went their way through the awakened town to their
quarters and palaces, and Leopold himself returned slowly to the
apartment reserved for him in the King's house. An elegant
<i>berline</i> had brought his sister and a bevy of ladies from
Vienna; Leopold heard with dislike their thin, chattering voices
rising from their rooms, discussing this ill news which had so
soon leapt from mouth to mouth. He did not want to see any of
them: he was vexed by the nervous whim of Maria Luisa which had
urged her to refuse to remain alone in the capital; vexed by the
coquettish pursuit of the Countess Carola, who could not
understand that she no longer charmed him. If they had arrived a
little earlier, they too would have been at his banquet,
witnesses of his discomfiture; and he would have had to endure
afterwards his sister's reproaches and the Countess Carola's
encouragement. But the roads had been bad, and they were late;
even now they were only unpacking their baggage and rearranging
their rooms, with the noisy help of maids and servants.</p>

<p>But Leopold did not hope to be free of every one. In the
sullen expectation of the company of both Hensdorff, Father St.
Nikola and possibly the King of Prussia, he waited in his
anteroom all painted with peacocks and lily flowers, flourishing
and twining on a gilt background that they had given him in which
to house his hollow pomp.</p>

<p>Neither Hensdorff nor the King of Prussia asked for an
audience: they had their own urgent matters to attend to; the
affairs of both had been considerably changed by the news
received during the banquet.</p>

<p>Hensdorff was gathering all the details of the two defeats;
and the King of Prussia was considering how to repair them: while
Leopold waited alone in his quiet room. Father St. Nikola also
left Leopold in peace; he was a man of infinite tact; he had seen
his master's face, and knew that this was no good moment either
for consolation or reproach. He had heard already that the
Emperor had made no great show at table, when he had received the
news, and he blamed&mdash;like the man of the world he
was&mdash;the breakdown in etiquette and general management which
had permitted a man like Leopold to be publicly handed bad news;
bah, one didn't expose a man like that!</p>

<p>But though these three stayed away from his gorgeous little
apartment, Leopold was not alone; the man whom he least wished to
see, Prince Christian, demanded an audience. And although the
ready blood stormed Leopold's brow when he heard this name, he
could not refuse to see his Commander-in-Chief at such a
moment.</p>

<p>Christian had said nothing at the banqueting table; he had,
therefore, most likely the more to say now.</p>

<p>Leopold walked up and down the room nervously, struggling hard
for something of that same superb composure, that serene
indifference, with which his general always affronted him.</p>

<p>Christian entered without haste; he did not seem in the least
disturbed. Even that keen scrutiny with which he had glanced
round the supper table was veiled. He kept his gaze off
Leopold.</p>

<p>He was trim and neat, almost foppish, to the last detail. He
flicked a speck of dust from his bullion-encrusted cuff, and
carefully placed on a malachite side table his soldier's hat
clasped with a panache of clipped white ostrich plumes.</p>

<p>"We must," declared Leopold, with what grandeur he could
command, "find out the details of these disasters."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Christian, "I already know them. Captain
Nordling, who brought those dispatches, had them delivered to him
by two separate messengers, one of whom rode fast, the other of
whom was delayed. Therefore at one moment he received them. He
was ill-advised, Sire, as to the time of deliverance of them to
Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Leopold had to endure this flick at his pride.</p>

<p>"What are these details?" he said, still pacing up and down
the room.</p>

<p>"Of no importance," remarked Christian. "Olivenza was taken by
surprise, Guastalla was outmanoeuvred. They are both incapable
men."</p>

<p>He gave the last two words a light stress.</p>

<p>"There are," replied Leopold, bitterly, "many incapable men in
my service; it will be the duty of Your Highness to replace them
with others."</p>

<p>"I wish," said Christian, coldly, "that I had been permitted
to replace these two generals before they had brought this
misfortune on us, a number of stout fellows have been lost by the
negligence of these two poltroons: to say nothing of a fine train
of artillery, and a considerable loss of prestige."</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer. He pulled at the rich laces which hung
on his breast below the pompous glitter of The Golden Fleece, and
stood by the dark curtains that shrouded the window; the very
summer air oppressed him; his nerves were like a bow
unstrung.</p>

<p>Christian looked at him directly as he spoke again.</p>

<p>"There must be an end of this," he remarked, with quiet but
immeasurable arrogance. "I cannot undertake to repair the
fortunes of Your Majesty as long as you employ these wavering,
vain and flourishing men. It was some days ago my advice," he
continued, "that these generals should be recalled."</p>

<p>"Advice impossible for me to act upon," cried Leopold, hotly.
"They are great nobles of whom you speak, and held command under
my father."</p>

<p>"And for that reason," replied Christian, "Your Majesty's
Imperial father was not so successful as his supporters would
have wished."</p>

<p>"It is not given to every soldier," replied Leopold, "to be
victorious."</p>

<p>"It is given to every soldier," said Christian, "and to every
man to make the most of opportunity. These men should be
broken...should be cashiered. It is sufficient condemnation that
they are both in safety," he added, with a flashing look. "That
each has lost his army and is in safety, Sire!"</p>

<p>Leopold replied, briefly:</p>

<p>"I cannot inflict any further disgrace on two men already
severely punished."</p>

<p>"And I," countered Christian, "will not have such generals
under me."</p>

<p>"You take a high tone," said the Emperor.</p>

<p>"I take a high place," replied Christian, eyeing him
straightly.</p>

<p>Implacable, inflexible, and always with that air of faintly
ironical amusement, he stood at his ease and eyed the
Emperor.</p>

<p>"I take a high place," he repeated; "and I have sworn to put
Your Imperial Majesty in a yet higher place. This cannot be done
if I am hampered by fools."</p>

<p>Leopold did not reply. He thought he could hear murmurs in the
street below&mdash;angry and disloyal murmurs; tumult of disgust;
confusions of disillusion; perhaps already he was not so
popular.</p>

<p>"I have also to remind Your Majesty," continued the even voice
of General Crack, "that these misfortunes are the result of
delay. These two men have been allowed to linger with excuses and
evasions. They have been months on marches that should have been
a matter of weeks; and here we pay for these vain
lingerings."</p>

<p>Leopold breathed heavily, pulled out his handkerchief, and
pressed it to his dry lips.</p>

<p>"You yourself," continued Christian; "Sire, you yourself have
also delayed. We are everywhere weeks behind my design. I from
the first have urged action, and there has been no action; even
now we have not our men in the field. Banquetings and triumphant
entries would better become Your Majesty at the conclusion, not
at the commencement, of the campaign."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" breathed Leopold, distractedly.</p>

<p>"I mean that we waited in Prague too long for Your Majesty.
There was no excuse, Sire, for those long delays in your coming
from Vienna, and I would advise Your Majesty that the next time I
will not wait for your Imperial presence. I would not have waited
this time," he added, coolly, "but that I thought it an ill
example for the troops that you should dally away time in the
capital while they took the field."</p>

<p>"This," whispered Leopold, "is insolence."</p>

<p>"This," replied Christian, "is truth and common sense. I have
indeed engaged to do a certain work; but I have not engaged to do
it with my hands tied."</p>

<p>"You have full powers," Leopold nervously reminded him. "I do
not know what more you ask!"</p>

<p>"I want leave to exercise those same powers. I want to warn
Your Majesty&mdash;"</p>

<p>This word was more than Leopold could endure with
patience.</p>

<p>"Warn me? Of what do you wish to warn me, Prince Christian? Of
your possible disloyalty?"</p>

<p>Unmoved, Christian cast off the insult.</p>

<p>"There is no question of loyalty between you and me, Sire," he
replied. "I am a mercenary soldier whom you have engaged, whose
services you have paid for."</p>

<p>Leopold turned away resentfully at this reference to an
obnoxious theme.</p>

<p>"If you admit yourself a mercenary," he asked, sharply, "what
guarantee have I that you will not behave as one? What guarantee
have I that I can rely upon your services?"</p>

<p>"My word," replied Christian temperately. "I have never been
known to prefer my interest to my honour."</p>

<p>Leopold paused in his nervous walk, and looked his
Commander-in-Chief curiously up and down.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "your word; I have, then, your word? You will
serve me whatever happens?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Christian; "what need is there to speak of
that? I have sworn to see you crowned, Sire; but do not," and he
faintly smiled, "make my task too difficult. I am already
hampered by this double defeat."</p>

<p>"But you have sworn," insisted Leopold, breathing quickly, in
fierce extremes of considerable agitation. Again he played with
his ruffled laces, and all the solid insignia of his unstable
honours above his giddy heart. "Whatever happens, you are sworn
to me. My armies, my people and my destiny&mdash;all are
entrusted to you."</p>

<p>"Certainly I have sworn," repeated Christian, "whatever
happens. But from now on," he added, "I will see that nothing
<i>does</i> happen to hinder me. I have my reasons, Sire, for
wishing the campaign at an end."</p>

<p>Leopold put his hand to his sick head; he knew the reason; he
knew that Christian wanted to return to that girl safely shut
away in Ottenheim.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you have had your reward, but you have not
enjoyed it."</p>

<p>Christian ignored this.</p>

<p>"Have I leave," he demanded, "to punish Guastalla and
Olivenza?"</p>

<p>Leopold sat down weakly before a tall mirror, wreathed with
garlands of roses and loops of ribbons which seemed to flutter,
so light they were; he looked reproachfully at his own charming
and bedizened person.</p>

<p>"No!" he said, with his back to the other man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>

<p class="first">THE sound of his own denial strengthened
Leopold; though he gazed with contempt at his own gorgeous image
in the gaudy mirror and knew that his own white look of weakness
unmasked his external pomp, still he was encouraged by the sound
of his own denial.</p>

<p>"No!" he repeated.</p>

<p>Christian took no heed of this; he seemed about to take his
leave. He made a gesture towards his hat on the side table; then
his hand dropped again, and he looked in silence at the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Leopold saw in the glass the hateful dazzle of the diamonds on
The Golden Fleece, and on the hilt of his State sword, which
Hensdorff had carefully sent from Vienna for this entry into
Berlin; he impetuously disencumbered himself of these glowing
fripperies, sword and Golden Fleece, and flung them down. The
brilliant collar and the resplendent weapon lay side by side on
the marble table beneath the mirror.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," remarked Christian, quietly, eyeing him,
"shows some nicety of judgment. Those gauds are more for a
conqueror's wear."</p>

<p>Leopold did not reply. He rose abruptly, went to the window,
and pulled back the heavy damask curtains upon the clear, frosty
night. All was silent without now; the tumult had vanished into
utter peace; the people were withdrawn into their homes; a
pellucid sky was innocent of the raucous stain of fireworks.</p>

<p>"I," remarked Christian, "have bidden these people go home,
and save their powder and their hurrahs, both of which will be
more appropriate later."</p>

<p>Leopold leant against the frame of the tall window in what
seemed a mood of cold, careless apathy. Christian still waited as
if expecting him to say or do something of a certain importance;
but Leopold, when he at last did begin to speak, spoke to little
purpose.</p>

<p>"Everything is tainted," he remarked, "all so stale and
tarnished. I can put no heart into any of it. All that troubles
me now is the thought of those men who have wretchedly
perished&mdash;for what?&mdash;for me, who am nothing; for my
cause, which is nothing too. Everything is tainted!" and in this
mind, and almost on his lips, he bitterly added: "All except that
girl you've snatched from me and have safely hidden with your
other plunder in Ottenheim!" Plunder of war, booty of conquest:
that was what she was; by no other right did Christian hold her;
his unwilling victim.</p>

<p>Christian regarded Leopold with sincere indifference; he had
no cause to hate him or to be jealous of him. He was utterly
ignorant of the passions that tormented Leopold; he did not know
that he had ever gazed with love on Eleanora. Nor did Christian
wish to depreciate the man whom he had sworn to exalt: it would
have pleased him better if the Emperor had made a better display
and put a finer gloss on the matter; he was even slightly vexed
that Leopold showed so much weakness, and he lingered now in the
doubtful hope that in some way Leopold would retrieve his
character and display some decision.</p>

<p>"Sire," he exclaimed, "this is no time for shreds and scraps
of philosophy. I know not if the world is better or worse than
ever it was or ever will be; but it is my world, and I must live
in it and make the best of it. Now, as to Guastalla and
Olivenza&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As to them," said Leopold, quickly and even vehemently, "let
them go. I do not know the whole tale; any general is liable to
misfortune, and defeat."</p>

<p>"And any general is liable to be court-martialled and
cashiered," remarked Christian, quietly. "As for not
knowing&mdash;the matter of the case&mdash;I have a fair idea.
Since the banquet I have been able to discover what
occurred."</p>

<p>Leopold did not wish to hear; he had no academic interest in
the plans of war, though his Jesuit governor had done the best
that ability and enthusiasm could do to instruct him in
mathematics and engineering and tactics.</p>

<p>But General Crack was quietly explaining to him: "Olivenza,
coming up from Lombardy, crossed the Tyrol and was defeated on
the banks of the Lech. With the remnant of his force, he drew off
to Nuremberg, where he sent the dispatches. The bearer was
delayed on the road. At Leipzig he met the messenger from Fürth,
with news of a defeat at Neuwied. They were beaten by the English
under Lord Carfax, with the King of England's Hanoverian and
Hessian troops. They lost all their baggage and artillery. The
amount of prestige gained by the enemy is considerable. It is the
opening of the campaign..." Christian reminded his listener, with
a certain patience, "and it was most important that the first
successes should have been ours. Olivenza has been months
crossing the Tyrol, in fine weather and without opposition. It is
this kind of generalship that has placed Your Majesty where you
stand now. These men must be made an example."</p>

<p>But Leopold protested. He remembered Olivenza with
kindness&mdash;the lean, courteous, grave Spaniard; with even
more kindness he remembered Guastalla, the Italian, a friend of
his father; a man who had played with him when he was a child; he
was not going to deliver these men over to any manner of
punishment and humiliation at the hands of this upstart
mercenary.</p>

<p>"Let them be!" he said. "I will go into the matter
presently."</p>

<p>"De Lisle is coming up presently," Christian remarked, still
with infinite patience. "He will support me."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Leopold, heavily. "The French always support
Your Highness; but after all, I am the Emperor," he added,
weakly.</p>

<p>"Humanly speaking," said Christian, with a slight smile, "Your
Majesty is only King of the Romans and Elector of Bavaria; and
your Electorate, unfortunately, is mostly in the hands of the
enemy. It is my business to make you Emperor, and it seems, Sire,
that you are <i>going</i> to make that difficult for me. Listen,
Sire," he continued, with eagerness, "have you the whole thing
clearly before your eyes? Austria is yours, but part of Bavaria,
you know&mdash;Hanover, Westphalia and The Spanish
Netherlands&mdash;are held by the English, the Dutch and the
Hanoverians. Pomerania, Poland and Kurland are loyal, but, I
think, dubiously so. Brussels is in the hands of the enemy. Our
allies, the French, certainly hold the Rhine; and the Palatinate,
there they have just been defeated; and these troops on which we
were counting, coming from Italy, have been scattered. The enemy
are sending reinforcements to the Italian front, and I know not
how we are well to spare men to meet them."</p>

<p>"I can hear none of this now," said Leopold, impatiently. His
head was aching, his eyes burning. "You must talk of it with
Hensdorff; I am no general," he added bitterly.</p>

<p>"But if you would be Emperor," said Christian, still
preserving his ironic patience, "you must know something of this
matter. I wish De Lisle would come&mdash;he is rather late. The
King of Prussia did not like that news to-night," added
Christian; "he was disappointed, discomposed; it came in an evil
moment, His Majesty is avid for success."</p>

<p>"He is as false as a fox!" cried Leopold, furiously. "Even
now, I believe he treats with the enemy!"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that he does," answered Christian. "It little
matters whom he treats with. The question is whom he will serve.
If I can have his troops, he may pursue his policy with whom he
will."</p>

<p>Leopold turned away towards the inner room. He made a gesture
that dismissed Christian.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say to-night. It seems to me that you
have matters pretty well in your own hands; but I would again
remind Your Highness that I will not have Guastalla or Olivenza
touched."</p>

<p>Christian bowed without replying; and Leopold passed between
the long curtains that hung before the door of the
bedchamber.</p>

<p>Christian stood thoughtfully a moment, and in that moment
Count Hensdorff entered the Royal Apartment.</p>

<p>"His Majesty has retired," remarked Christian. "He can endure
no more to-night. Will you pursue him into his bedchamber? I
think, however, there will be little to be gained from him."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff sighed. He looked haggard and fatigued. This
first and considerable cross had greatly moved him; the whole
atmosphere seemed heavy with the taint of failure.</p>

<p>"I am badly hampered," added Christian, "even before I take
the field. I warned you, Count Hensdorff, and I warned the
Emperor; there were too many delays&mdash;and now we must face
the result."</p>

<p>"Both those men are incapable," replied Hensdorff. "I
complained to the late Emperor about them. One is a Spanish
grandee, and the other was his friend; and there had to be
meddling with them."</p>

<p>"They'll be meddled with now," said Christian, calmly. "I
intend to replace them both."</p>

<p>"Has the Emperor agreed to that?" asked Hensdorff, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"He has not," said Christian, "but I think that little
matters."</p>

<p>He passed thoughtfully to the marble ormolu table by the
window, and fingered the glittering collar of the Fleece, with
the diamonds hanging like a cluster of stars.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff smiled sourly.</p>

<p>"You've got that," he remarked, "now you'll want more solid
things, eh?"</p>

<p>Christian smiled at him without umbrage.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" asked Hensdorff, biting his
heavy forefinger.</p>

<p>"I must wait till De Lisle comes up, then I shall move
straight on the enemy and clear them out of Bavaria. Until the
country is all ours we cannot move. There are too many wedges of
Hanoverians and English into the Imperial Dominion."</p>

<p>"Anhalt-Dessau is much agitated," remarked Hensdorff. "This
defeat of Guastalla was too near his kingdom for his liking."</p>

<p>"Anhalt-Dessau will be safe enough," remarked Christian,
calmly. He laid down the sparkling collar of The Golden Fleece
and turned to Hensdorff with a half smile. "I think there is no
more to be done here&mdash;" he glanced towards the curtains that
concealed Leopold&mdash;"he is overwhelmed; leave him alone, if
he is to make any show tomorrow." With that he took up his hat
and left the room.</p>

<p>As he passed down the long corridors, so lately adorned in the
elaborate and elegant French fashion with mirrors and statues and
long pictures of woods and meadows and nymphs, he had to pass the
apartment assigned to the Archduchess Maria Luisa. He smiled to
hear the light rise and fall of the women's eager voices within,
and slackened his steps a moment; in that moment the high double
door was opened, and the Archduchess came out into the
corridor.</p>

<p>She had not changed her travelling dress, and was in some
disarray; she was always careless of her attire like her brother;
her cravat hung in manly fashion, loosely knotted over the bosom
of her green habit, and her curls were loose and disordered under
a black ribbon.</p>

<p>She was not as handsome as Leopold; always too pale, her
features too heavy, her eyes were marred by drooping lids; but
she had both grace and dignity, and a wistful elegance; seeing
Christian, she stopped at once and looked at him; and he stopped
too, even after his mechanical and courteous salutation. He
remembered how she had been offered to him, and how he had
refused her, and he was sorry for her; he could recall dropping
her miniature from his bed, letting it fall with contempt onto
the bedstep. And the miniature had flattered her: she was not so
delicately coloured, nor so lively in expression, as the little
painting had pretended.</p>

<p>Yet she had charm: a wistful and timid charm. Christian knew
that she must be aware of those shameful negotiations in which
she had figured; and he smiled and bowed again, with an
exaggerated deference. He would not have spoken, but she stopped
him as he was about to pass on.</p>

<p>"Why have you not brought your wife, Monseigneur?" she asked.
"All the ladies are gathered in Berlin, and we should have been
glad of her company."</p>

<p>"She is, as yet," answered Christian, "unused to the world,
and happier, Madame, where I have left her&mdash;at
Ottenheim."</p>

<p>The Archduchess replied, nervously:</p>

<p>"As for me&mdash;I could not stay in Vienna. The times are too
full of rumour and alarm. Even to-night, Monseigneur, I hear
there has been disastrous news."</p>

<p>"Not disastrous, I hope," replied Christian, smiling, "but not
good news, Madame."</p>

<p>He perceived that she wished to detain him, and in his
courtesy he suffered himself to be detained. He wished to efface
from her mind the ugly episode in which he and she had both
innocently figured. He knew that he had, despite himself, as it
were, inflicted a gross insult upon this delicate and fastidious
woman, and he would have liked to make amends.</p>

<p>She closed the gleaming door behind her, and moved towards
him. He noted her slight limp, which had been the subject of so
much ribaldry from her brother's enemies.</p>

<p>He had seen her several times before, but never before had he
noticed her carefully: she had been to him merely a pale woman
who did not attract him. Now she was the woman who might have
been his wife&mdash;the woman who might have made him an Imperial
Archduke&mdash;the woman who certainly <i>would</i> have been his
wife with all these honours as her dowry, had he not seen
Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau.</p>

<p>"You need have no apprehension, Your Highness," he said,
kindly; "things are not so black as they appear, in these chance
rumours and vulgar alarms. Guastalla and Olivenza have been
defeated because they were incompetent. The war has been
conducted like a hunt, or a party of pleasure. When that is
ended, you will see a different turn to affairs."</p>

<p>"We trust in you," said the Princess, stiffly. "My brother is
very young, and something overwhelmed."</p>

<p>Christian did not even reflect, much less remind her, that
Leopold was only a very few years younger than himself. Neither
did it occur to the lady; for Christian, for all his handsome,
even foppish, appearance, had an air of weight and maturity.</p>

<p>"Will Your Highness accompany the army?" he asked,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"No," answered the Archduchess, timidly, "we remain here with
the King's sister&mdash;there is no other place for us at
present."</p>

<p>"I hope, Madame," smiled Christian, "to make Brussels safe for
you a little later on."</p>

<p>"Do you hope to take Brussels?" asked the Princess,
childishly.</p>

<p>"One may indulge so rashly, I believe," he answered, with a
deepening smile.</p>

<p>Now she had to permit him to go; why she had detained him she
could not tell; why she was reluctant to leave him she could not
tell, either. If he had never before noticed her, she, from the
first moment she had seen him, had noticed him. She held her hand
out now, and he kissed it; perhaps with some half regret for what
he had lost in losing this lady. And yet a very faint regret, for
even now he was enjoying, in the secret chambers of his heart,
the infantile graces and maiden sweetness of Eleanora, safely
locked away from all of them, waiting for him in Ottenheim.</p>

<p>The Archduchess returned to her apartment and sat sighing
among her ladies, her hands locked in her lap. She was fatigued
and dispirited; she had heard Hensdorff that very day discussing
a double marriage, that of herself and her brother&mdash;with two
people whom she had never seen; and she turned her head towards
the door, thinking of how she had opened it and met Prince
Christian outside.</p>

<p>Neither Christian nor Leopold slept that night; the first was
busy with his secretaries and the second with his priest. And
Gabor, also, had little sleep. He walked about the clear, moonlit
streets, agitated, stimulated by brilliant thoughts. For a while
he sat in a little beer cellar and listened to the thumping,
pounding music, and watched the couples dancing in the heated,
rancid atmosphere, dark with tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>Then he went out into the streets again, refreshed by the
strong, bleak night breeze on his face, and wandered in and out
of little, dark alleys, where obscure print-shops already dared
to expose drawings of Leopold and Christian as bear and
bear-leader. Gabor enjoyed these crude daubed prints showing the
great mercenary leading the Emperor by a chain; or, seated high
in a chair of State, insolently bidding his master pull off his
boots. In all the drawings, lampoons and pamphlets piled up in
these little dark shops in the little dark alleys, Gabor could
spell out the public opinion of the Emperor as mocked and abased;
and that of Christian as owning a pride as high as heaven; all
had a Columbine in the background. And Gabor, knowing the secret
of the two men, took a deep and terrible delight in thinking how
he would twist their fates as he pleased. He knew what was
racking Leopold; he knew what had lain behind his agitation at
the banquet&mdash;the tremblings of a sheer passion that consumed
him; and he knew the slumbering ecstasy in the heart of
Christian.</p>

<p>For a long space he wandered from shop to shop, peering into
the shadows to make out the half-hid libels and lampoons. Then he
returned to his own high-placed chamber, which looked so widely
over the dark and quiet city. Again he leant from his gabled
window as he had leant earlier in the evening; but this time,
instead of looking down into the narrow street, he looked towards
the dark pile of the Palace, where those two men now were; he
could see lights in most of the windows&mdash;few would be taking
repose there to-night!</p>

<p>Gabor could imagine the storms of hope and fear distracting
Leopold, and the lavish confidence and pride of power upholding
Christian&mdash;Christian, who was so unconscious of any evil
threatening him or his; who was unaware of any misfortune which
he himself could not grapple with.</p>

<p>"And I," thought Gabor, "would like to see him so vile, so
base, that none can wish him worse."</p>

<p>Presently he returned to his lamp-lit table. There was paper
of many kinds, different quills, and ink; Gabor was an expert in
counterfeit handwriting, in the unravelling of cipher, and all
such tricks.</p>

<p>He now took up a fine sheet, and began to write.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the dawn, Maréchal De Lisle came up from
Belgrade, and was immediately met by Christian and the King of
Prussia. Leopold, as befitted both his rank and his mood,
remained in his room in the Royal Palace. He had received a
manner of feverish consolation from the exhortations of Father
St. Nikola; there in religion, in the proud, mighty, inflexible
and hereditary religion of his House, he found a certain
strength. He could only go on if God had ordained that he should
go on; and in the solemn assurances of the Jesuit that his
elevation was indeed the Divine Will, Leopold had found a comfort
for his confusion and bewilderment. He had not, however, even in
his most intimate confessions to the priest, mentioned the heart
of his torment: the thought of Eleanora, the girl whom he had
paid as the price of the services of Prince Christian; the girl
who had been intended for his own wife, and whom he had lost by
so little.</p>

<p>He wished to ignore the existence of this hidden passion, and
therefore, even to his confessor, he could not breathe that
secret and cherished name. Yet, even now, with his generals in
consultation around him, with his army getting ready to depart,
with the fate of his crown and his people hanging delicately in
the balance of a perhaps immediate battle, he could not dwell on
anything but that girl hidden in Ottenheim. He wished that he had
the strength to command Christian to bring her to Berlin, to keep
the other women company; but he knew that he could not bring her
name across his lips to her husband. He guessed why Christian
kept her shut away; why he never spoke of her; she was the jewel
at the bottom of the most precious and most secret casket which
he intended should ravish the eyes of the owner alone; to
embellish his bosom only, and never to be smirched or affronted
by the gaze of strangers.</p>

<p>Leopold could understand this. If Eleanora had been his wife,
he would so have treated her; and, torment on torment, on these
thoughts came the recollection of the interview with the
scoundrel Gabor. Even villains sometimes speak the truth, and
Leopold had no arts whereby to distinguish truth from falsehood;
he did not yet know if what Gabor had said was lies or not.
Suppose it were true, and she was languishing with withered
hopes, trusting in him for a deliverance he could not send?
Supposing she had indeed been forced to her nuptials believing,
till belief was useless, that he would never permit her wanton
sacrifice? If he could only see her again! Only that&mdash;he
would ask no more. If it might be given to him to efface the
memory from her sweet mind of that last, most dreadful, parting,
when he had fled from her like a whipped coward, mounted and
ridden away while she stood on her little balcony with
outstretched hands, imploring him to stay...ay, he had bereft her
of more then than a day's pleasure in those enchanting woods;
perhaps of her whole life&mdash;perhaps even of her soul. If he
could go back! And he began desperately turning over the distance
from Berlin to Ottenheim. Craziness, of course! He could not
leave the army: Christian would see to that. Not as an Emperor, a
soldier, or a man could he turn back to Ottenheim until the
campaign was over. And even then&mdash;what of it? Christian
would go to her, not he; and he paled, and drooped his head into
his hands and bit his lip, thinking of those few hours of that
one night when Christian had been with her at Ottenheim, her
lover and her lord! Too well he was aware that Christian had an
outward splendour and a glittering, pompous reputation, those
cold, implacable ways with his fellow men most likely to impress
a woman&mdash;a young and inexperienced woman. And little hope
had he, once Christian had had her in his possession, that she
would remember him, her feeble, fleeing lover, the man who had
ridden away as Christian would never have ridden away; the man
who had not had the courage to take her as Christian had taken
her...</p>

<p>He sat idly in his chamber-robe, drinking chocolate; no doubt
they already expected him at the Council of War, but they must
wait. He did not care if he was late at the formal deliberations
where he would have no voice. He was even, in his goaded
weakness, tempted to flout them all by not appearing at all; and
so he lingered, unrobed, dishevelled, with his hair falling
untidily on his shoulders and his thoughts in Ottenheim.</p>

<p>Then one of his gentlemen came to ask him if he would grant a
private audience to one Gabor&mdash;Prince Gabor, a
Transylvanian, in the employ of Count Hensdorff. Leopold flushed
at the insolence of this demand; how the fellow must despise him,
to dare a second time to force into his presence. And then, after
the sense of affront, came a sense of curiosity; he would see
him: he had wanted to see him ever since he had sent him away
before...</p>

<p>The gentleman reminded His Majesty that the barbers waited,
and the valets; there was not half an hour before the meeting of
the Council of War, which had only been delayed from yesterday
for the presence of Maréchal De Lisle. But Leopold declared that
he had yet time to spare.</p>

<p>"Let this fellow Gabor come to me," he said. "I have at least
this half-hour to myself."</p>

<p>Gabor entered. He made the decorous appearance of a private
gentleman. All trace of yesterday's debauchery, all last night's
wanderings, had been effaced; there was no trace of either. He
was sleek, elegant and servile. In his greyish face there was no
sign of any emotion. He had crept up the back stairs of the
Palace, effecting an entry easily enough, as in most houses and
many palaces he could effect an entry.</p>

<p>Leopold received him with a bravado of haughtiness.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, what do you mean by this second intrusion?" he
asked, masking his weakness with defiance.</p>

<p>And Gabor, bowing low, murmured:</p>

<p>"What does Your Majesty mean by a second time receiving
me?"</p>

<p>Leopold bit his full under lip. If this was insolence or an
insidious pity he could not perceive; he was baffled by this
man's depraved and sinister presence.</p>

<p>"Count Hensdorff employs you, I think?" he asked, frowning,
and trying to gain time. And he leant back in his flowered
bedgown, and clasped his hands behind his head. He could see from
the window where he sat a noble prospect of towers and spires,
and the bright day coming up over all.</p>

<p>"My business, Sire," replied Gabor, standing now very straight
and respectful, "is one from which I shall get either little
credit or profit; and one upon which I am forced to throw myself
again upon Your Majesty's mercy."</p>

<p>"I should not be seeing you at all," murmured Leopold; "but
Hensdorff, it seems, has taken you into his employ. I do not know
what part you play, Prince Gabor&mdash;" He paused, doubtful as
to what to say, wishing to evade the point and yet impatient to
come to it.</p>

<p>"What part I play, Sire, though a useful one to you, is of no
matter now," said Gabor, almost with too much ostentation of
deference and humility. "But I have been chosen by a lady as her
messenger."</p>

<p>Leopold blushed; the uncontrollable blood stormed his face; he
put his hand to his hot cheeks, vexed to the heart with
himself.</p>

<p>"What lady?" he asked, and rose, pulling at the tumbled
cambric at his throat.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will know the lady; it is Princess Eleanora of
Anhalt-Dessau, now Prince Christian's wife."</p>

<p>"And it is impossible," murmured Leopold, in a fascinated
tone, "that she is sending messages to me."</p>

<p>"Not a message, but a letter," smiled Gabor; and produced a
long, slim envelope from his pocket, carefully sealed.</p>

<p>Leopold could see nothing else in the room but this; and Gabor
delicately laid it on the table, beside the chocolate pot and the
flowered Meissen porcelain.</p>

<p>Leopold, speechless, looking down, saw the familiar arms of
Kurland, impressed upon the red seal, the ermine and the purple,
with the goat's head for crest, and the anagram "C.R.A.C.K."
which stood for "General Crack."</p>

<p>"You see," commented Gabor, softly, "you see, Your Majesty,
that already she uses her husband's arms. There can be no doubt
that it is indeed from her."</p>

<p>"I do not know her hand," murmured Leopold, faintly; and Gabor
could scarcely conceal his triumph at this admission; he had
counted on that&mdash;that Leopold did not know her hand. There
could, indeed, be few outside her own family who knew the writing
of so young and obscure a personage as Eleanora of
Anhalt-Dessau.</p>

<p>"Why should she send this to you?" asked Leopold amazed.</p>

<p>"Her Highness," said Gabor, "is very simple, Sire; a child,
almost, as you may have perceived. She chose, that day in
Dürsheim, to make a confidant of me. She wished to convey this
letter, which contains"&mdash;he shrugged to his ears&mdash;"who
knows: perhaps some prayer for her husband's advancement or
protection."</p>

<p>Leopold caught the sneer and writhed.</p>

<p>"We will not discuss what is in this letter," he said,
haughtily, "but how you received it."</p>

<p>"It was sent to me," replied Gabor, quickly, "by one of the
Duchess of Schönbuchers servants. Your Majesty may speak with him
if you will."</p>

<p>But Leopold shrunk back.</p>

<p>"Not that," he said; "discussing with servants this affair. It
is enough that I must parley with you, Prince Gabor; enough that
the Princess has taken such a strange way to communicate with
me."</p>

<p>"She is in a strange situation," said Gabor. "A wife and not a
wife," he added, carefully; "a wife left so soon, too soon for
her safety."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Leopold swiftly.</p>

<p>"I said <i>not</i> a wife," insinuated Gabor. "Prince
Christian took her to his Château, and there left her, as he
might have left his sister. For half an hour he spoke with
her&mdash;and then left her."</p>

<p>"For half an hour he spoke with her," repeated Leopold,
slowly. "How do you know this? And what do these innuendoes
mean?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty's mind can tell you what I mean. Reflect on my
words, Sire, and you will see the very heart of my meaning.
Prince Christian keeps the maiden for the end of the campaign.
The maiden, Sire, waits for&mdash;" and he paused, smiling at
Leopold; the word "you" had been formed upon his lips. "She is as
she was when she left her father's house. Her dreams of love,
Sire, are undisturbed.</p>

<p>"That was a subtle move on Prince Christian's part&mdash;his
way of love, Sire. And there she stays in Ottenheim, her Paradise
serene. Love waits for the lucky man, Sire."</p>

<p>"Is this possible?" breathed Leopold. "And how do you
know?"</p>

<p>"It is very possible, Sire, to the fantastic-minded. Prince
Christian cared enough to wait, seeing perhaps that she was
occupied with thoughts of another man."</p>

<p>"But he," cried Leopold, "could not have known this, even if
it were true."</p>

<p>Again Gabor shrugged, spreading out his hands.</p>

<p>"It is not for me to say. I come not into this at all, save as
a passing confidant of the distracted maiden. She has confided in
me, Sire&mdash;" He glanced towards the envelope. "She has
trusted in you. I have no further part, save in so far as you
should care to command me."</p>

<p>"I command nothing but your secrecy," said Leopold, scarcely
knowing what he said. "I know not at the moment what to say or
do&mdash;leave me; I have no longer any time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor any answer for the Princess Eleanora, Sire?" smiled
Gabor. "The lady is in deep distress and confusion."</p>

<p>"But these matters that you speak of&mdash;that she is
still..." Leopold paused and altered his sentence, which, in his
agitation, he scarce knew how to phrase "...that she is only by
her name his wife? How is this known to you?"</p>

<p>"It is known, Sire, to every one&mdash;in Ottenheim."</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer; he turned and stared out of the window
at that clear, brilliant prospect of the lovely city beneath the
leaping light of growing day. He could not now afford to affront
Gabor. He seemed, in some insidious and horrible way, to have
wound into the very heart and core of his most cherished secret.
What the man knew or did not know he dared not enquire. He looked
at him with loathing and with fear, and spoke him fairly with a
bitter effort.</p>

<p>"Go now," he said, "and before we leave Berlin I will send my
answer; if not by you, by another."</p>

<p>"Best by me, Sire," remarked Gabor, calmly, "since this is
scarce a business into which to bring too many meddlers. Tongues
move quickly, Sire, in such an affair. It were well," he added,
boldly, "not to offend Prince Christian before the issue of the
campaign is decided."</p>

<p>"Why should I in any way offend Prince Christian?" said
Leopold, nervously and wildly.</p>

<p>"Sire, if I may dare to say, I think perhaps if you wrote to
the Princess Eleanora or she wrote to you it would most deeply,
and even mortally, offend Prince Christian."</p>

<p>Leopold had not thought of this, and the words brought him up
sharply as the sudden sight of an abyss might bring a man up who
had been stumbling through fog. All his hopes, all his destiny,
lay in the hands of Christian&mdash;the husband of Eleanora.</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," he muttered, hoarsely, "and presently I
will let you know my resolve."</p>

<p>"How then shall I find Your Majesty? It is not so easy for me,
once we have left the city, to come into your Imperial presence.
Hensdorff can see no reason why I should be closeted with you,
Sire; and as for Prince Christian, I am in his deep
displeasure."</p>

<p>"I will contrive it," said Leopold, eagerly; "somehow I will
contrive it. Leave that to me; and now, begone! Neither," he
added, with deep distaste, "neither your service nor your reward
shall be forgotten, Prince Gabor."</p>

<p>The Transylvanian bowed, and gracefully stepping backwards,
left the Royal presence, congratulating himself on having struck
a shrewd blow at that proud edifice of Christian's fortunes; a
blow that would bring down the glittering fabric of Christian's
ambitions, and those of Leopold; and those of that foolish,
thoughtless, scared girl to one quick ruin.</p>

<p>Leopold immediately tore open the letter. It was brief,
written in a fair hand on a fine paper, with a faint perfume of
violets, forged only a few hours ago in that top gabled room by
Prince Gabor&mdash;written carefully and fastidiously there, and
sealed with that seal which he had used when in the employ of
Christian; an easy trick, a simple ruse&mdash;but it had caught
an easy and a simple man. Leopold had no doubt whatever that he
looked upon the writing of the Princess Eleanora, and he trembled
and felt giddy to swooning as he fingered the paper which he
believed she had touched, the seal he believed she had pressed.
Perhaps this missive had lain in her delicious bosom; perhaps
those soft lips of hers had touched it with pain and regret.</p>

<p>She wrote: "Sire, Monseigneur&mdash;I am left here, bewildered
and alone. They say that I am wed to Christian of Kurland, and
some ceremony there was. Yet I am free at heart as when we met in
the beechwoods of Dürsheim. Why did you go away? Will you come
back some day and tell me what all this means? I am lonely, and
often frightened. He whom they call my husband is a stranger to
me; they talk of his return. Often he writes; and I cannot
answer. Yet because of many dreams, I write this to you. Help me
or comfort me! Your broken-hearted ELEANORA."</p>

<p>Leopold was utterly deceived. So she might write&mdash;the
romantic, lonely girl, shut away in Ottenheim. What had Gabor
said? His pulses beat quickly. "The maiden waits." Christian had
left her&mdash;not for himself, perhaps, but for another;
Christian had shown forbearance, odd, chivalrous forbearance the
advantage of which he, Leopold, might reap; a languorous and
voluptuous glamour was gilding the day for him. He felt a lift of
exaltation such as he had not known for years. The girl was there
as she had always been. What was that ceremony in the Lutheran
church? That civil ceremony? Why, nothing! He with his influence
at Rome could have that futile ceremony annulled easily. He need
not think of her as Christian's wife. That pure, sweet and
delicate creature, shut up with all the mercenary's plunder and
all his gaudy and vulgar wealth in Ottenheim! No, she was still
Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau, and that Lutheran marriage was as
nothing.</p>

<p>He did not think of his promise to Christian, or of the
possible consequences of breaking that promise. He hastily lit
the taper on the desk and burnt the letter, even to the seal, and
crushed the ashes up into fine powder and stamped them into the
carpet. There should be no slander against her through his
indiscretion; he had not been of much finesse or judgment as yet
in any affair, and he was unversed in any amorous intrigue; but
his passionate desire to shield and protect the Princess Eleanora
lent him wits.</p>

<p>Last night had been a degrading lesson; he would not so easily
betray himself again. Surely from Christian he could learn some
composure!</p>

<p>As he submitted himself to the valets and barbers he did not
think of the Council of War waiting for him, or of his armies
preparing for the march, of his enemies advancing, of his
possible coronation. He thought of Eleanora, and of how he could
answer her letter.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">LEOPOLD was late at the Grand Council of War
that had been hastily called in the closet of the King of
Prussia.</p>

<p>"He shows little prudence," remarked the host, drily, "and
seems like a man who has delivered himself to his destiny."</p>

<p>"Yet the moment is pressing, Sire," said De Lisle, urbane, but
judicious, "and hardly one for whimsical delays and idle
moods."</p>

<p>Christian had his notebook open in front of him. On it he was
idly drawing a plan which seemed like a thin, pointed star, but
was really a map of the first town he had ever taken&mdash;that
of Ath. He traced the bastions, the counter scarps, and the path
running from one to another, while he listened to the men all
discussing Leopold, and all discussing him with disdain and some
anger.</p>

<p>Christian glanced round from one face to another: they were
all flushed and excited, agitated by self-interest. The foxy face
of the King of Prussia was almost livid. Only De Lisle remained
completely serene; he was an elderly man, and with many
experiences had gained much dignity. Neither his heart nor his
interest was in this war, which, even if successful, could mean
neither glory to him nor gain to his country. He was fighting for
an abstract thing&mdash;the splendour of the King of France; a
powerful symbol, no doubt, but not one which could inspire a man
like De Lisle to very great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Christian spoke: he felt no malice against Leopold now; that
insult outside Belgrade had long since been avenged; he also had
far too keen a sense of discipline to wish to hear the figurehead
of all this pomp depreciated; it was no use for him to try to put
up a creature whom all his allies and colleagues were
endeavouring to pull down and mock. "No doubt," he thought to
himself, "even when I have put him on the Imperial Throne, he
will topple off it again; but that will not be my business. Once
he is crowned I will wash my hands of him; but for the moment I
must make the best of him." And he began to speak for
Leopold&mdash;without enthusiasm, but lucidly and with justice.
He was now President of the Council of War, Grand Master of the
Artillery, and Generalissimo of the troops of the Emperor. He
therefore was listened to even by the kings and princes present
with considerable respect.</p>

<p>He addressed himself, in particular, to the King of Prussia,
in whom he had a special interest: for this sovereign was now in
nominal possession of Kurland, wrested from Russia, the ancestral
heritage of Christian, the promised bribe for his success in the
coming campaign.</p>

<p>The Poles were willing enough to accept Christian as Duke of
Kurland; he was, after all, the last of the Ketlars; and though
the Empress of Russia's favourite still put in a claim, the King
of Prussia was yet the predominant power in the final disposal of
Kurland, and it had been already understood that he was willing
to relinquish this to Christian in exchange for the coveted
province of Silesia, which Christian had engaged to use all his
influence to procure for him.</p>

<p>It was because of Silesia that his wily Majesty had entered
the war; he and Christian therefore understood each other; and
Christian now addressed him with a certain friendliness and
respect:</p>

<p>"We should not judge His Majesty by last night," he remarked;
"he has his virtues: he is affable and amiable, and those
qualities go well with the people. There were some hearty huzzas
for him...He will be popular, and that is an enormous asset."</p>

<p>"Popular with the people in the streets," muttered the King
with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Popular with the soldiers also," smiled Christian.</p>

<p>"And yet he is nothing of a general," remarked De Lisle,
negligently.</p>

<p>"He is a brave man," replied Christian, quietly, "and an
agreeable one. He is also generous."</p>

<p>"A soft-hearted sentimentalist," snapped the King of Prussia,
who had taken an instant dislike to Leopold.</p>

<p>Christian slightly shrugged; he could not see what this had to
do with the matter. He guessed that the King of Prussia was
bitter because of those two defeats; he was irritated because he
suspected that he had made a poor bargain by joining the cause of
Leopold. And again Christian endeavoured to excuse the man he had
promised to set up above all other men:</p>

<p>"For some years now," he said, "His Majesty has been hunted
and harried. His position has been of the most difficult, and it
would have required an unsurpassable courage to face it all with
equanimity. For myself"&mdash;and he raised his voice
slightly&mdash;"I can see no use in this criticism. If we are to
serve the Emperor with any satisfaction to himself and us, we
must even make the best of him as he is." Almost in the same
breath he added: "But we are under no obligation to make the best
of men like Olivenza and Guastalla."</p>

<p>At these names, De Lisle remarked, coldly, that he considered
both those generals should be instantly placed under arrest; he
suspected ill will on the part of both.</p>

<p>"They must be given," answered Christian, "a chance to justify
themselves; but unless they have the best of excuses, well, I
suggest to Your Majesty"&mdash;and he smiled at the King of
Prussia&mdash;"that they be asked to visit their estates; they
both of them, I believe, have large possessions which have been
lately neglected!"</p>

<p>"Will the Emperor consent to this?" asked De Lisle, who knew
Leopold's kind nature and his particular tenderness towards these
two generals.</p>

<p>"Surely," said the King of Prussia, impatiently, "His Majesty
would not interfere in such a case?"</p>

<p>Christian did not reply: he merely smiled, and continued to
draw double lines round the star which represented Ath. The talk
went on, flagging and yet impetuous. Every one's nerves were
ajar, except those of De Lisle and Christian.</p>

<p>They all argued but to little purpose; they discussed plans
and discarded them; they drew maps and tore them up. Presently
Christian wearied of his designs, and, raising his head, gazed
out of the window behind him, turning so away from the others, of
whose agitated and in many cases foolish faces he was becoming
weary. This Council had to be gone through, but he knew it to be
of little purpose. He had already made his plans, and nothing
could induce him to alter them&mdash;least of all anything that
any of these men might say. Presently he would speak to the King
of Prussia and De Lisle privately. They were the only two who
mattered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile these Princes, Electors and Potentates&mdash;the
Spanish, Italian, Austrian and French&mdash;must have their
pompous arguments, their elaborate discourses, their parade and
flourish of power and influence.</p>

<p>Christian looked into a cold, bright, blue sky in which was a
curdle of white cloud, rising with majestic slowness into the
mighty dome of upper air. Against the bottom of this cloud rose
the exact and precise spires and towers of Berlin, and a thin
flutter of bright-coloured flags.</p>

<p>Christian's thoughts went back to Ottenheim and the
Danube&mdash;that river which he loved more than he loved any
man; which seemed more akin to him than any man: the Danube, like
a knight in silver armour, taking his rest between the dark
hills, the springing forests, now bare save for the last gold
dust of shrivelling leaves. And there stood his Château, gaudy
with his trophies, rich with his spoils&mdash;there in the
gorgeous woods the stately alleys where the exotic animals
wandered, and the incredible birds fluttered tufts of glittering
plumage; where the tinkling fountains rose and fell into basins
that swelled into subtle shapes of monstrous blossoms there
<i>she</i> sat, guarded by Poles and Uhlans in their fur or tiger
skin pelisses and gay brocades, in their barbaric jewels, armed
with their monstrous weapons, prancing on their curvetting
horses&mdash;there she stayed, waiting for him&mdash;safe:
looking over that azure prospect, as he had so often looked over
it; moving through the rooms where he had so often moved;
sleeping in the sumptuous bed where he had so often slept. In his
pocket was a letter from the Duchess of Schönbuchel, a flattering
letter, drawing for him in pleasing colours the picture of
Eleanora&mdash;who spoke of him (wrote the cunning old woman)
even if she was too timid to write.</p>

<p>Christian was well able to discount the flattery of the
worldly Duchess, but he drew a certain satisfaction from it
nevertheless; he trusted her, if not to tell the truth to him, at
least not to tell it to Eleanora either. He did not think that
from her would come any gossip or evil hint; Eleanora did not
know about his birth; he was sure that from the Duchess and those
whom she controlled, Eleanora would never know. And while the
talk grew louder round the table, Christian's thoughts flew
ahead: need Eleanora ever know? If he was ever Duke of Kurland
again, that damnable break in the line, that ghastly blot on his
descent, that hideous injustice and cruelty of his
birth&mdash;need that ever be known? When he blazoned all his
arms over the palaces in his duchy, there would be none who would
dare point out the absence of the bend sinister that should have
been there...</p>

<p>After this campaign, when he had crowned Leopold and taken his
reward, there would be nobody in all the world who would dare to
speak of his origin; at least, no one save those so obscure, vile
and base that no heed would be taken of them. Among kings and
princes and ruling sovereigns, he would take an admired and
brilliant place. Eleanora and his children&mdash;Eleanora's
children&mdash;need never know!</p>

<p>So far went his weakness, springing from his great
humiliation; sitting there among all these men who treated him as
more than an equal, who almost deferred to him as a superior,
Christian dared to dream like this&mdash;dared to hope that his
torment, his essential shame, might be blotted over and forgotten
in the dazzle of his achievements, in the safe splendour of his
happy marriage; not heeding, nor caring, what was said round the
table in those raucous voices, every moment getting louder, more
strident, even menacing, Christian remained turned in his chair,
staring at the cloud, the spires and the flags. He exulted in the
cloud&mdash;at the triumphant majesty of its march across the
sparkling blue of the untainted azure. There was a superb
conqueror, and there a mighty field of victory! Like a hero
marching, with trails of captured banners behind him, marching to
inevitable and supreme victory, that majestic cloud came on,
dominating the whole heaven.</p>

<p>Christian's visions out-topped the clouds. What plot of ground
was there large enough for the palace he would build? His soaring
colonnades would pierce the highest heavens with their crested
capitals; Mitau, the diamond and the city, he saw it as one,
glittering on the lap of the chosen woman. The Empire was too
narrow for the sweeping exultation of his gesture; towns, forts,
armies too petty to be pieces in the game he played; where in all
the globe was there anything superb enough to satisfy him, even
by a little?</p>

<p>Christian heard the scrape of chairs, the clatter of swords,
as the men rose, many of them heavily and awkwardly.</p>

<p>Leopold had entered the room. He stood, hesitant, inside the
door. That was his habit, which many men had remarked with
irritation&mdash;to remain always for a second reluctant on any
threshold.</p>

<p>But Christian, turning and rising also, though with a
leisurely movement, saw that Leopold's mood had changed. He was
no longer depressed, downcast, or distraught; but was certainly
braced and kindled&mdash;either by some inward thought or by some
outward event. He strode to the top of the table, and took his
place with an air which, till now, had been foreign to him. He
appeared to master these men, and impose his wish upon them,
though he smiled with his usual amiability. He had been carefully
valeted and barbered, and Christian approved his sumptuous
appearance in his flamboyant field-marshal's uniform; Christian
even thought that, if he maintained this amiable and gallant
demeanour, he might come to like, and even admire, him.</p>

<p>Leopold brushed some fine, almost invisible, dust from the
tips of his fingers&mdash;the remaining dust from the letter of
Eleanora which he had burnt at the taper: the supposed letter
from Eleanora&mdash;the letter which Gabor had composed in the
little room in the gables during that last night of fireworks and
huzzas.</p>

<p>Under the stiff military curls, heavy with pomade and powder,
Leopold's young features were pale, but resolute. He smiled
somewhat nervously it is true, yet joyously. Christian wondered,
not without a certain indifferent interest, what had happened to
the Emperor; and he thought vaguely of the Countess Carola, whose
dark thin elegance he had seen in the inner room while he had
spoken to the Archduchess Maria Luisa in the corridor.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia also seemed pleased by the Emperor's more
manly air; but he broached at once, and without tact, the subject
of the two defaulting generals, and put before His Majesty with a
certain brusquerie the full account of the two
disasters&mdash;that of Lech and that of Neuwied.</p>

<p>Leopold listened to the argument and read the reports without
understanding. The technical part of the sanguinary engagement
did not either impress or enlighten him; he blamed nobody for a
defeat or for failure; it was not in his disposition to do so;
his brows wrinkled, and he remarked:</p>

<p>"Certainly these are defeats; but I have no doubt that we can
repair them." And he smiled coldly towards Christian.</p>

<p>"Repair them first of all, Sire," remarked the King of
Prussia, "by making an example of these two generals."</p>

<p>Christian said nothing; he thought the Prussian was being
tactless and that it was all a waste of time. He glanced again at
that solitary and most noble cloud, making gorgeous progression
across the sky. And he thought of the wind humming through those
bare trees in his alleys, and the birds flashing through the
stripped branches; and Eleanora standing, feeding the deer with
little cakes of sugar and raisins. And as so he thought, and the
gay images piled so high and sweet in his heart that he laughed
suddenly, in sheer joy of heart.</p>

<p>All the men stopped their thick and crossing talk at this
sudden and curious interruption.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" asked Leopold, staring at him blankly.</p>

<p>And Christian glanced round the table and smiled at all of
them.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" repeated Leopold, insistently.</p>

<p>"Sire, because of a stray cloud," answered Christian; and,
taking up his pencil, he again went over the starry points of the
plan of Ath.</p>

<p>Leopold, nervously, thought there must be some meaning in
these queer words, or at least some meaning behind them; but
there was none; Christian meant exactly what he had said. He had
laughed at the sheer height of mounting spirit, with joy at the
cloud, with joy at his thoughts.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia put in, drily, taking snuff:</p>

<p>"Had we not best get on with the business?"</p>

<p>And Leopold, with an air of authority, said:</p>

<p>"Certainly, gentlemen, we had best get on with the
business!"</p>

<p>But his thoughts were far away, as those of Christian had
been&mdash;and in the same place. He was not thinking of what
these men said, nor greatly caring about the issues which hung
upon their decisions and his sanction. He was considering that
letter which he had just burnt, the ashes of which still clung
faintly to his fingers. He was wondering how he could again see
Gabor, and what manner of answer he should send to Eleanora.</p>

<p>He was well trained enough in public affairs to listen
courteously and with every appearance of attention, to say what
was expected of him, to acquiesce gracefully, and to defer with
becoming stately respect to his Commander-in-Chief. But
Christian, of all in that room, had the least to say. He did not
even press the matter of Guastalla and Olivenza; and Leopold also
allowed that hateful subject to drop, although the King of
Prussia brusquely brought it up more than once.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of noise in the room. The tall,
gleaming windows were closed, and on the marble hearth, beneath
the new burnished scrolls of an ornate mantelpiece and a mirror
surrounded by sprawling gilt figures, glittered and sparkled a
clear coal fire. The room had been newly decorated; all the
figures that smiled from ceiling and walls were vivid and
brilliant. The taste was cold and mannered, but bespoke
prosperity and the resolution to achieve magnificence. On either
side of the high doorway were pilasters formed of nymphs, whose
hair branched into huge flowers for the volutes. Christian
thought he saw in them twin Eleanoras. She also had seemed to him
to blossom in and out of flowers, as if she grew from flowers,
and in flowers disappeared; flowers round her feet and flowers in
her hair, herself a flower among them all!</p>

<p>The Council broke up. They had, after all, done nothing but
talk a great deal, and finally approved the plan which Christian
had worked out that night with his secretaries and set before
them. He had not debated or argued, nor asked their sufferance,
nor even showed boredom while they wasted time which must come to
but this one conclusion&mdash;approval of his design.</p>

<p>The cloud had marched away; the hollow dome of blue above
Berlin was empty.</p>

<p>Oh, lovely day! Was she walking now behind his colonnades,
looking down upon his bubbling fountains, caressing his
greyhounds that were like silver feathers? Was she roaming over
that vivid emerald grass, that remained so bright after a wet
summer? Was she breathing, as he, with deep delight this last
gold of fading autumn? A lovely day! And in the loveliness of the
day he seemed to meet her, whose beauty was part of
everything.</p>

<p>As he rose, Leopold spoke to him. He said, curiously: "You
have, Monseigneur, the air of a happy man!"</p>

<p>They had risen, and stood by the window; looking down, they
could both see the courtyard, where a double line of soldiery
waited for the coming-out of the Emperor. In the public square
beyond were more soldiers. The whole town was lively with martial
music, and the ringing sound of trampling feet; with drum and
clarion.</p>

<p>The cavalry went to and fro in the darkish, narrow side
streets; a clatter and their trumpets came faintly as Christian
lightly opened the window on the cool, brisk freshness of the
morning.</p>

<p>The whole scene had an air of pomp, of excess, of grandeur,
and, to Leopold at least, of emptiness. Neither the fluttering
flags nor the mounting spires, nor all this military parade, gave
him any confidence in himself; he must revert his thoughts back
to Ottenheim to regain any poise or peace of mind.</p>

<p>"I shall be happier," replied Christian, with his indifferent,
courteous air, "when Your Majesty is crowned at Frankfurt."</p>

<p>Leopold stared down at the alien town and the massed movements
of the soldiery as if he looked at a picture in another man's
life. Christian had no clue whatever to his thoughts.</p>

<p>"We start the campaign under a handicap," he remarked, "but I
do not doubt that we shall be successful. It is my intention,
Sire, to fight through the winter. The war has paltered on long
enough. It is my intention to bring it to an end before the
spring."</p>

<p>He was thinking of the spring at Ottenheim, and all the marvel
and lavishness of flowers by the Danube. And Leopold was thinking
of this too. Their glances met. Leopold's blue eyes fell
guiltily, while Christian remained serene. He had no cause to
drop his eyes; he was single-minded and single-hearted; prepared
to meet a world of foes at arms.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="first">THE Duchess of Schönbuchel moped in Ottenheim.
Usually, at this time of the year, she was in Vienna, where she
found a great deal of enjoyment and amusement. She could not
recall having once, during her long life, spent the winter in the
country; and she regarded the coming prospect with some
foreboding. If she must stay away from the capital, she would
rather have stayed at her own Château of Dürsheim than among
these alien magnificences where life ran so stagnantly. She was a
connoisseur in news and gossip, and neither news nor gossip came
very frequently to Ottenheim. Now the war had recommenced, the
posts were interrupted, the roads often blocked; delays were
tedious and considerable; yet the Duchess had no thought of
abandoning her post. Apart from her promise to Christian, which
she regarded quite seriously, her affection for Eleanora held her
there, as guardian and companion of a girl so dangerously
ignorant and so dangerously highly placed.</p>

<p>The Duchess got what consolation she could out of Colonel
Pons, but he, also, was dreary, and mostly in an ill humour; he
found his post one of those vexatious and galling honours which
irritate more than they glorify. Now that the war had again
begun, he wished to be in the thick of the coming engagements;
and he had written to Christian asking him to relieve him of the
onerous yet dull post at Ottenheim. There was, he said, no need
for his presence in the Château, where everything went with
monotonous smoothness. There was the majordomo and the steward;
there were the officers of the garrison&mdash;all well tried and
faithful people. He could not see the necessity for his constant
presence there.</p>

<p>Christian had written back immediately: "There may he a great
many devoted and faithful people in my service, my dear Pons; but
no one to equal you in judgment, energy and sagacity. You will,
therefore, remain at Ottenheim."</p>

<p>Pons had received this mandate gloomily. It was his first
taste of secluded leisure, and he did not at all relish it. By
the time he and the Duchess had exchanged all their old stories,
and their cynic opinion of their contemporaries, there was
nothing much left to do but fret through the days, and worry
because no news came.</p>

<p>Christian wrote regularly enough; but he had little to say of
public events. If he did not write himself his secretaries sent
minute instructions as to the regulation of the estate. But Pons
and the Duchess wanted to know about the war, all the excitement
and scandal of the camp.</p>

<p>The tale of Guastalla's and Olivenza's defeat dribbled
through, and the Duchess was deeply vexed by the last of these
disasters. The gaunt Spaniard had been a friend of her childhood.
She wrote him a letter of sympathy, of kindness. At the same
time, she shuddered a little for her complete safety, and for the
snugly tucked-away estate of hers which might yet be drawn into
the theatre of war.</p>

<p>Colonel Pons assured her, with melancholy dryness, that they
were perfectly safe at Ottenheim. Whatever the issue of the
coming campaign, they would not be touched there on the banks of
the Danube; the issue would lie in Flanders.</p>

<p>The Duchess was not so sure; she thought of the Turks and
Hungarians behind, of possible advances and assaults on Vienna;
the long inaction of the days added strength to these vain
terrors.</p>

<p>But Eleanora was happy at Ottenheim. Her lessons had ceased,
the masters were gone, the girl was suddenly independent,
deferred to, respected and admired; the very atmosphere was full
of adulation. The surroundings were to her like the surroundings
of enchantment in some of the fairy tales which she so enjoyed
reading. After the commonplace home which she had been used to,
both in Anhalt-Dessau and at Dürsheim, this had a touch of
delicious unreality. She liked the colonnaded terraces, the high
rooms hung with silk and brocades and gilded leather. She liked
the plumy fountains, so strong that they bore gilded balls on
their transparent crests, dancing them up and down in an endless,
crystal arch. She liked the <i>allées</i>, so long and straight,
where the distance lay, like a glimpse of blue sea, at the far
end; she liked the windings of the river, which seemed here so
much more noble and sumptuous than it had seemed from the narrow
windows of Dürsheim. She was pleased and excited, too, by the
garrison&mdash;the Polanders, with their shaved heads and fierce
moustaches, and fur pelisses and corded casques; and the negroes,
from Cayenne and New Guinea, with their women, who wore crowns of
bright feathers and stiff necklaces of translucent beads;
scarlet, black and orange with painted shells.</p>

<p>The Duchess had looked with rigid disfavour upon these
heathens, but was mollified on discovering that they all gathered
in the chapel on Sunday, listening decorously to the Lutheran
service now held under the aspiring tracery raised for Papist
worship.</p>

<p>It delighted Eleanora to see these brilliant soldiers going to
and fro, to see them exercising in the great Court of Honour, to
hear their trumpets early in the morning and late at night; she
was shyly pleased at their deferential salutes, their air of
standing aside and looking away when she passed, as if she were a
goddess, blonde and frail amidst their strength and darkness.</p>

<p>She found Colonel Pons far kinder than her father had ever
been, and, for the first time in her life, she was able to give
orders to servants&mdash;see people hurry to do her bidding,
eager to anticipate her wishes.</p>

<p>She might read what books she liked; she might walk abroad
when she liked; there was a little chariot that took her down the
shining road to the river; there was a white horse she could ride
in the park; Eleanora did not find the days long.</p>

<p>Christian did not write to her, but the Duchess always showed
her his letters, wherein he wrote of gifts he had bought for
her&mdash;a Michelin flounce in Berlin; a pair of Sevres vases; a
great fan of ashy-grey herons' plumes, mounted in silver: these
things he had bought for her, and they were coming when the roads
were clear. There were dresses, and jewellery too, to arrive from
Vienna and Paris. Christian knew where to buy such clothes as
would best befit Eleanora. He was well acquainted with the most
elegant of the shops in the Palais Royal; he sent the Duchess
lists of the parcels she might expect. Eleanora blushed and
smiled to read them. Her feeling was exactly the feeling of a
child promised new toys&mdash;gorgeous and unexpected toys.</p>

<p>In those last days, like amber and honey, of autumn, that
Christian had watched from Berlin, Princess Eleanora felt her
heart light enough as she walked through the long, cool corridors
at Ottenheim, or wandered in the park, where, on the bare trees,
the sun was so strong that the light of its rays seemed like a
last golden foliage on the crisp boughs.</p>

<p>Every part of the Château had been prepared for her; nothing
was left that showed that any other woman had ever moved through
the elegant rooms, or reposed on the satin couches. The light,
frivolous French books, lilies and tulips stamped in gilt on
their slim, glossy backs, had all been removed, and Eleanora,
flitting round the library, found only heavy tomes on mathematics
and tactics, Vauban, Catinat, Koehorn, which she did not even
open. All the worldly and seductive pictures had gone also; there
but remained noble landscapes, with dreamy azure perspectives
stretching away, fading behind graceful slim temples, with
towering trees and enclosing wreaths of elegant blossoms. And
portraits: portraits of Christian and of his father, and of his
friends&mdash;those men under whom he had served and those who
had served under him; Christian as a boy, in a satin skirt and
lace cap, holding a parrot; Christian as a young man, in a lawn
shirt and a cobalt sash, and a Roman robe arranged like a toga;
Christian, in full damascened armour, with a battle scene behind
him, and with a black and white dog jumping up; Christian
standing in an arcade with his chief huntsman, holding an inlaid
silver fowling piece; Christian in an embroidered bedgown
drinking chocolate with a nephrite vase in the background.
Eleanora looked at all these pictures with some curiosity. There
was a picture of Christian's father, too&mdash;the handsome,
rapacious Duke of Kurland; and the girl ingenuously remarked on
the absence of any picture of Christian's mother; where was the
late Duchess' presentment?</p>

<p>"She died young," replied the Duchess, evasively; and in her
heart she hoped that Christian's mother was dead. She had not
heard for many years of this lady, who, for all she knew, might
be still ranting on the boards of some Venetian or Milanese
theatre, singing behind a mask of carnival, in festooned hoops
and tinsel garlands. She fervently prayed that this was not so,
and that a grave or a convent had swallowed the adventuress in
that swift obscurity that too often follows swift brilliance.</p>

<p>But Eleanora did not let the subject go; she asked about
Christian's family&mdash;if he had had brothers or
sisters&mdash;and when the Duchess said "No" to this, again about
his mother. "She was an Italian princess," said the Duchess,
lying deeply; and Eleanora was surprised that no more was added
to this statement, for well she knew how the old lady delighted
in pedigrees and coats of arms, and how she usually had at her
fingertips the genealogy of everybody mentioned, and their
intricate relationships with other princes and potentates, and
with herself.</p>

<p>One worldly picture had been left, overlooked in the corridor
that led to the theatre&mdash;a disused place now. But Eleanora
chanced one day to wander there; and clear in the golden sunshine
that streamed through the tall window was this great gaudy
canvas, <i>The Magdalene Returning to the Pleasures of the
World</i>, by a Venetian painter.</p>

<p>Eleanora had never seen anything like this before, and she
stood fascinated, looking at the rich, idle, languorous and
voluptuous scene; the beautiful, half-clothed women beneath the
thick flowering trees. Their wine was served in gold and silver,
and fruit on crystal and painted porcelain; in the gorgeous sky,
which looked hot and metallic, were twisted amorous divinities,
amid coils of coral-coloured, curling clouds; and through
thickets of forced, fleshy flowers, curved and shaped like cups
filled with overflowing nectar, moved peacocks and leopards
wearing gemmed collars and high mounting diadems.</p>

<p>Under a scarlet pavilion surrounded by cavaliers, who seemed
grave with delight and fatigued by pleasure, sat the Magdalene,
covered only by the finest of lawn veils, but crowned again and
again with the braids of her own pale hair, with knots and loops
of pearls, with silver horns like those of the crescent moon,
from which depended glittering diamonds; so she lay in a noontide
trance while the men surveyed her with quelled but unquenchable
passion.</p>

<p>There was a lake in the foreground, filled by the shadows of
mountains and the glitter of distant castles; and from this lake
pages dipped up clear water, which ran back from the wide lips of
their ewers, in among the transparent leaves of the curling
water-flags.</p>

<p>Eleanora looked long at this enticing picture, but she did not
speak of it; she felt that childish sense of having looked at a
thing forbidden, and she believed that if the Duchess knew of it,
she would have it taken away or covered up.</p>

<p>All the flowers had withered from the garden and the park; the
parterres were devoid of bloom. Only along the banks of the
Danube was the blue speedwell, very late this year, and vivid as
the skies of the dead summer. The exotic birds that Christian had
thought of with so much pleasure had died with the first breath
of frost. The keepers tried to catch them in gilded cages, and
hang them up inside the Château; but they preferred death to this
confinement, and one by one, like perished jewels, fell from the
rigid branches of the trees, their crests folded back; their
plumage drooping, and yet another gem added to their gay array in
a bright drop of blood which stained their gaping, delicate
beaks.</p>

<p>Eleanora received their dead, rich beauty with tears of pity;
their veiled eyes, their stiff claws gave her a pang of remorse.
She said that it was wicked to bring them from Brazil and Mexico
to perish thus with the first frost of winter; and she stood for
hours underneath the bare trees with sweet cakes and corn in her
hands, endeavouring to coax into safety the other truants, who
would not even look at her, but remained flashing through the
stripped trees until they, too, dropped perished at her feet,
with a last flash of colour, a last reluctant resignation to the
sadness of death.</p>

<p>The orange deer and the Indian gazelles also pined and died
with the cold, although many of them were taken into the stables,
and warmed and fed on hot milk. Their enormous eyes looked
mournfully at Eleanora, with all the pathos of exiles; without
complaint they died.</p>

<p>The park began to be bare; there were few birds and few
animals, and no trees or flowers. Even those queer and monstrous
beasts safely established in the zoological park, where they had
elegant stables and a castle, a lake and every comfort, began to
look forlorn and melancholy.</p>

<p>"Such odd beasts are a senseless extravagance," remarked the
Duchess, who was thankful that she had never wasted her money on
such an idle and unsatisfactory luxury.</p>

<p>But Eleanora was troubled. This was the sole flaw in her
pleasure, this perishing of the birds and beasts with the first
insidious touch of northern frost.</p>

<p>The Duchess felt it her duty to enlighten her ward and charge
in worldly affairs. She tried to talk about the war, although she
was not very interested in this herself, and she felt it to be so
intricate and confused that she could scarcely explain it; there
had always been a war, as long as she could remember, and all the
men of her family, and acquaintance, had always been engaged in
war.</p>

<p>It was a thing you took for granted, yet found rather
difficult to expound; she was so used to great cities changing
hands, frontiers shifting their places, armies advancing here and
there, to the Empire being split and ravaged, by Christian and
Turk alike; she tried to talk of these affairs to Eleanora, who
had listened willingly enough at first, but presently yawned, and
said that these times were dull. It was not like the old days,
when there were knights! These wars were tedious and wearisome,
she declared. The long campaigns, the long sieges, the long waits
in winter quarters, the endless movements of heavy bodies of
troops...the Duchess began to yawn too, as she thought of all
that tedium.</p>

<p>"Well, it's men's business, and we must leave it to the men,"
she concluded. "But we hope that the Emperor will come out
successful in this campaign, and then there will be peace for a
little while. It would be very agreeable if the campaign could
end before the winter," she added; "then we might have a pleasant
time in Vienna."</p>

<p>Eleanora also very much wished to go to Vienna. She had never
seen any town bigger than Dessau. This was the excuse she gave
herself, the longing to see the capital; but she wished to see
Leopold again, wished to see him crowned and robed&mdash;Caesar
indeed!</p>

<p>"Shall I go to the coronation of the Emperor?" she asked,
courageously.</p>

<p>And the Duchess said: "Yes, indeed, of course you will go, as
Princess Christian of Kurland, with a coronet on your head, and
an ermine gown, with a purple velvet train."</p>

<p>"And then shall we go to Kurland?" asked Eleanora,
wonderingly. The whole of her future life seemed utterly strange
and alien. Kurland was to her only a name on the map, far away,
and cold, surely.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," replied the Duchess, evasive as always, when
Kurland, or Christian, or his family were spoken of. "That will
depend on what is arranged between the Emperor and the King of
Prussia&mdash;and your husband. I don't know, Eleanora, how they
will parcel out their rewards and estates."</p>

<p>"But we shall not always stay here?" asked Eleanora.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried the Duchess. "This is a mere country villa.
You will certainly not stay here. If you do not go to Kurland you
will go to Vienna. There will be many diversions&mdash;the opera,
and the ballet, and the theatre. And concerts at the Hofburg; and
there you will meet the Archduchess Maria Luisa, who is a
charming princess; and many other ladies of your own rank. And I
suppose," she added, carefully, and with an exact deliberation,
"that by the time the campaign is over, a wife will have been
found for the Emperor. He cannot have a Court without an Empress,
you know!" And she smiled rather foolishly at Eleanora, because
she felt foolish in face of the girl's single-minded sincerity.
She knew that romance of Captain Leopold at Dürsheim, and the
walk under the beech trees; she knew, too, that the episode,
light as featherdown as it was, might linger long in the mind of
a child like Eleanora. She saw by the cloud that passed over the
girl's candid face that it <i>had</i> lingered.</p>

<p>"Who will be the Empress?" asked Eleanora.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the Duchess. "Some German princess, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"German princess?" repeated Eleanora.</p>

<p>And for the first time it faintly occurred to her that
possibly, just possibly, Leopold might have come to Dürsheim to
ask for her hand.</p>

<p>She did not dare demand of the Duchess if this was true; but
the thought had come into her mind, and would not be easily
banished. <i>She</i> was a German princess; she had often heard
her father say that her rank and her pretensions were high. If
the Emperor had wished to marry a German princess, he might even
have wished to marry her.</p>

<p>"You had better write to your husband," said the Duchess,
hastily. "I think that it is time you did; he has been away some
weeks now, and I am weary of these long letters which I must send
to him. It is time, my dear, that <i>you</i> took up the pen and
wrote something."</p>

<p>"But I have nothing to write," said Eleanora, simply. "I do
not even know how to address him."</p>

<p>This was true. She was quite incapable of composing the letter
that Gabor had forged in his high room in Berlin, as Leopold
might have guessed, if he had known more of her; if, indeed, he
had known more of any woman. Had he not been as simple-minded as
she was herself, never could he have believed that that letter
had been composed by the Princess Eleanora.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Duchess, impatiently, rather overwhelmed by
so much ingenuous simplicity, "well, you may write and thank him
for the presents which he says he has bought for you."</p>

<p>"But they are not here yet," said Eleanora.</p>

<p>"Never mind; you can say that you are grateful to him for
buying them. You can wish him success in the campaign. And
surely, my dear child, you can compose a few lines?" She finished
rather at a loss, and she thought to herself: "Really, the child
has been brought up very badly, in a most peculiar fashion. She
knows nothing, and it seems impossible to teach her!"</p>

<p>"You must realize," she said, feebly, "that you are married,
Eleanora."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't seem to make any difference, being married!"
replied the girl.</p>

<p>"It will make a good deal of difference later on," said the
Duchess, shortly. "It's time you got used to it."</p>

<p>And she knew she spoke foolishly indeed, for there had been
little change in the girl's life made by her marriage with
Christian, for all this strange and outward show. She was still
the dreaming Eleanora, the schoolgirl of Dürsheim. Nothing had
occurred to wake her from her dreams, or change their direction.
And all day and all night, these dreams were filled by the figure
of Leopold. Vague was this shadowy figure; far off and
indefinite, but always there. And of Christian she thought not at
all, save with a certain trembling terror and a hope that it
would be long before he returned.</p>

<p>The Duchess tried to speak of him; to say that he was a great
man, and would be a greater man yet. Eleanora listened dutifully,
but these praises did not touch her; she had felt very childish
and foolish in Christian's presence; he had seemed to her to
ignore her, as a mere trifle. Never had she felt so small in her
own estimation as when Christian had looked at and spoken to her;
even on the morning when he had given her the diamonds he had
seemed alarming.</p>

<p>With Leopold it had been different; he had been warm and kind,
softness in his looks and in his voice; he had felt the rapture
of the woods; he would have been a gallant playfellow, a charming
knight...and he was the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Duchess guessed her mood and could do little to change it;
she was old and weary; she had not the courage to explore the
recesses of that candid mind, the secrets of that innocent heart,
that facile shallow nature.</p>

<p>"I've no doubt," she reflected rather sourly to herself, "that
Christian is quite capable of doing his own wooing when he
returns. And as for Leopold, of course he will forget, to say
nothing of the Countess Carola, who, I have no doubt, will now
have got hold of him again&mdash;bold-faced minx that she is,
with her intriguing old husband and her air of virtue!"</p>

<p>Eleanora did not write to Christian, though she sent dutiful
billets to her father, in which she mentioned how the foreign
birds were dying and the exotic animals languishing; how the
speedwell was blue on the bank of the Danube, and how she was
well and happy in the rather chill splendours of Ottenheim,
longing for the war to be over, yearning for the spring.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would go riding with Colonel Pons to the far
confines of the noble estate and look curiously at the peasants,
going to and fro and taking in the harvest: a poor harvest this
year, with few to gather it in.</p>

<p>"War seems a wicked and a wasteful thing," she sighed, "and I
do not understand why it need be. Why, the Duchess says there's
always been a war&mdash;as long as she can remember!"</p>

<p>The old soldier smiled indulgently; he was anxious about the
next news from Christian. He knew well enough that this was going
to be a difficult matter, even for a soldier like Christian, to
tackle; the Allies were strong, and flushed with success; the
Imperial troops were scattered, and disheartened by those first
two reverses; and Leopold was no man to know how to handle such a
crisis.</p>

<p>Christian had been so far invincible. But even invincible
heroes were sometimes brought down by the misfortune of
complicated circumstances. As they returned through the park,
where the blue speedwell still lingered in the fading grass, they
heard the clear trumpets of the negro hussars.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were a prisoner!" smiled Eleanora, lightly,
"and those were my guards."</p>

<p>Colonel Pons said:</p>

<p>"I am to get whatever you wish for."</p>

<p>Eleanora wondered if there was not something for which she
could ask. The other day, when she had been at Dürsheim, the day
before, when she had been at Anhalt-Dessau, there had been so
much she wanted! But now there was nothing: every childish wish
and delicate desire had been gratified.</p>

<p>"I think I should like to go away," she mused, still smiling.
"I'm getting tired of the Danube, though it is very agreeable
here."</p>

<p>"That is impossible," said Pons. "I, too, Madame, should like
to go away; but it is Prince Christian's orders that we remain
until the campaign is over."</p>

<p>"And must we obey his orders?" she asked, simply.

<p>"We must, Madame, I am his soldier, and you are his wife."</p>

<p>Eleanora's plump little hands caressed the two green diamonds
that hung on the masculine cravat of her riding-habit. She always
wore these delicious jewels, for they were the most beautiful
things she had ever seen&mdash;so different from the hard, heavy,
flashing gems with which her father and the Duchess had adorned
her; the old-fashioned ornaments of the rigid court days of long
ago.</p>

<p>The bulging blue eyes of Colonel Pons regarded her sideways.
He had grown fond of the girl, and wished her well: he hoped that
she would be happy with Prince Christian. In quite a simple,
paternal way he felt interested in her future, which to most men
would have looked so strange and dubious.</p>

<p>"You should write to Prince Christian," he suggested.

<p>"He sends so frequently; but never to me!" smiled Eleanora.
"And, as I have already told the Duchess, I should not know what
to say."</p>

<p>"Still, write!" grinned Pons. "I can assure you it would be
appreciated."</p>

<p>So Eleanora went to her gorgeous room that mellow autumn
afternoon, and sat still in her riding habit, biting her quill
pen and frowning out at the melting azure silver of the prospect.
Finally, she achieved a few lines.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur: I am very well here, and all is prosperous, save
some of your foreign birds have died: for which I am sorry. I
shall be glad when the war is over and the Emperor is crowned."
(It gave her pleasure to write that; she lingered over that line.
The Emperor! Captain Leopold!) "I think the winter is late in
coming; they are taking in the harvest. I hope you are in good
health, and have agreeable news. I remain, Monseigneur, with all
respect and duty, ELEANORA"&mdash;"of Anhalt-Dessau" she was
going to write; but she changed it, though with an odd sense of
queerness, into "OF KURLAND."</p>

<p>The Duchess thought this letter very silly, but reflected
there was no telling what would please a man in love. The veriest
trifle might give him delight. So she enclosed it with her own
flowing, polished and courtly epistle and sent it by the next
messenger to Christian.</p>

<p>The days drifted slow, gold and silver, as the river drifted
past the rocks, the woods, the Château. The orange and citron
trees that stood in front of the long balustrades of the palace
were taken in, and put into the orangery for the winter. Great
fires were built up on all the wide, generous hearths, and cast
warm-coloured lights over the marble mantelpiece.</p>

<p>The Duchess shivered at the approach of winter though she had
to admit that she was comfortably housed and well prepared to
bear the most rigorous assaults of the season. Colonel Pons
fretted at his inaction, and rigorously reviewed the gaudy little
garrison. In the evenings he played chess or faro with the
Duchess, while Eleanora read from her large calf books, or sewed
with her tiny needle and fine thread. She always went to bed
early, and then Pons and the Duchess would gossip over Arabian
glasses of rich wine, flavoured with nutmeg and cinnamon. Pons
was always cautious what he said about Christian, but still the
Duchess tried to draw from him many anecdotes of his master's
past life, most of which afforded her a good deal of chuckling
amusement, and many of which increased her already vivid
admiration for that mighty soldier.</p>

<p>Every one in Ottenheim was in perpetual readiness for news of
the campaign; the corn sheaves were cleared from the dark flank
of the hill, above the big, silver whiteness of the river, and,
through the boughs of the distant forest, yet more distant hills
could now be clearly seen. The Duchess and Pons wearied of the
incessant beauty of the prospect from the wide, high windows; but
Eleanora, waiting for she knew not what in Ottenheim, was still
happy, with a vague, colourless happiness, and asked no more than
the smooth running of the day, and the deep dreaming of the
night. Sometimes she played her spinet, trying to keep time to
the rhythm of the tossing spray of the fountain beneath her
window; and sometimes she sang, either fragments of courtly
music, or echoes of those rustic songs the gleaners chanted above
their labours when the day was ended.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">CHRISTIAN advanced rapidly with his entire
forces; he left Prince Anhalt-Dessau to fortify and guard his own
tiny domain, and spread his troops out fanshape, some to hold
back the English from the frontiers of Anhalt, some to front and
force back the victorious Carfax in Nassau and the Palatinate on
to the borders of Lorraine, where the French waited to fall upon
them.</p>

<p>With his main body, he pushed across Westphalia, with Brussels
as his ultimate objective. Knittelfeldt and Fürth were in command
of these two armies which he thus set to the right and left,
while he remained in chief command of the main army advancing on
the Spanish Netherlands.</p>

<p>Olivenza, with the remnants of his army, had struggled up as
far as Cassel, and there remained, giving an indifferent ear to
the messages which reached him from the Generalissimo. He
produced neither denials nor excuses with which to screen his
failure, but comported himself with the greatest insolence,
scarcely disguising the fact that, out of resentment at the
promotion of Christian to be Generalissimo of the Imperial
Forces, he had encouraged the slackness which had led to his
defeat, had purposely engineered the long delay which had brought
about his disaster.</p>

<p>Receiving the peremptory commands of Christian while he sat
idling with an actress from Vienna, who had come to share and to
soothe his defeated leisure, Olivenza had expressed himself
bitterly about the Kurlander. Touching the sleek spaniel at his
feet, he had used an ugly word for Christian; an uglier word for
his mother, saying: "My dog is better born than he."</p>

<p>No one, of course, had dared to repeat such outrageous insults
to Christian, but the flavour and sense of what Olivenza had said
was conveyed to him. It did not alter his action, for that had
been already planned. Two days afterwards, Olivenza was arrested,
and the Maréchal de Châterault put in charge of his dispirited
and decimated troops, which were taken rapidly down to join
Knittelfeldt on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Guastalla had comported himself with the same arrogance; he
scarcely troubled to clear himself of a charge of accepting money
from the enemy; his attitude was one of disdain. He scarcely
professed any loyalty to Leopold. He would not, he said, fight
under a mercenary like Christian&mdash;a man of no birth, and
young enough to be his son. He fell back in straggling, broken
lines before the advance of the enemy, leaving what remained to
him of baggage and artillery behind him piece by piece, until he
joined the main line of the Imperial Armies marching towards the
lines of the Allies which defended Brussels and the frontiers of
the Spanish Netherlands. Here he also was arrested, and sent
under heavy escort with Olivenza to Vienna. The rage and dismay
of these two generals was extreme; Guastalla, asking for pen and
paper, wrote one line to the Emperor: "Sire, I was your father's
friend." Olivenza sent a long, complaining despatch to the King
of Spain, his master, bitterly exonerating himself, and bitterly
blaming that upstart Christian, who by some vile means had
contrived to obtain command of the Imperial Forces.</p>

<p>They were allowed to send these letters, but no notice was
taken of their protests or lamentations; they lodged in strict
confinement in Vienna.</p>

<p>All this was done with the warm approbation of Maréchal De
Lisle, and of the other members of the Council of
War&mdash;Fürth, Châterault, Arroya, and Knittelfeldt: all men
who believed in, if they did not greatly like, Christian, and who
were not displeased to have an opportunity of ridding themselves
of rivals in the persons of Guastalla and Olivenza, both men who
were not greatly beloved, and who had always wantonly and openly
worked for their own interests.</p>

<p>Leopold, however, was kept in ignorance of the whole affair.
Hensdorff, who accompanied the army, knew that he would not
approve of this unavoidable episode and had asked Christian not
to broach it to the Emperor. Christian had done what he had
intended to do, and ridded himself of the two defaulting
generals; he was quite willing not to annoy Leopold with this
news, which could not, however, long be kept from the Emperor.
Both the disgraced generals had their relations in the army, and
the murmurs of these somehow came to the ears of Leopold by the
time their forced marches had brought them to the banks of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>The Imperial Army stretched from Limburg; the Emperor had his
temporary headquarters at Sieburg. They were now facing the
enemy, a detachment of whom still remained at Neuwied, where
Guastalla had been defeated. These rapid movements seemed to have
disconcerted the Allies, who had made no effort to stop the
progress of the Imperialists, even, in some parts, having fallen
back within their own lines; they seemed to be forsaking the
defences in every direction and concentrating on the potent forts
that protected their conquests in the Spanish Netherlands.</p>

<p>Leopold, in incredulous anger at the disgrace of his two
generals, sent for Hensdorff, and hotly demanded the truth;
Hensdorff was weary of hearing that word "truth." It seemed to
him the most disagreeable one in any language. He knew that
Leopold was going to be difficult, and he felt that he could not
endure any one being difficult at this most important juncture of
the campaign.</p>

<p>"Let us, Sire," he entreated, "leave this discussion until
later; we have neither patience, time nor energy to waste in
futilities now."</p>

<p>"This is no futility," replied Leopold, in a wrangling tone.
"I hear that, behind my back, these two gentlemen have been
disgraced and sent under arrest to Vienna."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true," admitted Hensdorff, with an air of
resignation, "and I must beg to remind Your Majesty that the full
command of your forces has been given to Prince Christian."</p>

<p>"It is impossible, though," replied Leopold, "that he has the
power to act thus."</p>

<p>"It is very possible," said Hensdorff, wearily. "He has indeed
the power of life and death over all Your Majesty's troops. You
must recall the terms under which he took up this position. They
were the best terms I could make, Sire, and we at the time were
thankful to get them."</p>

<p>At this most unfortunate moment, Guastalla's laconic letter
was brought to Leopold. As he read the one line&mdash;"Sire, I
was your father's friend"&mdash;Leopold blushed till the blood
throbbed in his lowering face. Never, even on the day of the
banquet in Berlin, had he felt so degraded. These men had trusted
in him, and he had been considered by Christian of so little
importance that he had not even known of their calamities.</p>

<p>"Why was I not told this?" he demanded, aghast, crushing
together the letter passionately. "Count Guastalla has had to
remind me that he was my father's friend."</p>

<p>"I fear," said Count Hensdorff, drily, "that he has not proved
himself a friend to Your present Majesty; and as to why you were
not told, no doubt His Highness did not wish to disturb Your
Majesty's peace of mind. The duty had to be discharged, and it
was best discharged quietly and secretly."</p>

<p>But Leopold would listen to no excuses. He immediately ordered
one of his aides-de-camp to bring Christian into his presence. He
had been fearfully and bitterly wounded; the more so as this was
the first open discord between himself and his Generalissimo. He
had left everything to Christian; he had even flattered
Christian, and turned to him, and leant on him, glad that there
was a man there to face his responsibilities; grateful to
Christian for not exposing him for what he was&mdash;a leader
without decision or energy.</p>

<p>Leopold was, above everything, indolent. He was almost
incapable of making the solid exertions required of him, and he
was thankful that Christian had taken these exertions upon his
own capable shoulders, and left him the splendour only of empty
figurehead.</p>

<p>Often he had thought to himself: "Is it possible that I am
fawning on this man, after all that has happened, and all that I
intend shall happen? Is it possible that I fawn on him?"</p>

<p>But he had flattered and complimented Christian; he had tried
to win him with those facile courtesies which came so easily to
him&mdash;which were part, not only of his nature, but of his
training. He had praised his Generalissimo before the Frenchmen,
before the Austrians and Spaniards; he had given him, on every
possible occasion, full honour and precedence. This had cost him
nothing; such actions came easily to the Bavarian. And though he
had, in his heart, secretly despised himself for such
complaisance, he had continued to use graceful blandishments on
the man on whom all his destiny depended, though sometimes he had
wondered to himself: "How can I do this, when my thoughts are
full of Eleanora, hidden away in Ottenheim?" Still he had done
it, because it had been the easiest and the pleasantest
method.</p>

<p>Christian had undertaken all the duties of the campaign, and
spared Leopold every possible task and fatigue. Leopold, with
every day, disliked warfare more and more. He could not endure
the parades, the marches, the reviews, the encampments, the
raiding of the camps, the entries and the leavings of towns, the
meeting of deputations, the sittings of councils of war, the
consultations, the studyings of maps, the reading of spiel
reports, and the long letters of agents. He had gone through all
this business mechanically, with no zest and little interest, and
often in complete ignorance of what he saw or signed; always
Christian had been there, to support and guide him. In every
instance he had leant upon Christian, upon his lucid intelligence
and his rapid judgment, upon his calm decisions, upon his
impenetrable air of authority. For himself, he had this many day
past been weary of the mere sight of the army, nauseated by the
sound of the tramp of feet, and of the hoofs of horses,
intolerant of the sound of trumpets and drums, and of the sight
of banners and colours. When riding all day between harvests,
down the long roads lined by apple trees, in the warm dark of
woods, and under their bare boughs, the monotonous lessons of his
childhood had occurred to him with maddening persistency.</p>

<p>Six men a file, four files a squadron; two squadrons a wing;
three wings a battalion; pikes in the middle, musketeers at the
side, in between the drums and trumpets; pikes seventeen feet
long, with carps' tongues' heads, men armed with gauntlets of
steel, back and front steel again, steel laced into their
helmets; companies of one hundred and fifty men; regiments of ten
companies, fifteen hundred men; staff officers riding in compact
glitter, the baggage wagons, the artillery, the
<i>vivandières</i>, the tents, the chariots, the reserve
horses&mdash;all these in one long procession, winding onwards by
forced marches, pushing forward day and night, snatching a little
repose now and then in inconvenient and often barbarous
lodgings&mdash;all this Leopold had endured, day after day, and
with every hour detested it more.</p>

<p>He sourly recalled all this now as he waited for Christian,
who had spared him all the trouble and responsibility of these
pompous and energetic movements; and he remembered how he had
flattered the man for this&mdash;been grateful to him for sparing
him trouble and exalting his dignity at no cost to himself. And
all the while he had been laughed at! His two generals, his two
friends, had been arrested without his knowledge, without his
hearing of their plight, or being allowed to listen to their
justification or appeal.</p>

<p>He had been disdained as a fool and a puppet! Certainly, he
had found it agreeable and easy to act the part of a fool and a
puppet; but now his position was brought home to him in this
manner, he found it detestable. He loathed himself little less
than he loathed Christian. Only with relish and delight did he
remember Eleanora, safe in Ottenheim.</p>

<p>Christian entered, with his usual serene air of respect.</p>

<p>He had not wished to wait upon the Emperor at this moment, for
his hands were full. At the same time, he had no air of hurry or
excitement. He waited quietly for what Leopold had to say. He did
not believe that any words of the Emperor's could be of the least
importance, but it was part of his duty to listen to them; and he
always performed his duty with a good grace.</p>

<p>Leopold eyed him with abhorrence, and at once broke into the
business in hand.</p>

<p>"I have just heard about Count Guastalla and the Duke of
Olivenza," he said; "prisoners in Vienna."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sire," said Christian. "They are safely in Vienna.
Had I known Your Majesty attached any importance to the matter,
you would have been informed before."</p>

<p>"Those are mere words," said Leopold, angrily. "You knew that
I did attach importance to this affair."</p>

<p>Christian replied, not as if he were justifying himself, but
as if he merely stated facts, that the men were incapable and
insolent. "Guastalla at least was insubordinate; he was wilfully
leaving his valuable baggage and artillery to fall into the hands
of the enemy, while he fell back, surrendering post after post.
Olivenza, too, conducted himself with the greatest insolence. It
was impossible to do otherwise than to arrest them both. When the
campaign is over Your Majesty may deal with them."</p>

<p>"I shall deal with them now," said Leopold, rudely. "I shall
at once order them to be released; I shall have their commands
restored to them; I have been palpably deceived."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, he knew he spoke in weakness. Christian's
wish, not his, was the one that was obeyed in the army. Every one
in all his troops, to a man, was behind Christian. What he said
would scarcely be listened to.</p>

<p>"That is impossible," replied Christian, briefly; "absolutely
impossible, Sire: those gentlemen, like many another in Your
Majesty's service, only have their position through reason of
their birth. They are in every way inefficient, disaffected and
incapable."</p>

<p>"I do not know the details of their misfortune," protested
Leopold, his hostility aggravated by the other's patience.</p>

<p>"But I do," answered Christian. "They have all been put before
the Council of War&mdash;and when Your Majesty was present. I do
not think, Sire, you care to listen to details such as
these."</p>

<p>"It was not when I was present," said Leopold. "You know quite
well that this whole matter has been conducted behind my
back."</p>

<p>"It is idle," said Christian, calmly, "to go into the affair
now, Sire; we have our hands full. By the defeats of these two
gentlemen, I have been considerably hampered, and I have not been
greatly helped in other directions. My plan of campaign pretends
a considerable superiority of troops on my part. That was the
principle on which everything was founded&mdash;that and the
presence of the Emperor," he added, with a smile. "What I asked
for, and what I was promised, I have not received. The King of
Prussia is becoming exasperated. We are weak in light troops. I
asked for a hundred and twenty battalions, and I have only
received a hundred, of those only ninety-two trained troops, the
rest mere raw levies. I should have, Sire, at least another
thirty battalions of tried men; forty squadrons of cavalry and
five of dragoons have come up from Flanders, but even these do
not augment my forces to the number which I could wish."</p>

<p>"It is useless for Your Highness," said Leopold, sullenly, "to
give me these details now. I have done all I can."</p>

<p>"That I know," said Christian, still smiling; "that is the
worst part of my misfortune, that Your Majesty has done all you
can. It is as well, however," he added, pleasantly, "that you,
Sire, should know the limit of your effort. I hardly credit that
you have read my memoranda for the rendezvous on November 1st. I
have not sufficient men, and, for the generals&mdash;most of them
are of but mediocre talent. Some of them are old men who have
been through as many as thirty campaigns. They have noticed
little and learned nothing. Among the officers, as among the men,
only half of the number at my disposal I count upon as being of
real, military value. Alike among Frenchmen, Austrians, Spanish
and Germans, you will find men who have been promoted solely
through their rank, because they are of royal or of noble blood.
Some of them are fops and fools, and most of them vain, arrogant
and unmanageable."</p>

<p>"You appear to manage them, however," said Leopold, bitterly.
"As for your memoranda, why read what I cannot alter?"</p>

<p>"I keep a firm hand," said Christian, ignoring the sneer.
"Some of them are my friends, and some of them are good cavalry
officers. I can count on De Lisle, and some of the Frenchmen.
There again, many of them are princes of the blood, and quite
impossible to direct; they are useless amateurs."</p>

<p>Leopold knew the hidden trouble here; it was Christian's birth
which stuck in the arrogant minds of the French princes of the
blood, and in the minds of many of the generals composing his
staff. Leopold had not the courage to say this, though, with
Christian's recent offence fresh in his mind, he would have much
liked to do so.</p>

<p>"I have," continued Christian, patiently, "several good
general officers, who may be respected for their services and who
conduct their divisions quite well; but I am not seconded by any
very able or energetic men. Nor, Sire, is any one's heart very
much in this campaign. Even De Lisle does not much care which way
the war swings, as long as it sends him back to his estate in
Touraine. I have had," he added, "to raise forced levies of
peasants, who are only insufficiently armed. I have had to weaken
every garrison I have left behind me, and to leave several
frontiers most insufficiently protected."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Leopold. "What is the reason of this?"</p>

<p>"To gather together sufficient men to march on Brussels,"
replied Christian patiently. "Your Majesty has heard this
discussion; you have heard it decided upon. It is foolish for us
to talk about it now. Nothing will do us any durable good but
decisive battle. That must and will be gained; but I must implore
Your Majesty, while the fate of it hovers in the balance, that
you will leave what has been done and cannot be undone."</p>

<p>Leopold made a weary movement of his hands to his brow, and
Christian continued, in the same serene tone:</p>

<p>"The Dutch await the English reinforcements. The troops on the
Rhine have not continued their movements. They are, however,
raising fresh regiments, and may any moment be again on the
march. Our agents tell me that the Dutch have forty battalions
and forty-six squadrons and that there are more than six
battalions of the Hanoverians; and twenty-six English
battalions&mdash;which is to say, in all over a hundred
battalions, and nearly a hundred squadrons. It is fortunate for
us that a great number of these troops, and nearly all the
contingent sent to the Queen of Hungary, have to be employed in
fortifying the towns along the other side of the Rhine. They are
also our superior in cavalry and in artillery. I tell Your
Majesty all this to remind you once more that my hands are
full."</p>

<p>The words, though spoken with perfect pleasantness, were like
a rebuke in the ears of Leopold. He knew the immense superiority
of Christian in these matters; the soldier was a vigorous worker,
full of energy, intelligence, force of judgment; acquainted with
the least detail of his profession; an adept in all the arts and
sciences appertaining to the art and science of war. He made no
mistakes; he overlooked nothing. Leopold felt that in his hands
his cause was safe; and yet he detested him, as he had not
detested him since that day at Dürsheim. All the enmity which had
been sleeping between them during these last weeks of hurried
movement and rapid preparation broke forth again, and with a
bitterer violence.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to hear these things," he flung out,
peevishly.</p>

<p>"But Your Majesty must hear them," said Christian. "I tell you
them in order that you may not distract yourself with the affairs
of Olivenza and Guastalla. Let that rest till the end of the
campaign. And then, Sire," he added, ironically, "when the war is
over, you may if you please reinstate them both as Field-Marshals
in your army. No doubt in peacetime they will make pretty
ornaments at your court."</p>

<p>"I cannot let it go at this!" cried Leopold, with pale
dignity.</p>

<p>But Christian would not listen to more. With the utmost
patience, yet with the utmost resolution, but not without a calm
menace, he said:</p>

<p>"Sire, I mean to threaten Mons, Charleroi and Tournay. We must
advance almost immediately. It is impossible for me to do
anything if I am distracted thus by petty details. Sire, your
place would be at the head of the troops. As I said, we make a
forced march on these places. They are our objectives; in three
or four days we should be there, and have them surrounded before
they have time to get in the harvest, or any manner of provision.
To invest these three towns simultaneously is certainly to draw
the Allies to a pitched battle: that battle must be a victory for
you, Sire, and after the victory will come the fall of Brussels.
The plan is simple."</p>

<p>It was, even to Leopold's unaccustomed ears, bold.</p>

<p>"It seems that you stake all on one throw," he said,
doubtfully, having forgotten for the moment even the affair of
Olivenza and Guastalla.</p>

<p>"It is that, Sire," replied Christian, "or wasting months in
marches and counter-marches in dull and purposeless manoeuvres.
Your Majesty must now give me leave, as I have to see the Marquis
de la Faye, the Maréchal des Logis, who has before ably seconded
me, and in whom I have every confidence. I have to make with him
the final arrangements for a concentration camp between Charleroi
and Mons. We leave, Sire, within an hour or so." He added, not
without amused malice, "If Your Majesty would deign to grasp my
scheme it might recommend itself more to you."</p>

<p>He had some papers quickly out of his pocket and set them
before Leopold's most reluctant and antagonistic gaze.</p>

<p>"Sire, if you have time to squander, let it be in digesting
some of these rude notes which will show soberly your
position."</p>

<p>Leopold's clouded and sullen glance fell on the rigid lines of
neat, clear writing, regular rows of words like picked
troops:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Chemay</span>, etc.</p>

<p class="letter">As to Luxemburg, their lines of communication
will be cut off...it is possible they also will fall into the
power of the Emperor.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Westphalia</span></p>

<p class="letter"> Hanover being destitute of fortified places an
offensive in Westphalia would give some concern to the Court at
London...</p>

<p class="letter"> The King of Prussia, by November, should have
120,000 men...</p>

<p class="letter"> The troops of the King of France in the High
Palatinate must combine with those of the Emperor...</p>

<p class="letter"> Passau, on the Danube, is the key of Austria,
we hold it... therefore a juncture between the armies in Bavaria
and Lower Austria.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Piedmont</span></p>

<p class="letter">Detach the King of Sardinia.</p>

<p class="letter">Bavaria has been ruined because she was not
fortified&mdash;the King of Prussia will have Silesia, he cares
not how; watch Kurland.</p>

<br>

<p>At that word Leopold looked up; here was a palpable weakness
at which he could strike.</p>

<p>"Watch Kurland, eh?" he sneered. "So, through all these
confusions you grope after your own elevation!"</p>

<p>"I serve for Kurland," replied Christian, unmoved.</p>

<p>"A meagre return for an Empire!" cried Leopold, taking up the
notes again. "One province for so many&mdash;but I
forgot&mdash;you have been paid already."</p>

<p>Half his rancour faded when he considered Eleanora; she, like
Kurland, was still unpossessed; town and woman might alike prove
a vaporous <i>ignis fatuus</i> to Christian; Leopold, to hide the
expression in his eyes, bent over the notes again; Eleanora, a
waving brightness, flickered between him and the dry
details.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Neither the English nor the Dutch will be
sensibly touched by conquests in Flanders, these gratify the King
of Spain&mdash;attack these Powers in their own territories and
reduce them to peace, especially give a lesson to these base
republicans who have no right to exist at
all&mdash;Breda&mdash;Bergen-op-Zoom, Hanover, Treves.</p>

<p class="letter">The frontiers of Hainault and Champagne require
a good corps of troops.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap"> Conclusion</span>. Have we
sufficient troops for all this? 20,000 Swedish mercenaries would
do wonders; no lack of engineers, hay and enthusiasm; the
regiment of the Prince de Ligneville is likely to be disobedient.
Have we enough material for the construction of bridges? M. de
Sahel spoke of two months before more fusees and bombs could be
delivered. Find another man; platforms for cannon, transport;
raise two new regiments.</p>

<br>

<p>Baffled anger and tedium again overcame Leopold; he dashed the
notes from the table to the floor.</p>

<p>Christian, watching him, said: "Sire, you appear to follow
some unstable train of fancy."</p>

<p>He spoke with the utmost deference, and yet with the air of a
man who is in command. Leopold bit his full under lip in silence.
He felt himself defeated and humiliated. The situation was
unbearable. Pale with nervous tension, he rose and began to walk
up and down. Though for the last few days his feelings had been
lulled, they were now raging. He would have given anything to be
out of all this. He did not want to fight; he did not want to go
forward; he did not want to play this other man's game for the
paltry prize of a crown that he did not desire; he did not grasp
what he had just read; he returned to his grievance.</p>

<p>"Your Highness appears," he said, nervously, "to have
disobeyed and flouted me without as much as an excuse, without as
much as asking pardon."</p>

<p>"I have no excuses to make and no pardon to ask, Sire," smiled
Christian. "I have done as I was obliged to do." He had only
listened to Leopold out of civility and spoken to him and shown
him his notes out of a sense of duty. Now he had no more time to
give him. He knew that Leopold might talk for another hour,
incoherent protests and feeble complaints. He was, of course,
quite powerless to reinstate the two disgraced generals.
Christian, therefore, put that out of his occupied mind. When he
was full of his work, he had a habit of putting everything else
out of his mind; and, as in the case of Gabor not long ago, he
utterly failed to realize the fury of hatred he had aroused in
another man's heart, and the possible potency of that same
hatred. It never occurred to him that Leopold, walking up and
down, pale and agitated, looking (as he thought to himself, not
without compassion) like a sick boy, was capable of cherishing
against him any malevolent and deadly passion. At times he could
feel a furtive pity for such a disposition in such a position;
and now, at the door, he turned back to speak what he intended to
be words of encouragement. It was no wish of his to have Leopold
distressed or humiliated in his own opinion. He wished to see him
as a brave figure to parade before the troops. Always, in his
consideration, the presence of the king or emperor for whom the
men fought was worth a great deal to the spirit of the army.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will see matters from a different angle when you
are in Brussels," he suggested.</p>

<p>Leopold shook his head impatiently. Brussels had been in the
hands of the enemy since the outbreak of the war. It would need
to be a shattering defeat that could make them relinquish it
now.</p>

<p>"And after Brussels, Bavaria," added Christian, pleasantly.
"And after Bavaria, the Coronation at Frankfurt; and, after
that&mdash;well, Vienna, and winter quarters, if Your Majesty
pleases! And, we hope, the Protocol of Peace."</p>

<p>Even Leopold's anger was soothed by the authority and
confidence in these words. For a moment he thrilled at the
thought of being himself a victor, a conqueror&mdash;an Emperor
indeed; but the thrill of joy soon disappeared into a pang of
hate when he realized that he would owe all these glories to the
man before him&mdash;who, when it was over, would go to
Ottenheim.</p>

<p>Christian left him with a salute of the most profound respect,
which Leopold scarcely returned.</p>

<p>"I might have known," he muttered to himself; "I might have
known&mdash;a man like that!"</p>

<p>He wondered where Gabor was. For days he had not seen the
Transylvanian, nor dared to ask Hensdorff the whereabouts of his
agent. For all he knew, Gabor might have penetrated the enemy's
lines as a spy or be somewhere in disguise on the territory held
by the Allies. It was almost impossible for him to acquaint
himself with the movements of so obscure a personage. Leopold had
no confidant and no servant on whom he could rely. Always his
life had gone by chance and hazard; always he had been isolated
by conflicting circumstance. There was no one now in whom he
could confide such a matter as this; his mind wavered to the
prisoners in Vienna.</p>

<p>The sole definite action possible to him was to write to
Fürth, and even this he hesitated to do; for what could he tell
this man, who had thus appealed and thus reproached him with that
one dreadful line: "I was your father's friend!" Nothing. All he
could do was to send false promises that he would not be able to
redeem, or feeble consolations which ill became his august
position. If he, as the Emperor, could not release his friends,
it was idle to send them sympathetic messages.</p>

<p>The troops were rapidly leaving the town. Leopold delayed so
long in his room that at last Hensdorff came to find him,
brushing impatiently aside the valets and gentlemen of the
bedchamber, who lingered and lounged in the anteroom.</p>

<p>"Sire, you always delay!" cried Hensdorff, with an ill temper
that he could barely control; "and every delay is more deadly
than the last."</p>

<p>The young man answered, with weary sloth:</p>

<p>"What do I care, Hensdorff, about delays? None of this is of
any matter to me. I care not if you take Brussels or no. I only
desire to be free of all importunities." Hensdorff disregarded
these words, which he took to be an expression of peevish
weakness.</p>

<p>"We have engaged in this now," he remarked, drily, "and none
of us can turn back. We are already far advanced into the country
held by the enemy, Sire, and we have hardly enough troops to hold
the lines of communication indefinitely."</p>

<p>Leopold was sullenly silent. Hensdorff, like Christian, was
ignorant how far his weakness was being goaded, how near he was
to violent, impulsive and desperate action&mdash;the frantic
gesture of the trapped and cornered.</p>

<p>"Where is that fellow Gabor?" asked Leopold, suddenly. "Of
late I have not seen him."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was baffled, surprised.</p>

<p>"I employ Ferdinand Gabor," he said, "and he acquits himself
with resolution, secrecy and promptitude. Why did Your Majesty
wish to know of his whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see him," said Leopold, dully. "Contrive that he
sees me, and secretly. I also have my own affairs, Hensdorff,
cipher as I am."</p>

<p>"But surely not with Ferdinand Gabor?" demanded Hensdorff,
disconcerted by these giddy vagaries.</p>

<p>"Precisely with him," replied Leopold.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">MOVING with unhesitating rapidity, Christian,
well within the time he had allowed himself, arrived at the
rendezvous for the army near Tournay and Mons in early November.
He had been well seconded by Linz and his engineers, and on new
pontoons, his troops had crossed the Rhine without much
molestation from the enemy, who had not been able to do more than
menace the Imperialists by a vague fire from the distant fort on
the opposite bank. The Dutch, alarmed, reluctant and lethargic,
had fallen back across their own frontiers, after waiting in a
hesitant manner for English reinforcements which did not
arrive.</p>

<p>Arroya and Châterault had kept the Hanoverians and the English
troops occupied; they had even gained some slight advantage,
capturing a train of artillery and a quantity of baggage which
had been cut off the main body of the Hanoverian army.</p>

<p>Prince Christian had divided his troops and advanced in two
movements, converging towards Mons. These attracted the attention
of the enemy, and produced the desired diversion. The Allied
generals, who had been exactly informed by their agents of
Christian's project on Tournay, were informed that he appeared to
be investing Mons, and threw in front of this place a
considerable force. The English general had decided, at a hurried
Council of War, to succour Mons at all costs; but while they were
advancing with all possible expedition and power to the rescue of
that important fortress, Christian had turned round, his two
wings had joined, and had thrown themselves before Tournay and
Ath. Tournay was immediately invested on the side of Brussels.
The Uhlans, the Polanders, the Black Cuirassiers and the Hussars
began steadily to cross the Maas without opposition; the heavy
artillery had already parked, and the advance guard under
Knittelfeldt, lately promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General,
was charged with the investiture of Tournay, while Christian came
up with the main body of the Imperialists and the French. The
weather was set fair, and rendered the task of the engineers in
getting all these troops across the Maas all the more
expeditious; in two days the light artillery and the baggage was
over the river; at one o'clock the same morning, despite a brisk
fire from the citadel, the trenches were opened by Knittelfeldt
before Tournay, exact to the arranged date. By the next dawn,
Christian saw his audacious plan, so deliberately matured, so
promptly put into action, come to fruition. The enemy, finding
they had been deceived by a feint, turned round from Mons and
marched on Tournay. Before this town was completely invested, the
Allies were in sight of the Imperial camp. All had occurred
exactly as Christian had foreseen, and wished; he was in
precisely the position in which he had planned to be: he had
drawn the enemy as he had wished to draw them. Even with all his
long-practised control, he could scarcely conceal his
exultation.</p>

<p>The main body of the Imperialists was five leagues from
Tournay, at the little town of St. Omer, which stood on the right
bank of the Scheldt and was crowned by a circlet of forests.
Behind were fields, marshy in the wet weather, but dry and
powdery now; and massive woods which spread to the undulating
horizon. Two streams divided the camp, and on the banks of one of
these was a large farm and country house, the Maison de
Bleclers.</p>

<p>Christian, who looked over every detail himself, was persuaded
that the enemy, coming from Ath and Mons, would not approach by
the northeast, but would come on him through the woods of Barry
and along the banks of the Scheldt towards Tournay. A personal
inspection of all possible roads had shown him those which were
impracticable, and those along which the Allies might march. He
was, therefore, well prepared to meet them, with the town behind
him and the streams in front. Convinced that the enemy would
penetrate through the woods of Barry, where the roads were
excellent, and which was itself on the direct way from Ath and
Mons, Christian assembled before this wood the main body of his
army.</p>

<p>He had chosen for his camp a flat piece of ground where there
were at least two leagues where the cavalry could manoeuvre
perfectly. He was protected on one side by the wood, behind by
the town invested by his own troops, and in front, in some sort,
by the two considerable streams which flowed into the
Scheldt.</p>

<p>He began at once to fortify this camp, to raise redoubts and
dig trenches, and to either destroy or to use, as part of his
scheme of defence, all the houses, farms and cottages within the
circle of his camp. Posts were thrown out to occupy all the
neighbouring villages; there was a complete line of communication
between the Imperial Forces for a distance of several leagues;
the way was held behind them as far as the Rhine; the enemy had
no base or magazine on the banks of the Scheldt; an unaccountable
oversight but they had been confident that the Imperialists would
not penetrate so far.</p>

<p>Not all the general officers approved Christian's plan of
action; there were many murmurs and some open dissent at the
hastily summoned Council of War. The position was criticized. If
the enemy did not advance where Christian supposed they would
advance, through the woods at Barry, the Imperialists'
communication would have been threatened; and some French
officers spoke of the possible abandonment of the not too
strongly held lines in the Valenciennes direction, thus leaving
open the road to France.</p>

<p>"It is all very well," grumbled Knittelfeldt, "if one were
certain of victory; but in case of a defeat, where is our
retreat? We shall be beaten back from the walls of Tournay on to
the banks of the Scheldt."</p>

<p>But Christian was not preparing for a defeat. He detached
himself as much as possible from his <i>entourage</i>, and went
his way in silence, keeping his eye on all and heeding none. That
he would not be too well seconded he knew perfectly. He also knew
perfectly that a certain amount of obedience he could always
exact. No one would dare to go too openly or boldly against
him.</p>

<p>News came that the Hanoverians were advancing with the purpose
of reinforcing Mons; Christian was not disturbed. He was
confident that Tournay would fall in a day or so, and that then,
unless previously attacked, he could advance with all his forces
to relieve the other fort; but he hoped and believed that he
would be attacked. His object was not even the taking of
important towns, but the winning of a decisive battle.</p>

<p>"The presence of the Emperor," he remarked, pleased with the
spirit of the troops, "is worth five hundred thousand men, not
only for the effect on our own soldiers, but for the impression
it makes upon the enemy."</p>

<p>Indeed, the presence of Leopold, who made a fine enough
appearance riding from post to post with his immense escort,
galloping in all his bravery along the lines of the camp,
heartened and inspired the Imperialists, exalting both their
hopes and their valour.</p>

<p>For days the Allies and the Imperialists manoeuvred and
counter-manoeuvred, changing troops from here to there,
cautiously placing and replacing the squadrons, without any
losses either side. The Allies only threatened to relieve Mons.
As they moved away from this town, Prince Christian recalled the
Royal Cavalry of France and the Dragoons which had been sent to
threaten that citadel. When the enemy appeared before Roubaix
Christian sent fifty squadrons to meet them; the enemy hesitated,
then retired without investing that town. They turned aside from
the road to Tournay, and made their concentration camp between
Hal and Brussels; then, in slow detachments advanced by Enghien,
Miramont and Lessine, formed a junction with the Dutch coming
down from Oudenarde and at last turned towards Tournay and the
headquarters of the Imperialists.</p>

<p>While he was at supper on the eighth of November, Christian
received news of this approach of the enemy. Leopold and his
household and his Guards were accommodated in one of the largest
of the farmhouses; their pavilions stretched all over the
trampled cornfields, where the grain had not yet been cut. With a
leisure and calm that many of his generals regarded as
excessive&mdash;an affectation&mdash;Christian rode up to this
grange to acquaint his sovereign of the approach of the Allies.
His cool serenity was no artificial posture; for days everything
had been ready to the last detail. He could see no reason for
agitation or hurry; he remarked that the enemy would probably be
fatigued and would not wish to begin battle at once. They had
marched, he said, seventy-five kilometres in eleven days&mdash;so
exactly and carefully had he been informed of their proceedings,
so carefully had he noted distances.</p>

<p>Without a trace of his inner satisfaction, for his early plan
had been carried out to the letter, he gave Leopold the news
which had just been brought in by Croatian scouts.</p>

<p>Leopold received the information sullenly: he had lately found
it difficult to maintain his usual courtesy with his
Generalissimo, so deeply had the affair of his two disgraced
generals estranged him from this detested soldier.</p>

<p>"Sire," remarked Christian, "everything is in readiness, and
Your Majesty may take your usual repose, the attack will not be,
at earliest, before ten to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad," replied Leopold, not looking at him, "of
action at last."</p>

<p>He rose, yawning, picking up his fringed gloves.</p>

<p>"I do not wish for any repose," he added, coldly. "I am bored
and weary with waiting and resting. I shall be glad to accompany
Your Highness round the lines."</p>

<p>"That would hearten the men, no doubt," agreed Christian,
sincerely. "I shall be obliged if Your Majesty will do so."</p>

<p>They passed out through the modest door of the humble farm
into the cold clearness of the night. The stars gathered up in
the dark blue heavens seemed tremendous, and to hang down, like
lamps, low into the bare trees that crowned the low hill of St.
Omer.</p>

<p>Two battalions of Imperial Guards were outside the farm, to
guard the <i>entourage</i> of Leopold and his royal person.</p>

<p>He marked this precaution on the part of Christian with a
certain sneer. He could never now see any evidence of his
supposed might and splendour without a sneer.</p>

<p>When they were both mounted, Christian pointed out to him,
civilly and as a matter of duty, but without much enthusiasm as
to his understanding, all the dispositions he had made for the
supposed battle. Four cannon were placed at each bridge head;
Count de Rougefort occupied St. Omer with seven battalions,
nineteen squadrons and eight pieces of cannon&mdash;all the
little houses and farms which had not been destroyed were
fortified and occupied, some by as many as eight battalions and
eight pieces of cannon. The body of the army was ranged behind
St. Omer, where eighty-four squadrons of cavalry were placed in
two lines, the right at three hundred paces behind St. Omer, the
left near the woods of Barry. On the heights behind were fifteen
squadrons of Dragoons, on the Mons road a regiment of Black
Hussars watched for the possible approach of the enemy. Behind
the left of the cavalry, thirty battalions were arranged in two
divisions, one to the right and the other to the left of the
woods of Barry. There were four cannon in the centre of the first
division, and eight squadrons behind.</p>

<p>The French troops were encamped between this line and the
village church, Our Lady of the Woods. Further behind, twelve
battalions formed the second line of infantry; they had fourteen
pieces at their left, between the church and the woods; they
protected the reserves, the baggage and the road to Ath.</p>

<p>"I do not think," remarked Christian, as he rode round these
lines with the Emperor, explaining all with so much indifferent
courtesy, "that there is anything forgotten, or anything out of
place. The enemy may be no further than three-quarters of a
league away, but we are ready for them."</p>

<p>And, with a smile, he pointed out to Leopold the direction of
Lille, where he had taken all dispositions for a retreat in case
of a defeat.</p>

<p>"That Your Majesty," he added, "can retreat more quickly in
case of necessity across the last bridge, it will be perpetually
guarded by the three brigades of Guards."</p>

<p>Leopold rode through the little woods at the top of the hill
behind the church, and saw below him the beautiful plain, twelve
leagues across, now entirely covered by his troops; he knew that
by now all the officers had received their orders, and that many
of them were vehemently criticizing Christian. Few of them
believed that he was correct in his supposition as to the point
of attack that would be chosen by the enemy. Three-quarters of
the army were persuaded that there were too many troops in the
right and the centre, and that if the enemy made a false attack
at the right during which he could render himself master of the
bridges, and then brought his real attack on the left, they would
be greatly embarrassed, and have their communication with Lille
cut off.</p>

<p>Despite themselves, they were impressed by the coolness and
the judgment shown by Christian, and also by his brilliant and
unflawed reputation; but their own reason gave him the wrong.
They could not believe that his audacious penetration was
correct.</p>

<p>All his plans rested upon the point chosen by the enemy to
attack. And if he was wrong, if the Allies did not advance
through the woods of Barry, but circled round Tournay and took
them on the left, then the vaunted victory would become a defeat,
and the campaign would be ended disastrously before it was well
begun.</p>

<p>At half past three in the morning, Leopold returned to his
quarters at the grange. He had been impressed by Christian's
exact preparations, by his superb self-confidence; but in his
heart he had not been thinking of the coming battle at all, but
only as to how he might obtain an interview with Gabor and send
by him some message to Eleanora in Ottenheim.</p>

<p>So far, this had not been possible, and he did not dare again
to ask Hensdorff as to how he might see the Transylvanian. He
tried to sleep, and when Father St. Nikola visited him he tried
to pray&mdash;but both endeavours were in vain. He was in no mood
either for slumber or prayer.</p>

<p>A deep excitement took hold on him: hardly the excitement of
the coming contest with the enemy, with the English and the
Hanoverians and the Dutch, the Allies; no, these to him were vain
figures, almost a phantom army. The real combat was the combat
that he both dreaded and longed for&mdash;was that, not with a
host, but with one prevailing man. It was Christian who was his
real enemy&mdash;not these advancing hordes of strangers.</p>

<p>At half past eight he breakfasted with his suite. There had
still been no news of the Allies. At ten o'clock, Leopold mounted
again and rode once more round the lines, where everything was in
such exact readiness. With only a small escort, he galloped to
the most advanced outpost, looking coldly over the chill autumn
landscape, the grey length of the river and the grey height of
the sky.</p>

<p>In the distance, and on the other bank of the river, was a
small skirmish taking place between his own light patrols and
those of the enemy. Further still, the dull smudge of smoke and
the dull gloom of flames showed in the universal colourless grey:
these were the houses, farms and cottages and windmills being
burnt and abandoned by the raiding Imperialists and occupied by
the advancing enemy. As he remained immobile on his smooth bay
horse, watching these events as if they belonged to another age
and almost to another world than his own, he was met by
Christian, who had spent the night bivouacking in the middle of
his Uhlans behind the first line of cavalry. Leopold glanced at
the village of St. Omer, with the little church with tall, frail
towers, white houses with their red-tiled roofs, and the gardens
and fields surrounding them, all now dry and barren with the
approaching cold of winter. He glanced further at the distant
walls of Tournay, behind this, where the Hanoverian flag floated,
and then at the grey width and strength of the river flowing
sluggishly by the elaborate encampment.</p>

<p>"There seems to me," he remarked, drily, "one great fault in
your preparations, Monseigneur. It is apparent even to my
unaccustomed eye. And this fault is that, if we are defeated,
there will be nothing for us to do but to throw ourselves into
the river."</p>

<p>Christian, who had studied so patiently and organized so
exactly every detail, only bowed, and demanded of Leopold where
he could take up his position.</p>

<p>"I was not mistaken," he remarked, without triumph; "the enemy
are advancing exactly where I thought they would advance, and
Your Majesty need have no fear about a possible defeat or a
possible retreat."</p>

<p>"How many men have we?" asked Leopold, with cold
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five thousand infantry," replied Christian,
immediately; "fourteen thousand cavalry; at the utmost, I think,
we have only forty-nine thousand men. Those effectively under
arms are no more than forty-seven thousand. The total of the
Allies must be at least sixty thousand men, and in artillery they
are even more superior than I had believed. In light cavalry we
have the advantage."</p>

<p>Leopold listened to all this with an odd
indifference&mdash;even with an odd coldness; none of it seemed
to matter to him. He was not in the least exalted by all these
preparations the end of which was his glory. He was even
astonished at his own apathy. The whole thing seemed to him
unreal, like some fantastic painting or the drop scene of a
theatre. There had been a slight morning mist, the result of a
ground-frost. Little by little, this raw haze was lifted, and
Christian gave him his perspective glasses and told him to look
through towards the woods of Barry.</p>

<p>Leopold could plainly see, deploying through the bare trees,
the sombre lines of the Dutch infantry, and the more brilliant
ranks of the English troops. All night, and under cover of the
light morning fog, the Allies had been taking up their
positions.</p>

<p>It was now about half past twelve, and the mist creeping up
from the ground seemed to densify into clouds, which, rising
slowly, obscured the pallid winter blue and the faint winter
sun.</p>

<p>Christian looked keenly over the whole length of his prepared
entrenchments. The Allies took up the position of attack.
Christian, through his glasses, watched the infantry getting into
their place. Then he spoke to one of his aides-de-camp, giving
his preconcerted signal. The aide-de-camp galloped away, and
almost immediately, so perfect was the chain of communication,
all the Imperialists' fire leaped out towards the woods of
Barry.</p>

<p>Leopold had been unprepared, his horse plunged, and he started
as the terrific noise tore to shreds the placid air and the
delicate silence of the winter morning. The artillery of the
Allies replied immediately, though in a desultory
fashion&mdash;they had not yet their pieces in place.</p>

<p>"They mean to attack in full force," said Christian, lowering
his glasses. "The Dutch advance on St. Omer."</p>

<p>He sent the three officers behind him immediately off with his
last instructions for the battle, telling them to ride from rank
to rank and see that his orders were being executed with
precision and fidelity; then he turned and galloped with Leopold
to the prearranged post at Luquet, beyond the range of the
enemy's artillery, the windmill beside the little stream that ran
into the Scheldt. He left Leopold by the windmill, where was
already the Emperor's escort of Imperial Guards and a number of
staff officers, several German princes, and members of the Royal
House of France. The King of Prussia was leading his own men, and
Christian turned and rode alone at full gallop round the field,
giving his last orders in person before he took up his position
at the head of his own Uhlans in the centre of the position
before St. Omer.</p>

<p>The enemy were moving with decision and vigour, and Christian
had given the orders for a prompt counter attack. Leopold,
sitting rigid and magnificent by the distant windmill, soon saw
nothing definite; in a quarter of an hour the whole prospect was
blotted out by smoke, torn by red blaze; the landscape had
vanished in greyness and thunder; officers kept riding up with
news; they told him that the Dutch in the woods of Barry had soon
been disposed of: they had fallen back before the French troops,
the Black Cuirassiers and the Austrian Hussars with little loss
to themselves, and had at once abandoned their proposed attack on
St. Omer. The English, thus badly seconded, were in some
confusion, but the Hanoverians had come to their support, and the
battle was still in the first stage of indecision on the edges of
the woods, on the banks of the river.</p>

<p>Leopold stared at his round diamond watch hanging from a
ribbon on his breast. The engagement had lasted barely an hour,
but he had lost the sense of time; noise, fire, darkness flowed
past him. He sat there immovable, pale, magnificent, at once too
scared and too useless to engage in the violence of the action.
Being the Emperor, he could not lead his troops himself; being an
inexperienced and amateur soldier, it would have been of no use
if he had done so. He had placed himself openly under the command
of Christian, resigning to him the leadership of his own men; and
Christian had bade him remain here&mdash;a figurehead, with all
the brilliance and glory of the Royal French House, and all the
glittering German princelings, many of whom looked anxious as to
the result of the action, in affluent attendance.</p>

<p>Leopold had seen many a battle before, and always with the
same sense of detachment. Though he was soft-hearted and
sentimental, in the moment of actual conflict these feelings
vanished. It was all so unreal, so false; he could hardly believe
that it was really happening about him; death, destruction,
horror.</p>

<p>He watched the church spire rising deliberately above the
dense mass of thick smoke; he saw the circling of the cavalry and
the preconcerted movements of the troops through rifts in this
smoke, taking place exactly, despite the heavy firing; he saw the
men fall and lie in heaps; the riderless horses; the staggering
ranks; the charge of the pikemen; the continuous fire of the
musketeers; and again the wheeling-up of the cavalry, the rattle,
the plunge and whistle of the cannon and shot. He heard the
beating of the drums and the sound of the trumpets, the raucous
notes of command.</p>

<p>Knittelfeldt rode up, his bloated face pallid.</p>

<p>"It goes ill enough," he cried, "and I should advise Your
Majesty to retreat across the river while we can hold the bridge
head."</p>

<p>Leopold heard this news with a certain bitter satisfaction;
even if this was a defeat that was going to mean annihilation for
him, at least it would mean humiliation for Christian. Almost he
wished his general would lose this most important
engagement&mdash;after his arrogant braggadocio in choosing a
position with his back to the river.</p>

<p>"The English," added Knittelfeldt, breathlessly, "fight with
incomparable obstinacy. Though they are in some disorder by the
retreat of the Dutch, the French do not do very well."</p>

<p>Balls were now falling all about them and a bomb burst a few
feet away; Leopold refused to move from his position, though this
was fast becoming dangerous as the action surged in his
direction, the Allies pushing the Imperialists back across their
own trenches. This was not due to courage on his part, though he
had enough of that, but to a complete indifference; his soul felt
frozen in his rigid body.</p>

<p>As he watched, he seemed to see the actual tide of fortune
fluctuate to and fro. Now a wave of men and flags and horses in
one direction, now in another. Some of the woods caught fire; dry
trees flamed like giant torches. The roar of the cannon became
incessant; there was hardly a pause of a second between one
volley and another. He could not distinguish the enemy's guns
from his own. He remembered the fireworks at Berlin as he saw the
balls leap into the air, reflected in the grey russet hue of the
wide river; and all this wide, violent, tumultuous and dreadful
scene became faint and vague to Leopold as he sat there,
motionless as a sentry, in his Imperial post.</p>

<p>More real to him than this prodigious combat was his inner
vision, a memory of those woods of delicate beech, that girl in
thin muslin, with her basket of strawberries, the sunset light
glancing through the trunks, the greenish trunks of the elegant
trees; peace, beauty and comfort there; here, incessant fury of
sound meeting and mingling with concentrated fury of action, in
contrast how atrocious.</p>

<p>Once he was aware of Christian riding up to him through all
the dark smoke and tangled confusion of the desperate engagement
now pressing so, and advising him, in tones no more hurried than
the usual, to make his retreat across the bridge.</p>

<p>"I do not know that we can do it," said the Generalissimo,
serenely, "and if we cannot, it is as well that we should have a
preconcerted and well-organized retreat, and that the person of
Your Majesty should not be a moment in danger."</p>

<p>But Leopold refused. He looked curiously at Christian,
remembering him as he had last seen him in battle outside
Belgrade, when he had been able to ignore him.</p>

<p>Christian was hatless; his wrist had been wounded and hastily
bound up with strips of his torn ruffle; the baton, scattered
with Imperial Eagles, that he carried, was blood fouled; his hair
was in disorder, and the knot of his sash had been shot away; his
breath was laboured, his face damp with sweat and all his uniform
dusty.</p>

<p>"My safety is of no matter to me," remarked Leopold; not
without spiteful disdain for the other's loss of his polished,
treasured elegance.</p>

<p>"But it is to me," returned Christian, who would as soon have
lost his Standard as his Emperor. He added, reflectively: "The
French are too vivacious; they charge too hastily, and without
thought, and then they are easily swept back&mdash;they have
little good will."</p>

<p>Frowning, he peered with narrowed eyes through the smoke at
the battle, which was not a confusion to him, as it was to
Leopold; every point and detail of it he knew exactly; it was his
plan, his diagram become alive, familiar to him in all these
lines that he had formerly traced in pencil and that were now
marked in fire and blood.</p>

<p>He perceived the Swabians giving way on the left, and shouting
to the group about Leopold to get the Emperor across the bridge,
he galloped back to the action.</p>

<p>Leopold stilled his nervous, leaping horse, curtly putting
aside the solicitations of his Staff to follow the advice of
Christian.</p>

<p>"If he or I is killed now," he thought, "it would prevent
worse things than death."</p>

<p>The forest of Barry was burning; the horizon was a wall of
pale fire; the perpetual cannonading shook the ground; Leopold
felt his whole soul rouse into a lust of conflict&mdash;but not
for this frantic combat with armies; it was another struggle in
which he would be engaged&mdash;one with a single opponent, the
man who was leading his troops and his banners now.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="first">THE engagement had been short; the victory
complete. By midday the enemy had fallen back under the guns of
Mons and Ath. The well-laid, prudent and yet audacious plans of
Christian, seconded by his own personal energy and his tireless
enthusiasm, his patience and courage, had gained the day for the
Imperialists; though at one moment it had almost seemed as if the
force and energy of the English troops, and their superior
numbers, would break down the resistance of the French and
Austrians.</p>

<p>Leopold had remained rigid in his place, a glittering figure
through the gloom; only stirring when he had to calm his excited
horse, which reared and plunged when the flashes of fire and the
balls leaped through the lurid glare and acrid smoke.</p>

<p>For he could not make the issue of this ferocious and
momentous engagement anything personal to himself. He was aware
of a dreary sense of tedium, and as the hours passed his head
ached from the continuous noise, and his eyes smarted from the
powder-tainted atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the murk of the late afternoon, Christian spurred up to
Leopold, and told him that the enemy had withdrawn; and added
impetuously, as if he were giving a command:</p>

<p>"It is now for Your Majesty to ride round the field and thank
the troops, most of whom have done very well."</p>

<p>General Crack did not remark that he had been ill seconded by
many of the officers; his sense of discipline told him that this
was no moment to be raising such questions, though he had had a
hard struggle to overcome the indolence and incapacity of some of
Leopold's generals. There had been, in the middle of the battle,
a moment of bitter confusion, when orders were not taken in some
regiments, and were not obeyed in others, when the Princes of the
Royal House of France had ridden pell-mell into the fray, causing
a chaos in Christian's well preconcerted plans. Victory had not
been too easy. It was the more admired and the more enjoyed. The
light troops pursued the orderly retreat of the enemy, who were
drawing off as rapidly as possible through the woods of Barry and
behind the hill on which stood the village of St. Omer. They were
already disputing fiercely among themselves, as troops of
different nationalities will after a check; and in their
disagreement and the hurry of their retreat, they left most of
their baggage and artillery scattered about the dry fields and
the bare woods.</p>

<p>The booty was considerable, and an armful of the Allies'
colours were brought to Leopold, as he rode with his Staff over
the field.</p>

<p>Though the battle had been so brief, the slaughter had been
frightful. For two hours the Imperialists on the flat plateau had
been exposed to the raging fire of the Allies, as the Allies had
been exposed to their counter fire directed from the heights
above the village. The woods were choked and the plain piled with
dead and dying; mere tatters and fragments of humanity and horses
defiled the sweetness of the chill winter day. Groans and
shrieks, prayers and complaints, rose up amidst the peal of the
Te Deum already being sung, the Lutheran hymns ringing from the
hoarse throats of Protestants and the thin cold clatter of the
village bells.</p>

<p>Leopold rode slowly round the field, his nervous, frightened
horse picking daintily among the heap of maimed and wounded, the
gorged trenches, and torn earth. He wondered himself at his
insensibility; not the professional insensibility of Christian,
who calmly regretted that the enemy's losses were not higher, but
the insensibility of one who could not realize what had happened;
of one who felt that a vast unreality encompassed him.</p>

<p>He looked for his friends and acquaintances as he went from
post to post, and heard that many of them had fallen: men with
whom he had been familiar since he was a boy. He saw the doctors,
with their mules laden with cases, proceeding with difficulty
from one trench or redoubt to another. He saw the chariots and
wagons already piled with agonizing men; and still he knew no
sensation of horror or pity.</p>

<p>"Is it," he asked himself, "because my mind, my heart, is so
full of another emotion?"</p>

<p>He was amazed at the obvious delight of De Lisle and the other
French officers. What, after all, did this victory matter? All
this slaughter and pain and agony? They were pleased, these men!
They were satisfied, triumphant and exultant. He heard their
congratulations, one after another, as they pressed up to him. He
smiled mechanically, distributing his civility, his bows, with an
indifferent impartiality.</p>

<p>He heard them all praise Christian. Christian had achieved
this triumph. Every one now praised Christian. And, hearing these
same laudations, Leopold felt his congealed blood burn&mdash;not
with pleasure now, but with anger.</p>

<p>All this had been for Christian: to exult and glorify him!</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff, who had accompanied the army and was a man of
a cool courage, came up to the Emperor and went with him round
the field. He seemed deeply concerned.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," he remarked, "that nothing can be accomplished
without this ghastly cost. Such are the foundations of thrones
and policies!"</p>

<p>But he was the only man who seemed thus impressed by the
ferocity of the slaughter.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia was exultant; Leopold watched his
deferential manner to Christian. "They all think him a great
man," thought the Emperor, "and no one regards me whatever. I am
merely the puppet, easy to their hand."</p>

<p>When, however, he at length met Christian face to face in the
midst of the shattered redoubts, he knew his duty. He had to
embrace him publicly before them all, and thank him in the most
gracious terms he could command for those hymns of victory now
ringing above the bloody and disputed field. But he could not
resist adding, after the facile courtesies with which he
addressed his victorious general:</p>

<p>"Your Highness will no doubt find your reward."</p>

<p>Yes, he thought, grimly, there would be rewards
enough&mdash;triumphs and kingdoms, honours, stars and crosses;
and, at the end of all, that girl at Ottenheim&mdash;the spring
on the banks of the Danube.</p>

<p>Christian was not much affected by all these flattering
plaudits; he had been victor on many a field, and the engagement
had been too brief to fatigue his superb physique or to excite
his even mind. His strength and health were heroic, and he found
such actions as these stimulating instead of exhausting. He knew,
too, that the best part of his work still lay before him. The
Allies had not been so smitten that they would not at once rally
again. And his objective had not been Tournay, which now was sure
to capitulate, but Brussels; and he was still some distance from
Brussels.</p>

<p>He responded agreeably, however, to the compliments of
Leopold; he had been pleased by the part the Emperor had played.
That glittering figure, rigid by the windmill through the smoke
of battle, was exactly the symbol that Christian had
wanted&mdash;some one who would do nothing, and appear to be
everything, was his ideal of a master and a king.</p>

<p>Leopold also was well trained in affable compliments, and
Christian approved the manner with which he distributed smiles
and civilities. Such an Emperor&mdash;comely, amiable and
young&mdash;would soon be popular; and the more popular he was,
the more would his task be easy and swift in accomplishment.</p>

<p>Though Christian had made every arrangement for the comfort of
the wounded, and his medical service was excellently organized,
he regarded the horrid sights which covered the field with
callous indifference, and was little moved even at the first list
of the illustrious dead and wounded which was presented to him.
He handed this list to the Emperor, remarking:</p>

<p>"Some of these gentlemen need not have lost their lives had
they not so rashly left their places without orders."</p>

<p>Leopold stared vaguely across the horrible field. He watched
the dead men being carried past the hillock where he had stayed
his restive horse: many of them men with whom he had dined only
yesterday. And the whole scene had a certain grotesqueness. It
seemed impossible for him to take either himself or the battle
seriously. With an ironic smile, he asked Christian his further
plans.</p>

<p>The Generalissimo replied immediately:</p>

<p>"Sire, Tournay will, of course, fall at once; then I mean to
cross the Marne and take Brussels. I had intended a blockade, but
now I think that I will take the city by assault. The Allies are,
at least for the moment, discomfited, and I do not think the
garrison is very strong. With Brussels, Your Majesty will have
the Spanish Netherlands. We must then sweep the enemy out of
Bavaria and the Palatinate. Tournay should be occupied to-night,"
he added, "and by the dawn we should be again on the march. The
men are mostly in good condition, and will require little rest;
the wounded can be left at Tournay."</p>

<p>As he had predicted, the white flag hung out from the citadel
of Tournay that night; but Leopold remained in his headquarters,
and slept in the grange, on the farmer's bed with a straw
mattress. He left it to his Generalissimo to receive the keys of
the conquered town, to watch the garrison march out with the
honours of war, and to occupy the fort with his own troops.</p>

<p>Early in the grey, bleak morning, Hensdorff came to see him,
and told him that the troops were already on the move; Leopold
knew this; his rest had long been disturbed by the sounds of
breaking camp.</p>

<p>"It all seems no concern of mine," he said with a wan smile,
"since Prince Christian does everything."</p>

<p>"You may well leave it all to him," replied Hensdorff dryly.
"He knows his business."</p>

<p>"And I hope," said Leopold, quietly, "that you think I know
mine now, Count: that of the obedient puppet."</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not reply; he felt weary and nauseated.
Everything to him smelt of blood and powder. He was now a man of
the Cabinet, not the field. He had sickened at the sights and
sounds he had had to see and hear traversing the encampment to
the Emperor's headquarters.</p>

<p>"Does it seem worth while to you?" asked Leopold, curiously.
He was adjusting his cravat before the small cracked mirror above
the blue earthenware stove of the farmhouse parlour.</p>

<p>"Still in that mood, Sire?" asked Hensdorff, grimly. "God in
Heaven! If we stopped to ask if things were worth while..."</p>

<p>"I ask it, but I don't stop," said Leopold, sneering at
himself. "I go on; I do what I am told. Surely, my dear Count,
you are pleased with me!"</p>

<p>"You speak with an odd bitterness, Sire," said the minister,
heavily; "surely you got some satisfaction from yesterday? It is
pleasant, after all, to be acclaimed! The night after victory has
some thrill in it for most men."</p>

<p>"It was not I who was acclaimed," said Leopold, "but General
Crack. What other name did you hear but that yesterday?
He&mdash;ask him if he received any satisfaction. At his feet the
rewards will be piled; not at mine&mdash;for him the elevation
and the ecstasy, not for me."</p>

<p>"You stand to gain an empire," retorted Hensdorff, wearily.
"That, after all, must be higher than <i>his</i> utmost
expectation."</p>

<p>Leopold did not reply to this. He gazed at his reflection in
the greenish mirror. He was stung by the effeminacy of his own
countenance; never could he glance into a glass without being
reminded of his own inadequacy.</p>

<p>"Christian is for marching on Brussels immediately," added
Hensdorff. "Bold and daring, but, I think, justified."</p>

<p>"It does not matter what <i>I</i> think," said Leopold. "He
will do exactly as he chooses."</p>

<p>"That was the bargain," Hensdorff once again reminded him.</p>

<p>"Ah! The bargain!" smiled Leopold. He paused a second, and
then he asked inquisitively:</p>

<p>"Do you think, Hensdorff, that, whatever happened, Prince
Christian would keep that bargain? Do you think that he is beyond
bribe&mdash;beyond affront?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not understand this; with some impatience, he
asked for a clearer explanation. He was vexed that the triumphs
of yesterday had not steadied Leopold, and cleared his mind of
some of his whims and caprices, his hesitations and indecisions.
For himself, he had, like every other man in the camp, been
considerably impressed and even awed by the brilliant display of
Christian's qualities as man and soldier yesterday. However
arrogant and intolerable he might be in times of peace, there
could be no possible doubt of his supreme value in times of war.
Hensdorff secretly shared the common opinion that Leopold,
stately as he might hold himself, cut but a poor figure beside
that of the mercenary soldier he employed.</p>

<p>Leopold held his hands out above the stove, which had just
been lit and gave out a faint heat. He paused, turning his words
over in his mind before he uttered them. Then he said,
deliberately:</p>

<p>"I mean, do you think that one might trust Prince Christian?
That he might be temptable; that he might be affronted?"</p>

<p>Leopold tried to explain himself more clearly. He looked
keenly at Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"I want to know if I could affront him&mdash;so deeply that he
would leave my service," he asked. "Or, if the Allies were to
offer him more than I could offer, he would accept?"</p>

<p>This seemed to Hensdorff a most unnecessary subject to raise.
He had not himself the least reason to suspect the fidelity of
Christian to his word. He told Leopold so.</p>

<p>"The man will be faithful, not so much to you, Sire, as to his
own promise. He has made a bargain, and why should we think he
would not keep it? He has had his pay, and he will give good
value for it."</p>

<p>"He has had nothing," said Leopold, sullenly and with heavy
meaning, "nothing. All these honours and glories are yet in the
future; he is not yet Duke of Kurland, he is not Maréchal de
France, he has no provinces, nor governments."</p>

<p>"He has," said Hensdorff, not knowing that he struck at the
very heart of the matter between these two&mdash;"he has Eleanora
of Anhalt-Dessau; and that, I think, was a great bribe for
him."</p>

<p>Leopold looked over his shoulder into the small mirror, and
stared into his own blue eyes. Hensdorff did not know, perhaps,
or remember that that possession was merely nominal.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he asked cautiously, "that she means so much
to him, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems obvious," smiled Hensdorff; "it was all he
asked for. As you say, Sire, the other things will come
afterwards; the fruits of victory. They were doubtful from the
first. If he gains them, it must be by his own exertions. That
was the price for joining you, for leading your troops; and he
has received it and, I believe, will earn it."</p>

<p>"You do not think," mused Leopold, still looking at himself in
the mirror, "that I could affront him?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff was impatient.</p>

<p>"Why does Your Majesty keep talking of affront? Surely the
last person in the world you would affront would be Prince
Christian!"</p>

<p>"I do not like him," said Leopold, softly. "I cannot forgive,
Hensdorff&mdash;I never shall forgive&mdash;the affair of
Guastalla and Olivenza."</p>

<p>"Ah, that!" Hensdorff shrugged.</p>

<p>"Well, give me your opinion," insisted Leopold. "You are a
clever and a subtle man, Count; you have always been my
counsellor. Do you think that Christian, in any circumstances,
would be false to me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hensdorff, bluntly, "I do not. And, as I remarked
before, Sire, it is not a question of being false to you, but to
his own word. Prince Christian has changed sides before now, like
every mercenary; but always openly. And I believe that he is very
nice in his honour."</p>

<p>"Such nicety," said Leopold, maliciously, "is scarcely
expected of those born as Christian. His honour, like his birth,
is not immaculate; beneath all his carefully acquired French
airs, his is a coarse and vulgar soul."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," remarked Hensdorff, grimly; "and I should
not advise Your Majesty to think so. Nothing is more likely to
insult him than any suspicion of his honour."</p>

<p>Then he asked, with some uneasiness, why Leopold had raised
this vexatious question.</p>

<p>"I find it hard to tolerate Prince Christian," admitted
Leopold. "I find it hard to tolerate many things, but most of all
that man, this showy, insolent adventurer: cruel, rapacious, and
I believe, false."</p>

<p>"But he has conducted himself with extreme civility,"
protested Hensdorff, in surprise. "I cannot understand the pique
Your Majesty has against him. He is certainly arrogant, and even
insolent; unscrupulous, and, I suppose, corrupt. Where his honour
as a soldier is concerned, however, I do believe that you may
absolutely rely upon him. He said that if we resigned to him the
Princess Eleanora, he would see you crowned at Frankfurt. And I
do believe he will keep his word."</p>

<p>Leopold turned so that his back was to the mirror. "But I," he
remarked, as if to himself, "I gave no word. I took no oath. I
passed no promise."</p>

<p>"Well, I did!" answered Hensdorff, drily. "I drove a hard and
fast bargain with him, and Your Majesty will scarcely be able to
go back upon it. Kurland has been promised. I have arranged that
with the King of Prussia; he is only too pleased to exchange
Kurland for Silesia. The French will make him Maréchal de France.
And you must give him some personal favours."</p>

<p>"Oh, all those toys and trifles," cried Leopold, impatiently.
"How stupid and how unreal they seem!"</p>

<p>"There I cannot follow Your Majesty," replied Hensdorff,
bluntly. "Unreal these things may seem to you, but they do not to
most men; and I can assure you that to men like Christian they
are very solid advantages indeed! He has been eating his heart
out for Kurland all his life, and after all he is a Ketlar."</p>

<p>"Or would have been," said Leopold, bitterly, "had not his
mother chanced to be an Italian light-o'-love."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Sire," cried Hensdorff, angrily, "don't
breathe such words, even between these four walls. There's no man
in the camp would dare to say as much, however sure he might be
of his companions."</p>

<p>"Is Christian, then, so great?" sneered Leopold.</p>

<p>"They are all in his hands, anyhow," said Hensdorff,
brusquely, "and I cannot see in what possible way he has offended
Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff had forgotten, as Christian himself had
forgotten, as Anhalt-Dessau had forgotten, that scene at
Dürsheim; how they between them had forced this young man; how
they had made him do a thing which to him was odious and
detestable, and relinquish something to which he had attached
himself by the most delicate threads of fastidious imaginings.
They had not known, when they were doing it, what it was they
did; and now it had gone completely from the minds of all of
them&mdash;particularly from the mind of Hensdorff. He had always
found Leopold whimsical and difficult, and there had been nothing
to guide him to the fact that on that occasion Leopold's
behaviour had been inspired by more than whims and caprices.
Leopold, with shuddering sensitiveness, had hidden his secret so
deeply in his heart that Hensdorff had never guessed it. He was,
therefore, now in the dark as to what this matter could be
between Christian and Leopold, and could only suppose it was that
most unfortunate affair of the two disgraced and arrested
generals. He began to speak of this, justifying Christian, whose
prudence and sagacity, whose judgment and promptitude he could
swear might be entirely trusted.</p>

<p>Leopold listened, and was utterly unimpressed. Nothing could
take from him that galling sense of hatred towards Christian. He
said at last, as he had said so long ago (long ago it seemed to
him, at least), to the hermit in the woods above the Danube:</p>

<p>"It is a dreadful thing to hate any one, Hensdorff: the most
dreadful thing that can happen to a man."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty should be set above such passions," replied the
minister. "Surely you cannot <i>hate</i> Prince Christian?"</p>

<p>And in his heart Hensdorff thought, angrily: "I wish he were
my Emperor and not you, you moody boy!"</p>

<p>Leopold appeared to be struggling with himself. The colour
crept up behind his fine skin. The hands he still held above the
blue stone stove trembled. He looked earnestly at the older man,
and earnestly spoke:</p>

<p>"Hensdorff, will you do this service for me? You can speak to
Christian&mdash;you seem to admire him: no doubt you are in his
confidence. Can you tell him something?"</p>

<p>"I dare say I can tell him anything," said Hensdorff. "It is a
question what heed he will take of what I say."</p>

<p>"Whether he takes heed or not, I wish that you would tell him
this..." Leopold paused, bit his full lips, and glanced away as
if ashamed of what he was about to say. Then, with an effort, he
spoke, and spoke with suppressed passion. "Tell him this,
Hensdorff: not to cross me again; not to push me too far; not to
flourish overmuch; not to conduct himself with insolence towards
me. I may be a cipher, Hensdorff; but my birth is not mean."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was surprised by the tense feeling with which the
young man spoke. He had not believed that the affair of the two
generals had hit him so hard, nor Christian's bearing galled and
vexed him so deeply. "Can you?" insisted Leopold, in a low,
intense voice. "Can you tell him that? It would be to the benefit
of all of us, Hensdorff."</p>

<p>The minister did not know if this would be in the least a
politic message to take to the victorious Generalissimo, who was,
he believed, absolutely unconscious of any offence towards his
master. He therefore hesitated, trying to get at the mood of
Leopold. "Tell him that," insisted the young man, taking his
hands from the vague heat of the stove and putting them into his
bosom. "Tell him to be careful, for all our sakes." And he added,
almost in a whisper: "There is not much more that I can
bear."</p>

<p>"I will tell him," said Hensdorff, puzzled, "but I wish, Sire,
you would give me some better understanding of the bottom of all
this tumult that you appear to suffer."</p>

<p>"Ah, tumult!" replied Leopold, faintly. "That's the word. I do
indeed suffer, Hensdorff; and, as I have said, there is not much
more that I can well endure. If I must, for many reasons, go
through the part I have taken up, tell Prince Christian not to
press me further."</p>

<p>"I will," conceded Hensdorff, doubtfully, "do, Sire, what I
can."</p>

<p>Leopold picked up his gloves from the low wooden chair near
the stove, and fitted them on carefully, finger by finger. "Do
not forget," he said, earnestly. "I beg of you, Count Hensdorff,
do not forget&mdash;he is so lavishly prodigal in his
extravagance in all things&mdash;let him be careful at least in
this his attitude toward me."</p>

<p>"I will," repeated the minister, "do what I am able in this
matter. May I, at the same time, give Your Majesty some
advice&mdash;and not unimportant advice? Will you, on your part,
be careful how you go with Christian? He is, as you know, most
arrogant and even insolent. There is little he will endure that
savours of a slight. Your Majesty has spoken of affronting him.
There, I must implore you to be very prudent, lest this secret
humour of yours appears in your gesture or your speech."</p>

<p>Leopold was still busy with his gloves.</p>

<p>"You think," he asked, with a catch in his breath, "you think
Prince Christian, then, might be dangerous, after all? Even
though he <i>is</i> so nice in his honour, and so jealous of his
plighted word?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff shrugged and grimaced. "I do not know what the man
might do if he were affronted or slighted," he said. "But for the
moment I did not think of that. I thought that you, and I, and
all of us, Sire, owed something to Christian, and that it was
scarcely decent to permit private dislike to efface
gratitude."</p>

<p>Leopold repeated that last word sullenly.</p>

<p>"Gratitude!" he said; "yes, I am supposed to feel gratitude
towards him, when this ruthless waste, this hot carnage sickens
me." He glanced obliquely at Hensdorff, and added, breathlessly:
"Where is that fellow Gabor? I have asked you about him
before."</p>

<p>"Gabor," said Hensdorff, "is in Brussels: my principal agent
there. I have found him a most able fellow, although I hear that
he, as of Prince Christian, has incurred the displeasure of Your
Majesty."</p>

<p>"He was in Christian's employ, not mine!" cried Leopold, with
some violence. "He came to me with backstair tales of his master,
and I sent him away."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hensdorff, "now, Sire, you would have him back to
hear these tales again, perhaps?"</p>

<p>Leopold coloured swiftly. "It is not for that," he stammered.
"I have a mission for the man. I have a matter that only he could
deal with."</p>

<p>Hensdorff objected, doubtfully: "Does this touch on politics,
Sire?" And Leopold answered, immediately and with scorn: "No,
Count Hensdorff; you may be satisfied: I do not mingle in your
politics any more than I mingle in the tactics of Prince
Christian; but something, I suppose, I may have to myself? There
may be some affair in which I may privately interest myself?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff bowed; not without irony.</p>

<p>"Well, then, in such a one I wish the assistance of that
Transylvanian, that sly and cunning wretch you find so
useful."</p>

<p>"When I next see him I will acquaint Your Majesty," assented
Hensdorff, privately resolving to do nothing of the kind. He did
not accept Leopold's explanation, but believed what was indeed
the truth, that he wished to get hold of Gabor to work some
mischief to Christian; though the exact measure and depth of this
mischief Hensdorff was far, indeed, from suspecting.</p>

<p>The insistent calls of gathered trumpets broke their speech.
Leopold's sumptuous escort was crowding and clanking in the outer
room, all in high spirits because of yesterday.</p>

<p>When he realized that the final signal for sudden departure
had come, such an expression of loathing and revolt crossed the
young man's face that Hensdorff was alarmed.</p>

<p>"I beg you, Sire," he whispered, impetuously, "put a better
gloss upon it, whatever your private humour!"</p>

<p>Leopold whispered back, in a tone of passionate emphasis:
"Tell Prince Christian to be careful!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">WITHIN a fortnight, Brussels had fallen, and the
swift brilliancy of Christian's splendid success echoed
throughout Europe. He had also cleared Leopold's hereditary
dominions, Bavaria and the Palatinate, of the enemy, who had
retreated into Hanover and the Low Countries. Always famous, he
had lately become the most notable figure in the theatre of war;
that is to say, in the civilized world. He possessed just those
qualities, and his triumphs were of just that nature that strike
the popular mind. He was, as Hensdorff had remarked, a ready-made
hero for the vulgar. He lacked nothing that is generally admired
in the man of action. Even his insolent composure and his
theatrical graces, often found so unbearable by his equals and
superiors, were but added attributes in the eyes of his
inferiors; they did not find the noble grace of his prime of
manhood marred by his extravagance of splendour.</p>

<p>If not amiable, he was just; if overlavish, at least generous;
if insensible and even cruel on occasion, of most unparalleled
bravery. In brief, he was soon the idol of the Imperialists, and
greatly admired even by the enemy he had so rapidly outwitted and
so signally defeated.</p>

<p>At Brussels he laid his plans for the coronation of the
Emperor, and wrote a long letter to the Duchess of
Schönbuchel.</p>

<p>"My dear Duchess, I may be home even sooner than I had
expected." So his letter began. And the old woman who read it
found a certain pathos in the use of the word "home" by such a
man. Did he call Ottenheim&mdash;this gaudy château, adorned with
plunder&mdash;"home"? A new place, fresh from the builders'
hands? The parks just laid out, the pictures and escutcheons just
hung up? Was this home to the disinherited man?</p>

<p>She wrote back the most glowing congratulations on his
continued and impressive successes. She even forgave the disgrace
of her old friend Olivenza, who, after all, she conceded, had
behaved very badly.</p>

<p>The Duchess also endeavoured to impress upon the waiting
Eleanora something of the substantial glories that her husband
was achieving; but here she made little impression. War and all
that appertained to war was vagueness itself to the girl. But
when she heard her husband's return to Ottenheim spoken of, she
winced and shivered a little within herself. But she sent another
dutiful little note of congratulation, which Christian received
in the midst of his unspeakable triumph in Brussels, and which
went to join that other foolish letter of hers in a case of
silvered leather which he kept always in his pocket.</p>

<p>During his leisure in the Brabant capital, Christian bought
new adornments for his distant château&mdash;tapestries and
pictures&mdash;pictures by Rubens and tapestries from Flanders,
lace and statuary, fans of feathers, yards of brocade, stiff with
golden thread. His antechamber was crowded by merchants and
dealers. He made his purchases with the lavishness of one who
could count on the resources of a nation to pay his bills, or
else, as one of the officers who did not like him remarked, with
the carelessness of one who may fall so low that no accounts will
ever be rendered. But the handling of rich fabrics and the
judging of glowing pictures was his brief pastime. Mostly he
worked, all through the days and partly through the nights. He
had the entire administration of the army on his shoulders; he
was but feebly seconded by his subordinates, and he allowed no
detail to pass without his acute supervision. He knew, and no man
better, the peril of the Imperial position. The campaign was
still but half won, even with the recovery of Brussels, momentous
as that was. The more definitely the Allies were defeated, the
more fully and desperately they would rally. Reinforcements were
coming from England, new recruits were being raised in the
Elector of Hanover's domain, and the Dutch were gathering in good
earnest to defend their beloved flats and swamps.</p>

<p>Christian had no intention of fighting beyond the Imperial
dominion; once the enemy were driven back behind their own
frontiers, he had no further concern for them. He knew that his
own resources would not prevent him from long carrying on an
offensive warfare. It was his intention to clear the enemy out of
the Emperor's estates, to crown him, and then make a peace on
that basis; or, if not a peace, at least a truce. Permanent peace
had not been in his experience; all he wished for was a year or
so of leisure, in which to enjoy his reward.</p>

<p>For himself, he did not believe that Leopold would long hold
the throne, even with the aid of France, who was so lavishly
pouring out blood and treasure in his cause; but that was little
concern of his. He was quite capable of making his peace and his
terms with whatever Prince wore the Imperial Diadem. He had the
choice of transferring his entire allegiance to France, or of
reigning alone in Kurland and holding that duchy against them
all. There were many alternatives open to Christian, and he cared
little about the ultimate issue of the combat as long as he could
fulfil his promise and redeem his bargain.</p>

<p>He had, by his late impressive successes, extraordinarily
consolidated his position and his value. He need never fear to
lack honours and employment now. It mattered little to him
whether these came from Leopold or another. The King of France
had sent him a letter couched in the most flattering terms, and
with it the baton of a Maréchal de France. He could now wear over
his Field-Marshal's uniform the collar of the Saint-Esprit, to
mingle with that of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>On the day of the entry into Brussels, Leopold had taken the
glitter of his own insignia from his breast, and flung it over
the shoulders of the victorious general. He had done this with
the easiest and most amiable of gestures, and none could have
guessed how his heart revolted within him the while.</p>

<p>But more to him than such sparkling, though trifling, honours,
was Kurland. Christian was now assured of Kurland, and his mind
roamed over his native province from shore to frontier,
considering what he would do with it, how it should be fortified
and guarded, exploited, what universities, and churches, and
palaces he would build.</p>

<p>And, in the most poignant of his dreams, was the vision of
Eleanora in the palace where he had been brought up as a boy. He
could picture those incredibly high stairs where she would tread,
those deep-set windows from which she would look down, the
balconies from which she would view the city, the garden where
she would tend the planting of her favourite blooms; and he
snatched time, even now, to interview architects and gardeners as
to the improvement of this same palace, now shut up, neglected,
awaiting his arrival. For both the Polish and the Russian
Pretenders had fled at the outbreak of a popular revolution, and
the Diet sitting in Mitau had sent a formal invitation to
Christian to come and claim his own as soon as the war should
permit; he had always been adored in Kurland. They there loyally
called him Ketlar, and forgot the blot that others were so
maliciously delighted to remember.</p>

<p>There was a gala night at the Opera, where the liberated city
must celebrate her deliverance; and Leopold sat in a box with
many mirrors to receive the homage of the excited people. The
theatre was ringed with lights, like chained and ordered stars,
which were reflected in these mirrors of the Royal Box as if in
some immense depth of water; Leopold was displayed in a great
velvet chair with arms raised a step higher than any of those
other chairs. He held a satin programme, on which gleamed gilt
names. The air was languid with the scent of hothouse flowers,
with the perfume of waxen candles and with enclosed, artificial
warmth. Beside Leopold sat his sister, the Archduchess Maria
Luisa. She also held a white satin programme, and her eyes
glanced down at it continually. The Countess Carola was behind
her with two other ladies. Leopold had asked Christian to join
him in the Royal Box. The Generalissimo had refused; not, as
Leopold thought, from modesty, for General Crack did not know the
meaning of that sentiment, but that there might be no confusion
between their two receptions&mdash;the formal and chilly homage
paid to Leopold must in no way be mingled with the excitement of
the welcome given to the adored hero of the moment.</p>

<p>Christian with the Maréchal De Lisle and several other French
and Austrian officers, was in a <i>loge</i> opposite to, but
lower than that of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff had not wished the Countess Carola to share
these Imperial honours, but Leopold had wilfully insisted, as he
had again begun to find a certain consolation in the languishing
charms of this black-eyed lady. She at least whole-heartedly
admired him&mdash;or pretended to do so. She gave no hint of
being turned from her admiration of Leopold by the latest
successes and obvious attractions of Christian; she was his
palpable vassal, adoring, waiting; possibly she might make him
forget the stings of his late misfortune.</p>

<p>Christian was already in his place when Leopold arrived, and
every one was staring at the stupendous hero. Leopold glanced
impatiently away from that gaudy show opposite, and gazed at the
stage, at present covered by a gleaming saffron-coloured satin
curtain, looped and ruffled with myriads of stars and suns formed
of glass sequins.</p>

<p>The opera was that popular favourite, <i>Alexander in
Egypt</i>, and Martinelli was to sing; he had come from Naples on
purpose for this grandiose occasion. Leopold delighted in music,
and was a considerable amateur musician himself, but he detested
to hear it in public, and proposed to himself no pleasure from
the official overwhelming magnificence of the spectacle
promised.</p>

<p>He said to Hensdorff, who stood behind him:</p>

<p>"I shall be glad when it is over."</p>

<p>And Hensdorff could not resist the ironic reply:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that Your Majesty will be glad when everything
is over. You are always wishing for every matter to come to a
conclusion."</p>

<p>But he was startled by the tragic manner in which the young
man whispered back:</p>

<p>"I shall indeed, Hensdorff, be glad when everything is
over!"</p>

<p>The orchestra took their places, and there was tuning of
violins and delicate instruments. Hensdorff suddenly remembered
something that he had wished to say to Leopold all day. He leant
low behind the pompous chair, and whispered:</p>

<p>"That fellow Gabor, Sire&mdash;do you still wish to see
him?"</p>

<p>Leopold stared across the theatre at Christian, who was
laughing with the French officers; in every gesture showing
flaunting arrogance.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Emperor, flatly, "I wish to see him. See that
it is arranged, Hensdorff."</p>

<p>The Duchess Maria Luisa was also looking at Christian. She had
indeed looked at nothing else except her programme since she had
entered the theatre. Leopold noted her gaze, and said:</p>

<p>"I suppose to you he seems a very great hero indeed?" And she
replied, guardedly, from behind the plumy wave of her rosy
fan:</p>

<p>"I suppose he has done very well, Sire."</p>

<p>"Very well, as you may perceive," smiled Leopold, waving his
hand round the theatre. "All this is owing to him, and we are
enjoying it vastly&mdash;are we not, Luisa? You heard, too, how
the people were all acclaiming him as we came in. Even out of
respect to us they hardly silenced themselves."</p>

<p>"But it has all been for you, Sire," replied Maria Luisa. "His
victories have all been for you."</p>

<p>"And at a price," smiled Leopold; "at a price, my dear
Luisa!"</p>

<p>The Archduchess thought curiously:</p>

<p>"That girl: he didn't want to give up that girl; I wonder what
sort of creature she is. I should like to see her."</p>

<p>And aloud she asked: "Why does not Prince Christian send for
his wife? Why should she not come here to join in his
triumphs?"</p>

<p>"She is safe in Ottenheim," said Leopold, still with that
fixed smile; "she is far too precious for him to parade before
the crowd."</p>

<p>"Yet from what I hear," replied the Archduchess, slightly,
"she is nothing; only a pretty child."</p>

<p>"Nothing," murmured Leopold; "nothing!"</p>

<p>The Archduchess asked: "Cannot we have Prince Christian here
with us in the box? I have not yet spoken to him, and it would
amuse me to do so."</p>

<p>"I am willing that he should come," replied Leopold, stiffly,
"but both he and Hensdorff, who are our masters, you know, my
dear Luisa, have arranged otherwise."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa looked at him timidly, alarmed by the ironic
bitterness in his voice. She also felt uneasy, aware of a certain
brittleness about all this glory, all this elaborate beauty which
had the transparent and elusive quality of the rainbow, of the
bubble, passing and deceptive radiance, through which the hand of
reality might at any moment be rudely thrust, dispersing it to
the careless heavens.</p>

<p>She knew instinctively that they might be applauded, but that
they were not yet safe; but she was well trained to show none of
her feelings, least of all her feelings of dismay. She remained
erect and prim in her brocaded seat, and looked away from her
brother so as not to give him the opportunity for any more
disturbing and painful remarks.</p>

<p>The theatre became very hot. Mingled with perfume was the
sickly sweetness from all the caskets of sweets and preserves
that were being opened, the sweetness of dried violets and rose
leaves, and of fine sugar. There was a globe of lapis lazuli
above the proscenium, crowned with laurels and lilies, and
supported by gay and redundant angels. Maria Luisa watched this
sphere until it seemed to be swimming in the warm space; she did
not care to any longer watch General Crack. There was a soft and
incessant chattering, subdued by respect; there was a perpetual
waving of fans, and a movement of headdresses adorned with
feathers and knots of ribbons and jewels. Maria Luisa was very
conscious of her own jewels, the famous and flamboyant gems of
the House of Austria. She and her brother both wore, by the
express advice of Hensdorff, the black and silver of Hapsburg.
Above the box, she knew, was the Imperial Eagle, spreading his
sumptuous and pretentious plumage.</p>

<p>The candle-snuffers went about in decorously laced uniforms.
The theatre became like a cabinet of sweets, of perfume, of
preserved flowers. The atmosphere was fragrantly stifling.</p>

<p>The orchestra began to play the Overture, and the chattering
conversation slackened a little.</p>

<p>Leopold was so fond of music that he became at once enamoured
of the dancing melody, and leaned forward a little from his
official seat, entranced to forgetfulness of the crowd by the new
vision of heavenly kingdoms conjured up by the elaborate,
fantastic and sophisticated melody. He seemed to be removed at
once from his formal and slightly ridiculous position. He forgot
Christian opposite, and joined the visionary company of Eleanora
in the beechwoods on the Danube.</p>

<p>The curtain went up on an Eastern scene that sparkled with
gems, and gold and silver threads entwined in velvets and satins,
and in the aigrettes of sultans and sultanas.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa dared now to watch Christian. There was a circle
of candles underneath his box, which threw a full light on his
resplendent person. She could see him very clearly. She noticed
how easily he conversed and laughed with the French generals:
much more easily than he ever conversed or laughed with her
brother. He was at home with these men, in whose company he had
been educated, in a way he would never be at home with the
Germans or Austrians: he was alien, she reflected, a
foreigner.</p>

<p>He was speaking French as if that language gave him pleasure.
Even through the music she could now and then catch his voice as
he made some lively comment to his companion. He wore his
Field-Marshal's uniform and all his orders. He was more radiantly
bedizened than any gorgeous figure on the stage.</p>

<p>The music and the singing voices mounted, casting enchantments
round the gilded elegance of the packed theatre. The applause was
instant and enthusiastic. Every one was elated and excited. The
Italian tenor, singing like a nightingale, had the power even to
change the mood of Leopold, who was able to forget his vexation
and his melancholia as he listened; he was even able to cast off
his besetting sense of the futility and foolishness of it all, of
the hollowness of this pompous show, of this arrogant parade of
victory and conquest.</p>

<p>The pageant of the stage mingled with the pageant of the
auditorium. All the colours, all the metallic hues of gold and
silver, copper and bronze, seemed to float adrift and mingle one
into the other, lambent, giddy, distracting.</p>

<p>Alexander on the stage, fully adorned for war, seemed but the
reflexion of Christian in his mirrored box, bedecked in complete
military parade. The scintillating glitter of the theatric gems
was replied to by the sparkle of the jewels worn by the audience.
The emeralds and the rubies in the turbans of the captive Indian
princes and the defeated sultans sparkled no more brightly than
the stars and crosses on the breasts of the generals and the
Emperor.</p>

<p>All seemed one ostentatious ceremonial&mdash;profuse,
voluptuous and arrogant, vanity on vanity, all to emphasize the
enormous importance of the late victory and to impress by this
flaunt of elation the already drooping spirits of the enemy.</p>

<p>As Alexander proceeded to his gorgeous triumph amid an
elaborate fanfare of trumpets, to every one in the audience, and
not least to Leopold, it was the triumph of Christian that was
celebrated; and when La Giralda, the beautiful and notorious
actress, robed with every extreme of symbolism and splendour as
Victory, stepped down with a laurel crown glittering with
diamonds in her white hand, it was not to the actor she turned,
not to that buskined and artificial hero, but to Prince Christian
seated in his box and leaning with his air of tolerant amusement
towards the stage.</p>

<p>Amid the plaudits of the audience, it was to Christian she
offered the triumphal crown. She had made, it is true, a dutiful
reverence towards the Imperial Box; but this was a mere
formality. General Crack, and he alone, received her homage, as
he received the homage of the audience, who now, half rising from
their seats, interrupted the pageant of the play to take their
part in this other pageant which, to them at least, was
reality.</p>

<p>Christian received this ostentatious compliment with the
correct gesture of good-humoured tolerance, and graceful
indifference. He was indeed but little moved. He knew how to
value such moments of frantic enthusiasm at their real worth. If
he did not dislike the gaudy moment, at least he was neither
bewildered nor impressed by it. He put aside the wreath with easy
smiles and light words to the generals behind him.</p>

<p>The actress, with full exercise of all her indolent charms,
continued to urge his acceptance; and the Maréchal De Lisle at
last took the sparkling laurels and flung them on to Christian's
arm. The applause was tremendous. Leopold saw his own sister lean
forward over the edge of the box, and clap her two delicate hands
together, flushing under her brilliant rouge. For himself, he did
nothing, but remained mute, with his inevitable part of silent
majesty.</p>

<p>He knew that Christian fully merited this triumph, which had
been gained by sheer feats of arms and the overcoming of
considerable difficulties. His endurance and his courage, his
judgment and his prudence, had alike been hugely tried; and his
flashing success was the measure of his qualities.</p>

<p>When the curtain went down on the first act, Maria Luisa
suggested to her brother that Christian should be sent for; and
this time, Leopold did not or could not demur. He spoke to
Hensdorff, and Hensdorff spoke to an officer, and an officer to a
page; and within a moment or two the victor of St. Omer was in
the Imperial Box, towards which all eyes were now directed in a
manner in which they had not been directed when it was occupied
only by the Emperor and his sister.</p>

<p>Christian was, naturally, in a good humour with every one; but
he was still careful to conceal too much satisfaction or
exultation; not only in adversity or in trial, but in success and
splendour, his constant endeavour was to preserve that composure
which he considered the symbol of strength; of breeding. It was
his most passionate desire to conceal both his thoughts and his
emotions from the comments of other men; how carefully there he
had copied the French Princes, always so languorous and
indifferent, how ardently he had taught himself to repress the
violence and passion of his Southern taint, he alone knew. Maria
Luisa stirred, and motioned to the chair beside her. She appeared
different from the tired woman who had greeted him in the
corridor of the palace at Berlin. Her high, curled, powdered hair
was crowned by a circlet of white, waxy, scentless hothouse
flowers. The bodice on which sparkled the immemorially old jewels
of the House of Austria was of rich blue velvet; her train was
lined with ermine. She was fine, elegant, highly bred, fragile.
For a second Christian, kissing her finger tips, amused himself
by the reflection that he might on this occasion have sat beside
this woman as her husband&mdash;an Imperial Archduke.</p>

<p>He turned deferentially to Leopold, however, and Leopold rose
with a certain impatience; their two glittering figures were
reflected in the dusky, candle-lit mirrors, making four glitters,
with, behind them, the vaguer figures of the Princess and the
Countess Carola, who was a hushed vehemence, a controlled ardour
in flaming blue.</p>

<p>To Leopold the scene was fast becoming merged in one sparkling
giddiness. He held himself stiffly, and spoke mechanical
sentences, appropriate and yet meaningless: for they were merely
the result of long schooling in saying appropriate things.</p>

<p>When the coquettish curtain went up again, he drew back into
the recesses of the box, abandoning the Imperial chair, to which
none of the whispered inducements of Hensdorff could persuade him
to return. The two women had gracefully detained Christian in the
Imperial Box; very luxurious, very extravagant, strong and
handsome, adorned by his obvious and showy successes, he stood
between them; and Leopold noted that they both flattered
him&mdash;Maria Luisa, with her majestic timidity, the Countess
Carola with her languishing yet fiery air of enticement and
promise. Both of them had forgotten Leopold and Hensdorff and the
other ladies behind; with word and gesture and look, they
praised, flattered, and paid homage to General Crack. Nothing
could have been more odious or ridiculous to the Emperor.</p>

<p>Immediately the performance was over, Leopold left the box and
retired into the antechamber behind it, where wines and
sweetmeats were served on tables of antique yellow marble covered
with lace. He drew the curtains impulsively across the entrance
to the box, but he could still hear the ovations coming from the
theatre&mdash;the applause, once, twice and thrice renewed, given
to Christian, the immense shouts of his name, of his
praises&mdash;how easy to turn the heads of women and fools!</p>

<p>Leopold poured out wine from the first bottle to his
hand&mdash;poured it out so violently that he spilled it across
the marble table, and drank, and sat down heavily with his head
in his hands. Hensdorff had followed him, and looked at him with
a certain anxiety. He could understand that Leopold was torn with
jealousy, and sympathized with the difficult position of the
unhappy young man.</p>

<p>At last the ladies left the box, and came into the
antechamber. Maria Luisa was elegantly leaning on the arm of
Christian, and looking up into his face as if enraptured by the
least change of his expression or the smallest word he deigned to
speak; her small, frail person quivered with admiration.</p>

<p>Leopold groaned within his heart; he felt sick with their
mutual humiliation.</p>

<p>"How can she?" he thought to himself; "how can she? With that
man, and after what has happened!"</p>

<p>But if his sister's behaviour gave him this poignant pang, he
was even more sourly moved to see the admiration of the Countess
Carola diverted from himself to this victorious hero of a
theatric hour. That capricious beauty hardly glanced at Leopold,
though he was arrayed in all his Imperial splendour; exercising
all those arts which Leopold had once found so delicious, she
competed with Maria Luisa for the graces of Christian, who
appeared by no means indifferent. Leopold was unequal to this
situation, as he had been unequal to every situation in which he
had yet found himself. He rose heavily, and led the way from the
theatre.</p>

<p>Christian shared his coach; green leather, lavishly painted,
elaborately adorned, swinging lightly on the leathers, drawn by
eight red-apparelled white horses. In the dark streets, the
gathered people shouted for Christian, as in the bright theatre
those others had shouted. No voice was raised for the Emperor;
nor did the two women in the coach appear to notice this
omission. They seemed to have made themselves one with the
triumph of Christian, and to be elated at his elation. And that
Christian was cool before all this giddy adulation only added to
the deep vexation of Leopold, who thought:</p>

<p>"The higher the peak, the deeper the abyss&mdash;to make him
fall as no man has fallen since. Belisarius!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a reception after the Opera, in the
house of the Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, now, after so
long, returned in triumph to his residence.</p>

<p>Leopold had to move about among his important guests, making
himself agreeable, coining himself, as it were, into compliments,
caressing smiles, and looks, to retain these influential people
loyal to his cause.</p>

<p>All of them praised the victorious general to his face, and he
had to endure that and agree with the galling laudations of the
man whom he more and more detested. He had to endure the
spectacle of the Archduchess and the Countess Carola Borgonie,
both like nymphs attendant on the god Mars, forever by the side
of General Crack, competing, as it seemed to Leopold in his
bitterness, for his lightest favour.</p>

<p>Leopold found an opportunity to call Hensdorff nervously
aside.</p>

<p>"Have you," he asked, in an eager whisper, "told Prince
Christian what I begged you to tell him&mdash;given him, in
brief, my warning?"</p>

<p>"Your warning?" asked Hensdorff, amazed; for in this hurried
moment he could not recall what Leopold meant. Then, before that
young man answered, he remembered the scene in the parlour of the
grange the day after the great battle of St. Omer.</p>

<p>"Sire," he replied, sternly, "Prince Christian has given me
neither excuse nor opportunity for such a warning."</p>

<p>"Look at him," Leopold replied, hastily, "now with my sister
and the Countess Carola Borgonie; does he bear himself like a man
who takes his honours modestly?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff glanced at the superb victor, but could see no such
form of offence as Leopold discerned.</p>

<p>"He bears himself like any soldier in a moment of arrogant
victory, he is young too," he replied. "Your Majesty does wrong
to take so much heed of those who fight for you. Use them and let
them go; that is the only philosophy."</p>

<p>"It is one to which I have not attained," said Leopold,
dully.</p>

<p>Christian was leaning over the back of the Archduchess's
chair. The Golden Fleece, burning and sparkling on his breast,
touched her bare, white shoulder. On a stool before the Princess
sat the Countess Carola, gleaming in cobalt satin, powdered with
pearls&mdash;sparkling from her pomaded hair to the flashing
diamonds on her tiny shoes; she was gazing up at Christian also,
and her tinkling laugh adorned his speech.</p>

<p>It seemed to Leopold as if this man might have either of those
women, both of whom were dear and something sacred to himself, by
the mere putting out of his hand. "So easy! So easy!" he said,
furiously, in his heart. "Even Luisa falls so easily, to the
first flashy adventurer. What is he but a mercenary soldier who
well knows his trade, who may be bought at any moment if the
price be high enough?" And he reflected, sickening, the price
that <i>he</i> had paid, and the price that he had offered: two
women, one woman waiting for the victor in Ottenheim, the other
woman sitting there looking as if she were ready to fall at his
feet. Could not she also recall how she had been put forward and
rejected?</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff still remained by the Emperor's side, watching
the sparkling scene which was to him a certain seal upon his
strenuous endeavours, a certain insignia of success&mdash;as
definitely as the collar of The Golden Fleece was the insignia of
Christian's success.</p>

<p>"Send me," said Leopold, abruptly, "that scoundrel Gabor. I
have some work for him."</p>

<p>Hensdorff looked at him doubtfully. He did not greatly care
for this frequent mention of Gabor on Leopold's lips. He
associated it with his dislike for Christian, though he did not
for one second associate it with Eleanora. It was unlike Leopold
to have secret dealings with any one, and Hensdorff was wise
enough to beware of any unlikely trait in any one's character;
especially such a character as that of Leopold. When he did
anything which was not in accordance with his usual nature, it
would probably be something dangerous.</p>

<p>"Gabor is in the palace now, I think, Sire," he replied,
doubtfully; "but to what end would you see him? Whatever your
purpose, you might find a more proper instrument."</p>

<p>But Leopold insisted.</p>

<p>"Send him to my chamber to-night, when I am alone at last. I
suppose I <i>shall</i> be alone, somewhere towards the dawn. I
must and will see that man, Hensdorff, and if you do not send him
to me, I will find him for myself, no matter at what cost and
scandal."</p>

<p>So it happened that Gabor had a private audience of the
Emperor when the palace in Brussels was at length silent; when
the city was sleeping at last, after the gala and tumults of
rejoicing, the Te Deum, the fireworks, the music and the
pageantry of triumphs.</p>

<p>Leopold had not been able to command his temper with his
sister; he had spoken to her sharply, almost cruelly, about her
manner to Christian, reminding her bitterly both of what the man
really was, and their one-time relationship towards him. To his
distressed amazement, she had taken this reproof with a very
passion of tears and reproaches, turning on him so violently that
he had been startled; incoherently defending herself and
defending Christian, like one whose nerves had stretched to an
unbearable tension; and then had swept from him with darkling
looks of scorn, and left him dismayed and overwhelmed.</p>

<p>To the Countess Carola he disdained to speak; but that evening
he had heard many a light whisper which consigned that capricious
lady to Christian. "A conquest!" one had said: "not quite so
difficult but more pleasant than that of Tournay or Mons."</p>

<p>Another had remarked that the lady had endured an even briefer
siege than the city of Brussels.</p>

<p>Leopold, waiting in the anteroom to his bedchamber, had
dismissed his valets, having taken off all the gauds which seemed
to him so many taunts to his inefficiency. Wrapped in his
dressing-gown, and with the lights of but one cluster of candles,
he waited for Gabor. The fire had burnt low on the hearth and the
room was chill, but Leopold had set the windows wide over the
sleeping city.</p>

<p>The Transylvanian entered, lightly and delicately. He had long
been expecting this summons. Patiently he had gone away, exactly
he had done his work, knowing that, sooner or later, Leopold
would send for him. He had been one of the obscurer members of
the audience at the opera that night. From the back of the
brilliant theatre he had watched the two men&mdash;Leopold, set
up like an image in his high chair, hung with brilliants and his
orders, Christian flourishing in his own box among the French
marshals in their blue and silver.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor, with his cold and subtle wit, had been able
to read the minds of the two men. He could have told the very
point at which Leopold had noticed his sister looking at
Christian; the very moment when he had found the proximity of
Christian and those two women unbearable, and so had withdrawn
into the warm shadows of the gorgeous box. He could read, too,
the amused indifference of Christian which further inflamed the
Emperor, and the excited admiration of the two women, stirred by
the superb bravery of the man's appearance, by the obvious glory
and splendour of his triumph, by the heady music and the
flamboyancy of the rich occasion. Gabor, smiling to himself in
his back seat, could read all this, and in it all copious
material for his plans.</p>

<p>Walking daintily across the soft carpet, he stopped before
Leopold, who had not looked up at his approach, but sat there,
sullen, with downcast head before that wide-flung window which
opened on the winter darkness.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Gabor, at length, "there is a draught, and the
candles will gutter."</p>

<p>Leopold was startled at his insolence in speaking before he
was addressed, but he knew that already he could not resent any
insolence from Gabor. He watched the candles, where the wax was
floating down in a winding sheet onto the silver sticks.</p>

<p>"Have you heard any more from Ottenheim?" he asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Only," said Gabor, delicately, "only, Sire, that the girl
mopes and pines."</p>

<p>Leopold put his cold hand to his chilled forehead.</p>

<p>"How do you know she mopes and pines?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"I have my agents in Ottenheim as in other places, Sire,"
replied the Transylvanian. "I was many years in Prince
Christian's service, and still am in communication with those who
serve him now."</p>

<p>This was true enough, and Gabor had much information as to the
petty details of that lonely household in the Château on the
Danube.</p>

<p>"The winter comes on," he continued, in a low voice; "all
those brilliant birds that Christian paid so much for are dead,
or dying; and the antelopes and gazelles also shiver and die.
There are no longer any flowers on the ground, any leaves on the
trees; and the waters, instead of being blue or green, are now
grey. There are clouds, both over the sun by day and over the
moon by night; and the stars seldom show. Those big rooms seem
very empty to the Princess Eleanora; she is far from every one
she knew, save that old woman&mdash;who is, after all,
Christian's watchdog, Christian's spy."</p>

<p>"Is she?" said Leopold, hotly. He had not thought of this.
"Has he won over that old harridan, then?"</p>

<p>"He has," said Gabor. "She sends him her reports, like a
guardian reporting on a prisoner. Eleanora does this, or does
that; Eleanora thinks of this, or thinks of that: it is all taken
down and sent to her lord and master, who, in his turn, is never
so occupied, Sire, in your affairs, that he cannot send back his
minute instructions as to his wife&mdash;or captive, as you may
choose to take her."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Leopold, moodily, "I might have thought of
that&mdash;he'd have her watched, he would not leave her
unguarded..."</p>

<p>"And there is the garrison, too, and Colonel Pons: when she
rides abroad, Colonel Pons must be her escort; when she stirs,
the garrison must note her going. Do you think that she can long
endure this, and not droop, Sire?"</p>

<p>Leopold did not speak.</p>

<p>"And not think," added Gabor, deliberately, "of the man who
might rescue her?"</p>

<p>"O God!" cried Leopold, passionately. "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>From the pocket of his decent black suit, Gabor pulled out a
fine handkerchief, and stretched it, dragging it exactly corner
to corner. As he did this, he remarked, in an abstracted
manner:</p>

<p>"Prince Christian is taking great pains, Sire, that the
campaign shall soon be over; and when it <i>is</i> over, he will
go back to Ottenheim, and it will be too late."</p>

<p>To such a man as Leopold, the words "too late" are the
bitterest in the world, for he knows full well how often they
must be said about him and his actions.</p>

<p>"Is it true," he asked, huskily, "that she is not well? That
she sickens there in her loneliness?"</p>

<p>"In her waiting&mdash;in her expectations?" smiled Gabor, with
a slight shrug. "What more can I tell Your Majesty? She wrote to
you, and did not, I think, get an answer."</p>

<p>"It was impossible," cried Leopold, agonized, "for me to send
an answer; almost impossible for me to know how to pen an
answer!"</p>

<p>And then he caught himself up, feeling how desperately he was
committing himself before this mean man, this spy, this
scoundrel, this backstairs go-between. And yet he had no other
possible help, no other possible ally.</p>

<p>"It may be," said Gabor, in his most insinuating voice,
flickering his ashy eyes, "that when her husband returns the lady
will recover. He does not seem to find it so difficult to capture
ladies' hearts."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" cried Leopold. "What have
<i>you</i> seen?"</p>

<p>"I was present at the Opera to-night," smiled Gabor, "and I
observed&mdash;as no doubt Your Majesty observed&mdash;how easily
and lightly ladies will lose their hearts to a hero of the
moment. Prince Christian has a showy presence, and those arrogant
manners which impress female hearts. I think there were two or
three there to-night to whom he would not have to sue long in
vain."</p>

<p>"Of course," thought Leopold, furiously, "it was clear to all:
even Maria Luisa&mdash;even my sister! That scene she made
to-night; that uncontrollable passion of agitation: what did that
mean, save that the man had disturbed her heart?"</p>

<p>And had he not heard them talking slightingly of the Countess
Carola: the woman who had been Leopold's Egeria, the woman whom
he had regarded with such a fastidious and such a fantastic
adoration, the object of his high and platonic affection, too
high to be his lover. Was this woman whom Leopold had deemed too
fine for vulgar love to be the momentary mistress of a man like
Christian? Was even this humiliation in store for him? To lose
his promised wife, and, as it were, his promised mistress
too&mdash;and to the same careless, superb insolence of a
mountebank upstart, a base-born hired soldier?</p>

<p>And Gabor was watching him, with contempt, no doubt; it had
come to this, that he must sit there while a man like Gabor
watched him, and spied upon his agitation&mdash;his despair.</p>

<p>"If Your Majesty," suggested the Transylvanian, "were to write
a letter, I think that I could see that it was conveyed to
Ottenheim."</p>

<p>"I'll write no letter!" cried Leopold, wildly. "I have nothing
more to say. You may, Sir, begone, and endeavour, for your own
good, to forget all this affair."</p>

<p>"Forget or remember," smiled Gabor, deferentially, "I would
beg Your Majesty to note there is no advantage to me, either
way."</p>

<p>Leopold rose and violently closed the windows, for the candles
were indeed guttering into ragged, fierce flame, and a great
sheet of wax had dripped past the sticks onto the buhl table. He
paced up and down the room, still pressing his cold hand to his
forehead.</p>

<p>"You will write no letter, then, Sire?" insinuated Gabor. "To
me the matter is nothing; only I have some pity for the lady, who
seems to me to have been somewhat abused in the interests of
politics."</p>

<p>"Curse these infernal politics," flung out Leopold. "Curse
these diabolical wars! It is all a nightmare!"</p>

<p>"But one from which Your Majesty, if you are not wary, will
never wake," said Gabor, "or only wake to death," he added
quickly, under his breath.</p>

<p>Leopold stayed his pacings by the sinking embers of the wide
hearth, and stared down into the dying glow with vacant gaze.
Gabor softly approached him.</p>

<p>"There is, Sire," he said, "yet one other alternative: if you
will not write, you might yourself go to Ottenheim."</p>

<p>Leopold looked at him, as if fascinated, across his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Go myself to Ottenheim?" he repeated. "You talk moonshine,
madness!"</p>

<p>Gabor gave his jerking shrug.</p>

<p>"Christian," he remarked, "is occupied with the war; Your
Majesty might gain a few days' absence from headquarters. Surely
you are not yet such a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Such a slave to this man, you would say?" added Leopold,
bitterly. "Say what you like, for I cannot take offence from
<i>you</i>, Ferdinand Gabor: I am come so low as that! But never
dream," he added, "that I shall go to Ottenheim. Do not even
think of such a thing; do not even let such words pass your lips
again."</p>

<p>Gabor bowed ironically.</p>

<p>"Then I have nothing more to say, Sire," he remarked, "and I
fear, Sire, that I can be of no use to Your Majesty. As for my
news which you ask&mdash;it merely comes to this: again I tell
you that the girl mopes and pines, and maybe, so the doctors say,
before the spring she'll die. These little creatures, Sire, have
a very light hold on life; and often, in losing their happiness,
they lose their all."</p>

<p>Leopold bowed his head upon the marble mantelpiece, but did
not answer. One by one, the lingering coals dropped into
blackness on the hearth, and the harsh cold filled the large,
pompous room.</p>

<p>"Go," said Leopold, without turning.</p>

<p>And Gabor bowed ironically to the back of his bent figure,
then turned towards the door.</p>

<p>"I wish Your Majesty good luck!" he said; and left with no
more than that, and yet did not leave without a deep
impressiveness.</p>

<p>Leopold shivered, drew his quilted gown closer round him and
glanced fearfully around the room. The silence was oppressive;
both the inner silence of the palace and the outer silence of the
city. It seemed the more oppressive from the contrast with the
late shouts and acclamations, the sound of fireworks and of
music&mdash;all the riotous tumult of the triumphal gala. He went
into his empty bedchamber and raised the curtains of his bed,
glancing hastily within almost as if he expected to see some one
lurking there; then he put out the bracket of lights upon the
centre table, and in the dark paced up and down.</p>

<p>After a while he went to his oratory, where two red lamps
burned above the rich, carved shrine; and there he knelt for
hours, with his brow against the cold stone and his thoughts
bitter within his mind.</p>

<p>Here was no support&mdash;no comfort; he could not pray, nor
open his heart to any invisible powers. When he at last left the
oratory, cramped and cold and shivering, he was no nearer any
resolution or any consolation.</p>

<p>Returning to his large and comfortless chamber, he wearied
through till the dawn, trying to read, trying to think, lighting
candles, quenching them; pacing up and down; sitting down,
exhausted; resting his head on the pillows of his bed and on the
pillows of his chair; gazing with horror at the dead ashes on the
hearth, and the long sheet of wax, now hard and chill, a frozen
pendant from those first guttering candles of his interview with
Gabor.</p>

<p>At length, his circling and distracted thoughts came round to
the Countess Carola. In her he had at one time much delicate
comfort; he could not believe her now wholly disloyal. Leopold
endeavoured to keep his agitated emotions centred on the Countess
Carola: on her tenderness, kindness and sympathetic
understanding, in which so far she had never failed him. He
blamed himself for accusing her too lightly of fickleness last
night. It was but natural that she would be for the moment
dazzled by the <i>éclat</i> that surrounded Christian; but
Leopold could not bring himself to believe that this dazzle would
last long. He had been too harsh with her in his thoughts, as he
had been too harsh to his sister in his behaviour. Neither of
these women must be blamed if they had been led away by the
momentary excitement&mdash;the lights, the music and tumult, the
praises: all the excitement of the triumphal gala. Her attention
to Christian yesterday would not mean that she was any the less
his friend now. He recalled, with some remorse and some pleasure,
his long interviews with her in the Hofburg, in her room papered
with a Japanese rice paper, on which were depicted various
gallant birds, bearing plumes with a martial air high above their
sharp, fantastic heads. There she had played and sang to him, and
with her melodious voice and delicate fingers banished many a
dream of melancholia and tedium, restoring his serenity with
insinuant flatteries and respectful sympathy. He would, he
decided, endeavour to renew this one-time intimacy, which did no
harm to any one, and had in it at once something both noble and
pure. Once more to be enthralled by the Countess Carola Borgonie
would be to forget&mdash;or nearly to forget&mdash;Eleanora; to
recover his present dignity, and possibly his peace of mind.</p>

<p>Leopold, at once impetuous and capricious, decided that to
reestablish his delicate relations with the Countess Carola
before he left Brussels would be to recover much of the poise
which he had lost, to restore himself to some measure of
equanimity, both in his own eyes and those of others; and if she
was yielding, prepared to lean from her pedestal of ineffable
virtue...a mistress must be at least a distraction.</p>

<p>Impulsively, and before he had either slept or dressed, he
snatched aside the heavy curtains from the dawn, which was
turning the sky the colour of nacre, above the city. He then
searched nervously for a pen and paper, and finally found it in
one of the ormolu desks in the anteroom. There he sat down, in
the uncertain light, and began to write: "My dear Carola."
Although he had a sense of awkwardness in penning this epistle,
his mind ran fluently, and he composed, easily enough, the few
sentences which invited the Countess Carola to a return of their
former friendship&mdash;which had been, he well knew, recently
rather neglected by both of them...</p>

<p>He had already, in his mind, put her in the place of his good,
or even his guardian, angel, and as such he addressed her, in
courtly and extravagant terms of homage and respect, striving, as
he wrote, to efface from his mind the memory of her adoring face
turned yesterday towards Christian in the lustre of the ballroom;
one must forget the vulgar display of last night when every one
had lost their heads.</p>

<p>After all, he reflected, as he stamped the Imperial seal on
the soft wax on the envelope, she could do no less than be civil
to Christian: she may even have thought in doing so she was
pleasing himself. "The man is, confound him, in my service, and
fighting for me." And his reflections continued to the point when
he realized that the Countess Carola could not possibly have
known there was any bitterness between him and Christian, or any
possible cause of dispute. In brief, she was utterly ignorant of
the episode of the Princess Eleanora. And Leopold, without too
much difficulty, could persuade himself that all her caressing
glances and pleasant words and agreeable manners last night,
directed towards the conqueror, had merely been to please
himself, whom all the conquests were intended to benefit.</p>

<p>As the day strengthened into his empty room, he made an effort
to shake off all the dark and sinister impressions of
yesterday&mdash;those ugly moments in the Opera and in the
reception room, when he had been eclipsed, nay, more than
eclipsed (as it seemed to his sensitiveness), blasted, by the
triumphs of Christian, by the sumptuous self-assurance with which
Christian received that same triumph.</p>

<p>The Countess Carola lodged in one of the houses on the other
side of the Grande Place. Her husband remained in Vienna, but she
had in her company a bevy of graceful ladies and many
servants.</p>

<p>Gazing at this house across the chill, blank square, which
seemed desolate indeed after the tumultuous gaieties of last
night, he saw a light already in one of the upper windows. The
Countess Carola was probably, like himself, awake and watching;
possibly even thinking of him, as he was thinking of her; he rang
the bell, and when the sleepy valet came gave him the note, and
bade him take it at once to the Countess Carola, with the message
that he would come in an hour or so to breakfast with that lady,
as he had often done in the old, familiar days in the Hofburg.
Maria Luisa might come too, but presently she would go away, and
he would be alone with his goddess, and free to tell her, if not
the heart of his troubles, at least the outward distresses of
them, to receive from her that comfort and consolation, that
sympathy and respect, which he had never failed to find a
grateful cloak over his weaknesses and deficiencies.</p>

<p>Always the Countess Carola had succeeded in exalting him in
his own eyes, and that was what he now wished more than
anything&mdash;to be raised in his own eyes...after last
night.</p>

<p>He watched the valet with the note cross the square, and then
he hastily dressed himself, to escape the tedium of the
attendance of his gentlemen and servants&mdash;a ceremony that he
always detested. He felt relieved, almost elated, as if a
terrible temptation had been offered, and then, on his gesture of
repulsion, on his cry of resistance, had passed. In this softened
mood he thought with regret of his harshness to his sister;
presently he would ask her pardon, perhaps while he was escorting
her across the cold square to the Countess Carola; tell her how
sorry he was for last night, and how wrong he had been; that the
strain and the excitement of the evening had made him both rough
and unjust. Surely she would forgive him, as she had so often
forgiven him faults before&mdash;never, poor child, had she
lacked in tenderness.</p>

<p>The sounds of movements in the palace began. Leopold shrank
nervously into himself on hearing these footsteps; he did not
wish to meet any one&mdash;not any one but the Countess Carola;
till she had soothed him, he was in no mood to face the
world.</p>

<p>The valet returned; he had been on duty all night, dozing in
the adjoining closet. He looked tired, and hardly able to repress
yawns. With a deep obeisance he returned to Leopold the note that
he had just given him.</p>

<p>"I did not, Sire, leave it with the Countess," he said, sly
beneath his servility.</p>

<p>"And why?" demanded Leopold, startled.</p>

<p>"Because, Sire, she was not alone," replied the valet, who was
a man of tact and experience, "and I did not think it would be
your wish that this note should be sent up to her while she was
with company. If I have done wrong I can, Sire, immediately
return with it."</p>

<p>"Who is with her?" demanded Leopold, on a quick breath.</p>

<p>"Prince Christian breakfasts with her," replied the valet; and
in his dim vicious eyes, Leopold read the rest of the sentence,
"after spending the night in her apartment."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h2>

<p class="first">CHRISTIAN'S design was to leave the Southern
Netherlands fortified by their rightful masters, the Spanish, and
return himself with the Imperial troops to Frankfurt and there
crown the Emperor, whose hereditary dominions of Bavaria and the
Palatinate would be, he hoped, in a short while completely
cleared of the enemy. He relied above everything on the
exactitude and promptitude of his movements and therefore was
greatly pressed with business; for there was much to be done, and
not so many on whom he could rely for effective cooperation.</p>

<p>It was therefore well in the afternoon of the day that he had
breakfasted with the Countess Carola before Hensdorff could see
him.</p>

<p>He lodged in the ancient mansion of the Princes of Orange, in
the Grande Place, not far from the two palaces&mdash;the one
occupied by the Countess Carola and that occupied by Leopold.</p>

<p>When Hensdorff was at last admitted into his presence, he was
already making final preparations to leave Brussels.</p>

<p>The minister said at once, and in a tone of forced
indifference:</p>

<p>"The Emperor left this morning early."</p>

<p>"Left Brussels?" asked Christian, frowning. "Do you mean that
he has gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean that!" replied Hensdorff, looking away.

<p>"Where?" asked Christian.</p>

<p>"He went with the Elector of Saxony to Dresden, and
afterwards, I believe, he intends to go to Berlin. You know that
he is always averse to winter campaigning, and he believes,"
Hensdorff continued, speaking deliberately, "he believes that,
after the late successes, the troops should have some repose and
go into winter quarters."</p>

<p>Christian smiled.</p>

<p>"Does he think that <i>he</i> needs repose after his
exertions?" he asked. "Really, my dear Count, it looks to me as
if the man is a fool! I cannot understand why you, who appear to
be perfectly sensible, could have taken so much trouble to serve
him!"</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not reply to this. Looking sideways at Christian
and biting his forefinger, he repeated:</p>

<p>"Well, he has gone; and I dare say Your Highness will not
greatly miss him! He himself seemed to think that his absence
will be a matter of little moment; he has left me a laconic
note."</p>

<p>"And for me nothing?" asked Christian.</p>

<p>"For you, Sir, nothing," said Hensdorff. He drew a scrap of
paper out of his pocket, and showed it to the other. On it was
just scrawled: "My dear Count, I do not believe that I shall be
missed in Brussels. I am therefore accompanying the Elector of
Saxony to Dresden, where you may send for me when you will."</p>

<p>Christian glanced at the scrawl. He had known that the Elector
of Saxony intended to return to Dresden for the winter, and had
little regretted it, for the Elector was a man of mediocre
intelligence and considerably disaffected, not in the least
inclined to sacrifice his leisure and even his comfort to enhance
the glory of another man.</p>

<p>"I did not know," remarked Christian, "that the Elector was a
friend of Leopold. This arrangement must have been very
sudden."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hensdorff, nervously, "I imagine that Your
Highness will not greatly miss the Emperor&mdash;that you will be
able to carry out your arrangements without his presence."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Christian, with his serene smile, "His
Majesty is of little use. At the same time, it is quite
impossible for him to leave the army like this. You, my dear
Hensdorff, must go at once to Dresden and tell him to return. It
is quite impossible for any one to go into winter quarters this
campaign; and the troops will be much affected by the Emperor's
departure, and the manner of it. Why," he added, turning the
matter over in his mind, "he must have gone almost secretly; it's
like a flight!"</p>

<p>"Doubtless," replied Hensdorff, "he acted upon a sudden mood.
He does that, you know; he likes also to assert his
authority."</p>

<p>"Authority!" smiled Christian. "It seems to me that he has
none! No one regards him at all. At the same time, he is the
Emperor, and he must return. The husband of the Queen of Hungary
is in command of her troops, and the King of England's son is in
command of the Hanoverians; and it is not possible that the
Imperialists should be left to me, whom, I have no doubt," he
added, superbly, "they call a hired mercenary."</p>

<p>"If he does not return in a day or so I will go and fetch him
back," said Hensdorff, but without much confidence. "Meanwhile,
what gloss and fair bearing can I put on the matter, so that the
Emperor's reputation is upheld?"</p>

<p>Christian reflected. He was more amused than vexed by
Leopold's capricious action. After all, a short absence from the
army might easily be condoned in the Emperor, and Christian did
not doubt that any one as facile as Leopold could soon be induced
to return to his post. But he agreed with Hensdorff that it would
be as well to put the best possible face upon the matter.</p>

<p>"Do you know why he has gone?" he asked. "Is there some real
motive, some reason at the bottom of it?" And he added,
indifferently, "A woman, perhaps?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff turned aside his tired eyes, lest they should glance
too sharply at the speaker.</p>

<p>"With Leopold it is seldom a woman," he said, carelessly. "No;
I think it is nothing but fatigue and boredom. Leopold is one who
is overwhelmed by the tedium of life."</p>

<p>"He is oddly disinterested in his own fortunes," replied
Christian. "There are few men who would be quite so indifferent
at the prospect of an Imperial Diadem!"</p>

<p>"He has enough sense," remarked Hensdorff, "to see how
unfitted he is for any such position."</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Christian, "these subtleties are no matter of
mine. I have engaged to set him on this same despised throne, and
I must do so, even despite himself, it seems. You must hasten
after him, my dear Count, and induce him to return before he
reaches Dresden. He does not even know my plans&mdash;which, as I
say, are to advance at once on Frankfurt, before the enemy
realizes what we are about to do. No doubt they consider that the
campaign is now over, and that I shall remain for the winter in
Brussels. It is necessary to take them completely by surprise,
and be over the Rhine again before they are aware of our
movements; otherwise we may have to fight again, and more
fiercely than at St. Omer, before we reach our destination. Tell
the Emperor this, and that I expect him to meet me at my
concentration camp at Ems."</p>

<p>Long accustomed to full command over every one to whom he
spoke, Christian gave out these short sentences with an air of
decisive authority; at the same time he smiled agreeably at
Hensdorff, whom he had begun rather to admire; and, as Hensdorff
had often thought that he would like him for a master, so
Christian had often reflected that Hensdorff would make a very
capable servant for a man like himself. He would very much have
liked to be an emperor, with Hensdorff for his minister. "He and
I together," he had often thought, "could rule the empire very
well indeed." And he remarked now, as he rose, pulling his
sash-knot into place with his mechanical habit of neatness and
precision:</p>

<p>"It is really a pity, my dear Count, that you have not a
little better material to work with."</p>

<p>Hensdorff's reply to this remark was unexpected and
singular.</p>

<p>"I hope," he said, earnestly, "the behaviour of the Emperor
will not in any way affect the intention of Your Highness."</p>

<p>"How should it affect me?" asked Christian, in surprise. "I
knew what manner of man he was when I made the bargain with you,
Count Hensdorff."</p>

<p>"Did you?" asked Hensdorff, quietly. "Did you? That was what I
was wondering, Monseigneur!" He looked, as he spoke, so uneasy
and distressed that Christian asked, sharply:</p>

<p>"Surely you do not think that I shall go back upon my
word?"</p>

<p>"It cannot be," replied Hensdorff, evasively, "easy for a man
like you, Monseigneur, to serve a man like Leopold."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly easy," replied Christian, serenely; "I do
what I do for my price, my dear Count. The Emperor is a mere
detail in my design. Once I have redeemed my word, fulfilled my
promise, he may crash to his inevitable ruin as quickly as he
pleases. It is, of course, understood," he added, "that until
this is accomplished, he does not hinder or thwart me. Therefore
I must ask you at once to go after him and bid him come to
Ems&mdash;unless you have some one completely in your confidence
to whom you can trust this mission. It were best, I think, to go
yourself."</p>

<p>"I think it were," muttered Hensdorff, apprehensively, "and if
you can concoct some excuse to blot over my absence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will say," smiled Christian, "that you have gone to buy
over the Elector of Saxony, who sets his price up every half
hour, and is not worth the lowest sum he has ever asked." Then he
added, on a sudden recollection: "What is to become of the
Archduchess? He has left her, it seems, on my hands: what are we
to do with her, and the other ladies?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff shrugged.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," remarked Christian, calmly, "that he brings
this galaxy of women behind him. They are nothing but a hindrance
and an encumbrance; they had better remain in Brussels, which I
should think they would find as dull as Vienna!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they had better remain in Brussels," agreed
Hensdorff.</p>

<p>With a faint curiosity, Christian asked:</p>

<p>"Did you not say that the Countess Carola had some influence
over the Emperor? Well, he has left her too. I breakfasted with
her this morning, upon her most importunate invitation, and the
woman seems to me a fool; but an artful fool, who would have no
difficulty in entangling a man like Leopold."</p>

<p>"If she ever did," said Hensdorff, "he is free of her
now."</p>

<p>"She appears to regret him," remarked Christian, drily, "as
little as she regrets her husband."</p>

<p>"She is," agreed Hensdorff, absently, "a stupid <i>bas
bleu</i>."</p>

<p>He was not thinking of the Countess Carola Borgonie.</p>

<p>As he heavily and gloomily left the mansion of the Princes of
Orange, he found Gabor on the steps, waiting for him; and the
Transylvanian, with a low salute, at once fell into step behind
him, as he walked round the Grande Place.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this departure of the Emperor?"
asked Hensdorff in a low voice of his spy.</p>

<p>And Gabor answered immediately:</p>

<p>"I know nothing; but I can guess a great deal!"</p>

<p>"Has he gone to Dresden?" whispered Hensdorff, apprehensively;
and, with a sneer, Gabor replied:</p>

<p>"No! Of course he has not gone, either to Dresden or to
Berlin. I have kept a watch upon his movements," continued Gabor,
"as you directed me. He was closeted with the Elector of Saxony
for about half an hour this morning; they left the city together,
but they did not long keep company. Leopold was without his
uniform, and in a plain attire that amounted to a disguise. He
appeared alike careless of his reputation and the consequences of
his action."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff came to a pause on the cobbled pavement.</p>

<p>"But where has he gone?" he whispered, desperately. "Where the
devil has the man gone to?"</p>

<p>"You do well to mention the devil," replied Gabor, smiling
with pale lips, "for his hand is certainly in this! Leopold has
gone, I dare swear, to Bosenberg."</p>

<p>"God in heaven!" exclaimed Hensdorff.</p>

<p>Gabor laughed under his breath.</p>

<p>"Bosenberg is very near Ottenheim," he muttered, "and the
Princess Eleanora seems a magnet to some men."</p>

<p>"I must after the accursed fool at once!" exclaimed Hensdorff,
vigorously. "But he has nearly a day's start. Somehow I thought
of this myself&mdash;and yet dared not! I might have
known&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Gabor had not intended that he should know, until the
Emperor had got that same good start of many hours' riding.</p>

<p>"Leave me now," muttered Hensdorff, desperate, yet thinking of
the passers-by, for both townsmen and soldiers were passing
through the Grande Place; "and if you breathe a single syllable
of your suspicions, Gabor&mdash;" he paused, with a look of the
utmost menace, and Gabor, for once in his life, spoke the utter
truth when he replied:</p>

<p>"I can promise you that I will speak them to no one."</p>

<p>They parted at one of the corners of the Grande Place, whence
Hensdorff hastened away to his lodgings to make preparations to
follow Leopold. He was not quite sure whether he could believe
the spy or not, and before he took any action he intended to make
cautious and deliberate enquiries. These enquiries caused a
certain, and not inconsiderable, delay. Gabor was hampered by no
such troubles. After standing for a moment gazing up
indifferently at the up-soaring spire of the ornate Town Hall,
he, glancing over his shoulder to see that Hensdorff was really
out of sight, turned and went swiftly to a little inn by one of
the gates of Brussels, where he had lain not only before but
since the surrender of the town.</p>

<p>After looking carefully to his pistol, his money and his
horse, the three things of importance in his mind and important
in just that order, the Transylvanian mounted, and rode away
across the plain of Brabant, in the direction of Germany.</p>

<p>The prospect was melancholy; straight avenues of bare poplars
stretched towards the flat horizon; the sky was a uniform grey,
dappled like the breast of a goose and with a hard appearance
like iron. But the Transylvanian whistled pleasantly to himself
as if he were on an agreeable mission, and by no means affected
by the dreariness of the scene and the dullness of the prospect.
He thought of last night at the Opera, of how he had sat,
obscure, ignored, in the back of the theatre, and seen those two
men set up like two bedecked images for the adoration of the mob;
and it was very satisfactory to Gabor to reflect that he had such
power over both of them&mdash;that he could pull those two adored
idols down, drag off their shining ornaments and trample them in
the mud.</p>

<p>These were the thoughts that he turned over in his keen mind
with relish. Both those men had rejected him and insulted him;
and on both of them he would have the most complete and delicate
of revenges.</p>

<p>That foolish girl, too&mdash;she should not be spared. And
Gabor licked his lips as he rode across the blank plain. He had
fostered a gross passion for Eleanora: he was never fastidious in
his desires. That would be the best of all&mdash;to enjoy her
some day when she was sunk so low that any one might pick her up
from the mire into which she had fallen. Yes; he foresaw such a
fate for the Princess Eleanora that it might not be so very long
before she was glad of the protection even of a man like himself.
"Leopold," he thought to himself, "is not the man to be faithful;
and if he were, how long will his destiny hold?"</p>

<p>Absorbed in evil reflections, the Transylvanian rode
deliberately towards his destination. He had estimated very
exactly all the stages of his journey, and the time necessary to
accomplish it. There was no hurry on his vile expedition; he did
not wish to arrive too soon, and could scarcely&mdash;and he
smiled to himself&mdash;arrive too late...</p>

<p>At every post he made enquiries, and the answer always
confirmed his suspicions. Leopold was travelling before him on
the same road, in a plain equipage, but with no disguise of his
quality. He had but a small escort, and was travelling rapidly,
fresh horses at every stage.</p>

<p>Gabor often stopped at the same inn, and even sometimes slept
in the same bed. He was, like all spies, well supplied with
money. He had his passport and all his papers in order, and could
pass without molestation; he grinned in relish as he noted how
well Christian had kept the lines of communication open behind
him&mdash;and for what purpose?</p>

<p>And so, always on the heels of Leopold, he came through
Würtemberg and Bavaria into Austria and onto the banks of the
familiar Danube.</p>

<p>He had now proved himself correct in his surmises. Leopold had
not ridden either to Berlin or to Dresden, but directly towards
the Danube, on the banks of which stood his château of
Bosenberg.</p>

<p>As he tracked Leopold so closely, he found that in Bavaria,
his own country, and in Austria, the heart of the Empire, he was
travelling in disguise, calling himself by a strange
name&mdash;that of Count Amburg. He had dismissed his retinue and
his escort, and left his coach behind. He now at last rode
solitary, a single horseman like Gabor himself. "A fool of
fools!" smiled Gabor; and the words were like a song upon his
lips.</p>

<p>As Gabor reached the banks of the Danube, the first snow began
to fall. Despite his flying haste, many days had passed since he
had left Brussels, and he wondered maliciously how Prince
Christian was enduring the long absence of the Emperor, and what
was the fate of war...by now there might have been another
battle. Gabor was travelling away from the seat of news, and had
now outridden even rumour. The weather became colder; all colour,
lustre and burnish had left the imposing scene of river and crag
and wood, since last Gabor had looked upon it; winter, with chill
weight, had obscured all the glowing luxuries of summer. The very
waters of the wide stream seemed to move more sluggishly, and
were blackish in hue. The fields, that had been so brilliant with
harvest, were now dry and barren; the peasants all gathered into
their huts and hovels, save those few who were miserably abroad,
searching for sticks, and the remnants of grass and herbage.</p>

<p>Here the world seemed void and silent: it was difficult to
imagine that war was not so many leagues away, difficult to think
that it had not been so many days agone that he, Gabor, had sat
in the Opera House in Brussels and watched all the theatrical
pageantry of triumph and ostentation. The wide, desolate winter
landscape expressed a mournful emptiness; the very sky seemed
sombre, and without hope. For the last two days, Gabor had lost
track of Leopold, as a hound might lose track of the prey he is
keenly scenting. The Emperor must have taken a different road.
That which Gabor followed&mdash;the quickest and most
commodious&mdash;knew no trace of the other swift horseman. The
inns had heard nothing of any other traveller. But it never
occurred to Gabor that perhaps Leopold had turned aside, or
turned back. Too well he knew his man; too well the potency of
the magnet that drew him onwards to his fate.</p>

<p>Therefore, without haste or hesitation, Gabor pursued his
undeviating course. At length he left the sullen length of the
river, and rode to the Emperor's estate of Bosenberg, that
stately and luxurious pleasure-house, which Christian had had the
insolence to copy in his Chateau of Ottenheim.</p>

<p>This palace had been built by the Emperor's father, to
demonstrate the utmost degree of Imperial splendour and gorgeous
majesty; but the pompous pleasure-grounds were now neglected, as
were all such elegances during this long time of unceasing
war.</p>

<p>The place, mansion and park, had been planned on too vast a
scale. The place was overweighted by its own richness, like a too
full-blown flower. Gabor rode through broken splendours and
disregarded magnificences to the grand ostentation of the
overadorned facade.</p>

<p>It was not often that Gabor went boldly to the front door of
any house; but this time he did so, and faced with a sneer the
immense and gloomy palace. The vast pile appeared closed, but
there were some servants in livery here.</p>

<p>These answered Gabor's summons, and seemed to do so with alarm
and agitation.</p>

<p>"The Emperor is here," said Gabor, in a tone of assurance,
standing, a black figure, against the grey landscape, on the
wide, cold marble step.</p>

<p>And the lackey, not knowing who he might be, and impressed by
his keen air of authority, admitted that the Emperor had arrived
last night.</p>

<p>"Last night," repeated Gabor; "and may I see His Majesty? It
is on business the most pressing." And with a malicious, though
unnecessary, flourish, he added: "From Prince
Christian&mdash;from the headquarters of the Imperial Army."</p>

<p>The lackey could well believe as much; to him, as to his
fellow servants, left there in solitary charge of the abandoned
pleasure-palace, the sudden appearance of the Emperor had been to
the last degree strange and alarming. They had thought of vast
defeats, of immense battles lost, to see the Emperor here in the
middle of the campaign...it was as dreadful as it was incredible.
Now, staring at this pale, thin man, looking at him with such
keen contempt, the valet felt that some disaster had fallen his
master, and he stammered out: "His Majesty is not here."</p>

<p>"No?" queried Gabor, softly, under his breath. "No?" And the
valet replied, stupidly: "His Majesty has just gone to
Ottenheim."</p>

<p>Gabor played with the moment, as one might play with a jewel,
slipping in and out of one's palm. He felt no chill in the
air&mdash;no melancholy in the sky&mdash;no gloom in the huge
closed palace.</p>

<p>"And who," he asked, delicately, "is at Ottenheim? That is
Prince Christian's Château, and he is at the war."</p>

<p>The valet did not answer; he gazed stupidly at Gabor.</p>

<p>"Will you, Monseigneur, come in and await His Majesty's
return?" he asked, being but a raw servant, and uninstructed in
important duties.</p>

<p>"I will come in," replied Gabor, pleasantly, "and wait, and
rest awhile; and then, I think that I, too, will ride to
Ottenheim." And, as he entered the grey shadows of the long,
marble corridor, he asked again: "Who is now at Ottenheim?"</p>

<p>"There are the two Princesses and their ladies," said the
startled valet. "I know no more than that, Monseigneur!"</p>

<p>"And I think," said Gabor, taking off his cloak, "there is no
more that any one need know, eh?"</p>

<p>He refreshed himself with Leopold's wine, Leopold's coffee,
lounging upon Leopold's yellow brocade sophy. It gave him
pleasure to do this. It was like an artist's final touch to his
masterpiece: unnecessary, but delightful. He warmed himself by
Leopold's fire, hastily lit in one of the large apartments, and
he stared critically and insolently at the rows of Imperial
portraits, that gazed with hauteur from the gloomy, high walls
covered with watered silk and adorned by gilt panels. It amused
him to gaze at all those long, pale faces of the Houses of
Bavaria and Austria, of Hapsburg and of Spain, of Bourbon,
Stewart and Valois&mdash;all of whom seemed to be gazing down at
him with contempt, but also with alarm, as if they knew what he
intended for their unfortunate descendant.</p>

<p>How sumptuous they were with their curled peruques and their
gleaming orders and their great collars of jewels, their ermine
robes and their falls of rich lace, and their grand, useless
swords and their pompous, useless thrones, in their heavy armour
and their polished helmets, so rigidly adorned with panaches of
bright feathers! Gabor smiled from one to another, and to some he
even gave a mocking bow, as he sipped his coffee before the
brightening fire.</p>

<p>Plenty of time&mdash;ah! yes, plenty of time to drink his
coffee and warm his hands and gaze mockingly at these Imperial
portraits! Plenty of time to divert himself in Leopold's house;
Leopold would not return yet.</p>

<p>The immense palace was empty; save for these poor fools of
bewildered valets, there was no one to question Gabor or to spy
on him. They all took him for some great man who had come with
great news&mdash;probably of disaster. And they waited on him
deferentially, and with a certain fear mingled with their
respect.</p>

<p>The snow fell more thickly: Gabor could see the great flakes
coming softly, softly against the huge, tall, blank windows from
which the stiff gold curtains had been hastily looped back. He
could see the landscape becoming more and more grey, blotted into
the silverness of the descending snowstorm.</p>

<p>He calculated coolly how far it was from Bosenberg to
Ottenheim&mdash;how long it would take him to ride there. The
obsequious servants were looking after his horse, which he had
taken the precaution to change not so long ago. His mount would
be as fresh as he was himself, and he was in every nerve
alert.</p>

<p>The brief winter day was ending, and the darkness, hastened by
the gathering snowstorm, came on suddenly; but still Gabor did
not hasten. He knew his way and his plans very well. Not by a
single moment would he miscalculate them.</p>

<p>He drank his opulent wine with relish: an Imperial vintage
laid down with care by the late Emperor, who could never have
guessed, in his most fantastic moments (and he had been a man of
fantasy), how it would be thus used and enjoyed by the man who
had proposed the destruction of his son.</p>

<p>At last, stretching himself sleekly, and making a last
sneering obeisance at all those stiff, staring portraits on the
high walls, Gabor left the Château of Bosenberg, and, warmly
wrapped in his fur pelisse, took his leisurely way across the
grey, desolate park; a deep silence stifled the landscape. There
was no living creature in sight&mdash;not so much as one solitary
bird left from autumn's revelry. Slowly, yet deliberately, Gabor
rode towards Ottenheim.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY</h2>

<p class="first">ELEANORA beguiled the brief tedium of the drab
winter day by trying on some of the finery which had at length
arrived, despite the war, from elegant shops in the Palais Royal.
One of the frocks pleased her very much: it was of <i>bleu de
roi</i> velvet, with small, steel buttons, and gave her a more
elegant appearance than she had ever had before. In this, she
thought, she looked something like the great lady that every one
had to pretend she was; but which she herself had thought that
she could never be. She found great amusement in undoing these
parcels, in taking out all these gorgeous trifles, all these
sumptuous gowns, and turning them over and over again, till at
length the Duchess peevishly chid her for frivolity.</p>

<p>"But what," asked Eleanora, "am I to do?"</p>

<p>And the Duchess had no answer ready. Boredom had indeed
descended heavily upon Ottenheim. The Baroness Charlotte had
returned, despite the war, to Anhalt-Dessau, summoned there by
the illness of her father; and two of the other ladies had found
excuses to hasten to Vienna. The Duchess and Eleanora were alone,
with a few maids and the fantastic garrison, whose perpetual
evolution and trumpet calls began to fray the Duchess's nerves.
She would have given a good deal to return, if not to Vienna or
Anhalt-Dessau, at least to Dürsheim; but Colonel Pons
entreated&mdash;nay, almost commanded&mdash;her to remain where
she was. Dürsheim, he declared, was not safe enough; nor was it
possible to guard and protect it as Ottenheim was guarded and
protected.</p>

<p>Eleanora also felt a sense of oppressive dullness. The
gorgeous rooms of the Château began to be very full of shadows,
and to look strangely; the house became to Eleanora even more
alien than it had been at first. She was apt to start if she
heard sudden footsteps behind her, or glimpsed an open door on to
a room which was not very familiar. Once she had returned to that
obscure corridor, to look at the gallant picture of <i>The
Magdalene Returning to the Pleasures of the World</i>: but it had
gone. She guessed that either the Duchess or Colonel Pons had had
it removed, and, with a kind of shamefaced timidity, she pondered
whether there was not a great deal in the world about which she
was not allowed to know, but that every one was in a sort of
kindly conspiracy to hide from her. She had had, lately, glimpses
of some such world from books she had found in Christian's
library&mdash;the plays of Florian and Crébillon, with their
slim, elegant engravings of harlequins and columbines, under the
colonnades of French palaces. And now they had taken this picture
away, when she had wished to look at it again and wonder about
it. The fact of its removal gave it a great importance in the
mind of Eleanora, and she began to con over all those odd
details, of people, and beasts, and birds, and reptiles under
those trees emblazoned with the most curious flowers and bedecked
with the most grotesque leaves, beneath a sky brazen with
lion-like sunshine.</p>

<p>She visited, also, the deserted theatre, and shivered,
standing in the dusty, red stalls, where Banning and Hensdorff
had lounged on the occasion of the minister's first visit to
Ottenheim: She looked curiously at the curtained stage and at the
Pulchinello bauble, which still lay where the young Swede had
flung it down. She wondered if she would ever attend a play:
perhaps when the Emperor was crowned there would be celebrations,
and she would be there, as the Duchess had told her, with an
ermine train and a little crown on her head; she had been assured
that this was possible, though it seemed to her both remote and
fantastic.</p>

<p>She had to write, as her guardian had reminded her, to
Christian, to thank him for the arrival of the parcels from the
French shops; but she put off this task, although she was so
idle.</p>

<p>She was weary of writing all the simple events of the empty
day in her little diary with the blue leather cover. She was
weary of her fine embroidery, and her delicate pencil-drawings of
views on the Danube. She was at length even weary of trying on
and taking off finery and posing before the mirror in her new
gowns. And she was most weary of all of sitting in the Duchess's
room and listening to the old woman's complaints and
exhortations.</p>

<p>Neither did she want to hear Colonel Pons descant upon the
triumphs of Prince Christian, for she understood nothing at all
about those matters, and modern warfare seemed to her a very sad
and tiresome matter indeed, although she so delighted in battles
of fabulous knights in the long ago.</p>

<p>Eleanora was not any longer being carefully watched, for there
was really nothing that she could do, nor had she, of course, any
desire to leave the Château. It was, therefore, quite possible
for her on late winter afternoons to leave the dozing Duchess and
Colonel Pons, busy with his garrison, and go out quite alone into
the park. The fountains were not playing now, and the last birds
and the last leaves had perished from the bare trees. The snow
was falling, but Eleanora, like the Northern maiden she was,
rather relished the snow, and she was snugly attired, with a
large muff of grey fur, and a thick wrap of the same round her
throat. She walked rapidly, enjoying the stillness and watching
the snow gradually covering the dry ground, the withered grass
and the long, desolate <i>allées</i>, being all gradually bloomed
with white. Nor did she greatly heed the advancing dusk. She
would rather be alone in the park than alone in the Château.</p>

<p>As she crossed the long, straight avenue leading to the great
gates, she saw a man coming towards her as if he had just entered
the domains of Ottenheim; and she paused, wondering who it could
be. For it was not one of the garrison, but a man in civilian
clothes, and there was no one, save the servants, who wore
civilian clothes; and even they were bedecked in liveries. And
this man was in black, with a traveller's cloak, and a hat
without a cockade.</p>

<p>Eleanora thought of the messengers who came so continually
from Christian, with despatches and letters; but even they were
always in some manner of uniform. So she peered, curiously and
not frightened, through the faint gloaming and the faint dusk;
and when the stranger came a little nearer she realized that it
was Captain Leopold&mdash;as she always called him in her
thoughts.</p>

<p>She was conscious of the purest and most delicious joy; with
untroubled candour, she flew up to her friend and put out her
hand. She did not even remember who he really was.</p>

<p>"So you have come back at last!" she said.</p>

<p>Leopold took her hand in his, which were ungloved and
chilled.</p>

<p>"Have you been waiting for me?" he whispered. And then they
neither of them said any more, but stood looking at each other in
the gathering snow and the gathering twilight. Leopold was
dressed as she remembered him in the beechwoods at Dürsheim. His
hair was unpowdered, and he had no official ornaments. There was
nothing about him to remind her of the position he really held,
or the name he really bore. Neither, to him, could she possibly
seem the wife of Prince Christian, nor anything other than that
girl whom he had left standing on her little balcony in the early
morning light, on that day which now seemed so impossibly and
incredibly long ago.</p>

<p>"Let us come into the house," she said. She asked no
questions, she felt no wonder. His coming was a sheer piece of
magic, an enchanted event.</p>

<p>But Leopold hesitated, and peered through the greyness at the
imposing front of Ottenheim, and the double-winged stairs with
the majestic statues like giant sentinels.</p>

<p>He had left his horse at the stables at the great gates. He
did not know, when he had done so, whether he intended to stay at
the Château or not; but now that he had met Eleanora, he knew
that he did mean to stay. He was one who left much to chance. Had
it so fallen that he had not seen the Princess, he might even, in
debate with his own hot and troubled heart, have turned and have
gone back to his own palace, leaving her to her fate.</p>

<p>"You have been ill?" he asked, looking at her anxiously. But
she shook her head, smiling:</p>

<p>"No; I have not been ill&mdash;why should you ask?"</p>

<p>He thought that she said this not to trouble him, and he spoke
of her letter.</p>

<p>"You wrote to me, didn't you? I had your letter, and you must
have wondered why I didn't answer it."</p>

<p>But again Eleanora shook her head.</p>

<p>"I never wrote to you," she said, wonderingly. "Why should I
write?"</p>

<p>And once more, Leopold thought she said it out of modesty and
timidity, or shame; and he blamed himself for having spoken of
her letter. Not for one second did it occur to him that the same
epistle was a forgery.</p>

<p>Eleanora did not ask him why he had come to Ottenheim in this
unexpected and peculiar manner. She knew. She had forgotten
Christian as completely as her companion remembered him.</p>

<p>"Will you stay with us?" she asked, ingenuously. "The Duchess
will be surely pleased to see you." And then she smiled, and
added: "And I think you are the Emperor: though that seems,
somehow, grotesque."</p>

<p>"It is," said Leopold, "as you say, grotesque." He did not
want to meet the Duchess of Schönbuchel. He would willingly have
lingered in the dark. But the snow was falling fast, and the
light was failing rapidly. He asked her who there was in the
Château, and she said:</p>

<p>"Only Colonel Pons, the garrison and the servants. We have
been lonely here, Monseigneur, I can assure you. But the Duchess
says that we must wait patiently, as all the women wait, until
the end of the campaign."</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer. He was looking at her intently. He
drew her hand through his arm, and led her towards the Château.
She seemed to him to be of the most unsurpassable and ideal
beauty, even more a blossoming perfection than all his cherished
memories of her, exquisite as those had been; and she acquiesced
in his admiration, which seemed to her so lofty, so brave and
beautiful. She had a warm and glowing sense of deep joy,
triumphant achievement, in just this one fact that he had come
back.</p>

<p>As they reached the steps, he said, breathing quickly:</p>

<p>"Do you ever hear from&mdash;do you ever write to&mdash;Prince
Christian?"</p>

<p>Eleanora said:</p>

<p>"My husband?"</p>

<p>And Leopold replied, abruptly:</p>

<p>"He is not your husband. That Lutheran ceremony was
nothing."</p>

<p>Eleanora looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," she said; "does it matter? I don't know:
the Duchess says I am his wife, and I, too, am a Lutheran, you
know."</p>

<p>"But you need not be so always," replied Leopold. "You can
change as he changed," he added, bitterly. "But do you write to
him?"</p>

<p>And Eleanora, still startled and confused, said she had
written two notes, and must write a third, for some clothes that
he had sent her from Paris.</p>

<p>"Don't write again," replied Leopold. "Don't think of him any
more. Don't concern yourself with him."</p>

<p>"But he is your general," said Eleanora, pausing on the steps,
"and fights for you." She brushed the lingering snowflakes from
her grey muff with a nervous hand. "They say he has obtained
great victories for you."</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer that.</p>

<p>"Let us come into the house," he muttered. "You are getting
cold here."</p>

<p>Eleanora felt a close contact with him as they mounted the
last of the shallow steps, where the tall, grey statues with
their fluttering draperies, those Caesars, goddesses and
warriors, stood now forlornly and uselessly on guard, letting the
enemy pass unmolested between their bare, haughty ranks.</p>

<p>Eleanora felt she understood his passion, his intention; and
her senses warmed to a yielding concession. And yet she knew
nothing, either of him or of what he meant to do; she put her
hand in his and drew him across the threshold, and as he entered
those lofty and haughty doors he shuddered, and tried to forget
who was the master of this opulent house.</p>

<p>The palace was already delicately warm and radiantly lit.
After his long journey and his stay amid his own desolate
splendours, which had seemed so unfriendly, Leopold, who was most
sensuous, and whose senses were acute, delighted in this
luxurious comfort and breathed with more freedom than he had
breathed since he had left Brussels. It was a long tension come
to a sweet conclusion.</p>

<p>He gave his modest hat and mantle to a waiting valet, who did
not know him, or affected ignorance. In either case, Leopold took
no concern with him, but followed the Princess Eleanora down the
corridors to the room in which she usually sat in the afternoons,
and there took his seat beside her, in front of the fire, as if
he had returned after long absence to his own home.</p>

<p>She put aside her furs and her winter mufflings, and sat
silently looking at him. And he, returning that innocent gaze,
felt his transient happiness too great for this world and likely
to endanger his remembering of the next world: "If such a place
there is!" he thought, ironically. Not for anything would he
pause now, but take and value these moments to the full.</p>

<p>He had exposed himself to the full force of his own desires,
and they possessed a strength that he could not pretend to
resist.</p>

<p>"Why did you go away?" asked Eleanora, earnestly. "And why,
Monseigneur, have you come back? And what is this you tell me
about my marriage? Forgive me if I am foolish and very much
confused!"</p>

<p>Leopold answered, slowly:</p>

<p>"Do not think of any of these things, but leave your destiny
in my hands, where I think it has always been."</p>

<p>The Duchess, having heard from the valet of Leopold's arrival,
came hastily into the big drawing-room, alarmed, and immediately
on guard. When she saw the identity of the visitor, she could
scarcely, worldly and clever as she was, control her dismayed
astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to see me here?" smiled Leopold, as he
rose.</p>

<p>"I am surprised," said the old woman, rallying, "to see you,
Sire, anywhere where you must of necessity lose your time."</p>

<p>And she looked at him with deep and defiant meaning. To this
Leopold replied with equal meaning:</p>

<p>"Do you think I am that manner of man, Madame, who has no more
courage but he must die upon the first denial? I pray you," he
added, with some impatience, "do not bait me, for my humour has
more of trouble than satisfaction in it, and will not easily be
vexed."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied the old Duchess, standing her ground
gallantly, although she was deeply afraid, "I do not understand
your mood, but I find your visit here unsupportable. How is it
possible that you have been able to leave your headquarters,
which I believe to be now at Ems, in preparation for your
coronation?"</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Leopold, quietly, "my affairs I have taken
in my own hands, and I must request that you do not interfere
with me."</p>

<p>The Duchess dropped a stiff curtsy, and replied, bitterly:</p>

<p>"This is not my house that I can bid you leave it; but it is
Prince Christian's house; and that is a stronger reason, Sire,
that you should take your instant departure!"</p>

<p>Eleanora did not understand the meaning of these quick words
that passed between the two; but she knew that Leopold had
returned, and that he must not go.</p>

<p>"There is no harm in his staying," she said, candidly.
"Madame, pray do not bid him go: it is a snowy and a weary night,
and he has come a long way to pay his duty to us!"</p>

<p>"Madame," Leopold asked, "why do you apprehend any displeasure
from my visit? I have leave to come to Ottenheim, I believe?"</p>

<p>"The master of Ottenheim would scarcely give you that leave,
Sire," replied the old woman, grimly. "I dare swear he knows not
you are here; and if you insist upon staying," she added, with
spirit, "I can assure Your Majesty that you play the tyrant to
very little purpose. It is but a poor conquest to frighten two
poor, weak, silly women."</p>

<p>Leopold glanced at Eleanora, and said, softly:</p>

<p>"Do I affright you, sweet? Do I affright you?" And she shook
her head and smiled at him, as if the Duchess were not there. The
old woman was shivering. She leant heavily on her ebony stick
with the silver apple on the top, which of late she had so
frequently used.</p>

<p>"I cannot debate this calmly," she muttered. "Eleanora, child,
leave us! Go to your room, and take up your furs and cloak, and
set yourself ready for supper. No doubt Monseigneur will honour
us with his company at that meal."</p>

<p>"I shall," replied Leopold, calmly, "a little while remain;
and do you go as she bids you, Eleanora, and adorn yourself with
your prettiest gown, so that we may, a little while, defy our
fortune; this one pleasure we may snatch. I think," he added, in
deep tenderness, "you have been but of a melancholy, cloudy
humour here, shut away so long. Let us dispel that, if only for
an hour!"</p>

<p>With a breathless, amazed timidity, and yet with high-mounting
spirits, Eleanora curtseyed first to one and then to the other,
and then left the room, Leopold escorting her to the tall, florid
door.</p>

<p>When he returned, the Duchess was still standing erect,
leaning upon her stick and glaring at him.</p>

<p>"I am bold enough, Sire," she said, immediately, "to see this
visit to my charge as a fault, and to entreat you to leave us at
once."</p>

<p>"You seem to hold me in slight esteem, Madame," smiled
Leopold. "When I have spoken a little with the Princess Eleanora
I will return to Bosenberg, as has ever been my intention."</p>

<p>"Lest we find a quarrel in it, Sire," said the old woman,
firmly, "you will return before you see the Princess, whom I have
just sent to her chamber to avoid such an interview."</p>

<p>"What do you know of me and her?" asked Leopold.

<p>"Enough," replied the Duchess, at once, "not to leave you
alone together."</p>

<p>Leopold smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>"You make little scruple of the matter, Madame," he replied,
haughtily, "and I find also that you are hot in Prince
Christian's favour."</p>

<p>"It is his house," said the Duchess, shortly, "and his
wife."</p>

<p>"His house, yes," answered Christian, "and I shall not long
trouble him. But scarcely his wife, Madame; that Lutheran
ceremony was nothing."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Sire," said the Duchess, again with her stiff
curtsey, "for your good usage. I also am a Lutheran, and you
know, Sire, as I know, that that marriage was notably a marriage,
before all the world; and, I believe, the price you paid for the
services of Prince Christian, which have, Sire, proved
invaluable."</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer, or feel in any way affected by what
she said: and the Duchess was alarmed near to swooning by his
silence.</p>

<p>"Colonel Pons is here," she said, hastily; "perhaps Your
Majesty will speak with Colonel Pons."</p>

<p>"Let Colonel Pons join his master," answered Leopold, shortly.
"Ay, and all the garrison also. Who is Prince Christian to keep
his own estate here in Ottenheim? Tomorrow there shall be troops
from Vienna. I have sent for them. They will relieve the guard of
Ottenheim."</p>

<p>"You give me unquiet thoughts," said the Duchess, with
quivering lips, "and I am dismayed and undone."</p>

<p>"And surprised, too, I think?" smiled Leopold. "Did you credit
me with perfect resignation to my allotted fate? You had a hand
in that too, I think, Madame; were one of those intriguers at
Dürsheim who took Eleanora away from me."</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried the Duchess frantically. "All this is
extravagance, no woman breathing is worth the trouble you give
yourself, Sire! It has never been my humour to do any one
injury&mdash;let alone yourself, whom I have always regarded as
my Emperor. She was innocent enough to encourage you, and you
were innocent enough to be encouraged. Let that all go, Sire, as
children's play; and I beseech you, let us have an end of these
crosses and afflictions. Return, I entreat you, to
Bosenberg!"</p>

<p>"Do not rail," said Leopold; "no doubt you are sad and ill
satisfied. But as you say, we can let these past matters be. I
will take supper with you and begone. Will you have patience with
me before Eleanora? May I not bribe you, in her presence, to wink
at my manifest faults?"</p>

<p>"If you will go soon, I will be your bounden servant," said
the Duchess, eagerly. "I will speak fair to your face and behind
your back, Sire, if you will only begone&mdash;if you will not
speak with her alone!"</p>

<p>"You guard her well!" smiled Leopold, sadly. "Prince Christian
owes you a rich reward, Madame."</p>

<p>The Duchess came two trembling steps nearer to him across the
firelit room.</p>

<p>"Sire, if you loved her passionately&mdash;nay, even if you
loved her well, you could not see her ruined."</p>

<p>"Who said I loved her?" asked Leopold, faintly. "You take,
Madame, strange matters on your tongue."</p>

<p>"I am old," stammered the Duchess, "and you must allow me a
certain freedom. I spoke thus openly to Prince Christian, because
I have a great affection for the girl; and he respected what he
loved."</p>

<p>"Leave it!" said Leopold, interrupting swiftly; "leave it. I
know she is as I last left her. Do me the courtesy to speak no
more about it."</p>

<p>"And do you, Sire, forbear as he forbore?" cried the Duchess.
"With whatever intention and purpose you came here, I do entreat
you to forbear it."</p>

<p>"You think me fond and facile," smiled Leopold. "Contain your
alarm, Madame: there is nothing so odd and singular in my visit
here. The world is full of sudden accidents, as you should know
by now. I entreat you to speak with more formality," he added,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"I can scarce speak at all!" sighed the Duchess, trembling.
She sat down on the settee where Eleanora had briefly rested.</p>

<p>"What news of Prince Christian?" she asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He would scarcely send his news by me," said Leopold,
smiling; "he is well enough, and crowned, Madame, as I think you
know, by considerable victories; flushed with conquest and
adorned with praise. Therefore, no more of him. He has his meed
and his reward. In sober earnest, let us leave these matters! I
come here for a little peace."</p>

<p>Eleanora entered the room lightly, servants with candles
coming in behind her, so that she brought the sweetness and
radiance of light with her. She wore the blue velvet gown with
the little steel buttons. She had not been able to resist this
tempting adornment. And, as she advanced to Leopold and he
advanced to her, neither of them gave any heed to the defeated
and frightened old woman on the settee.</p>

<p>"I have been mewed up here so long," smiled Eleanora, dimpling
with mirth, "that I know little of the world's doings; and
therefore you, Monseigneur, must entertain me with tales of what
goes on abroad."</p>

<p>"But you," said Leopold, "will find no merit in battles and
sieges, in the intrigues of politicians: and that is all I have
to tell. It is to get away from those, Eleanora, that I have come
to Ottenheim."</p>

<p>The lackeys set the candles about the room, in the sconces,
upon the tables and before the elaborate mirrors. The Duchess
felt cold, cold...and crouched over the fire.</p>

<p>"What shall we talk of, then?" asked Eleanora, her gaze still
smilingly upon his face, "for here there is no news, save all the
birds and many of the beasts have died; and everything is
desolate and dull. The speedwell, Sire, lasted long, but even
they have gone now; and neither the sky nor the river is blue any
longer."</p>

<p>"And that is all your news?" breathed Leopold. "And mine does
not come to as much as that! For I had not even noticed, as I
rode, that all the lustre was gone from the landscape; and for
your birds and beasts, Eleanora, I may easily get you others when
the spring comes."</p>

<p>"He speaks," thought the Duchess, "as if he were going to make
her his wife. I pray God it be no worse than that!"</p>

<p>She was in the greatest state of disorder at her own futility.
When she heard the drums and trumpets sounding as usual from the
garrison, calling the soldiers into the barracks for the night,
she shivered with an even deeper fear. How useless this defiance
of the enemy when the enemy was already within the gates! And
ensconced, a welcome visitor, within the very threshold of the
fortress; handling already the most guarded of cherished
treasures...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">LEOPOLD had gone from Ottenheim, pale and
smiling with formal words of farewell upon his lips. They had lit
him out into the darkness of the snowy night, holding flambeaux
so that he should see his way down the avenue to the noble
gatehouse where he had left his horse.</p>

<p>He had declined all escort, and they had acquiesced in his
mood; Pons and the Duchess, at least, deeply grateful to him that
he thus took a decorous departure. Nor did the Princess Eleanora
seem to grieve at his early going. She was smiling to herself as
he had smiled to himself; both seemed wrapped in the fantasy of
some inner secret.</p>

<p>She sang a little, sitting at the spinet, and did not speak of
this singular visit from the Emperor; nor did the others dare
broach such a subject in her presence.</p>

<p>At her usual hour, the Princess Eleanora went to her
bedchamber. The Duchess kissed her forehead when she said good
night to her, and breathed over her a prayer and a blessing.</p>

<p>Supper had been brief and mostly silent; every one had spoken
very little. The Duchess kissed Eleanora again, and bade her
sleep well, and the girl said:</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! Sleep well!" as if she was not listening.</p>

<p>In her own large bedchamber she dismissed her maid as was her
custom; simply she had been trained, and greatly she disliked
ceremony about her intimacies. Her simple toilet was the work of
her own hands. Alone then, in her great bedchamber that had been
the bedchamber of Christian, she sat before her dressing table
which stood between the two tall, curtained windows; and, from
the pocket of the blue velvet dress, she took a peach, and
squeezed the peach; and a gap in the downy fruit flew open, and
there was a little note inside. Leopold had handed her the peach
at the supper table. How he had contrived to slip the note
inside, she did not know. She read it gravely, with frowning
brows and parted lips. It said:</p>

<p>"Set a light in your window when all the other lights are out,
and I will come and say to you what they would not let me say
to-night."</p>

<p>Eleanora sat thoughtfully, her elbow on her knee, her chin in
her palm; her other hand fingered the note. And then she put it
on the large tulipwood dressing table, among her
trinkets&mdash;old-fashioned jewels that the Duchess had given
her; her father's marriage gift; and those two green diamonds
which had been Christian's parting present; that called Mitau and
its fellow. Among all these glittering pretty trifles she laid
the note; and then she looked up at herself in the dark depths of
the mirror, between the two clusters of candles. Silver flowers
bloomed round the exact circle of this mirror, and they seemed
like blossoms rising in the moonlight from the depths of a
midnight sea. And, in the middle of that sea, her face, with the
pale hair falling back on her bare shoulders and her questioning
eyes and wondering lips; like a nymph brought from the farthest
recesses of a secret ocean, to question the strange doings of the
mortal world.</p>

<p>Gravely she thought of him and of his letter. Then, slowly and
one by one, she unbuttoned the steel buttons of her lawn chemise,
letting the blue bodice relax and open on her bosom. Then she
moved, and lightly drew aside the thick folds of the curtain, and
looked out on to the blackness of the night. The snow had ceased,
for the wind had risen, and was lifting the icy clouds and
hurrying them away. There was even a rift in these dark vapours
through which she could see a star, immeasurably far away, and
darting icy, bluish rays into the blackness of the uttermost
sky.</p>

<p>Nothing else could she see, neither the path nor the prospect,
nor the river, nor Leopold. Nothing else, only that one star; and
she drew the curtain again and shivered back into the warmth of
her room.</p>

<p>Why had they always been thwarted? She believed now that they
had been intended for each other, and that these other people had
come between. Slowly she unbuttoned the steel buttons on her
bosom...Come between and altered everything; and so they had to
suffer. Yes; he had suffered, she was sure. He had not wanted to
ride away, and he had come back through difficulty&mdash;even
through disaster, she thought; but she did not know&mdash;there
was really nothing that she did know. How completely ignorant
they had kept her about everything!</p>

<p>But <i>he</i> knew. He had said that she was not married to
that silent, stately soldier, that man who had come to her bed at
midnight and given her those green diamonds, who was so dark and
grand. He had said that that ceremony was nothing.</p>

<p>She would have liked to ask him to explain that. She had a
fluttering, beating hope that it might be true; and they had not
allowed him a chance to speak to her. They had had to sit there,
with those two old people watching and listening&mdash;jealous,
disillusioned people, with their sneers and their cold looks!
What had he come to Ottenheim for? What did he wish to say to
her? Perhaps he would go away on the morrow, and she would never
see him again, and then the end of the campaign would
come&mdash;that conclusion about which they all talked. And with
the end of the campaign there would be the spring, and that man
Christian would come back, to claim her as his wife...his wife?
She hardly knew what that meant...Leopold might tell her.</p>

<p>She buttoned up her bodice and pulled apart the curtains, and
in the aperture between them she set one of the clusters of
candles on her dressing table, then extinguished the other; so
that there was but this one light in the room, and that glowing
from the window-place.</p>

<p>She leant beside this light, and tried to see the other
windows of the palace. She thought they were all in darkness.
Every one went to bed early these winter nights. There was only
the sentry pacing round, and Leopold would know of that and avoid
him. It was not difficult to mount to her room, which was low and
had a wide balcony. He could mount on some of those figures, with
their floating draperies, that looked out so stonily before them
across the park. Eleanora flung back the window, and shuddered at
the icy shaft of night air and the few fainting snow flakes that
flew in across her shoulders.</p>

<p>She waited; she walked up and down; she took one of
Christian's presents&mdash;a long scarf of white lace&mdash;and
put it round her shoulders and took it off again, and then again
put it round, shuddering; and then returned to the window and
peered blindly into that cold, inscrutable darkness.</p>

<p>And then he came: then he was outside, all dressed in darkness
like the night; and then he had slipped in between the open
windows, and closed them, and moved the light, and drawn the
curtains, and was beside her at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling! Oh, my love!" She felt the snowflakes on his
cheeks, and his cold fingers pressing through the thin lace on
her shoulders; how he was trembling&mdash;it seemed as if he
could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>"Ah! Was it for this you came?" she whispered, hardly knowing
what she said, nor caring.</p>

<p>And he replied:</p>

<p>"For this, for this and nothing else!"</p>

<p>She lay in his arms, still and content; and then she sighed
and drew away, and took his mantle off, and laid it by the
fire.</p>

<p>"You are wet," she said; "you are wet, my dear. You have come
through the snow; you have been waiting in the cold."</p>

<p>"Waiting so long!" sighed Leopold. In his nervous haste he had
not closed the window sufficiently. The latch flew, and the
bitter gust that entered blew out that cluster of candles that
had guided him. There was no illumination left to them but the
dying light of the fire on the marble hearth.</p>

<p>"Oh! Let us light some more!" whispered Eleanora. But Leopold
shook his head.</p>

<p>"That is very well," he said; "if we leave a light some one
may see it, and no one must know that I am here."</p>

<p>"No one must know," she repeated.</p>

<p>Leopold rose from the settee where he had sunk beside the
dressing table, and bolted the door.</p>

<p>"I can make her an Empress," he murmured to himself. "Yes, it
is all well, for I can make her an Empress."</p>

<p>She was gravely spreading his wet cloak before the glow of the
fire. There he joined her, raised her and made her sit on the low
couch beside him.</p>

<p>"Your hands are cold also," he said, fondly.</p>

<p>"I too have been waiting," she answered, simply. "I could
never understand why you went away. Surely you knew, my dear,
that I wanted you to stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew," he said, and he drooped his head upon her kind
bosom. "Oh, do you love me?" he whispered. "Love me, love me,
love me?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," she answered, ingenuously, surprised at the
flutter in her own breast, in her throat, "I suppose this is
love&mdash;what I have so often read about."</p>

<p>She put her arms about him, and rested her cheek on his bent
blond head. She felt a dim, vague horror at the thought of the
other man, and she shuddered even in that moment. Though she did
not dare speak of it, she could not rid herself of the thought of
Christian.</p>

<p>Yet who need ever know that she had received Leopold in her
chamber? Surely they were safe! Neither the Duchess nor Colonel
Pons would think of this.</p>

<p>Leopold, holding her fast and staring into the magic of the
sinking fire, was lost in thinking of this great and delicious
happiness, a very weariness and overflow of content. He could spy
no flaws in the perfection of his bliss; nor spared any regret
for yesterday nor any fears for to-morrow. To him this perfect
moment was sufficient. Yet they had not sat there above five
minutes or so when they were disturbed. There was a tap upon the
door that Leopold had bolted, and then another, more insistent;
and then the Duchess's voice, asking anxiously:</p>

<p>"Eleanora, are you well?"</p>

<p>Though she had seen Leopold ride so deliberately away, she was
not a woman easily to disarm her suspicions.</p>

<p>"Answer her," whispered Leopold, very low and never stirring.
"Answer her, dearest, and say you are well."</p>

<p>And Eleanora, with a guile that she had never suspected in
herself, answered in a trembling voice that passed for
drowsiness:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am very well; why do you disturb me when I am nearly
asleep?"</p>

<p>The old, dry tones of the Duchess coming through the locked
door sounded relieved.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," she replied, simply; "I thought you might
be wakeful and would like to talk with me over a cup of
chocolate."</p>

<p>But Eleanora answered:</p>

<p>"No; I am nearly asleep. Good night, Madame; good night!"</p>

<p>And they heard the footsteps of the Duchess going heavily away
down the antechamber.</p>

<p>They both listened to the last sound of these painful
footsteps die away, and then they looked at each other, and like
two children laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, if this is happiness," cried Leopold, in an access of
joy, "then I have never been happy before!"</p>

<p>He hung about her neck and kissed her again and again, till
she grew faint and rosy under his eager lips, and faintly
besought him to go&mdash;to go now!</p>

<p>But Leopold asked, gaily:</p>

<p>"Will you not be at the trouble of entertaining me longer?"
Then, to comfort and distract her, he admired her velvet gown,
and the elegant glitter of the steel buttons on her bosom. "Where
did you get it?" he asked; and she murmured that it was a Paris
elegancy, sent by Christian from the Palais Royal; and that man's
name sounded odd and horrible upon her lips, and she blushed the
deeper as she spoke the words.</p>

<p>"Now I detest it," said Leopold, imperiously, "and I will not
have you wear it!"</p>

<p>And his fingers began to unbutton the bodice as she had
unbuttoned it half an hour ago, exposing the veils of lawn on her
gentle bosom.</p>

<p>She prevented his labours by clinging to him in a desperate
closeness. Her heart was beating so quickly that she thought she
was going to faint.</p>

<p>"I am all amazed," she murmured; "it seems as if some miracle
had happened. All the world is changed. How is it possible that
you are here?"</p>

<p>"How is it possible," he replied between his kisses, "that I
was ever away?"</p>

<p>They sat there close and closer, while the fire slowly dropped
out; and she did not notice that her open bodice had fallen and
his blond hair was across her bare breast.</p>

<p>She made some disjointed complaints, telling him to go, oh, to
go, and again to go! But he took no heed, save to kiss those
protesting lips the more.</p>

<p>The wind rose, and they could hear it swelling in the chimney
and fluttering that last glow of the dying coal. They heard it
also moan at the window with a stately sigh; and presently they
heard the distant footsteps of the sentries, and their
salutations as they passed each other in the night. And then the
sentries went into the distance, and the wind fell again; and for
a long space was still. And Leopold said:</p>

<p>"I'll go, my love; I'll go!" and did not stir.</p>

<p>And she said:</p>

<p>"Yes, leave me now!" and neither did she move from his
embrace.</p>

<p>The shadows were tumultuous and menacing in the high
room&mdash;large, vague, mighty shadows, cast by that pale
handful of fire, those dying flames: shadows that seemed to
advance and bear down on those two, sitting so close together on
the wide settee; shadows that wavered and spread like clutching,
threatening hands and mighty outraised weapons over them...over
those two fair heads, where the long curls now intermingled; over
that close embrace, nearer, closer, nearer...</p>

<p>She told him how the last bird had died that day&mdash;a
gorgeous creature with emerald plumes and silver crest. She had
kept it long in a little palace of gilded wires, and fed it on
sops made with cream; and yet still it had died, without regret,
she thought. "He could not endure the winter of the north," she
sighed. "It must have seemed to him as if life had stopped
indeed." And, in a low tone, with her lips close to his cheek,
she continued to talk about this bird as if it were a fairy-tale
she had heard in childhood. She did not indeed know if it were
reality or not, the story that she was so faintly telling; for
reality had ceased to exist for her. She only remembered the
lovely thing that had died, and her pity for it; her certainty
that he would pity it also.</p>

<p>From the stables a clock struck and then another sounded from
the recesses of the palace. They counted twelve strokes. And
then, in what seemed to them five minutes' time, they counted one
stroke. And Leopold said:</p>

<p>"Before we know we have even met together, it will be the
dawn." And he added, in the first terror he had felt since he had
entered her chamber: "Before the dawn I must be gone&mdash;before
the light..."</p>

<p>But now, she who had urged his going would not let him go.</p>

<p>"It is a long while yet to the dawn," she pleaded. "Winter's
dawn comes late; and you must stay, for I am now frightened to be
left alone!"</p>

<p>"I will take you away to-morrow," said Leopold, moving the
hair from her brow and staring down into the face which he could
scarcely see in this dim light. "To-morrow I will take you away.
To-night is mine."</p>

<p>She began to weep, hidden upon his shoulder: weeping for she
knew not what; weeping without let or hindrance, and yet without
real pain or fear. The shadows were all merging into one
monstrous shadow which engulfed them both.</p>

<p>Eleanora slipped to her knees beside him, overwhelmed by this
insistent darkness.</p>

<p>"I have not said my prayers to-night," she whispered.</p>

<p>"This is the first time, Monseigneur, that I have not said my
prayers."</p>

<p>"Could you not," he answered, "forget them once, for me?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, searching for him in the dark, "I could
forget everything for you! And indeed, Monseigneur, I believe
that I have forgotten it!"</p>

<p>Again the wind, gentle and majestic in the wide chimney, and
faintly rustling the white ashes of the last coals, the last
glowing sparkles on the hearth.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the stars are out," murmured Eleanora, faintly.
"Shall we not go, my love, and see?"</p>

<p>They went together to the window, rapt in this lovers' whim to
gaze upon the stars together, and she gently moved the curtain
aside. The night was clear, and there was a large rift, like a
lake or inland sea of blackness in which there sparkled the
clustered planets of the Pleiades.</p>

<p>But Leopold thought of the sentries, and almost instantly
pulled the dark and heavy folds closely again together. If the
sentries had been at that moment passing, they could not possibly
have seen this drawing of the curtain before the darkened room.
But there was some one who did see it, and that was Gabor, the
Transylvanian, who waited patiently, wrapped in his dark cloak,
upon the balcony. He had been there ever since he had seen
Leopold enter Eleanora's chamber. He waited with infinite calm,
and infinite expectation; nor for one second did he relax his
watchfulness. His eyes were ever on those windows, and they
flickered at once to that one where there was a movement. He saw
Leopold's white hand, even in this obscurity; he saw the blur of
it on the curtain, and the faintest glow of interior firelight;
and then he saw it withdrawn and the curtains pulled
together.</p>

<p>And he gave a sigh, as one who sees his desires at length
accomplished: after much labour, accomplished; he folded his arms
and leant against the stone, not feeling the chill or the winds
on his face, nor noticing the stars, nor the snow clouds that
raced in front of them and then again left them bare in the
plenitude of splendour; not heeding the sentries, who now and
then passed below him; not heeding nor caring for any of these
things; but keeping guard on the windows of the chamber of
Eleanora.</p>

<p>The longer Leopold stayed therein, the better for him; and
yet, if he stayed no longer&mdash;well enough! For any subterfuge
or evasions or excuse, or gloss or flourish, it was now too
late...</p>

<p>Gabor had insinuated himself without difficulty into
Ottenheim. He had not here ridden up boldly to the front door,
but crept in at the back, and so made his way to the quarters of
the officers of the garrison, where he was well known, and
considered eminently useful. Many of them were not even aware
that he had left the service of Christian, and none of them knew
the cause or extent of his disgrace. It had not, then, been
difficult for him to do exactly as he wished during those hours
in which he had first arrived at Ottenheim.</p>

<p>Now, as the time passed and he began to feel chilled, he paced
up and down, a very patient sentry, walking lightly so as not to
disturb the lovers. "Though I dare say it would take a great deal
to distract them," he smiled to himself. And presently he took a
flask, engraved with arms to which he had no right&mdash;the arms
of Gabor&mdash;and drank from it a stiff dose of brandy; and then
fell to his pacing again, to keep the blood circulating in his
veins. For the night increased in coldness.</p>

<p>He heard the cock crow, and stretched and yawned in his warm
pelisse. He saw the faint creeping dawn come up over the river,
and the great squadrons of clouds leap and fly in the freshening
wind, away over the Château, away across the park; and still he
kept his exact and patient vigil; and still he heard no sound
from the Princess Eleanora's chamber. He turned his thoughts
deliberately to Prince Christian. What had Prince Christian been
doing this most momentous night? He would make it his business to
find out some day. Probably the Generalissimo had been working
hard through all these cold, black hours, labouring in the cause
of Leopold. There might come a time when Gabor would like to
remind them both of that; when such a recollection would be a
fine twist in a bitter wound; an extra poignant pang to an
already perfect agony.</p>

<p>The dawn was strengthening. "Imprudent, imprudent and
inexperienced," sneered Gabor, "how late he leaves it!"</p>

<p>But for himself the moment had come. Action could no longer be
delayed. He tapped, lightly but with brisk determination, upon
the window where he had watched so long; and then he pressed the
window, laughing almost aloud, to find it was not latched. How
confident they had been&mdash;how raw to this manner of
intrigue...</p>

<p>He pushed the window wider, and boldly entered the bedchamber
of the Princess Eleanora.</p>

<p>For all his insolent effrontery, he was startled to find that
she was so near to him; for he had heard no movement in the room,
and had believed them both still asleep. But she was sitting
there, close to the window by her dressing table, all disarrayed,
with her hair falling to her waist and her hands holding up her
face while she gazed into the mirror, which was yet so dark that
she could behold no reflection therein.</p>

<p>Her girdle and her garters, her bodice and her gown, lay on
the floor beside her; and as Gabor made his stealthy entry he
stepped on them, not without an emphasis of contempt.</p>

<p>She slowly turned from her contemplation of her own face, and
stared at him with an expression of utter, amazed horror; so
stony and so dreadful that even he was faintly moved.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said, fearing that when she recovered from her
partial terror she would shriek. "Hush! There is nothing, Madame,
to fear; I have kept watch outside your window, when I think you
most needed watch and ward. Come! Will you not give me a reward
for that&mdash;you or your cavalier?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, his keen eyes searched the dusky twilit room for
Leopold. He could not see him, and for a moment felt an evil pang
lest his prey should have escaped. But Eleanora betrayed herself
instantly. She glanced over her shoulder at the curtained bed,
and in a voice of horror she said, childishly:</p>

<p>"He is still asleep."</p>

<p>"Then you would do well to wake him," sneered Gabor. "The
daylight strengthens with every second."</p>

<p>Drawing horrible recollections from even further depths of
terror, Eleanora recognized that pallid face, that spare figure,
those ashy eyes and sneering lips. She remembered Gabor in the
beechwoods at Dürsheim, and he seemed to her now, as he had
seemed to her then, a fiend.</p>

<p>"Come! Do not be alarmed!" he said, softly, amused by her
excess of terror. "I am safe&mdash;I shall not speak; but will
you not give me something as a pledge of that silence?" And his
tired eyes roamed over the trinkets that glittered on the
dressing table. "I have kept good watch," he added; and he could
not forbear a smile of deep triumph. When she had last seen him,
she had seen him struck across the face; and now he beheld her,
crouching there half naked, while her lover slept behind her in
her bed.</p>

<p>He leant forward, and his lean fingers picked up the two green
diamonds, one of the Kurland regalia. Well he could remember
them, and Herr Lippmann matching them one with another...</p>

<p>"Will you give me these?" he asked.</p>

<p>And she replied, in an expressionless voice:</p>

<p>"Take them away! I never want to see them again&mdash;take
anything."</p>

<p>Gabor placed the gems in his pocket, and Eleanora, with a
lunatic gesture, leaned forward and covered up the mirror, as if
she could not endure that it should witness her disaster.</p>

<p>"Rouse Monseigneur!" whispered Gabor; it was no part of his
design that the household should know of Leopold's visit to
Eleanora&mdash;that he should be seen in the brightening light
escaping from her room.</p>

<p>But Eleanora could not move; and Gabor, gazing at her
curiously, thought that she would faint, or even die, before his
eyes.</p>

<p>But Leopold was roused at last. He stood between the
jerked-back bed curtains, half dressed, in the dull twilight.
Immediately he recognized Gabor; immediately, also, he recognized
the trap, the snare, the spy&mdash;catastrophe.</p>

<p>"You blackguard!" he murmured, through bleached lips; and then
stood speechless before his fate.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Gabor was glib&mdash;serene.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he said, with a bow, "Count Hensdorff told me
to watch over Your Majesty. I have kept good ward outside this
lady's window; and now it is scarcely prudent that you should
linger. May I advise you to go, Sire, immediately?"</p>

<p>Eleanora clutched her shift closer about her shoulders; a
useless gesture, for she was nearly naked.</p>

<p>"Go," she said, looking at neither of the two men, "go."<br>
<br> <br></p>

<p>Gabor needed no dismissal; he did not stay to hear the
half-crazed reproaches and denunciations of Leopold. He bowed to
both of them; nor was his smile lost on either. He went as he had
come, daintily, through the window, and lowered himself carefully
from the low balcony, and slipped away and round the house and
through the courtyard; and so, unobserved and carelessly, to his
own quarters.</p>

<p>Leopold stared at Eleanora, and could find nothing to say; and
she put her face in her hands, and sat still before the dressing
table, as Gabor had found her.</p>

<p>"Spying for his own ends, or really sent by Hensdorff?"
Leopold wondered, in bitter distraction. But he could stay for
nothing. The perilous light was brightening too rapidly. Of all
things, he must not be caught here in her chamber.</p>

<p>"To-day," he stammered, dazed by this bitter awakening, "my
love, to-day or to-morrow I will take you to Bosenberg."</p>

<p>But Eleanora did not speak or move.</p>

<p>He put on his sword, and long his fingers fumbled with the
strap; flung his coat, still damp, over the disorder of his
dress&mdash;picked up his cloak which lay where she had placed it
last night, in front of the cold and ashy hearth, which then had
warmed and lit their deep embraces. In a second the women would
be astir: how could he have slept so sound on such a night?</p>

<p>"Unbolt the door," he whispered, "quickly! Pick up your
clothes and get back to bed!"</p>

<p>But still she, sitting motionless before the scattered trifles
on her dressing table, made no response; nor dared he linger.</p>

<p>This was a bitter awakening from a rapturous dream; he shrank
from the cold, harsh greyness of the winter morning, and turned
back, hesitant even now.</p>

<p>"Eleanora, say one word to me before I go!"</p>

<p>Then she looked up, and he saw that she had changed since
yesterday.</p>

<p>"Come for me soon!" she whispered, and hid her face again.</p>

<p>Leopold leant over her, and touched the light hair of her
fallen head with cold lips; then left her, in a panting hurry. On
to the balcony&mdash;over the balcony&mdash;down into the
courtyard. It was still too dark for him to be easily perceived.
The shadows were numerous yet; the light false and uncertain. He
turned aside from the imposing facade of the Château, and moved
quickly into the path and among the bare trees; he drew a breath
of agonized relief. No one need know! He had sent his horse away
last night&mdash;sent it by a groom to Bosenberg. No one need
know, and he could marry her&mdash;ay, and crown her too, that
other ceremony was as nothing. A letter to Rome, and it would be
on the instant dissolved&mdash;he had done no wrong, he
passionately told himself; yet he looked back at her window with
remorse and pain and bitter regrets. The flames had burnt out,
and the ashes were cold and colourless indeed; something had been
squandered that should have been hoarded, something defiled that
should have been cherished; he had already stared at her with the
eyes of satiety and found her in that dishonoured abandon of the
hideous dawn; less beautiful.</p>

<p>He made his way unobserved across the park, moving, ever
hurriedly, away from the Château. Never had he known the world
look so chill and drab; never had he seen a sky so heavy, nor
woods so utterly bare. And faintly, slowly, the snow was
beginning to fall again.</p>

<p>Was it last night that he and Eleanora had looked at that rift
in the storm clouds and seen the planets with their blue fire?
Time had fallen into a confusion for him. He must send for Gabor;
Gabor must be bought or silenced, in some manner bought or
silenced. He wondered in torment how he could find Gabor...</p>

<p>The Transylvanian was already riding away, with the green
diamond named Mitau, and its fellow, in his pocket.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">CHRISTIAN had not been able immediately to
follow up those brilliant and dashing successes which had
startled Europe. His medley of troops, his unruly councils of
potentates, were not immediately to be co-ordinated into one
manageable whole. De Lisle, the Commander-in-Chief's main support
on the field and in the closet, had fallen ill; other French
officers, who held their position more by reason of their rank
than their abilities, fell into a quick disaffection, many
jealousies among themselves, and a combined jealousy of
Christian.</p>

<p>Marshal Knittelfeldt had been defeated in Bavaria. The
Imperialists had been forced to fall back in Italy, and the
Allies, smarting from their successive defeats and their enormous
loss of towns and forts, crowned by that supreme loss of
Brussels, that capital and citadel they had so long held as a
gauge, it seemed, of ultimate success, were making a supreme and
impressive effort to retrieve both their prestige and their
territory. For weeks Christian had manoeuvred from one position
to another, striving to force the enemy into another open
engagement, in which he felt quite confident of his usual
success; but the Allies avoided such a perilous meeting, while
they gathered strength and exercised themselves in inflicting a
series of small defeats on the lesser generals who served
Leopold. The absence of the Emperor from the headquarters, and
also the paucity of any news concerning his movements or his
intentions, helped to influence the already reluctant and
disaffected spirits of the officers, and, in a way, to dampen the
ardour of the men. There seemed no definite symbol of what they
were fighting for; and the war, already long and purposeless,
seemed to lengthen and become even more indefinite in aim and
object.</p>

<p>Christian alone held the Imperialists together. What he did
not himself do was not done. Caring for no one, and not naturally
affable, nor making any effort to charm or impress, he yet had
achieved a stupendous position by the sheer force of his
qualities. His inflexible resolve, his impeccable courage, his
expert knowledge, superb self-confidence and long-accustomed air
of command and authority, gave him an almost independent position
among the troops, and held in check even those officers who most
chafed against his position, and most insolently wished to assert
their own prerogatives. Though many of these took a malicious
pleasure in making matters as difficult as possible for the
Generalissimo, none of them dared, openly and outwardly, to
thwart his designs or oppose his command.</p>

<p>And, though the intention to fight through the winter months
was universally unpopular, there were not many officers who had
dared to take advantage of their position to return to their
homes.</p>

<p>Christian was ill seconded, both in the Commissariat, the
engineers, and the financial affairs of the campaign. In all
these departments was ineptitude and a certain confusion. Money,
food, and all necessary material began to be scarce in the camps.
Christian found himself obliged to draw on his own resources for
some necessary payments. Leopold's ministers were both useless
and indifferent. It was not easy, even for Christian, with his
gift of organization, to create order out of chaos in such a
moment, in a war-racked country, the enemy pressing in on all
sides.</p>

<p>The harvests, though they had now been taken in, were poor and
scanty. It was difficult to feed the men, even more difficult to
feed the horses. Christian had inherited a large sum of other
men's indifferences, blunders and carelessnesses, to say nothing
of corruption and thievery. Those whom he reproved sneered behind
his back at his own fortune&mdash;gained, as they reminded each
other, by some such means; his father had contrived, the
malcontents grumbled, when in command of the Imperial resources,
to fill the money bags with the sums which he was now
enjoying.</p>

<p>Christian took no heed to any of them. He was completely
absorbed and occupied by the performance of his arduous duties,
and the concentration on his immediate goal&mdash;that of
bringing the campaign to neat and outwardly successful
conclusion, and of crowning Leopold in Frankfurt. He permitted
nothing to vex or irritate him. He had been quite prepared for
all these annoyances, difficulties and unpleasantnesses, and
serenely resolved to succeed in spite of them. "Nothing," he
said, "shall prevent me doing that which I have set out to
do."</p>

<p>But even this heroic patience began to be frayed by the
continued absence of Leopold. He did not even know&mdash;and no
one else seemed to know, either&mdash;where the Emperor was:
certainly not in Vienna, Berlin or Dresden. And Hensdorff, who
had gone in search of him, sent no letter. The severe weather
became like another enemy in the field: cold, fog and rain
darkened day after day; the roads became impassable, the rivers
swollen. The usual illnesses of an army were accentuated by
exposure to the inclement season. Many grumbled openly about this
continued keeping in the field long after the usual time for
concluding a campaign. There was no excuse, they said, for not
going into winter quarters immediately. The Imperialists had
achieved sufficient glory for the moment.</p>

<p>Christian took no notice of any of these complaints. It was
not his intention to suspend operations for a moment until he had
accomplished his task and earned his rewards; steadily he kept
before his eyes, Kurland and Eleanora.</p>

<p>He had noticed that for the last week or two there had been no
letters from Ottenheim, but this did not greatly trouble him. He
knew the condition of the roads, and the numerous delays to which
even the most expert and swiftest messengers were subjected; and
he continued to send off, as usual, his instructions to his
steward, to Colonel Pons and to the Duchess of Schönbuchel. He
had from the first resolved that nothing should shake his
patience or his equanimity; and that resolution was not likely to
be lightly shaken. He preserved, not only his outward composure,
but his inner high, mounting spirits. He looked beyond the
present grey, laborious days, and saw the spring at Ottenheim,
and on the banks of the Danube; and with indomitable courage and
unfaltering energy, he pressed daily nearer Frankfurt, where he
had bidden all such potentates and princes as supported Leopold
to meet him, and where he had urged Hensdorff to tell the Emperor
to summon a Diet.</p>

<p>Hampered by the illness of De Lisle, the hostility of the
French second-in-command, De Brissot, and the return, with the
increasing evil weather, of many of the French princes of the
blood to Paris; harried by the enemy, pressing down from Hanover,
Westphalia and the Netherlands, Christian, learning from his
agents that the enemy were concentrating directly across his
painful line of arduous march, paused at Limburg hoping to hear
at least from Hensdorff, if he did not receive in person the
Emperor himself. His operations, as he to his cost knew, were
extended over far too wide a field. He had not sufficient troops
to hold what he had taken. And even if he had been far more
faithfully and ably seconded, his task touched the impossible;
the enemy were so firmly wedged into the country, Austria being
surrounded by hostile troops, in Hungary, in Bavaria, in Styria
and Poland, which was divided alike in arms and politics.</p>

<p>The King of France showed no inclination to send further
troops to participate in a war which was no concern of his, and
the glory of which redounded to another monarch's credit.</p>

<p>The English, Hanoverians and Dutch, rapidly reinforced, had
advanced again through the Palatinate and flung themselves across
Christian's path, occupying the range of the Taunus and the town
of Wiesbaden. A regiment of French cavalry, under General
Châterault, who had striven to oppose them, had been almost
annihilated.</p>

<p>In these conditions, Christian made his concentration camp at
Limburg, and there drew up all available troops, leaving only the
least possible garrisons in his late conquests. He had never had
the number of men for which he had asked, and those he had
received were decimated by losses in battle, by illness, and, in
some cases, even by desertion. Many of his regiments were only
raw, pressed men of no discipline or training. The veteran
troops, which he had enrolled and trained himself, did not amount
to very many. The French troops were excellent, but indolent and
disaffected to the cause for which they fought. The indignant
murmur, "We should have stayed in Brussels for the winter," grew
and swelled in Christian's camp.</p>

<p>He remained silent, disclosing his mind to no one. When he had
been two days at Limburg, Count Hensdorff arrived at the camp.
Christian's headquarters were in a small, abandoned country house
outside the town, on a slight eminence crowned by a group of now
bare poplars. In the meagre park were encamped his own regiments
of Uhlans and Black Cuirassiers. The house being too small for
the continuous business which had to be transacted, a number of
tents and pavilions had been erected by the outbuildings. On the
highest gable of this modest country residence blew the Imperial
flag, and beside it the flag of Kurland. A wind was tearing the
high, dark clouds to pieces, and scattering them across a pallid
sky. It was bitterly cold, and Hensdorff shivered as he entered
the low doorway; shivered and beat his hands together in their
thick fur gloves.</p>

<p>As he entered the room where he knew he must meet Christian,
he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Christian was seated by a table on which there were spread
papers which, for once, had nothing to do with battles or sieges,
or any of the paraphernalia of war. The two quiet,
elderly-looking men with him did not wear swords; one was an
architect, the other a gardener and florist; and what they had
spread before them was the plans of gardens and pavilions and
houses.</p>

<p>Christian had brought these two men in his train from
Brussels, and every available moment of leisure he devoted to
discussing with them the proposed additions and improvements to
Ottenheim...to the palaces in Mitau.</p>

<p>He had the usual princely taste for gardening and building,
and his diversion and delight was the erecting of noble palaces,
and the laying out of magnificent parks. As he listened to the
florist explaining his parterres, his cascades and fountains, he
totally forgot the laborious weight of his military undertakings;
and he saw the papers before him transformed into a delicious,
visionary future&mdash;his sons' horses in those long, low, neat
stables; his daughters plucking blooms from those elegant vases
set on tall terraces; and Eleanora, the presiding goddess of this
earthly paradise, wandering beneath those lofty trees which
should shade the sumptuous rococo of a Grecian temple.</p>

<p>But when he noticed Hensdorff, he put aside these plans
instantly, and dismissed the two men. He had a not uncordial
feeling for the minister, and never had he been more pleased to
see any one than he was to see Count Hensdorff now.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff slowly, almost painfully, took off his cloak,
his hat, his fur gloves, and huddled himself into the chair by
the stove.</p>

<p>"I have been ill," he muttered briefly; and still he did not
look at Christian. "I ought to have written before," he added, in
a mumbled tone of apology. "I must beg you, Monseigneur, to
excuse me. I have indeed been ill."</p>

<p>Christian was secretly intolerant of illness. Any failure of
mind or body were alike incomprehensible and abhorrent to him.
But he answered kindly:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to hear that, my dear Count. You certainly do
not look well." And he marked, with some amazement, the changed,
haggard and ruined aspect of Hensdorff, who appeared now an old
and broken man. "De Lisle is also ill," he added, "and that
hinders me, for I get very little support from any one else."
There being no reply to this, Christian rose, and asked: "When is
the Emperor returning to headquarters?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff muttered:</p>

<p>"Soon, I believe."</p>

<p>"Where has he been?" asked Christian, patiently thinking that
Hensdorff was ashamed because of Leopold's deficiencies, and
wished to spare him; Christian pitied him for serving such a
master.</p>

<p>"He will be here, I think," murmured Hensdorff, carefully,
warming his hands at the earthenware stove, "in a day or so."</p>

<p>"Where has he been?" repeated Christian. "With a woman?"</p>

<p>And Hensdorff, shivering as if the coals gave off an icy blast
instead of heat, replied:</p>

<p>"Yes; with a woman."</p>

<p>Christian shrugged and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you will keep him from any more such vagaries. I
can assure you, my dear Count, that I have my hands full as it
is."</p>

<p>"I know that," replied Hensdorff. And now he did bring
himself, though with something of an effort, to turn in his seat
and look at Christian. He somehow foolishly expected to see the
soldier changed, as he felt he had himself changed since they had
last met. It was odd and terrible to Hensdorff to see Christian
appear exactly the same. He was in field-marshal's uniform, and
the full panoply of martial state; for he had just come in from a
parade of his Uhlans, where he had taken the review in the
absence of the Emperor. His appointments were exact and neat in
every detail: his laces as fine, his stars as glittering, his
looped cords as burnished; he wore The Golden Fleece, as
sparkling, no tarnish anywhere; his hair was powdered, pomaded
and elaborately dressed; his eyes appeared slightly fatigued and
shadowed; but apart from this, Hensdorff could detect no trace of
fatigue, depression or ill health in his handsome, serene and
almost expressionless face. And the minister thought, with a dull
sense of relief in his sickened mind: "Perhaps, after all, he has
no feelings."</p>

<p>Christian, walking up and down the room, and speaking lightly
in his soft voice, began to tell the minister of his situation
and his plans; of the many lacks and wants of the troops; and of
his intention to push forward to Frankfurt, even across the
imposing army of the Allies.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he declared, "will hearten our men and dispirit the
Allies more than to have the Emperor crowned. This is also part
of my bargain, and I am anxious that it should be accomplished as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>Hensdorff listened to these words without their conveying much
sense to his mind, which was overladen and oppressed by other
thoughts. All the while he was considering Christian; not what
Christian said, but the man himself, in all his theatrical and
superb beauty; his neatness, precision and elegance; his almost
dandified pride and grace, which concealed, as Hensdorff well
knew, such supreme capacities of leadership, such laborious
genius and such unflinching heroism.</p>

<p>He roused himself to say that supplies of men and money were
coming from Vienna and Dresden; even, he hoped, from Berlin,
where the King of Prussia, always agile in his own interests, had
returned, promising to appear at Frankfurt for the Coronation of
Leopold. Hensdorff went into all these details civilly, and with
little spirit. Christian could not fail to mark his extreme
lassitude, and wondered, ironically, if he had quarrelled with
Leopold.</p>

<p>Pausing by the narrow window, and looking out into the dark
and windy day, Christian asked when exactly the Emperor would
arrive.</p>

<p>"Can he review the troops before we leave Limburg?" he asked.
"I would not, at the outside, delay here more than two days. I am
waiting for some French cavalry reinforcements, but I shall not
wait overlong. De Lisle has a little recovered, also, and I hope
that he can mount a horse almost immediately."</p>

<p>Hensdorff rose.</p>

<p>"The Emperor should be here to-morrow or the day after
to-morrow," he said, stiffly.</p>

<p>Christian did not press him further, but asked if he had found
lodgings in Limburg; and Hensdorff said no, he had given no
thought to that.</p>

<p>"I will send one of my aides-de-camp," said Christian, "who
will see that you are fairly housed."</p>

<p>Hensdorff shook his head mutely, as if his lodging was of no
matter to him; and Christian, moved by a generous impulse towards
the minister, who looked so old, so shattered and so fatigued,
stepped up to him and clasped his hand.</p>

<p>"My dear Count, for my sake you must look after yourself, for
you are the only man on whom I can rely!" As he spoke thus, in an
accent of kindliness, Christian was surprised to see Hensdorff
wince, and turn away, quickly withdrawing his hand.</p>

<p>"I beg Your Highness not to rely on me," he said, heavily;
"for I have served you very ill."</p>

<p>Christian knew that he referred to the conduct of Leopold, and
replied, lightly:</p>

<p>"As for His Majesty, my dear Count, we all knew from the first
what material we had to deal with there. Believe me, I am not in
the least discomposed. If he arrives at Limburg to-day or
to-morrow, we shall still do very well."</p>

<p>Hensdorff looked at him queerly.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to give battle?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," said Christian. "Before the men get further
disheartened, fatigued and corrupted. This campaign must be
success after success, or complete failure. We cannot afford to
wait, or even to pause. The Empire is too divided, and the Queen
of Hungary too strong."</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not answer; the picture of when and how he had
last seen Leopold was so clearly before his own mind that it
seemed to him that the other man must see it too. Bosenberg, soon
after a winter dawn, and he waiting there, in the great room with
the pictures of dead Imperial rulers; waiting there, walking up
and down the long floor, looking out of the long windows, seeing
the dawn brighten so reluctantly in the sullen sky; waiting for
Leopold to return from that secret journey on which he had gone,
his servant did not know when or how. And the return of Leopold
at last, walking unsteadily, almost like a drunken man, letting
his cloak fall apart over his disordered undress; his hair loose,
his sword half unbuckled, staring at Hensdorff with blank eyes.
Dreadful meeting...and one still so poignant and vivid in
Hensdorff's mind that it seemed grotesquely impossible that it
was unknown to this other man, standing so serenely before him;
and he thought, with a kind of desperate curiosity: "How is it
possible that that could happen, and he not know?"</p>

<p>Christian continued to talk of the details of the campaign; of
the unmanageable insolence of many of the highborn French
officers; of the illness of De Lisle; of the glaring failures in
the Commissariat and the Engineers: all with good nature and
patience, without either excuse or complaint. Everything that he
did was done from policy; he knew neither cruelty nor
fear&mdash;nor, in these matters, self-interest.</p>

<p>"I hoped," he remarked, "to defeat the Allies again before
they had so strengthened themselves, but it was impossible: my
front was too scattered, and I never could get enough men
together in the right place at the right time."</p>

<p>Hensdorff, to whom the question had been of supreme
importance, noted that he had not again asked where the Emperor
had been; so little a matter was Leopold in Christian's mind.
Nothing of the Emperor's movements concerned him, save that he
should be there at the given time, to act his puppet part in
Frankfurt.</p>

<p>Then Christian, turning to another matter, spoke words that
went through Hensdorff like a cold wind piercing his shrinking
flesh. Christian said:</p>

<p>"I have had no news from Ottenheim for some time now; it is
these roads, no doubt; the foul weather. And yet, I thought I
should have heard by now."</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff repeated, mechanically:</p>

<p>"Your Highness has had no news from Ottenheim?"</p>

<p>"The Duchess," remarked Christian, "has left three or four of
my letters unanswered."</p>

<p>Hensdorff wondered whether he was conscious that he had thus
betrayed the fact that he did not expect to hear from his
wife.</p>

<p>"And Colonel Pons, I should have thought <i>he</i> would have
written, at least; no doubt he has done so," added Christian,
"but the roads are barbarous, and the posts get mostly
delayed."</p>

<p>"I have certainly found travelling difficult," muttered
Hensdorff, under his breath. He could not force himself to say
anything about Ottenheim; he could not force himself to remain
any longer in the room; he felt at once shuddering and stifling,
overwhelmed by a sense of having undertaken more than his forces
could accomplish.</p>

<p>Christian rang a bell, and, when an officer immediately
appeared, told him to discover some fair lodgings for Count
Hensdorff. "Not too far from my headquarters, and where there is
some comfort; for the Count has been ill," he added,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The old man fumbled with his fur gloves, and seemed to try to
speak. What diabolical irony made Christian so kind to him? Never
before had he seen such amiable friendliness on that dark,
handsome face, which too often was composed to an insolent
gravity; never before, either, had he such cause to admire this
man.</p>

<p>For he had lately learned something of what he had
accomplished, and the stupendous task he had undertaken&mdash;a
bargain, a sordid bargain, perhaps, and he a mere mercenary whose
services had been bought; but in every way he had given of his
superb best; in nothing had he shirked or faltered. Had he been
the most loyal of paladins, serving a beloved emperor, he could
not have done more than he had done for Leopold.</p>

<p>Hensdorff winced and sickened when he considered this, and
hesitated, not knowing how to leave this man, not knowing what to
do or say&mdash;although for days he had striven to prepare for
this meeting, to consider and debate how he should conduct
himself at this momentous interview.</p>

<p>While he hesitated, despatches were brought in to Christian,
who read them, standing, after a courteous gesture towards the
minister.</p>

<p>Bad news...the Maréchal de Belfort, hard pressed at Saar, had
been defeated heavily&mdash;even there, on the borders of
Lorraine; he was close on the messenger's heels, bringing up his
shattered and exhausted forces to the shelter of Limburg in the
valley of the Lahn.</p>

<p>A faint distress marred Christian's serenity. There had been
on every side defeat, since the day when he had entered Brussels;
he was instantly just to the defeated general, as he had been
instantly severe to Fürth and Olivenza.</p>

<p>"Belfort is a good man," he remarked, "but he was not
sufficiently reinforced." He glanced at Hensdorff, and added,
quietly: "I hope the Emperor will not delay his coming."</p>

<p>Quickly behind the first messenger had come another; Christian
gave him instant attention. Hensdorff waited and listened also,
in deep, mute anxiety. An agent, employed in the enemy's
territory, wished to see the Generalissimo at once.</p>

<p>Christian briefly referred this to General Von Schuckenberg,
who had this department in charge; also all the deciphering, the
keys of various and possible ciphers.</p>

<p>"I have told you this before," he added.</p>

<p>But the messenger said, with many excuses, that the agent had
insisted upon a personal interview with Christian. "The matter,
he declared, is personal to Your Highness."</p>

<p>"How can it possibly be personal to me?" demanded Christian,
haughtily.</p>

<p>The door was pushed gently open, and the agent, who had
followed the messenger closely behind, softly, daintily, entered
the apartment.</p>

<p>Hensdorff saw Gabor.</p>

<p>"I might have known!" he said; and took off his gloves again,
and laid down his hat.</p>

<p>Christian also immediately recognized Gabor, but for a second
he remained at a loss, so entirely had he forgotten the existence
of this man. He had not even been aware that he had been retained
in the service of Hensdorff.</p>

<p>Gabor, with his hand in the bosom of his dark dress, smiled
from one to the other, and Hensdorff returned that smile with a
look of lightning hate.</p>

<p>"Gabor!" exclaimed Christian, frowning; and suddenly, all the
circumstances of his last dismissal of this man flew to his mind.
"I will hear nothing you have to say," he remarked, sternly.
"Begone at once."</p>

<p>But Hensdorff squared his shoulders, and muttered: "Let him
stay! I must ask Your Highness to allow Ferdinand Gabor to
stay."</p>

<p>Christian looked sharply at the speaker, then dismissed the
messenger.</p>

<p>"Speak!" he commanded.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="first">GABOR bowed suavely towards Hensdorff, and
asked, with courtly suavity: "Is it your pleasure, Monseigneur,
to remain and hear what I have to say?"</p>

<p>Christian retained his bland composure, but he was slightly
puzzled by the demeanour of Hensdorff; also by the sudden
appearance of Gabor, a man who by him had been equally detested
and forgotten. "Why," he asked himself, "should Hensdorff wish to
remain to hear what the Transylvanian spy has to say?"</p>

<p>He asked him so roundly, reminding him that neither of them
had time for foolishness; but Hensdorff had resolved upon his
part. He had heard from Leopold of the intolerable part Gabor had
in this intolerable affair, and he saw that the inevitable moment
had come&mdash;the moment that he had wished, with all his skill
and adroitness, to keep at bay; but which no skill or adroitness
had been able to keep at bay, and which now must be faced. That
Gabor was implacable, he well knew; that to evade him was
impossible he also well knew. And with that courage which he had
seldom called upon, but which he had always in reserve, he
resolved to face the dreadful moment.</p>

<p>"I know what this man has come to say," he remarked, "and I
should wish to stay beside Your Highness while he tells his
story."</p>

<p>Gabor shrugged and bowed. The presence of Hensdorff was a
slight blot upon his hoarded triumph, yet not a large one.</p>

<p>"It is as Monseigneur pleases," he replied, with the insolence
of a lackey.</p>

<p>Christian continued to look sharply from one man to another.
An insidious and sinister doubt troubled him as to the precise
nature of the affair between these two men, so unlike and yet
evidently now with some bond between them. He regarded them both
with an accentuation of his natural haughtiness. It seemed to him
as incredible as detestable that it should possibly be in Gabor's
power in any way to disturb him. He could not conceive why
Hensdorff should wish to wait for this grotesque interview.</p>

<p>Hensdorff put his thin right hand before his old, clouded and
unhappy eyes.</p>

<p>"Why," demanded Christian of Gabor, with increasing sternness,
"do you not speak?"</p>

<p>And Gabor, with a grin of pride, as one who sees his foe
falling before him, asked:</p>

<p>"Has Your Highness heard lately from Ottenheim?"</p>

<p>This name was to Christian perfumed and festooned with a
thousand delights, a thousand delicate graces; and he frowned to
hear it upon such lips. Interrogating the insolent speaker with
his clear, steady and angry eyes, he remained, however, tranquil;
and, as Gabor did not immediately reply and seemed to gloat over
the moment of suspense, Christian, with a gesture of dandyism
that had become almost mechanical with him, flicked invisible
dust from his brocaded cuff.</p>

<p>"Your Highness will not have heard from Colonel Pons for
several days," remarked Gabor; and Christian asked:</p>

<p>"How do you know that I have not heard from Colonel Pons?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff, staring horribly through his fingers, saw
Christian's impressive figure almost imperceptibly straighten as
he spoke these words.</p>

<p>"Colonel Pons is dead," announced Gabor.</p>

<p>Hensdorff noticed that Christian had sufficient self-control
not to repeat that tremendous word, which is nearly always
echoed.</p>

<p>"How should Colonel Pons die?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that," replied Gabor, odiously. "He shot
himself. He came down to the guardroom in the garrison a little
later than usual one morning; he appeared to be as usual, but he
had no orders to give and no questions to ask. He demanded wine
and drank at a gulp. Then he said: 'Blast him to all eternity!'
and went away. They found out he shot himself almost immediately,
in the park."</p>

<p>Hensdorff closed his hands over his eyes, and felt his
trembling fingers cold upon his hot lids. He heard a sigh from
Christian, and then Christian's voice.</p>

<p>"To whom did Colonel Pons refer when he said 'Blast him to all
eternity'?"</p>

<p>Gabor licked his lips over the exquisite flavor of his
triumph.</p>

<p>"Leopold," he answered.</p>

<p>At that name, Hensdorff felt as if choking ashes filled the
warm room. He took his hands from his face, and stood up to his
moment of supreme humiliation and utter discomfiture. He even
inflicted on himself the agony of looking at Christian; but
Christian was as yet unchanged. His valour had not yet been
pricked, nor his pride breathed upon.</p>

<p>Gabor put his haggard hand into his thin bosom, and appeared
to fondle something beneath the folds of his plain, austere
cravat.</p>

<p>Christian asked no more questions. He was mute and erect, and
quite motionless. Gabor's voice came deliberately.</p>

<p>"You, Monseigneur, may slay me for what I am about to say; and
I can be slain, having said it. My life is in your power, but not
my silence."</p>

<p>Christian sighed again. It seemed to Hensdorff, in his agony,
a most extraordinary thing that he should do so&mdash;sigh at
this juncture.</p>

<p>Gabor played with the moment: he seemed to fondle it as if it
were a cherished child&mdash;to caress every one of these
seconds, so dreadful to Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"I have been to Ottenheim," he smiled, "where I so long served
you, Monseigneur; services that you kindly repaid with a cut
across my face. Perhaps you may recall: your memory is good, I
think, even for trivialities. I have been to Ottenheim, and I
have seen the Princess Eleanora."</p>

<p>The old, trembling voice of Hensdorff cut across his
speech.</p>

<p>"You shall not say what you intend to say! Leave it! Leave
it!"</p>

<p>But Gabor replied, undauntedly:</p>

<p>"I will say every word that I intended to say. Why should I
leave anything?"</p>

<p>And Christian, in an expressionless tone, said:</p>

<p>"Leave nothing."</p>

<p>"I have been sentinel," smiled Gabor, "outside the Princess
Eleanora's window, all through one winter night: a dog to watch
outside her window, Prince Christian. That window was unlatched:
they were so inexperienced! Both of them so inexperienced!"</p>

<p>"<i>They</i>?" whispered Christian.</p>

<p>And Gabor replied immediately, as if there was a dart in his
voice&mdash;so keen and vivid were his words:</p>

<p>"She, Eleanor&mdash;and Leopold: together in that room all
night. When I broke in upon them, thinking the dawn made such
dallying indiscreet, I saw her, Prince Christian, half naked at
her dressing table; and he behind her, asleep in her bed...your
bed, Monseigneur, that you so brightly decked for her."</p>

<p>Christian said, on a sob:</p>

<p>"You blackguard! I will have you flogged to death!"</p>

<p>"Ay, no doubt!" replied Gabor, with unquenchable fury and
unflickering hate; "and take these, Monseigneur, as my parting
gift&mdash;a second time let them be a parting gift."</p>

<p>He brought his hand swiftly from his breast, and held out to
Christian the two green diamonds that he had given to Eleanora on
his wedding night.</p>

<p>"She gave me these&mdash;her bribe for silence. They were
lying unregarded, with other trinkets, on her toilet table; her
bribe for silence, I say! But she did not offer high enough. No
pearls or diamonds, nor gold&mdash;ay, nor any gems&mdash;could
have bought this moment from me, Prince Christian."</p>

<p>Hensdorff cried, with trembling hoarseness:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, have done! Have done! I implore Your Highness
to have this wretch dragged out."</p>

<p>"Ay!" Gabor caught it up quickly: "To shout out my news before
the camp?"</p>

<p>Christian moved and raised his eyes: his level glance stared
down the fury of the man in front of him. He said, in a voice not
by one inflexion out of control:</p>

<p>"I marked you deeper than I thought, Gabor; I see the mark of
my ring quite plainly across your lip!"</p>

<p>At this, most unexpected, the spy winced back, his malice
fluttering on his ashy lips. He had expected death, not this;
some fury, tremendous and ungovernable; but never this...</p>

<p>"Back to your gutter, dog!" added Christian. "Back to your
filth and garbage...and do not dare to come within my sight
again..."</p>

<p>The keen edge of Gabor's triumph was blunted. How many times
he had rehearsed this moment: but never like this. His keen eyes,
vivid with malice, searched in vain the cold face before him for
any sign of pain.</p>

<p>"You brave it out, Monseigneur!" he snarled. "But it is done,
and cannot be undone; and I was the first to tell you." He took a
stealthy step towards the door.</p>

<p>"Have me touched," he added, in tones shrill with venom, "and
I will make her name as stale as that of any commoner of the
camp!"</p>

<p>Christian continued to stare him down unflinchingly, without a
quiver of his lids or of his lips.</p>

<p>"Go!" muttered Hensdorff, hoarsely: "go! Have you not seen,
you blackguard, that you can do nothing more here?"</p>

<p>Gabor had other and even deeper injuries burning upon his
lips; but before that unflinching stare, that mute arrogance of
Christian, he could not utter them. Even the vigour of his hate
was taken aback by the vigour of the other man's pride. But there
was time; so he controlled his yet unslaked malice: there was
time&mdash;other places, other opportunities; much that he might
yet do to wound and dismay.</p>

<p>Without a salute to either of the men, and with as much
insolence as he could command, he left them.</p>

<p>Hensdorff, giddy with nausea, shaded his eyes again; yet,
through his fingers, with horrible furtiveness, watched the other
man. Slowly Christian turned his gaze from the door through which
Gabor had retreated, and looked down at the two diamonds left
lying upon the humble table. These he took up, with unfaltering
fingers, and put into his pocket; then rang the bell. Hensdorff
waited.</p>

<p>When the aide-de-camp entered, Christian said, in a voice yet
level and expressionless:</p>

<p>"A man has just left me: one Gabor&mdash;a Transylvanian spy,
an agent once employed by me. He is most vile and treacherous: a
dangerous man. Follow him, and in some secret place have him
swiftly arrested and gagged. Mark you that, Captain de
Bernet&mdash;have him gagged! See that he does not open his
mouth. For it would be only to utter profanities that he would do
so. Keep him so, in strict confinement, gagged, until you know my
pleasure&mdash;at once&mdash;to this I hold you answerable, and
see I am not interrupted by any one for half an hour or so."</p>

<p>The officer saluted and withdrew.</p>

<p>The first chill of grey dusk had invaded the room; the
neglected fire was falling out, Christian sat down and looked
slowly at Hensdorff, who remained huddled and motionless in his
low seat.</p>

<p>Christian said:</p>

<p>"There is brandy in that cupboard: will you, Count, give me
some?" And, as Hensdorff rose in silence, he added: "Is this
true?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff, without answering, found the brandy, poured it out
and brought the glass to the table.</p>

<p>Christian repeated:</p>

<p>"Is it true?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff replied:</p>

<p>"Drink that, for God's sake!" Then added: "Yes."</p>

<p>"You were there?" asked Christian.</p>

<p>Hensdorff replied:</p>

<p>"I was at Bosenberg: I waited for him. I was there when he
came home. There is nothing to be said in the way of extenuation,
of excuse."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she..." asked Christian, and for the first time his
voice faltered. "Was it found out?" he added.</p>

<p>"They were such fools!" replied Hensdorff, with bitter
contempt. "Yes, it was found out. And that old woman, the Duchess
of Schönbuchel, told her what she was...she spared her
nothing."</p>

<p>"And Pons shot himself," said Christian. "She was not worth
it&mdash;eh, Hensdorff?"</p>

<p>"Pons was cut to the heart that he had been outwitted, and his
trust betrayed; but it was not his fault; it was an act of the
most foul treachery!"</p>

<p>Christian raised the glass of brandy, but set it down
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hensdorff," he murmured, "I feel sick&mdash;a sudden and
utter sickness. Never in my life before such weakness...O God,
what shall I do if I should not be able to command myself?"</p>

<p>"I did what I could," answered the minister, in the extreme of
bitter distress; "I hastened after him, for I guessed; I tried to
save her for you, but I was too late."</p>

<p>"In my room&mdash;my house&mdash;my bed!" breathed Christian,
as if he had not heard these words. "Why, I am ill! It is as if
the sudden blow had struck all my senses! And that dog to see
her, as he said he saw her..."</p>

<p>"Have him strangled," said Hensdorff, "and thrown into a
ditch..."</p>

<p>"Where is she now?" asked Christian, heedless of this.

<p>"At Ottenheim," replied Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"'What title has she now?" asked Christian, with a terrible
smile. "What shall I call her? His harlot and my wife."

<p>Hensdorff said, heavily:</p>

<p>"Everything is in your hands; without you he has no crown, no
army, no chance."</p>

<p>"You remind me of that?"</p>

<p>"You must when you come to think&mdash;and now you cannot
think&mdash;discover it for yourself," replied Hensdorff with
dignity. "I do not disguise from you, Monseigneur, that you could
betray him as he has betrayed you."</p>

<p>"No," breathed Christian, "for he has no wife, and a crown is
but a particle of dust on a scale so weighed against me."</p>

<p>Hensdorff walked up and down the small, mean room, which every
moment was getting colder and darker.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, labouring painfully with his words, "I
thought, in my weakness and my folly, to keep this from Your
Highness for a while, till matters were less critical...thinking
of everything involved&mdash;so many men, so many
fortunes&mdash;a cause which was, once at least, a worthy cause,
I felt myself justified in keeping this from Your Highness until
the issue of the campaign had been decided. But that scoundrel
pushed his point; and now, I cannot persuade, I cannot hope."</p>

<p>Christian raised his hand and made a slight gesture, as if he
brushed aside a cloud of irritating words&mdash;as if these
elaborate sentences were no more to him than that.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he asked, "that she was forced?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff replied, bitterly:</p>

<p>"No. But all the blame lies with him." He paused before
Christian, and added, desperately: "I hope Your Highness holds me
guiltless in this matter; if you did not, I should be forced to
destroy myself, even as Colonel Pons destroyed himself."</p>

<p>"I believe," muttered Christian, dully, "that you are a man of
honour."</p>

<p>"Honour!" repeated Hensdorff, in broken tones; "I know not how
honour enters into any of this affair. I had struck him down with
my own hand before I had been a party to this!"</p>

<p>The immobility and silence of Christian were appalling to
Hensdorff. He added, in broken tones, with the frenzy of a man
who hastens a dreaded climax:</p>

<p>"And now, what will Your Highness do? What shall we any of us
do?"</p>

<p>Christian gave him an awful smile.</p>

<p>"Do you think this pierces me?" he asked. "Do you not think
that I am still invincible?"</p>

<p>"But what will you do?" cried Hensdorff.</p>

<p>Christian put his hand into his pocket. Hensdorff noticed with
horror that at last his firm fingers were shaking.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "don't! Don't look at them! Don't touch them or
think of them!"</p>

<p>But Christian had brought the two diamonds out, and laid them
on the table.</p>

<p>"Could she not have given him anything else?" he whispered
"Anything else but these! Half naked at her table, he said,
gazing at her rifled charms: an accomplished wanton so
soon&mdash;eh, Hensdorff? How they learn it! And I had thought
her so immaculate!&mdash;so before my possible profaning. Mitau
this was called, my Kurland capital..."</p>

<p>"Let be!" urged Hensdorff, hoarsely; "let be! It is beyond
reflexion! Root her out of your mind! You can be rid of her!"</p>

<p>"I am in a void," said Christian, gazing at the green lustre
of the stones and as if speaking to himself. "Nothing appears to
exist any longer...was it possible that I lived in a world so
self-created?"</p>

<p>A sound of distant trumpets broke the stillness of the
gathering night. Christian listened.</p>

<p>"Belfort, and his ragged remnants," he murmured. "There was to
have been a council to-night. I have a press of business; much to
do."</p>

<p>"You had," replied Hensdorff; "but now..."

<p>Christian pushed aside the glass of brandy with a gesture of
disgust.</p>

<p>"I am certainly ill," he said; "but I must command
myself...that would be a pitiful thing, would it not, Count, if I
could not command myself?"</p>

<p>"Will you," asked Hensdorff, fearfully, "leave us all to
destruction?"</p>

<p>"Destruction?" repeated Christian, faintly. "It is I who am
destroyed."</p>

<p>"He who is captain of himself," said Hensdorff, "is never
vanquished...I would ask no pity: only this: if you would tell me
what you mean to do?"</p>

<p>Christian put his hand to his forehead, as if he endeavoured
to ease an intolerable pain.</p>

<p>"What," he asked, "do you think that I shall do?"</p>

<p>"God help us," responded the older man, sullenly; "I think you
will deliver us all to the enemy."</p>

<p>Christian did not answer. Thick, grey darkness had fallen over
the room. They could hardly distinguish each other's faces. From
the window the lights of the town began to show in small
crescents of brightness.</p>

<p>"I must," came Christian's voice out of this increasing inner
gloom, "I must have some time to myself. Come to me again in the
morning."</p>

<p>Hensdorff could say no more; he also was utterly fatigued. He
would have wept, had he not been old and tears too difficult. He
made his way feebly to the door; and there, he did pause and
say:</p>

<p>"If you leave him, I will follow you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he peered back into the twilit darkness; and he
could just discern Christian's brilliant figure bent low over the
table, his face in his hands; and, for fear that the soldier
wept, Hensdorff left the room hastily, closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p>Distant and conflicting strains of music travelled the heavy
winter air; and, high above the low brown fog and mist, sparkled
a few pallid stars. Long practice enabled Hensdorff to assume the
appearance of his accustomed fortitude. He found his servant
waiting for him among the pavilions. The fellow told him that he
had secured lodgings in the inn.</p>

<p>As Hensdorff made his way there, he passed Belfort's weary
cavalry, coming in gloomily and dispiritedly from their
defeat.</p>

<p>He could not bring himself to visit De Lisle, or any of the
other generals. He felt that everything, their very existence,
was in Christian's hands, and that he himself, by not so much as
a raised finger, could do anything to influence Christian...or
would have done so if he could.</p>

<p>He waited, therefore, in his alien lodgings; shaken to the
heart&mdash;an old and shattered man. As the hours went by, he
heard no news, and no one came to wait upon him. Only, he could
distinguish through the confused noises of the night the tramp of
soldiers entering the town; music, and shouting, and the
lamentations...</p>

<p>At length, unable any longer to endure the suspense, he sent
his servant to Prince Christian's headquarters to
ask...anything...news...what the Generalissimo did...if he held
his council...any scrap of information that might be
available.</p>

<p>After an hour or so, the man returned. There was no council to
be held to-night, though all the generals had gathered at
headquarters, including Belfort, with his tale of disaster.</p>

<p>Christian was ill: he had been stricken clown by some fit, or
seizure. He lay now, half unconscious, attended by doctors and
surgeons. Every one was lost, distracted, filled by a sense of
unutterable misfortune. No one, added the messenger, could guess
the cause of the Generalissimo's sudden illness, for hitherto he
had shown an unconquerable health, never being affected by the
maladies and discomforts that prostrated so many of the
others.</p>

<p>"He has not," murmured Count Hensdorff, "sent for me?"</p>

<p>But the man said no, Prince Christian had sent for no one. The
doctors described him as lying with locked lips. It was whispered
among his <i>entourage</i> that once, when he had been left alone
for a moment, he had risen and beaten his head against the wall,
as if he desired to dash out his brains, and only been restrained
by the instant reappearance of the doctors.</p>

<p>They had bled him twice, but had been unable to induce him to
swallow any medicine.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff groaned. He thought of Leopold as a murderer:
a cowardly murderer who stabbed in the back and in the dark. He
would have liked to enquire about the fate of Ferdinand Gabor,
but dared not do so for fear of attracting attention to the
Transylvanian and possibly connecting his interview with the
collapse of Christian. He hoped that the Transylvanian was safely
secured somewhere&mdash;gagged and bound in the dark; but even if
this were so, he knew that he was not suffering so acutely as the
man whom he had just struck down. And most passionately did
Hensdorff hope that Gabor would never come to learn of the swift
success of his atrocious deed.</p>

<p>The minister could not eat or rest or sleep. Continuously,
throughout the night, he sent for news of Christian; and when the
news came it was always the same: Christian lay on the farmhouse
bed, deprived of all his senses, while his staff and his
subordinates came and went, and gossiped and chattered and
speculated and wondered; and in everything they did and said,
expressed an infinite dismay. They were all like men delivered to
the enemy, for news had come that the Allies were advancing, now
strong enough not to need to wait, but to be able to offer battle
in their turn.</p>

<p>Hensdorff asked if he could see Christian, but the doctors
refused to allow him into the small, ill-ventilated chamber. The
next dawn came, and the next noonday, and there was no change.
The surgeons spoke of some unimaginable shock, and whispered that
surely Prince Christian would lose either his life or his reason.
Cavalry patrols reached the little town to say that the Emperor
was only a few hours away. Half the generals said that if he was
to take Prince Christian's place as actual Commander-in-Chief of
the forces they would not fight: so accurately did they value his
incapacity, his indecision and his lack of experience.</p>

<p>The evening of that same day, Hensdorff, agonizing in his
wretched inn, was sent for by Prince Christian.</p>

<p>"His Highness is conscious, and requests your immediate
attendance," the anxious and amazed messenger said.</p>

<p>Hensdorff set out trembling, not knowing if he was going to
meet a dying man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">HENSDORFF moved wearily through streets crowded
with soldiery, one interlaced confusion and entwined clamour
after another in the progress of the old, fatigued man.</p>

<p>It had been raining heavily through all the long winter day,
and everything was befouled with mire. When Hensdorff saw the
twin standards of Kurland and Hapsburg still above the farm where
Christian lay, he felt an odd pang of secret amaze. These flags
did not flaunt boldly now, but hung limply in the heavy air, wet,
to the poles. All the outbuildings and the pavilions overflowed
with a press of people; Hensdorff caught sullen and indignant
murmurs: the complaints of those surprised by the heavy hand of
fate. Maréchal De Lisle himself, haggard and exhausted from
continuous fever, had dragged himself here, but without result;
he and all others had had to return without news. But the doctor,
who met Hensdorff in the little, overcrowded kitchen, said that
Christian had partly recovered, and wished to speak to him, Count
Hensdorff, and to no other.</p>

<p>The old man bowed silently: he believed that Christian had
come to a decision, and he could scarcely doubt what that
decision would be. Certainly he could not, if it was what he
thought it would be, question it.</p>

<p>With reluctant valiancy he mounted to Christian's room, which
was in the front of the house and overlooking the little
courtyard now filled with the pavilions: the best chamber of the
modest country mansion. The cumbrous furniture had been removed,
and replaced by Christian's camp equipment.</p>

<p>The room was lit by a candle, shaded by a pile of books that
stood on a side table. Christian lay on an iron bedstead drawn
near the stove. Heaped negligently on a chair were the splendours
which he had worn when Hensdorff had last seen him&mdash;the
field-marshal's uniform, all the bravery of collars and stars,
the glitter of The Golden Fleece and the sumptuously hilted
sword.</p>

<p>He was slightly propped up in his bed, a carelessly folded
military cloak serving as a pillow.</p>

<p>Hensdorff, forced to approach and look at him, was thankful
for the obscurity of the half light. Christian had changed
now...Gabor would not have been disappointed in his work if he
could have seen him as he was now, lying against that rough cloak
and staring up at Hensdorff. He had lost entirely that smooth
look of buoyant and untroubled youth, and seemed a man of middle
age. He was unshaven, and this emphasized both his Southern
darkness and his extreme bloodlessness. Even his lips were
without colour. He lay in a slack attitude of exhaustion. Both
his arms were bandaged where he had been bled. Over his
disarranged shirt was flung a white, quilted bedgown.</p>

<p>He motioned to Hensdorff to approach him more closely, and
when the minister did so, he said, in a low, hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>"I have not been well."</p>

<p>"It was a blow," replied Hensdorff, looking away, "before
which any man might go down. I am thankful, Monseigneur, that you
have made some recovery."</p>

<p>"I think I have been dead for many hours," said Christian,
curiously, "and visited purgatory and hell. It is strange," he
added, faintly, "to have returned."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was at a loss as to how to conduct his speech. He
did not know even if the man lying in front of him was in full
possession of his senses. He was tormented by a most poignant
pity, and a most acrid remorse.</p>

<p>Christian raised himself on one elbow, and peered round the
room, which was so dim and so full of fleeting shadows. Hensdorff
was doubtful if he recalled his own tragedy: but Christian's next
words proved that this doubt was wrong.</p>

<p>"They have brought me down at last, Hensdorff!" he said. "I
have become their quarry in the end! They've hunted me finely all
my life, have they not? And now they've got me by the
throat&mdash;got me down, eh?"</p>

<p>It had not occurred to Hensdorff that what had happened to him
would present itself to him in this light; but now he could
understand that it would do so, and Christian added, in the same
quiet tone:</p>

<p>"He would never have dared to do it, Count, had my mother not
been what he has now made her."</p>

<p>Michael Hensdorff dared to say:</p>

<p>"I do not credit he thought of that."</p>

<p>Christian did not reply to this, but muttered:</p>

<p>"There seems to be a great deal of noise in the town&mdash;all
day I have heard nothing but noise, and people coming and
going."</p>

<p>"They are in a confusion," admitted Hensdorff, sadly. "They
wait for you: even De Lisle has dragged himself from his bed to
see if you will take matters up again. We are all in your
hands."</p>

<p>"So many looking to me?" murmured Christian, faintly. "That's
odd, isn't it, Count&mdash;odd indeed, looking to me, who could
not save the one thing I wanted for myself."</p>

<p>"Why did you send for me?" asked the old man, heavily, braced
to meet the most terrible of news, the most dire of
disasters.</p>

<p>"There is no one else who knows," replied Christian,
simply.</p>

<p>And then Hensdorff whispered:</p>

<p>"What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>"What was his part in it?" asked Christian. "I've
wondered."</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;Leopold will not speak. I believe the
Transylvanian engineered evil from the first."</p>

<p>Christian asked softly:</p>

<p>"Was his story true, in that he found her&mdash;in that he
discovered them as he said? Was that true&mdash;that she gave him
those diamonds: do you know if that is true? Or did he come by
them through other means?"</p>

<p>And Hensdorff answered:</p>

<p>"I believe, from what Leopold said, that it is true."</p>

<p>"Then," said Christian, "he must never speak again. Yet what
is he to my concern? I did not bring you here to speak of
him."</p>

<p>Christian now sat up in bed, and stretched himself with
something of his accustomed vigour.</p>

<p>"See, Count Hensdorff," he said, "I have been sick, but now I
am recovered. One can, it seems, endure much unutterable torment,
and yet live. The air is heavy: will you not open one of the
windows?"</p>

<p>"It rains," said Hensdorff, "and the night wind is
rising."</p>

<p>"Still," insisted Christian, "open one of the windows."</p>

<p>Hensdorff obeyed, pulling back the modest serge curtains and
opening the humble casement. The night air, cold and damp, that
surged in guttered the guarded candle, and Hensdorff snuffed it
mechanically.</p>

<p>"When does your Emperor arrive at Limburg?" asked
Christian.</p>

<p>And Hensdorff, without looking at him, as if absorbed in the
candle-snuffing, replied:</p>

<p>"I have had his patrols to-day. He should be here
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Will he review the troops?" asked Christian. And Hensdorff
said:</p>

<p>"Is it your wish that he should review the troops?" And
Christian replied:</p>

<p>"Let him come to the parade-ground at the appointed time."</p>

<p>Hensdorff, forced by his own fears to demand the question he
dared not ask, said, in shivering accents:</p>

<p>"What is your decision?"</p>

<p>"Let no one ask me my decision," replied Christian, "nor speak
to me of my affairs. Love and hate each has a
captain&mdash;honour leads them both." He propped his dark face
in his hands, and added: "Why does your Emperor come? By what
inducements have you brought him here?"</p>

<p>"He is led by his usual reason&mdash;fear!" said Hensdorff,
scornfully. "He is afraid to stay away. He does not think you
know."</p>

<p>"Leave him," smiled Christian, faintly, "in that ignorance.
And Pons is dead! I lost a faithful servant there...And yet, I do
not think he loved me, Hensdorff."</p>

<p>Hensdorff had not thought so either. He recalled the pompous
little soldier, with the bright, bulging blue eyes, the purple
cheeks and crescent-shaped mouth, who had often grumbled at his
master&mdash;even mocked at him; made complaints of his service,
and yet, when he had failed him, had taken his own life with no
hesitation.</p>

<p>"One thing other I wish to ask you," continued Christian's
low, soft voice: "Where is the Duchess?"</p>

<p>"She has left Ottenheim," replied Hensdorff, with difficulty.
"She left it the day of my departure. She has returned to
Dürsheim."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Christian; "and her reason?"</p>

<p>"She said," continued Hensdorff, "that there was no longer any
occasion for her presence at Ottenheim. The motive of her staying
there was gone."</p>

<p>"She has," said Christian, "nothing left to guard." Then he
added, faintly: "The&mdash;the other woman must feel very
lonely." And as he said this he smiled in a fashion that
Hensdorff could scarcely endure to behold.</p>

<p>"Worse than lonely, I think," he ventured; "it is, after all,
but a child."</p>

<p>Christian interrupted him with breathless haste:</p>

<p>"If I am to keep my senses I must not hear that name..."</p>

<p>Hensdorff remarked, abruptly:</p>

<p>"The Allies advance. They are not so many leagues from
Limburg, and we totally unprepared."</p>

<p>"They would make a good bargain with me," whispered Christian,
"for betraying the lot of you into their hands, and I should be
well paid, even if they gave me nothing&mdash;eh, Hensdorff?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," murmured the old man, "remind you of a promise he
has so foully broken; nor of the many dependent on your word and
trusting in your fidelity."</p>

<p>"Remind me of nothing!" replied Christian. "I have never
framed my actions from the words of other men. Give me till
to-morrow morning; then meet me with your Emperor on the
parade-ground. To-morrow there is a council meeting, at eight
o'clock. I do not require your presence there."</p>

<p>"We are helpless," said Hensdorff. "He and I and all of us who
rely on you&mdash;helpless."</p>

<p>"Helpless!" echoed Christian; "all of us, helpless, Count: in
the hands of the gods."</p>

<p>Hensdorff shrugged his bent and weary shoulders.</p>

<p>"The gods are dead, I think," he answered, scornfully.</p>

<p>"But fame remains," whispered Christian. "I read that
somewhere: 'The gods must die, but fame and honour,' Count,
'remain.'" He moved restlessly on his narrow bed. "They must give
me something to keep me awake to-night. I would not dream again
as I have dreamt these last few hours; or be where I have been,
if dream it was not. A sick man's fancies, Count, are odious
things. A thousand swarming devils have been within these
walls&mdash;and all mocked at me."</p>

<p>"But," protested Hensdorff, "mocked, Monseigneur, is not the
word!"</p>

<p>"Ay, they mocked at me!" repeated Christian, "saying again and
again, an endless chorus, Count, 'Fool! fool! who for that pretty
piece staked everything&mdash;won her and put her aside with such
nicety, leaving her for another.'"</p>

<p>The night wind stirred through the room in a long gusty sigh.
The sound of trumpets came from the dark distance; clangour and
shout and murmur mingled with that music.</p>

<p>"De Lisle is very broken," remarked Hensdorff. "He means, if
Your Highness does not recover, to make some stand himself for
the glory of France&mdash;though knowing it will be hopeless
enough."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for De Lisle," replied Christian, simply. "He does
his duty."</p>

<p>"And you'll do yours, no doubt, Monseigneur," replied
Hensdorff. "May I ask what it will be?"</p>

<p>"That word," said Christian, "bears no double interpretation.
Duty has but one meaning, Count."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was troubled both by these words and by the tone in
which they were spoken.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," he asked, with a sort of passionate
curiosity, "is it possible that Your Highness would have the
strength to go on&mdash;to carry out your part?"</p>

<p>"Strength has a mocking sound to me," smiled Christian,
mournfully; "you see before you, Count Hensdorff, a weak and
feeble man. Never will you again behold one so utterly defeated
as I."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Hensdorff, "one, I think, so unconquerable."
Christian did not answer this, though the faintest look of irony
passed over his colourless face.</p>

<p>"Tell them to come in to me," he said; "and meet me to-morrow
at ten o'clock on the parade ground, Count Hensdorff: the Champ
de Mars, which is outside the town, before the woods&mdash;that
is the rendezvous that I have chosen."</p>

<p>"He means to play us all false," thought Hensdorff, wearily;
"and who can call him wrong for that?"</p>

<p>"Faugh!" cried Christian, suddenly, "this air is stale and
stifling. Set open the other window, Count, before you go..."</p>

<p>Hensdorff did as he was asked, feeling within himself a
certain relief from the sudden inrush of the rain and wind; even
a sudden relief in the hearing of the noises from
without&mdash;normal, human noises, that bespoke life flowing on
even past this tragedy; life continuing, even after these
events.</p>

<p>He heard Christian speaking, in a voice that was nearly at its
usual level of serenity:</p>

<p>"Whatever happens, Count&mdash;remember I bear you no ill
will..."</p>

<p>Hensdorff turned, and with pain and apprehension looked at
him, where he sat leaning forward in his bed, propping his face
upon his hands, with the long, dark hair, in which the neglected
pomade and powder still clung, hanging down his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Gabor would he glutted," thought the old man, furiously, "if
he could see him now!"</p>

<p>"Good night," said Christian; and Hensdorff replied,
gravely:</p>

<p>"I wish Your Highness a good night," and left him, pausing in
the antechamber to do as he had been asked to do: to send his
people in to him; but to all their importunate questions as to
the mood, manner and intention of their master, he would answer
nothing.</p>

<p>As he crossed the courtyard, he had the curiosity to look up
at the two flags waving from the wet roof; he wondered if
Christian realized that they both still hung there&mdash;and how
long one of them would remain when he had once gone abroad and
observed them again.</p>

<p>Hensdorff returned wearily to his inn, as he had come from
it&mdash;wearily. The hostelry was now crowded with French
officers; Hensdorff avoided all of them, and in his humble room
found at last the sleep of fatigue&mdash;almost the sleep of
exhausted despair.</p>

<p>He was roused when it was full daylight, by his secretary
coming to his bedside and saying that the Emperor had arrived;
and with that name, the whole sick train of horrible events came
back to the old man's mind and unnerved him. He felt, for one
dreadful second, that he could not face Leopold&mdash;not after
having seen Christian yesterday...And he was debating and
struggling with himself while the secretary delivered his
message, which was a summons from Leopold, who had taken up a
hasty residence in the evacuated Town Hall.</p>

<p>"Is he well?" asked Hensdorff, dully; and the secretary
replied that His Majesty appeared to be very well, though he had,
in his haste and pressure to arrive at the headquarters, been
riding through most of the night, first in a coach and then on
horseback.</p>

<p>"I wish," muttered Hensdorff, inaudibly, "that he had ridden
to the devil."</p>

<p>But he rose, put on his sober habit, and, accompanied by his
secretary and the messenger from Leopold, went to the Town Hall,
above which the Hapsburg flag had been raised at a flaunting
height.</p>

<p>Leopold received him in a hastily adjusted apartment. The
Emperor was wearing his travelling clothes, but two valets were
already setting out his uniform upon the chair.</p>

<p>"I was received by De Lisle," he began, at once, in nervous
tones, "who told me I am to review the troops at ten o'clock.
Prince Christian was not there."</p>

<p>"He told me," said Hensdorff, carefully, "that he would be on
the parade ground."</p>

<p>Leopold began.</p>

<p>"Is he...has he..."</p>

<p>He glanced at the valets, and the words faltered and failed
upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty must ask me nothing," said Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"Well, I have come!" cried Leopold, petulantly. "You asked me
to come&mdash;you forced me to come&mdash;and now you do not seem
pleased when I am here. Good God! how intolerable is my position!
How even more bitter do you make it!"</p>

<p>"We are none of us," smiled Hensdorff, sourly, "so comfortable
that Your Majesty need envy us."</p>

<p>With difficulty he brought himself to look at Leopold, as
yesterday he had with difficulty brought himself to look at
Christian. Never again could he regard either of these men with
equanimity.</p>

<p>Leopold appeared agitated almost beyond concealment. His bloom
was gone, and his dark eyes looked dim and faded, the blue
brightness faded. He was so perpetually biting his already full
under lip that it had become permanently swollen, and gave a
fantastic look to his face, on which his natural melancholy was
most grievously accentuated.</p>

<p>"De Lisle is a sick man!" he exclaimed, hurriedly, "and I hear
that the enemy mean to attack us. Everything appears in
confusion: what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Hensdorff, stiffly, "I have asked you to
demand nothing of me, for my lips are sealed."</p>

<p>Leopold nervously pressed his handkerchief to his marred
mouth.</p>

<p>"De Lisle told me," he said, and his voice choked and stifled
in his throat, "that Prince Christian had been ill,
also&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had a fit or seizure," replied Hensdorff, coldly; "but he
is something recovered. I saw him yesterday, and he seemed in
full command of himself. I think Your Majesty will find him on
the parade ground to-day."

<p>But in his heart, Hensdorff did not believe his own words. He
did not conceive that Christian could possibly be on that parade
ground by ten o'clock, with the strength to face the Emperor.
Such a feat of self-domination seemed to him impossible. He would
not have been amazed if he had learnt that Christian had ridden
over to the Allied camp during the night; or, on the other hand,
that he was again too ill to leave his bed. And, thinking of the
suffering of Christian, Hensdorff looked most bitterly at the
young man before him, in no way softened by the obvious fact that
Leopold had suffered also.</p>

<p>"Why do you stare at me?" cried Leopold, nervously. "You made
me come&mdash;well, I am here."</p>

<p>"God give the day a good ending!" murmured Hensdorff.

<p>Leopold drew him into the window-place, where they were out of
sight and of earshot of the valets.</p>

<p>"Does he know?" he whispered, breathlessly.</p>

<p>And Hensdorff replied with an abrupt evasion.</p>

<p>"Would it be likely that he would be here if he knew?" he
answered. "Would it be possible for him to meet you to-day on the
parade ground?"</p>

<p>And, with a trembling sigh, half of relief and half of fear,
Leopold replied:</p>

<p>"No; it would not be possible. But this illness?"</p>

<p>"Has he not permission to be ill, like other men?" replied
Hensdorff, gruffly. "He has had much work to do, and little
support." And he added, not being, indeed, able to bear further
converse on the matter: "We will meet, Sire, after the
review."</p>

<p>He left the Emperor, and took his little hired carriage to the
parade ground outside the town.</p>

<p>There was no longer any rain, and most of the heavy clouds had
blown away; but the sun looked old and sullen in a sky that was
bleak for all its faint blue.</p>

<p>"He will not be there!" muttered Hensdorff, to himself. "No;
it is not possible that he will be there. And, God in Heaven!
what are we going to do?" And he added to himself: "If I were a
younger man, I would ride after him wherever he had gone."</p>

<p>When he arrived at the plain where the troops were to be
reviewed, he found masses of soldiery already in place, although
it was not more than half past nine. Most of the French were
there, and De Lisle was present, in a light basket carriage;
Hensdorff took up his place beside him.</p>

<p>Neither of them mentioned Christian, but talked indifferently
of the lesser events of the moment.</p>

<p>Leopold and his escort arrived, for once, more than
punctually, and he took up his place with the Electors, Princes
and Generals under a group of gaunt trees that fringed a large
pool, where the rain lingered in sullen, stagnant greyness.
Bedizened and beplumed, Leopold made no such ill figure. It
seemed scarcely credible to Hensdorff that this was the man who
had staggered into Bosenberg, that dreadful night not so many
nights ago.</p>

<p>Leopold turned this way and that, with great animation,
talking quickly with false gaiety; his affability had now become
mechanical, and almost exercised without his own volition.</p>

<p>"Christian will not come," Hensdorff kept saying to himself in
a light refrain. "And then what will he do? What will any of us
do?"</p>

<p>"It is the first time," smiled De Lisle, regretfully, "that I
have been at a review and not on horseback."</p>

<p>"I fear, Monseigneur," replied Hensdorff, "that we are both
old men..."</p>

<p>"I certainly begin to feel," responded De Lisle, "that this is
a barbarous fashion in which to pass the winter! I wish you would
get, my dear Count, your Emperor firmly fixed upon his throne, so
that I could return to Paris."</p>

<p>The troops poured into the open field, square after square,
battalion after battalion, regiment after regiment.</p>

<p>"By now," mused Hensdorff, "I suppose he is at the Allies'
headquarters, with all our plans in his hands. They will give
him, no doubt, a very splendid welcome."

<p>Devoid of hope, and almost of emotion, he gazed dully at the
monotonous pageant before him; the sky began to cloud over, and
the gloomy sun was veiled by yet gloomier vapours; he heard an
officer behind them comment: "Prince Christian is late."</p>

<p>But De Lisle answered:</p>

<p>"No; he is never late. You will find he is here, punctually to
the moment."</p>

<p>"No doubt," thought Hensdorff, ironically, "he will be
punctual to another appointment..." And he wished, now, that he
had had the courage, before coming to the parade ground, to go to
Christian's headquarters and discover if he was yet there. But he
had purposely avoided this, and winced from hearing any news
whatever of the movements of Christian; nor had any one mentioned
anything to him. Whatever the Generalissimo had done, it must
have been done privately; for no one seemed to have a breath of
suspicion of what was likely to happen.</p>

<p>The squat church of the little town chimed the thin,
melancholy tune of an old Lutheran hymn, and then struck ten.</p>

<p>"Here," exclaimed De Lisle, with satisfaction, "he is:
punctual to the moment, as I said."</p>

<p>Startled, Hensdorff leapt from his carriage and gazed across
the parade ground. A sparkling and glittering cavalcade was
sweeping into the field. It was Christian and his Uhlans;
punctual to the second.</p>

<p>He rode directly up to the Emperor, and, with a profound
salute, took his place beside him. He was near enough for
Hensdorff to observe him closely. He bore no trace of his illness
or collapse, but had achieved again his precise and accurate
splendour. Shaved, powdered, adorned with all his adornments, he
sat his great white horse, immovable and unmoved by any emotion
whatsoever, as far as Hensdorff could observe. The Golden Fleece
which sparkled, even in this dull winter light, lay on a tranquil
bosom. He wore the uniform of Austria and carried the baton with
the Imperial Eagle.</p>

<p>Hensdorff observed Leopold glance at him wildly, and laugh
nervously at some insipid jest that one of the officers behind
him uttered. Fascinated, Hensdorff continued to peer and stare at
Christian, whose dark countenance, as ever composed and serene,
gave no indication of two days' agony&mdash;of an ever-present,
continuous and atrocious agony which he must be enduring now. He
even smiled, and his glance travelled over Leopold with a
complete steadiness.</p>

<p>"Will he," trembled Hensdorff, "defy him to his face?"</p>

<p>At this moment, Christian observed De Lisle, and saluted him
profoundly, bowing low from his saddle.</p>

<p>Then he rode to the head of his Uhlans, who had halted a few
paces from the Emperor, and drew his sword and held it for a
second aloft. It seemed to Hensdorff that he bore the Imperial
Diadem at the point of that same sword; and, as he flourished his
weapon, he cried, in a voice that was heard and echoed by
thousands of throats:</p>

<p>"Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">AS the Imperial cavalcade left the parade
ground, Leopold was forced to motion to Christian to come
alongside his horse. He should have thanked him for the
appearance and efficiency of the troops, and passed some formal
compliments; but he was quite incapable of doing this. Then he
asked:</p>

<p>"Do we march at once, Prince?"</p>

<p>Christian replied, without looking at him:</p>

<p>"Limburg is an open and an undefended town. I intend to march
at once, and meet the enemy before he marches to meet me."</p>

<p>"The season is rigorous," replied Leopold, mechanically, "and
many officers have declared aversion to a sudden
movement&mdash;indeed, to any further action this winter."</p>

<p>"Despite that," said Christian, "I shall advance."</p>

<p>He turned slightly in his saddle and stared at Leopold. At
that look, Leopold blenched and started, so that his nervous
horse curvetted out of the line of march. "Before we leave
Limburg," added Christian, "there is a detail to which I would
beg the attention of Your Majesty." Then he asked, in an
indifferent voice: "Has Your Majesty convoked the Diet for
Frankfurt?"</p>

<p>And Leopold said:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;for the first of February." And nervously he
continued to speak of the progress of the war, and politics;
saying that four thousand troops were coming up from Italy to
help Christian; and that they were old and able soldiers. He also
said that he could spare more men from Hungary, where for the
moment the Turkish campaign languished.</p>

<p>"I have," replied Christian, "sufficient men for the service I
have undertaken."</p>

<p>And Leopold was uneasily silent.</p>

<p>The vanguard, and the greater part of the French troops, were
now marching out of the town; but Christian desired the Emperor
to turn aside with him into a field outside the walls; and
Leopold dared not refuse.</p>

<p>"There is," remarked Christian, "something to be done; and I
wish Your Majesty to see it done."</p>

<p>They had with them an escort of Uhlans and Dragoons, and when
they reached the flat, damp, bleak and barren winter field they
found a small troop of Croatians there, who held in the midst a
prisoner in civilian clothes. His arms were bound, and he was
guarded by four musketeers.</p>

<p>"This is a traitor who has been brought here to die," said
Christian.</p>

<p>"Why must I behold him die?" cried Leopold, shuddering to his
heart.</p>

<p>"I think Your Majesty knows the man," replied Christian,
serenely; "and it is well that you should see the end to which he
comes..."</p>

<p>Leopold stared with horror at the prisoner. He did not
immediately recognize that tall, spare figure in the black attire
without peruke or hat, which might have been that of a tutor, a
scholar or even a Lutheran parson. The lower part of this man's
face was tightly bandaged, and there was little visible of his
countenance but his vivid and menacing eyes beneath a creased and
lowering forehead.</p>

<p>"Is he wounded?" breathed the Emperor, biting his lip.

<p>Christian replied:</p>

<p>"He is gagged."</p>

<p>Leopold knew the prisoner now: it was Gabor, the Transylvanian
spy, whom he had last seen in that fell moment in that bitter
dawn in Eleanora's bedchamber; that slim and sinister figure with
the tongue of gall!</p>

<p>"What has he done?" whispered Leopold, in lively horror; and
even the presence of his escort could scarcely restrain him from
open betrayal of himself...but Christian answered so calmly that
he was reassured, and in his throb of relief contrived to command
his jangling nerves.</p>

<p>"The man is a traitor," said General Crack without passion.
"He has betrayed his trust; a spy, who strove to serve both
sides, Sire&mdash;yet served nothing but his own malice."</p>

<p>"Why is he gagged?" demanded Leopold.</p>

<p>"He is gagged because his last words were so foul that he
shall have no opportunity to repeat them."</p>

<p>Leopold was bewildered with terror. In his chill heart he
thought: "Gabor has betrayed us, Gabor has sold us, Christian
knows!" Yet, immediately on this, came the other reflection: "How
could I live, if he knew? No, it is impossible! Gabor has been
discovered in some other treachery, and so, when they kill him,
we shall be safe." And yet he could not endure to watch this
sordid execution.</p>

<p>"Must I stay?" he asked Christian. "What importance is there
in this punishment of a spy and traitor?"</p>

<p>"Ferdinand Gabor was of some distinction," responded
Christian, "and once in my employment."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he made a signal to the officer who was in charge
of the Croatians, and the prisoner was led by the musketeers
across the russet fallows of field and down to one of the bare
winter trees that had straggled from a dark little wood that
coloured the close horizon; a pine tree that yet bore some dark
and funereal plumes of foliage.</p>

<p>"Will you not allow him a priest?" asked Leopold.</p>

<p>"He shall not open his lips this side Hell," replied
Christian. "When the gag falls out of his mouth it will be
because his face has rotted behind it&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Gabor had been led past the little group of horsemen,
Christian had turned to the Emperor and spoken to him with
deference and affability, smiling upon him as if he delighted in
his company, and was eager for his praise. This would be the last
sight Gabor saw&mdash;these two gorgeous horsemen, in amiable
converse...Christian knew that this would be a harder punishment
even than his infamous death; for he would see that he had failed
in his choice and careful scheme of vindictive revenge;
Christian's pride, not his hate would have proved the more mighty
passion.</p>

<p>But Leopold was confused with fright and apprehension;
although the death of Gabor was wholly in his interest, and, to
his thinking, a most fortunate coincidence, still he could not
endure to witness the execution: to see the bound, gagged man,
with those vivid, ferocious and sparkling eyes threatening all
malice and contempt, dragged past and bound to the bare
tree...lashed there with brutal swiftness.</p>

<p>The file of musketeers took up their position. Leopold turned
away his head; he was hardly able to hold his reins. He sensed
that there was something terrible in his being brought to witness
this horror; and yet always there was the ghastly comfort that
Christian could not know! If he knew, then he, Leopold, the
Emperor, would not be there, alive...had not this man acclaimed
him, an hour before on the parade ground?</p>

<p>He heard the rattle of shots, and the bullets seemed to come
near his own stifling heart...He dared to look round with
dreadful apprehension, and saw the smoke clearing away from the
sodden earth, and the dark, hard twisted outline of the tree, and
the dark, slim figure hanging limply in the bonds.</p>

<p>The musketeers proceeded to dig a grave at the edge of the
field and bury the traitor where he had fallen.</p>

<p>"Now we can go," said Christian. "They will bury him with the
gag still in his mouth."</p>

<p>"What could he have said that you so fear?" whispered Leopold,
staring across the field at the huddled shape of the dead
man.</p>

<p>"Nothing that I fear," replied Christian; "but there are some
words which must be the last that any man can say. And he, Sire,
spoke them&mdash;so he purges himself of a gross treachery that
could no other way be cancelled."</p>

<p>The Emperor turned his restive horse. He should have been
pleased, gratified, relieved; this meant safety for her and him.
Gabor was silenced: who else was there to speak?</p>

<p>Many in Ottenheim and Bosenberg knew, such inexperienced fools
had they been! Still, now Gabor was dead, there was no one who
would speak. Yet he could not feel reassured by this death that
he had been forced to witness, but was only further enmeshed in a
deeper doubt and a more sombre horror.</p>

<p>As they cantered away from the hoar field side by side,
Christian remarked:</p>

<p>"Has Your Majesty heard that Colonel Pons is dead?" And
Leopold, lying in fear, replied:</p>

<p>"No, Prince, I had not heard!"</p>

<p>"He was found in my park at Ottenheim," said Christian. "An
accident, no doubt: I am sorry for it&mdash;he was a good and a
faithful soldier."</p>

<p>"I, too, am sorry," said Leopold, under his breath; and he
wondered, in agony, how Christian had heard that news. If he was
aware of the death of Colonel Pons, he must be aware of some
other events that had taken place at Ottenheim...but Leopold
dared say nothing more, nor in any way to put his fate to the
touch. Still, like a refrain, beat in his tormented mind: "It is
impossible that he should know! It is impossible that he should
know!" And the sound fell into the monotonous rhythm of his
horse's hoofs as he galloped beside Christian through the foul
streets of Limburg.</p>

<p>The gloomy clouds covered the sun, which was to be seen no
more that day; and a little icy rain fell, which soon turned into
snow. Despite this inclemency and the murmurs of many of the
princes and generals, Christian pressed forward with his entire
force towards the encampment of the Allies.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Baden had come up with some fresh troops. Even
with these welcome reinforcements, Christian knew himself greatly
inferior to the enemy, who also had this immense advantage, that,
superior in cavalry, they had been able to forage the country for
leagues around, and secure all the available provisions; whereas
the Imperialists were daily more short of food, and had been four
days on limited rations.</p>

<p>By midday Christian received news that the enemy were but two
leagues away, and that they had passed the river Lahn on pontoons
with a large corps of Hanoverians; and lower down, by other
bridges, a considerable number of infantry had left their
encampment and were prepared to oppose the progress of the
Imperialists.</p>

<p>Christian had hoped to reach the river before the enemy passed
it, and, had it not been for his illness, would have done so. He
had now to make good what was to him this great disadvantage.</p>

<p>At this disconcerting intelligence several of the generals
showed open discontent, and murmured that they had been led into
a trap. "We are lost," cried one, "without the drawing of a
sword."</p>

<p>"The sword is not drawn yet," Christian reminded them.</p>

<p>He halted, and sent out scouts to reconnoitre the position,
himself riding over much of the ground, which here rose to gentle
hillocks encompassing the valley and gave through the glasses a
fair survey of the enemy.</p>

<p>He then disposed his troops, sending the regiments of Baden
and Pomerania ahead to hold the banks of the river against the
further crossing of the Allies, and arranged an attack in concert
with the other generals, many of whom, however, did not wish an
engagement; several of them had already abandoned the march, and
were sending their baggage wagons and their artillery to a place
of safety. Christian, riding beside the Emperor, who was wrapped
in his cloak against the snow, and silent in moody gloom, asked
ironically:</p>

<p>"As you cannot escape, why not fight? Laurel or cypress for us
to-day, gentlemen! Triumph or the tomb! To conquer or to die! The
usual soldier's choice, I think."</p>

<p>"We are hopelessly outnumbered," protested Knittelfeldt. "We
should have fallen back from Limburg."</p>

<p>"But this," smiled Christian, "is the road to Frankfurt."</p>

<p>The French Maréchals now galloped up, their brilliancy cloaked
against the cold; they were dispirited and reluctant, and awaited
with hostility the orders of the Imperialist
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Christian proposed an instant attack upon the enemy. He had
swiftly secured his outposts and his lines of communication, and
arranged his troops: the regiments of the Emperor, the circle of
the Empire, Lorraine, the French and Hesse Cassel on the right;
the troops of the Empire, and particularly those of the Swabian
circle in the middle; and those of the French cavalry at the
left; and then gave orders for all to march so in a half-moon,
and to address the enemy on the front and by the side with
resolution and vigour.</p>

<p>After these deliberations and orders, the Imperialists threw
themselves on the enemy from all parts and with all their forces,
and with a general cry from all the troops, shouts which rose
higher than the blowing banners and the wintry trees; shouts
which contained, not the name of Leopold, but that of General
Crack...a name which always seemed to swell with presage of
success.</p>

<p>The clash of conflict was instant; the struggle ferocious. The
enemy was soon constrained, not only to abandon his ground, where
he had been entrenched, but even to fly in disorder; the soldiers
began to throw themselves into the river in an effort to save
themselves on the other side; and that with so much confusion and
fright that the Hanoverians, pressing on the narrow bridge,
choked on the pontoons, crowding one against the other, and so
fell into the river, those that were being saved in the battle
being drowned in the Lahn.</p>

<p>General Crack himself had engaged the cavalry of the enemy and
made there a great carnage, the troops that had been hurled
against him had been defeated by the Croatians and the Dragoons
of the Emperor, supporting his own Uhlans. The artillery of the
enemy, which had been set on the other side of the river, and
exposed to the continual fire of the musketeers, was soon
abandoned in disorder; some of the Imperialists, forcing over the
river by the pontoons, closed with the gunners, and reversed both
them and their guns into the ebon water.</p>

<p>The fight was bloody, obstinate, but not doubtful; it lasted
from two o'clock in the afternoon to five o'clock in the evening,
when shot and charge still continued in the solid gloom of the
winter dark.</p>

<p>There were many killed and wounded on one side and the other,
but more losses on the part of the Allies, who lost some of the
flower of their bravest troops, so many being drowned in the icy
depths of the Lahn.</p>

<p>A great number of standards and flags were taken, and there
was a rich booty of baggage and artillery, of money, swords,
horses, rich arms, precious habits and many other such things;
and with the dawn the Imperialists were still drawing the bodies
out of the river, and plundering them of their apparel.</p>

<p>Christian had put his less experienced troops in the centre,
and the older troops, and those on whom he could count the more,
at the wings; and it was to this, and to the intrepid cavalry
charge of the French and his own Uhlans that he owed the day; it
was the first occasion on which he had been surprised at his own
success, for it was the first time that he had fought with cold
deliberation and no exultation in the conflict.</p>

<p>Leopold, who found all inaction intolerably odious, had
himself led the Imperial Guard in one charge after another on to
the earthworks of the enemy.</p>

<p>In the confusion of the bewildering combat, the sombre day,
the incessant snow, he had not for long known how the battle
went, nor even been greatly concerned. The fight to him had
seemed like the flux and reflux of the waves, which surge forward
and fall back turn by turn. Imprinted on his mind and heart
forever was the grey picture of the river, the black wood beyond,
the grey sky beyond that, and the struggling men, the troops,
battalions and squadrons in disorder, pontoons breaking beneath
the load of fugitives, the desecrated woods that seemed to mourn
over the lamentations of human brain, the shouts of human
rage.</p>

<p>Frequently he saw Christian, riding here and there, galloping
backwards and forwards, three horses killed under him; leaving
nothing to chance, exhausting all his resources, all his energy,
all his courage; and for what?</p>

<p>"To put the crown on my head!" thought Leopold, and sickened
in the midst of the slaughter; sickened as passionately as he had
once delighted in the thought of Eleanora.</p>

<p>When the dawn came, the enemy had been completely beaten
across the river, and had fallen backwards still further than the
river, in a complete retreat. They had, however, still thirty
thousand cavalry, absolutely fresh, who had been only spectators
of the combat, it being impossible for them to pass the Lahn.</p>

<p>The Imperialists were exhausted. They had fired the last
rounds of their ammunition; they had very little bread; the
slaughter had been high; the men were fatigued; pursuit was
therefore impossible. Christian, after resting his exhausted
troops a few hours, and allowing them time for plunder, continued
the road to Frankfurt, some regiments of Croatians and Dragoons
being left to watch the enemy and observe his movements.</p>

<p>Christian had from Limburg sent messages to all his scattered
troops for reinforcement, and the day after the battle one of
these arrived, under the conduct of Prince Ulrich of Würtemberg,
with a fine train of artillery, and wagons full of provisions.
Besides the booty, which was considerable, each man received a
month's pay. But Christian, ever pressing forward, found the
great obstacle to his progress was still the lack of bread, and
all manner of forages; other expected convoys had not come up.
Theft, corruption and laziness on the part of those charged with
the Commissariat were responsible for this condition; these
unsupported victories were of little gain.</p>

<p>"You are ill served," said Christian to Leopold; and these
were the only words he had spoken to him since they left Limburg.
"No food, no forages, no munitions, no provisions, no convoys,
commissionaires and the treasurers of the army always absent,
punctilios, jealousies and divisions between your generals! Eh,
Sire, and yet I think I have set you on the throne."</p>

<p>Punctual to his appointment on the first day of February, he
entered the towered streets of Frankfurt, Leopold riding by his
side. The town overflowed with the potentates and princes evoked
by the Emperor to the Diet, and everywhere was an atmosphere of
rejoicing, of festival, and the acclamations of victory.</p>

<p>Christian, who, so hampered that he had been like a man with
his hands tied behind him, had pressed on to Brussels, taken
Brussels, and returned, fought his way through the enemy, and was
now prepared to place the crown on the head of Leopold at
Frankfurt, was the hero of this resplendent gathering. It seemed
to Leopold that he heard nothing but the name and praises of his
Commander-in-Chief. Even those who most detested his advancement,
and were most jealous of his supremacy&mdash;his enemies, in
fact&mdash;spoke of him in terms of tense admiration; everywhere
it was General Crack.</p>

<p>Leopold, lodged at last in the palace at Frankfurt, sent for
Hensdorff, who, with other civilians, had painfully followed the
progress of the victorious army. The snow now lay thick upon the
ground, and fell softly from clouds of sombre greyness, alike on
roofs and spires. Hensdorff passed through rooms filled by
secretaries and the press of business, to that inner chamber
where Leopold sat, alone, writing in his own hand letters with a
feverish haste.</p>

<p>"So, Sire, we arrive here at last!" said Hensdorff, grimly.
"Nor have we been so long upon the road; Prince Christian has
fulfilled his contract to the very letter."</p>

<p>"I have scarcely seen him, and not spoken to him," replied
Leopold, hastily, "but every one shouts for him. I hear of
nothing else. Count, at last I can breathe and think a little;
since we left Limburg I have not had a second; always on the
march, always on the alert."</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not answer.</p>

<p>"What," asked Leopold, desperately, "shall I do?"</p>

<p>"You will be crowned," said Hensdorff, quietly. "Then, I
think, the Allies will make peace. War is over."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Leopold. "And then?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff knew what he wanted to say, and replied: "Sire, the
matter in which you want my assistance is beyond my advice."</p>

<p>"I'll marry her," murmured Leopold, biting his lower lip. "An
embassy to Rome can arrange that."</p>

<p>"That's the reward you'll give him!" smiled Hensdorff, sourly.
"As soon as he has crowned you, you'll steal his wife! That will
be a pretty scandal with which to begin your reign, Sire!"</p>

<p>"But it is unthinkable," replied Leopold, "that I should
<i>not</i> marry her..." But he knew that he spoke from
convention, not from passion.</p>

<p>And Hensdorff, shrugging his bent shoulders, said: "The whole
affair, Sire, has been unthinkable."</p>

<p>"The moment must come when he will know," whispered Leopold;
and then he added, fearfully: "Or do you think it possible so to
gloss it over that he will never know? I have written to her so
often, Hensdorff; but she never writes to me."</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not answer, but stared out at the snow, which
looked so blank and bleak beyond the gold and purple brocade of
the stiff curtains.</p>

<p>"I should like to take her away from Ottenheim," continued
Leopold, in the extreme of uneasy anguish, "or else to send my
sister there. I had thought of that, Hensdorff."</p>

<p>The minister gave an angry exclamation. This suggestion seemed
to him the height of childish folly.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible for Your Majesty to marry this lady,"
he said, briefly. "The scandal of such a wedding would pull your
crown off your head again."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Leopold, in nervous impatience. "What is a
crown to me? It is you and your like, Count&mdash;-all the tribe
of you, ministers and place keepers and soldiers alike, who have
thrust it on me. What do you think these last weeks have been to
me but a stinging torment?" He added, in a fearful whisper: "He
had that Transylvanian shot; gagged and shot. That was horrible,
Hensdorff! Never can I get it from my mind. He made me witness
it. Now, why?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand Prince Christian myself," returned
Hensdorff. "No doubt in time he will explain himself."</p>

<p>"Keep him away from me," cried Leopold, in shuddering
agitation. "I can stand very little more of it. And
Anhalt-Dessau: I saw him in the street to-day. Keep him away
from me, Hensdorff!"</p>

<p>"God give you <i>some</i> courage!" replied the minister,
scornfully. He brought out his wallet, and proceeded to transact
some necessary business. Leopold signed every document that was
put before him, without even glancing at the contents; and a
quiet smile twisted Hensdorff's thin lips.</p>

<p>When these matters were over, and he had risen to take his
leave, he said, carefully:</p>

<p>"There is one other piece of news that I must give to Your
Majesty: the Duchess of Schönbuchel is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead?" muttered Leopold. "She, and Gabor, and Pons&mdash;all
dead? How near death comes to us, Hensdorff! But she was old, was
she not?" he added, anxiously. "This&mdash;this did not kill
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she was old," admitted Hensdorff, drily. "About my age,
Sire. I, too, often feel death very near&mdash;a brush of his
wings across one's face, now and then, to remind one of his
passage. Well, she is dead; and without speaking, as far as I
know. I heard the news yesterday. She died in Dürsheim. These
hard winters kill the old folk, Sire!"</p>

<p>"She cursed me!" shivered Leopold. "I know she died cursing
me&mdash;and that's an ugly thing: two curses, Hensdorff, his and
hers. What did Pons say: 'Blast him to all eternity!'"</p>

<p>"You should not have heard that," replied Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"One does hear," replied Leopold, with a rigid smile. "And
there's another of them, Hensdorff: and what about him&mdash;what
about Christian, when he hears&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"We must not think of that," said Hensdorff.</p>

<p>"And for her," demanded Leopold, passionately; "must we not
think of her? Is there nothing to be said or done there?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff answered, abruptly:</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I wish the snow would cease!" said Leopold, pacing up and
down with restless impatience. "Sometimes it seems to me
unbearable, Hensdorff&mdash;those closed skies and this incessant
snow!"</p>

<p>"Think of your achievements," smiled the old man, drily. "You
are, Sire, at last the Emperor. No mock or demi-Caesar: the
Emperor!"</p>

<p>But Leopold only repeated, in low yet frantic tones: "If some
one would tell me what to do!"</p>

<p>With a shrug and a sigh, Hensdorff left him, and, proceeding
wearily with his two secretaries through the snowy streets, went
to the house where Christian lodged, with many of the French and
Austrian generals: a noble Chateau, overlooking the sluggish
river, and in full view of the dominating church where Leopold
was so soon to be crowned by the Papal Legate.</p>

<p>Christian would not see him; he sent out courteous excuses: he
said that his antechambers were overflowing with a press of
applicants and people on business. He begged Hensdorff to defer
the honour of an interview.</p>

<p>"He evades me," thought the old man; "he does not wish me to
guess his designs or his heart."</p>

<p>How penetrating the cold was! How black the river beneath the
clouded sky! Soft and steady, the snow fell all night.</p>

<p>Hensdorff was kept awake by coughing. He felt old and sick.
Horribly in his thoughts was that girl, wasting and withering at
Ottenheim. What had she heard? What did she know of what had
taken place outside the walls of that gilded palace? And what
place would she find in Prince Christian's final account?</p>

<p>Hensdorff turned, as he had not turned for many years, to the
emblem of suffering and sacrifice. He held his lamp beneath a
crucifix that he had found in his apartment, and gazed at it
long, with eyes dim and bleared with tears and age, while, like a
panic, swept over him the realization of the full horror of this
long-suspended revenge; that Christian, so outraged, so
intolerably wronged, had held his hand and performed his bond
made the prospect of his ultimate vengeance more dreadful.</p>

<p>"How long will he stay his hand?" groaned Hensdorff, like a
prayer. "How long&mdash;how long?"</p>

<p>There was something stupendous and dreadful to Hensdorff in
that long self-control, that complete calm. A man who can so
control himself, he knew, is terrible indeed. And he pondered on
the fate of the Transylvanian spy, as Leopold had told it to him;
and that picture lingered in his mind: a gagged man sent to his
last account, without a chance to open his mouth for appeal or
defiance: the insolent words that he had spoken to Christian the
last that he was ever to speak...</p>

<p>The lamp trembled in Hensdorff's withered hand. He set it down
upon the table, and the little light it gave did not enable him
any longer to see the crucifix. He wished, with a certain
fatigued dullness, that he might die, like the Duchess of
Schönbuchel had died&mdash;quietly, in his bed; escaping the
winter and the events that filled the winter. For he, like
herself&mdash;like the old Duchess and like Colonel
Pons&mdash;had no hope of any spring.</p>

<p>In a restless search for distraction, he went to the window,
and looked across the river at the palace where General Crack
lodged. There were lights in all the windows, carriages before
the door, and people going in and out through the large, bright
entrance. An evening bell rang out, with melancholy clearness. It
seemed to Hensdorff to strike a note that was the deepest earnest
of a complete despair.</p>

<p>The world shuddered into a gaudy blank beneath a pitiless and
an inscrutable heaven.</p>

<p>"I am too old for these unquiet thoughts," mused Hensdorff. "I
have lived my life, and it is time I was relieved of my post. Why
do I concern myself with all these passions, that to me are
withered as the last leaf on a dead tree?"</p>

<p>His tired glance fell to the dark river flowing before the
house, and of all his tired and tumultuous thoughts came most
clearly the thought of the river flowing so inevitably to the
sea; a commonplace thought, but one that would not be
dismissed.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="first">LEOPOLD knelt before the Papal Legate; his
purple mantle lined with ermine hung from his shoulders down the
gilded steps. He held in one hand the heavy sceptre, and in the
other the glistening globe; the Imperial signet ring was on his
finger, and he was girded with Caesar's Imperial sword; on his
head was the Ducal bonnet of Austria.</p>

<p>The old cardinal, bent beneath the weight of vestments, that
were as heavy as any warrior's cuirass, held above the young
man's blond head the diadem of Saint Leopold: the symbol of
temporal power over all the nations of the earth&mdash;that
fantastic dream of the proudest and most ambitious of men. The
Electors and the Princes were grouped round the altar steps. The
church was one surging sparkle and glitter, from nave to nave,
from aisle to aisle. The pungent sweetness of incense warmed the
stagnant winter air.</p>

<p>Leopold looked down at the satin cushion on which he knelt. It
had large bullion tassels, and he watched these in childish
fascination as they hung down on the steps.</p>

<p>He rose stiffly from his knees, scarcely able to move from the
cumbrous weight of the Imperial trappings, which were rigid with
heavy gems and plates of gold. From every available part of his
person, he sparkled with jewels. The Imperial Diadem, resting on
a cap of crimson velvet, encircled his brows, and he felt them
ache beneath this burden, as he turned to face the gathered
princes, potentates and soldiers who filled the old church, where
so many emperors had stood, where he stood now. Symbols of his
unutterable supremacy were handed, one by one, to the waiting
nobles, the apple, the ring, the sword, the sceptre, the
globe...</p>

<p>He was then able to move, and, with his heavy robe held up by
pages, mount the steps which led to the Imperial Throne, arranged
on the right of the altar, beneath a canopy that gleamed with
golden eagles.</p>

<p>Leopold glanced round those close-packed, silent, expectant
faces, all staring at him; all the faces of men who had supported
him, believed in him, fought for him, and come here to see him
crowned. He could read nothing into any of these countenances,
which were mostly stern, stalwart, and grimly set&mdash;scarred
and ravaged, many of them, with siege, fatigue and labour.
Leopold's blue eyes flickered from one to the other, caring for
none of them: looking for one face only in all that gathered
press. Near the steps of the throne he found it&mdash;the face of
Christian of Kurland, who was standing rigid in his mantle over
his uniform, with his hat under his arm. And, as Leopold gazed
down at him, he gazed up at Leopold; for the first time since
that day when Gabor had been shot in the bare field outside
Limburg, the glance of these two men met.</p>

<p>Leopold drew back almost imperceptibly into the gorgeous
recesses of his throne, and Christian, without moving a muscle,
continued to gaze at him. Leopold had again to receive the
sceptre, the ring and the sword, and in doing so must withdraw
his eyes from those other eyes staring up at him.</p>

<p>He sat stiffly on the throne while the involved ceremonial
worked to its splendid conclusion. He had lost all sense, both of
his own identity and of reality. He thought that if a doll, an
image, a puppet had feeling, it must feel as he felt
now&mdash;seated up there, raised above all these other men,
tricked out with all this gorgeous bravery of detail, adorned
with every adornment, sparkling with every gem, crushed and
confined by imposing robe and crown.</p>

<p>As the Latin chant continued to rise and fall on that still,
incense-sweetened air, he slowly turned his head again and looked
down at that group of nobles to his right; and there was General
Crack, still looking at him, with no expression at all, but with
an unblenching steadiness.</p>

<p>Again Leopold had to show himself to the men who had chosen
him. The Papal Legate took him by the hand, and led him to the
front of the altar, and made the gesture of presenting him to his
Electors.</p>

<p>Three times they shouted for him, with a continuous and steady
voice; but Leopold did not heed these shouts. He looked at one
man only: Christian; and that man did not open his lips, but
remained with folded arms, listening and watching, silent, while
the others gave their steady acclamations.</p>

<p>Leopold put his hand to his throat, where the gold cords that
held his mantle tugged hard at his neck. He tried to loosen or
ease this, for he felt that he was stifling. Nothing in the
large, crowded church mattered to him save the man who was not
shouting out his name.</p>

<p>Hensdorff, who had been regarding him closely, thought that he
would faint, and had a grotesque and horrible picture of him
sinking from his throne, with his diadem rolling to his feet. But
Leopold was able to control himself. He went through his pompous
part with passive patience and mechanical dignity. He had been
all his life trained for this moment.</p>

<p>In silence he allowed himself to be disrobed, only giving a
light sigh as the portentous mantles were lifted from his tired
shoulders. At the head of the most sparkling and resplendent
cavalcade that Europe could produce, he rode through the streets
of Frankfurt, with the man who had not acclaimed him by his side,
and a train of princes behind.</p>

<p>The snow, which had not ceased for twenty-four hours, was
still falling. It lay a foot deep in the narrow streets, and
white and blank upon the sloping roofs, and outlined with ghastly
lividness the tall spires. For all these sharp rigours of this
inclement weather, the streets were crowded; there were masques
and carnivals to-night. The people pressed at the windows and on
the pavements, in doorways and on balconies. For one who shouted
for Leopold, there were twelve who shouted for General Crack.</p>

<p>Leopold turned to speak to the man who rode so silently beside
him.</p>

<p>"You see, Prince," he managed to say, "that you are very
popular; and much appreciated in the Empire. What I could do
would be but little, after such popular enthusiasms."</p>

<p>"It is all of it," smiled Christian, "very little."</p>

<p>"You may," said Leopold, with an even greater effort, "command
me in what you will. I should have assured you of that before,
but there has been, in these last hurried days, little
opportunity for speech."</p>

<p>"And no occasion for speech, Sire," replied Christian. They
crossed the bridge, over the black and rapid river, the main
cortege flashing many colours through the greyness and the heavy,
falling snow.</p>

<p>Leopold remarked:</p>

<p>"The roads will be bad&mdash;perhaps impossible; and my sister
must have been delayed; she should, Sir, have been here to-day,"
he added, in another attempt to draw his companion into friendly
conversation: the most nauseous mockery, yet one he felt
compelled to perform. He could not endure that silent man. He
must, he would, make him speak.</p>

<p>Christian replied:</p>

<p>"The weather is very severe. It is as well the campaign has
ended." And he referred drily to the six months' truce which had
been signed last night.</p>

<p>"I owe everything to you!" said Leopold, like an automaton.
"At the Diet you shall hear my formal thanks, and receive my
formal reward." He thought, as they clattered through streets: "I
shall have to give him Kurland&mdash;I promised Kurland; and
perhaps another province too. And then he will be independent of
me."</p>

<p>They reached the Palace, which sparkled with many lights
through the thickening snowstorm; for, though it was yet early in
the day, an increasing darkness had overspread the city.</p>

<p>The Emperor dismounted, with two princes at his stirrups, and
entered the house followed by all the cavalcade. There was to be
a banquet, and some punctilious rejoicing; a fine, gilded flower
of victory, spreading itself open to the sun of applause; in the
courtyard a heart-shaped fountain would run with red and white
wine.</p>

<p>The flavour of meat, the perfume of pastry, and the odours of
conserves, came down the warm corridors; lamps and candles were
reflected in a million facets of crystal, which gave forth a
million different colours.</p>

<p>Christian ascended the broad stairs with Leopold, step for
step, side by side.</p>

<p>All the wide doors stood open on the banqueting room; they
could see the hundreds of lustres gleaming on the board, where
the gold plate was loaded with exotic fruits, the supreme luxury
of this winter season. And the empty throne showed haughty on the
dais underneath the Imperial canopy; the French had long been in
occupation of the free city and had introduced every luxury.</p>

<p>Leopold thought, restlessly: "To-morrow at the Diet he must
take the oath of fealty to me; I shall see him kneeling in front
of me, he must put his hands between mine, and do homage for
Kurland." There could be no evasion of that. Together with all
the other princes of the Empire, Christian would have to take the
vows of obeisance to Leopold. And the Emperor stared at him,
wondering how either of them would get through that scene.</p>

<p>The musicians were already playing in the gallery; a light and
delicate and mournful melody came softly through the empty
banqueting room into the crowded corridors. As the Archduchess
had not arrived in time for the Coronation, there were no women:
only the men&mdash;close-pressed ranks of men, the Electors, the
Princes, the Generals and the Ministers, who had pledged their
names and fortunes to the cause of Leopold of Bavaria.</p>

<p>The snow and the darkness increased. It seemed as if the
intensity of the silent storm was invading even the brilliantly
lit palace. All the lustre and splendour of the inner lights
seemed dimmed by the outer darkness; a darkness more potent and
more poignant than the mere darkness of night.</p>

<p>In the Imperial antechamber, Leopold took off his fur cloak,
his gloves, his hat, and adjusted the brilliant civilian dress he
wore: a gala attire, shimmering, powdered with brilliants and
pearls. He gazed at himself in the long mirror, curled round with
lilies, above the black mantel-shelf, and could not escape again
that insistent sensation of unreality, as if this bedizened
creature that he gazed at could not possibly be
himself&mdash;could not be that man who, in the shameful dawn,
had crept away from Ottenheim with Gabor's sneers behind him, and
her mute and stricken face gazing after his retreat.</p>

<p>In the mirror he saw Christian, Hensdorff and De Lisle enter
the room, with the Margrave of Baden, the Marquis of Mantua, the
Elector of Saxony, the Elector of Würtemberg and some other
gentlemen. He did not turn and face them, but continued to gaze
at their reflexions in the mirror.</p>

<p>All took off their outer attire&mdash;all save Christian, who
remained as he had entered, his hat under his arm, his cloak
hanging by the gilt chain from his shoulders, all flecked and
marked with snow, fading into wet.</p>

<p>Leopold turned slowly until his back was to the mirror; but he
did not face them, for his glance was downcast. He was, however,
acutely aware that Christian had stepped into the middle of the
room, and he heard him say, softly, in a voice quite
expressionless:</p>

<p>"Sire, it is understood that I have fulfilled my compact."</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer to this challenge and there was a
murmur of surprise from the other men, who all looked keenly and
quickly from Leopold to Christian.</p>

<p>Hensdorff put his withered hand to his mouth; the long
suspense was over; the inevitable moment had arrived at last; he
at least was glad of that, whatever malignant fate prevailed in
the conclusion.</p>

<p>He replied for Leopold, in a low unsurprised voice:</p>

<p>"Certainly Your Highness has fulfilled your engagement."

<p>Prince Christian turned slightly towards him, but continued to
address the Emperor.</p>

<p>"I undertook to serve in this campaign," he said, "to take the
command of your forces, Sire, and to crown you at Frankfurt,
besides bringing the war to some manner of halt with the Allies.
This has been done. Yesterday an armistice was signed; to-day you
were crowned."</p>

<p>"I have disputed none of this," murmured Leopold, temperately,
"nor my obligation to you."</p>

<p>Christian glanced indifferently round the faces of the other
men, who watched him in such an amaze of curiosity; they were
nothing to him, but the witnesses of his official action.</p>

<p>"Then, gentlemen, you see me absolved from further service. My
employment is at an end."</p>

<p>"Surely, Prince," protested De Lisle, eagerly, "you would not
put matters in those terms, as if you were some mercenary, who
has done his task and now asks for pay and goes?"</p>

<p>"I do put it in those terms," replied Christian with the
greatest courtesy for the old Maréchal, "and I am a mercenary,
and I have served my term and go; but I do not ask for pay."</p>

<p>He spoke lightly, and in a low voice, as if the matter was
indifferent to him, and the occasion but an ordinary occasion;
that was his pride, to keep the moment above passion; yet they
were all silent, held and puzzled by the words he spoke, and by
his aspect; he appeared to tower even beyond his actual majestic
height.</p>

<p>Leopold continued to keep his glance downwards; Maréchal De
Lisle spoke again, still with eagerness and a certain
distress.</p>

<p>"You speak as if you put down your command, Prince; but that
seems scarcely possible!"</p>

<p>"It is what I do, Monseigneur," said Christian; "but first I
would have an admission that I have accomplished what I
undertook."</p>

<p>Receiving no reply from Leopold, he looked at Hensdorff, and
Hensdorff replied:</p>

<p>"It is true that you have done all that you undertook to do,
and perfectly put through your part."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I am free of it, Monseigneur," responded
Christian; "and that is all I have to say."</p>

<p>"You leave us, then?" cried De Lisle, ruefully.</p>

<p>Christian glanced at him, and beyond him at the curious and
disturbed Electors and Princes, all beginning to ponder their own
interests.</p>

<p>"We are in carnival here," he smiled; "this is a festival. Let
us put up our masks, that there be no scandal to mar these
rejoicings! Messeigneurs, if we meet again, it will be with
admiration, whichever side we separately serve."</p>

<p>Hensdorff had now gone up to Leopold, and said, with clear
insistence:</p>

<p>"Has Your Majesty nothing to say to him?"</p>

<p>Leopold looked up, and said with painful difficulty:</p>

<p>"What should I have to say to him? It seems he lays his
charges down without any permission of mine! Would you have me
try to stay him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could stay me," remarked Christian. "I only pause to
know you hold me absolved of all my oaths."</p>

<p>The Prince of Würtemberg asked:</p>

<p>"What vast intents has Your Highness, that you must thus, of a
sudden, abandon us? Will you not share in the fruits of your own
victories?"</p>

<p>"I cannot dispute or quarrel over those," replied Christian.
"I have but come here to lay down my charges and to say farewell
to all of you, Messeigneurs. Go in to your feasting undisturbed
by any thought of me."</p>

<p>"Where will you go?" demanded Hensdorff, "and whom will you
serve?"</p>

<p>To that last replied Christian:</p>

<p>"No one; I am again my own master."</p>

<p>He took off his collar of diamonds and laid it on the little
light table by Leopold; then unfastened and placed beside it the
other crosses, jewels and honours that he had received from the
hands of the Emperor; as he shifted his cloak they all remarked
that he no longer wore the Imperial uniform, but that of his own
Uhlans.</p>

<p>"I have no desire for these," he remarked. "If I have it need
of them again, I will take them from the hands of another
man."</p>

<p>He stood now quite close to Leopold, who looked at him for the
first time, hardly able to forbear shrinking before that potent
presence, and spoke, quietly and levelly, yet under his breath,
as if he had not the power to raise his voice:</p>

<p>"Do you rebel against me?" he asked. "Do you defy me?"</p>

<p>"Neither," said Christian. "You never have been any master of
mine."</p>

<p>At this, there was a little movement among the other men, and
one or two of them put their hands to their sword-hilts; but
Leopold made a gesture that held them still; though deeply
curious.</p>

<p>"No subject of yours; no servant of yours!" added Christian.
"Take back your trifling rewards. I am not here to destroy your
festival."</p>

<p>Leopold put his hand to his bosom; this was intolerable, could
not be further hushed up...</p>

<p>"Twenty times since you began to speak," he murmured, "my
heart has failed me to say what I have to say."</p>

<p>"I leave you," smiled Christian, "at the mercy of those
unspoken words."</p>

<p>Into a second's pause came Hensdorff's old, thin voice: "Do
you leave us like this, on the verge of the unavoidable gifts of
your estates and glories?"</p>

<p>"I have kept my word," replied Christian, with sudden
sternness, "and now you must hire another man to lead your petty
fortunes to their tawdry triumphs."</p>

<p>"But this is insupportable!" murmured Leopold. "Not thus can
we come to conclusions."</p>

<p>"<i>Not thus</i> do we come to any conclusions," cried
Christian, turning upon him with sudden ferocity. "We shall meet
again and come to our conclusions, you sick, paltering boy!"</p>

<p>"Take that back," gasped Leopold. "I've some power
yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make it no quarrel here!" cried Hensdorff, stepping between
them, while the others, amazed and disordered, stepped back at
the words addressed to Leopold, yet relished them as the keen
truth. "Make it no quarrel here, Prince Christian&mdash;nor you,
Sire. As you yourself say, the issue and the conclusion must be
in another place."</p>

<p>"Where," asked Leopold, unsteadily, "shall that other place
be, if not here and now?"</p>

<p>"No particular spot on earth," replied Christian. "Anywhere
where you and I meet together alone and unhampered."</p>

<p>"He defies him! He insults him!" smiled the Prince of
Würtemberg. And the Elector of Saxony added, sucking his thick
lips: "He insults the Emperor!"</p>

<p>Christian turned to them immediately.</p>

<p>"Take up that challenge when and how you will," he said. "I
ask no followers and no support! I can deal, Messeigneurs, with
your censure and your displeasure as I have dealt with your
support and with your applause&mdash;in complete
indifference!"</p>

<p>"You talk rebellion, Monseigneur," returned the Elector,
hotly, "and cannot be suffered so to depart; who knows what
trouble you may cause in the Empire?"</p>

<p>"For nothing am I answerable to you, Monseigneur," replied
Christian. "Nay&mdash;no longer, now, to any man! Cross not my
constancy further, but let us make an end of these peevish
quarrellings and womanish railings! Monseigneurs, let me
pass."</p>

<p>For the Elector and the Prince of Würtemberg had both made a
movement as if to bar the door.</p>

<p>Leopold was weakly supporting himself on the black marble
chimneypiece, leaning heavily on his arm and staring down at the
heap of gaudy, glittering trinkets that Christian had cast on the
table beside him&mdash;trinkets that matched those that still he
himself wore.</p>

<p>Christian turned to De Lisle, who stood distracted and
downcast, and spoke, and now with a certain warmth and hurry in
the voice that had been so chill and so contained:</p>

<p>"Here I suspend the exercise of my command," he said, "and
speak to you, Monseigneur, as a private gentleman, wishing you
all honour and admiration from others as you shall ever have it
from me; and all imagined and accustomed glories to the arms of
France."</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and old De Lisle's grasped it warmly, as
if he honoured them before them all.</p>

<p>As he spoke to De Lisle, Christian had stood with his back to
Leopold, of whom he seemed to take no further heed; but now he
turned once again to Hensdorff, and said:</p>

<p>"Give me, Count, my final discharge. Tell me, before these
gentlemen, that I leave you without fleck or slur upon my
reputation."</p>

<p>"You have behaved," said Hensdorff, heavily, "with undeviating
honesty and stern honour, from the day when we first made our
bargain, Prince. I here acquit you of all further
obligation."</p>

<p>"Must you," asked Leopold, hoarsely, "further gall me with all
this? Let him begone, Hensdorff! Immediately let him
begone&mdash;I could have him arrested for this."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should tell you," remarked Christian, looking at
him again and now addressing him without any title of honour, and
as he spoke putting his hat upon his head, "perhaps I should tell
you that many of my officers are apprised of my intention, and
many of the troops go with me: those of my own raising and my
particular loyalty. They have not been seduced from your service,
for it was I who brought them into that. It was always General
Crack, and not Leopold of Bavaria whom they served."</p>

<p>"A division at such a moment?" murmured one of the princes.
"We are undone before we are well got together!"</p>

<p>"Look to yourselves," smiled Christian. "You have your Emperor
crowned: see you keep him so!"</p>

<p>"It will make an ugly tale abroad!" muttered the Elector of
Saxony, "and do grievous harm to all of us. I do not think that
your reputation, Prince Christian, will shine the clearer."</p>

<p>And Christian replied, staring him down:</p>

<p>"I have no vanity that the world should admire me."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Leopold, "let him go&mdash;or I will put him
under arrest."</p>

<p>Maréchal De Lisle here reminded him that the King of France
ruled in Frankfurt and that he as His Majesty's representative
would be no party to the arrest of Prince Christian.</p>

<p>Christian saluted them all, ignoring the Emperor, and passed
out of the antechamber into the corridors, crowded with people
pressing to the Imperial banquet.</p>

<p>He had closed the door behind him, but it was opened again
almost immediately, and Hensdorff came out. The old man touched
the soldier's sleeve to attract his attention, for Christian was
looking ahead of him, making his way, not without difficulty,
through the surging crowd. When he looked back quickly over his
shoulder, Hensdorff said:</p>

<p>"I would come with you, Monseigneur!"</p>

<p>"Whatever my destination?" asked Christian, pausing.</p>

<p>And Hensdorff, nodding and coughing a little, said:</p>

<p>"Whatever your destination! I have suffered," he added, below
his breath, "every variety of chance and fortune, and have little
more to fear or lose, nor much, I think, is left to endure."</p>

<p>The two men made their way out through the chattering crowd,
who were but waiting for the appearance of the Emperor in the
banqueting room to take therein their own places. Christian and
Hensdorff were saluted and observed by many; no one thought that
they did other than move from one part of the palace to another,
in readiness for the prolonged festival. They had left the
mansion and were on the broad entrance steps before any one could
have credited their departure.</p>

<p>Hensdorff noted that Christian had everything in readiness;
his troop of Uhlans were waiting in the narrow, snowy street; his
own horse was ready, led by two grooms, waiting for him.
Hensdorff found his attendant lackey, and sent instantly for his
carriage. All outer sounds were muffled by the trodden snow that
lay so deeply in the streets&mdash;all sounds of men and horses,
coming and going; but not the sounds from the palace and the
banqueting room, which, muffled yet strident, came clearly down
the street from the high-set windows.</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not ask where Christian was going. He bid his
coachman follow the little cavalcade of Uhlans wherever they
might proceed.</p>

<p>Leopold was seated upon his dais now, seated upon his throne
under his Imperial canopy, surrounded by full and unblemished
pomp; yet there was one dull noise continuously in his ears,
above the babble of all the flatteries and adulations that flowed
about his loaded table: the muffled clattering sound beneath his
window of troop after troop, regiment after regiment, tramping
through the streets.</p>

<p>He longed, yet dreaded, to know what this endless movement of
troops might be, and he looked round uneasily for Hensdorff, who
was always there, ready to give him advice and support and
consolation. He wanted to ask Hensdorff what was occurring in the
town, if he should not go abroad; and, staggering and irresolute
as he was in his mind, he began to sway himself to some passion
of great deeds, some hope and desire of heading his own troops
against the rebels and the rebellions&mdash;for such, he
believed, rebels and rebellions were now surging in the noble
streets of the free city; rebellion led by General Crack, ay, he
must deal with that...</p>

<p>But Hensdorff was not there. When Leopold at length asked one
of the Electors where the minister had gone, that Prince replied,
not resisting a leer:</p>

<p>"Count Hensdorff went with General Crack."</p>

<p>Leopold looked round the feast and saw many empty places; and,
while the faultless ceremonial of the banquet went forward,
several more rose and left the table, with but a curt obeisance
to the Emperor and some jesting excuse to their neighbours, for
by now most of them knew of the breach between Christian and
Leopold, and all were quite well aware who was the better man;
and the Emperor knew that they knew it and what these departures
meant...yet he would not have cared if Hensdorff had stayed; ah,
they were ringing the bells now&mdash;through the bells and the
sound of the music played in the gallery you could hardly hear
the clatter of the cavalry; how grave De Lisle looked, neither
eating nor drinking...but he, the Emperor, would drink...He would
consume the most fiery wines though her face was in every
glass&mdash;the face of a fury now red with horror...</p>

<p>He spoke to De Lisle, who, as representative of France, sat in
the place of honour on his right hand.</p>

<p>"Maréchal, shall we go presently to the theatre? There is a
delicious Columbine, the prettiest possible they say;" he added
with a wild accent he could not control: "but you will remember
one who outshone her, Angélique, who danced like a plumy wave,
but was a slut from Naples, the Duke of Kurland's
harlot&mdash;"</p>

<p>No one in the room who heard that name but paused in what he
said or did and stared at Leopold.</p>

<p>De Lisle replied coldly:</p>

<p>"That were better said to his face, Sire, or not at all."</p>

<p>"Rebuked by you, Monseigneur?" replied Leopold bitterly. "See
how I am fallen through dealings with ignoble men!"</p>

<p>And yet he sat so high, placed above them all in the utmost
ostentation of trophied potency...ah, must they play an aria from
<i>Alexander in Egypt</i>?...through those tinsel strains of mock
triumph he could hear the troops leaving Frankfurt, boldly
through the snowy streets...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">MEN saw portents in the sky that winter and
combats of ghostly warriors, as if the perpetual combats on the
earth had been mirrored in the continuous snow-clouds. The
weather was of unbroken gloom and overbearing severity; the
waters of the Danube lay bound for miles under black ice; the
marshes of Styria were one endless fog. Starved birds dropped
dead from the cold, blasted trees onto the iron-hard ground.
Tempests tore up from tumultuous seas, and battered the
devastated land. Men beheld comets rending fierce midnight skies,
lambent meteors like bloody flags, and darkling monsters peering
from the icy waves that clawed at the shores. One beleaguered
town had shuddered beneath a rain of blood, and another had seen
shadowy giants struggling on the besieged ramparts; everywhere
terror, rumours, and omens of horror.</p>

<p>The Empire fell apart, like a huge body loosened by decay, and
on every fragment the vultures gathered.</p>

<p>Europe stood back, holding to the armistice. The French
withdrew into Lorraine, the Spaniards into the Southern
Netherlands, the English and the Hanoverians went home; but the
Pagans gathered in portentous multitudes in the East, only
waiting for the first relaxing of the winter, the first
possibilities of the spring, to hurl themselves at the gates of
Budapesth and Vienna. The laboriously built-up empire of Leopold
of Bavaria was scattered, as a castle made of dried leaves might
be scattered by the first blowing of a winter wind. Princes and
cities fell away from him daily; after his coronation at
Frankfurt he could scarcely call himself an emperor: his glory
had begun and ended on that one occasion. Even at the Diet, many
of the Electors gave him their open defiance. His cause was too
paltry for their selfish upholding.</p>

<p>After the defection of his Commander-in-Chief, he appeared so
unnerved that most of his supporters regarded him as a man doomed
to immediate defeat, and therefore left him; Count Hensdorff had
gone too, the old minister who had held them all in
check&mdash;or at bay; who had soothed and promised, consoled and
threatened, with so much art. No one knew what quarrel Leopold
had had with these two men, but they gave him the wrong of it,
and this from his very look and bearing. Many of the potentates
went immediately to swear fealty to the husband of the Queen of
Hungary. Others went back to their provinces in sullen
neutrality, watching cautiously and viciously for an opportunity
to serve their own ends.</p>

<p>Maréchal De Lisle shrugged and returned to Paris, glad that
the campaign had come to an end, and earnestly, in his heart,
resolving to advise the ministers of His Most Christian Majesty
to waste no more time or money or men upon Leopold of Bavaria,
and to endeavour to entice to Paris General Crack, now Maréchal
de France.</p>

<p>Some troops and some generals remained to the Emperor. There
was his own especial Imperial Regiments, and the Circle of
Swabia, which were as yet loyal; and they did what they could,
but with a certain reluctance, though Leopold promised
concessions and rewards to every one. Indeed, he lavished his
favours with too prodigal a hand; made those whom he caressed and
flattered suspicious that it would never be in his power to
fulfil his opulent pledges.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia abandoned him immediately, and made his
pact with the rival claimant to the Imperial Throne; and General
Crack rode across the ruin of the Empire, in open revolt and open
defiance, serving no cause but his own. He had secured, and
without great effort, part of Pomerania, for neither Poland nor
Russia interfered with him there: and the people welcomed him
passionately, as the one heroic figure of a mean and doubtful
hour. He had those qualities which ever impress the populace.
There was something symbolic of the greatest that may be expected
of mankind in his courage, his energy and his intelligence. The
finest of Leopold's troops had followed him over the many-arched
bridge of Frankfurt the day of the Emperor's coronation. He had
raised many more by the sheer power of his name. And many
princes, hoping to join in the plunder of his inevitable
victories, had joined his standard. Towns and forts
under-garrisoned, or even entirely abandoned by Leopold,
surrendered to the troops of Christian of Kurland at sight, not
knowing, in the most bitter and most bloody of confusion, whom he
served; nor greatly caring, as long as they received a temporary
respite from the black miseries of war.</p>

<p>From all such places, Christian tore the Eagles down and put
up the flag of Kurland; he still kept his gaze on Kurland. In a
few weeks it might have seemed that he had as good a chance of
the disputed diadem as either of the rival Hapsburgs. His glutted
and triumphant soldiery reminded themselves of the old days of
Rome, when the troops had chosen their own Emperor from among
their most successful members. It was well known that Christian
had always wanted power&mdash;more and more power. No one
believed that he would have long served any Caesar. Why he had
put this particular Caesar up to drag him down remained a
bewilderment.</p>

<p>To no man did he explain himself. General Crack had now
contemptuously cast off his adherence to the Lutheran faith, and
was again surrounded with priests and Jesuits: though how the
Pope might view his position no one yet knew. He harried
Romanists and Protestants alike, pursuing the harassed Leopold
through all the woods and cities of the Empire.</p>

<p>He called himself Sovereign Duke of Kurland, and none whose
words he was likely to hear were desirous of disputing his title,
though he acknowledged no emperor to secure him in the fief. He
had his court, his generals, his complete organization for war;
but no man was of his constant company, save Count Michael
Hensdorff, whose long and painful labours had gone to raise the
man whom Christian had so easily and contemptuously toppled
over.</p>

<p>Though languishing and suffering from the atrocious inclemency
of the weather, Hensdorff travelled everywhere with Prince
Christian: whether as adviser or no was not known. Christian was
not the man to accept the counsels of any one; yet if he was not
relying upon the dry and experienced wisdom of Hensdorff, there
seemed no reason for the queerly contrasted couple to remain
together. No one understood the nature of their attachment; nor
did Hensdorff open his heart to any.</p>

<p>Once a young adventuring princeling, who had dared to join
these rebel standards, had the courage to ask Count Hensdorff how
he thought these tangled and ferocious battles would end.</p>

<p>"The Prince," he said, "must either seize the Empire or be
crushed utterly. The country is ruined, and cannot support much
more warfare. What is the end to be?"</p>

<p>Hensdorff smiled, as if this was the question of a child.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," he replied, "you joined us for the sake of
booty, did you not? Well, secure that same booty while you
may...there is, as you say, an Empire for your plundering."</p>

<p>But the young man, hesitant and dubious, fearful that he had
committed himself too far in his wild venture, grumbled: "It is
easier to raise a whirlwind than to calm it down again. Out of
all this chaos, what is to arrive?"</p>

<p>And he had the impudence to add: "It is greatly wondered that
you, Count Hensdorff, so good a friend of stable government, and
so prudent a statesman, should join this confederacy under Prince
Christian, which has no bottom, and, it seems to me, no
future."</p>

<p>But Hensdorff replied, with dry indifference:</p>

<p>"If your courage runs out, ride home, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>By the end of March, the very apex of the winter and of the
war appeared to have been reached. Howling winds drowned the
lamentations of men, and thick snowstorms buried their mangled,
starved and exhausted bodies; sombre and tormented rivers cast
blocks of ice against the ramparts of beleaguered towns.
Tempests, as fiercely as shot and shell, tore down the proudest
of battling flags. Night after night the great comet glared
through rifts in the inky clouds, a livid torch above the ruined
land. Wolves, grey and gaunt from hunger, harried the camp and
howled in the passes. Yet, in some safer places, where the hidden
women gathered, there was a hectic gaiety reddened here not by
blood, but by the lamps of carnival, and traversed, not by
artillery and thundering troops, but by frivolous sledges, shaped
like swans, like Neptunes, like mermen and monsters; drawn by
dappled horses with high-clipped plumes and dangling
trappings.</p>

<p>The Countess Carola was galloping through Vienna in one of
these chariots. She had now left her husband, and taken a lover,
becoming openly the woman she had always been at heart. In this
capital without a government, and severely menaced on several
sides, this lady reigned as temporary queen, and mocked at both
Leopold and Christian&mdash;one as a weakling, and the other as
base-born. And she remarked, with exquisite malice, that it did
not appear that Prince Christian ever went to visit his wife at
Ottenheim; and that she, poor fool, must be lonely enough in that
outlandish Château on the Danube!</p>

<p>She commiserated also, with delicate impertinence, the
Archduchess Maria Luisa&mdash;the unfortunate Emperor's still
more unfortunate sister, who had found no husband before her
brother lost his throne.</p>

<p>Making painful progress over the winter roads from Brussels,
Maria Luisa had learnt of the defection of General Crack, and the
crashing downfall of her brother's hopes. She had then refused to
pursue her way to Vienna, and, leaving the other women, had
endeavoured to join Leopold, who had been obliged to leave
Frankfurt, held by the French. The sensitive woman would have
preferred to forego the comparative safety of the capital than to
go there to listen to the mocks about her brother and herself;
for not only had General Crack left them, but Count Hensdorff,
their father's friend, on whom they had both, almost
passionately, relied; this, to Maria Luisa, was an intolerable
humiliation.</p>

<p>Leopold could give her no adequate protection&mdash;hardly,
even, adequate shelter: and so, through the black horrors of that
fell winter, the lady wandered from place to place, staying in
inns and palaces as she could find accommodation or inspire
charity; scarcely knowing her direction, bewildered by a dozen
contrary reports, uncertain of everything, she frequently fled in
the winter night on some strident alarm, with the scantiest of
escorts.</p>

<p>The end of March there was a brief midnight meeting between
brother and sister; he urged her to take shelter in some convent;
but there was no such refuge in this part of Germany, and the
frightened girl declared that she would endeavour to reach
Bavaria, the greater portion of which still held loyal to them;
and there to secure some nook in which to hide.</p>

<p>"We both play noble parts, it seems!" she cried, wildly. "You
and I harried and harassed here and there!" And she dared to ask:
"Why did Christian&mdash;why did Hensdorff leave you,
Leopold?"</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer this, but replied fearfully:</p>

<p>"I am not utterly undone yet. I will seize them both, and have
them shot as traitors, as Christian had the Transylvanian shot at
Limburg. Ay, with gags in their mouths, too!"</p>

<p>Maria Luisa did not know what these frantic words meant. They
seemed to her the very foam and fume of idle boasting. If her
brother could save his life and some portion of his paternal
estates, she thought that was all he could save; and she puzzled
bitterly over the defection of Count Hensdorff. Christian she
might understand: he was a mercenary, of no definite nationality
and no definite standing; he might follow his caprices and serve
whom he would, or no one at all, as the mood took him. But
Hensdorff, grounded so deeply in honour and loyalty to their
House, who had been so faithful, even while not believing in the
cause he served! For she had seen it, the watching girl: seen
Hensdorff's dubious acceptance of her brother; seen his ironic
allegiance to Leopold; and relied&mdash;always relied!&mdash;on
his constant loyalty. And then, at the very moment of the
coronation and the triumph, he had deserted to a rebel...</p>

<p>Leopold, shuddering in his heavy military cloak, continued to
talk extravagantly of revenge. His sister stared at him in the
uncertain light of the lamp above the gateway, where they had met
and they must part. Leopold had but a small troop with him, and
did not tell his sister where he rode.</p>

<p>"I cannot take you with me now," he said; "but I do not think
it will be so long before we meet in Vienna."</p>

<p>But Maria Luisa in terror responded:</p>

<p>"Do not vaunt so, Leopold! Do not vaunt!"</p>

<p>Leopold drew his hat further over his eyes, as if he did not
wish her to observe his countenance; and, with a sudden change of
fallen voice, muttered:</p>

<p>"I wish you would go to Ottenheim!"</p>

<p>Nothing could have amazed the Archduchess more.</p>

<p>"To Ottenheim?" she exclaimed, peering through the cold
gloom.</p>

<p>"Yes, to Ottenheim; but it is impossible," he replied,
hastily. "The enemy is between us and there. It is impossible:
and yet, I wish you were in Ottenheim, to be with&mdash;" But he
would not say the name. He bit his lip and looked upon his
saddle.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa was bewildered. To her, Eleanora was Christian's
wife, and nothing else. She pressed her brother to explain his
meaning, and he said, reluctantly:</p>

<p>"I thought two lonely women&mdash;and something of an
age&mdash;that you might be together; but it is a fantasy, like
most of my thoughts just now."</p>

<p>"Where are you riding?" asked Maria Luisa.</p>

<p>"I do not know; I am in the hands of Knittelfeldt. I have made
him my Commander-in-Chief. He is a capable but an overbearing
man," added Leopold, nervously, "and I cannot tell one day what
he will do the next. You are safe enough here, but I must go my
way."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa remained dutifully behind, though she would have
far rather accompanied him in all his perils; nor was she so
safe. Within two days the little town capitulated before the
Kurlander's advance and Maria Luisa must again fly in the bitter
and unfriendly dawn, with but one child as her companion&mdash;a
boy who had been her brother's page.</p>

<p>They rode as far as their horses could carry them; but when
the animals were exhausted, and they had to leave them at an inn,
this was found to be too miserable to supply them with remounts;
and it was on foot that the Archduchess had to pursue her way
across the frozen fields.</p>

<p>She had been urged, by the commander of the garrison, to throw
herself on the mercy of the capturing force. But this was
impossible to Maria Luisa. Above all things, all her dreads and
terrors, she had this most monstrous terror, of falling into the
hands of General Crack.</p>

<p>She had been assured that both her rank and sex alike
protected her; but this made no impression upon her resolution.
She would rather perish in one of these frost-bound ditches,
underneath these blasted trees, than be dragged into the presence
of Christian of Kurland&mdash;his captive.</p>

<p>She had hoped to reach Altsdorf, a small fortified town which
held for Leopold, before nightfall; but was, naturally enough,
lost in the bewilderment of the devastated fields and broken
woods, over which any rapid or easy progress was impossible. Both
she and the boy were almost immediately footsore, and soon cold
and faint with hunger; for they had been able to receive only the
most miserable meal at the inn, and had neither food nor money
with them: not that this last would have been of much use, for,
surveying the wild and desolate landscape, Maria Luisa could see
no human habitation. The peasantry had long ago abandoned their
farms&mdash;the men to take arms for one side or another, and the
women and children to trail after the armies, or perish on the
roads.</p>

<p>"We must pass the night somewhere," said the exhausted
Archduchess. "It is impossible for us to reach Altsdorf tonight,
even if we knew the direction&mdash;which I do not and even the
road has disappeared. Everything is frozen over; I cannot
distinguish any path." She believed they were walking on a frozen
river, for stiff spikes of willows impeded their progress. The
horizon was blotted out in a dense winter fog. Wind and snow were
alike borne upon the gathering night.</p>

<p>"We shall be frozen to death," murmured the page, "if we do
not find some protection against the weather."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa endeavoured to reassure the boy.</p>

<p>"There are several barns about here&mdash;maybe there is straw
or hay left in them."</p>

<p>In her heart she knew better than this. There was not likely
to be a scrap of any manner of food or provender in a country
over which so many armies had marched. "At best," she added,
faintly, "we may find that, at least; at the worst, shelter, and
to-morrow we can push on to Altsdorf. It cannot be far away."</p>

<p>The boy agreed. He had kept up a brave front, but he was both
fatigued and frightened, and, with all that, drowsy with the
desire for sleep and warmth, for the cold seemed to increase with
every painful step they took, and even the stout thickness of
their winter mantles could not defy the penetrating wind.</p>

<p>They halted at a large barn, which was the sole building that
remained of what had once been a prosperous farm. The house and
stables were gone, the fields and gardens laid waste and frozen
over; but this barn remained, though one side of it was torn
down, and open to the bitter night.</p>

<p>The boy had a pistol, and flint and tinder, and was for making
a fire; but Maria Luisa, in her great fear, forbade this. "There
might be foragers about," she said, "and that would draw their
attention. I would rather perish of cold than fall into the hands
of the rebels!"</p>

<p>With a shudder of distaste, she made her way into the inner
part of the barn, where there yet remained a pile of old sacks
and some brushwood. Fearful of rats, she peered about in the
sombre gloom. The place was still&mdash;appeared to have been
deserted even by vermin and insects, and almost as cold as the
fields. Yet there was protection from the driving wind and the
gathering tempest. Maria Luisa was grateful even for this.</p>

<p>With stiff, chilled fingers, she arranged the sacks and
brushwood into two beds, though the boy protested stoutly that he
would keep guard all night at the entrance to the barn.</p>

<p>"I am sure," he declared, resolutely, "that Your Highness will
sleep much more soundly if I am at my post as sentinel!" Maria
Luisa smiled tenderly.</p>

<p>"No, Ferdinand," she replied, "it would be no use, for in the
morning you would be so tired that we should not be able to go on
our way; and I should have to wait, while you rested. It is much
better for you to go to sleep, and for me to sleep also; and I
will put the pistol between us, and if we are roused it will be
ready to our hands."</p>

<p>The boy could not, for all his good will, resist, and was soon
sound asleep, with the pleasant sleep of youth&mdash;agreeable
sleep, even in the midst of danger.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa thoughtfully covered him up with his cloak. He was
a very young boy, and when he slept, appeared like a child. Then
she took from her bosom a little image of her sainted, precious
Patroness, the Mother of God, which she had worn next her heart
ever since she had left Brussels. She could not see it now, in
this cold obscurity; nor could she pray to it, for that same
coldness and obscurity seemed to have fallen over her own heart;
but she held it closely in her hand, and drew from that contact a
certain wistful comfort. Her loneliness was like an icy clutch on
her whole being, squeezing all the life out of her; she felt
strangulated by the gathering dark, by that complete silence, by
this extreme isolation. She thought that it must be like this to
die, and wake up in another world, where no friend had followed
or preceded. She looked into her own heart, as eager enquirers
may look into the crystal, hoping to discern there pictures which
would allure her from her present misery. And the picture that
she immediately saw was Brussels, and that day at the Opera, when
Christian had sat opposite to her in the gilded box and received
the laurel crown from the actress, robed and garlanded; lustred
with gold and sparkling with jewels she beheld that picture, with
all the frivolous pageantry of ostentatious triumph. "Why that
picture?" she thought, with irony, "of all others." Why must she
warm her chilled hands at those artificial flames?</p>

<p>It was like a prison here, the space so confined, the dark so
dense! And surely she was freezing to death; the blood in her
veins ran so sluggishly.</p>

<p>Anxiously she bent over the boy. His forehead and his hands
were warm beneath the cloak. Then she felt her way to the outer
part of the barn, and from that to the edge, and looked over the
landscape, still glimmering in the last twilight, as if, even in
that dreary prospect, there was more comfort than that foul
confinement of the inner room.</p>

<p>She wished that she could see a star&mdash;even one little
star&mdash;but the scowling clouds lowered, thick as hate, across
the heavens.</p>

<p>But presently a human light broke the encircling greyness, and
a human sound disturbed the ominous stillness. Half in terror,
half in hope, Maria Luisa heard the soft sound of horses' hoofs
on the bitter air and through the rising wind. Men carrying
lanterns were riding near. Why should she be so transfixed with
terror she asked herself, impatiently. They might very likely be
her brother's men, a foraging party from Altsdorf.</p>

<p>They were riding nearer, and she cowered back into the
blackness of the barn, hoping to discern them before they
discovered her; but she had already had enough experience of war
to know that it was not likely that any troops would pass a barn
without looking inside to see if there was any possible provender
or booty concealed there.</p>

<p>And the men indeed came up carefully over the frozen ground,
and paused before the barn, the foremost of them holding high a
lantern that he flashed into the recesses of her shelter.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa hesitated, speculating as to whether this was help
or disaster. She could not see the uniforms of the men, for they
were all wrapped in pelisses and fur cloaks; but they saw her,
almost immediately, and she heard one after another of them
exclaim: "A woman!" while a voice said instantly: "It is the
sister of the Elector of Bavaria!"</p>

<p>She knew, by the form this statement took, that they were
enemies; Leopold was not the Emperor to them. And when the same
voice added, in a tone of indifference: "Madame, you seem in some
distress." She knew who it was that spoke: Prince Christian
himself&mdash;General Crack.</p>

<p>Cowering, she looked up and saw him where he sat among his
men, by the lamplight, as she had last seen her brother sit among
his men by lamplight.</p>

<p>"This is a heavy chance," she said, bewildered by her own ill
fortune, and in the very depths of fear and humiliation.</p>

<p>Christian was wrapped in a heavy fur pelisse to his chin,
gloved, booted extravagantly, but she knew his face
instantly&mdash;a face too familiar to her, although she had not
often seen it; and even at that moment, she found time to wonder
why he had instantly known her, of whom he had never taken much
notice, and who was now so disguised by poor and disarranged
attire.</p>

<p>"Cannot Your Highness ride on, and leave me to make my way to
Altsdorf?" she asked with timid dignity.</p>

<p>"Altsdorf is ours," he replied, briefly. "If that town is your
destination, I can show you some hospitality there."</p>

<p>She cried: "No, no!" with the utmost loathing, and he laughed:
a laugh echoed instantly by his men. Two of his soldiers had
dismounted, and were searching the barn. They had found the boy,
who was struggling with his pistol; and Maria Luisa cried
out:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you can let him go! He is only a boy&mdash;a
page of my brother's; the last left of my retinue!"

<p>Christian said:</p>

<p>"Do not hurt the boy, but bring him, with the lady, to
Altsdorf. You can, Madame, in this necessity, ride pillion with
one of my men."</p>

<p>"I would rather," she replied, desperately, "stay here, and,
if need be, perish."</p>

<p>"The decision rests with me," said General Crack, grimly. She
heard more soldiery coming up, and, in fear and frenzy, put her
fingers to her throat as if to strangle herself; but she could
not command even this way of escape; she was lifted behind one of
the Uhlans and so taken to Altsdorf, as quick as might be over
those bitter, frozen fields.</p>

<p>"A light weight," Christian had remarked, watching her swung
to the saddle, and then had ridden ahead, taking no further
notice of her; how cold it was! the wind smote her as she
rode&mdash;and how dark!</p>

<p>Earth and sky seemed alike of frozen iron as the cavalcade
turned between the narrow battered gates of Altsdorf.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">MARIA LUISA was taken to a small, but elegantly
equipped house inside Altsdorf. Here, she understood, lodged
General Crack and Count Hensdorff. The sound of this man's name
gave her some feeling of reassurance, but could not raise her
fluttering spirits to any serenity. She could hardly hope for
immediate release; too well did she know her value as a hostage.
But she did not know how she could long survive an imprisonment
so odious, so degrading and so alarming; she was possessed by
that utmost terror which comes from a sense of complete
abandonment: in this abandonment she thought the saints and
angels had combined to leave her desolate.</p>

<p>She saw no women anywhere; in all places,
soldiers&mdash;soldiers, Croatians, Uhlans and Black Cuirassiers
all those familiar uniforms which she had once seen reviewed by
her brother, and following the Imperial Eagles.</p>

<p>The room into which she was brought at last had been a woman's
room, but was now bare of all adornments. Hasty and agitated
hands had snatched down mirrors, curtains&mdash;even pictures.
All was despoiled and bare; cold, too, for the stove was
unlit.</p>

<p>With shaking half-frozen fingers, Maria Luisa strove to adjust
her fallen hair, and to reset her tumbled cravat. She wore a dark
green riding habit, fashioned like the attire of a man, with
epaulettes and gold cords, all much tarnished and awry from her
misfortunes and wanderings. She had lost her gloves and hat and
riding whip; her wet, soiled cloak had been taken from her. She
searched her wide laced pockets. There was nothing in any of them
but a few coins; not that thing for which she most longed, and
which she fretted at her foolishness in ever parting from&mdash;a
weapon, a pistol, a dagger. She had no manner of weapon of any
kind, either for defence or self-destruction.</p>

<p>When she ventured to the uncurtained window, and saw the
torch-lit garden full of soldiers, she could not resist a frantic
impulse to beat upon the casement in her agony. When she went to
the door and found it locked, and heard the step of the sentry
outside, she had to thrust the back of her hand over her mouth
that she might not betray her cowardice by a scream.</p>

<p>Since they had entered the house, she had not seen the boy.
She hoped that they would be kind to the boy...And again she took
the little image from above her frightened heart, and, dropping
on her knees, endeavoured to pray to it, as she had been taught
to pray to images, and to find consolation in reliquaries.</p>

<p>She was still on her knees in the centre of the bare floor
when the door was unlocked and opened, and there appeared, not a
soldier, but a valet in the Kurland liveries, who told her
respectfully that supper was served below, and Prince Christian
desired her company.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa remained stupidly on her knees, as if she pleaded,
not with the image that she held in her hand, but with the
impassive lackey.</p>

<p>"Is Count Hensdorff here?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"No, Madame: Count Hensdorff has not returned, but maybe he
will be here again to-night."</p>

<p>"Tell your master," replied Maria Luisa, stumbling over her
words, "that I am ill, exhausted, and most unhappy, and that I
beseech him to forgo my wretched company tonight."</p>

<p>The valet twisted his lips with a look of ironic pity.</p>

<p>"His Highness will take no excuses, and it were best not to
inflame him by offering any."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible that I should attend your master," she
pleaded, not rising; "look at me, all disarrayed as I am!" The
valet replied:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Madame, but we have no ladies' habits
here&mdash;the town has been sacked."</p>

<p>"Are there no women?" she asked. "Is there no one whom you
could send to me?"</p>

<p>"There are women enough," he replied, "but I do not think you
would greatly care for their presence, Madame."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa rose: she reminded herself that her father had
been an emperor, and her brother at least had had the Imperial
pretension. There must be some way of meeting this atrocious
situation with dignity and pride...</p>

<p>"I cannot," she said, faintly, "be thus summoned into your
master's presence, I am the Archduchess Maria Luisa."</p>

<p>The valet had known this; her words, that she had thought so
brave, sounded to him but a feeble flourish.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell my master that you refuse to come down, Madame?"
he asked, negligently.</p>

<p>And she, debating with herself, thought in her anguish:
"Perhaps it is wiser for me to go...Perhaps I should face him,
not remain here&mdash;to be dragged, I suppose, in the end, into
his presence."</p>

<p>"Give me a toilet case, and ten minutes; and I will attend
your master at his supper," she said.</p>

<p>The valet withdrew immediately, and almost immediately
returned with a luxurious toilet case, which bore, as she
instantly noted, the arms of Kurland.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa snatched out the mirror and stared at herself, and
the bitterest of all bitter thoughts pierced her heart: "If I
were a beautiful woman, none of this would matter!" She was
contemptuous of her own pallid face, with the too full mouth and
the too light eyes, and that soft tumble of loosened yellow hair.
Her one charm, the inevitable bloom of youth, had been ravished
from her by fatigue and pain and fear.</p>

<p>Not beautiful, not charming&mdash;an awkward, terrified girl,
sick with fear and fatigue.</p>

<p>She combed and rolled her hair, and tied it with one of the
ribbons from her cravat. She made what adjustments she could in
her tarnished attire, and all the while she thought that if there
had been any manner of weapon there, she would have thrust it
into her bosom sooner than go down to General Crack; but there
was nothing, and she must try to hold her head high as she
followed the valet down the stairs..."If I had been
beautiful&mdash;only for this one night..."</p>

<p>The lackey opened a tall door for her, and instantly she was
greeted by the light seduction of brilliant music. The room was
splendidly lit; she was, for a moment, dazzled both by the music
and the circles of wax lights, and paused upon the threshold of a
light and elegant apartment, filled, as a vase may be filled with
pure water, with the throb and hurry of the melody which came
from two old men in Kurland liveries playing violins. They sat at
the foot of a bed, which was partially in an alcove and draped by
an imperial of silver mohair. The centre of the floor was bare,
and of a shining lustre that reflected the candelabra, crystal
and silver, with gauzy lights in them.</p>

<p>Thick velvet curtains were drawn across the night, and the
warmth banished all sense of winter. At the far end of this long
room was a huge fire, before which was set a supper table; and
there Prince Christian stood, leaning on the mantelshelf and
watching the door; he had a long clay pipe in his hand, but it
was not lit.</p>

<p>He did not stir as she entered, nor did the fiddlers take any
heed of her; all three seemed absorbed in the music, the wanton,
rich music. Her pride was now stronger than her cowardice. Under
cover of the melody, she crossed the gleaming floor, and dropped
her captor a curtsey as if she had met him at her brother's
court.</p>

<p>"It seems," remarked Christian, regarding her without
interest, "a long while since Brussels, and our last meeting
after the Opera, eh?"</p>

<p>"Longer to me than to you, Monseigneur, I dare say," she
replied, faintly, "since time drags heavily with the
unfortunate."</p>

<p>"We need not talk of misfortune to-night," he smiled. "Let us,
Madame, have our relaxations and diversions&mdash;as your brother
had in Ottenheim&mdash;sweet interludes to the fatigues of
war."</p>

<p>These words stormed the sinking heart of the Archduchess with
further fears. She did not know what they meant, nor even that
Leopold had ever been to Ottenheim. Enervated by terror, by
fatigue and by the lively and voluptuous music, she sank on to
the yellow sophy by the gorgeous fire.</p>

<p>Christian had put down his pipe, more, she felt, instinctively
than out of any courtesy towards herself; for she believed that
his intention was to insult her deeply.</p>

<p>"It is an atrocious chance," she murmured, "that has brought
me here." Then, quickly, "Will you not send your fiddlers away?
They confuse my mind."</p>

<p>"It is the music I take with Me," said Christian, "to distract
me when I am in a melancholy; and that is often enough."</p>

<p>In the blaze of light of the many candles she stared at him;
he seemed entirely changed. Though she had never known him, yet,
in some illusion of the fancy, she had been familiar with him;
but now that familiarity had vanished. She looked upon a
stranger, one who did not shape into any of her dreams, past
dreams in which he had, reluctant to her wish, figured.</p>

<p>The man had altered. Never before had she seen him save in her
brother's resplendent uniform; but now he was in armour over a
heavily braided coat, and that of a fashion strange to her, which
made him further alien to her frightened regard. He wore the garb
affected by the Kurlanders and Polanders in winter: blue velvet,
heavy with bullion and doubled with fine grey fur. She noticed
such gaudy details as pieces of armour lying on the floor, lined
with quilted orange satin; such trivialities as these stuck in
her mind; she was veiled with fatigue, and all her faculties
faltering. Again her fainting speech trembled on her lips, and
he, watching her, and unable to hear what she said, demanded what
her desire was, bending towards her to catch her words.</p>

<p>"My wish is narrow," stammered the Archduchess. "Only to be
allowed to depart...you must understand so much."</p>

<p>He asked: "Where is your brother?"</p>

<p>And she shook her shamed head.</p>

<p>"He flies like a hare," smiled Christian; "and like hare will
he be caught at last, exhausted, in his final retreat."</p>

<p>She was stung into some poor reply by the unutterable contempt
behind his words:</p>

<p>"I do not know the seat of all your malice," she said, "or why
you thus discard all manner of civility with me. God may not
forgive you for what you do!"</p>

<p>"I," smiled Christian, "have long ago resolved not to forgive
God."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa continued to stare at him, incredulous that this
was the man whom she had seen&mdash;the most sumptuous figure in
that sumptuous pageant in Brussels; much older he seemed now, and
darker, and there was a look of cruelty and scorn and hard
unhappiness in his face which she had never observed there
before. His exact features, with the vivid colouring that gave
his beauty so showy and glowing a turn, had still an impassive,
even a masklike, look; but it was a mask on which was set a
terrible expression. He made an impatient gesture towards the
musicians, and they ceased abruptly, hastily put away their
violins, and, bowing, left the room.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa realized how foolish she had been to demand that
they should go, for she was now completely alone with Christian;
there had been protection in the old men, even in the sound of
the music.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he asked with curiosity, "that your hand
was offered to me, Madame, last autumn?"</p>

<p>"Will you," she demanded, piteously, "further distress my
honour by referring to what is solely a humiliation to my
mind?"</p>

<p>"Humiliation?" he repeated. "Your brother did not consider
humiliation then; he considered his offer another subtle shift to
gain my services; but we will not talk of it, since it displeases
you."</p>

<p>"I have been all my life most unfortunate," said the
Archduchess, "enmeshed with words, trapped into pitfalls; in
every way scorned and abandoned. If my pride ever had any
aspiring, it is cast down now, and forever, I think. Monseigneur,
whatever your spite and malice against my House, is not this
enough for you? Cannot you have the pity to let me depart?"</p>

<p>"Where would you go?" smiled Christian; "the weather is wild,
the country racked and ruined."</p>

<p>"Anywhere!" she replied, wildly. "Let me but walk out into the
night&mdash;return to the barn where they found me.
Anywhere..."</p>

<p>"But you would perish. Are you not well housed here?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive you for your mockery and for your cruelty! I
at least have known no fault towards you!"</p>

<p>"Is it cruelty to keep you here for company?" he smiled. "It
is long since I have enjoyed the conversation of one so
exalted&mdash;an Archduchess: an Emperor's sister!"</p>

<p>Then, discarding his mood of mockery, he added, sombrely:</p>

<p>"Whether you will or no, you shall not go until the morning.
Then you may return to your brother and tell him where you have
spent your night."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," she stammered, "that you would force me to
remain here?"</p>

<p>"There was one thing that I thought an impossibility," he
answered. "I had, within a narrow space, a little heaven on
earth, and I thought it impossible that it should be defiled, or
even spied upon by other men. But that is gone!"</p>

<p>"I have not wronged you!" she murmured, in the extreme of
bewilderment and fear, shame and humiliation.</p>

<p>Christian laughed.</p>

<p>"The Caesar's sister&mdash;eh? A fair enough piece, by
candlelight! To-morrow you shall go where you will, sufficiently
escorted; to-night, you remain with me."</p>

<p>"And all your camp to know it?" she cried.</p>

<p>"There will be no secrecy," replied Christian, "as there was
none at Ottenheim."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa rose and clasped her hands upon her heart. She
felt the little metal image pressing into her bosom.</p>

<p>"Why do you keep talking of Ottenheim?" she said. "I do not
understand what you mean. Is not your wife there? Why have you
left her so long? She is of my age and my helplessness, she also
might be exposed to these incredible horrors of war. Can you
think of her and still deal with me so atrociously?" She was
further terrified by the effect of her words. Christian looked
ghastly: she thought that he would faint.</p>

<p>"There is something here I do not know," she muttered,
recoiling.</p>

<p>"You will soon know," he replied; "when I send you back to
your brother, he will tell you." Then he raised his voice, with a
dreadful effort at self-control. "Come, Madame, the supper is
set!" And he poured out two glasses of wine. "Here is a cordial
for your squeamishness: it is the Ausbruche vintage, made from
the spontaneous dropping of the grape&mdash;a virgin wine,
Madame, which will not long keep...eh?"</p>

<p>He drank, filling his glass again and again, as if he toasted
her mute anguish. "It is not every night one has an Emperor's
sister for company! And I have been very lonely of late, pestered
by dreams which seem to come from Hell."</p>

<p>"You have made the whole land a hell," she muttered; "a ruin
from which I think none of us can ever arise!"</p>

<p>"Can you help me dispel my dreams?" smiled Christian. "Perhaps
with you I might forget, for an hour or two of darkness, eh? Take
off your coat," he added, harshly. "The room is warm enough!"</p>

<p>And, as she stood immobile, he made a movement as if himself
to divest her of her heavy outer garment. At this, with instant,
nervous fingers, Maria Luisa unbuttoned the coat, and dropped it
on the floor, showing her long waistcoat and torn, embroidered
silk, and the ruffled shirt opened on the bosom. Here she put her
hand, driving the silver image into her flesh.</p>

<p>"When the reckoning comes," she asked, wildly, "what will you
say?"</p>

<p>"There is no reckoning," smiled Christian; "I hold my destiny
in the hollow of my hand."</p>

<p>She could no longer contain herself upright, but dropped back
onto the sophy, and hid her face in the cushions, like a child
chid and frightened to extremity; and still she thought, crazily:
"If I had been beautiful, no such harm; if I had not secretly
loved him, no such harm either! As it is, harm unutterable!"</p>

<p>Then pride overlaid these gusts of spontaneous passion, and
she recalled who she was, and to what position her brother had
aspired; what position her father had actually held, and within
what rigid rules and proud decorousness she had been upbrought:
no man allowed within nearer limits than the edges of her fan
flung outward. Her pure blood, her illustrious descent, the
galaxy of kings and princes and emperors among her ancestors had
been constantly brought before her attention. And this man,
before whom she crouched, was base-born! A rebel, an adventurer,
a mercenary soldier&mdash;son of an Italian Columbine.</p>

<p>It had been galling outrage to all her principles and pride to
know herself offered to him as a wife; and now she was in his
power, subject to his incredible cruelty. Never had she thought
of such a woman as herself, so bred, so placed, so protected,
being, by any possibility, subject to such an outrage. She had
never heard such tales of him, and she was sure that some
terrific change had taken place in him since last she met or
heard him spoken of; or had he always been a monster, and it been
masked from her, poor fool that she was?</p>

<p>She raised her head and laughed, in breaking control; and, as
she laughed, stared at him. He had come nearer, and was looking
at her harshly.</p>

<p>"You are too tired," he said, briefly. "You are overwrought;
will you not eat and drink and rest with me and take up these
troubles in the morning?"</p>

<p>He put out his hand to touch her, but in a second she was
away, and pressed hard and frantically against the smooth, white
wall.</p>

<p>"So hateful to you, eh?" he muttered, and looked her up and
down. "Did you know I was pursuing you?" he added. "For weeks
now, from place to place&mdash;always on your track; did you know
that?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "and why should it have been?"</p>

<p>"Because only through you can I balance my account with your
brother."</p>

<p>"What has he done?" cried Maria Luisa; and Christian, gulping
his wine, said:</p>

<p>"Ask him to tell you to-morrow."</p>

<p>He came slowly to the sophy from which she had just fled, and
sat down with heavy sullenness, and stared on the floor almost as
if he had forgotten her presence. Maria Luisa left the wall, and
came a little nearer to him, and looked at him; and her fright
faltered and vanished in her heart, giving place to another
passion&mdash;that of pity. She saw that this man, who had
appeared to her so dreadful, so atrocious, was in anguish. In his
pomp and pride, beneath the outward show of bedizened bravery,
the soul of the man was naked and in pain. She thought that his
case was as pitiful as hers, and she murmured, in a musing
tone:</p>

<p>"Why are we both so unfortunate?"</p>

<p>Christian turned at that, and looked up at her. Maria Luisa
crossed herself.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," she whispered, "God have mercy upon you!"</p>

<p>"Would that be your prayer for me?" he asked; and, catching
hold of her, drew her down on to the sophy beside him, she
unresisting. "To-morrow I think you will not hold me so gently in
your regard."</p>

<p>An extraordinary stillness filled the room. It seemed to Maria
Luisa as if the world had stopped about them. Through an opening
in the heavy, pale curtains, she could see the vivid comet in a
rift of the sombre snow-clouds, and all earthly things seemed to
dwindle to insignificance.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," she said, "if I were to tell you one thing,
would you let me go? I, too, have lost in love; I, too, have
found that love can sting. That is your case, I think!" she
added, simply, peering into his inscrutable face. "I believe that
the Princess Eleanora must be dead."</p>

<p>"I hope," whispered Christian, "that she is dead."</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h2>

<p class="first">MARIA LUISA did not answer that; at last she
knew what he meant, what it had all meant, from the day he had
ridden out of Frankfurt, a declared rebel; through all her
guarded pieties, her remote decorums, she had learnt what is the
one thing worse than death for a woman; and he wished that
Eleanora was dead, he who had paid such a high price for
her...and Leopold had coveted her...and taken her, behind this
man's back; foul, foul dishonour, thought Maria Luisa, giddy with
the shock of this fell discovery, and no marvel that they were in
the mire; what manner of pestilent sweet creature was this
Eleanora that such a downfall had been possible?</p>

<p>The long silence explained them to each other and explained
what was between them; now that she had realized his tragedy
Maria Luisa thought less of her own; even in her own eyes she
became unimportant; he rose, left her on the yellow soppy and
went to the supper table.</p>

<p>She stared at him drinking; he seemed to repress a shudder
every time the wine touched his lips; she noted, with a racked
tenderness the lavish prodigality of his appointments, how the
ransacked room had been transformed into a princely apartment by
his valets...often had she heard of his stupendous extravagance,
and now she beheld it; amid the ruin of war, he blazed with the
pomps of peace scattering and bedecking this meagre chamber; and
on every possible place, on crystal, on silver, on gold, on the
curtains, on the bed draperies, the arms of Kurland and the
circle of letters that spelt the too famous name, C. R. A. C. K.;
yet all this munificent bravery must be bottomless...even she
knew that a landless man could not long live at such a pitch; he
had no pensions, no revenues, no apanages; this was an odd
concern for her, at this moment, to make her concern...his
riches, his resources.</p>

<p>"You are moody," he said, "sullen, perhaps; will these change
your humour?"</p>

<p>He put his hand into his inner pocket, and brought out a
lustre of green tangled fire that caught up the brilliancy of the
flames on the hearth.</p>

<p>"Nothing so costly," added Christian, "but with cost can be
bought&mdash;do those induce your smiles?"</p>

<p>He tossed two gems to her that fell in the lap of her stained
habit; she saw two diamonds, one of exultant beauty, and
recoiled.</p>

<p>"They were hers," she stammered.</p>

<p>"And shall be yours&mdash;a fair price even for Caesar's
sister, eh?"</p>

<p>"All women cannot be bought;" she shook the stones to the
floor.</p>

<p>"No?" Christian picked up the diamonds and held them dangling
before the violent, leaping fire. "Yet there is enough here to
buy a deal of most commodities. That larger stone was purchased
with a regiment of men, it is named Mitau and in it I can see a
city&mdash;such as no one built yet, I think...vain life and
fruitless love made solid here, Madame, made durable&mdash;these
flashes illuminate no vulgar aspirings and no common
torment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kurland&mdash;to you?" she asked, with all her pity on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Olympus, say!" He laughed cruelly at himself. "I might as
well have desired that&mdash;and laboured to found an Empire in
sunset vapours. Kurland, always Kurland, Madame. I served France
for Kurland, but France had no power to wrest it to my grasp,
then your father, then the Queen of Hungary, always for
Kurland&mdash;always deluding deceits."</p>

<p>"Leopold would have given it to you," faltered Maria Luisa,
"had you not pulled him down; now that is lost."</p>

<p>"Have you not guessed that I could take nothing from him?" he
frowned. "Come, wear the jewels; somehow we'll strike the bargain
equal yet&mdash;perhaps he took them from her bosom&mdash;I'll
set them in yours."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa did not stir; she was hardly conscious of any
insult or outrage in what he said; she could not hold to rules of
speech or conduct now, isolated in this tragedy amid a torn and
tumbling world; what, in any turn of events, was before her;
negation, death, affront; she was nothing in this turmoil of
disaster.</p>

<p>If he could have loved her as he had loved Eleanora...she
would have given him no stinted measure of passion, of loyalty,
of adoration; ironic that she should dare to think this now that
she never dared to think before; she was enervated, almost drowsy
with the warmth of the room and repose after exposure and
toil.</p>

<p>And still he held the diamonds, the chain slipping between his
fingers, and stared into the flashing facets...the diamond named
Mitau with Kurland in its heart; looking at him, Maria Luisa
knew, by a delicate intuition that even in his agony he loved all
that glittered, that was of great luxury, that was resplendent
and of the extreme of pomp.</p>

<p>Surely he had forgotten her in that deep reverie evoked by the
cold fires of Mitau the diamond, now she might creep away; she
rose awkwardly, as if her limbs were cramped, and reached out a
shaking hand for her tumbled fallen coat; but on this movement
Christian turned at once.</p>

<p>"Not so easily. I must command your company."</p>

<p>"What," she replied, "can prevent me from leaving you?"</p>

<p>"Madame, a locked door."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa stood with her hand on the back of the yellow
sophy.</p>

<p>"You would not be so ignoble as to detain me,
Monseigneur?"</p>

<p>Christian smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Unfasten my gorget&mdash;I would not call a lackey in."</p>

<p>His intention was then, cold and deliberate insult; for that
purpose she had been brought here; the realization of this braced
her, dispelling alike her fears and her compassions.</p>

<p>"Does it gratify you," she asked, bitterly, "to make me your
servant? We have come to a base level."</p>

<p>"Madame, since I was wounded in the shoulder at Gobitz armour
has galled me, yet I learnt the habit of wearing it while in the
French service, and maintain it, as a matter of
discipline&mdash;to-night I had forgotten it, but now feel the
weight&mdash;will you unlace me?"</p>

<p>"If I did not think your intention was to humiliate
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You recall, perhaps, how first we met? A concert at the
Hofburg when I first came into your father's service, and you
were not sure if you should notice me&mdash;you looked away when
I was presented to you and would not give me your
hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you revenge that now?"</p>

<p>"Madame, I have better weapons than meagre discourtesies to my
hand. Even the Caesar's sister may relieve a tired man of his
armour."</p>

<p>"'Without humiliation," she replied, and crossed the room to
him, and, reaching up a little, unlaced gorget and cuirass, which
was black and gold inlaid and lined with leopard skin; she saw
the flames on the hearth reflected in the burnish of this dark
steel and curiously lingered with the weight of the heavy pieces
in her hands; a detestation for Eleanora overwhelmed all other
passions in her throbbing heart; these light false women whom men
must love...</p>

<p>Christian gave a movement of relief; the diamonds still swung
in his idle fingers.</p>

<p>"Will you not take supper with me now?" he asked. "I have not
entertained a woman of quality since I was in Paris, and have
forgot the devices that please&mdash;but delicate gentlewomen are
not so nice, I find, as I did consider them, therefore perhaps
you can endure my rusty manners."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," replied Maria Luisa, knowing this bitter
reference was to Eleanora, "you may stint these mocks, I know the
main blow you have had and the monstrous chance that sets me
here&mdash;will you not have done and suffer me to leave?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is not Count Hensdorff here&mdash;my father's friend?"</p>

<p>"Count Hensdorff would not stand between me and any purpose of
mine."</p>

<p>To give herself some employment for her trembling hands she
set the armour on the bed step, carefully, piece by piece, and
there she saw papers thrown down and the words on one caught her
frantic glance.</p>

<p> <i>Missal, 1<br> Crucifix, 1<br> Altar cloths, 2<br> Boxes of
Silver for the Wafers, 2</i></p>

<p>A list of chapel furniture; she remembered that he had
returned to the Faith.</p>

<p>"A priest," she asked, "have you not a priest in your near
attendance?"</p>

<p>"You and I," replied Christian, "will contrive without a
priest."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa sat down on the bed step, which was spread with a
Persian cloth, and stared down at the papers without now taking
in their meaning; she was enclosed, nothing of which she could
think would serve her now...to-morrow she could die, but how to
deal with to-night. The letters paraded before her staring
eyes.</p>

<p><i>Inventory of the Artillery of the Army of H. H. Monseigneur
Prince Christian, Duke of Kurland, signed by M. Clouet,
Lieutenant and Commissioner of the Artillery Park in the above
Army</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, she would read these avid lines while she fought for her
courage; there must be something one could do...always
remembering that she could die to-morrow...he had his back to her
now and was drinking slowly, staring down into the glass between
each draught as if he saw more than the wine there; like trim
soldiers those neat letters paraded...</p>

<pre> <i>Pieces of 33<br> <br> L'Inférnal   weight, 5920 armes,
Kurland, length 9h. 60 p.<br> L'Inexorable weight, 5860 armes,
Kurland, length 9h. id.<br> César        weight, 5880 armes,
Kurland, length 9h. id.</i></pre>

<p>Maria Luisa could read no more...these names were of too ill
an omen; it were better not to think, better, by some means, to
bring this black suspense to an issue; her silence only fed his
cruelty.</p>

<p>As she contrived to rise he had turned to look at her over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you study the list of my artillery, Madame? Those are
faithful guns which have forced many a city to
capitulate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, you have had sufficient triumphs to enable you
to be generous," she stammered; "think how you have reduced my
brother&mdash;taking from him an Empire."</p>

<p>"And yet the balance does not swing level. He took from me
more than an Empire."</p>

<p>"You rate her too high!" cried Maria Luisa, in a sudden
passion of scorn that caused him to look at her with more
interest than he had yet displayed.</p>

<p>"What do you understand of any of it?" he asked. "No doubt
neither she nor any other woman is worth much delay in this short
progress we have across the world, yet my loss is beyond your
computation."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Monseigneur. I am convent bred and not so long
accustomed to human affairs, yet I am not so foolish that you can
take me utterly for a trifle."</p>

<p>"This is bold," he said, negligently.</p>

<p>Maria Luisa came nearer to him where he leant on the
mantelpiece above the radiance of the lusty flames; round his
wrist he had hung the diamonds, a pale sparkle of green and azure
in the long ruffles.</p>

<p>"May I not ape some boldness now?" she asked haughtily, "since
it seems I am beyond all but pride&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have a royal spirit," remarked Christian. "Had you been
in your brother's place you might have held your father's
throne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had I been in your wife's place, I had set you on a throne,"
she said in the same tone. "We have each missed something,
Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"I, more than I can measure," he replied, curious of her air
of passion&mdash;"and you?"</p>

<p>"Everything," she smiled arrogantly, "and since the
first...bankrupt as I am, I cannot entertain you, Monseigneur,
now...once, had you asked it, I might most richly have endowed
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can still give me what I most value above riches,
revenge," he smiled, staring her down. "Set me again on the
Caesar's level, eh?&mdash;one woman for another&mdash;and perhaps
my account a little overpaid...she has an Emperor for her lover,
while his sister will have only General Crack."</p>

<p>"A lover?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I put it delicately...plainer since, you question the terms,
you shall be my bedfellow to-night&mdash;I think she was no more
than that to him, and these jewels, a foul wage paid in his
presence for a vile purpose, shall go back with you to
him&mdash;your price now, too."</p>

<p>Maria Luisa did not blench; fear was now as far from her as
hope.</p>

<p>"You frustrate yourself," she said. "I know you as you do not
know me. You cannot do it&mdash;and commend yourself
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"How many men would stay their hand?" he demanded insolently.
"And you please me well enough for a brief distraction even
though you were not the Caesar's sister."</p>

<p>"And you please me well enough for me to stay to-night, ay,
and many nights if&mdash;it would help you," she answered. "You
talk down your own heart; see, Monseigneur, I, too, speak
plainly, what is there now to hinder me?"</p>

<p>Christian, regarding her with intense scrutiny under frowning
brows, asked:</p>

<p>"You would stay willingly?"</p>

<p>"If I could help you...but I have more than my body to
give...perhaps she had, Monseigneur, we do not know."</p>

<p>Christian turned his head away abruptly.</p>

<p>"If you ever come to issues with her, remember that...maybe
there was more in it than gross wantonness...as for me, if you
loved me, or even desired me,"&mdash;she sighed, struggling with
a fainting breath&mdash;"I would not endeavour to be gone."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"What do I matter? I am so unimportant in a very world of
ruin, and I could die so easily. I would stay, to be your
mistress, before all the camp if it would avail you any comfort,
but I am nothing to you but an instrument of vengeance, you would
dishonour me coldly merely to degrade my brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You read me well," he said, bitterly and sternly.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow you would sicken at yourself and think Leopold
the better man."</p>

<p>Christian regarded her keenly as she spoke; he seemed absorbed
in what she said.</p>

<p>"You have a noble mind to speak thus," he pondered.

<p>"My mind is nothing, my heart speaks. I have always loved
you."</p>

<p>With an utterly careless triumph she watched him and saw a
slow colour come into his dark face, and his arrogant eyes falter
at last before hers and turn aside.</p>

<p>"From the day in the Hofburg," she added, "when you thought I
slighted you. But you...never mind now...we cannot help each
other...but never think, Monseigneur, that I was afraid...could
my embraces have given you five minutes' oblivion, I need not
have been forced to bestow them."</p>

<p>Christian did not answer; he untwisted the diamonds from his
wrist and laid them on the mantelshelf; Maria Luisa picked up her
coat and put it on; between the massive folds of the stiff
curtains she could see the smoky glare of the comet, low in the
formidable sky.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, will you not allow me to go?"</p>

<p>Christian appeared to rouse himself from deep brooding.</p>

<p>"I must see if there is accommodation in Altsdorf...perhaps
Hensdorff will know," he smiled, but not with his usual ease.
"You have the honours of this engagement, Madame, where I have
played the part of a general who serves without distinction and
retires without reward."</p>

<p>Slowly he crossed the room and unlocked the door.</p>

<p>"Let it end on a jest," said Maria Luisa. "I will forget your
intention if you will forget my confession&mdash;"</p>

<p>She came to the door wearily for all her gallant carriage.</p>

<p>"You took a sure way to free yourself," he replied, "with your
pretty invention, eh?"</p>

<p>"You'll never hear a clearer truth than you have heard
to-night," she said. "And you know it. And you do not care. And I
must endure that. Be satisfied that my pride aches as rawly as
even yours can."</p>

<p>Hensdorff was in the little outer room, dozing in a low chair
before a stove with a rug over his knees; he had been ailing
lately and tormented by rheumatism, and was fatigued by much
travelling and the hideous winter; his head nodded on his breast,
his pendulous, yellowish nose and sagging cheeks were heavily
outlined in the shadow of the lamp set on the bracket above his
head.</p>

<p>"So," thought Maria Luisa, "he would have drowsed
here&mdash;while I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Count," said Christian, "we have on our hands the
Elector's sister&mdash;since she rejects my
entertainment&mdash;where can we house her?"</p>

<p>"Eh, eh?" Hensdorff, startled, got to his feet; how old he
seemed, thought Maria Luisa, how old, and shrunk and feeble.

<p>"The Archduchess! I did not know whom you had within. Eh, eh,
the Archduchess!"</p>

<p>He stared from one to another.</p>

<p>"There should be a convent here," said Christian. "I saw one
on the hill. See she is taken there, Hensdorff&mdash;Father
Hesdin should be in the house, he will arrange it&mdash;Madame, I
could do no better for you if you were my own sister, for here we
are in the very seat of war&mdash;"</p>

<p>Still Hensdorff stared from one to another, and Christian
returned to his room, closing the door, as if he had already
forgotten both of them.</p>

<p>"You, shut in his chamber?" stammered the old man. "I did not
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am pleased you did not know," she replied with infinite
fatigue. "And yet there is no matter in that."</p>

<p>"He has not affronted you?"</p>

<p>"Only by sending me away," she said, with the most wistful
irony. "Will you not go in to him? There is a man in
torment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you noticed that?" he asked anxiously, and she saw
immediately that his concern was not for her, but only for
Christian. "One can do so little. If he would sleep...I have been
with him when he has lain on an inn table fully armed&mdash;I
sitting beside him to hold his hand...and then he has slept a
little..."</p>

<p>"Alas!" she whispered. "Alas!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Hensdorff, grimly, "it is an ill thing to see a
fine body tortured by a broken heart that cannot kill
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Maria Luisa wept without covering her face; the tears dripped
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Come," sighed Hensdorff, stretching for his cloak, "I must
see you to that convent&mdash;I hoped he had some woman with him
to-night who would have brought him some comfort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could I have done so, I would have stayed."</p>

<p>The old man heard this without surprise; values had lately
been altered for him also.</p>

<p>"And I would have let you," he answered, simply. "Come. God,
but it is cold!"</p>

<p>He had opened the door onto the lights of Altsdorf and the
dingy glare of the distant comet which pierced the menacing
clouds; the snow had ceased, but the cold was like an actual
presence abroad; Maria Luisa, wincing and shuddering before this
cold, turned her tearful gaze from the comet's supernatural glow
to the dim human illumination of the room behind.</p>

<p>"Go back to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my sledge is outside&mdash;they will take you to
the convent&mdash;there are other women there&mdash;take my
pelisse," he put it around her. "I will wait on you
later&mdash;it is better I should return to him, eh?"</p>

<p>He took her to the sledge, gave his instructions to the
driver, all hurriedly, nor did she speak again, huddled deeply
into the furs and rugs as if vanquished by the freezing air.</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff hastened back to Christian's bedchamber and
entered without ceremony; the young man had returned to the fire
on which he was carefully, and without interest, piling logs.</p>

<p>"A ghastly night," he remarked. "There seems no heat in fire
or wine to-night&mdash;to-night I could neither warm my hands nor
make myself drunk&mdash;that's fearful, eh, Hensdorff&mdash;a
cold sobriety on this occasion of all occasions."</p>

<p>The old man looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Still in that mood?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Thwarted again. I could not do it, though it had long been my
intention, but that goes with other things...I am too nice,
Hensdorff. I should have had to have been very drunk to have done
it&mdash;faugh! Maybe I missed something in that gentlewoman," he
added restlessly, "but one may not command one's
inclination."</p>

<p>"I think she would have been faithful," remarked Hensdorff.
"It seems a long time since I came to Ottenheim to offer her
hand&mdash;is that only ten o'clock?"</p>

<p>"I'll have the music back," said Christian, hurriedly. "Never
shall I sleep don't leave me&mdash;there are those inventories to
check&mdash;where did I put them? We've lost some guns since
then, I think, and yet I cannot do that now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's still Leopold," Hensdorff reminded him. "No need to
show pity there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pity? I have none." He swept the diamonds into his hand.
"See, I seemed to hold it all, like that, Mitau, Kurland, a
throne, wife, children, a family and universal honour&mdash;ah,
in the thunder of my youth all seemed so easily possible, I did
not find it difficult to dominate my fortunes&mdash;presumptuous,
eh? Hardly now can I believe how I have been frustrated."</p>

<p>"Not frustrated," muttered the old man.</p>

<p>"From the first. A base-horn, landless man, nameless too;
General Crack, eh? The butt and jest of every fool who was not
ashamed to name his mother. And yet, by God, I could have done
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do it yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that was a thrust brought all done&mdash;see my
aspirings, Hensdorff, here&mdash;" he held out his hand with the
diamonds on the palm. "A life's visions&mdash;all&mdash;all," he
added fiercely, then turned and cast the gems onto the flames;
"gone now&mdash;and some lackey will rake them from the ashes and
buy with them a world of gross delights!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>CHAPTER FORTY</h2>

<p class="first">NEVER had Leopold longed for any hour in his
life as he longed for the hour of his death. Served by both
ministers and generals who were reluctant and incompetent, and
neither admired nor believed in him, he had tasted nothing but
the bitterness of defeat since the day when Christian had risen
in rebellion against him; and, though the Allies held to the
armistice that Christian had wrung from them, his rival for the
Imperial Throne did not allow this opportunity of securing his
own pretensions to slip. The King of Prussia had returned to the
cause of the Queen of Hungary, and many of the German princes had
followed him.</p>

<p>Leopold of Bavaria, an Emperor without an Empire, a landless
and a harried man, scarcely knew the extent of his own
misfortune, or the scope of his losses on the vast field on which
he fought with his scattered and dejected forces, nor could he
tell which town held for him, nor which had been seized by the
enemy. He hardly knew who was friend and who was foe&mdash;only
that Christian had everywhere defeated him, and that the
Hungarians and those Austrians who were in allegiance to the
Queen of Hungary were falling upon him at every available point.
He had no government, and practically no army; even those two
generals disgraced by Christian&mdash;Fürth and
Olivenza&mdash;whom Leopold had released from their confinement,
had proved themselves utterly useless to support his broken
cause; the Duke of Olivenza had been trampled to death by his own
flying soldiery in a sharp retreat; and Fürth had retired
frightened to his own estate, there striving to retain some of
his spoils by entering into a correspondence with the Queen of
Hungary.</p>

<p>Looking abroad, Leopold could see nothing but ruin, and
scarcely knew which was his own ruin and which that of the enemy.
Always war had been to him monstrous&mdash;even incredible; now,
in the midst of this most ghastly and confused war, or, rather,
several wars woven into one, he felt himself the principal actor
in some hellish vision, where a horrid pageantry of death is
performed by fiends; the hideous weather was to him another enemy
in the field. To the waste and ruin wrought by man was added the
waste and ruin wrought by nature; and always, when the clouds
parted and there was a rift in the dun vapours of smoke and fog,
the sullen eye of the comet showed lurid in the pale winter
blue.</p>

<p>Perpetually gathering together remnants of his straggling,
starving and defeated army, Leopold fled from city to city, from
town to town, from fort to fort; while always behind him the Lion
of Kurland brought down the Lion of Hapsburg from bastion and
tower.</p>

<p>Father St. Nikola, who, with serene courage, remained faithful
to his master, and attended him in the most miserable of his
wanderings, offered some consolation by observing that the cause
of Christian was by no means as brilliant and triumphant as it
seemed.</p>

<p>"Europe," declared the Jesuit, "would certainly not long
tolerate such an upstart&mdash;a base-born, mercenary
soldier."</p>

<p>And it was well known that the King of Prussia had seized this
opportunity, in concert with Poland and Russia, to seize Kurland,
where Christian had believed himself about to be firmly
established, and where he took the title of Sovereign Duke.</p>

<p>"He may ravage the Empire," remarked the priest, "but the
Empire will fall on him and crush him in the ruins."</p>

<p>"And me also, I think!" said Leopold.</p>

<p>"You, Sire, are always the Emperor. You have the place of
power, true blood, unblemished descent: and these things he can
never get. Who would set <i>him</i> up in Vienna, or crown him at
Frankfurt? Even though his wanton and insatiable ambition would
be satisfied with no less!"</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer this. He knew that Christian had not
flung the country into the turmoils of this most dreadful war for
any ambition&mdash;not even for the ambition of seizing the
Imperial Diadem. His large, blue eyes stared helplessly at the
Jesuit.</p>

<p>"How long can this go on?" he asked. "How long before I am
finally defeated and slain? Every engagement I seek out death;
and still it flies before me."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said the priest, "God is protecting Your Majesty,
and it may be Prince Christian, and not yourself, who is finally
defeated. Not for ever will he be able to pay his soldiery,
particularly now the revenues of Pomerania fail; not for ever
will he be able to quiet his men with booty from lands so ravaged
that there is no more booty; not for ever can he feed his troops
through this most severe winter."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," replied Leopold, wildly and sullenly. "I tell
you, Father, I wish for nothing but the end...to get some peace
at length in the grave!"</p>

<p>The Jesuit had long since drawn from him, in secret
confession, the story of that night at Ottenheim; but never,
either to the Emperor or to any one else, did he make any
reference to this event; but now he said, indifferently and
almost casually:</p>

<p>"Sire, a dead man cannot marry the Princess Eleanora of
Anhalt-Dessau, nor appeal for the annulment of her marriage. I
think this lady," he added, carefully, "has the right to ask that
you should live."</p>

<p>Leopold did not reply, but turned away his face. Eleanora had
gone&mdash;was lost to him. Love and lust alike were quenched in
fear and dread and humiliation; he only remembered her as a man
for many years in a deep dungeon might remember some lonely star
he had chanced to see as he was led to perpetual blackness. So
incredibly remote, so unattainable, so overlaid by subsequent
darkness...remembered her coldly, sometimes with disgust...no
woman could be worth what he had paid.</p>

<p>Yet he wrote to her; on every possible occasion, by every
possible messenger, he sent secret missives to Ottenheim. She
never answered: he did not know if she got those letters or not,
nor even if she lived; for his last messenger, sent some weeks
ago, had not returned.</p>

<p>Nor did he ever have news from Anhalt-Dessau. That careful,
prudent, timid man had sided neither with his son-in-law nor with
his Emperor, but preserved, for a while, guarded neutrality in
his little province, shielding his own interests with a cautious
hand. He was furious alike with the rebellion of Christian and
with the weakness of the Emperor, and after a few weeks decided
not to join his fortunes with either one or the other, but made
his pact, as did so many of his fellows, with the Queen of
Hungary and her husband, who had now become rapidly the ascendant
party in the Empire. He, too, said in his narrow heart: "Leopold
is a weakling, and Christian is base-born. Neither of them will
be able to hold their ground." Nor could he forgive his
son-in-law for the part he had played, so unexpected and so
terrible...to Anhalt-Dessau and so many other men, so
inexplicable.</p>

<p>Leopold, then, did not know if Eleanora was alive or dead, and
he played with that thought, forgetting the presence of the
Jesuit, and wondering if he would prefer that she should be
living and waiting for him, or dead and at peace in the chapel at
Ottenheim. He could not believe that, even if she bloomed as she
had bloomed when he last saw her, there was any pleasure for
either of them in the years to come.</p>

<p>His sister, the Archduchess Maria Luisa, had lately been
returned to him by a troop of Uhlans bearing the white flag, and
delivered over to his care from General Knittelfeldt. He had
learnt, with the deepest of humiliation, of her capture by
Christian; but when he had questioned her as to the details of
this she had lied, and said that she had only seen, slightly and
at a distance, the Commander-in-Chief of the rebels&mdash;the
Duke of Kurland she had perversely called him.</p>

<p>Leopold had not believed her story. She was so cold and
distant to him, and he fearfully suspected that she had seen
Christian, and learnt the secret of the war. She had withdrawn
silently into a convent, where she was likely to be respected by
all the combatants; but Leopold did not feel at ease with regard
to his sister. When he had escorted her to her retreat, and
paused at the portal to see her limping away across the frozen
garth, she had not looked back. He felt himself locked out of the
heart of this, his only kinswoman; felt that she was hostile
towards him, and even wished him ill.</p>

<p>Thinking of these two women, both such images of torment,
these two lost women, Leopold began to speak, raging, as weak men
will, against destiny.</p>

<p>"Never," he declared, "did I desire to compete for the Empire.
I was thrust into this against my desire. I was given an
impossible work to do, an impossible place to hold. The times are
mean, corrupt and foul. Father, no man could succeed in such a
task as was laid on me."</p>

<p>"But one may," the priest reminded him, "fail with dignity;
and for me," he added, shrewdly, "I do not view Your Majesty's
affairs with so gloomy an eye. Prince Christian has been like a
thunderbolt upon the land, and like a thunderbolt he will flare
and smoke himself out to coldness and blackness. He has no just
cause, no just title. I have read much history, and never read of
a mercenary who long survived." The Jesuit, who had set his own
unfluctuating standards on no earthly battlements, spoke with
unblemished severity.</p>

<p>"If the spring would come!" muttered Leopold. "This weather,
this endless cold, this incessant fog and that accursed comet,
night after night!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it does not flare for us," smiled the Jesuit, "and I
believe it is now fading away, so the astrologers say. After this
month we shall not see it. If Your Majesty will look, you will
see that every night it is dimmer in the sky, and lower on the
horizon."</p>

<p>"Then," replied Leopold, fretfully, biting his full under lip,
"I do indeed think it typifies my fortune, for I am dimmer and
lower every night also, Father. I have no gift of government, nor
any gifts at all; and the burden put upon me I can no longer
shoulder."</p>

<p>The Jesuit glanced at him with a certain wise compassion.</p>

<p>Leopold looked ill, disarrayed; utterly overborne by anxiety,
fatigue and distress; he stooped and coughed frequently.</p>

<p>"Where are we now?" he asked, dully. He indeed scarcely knew,
so often did he move from one little, unimportant town to
another, as his retreating generals directed; and when the Jesuit
gave him the name of the insignificant hamlet where he was now in
refuge, it meant nothing to him.</p>

<p>"So many little towns and villages, and cities and forts
ruined and piled with dead and dying, neglected and abandoned,
red and black from fire; and I still live," he mused. "And I
should have been the first to die."</p>

<p>That night a further retreat was ordered before the advancing
forces of Christian of Kurland. He, like Leopold, had come to a
climax in his fortunes; the Jesuit was right when he had said
that the mercenary could not long sustain this expensive and
tremendous war. He had been hardly hit by the seizure of
Pomerania and his revenues by the Hungarians; nor was he able to
get through supplies from his loyal supporters on the Baltic,
where he held such profuse and considerable estates.</p>

<p>His men, though glutted with such frequent victory, and
dragging with them more booty than they could with ease carry,
were beginning to murmur at the continued hardships of the long
winter campaign. They wished for rest and repose, wished to enjoy
the fruits of their triumphs. They yelled for General Crack when
he led them into battle, but not so loudly when he paused in his
bloody progress, and plunder, and even food and forage began to
fail, and the icy dark gripped them tight.</p>

<p>Christian, great general and superb administrator as he was,
had foreseen this situation from the day he had ridden out of
Frankfurt. He listened with ironic disdain to the murmurers, and
continued to bear his ragged troops full on the pursuit of
Leopold. Nothing mattered to him but that; he had set himself to
get these two into his hands&mdash;Leopold and his sister. He had
captured the woman, but been forced to let her go; but there yet
remained the man, on whom to wreak his full revenge; so his
generals interpreted his design.</p>

<p>Some of the princes who had been attracted to his rebellion
standard by the lustre of his instant and brilliant successes,
now began to fall away. They too saw the disapproval of Europe at
this mercenary's triumph; they too saw the growing power of the
Queen of Hungary and her husband, the stolidity behind that
substantial claim.</p>

<p>How could Christian hope to wear the diadem? Or how could he
hope to serve any one else who did so? He was discredited with
all, an open rebel, playing insolently for his own hand; if he
would not sell his sword to some solid Power, he must, in time,
be demolished.</p>

<p>Christian saw his forces daily diminish, the princes, under
one excuse or another, riding home to their own estates and
provinces. He heard how Kurland had been seized, the roads there
blocked against him. Supplies failed in Pomerania, and neither
the Jews nor the Florentines were eager to lend him further
monies. He could not sustain himself and his army save by
perpetual pillage, and, as the Jesuit had told Leopold, no land
can be pillaged forever; nor even for very long, in the depths of
a severe winter, after years of warfare.</p>

<p>But Christian was not disconcerted or dismayed. He even
regarded the situation with that amusement with which a clever
man beholds the inevitable behaviour of the fools and knaves. All
of them scrambling over the ruins of the Empire after their own
lusts and greeds and jealousies, like vultures over a
carcass!</p>

<p>He alone held his one inviolable purpose, his one insatiable
desire; without pause or pity, his army pressed after
Leopold.</p>

<p>That night the exhausted Imperialists were defiling through a
barren wood, when the alarm was given that the rebels were close
upon their heels. One of Leopold's gentlemen, a Bavarian long
faithful to his house, seized his horse's bridle and tried to
lead the Emperor to safety through the trees, away from the
direct line of attack. But the steed was frightened by the first
discharge of the enemy's fire, which suddenly rent the frozen
air; and plunged, and galloped away down the forest path, bearing
Leopold out from the scattered, bleak trees into the dreary
darkness of a swamp, half coated with black ice.</p>

<p>Leopold endeavoured to direct the horse, but it took its own
frightened way, and stumbled over some stones, and threw Leopold,
who, entangled in his travelling cloak, fell into the swamp, half
choked with ice and mud. Here he was overtaken and captured by a
squad of the Black Cuirassiers, commanded by Banning, now a
Colonel in Christian's army. The Swede had seen the black and
silver, the Hapsburg lion and Imperial eagle on the caparison of
the stampeding horse, and guessed the rank of the man he helped
to drag from the icy swamp, by the uneven lantern light which
picked out the gleam of lance and bayonet from the icy dark.</p>

<p>"The Elector of Bavaria!" he cried, in heavy delight,
recognizing even here and now that notable face.</p>

<p>Leopold, sick and giddy, endeavoured to dash the mud and ice
from his face and clothes; he was shaken and his arm had been
wrenched. Banning respectfully demanded his sword, but Leopold
unbuckled his weapon, and, with a peevish, passionate gesture,
cast it into the marsh. He wished, feverishly, that he had had
the courage to plunge it into his bosom, as he had been told by
his tutors, once when he was a boy, the old Romans used to do in
the moment of defeat; as he had seen them do, in mimicry, on the
stage of the theatre in the Hofburg; thereby cheating the enemy
of his desired triumph. But Leopold could not do this. He watched
dully and shivering while Banning picked the sword out of the
mud, and heard the Swede remark drily that it was more honour to
deliver one's weapon to a brave soldier than cast it away into
filth.</p>

<p>One of the troopers had now recovered Leopold's horse, and
taken the pistols from the holsters. Leopold was desired by his
captors to remount; Colonel Banning gave him a handkerchief, with
which to wipe his face. There was a cold moon overhead, mounting
past bitter snow-clouds; and by the light of this, Leopold, with
a trembling hand, removed the mud from his person, shaking the
flakes of soiled ice from his mantle and tarnished
field-marshal's uniform, and put his pale hair back from his
brow.</p>

<p>Banning gazed, with almost incredible pleasure, at those
familiar features: the large blue eyes, the long, smooth, pale
face, the heavy jaw and full under lip; yes, this was really
Leopold of Bavaria, whom Christian had crowned in Frankfurt, who
called himself the Emperor; and with his capture the climax of
the war and of all their fortunes had been reached. The Swede
thought that now his master would press on to Vienna, and
proclaim himself the Caesar of the West; and among the Caesar's
most cherished servitors he saw himself&mdash;capturer of this
rightful Emperor; for rightful he seemed to Colonel Banning, who
looked at him and spoke to him, not only with respect but with a
certain awe. Defeated and in the last extreme of humiliation
Leopold might be; but, to Banning, he was the Hapsburg, the man
of unblemished descent; he was all that Christian could never be,
even to his own most faithful soldiers.</p>

<p>Leopold, sunk in the apathy of despair, asked them sullenly
where they were taking him; and they replied: "To Prince
Christian; to the Duke of Kurland."</p>

<p>At these titles, Leopold laughed.</p>

<p>"To General Crack," he sneered.</p>

<p>The Imperialists had now all fled, utterly routed; nor did the
rebels follow them. Once Christian had learnt of the capture of
Leopold, he had no purpose in any pursuit, nor, indeed, in any
further continuance of the war.</p>

<p>He took up his quarters in a small, abandoned country house,
and bade Leopold to be brought into his presence. Thus the two
men, who had parted before the banquet in Frankfurt, met
again.</p>

<p>Leopold, who felt he had nothing further to endure, who had
tasted every variety of anguish, who had fallen as low as it was
possible to fall, maintained an indifferent demeanour.</p>

<p>Christian had just dismounted from his horse. He wore his fur
pelisse, and the resplendent barred uniform with the Orders of
Poland and Russia glittering on his breast; the highest honours
of the countries now leagued against him. As always, he had set
off his dark, theatrical, flashing good looks with every care and
splendour of appointment; not a speck of dust, not a wrinkle
defiled the labours of his tailors and valets. His hair was
curled as if he had been at Versailles, but not powdered; for the
first time Leopold knew how dark he was and hated him deeper for
that&mdash;Neapolitan gutter born.</p>

<p>General Crack held himself with impassive military stiffness,
and did not remove his cockaded hat when Leopold, bareheaded, was
brought into his presence. He spoke the mocking words that he had
spoken on that day which now seemed so long ago to both of them,
in the garden of the Chateau at Dürsheim.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Caesar!"</p>

<p>Leopold silently leant against the wall, folding his arms upon
his breast; behind him was a cracked mirror, and he observed,
with horrid curiosity, how his colour, his fatigue, his
dishevelment, was reflected there in the glittering fragments
that still stuck in the gilded frame. The house had been wrecked,
and smashed ornaments lay among the broken furniture. The only
light was that given by a lantern, that had been placed on a
ruined table close to Christian, and by the fire, crackling on
the desolate hearth, which had been hastily lit.</p>

<p>Christian commanded the soldiers to leave them, remaining
alone with his prisoner.</p>

<p>"What would have been my fate," he asked, quietly, "if I had
fallen into your hands?"</p>

<p>Leopold, sick with hate, answered, immediately:</p>

<p>"I should have had you taken out and shot, as the rebel and
traitor that you are! And with a gag in your mouth&mdash;exactly
as you gagged Gabor."</p>

<p>"Then," smiled Christian, lightly, "you can expect no less a
fate from me."</p>

<p>"I expect nothing," remarked Leopold, haughtily. "For me life
has long since been at an end."</p>

<p>"But, Monseigneur," replied Christian, "you would have rather
died in some other way than be shot in a ditch, by my
orders."</p>

<p>Leopold winced; a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He
found himself hoping frantically that he would have the courage
to put through his fate with dignity; but he was so chilled and
fatigued and despondent, and he supposed it would be now, before
he was able even to wash the mud-stains from his person: now, in
a filthy ditch, while he was cold and hungry and weary, without
the strength to hold his head up. Well, Christian would have his
lust of revenge! That night in Ottenheim had been highly paid
for...Surely for no other woman would any man have paid such a
price...Implacable and inflexible, Christian stared at him.
Leopold could see, even in this rough light, that the handsome
face was not so unlined and unshadowed as it once had been; but
it was as impassive, and changed by the frame of that black
hair.</p>

<p>"So," mused Christian, softly, flicking his fur gloves against
his thigh, "I can set you up and pull you down as I please,
Caesar; and what pleasure is there in it, after all?"</p>

<p>Leopold replied, through clenched teeth, to keep his full lips
steady:</p>

<p>"Yourself also you have set up and will pull down. Do you
think, General Crack, that your career can long continue? Even if
you murder me to-night, there are other men who will hound you
out of the Empire."</p>

<p>Christian repeated one word out of this tremulously defiant
sentence.</p>

<p>"Murder!" he said, softly. "Murder! And what have you
murdered?"</p>

<p>This was the only reference that he made to Eleanora. Leopold,
leaning against the wall to steady himself, flung out:</p>

<p>"What I did, I was driven to do. I warned you not to press me
too far, but you were not warned."</p>

<p>Christian continued to stare at him long and curiously, with
dark, blank, impassive eyes, across the coarse red glow of the
lantern light, the coarse red glow of the crackling firelight,
that filled, brightly and more brightly, the devastated trivial
room.</p>

<p>"I could hang you," he mused, "as they hang the pilferers, or
have you tortured, as the peasants torture the stragglers, or
burnt, or maimed, or blinded&mdash;any of these things I could
do&mdash;there is no one to stay me, eh?"</p>

<p>"As you are an outlaw and a rebel," panted Leopold, leaning
still more heavily against the wall, "it is in your power to do
all that you boast of being able to do."</p>

<p>Christian did not speak; he gazed, brooding, across the meagre
lights as if he were alone, and, after a horrid pause, Leopold
flung out:</p>

<p>"Whatever you inflict on me, and however I endure it, it will
make no difference to our several stations, General Crack."</p>

<p>But he shrank and shivered so before the thought of what might
be closing in on him that he scarcely could hold himself upright.
He had always been most sensitive to physical pain, though his
courage was not mean; and his blood was icy at the thought that
he might not be able to maintain his dignity, but be reduced to a
shrieking, raving coward...perhaps, if they tortured him, to
scream for mercy...was it possible that they would torture
him?</p>

<p>Leopold had little hope that Christian would forbear the
extreme of torment. The man was lawless, desperate, and well
renowned for hard cruelty. Had he not let loose this war, with
all its ruin and death and horror, for this one moment? Leopold
knew that, and expected no shred of mercy.</p>

<p>Christian looked him up and down with those cold, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, quietly, "you always will remain a Sovereign
Prince of Imperial descent; and I shall always be the bastard of
the Duke of Kurland."</p>

<p>He turned down the wick of the oil lamp, which was beginning
to smoke and stain the horn sides. As he performed this task, he
said, without looking round: "Had you lived"&mdash;and he spoke
as if he addressed a dead man&mdash;"had you lived, would you,
with fortune, have married her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Leopold, sullenly. "My agents at Rome already
work for the annulment of that Lutheran ceremony."</p>

<p>"That labour is needless," replied Christian, over his
shoulder. "There will be no occasion for such an annulment."</p>

<p>"Is she, then, alive?" asked Leopold.</p>

<p>"Why should she be dead?" replied Christian.</p>

<p>"Women have died of such things," said Leopold; and Christian
answered:</p>

<p>"Does it matter to you?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely now," whispered Leopold, bitterly, thinking of his
own death so near. "Believe me, scarcely now!" put his hand to
his heart, suddenly so faint and giddy that he could scarcely see
the imposing figure that faced him. "I was riding all night," he
murmured. "If I could, before&mdash;before anything that I have
to face, have a glass of wine, and half an hour to myself, would
that be asking too much?"</p>

<p>"You are like your sister," said Christian, indifferently. "I
would have you at no disadvantage&mdash;you shall have all the
entertainment you desire."</p>

<p>Leopold straightened himself against the broken mirror. "No,"
he said in a louder tone, "I will, after all, take nothing from
you."</p>

<p>"As you wish," replied Christian with the same negligence as
before, and he continued to gaze without expression at his
prisoner, till the frayed nerves of Leopold could endure it no
more, and he cried out, almost on a scream:</p>

<p>"Why do you stare at me so? Cannot you make an end of
this?"</p>

<p>"Very soon, indeed." Christian took off his hat, and his
darkness, the black hair and brows and eyes, gave him an
appearance almost Eastern in the loathing regard of the man who
watched him with such painfully concealed fear. "I," said
Christian, without passion, "could have beaten you at anything,
work or play, man to man; I took vast pains, Monseigneur, to
learn to beat any one at anything, nor did I find it difficult.
Scarcely have I met my peer."</p>

<p>"You do well to boast now," replied Leopold, bitterly, "when I
am disarmed before you."</p>

<p>"I speak as a matter of curiosity, not of arrogance," smiled
Christian. "Do you think that I am concerned to flourish now? I
say I could have bested you, or any other at any task or any
game; ay, with any woman either&mdash;given fair play,
Monseigneur, given fair play. It is no dishonour to lose when one
plays with a cheat."</p>

<p>"You prove yourself ignoble by these insults."</p>

<p>"No," answered Christian, quietly, "not insults&mdash;merely a
comment. What would you, Monseigneur, call one who bought
something and paid the price, then, while he was enjoying his
purchase, stole, behind the other man's back, what he had
paid?"</p>

<p>Leopold did not answer, nor lower his gaze.</p>

<p>"And with such circumstance that he covered the man who
laboured for him with ignominy, with ridicule," added Christian;
then, in a gust of passion: "Where was your fine breeding there,
you vapouring fool? You must leave the window open...you must
expose her before a blackguard...I had not done it with a slut of
the camp...but you, so nice, so squeamish, must make her as
public as a drunken trull."</p>

<p>Leopold could no longer maintain his composure; he put his
hand before his eyes and turned away his head; Christian, noting
this, spoke again in a level voice.</p>

<p>"I shall command myself, believe me I can do it, even that,
Monseigneur&mdash;in this moment command myself. Once I lost my
temper and struck a man, only once did I demean myself to that
futility."</p>

<p>Leopold, summoning all his forces, made an effort to dominate
the moment.</p>

<p>"I should have been better advised," he said, coldly, "than to
employ you; that traitor Hensdorff overpersuaded me. I might have
known, yet you have played a lunatic part too, for I would have
given you Kurland, had you not pulled me down, but now you will
get nothing&mdash;even," he added, speaking rapidly, "if your
soldiers should make you the Caesar, how long will it last? Some
one will surely murder you as you intend to murder me."</p>

<p>"If De Lisle had permitted, you'd have arrested me, before I
left Frankfurt, eh?"</p>

<p>"I would indeed," replied Leopold, violently. "Had I had the
power I would have had you shot&mdash;even as you shot Ferdinand
Gabor. By God, I always hated you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Christian, staring at him, "yes. And you will hate
me deeper yet. I should have been shot, eh? You'd have liked
that&mdash;to see me shot like a deserter?"</p>

<p>"Ay," answered Leopold, "I should have liked that, General
Crack."</p>

<p>"And if," asked Christian, unmoved, "our places were reversed
now?"</p>

<p>"We should not be talking here&mdash;before now I'd have had
you silenced&mdash;with earth in your mouth&mdash;why don't you
so silence me and have done with it?"</p>

<p>"But I," said Christian, "have already reminded you that I can
beat you&mdash;in everything, Monseigneur; revenge would please
you, you would have me dispatched with ignominy, so to settle
your account of hate, but that would not satisfy me."</p>

<p>"He intends torment," thought Leopold in horror.</p>

<p>Christian crossed to the door, opened it, and spoke to the
soldier outside. Leopold heard what he said, in that soft, level,
steady voice. "Prepare a decent chamber for the Elector of
Bavaria, and see that there is some refreshment for him. I
believe that the baggage wagons are already up, and there should
be some fair service." Then he turned slowly back, and picked
something up that had lain beyond the lantern in the shadow on
the table; and Leopold saw that it was his own sword, which he, a
few hours ago, had flung into the morass with rage and despair in
his gesture. Christian was glancing at this as he spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Come and take up your sword, Monseigneur; a little soiled,
perhaps, a little fouled, but still, your sword."</p>

<p>He held out the ornate weapon, and Leopold, reluctant,
frowning, came and took it and buckled it on with clumsy
fingers.</p>

<p>"I am indebted to you for so much courtesy," he flung out.</p>

<p>"Be a little further indebted," smiled Christian, "take up
your life, your throne, your Empire. I am satisfied that I could
win them all&mdash;but they are none of them any value to
me."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," faltered Leopold, flushing painfully,
gripping the restored sword with nervous fingers.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I said I could beat you at any game, eh? There are
better ways of dealing with one's enemies than shooting them in a
ditch. Monseigneur, begone and take your rest." He stared full at
Leopold with eyes at once intent and expressionless.</p>

<p>"You have me utterly defeated," stammered Leopold.

<p>"From the first," replied Christian. "Monseigneur, we have
nothing more to say to each other."</p>

<p>An officer had entered, and Leopold, on this stranger's entry,
stayed his broken words, his whole being leapt at the realization
that he was not to die, yet shrank in disgust at the manner of
his escape.</p>

<p>On the threshold he hesitated, but Christian had now turned
his back on him and appeared engrossed in some papers he
held.</p>

<p>Leopold followed the Uhlan officer from the room.</p>

<p>When he knew himself alone Christian turned and without a
change of countenance set his papers on the table, and checked
them, one to the other, with a pencil.</p>

<p>When he had finished this, he straightened himself, sighed,
and muttered, half aloud:</p>

<p>"Hardly anything left to do now, hardly anything."</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night Christian dashed out the brand of his
rebellion as violently and indifferently as he had lit it.</p>

<p>To his assembled captains he declared ironically that he had
served his purpose now, and that they might go home, or continue
the war upon their own, as they wished.</p>

<p>"You were all fighting for your own ends," he remarked, "and
you have all of you been well paid. I think you are full-fed with
plunder and prizes. It is not my intention to take you to Vienna
and make you the jackals at my coronation. I have done. Leopold
of Bavaria is in the camp, and you may take him again for your
Emperor if you will. I know," he added, ironically, "that I but
anticipate your own decision, for you would have me either make
myself Emperor, or be devoured by you: there is no middle course
in such a career as that on which I have embarked. But now I bid
you all farewell. There is food and money in the camp, and pay
enough for all. You are disbanded from my allegiance, and I
recommend to you Leopold of Bavaria."</p>

<p>The princes and officers whom he addressed were smitten into a
fury of confusion, but, when this had a little passed, they were
inclined to congratulate themselves on the fact that General
Crack had removed himself from their presence before they were
forced to remove him.</p>

<p>"He is very experienced and wily," they smiled, one to
another. "He knew he could not hold his position, and now he has
thrown it up;" and they decided, without too much deliberation,
to put up Leopold of Bavaria in his place. What were they without
some head&mdash;some puppet? It was unthinkable to disband these
fine armies, who, after all, would more willingly serve the
rightful anointed emperor than the adventuring mercenary.</p>

<p>Some, however, argued with Christian, and entreated him still
to lead them, and to crown himself after seizing Vienna, which,
they declared, he easily could do. It was folly, they declared
hotly, to throw up everything at the moment of supreme triumph.
Leopold must be sent to prison, or even by more direct means got
out of the way. But even these men agreed that it must be one or
the other&mdash;Leopold or Christian. Christian had gone too far
ever to serve another Emperor again. He must himself hold the
Empire or abandon it. "I abandon it," replied Christian to these;
"I leave to-night, with those few of my personal soldiers, my own
Uhlans and Cuirassiers, who choose to follow me; and I ride to
Kurland."</p>

<p>"But this," they cried in unison, "is staring madness! Poland,
Russia and Prussia alike sit tight in Kurland!"</p>

<p>"It is my country," replied Christian, "and I go to redeem it
from the enemy."</p>

<p>And before that dawn, while they were yet all too amazed,
agitated, bewildered and overcome to do much in the way of
protest or agreement, Christian had kept his word. He had
gathered together his own troops of Uhlans and Cuirassiers, men
who had been in his direct service and personal pay during all
his fortunes, and he had left the bulk of the army encamped about
the forests and the swamps, and ridden away northwards. Before he
had left, he had spoken to Hensdorff, going to the bedside of the
old man in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>He had told him that his former master, Leopold of Bavaria,
was asleep in this very house, exhaustedly asleep.</p>

<p>"When he wakes," added Christian, "I think he will hear
himself hailed 'Emperor' again. These men have no one else to
whom to turn, and now I have laid down the command, they must
have some one to take it up. You will come in well in that
affair, my dear Count; you are both adroit and tactful." He
remarked, standing there holding back the plain bed curtains of
the modest bed, lit only by the candle he himself carried.</p>

<p>"See also to the marriage, my dear Count&mdash;the marriage
with Princess Eleanora."</p>

<p>Hensdorff, old and smitten, cried out, asking what he meant,
but Christian said:</p>

<p>"You will understand without any words of mine. Goodbye, my
dear Count; and thank you for your services!"</p>

<p>Count Hensdorff, in terror, asked him where he went, and he
replied to him, as he had replied to the others:</p>

<p>"I go to Kurland, my native place."</p>

<p>"You fling away the whole campaign?" cried Hensdorff,
bewildered.</p>

<p>"The whole campaign!" repeated Christian. "I fling away the
whole war, the whole Empire! The diadem itself, perhaps. Help
your Leopold to pick them up!"</p>

<p>Hensdorff did not know what to reply to such words as these.
He sat up, old, wizened, shivering, in his bed, gazing up at
Christian, who paused for a little with the candle in his hand,
holding back the curtains and staring down at him. And the old
man thought that Christian's dark beauty, so arrogant, so
bedizened, so steady and so inflexible, had in it something that
passed humanity. He stared up at the young man as if he stared at
something supernatural.</p>

<p>"You are not leaving now?" he muttered. "You will wait till
the morning?" and his old voice took on a pleading note. "You
will not ride away like this, on this sudden resolution?"</p>

<p>Christian said: "I go at once." Then he added the last words
that Hensdorff expected to hear him say. "Give my duty and
salutations to the Archduchess when you see her next, and find
her, my dear Count, a good husband."</p>

<p>The old man reached for his bedgown.</p>

<p>"You shall not go like this," he protested. "I must come, too,
wherever you go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, your loyalty is to the House of Bavaria, and the Elector
is in the camp&mdash;he will need you&mdash;but I, no one."</p>

<p>Christian spoke indifferently and as if his mind was not on
the moment; he put out his hand with an easy courtesy to stay the
old man who had flung on his bedgown and risen.</p>

<p>"No, my dear Count, consider your age and
infirmities&mdash;neither of which could endure such an
expedition as I propose."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" demanded Hensdorff, resolutely.

<p>"To Kurland."</p>

<p>"Good God&mdash;and what do you think you will get in
Kurland?"</p>

<p>"All I can now get anywhere&mdash;a little space."</p>

<p>"A grave," thought Hensdorff, but he did not say the word,
only: "How many do you take with you?"</p>

<p>"My own household troops."</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head; he seemed even older without his
peruke, the candlelight gleaming through his fine, thin white
hair.</p>

<p>"How have you dealt with Leopold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I commanded myself," replied Christian. "Yes, I did it,
Hensdorff. I think I have never done a more difficult thing and I
have been always fond of difficult things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;your revenge?"</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as revenge," said the young man,
carelessly, then he laughed, the candle flame fluttering with his
breath; he seemed really amused. "Did I not say that I would
never live to thirty without an establishment!"</p>

<p>He turned away, but Hensdorff had caught his hand.</p>

<p>"I must come, too. You'll be damned lonely in Kurland and I
damned lonely here&mdash;I might make you Duke in good
earnest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leaving your Caesar?"</p>

<p>"Curse Leopold," replied the minister, angrily. "I'm your man
and you know it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sat down and began to pull on his clothes.</p>

<p>Christian, glancing at him curiously, remarked:</p>

<p>"How you disliked me once. Do you recall how we met in
Ottenheim, you were scarcely civil&mdash;it's odd, you know, my
dear Count, for I have not changed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm coming with you," repeated Hensdorff, obstinately, but
Christian, smiling, shook his head and turned away. Hensdorff,
half clothed, saw the little candlelight diminish, heard the
steady footfall disappearing, heard the door close, and cried out
childishly: "Wait for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught up his pistols, his money, and ran to the
door&mdash;too late; already the cavalcade was leaving the
village street; he did not know their destination; never could he
overtake them; Hensdorff flung down his money and arms in
disgust.</p>

<p>"He is a ruined man!" murmured the minister to himself. "He
has flung everything away. He has nothing left." Musing a moment,
Hensdorff added: "If I were not so old I'd follow him...if he had
waited a little I'd have gone with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Christian did not turn immediately to his distant and almost
inaccessible goal of Kurland. Instead, he rode towards the river,
the Danube, which he reached towards the cold winter dawn, and
followed his course towards Ottenheim. He had no more than a
thousand men with him, all of whom were volunteers and who had
come on the understanding that they were to hold their lives as
cheaply as he held his. Everything was to be staked in a
desperate attempt to assert his sovereignty in Kurland, now
occupied by Russians, Prussians and Polanders.</p>

<p>Christian had not explained his plans to any of them&mdash;not
even to the little group of officers who rode behind him; nor did
they grumble. Most of them had followed him since he and they
were boys together in Flemish trenches, and they asked nothing
better than to serve him to the end. General Crack was to them
the beginning and the end of all.</p>

<p>These men, all cavalry, and tried, experienced, veteran
soldiers, well equipped, well fed, and in every way in excellent
condition, soon made their way by forced marches through the
deserted country, where no one troubled them. The enemy bad not
fortified the Danube. Châteaus, villas and villages on the
sullen, wintry river were alike deserted. There were armies
behind them, in Germany, and armies before them, in Hungary and
round Vienna; but here, desolation. Christian had expert foragers
among his troops, and these were able, even out of this dreary,
neglected waste, to procure sufficient provision, taken with what
they had brought with them, for men and horses, each man being
his own pack-horse, while they were followed by a small train of
artillery and baggage wagons. Not many days after he had left his
main army and Leopold, Christian came in sight of the Emperor's
Château of Bosenberg, in the woods on the banks of the Danube,
which was now entirely neglected, the valets left in charge
having fled, with what property they could make away with. The
times were too uncertain, and the future looked too dark, for
them any longer to care to risk their lives in these solitudes,
guarding these unprotected treasures.</p>

<p>Christian, whose patrols had returned to him with this news of
the desertion of Leopold's Château, at once took possession of
the palace, and quartered his men in the immense rooms, and put
up his horses in the huge stables; such as could not find
accommodation within the building&mdash;and these were not
many&mdash;were placed under pavilions set up in the forlorn
park. There was still a good store of provision here, and a fine
cellar of wine laid down by the late Emperor; and the troops,
though noticing that this was well out of the route to Kurland,
were well pleased with such a luxurious halt. Christian
immediately left the final arrangement of the camp to his
officers, and mounting, took the road to Ottenheim, remembering,
as he did so, that this was the exact road, step by step, that
Leopold must have taken before him, from Bosenberg to Ottenheim,
on a winter's day.</p>

<p>There was no change in his dark countenance as he rode across
the dreary winter landscape, where everything seemed filmed by
ice, and to bear an aspect so barren that any promise of a spring
seemed a futile delusion.</p>

<p>Grand and imposing, the full stream flowed beneath its rugged
banks, and Christian turned his gaze on it long and steadfastly,
remembering how he had always loved the Danube&mdash;loved the
river better than he had loved any man. The grand sweep of water
was as peaceful as it had been when he last saw it, before
fierce, unnatural feuds had shamed the altars and defiled the
hearths of the Empire. The long-continued scenes of bloodshed had
not reached these banks, nor all the foul terrors of battle been
reflected in these indifferent waters. Unchanged were these dusky
precipices, fringed by trees, now leafless against a grey sky;
they were as they had then been when bloomy with gold and emerald
against a blue sky. All the ignominy of colossal war had not
disturbed the proud swell of the Danube.</p>

<p>With slackened rein, Christian rode ever nearer the edges of
the stream, for here the path wound down between the lofty
cliffs, and almost touched the wavelets of the river. So dark,
gloomy and sombre was the evening, in this last twilight of a
bitter day, that Christian found himself recalling an old story
which he had forgotten since his boyhood&mdash;a tale which made
these banks haunted ground; the tale of Otto of Wittelsbach, who
had murdered the Emperor and was here slain himself, his dark
head being thrown into the river, while, for nine years swept by
the wind and washed by the rain, his cursed body lay unburied.
For days (so the awful tale ran) the head of the traitor had not
sunk or moved down with the current, but had floated there,
gnashing its teeth and fixing its glaring eyes, and waving its
clotted locks to the horror-stricken spectators; until the Black
Friar had appeared, with a gigantic cross in his hand, made of
wood which the Imperial eagle had brought from the true Cross of
Calvary, and dared to address the hideous, floating, living head,
conjuring it to return to the Hell whence it had come. Then,
while the voice of Death chanted a ghostly dirge in the storm,
the head had whirled round, shaken its massive tresses with
menace at the Friar, and sunk in a circlet of blue flames, which
(the fearful declared) were still often seen floating above the
water, on this very spot.</p>

<p>Christian smiled to himself at such a tale coming to his mind
at such a moment. It must be, he thought, because he had done
with the world, and, like a child, was free to amuse himself with
fancies because he had no further cares.</p>

<p>As he approached his own estate, he noted how negligently it
had been kept. He had been too long away, and the most faithful
of stewards will grow laggard in the master's prolonged absence.
The exotic trees and flowers were all withered in the parterres
and on the terraces. He passed the menagerie, and saw that the
cages and stables were closed. Those delicate and expensive
beasts were dead, no doubt; and dead those birds also, that he
had been so pleased to see fly among the leafy trees.</p>

<p>Every one here would be doubtful about his return; they would
all know the cause of the civil strife he had kindled; they all
would know of the visit of Leopold to Ottenheim, honour and
credit alike blemished, the lewd grins of lackeys would have
found matter for relish, yes, they had all grown careless; he
marked a plantation of young trees that had been allowed to
perish.</p>

<p>"Splendour soon fades, and requires a constant replenishment,"
he reflected, as he rode up the main avenue unobserved in the
twilight; for he had avoided the guarded outer gates, and taken a
way up from the river known to few besides himself. He fastened
his horse to a tree at the entrance to one of the <i>allées</i>,
and proceeded on foot. There was noise and light coming from the
stables, and the rooms above them where the garrison was housed.
These people were comfortable, even merry. He could hear their
laughter, their talk, the tramp and neigh of the horses, and
smell the savours of cooking. Whatever happened, servants were
always easy and fat...they would have been paid regularly,
servants and soldiers: he had enough money for that at
Ottenheim&mdash;money for a great deal of time to come...yes,
while the money lasted they would stay.</p>

<p>He pulled down his hat, and flung his cloak over the lower
part of his face. The wind was very bitter, rising suddenly with
icy deadliness from the north. The dark, ornate facade of the
house stood out with hard clearness from the icy blue of the sky,
from which all clouds had been swept with the coming-up of the
stars.</p>

<p>Christian looked at the rows of gigantic, heroic figures in
grandiose armour and fluttering draperies, that guarded the
double stairs and the long, important terrace by the entrance
door; the stone was cheap and friable, he noticed cracks. The
stables had a menacing and yet a futile look, as if they snarled
and threatened over treasure long since robbed from them, and
were frozen into attitudes of impotent rage. Above the house was
a flag, which hung limply to the pole, a dark nothingness; but
Christian knew the whole design thereof&mdash;the arms of Ketlar
and Kurland...she lived beneath that still, then.</p>

<p>He passed round to the side of the house, and lightly mounted
the balcony that ran in front of the room that had been his room,
and since, the room of the Princess Eleanora. Exactly thus,
precisely so, must Leopold have done that other night...some such
night as this, this same winter...So he would have climbed,
easily, by those heavy ornaments, onto the balcony; and so have
walked along, as cautiously as Christian was walking now, outside
the window, and peep, as he was peeping, between curtains half
drawn.</p>

<p>Christian looked into a lighted room, that had once been his
room&mdash;the most familiar chamber in his life, for in no other
place had he dwelt as long and as magnificently as he dwelt in
Ottenheim.</p>

<p>She was there. Odd that he and Leopold should both have
thought her dead! For she was there, and unchanged; seated by the
hearth, and playing a game of chess&mdash;by herself, for she was
quite alone, moving the black pieces with the right hand and the
white pieces with the left hand, absorbed in this childish
occupation. But ever, now and then, looking up into the fire with
a vague look, and then patting, delicately and lovingly, a blue
satin casket which stood beside her on the floor, and, in the
sweet and warm light of the perfumed candles, gleamed with a
coronet in seed pearls.</p>

<p>Christian guessed that in that casket were the letters of
Leopold; or, if not his letters, at least some memento of her
successful lover; and his surmise was correct. Leopold had
written many letters to Eleanora, and, though she had answered
none, she had most sacredly preserved them all; and that casket
was her constant companion in a loneliness which she had peopled
with dreams.</p>

<p>The room was well ordered and splendid, as he had left it well
ordered and splendid. There were his tapestries, his pictures,
his mirrors, his bed with the brocade curtains and heavy cords
and tassels. All the instructions that he had given with such
love and such arrogance for the reception of Eleanora had been
scrupulously carried out; she was gorgeously housed in his
Chateau of Ottenheim.</p>

<p>The fire had burnt clearly to hues of scarlet and orange, and
this rich, delicate light was over her figure, as she sat on the
floor at her game of chess, making a rosy hue in the smooth loops
of her blond hair, and sending rosy shadows on to her white
throat and breast. She seemed pure and childish as when he had
last seen her. But he could not see her face; only her slight
throat and her attitude&mdash;the attitude of one beguiling a
time of waiting with dreams and idle amusements. She was waiting
for Leopold, Christian thought; even though he had twice deserted
her, with unconquerable hope she was waiting for Leopold!</p>

<p>The wind blew over Christian as he looked through that
division in the curtains; blew even through his furred mantle and
chilled his breast. He was looking backward to some bubble blown
in youth, bright with many colours, gorgeous with many lustres:
<i>two</i> bubbles, in one of which floated Kurland, and in the
other Eleanora of Anhalt-Dessau; both broken now into the cold
air.</p>

<p>He considered coldly, as if he were considering the life of
another man, what his future might have been; what he would have
done as the ruler of Kurland and the husband of Eleanora. No more
fighting; an end of war; he would have proved himself there and
been tired of that. The moment would have come for the governor,
the administrator. He would have improved his country, put up
great, splendid buildings, opened magnificent schools, laid out
great tracts of agriculture, planned, governed, ruled,
stimulated, inspired. He would have had great and wise men at his
court, to teach his people and his children; he would have defied
equally the barbarous north and the heathen east; he would have
laid out in Kurland an elegant civilization; and people would
have come to place the house of Ketlar high among the princely
houses of Europe. All that he would have accomplished. He had the
gift, the patience and the courage.</p>

<p>But now he needed his courage for a harder thing: to fling
away his last dream as he had flung away all his gathered pomp,
an Empire and revenge alike flung away.</p>

<p>The Princess Eleanora rose, and smoothed down her grey satin
frock; she sighed and yawned and stretched and looked at the
clock. Another day nearly gone; thank God, another day!</p>

<p>Christian stared at her long and deeply, unheeding of the wind
that smote him as he watched. Strange that he should have thought
her so different from all the others, and been so afraid to take
her that night of their wedding; afraid, almost, that she would
perish in his embrace, die under his kiss...and even Leopold had
known better than that...he had taken her, and she lived and
smiled, like all the others. In his mind only had existed that
creature too fine, too pure for mortal desire. Like a little
sleek, plump kitten she yawned and stretched; then settled into
the silk cushions of the low chair, and drew the blue casket
towards her, to enjoy yet again her solitary pleasure: that of
perusing the letters of Leopold.</p>

<p>Christian thought: "I wonder what she has done with
mine&mdash;torn up&mdash;cast away."</p>

<p>He left the window and the balcony, and walked lightly across
the darkening park. He thought of the old Duchess, safe in her
heavy coffin with the many quarterings on the lid, safe in the
dark vault of Dürsheim; and he thought of Pons, and wondered
where they had buried him&mdash;the little pompous, fussy man who
had died rather than face a master betrayed. And he wondered
whether the soldiers remaining at Ottenheim would take service
with Leopold and who would have command of them&mdash;he had
taken pains with those soldiers; and so found his horse, and rode
back to Leopold's Château at Bosenberg.</p>

<p>As he entered the great, cold hall with all the pompous
portraits, where Gabor had waited not so long ago, he saw an
unfamiliar figure&mdash;that of Herr Lippmann, the astrologer,
whom for a great while he had not noticed or thought of; but the
astrologer had followed him, having nothing better to do, and
nowhere safer to go.</p>

<p>Christian, noting him, asked:</p>

<p>"Do you come with me on this expedition to Kurland, which is
not one, Herr Lippmann, for a civilian!"</p>

<p>And the astrologer answered, with a bow:</p>

<p>"I have some odd loyalty to Your Highness, and I know not what
it is."</p>

<p>Christian pointed to the black night beyond the uncurtained
window, where the moon was rising with pallid greyness, eclipsing
the chill stars, and where the comet glared, a dull smear on the
black horizon.</p>

<p>"What are your prophecies and portents to-night?" he asked,
lightly.</p>

<p>"When the heaven speaks," smiled Lippmann, "humanity is dumb,
Your Highness!"</p>

<p>Christian looked round at all the high-placed and gorgeously
framed portraits, dull, official, menacing; with diadems, crowns
and coronets, with ermine and purple, with orders and armour,
satins, velvets, and gold brocades; long, pale faces, with clear,
blank, large blue eyes&mdash;the face of Leopold repeated again
and again.</p>

<p>Herr Lippmann followed his ironic glance.</p>

<p>"They keep," he remarked, "all that Your Highness throws
away."</p>

<p>Christian said, drily:</p>

<p>"How differently I dreamed it all."</p>

<p>"How many men," smiled the old astrologer, "have remarked
that!"</p>

<p>"But few," responded Christian, "are or ever have been as
capable of accomplishing their dreams as I was."</p>

<p>"There's time," said Herr Lippmann.</p>

<p>But Christian answered:</p>

<p>"The time is passed."</p>

<p>He thought of Eleanora&mdash;stretching, yawning, lazy, snug,
luxurious&mdash;waiting; and he laughed, staring at the portraits
with the face of Leopold.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">THE spring was so bitter that men did not know
the winter was over, when Christian and his little troop rode
into Kurland on his audacious and pre-doomed expedition to
recover the dukedom of his father.</p>

<p>Those who followed him and knew him were aware that he had not
chosen this as anything but a means by which to die, and they did
not murmur at any hardship or defeat, though he never opened his
heart to them, and gave them frequently their choice to leave
him. They were diminished now, these soldiers, by brushes with
the enemy, by cold and by disease; not much more than five
hundred men followed Christian across the frontiers of Lithuania
into his own country, profaned now by a flaunting, alien
domination. Christian pushed on, without pause or pity, as he had
pushed on without pause or pity in his triumphal progress across
the Empire; on, across streams and valleys, mountains and marsh,
across Germany, across Poland, through the black firs and by
chains of frozen lakes; until he reached the first fortress held
by the Russians at Auts: and there he paused, and issued his
challenge, sending out his heralds while he remained on a dark
and frozen hill close by with his Uhlans and the standard of
Ketlar and Kurland.</p>

<p>His messenger claimed surrender, instant and submissive, to
Christian Ketlar, Duke of Kurland.</p>

<p>The Russian laughed grossly at this insane insolence, and
cried: "General Crack! General Bastardo!" while he in his turn
sallied out with his cumbrous, brilliant troops, and demanded the
instant surrender of the daring adventurers to the Czar of
Muscovy.</p>

<p>Christian and all his men had expected this response; the
challenge they had sent had not been hurled at an obscure
Russian, but to Death itself, whom they had already defeated on a
hundred fields, but who now after a little must defeat
them...</p>

<p>Christian gave the order to charge, "<i>En avant</i>"&mdash;as
he had given it so many times before to the same men; and the
Uhlans and Black Cuirassiers responded with shouts and shouts of
"General Crack! General Crack!"</p>

<p>"That, if nothing else!" smiled Christian, and bore down
headlong on the Russians, who outnumbered his force ten, fifteen
to one; who swept him and his Uhlans back beneath his own scanty
artillery.</p>

<p>Christian charged again and again, searching for death as if
he were searching for a lover; that day he wore no armour. The
Russians, amazed by the force and fury of his attack, were
repulsed more than once; but reinforcements hurried out of the
citadel and louder grew the Russian cries for "Surrender!" as
they pressed round General Crack. It was not their order nor
their intention to kill such a man as Christian. The Emperor of
All the Russias, the King of Prussia, and the present occupying
Duke of Kurland had, when apprised of his mad, foredoomed
enterprise, sent orders that he should be taken alive...all of
them hoped to engage the services of so brilliant, so audacious
and so famous a mercenary.</p>

<p>But General Crack did not fight as if he meant to be taken
alive; he had come there to die, to fling away his life as he had
flung away everything else, in high disdain of all of them; to
die as he could not live&mdash;a Ketlar, on soil the Ketlars had
governed for generations and centuries; the last of his House and
of his name...that at least here and now, that at least.</p>

<p>After two hours of frantic fighting, reckless charge and
bloody counter charge, a desperate and confused melée,
Christian's troops were driven back never to charge again; more
than half were slain, and some had surrendered; a few Uhlans with
bloody lances gathered round Christian and the flag of
Ketlar.</p>

<p>"You have done enough," said Christian to Banning, beckoning
him to his side; "give it tip now, and serve another man. As for
me, it is over."</p>

<p>The Swede, looking at him closely, saw that he was wounded;
blood-stained was the tattered lace that fell from his cravat
over his uniform; his right arm hung limp by his side, and his
dark face was ashen. "Let us charge again," he murmured, "and die
in the mêlée." But the Swede observed that he was reeling in the
saddle, and hardly knew what he said. Banning seized the horse's
bridle and turned him away.</p>

<p>"Your Highness does not wish to fall into their hands to die!"
he cried, hoarsely and abruptly.</p>

<p>But Christian tried to resist, and whispered:</p>

<p>"The flag, the flag!"</p>

<p>This had fallen, the standard bearer having been cut down near
them. Banning stooped, and rent it from the pole, flung it across
the saddle, and again led Christian's horse away, through the
stampeding press of cavalry on whom the Russians were again
closing.</p>

<p>But not far; Banning swerved as a shot whistled over his
shoulder, and in that instant he saw General Crack fall from the
saddle, while the horse, blood-stained, galloped wildly away
through the smoke of the guns from the fort.</p>

<p>Banning dismounted; they were a little apart from the general
engagement, half hidden behind the rising knoll where Christian
had taken his stand that morning, half sheltered by the black
pines, which sent their funereal darkness high into the cold
spring sky.</p>

<p>"Were you shot? Was Your Highness shot?" asked Banning,
kneeling beside the wounded man.</p>

<p>Christian nodded; then murmured:</p>

<p>"At last...it was long enough, eh?"</p>

<p>He raised himself on one elbow, and asked, in a difficult
whisper, for the flag. "If I wrap it round me," he said, "they
will not profane it. That is the best end for it&mdash;and me,
eh, Banning? A grave, a shroud&mdash;a grave in Kurland," he
stammered, smiling, "a shroud, the Ketlar flag...after all, not
so mean."</p>

<p>Banning obeyed. Christian twisted the standard round his
waist. The effort made him cough, and he wiped blood from his
lips, his chin and breast.</p>

<p>"Don't let them get me while I'm alive, Banning," he muttered;
"don't let them have me till I'm dead! This should have been
quicker."</p>

<p>Banning drew his sword and stood on guard. Christian turned
over on his side. His own soil; the soil of Kurland...At least
that...Kurland...after all...</p>

<p>His attention was fixed by something he saw at the root of the
tree, a small, strong, bright green leaf, thrusting up through
all the dead, arid pine needles, all the black, dirty slush of
ice and winter: one bright, fresh, vigorous young leaf. He gazed
at this with his hand to his heart, while the blood trickled over
his fingers and down over the precise uniform that he had always
kept so carefully. The Russians would be storming up the knoll
any second. Banning prayed that General Crack might die quickly;
and Christian said, still staring at the leaf: "Shoot me, if I do
not die immediately. I would do it myself if my hand were more
steady."</p>

<p>Banning, looking over his shoulder into the fire-stained murk,
answered:</p>

<p>"They have not observed us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This should not take so long," murmured Christian, striving
to preserve his countenance in face of the pangs that assailed
him.</p>

<p>The Swede gazed down at his master through the vapours that
had drifted even here, and saw what he had so often seen, the
unmistakable impress of death.</p>

<p>"Your Highness may be snatched away at any moment," he said,
"and do not fear but that I can keep them at bay&mdash;"</p>

<p>Christian set his head against the tree; he made an effort, as
if he were before a mirror, to adjust his cravat, his uniform,
the stars on his breast; a troop of Russians stormed up the
knoll; Banning leapt to his feet and cried, "Halt!" in so
commanding a voice and with such a sweep of his bare sword that
the enemy paused.</p>

<p>But there had been no need for this defiance; General Crack
was dead and staring at the bright green leaf.</p>
